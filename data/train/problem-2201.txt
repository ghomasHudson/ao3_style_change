“Yeah. I’ll be taking you to him. Well… them.”
I could not imagine anyone absconding with my heart. Still, if someone had, why should I not pursue it? Why should he not? There was no pressing need to consider financial reasons, and I was confident that social status was of no great concern to him. Besides, Mother was our only living relative, save Mycroft, and she had taken herself rather neatly out of the picture. And Mycroft could go hang.
Sherlock shot his self a murderous look and then quickly regained his focus. “We have a mission to accomplish. I need to know which room a man is located in. I suspect it will be this floor, for concierge members. We need to plan exactly how to stop him. But first, we need to find him.”
A ping to the mobile. Right on cue.
Part Two of Sherlock and John In Your Hometown
“Then kindly explain to me what the fuck are you talking about.”
"You... don't like the younger version of you."
Preself coughed. “Well, not by that name, no, but I’m certain the concept to which the name refers is not unfam--”
“So you already calculated that I would be willing to set aside all that happened this morning, just to get a piece of that perfect little arse?”
"No. Not even remotely."
My Dearest Brother,
"Yes. I wonder what Mrs Turner shall be offering this evening?"
Do consider sending John an intimidating letter. I am told it is a fashionable way in which to express one’s concern.
“Concert violinist. Auditioning. Callouses, tapping finger patterns of a rather difficult piece and frequently looking over to that bin, where his instrument is stored. It is perfectly safe, though the case is likely extremely dirty, as that backpacker sitting beneath the bin has stored beside it a rucksack which has been across Asia. That necklace is clearly from Nepal, and has been purchased recently. He keeps rubbing at the amber, but it has no groove in it. He’ll wear it down before too long. The new gym shoes are from Putian. If I were to head down the aisle, I could confirm where, precisely, the tobacco is from which he has been rolling recently that has stained his fingers, but frankly, if my only goal is proving to you that this meeting wasn’t orchestrated by your sister, I would hope I could do so without leaving my seat and having to suffer through whatever other odours he has amassed.”
"I suspect the seed has been planted by readers who think themselves observant. It is far more difficult to unlodge an idea than a bullet, once it has found a home," he reached across the table and tapped my forehead gently, "here." He then kissed the spot gently, as if erasing a mark with his lips. I remained, however, unpacified by the gesture.
would have noticed the clerk hesitating about which room number to give me and considered the likelihood of there having been another room booked for someone with the same last name and had made additional inquiries— therefore eliminating the need to break into the registry. Your goal had been speed, not thoroughness. I don’t make those kinds of mistakes. Anymore.”
John looked as if he was attempting to fill in the missing pieces of the conversation without success-- two geniuses talking over his head could only serve to make him even more ill-at-ease.
I know this will come as a surprise to you, although it really shouldn't.
Sherlock: Early 20th century, built during the oil boom, no doubt. What a strange building. Not practical.
“Wait. Now just…hold it right there. Who told you that?”
They stepped into the lift and silently watched as the doors closed.
Alive.
"I fail to understand your meaning."
"Lord?" He looked down at his shoes. "Caw! Thank you much," he said, and hurried back round the corner, ignoring whatever else the woman had said. Once safely out of sight he replaced his jacket, smoothing wrinkles as best he could, and binned the bag, torn paper, and lotion.
hoping for a pat on the back, a nod of the head,
Holmes eyed me, puzzled.
“Charming example. Fixed timeline principle. Everything has already been accounted for.”
"So. I am you?" asked the preself, interrupting his attempt at planning. Though he still hadn’t a clue what else to do, in all honesty.
"What was your first case?"
My own brother had no abundance of concern for my well-being, be it in matters of love or of any other subject, so perhaps that is why I have been remiss in my attention to duty. I, therefore, beg your forgiveness and seek to honor your position, in as much as your younger brother might be considered your charge. I offer my apology for any slight I may have committed in following through with what likely seems, upon its surface, a hasty action. I wish to assure you that it was nothing of the kind, but instead the natural progression of our growing affection.
“He was about to dart back into that tunnel. There was 28% chance he would manage to slip past Lestrade’s best and brightest back at the pawnshop, and althiugh admittedly small, it wasn’t one I was willing to take.”
He was looking right at me now. It should have made me more fearful for the irrevocable step I was about to take. It did not. I had seldom felt as calm nor as steady of purpose. "I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I have loved you for some time now. I see this state as continuing well into the foreseeable future, but I have spoken of this love before, as have you. So...let me clarify my meaning."
And whenever she heads toward me,
I stepped toward him, catching a faint blush in the fading light. "Ever since I walked into the laboratory and you knew beyond any doubt that I had returned from Afghanistan, I have been operating under a false assumption."
So. Instead of saying what I was thinking, which was somewhere between, “You are right. I always told you I was just an intern.
Red hair dye.
Sherlock’s preself laughed. “Oh, I’m sure I’ll find a way to get whatever it is I need.” He gave a quick nod and headed out the door.
“Offended by your finding me attractive? I suppose some people could theoretically be offended by being the first attractive man you saw after a long argument with your sister, but I am not one of them.”
The next flower circling out from the center was a few clusters of yellow rhododendron, with a list of meanings longer than its overly tall and awkward stem: friendship, apology, intense emotion, undying love, extreme betrayal, a broken heart, infidelity, jealousy. Why any flower would ever be used in a bouquet with such a wide variety of interpretations was beyond me. Truly a scattered and disheveled mess of an arrangement, and I found myself almost annoyed at its very existence. Though Sherlock said he had chosen them for their scent, it still felt so very inappropriate for someone to have created such a composition. It was art gone wrong, as ill-fitted as Shelley’s monster. Surely my brother could relate to the discord of incorrect notes within a concerto? How could one know if they were meant as an apology to a dear friend or a representation of the intense emotion of the betrayed and brokenhearted?
Two cancellations in a row, and John was going back home a bit earlier than expected.
It is a simple statement, which speaks to a greater truth.
Nobody here likes a wet dog.
in that room. And both in danger. And we should be headed there right now.” He hastened his pace.
“No, this only proves that no matter how similar it seems, it’s really entirely different!”
John spun a slightly stunned but still entirely amenable Sherlock to face him. “And I know that I like to do this.”
“Or, you could join me instead. Actually, I‘d been thinking, when I was out on the sidewalk for those ten minutes, five if you don’t count my trying to listen through the door, how sometimes you really need to live a little, you know? So, I’d suggest One If By Land, Two If By Sea. Shame we’d miss out on the atmosphere, cause I’ve heard it’s really something. Has quite the reputation. I’ve never been there. You?”
“Remember what I said about you sucking me off? Yeah, I do think maybe we’ll just try that now. Shift backward.” He released Sherlock just long enough for him to slide down the bed, grateful Sherlock’s mattress was so large. John wanted to be sure to have enough room at the head of the bed so he could pivot his weight forward if he wanted to. He couldn’t fill Sherlock’s mouth up with the sheer size, but he could still create a similar effect.
“I watched everyone lining up for the flight. It’s a ..thing I do..when I’m bored.”
I laughed.
John turned to Sherlock’s preself. “Seems you hardly have a monopoly on being obnoxious.”
Sherlock, I do believe I have frightened your Army Doctor. His signature line has spoken volumes. Am I truly such a force to be reckoned with?
I pushed the chair aside and began to pace. "Has it never occurred to them that walking long distances when one slightly favors one leg can cause strain on the juncture of foot and calf, and that it was not...
“I never did mention how we at Scotland Yard privately rejoiced at that foul creature’s demise.”
are anxious.” Sherlock leaned over to kiss John. It was soft and gentle at first, but insistent enough to make John relax back into his former position. Sherlock took the opportunity to climb on top of him, straddling his frame. John had a brief moment where he did feel… off. Maybe just different. In this position, Sherlock was far bigger than he ever was lying down,and with his knees over John’s shoulders he seemed even smaller than he was, though John had never thought about it before. Now he towered over John’s much smaller frame. Maybe Sherlock was right. Maybe he was the one who was anxious here. Just a bit. But any sense of awkwardness vanished once Sherlock began kissing him. The initial softness of his lips faded as each kiss became more intense, more passionate, more demanding, until John felt as if he could lift this giant up and place him square down on his cock. Of course Sherlock, ever-perceptive, took that moment to lube John up some more and sink himself down.
“Should be.”
It certainly throws him a bit, hearing his name, but then he looks at his mobile and then at Sherlock again, makes the connection, and nods. “She said if I could manage to do that, she’d tell her therapist all about it. And I really wanted her to keep going back again; she’s been really good for Harry. So we made a deal. I’d do it, and I’d text her when I had. That was...that was the text. And she just told me that she wanted some kind of proof, and I told her to piss off. I wasn’t about to prove anything to her.”
John didn’t kiss Sherlock anything close to gently. John claimed him. As Sherlock began to kiss him back, John grabbed him by his coat and pushed him backward into the wall, setting about removing every bit of clothing he could manage while his partner remained pinned in place.
“Uh, yes. Home. Returning from helping my brother with a pet project. He’s too lazy to do things himself, so it falls to me to keep the peace.” In this case, quite literally. If the papers hadn’t been recovered, there would have been an international incident within the month. Forces on the ground within the year, given the current political climate.
“Well, 999 it is then,” said John’s preself. He tried his mobile and frowned.
“Yeah. Yeah, I do. I have been here with you for, as you said, 13 minutes now—“
"Oh, no. On the contrary, I
"And that is, that you know how to read my thoughts. I will admit, I remain convinced you do, as you have proven this time and time again. You have, in fact, done this very thing within moments of my arrival at the train station. However... in this instance... I need to make them absolutely transparent, beyond any secondary explanation."
“When it comes to writing of sordid topics such as murder suitably for consumption by the masses, there is much to be less than forthcoming about. Though you are correct to not doubt Watson’s sincerity. He is straightforward. Even when he changes the stories to protect the innocent, he feels obligated to inform the reader he has done so.” He looked at me a moment more before turning to the fireplace and poking at the coals therin. The poker seemed slightly misshapen, and I wondered if it was the very same which he had straightened with his bare hands after the threatening visit from Doctor Roylott. “The stories may be presented as fact, but within them lies a good deal of fiction. Still, you are a young girl, Enola. There are, things, with which you might not be so well-acquainted, as well as things which the public is not yet prepared to read.”
“I hope you smoothed things over with Greg. He’s the only one who can provide you with cases, you know. Don’t piss him off too much,” admonished John, as Sherlock shook some stray leaves from his coat and hung it up on the rack.
Holmes was waiting in our old sitting room upon my return from the unfortunate meeting, examining the empty spot on the shelf that once held his case files, now packed away in a cottage attic. He ran a finger along the shelving and considered the dust.
"And I didn't actually say that," John's preself added.
“I didn’t.”
"I figured out the date Piecroft sent me to, and I wouldn't be so sure about that."
“Right. Well, if you do, you aren’t likely to get it.”
“So. Time to hop on pop.”
“Leave the investigating to me and...Sherlock,” said Sherlock. We will find out the room he is in. Just stand by the ice machine facing opposite directions and watch the elevators and the paths to the stairs at the far ends of the hallway to be sure he doesn't leave. We will contact the police, and they can handle it from there while we go disarm the bomb, as we had done previously. If it is still in the same location.”
“This,” John gestured round, “is a holding station? It serves the same purpose as that thing we were strapped into with all the dials and sensors while Mycroft set the controls...the thing we were in just before we got here? This is so much...nicer. How has technology gone backwards over time?”
"Exploring worlds. Once Dr Weise said it was possible, I wanted to see for myself. Remember what I said about truth versus crazy? I picked a world. And then, having explored it, I picked another."
It has also been called to my own careful attention, in light of some unfortunate events, that you might come to question my willingness to assist you in future endeavors. Let this letter, then— which I will admit to having gone through countless revisions as fits one whose talents lie in numbers far more than in letters in the hopes of ensuring its lasting service as a keepsake— confirm that you have, as ever, my pledge of assistance in whatever form required, and, as family should never have to call into question (though far too often are made to do so), my love.
"I know. The grammar is horrendous. ‘Had’ is correct in this instance. It was, after all, in your past. And the answer is, the same way you can detect a bubble. It creates a field."
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath and cursed his mobile’s failure. He shot off a quick text to Sherlock.
“You all can discuss ruining another universe. I’m heading to higher ground to call 999.” John’s preself headed out of the tunnel.
John points to another random passenger. “Him.”
In any case, it was a private matter, until he might wish it not to be so.
John’s preself didn’t budge. Sherlock looked at John, a question flickering in his eyes for just a moment, and then resolving itself. Sherlock’s preself shut the door quietly and leaned his back against its surface. He folded his arms as well, and kept his eyes locked on John’s preself.
"I don't mean that negatively," he added quickly. " I meant, they fill in the gaps with richness. The notes themselves are of less consequence than the tone. And by the time she gets to the tenth movement, you will play the slower melody magnificently...and she will be so overwhelmed by gratitude for your presence that any other sins will be forgiven."
"Watson, I have missed you."
“Well it does to me! I’m not “the woman in the relationship”. You seem to think that your…caretaking role…puts you in this superior position which has stamped itself upon our sex life. Maybe my relative lack of experience plays into this as well. It isn’t much, numerically speaking, but I’d say I have a great deal more varied and practical experience with my three fingers than…” Sherlock turned away. “Nevermind. That came out entirely wrong.”
“John. The choices presented to you were not the same. And therefore, the outcomes could not possibly have been the same. He knows this.”
John laughed and leaned back into his chair.
“Slight.”
“Well. Yes. Good. Again, sorry to have bothered you. You’re welcome to go back to your magazine.” John folds his hands on his lap, shifts his shoulders, and stares straight ahead, looking pained he hadn’t chosen a window seat.
Mrs. Hudson brought the pitcher and a glass and left for 221C, and Smith was escorted out, determined to keep quiet till he could make his phone call.
until you say
It is of little consequence to me whether they are idle or not.
during sex. Then maybe Sherlock would talk. And wouldn’t that be a thing? Once he started, Sherlock would probably never stop. It wouldn’t take long for Sherlock to analyze himself, assess things, assert his own control... and that was a good thing. An excellent thing. He would speak up, and John would provide. But for now...deduction. Never before had he thought of himself in this way— doing what Sherlock does, in a sexual context. He’s always done this sort of thing, though. Always tried to be a few steps ahead of his partner. Adjusting. Compensating— without overcompensating— for his, well, that was when he had worried about such things. Not anymore.
“No. It isn’t.” It was sad, seeing him trying to project authority and failing so miserably. I took a step forward and he tried again to stop me.
Sherlock spoke softly. “When I win— and I will— I intend to have you do whatever I want, John. And you’ll need to be able to stop me, should things get uncomfortable for you. You will need a safeword.” Sherlock sat down opposite John and leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “I’m not entirely new to the concept. I have had other partners before I met you. I wouldn’t say I was a Dom as such, but, I was the more dominant partner. And I was usually on top. Topped. I usually topped.”
“So... in and out." He paused. "It just occurred to me that that could be seen as a double-entendre. That was not my intention."
“Yes, John II here proves there is room for plenty of variations," piped up Sherlock's preself, "by his not being gay."
"What? Oh, I'm not supposed to say anything? Well, we already have to fix some sort of time anomaly, so I guess we just fix a slightly bigger one. And all because you were concerned you had screwed things up with-- what? Bad sex tips? I mean yeah a bit of blind-leading-the-blind there, but whatever you two did made this version," John gestured with his thumb toward Sherlock, "feel considerably more at ease, so, there's that. I figured I owed you one and... well... seeing as you are both Sherlock... I...." The preself raised his eyebrows very slightly, as if he were trying not to make it appear visible and falling just short of success. "Never mind. Just. I wanted to see what Sherlock was like before I met him. And to thank you."
“Delirious?”
“How many versions of them would you care to stop? A hundred? A thousand?”
“Well, we were lucky to have had a switch. I suppose that was the important thing.”
John waited. He wanted to finish Sherlock’s thoughts for him by blurting the rest out on his behalf—as if that would be the most efficient way to end this moment, to move right past it. But he forced himself to wait. Sherlock looked at him with glistening eyes before he turned his gaze back to the waiting train car and cleared his throat. John wanted to cry on his behalf. He might even have, a bit.
Mycroft grimaced at Sherlock's mocking attempt at proper grammar. If such a thing truly existed, it hadn't been codified yet. He remained uncertain as to whether or not Sherlock...the Sherlock that had written the email... hadn't made the whole thing up just so Mycroft would feel ignorant. If he had actually spoken to Dr Weise though, that would make Sherlock the world's leading authority on time travel-- even if he had retained little of what he had once known. Perhaps he had known all of it, all this time, and had simply refused to disclose this knowledge. It seemed entirely in character.
the problem
should discover
I gave up on that and started pacing back and forth on the sidewalk. I should go in. I might not ever see him again. But if he wanted me out and would listen to Smith, that might just be his best chance at getting help and recovering. Of course Neicey saw me, and I guess that was interesting enough for her to put down her phone. I wished she had just kept right on playing her games. I didn’t feel much like putting on a brave face. My best friend was in there dying, and I was shut out.
“I was fine. The case was fine. The sex was fine.”
Now that is interesting.
think I was referencing you."
“Which ones?” He got quiet for a bit, and I knew he was deciding which ones I'd approve of and which I wouldn’t, and it made me smile. At least he was growing up right. Marie’s new man wasn’t Dad yet. I decided to help a little. “I like Doom Eternal.”
on my side. Someone I could trust. Maybe he was looking out for me already. Maybe… Maybe he had written that other cypher warning me of Mycroft’s trap? Or maybe he hadn’t. Maybe this was just a random bunch of flowers that...no. No, they weren’t. The question of whether or not he had sent the message which had read “ALONE PART PART ALONE” was already beginning to take the altogether-too-familiar circuitous path through my head—doubt, followed by certainty, followed by doubt once more—but the flowers were beyond coincidence.
For in times past, he too has shared this fate,
Well, sort of good. He hadn’t expected Sherlock to be down for the count so quickly. He just wanted something to put him in more of a pleasant mood, so maybe they could still try that—
“No reason to be embarrassed,” John said. “You really shouldnt put much weight on it until I get a good look at you.”
“I assure you I had no idea precisely where you had served. It was an easy enough deduction that you had served, however, given that you had a military bearing, especially whilst waiting in line to board the aircraft. Combined with your tanning pattern, it suggested a general region. Nothing more concrete than that.”
While not exactly sinister, as the one sent to Mrs Watson had been, this floral arrangement was most definitely peculiar. Even the placement of them, upon a small pedestal by the front door, seemed unusual. They were far from artful. Of fine quality, fresh and lovely, but certainly lacking any cohesion as a bouquet. They appeared to be arranged in something of a spiral. I could see at its centre an overly-large red camellia, “the flame of one’s heart”, looking rather unbalanced drowning in a sea of bright yellow tulips.
"Not at all."
John's preself downed the offered drink faster than either of them had anticipated, smiled, and said, “Good thing I know who you are, and you're not just some random guy introducing himself via a drink and a bad pickup line."
I grabbed the book my mother had gifted me in order to reference the flowers, to assist with my assault on paper. Certain I could teach my wiser, older brother a thing or two, I attempted to recall them all from memory: hyssop, monkshood, yellow tulips, bluebells. I jotted them down, each flower less suitable than the one before, then sat upon my comfortable chair and glanced over the list as a whole.
“But if I can shove him out a window, or something?”
"Exaggerating my.... if anything I am underplaying them! This blasted leg aches whenever it is sufficiently cold or wet, which, in this bloody climate, is damned near constant!"
"Weighing potential outcomes, Holmes?"
John's preself stared back at Sherlock's. "Of course I knew. It was... it is... a choice I decided not to make."
“You know, I wasn’t leaning toward EMT, " the preself said. "I was thinking more along the lines of firefighter. But it was still on the list. Got to be able to afford the courses first, though. School during the day, work nights. Desk clerk seemed a good fit. Study while I work, when it gets slower overnight. This is the fifth opening I’ve applied at today.”
The preself's grin spread slowly as he turned to Sherlock. "I knew there was more to him than a certain... compact efficiency."
“Yeah, me too.”
I had been rather delighted to have seen the acknowledgement of my efforts in securing Doctor Watson’s release in print, and not even in code. Sherlock must have won that battle over Mycroft, for I couldn’t imagine his ever wishing to appear in error or to have his dirty laundry aired in any conceivable manner, but I remembered well Sherlock’s face when he saw his friend again. Unguarded joy. Surely he had composed the notice and Mycroft had reluctantly agreed to it. I had hoped it was more evidence that my brothers were not of the same mind. Still, I now was being both acknowledged and summarily dismissed within the very same sentence!
“I like what I’m seeing. But don’t think I’m not going to tend to that leg first.” Clearly it couldn’t be that severe an injury if he was able to put all that weight on his left side. He stepped forward to examine Sherlock’s leg. Sherlock’s pale, absolutely pristine, leg.
John clearly wasn’t expecting that— the language, the assertiveness, the suggestion itself— but he simply nodded, said, ”Gladly,” and began to move Sherlock into position. Then John turned back to his preself. “I want this, and you do to. You want it even more. You’ve wanted it for a very long time.”
“Medical school? I go to medical school?”
Oh, Mycroft had been pissed off at Sherlock countless times. He had even been pissed off at Sherlock before his actual birth; Mummy went on a health food binge just before his conception and dragged the whole family along with her. And Mycroft knew he would continue to be pissed off at Sherlock well into the future.
I let us in, and Holmes hadn’t moved since I left him, though now his eyes were closed. I automatically tracked his breathing. Steady enough. His lips and the skin under his eyes had that distinct purplish tint I was afraid of. It hadn’t been there when I left. I wondered if this English dude with a face like a snowman in a blizzard even knew what that meant, or if he just figured signs like that wouldn’t show on dark skin and wouldn’t even bother to check. He might know a lot about viruses, but I knew what they did inside people. I tried to get the point across without forcing him to acknowledge his deficiencies. “The indicators of cyanosis around his lips and eyes are new symptoms that must have emerged during the time when I went to get you. He had labored breathing when I left, though.”
“You know. Try to look her up or something. Just. Don’t.” John wrapped his arm around Sherlock . “If she does exist here, consider yourself lucky if she isn’t particularly interested in you, and don’t try to make her be.”
Geraniums meant folly, stupidity, and a true friend. Broad enough to be either meaningless or a scathingly precise reprimand. It became clear to me that these flowers had never been intended as a presentation from someone to someone. They were still undoubtedly a message, however. And if my brother had chosen each flower himself, they were a message which he had created as his own reminder— it would speak with no less clear a voice within his head than the mingling of my mother’s and my own which frequently informed me that I would be just fine alone.
I have one last adventure to write, though I doubt it will be the last that Doyle sees fit to publish. One far more fiction than fact. I believe I shall give you a ridiculous accent and an even more ridiculous goatee. Perhaps have us part ways. Some suitable drama. You’d hate it. Then, my writing finished, our legacy assured, I will bide my time, until we meet again.
to ask
“Eyeshadow?”
John got up from the edge of the bed. “Come with me!”
I sighed. Sleep. What a novel concept
. ‘The Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign, throbbed with dull persistency.' "
The woman looked stunned-- as if the heavens had dropped a pale-eyed angel in the middle of Harrod's to impart this very special message-- but she still answered, regardless.
There had been a single camelia in the center, I recalled—it was what had initially drawn my eye—but of the rest I was far less certain. I closed my eyes to best picture the arrangement. The garish yellow tulips had been next. I believed them to have a negative meaning, as did most yellow flowers, and was correct to find they stood for a hopeless and desperate love. I chuckled to myself. A thoroughly unsuitable bouquet indeed!
Too long to wait. John would have to find him on his own. He texted ‘He has John,’ and rushed down the hallway. His self had had to act so quickly he hadn’t even been able to accurately type out SOS.
Up until this point the two versions of "Please, Do Help Your Self" are identical. This is the chapter is where the split happens. This is the foursome path— Path B. For MCD, choose Path A.
“Yeah.”
John: She said it was right down the street... oh here it is.
My Dear Sir,
“But if we can’t change its location in space, we can change its location in time, right? Keep it right here, physically, but send it back to prehistoric London and let it kill some dinosaurs?”
“Pilot?”
The man—a captain, most likely—was clearly visiting someone himself and is now returning home. The placidity on his features is an easy read. A completed family obligation. Wrong time of year for weddings. Not a medical necessity, or the projected relief would be far more limited in its scope due to lingering concerns. The stranger is still young enough to have living parents, but...oh. He is supposed to be answering the posed question, isn’t he?
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
"True." He was lost in thought, perhaps nostalgic for the days where we followed suspects in hot pursuit. "But certainly, a man such as yourself might wish to have a second wife. There is no shame in that."
Sherlock interrupted. “Anyone who invented ways to navigate time and space would naturally have enemies.”
“Oh, I don’t know. I’m not sure I would sleep too well, anyway, even with lots of quiet and...bamboo.”
Mycroft Holmes
"And that particular instrument..."
“She meaning your sister? Well, no. I didn’t know anything about you until we met today. I thought, perhaps, your combat experience might have—“
"Well, yeah that was obvious. Couldn't have been that perfect."
I wish to offer you and Dr Watson my congratulations on your latest romantic adventure. There was, indeed, a time when I would have read such an account with a degree of contempt: a notion we may, at some point in our lives which grows ever more distant with each passing year, have shared. But they say with age comes a degree of wisdom. (As your senior by some seven years I can attest to the veracity of this aphorism.)
“That should do it,” Sherlock says, as he powers off the mobile.
“You can just speed-dial the government?”
John practically dragged Sherlock by the scruff of the neck to the other room where the preselves were resting.
"Lord Moran. Well, here he goes by that. In other universes he is just Sebastian. Occasionally he holds a military rank. There are a few of them and from what I can tell, they are all, without exception, terrible human beings. Forgers, assassins, extortionists."
I know he had once accused Doctor Watson of seeing without observing. I had observed without seeing.
Sherlock's preself was in another room, the sound of clinking glass emanating from the kitchen, and he appeared to not so much hear as sense his two guests materialising somewhere in the living area. "Just a moment,” he called out. “Finishing up. Have a seat. Oh, and do mind the box on the mantelpiece. That should tell you all you need to know."
“I also doubt it is important. But it might be interesting. And, quite frankly, I am very, very … very bored. What are you texting your sister, about me?”
“You do realise I am over six feet tall and weigh, oh let’s call it 80 kg. I’ve put on some muscle since I last measured properly. And that is…slight…to you?”
Sherlock looked grim. “This is extremely dangerous. Yes, we could find something like that, if it exists. But we are better off doing this through conventional means. Such as having him arrested. Last time, we had undercover agents posing as hotel employees bring him in. That would work. But we need to prevent him from using the bomb in the meantime. Which means tailing him. Doing that without being seen is next to impossible. He knows we will be trying to stop him.”
He looked at me for a long moment and read my thoughts, as he had so often done in the past, To this day I am not sure whether I found that ability more comforting or disturbing. "You may continue to portray me as buckram, but while you are contemplating making some adjustments, might I suggest you remedy the misconception of my knowledge of politics as 'feeble'-- before another royal family concludes I have little respect for the utter ridiculousness which is the aristocracy and takes their case,
"Twenty eight," added the preself.
no matter how strange and colorless the clothes you may wear,
“Not done exploring you yet. That can wait. Just a bit, though, I promise,” John said, careful not to thwart his efforts too much. After all, that was what they both wanted, just… “Patience,” John said. He could feel Sherlock still trying to move his hips forward, meeting the resistance from John’s weight. Sherlock liked the resistance, then. Good to know.
then shake their heads in disgust.
Sherlock looked at his preself. Had it have been another person wearing the same expression, Sherlock might have believed they were as truly indifferent as they appeared. Since this was some variation of himself, he knew better.
“Ok, well, be good for your Momma, and I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”
No. He isn’t any more interesting than the magazine.
“I know it wasn’t the right way to have handled it… what I had done the last time we were here. I owe you an apology,”
“Afghanistan.”
“And the current experiment?”
"Ah, yes. You might do well to add that to my catalogue of faults."
Sherlock made as if to respond and then simply grabbed his coat and headed out without a word. He came back forty minutes later with a surprisingly thin file. John had been expecting a fat stack of disheveled old papers.
“No. Not from here. I’d have to be in the hallway, but then there wouldn’t be any cover. I can't just stand there. What if I move to the stairs itself? I could go a floor above and just look down. He wouldn’t notice me. People don’t look up.”
“As in, you didn’t expect it to be fine? Since when are our expectations so low? What the fuck is going on, Sherlock? What kind of fucking experiment was it? We agreed. We,” John stopped to take a deep breath and count to himself. “We agreed that you wouldn’t set things up at home to recreate a case. That it was rude, and even possibly dangerous, but mostly that it was unfair to use me for that without my knowledge.”
“I very much would, yes.”
“And you will cooperate with this doctor?”
"Sounds like me so far."
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
When I saw the publisher's copy, I deliberately ignored the literary serving of guilt that was Blanched Soldier.
"More like it."
Holmes merely stared at me, his grey eyes widening, surprised, in the pale light of his new electric lamp.
John had little interest in Sherlock sucking him off, though. Not that that mouth wasn’t extraordinary. Not that he hadn’t thought of that mouth doing various things to him on sleepless nights over the past few years. No, he was far more interested in what kinds of sounds he could coax out of Sherlock and how they would change based on what he was doing to him. His kind of experiment.
“And I’m supposed to just let that small little detail about you faking getting shot go?”
“Well, it’s how you carry it, I suppose. Your frame.”
that were in
The preself paused, then fidgeted with his cuffs. "I have the capability of deletion even without a bubble."
Sherlock sighed.
The preself glared. "So I am to be grateful to you for leaving me in a state where I couldn't care less if I lived or died, because it ultimately led to my meeting Gabe Lestrade?"
“Stole Lestrade’s case files so you could be more present with me tonight?” John beamed. “I… That’s legitimately romantic. Though not exactly one of the traditional love languages. Stealing case files.”
As always...the original, followed by my version.
I am a father. An adult. With adult responsibilities. I’ve got no room in my life for contemplating whatever the fuck it was we had going. It was more than a friendship, less than a relationship, and it was a bad thing to be thinking about when I was trying to rest.
I still hold that my desire to see him again was in spite of this game of his, not because of it. I believe this to be the moment I first began to suspect it for the flirtation which it was.
John looked over at the love of his life, expecting to find him scowling at a case file. Instead, Sherlock was asleep.
“And find a way to seal it off,” added the original John, attempting to rejoin the conversation.
“No injuries then?”
Mister. So that’s what was so funny. Leave it to Holmes, the unofficial detective, to know an unofficial doctor. I had one shot, and I wasn’t gonna waste it. I pushed right past the smirking doorman and I was inside.
"Well I doubt they will come back before the deed is done. But with two of them there could easily be a second detonator. We are going to have to disarm it at the source. At Sumatra Road Station. But Sherlock should be doing that already."
That was absolutely the wrong thing to say, and I think he knew it the second it left his mouth. “Look, Holmes. I have spent the last god knows how many hours--“
“Yours has sodium laurel sulfate. It’s a foaming agent designed to fool you into thinking your teeth are actually being cleaned better. Higher-end and naturally-derived brands aren’t so foamy.  It’s a rather unpleasant sensation, I might add. Yours also contains above average concentrations of saccharine.”
“John Watson, as if you didn’t know already.” John takes it, and Sherlock frowns slightly. Whatever this is, or could be, he has blown it already. It doesn’t generally go over well, knowing things.
“It’s one of many possible theories,” said Sherlock. He glared at his preself. “We can't say anything with certainty.”
without even wrinkling the conversation.
"He, was, however, most assuredly not you. So...therefore...he was only of passing interest."
“I’ve learned it works for certain people and not for others, I will give you that.”
I just stared. Probably a spiking fever. I could only hope it would break. I suddenly felt like leaving him now would be a bad idea.
“You watched me lining up for the flight?”
“I haven’t exactly reached that level of impulsivity. Dinner? I think all they have is a biscuit or a pack of pretzels.”
“Sherlock, I...can’t ...quite,” he began, than taking a breath and riding through a wave of pleasure which threatened to overtake him completely, John managed to regain his voice. “Ok if we try again with you on your side, your top leg out forward and your bottom leg straight, I can ….can straddle your leg and get some more depth…” And if that didn’t work...cock,one finger, two fingers, three fingers. John knew how to get what he was after.
“Yeah” John pulled Sherlock back against his chest. “What about Moran? He needs to leave this dimension.”
and which
"The swimming pool. You know all about that."
"That's not it. I will explain it later. I will even provide a demonstration to remove all doubt. But, not yet. And that isn't what had you so concerned at any rate.” The preself gestured with a quick movement of his head to John. "Returning his little flirtatious comment with one of my own... that's considered being polite, no? So he won't feel too rejected when I turn down the next, inevitable, thinly-veiled offer to go along with the one he just stopped short of finalising. Just making you both feel better, implying I at least understand what you see in him. I have no desire to bed my Self and my future husband."
"You refer to the cocaine. I believe I have removed all mention of it in my recent stories, and perhaps in future editions I could be--"
Holmes looked right at me. He had no need to reread the passage from the source to ensure his accuracy. "I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time before," said he.
I eyed him with false suspicion as long as I could before I broke into laughter. “Yes. What sort of detective would you be if you could not discern that? There are many such persons in the world who are undoubtedly attractive but hold no promise. I am certain every woman within these pages you so much as glanced upon will prove a romantic interest for those longing to find it, whilst they miss the true developing romance entirely.”
Holmes smiled broadly, and continued. “And one of the great true romances of our time, no less. But...with regard to your occasional comments complimenting men, though you have done so in previous instances, one should always bear in mind the judgment upon such comments may be evolving with the passage of time.  Still, you are quite a ways away from, say, Mr Wilde's level of suggestive prose. It falls heavily in your favour that you have my guidance. Even if one were actively seeking out the true romance within, it would be difficult to find and impossible to prove.” He smiled. “Of course, you do have to choose to mind my suggestions. I did warn you about the implications of infidelity regarding the one with Miss Cushing's ear, did I not?'
“My goal remains to get the right John to the right location and to stop this explosion. Everything else is inconsequential. At least there is the assurance that no harm can come to you or your John while you are in another universe.”
Sherlock turned to his preself. "Are the people in this universe aware of Travellers?"
“Really, John?”
Sherlock's phone pinged. It was John.
“Well, that safe of his contained a great many secrets. I returned to the scene. As you yourself have written in The Hound of Baskervilles, Doctor, remnants remain, even when papers appear to be thoroughly destroyed. That villain was willing to wait, torturing his victims with fear of disclosure, until the time proved right.”
"Why thank you, as always, for your expert literary commentary. I think these newer ones are doing quite well."
“And you are not obnoxious beyond redemption.”
"Different me, you said."
“Depends on how well you play.”
If you
“Aha! Gotcha!”
Oh. John was… disappointed. Something in him was already very intrigued by the thought of maring that perfect skin in some manner. But they could always explore that another time. Something simpler. Maybe just tying Sherlock to the headboard. Though he’d likely escape. But not without a struggle. Now,
"Well then, if it isn't even another Sherlock's John, why does he matter? Might as well be some other random person."
I handed them each to him in sequence.
“Yeah?” John said. It was a way to sometimes get a better angle. Give him just a half-inch more, if he could get the positioning right. “You want to try that? Ok. We can. It might not make much of a difference, but, we could try to—“
John had been working on the theory that his self was here on some sort of medical conference. He’d recalled several over the years, one hotel was indistinguishable from another… large, carefully-neutral conference rooms with crystal chandeliers meant to somehow add elegance to any situation, and the thermostat was always set just a bit too warm. He asked his preself if that was why he was at this particular hotel. This new John looked shocked.
“Shouldn't we go stop them? In those universes, I mean?” asked John.
Sherlock’s eyes lost a bit of that glazed-over look as he pulled himself up to sitting. “Yes, yes, I’ll be sure to do that. Right now I need to check on something. I'll be back in a moment, John.”
“He says it’s not Covid, and that you are the only one who can help him.”
For those blind to his art, and to his scope,
“Your younger brother.” It isn’t a question.
“Oh. Thanks.”
“I do not suggest you fabricate a courtship. And I do not think it offensive if you were to occasionally mention a woman, without any description, nor commentary as to how you met. Then, within the reader's mind, it will seem as if a woman has always been there, will always be there, in the background of the stories. Simply say something regarding a wife on occasion. Casually. It will be quite effective. Some will assume you have remarried. Others will assume it is Mary of whom you speak. You have already confessed to your readers your need to occasionally change dates, so you needn't concern yourself with accuracy or details. You will have a permanent woman beside you."
“Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay? Why don't you ask him if he's going away? I saw them live at Oyster Bay, you know. How are those tenders, Johnny?”
Damn. This John thought they were just… associates… didn't he? This John knew nothing about Sherlock, or of their partnership in the broader sense and, well... He let out an involuntary, despondent huff of air.
Sherlock grimaced.
No one wants anything to do with a forensic investigator
“To have an excuse to be naked on my bed, yes. Of course, I needed to make a few observations first before proceeding with the plan, but I was fairly confident as to what I might see.”
"It was nothing."
“You’re not quite me.”
“That bastard. He’s faking it. He’s fu-- he’s faking it. That’s why he made me stay away. That’s why he wanted Smith alone. He’s trying to get a bragger’s confession.” I stomped up toward the door. “That ain’t gonna hold up in court, Holmes!”
I had been staring straight at my brother’s heart.
"He was quite tanned. From daily swims. It...he reminded me of you. You still are... not quite as brown as a nut, but, shall we say, a pleasing shade, nonetheless. He was of a roughly similar build, as well. Not as muscular as a former army man and rugby player such as yourself. But the closest substitute I could find."
"And you can't?" Sherlock snapped.
Another dull morning of strep throats and flu symptoms, followed by a few health exams for school sports; it was that time of year. It was well past noon with no texts from Sherlock.
I never
“Take your time. No need to explain,” he said. “It ain't like I’ve got many customers right now.”
And if you haven't read Billy Collins, or think poetry inaccessible, go pick up one of his books ASAP.
John’s preself glared at him and climbed onto the bed. John slid out from beneath Sherlock and repositioned himself behind him. “I’m sure as hell not gonna be kicked off,” he said, and began to kiss his way down his spine. Sherlock threw his head back and gasped. “Just a change of angle, is all.”
"Sorry, but... thrice. Note that I only state this for the sake of accuracy."
“Hah!”
“Stolen.”
Both Sherlocks stared blankly at him.
"Fine. You proved your point. I should know better than to doubt you. It just seemed....rather over-specific. I mean the aging kids, the divorce, sure... I can see how you got those. Sort of." John looked at the woman some more as she faded back into the holiday crowds. "Maybe."
"Well, I tried to delay the possibility by becoming more competent, but given that he," Sherlock gestured disdainfully at his preself, "never even thought of me as remotely capable of the emotional and physical demands of a relationship, I --"
Sherlock’s lips twitched. He regretted ever having discussed John with his preself, even if the conversation hadn't exactly been a voluntary one on his part. This version of him was perhaps fine alone. Or, would have been. He was, in fact, so busy contemplating a version of a Sherlock Holmes who would never meet a John Watson that he realised there was a far more important element of the conversation which had nearly passed him by.
“Spy on you?”
"He thinks you are exaggerating your injuries."
They lay quietly, just breathing, before Sherlock finally looked down with a bit of displeasure at the sticky mess plastered to the hairs on his stomach.
Yes, I am like to one now filled with hope,
“Only when I have messed things up so badly that I genuinely have no idea what to do next to remedy an irremediable situation. Boswell may well have told us Johnson called patriotism the last refuge of the scoundrel, but truly humour is the last refuge of the idiot.”
“--But I think, maybe you should come and see Mr. H.”
"It’s 'To Make Much of Time', actually. 'To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time'." He corrected me, and then grew quiet, as if reconsidering whether having done so had been a proper gesture. This concerned me, for it was not so like my Holmes. I wished him to know I took no offense. "Marvell?" I asked, attempting to convey a degree of casualness in my tone.
"Apparently."
I can, John”
“You think this is a different world,” John continued. “That you somehow made the right choices, and are leading some sort of better life. That I made a wrong turn. A different world, right? So different that we have nothing in common. But I know me.” He stopped, drawing in a sharp intake of breath through his nose. “I really, really know me. So that means, I know you too.”
"What I said was I w-- never mind. And I'm not John II; if anything, I'm John I and

"Well, as far as the scientific process, yes. Your romantic additions are far less critical."
“It won’t be easy, Watson. He doesn’t like me. I know him from an investigation. He was the suspect. In the death of his nephew. He might not want to help me, but you’ll make him come, won't you? You’ll make him break the stay-at-home and come here?”
So in these thoughts myself close to despising,
“No, no, no, it’s--” He stopped for a moment, as if he had forgotten what he was about to say. “It’s not Covid-19. It isn’t any form of Corona or Influenza. This is...different.”
“I saw a graphic online. Well done one. Anyway, it said if you are trying to prevent World War II by killing Hitler--”
"Just trying to find more pleasant memories to bring up than talking about Harry's drinking and Dad's--"
“It is lighting up on the screen as if there is a way out of this universe, but I see no indication of where the exit it is, or of it going anywhere in particular. The window we came through led here. There has never been multiple exit or entrance points unless they were deliberately created by someone.  My best guess is that one is a temporary anomaly which appears to lead… nowhere. If we can find it we can dispose of the bomb entirely.”
This newer John looked at him like he was an imbecile. “I don’t mean travel to other cities or countries. I mean travel through time. Be a traveller. I admit I ...don't know a lot about that stuff, and so few are allowed to do it. That you...that I... did is… well I must be doing something very important. Do I go back into the military? Am I working for the government? Don’t worry. I won't make any weird choices if I’m important enough to travel! Bet you can’t talk about it. That’s fine. Sorry I asked.”
“Donneedto,” said Sherlock into his pillow. “Frshpaint.”
“It is not so much my needing someone as my brother is convinced I am too distractable to run a household. My habits are, irregular. Yours are far from it.”
"Waxing poetic? To think, I once imagined you ignorant of such things. We shall have to propose a toast with our supper. Perhaps, 'To the Virgins Who Make Much of Time'.
“I know.”
Sherlock simply blinked, attempting to make a connection where there was none.
“Yeah.” I sat down. “What about the glassy eyes? Visine?”
“Yes. Right. You never do something stupid because you are trying to... well…”
“American pilot, returning from a brief holiday.”
"At least you took my advice to heart when it came time to record the account of your female cyclist. Changing the facts in the client's best interest is no vice."
John’s preself was pacing restlessly til he found a pen and hotel notepad and began to jot down a crude diagram of the rooms and hallway. “You believe he’s on this floor. The elevators are here. The stairs at the end of the hall, and another set at the far end. The ice machine is...here...and the snack area is in...where is the concierge room?”
“Yes, well--” The preself crossed the room at an overly-quick pace to end up at the curtains, which he threw open to reveal not a view of the street, but a larger series of buttons and dials. He checked them a few times, flipped a switch, and then finished his sentence by indicating the window with a flourish and saying, “--shall we?”
“For now. Someone wants to know what we plan to do next. They are giving us time to think,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock came back a few minutes later, his crisp white shirt perfectly pressed. He sat on the edge of his chair, his back perfectly straight in rigid anticipation. He began tapping out an expectant beat on his knees, waiting in bated excitement for Lestrade to arrive. A few minutes passed and when they heard Lestrade’s car pull up outside it took all of Sherlock’s strength not to jump up and race downstairs to greet him. Instead he leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees, foot tapping rapidly on the floor, as they listened as Mrs. Hudson let Lestrade in downstairs.
“They’re just, well, I wanted to know how different organs would react to fire after being exposed to various extraneous conditions,” he said, walking towards the table, gesturing to the equipment, “So I’ve set up an experiment where I-” John held up his hand to stop him, knowing that Sherlock would go on for hours if he let him.
“John that’s cheating,” said Molly, “Sherlock has to pick out his own present.”
“You boys have done so much for me, and I’m not your house keeper, so stop asking for tea and biscuits, but I wanted to do something nice for you.” John smiled faintly, unsure if he wanted to hug her or send her out so he could set the sweater on fire without hurting her feelings. Based on his own internal battle he was terrified of how Sherlock would react. But before he could loudly change the subject to avoid Sherlock’s inevitably rude response Sherlock set his sweater down and stood, looking Mrs. Hudson in the eye. John took a deep breath and braced himself.
“You.”
John took the gift and pulled on the end of the ribbon, untying the bow. He tore open the wrapping paper and found a picture frame containing a picture of him and Sherlock that had been taken only a little while after they met. In it John was looking straight at the camera and smiling, but Sherlock was looking over at John. It was a picture John hadn’t seen in a while, but looking at it now he could suddenly see the love that Sherlock was looking at him with in a way he hadn’t seen when the picture was taken. There was a pure longing and adoration in Sherlock’s eyes that he couldn’t believe he hadn’t noticed before.
“Doing what?”
John turned to face Sherlock, who slept peacefully beside him. John could see his eyes flickering behind his eyelids as he dreamt, but otherwise he was entirely still, he chest barely rising and falling with his breath. The early morning light and the shadows that remained from the night before played off the curves and lines of his face, making him look almost like a fairy tale character. John resisted the urge to kiss him and wake him from his slumber.
Sherlock opened the door wide just before they knocked. John already figured Sherlock— well, make that both Sherlocks— had likely heard their steps in the hallway, despite the carpeting, or maybe Sherlock knew his stride well enough to time it precisely from the lounge up to the room... but John’s preself’s mouth gaped as he watched the door swing open with John’s fist left hovering in the air inches in front of the surface. “Yeah, they’re always like that,” John said by way of explanation.
And with that, John took off his jumper with a dramatic flourish, then his shirt and  trousers, which he flung to the floor, and finally his pants.

, would you? There’s a good man. Oh, and
"For ineffable twaddle."
Sherlock's preself smiled a tad too broadly. "Apologies, John II."
“And some where you hate each other,” Sherlock interrupted, giving a sharp nod.
“He did have good suggestions, but I don’t see how that makes him right and you wrong. Unless we’ve moved beyond discussing the bomb. Did we...have we shifted topics, John?”
saving
The thought that any reader might conceivably stumble upon such an error— or still worse, think that I had somehow forgotten the dates which encompassed that dreadful time forever etched upon my mind— vexed me. That Holmes had found it quite amusing did little to quell my anger at myself. Doyle (my aforementioned editor) insisted no one would scour my stories for synchronicity, but rather would simply read them as the romantic, adventurous entertainment they were and give the matter little serious thought. I am mostly certain he meant well, but the comment was... disappointing. Implying my work was little more than drivel made me think he and the laughing Holmes had far more in common than either man would care to admit.
John sidestepped the experiment and threw some leftover rice and paneer in the microwave. He was hungry and had little patience for this conversation on an empty stomach. Sherlock glared as he walked past with his plate. He wasn’t going to put food down on the kitchen table. That was long since off limits. He grabbed a tray and angled his chair toward the kitchen.  “Everything okay?”
John turned toward his own preself. “Don’t.”
“And 3C had to be Three Continents. Which I am confident include Europe and Asia, but the third is still beyond certainty. I was initially inclined to think Oceania, but a strong case could be made for—”
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
“Wait?” said John, “What do you mean wait? We have less than three minutes!”
“There is far too much argument in official sources about what exactly causes the reaction. I wish to have a more definitive answer. After which, I will publish my results in a small monograph on my blog, cross reference it to a few of the more popular websites, and then delete the information from my mind palace. I can’t clutter my hard drive with unnecessary facts about toothpaste.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to do it, but I just wanted to try something different. And I hope you don’t mind. Or feel threatened in any way.”
Sherlock looked at his preself, and then at John’s, and began to say ‘of course,’ before finding he was moaning instead— low, long and unmistakably masculine; John had gotten impatient and begun the process himself. Sherlock began a few delicate advances forward, then more steady thrusts.
“Oh! I figured you…”
The man forces himself to stop grimacing at the nearly pristine issue of Cosmopolitan he holds (clearly the original purchaser from the previous flight hadn’t thought much of it either and had tucked it, more or less unread, behind the safety instruction card) and turns toward his seatmate. “Hi,” he responds. The voiced glottal fricative is extended just long enough to demonstrate the proper amount of disdain for this sudden burst of...friendliness.
Good.
“Too lucky. It was almost as if it was designed to be ridiculously easy to shut down. Random luck? More likely a set up from whoever gave Moran the weapon to begin with. I think it probable we were being observed, like when Magnussen was checking for pressure points. Maybe whoever it was behind it wanted to see what would happen if we thought we might die, but then carried on living. Sounds like a rather interesting experiment, doesn’t it? I cannot be certain who it was, or if it was done for that purpose, but it was the simplest switch ever. A child could have disarmed it. Of course, if someone had put it in place to observe what we might have meant to each other back then, they would have no reason to do so now. What we mean to each other is clear for all to see. This—does not bode well for their being an off switch this time, John.”
The only issue at hand was, were they truly meant for Sherlock’s own sake, or were they meant to be delivered to someone else? If so, they would be gone by the end of the day. A wilted bouquet sent a message all its own, after all. I had to see if they were still there in the morning. If they were gone, they had been meant to warn another. I was not sure which scenario was the better one. To send such a bouquet could only be a firm response to some inquiry, but one item of singular importance was missing from the message if it was to be a reply. There had been no variegated carnations,whuch would indicate a firm “no”. Indeed, it  was a bouquet filled with warnings, reasons it wasn’t feasible, and advice, but it lacked rejection.
Sherlock’s preself chuckled. “Is that what you’ve been waiting for? Someone to take the decision out of your hands?”
then wipe their hands on their clothes.
“Yes,” both Sherlocks responded simultaneously, then both looked embarrassed for having done so and turned away from each other.
“Suit yourself,” said John. “I’m going to get some supplies. Back in a minute.”
“Why?”
I was wrong.
When Sherlock gave the ok, John carried him up the stairs and was about to carry him over the threshold, bridal style, when Sherlock insisted on being put down. His voice was quiet, but determined. John did so as gently as possible. “Thank you,” Sherlock said, his cheeks slightly flushed.
Sherlock’s preself looked as if he was seriously considering everything John's preself had just said, but when he spoke, it showed that it had been half-hearted. “Do you think there will be an alarm to simply pull?”
On the fifth floor, an impatient Lord Moran pushed the button once more, but the elevator was taking a bit too long. It was still on the first floor. He exited the building by the stairs on his right, trying to hold the briefcase as if it didn't contain a remote linked to explosives. A quick check to see if everything was in place at Sumatra Station, and then he’d head back to their room and wait for the agreed upon time.
The sparseness of the hotel felt all wrong. I sat down at the minibar and enjoyed my pancakes. Then I brushed my teeth, peed, slipped off my sweatpants and left them in a pile on the bathroom floor (my scrubs stayed at the hospital, tossed into the hazmat laundry hamper before I changed in the locker room and made my way here). I went to bed. Holmes was right about those sheets. He’d just be starting his day right about now. I fluffed up my down pillow, rolled on my side, and did what I usually did when I found myself thinking about Holmes a bit too long. I called Omare.
“No of—“
in a fiery
"Absolutely."

“That thing you were saying, about on my side with my the leg out and… all that…?”
John: She said it was the World's Smallest Skyscraper. It's not exactly scraping the sky now, is it?
Sherlock was still testy today. Must be something wrong with the case.
Sherlock glanced over to his preself, hesitant. Sherlock’s preself walked up to the edge of the bed and ran his hand softly alongside Sherlock’s face, gently tilting his head back to give him a soft kiss. “Go on. Let yourself.” Sherlock looked at him, wide-eyed for a brief moment, then nodded with newfound confidence.
John tried his best to rein in his anger. “And risk having the station and everything above it blown to smithereens? Are you insane?”
For a second, I had thought he was going to say it was me. That one man. But I got back to reality real quick. I nodded. “Absolutely.”
“What makes you...why would you think I’m texting her about you?”
The door was partly ajar, and it creaked ever so slightly as John pushed it open.

"I... wasn't certain it had even happened, meeting another me and being somehow entirely unaware of it. That she wasn't just crazy. Crazy is notoriously difficult to distinguish from truthful, as you well know-- both believe what they are saying with all their heart-- so I wanted proof. She showed me how to bring the memories back. Later, when I returned home, I confirmed the events she had helped me access-- by the state of my bedroom." He turned the top corner of his mouth up, in what was almost, but not quite, a smile, and faced John. "We are supposed to meet sometime after Lestrade saves my life." He turned toward Sherlock next. "You can safely tell me exactly where and when, you know."
“Yes! Change! Do you have any? You’ll need change. Pennies. Copper is resistant to pathogens. Do you have any pennies?”
“Yes, I will join you.” He put on his coat and made his way to the door. “Oh. I should bring a few things.” He grabbed a black leather satchel in what seemed a lot like an afterthought.
"You were expecting something closer to Eastbourne?"
I must admit this bristled. I was certainly worthy of anyone’s trust. for what reason would he not? But then again, perhaps my brother and I shared more than our interest in puzzles and our less-than-favorable facial features. I do not toss about terms like “soulmate” lightly, but I felt I had one in my dear left-handed lady. There was something between us that was undefinable. Her brilliant eyes, her lovely hair, but above all, that compassionate and courageous heart. She and I had a certain unspoken trust. A trust that I had not felt from anyone else in this world. My mother… my mother had also been a woman of great compassion and courage, but I had had to let her go. I was prepared to let Lady Cecily go as well. Not into the arms of the horrid Bramwell in forced matrimony, but to go towards whatever her future genuinely held for her. I would always make sure I had that distance, that ability to let her go. To be as free as she needed to be. As free as my mother. As free as myself.
John paced the length of the hotel room. “It's not fine! Moran is still absolutely free, and he'll make another bomb if he damn well wants to. And apparently someone set it all up just to watch us put on a show. And might do it again. It's not fine that this universe turns out different, and it's not fine that he gets away with it, and… and none of this is fine.”
“I’m sorry, I just--”
until they go to talk to him,
“These last three days he’s just been sinkin’, and I finally told him, ‘that’s it, time to go to the doctor’s.’ This morning, I could see the bones practically stickin’ out of his face and he said they’ll turn him away anyways, but I really don’t think they’re gonna. I swear he looked like he-- Well, I told him if he didn’t go see a doctor I’d call an ambulance and they'd just drag him outta there. And that’s when he said he’d see you. Told me to call around 9. Told me to say he was sorry to cut short your sleep--”
————————————————————————————————————————————————-
Holmes began to read aloud. "'I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery.'"
“Crystal,” said Sherlock, his voice cracking just slightly, though he tried his best to conceal it.
Sherlock nods his encouragement. “Go on.”
Sherlock's preself snickered.
"Ah! Now that was a brilliant work of fiction, I must admit."
“So you stole—”
I have eaten
“Nearly thirteen,” he said.
Sherlock looked up at John as if to say something, and decided against it. John read the expression as ‘later’, and Sherlock gave his thigh a brief squeeze.
In retrospect, it seemed obvious. Of course he knew flower codes. He knew all manner of codes. All sorts of secret messages. He was far too good a detective to remain ignorant of any method of clandestine communication.
“Impress someone. You were trying to impress me.”
"Well, there is a John Watson here. In this hotel. My John is going to find out why he happens to be here at this precise moment."
“Ah, still yourself enough for that, so that’s something. Thirteen or so hours treating infectious patients. Do you think, for one second, that I am not going to have a look at you because I am worried about my own health?” It hurt, honestly. It hurt and I let him know it hurt. “You are sick. You need care. And I’ll do right by you. As your doctor, and as your friend.”
John stripped, folded his clothes neatly, and placed them on Sherlock’s chair. He all but leaped into bed. Lying flat on his back, John found he had next to no preparation needed. A stroke or two with some lube from the bedside table and he was hard as a rock. Would Sherlock like some pillows for his knees? He tried to remember the last time he had done this; had she wanted pillows? He didn’t think so, but placed them on either side of his hips, just in case.
“Hey. Didn’t you want to wake up for the tide?”
"I suppose that Sherlock...the Sherlocks...know where we are. Or will soon. We could probably just wait here for them to find us, but that's not exactly my style and it's a safe bet it isn't yours either."
“You... faked getting shot...to...”
Sherlock shrugged. "Possibly."
Lestrade began a fit of coughing. We remained respectfully silent.
“Black Travelpro suitcase, American flight industry standard, but not a pilot’s case, so not business-related. And of course there is the lack of a uniform, so returning from a pleasure trip. Confirming the profession, suggesting the country.”
“Look, it’s nothing personal, okay? I… I don’t know where to begin.”
"That doesn't mean I can't relate. It... Well, it didn't go quite the way I portrayed it."
"You think that's what they are after?" Sherlock’s preself angled his head towards Sherlock and John who were several paces ahead by now.
“Test case. To know if it is possible. I am far from certain. I want to understand every nuance of how travelling works. As I have nothing tethering me here, I want to be able to explore different dimensions, and if I happen to see something that isn't quite right, I want to know if I can fix it or if all my efforts-- no matter how well thought out and complex-- will still prove futile. This is an experiment. And one in which I do not wish to participate; my purpose would be to observe.”
“To the docks. Said somethin’ ‘bout tracking a shipment. He wore his mask when he left, I know that.”
Sherlock lay back on the sofa and alternated between the file and his laptop for the next few hours. Back and forth, not uttering a word.
John laughed darkly. “We put a bomb into some portal and it’s someone else's problem and they’ve got three minutes to deal with it? If anyone even spots it in time?”
"Why? He makes me think about our respective journeys to this point. It's not as if you have any reason to be envious of a younger version of you."
Your Currently-Much--Younger Brother,
“Honestly, John, for someone who has had sexual experiences on three separate continents—”
“Yes you are, come on,” John said nudging him with his foot under the table.
“Ok, great, I’m so glad,” she said, nervously clasping her hands in her lap. Mrs. Hudson smiled turned to Mycroft, who looked entirely unsurprised to be handed a gift by her. He took the gift she handed him with a smile and delicately untied the bow and removed the wrapping, careful not tear the paper. Inside was a glass paperweight with the words Shut Up engraved on the top. “I know how fond you are of the phrase,” Mrs. Hudson said.
“Ok, fine. I’ll say…ummm…’Mycroft’. That ought to kill the mood.”
Sherlock turns back toward the window.  He isn’t particularly good at family dynamics. “I’ve been assured I’m the irresponsible one,” he mutters. Whatever John Watson texted Harry Watson about him, knowing isn’t worth being dragged into some sibling drama.
"When you lose an old love, you return to an even older one...in her case, music. The notion of children are supported by the items she was purchasing."
Sherlock’s preself opened the door and rushed to one side as John nearly shoved him out of the way.
"Look. I got this last year when I w--," the preself looked a bit embarrassed, but continued on, "I got this last year. You don't have it, do you?" The preself presented a small, jagged scar on the fleshy heel of his palm. "You don't have it, on my own body, in the future. Why? Because are not the same. We exist on parallel planes. I'm not the past you. I know that has been, and will continue to be, the prevailing theory-- but I talked to Dr Weise, and it is wrong. Piecroft and all the Little Piggies...they are wrong. All that monitoring-- worrying about nothing. I'm not at all surprised you tend toward solipsism, but Sherlock Holmes is not the Center of the Universe. There are some worlds that don't have a form of us in them at all." He stared at Sherlock, not breaking eye contact for so much as a blink. "There are some where you two never meet. Some where you hate each other."
"Well, it doesn't look like it from our perspective, of course. We aren't them. Oh, but I see what you mean. If I am him. Well, even if we have some sort of common drive, it isn't what I want. I wonder why I gave up on something more? I was a soldier. Must have had something to do with it. Men going too long without women." John's preself was lost in thought.
“I see.”
“Proving or disproving this particular theory is crucial for the security of everyone’s future. If we can come into a timeline, essentially as intruders, and force a diversion, we know we can change any outcome! Think how valuable that information is!”
Sherlock rolled over again and dug his head into John’s shoulder. John wrapoed him in the blanket which had somehow found its way to the end table, and reached for his pants. “Please don’t mention her again, as I will likely come to my senses in a few minutes and will likely be disgusted at the possibility.”
Why, then there would be a line, would there not? A line too fraught with peril to risk the crossing? What to gain and what to lose. That was a dangerous love indeed.
“If he comes back to check on us, I’ll take the old guy and tackle him, and… really, I should disarm the bomb while you take on Sebastian. You know more... fighting stuff.”
"My younger self is a sheltered idiot."

"Shall I have one for you as well?"
“We’ll need a safeword.”
"Yes."
"Right. When I am grey and feeble and we... fight the forces of evil as old men. Hobbling through the streets of London after criminals."
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, for several years. Pick something else.”
“Well it’s not as if your fellow fusiliers are good at keeping secrets. Your conversations are plastered all over the internet. And even if they weren’t, don’t you think that the comment from Murray about ‘3CW finally settling down’ was obvious enough? W is clearly you.”
John straightens himself, gaining a few inches of height in the process, cocks his head and looks Sherlock directly in the eyes. “Look. I don’t know who the hell you are, but you can come clean of it right now. She put you up to this?”
“Just...wait...please.”
I’m not alone inside my outcast state,
“We might not have to worry about any of this. It might have a switch,” John replied.
"I deduced it. I don't exactly make a habit of keeping glycerine in my bedroom. And the sheets were quite the mess. There is a thin line between the impossible and the highly improbable. The lack of physical discomfort indicated that we had likely only...."
, rather? I doubted it. It seemed far more likely to be what Sherlock had alluded to this morning...something that wasn’t suitable for the pages of The Strand.
"I had no idea you reread any of it! I thought you couldn't be troubled to read them even a first time!"
"And it is beyond their comprehension that I just might have received
Know the room?
"And this one?"
Sherlock yawned, shifted out of the wet spot on the mattress, and drifted off to sleep, taking a moment to wrap John’s arm around his side and up toward his chest.
“That was amazing. It’s rather indulgent, sitting back and letting you do a bit more of the work, eh? Different, but not so different. I hope you feel more comfortable now bringing up any other ideas.”
"Lord Moran? The one who wanted to blow up Parliament?" asked John.
"And she forced you to study time travel, did she?"
top.”
“They seem a tad chaotic, is all.” I turned toward the sitting room proper. There were scattered books everywhere and an abandoned chemistry experiment disgraced the breakfast table. “As do all your rooms, I suppose.”
“Maybe a bit overprotective, but you get yourself into so much trouble in the pursuit of a case. But beyond that, you are beautiful.”
His preself cleaned up fairly well, but Sherlock could easily see it was a fairly new thing for him-- the concern with outward appearance. The suit had been a gift from Mycroft. His brother had asked him to attend an important banquet to assess who might be selling state secrets, and Sherlock had protested that he could not possibly attend, having no appropriate clothing to blend in with the crowd. Which was true. Sweatpants and inside out t-shirts had been his standard fare up until that point-- dressing entirely for comfort. Well, soon after he had needed money. And with that came obtaining work. And with that came the requirement of cultivating a certain image. Still, showing up to assist Mycroft wearing something less-than-professional had guaranteed him a brand new set of clothing. At first, it was simply a way to serve a dual purpose of annoying his brother and scoring an expensive suit for free, but soon he would discover just how differently he’d be treated when he didn't look like the ex-junkie he actually was. After that he wouldn't be caught leaving the flat without a suit.
“Okay. Should we do some sort of code thing? If we see him?”
Your partnership has endured, and that it should continue to do so is my fervent wish. Truly, I cannot see one of you thriving without the other by his side. A symbolic acknowledgement of this fact is more appropriate than any of the pomp to which I am a near-daily witness. It was already inevitable. Whether you have met my own standards of approval or not (though you have) is inconsequential.
swollen
“Don’t.”
John leaned forward, still standing over the bed, and kissed him. A bit of reassurance, because for all Sherlock’s confidence, there was still an easily observable layer of doubt beneath it. The kiss was soft, gentle, tender. For all the strength John liked to project, all the confidence he had worked so hard to cultivate, all the bluster, there was an even greater tenderness beneath it. He truly, truly loved this man. Loved him with every bit of himself. After all, John had killed for Sherlock; Sherlock had died for John. He broke the kiss, smiling as Sherlock’s mouth chased his ever so slightly, his head rising off the pillow. John stroked his hair. Then he waited.  Waited to see what part of Sherlock’s body moved next, got just a bit restless, felt just a bit of longing.
"I was considering the possibility. I thought understanding how you and John make things work might be helpful, and, I could perhaps see if there were any--,” he cleared his throat. "If there was any sexual act I found appealing in and of itself. Not merely in the vicarious sense."
Sherlock was waiting at the lift down the hallway, and returned his mobile to his coat pocket just as saw his counterpart arrive. He had already hit the fifth floor button. "Concierge level. Five...?"
“Because…. Because…. Because he is too damn happy about it, that's why! Because the other me thinks that I’m the wrong outcome and he's the right one and we diverged because I made... bad choices. That’s why!”
She looked closely at the man, and his companion close at his side, waiting for another piece of divinely-sourced advice, but there was nothing more-- save a quick and somewhat artificial grinch at lasted a tad too long. She turned somewhat awkwardly and walked away, though now with a definitely lighter step.
My belly
“Someone like that would have made their presence known in every dimension, including ours. Plus, a delicate balance where each leaves the other alone and has their own world to dominate? Unlikely to the point of impossible.”
Sherlock threw his head back with a bit of disdain, but clearly still processing, and that’s when John caught sight of that neck, just waiting to be explored. He abandoned Sherlock’s nipples, leaving them peaked and wanting, and started on that vast expanse of pale neck. And if that didn’t do the trick!  Sherlock arched beneath him, seeking out John’s thigh with such determination to get that blessed friction for himself that John decided not quite yet and moved it away. He pinned Sherlock’s legs down with his own, and raised his hips up to create a frustrating gap between their bodies.
you to,” he croaked. “Isn’t that enough?”
“Well, some Johns are obviously more important than other Johns when it comes to altering the course of history. We needed your John at Sumatra, not captured because he decided to chase after the less important one.”
"Another blue-eyed blonde? Which one are you pulling out of the ol’ memory bank for the sake of conversation?"
John rushed in beside him as the two of them attempted to jostle the framework. It shifted.
"Discovering new things is part of the adventure. John and I are always learning together. And, for what it's worth, I do believe you. You are not me. Though, it's close enough that that fact hardly matters." He cleared his throat. "So, tell me more about Lord Moran."

It was far from the first time they had shared a laugh at my expense. Many readers might think Holmes lacked anything as deeply humanising as humour, and I confess to encouraging that misconception. If ever there were a singular selfish action of mine it was not in my abandoning him for a wife-- for one could scarcely say I had abandoned him during those years, no matter what Holmes claimed during his brief foray into storytelling. Mary's time within this Earthly realm was cut short, but she always was amenable to the many hours, days, sometimes weeks I spent with Holmes. Not... in any overtly romantic sense. I was not yet aware myself of the depths of my attraction to him (though in hindsight I strongly suspect
“Yes,” he responded, frowning. “But your confidence is misplaced. They very well might have existed.”
And if he would head towards me,
“Sounds like something I could be saying just as easily.” He finds himself smiling yet again. Must be some sort of record.
“So, we are both visiting another universe? Is a third incarnation of me in the loo, or are we just dimension-sitting for him while he goes on holiday? Gathering the post? Watering the plants, which of course I am aware there are none, because this is exactly the same flat I had in 1995.”
however you regenerate from season to season,
"And if there isn't?" John's preself said, approaching them from behind.
"If you take the first note of each series of sixteenth notes and simply repeat it, the conductor might not even notice."
John grimaced. He couldn’t hit quite the right angle, nor could he see Sherlock’s face at all, but he kept his rhythm steady.
“Fifteen minutes. And I know you are not a sociopath. The last thing a sociopath would do is tell you he’s a sociopath. Or apologize for startling me before. And another thing a sociopath would never do is help someone voluntarily for nothing in return.”
John was grateful his preself couldn't see his face. "What makes you say that?"
"Tell him to sod off."
The preself rolled his eyes and sighed. "Fine. I know you were already a detective when you met him." He glanced at John. "You must have chosen him-- initially, I mean-- because he was useful. Or are you going to try and convince me the heavens parted and a ray of light shone upon his face--"
“Fine. Fine. If you can take me in a fight, you can…take me…in a fight.”
"Why would I want to do that? I'd just be starting something I wouldn't want to finish."
“Sounds interesting.”
or retrieving a stick from a lake.
John kept a bag filled with emergency supplies tucked between the sofa and the wall. For some reason, he had always pictured himself providing first aid on the sofa, should the time come. And he always knew it would eventually.
John moved closer to Sherlock's preself. "You didn't think I existed?"
Doctor Watson had been correct in his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes as a machine. How could a machine ever understand my need for freedom? To not spend my days married off to some gentleman deemed “pleasant enough”? If I should have a child, would I have plotted to leave her, as my own mother had left me, unable to bear that yoke? I was fighting not just for mysel, but on behalf of the daughter I might someday have. Whom I might someday abandon. What would protect me from that fate, aside from a firm determination to remain...alone?
Both Sherlock and John remained silent.
"Your cryptic nature is difficult to bear under normal circumstances, Holmes, but tonight it is maddening. Out with it, man!" I smiled and hoped I had tempered my irritation with affection.
Sherlock's preself frowned. “Yes. I suppose the plan still remains the same. But it would help strategically to know at what point the timelines diverge and the history changes. Then you'll know it's all new from that point forward.”
“Not needed then.” John flung them aside. “I mean, I guess it’s overkill, but I just wanted you to be comfortable.”
“And what exactly do you intend to do while we work something out? Rent a room and watch telly on the bed?”
without even wrinkling the conversation.
Sherlock was silent as John continued. "So, here, in your Universe--"
I was so much more than just an ordinary girl. And, furthermore, any girl was, or rather, could be, so much more than ordinary. Sherlock may dismiss women's emotions, intuition, even insight as puzzling or too inconsequential to be worth the effort, but I was just as capable of logical thought as he. There was, in fact, much I could instruct him upon, if given the chance. Such as...such as his flowers, for example! My brain struggled to retrieve the word I wished to use to describe them. All I could find was “ridiculous”, though there was a far better one I sought. A word I had once heard my grandmother, Hadassah, use to express her disappointment in my sole attempt at quilting. It had sounded odd, and though I was young I believed it to be no true English word, yet certainly no curse. Mother frowned when I attempted to use it myself, and I had long since forgotten it. Seeing the arrangement nearly brought it forth from its dusty crevice within my own brain attic, and I found myself saddened at the loss.
“You shouldn’t do that,” said John, “it’s bad for your teeth.”
“I don’t mind going first,” John said. Everyone nodded and John held out his gift. “This is for you,” he said to Molly. Molly smiled and took the gift. Sherlock nodded as if he had expected that.
John nodded, turning over what Sherlock had said in his mind. “So, saying it doesn’t change anything, but actually being in love does?”
“Which is fine,” said Sherlock, “because I won’t be participating.”
“Me? Mean?” said Sherlock said in a tone of mock offense. He pressed a shocked hand to his chest.
“I am not going ice skating,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms defiantly and plunking down into his chair.
When their meal came they ate it quickly, not wanting to be late, and left, walking to the cinema a few blocks away. Sherlock had insisted on buying tickets ahead of time so they wouldn’t have to stand in the queues, but John wanted popcorn, so they ended up waiting anyways. Sherlock tugged impatiently at John’s sleeve the entire time. “Good lord you are impatient,” John said, batting his hand away, then immediately wishing it was touching him again.
“You’ve gone through my search history?”
“I guess we are.” Lestrade nodded and went off the check in with the other investigators. They all worked in silence, John and Sherlock by the body, Lestrade, Anderson, and the other investigators examining the scene of the crime. Eventually Sherlock called Lestrade over to explain his theories and deductions and Lestrade nodded along, John scribbling his notes as Sherlock talked.
It is a fine and private place, Sherlock. But I will embrace you. In good time.
"My dear Watson, it is not I who am questioning you. Please direct your anger elsewhere, for it is soon to be further inflamed. Hand me your copy of
The preself cleared his throat. "That's...strange. Personally, I think your John would do well to stay away from him."
Well, maybe next time he’d have the courage to… well, there would be another opportunity. There had to be.
I rubbed my thumb against the smooth skin of his cheek, leaned forward slowly, kissed him softly. I knew not the degree of experience he had in such matters… whether the last time he had kissed anyone at all was poor old Agatha, or whether he and Stackhurst or McPherson, or even (and I dared not dwell upon this) the both of them, had done far more than even this simple act. It made no difference who it might have been, if anyone at all; all that mattered was that it had not been me. And my own experiences had not been with Holmes. It was not a question of throwing the book of my life upon the fire and rewriting it. It was merely a matter of writing a new chapter. And this we did, upon that night. I will not set an account down within these pages, as it is hardly necessary to reiterate how two people in love for many years might choose to express it. But let me merely suggest, express it we did.
“Well, it works for me. You are beautiful, and slight, and—”
"Well, until that future time, you two are better-equipped to handle the situation than I."
“Wow, that was amazing.”
"You forget, I did not contact Dr Weise, she contacted me."
“For now, we will assume congruence. Look for a grate on the right side," Sherlock instructed John. "We need to confirm that the train car is still there. The dangerous part is in finding it and checking the panel. Might not be an off switch this time."
It wasn’t far. They had walked to the bank earlier in the evening together, bundled against the chilly night air, Sherlock discussing everything short of the actual case. John knew he liked to keep secrets. Wait for the right moment for the big reveal. And that was fine. John had been keeping a few secrets of his own lately.
"I assure you there would be no negative outcomes to any scenario that crosses my mind as likely to occur."
It was clear the visit was off to a more inauspicious start than a romantic proposal made with those flowers, and this was no time to discuss my future. Sherlock paused some more, giving me a chance to rethink my position, to cool down my passions. Clearly he was far better at regulating them than I, for certainly our mother’s blood ran through both our veins. He rose to retrieve my cloak, blocking the garish flowers from view. “I thank you for your assistance in locating Dr Watson. Time was of the essence and, two heads were certainly better than one.” It was patronizing talk which served only to infuriate me. He extended his long arm to hold it out for me from some distance away, and I snatched it from his grasp.
“Ok, now set yours on top of mine,” said John, indicating to Sherlock’s ball of snow, “carefully, don’t drop it.”
Eventually John broke away, leaning his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder. “We really do need to get our groceries,” he said.
“No,” Sherlock said, barely blinking before he responded. John knew Sherlock hadn’t even gone over their schedule in his mind before responding and, when he laughed, Sherlock could feel John’s chest shaking slightly against his ribcage. He looked deeply into John’s eyes, a small grin playing across his face. John grinned back and licked his lips compulsively, eyes never leaving Sherlock’s.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked up at him for a second before rolling onto his side to make room for John. John lowered himself onto the couch, his back pressed against Sherlock so that they were both facing the fireplace across the room. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist and tucked his chin against John’s shoulder. “Should we open our presents now, or later?” he asked, looking over at the small stack of gifts that was sitting beneath their tree.
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise as he continued perusing the recipe. John pulled out the last of the ingredients and set them on the counter next to Sherlock. “Wait a minute,” Sherlock said, looking up from the directions, “the dough has to go in the refrigerator for two hours.”
“Well you were gazing longingly at my lap, I can only assume that you wanted to sit in it.”
“Yeah,” John called over his shoulder. Sherlock went into the kitchen to check on his experiments and John settled into his chair and opened his computer. He started typing away at yet another blog post and after a few minutes Sherlock came up behind him, gave him a kiss on the cheek, handed him a mug of tea, and sat down in his chair across from John. He picked up a book and began flipping through it and they settled once again into the quiet enjoyment of each other’s company. Just like the morning, the afternoon slipped by, the hours slowly dragging their feet as they marched by.
“Well, ok then,” he said, tightening his fingers around the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulling him in once again for another kiss, closing the gap between their mouths. It was a gap that stayed closed as they clumsily moved from the doorway to the couch, lowering from vertical to horizontal in one inelegant but passionate motion. Despite bumping knees and noses and elbows and ribcages, John and Sherlock never pulled away as the began whiling away the afternoon hours.
John raised an eyebrow at his expression. “If you think of something reasonable, let me know.” He went back to the kitchen and poured a can of chicken noodle soup into a pot on the stove. When it was heated he transferred the soup into two bowls and brought it, along with a chair, into the bedroom. He handed one of the bowls to Sherlock and positioned the chair in the corner furthest from Sherlock to avoid getting sick himself.
Late of the Army Medical Department
John: "What we have here is a failure to communicate."
“Like a sort of timeslip?”
It got quiet. Real quiet. I let it stay that way for a while longer. He still deserved to wait a bit.
"Seems to me like he will be too busy rescuing us."
Sherlock continued to glare at his preself. "I did not lie. Are you happy now? I told you John existed, and here he is. I know there is no pressing case. What do you want?"
Sherlock gave a noncommittal grunt as a pseudo-response, reached blindly for his mobile, then, in a startlingly abrupt shift of energy, was up in a flash and presumably headed back to Scotland Yard.

Later that evening, Holmes had leapt into his previous conversation without prelude. "And what of yourself? Your looks alone would see many a beautiful, young lady attempting to become the next Mrs Watson."
John: They never did get the lift to fit in. There's just a ladder to climb up to the top floor. Says they couldn't sue McMahon because the contract was valid. I bet he left town quick.
“Yeah.”

Sherlock had let out a fierce growl and ran toward the would-be-bank-robber, who had managed to discharge his firearm right into Sherlock’s left thigh before being knocked to the ground.
"No. That should be left as is. It had become a dangerous weight to bear and I...occasionally reread those passages, the one regarding the 'sleeping giant' in particular... as a reminder."
The driver turned to look at them both, his face hardening. He was going to say something about them not bleeding all over his cab, John knew, but he shot him a look that made the man think better of it. “Where to?” was all the cabbie actually said.
"I'm afraid not."
"And..?"
“Knew you wouldn’t fail me, Watson. You’d never. Never would. Would not. Could not.” As he closed his eyes and drifted off, I thought I heard him mutter quietly, “In the rain. No, the one about the stars. Read me the one about the stars,” and he made a half-waving motion before his arm collapsed of its own weight onto his hip, startling him to full alert. “Watson! You are here, and he is not. Did he not come?” He turned his head aside, eyes downcast, and simply said, “Oh.”
“Starving. A quick takeout from Sylvia’s might be in order, if you’d care to join me before you head back to the hotel to get some rest. You’re on in six hours.”
“That’s dreadful.”
The problem, however, remains: the magazine is boring beyond words. Hopefully this ex-military officer with the fading tan isn’t. Sliding the magazine back into its hiding place, his mind spares a moment to imagine the February issue making its clandestine way around the world before the inept British Airways cleaning crew notices its existence. He secretly roots for its emergence in New York, triumphant. A half-turn shift, and he is now facing the stranger.
“You’d like that, then?”
“That it never even occurred to you that was what I meant only seems to reinforce that notion.”
“Can you stand, or do I need to shoulder-carry you?”
Lestrade was weakening by the minute, but still maintained his faculties. That he’d asked for us was something of a surprise. The good inspector had long since retired, and one would expect his final moments spent amongst family, or perhaps closer friends than Holmes and myself.
The Gold King (real name: Neil Gibson) always seemed creepy to me. Reminded me of Crazy Eddie, the dude on those commercials back when I was a kid and we’d go visit my cousin in Minneola and watch TV all day long. You know, the one whose prices were
“Not going to decide to encourage that impulsivity by running off to the latrine and joining the Mile High Club? I’m joking, I’m joking,” he adds, hopefully before John has a chance to react. “I have no interest in that whatsoever.” After a few seconds, he adds, “Believe me,” in an attempt to sound more convincing, and then realises John will likely think he’s overstating his case. What a fine aeroplane ride this is turning out to be.
“I might.”
"Perhaps a few comments regarding the appreciation of a woman's features?"
“No, just…. just come with me.”
“Of course you are. It makes sense. For what it’s worth, I’m not much interested either. I mean, you are attractive, both of you,” he glanced at the Johns, “but...not exactly what I see in my future. No offense.”
What did I know about the workings of love? The great poets were always vexed; love never went according to plan. It all seemed rather doomed to me. A promise of torment. Those writers I had sought out from Mother’s collection, both poets and essayists, had spoken of women demanding marriage must mean friendship as well as passion, and love should encompass a certain degree of equality, so perhaps such things might be yet to come. I was rather in agreement with Edward Carpenter, who said all attachment was more or less the same. “We know, in fact, of Friendships so romantic in sentiment that they verge into love; we know of Loves so intellectual and spiritual that they hardly dwell in the sphere of Passion,” he had said. If I were to have a love, I should think it would be an intellectual one. But I had not yet had a love. I had had only had...an interest. A...curiosity, perhaps. A distraction. A beautiful woman like the Lady Cecily was fascinating in that she was all that I was not, effortlessly. Why should I not think of someone so lovely and so clever with a degree of admiration? But this was not about me! This was about my brother.
Beyond the attraction to Holmes I was furiously working on resolving, like many a widower I was angered by the implication that Mary was somehow replaceable. The heat of that rendered the compliment scarcely noticeable, and I do believe my thoughts on that front were clear as a bell, for Holmes appeared sullen and apologised. "My dear fellow, it was not my intention to imply anyone could replace your beloved wife. I am truly sorry."
"The odds are significantly in your favor that she will not care. The point is to create a "wall of sound", not to pick out individual notes, and, no offense, you've been told often enough that violas are filler."
A Write Sherlock entry, where you modify a famous work. This is my version of Billy Collins’s poem “To a Stranger Born in Some Distant Country Hundreds of Years from Now”  (his first… then my version.)
Such was the case with the messages which lay hidden within my deepest thoughts-- they had not yet made themselves known to me, but were struggling for recognition, until the clarity of that fateful day in Sussex. I often wonder if clarity of the air is somehow linked to clarity of the mind. Perhaps that is why, when living in London, everything had seemed so murky. A polluted haze of emotion.
“Exactly.”
"Does require a bit of specialized knowledge, I'll grant you that, but being able to discern the different parts of an orchestra is simple enough if you are at all familiar with them. That she's moving the fingers of her left hand in step with the viola section isn't difficult to spot, nor is it much of a leap to observe she was exceedingly nervous when the faster passages presented themselves. Her fingers stopped and she began fidgeting with the newly-forming callouses. She's been practicing more, but it hasn't helped much."
This other John seemed uncharacteristically quiet, and he kept forgetting that this version of himself didn’t actually know Sherlock’s capabilities. And the other version of Sherlock had never met that John before today. It boggled the mind to think about it, so John made his best effort not to. He would certainly have preferred to have been tied back-to-back with Sherlock. But. John H Watson, in any incarnation, is not a bad person to be tied to. Though his preself had a bare minimum of military skill and training, he likely still knew how to fight. How to take a good, solid hit and keep on going. That might be important. He chuckled. Yeah. Thanks, Dad, for being inter-dimensionally abusive.
“Kinda funny... if I worked here and then ended up going back for a medical conference years later.” The preself gave John a quick up and down. John could see him mentally adding ‘a lot of years later’. He wasn’t that much older. And anyway, nearly dying a few times’ll age you a bit.
"How the hell do you manage that? It's pretty damn simple. You either want to have a cock up your arse or put yours up someone else's, or you don’t. I can't think of anything simpler to figure out."
Things were going well, then. His preself had chosen one of the more impressive moments in his past, and he was grateful John would be seeing him in fine form. Sherlock angled himself to get a peek into the kitchen. He even was wearing Dolce and Gabana.
“Ok, Dad. I got all my stuff done, so Mom said I could play some games.”
Niecey had been watching me the whole time and finally decided to come over.
Good. This was going to be amazing.
Holmes would have said, “Anyone saying ‘ok’ that many times was most definitely not.” And we weren’t. Not really. None of us were during this whole damn crisis. But we’d make it through. We’d make it through.
Sherlock raised his head off the pillow just enough to make his speech clear. “Didn't matter. Already knew.” Sherlock pulled the sheet over his head. John knew he wouldn't be hiding under there for long— Sherlock hated breathing recirculated air— but he took the hint to get up and leave him be. John hurried through his shower and headed off to work.
Poor John. Sherlock and Mary keep taking his stuff.
Later, I ascertained the true issue. I was currently devoted to an intimate partnership. I had, with an embarrassing lack of self-awareness, been in one for many years. And, as Holmes had said once of the greatest of criminals, there comes a particularly dangerous time, when they have been carrying on seemingly forever, and they start to get bored. They want to talk. They want...to get caught.
“Borrowed.”
“Because I am not one of your girlfriends. I’m one of your… As puerile as it sounds, I’m one of your boyfriends.”
He stared at this younger version of Sherlock and flushed. "Well, I wasn't going to bring it up or anything, but....yeah. Look, I know you think I'm exaggerating here, but, it's the truth no one wants to admit to. I've read my share of articles, even been in a few clubs which were just meat markets in disguise, and that is not me. Well, not this version of me, anyway. I want a real relationship, not just a steady main partner. I might want a family, once I am able to provide for one. And I know people think this is sexist and all, but it isn't-- I don't care who stays home with the kids so long as someone does. Raising kids is an important job."
Sherlock’s preself edged in closer, still keeping a watchful eye on John’s preself. “Let him fuck your face, John.”
"I recommend your staying far away from the younger version of me."
He read it once more, still hoping it was some sort of elaborate hoax, but deep down he knew the email was from his brother.
and ...hmmmm
push him away
“I don’t think I would be, Sherlock. We have a good sex life. We know what works for us. But trying new things can be fun or, at the very least, can be a learning experience. To discover something we hadn’t considered.”
Sherlock smiled, but underneath he remained tense, guarded. “I was hoping you’d see it that way.”
"If he booked it in his name,” the preself added.
push her away
It has also been brought to my own careful attention, in light of some unfortunate events, that you might come to question my willingness to assist you in future endeavors. Let this letter, then— which I will admit has gone through sufficient drafting as fits one whose talents lie in numbers far more than letters in hopes of ensuring its lasting service as a keepsake— confirm that you have, as ever, my pledge of assistance in whatever form required, and, as family should never have to call into question (though far too often are made to do so), my love.
“Don’t get too ready now. I’d like to help with that.”
"That... I wasn't gay."
“I still can’t believe in thirty-odd years you’ve never had this happen before, Sherlock,” said John, as he shoved his way past his flatmate into the bathroom. “I mean, hasn’t everyone experienced this?”
That, combined with the flowers themselves, suggested it was illicit. And yet, I could not imagine that to be the case. My brother is an honourable man. True, I know little of him, his having left when I was so very young, but I liked to think I knew him. What I was certain I knew little of was love itself.
Sherlock’s preself grinned at the suggestion. “Nicely put, John II.”
"Well of course I do. I'm making perfect sense."
Sherlock looked around the room. This was absolutely his Montague Street flat. Or…
“I hope you find what you are looking for,” said John.
“So you think I am treating you like one of my girlfriends.”
When I arrived, he met me at the train station and, after a far more formal greeting than I had anticipated, proceeded to travel in an entirely different direction than his description had suggested. Much nearer to Beachy Head. I frowned as the carriage turned abruptly, and he smiled.
“But they don't let you travel for medical conferences."
“I’ve travelled to lots of places for conferences.”
Sherlock shook his head. “What I like? What I don’t? I wouldn’t know what to advise you. Not my area of expertise. Not that I didn’t do adequate research.” Sherlock reached forward and grabbed the back of John’s head, pulling him toward his mouth, kissing him in a way that made him think of plundering pirates. Overenthusiastic. Perhaps proving a point. But eager nonetheless. Yeah, this would be good.
"He's changed a lot...or at least, the way he presents himself has changed a lot. When you compare both Sherlocks. I don't know what to think. If you and I are the same, at least I know I will meet him before I hit your age. If I am from another dimension or something-- well then, who the fuck knows, right?"
“What’s the meaning of this?” I heard him say again, after he was cuffed. And it sounded just as ridiculous this time.
"Hey, wait a minute. You... both of you, even... thought I would... leave?"
Preself chuckled.
Dude was ugly for sure. Ugly wrapped up in an old fashioned velvet smoking jacket. Bald head with a huge round face, menacing grey eyes glaring at me under tufted eyebrows, but his body was tiny and frail. “What is the meaning of this?!”
I wish to offer you and Dr Watson my congratulations on your latest romantic adventure. There was, indeed, a time when I would have read such an account with a degree of contempt— a notion we may, at some point in our lives which grows ever more distant with each passing year, have shared. Yet they say with age comes a degree of wisdom, and as your senior by some seven years, I can attest to the veracity of this aphorism.
"Why were you here?”
"But to find out my postself wasn't interested either," he continued. "That, I admit, was a bit unexpected. Once is an experiment, easily written off. A second time, not so much?"
Well, that line of questioning had probably been a mistake, then. Rather than give even more away, John decided to switch to more open-ended questions-- if he was studying anything currently. Here. Or abroad. No. His reaction made it perfectly clear. This John had never so much as left London.
"Ah. That one was-- 'Had we but world enough, and time...'"
"I just can't play that fast anymore. It's been too long. She will be furious."
“Look, I…” The mission, Watson. “I can't think of a better idea. Yeah, I guess you can go to the stairs. I’ll stay here.”
“Your sister?” John’s preself stared at Sherlock and then shook his head. Sherlock’s preself simply looked puzzled.
"You're… not wrong, and there is nothing to be sorry about if you were."
Sherlock beamed. “You’re sure about that?”
"Well, so, I'm still figuring it out, then."
“As God is my witness, one of these days I shall find myself a new agent. He is harassing me yet again."
Holmes. The man knew precisely what he was doing, and I saw it for the skillful move it was-- to get me to abandon my practice, yet again, and join him. His manipulation proved no match for my stubbornness.
“Ok, you wanted to, and I fucked that up, and now you are just going to be petty about the whole thing and what, take our sex life hostage? And you didn’t say anything at the time, though god knows why, and decided to just go along with it anyway! Why?”
"Hah. Yeah. Having sex with a younger me. That's pretty hilarious. I suppose you and I could take bets on whether my younger self would pin me against the wall and have his way with me, or roll over on his belly on the nearest flat surface, squeeze his eyes shut, and wait for it to be over. Either way, I'd be hating me in the morning."
Forgive me
The water was running. John’s preself was brushing his teeth. The sound stopped, and John’s preself emerged, looking ready for anything. He stood at the edge of the bathroom doorway, gave a quick assessment of the room, then folded his arms. “You have something to say to me?”
He nodded. “Vaseline. Beeswax. Pretty much all improvised from Mrs. Hudson’s bathroom. I couldn’t just go out to my usual costume shop. Closed.”
“Still or sparkling?” the waiter asks, and though I crave my post-case stillness, the mineral content within the sparkling strikes me as a far better restorative for my health.
"This is not my Universe."
Also, did you know that even if you aren't aware of ever having been inside a bubble, the bubble itself leaves trace energy? (Oh, so many things you do not know. How frustrating for you!) Not visible to just anyone, of course, but very visible for those who know exactly what to look for. Like Dr Weise, who contacted me along with all the other Travellers. She is quite thorough and knowledgeable; she told me all about how to avoid fucking things up. Though I do believe I will keep that information to myself.
When they opened once more, Sherlock’s preself spoke. “The logical approach would be to leave them tied up wherever they are whilst you and I solve this… bomb thing… and then go back and get them. They will be safer as hostages. Keeps both Johns away from the blast. No heroics. Less chance of death.”
“I admit to some of it. I cherish you. I feel blessed to have been given a chance at this. I am…protective.”
“Ah. It is nice to have one’s expertise acknowledged. I have studied a great many rare diseases.” He glanced at the badge I was still clutching in my hand and gave me a vicious smile. “A degree is but a piece of paper when set against a lifetime of study. But if you know Holmes, perhaps you also know this. He is a talented man.”
Yours in Deepest Regard,
“Yeah, that and an incurable disease floating around at the time. But I had made my peace with all of it before I joined the service. As…evidenced by the nickname. Besides, Mister “Just Transport”, who the hell are you to lecture me on sexual liberation? You could count your partners on one hand and have fingers to spare.”
"Oh, stop it. I let you take what you needed, I didn't care either way, it was mildly interesting, and you moved on. That’s why you chose me in the first place, remember? Hopefully it was good sex." He blushed just a bit. "For you two, I mean. After. I know what we did was...good. Except for you torturing yourself at the beginning. Bet you haven't had need for all that specialized knowledge you were so keen on acquiring."
John looked at Sherlock’s text again to be sure he had their room number right. 543. As he looked up, he spotted a pretty blonde in a gauzy, white coverup who was making her way over from the hotel pool to the lift. She looked at him and then at the man she would probably assume was his younger brother, maybe even his son, with a deliberately shy smile, knowing full well he would hold it for her. And he did. John smiled as she stepped in, said, “Five,” and they all headed from the bar/vending machines/pool/computer room on the ground floor up to the fifth floor concierge level. Waiting for her held things up a bit, admittedly, and John smiled again for an entirely different reason this time. Sherlock would know why they took a bit longer (a fact which never ceased to fill John with admiration and amazement at Sherlock’s capabilities), and it was fine. They were far past the time when John's momentary appreciation of a pretty blonde would raise an eyebrow from his very own striking brunet. And he was grateful.
about to die
“Nothing. I’m sure you will find your niche.”
The rest of the group followed him to the surface.
It seemed to stretch overly long this time, so John got up and headed to the front room just as Sherlock slammed his laptop shut. “Sorry. I got…sidetracked. Let’s go to sleep. You have an early shift tomorrow, and I want to catch Albert Bridge at low tide.”
Sherlock’s face brightened. “Move in with me.”
Holmes appeared framed in the doorway. He said nothing.
“Well, if I am to get medical care… let it be from a real doctor.”
John grinned back, and didn't wait so much as a second before turning back to his own mobile and typing:
“But—”
Sherlock eyed his preself with thinly-veiled disdain. "You wanted to meet him... after having devoted far more of your... our... life to studying time travel than either of us had ever intended. Remember when you said you could theoretically drop chemistry entirely and study physics, cause a chain reaction, never become a consulting detective? You cut it remarkably close, and I still have no idea how I am unaware of all of this. You were quite right to check on John's very existence. I'd never have met Sta-- the person who will end up introducing us-- if we weren't both in the right place at the right time. How easy it would have been, to have missed that opportunity."
I did not trust Sherlock. Was it possible that he did not trust me as well?
“You’ve never heard of this? Either of you?”
John looked at his self and shook his head slowly. Sherlock steadfastly avoided his self, looking at the carpet and taking a quiet breath. John wanted to take his hand, but he held back. The preself might make some snide comment, and John really didn’t want to fight the urge to deck him if they had to work together to get this done. “Callous indifference and reckless abandon make a surprisingly good team,” John said, as the two preselfs continued their discussion.
“Ok, Dad.”
John waited until Sherlock was out of the flat to let his wide grin emerge. Sherlock was at least energetic now. Sherlock always seemed a bit tense during the times in between cases. Just a bit testy. Critical. Over the years, a lot about Sherlock’s personality had somehow migrated from annoying to charming, and occasionally back again, but by now John knew Sherlock would be on edge when no cases were on. This invariably led to his examining everything in their lives with a critical eye, no matter how well things were going. And they had been going well. Though maybe the fact that the two of them were in somewhat of a rut was a fair point for criticism. Still, Sherlock was just being grumpy. Which usually meant good sex. So long as John didn’t take the stream of insults that went along with the foul mood personally. The before and after, the tension and release aspect, was especially rewarding. And John liked the fact that he had everything to do with Sherlock’s change of mood from grumpy to complacent.  Hell, seeing Sherlock without a case was becoming a bit of an aphrodisiac. But the balance was a fine one between testy criticism and moping on the sofa in a depressive funk.
“Sure,” said Lestrade, looking around as if to figure out which inspector had the paper, “I’ll get it for you.”
“John can you hand me my tweezers please?” Sherlock Holmes asked as he leaned over a dead body, examining its clothes and hair with his typical meticulous scrutiny. John obligingly handed Sherlock the tweezers and went back to examining the scene surrounding the body with Inspector Lestrade. The body in question was a young woman who was lying on her stomach with a long slit across her throat and a puddle of red blood pooling beneath her. Clutched in her hand was the torn corner of a piece of paper.
“Yes, I am. And I don’t want to go.”
“Sherlock, Christmas cheer is a good thing.”
Sherlock smiled up at him. “I would kiss you, but,” he gestured up and down at his body, “pathogens.” John smiled down in turn, gazing at Sherlock from his place standing above the bed, but hurried off when he heard the kettle begin to whistle. He came back with a piping mug of tea, the scents of lemon and ginger drifting up in the steam. He handed the mug to Sherlock, who took it lightly with the tips of his fingers, careful not to be burned. He blew delicately over the surface of the drink before taking a small sip and setting it next to his water to cool.
“If you say so,” John said. “Now we are going to clean that up,” he pointed again at the table full of petri dishes, “and you are not going to argue.” Sherlock nodded and stepped towards the kitchen. He paused and looked back at John. John smiled and followed.
“It’ll make you’re throat feel better,” said John, standing and taking their empty oatmeal bowls to the sink. He pulled out the salt and a glass while Sherlock crossed his arms and pouted in protest. After filling the glass with water from the tap and measuring out the salt, he poured the salt into the water, stirring and watching it dissolve before handing it to Sherlock who took it reluctantly.
“John I will stay here and make you happy for a very long time.” They continued standing like that for a while, John enjoying the warmth emanating from Sherlock and the tree, Sherlock’s mind taking in eighteen different things at once, not a few of which included the soft texture of John’s hair and the comforting smell of his shampoo. Outside the sun was setting and as it got dark London came alive, lights flickering on and people calling out to one another. But in their flat John and Sherlock stood, silently enveloped in each other’s company. And though neither said a word they could both hear the other making a promise to stay and make the person standing next to them happy for a long, long time.
“I was not gazing longingly at your lap,” John protested, but he had to admit, now that he was here he was not planning on leaving. Instead he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and nestled his head against Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock picked up the lab report he had been reading and resumed going over its contents. John was content to just stare off into space and revel in the bliss of sitting in Sherlock’s lap. He was still amazed that this was something Sherlock not only allowed, but actually welcomed. After several minutes of quiet bliss Mrs. Hudson popped her head in the doorway and both were so startled that they concurrently jumped out of their skins and John ended up on the floor as a result, the pages of Sherlock’s lab report floating down around him.
On the walk home they kept their hands in their pockets and walked with a bit of a gap between them, but John could feel the looks Sherlock kept shooting him and he couldn’t resist walking closely to Sherlock a few times, letting their shoulders brush for an instant. He made a game of it eventually, letting his shoulder bump against Sherlock’s, but skittering to the other side of the pavement when Sherlock looked over. He teased Sherlock with it the entire way home, refusing meet his eyes, but feeling a rush go through his body every time they touched. At one point when there was no one else on the street Sherlock reached out and grabbed him by the elbow, pulling him to his side and keeping him there, still looking straight ahead as he did so.
“Um, me,” said John. Molly’s head snapped to a stop and she stared at him in disbelief.
John looked down at his snowflake covered attire and nodded. “Yes. Yes we are.” He slid his arm around Sherlock’s waist. They all looked around at each other, waiting for Greg to show up. When he showed up a few minutes later he looked slightly harried.
“Yes please,” Sherlock said, swinging his legs around to the side of the bed, more sprightly than he had been these past few days. He stood, coming face to face with John, who surprised to see how energetic he was. He returned John’s kiss on the forehead and they walked to the kitchen together.
“You don’t even know that it’s him,” said John, who hadn’t picked up his phone yet.
When Sherlock did wake it was sudden and without warning. He lifted his head abruptly from the pillow and he looked around the room before his eyes landed on John. Seeing John smiling up at him he relaxed and put his head back down, blinking sleepily at him. “It’s Christmas,” John whispered, pressing a kiss to the tip of Sherlock’s nose.
“No John do not touch that,” Sherlock said, reaching out and nearly sending John toppling over as he pushed him away from the set of test tubes John had been reaching for. They were cleaning up the kitchen, a thing that had never happened before, to make Christmas cookies. And by cleaning, what they were really doing was taking all of the beakers and pipettes that had migrated to the counter and shoving them back onto the table in the center of the room where Sherlock kept the majority of his scientific equipment.
“Already got it,” said Sherlock, holding up a clear evidence bag with the scrap of paper inside. He turned on his heel and began walking away. John, after a quick parting nod to Lestrade, hurried after him.
A cold winter breeze was wafting down the street, but the hot chocolate in one hand, and Sherlock’s hand in the other, kept John’s ungloved hands warm as they walked. John took a sip of his hot chocolate and burnt his tongue. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at his sharp and exhale. “Hey, I’m in pain here,” John said at his barely suppressed smile.
“Yes, I know. Maybe we’ll-“
“Don’t you go getting mad at me too,” Sherlock said. John got up to make tea and tousled Sherlock’s hair.
“It’s not that hard,” John insisted, “I can’t believe I finally found something that I’m better at than you.”
“Why not?” said John and Molly in unison.
“I’m happy for you two,” she said after a moment. “I’m glad you have each other.” She say primly on the stool John had pulled out and folded her hands in her lap. John turned over to Sherlock and gave him an “apologize,” look.
A few minutes passed and there was another knock on the door. It was Mycroft, arriving exactly as the clock chimed 8 o’clock. He too was holding a small box. As he was stepping inside John heard Mrs. Hudson hurrying up the stairs. “I’m here,” she called, “I’m on time.”
“It will, it kills the bacteria,” John said, and, feeling bad, walked over to give Sherlock a kiss on the forehead, bacteria be damned. Sherlock leaned against him for a moment before pulling back.
“Great, that’ll be just a few minutes,” said the girl. They payed and went to find a table. Picking a seat by the window Sherlock angled himself so that he was facing towards the street and was turned almost entirely away from the rest of the cafe.
“Ah, yes,” he said calmly, as if he had just remembered where he had left his keys, rather than whether or not something was on fire. He closed his book and stood, looking across the room at John and smiling. John, who was significantly less relaxed about this situation, looked around the flat, trying to figure out where the burning smell was coming from. He stepped from his place in the doorway into the living room, turning back and forth, looking for a source of the scent.
Sherlock smiled, pressed a kiss to John’s temple, and reached into the bowl once more, pulling out a clump, which he broke into two pieces. He handed one to John and put the other in his mouth, letting out a euphoric sound similar to the one John had nearly made earlier. When they finished their stolen morsels of dough John pulled out the cling film. “Alright, the dreaded two hours,” he said, forming the dough into a ball and wrapping it in the cling film.
“Whatever,” said Sherlock, putting the last of the fruits away. “I still think we need a nice murder.” John looked past the bills at the mess Sherlock had made in his fit of boredom, or ennui, as he put it, while John was at the store, and couldn’t help but agree. When he saw the apples Sherlock had thrown haphazardly into a bowl he was struck with an idea. “Alright, that’s it. When we’re finished putting this stuff away we’re going out.” He said.
“God, Sherlock,” John rubbed to tips of his fingers against his temples, “I love you, but sometimes I just really want to-“ he raised his hands and made a motion like he was strangling someone.
“I suppose so,” John said. They approached the table, John with his nose slightly scrunched, Sherlock scanning the many organ samples to see if there had been any changes. He handed John a pair of rubber gloves and put on a pair himself. They each picked up a petri dish and scraped the organs into a plastic bag. “Do I even want to know where you got these?” John asked, nodding to the many different organ samples.
“No,” said Sherlock, “but Mycroft is coming over later.”
An almost awkward silence hung in the air as they sat, quietly staring into space, for a moment. Sherlock broke the silence by taking a deep breath and standing, violin still in hand. He looked like he was about to say something but John cut him off abruptly. “Will you play for me?” he asked, surprising both himself and Sherlock with his request. Sherlock had played in front of John plenty of times, but the idea of paying for him was something new and different.
“Mhm, yeah right. Sherlock, I’m not your mother and I can’t stop you from doing whatever you want, but as your boyfriend and your unofficial doctor, you need to rest.” Sherlock let out a huff of breath and sat down heavily on his chair.
“Names?” she asked. They gave her their names and paid, going to stand at the end of the counter to wait for their drinks.
“So, we do have a case today?”
“Alright fine, I’m achy, and my throat hurts like hell, and I still feel like I might drop dead at any minute, but I really do feel much better, compared to yesterday.”
“How’s my little invalid doing?” John asked.
Together they gazed up at the glittering lights that were sparkling above them. The lights were strung from one roof to another, spanning the width of the street. Most of them were blue and white and dripping downwards in curtains of light. Glancing over at Sherlock, John saw that he was caught in a rare moment of unguarded wonder, the expression on his face one of awe and amazement.
“Where to?” asked the cabbie after they sat down.
“These will have to go in the back, they’re ugly,” he said handing John a stack of ornaments. John opened his mouth to protest but, seeing that Sherlock was right, closed it again and headed around to the back of the tree to hang them where they couldn’t be seen. Sherlock stood up again and began hanging John’s less horrible ornaments on the front of the tree. John could see him through the branches sizing up each ornament and carefully deciding where to place it. It was kind of funny, the way he examined each ornament and deliberately decided which branch to hang it on.
John stared at him in amazement, though not because Sherlock somehow knew about her lack of plans. “Mycroft’s right,” he said, “you are getting soft in your relationship addled state.”
“Yes, it is. It has snowmen, magic, and overt themes of family and love, all of which are frequently present in Christmas movies. Not to mention, its set in, and good to watch during, winter time. Therefore, Frozen is a Christmas movie, despite never actually mentioning the holiday.” Sherlock’s tone was one of coolheaded rationality, as if he were explaining multiplication, or how to dissect a human brain.
“What? No, it didn’t,” John said, not looking up from the coffee pot.
John got up after a few hours and headed into the kitchen. He opened the fridge for a snack, but realized it was somehow already dinner time an called out to Sherlock, asking if he wanted some soup. “Sure, yes please,” Sherlock called back and John walked to the pantry to pull out a can of vegetable soup. He heated it over the stove and, when it was warm, poured a bowl for himself and a bowl for Sherlock.
Settling into the chair he and Sherlock both took up their spoons to have their meal. They ate quietly and when John finished he looked up to see Sherlock’s eyes drooping. He got up and took the bowl from Sherlock. Taking the bowls back to the kitchen, he rinsed them off in the sink. When he came back, Sherlock had nodded off to sleep and John resisted the urge to lean down and kiss him on the cheek. Instead he gathered up the collection of cups and mugs that had accumulated on Sherlock’s bedside table, shut off the bedroom light, and left Sherlock to rest and regain his strength.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “No,” he said.
“They’re fine, they aren’t causing any problems,” John said, “stop being so grumpy.”
“You could help me with these, you know,” John said.
“John by prying into people’s private lives we are doing nice things. Would that client we helped last week know what had happened to his wife without our prying? No, he wouldn’t. Therefore, what we do is nice. Our very profession puts us on the nice list or whatever.”
“Disapprove big brother?” asked Sherlock tilting his head to one side and crossing his arms.
“No, I suppose not, London would burst into flames.”
Mrs. Hudson put her hands on her hip and John kicked him under the table. “Sherlock Holmes, I am not you housekeeper or your mother,” she said, rightfully in a huff and turned, giving one last smile to John before turning to leave. Sherlock glanced up from his coffee to meet John’s disapproving eyes.
“I’m sorry,” said Mycroft, looking between the two of them, “do two you have a memory involving pumpkins?”
John had expected something to change after their big “I love you,” the day before, but they’d still woken up next to each other, had breakfast together, gone to St. Bart’s together, and everything was exactly the same. He had thought for some reason, that when he woke up Sherlock would look slightly different, or when they had breakfast and went about their day, that there would be a different feeling between them. Not better or worse, just different. But instead they had continued with their lives as if nothing had happened at all. John knew Sherlock probably thought of it in scientific terms, so he nudged him with his foot under the table and asked “does anything change after you say I love you? Like with the chemicals in your brain?”
“You’re grumpy attitude is a parasite,” John said, sliding his hand around Sherlock’s waist and guiding his away from Mrs. Hudson’s door. Sherlock continued muttering about how mistletoe sucks water and nutrients from trees.
“I’m sorry, Lestrade just called to say he needed your help solving a murder and you’re sitting there eating toast?”
Mycroft pressed his lips together into a prim frown and sat down on the couch, his back perfectly straight and not touching the couch cushions. “No, and if I remember our childhoods correctly you’re not a fan of it either. He refused to go out in it,” Mycroft said to John, “sat by the window and watched us make snowmen, refused to participate.”
“You don’t need your chemistry set, you need to rest,” said John, feeling his forehead to see if his fever had changed. “Feeling any better?” he asked.
Day 14 - You’re a Mean One Mr. Grinch
“I thought this was my job,” he said, realizing the position he was in.
England had gone back to its usual rainy self overnight and turned the snow that had trapped John and Sherlock inside yesterday into slush. The streets of London, gray as ever, were now filled with watery, half melted snow. Cars raced past, sending up waves of the stuff onto passersby. John peered out of the window to see a dreary city, no more hospitable than it had been yesterday. His breath clouded on the window, blocking his view. He turned away and headed to the kitchen to get himself a cup of tea and some breakfast.
“Yes, we’re in a relationship,” Mycroft said.
John laughed at his expression and took a sip of his cider. “You look amazing,” he said, “you’re getting into the Christmas spirit already.” Sherlock’s frown was firmly in place as they finished their drinks and headed back to Baker Street. But John could tell, from the glint in his eye and the way he jostled John’s shoulder affectionately as they were walking, that Sherlock would be enjoying Christmas indeed.
“No, why?”
“I just came back to see if-“ she stopped abruptly and stared at them. She recovered much quicker than John and Sherlock though, one of whom was so red-faced that she was actually worried for his health, and the other of whom had curled into a ball and didn’t look like he’d be returning to a normal posture anytime soon.
John shook his head and smiled. Whatever Sherlock may say, Mycroft was right. Ever since they had had gotten together, John had noticed Sherlock showing others his kinder, softer, side. The one he used to have reserved only for quiet moments when he was alone with John.
“No, it serves absolutely no purpose.”
“Mycroft’s the same way,” said Lestrade, who was standing next to him, “he never gets cold.”
The test tubes in question held a strange green liquid that John couldn’t identify, so when Sherlock shouted at him not to touch it, John listened and put his hands in his pockets obediently. Sherlock cautiously picked up the test tubes, careful not to inhale too deeply, and set them on the table next to his microscope. When they finished moving all of the things that had spilled over onto the counters back onto the table John wiped the counter down with a kitchen towel, cleaning up the various chemical and food stains.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the mention of secret Santas but nodded. “Yeah, that would be fine,” he said.  They continued their dinner and followed it with dessert. Halfway through their shared tiramisu Sherlock places his hand on top of John’s and let it rest there, his long slender finger fitting perfectly against John’s strong ones. John felt the soft tips of Sherlock’s fingers tracing patterns on the back of his hand, sending shivers up his spine. As they took the last bites of their tiramisu John wanted to kiss him in front of the entire restaurant, but he knew Sherlock wouldn’t like that, so he refrained.
“Oh I can think of several things that aren’t boring,” Sherlock said.
“But John,” Sherlock whined, tugging on his sleeve, “I want to got home.”
“So, you two are a thing now?” Lestrade asked John as they bent down together to look through a stack of plastic bags that had been discarded recently in a corner. Sherlock had arrived with his arm slung around John’s shoulder. Their conversation with Mrs. Hudson the day before had seemed to spark in him an increased need to be very close to John at all times. Even in public, which he usually shied away from.
“Not it my house they don’t,” John would retort. Neither would ever budge. John shoves the jar to the back of the fridge and put the milk and eggs on the shelf above it. “Any new clients while I was gone?” He asked.
“Lord help us all,” Sherlock muttered. John, who was standing next to him, reached out and smacked him lightly on the back of the head.
John rolled his eyes, abandoned the coffee pot, and stomped over to the window. He pulled open the curtains and let out a small sound of shock. “Holly hell, it really did snow,” he conceded. He turned and paused, processing the weather outside, before returning to the kitchen. “What on Earth is all of this snow doing in London?” he asked.
“I suppose so,” said Greg, holding out a package and looking slightly terrified. Sherlock took it with a raised eyebrow. Similar to Mycroft, he unwrapped it without tearing any of the paper. Inside he found a box containing a oversized magnifying glass with a long wooded handle. “To go with your funny hat,” Greg said.
“No,” said Sherlock, stepping forward without warning and nearly sending John toppling over. He began fussily switching ornaments around and muttering to himself. In that moment he reminded John uncannily of his brother Mycroft, who John could easily imagine obsessing over the exact placement of Christmas tree ornaments. “That’s better,” said Sherlock after a moment and he returned to his place next to John. John couldn’t see any difference, but somehow the tree did look better so he nodded in agreement and slid his hand around Sherlock’s waist. “It looks lovely,” he murmured.
“I bought you all candy canes,” Molly said brightly, pulling a bundle of candy canes out of a drawer in her desk. Sherlock and John were in her office at St. Barts, a tiny, dimly lit room near the morgue, along with Mycroft, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson, who Molly has roped into joining the secret Santa after the movie at John and Sherlock’s flat. Molly had texted them all earlier that morning asking if they could meet to exchange secret Santa names. They now all stood in a small awkward circle in her office, each taking a candy cane from her outstretched hands. John watched Sherlock slide his into his pocket and noticed when Mycroft discreetly handed his to Lestrade while Molly’s back was turned.
“No, do not show me that,” John said, turning his head away. “I do not want to admire your charred liver.”
“AH HA, I KNEW IT,” Sherlock shouted standing up from his chair.
“What? No it wasn’t,” John laughed, but Sherlock shook his head.
“What? Where?” Asked Sherlock.
Mycroft cleared his throat nervously and continued. “You see, you two are the only people I can think of who are in a situation similar to mine, so I need advice.” Sherlock looked as though he might say something maligned so John preemptively kicked him again. “My problem is Greg,” Mycroft said.
Sherlock seemed unperturbed by the plastic pinecone bouncing off his head. “Sherlock if you don’t get over here and help me decorate this damn tree I’ll tell Mrs. Hudson it was you who broke her favorite teapot.” Sherlock’s head snapped up in an instant.
“He looks at little sad,” said John, stepping back to assess they’re handiwork. Sherlock, who was standing behind John, wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders and rested his chin on the top of his head.
John felt slightly dazed as he unbutton the first few buttons of Sherlock shirt and kissed across his delicate collarbone. They’d done this before, but it had been different, Sherlock hadn’t been as natural and eager. He hadn’t been nervous exactly, but it was clear that he didn’t have much experience and he fumbled a bit, as people often did during their first times. But now Sherlock was smooth and instinctive, his hands traveling exactly where John wanted them to.
“Well, still. I apologize for interrupting your Christmas Eve. Enjoy your holidays,” he said, turning away and getting into his car.
“Want some breakfast?” John asked, walking over to give Sherlock a good morning kiss on the forehead.
“Most likely.”
“You like it?” John asked.
“How does it bring people together? If anything, all of the holiday commercialism is tearing us apart. I’m America they’ve started shooting each other over half priced video game consuls.”
“Sure,” said Sherlock, and when they reached the cafe he pulled open the door for John and they stepped inside. Sherlock didn’t let go of his hand as they got in line and John leaned against him as they waited, happy that Sherlock was finally comfortable holding hands in public.
John laughed and nodded, happy to take care of Sherlock for as long as possible. Once the eggs had turned from clear to white John transferred them from the pan onto a plate, which he handed to Sherlock, who took it to the table and sat down. He heard Sherlock open the morning paper as he began making his own breakfast. When his own eggs were done he turned to see that Sherlock had entirely disappeared behind the paper, so he slid into the seat across from Sherlock without a word.
Sherlock laughed and squinted at the sharped candy cane. “Yeah, you could definitely stab someone with that, or poison them. I’ve seen stranger.”
“Well, you’re sick,” said John, “so I’m taking over.” He was holding Sherlock with his arms beneath Sherlock’s back and knees, groom carrying bride style. Sherlock relaxed in John’s arms, impressed, but not surprised, by their strength. Despite their height difference, John carried Sherlock easily, his robustness the remnants of his military service.
“He knows what a secret Santa is, Molly,” Mycroft interrupted. Molly look affronted and they stood, saying nothing, for a moment before Sherlock broke the silence.
Both John and Sherlock launched into their explanations at the same time, their sentences getting mixed into a jumble of “were going to tell you,” and “there was a dinner planned,” and “he chickened out.”
“Mostly,” Sherlock said, “I might still need you to take care of me though.”
Before allowing John to reply he picked up his violin with a sort of apprehensive determination and began to play. The first note was sharp and clear, reminding John uncannily of the note that Sherlock had played a few minutes before when he’d had his sudden idea about the case. But what followed was something less urgent. Instead it was curious and a bit skittish, as if he were skirting an idea that he wanted to delve deeper into.
He stepped into the hall to call his parents and reassure them that he hadn’t been buried under a snowdrift somewhere. John listened amusedly from his place in the living room and when Sherlock got back he laughed at the expression on his face. “One snowstorm and they think England is falling,” Sherlock muttered and John grinned.
“Oh no, I think you’d prefer to open them right away,” she replied. John furrowed his brow, more confused than ever, and lifted the lid off his box. Sherlock followed suit and they pulled aside their tissue paper in unison. Together they pulled out their respective sweaters and held them up to appraise. After a moment of gazing in disbelief John let his sweater collapse into his lap, but Sherlock continued inspecting his, holding it up to the light to examine the stitches.
Sherlock frowned and gazed at the liver, holding it up to see it better in the sunlight. John continued cleaning, with his back turned, while Sherlock set the petri dish down and bent over a notebook that had been sitting on the table. He scribbled some notes about the changes in the liver before looking sadly at it. “I have to say goodbye to you,” he said to it, picking up the dish melancholically and bringing over to where John was waiting with an open bag.
“Come on Sherlock, it’ll be fun,” said John, “and I’ll pick out your gift for you so you won’t even have to think.”
Sherlock joined him by the tree, helping to wrap the lights around to the other side. When they were finished with the lights they pulled out the gigantic box of ornaments that John had been lugging around since his early twenties. “How does one acquire this many Christmas tree ornaments?” Sherlock asked as he began unpacking the ornaments from the box.
“What will we eat without groceries?”
The cabbie nodded and pulled out onto the street, driving them into the busy shopping area. By the time they stepped out of the cab onto the street, which was bustling with tourists and last minute present buyers, the sun had fully set and the temperature had dropped with it. John shoved his hands deep into his pockets and shivered.
John and Sherlock looked over at Mycroft, both remembering the time that, in a moment of impatience and frustration, Mycroft had yelled at Mrs. Hudson to shut up. Mycroft’s cheeks went slightly pink and Mrs. Hudson took a sip of her eggnog. “Thank you Mrs. Hudson,” Mycroft said, looking down at the paperweight, slightly embarrassed, but also slightly amused. He passed the neatly wrapped gift he was holding to Greg, who was sitting next to him.
When he finally rose in the morning, after a long night of restless tossing and turning, the sun was filtering through the thin curtains, sending shafts of light across the room, illuminating the dust particles floating in the air. John sighed and sat up, downstairs he could hear Sherlock moving around in the kitchen.
John deflated, afraid that he had embarrassed him or asked too much. But instead of crossing his arms or closing himself off, Sherlock began digging around his bookshelf. He was shoving books aside and occasionally flipping one open to a random page, before shutting it again with a snap. John, still afraid the he had crossed some invisible line, stayed silent, though internally he was shouting desperately at Sherlock. What did I do, he begged with his mind. But it seemed Sherlock was too consumed to hear him.
Sherlock nodded and stepped closer to the curb, waiting for a moment before raising his hand as a cab approached. For the second time that evening a cab pulled up next to them and they got in. This time there was no disagreement, Sherlock gave the cabbie their address and they settled in, pressed close together in the back of a cab, to go home.
“Yeah, but you thought it,” said John as he stepped through the door.
“Wait,” John said, “lets not go home just yet.” Sherlock furrowed his brow in confusion as the cab pulled up beside the pavement. “Lets go down to Oxford Street and see then Christmas lights,” John clarified.
“Is Sherlock better yet?” he had said, “I need him for a case.”
At some point John returned from his place the floor to his chair across from Sherlock. Sherlock collected his fallen lab report and resumed reading it. Both silently agreed not to acknowledge what had just happened and instead stop sneaking around behind Mrs. Hudson’s back. In just one day Mrs. Hudson had given them handmade Christmas sweaters and her stamp of approval on their relationship and it was with these gifts that Sherlock and John continued their lives, at once the same and completely changed.
At the counter a girl wearing fake reindeer antlers greeted them, “What can I get for you today?” Sherlock sizes her up with a raised eyebrow.
When he had the water, he went back to the bedroom and handed Sherlock the glass. Sherlock took a sip and set it on his bedside table. “I’ve put the kettle on,” John said, “some lemon and ginger tea is in order. When that’s done I’m going to go out and getting you some medicine.”
“It’s adorable, thank you,” Molly said, smiling at him. “It is my turn?” They nodded and she handed a package to Mrs. Hudson.
“Are there any cookies left?” Sherlock called to John, who was in the kitchen. He was staring pensively out the window, his fingertip tapping on the sill. When John appeared at his shoulder, cookie in hand, and he took it without a word. He’d been sitting like that for over on hour, trying to work out a case. Taking a bite, frown firmly in place, he tried to picture the problem in his mind, but couldn’t seem to get it right.  “I need to think,” he said, standing suddenly. John resisted the urge to ask him, “isn’t that what you’ve been doing for the last hour?”
