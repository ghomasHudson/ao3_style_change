Dean wide-eyed gaze shutters and color climbs into his cheeks. Any other day and Castiel knows he would find that very fetching but right now it only makes his guilt feel sharper.  He’s managed to break Rule No. 1 in Feeder Care & Handling within days of giving Dean his mark – Do not allow or cause any undue harm to come to the human.  Castiel is unused to making such stupid mistakes this far into his long-life.
Dean's head spins as he finds himself on his feet again and Victor perched on the wing of the small jet, his blade still in his hand.  "No ... not possible.  The Winchesters would never stop hunting."
The man pauses in his signing and looks at Castiel inquiringly.  Castiel blinks and it takes Dean  signing,
Castiel tilts his hand from side to side.  “Sort of. It’s not what I remember but I tend to appreciate my solitude as you know.  Mike has Harvey and other advisers but he’s powerful enough on his own not to need them.”
Castiel gives an annoyed snarl but he flickers in Sam’s vision and Bobby suddenly moans but his breathing is softer … easier. Sam isn’t sure what Castiel did but it was faster than his eyes could track.
He walks toward the kitchen, falling with a crash when the towel winds itself between his legs, tripping him.  Dean is up in a flash, rounding on his brother when a hand smacks him hard on the back of the head.
Sam sits on the roof of Bobby's house, his face turned toward the sun.  It's something he's done since he was little -- finding ways to experience his world.  He can see the sun in a way and when he 'borrows' Dean's eyes, it's been amazing but this ... Sam feels the warmth and for a moment he can almost imagine the light that bathes him.
a life before meeting Castiel in a dark warehouse.  Castiel grips Dean's nape and tugs the human's lips down to his own.
us and gives us our abilities.  The vampires who've wanted to destroy humanity are short-sighted.  Destroy humans and all vampires are doomed to die a lingering death."
about the man helping to move him out of Baby's front seat and onto a gurney.  The man that let Dean wake up alone three years ago and never looked back.  No, Dean Winchester isn't crying over
to communicate while compelled,” Castiel says gleefully. “So. You think I should kill you instead of Sam?”
“Bobby’ll make a start on her while Dean is healing. She’ll be a good project for Jack to help his daddy with,” Mary states. “ Now, get to bed. We have to leave for the hospital early.”
Dean lies on his stomach in their bed. He aches pleasantly in all the right places. He drifts for a while, remembering the previous night. It’s been … different … between himself and Castiel since the Great Reveal. Not bad different but Heaven knows Dean’s never spent an entire night
The question hangs in the air for several long seconds before Bobby, in a voice that says he’s lived too long to put up with lovelorn vampires, grumbles, “Sam, get me up. I need a drink for this conversation. A fucking big one.”
The man’s face remains impassive. He has the youthful look of a male just out of his teens but Castiel knows Jacob Talley was made a Feeder around the end of the Second World War.
Dean looks over and sees Bobby Singer walking up, wiping his hands on a rag.  Dean ducks his head.  His sending always includes all of his family in close proximity unless he intends only one person to hear.  Bobby and Ellen taught him it was rude otherwise.
Dean frowns and tries to reach behind his back to feel the mark Castiel tore into his skin the night before when he agreed to become the vampire’s permanent Feeder. The movement makes pain dart across his shoulders and he winces.  Castiel disappears and reappears with a bottle of water.  Dean jumps in surprise and looks at the water warily.
and moves faster than either brother can see. He captures the tear on a finger tipped with a wickedly long talon. It glistens in the dim light before Castiel licks it away with a tongue far too long to be human.
Sam’s frown doesn’t lessen much but Dean knows he’s considering.  Then the corners of Sam’s mouth twitch and he speaks.
Castiel walks back into the house and into the bedroom. Dean is curled on his side, sobbing in a high-pitched voice.  Castiel picks out words from between the watery hiccups – ‘mommy’ and ‘Sammy’ are frequent.  Castiel sighs when he sees Dean has kicked the sheets off again.  He pulls them back over the shaking body, makes sure the I.V. line isn’t kinked and goes back out to his beer.  Castiel raises a wall between his thoughts and Dean’s so he can enjoy the moon in peace.  He momentarily regrets his fit of pique that prompted him to take on a such an annoying Feeder then remembers the muscled body.  If nothing else, Dean Winchester’s physical attributes were worthy of his attention.  He grins, his good mood restored.  If he has to endure nightly bad dreams and daily bad attitude, he plans on taking advantage of all that luscious pale skin.  Castiel looks forward to hearing Dean beg for his touch no matter how much he doesn’t want it.
Dean nods although his eyes dart to one side to avoid Castiel's intense stare.  Emotions, carefully filtered, begin to slowly bleed through the bond - shame, fear (for Sam, naturally), anger, contrition, confusion -- Castiel finds himself impressed.  Dean's control is more than he suspected humans were capable of although he should have guessed based on Dean's demonstration of strength the night they met.  He contemplates how to respond before deciding actions might serve better.  Dean is extremely vulnerable right now and he will not thank Castiel later if the vampire makes too much of what he's just shared.
“Mmm, the anguish of one brother suffering for another,” Castiel taunts. His expression is somber when he turns to Dean. “Would you truly die for your brother, Dean?”
deep within him.  He sighs after a moment, the sharp pain giving way to yet another impossible wave of pleasure. Dean is pretty certain he's ok with never moving again.  God, he feels
"I - I'm sorry, what did you say?" Sam stammers.  "Ok, um, wait ... this is my brother Dean's phone -- are you saying that he's -- uh, six foot with dark blonde hair?  He -- uh -- he ha-had a leather jacket on ... uh, I think an AC/DC shirt ... oh my God ... I -- yeah, yeah ... where?  Memorial ... huh?  Oh, uh, Sam ... Sam Winchester ... is my brother going to be ok?"
Dean pulls away from the touch. “I’m fine except I’m going to go looney-toons bonding with Nature out here.  Come on, man … I need to
Balthazar lets his mind flow along the brothers’ bond, traveling a fading path back to the source. He’s practically at the portal to Dean’s consciousness when he slams into the mental equivalent of a brick wall. With embedded glass. And iron spikes.
trying to break through the Hunter's defenses but in a perfect storm of emotional vulnerability, Castiel found himself handed the fucking key to the gate.  All it took was some tender words and gentle touches and Dean gave over without a fight.  And, blessedly, Dean's nature is not to dwell too deeply on decisions after they've been made.  The human hasn't bothered to examine the
Castiel tries and fails to find the confused look on Dean’s face anything but endearing. He lets his gaze travel the length of Dean’s body again.  The scars he’d assumed were from former vampire encounters are now something even darker to be explored.  Castiel runs a hand along the warm skin of Dean’s torso and smiles again when the human arches into the touch.  He hears Dean’s heartbeat speed up and the scent of arousal punches through the rich smell of the human’s blood.  Castel looks at Dean’s face and is inordinately pleased to see the hazel-green eyes showing only a thin line of color.  The tempting mouth is slackly open and it takes Castiel’s long-honed self-control to keep him from claiming it in a kiss that will be far deeper than the human expects.  He isn’t sure why he holds himself back.  Castiel gave up caring about the needs of humans the night he awoke as a blood-drinker.  He’s had pets – favored humans he treated less brutally – but even with them, Castiel never held himself back from taking what he desired.  Of course, none of them were claimed Feeders.  He makes a mental note to do a little more reading on the bond between Feeder and vampire – Castiel realizes it might be a bit more intense than he expected.  For now, he’s satisfied to see that Dean’s body is his whenever he decides to help himself.  For all his resistance, the human lying helpless beneath Castiel has taken a significant step toward complete submission.  Castiel suspects Dean is going to be sorely pissed when he comes back to himself, but the deed is done.  Dean’s very cells have discovered their new drug of choice.  No amount of alcohol or recreational drugs will ever be a satisfactory substitute for the high Dean rides now.  Castiel makes an approving sound and moves to stand.
Dean groans weakly when a now-familiar shadow ripples across his brain.  His body is dry and the orgasm makes his dick ache like hell but pain quickly became entwined with pleasure not long after Castiel slid into him in the tub.  He's so full and a short, wavering gasp escapes when Castiel's cock
Dean winces again when Castiel scoops him up and proceeds to carry him up the stairs. He tries to keep his expression impassive as though he’s fine just mildly inconvenienced, but the vampire’s chuckle tells him he’s failed.
A hand, callused from a lifetime of handling weapons, fighting and God knows what else, shakes in front of Dean’s face. Tremors dance along the fingers and hazel-green eyes peer between the digits to plead silently for mercy from the vampire.  Dean’s thoughts are jumbled and confusing to Castiel.  It’s almost as if the human is mentally regressing in age.
As it turns out Dean doesn’t need to go far. As he turns the corner to go toward the Wesson house, Dean sees a rather intent person in a trench coat walking down the sidewalk. Actually, it’s more like he’s
The younger Winchester boosts his nephew close and murmurs against his ear, "Hey now ... don't you want to see your mama, little monkey?  He's missed you so much and I
he’s seeking further contact with him.  He gently clicks his tongue, a gentling noise he uses on animals.  Dean stills, a faint blush dusting his cheeks with pink, making the freckles there stand out.  Castiel coos softly to ease Dean’s sudden feeling that he did something wrong.
Dean’s gaze narrowed but he only leaned in to kiss Castiel.  Their flight back home was only a couple of hours in but Dean had already cum six times.  His ass and thighs ached dully from the most recent marathon posting session. Dean wondered vaguely if he should consider taking up yoga and discarded it almost immediately.  He’d just ask Castiel about finding a local masseuse.
Dean bounds up the steps to follow Castiel who’s already walking through the house to the back.  Sam pauses at the entrance. After a moment’s hesitation, he presses his fingertips just around the edge of the door jamb.  The tiny smear of silver he leaves on the wood when he removes his hand is immediately soaked into the wood in the barely noticeable pattern of a miniature ancient rune.
Carter snorts. “I didn’t say he had to stay in bed – just relatively still.  No activity more strenuous than walking to the bathroom.  And I don’t recommend that without assistance.”
[I don’t know, Dean … please trust me.] Castiel pauses as Dean looks at him. He’s shocked at the fear in the hazel eyes.
Castiel still doesn't know where he found the sheer will to grab up his duffle and softly sneak out of Dean's apartment.  At the time he'd believed it was courage to leave behind the blue-collar Omega and return to his pedigreed life.  After all, he'd been raised to walk a path of privilege and there were expectations when it came to a Mate.
“It’s going to hurt too much if I don’t give you something for the pain,” Castiel says thoughtfully.
Sam has no memories of his biological parents but his entire life is suffused with images and sensations associated with Dean. Oh, they’ve knocked heads a few times but the anger never lasts. Dean’s scent is still the one thing that Sam craves during a drop. It’s the thing he most wants right now but Dean’s warm cedar smell is lost amid the bitter reek of illness and chemicals. Gently, Sam runs long fingers over the metal frames bolted into Dean’s arm and leg, holding him immobilized until he emerges from this deep state of unconsciousness. In Sam’s memories Dean is always loud and bright … full of life. Now he can barely make out his brother’s face beneath all the swelling and bruising.
Dean's face contorts into something like a grimace but both the doctor and Sam realize it's his current version of a smile.  Sam's frown is epic.
Benny rolls his eyes.  "Go on with you."  Balthazar saunters past him and on down the hall to the stairs.  Benny watches him for a minute before turning back to Dean. "Give him time, Dean.  He'll come around."
Dean stiffens at the dig but Castiel snorts.  “Well, at least I know this behavior has a precedence.  I was a bit concerned when I found him scrubbing the shower grout with a toothbrush … for the second time.”
When they get home, Castiel is bundled off to take a shower and then bed.  Gabriel brings him heavily buttered toast and fragrant jasmine tea; a trusted home remedy during times of stress, it breaks through Castiel's numbness.  He's mid-sip when he realizes Gabe and his half-brother, Balthazar, are watching him worriedly from posts on either side of the bed.  The tears start and suddenly Castiel can't stop them.
"Hell has frozen over!  Castiel Novak ... with a Feeder!”  Harvey teases.  He glances at Dean and double-takes.  "Wait, is that --"
Castiel shrugs. “Only the ones no one will look twice at – I’m usually doing a favor for the local police.”
Castiel's eyes widen. He releases Dean and moves to drag over a large wooden spool that held cable at one time. Sitting cross-legged on top of it, Castiel props his chin on his fists and grins.
Warning:  Just a reminder that this fic contains a lot of dubious consent (hello, vampires).  Castiel's morals aren't those of a human (again, vampire).  Also, there are hints to previous childhood physical abuse.
Dean doesn't move. It's like his body is encased in cement. Instead, he focuses the impotent rage toward the vampire.
the most persistent pair in a few years,” he muses. “As annoying as hunters are, you do break up the monotony of immortality.”
of Dean's thoughts and emotions.  If he'd returned any later, Castiel suspects he would have either found Dean deceased by his own hand or permanently withdrawn into the morass of his mind.  He's beginning to believe that the ghosts and demons in Dean's psyche rival his own.  Castiel finishes picking up the plate remnants and dumps them in the trash before moving to stand before the hunter perched again on the countertop.
“You threatened to hunt him down.  Damn it, Sam! I told you I’m still here because I want to be!”  Dean jumps to his feet. “You … the one time I decide to do something for myself and you think it can’t possibly be valid.  Obviously, I’ve got to be mind-controlled because Dean Winchester isn’t capable of thinking for himself. Well, guess what -- I chose to be here.  I
Castiel lays a hand on Dean’s forehead and sighs. “Dean, you need to take a nap.  I’ll feed and you’ll be able to get some sleep.”
“Sam ... have that order up in just a sec,” Beth says cheerfully when the younger Winchester walks in the door.
Castiel sauntered over to Dean and drew a long, clawed digit down the freshly shaved cheek.  He savored the bright hops scent of Dean’s blood. Castiel breathed his words over Dean’s slightly open lips.
“Why so glum, Sam? No word from Dean?” Beth asks as she sets the bag with the take-out at Sam's elbow.
Muttering made him tilt his head to listen.  Dean’s dreams rarely devolved into nightmares since his submission but Castiel listened carefully regardless.  After a moment, Dean’s breathing evened out and he slipped into a deeper rest. Castiel sat down in one of the rockers and sipped his beer.  It occurred to him that this was the first night in several weeks that he’d spent awake while Dean slept. Of late, he’d taken great glee in fucking Dean unconscious before drifting off himself with his Feeder secure by his side despite not needing to sleep.  Granted he never slept long but still it wasn’t something vampires generally did since Hunters weren’t all that considerate of what time they came to cut your head off.
Sam doesn’t give Jake more than a glance. His attention is solely on Castiel who looks almost chastened.  The vampire looks up at Sam. His aspect is human and he looks all of his many centuries.
Dean stands and makes an abrupt motion, silencing Benny.  "I let my little brother down and now he won't even talk to me.  I'm here on your good graces because I got nothing and no one.  Balthazar thinks I'm just using you and maybe I am ... but I'll pay you back for everything.  I'll make it right."
Dean’s phone slips to the floor with a soft thump and he turns to meet Castiel’s red gaze.  The voice that emerges is tremulous and young-sounding.
Dean groaned and surged into Castiel, his hands switching between tugging at the vampire’s shirt and fumbling at his belt buckle.  A whine of protest escaped Dean when Castiel easily took hold of his wrists and pushed him back. He grinned at his Feeder’s dilated pupils and flushed skin.
The vampire's growl drops an octave and he inhales deeply along the line of Dean's neck before suddenly pulling back and bodily setting Dean away from him.  The human grins.
A honk echoes across the parking lot, pulling Dean's attention to the far side of the lot.  There sits a pale blue Chevy truck that saw its better days several decades ago.  A man dressed in jeans so faded they nearly blend in with the truck's paint job leans against the bed without a care in the world.  Dean's grin is answered by its twin and he waves off the bus driver before jogging across the parking lot.  A tight handshake gives way to a hard, one-armed hug with a backslap and a kiss against Dean's temple.
No sooner does Castiel’s attention shift to Dean then the intruder attacks again. Castiel’s wings burst forth as he takes his Dark form but in such close quarters they are more hindrance than help. He needs to protect Dean ...
have started by the time Sam drops into one of the well-worn chairs and lets his head fall onto crossed arms. Mary’s hand slides under Sam’s too-long hair and presses gently against his nape. The pressure point there instantly renders Sam immobile but since Mary is a Beta and his mother, the young Omega feels soothed not dominated.  She holds him still until Sam’s body catches up with his emotions. His breathing hitches with sobs but eventually they fade and Mary releases Sam. He sits up and wipes his eyes on the sleeve of his Henley.
Finishing their walk, Dean and Sam trudge back to the house.  Dean goes to his room immediately.  He hates being reminded that he’s different … that his life is going to forever be an exercise in hiding.  He glances at the photo of his family – it was one of the few things that survived the fire and it’s burned a little.  Dean wonders if he’ll ever meet someone.  He doubts it … how could he ever explain his ability to them?  And why would they stay when he did?
The voice, however, seems to have the ability to understand wounded victim gibberish because he exhales in relief.
A scream rips through the house, startling Castiel from his musing. He curses as his beer spills down his chin.  Wiping his arm across this mouth, the vampire tilts his head to listen carefully while actually entering into the human’s dream.  He hears frantic pleas in a voice far younger than Dean’s current age so a nightmare from his childhood, then.  The images in the dream are distorted and enormous from the child’s perspective.  A white crib towers in front of him and Castiel can hear a baby screaming in fear.  The sound squeezes Castiel’s still heart.  Memories of a tiny tow-headed toddler dancing between trees seep into his mind before being shoved back into the dark recesses where he keeps any recollection of his human life.  The dream shifts and Castiel sees a shadowed figure.  Comical, dagger-length fangs gleam in the darkness and they disappear in a gout of blood, buried in the long pale neck of a woman with gossamer blonde hair.
"Did Benny, like, replace you with a pod person?" Dean asks Balthazar as he sits on the guest room bed.
Parking quickly, Dean jumps out of his car and jogs across the street. Castiel sees movement out of the corner of his eye and turns in surprise.
To his credit, Gabriel doesn't do anything other than open the door and reach past Castiel to shut off the engine and take the keys after putting up the window.  Castiel watches in a daze and doesn't fight his brother when he's tugged out of the cab back into the snow -- another half-inch has fallen since he zoned out.  They crunch over to Gabriel's day-glo orange 4runner and Castiel slips into the passenger seat with no resistance.
“Mr. Winchester, welcome back.  I want you to blink once for 'yes' and twice for 'no' -- do you understand?"
Dean can hear the gentle, sleepy confusion of his younger brother's thoughts. He swallows a lump in his throat ... he's losing everything tonight. He's going to pay for thinking he could ever let his guard down. Dean leans forward on his steering wheel, tears falling unheeded. He sends to Sam, filling the space between them with love and a desperate urgency.
Sam’s heartbeat kicks up and Dean hears Castiel step onto the porch behind him. The vampire’s hand slides across Dean’s lower back to settle possessively on a hip. Dean rolls his eyes and glances at Castiel.
Dean wails as his head comes up.  The compel is powerful and he knows Castiel sees him now -- sees what a broken fucking mess he is and there isn't anything he can do to hide himself from the vampire.  His face contorts as all the anguish he fights to contain daily breaks free.  He shakes his head as if by denying his pain he can somehow force it back into the dark shadows of his heart to not be seen again.  He raises his hands because he can't bear to see the blue eyes that had looked at him so hungrily now looking at him in disgust.
It's from this perch, unfortunately, that Sam tumbles when Dean’s mind scream shrieks through his brain. Momentarily rendered senseless, Sam slumps forward and gravity does the rest. He rolls off the edge of the porch roof and plummets towards the ground only to stop mere inches from the sun-hardened soil.
Mike moves past the frozen vampire with a firm squeeze to Castiel’s shoulder and crouches by Sam’s prone form. The dark stain beneath the young man is wide and even with his enhanced hearing Mike barely makes out the junior Winchester’s heartbeat. Still, this isn’t reason for despair. As long as the heart functions the body fights. Mike knows
Victor meets the older vampire's eyes and then looks away from the glowing red orbs.  He clears his throat before standing straight and looking right at Castiel.  "Forgive me for my error.  It won't happen again.'
!"  Dean swallows and huddles on the floor, gripping the shredded paper towels in both hands.  "I mean, come on ... you're a fucking vampire's
disrespects Dean’s Master.  Especially not judgemental little brothers who don’t know jack shit about anything.
Castiel's head snaps around so quickly it would have broken his neck if he'd been human.  The bed is still fragrant with Dean's release and his blood.  The memory of his Feeder's blissful submission flits through Castiel's memory along with the associate sensations of arousal and desire.  Yet it's not the sex that has him uneasy.
Bobby sighs again and runs his hand over his face.  “Damn it.”  He looks around and says, “Wait here … do
Dean yelps and jumps back from the wardrobe. Castiel stands in the doorway, regarding Dean with an annoyed expression.  Dean takes a step toward the bed and, of course, trips on the Persian rug on the floor.  He fights to regain his rapidly disappearing balance and loses.  Castiel moves faster than Dean can see and manages to catch the hunter before his head connects with one of the posts on the bed frame.  He jerks Dean upright, intending to set him on his feet but the sudden movement makes Dean’s head swim.  He panics, knowing he’s about to lose whatever is in his stomach.  He turns his head but too late realizes it’s in the direction of the vampire.  Sour water gushes out of him onto the vampire who responds with a vitriolic stream of words Dean suspects are curses but in a language he doesn’t know.  Dean finds himself flying across the room into the wall before crashing down onto the nightstand which disintegrates under the assault.
Sam takes another sip of his beer as he listens to Dean’s storytelling.  He looks over at Castiel. “You mean there isn’t a Council anymore?”
Mary smiles. “Because you have always been methodical, Sam. You screamed when I picked you up but I’d had Dean in my arms minutes before ... you got that cute little frown of yours -“
“Hell, how was I supposed to know? You sit me out here or in there and tell me to be ‘good’ like I’m a five-year-old.  And I was tryin’!”
Bobby nods.  “Nice to meet you, Dean.  Who’s the little tempest?”  At Dean’s frown, he points to the baby.
“So explain it to me, Castiel. Tell me why I should trust that you won't turn Dean over to the Powers-That-Be the minute you locate him,” Sam demands, picking up his laptop.
Mary pauses.  "Yes ... he started crying about a half-hour ago and I couldn't calm him down.  Now I know why."
Dean comes down toweling off his damp hair.  He tosses the towel at his brother and then ducks when it is stopped midair and launched back at him.  It lands in a wet heap on the floor.  Dean smirks.
Dean wakes up slowly. Chapped lips shred even further when Dean yawns and he grimaces running fingertips over them.  When he does so, he sees the I.V. tube running from the back of his hand and looks over at the bag hanging from an aluminum stand.  He sits up and regrets the move immediately as the room takes a sickening lurch to the left.  Dean feels his stomach following behind and clenches his eyes shut.  After a moment, the nausea recedes and Dean thinks he can move without puking his guts up.
It's not unheard of for vampires to sleep but it's not easily accomplished unless they've been injured or deliberately choose to wait out a century or two when immortality begins to take its toll.  At not even 400 years old, Castiel is considered a relative child to most other vampires.  The ennui that often settles onto his kind hasn't affected him yet.  The only time he's gone to ground for any length of time was to recover from an very unpleasant encounter with hunters making their way across a shattered land following the war between the States.  He still has a healthy fear of fire, thank you very much.
Dean shakes his head and runs a practiced eye over the vehicle. “You got skills, Cas.  No easy thing to bring a sweetheart like that back to cherry condition.  I oughtta know -- I rebuilt Baby twice practically from the ground up – she’s got my blood, sweat and tears inside every inch of her.”
the damage you’ve managed to rack up in your short life.  Suit yourself, but you’re going back to the house,” Castiel orders.
The ride continues in silence but it's not uncomfortable.  Dean knows Benny means well and he appreciates his friend more than any number of words will ever communicate.  He steals a glance or two at the dark indigo Marks that border the right side of Benny's face.  When they were together in prison, Benny didn't have those marks - his face was as open and clear as Dean's or any other non-soulmated individual.  Fate brought along Balthazar a year or two ago and, in the natural way of things, they touched and the Marks appeared - on the right side for Benny and on the left for Balthazar.  The letters from his friend faltered a little while the relationship was growing but Benny never forgot Dean.
Dean lifts his hands but then just lets them fall to his sides. He dresses quickly and is gone. Castiel looks around the bedroom. Only a few moments ago he was happier than he ever thought he could be … now it’s all ash and regret.
Dean would wail for his vampire if he could but his tongue is spiked to the bottom of his mouth by more of the wire wrapped around his skull. The blood has at least clotted so it doesn’t run down his throat anymore.
Sam looks down into his cup before he answers; a thousand smartass answers flood his mind but he shoves them aside for the response he doesn’t want to voice.
Castiel raises an eyebrow. “Not a minute ago you were assuring me you were fine with parading your naked self around me –“
He walks over and tenderly trails fingertips over his grandson's dark hair.  John had been less than thrilled when Dean had returned home pregnant sans Alpha.  He'd taken a bat to a fence post and battered it into splinters just to keep himself from saying something he would regret.  When he'd walked back into house, he'd hugged Dean and told him that they would help him as much as they could and did they need to bury an Alpha.  The tears that had followed had washed all the shame from Dean and John would always be grateful he kept his tongue for once.  He chucks Sam's jaw gently.
Castiel screams again but makes no sound. Blood fills his ears and leaks from his eyes as the voice of his First slices into his mind in the language of the undead. He finds himself pinned by the same fathomless gaze he fled only moments ago. What surrounds the black orbs, however, is not as easily defined and Castiel’s sanity warns it will not hesitate to abandon him should he strive to put shape and form to the brume ebbing over his body.
Castiel Novak sits down at a booth in the small diner.  He orders a hamburger and fries with a large milkshake – his usual.  The waitress, Beth, smiles and takes his order before leaving.  She doesn’t have to strain to understand him any longer because she’s used to his voice by now.  Castiel has no idea what it actually sounds like -- he was born deaf.  But from what his brothers tell him, it’s deep and rough.  Some people have no trouble hearing his words, others never get the hang of listening.  His job as a skip tracer, fortunately, can be done online and so his verbal interactions with people are minimal.  Castiel likes to eat lunch in the diner and he goes for walks sometimes in the evenings.  He feels lonely sometimes, but he manages.  He’d rather not be the center of attention anyway.
His instinct is to struggle but the warmth stealing over his brain is so tempting. Dean feels like he’s being wrapped in the softest blanket in existence.  He just needs to close his eyes and let it envelope him.
Castiel regards his Feeder for a moment. Dean’s heartbeat is steady, he isn’t trying to ply the vampire with false sympathy.  He’s simply stating fact.  It makes Castiel wonder even more about the damage he sensed earlier.  The curtain slides back and the attending steps next to Dean’s bed.  He glances at Castiel and both vampires’ eyes gleam amber for a moment.  Dean rolls his own eyes.
.  Dean’s fingers fly over the name and Castiel finds himself almost giddy watching.  Signing and speaking at the same time, Castiel replies.
Castiel snugs his Feeder close in response.  Sam’s eyes zero in on the movement immediately before locking onto Dean with the disbelieving bitch-face saved for when Dean did something exceptionally out of line.
Icy crystals pierce deep into Castiel’s bones and the very pit of his core echoes with a fear he hasn’t felt in centuries. Paralyzed, Castiel sees the very air around him writhe like a live thing. A gauzy tendril brushes over his skin, ripping an unexpected scream from the vampire’s throat.  Molten lava pours across his wings, engulfing him in white-hot agony. His muscles sear and draw impossibly tight, inexorably bowing his body until he is hunched and vulnerable. And then the nothingness around him speaks.
freaks. He has good reason for this -- Ellen's daughter by her first husband was a telekinetic.  Ellen did not want to register her, but her husband insisted.  Then he divorced Ellen and got full custody of the girl.  Ellen hasn't seen her since and doubts she ever will.  Both boys know she grieves over her loss.
Dean forgets his unease at the encounter momentarily when he sees the plane's interior.  It's like the living room straight out of an upper-class home.  Leather couches, an enormous television, a coffee table -- everything is high end and no doubt very expensive.  Dean whistles.
something.  Instead, I ran into an old friend of Castiel's named Alastair.  He turned me after he killed everyone in the station.  Castiel found me and helped me."  The vampire grunts.
“Stay, Sam.” Castiel says.  “We can rehash how we got to this point or we can move forward.  And, honestly, I’d hate to see all the work Dean has done over the past two weeks go to waste.”
The Cajun leaves after a long searching look at his friend.  Dean goes to the bathroom and splashes some water on his face.  He stares at his reflection -- fifteen years older.  Dean hopes he's got the wisdom to go with it.
Sam’s chest vibrates with his own version of a purr. It’s not as smooth as most Omegas but it’s all Sam. Jack relaxes against the broad pecs and finally risks a peek at his parent - father and mother in one.  A frown line bends the small brow into an instantly recognizable expression - Jack is
Dean’s mouth is open to snap back but then he feels Castiel’s fingertips pressing ever so slightly into his side.  Dean swallows his anger and watches the vampire go down the steps with his hands in full view.
Writing is my therapy when the voices are a little too loud and they make my soul feel worthless and shriveled. Thank you, my beloved readers for allowing me to share these poor tales with you. You are my sunlight. 💙
A single obsidian claw drags down the armrest of Castiel’s chair. The sound is grating but with a brisk tap the claw vanishes, sliding away into a perfectly normal human digit. Castiel turns gleaming eyes on Sam.
Dean closes his eyes. Being tied to a being that he's hunted for most of his adult life is hardly the ending Dean had imagined to his night but he has no choice. It's Sam. He looks at Castiel, meeting the vampire's blue eyes directly and unwavering.
Unbidden, memories of the time since his breakdown come to mind.  Dean doesn’t examine the why of anything very often and he isn’t about to start now.  Castiel owns him.  He feeds off Dean and he fucks Dean and how insane is it that this is the best life Dean has ever known? His vampire makes sure he’s safe, warm and happy.  Since he was four, no one has bothered to do more than one of those things at a time and never with the unadulterated tenderness Castiel gives him.  Dean suddenly realizes he means what he said - he does
?  He's my pup!  I can't just forget!  Dean had no right to keep him from me!"  He stands.  "I didn't -- I would have done what was right.  I would have."
Castiel sighs. “While that might help with our story later, I think I’ll stick with a more traditional method.”
Castiel nodded but did not shift back to his human appearance.  He liked to take Dean in his Dark form as often as possible and now seemed an appropriate moment.  With a snarl, Castiel surged against Dean and buried both his fangs and cock in the human’s warm body.  Dean came with a shout and found himself begging for more.
Dean nods and stands with Castiel's help.  He balances on one foot while the vampire perfunctorily removes the stained boxers.  Naked, the former hunter puts one foot into the warm water and sighs deeply before sinking below the bubbles.  "Oh
of psychological torture.  Shadows ring the listless green eyes and the few freckles that dot the bridge of Dean's nose stand out in stark contrast to the too-pale skin.  The link between them allows Castiel to test Dean's emotional strength and it's difficult for him not to show alarm at the
He shivers in the cool silence that surrounds them except for the click and hum of machines keeping his brother breathing.  Sam runs his hand through hair Dean insists is too long and moves to stand closer to his brother.

path of revenge."  He looks back at the blonde.  "You followed in your father's footsteps like a good son.  Just my luck that you turned out to be good at it."
”You could, of course, return to that life. However, if you chose a different line of work, I could offer my personal protection for your family. No one could seek you out in retribution.”
Castiel blinks as his entryway comes back into focus.  Dean remains in front of him, shoulders rounded.  He's studying the floor like all the secrets of the universe are contained there.
[You got it,] Dean signs quickly. He hops off his stool and then turns back with a frown. Beth laughs.
"You were in a car accident, sir ... your jaw is broken and we've got a neck brace on you.  Just relax and we'll get you out of there, ok?"
attracted. Castiel’s eyes caught his attention but it’s more than that – his mind doesn’t sound like anyone else Dean knows. Dean hears the surface noise from every mind around him all the time. Normally he can ignore it, the sound blends together into one indistinct buzz. Castiel’s mind, however, doesn’t really buzz. It hums. Combined with the deep gravelly voice, it creates a mental vibration that Dean has never felt before. He wants to get to know the man better. He smiles and decides to text Castiel.
The human struggles to form words and fails.  He frowns and stares at the floor so Castiel takes hold of Dean's chin.  The vampire nudges his Feeder's mind with gentle encouragement.
“Please,” Castiel asks. “Is there any way he can move around?  I can’t promise either of us will survive his being confined to bed again.”
that it can all be taken away in a blink. He learned that lesson as a child and he has never forgotten it. You say I released darkness in him but I didn’t … all the evil he’s seen and he can still find joy in a good cup of coffee or a slice of cherry pie with the perfect scoop of ice cream. Dean … Dean burned
Heads snap around and eyes zero in on the newcomer.  John hands Jack off to his mate and moves to place himself in front.  Sam does the same, creating a wall protecting the pup.
Dean shakes and Castiel feels the tension of earlier slither into his Feeder. The bliss of the feeding is rapidly disappearing and Castiel can see lines of muscles beginning to tighten as pain and clearer thinking start to solidify.  He knows Dean isn’t strong enough for it, not really, but Castiel quickly bites into his human’s wrist.  Dean jerks and moans in pain.  The sounds fade quickly into a soft sigh and all the taut lines relax.  He cups Dean’s neck and nuzzles against the warm skin, the overflow of Dean’s submission making him feel tender.  Castiel wants to fight it but Dean’s heartbeat is strong and steady without any of the normal blips and unevenness that normally accompany the hunter’s conscious distrust of the vampire.  It’s a nice sound.
Dean feels like an idiot. Of course he'd know if Castiel was lying or trying to deceive him ... but he's too scared to touch his lover's mind again. Until Castiel forces his voice out again.
The hunter waves dismissively. “I’m fine, Cas … guess your last feeding is wearing off.”  He gestures at the car.  “’67 was a good year for American heavy metal, huh?”
Dean cringes as his father’s fear blossoms into terror.  He clutches Sam’s small, squirming body to himself and goes down the stairs as quickly as he can, afraid he’ll drop the baby if he goes any faster.  He coughs at the smoke that begins to fill the air.  Dean finally gets to the front door when he hears his father’s voice bellow in pain.  He nearly passes out from the wave of searing heat that tears through his mind but Dean was raised to do what his daddy said.  His daddy told him to take care of Sammy and that, by God, is what he will do.  Dean runs out of the house and down the dirt driveway toward the edge of their property.  There’s a big tree by the fence and Dean crouches down with Sam held close to him.  He shivers in the bitter air, clad only in his pajama bottoms and Star Wars t-shirt.
It told me how his father kept him convinced he was good for nothing more than the life of a Hunter. How
Castiel slams his palm down on the table sending shards of Formica flying. The table creaks alarmingly.
"Don't bother.  Look, you're here and you can stay but I'm only doing this because my soulmate feels some sort of misguided loyalty to a man who abandoned his fifteen-year-old brother because he couldn't stay clean and had the genius idea that he could run from the police."  Balthazar looks smugly at Dean.  "Does that about sum things up?"
Castiel’s face shifts to the hurt expression Dean expected. He swallows the pain because he can’t take the chance. Not with Sammy’s life on the line. [Go ahead.]
He returns to Dean and bends over the spasming figure. For patient safety reasons, Dean’s limbs and head are held immobile by straps. Choked gurgles escape the elder Winchester as he fights the intubation made even more dangerous by the fact that his broken jaw is wired into place. Hands on either side of Dean’s head, Sam meets his brother’s eyes and smiles. Easing his forehead down to meet Dean’s, Sam inhales and starts to purr.
Dean remains silent. Sam stands obediently still, the shotgun still jammed against his older brother's jaw. Dean jerks when a finger taps his forehead. The cerulean orbs are only inches from his own and Dean is exceedingly grateful for the sharp daggers of pain that stab into his leg. His eyes slam shut before he can fall into the vampire's thrall.
I must apologize as I know little of physical limitations beyond what Hollywood and a little Googling have taught me.  I don't mean to offend but if I got something wrong, please let me know.
Bobby Singer, John's closest friend and honorary uncle to Sam and Dean, glares at him from his seat.  "Shut up and sit down, you idjit before you wake the pup," he hisses.
If I haven't said so before, I'm always grateful for each and every reader I have and for any comments you care to bestow upon me.  It makes me happier than you know.
A soft, even voice laced with startling power pulls Castiel from his daze.  He releases Dean who slides to his knees, shaking.
"Relax, brother.  I told you you'd have a home when you got out and this is it.  Stay or go, your choice but you'll always have a room if you need it."
The screen door squeaks open on tired hinges and slams shut behind Castiel and Balthazar. The elder Novak brother lowers his hand and Sam slowly drops to the dirt. He crouches beside the young man, his eyes gleaming blue-white.
Dean's eyes drift up to study Castiel's.  The vampire sees the green gaze searching for deception.  "I'm tryin', Cas."
"I see," Dr. Barnes sighs.  She turns to Sam. “Call your family but I want Dean to sleep tonight. Plenty of visitation time tomorrow -- half hour and no more with your son.”
. Men I’d known my entire life suddenly decided I didn’t deserve to live. That my … brothers … didn’t deserve to live. My family … they burned beside me. I will never forget their screams.”
Castiel snorts and turns back to working on the ‘Vette. “I’m sure Sam values your concern for an inanimate object.  Did your father teach you about cars?”
Mike nods and turns to Castiel who suddenly wants to study the tips of his shoes.  The First chuckles.
Bobby, walking into the kitchen, hears the shower turn on.  Sam glances up at the stairs and a slight frown creases his forehead.  In the upstairs bathroom, the toilet flushes.
"No, enough, Ben.  You have a soulmate and you two deserve a life together without a loser ex-con moping around in your guest room.  I just need to save up a little and we'll go from there."
,” he points at Bobby. “Never saw how desperate Dean was to prove himself ‘good enough’ to you because of that. How terrified he was that you might close your door to him if he failed.”
Dean arrives at Castiel's a little early. He rings the doorbell. There are several indicators throughout the house to notify Castiel – flashing lamps, computer screen pop-ups, even a warning box on his tv – Dean was impressed to learn how far technology has come.
Castiel smiles. “You have always been as much my protector as my tormentor.”  His face falls and tears spring up.  “But I fear – I fear all is ruined now.  I am betrayed.”
Bobby does an energetic leap from the porch and lands with a grunt beside his adopted son’s hovering form.
Benny snorts.  "Don't worry that pretty little head about him.  We had a come-to-Jesus about a month back.  He's fine."
Castiel regards the smug grin with annoyance. His privacy has always been sacrosanct yet now he has a
“What do the undead have but time, Sam?”  Castiel’s claws emerge and retract as he gathers his words. “Dean … Dean’s soul is like a beautiful cracked glass. If Ashe kills you or Bobby or myself … all three if he can manage it … Dean will … Dean will shatter.”  Castiel groans and presses the heels of his hands to his eyes. “Ashe will taint whatever is left of Dean and even though he’ll try to keep him in thrall as he did me, Dean is far  stronger than he even knows.  He’ll chafe against his chains and when he breaks free he’ll be nigh unstoppable because he’s been raised a Hunter.  The First won’t have any choice but to kill him.”
Castiel sighs and nods. “I know, Dean but I had to remind you of what could happen , alright?  You think this is temporary but it isn’t – you belong to me until I release you.”
“Far better than deserved, Castiel,” Gabriel replies with a broad smile that fades as he takes in his younger brother’s look. “Faith!  What cause brings such a storm-cloud to your countenance?  Sit you down.”
Feeder -- has given him a clear sign of his submission.  He intends to take Dean until the man forgets he ever
"Sam?  Sam, what's wrong?  Talk to me, baby," Mary pleads softly when the expected snark doesn't immediately come.
Dean blinks in shock.  The guy signs?  He didn’t know anyone else outside his family that signed – some of the people who interact with him often have picked up a few things, but it’s not really necessary since he can hear.  Dean slides off his stool and heads out after the man.  He sees him walking down the sidewalk like the devil is after him in a trench coat of all things.  Dean grins and lopes after the man, putting a hand on his shoulder when he reaches him.
A warm hand drifted over his cooling skin.  Dean asked no questions; his calloused hand simply swiped slowly over Castiel’s back.  It was soothing. Tension melted out of the vampire’s body. Castiel allowed himself to lay back with his head on Dean’s thighs.  The same hand drifted across Castiel’s chest.
Dean makes a broken sound that startles Castiel.  He pulls the vampire's arms even tighter around him and presses a kiss against the palm of Castiel's clawed hand.  A part of Dean realizes he's exchanging his entire life for a gilded cage but the part of him that's withered from years of neglect yields with grateful tears.  Even if it's only for his blood and body, Castiel's mark makes him
Castiel stands and drags Sam upright with him. His wings brush opposite sides of the room. Sam struggles to breathe as Castiel’s fingers tighten over his windpipe and the thought crosses his mind that he’s about to die. Castiel sneers at him instead.
"My mate is a good man.  He made something of himself once he got out and I will not have the likes of you dragging him back down," Balthazar warns.  "You have a roof over your head - rent free despite my attempts to impose a financial requirement on you - and a job at Benny's diner."  The man leans close to Dean.  "Make no mistake, if you abuse my mate's good nature or betray him in anyway, I will end you."
Castiel snorts and begins to pace in front of the fire, his hands gripping his dark hair tightly. He looks down at his brother before sitting again.
“Don’t worry so much, Castiel. Harvey insists I’m too soft but I’d rather have your loyalty willingly than by fear,” Mike smiles with just a bit of fang. “Still, have to keep up appearances.”
Dean rocks slowly back and forth. He sits on a long front porch looking out across the lawn.  Castiel’s house is set a good mile back from the road and has large trees scattered around the house which sits on a stupidly large bit of land.  Dean can’t even hear cars if he strains his ears.  He was amused to learn that there are pressure sensors set into the drive that send alerts to Castiel’s phone.  A back-up precaution because Castiel’s hearing would alert him long before any vehicle got even close to the house.  It’s all private and peaceful, two things Dean knows little about.  He sighs and drinks the lemonade Castiel makes fresh daily –
this life??”  Castiel’s eyes widen. He laughs with no humor and folds to sit on the cold concrete floor just across from Jake. His head falls forward into his hands. The human stares and looks around him in confusion.
Dean ditches Baby six hours down the road. He hates to leave her but she’s too easy to track. He doubles back and heads a different direction. He’s only got the clothes he wore for his date with Castiel and twenty-three dollars in cash but Dean knows he’ll manage somehow. He can hustle pool or kill a few poker games to get cash. He can do other things, but Dean decides not to consider that unless things get dire. He only wants to put as much distance between himself and his family as he can – he plans to never look back if it means they leave Sammy alone. By running, Dean hopes to pull attention to himself and convince the hunters to abandon the search. He wishes he'd never met Castiel Novak.
The vampire licks along the shell of Dean's ear.  He's grown rather fond of Dean's taste in more ways than one over the time they've spent lost in each other's bodies.  The hops flavor grows more intense when Dean is aroused and so Castiel made sure to keep his human in a constant state of excitement for at least the first four hours.  He's loathe to let Dean's awareness return but despite his new resolve to remember their relationship is nothing more than predator and prey, Castiel has a sworn duty to feed the man and rehydrate him.  The separate parts of Castiel's tongue flick over an earlobe and slide into the ear canal at the same time.
Castiel huffs a laugh that makes Dean tremble.  The sub-bass sound reverberates through his consciousness and whereas it would have terrified him a not so long ago, now he oddly feels comforted by it.  The words are almost like a tender caress against his mind.
Dean’s scream haunts Castiel in the days to follow when he dreams repeatedly of the entire wall of his home exploding outward in a storm of splintered wood and fractured glass while his beloved Feeder is borne away into the darkness and their bond disintegrates into ash and silence.
Not using their abilities to do chores is a rule long set in the Singer household.  Ellen says it reminds them of their differences and keeps them grounded.  Dean thinks it’s stupid because how could he
is shattered.  The one thing Castiel lacks glows brightly in Dean but the light is fragmented.  And suddenly Castiel wants nothing more than to bathe in the luminescence of the cracked stained glass heart beating so strongly in Dean's chest.
Once clean, Dean pulls on tattered jeans and an old Henley before loping downstairs to see Castiel plating a full eggs, toast and bacon breakfast.  A centuries old vampire who doesn’t need to eat anymore is making Dean Winchester breakfast.  Dean feels the odd sense of
"De-Dean ... he's at Memorial ... there was an accident ..." Sam replies hoarsely.  "Mom, he -- it sounds bad."
Dean fights not to gape when he sees Castiel. He's wearing a dark blue shirt that brings out his eyes and a dark-washed pair of jeans with a black leather jacket. He's probably the sexiest thing Dean's seen in a
Castiel's reaction is lightning swift.  He grabs Dean’s arm and pulls him close. Hot, copper-tainted breath sears the side of Dean’s face with every word.
Mike’s voice is so soft but what lies beneath it makes Dean’s blood run cold.  The First offers a faint smile to put him at ease.
“Yes, it would probably kill you, Dean. I don’t know – I’ve never seen one broken.  Just – just accept it, alright?”
Dean freezes at Castiel's voice. He hasn't heard it often but he likes it ... only right now he's afraid of the accusation that will follow. When he hears nothing, he ventures to look at Castiel again. The look of terror is gone ... there is fear but it is fear that Dean will leave. Dean feels the tears beginning to slide down his face and jerks when Castiel's hands come up and frame his face.
Castiel grunts. “That’s true enough.  It’s all computer run these days – gizmos to do everything but put gas in the damn thing.  Luxury is all well and good but you can’t
Dean waves and finishes the weld. Satisfied, Dean shuts off the torch and throws up his welding mask. Pulling off his safety gear, Dean walks over and takes the brown bag handed to him by his co-worker, Garth. Garth is the scrawny bit of nothing that got Dean the construction job he currently holds. Dean likes him – Garth’s mind is kind and he doesn’t need Dean to participate in any of their conversations. Dean eats in peace while Garth fills him in on his latest conspiracy theory or miracle cure or whatever else fascinates the man this week. Garth knows him as Mark Campbell. Dean knows that his identity wouldn’t stand up to someone squinting too hard at it but he hopes it lasts long enough to let him make some money.
"No ... he explained that you are his brother and I need to make an effort to make you feel welcome."  Balthazar offers a sickeningly sweet smile.  "This is me making an effort."
Dean’s eyes go hard. “Dad did what needed to be done … and he taught me and Sammy the same thing.  Whatever you think you know about him, you don’t.  So just drop it.”
The phone slips out of his grasp a couple of times but when he sees it's barely after four a.m., Dean flops back onto the mattress.  Even more awesome. Dean squeezes his eyes shut and threads his fingers into his hair where he grips it until he can feel his scalp protest painfully.  As a small child, Dean learned how to dream lucidly so he could wake himself up and prevent any unwanted sending. As he got older, he learned to lock down his mind so nothing broke loose while he slept.  Even his usual nightmares - which are nothing compared to these latest monsters - were securely held behind his shields.
The vampire moved then and Dean found himself stretched out beside Castiel, facing him.  He felt his body valiantly trying to rise to the occasion because if he had to admit it, he absolutely loved it when Castiel manhandled him.  He reached out to cup the smooth jawline but Castiel captured Dean’s hand and pressed a soft kiss to the palm. Dean felt his face grow warm at the tender gesture which was ridiculous considering their physical relationship.
“Of course it is, honey. You were in full bond crisis the day we met you,” Mary reminds him. “And then you scented Dean on me.”
to touch the mental hidey-holes Dean has in his head. Yeah, Castiel found a few of the big ones; the ones with the most locks, but then they fell in love and the vampire’s forays into his Feeder’s brain tapered off into simple, pure connection without the need to probe. Dean’s secret places became his own again.
Castiel looks at this hunter cowering on his kitchen floor and he decides that he's grateful John Winchester is dead.  Otherwise he would be sorely tempted to end the man for what he's done to his own child.  Castiel is well-versed in what losing everything you hold dear can do to a person -- it's why he lives alone even from his own kind.  The man in his arms now bears the scars of a heart torn apart and forced back together with no time to mourn.  His
or your fucking pansy of a Feeder takes that from me!”  He laughs.  “Dean’s almost dead. And you will be too as soon as Sam’s heart stops. The First will end you for a broken vow.”
Castiel feels Dean’s worry and looks down at his Feeder.  Once upon a time he’d have rather been staked then coddle a human like this but since Dean gave himself over ... the vampire sighs.  Green eyes, bright with unshed tears, flit over his face, searching for some comfort, some reassurance.  Castiel finds himself uncharacteristically furious at Dean’s long-dead father.  Dean craves approval like Castiel craves blood and will kill himself trying to be perfect at everything he attempts.
”Shut up.  I owe you no matter what you say. If this is how I get to pay it back then you just lay there and let it happen.”
Dean waves it off. [No worries ... we played that one out as far it was gonna go which was no where. Stayed friends though which is a good thing because his steaks are the
Castiel chuckles.  "I so stand, Dean.  Come on, I'll introduce you to our pilot.  He's new to my employment but is quite proficient."
”The Winchesters and their extended families have hunted our kind for generations as you know,” Castiel continues.  He looks down fondly.  “The latest generation is particularly ... persistent and hard to ignore."
"Cas, as much money as you guys got stashed all over the world, ya should be able to afford a better interior decorator," Dean quips as they walk down a very beige corridor.
Dean winces at the plaintive tone of Sam's thoughts. He can almost feel Sam's hand on his arm and knows his brother is using his ability to try and physically stay him.
Castiel laughed and tugged his Feeder close.  He dragged fangs over Dean’s pulse point and smiled at the soft keen his human made.
Dean lets his mind to drift over the house until he locates Castiel. He smiles when he feels happy anticipation.
The vampire chuckles. “Now isn't the time to play dense, Dean. You'll be my Feeder ... which means I can take blood from you whenever I want. You can decline if you want. I won't kill Sam.”
“Ashe wanted me. After my Turning and the destruction of my village, we came together. It was savage and bloody. It was all Ashe had dreamed of and it was also the last time he knew my body.  We traveled together and I indulged in every vice I’d denied myself while mortal but I never gave into Ashe again. Time and again I refused his advance.  Years passed and yet I remained cold to him.  When the time was right ... I left.” Castiel sighs. “Since then, he’s stalked my existence. The wards in place here were ancient and they kept him at bay. He had to know about Dean and his entire purpose for existing is to punish me for abandoning him after he went to all the trouble of turning me.”
The whimpered use of the honorific startles Castiel. He blinks at the hazel-green eyes welling with tears and feels the sincerity of Dean’s plea.
Sam nods and watches the doctor leave before turning back to his brother. Their fingers link easily and Dean has never been so glad to see his baby brother smiling down at him in his life.  The memory of seeing Castiel again is lost in the roiling mists of Dean's mind.
A car accident is a very noisy affair, Dean Winchester decides.  It's not like the movies where things just sort of drag out but instead, it's an explosion of sound that seems to be everywhere at once.  This is Dean's observation at least while he's trying to gently pump his brakes and stop his slide on the icy highway just outside Sioux Falls.  He says some very unkind things about the pickup truck driver whose inability to adjust his speed to road conditions put him in this situation.  One minute Dean is cruising along on his way home and the next he's got a Dodge crunching the side of his Impala and sending him into the guardrail.  He manages to hold her steady but momentum spins him sideways across the lane right before he stops.  A tear slides down his faces as he murmurs a soft "I love you, baby boy" to his son before the tractor-trailer hits him broadside and everything goes dark.
Dean’s laughter follows Castiel as he slams through the wall to find the would-be assassin fighting to stand but the hardwood floors are waxed and a bitch to gain purchase on when you’re walking on claws. Add to this the fact that his entrails are sliding free of the paramountcy of his torso and Castiel sneers.
Castiel snorts. “Please. I'm not a human making idle promises. As long as you live, Dean Winchester, you'll belong to me. No other vampire will be able to touch you without my consent. Of course this means you'll never be able to hunt again.” Castiel turns to Sam's limp body. “Oh and if any hunters come after me on your behalf, I'll kill every last one of them and turn Sam anyway.”
”And after all that time hiding who and what I am ... I realized I never really knew in the first place,” Dean swallows.  “I don’t have to be anything or anyone with Cas.  For once ... for once just being Dean is enough.  I’m finally good enough just as me.  And I don’t want to give that up.”
Sam Winchester walks to the diner to pick up a to-go order. He spends his days with Bobby at the shop. It's been a week and a half since Dean left. No one has come to their door asking questions. Ellen dotes on Sam as if trying to make up for his brother's absence. Bobby is ... Bobby remains quiet and withdrawn. The house is full of sadness as if someone died. Sam finds himself not wanting to be trapped in the smothering walls that echo with Dean's presence.
Dean obeys. He swallows Castiel down after swiftly freeing his vampire’s cock and the barbs that tear into his tongue hardly faze Dean. Pain, in all its glorious nuances, is forever entwined with pleasure in Dean’s psyche. And although he doesn’t ponder it too much, the former Hunter knows it’s always been that way. He grew up learning that pain was just something else to be controlled during battle. It became a tool and now it is as much a part of Dean as his limbs.
Dean murmured contentedly, “Easy on the vocab, Cas … ain’t got enough brain cells for your fancy talk even when you haven’t been screwing my brains out for an hour.”
Castiel knows it's the feral side of his nature talking now.  Dean most likely doesn't understand what his actions mean to a vampire -- male semen, female lubrication -- they are some of the strongest scent markers in the human body besides blood.  By leaving the mix to slowly penetrate his skin, Dean is telling any and all that he belongs completely to Castiel right down to the very way he smells.  He's offering up his free will on a very delectable platter.  Dean gasps as the bond between them suddenly pulls tight, like a strap being ratcheted down.  Castiel grips Dean's chin and forces their gazes to meet.  He lifts Dean up and settles him on the counter.  His Feeder's erection is stretching the briefs he wears.  Castiel's rational mind reminds him that Dean is new to the ways of vampires -- it could be that Dean's hunger merely overrode his need to clean himself.  Castiel tells his rational mind to fuck off.  His - oh yes,
Don’t get too used to this ... my muse is a fickle being who takes great glee in dumping ideas where once there was only dust.
Castiel will almost certainly make an appearance to retrieve his Feeder. It’s anybody’s guess how Dean will take being liberated but Bobby suspects it won’t be pretty. If Dean laid hands on
him. He’s not even half a decade old ... you didn’t think it strange he agreed to enter my territory?”
"You haven't lied yet so I guess I can give you that much," Dean replies.  "But I'm not gonna be held responsible if I pass out or puke, ok?  You've been warned."
again. He’s finally found someone who wants him and isn’t going to leave him. Why the hell would he ever give that up?  His entire life he’s been the caretaker but whoever took care of
Sam surges upright. His tall frame is imposing but Balthazar doesn't back down. “Am I supposed to feel better about this because your family is one of the what ... half a percent in bounty-hunters that don't 'accidentally' kill their targets?” Sam's sightless eyes stare directly at Baltazar. “And just because you didn't kill them ... that means
Dean can't even see Castiel moving but he knows the vampire did because the plate is pulled out of the air neatly capturing the omelet.  It's placed on the countertop before an arm pulls him upright with the added bonus of jerking him hard against Castiel's torso and right into the vampire's face.
“I see ... well ... he's gone, you say? Cassie won't be happy to hear that, I'm afraid,” Balthazar murmurs.
Dean hops out of the truck with a wince but he only goes as far as the front door, waiting for the vampire who’s destroyed his life to help him upstairs. Dean wakes up screaming for Sam but Castiel doesn’t appear to comfort him.  Dean feels oddly bereft.
Castiel throws his head back and laughs again but this time Jake shivers at the black madness rippling through the sound.  He jolts when the vampire’s head snaps forward and twin blue flames focus on him.
Castiel chuckles grimly. “Yes. Not only did I massacre everyone in my hometown, I brought death and suffering to innocents.”  He glances over at Sam. “And I did not care.”
Dean blinks owlishly at the vampire, then an image of cargo pants appears in Castiel’s head. He sighs.  Going to the dresser, he finds a worn – honestly, is
Sam puts the money down on the counter, grabs the bag and stands. “Sorry to hear that ... you can tell Castiel that Dean is gone ... and I very seriously doubt he'll be coming back to this place any time soon.”
“It means I can hunt there if necessary. Comes in handy if pickings are lean but the way you humans treat each other, they rarely are.”
Dean manages a wan smile.  The clerk's surname is Studebaker if the embroidered patch on his faded, wrinkled state-issued uniform is to be believed.  No doubt he considers himself quite the wit; Shakespeare of the South Dakota correctional system.  Dean focuses on shaking out the manila envelope holding everything he walked into hell with fifteen years ago.  It keeps him from flipping the Bard off.  He doubts they could put him back in for that but Dean's not taking any chances.  He looks down at a leather wrist-band, his wallet with a very out-of-date drivers license, four dollars and -- Dean chuckles flatly -- an expired condom.  He gives the envelope a final jerk and out tumbles a necklace.  It's not much - a gold-colored amulet on a black faux leather cord but out of everything, this possession means the most to him.  He slips it over his head, happy to feel the slight weight against his sternum as he moves.
Castiel was long gone, had been on the way out the minute he'd met Dean.  Leaving the Omega behind had simply been the final farewell.  He wipes his eyes and idly wonders what his mother would think of his pup, Jack.
Dinner is fun. Dean likes the atmosphere at the Roadhouse. The steaks are amazing and he knows the owner, Benny. Benny comes over to say hello during their meal.
Castiel parks his truck inside the small attached garage and grins.  "Of course not ... she's mine."
Dean swallows hard and turns to look at the young man.  Instantly he feels his entire consciousness slide into a hazy sort of limbo when the blue eyes lock on him.  It doesn't hurt and he's not afraid but it's disorienting and confusing.
Mike approaches the frozen vampire with a dismissive wave.  He crouches in front of Dean and frowns when the human squeezes his eyes shut with a whimper.  "Look at me, Dean."
The pilot, who'd ignored Dean until this point, curiously looks over at the man.  Before Dean can even draw another breath, he's on his back with a long, wicked looking blade pressed against his neck.  The sound that Castiel makes is one Dean hopes he
Balthazar looks over with a smile and deliberately plants a kiss on Benny's cheek.  "I'm sure it'll be divine as everything else you make, darling."
“No, Jacob. I was not like you. I did not choose to be what I am. My path was made when Ashe threw himself on my charred husk and drained what little remained in my veins. He filled me with his venom and then his blood and I became the darkest of all angels.”
Sam frowns at the table, his hands now tight fists clenched before him. Mary glances over and shakes her head sadly while the milk warms.
squeak thank you very much - until he's laying back against Castiel's chest.  He's about to protest when he feels the vampire's fangs slide into his neck and the familiar warmth begins to flow over him.
Dean Winchester is four and asleep in his bed.  He wakes to his father dragging him out of bed and pushing his baby brother into his arms.  Sam is only six months old.  Dean feels his father’s fear but he can’t feel his mother.
Sam has been researching the connections between claimed Feeders and their vampire. Lore says the link between the pair is built from the consistent feeding of the vampire. Telepathic bonds often form and the older the vampire, the stronger the ability to hear human minds. Knowing this, Sam
Sam leans back on the railing. “1659 … an entire township was butchered. Everyone thought it was local native tribes —“
Castiel enjoys the look of near-rapture on Dean's face while he eats the dessert. They leave not long after and Dean drives Castiel home. He doesn't want to push things ... he really likes Castiel's company.
Dean takes the hand that's resting against his chest and looks at it.  It's larger than his own with long digits jointed in a way Dean's pretty sure doesn't occur in nature.  The skin enclosing those fingers is dark, almost black.  What's inside him pulses with heat and then a long, whip-like tail suddenly slithers between Dean's legs to wrap itself around his sack.  Dean moans softly and remembers eyes that burned like coals, wings that blotted out the light.  He taps a fingertip against a razor sharp obsidian talon.
Sam bites back a groan.  Walking the yard means going around the entire salvage yard, making sure the gates are locked and the fence hasn’t been cut.  It takes twice as long because Dean can’t link with Sam to help him “see” so they have to go slow so that Dean can lead his brother with spoken direction.  Sam can't really do anything except help Dean with repairing the fence since he can't use his ability.
of all people … Bobby groans and takes another drink. The house has wards and every defense they can think of; it now even boasts a holding cell built to contain Dean until they can break the vampire’s thrall. Taking down a centuries old predator like Castiel is just part and parcel of their lives but Dean’s intervention … it pains Bobby to take away something that seems to make Dean so happy even if it’s also so very, very bad for him.
Mike snorts while Harvey rolls his eyes.  "Oh, I think Harvey paid his dues with me ... but that's a story for another time."  He stands and rubs his hands together.  "Now then ... everyone out but Dean.  We need to have a quick chat."
Dean's hands are clamped over his ears now even though he knows that won't stop the barrage of condemnation.  "I'm sorry sorry sorry!  Sorry!  I didn't mean it ... I didn't mean it!  I didn't mean to do bad, Daddy!  I'll be good, I'll be good, don't leave me, Daddy ... please don't leave me ... please come back ... please come back, Daddy!  I'll be good ... I'll be good ... I'll be good ... I'll be good ..."
Castiel takes the chair nearest Dean.  He teasingly runs his hand through Dean's hair as he passes gaining a soft huff as the human repairs the damage.  It’s tempting to do more but for now Dean's warmth and his lovely hops scent go a long way toward calming Castiel.  He turns when a well-hidden door opens.  On his feet again in a flash, Castiel smiles widely at the new addition.  He's known Harvey Specter for nearly all his Dark life.  The fellow vampire introduced Castiel to the automobile and set off his lifelong love of anything on wheels.
“You’re mute?”  The boy nods.  Bobby sighs.  He taps his temple.  “Tell me … but keep the volume down.”
The smell of bacon drags Dean upright and into the shower. He barely even notices the healing punctures, bruises and slashes that cover his body these days. He’s lived with some form of physical injury all his life since his dad began the quest for revenge when Dean was four. The marks he wears now come from a possessive vampire who likes to make sure Dean knows who he belongs to - just in case it might slip the former Hunter’s mind.  Dean barely remembers how he came by most of them but he’s pretty darn sure he enjoyed himself.
The door to the diner opens and a tall man with light blue eyes and dark blonde hair walks in – Balthazar. He glances around and frowns at Sam. Walking over, he taps Sam on the shoulder.
Dean moans softly. It’s been nearly a month since the call with Bobby … since he accepted that his family, the only ones he’s ever known, think he’s either lost his mind or been brainwashed by a vampire, probably both.  In that time, Dean has decided that while he loves Bobby and his little brother with all that he is - damn if this didn’t hurt to admit - he doesn’t
.”  Castiel chuckles. “The legends tell of a night that filled the woods with the howls of demons and all the denizens of Hell.”  He sighs. “I never let Nicholas touch me again. He was my Sire and I learned all he could teach until I no longer needed him.”
”And you?  Why should I take the word of an infamous Hunter, Dean?  Why are you still with Castiel?”
Dean cries silently when he feels two sudden snaps against his mind, like rubber bands being popped.  The sensation is followed by the worst emptiness he’s ever known in his short life.  He tries to hold onto the links that were once there – that once represented his mommy and daddy, but as he gets closer, the black tries to pull him into it.  Dean falters.  He’s only four and not strong enough to resist the death pull of another mind.
Dean throws the remnant of his sandwich in the trash and finishes off his Coke before the horn blows. Garth notices that his silent friend has suddenly gone even more quiet – if that were possible. Garth sees it happen sometimes. Mark’s face will fall and a shadow crosses over the handsome features. He knows Mark will be in a zone for the rest of the day. Garth wonders whose memory makes Mark look so sad.
The mist suddenly clears and Dean finds himself still kneeling beside Castiel.  Mike stands beside Jessica again watching him impassively.  The link bursts into life again and all Dean can feel is Castiel's worry ... but not about how Dean behaved.  It's about whether or not
Castiel slowly extends his hand and gently takes the trembling arm. He lowers it and Dean suddenly hunches his shoulders, bracing for another blow.  Castiel blinks realizing that Dean truly thinks the entire episode was his fault and he expects to be punished accordingly.  Something twists inside the vampire but he quashes it just a swiftly as he had the memory earlier.  Leaning down, Castiel picks Dean up and puts him back on the bed, ignoring the soft moan of pain.  He examines Dean quickly, finding broken ribs to add to the leg injury.
Dean now sees the strong hands moving to touch him, to check his pulse and keep him still.  He remembers those hands.  Remembers when they touched him three years ago with no intent of keeping him still.  He blinks.  It
“Yes, and poor innocent Sammy just can’t say ‘no’ to big brother … that about it?” Ellen says as she puts away the groceries.  “Just for that, you can both do the dishes,” Ellen says.  She regards them with a stern eye.  “And then you can both do the walk through the shop and yard.”
Sam sighs. He acted like Dean's movie references annoyed him, but he loves his brother's enthusiasm about things – music, movies, life in general. He misses his big brother far more than he ever thought he would.
Dean winces.  “Yikes, don’t remind me.”  He looks at Cas. “Makes that warehouse where we met look practically sterile.”
Castiel opens his mouth and then closes it.  His back and ass are telling him just how not happy they are about things right now and he shifts uncomfortably.  He opens his mouth again and what falls out he blames on the bone-deep exhaustion of the day in general.
Castiel nods. He does know what Dean means. He's been used to being treated like a fragile piece of china as though not being able to hear makes him physically unable to deal with the world around him.
The sound of his own voice surprises Castiel. He examines his emotions and finds he truly doesn’t want Dean to feel like he’s failed in some way.  It’s unsettling after so many years of trying to find new ways to toy with the mortals that surround him.  He forces himself to focus on getting Dean dressed which turns out to be a little bit more of a trial than expected.  The shirt goes on easily enough although Castiel can’t stop the wince when he sees the fresh bruises on Dean’s back and the darkening along one side from the broken ones.  He checks again and doesn’t feel any jagged edges threatening his Feeder but it makes him a little more anxious.  Unfortunately, Dean’s leg cast, while far thinner and more flexible than a traditional plaster cast, fights the narrow leg of Dean’s jeans.  The human is so doped on Castiel’s feeding, he can’t provide much constructive help although he’s very compliant as Castiel struggles to work his leg into the inflexible denim.  He also bites back whimpers when the movements jar his abused ribs.  Castiel is grateful for that at least even though he can feel Dean’s pain beginning to brighten.
Benny Lafitte doesn't share any DNA with Dean but as his uncle Bobby once told him, family don't end in blood.  They shared a cell for seven of Dean's fifteen years.  It hadn't been fast friends the minute they met but shared trials in hell brought them to an uneasy trust.  That morphed into a friendly alliance and eventually became a connection Dean knows will last their lifetimes.  As Benny leaves the lot, Dean slumps in his seat.  One hand runs down his face.
Dean holds up the phone and Castiel’s eyes light up which Dean finds intriguing and very attractive.
Dean lifts his tender appendage out of the water.  Castiel examines it and nods.  His eyes shift to Dean.  "Looks as though my feedings have enhanced your body's healing process.  The cut should be completely healed by tomorrow morning."
Dean hurts worse now than he did after the Caesarean that gave him Jack to begin with but, like then, the pain is dulled by the joy Dean feels seeing his son. Unfortunately, the emotion is short-lived as Jack's eyes focus on Dean and a whimper escapes.  The little boy immediately burrows into the jacket and turns away.  Sam pauses and runs a large hand over his nephew's back while the tousled mop shakes back and forth.  Dean's Omega instincts scream at him to protect and comfort but he knows the way he looks now and his garbled speech are the reason his baby is frightened. It still breaks his heart knowing that in three years of  tantrums and full-on meltdowns Jack has never refused Dean's embrace.  Tears spill over but as Dean prepares to wave his brother and son away, Sam holds up a finger.
“Vampires take the essence of their Sires when turned. My early history is soaked in blood as you know. When I was human I was strong and independent but I couldn’t have struck a man dead even to save my own life. Nicholas Ashe betrayed me to my village. My … predilections … were an instant death sentence.”
Sam is thrown back when Castiel slams into him, fangs buried deep in his throat. Broken leg forgotten, Dean shoves himself off the pile of debris and crashes to the floor with a shout of pain and desperation.
The vampire smiles.  He feels the tension building under Dean's casual mask.  "I told you, I like my creature comforts as well as my solitude.  Besides ... do
”Castiel has reason enough for that but he hunts discreetly when he chooses to,” Mike says softly.  He meets the Hunter’s eyes again.  “Castiel took you as his Feeder to humiliate you.”
“You’ve grown quite attractive since last I saw you, Jake. I’m surprised. I didn’t think Nick kept his boys so long,” Castiel taunts.  “You were barely old enough to shave when I met you.”
Dean groaned.  “Come on, Cas! You know I’m not looking forward to that either but I’m not about to have sex with you while my little brother is sleeping down the hall!”
Dean shakes his head, afraid that Castiel is trying to delay him until he can call someone. He tries to back away again but Castiel catches his wrist.
“What the —“ Bobby’s question dies in his throat when Castiel looks at them. The expression of utter devastation makes something in the old Hunter’s chest clench.
Castiel looks up, surprised. A quick brush of his Feeder’s thoughts and he knows Dean’s emotions are true even if he’s riding the high of a feeding.  He’s turned on and if it confuses him, the human isn’t shying away.  Castiel lets his fingers travel up the soft underside of Dean’s arm.  A shiver ripples through the human.  Their eyes meet and Dean’s eyes are like river moss.  Castiel lets his free hand glide over the skin just above Dean’s beltline and smiles when the human’s hips arch up into the touch.  He feels a dull ache travel between them – Dean’s injuries are still too fresh for what Castiel would like to do.  Still … he presses Dean back down.
.  The conversation had ebbed and flowed along without effort until the sky had lightened and Castiel had leaned in with a questioning expression.  Dean gave him that fucking crooked smile of his and Castiel was gone.  Seven months and one shared heat later, Castiel had known that he was worse than gone -- he was never coming
to Dean -- regardless of whatever went on between you two, Jack is the result and he's what matters here.  Please don't take him away."
Dean releases whatever death-grip he holds on his inhibitions and they float away. Cool air and then pain brush over him – Dean feels the latter only for a moment before a hot mouth covers his cockhead.  Dean whimpers at the sting that worsens as the suction grows – it’s the exact perfect blend of pain and pleasure.  His world narrows to the juncture of his legs and Dean opens his eyes to see.  Castiel raises his head and swirls his tongue around Dean’s tip, painting it shiny red.  Dean’s mouth falls slackly open as his climax claims him.  The wonderful sucking returns as his body shudders in waves pulling him from one peak to another until he’s a trembling, pulsing mess of heat and need.
Sam looks up when he hears the floorboard just outside the nursery creak. He gives his mother a wan smile. Mary’s fingertips twine through his hair and out again as she glides past to Jack’s bedside. An amber night light in the shape of a bunny glows softly on the nightstand. Mary
Dean stands and walks to the shaded window.  He leans back on a table set there and crosses his arms.
Dean would answer if all the blood that Castiel isn't currently pulling out of his vein was headed for his brain instead of all parts south of his navel.  He tries to gather the frayed ends of his thoughts together but he can't seem to follow any of them to an end.  Heat is pooling between his thighs and Dean dimly realizes that Castiel read between the lines -- he knows how fragile Dean feels, how all his walls are down and the writhing mass of his mind and emotions is exposed.  He knows and he's just offered his Feeder an out.  If Dean gives in, they'll pick up right where they left off that morning before everything went pear-shaped.  Dean's mouth falls slackly open as Castiel's savage desire begins slicing into their bond.  Dean suddenly understands something else ... he's not the only one bared to the world.  His vampire all but directly admitted that he might be feeling the same confusing attraction.  Tiny tendrils of uncertainty slither around Castiel's thoughts.
“You know me better, brother. My name in this village is good but blush can be put on any man if his ways are not known to any and all,” Castiel says tightly.  “No fool am I, Gabriel.  Bad enough I associate with low men –“
Suddenly the tension bleeds out of the room and Bobby does introductions and handshakes with John and Sam.  Castiel notices Jack and his eyes widen.
“Well then, Jacob. I suppose if I’m to die regardless … it won’t make any difference if I peel the flesh from your body first, will it?”
Castiel rolls his eyes and shoos Dean to the island. “Thank goodness my skills as a chef are decent enough to gain your affection.”
Sam’s mind tries to make sense of what he’s hearing while his heart twists painfully at the sounds coming from Bobby.
As Dean reaches another cluster of equipment and ducks between them, wood flooring explodes upward in front of the being following him. An angry screech fills the air and a blast of debris-filled dirt kicked up by powerful muscles pumping wings toward the upper levels blinds Dean. He curses and races for his shotgun, snatching it from the ground and racking it one-handed. The entire purpose of his mad dash through the warehouse maze had been to draw the creature away from the only other human in the building – his younger brother.
A muscle in Castiel’s jaw jumps but he remains on the last step, hands clasped before him. Dean, unable to keep his temper now, stomps down the stairs when he sees Sam warming up for another outburst.
Her voice is innocently calm but Castiel can see sparks flashing in the light hazel eyes looking directly at him.  He now knows what a deer feels like with a car bearing down on it.  Castiel sinks into a chair.  He swallows hard but the bands around his chest don't ease.  The Alpha rests his elbows on his knees and slumps.
“No!” Castiel says urgently. “I came only to warn before I fled.  Say nothing of my presence here, I was seen by none.  The dark will hide my flight and I will –“
He sits in the back so he faces the entire diner.  It helps him keep from being startled when someone approaches, although he can usually tell by the vibrations in the floor.  The door opens and Castiel finds himself staring, something he never does because he hates it when people do it to him.  A tall man with short-cropped dark blonde hair walks in and sits at the counter.  At first glance, Castiel thought he was quite handsome.  When the man signs at the waitress, Castiel thinks his heart might stop altogether.  He shoves a knife off the table where it falls in total silence to him, but heads turn from the sound before going back to whatever they were doing.  Castiel tries not to be disappointed that the newcomer glances over at him.
embarrass me in front of the Council, Dean ... I will strip the skin from your precious Bobby while you listen to his screams.  Sam will not be turned because I keep my word but I promise you he will take a very long time to die."
or not - Cas is opening his home to you on my behalf. If you can’t drop the attitude while you’re here and maybe hear
"Dean ... ha ha ... Dean, I'm sorry.  No, wait, ha ha ha ... I'm really am ..." Castiel gasps as Dean stalks past the shaking vampire and down the stairs.
“Dean, you may want to ease up a bit?  I think Sam is turning blue,” Castiel suggests with no little amusement.
Dean walks down the sidewalk looking down at his phone. He never asks for phone numbers – usually people just give them to him. Castiel is different and Dean wonders why – it's not often he's attracted to a guy. Certainly not
“Do not presume to know our family, Sam ... nor why we went into the 'business',” Castiel says softly.
Castiel pauses because any painful action he might take pales next to what he does to Dean in the boundaries of their sexual relationship. Dean, sensing the vampire’s consternation, offers his best smirk.
of Alphas.  His brain slowly releases a memory and it drifts to the top.  The car accident ... the grille of the tractor-trailer growing larger and larger ... Dean whimpers.
[Dean ... ] Castiel abandons signing to move across the seat into Dean's personal space. Dean leans forward to meet the lips he's wanted to kiss for a week now. He feels Castiel's sudden concern that he's moving too quickly ... that he'll scare Dean off. Dean pulls apart with a smile and a gentle thumb against the corner of Castiel's mouth. He's trying to convey all the calm in the world ... like Castiel just did the absolute perfect thing – which Dean thinks he did, actually.
Dean’s hands come up and he tugs at the vampire’s shirt. Castiel startles and looks at the Feeder.  The pupils are blown again and just a little wild – Dean is falling too far into the feeding.  Reluctantly, Castiel pulls Dean’s hands off him.  The soft whimper nearly undoes his resolve.
“Dean!  Would you sing to yourself?  I’m trying to study!  And turn the radio down!  I’m blind, not deaf!” Sam yells out the back door.  His brother’s legs stick out from beneath his car, a ‘67 Impala.
Dean feels the vampire's hand slide into his hair. When the fingers tighten, he winces but manages to keep his eyes shut. Castiel's breath is hot against the shell of his ear and when the vampire speaks again, it's like a thousand ants march directly down Dean's ear canal into his brain.
Balthazar Novak is the absolute last person Dean would have imagined as Benny's soulmate.  He's British, for one thing; his accent is crisp and precise where Benny's is soft and blended.  He also talks.  A lot.  Benny tends to keep his statements short and sweet but Balthazar can go on and on about nearly anything.  And while Benny gives the benefit of the doubt to anyone and everyone, Balthazar has a biting comment about most people and he isn't shy to offer his opinion on any topic.
Dean's eyebrows crawl up his forehead when they reach a private aircraft hangar and he sees a sleek, white jet sitting on the tarmac.  He looks over at Castiel with wide eyes.  "Really?  You chartered a Gulfport G550?"
As he begins to relax and fall, another link asserts itself.  This one isn’t strong either, but it’s persistent and demanding.  Sammy.  Dean blinks and opens his eyes.  His little brother is trembling in his arms and Dean remembers what his daddy said – the little mind tugs at his and Dean is able to pull away from the dark and let the silence take his parent’s thoughts away.  Sammy stops trembling and the link in his head fills with relief and love and trust.  Sam’s a baby so his thoughts aren’t formed yet … they’re just emotions and sensations but Dean’s mind has been linked to Sammy’s since he was still in their mommy’s tummy.  He understands.
The full-face smile Castiel was most fond of broke free at this.  Dean leaned down and murmured, “All of ‘em.”
Castiel's eyes dart back to the other vampire but instinct tells him this man anything but 'another vampire'.  For the first time in centuries, Castiel feels uneasy.  A sudden weight presses against his side and Castiel looks down to see Dean’s bowed head. He automatically threads his fingers into the human’s hair, grateful for the steady beat of Dean’s heart.  After everything that just passed, his Feeder finds a way to settle him.
”Yeah,” Dean agrees uncomfortably.  “But it’s not like that anymore ... he’s, I dunno ... different.”
Mary takes a deep, breath and forces herself to calm.  Alpha tempers are quick at the best of times.  Under stress, an Alpha can fly into a full-blown Rage with the slightest provocation.  She exhales slowly and walks away from Castiel to the other side of the room before coming back.  She sits down and motions Castiel back to his chair.  The younger man drops into the seat tiredly.
Castiel regrets his temper the minute Dean leaves his grip. His fingers wiggle in empty air as he tries to catch Dean’s leg.  Castiel appears beside his injured Feeder a moment later, anxiously reaching out to check for damage.  Dean flinches, his scent fearful.  Castiel leans toward him again and Dean pulls away with a soft whimper that isn’t all physical pain.  The vampire feels a very unfamiliar twinge of guilt.
Sam snorts and waves dismissively. “Dean had to hide me from everyone until I was old enough to do it for myself. If we hadn't been found by Bobby we would have been tagged and sent God-knows-where – sent by someone like
Dean blinked as images of himself gagged and restrained filled his mind.  A random vision of Castiel compelling him not to make a sound had him hard and the scent of his sharp arousal permeated the air.  Dean whimpered before he shook his head to clear it.
Dean snorts.  “I’m a former Hunter talkin’ to the king of the vampires like he’s my therapist and you want to talk dysfunction?”
Mary allows Sam to change the topic - her pup has never liked to dwell on what he considers a weakness.  She sighs and nods.
Dean glances down at himself and frowns. He gives himself a tentative sniff.  “Dude, I’ve been in bed for like a week –“
Dean chuckles. He rubs the back of his neck and then signs. [Good to know. Do you want to maybe get dinner sometime?]
The doctor rolls her eyes.  "Do all the men in your family have this ability to look so pathetic to get your way?"
Mike nods.  "I know.  As First, I can see every vampire in the entire world.  The ones that hunt indiscriminately are like black threads on a white blanket.  They look out of place and they destroy the purity of the fabric."  He slides a thumbnail down the label and it parts neatly to fall away.  Dean shivers at the red gleam in Mike’s eyes.  “I don’t have patience with them and I don’t give them any mercy.”  He smiles and his eyes clear with a blink.  “Harvey says it’s because I’m too close to my human life. It makes me ‘soft’ toward them.”
Dean reluctantly lets Castiel carry him back into the house and plant him on the couch in front of the TV. The vampire stalks out, muttering something about hell being an easier choice than humans and Dean finds himself alone.  He limps into the kitchen to pilfer some ibuprofen, cheese puffs and a beer before going back out to the living room.  The TV is huge and very modern but somehow Castiel has managed to make it blend in with the rest of the house.  He picks up the remote and starts flipping through channels before dozing off.
Castiel growls. “You made your choice when you came after me, Dean.  I barely knew who you were before you showed up on my doorstep trying to kill me.  Now, I’m all that’s between you and death.  Embarrass me and I might spare you but I’ll turn Sam first.  Embarrass the Council and they’ll paint you with the blood of your precious brother and anyone else you love before tearing you apart.”
Sam springs to his feet. The table wobbles and his mug tumbles over, spilling coffee over the surface and off to the deck. “Wait, what?! You never —“
Benny walks off laughing. Dean sits down with a roll of his eyes. [He's a flirt but a good guy all the same.]
Castiel smirks in return.  "I might offer the same to the First ... with all due respect, of course."
The slightest shift in the air currents is all the warning Castiel gets. With a snarl he spins, talons out blocking the strike that probably would have taken his head. The long blade sails away to embed itself in the far wall.
Bobby just looks at him. Dean’s love life has never been more than a night or two with a woman. Bobby knows he has been with men even if Dean thinks he’s kept it secret. It makes sense … Dean’s ability allows him to be attracted to more than just the physical so it wouldn’t make any difference male or female. Of course, Bobby suspects that’s also why he won’t stay with anyone – he can see beyond the façade people put up for the world. What he sees isn’t always so nice, according to the little Dean says about it
you, Sam. To him, you are worth any risk, any sacrifice - it was nothing for him to give up his life if it meant that you and Bobby were safe. When that sacrifice morphed into something else between he and I … you crushed him when you attacked the one thing he claimed for himself. He was inconsolable after I returned from bringing you home.  How can you call yourself his family?  Family accepts and loves without conditions or judgement.”
For as long as he's been a vampire, Castiel has never found himself so lost in a human's gaze.  The hazel-green eyes are full of trust and the emotions flowing into their bond are calm with a bit of anxiety born of Dean's desire to represent Castiel well.  Lifting Dean's hand, Castiel presses his lips to the calloused knuckles and walks out behind Jessica and Harvey.
Castiel lowers Dean into one of the plush chairs and is gratified to see his Feeder straighten and brush himself off.  Dean runs a shaky hand through his hair and slowly gathers himself.  Mike pours water into a crystal cut glass and offers it to the human.
Dean knows he's taking an enormous risk but he can't bring himself to care or to quit. He wants Castiel to know nothing but the bliss he's feeling himself. He wants this to be the best night of Castiel's life. He gives over to sensation as he thrusts steadily into his lover, letting the wave build until it crashes over both of them. Castiel's back arches and he calls Dean's name hoarsely. He's still riding the surge when he hears it.
The man eyes them and then says, "My name is Castiel ... Castiel Novak.  I'm ... I helped get Dean out of his car today.  I just wanted --"
Mary turns from straightening bed clothes to see her son in tears. Outwardly, he’s six-foot-four and twenty-three but Sam’s misery wipes all the intervening years away to leave him as young and vulnerable as his sleeping nephew. With the deftness of a mother who has raised two sons to adulthood and become a protective grandmother, Mary tucks Jack back under covers and presses a soft kiss against his forehead. She tugs Sam to his feet and steers him down the hall to the kitchen.
“As much as I love a good family drama, there's a small matter of which one of you is going to die today,” the vampire says coolly.
A small flare of anger burns through Sam but it flickers out almost as fast. He runs a hand down his face.
Wherein we see Castiel’s version of therapy — be warned — my muse is also a crazed freak and has a serious blood/sex kink.  If blood triggers you ... why are you reading a vampire fic in the first place?!?
has receded and Dean doesn't currently seem to be in danger of coming apart at the mental seams.  He gestures at the tub.  "May I help you?"
Victor is a blur and then his snarling face is inches from Dean's.  His harsh copper breath makes Dean want to gag.  "After I learned the other side was real, I wanted to follow in your footsteps ... to actually make my life
Dean takes a deep breath.  He feels Castiel’s mind brush gently against his own and gratefully accepts the calming gesture.  With a slow exhale, Dean tries again.
"Not a big fan of the blood scent?  Took me a while to get used to that too when I was a Feeder," Mike says.
[Do you want to come inside?] Castiel signs and speaks in that wonderful gravel-laden voice that Dean hasn't heard nearly enough since they met. Dean nods and Castiel swallows hard. Dean feels uncertainty in Castiel's mind. He cups the man's cheek and meets the blue eyes that caught his attention the first day.
His boy feels things first and strongly with his emotions. Then, when the tempest is past, he ponders and considers things in a way that reminds Dean of a young Sam. Dean never fails to be astonished at just how much data those damnable brilliant blue orbs record. Like now, as the small head cocks to one side and Jack’s eyes narrow, regarding Dean curiously but no longer fearfully.
For his own part, Dean is pretty certain whatever brain cells he still possessed after a lifetime of getting body slammed, punched, clawed, and drunk to dull the pain have effectively melted out his ear.  He's never been so turned on in his entire life and he is
Dean shudders when heat and desire flows over his mind. He gives over his will without a thought and sinks gracefully to his knees. His Master snarls triumphantly.
Sam swallows his protest.  He's heard his nephew in tears before but those were never like this -- not even when he had a mammoth ear infection last year.  The sound of the boy's grief now is more ... desolate.  Omega parents supposedly have a bond that connects them to their offspring in a way no other parent does but Sam's never really believed that until right this minute.  He blows out a shaky breath.
Faces he doesn’t know swim in and out of his line of sight. Voices overlap and the incessant peak of an electronic alarm is about to send Dean into a psychotic break. Something tugs at his skin, pulling at it until it reluctantly breaks free followed by the most horrific sensation Dean’s ever had — something sliding up his throat. Irrational terror washes over him as he watches a tube that never seems to end slowly exit his body. Just at the foot of the bed Dean sees Sammy. He’s got a pained expression on his face but it’s not fear or concern.  No, Dean realizes it’s because because the little cuss is trying not to
Sam jerks awake.  Something dragged him from the first real sleep he’s gotten in days. He strains to hear against the quiet of the house when it hits him … the house is quiet. He frowns. Sam grew up in Bobby’s house. He shared this very room with Dean for their entire childhood. It’s old, the Singer house. It creaks and groans and complains like a person with more darkness and blood seeped into its boards than even Sam cares to consider. It’s drafty and one of the living room windows leaks in the rain no matter how many times they recaulk it but it is
Castiel adds the shifting color of Dean’s furious eyes and his damnably long eyelashes to the list of physical attributes he likes about this human. He smirks after a while when Dean says nothing more.
Dean gives a wry grin.  "Hate to tell you this, Mikey, but there's a few of you out there who don't give a rats ass about all your sacredness -- they just want to drain whatever luckless human manages to stumble across their path.  We're
The medical staff stare at him like maybe he needs a psych consult but then Dean lifts his one good hand as far as the restraints will allow and shoots his sadistic little brother the bird. He never,
I could have told you your regular clothes are in the dresser.” Castiel opens a drawer and Dean sees his jeans and shirts clean and neatly folded.  He tosses an outfit to Dean.  “I’ll help you.”
"Shhh, my pretty Feeder ... no one else will ever touch you like this again.  Your blood, your body, your very breath is mine Dean Winchester.  No other will share my bed while you live, my lovely one.   And because I Feed from you, Death will not seek you out for a very, very long time. You are mine and I do not share."
"Why?" The voice asking the question is hoarse and it's only because Castiel's hearing is enhanced that he understands it.
Dean’s in Sam’s space before the younger man can blink.  He locks his arms around his brother’s torso in a tight bear hug and pounds his back affectionately.
Sam’s head snaps around when Dean’s fist connects.  Sharp lightning spears through his jaw and Sam knows he’ll be spitting out teeth when he gets up.  Trouble is, once he hits the ground, getting back up doesn’t feel like much of an option. The dark swallows him after that.
Balthazar frowns and pulls the buds from Sam’s ears … without using his hands. Sternly, he says, “Dean will be found, Sam. Without your family’s help, it just might be by my older brother, Michael. Worse yet, it might be by our associate, Zachariah.”
ready to head out.  Dean is coming down from the second feeding and Castiel can feel resentment bubbling just beneath the calm.  His own emotions are swirling between dark arousal and unexpected tenderness toward this human that barged into his life uninvited.  Castiel thinks he’s possibly bit off more than he can handle and that thought bothers him more than he wants to admit.
Dr. Barnes frowns but she lets the topic drop.  "Dean, I won't pull punches.  All that American-made steel saved your life but it's also responsible for most of your injuries.  You've got a long road ahead of you."  She glances at Sam.  "You also have one of the best support systems I've seen in a while.  Get some rest.  We'll talk next steps when you're a little stronger."
behind his submission to Castiel and even though the vampire made certain Dean was only capable of the very
Sam hears the woman begin the standard "They're doing everything possible --" and hangs up.  Rude, perhaps but right now he needs the one person he knows will bring order to the chaos of his mind -- his mom.  Mary's voice has always been a balm to his soul since she sang him to sleep the first night.  Sam folds to his knees and manages to croak out a request to his smart speaker.  Dean is hurt.  His brother is
Static hisses over Dean’s thoughts. His longtime defense mechanisms gave way under constant assault and out of desperation, Dean locked himself down. It’s a survival instinct he learned early in life when his dad had too much to drink and the blows rained down like hail on his young body.
“As is normal for your livelihood, Castiel,” Gabriel protests. “It would be hard indeed to procure such supplies as this village is accustomed if you did you not deal with those that captain the ships.”
“Let go, Dean … you’re safe …” Castiel murmurs. The response is still hesitant even though Dean’s eyes are practically closed.  The vampire frowns trying to parse what will convince his Feeder to let this happen when it hits him.  He rolls his eyes but says the words anyway.  “He’s safe, Dean … Sam is safe and nothing is going to happen to him if you just let go.”
With a slight nod, Jack comes to some internal conclusion and swipes at his tear and snot covered face.  He wiggles and shifts in Sam's arms and leans out toward Dean, not in the least bit concerned that his uncle might drop him.  Pudgy hands grasp toward his parent and Dean hiccups as more tears break free.  Sam chuckles.
When Dean finds enough of his balls to pry one eye open, he finds Castiel sitting beside the tub with a stunned expression on his face.  "Fuck ... look, Cas just forget I said anything and --"
“They all fled … those fools who put fire to my mortal body. They ran but I found them. I found all of them and I did not leave one alive. Men, women … even the babes in their cradles … I drank until I was bathed in their crimson. I sucked their flesh white.
Castiel grins, showing off his fangs red with Dean's blood and enjoys the low moan that elicits.  "Maybe ... but we're making this up as we go, right?"
Images flit through Dean's mind unbidden.  The moment they met and the deal they made.  Sam's terrified expression.  Injuries inflicted by Castiel.  Dean's breakdown and submission.  The softer moments since that day when Dean feels safe.  Wanted.  Even desired.
Jack chooses this moment to whine irritably at the brothers and they fall fondly quiet. Dean tucks Jack a little closer and slips off to sleep bathed in the smell of peaches.
Dean looks around wild-eyed and then runs his hands over himself, starting at his throat. Castiel watches, amused, for a moment before standing with a sigh.
Castiel’s fingertip traces lightly across the human’s chest.  His claw tip opens a hair-thin line that bleeds a drop or two before healing. He smiles and enjoys the way the man’s face pales. Every vampire has a different Dark form. He’s been told that his is quite … unnerving.
"Really," Mike responds for Castiel, making the pair jump.  "Your first meeting was ... unorthodox ... to say the least."
is ok.  Something hot and hard lodges in Dean's throat and he presses his face against Castiel's thigh.  He lets his reassurance filter into the link but his own nerves about how he did leak through as well.
After the doctor leaves, Mary sends Jack home with Sam and John.  Bobby leaves too, promising to come the next day.  Castiel moves to leave too but Mary calls him back.
Only the slightest relaxing of Castiel’s shoulders betrays his relief that Dean is well. He smooths down his Feeder’s hair in a gentle pat.
Sam lets out a petulant sound but he unfolds his 6’4” frame and puts the laptop and book on the desk before walking into the kitchen.  Bobby goes upstairs to wash his hands.  Dean frowns for a minute and then winks at Sam.
Sam leans over and presses his forehead to Dean's.  All his life Dean has been there for him. He never groused about having to take a back seat to Sam and his seizures when he was little. He never treated Sam any differently because of his condition. Dean’s heart is enormous and always makes room for family no matter what. Now Sam can help pay some of that back.
The older boy’s lip quivers.  He opens his mouth, then closes it and shakes his head.  Bobby frowns and then his eyes brighten in understanding.
Dean tries and fails to shake his head so he manages, "N-na ... na pu' ... pup ... hom ... F'ammy -- F'ammy wa'sh--pu' ..."
When John Winchester finally got himself killed chasing actual and personal demons, Bobby made sure his boys knew they had a place to call their own. Maybe not a typical home but a safe space with family where they were always welcome. However, it looks like he’s failed again even in this.  Dean chooses to be — Bobby can’t consider what his adopted son lets that soulless monster do to him. He runs a hand down his face. He doesn’t understand how Dean considers being used for food and sex some form of love.  Bobby wonders how he missed the signs. He wonders if he ever knew to look for them.  Bobby shifts to pour more whiskey into the glass on his desk. He’s been hitting it harder since Dean was taken by Castiel and it’s been worse now that they await news of Dean’s extraction.
Mary's voice is, as always, light with a smile.  Sam's mouth twitches despite the situation.  He closes his eyes tightly against threatening tears.
Bobby looks down at the unseeing eyes.  “He’s blind?” Dean nods.  “So … you’re obviously a telepath.  What’s he?  Telekinetic?”
"Mr. and Mrs. Winchester, I'm Dr. Barnes and I led the team that just worked on your son.  Dean came through the surgery as well as can be expected.  The left side of his body sustained the worst damage -- broken ribs, arm, pelvis and femur.  Right now the biggest danger is infection from all the appliances we had to use to immobilize his skeletal structures.  Each day he'll be under strict surveillance and any visitors will have a strict infection protoccol to follow since his immune system is going to be working overtime to protect him,"  She runs a hand over her face, exhausted.  "Dean is young and strong.  He's given birth so his immune system is already stronger than it would have been otherwise.  I'm very optimistic but I want you to know what we're facing."
Dean’s hand is midway to his mouth to finish off the last bit of water when he’s pulled off the bed and pinned to the floor with Castiel latched onto his neck. He pushes weakly at the vampire but blood loss robs him of even the ability to do that after a moment.  Dean’s arms flop uselessly to the side as Castiel leans back.  He smiles down at the human who’s now even paler than before.  He runs fingertips down the long line of Dean’s torso and then along the waistband of his briefs.
"Not for lack of tryin' on my part, darlin'," Benny teases.  "Look, about Bal ... you know he lost his first soulmate young.  He had to watch all his Marks fade.  It's left scars that ain't healed yet."
Starting a little over a month ago, however, Dean began having nightmares the likes of which he's never experienced.  He relives the fire that took his parents only this time he fails to save Sam. Over and over again, he fails to stop the fire that sucks his infant brother away into the darkness.  Tonight, he followed the screaming baby into Hell which, what the hell is wrong with his brain? Still trembling, Dean runs a hand down his face and unsteadily makes his way to the kitchen.  The fridge light casts a yellow glow on his small kitchen while he pops open a beer. It's a little early to be drinking but these dreams rattle him too much. He needs to numb the edge of his fear before he starts his day.  With a belch, Dean finishes off the bottle in a few gulps. He kicks the fridge door shut and stretches. His apartment isn't much but it has a shower with decent water pressure which is calling his name.
Castiel licks along Dean's neck.  Goosebumps trail the dark red tongue.  "Your speech is as eloquent as ever, Dean.  I'm actually impressed with your stamina.  I didn't intend to fuck you senseless but once you were in my bed ... instinct took over.  Your taste is addictive."
“I bet,” the doctor comments. “Well, short story is the films look good.  The fractures should heal easily but you’ll need to stay relatively still while they do.”
He grunts in real-time and retreats, but not before leaving a tracker thread of his own. It will keep him tied to Dean even if he can’t mentally connect with the man. And if the blocking shields around Dean’s mind drop for even a nano-second, Balthazar will be able to prop the door open.
“I’m over 3 centuries old so get over it. I hate the way humans smell on a good day and you’d gone without a shower for a few days
That doesn’t exactly fit in with the entire ‘low profile’ we like to keep.  They’d be a liability.  If they do get turned, they usually don’t last past their first year – the Council destroys them before they reveal too much.”
Dean moves behind Castiel to a door toward the tail of the plane.  It leads to a bedroom with an honest to God king size bed, another tv and a bathroom with an actual bathtub.  Dean runs a hand over the butter soft sheets which remind him of the ones in Castiel's bed.  With a forced grin, Dean turns.  "What, you planning on fucking me the entire way to New York, Cas?"
Dean coughs around his swallow and drinks a large gulp of water. [Well, don't beat around the bush, Cas.]
With a weak snort of laughter, Castiel feels his eyes sting.  He blinks rapidly and exhales with a shudder.
Castiel smiles and Benny's eyebrows go up. [Well, would you look at that ... ] Benny gives Castiel his own intent gaze. [This clown manages to screw things up ... you come see me, handsome. Benny'll do right by ya.]
Castiel turns away from the stunned Feeder. His shoulders slump and the rage recedes into an soul-deep exhaustion. He speaks but his throat is hoarse and he is so very, very tired.
Sam, naturally, remembers none of this but the aftermath brought him his family and chronic Omega Drop Syndrome (ODS). The condition leaves Sam prone to severe emotional and physical collapses that can be life-threatening if left unchecked.  Meds help but Sam is forever going to need an anchor.  That’s been Dean or his parents, mostly Dean, his whole life. Even when Dean left home, he was faithful with letters and calls.  And the odd mixtape even though Sam tried to tell him no one actually uses cassettes anymore. He smiles at the memory of his brother’s affronted face that day. He blows out a breath.
Castiel tenses.  The fact that Mike appears less strict than the previous Council does not put him at ease with regard to punishment.  He hated Council meetings because one wrong move could earn you trouble enough to last even a vampire's life.  Dean is only a Feeder.  Mike could end him with a flick of his hand.  Harvey sips his scotch and shares a look with Mike.  When he looks back at Dean, his eyes have taken on their Dark aspect.  Dean cocks an eyebrow but doesn't look away.  Harvey's eyes return to human and he smiles into his glass.
Castiel’s fangs emerge. “If Dean has been turned, I would imagine he will be destroyed by our First.”
Knowing that Castiel wants Dean to take him, Dean pulls the man up and kisses him while rolling them both over. He's creating a feedback loop with their thoughts ... every time he touches Castiel, it echoes through both of them. Castiel doesn't know what's happening, only that whenever Dean's hands are on him he can barely think with how good it feels. When Dean preps him, they are both almost breathless with the need flaring through them. When Dean slides into Castiel's body, Castiel is fairly certain he stops breathing altogether.
to be overtly cruel to the man.  Fucking humans.  This is why he never wanted a Feeder.  He's grateful at least that he had other arrangements made for the flight before he learned of Dean's phobia.  They should come in handy.
After a few long minute click by, Dean feels disappointment kicking in. When enough time passes that Dean realizes there isn’t going to be a response, he glumly decides to drown his sorrows in another milkshake at the diner. Walking in he places his order with Beth and stares at the counter top.
“I’d learn some manners, Dean baby. You’re not the only one who can play semantics,” Castiel says silkily, running his tongue over fangs red with Dean’s blood.  “I’m bound by our laws to keep you alive and healthy for as long as you choose to be my Feeder.  I can keep you just like this, hooked to an I.V. for the rest of your natural life or you can learn how to submit to your master.  Your choice, handsome.”
Dean whines when Sam releases his hand. He’s been big brother since Sammy came to live with them but, in truth, the big girl means as much to Dean as anyone on the planet. Right up there with Jack. Despite his chronic drops, Sam is fearless when it comes to going after what he wants and Dean’s never been prouder of the kid. He’s also, whether or not Sam realizes it, the fiercest Winchester when family is on the line. Right now Dean needs that strength because he can’t move and it’s terrifying.
Dean's distracted mind has been a source of irritation for Bobby and a goldmine of teasing from Sam. It's also been a bit of a hazard ... Dean forgets who is around a couple of times at the shop and answers questions or fetches things that were never asked for out loud. Bobby, especially, hopes this date will quiet Dean's mind a little so he can focus.
to head-butt the vampire and take the chance that he won't compel Sam to fire the rifle. A blur of actions Dean
“I fear … I fear I must away and soon, brother. Dire things … oh the stroke of hell is upon me!” Castiel exclaims, his face falling into his hands.
“Your brother deserves a medal for putting up with you as long as he has,” Castiel snorts. “Elder brothers are always a pain in the ass.”
“Get your fucking hands off me, bloodsucker,” Dean snarls. “You got what you wanted.  I want to go to bed now.”
Dean hears two thundering blasts overhead and hopes against hope that Sam's aim was true. The shells hold sanctified pellets which won't kill it but they'll slow it down enough that they can cut the damn thing's head off and burn its putrid corpse. Dean looks up at a shout from Sam and barely has enough time to jump out of the way when broken beams come plummeting down to his level. Unfortunately, the floor gives way and Dean can't stop his fall. He lands heavily on the debris and screams when his leg breaks with a dull snap. Crippled, Dean struggles to push himself upright. Bright pain slices through his leg leaving Dean dizzy. He fights passing out because Sam is on his own against a being over 300 years old. Dean casts about, trying to find his lost shotgun but it might as well be invisible for all he can see in the dark and billowing clouds of dirt.
Castiel sends images into Dean’s brain then – images of Sam with his throat torn out and Bobby lying broken on the living room floor. He finds himself hating the grief-stricken howl that tears out of Dean
behind early in life.  But no, I restrict my hunting there to the less desirable members of your society.  I mean, who the hell cares if a drug dealer dies?  Someone who beats their partner?  Their children?  The odd serial killer?”
Dean falls quiet but his mental irritation tells Castiel he’s not falling into earlier patterns of guilt. He relaxes – pissed off human he can deal with far easier than the emotional rollercoaster of earlier.  Carter makes a notation on the chart.  “You can bring him back to me for a follow-up in a week if you follow the usual treatment.”
"Uh, yeah, you might wanna see about an eye appointment, Cassie -- you missed seven by a fucking mile," Gabriel snaps.
"Castiel is a real sweet guy but kinda scattered sometimes...he shot out of here so fast earlier he forgot his phone."
this for as long as Dean lasts.  He wonders if Dean will break when he realizes the vampire he's fallen for has played him.  That would be unfortunate but Castiel reminds himself again --
It's an easy fix -- Dean's stitched himself up before and that was a gunshot.  This is nothing.  The pale edges of the wound well up with blood that finds escape and drips to the floor.  Dean feels like a boulder sits on his chest.  The link is silent.
“Dean, you’ve straightened that bedspread fifty times … I think it goes without saying that it looks fine.”
Mary covers her mouth and holds the sleeping baby a little tighter.  "You poor thing -- no, he stays with me during the day while Dean is at work."
Remember the muscle car his father had bequeathed to him brings a sharp sting to Dean’s eyes. He supposes Sammy has the car now and he hopes the kid takes good care of her.  At least Castiel lives outside Sioux City – Dean is grateful to be at least
Dean feels Sam's distress like a hand closing around his heart. Dean pulls his mind away. For the first time in their entire lives, the Winchester brothers are not linked. Sam feels the darkness he lives in grow cold and lonely.
for Dean Winchester.  Castiel chides himself.  Dean's lifespan, even lengthened by being a Feeder, will still be a blip on the radar of Castiel's life.  Dean is a pet, nothing more.  Castiel repeats this silently to himself, careful not to let it seep into the link.  He drinks from Dean, he fucks Dean, he maintains Dean's health ... it can never be more than that because Dean is only a
"Cas, I really didn't mean to --"  The vampire looks over with an arched eyebrow and Dean groans.  "This is too fucking weird, Cas."
“Your little brother is alive and well with Bobby Singer as promised. When I dropped him off, I clarified our agreement with the old man.  For your sake and that of young Sam, I hope they’re smart enough to hold to it,” Castiel says.  “I won’t lie to you, Dean.  If you follow my rules, your life is assured for as long as you draw breath and your brother will remain human.  Now rest.  You’ll be a few days recovering from what I’ve taken from you.”
Dean's eyes dart everywhere while he tries to find an escape route.  A soulless chuckles jerks his gaze back to the intruder.
Sam gives a watery laugh and nods. He kisses his mother good night and dreams of laughing green eyes and the scent of cedar - Dean’s scent - and everything is ok for the moment.
Dean's voice would be barely audible to a human but Castiel hears it clearly.  He feels the tension rush out of Dean like a river as the human relaxes and gives in to the sleep that's been dragging at him for a while now.  Castiel doesn't have to sleep but he settles in to rest with Dean curled in the curve of his body.  The darkness will eventually fade and he'll be able to withdraw from his Feeder's body without causing undue damage.
Castiel’s eyes are devoid of emotion. “Your Brady was seduced and Turned by the same vampire that took me over 300 years ago … Nicholas Ashe.  I think you Hunters have nicknamed him ‘Lucifer’.  And now he has my Dean.”
[Old Wesson place ... Bobby told me!] Dean signs as he moves toward the door. [Thanks, Beth – I owe you.]
The older man falls to his knees with a burbled moan. The shadow lightly pushes Bobby’s shoulder and he falls to one side with his breathing just wet gasps.
to do this.  Sammy ... Dean tastes blood and frowns.  He lifts trembling fingers to his mouth and realizes that he's bitten through his lip.  The link is silent.
Castiel whips away from the Feeder with another ear-splitting screech. His talons brush the air mere centimeters from Mike’s windpipe.
Dean gasps in mock horror and presses his fingers to his lips while flailing the other hand in distress.
A low groan emerges from Sam. Dean knows his little brother would be jumping up and down foaming at the mouth if he could move. He looks back at the vampire and points a finger.
Dean snatches the water and pops the top. He guzzles half of it before smirking at the vampire.  “I’d say I was sorry to disappoint, but I’m not.”
Castiel huffs a soft laugh. “I’m glad we’re in agreement, Dean.  But I’m obviously not doing something right if you can still think … I must be losing my touch if you aren’t
Castiel looks over at Dean who is dragging himself along the floor trying to reach the pair. He licks Sam's blood from his lips. He's fed enough to weaken Sam considerably, but the young man can still recover. After a few weeks, anyway. He lets the long-limbed human slump to the floor and moves to Dean. Castiel looks down at the hunter. Dried blood stains his torn jacket where the vampire slashed him earlier. His leg is bent at a horribly unnatural angle. But what fascinates Castiel is the fierce light in the man's eyes. He knows from his brief foray into Dean Winchester's brain that the young human considers himself expendable when compared with others yet his drive to survive is stronger than almost any other human Castiel has ever met. It will be a great challenge to break that spirit, Castiel decides.
Beside the newcomer stands someone Castiel has known for quite some time—a vampire named Jessica Pearson; elegant and lovely as ever.  Her gleaming mahogany eyes remind Castiel of a leopard sizing up prey for the attack.  At least her victims would know beauty in their last moments.
The room is silent as Mary gets two mugs out and pours the milk into each.  She sets one in front of Sam and sits beside him. Her smaller hand presses warmly down on his large one.  After a moment, Sam takes his mug in both hands and blinks back tears.
is my 1967 Chevy Impala.  502 Big Block 550 … purrs like a kitten.  My dad … I inherited it from him when he … passed on.  Me an’ Sam grew up in that car,” Dean says proudly.  His brow furrows.  “Guess she’s Sam’s now.  I swear to God if he screws her up, I’ll kill him.”
A warm hand rests on his arm.  "Castiel, you saved Dean's life today.  I'll always be grateful to you for that but he's just getting his life together again after Jack came along.  An Alpha that isn't going to stay around is not something he needs."
”I don’t like that your contract with Castiel was made under severe emotional duress, Dean.  It’s more common than I’d like and whenever I discover such an arrangement I generally dissolve it. That’s what I’m offering you now - complete and total dissolution without prejudice. Castiel can never come after Sam or anyone in your family. You’d be free.”
Dean yelps and spins around, hands up in defense.  "Damn it, Cas!  Give a guy a heart attack, why don't you -- whoa!"
Mary shakes her head.  "My boy is a Winchester through and through, Castiel.  We don't go down without a fight."  She spears the young Alpha with her gaze.  "Remember that."
"John Winchester, if my baby learns any new curse words or hand gestures, I'm going to thump you," Mary's voice says sternly.
Dean inhales deeply and the sharp odor of burnt matches fills the air.  Along with a less pleasing effluvium of sex, stained sheets and body odor.  He hums softly.  "Wow. Two days ... color me impressed." Dean considers his next words.  "So does this mean ... you know what, never mind.  I need a shower."
"Yes, well, I can't say it was smart of you to walk barefoot when you knew there were sharp bits of debris on the floor."
When they part, Castiel takes Dean's hand and pulls him down the hall to his bedroom. Their coats have come off somewhere and Dean is tugging Castiel's shirt up to get at the skin beneath. Castiel is trying to repay the movement but Dean's hands are everywhere it seems. With a grunt, Castiel pushes Dean against the wall and presses him there with his body, hands moving to get Dean's shirt off. Dean exhales sharply but relents ... for a minute. After that, it's a free-for-all as they fight each other's clothes off. Dean can't remember the last time he had a lover more impatient than himself. Castiel can't remember the last time he had a lover that wasn't 'gentle'.
didn’t.  The guy who hustles pool to get me jeans that fit after I, and I quote, ‘shot up like a fucking weed’.”
Dean swiftly turns and straddles the pale thighs.  He looks into maroon eyes and feels the press of the man's erection against his entrance.  "This is probably a bigger mistake than agreeing to be a vampire's chew-toy for life."

A chuckle ghosts over Dean's ear, making him shiver in spite of the steadily growing misery in his leg. “And why would I do that, human? You've done your homework. You know I'm not prone to fits of mercy toward you pathetic mortals.”
.  Dean didn't look like a typical scholar in his jeans and band tees but their first night had been nothing but
Dean blinks, confused. Mike and Jessica disappear in that vampire way of theirs and Castiel scoops Dean up like a freaking kid.  He doesn’t protest though.  It feels nice, honestly but he wonders if Cas is upset at the way things are going.
Bobby and Ellen moved from Lawrence, Kansas a few years later to avoid suspicion and settled in South Dakota.  All anyone here knows is that Dean can’t talk and Sam is blind and wasn’t it kind of Ellen and Bobby to take them in.  Dean hasn’t sensed any other people with abilities in the vicinity.
know he’s different?  He was born without functioning vocal cords so he can’t talk or make any sound at all.  He can, however, hear every thought of every person within a specific radius that seems to enlarge the older he gets.  Sam can’t see but he could rearrange all the furniture in the house while he reads.
Dr. Barnes smiles kindly. “No one said you had to but I need to remove the tube now that Dean’s conscious. You can stay in the room but out of our way.”
he feels and not just from Dean’s blood. It touches a very instinctual part of himself to see Dean eating what he’s provided.
Dean reaches across the table and puts his hand on Castiel's arm. He can feel the embarrassment radiating off Castiel like a beacon. [I didn't say I minded ... you just caught me off-guard. I kinda like it, you know?] Dean looks down at his own plate. [People tend to treat me ... 'carefully'. You know what I mean?]
Beth is laughing at something the man signed.  Castiel doesn’t want to stare but he can’t help it … the hands move in graceful arcs and the strong fingers bend and twist forming letters.  As is the case with people who sign, the man’s entire body is part of the conversation.  Castiel finds his mind wandering as he imagines talking to this man … he wonders what he does for a living … where he lives.  So intent on his mental wanderings is Castiel he doesn’t realize the man has stopped talking to Beth and is idly turning around while he waits for his order.
Defiant anger bleeds into their link and something stings his face and the edge of one wing even as the shotgun blast echoes painfully in the bedroom. A jagged, smoking hole appears in the wing of the interloper accompanied by a rising shriek of pain.  Castiel falls back on his hands and kicks out. Obsidian talons slice into the gut of his attacker. The shorter vampire makes horrible gurgling noises and crashes through the wall into the hall. Castiel spares a glance back to check on Dean and … well, if not for the life or death peril, Castiel would be laughing. Dean stands naked by the armoire with a shotgun braced against his shoulder.  Judging from the damage to their foe, the rounds he used are blessed with holy water which would explain why the few stray pellets that struck him burn like fire.  The incorrigible human actually
Sam arches his spine over the back of the chair he’s been slouched in for almost an hour. He stretches his legs out while his neck bends gracefully to follow the long line of his arms and hands like a diver launching himself backwards into the void.
Castiel lets his mind drift over Dean’s, listening in on his dreams. A deep hatred simmers beneath Dean’s thoughts even as he sleeps.  Castiel’s smile takes on a very predatory aspect.  If the hunter was able to read
Castiel blinks.  "We found a child's car seat during the extraction --- we were all afraid -- I can't tell you what an empty car seat at a wreck can mean to a first responder."
Sam lunges toward the man he considers friend, mentor and beloved uncle but is knocked away by a clawed ebony hand that feels like cold marble. Sam crashes into the closet door and lays stunned while the creature moves toward him with steps that shake the floor alarmingly.  Sam blinks his eyes while one side of his face swells. Sam finds himself comically concerned that his jaw is broken again. Then fingers too long and too jointed to be human grip Sam’s chin and force him to stare up into Castiel’s burning gaze. He whimpers when he realizes he can’t look away.
“Excellent. Now, let’s get you dressed.  As much as I like the scenery, I doubt we can avoid unwanted attention if you walk into the ER in just your briefs,” Castiel says.  “Although you don’t seem too bothered by me seeing you in such a state of undress.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Fuck, but you are going to make me wish I died forever the first time, aren’t you?  Those are for formal functions, but if you’d bothered to
Castiel doesn’t move.  When he looks up, Sam’s breath freezes in his throat. The vampire’s eyes are like burning coals and his fangs are savagely long. Sam knows Castiel could tear his mind and body open but this display isn’t one of power — it’s one of grief so unfathomable Sam suddenly feels hot tears sliding down his face.
Warnings:  This chapter can be seen as seriously dub-con because Dean is experiencing the power of the bond he shares with Castiel.  It also taps into some very dark and damaged parts of Dean's psyche.  So enter at your own risk.
A touch so soft it's barely a tickle slides across the back of Dean's neck.  Numbness creeps up his legs and Dean suddenly finds himself crashing to the floor.  He scrabbles against the linoleum but his arms are alien attachments on his body now.  The paralysis seeps upward at an alarming rate, helped no doubt, by Dean's pounding heart rate.  His struggles are little more than spastic muscle jerking. He feels a hand clench in his hair and pull up his head.  Dean's chest feels like someone is sitting on it.
Sam shrinks back at the vampire’s roar but he hears the disdain in Castiel’s voice and for some reason that makes him angry. So very, very angry.
Dean doesn't even think about it ... he always uses his ability during sex. Usually, it's a road map for him to follow so he knows where his partner wants to be touched and how. This time, however, he's learning what makes Castiel groan the normal way – trial and error. But his ability lets him feel exactly what Castiel is feeling ... it's an odd echo of his own body's response to Castiel's hands. He has to pull back when Castiel wraps his lips around Dean's cock.
guy.  Again.  At least that's what Dean tells himself as he's carefully strapped in and he can now see the face that belongs to the voice.  He tells himself that the blue eyes looking straight at him don't resemble his son Jack's at all.  Nope, not a bit.
“What happened to all the ‘you cause problems and we’ll paint you with your family’s blood’?” Dean asks pointedly.
"Jack's ok, Dean.  He's miserable without you but he's doing alright.  I sleep in his room and he's always got someone holding him.  Promise, he's ok," Sam assures Dean.
Sam sits beside Bobby on one side of the kitchen table with its chipped Formica top and wobbly chairs. Castiel bit him much as he did when Dean broke his jaw before and the swelling is nearly gone. Said vampire sits hunched over opposite them, staring at the beer in front of him.
Castiel stands. “Some of those fractures happened before your growth plates closed, Dean.  I’m going to assume you weren’t fighting my sort when you were five.”
Lost in his musings, Sam doesn’t immediately notice the uptick of the heart rate monitor. It’s been a constant sound, weak but steady since Dean came out of surgery.  Sam’s fingers twine around Dean’s good hand.
John Winchester hears his son’s small voice in his head but he cannot spare any time.  He presses a kiss against his boy’s forehead and yells, “Dean, take care of Sammy ….
Robert Singer regards Castiel narrowly. “I think you idjits need to get back to work before I come over there and thump your skulls. Dean ain’t dead and he ain’t turned or you’d know it.”
Dean nods.  “Yeah, Cas, sounds great.”  He slaps the back of his hand into Sam’s chest, eliciting a soft
Dean looks around. The bed he’s in has pristine white sheets and a quilted bedspread in shades of light blue.  He sees a door leading to a white-tiled bathroom and a dark wood wardrobe sits in a corner.  The other pieces of furniture in the room are of the same wood.
deep inside him.  The sigh that follows heralds yet another wave of euphoria cresting through Dean.  Castiel has heard stories of how Feeders react when physically taken.  The bond enhances everything and, if Dean's behavior during their rather intense coupling is any indicator, it makes the claimed human accept things they might not otherwise.  Like Castiel's dark appearance and the rather vicious hooks on his shifted member that ties Dean to him.  At one point Dean might have fought against being penetrated with something that causes so much pain but the pleasure overrode his reason.  Castiel growls at the memory of hazel-green eyes absolutely sightless with bliss.
“I claimed you as my Feeder. You have to be witnessed and registered.  Formal bullshit that I really don’t have time for, but here we are,” Castiel gripes.  He spears Dean with a look.  “And before you get any ideas, let me assure you that if the Council doesn’t accept you, you won’t get to go back to your life before me.  You’ll be killed.  If they do accept you and you do anything to jeopardize the vampire society?  You’ll be killed.  I’m not joking even a little, Dean.  Your attitude can get both of us killed, so I’d rethink it.”
The vampire steps into Dean's line of sight. He doesn't look like the bloodthirsty monster of a moment ago. In fact, if they'd met on a city street only a few months ago, Dean probably wouldn't have given him a second glance. Castiel Novak wears jeans and a tight black Henley with a light gray pattern swirling on it – crosses, ironically. His blue eyes are bright and an almost genial smile bends the thin lips upward. Dean watches as the creature stands in front of him, arms crossed. Castiel taps a finger against his chin thoughtfully.
Dean winces and brushes over Castiel's thoughts. His eyes fly open when he realizes that Castiel doesn't hate him or what has happened between them. He blinks.
Castiel touches Dean’s arm. Dean jumps but he doesn’t resist Castiel turning him around. He meets Castiel’s eyes when his chin is tipped up.
trust me,” Castiel snarls.  He leans close. “Do not doubt that I will litter the world with corpses to find my beloved, human.  Where. Is. He?”
"My goodness, how on Earth does your Alpha resist those eyes?"  Her teasing smile fades when Dean's eyes drop.
“I know you do, baby. I hate it for you but ... oh, forgive me for this, Sam ... but you came to us because of it in the beginning. How can I ever regret that?” Mary asks, her palm pressed against Sam’s cheek.
Castiel peers up at the night sky briefly before pulling his hoodie up and trudging to his truck in the parking lot.  Only random flakes are falling but the clouds overhead form a solid blanket reflecting the city lights back at the world below.  If he's any judge of things, they'll have more accumulation as the night goes on and tomorrow will see an entire new spate of accidents like Dean's.  Castiel has never been more grateful to begin a 72-hour off.  His boots crunch with each step until he reaches the large black dually truck.  It's dusted with snow that drifts off in the light wind.
What has to be a tongue traces the finger’s path. Dean gags at the fly-blown breath but he can’t pull away. He feels digits pressing against his ass and every inch of his skin wants to slither away.
Sam walks out the door and back to the shop. He gives Bobby his fries and nibbles on his burger, appetite lost. They both glance up when the door opens.
Castiel nods. “A vampire’s venom enhances the Feeder’s physiology. After a few weeks, Dean’s sense of taste and smell was clarified. He went on a ‘mission’ as he called it to find something he could stand.  That is the result. It’s quite popular from what the owner has told me. His best selling blend.”
Another laugh escapes the vampire. “All your life you’ve been hunting us and you don’t know anything, do you?”
injuries, Dean.  John is a friend – I could get into serious trouble for hurting you the way I did.  Damn it, stop trying to spin everything I say into a possible method of escape, Dean!”
Lost in thought, Dean realizes they've actually entered Sioux City and are only minutes away from Benny's home.  He tenses, gripping the door handle tightly.  Benny parks the truck and turns to look at Dean.
"You think I don't get that?  You know what happened to my dad after we lost my mom.  I'm not about to cause issues, Benny," Dean warns his friend.
Dean shrugs. “I just have to give you a drink now and then, bloodsucker.  Nothing says I have to like it.”
Castiel smiles, licking over a fang.  Dean has given him the perfect opening to further bind the human to him.  It's almost too easy.   Leaning close, he traces his tongue along the bite mark that brands Dean as a claimed Feeder, off limits to everyone.  His grin widens at the trembling, breathy exhale that follows.  Castiel tightens his grip around Dean, his claws leaving fine cuts along the man's torso that heal before the blood even has time to surface.  He speaks aloud to his vulnerable human, knowing his words will twist Dean's will to him.  He uses his Voice to ensure what he says sinks deep into Dean's psyche.  Castiel's hidden smile is dark.
"I don't know," Castiel replies truthfully.  "You are a pain in the ass  the likes of which I have never known in all my three centuries and it would have been easier to just kill both of you that night in the warehouse."  He shakes his head.  "But your loyalty to your brother ... it's been a long time since I've seen its like among humans.  You're both dedicated to what you do -- this saving people and hunting things credo you seem to live by.  Most hunters do what they do for vengeance or a simple love of killing."
Dean finds the work calming – busy enough so he doesn’t have to think but simple enough for him to be good at it. He picks up new techniques through his ability so he seems like a fast learner. Garth is making an effort to learn sign which Dean finds touching. He gives Garth a new sign every few days and the young man seems to be picking it up. Dean glances over when Garth’s voice falls into expectant silence. Dean skims over Garth’s mind to find the question he asked.
Dean shivers against Castiel's leg but when he does open his eyes, he's looking at his vampire and not Mike.  Castiel feels a flare of intense pride at this even though he knows they could both be killed for disrespect.  He smiles and lets his fingertips drift over Dean's cheek.  "Obey the First, Dean.  It's ok."
Dean begins to shake.  His teeth chatter and a warm blanket settles over him.  "There we go ... easy does it ... you'll be ok ..."
Castiel says nothing, letting the link fill with calm.  Dean's heart rate is climbing and it wouldn't do to have his Feeder drop dead of a heart attack.  The human blows out a harsh breath so Castiel takes his hand and pulls him close.  His palm rests against Dean's cheek and the human leans into the touch.
before you can impress me with your mule headed ways and falling headlong down the stairs will not get you there any faster.”
Dean shakes his head but he’s secretly very proud of his little brother.  He definitely got the smarts.  Dean’s just happy to be able to fix cars and help out at the shop and salvage yard that his uncle Bobby owns.
He never wanted a Feeder -- never wanted the responsibility of caring for a fragile human but now Castiel thinks he might have to change that opinion.  He's never known the
The man opens his mouth to say something -- most likely something brutal and cutting -- before closing it and exhaling sharply.  He runs a hand over his face.
Dean finds himself falling asleep while Castiel is still talking. He wonders dimly how long it will take before he begs Castiel to kill him.
Dean blinks slowly.  His left arm is pressed against him by the door which seems to be folded inward.  He realizes his body is kinked at an odd angle to accomodate the way the metal pushed into the cabin. Dean mentally thanks his stars that Baby has a bench seat with no center console or he'd probably be crushed.  As it is, his innards don't feel like they are where he left them last.  He tries to move and a scream rips out of Dean's throat without any warning.  Strong hands are suddenly there, gently holding his shoulders as he sobs.
”— and when John came into the bonding suite with Dean you were sniffing them both to beat the band. Dean smiled at you and you stopped screaming. I knew you belonged to us right then.”
Sam’s gaze is steady.  “So you understand that I’m expecting you to release Dean and let him come back to his real life?”
Sam freezes when he hears the familiar accent. “Oh, I'm sure you can, but first I wanted to give Sam his cane back ... really should be more careful about your props. People will notice – and then you won't be able to fool anyone into thinking you're a run-of-the-mill blind man. What would people think if they knew you were a telekinetic meta, Sam Winchester?”
Sam has one hand on Dean’s shoulder, pausing and stepping as directed. Ellen allows him to send to talk but that's all.  They're both on the honor code that they'll follow the rules.  Annoyed as it makes them ... they do.
Dean's eyes roll back in his head as Castiel feeds him visions of blood-soaked floorboards and carpets; of crimson-splashed walls and skin too white to belong to the living; of dead eyes staring at him in accusation -- it's the mental horror movie he’s lived since the night his dad found his mom only now starring his little brother.
Castiel waves his hand dismissively. “Naturally. Do you accept my terms then? A life as my Feeder for your brother's life?”
The voice drowns under the raucous vibrations of the Jaws of Life.  The hydraulic rescue tool makes short work of his car door.  Dean tries to stifle the tears that threaten -- he loves his car and now she's scrap metal.  That's what's got him emotional.  The tears are
The vampire appears abruptly, making Dean jump. He tells himself not to be startled but Castiel moves too fast and too quietly for the hunter’s instincts to react any other way.
ability to compel is through speech. Even a whisper, barely audible over say, a shotgun blast? One sound is all I need to slither into your minds and start flipping switches,” Castiel murmurs. “Open your eyes, Dean.”
“Family don’t end with blood. I admit when I’m wrong and I was wrong about you. Dean loves you and that boy don’t do anything halfway and sure as shit don't give his heart to just anyone,” Bobby snaps. “He gave all of himself to you or I’m a vegan wendigo. That means you need to stop crying in your coffee, reach down into that hell  pit you call a heart and find that connection. Me an’ Sam’ll figure out how to find him from there. We take care of our own.”
Silence falls and Sam hesitates to break it but he’s afraid he’s made one of the worst mistakes of his life.
“Pity about the eye. Those beauties of yours are definitely one of your best features,” the voice pauses and then Dean feels a fingertip along his bottom lip. “Along with your mouth. Dear me, yes!  These tender morsels are just so very … plump. Delectable.”
A single tear worms its way down Dean’s cheek at the end because sending his little brother away is the absolute last outcome he wants. Dean dashes it away angrily.  He moves back to Castiel’s side and leans into the vampire. Castiel presses a kiss against Dean’s temple.
Castiel growls and his eyes flare like coals.  "Do not finish your thought, Winchester.  You ... "  He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath even though he doesn't have to.  When he looks at Dean, he sees the eyes shining with tears and no little uneasiness.  Castiel moves to crouch in front of the hunter, his hands resting lightly on Dean's legs.  "Dean ... it would - I would be very ...
Sam opens his mouth to say something but a confused look crosses his face and he stumbles forward a step. Castiel catches at the young man’s shoulders to steady him and then he sees Jake stepping back. The long blade in his hand glistens. Castiel smells the sharp bite of pennies buoyed on freshly mown grass and the unique scent of the younger Winchester’s blood fills Castiel with dread.
The voice speaks again with an amused lilt and Castiel looks up at the luminous blue eyes.  He feels exposed.
Dean turns the key and the engine of the 1969 C10 truck they’ve been working on turns over reluctantly. After a minute or so it sputters and dies but that’s the longest its managed since they began working on it. Dean sighs.
Castiel nods. [He certainly seems ... friendly.] He pauses between bites to frown. [Were you two ... intimate?]
The doctor – Carter, by the nametag – looks younger than Dean but even though his gaze is set in a clean-shaven boyish face, the human sees dark years stretching out behind the brown orbs. He chuckles and suddenly all vestiges of what he truly is disappear.  Dr. Carter looks at Castiel with a raised eyebrow.
Castiel watched Dean sleep in his large bed.  He’d overfed while pounding Dean into the mattress during their flight.  Now his human needed time to rest and recuperate. It was an annoying reminder of how mortal Dean truly was despite Castiel’s blood imparting a longer life-span and greater healing ability.
Hazel-green eyes meet blue ones and Castiel can feel the burn sliding up his neck to his face.  The man regards him curiously and Castiel decides he must leave.  Pulling bills from his wallet, he leaves the meal price plus a generous tip for Beth.  He stands and walks quickly toward the door.  Castiel signs
The staring contest goes on for a few more minutes until Benny sticks his head in the room.  "You two gonna eat, you better get to it -- jambalaya don't translate real well cold."
She turns and sighs.  "I don't think you're strong enough for a prolonged visit yet, Dean.  Pups are more draining than you think."
Castiel nods uneasily. Mike’s eyes are blue and human but he can just see the pinpoint of red deep in the pupils. It settles him for some reason. Mike is young … an infant by vampire standards … and this leaves him close to his former humanity and the understanding of love’s ability to strip away all reason and control. Yet he’s also a being of immense power. That he easily balances the two is almost comforting.
Pain, sudden and sharp, flares up Sam’s arm jerking a startled yelp out of the Omega. Dean’s grip loosens just enough for Sam to pull his digits free amid the sudden frantic alarms echoing around him. Sam moves to the door and bellows, “Help! I need help here!”
Dean idly fiddles with the steering wheel and nods. It’s a testament to how far he’s come that he takes the vampire’s endearment in stride.
At that moment, the door opens.  The doctor is still wearing scrubs and pulls off her hair cap as she enters with a neutral nod to everyone.
"I should probably get you some orange juice," Castiel murmurs into Dean's blood-matted hair.  He shifts again and grins at the hiss this elicits from his Feeder.
Dean grins down from the porch.  It feels weird, watching his little brother pull up in the Impala. This isn’t even his house but Dean is still excited and kinda proud to show it off. After all, Sam has no memories of their only real home. He’d grown up thinking motel rooms were the norm until he’d learned they weren’t. Now Dean can show him what it’s like to have four walls around him that aren’t covered in cheap paint or peeling wallpaper with generic landscapes over the bed. A home where every horizontal surface doesn’t have a book on ancient monster lore on it or a half-assembled gun being cleaned.  A place where you don’t have to sleep with a blade under your pillow and reload cartridges while you watch cartoons.
Mike chuckles and cocks his head as if listening to something.  He grins, his fangs glinting in the fire light.  "No, no he doesn't but Harvey and Jessica will keep him calm for the moment."  Mike takes another drink from his beer.  His smile melts away and suddenly Dean feels a chill race up his spine.
Castiel whips around to see a man standing nearby.  It’s been the better part of many centuries since another vampire managed to get so close without him noticing.  He takes in the unassuming picture presented to him:  young New York businessman with short-cropped dark blonde hair stylishly coiffed coupled with a simple but perfectly tailored bespoke suit finished by classic wingtips polished to a mirror shine on the toe.  An unwary human would easily mistake him for one of the million corporate drones that flow through New York daily.  At least until their life drains from them.
“Yeah … taught me everything I know. Sam knows a lot too but it was never the same for him.  Dad … he worked on her every chance he got – he could tell when something was off with the engine or the way she was riding,” Dean reminisces.  “She’s been home for as long as I can remember – Sam’s army guy is still stuck in the ashtray.  Turn on the heat and you’ll hear my Legos rattling around in there.  Yeah … nothin’ like Baby on the road anymore.”
onto his stomach. Fingers that could easily punch through his rib cage and tear out his spine began to knead gently.
The Alpha chuckles.  "Cas will do fine.  That broken jaw of yours is going to be a nightmare for a while."
Light returns in fiery, blazing glory. The very air seems to sit with unimaginable weight upon his skin.  His ears ring as if he were the clapper in a massive bell.  Castiel’s legs buckle and he falls to his knees all too human. The mental disorientation is so severe at first he can’t even work out how he’s dressed again but something else presses to the forefront of his thoughts. He has sinned against the most powerful of his kind. Judge, jury and executioner.
“S’ok … shouldn’t – shouldn’t have gotten up. Sorry … didn’t mean – I’ll clean it up – I’ll clean up – sorry – don’t –“
The elder Winchester’s head falls back and he screams his climax into the night sky. Castiel’s roar silences the woods around them as wave after wave of ecstasy rocks the pair. Searing pulses of semen strike Dean’s throat and moments later his blood mixes with the thick ejaculate as Castiel feeds with long, agonizing pulls. Dean whimpers and clutches at his Master’s back while drowning in the vampire’s bloodlust.
Sam gently eases his nephew down on Dean’s right-hand side.  Knowing Dean to be an Omega parent, the hospital put him in a wider bed so while snug, Jack has room to lie beside Dean.  Sam tucks him under the blanket and grins when Jack cracks a wide yawn.
Dean has no time to react. Castiel’s fangs slide into the tender skin on his neck without any resistance.  Dean clutches at the vampire’s arms bracketing his head, feeling like he’s falling.  The painful burning sting in his neck gradually fades into the sensation of a string being pulled out of him and Dean lets his arms fall back to the bed.  A warm tide of lethargy breaks over him and Dean drifts along with the ebb and flow of it; all concern for his personal safety or disgust at the situation dissipates into the pool of relaxation enveloping him.  Bruises, battered ribs, broken leg – his injuries feel miles away and barely noticeable.  A sigh he will deny until his last breath slips out as Castiel pulls away.  Dean blinks dazedly.  A pink tongue slides over a crimson mouth that curls into a smile when Dean unconsciously mimics the motion.  Perplexing emotions dance through Dean’s body but he can’t quite bring himself to be concerned.  A tempting rightness wraps itself around his brain, preventing him from experiencing any sense of panic or disgust at watching the dark creature before him feed.  Instead, a lazy smile breaks across Dean’s lips and Castiel mirrors it.
Dean jerks awake flailing at empty air.  For a long moment, he struggles to get free of the blankets and finally manages to toss them to one side with a disgusted grimace.  They're sodden with his sweat. His entire body is slick with it and Dean feels it running down his back.
The word freezes Sam.  His eyes are comically round but at least he knows Dean well-enough to realize he’s pushed the former Hunter to the edge of his temper so he keeps his mouth shut.  Dean steps back and runs a hand over his face.
“Of course you are,” Sam retorts. “Don't try to act like you have the slightest idea what it's like for the ones like me and Dean.”
“Jams, marmalades, chocolate, cakes, puddings … he had quite the sweet tooth. I was a trader at the time so I had first access to most of the supply ships coming over from Europe.  I always made sure to bring back a treat for Gabriel and then I had to hide it from him until an appropriate gift-giving moment or he would gobble it up the second I handed it over,” Castiel recalls.  He shakes his head with a laugh.  “My brother Balthazar was second in line and while he didn’t crave sweets like Gabriel, he certainly shared Gabe’s love of tormenting me.  I was a little jumpy back then and they both enjoyed scaring the hell out of me.”
