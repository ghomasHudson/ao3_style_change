Tony thought to himself. He was already on edge, his body coiled tense as a coil, charge reverberating through his body, the current looking for an outlet to expel the energy. He had been brought into the station plenty times before, sure. He was never worried though; it wasn't like they could pin him with anything. Any evidence of his less-than legal hobbies that could ever be considered incriminating were constantly screened and destroyed by his eye in the cyber sky, JARVIS. But being here, right in the wake of everything that was happening with HYDRA? It couldn't be a coincidence.
Rogers got out of the truck slowly, looking at Steve. He reached behind him, not pulling out a gun, but a gold bar. Rogers threw it to the ground at Steve’s feet.
“Yes?” Steve answered slowly, although it came out more like a question, unsure what Tony wanted to hear.
So. Sorry for the delay, but we're back on schedule! Enjoy!

I might add. The whole witness protection thing is bullshit. How much longer can you claim to be cleaning up lose ends? Please, we all know that you’re just keeping us out here because you can’t throw us in prison.”
“Tony,” Steve panted against his mouth. “Tony,
“Well, you just said it was your job, didn’t you? You better be doing a good job if I’m buying you dresses like this.”
Steve smiled softly down at the phone, finger tracing over Tony’s name before finally typing out a reply.
Tony nodded in response, opting to go the long way so he wouldn’t have to cut through the sea of reporters. He would meet Steve by the back door where no doubt, he already had a car waiting. He would get in the armored vehicle pressed tight against Steve’s sides while they loop around to pick everyone else up. And they’d go back to the speakeasy, where Tony would collapse on the closest couch, letting himself be surround by Steve, by family, by
“I sent out an electro magnetic pulse as soon as we arrived, which should’ve shut down any cameras,” Tony continued, turning his attention to the side of the building. “So they don’t know who’s out here yet, but they know somethings up – you should be prepared for them to come to you,” he warned.
And Steve was never going to bite Tony, so it didn’t matter…
Tony remembered far too many infuriating arguments with his father to believe that any good could come from trying to explain.
And maybe that wasn’t the smell…
Everything he was

He felt Steve’s fingertips dip into his back as he let go of an anguished moan, like a stifled scream. Panicked and frustrated and pleading and

Steve actually felt just a little bit shaky as he slid the back of the frame away, the glass panel at the front coming free along with the photograph. Steve turned his attention to the picture first, carefully setting the frame aside so that he could concentrate on placing the photo into his inside pocket – the one deep enough that he could be sure he wouldn’t crease it. And then he glanced up at Tony.

And this time, it turned out that he preferred not to be alone.

Immediately, Steve understood that this was something that could never have happened a few months earlier. Something he thought he’d never be able to have back…
And it gave him

He’s spent hours trying to ignore it, rationalise it, put it into some sort of order – but the awfulness of it was so loud that he couldn’t think over the top of it. Trying to keep his head quiet for a minute was like trying to hold your breath when you have the hiccups. The ideas would just leap in, entirely oblivious to his attempts to control them.
Tony had really been in love with him… It changed something. Something important.

Usually, Steve liked walking along the beach at night. There was something about the vast, ethereal emptiness of the ocean after dark that made Steve feel small, but in a nice way…

“I never know how you’re about to get yourself killed,” Steve muttered, through gritted teeth. “You’re unpredictable like that.”
, whether I knew it was him.”
And yes, it was immediate and physical and overpowering - but it wasn’t strange or supernatural, like it was last night.
...The same compromised, shameful optimism, thinking of the horrified look in Tony’s eyes.
He fixed Steve with a questioning look,

He didn’t even know if he’d fallen into it or if Tony had pushed him. He just found himself sprawled on his back, on crisp, white sheets-
“That’s deep,” Rhodey commented for the group. This time it was Steve that snorted a laugh.
...Even if it didn’t actually feel frightening. If it actually felt strangely comfortable and deeply reassuring-
It had taken at least an hour for Steve to convince himself that these things hadn’t happened - and at least another hour after that, for him to really believe that…there was nothing…

“Big project. Worked too long. Slept too long,” he shorthanded, running a hand through his hair. He knew that Rhodey had seen him do this enough times to know exactly what he was talking about.
So happy that Steve
He watched Steve take a knife to his own wrist, his eyes fixed on Tony as he pressed the blade to his skin and sliced, lengthwise, opening a rapid stream of crimson red…
“JARVIS, got some more files to add to your sorting pile buddy,” Tony announced, as he clicked each USB pen into place.
Instantly, a thousand other videos started playing in his head, one on top of the other, a montage of all the most awful things that Steve could imagine happening to a person.
Tony never thought he’d be reassured by either of those memories.
He had the will to do it.
Especially as his brief lapse in concentration had been every bit as disastrous as he’d always feared it would be.

“No, I think that was just him working out that I probably get headaches,” Bucky answered, in the same bored tone. Steve felt his cheeks warm as he realised… he was doing it again. He reminded himself that he’d resolved

let Tony talk to him first.
“How awful,” he commented, eventually.
He felt Steve’s grip tighten, hard, his whole body tensing  as though that was the hottest thing Tony could possibly have said.
“You didn’t kick Adam’s skull in though, did you?” Tony told him, seriously.
It flashed up in him, instantly drenching him in an awful, shameful fear.
have access to all those resources,” Steve added, like he was playing along, “so it won’t matter nearly as much if we take down SHIELD before the aliens arrive. We won’t need them to help us.”
The stilted way they’d said goodbye, the way Steve couldn’t quite meet his eye.
“Yeah, well, tell it to Tony,” Steve snapped – and then immediately regretted it.
“I love you, only you,” just fell over Tony’s lips. He didn’t even notice as all of his defensive walls simply...disappeared. He felt so far removed from the person he was yesterday, so completely sure of this instinct - it never once occurred to him to pause. “I’m

“...And then Bruce Hulked out and started dancing, I think,” Bucky carried on, cocking an eyebrow,
Which made this whole thing so much stranger, so much more impactful, than meeting with an extraordinary creature that had always existed - that had always been fundamentally separate to himself.
Tony’s brow creased, first confused, then warmly amused, before he looked back at Steve’s face again. And, out of nowhere, Steve remembered the little piece of paper that was sitting in his top pocket – or, rather, he remembered the awkward and prolonged debate he’d had with himself about whether to bother bringing it.

He stuttered to a halt a few feet away, and their eyes met again. There was a beat between them, which was either emotionally charged or just awkward - Steve was in no state to tell.
But hey, it was also true.
…Did this mean he had to rethink that reaction, too?
He really did have the most…
Tony did a literally double take.
He cast a glance around the vast, non-descript storage unit, making sure to keep his gaze bored and unfocused - not that there was anyone paying attention to him. The only other security guard was Gary, an older guy that Steve had bumped into on the occasional night shift, and who he’d already thoroughly profiled. Slightly overweight and permanently sweaty, Gary had obviously been a little selective with what he put on the medical form; it seemed unlikely that he would’ve been hired by any of the departments that bothered looking into these things.
…Didn’t it?
Bucky recognised that general feeling of simply being glad that Sam was here. There might be no right answer to this, but Bucky was sure that, no matter how tired and possibly high Sam was right now, he’d still find
Maybe he
Incredibly moved and somewhat proud to think how hard Steve was still trying.
A wordless reminder that he still felt guilty…. for never wondering where Bruce was, for leaving him in an alien hellscape not unlike this one for three whole months… For how little he’d thought about it since.
He didn’t like how different everything felt.

Tony asked a few general questions about Steve’s week, and the team, and how Bucky’s arm was healing, as he walked them up to the kitchen on the second floor. It wasn’t until they got there that Steve realised how little of Tony’s house he’d actually seen. That there was something especially intimate about being allowed into Tony’s kitchen… maybe even more so than the bedroom. Even though, from the looks of it, Tony didn’t use it much, this still felt like a part of his day-to-day life, his
that…
He felt comfortable.
But Tony didn’t even hear that one.
He broke into that same silly grin again, his face flushing hot as he thought about his plans for the night...
“They change colour,” Tony added, with just a hint of pride. Steve grinned wider.
Steve felt the significance ripple through the room. He guessed it was because the hotel was so overpriced… but he didn’t actually know. The relative value of the dollar was one of those things he still had to manually translate in his head, and even that didn’t help him navigate the different things that people valued, these days. Things that would’ve been considered the height of luxury in the forties were now considered disposable, things that he took for granted as a kid were now rare and sought after and expensive. Knowing what something would’ve cost in forties currency didn’t always help him understand what it was
And then he recognised the smell of Tony, washing over him like flood water-
Only that he hated seeing Tony like this, and he wanted to make it better.

A cold shiver ran up Steve’s back.

He tried throwing out random suggestions that he wasn’t going to examine, hoping to convince himself that there was an answer out there somewhere -
He thought about how much he wanted to help Tony. Steve ran through all those agonies and injustices that he now felt as his own, all the challenges he had to meet for Tony, all the things he couldn’t possibly know and all the ways he could potentially make it worse.
He remembered that he usually cared about all of that.
Except that, as Steve was standing up again, and pulling himself out of his own head, his eyes so happened to catch on the scrap of paper that was sitting on the desk-

been thrown at him.
He’d tried appeasing each worry, talking to himself in firm and rational terms… but before he could quell any one anxiety, another would pipe up loud and clear and petulant.
“Yeah, a bit.” He agreed, grateful for the intervention.
And Steve had to wait until it had finished curling through his stomach before he could steady his hands enough to unwrap the gifts…
A wave of genuine, bodily fear, followed immediately by a curl of shame.
“What exactly did he say?” Steve asked in a perfectly level voice.
“I’m very honoured you tried one!” She assured him, as he followed Rhodey away from the stall.
to love you. Stubbornness and self-righteousness and facetious neatness and all. It was all so understandable, so obviously from a good place – so coherent. Even those…
It was only because he couldn’t think of the right words that he didn’t just tell him that.

Because, obviously, they’d have some sort of security covering all of the actual doors-
In fact, the only time Quill troubled Steve’s thoughts at all was when the faintest echo of muttered singing bounced off of the rocks behind him…

“Not really,” Bucky shrugged. “I mean, I don’t like any of it. But…”
And Steve looked up, and saw Maribelle standing just there beside them, smiling warmly. And then he saw the blonde guy, still holding a tray of shot glasses, standing behind her like a royal guard.
Of course, what actually happened was that Steve spent the first two hours trying to manage the warring factions in his own head - the conflict between his newfound determination to relax and his deep-rooted instinct to
...And Steve didn’t like it.
If Tony had met Steve in another life, if they had both been human, he would’ve been happy for an initial interest to develop into a physical draw, and then an emotional yearning. It would’ve seemed perfectly normal that he’d want to commit more of himself to Steve the more he grew to like him. No one would have questioned why they took risks for each other, or made compromises for each other, if it turned out to be true love. Tony would’ve accepted the effect Steve had on his body, known it was real,
The first was a tall, broad-shouldered man in a sequined silver jumpsuit and a dazzling red satin cape. His hair was so white it glowed under the light, and swept up into an elaborate style that either reminded Tony of the Court of Versailles or a Mardi Gras float - he couldn’t decide. The man’s skin was pale, and, when Tony looked closely, tinted mint-green

than that...
“But that won’t take you until eleven tonight, right?”
This wasn’t a sensation that flooded through him, this wasn’t a feeling that he could’ve sunk into, like before.
“Well go and get checked out then!”
He began to think that maybe these ‘strange new instincts’ could
But, as he didn’t have the luxury of second guessing himself, he carried on with what he had to say.
His eyes had finally acclimated to the dark in the room, letting him pick out the shape of the furniture amongst the shadows. Of course, he’d taken a few moments to have a careful look around before he took his position, so he knew exactly where everything was. He’d thought through his plan at least a hundred times, and silently practised a thousand potential lines of dialogue… now, there was nothing left to do but wait.
Steve groaned, and dropped his head onto the steering wheel.
And then Steve caught his eye, and blushed… And Tony just knew that Steve was thinking about it too.
sorry, I know this all came out wrong, I’m… bad at this anyway…”
Automatically, Steve read it again… and then a third time…
But, apparently, at some point over the last twelve hours, Tony had gotten over that.
His mind filled with incomplete ideas and evocative images; not really thinking about why he was angry so much as creating an abstract representation of it.
When Tony pulled back to gasp for air, he was actually dizzy. And then he broke out into an elated smile, and finally managed a full, coherent sentence-
Thinking about any of that could take up a few minutes.

to apologise to you right now.” And Steve stilled completely, and sat back compliantly, for no reason other than Tony had asked him to… because he’d told Steve what he wanted.
“Spray it in his face, it’ll make him scared of you” She summarised “Works for maybe ten minutes at a time.”
“And we’re
And he didn’t even overthink it.
“And my
“…How bad was it?” Rhodey guessed, gingerly.
“Hi,” he answered that expression on autopilot - even going as far as to extend his hand. The woman’s eyes widened as she took it, an excited smile tugging underneath her professional demeanour.
“Because I was scared, and because I was being selfish… And because I’m in love with you.”
But he’d never seen radiators of this shape and size, before. Like he’d never seen light fixtures that looked like his, or ever been in a home painted this strange shade of yellowish cream. Oversights in the research process, slight errors in the dates, a misunderstanding of the little details - like Fury picking the wrong baseball game to play as Steve woke up, or the agent who came to greet him wearing the wrong tie and bra. Minor, understandable mistakes that nonetheless made Steve feel disorientated and nervous, like he was wandering through the eerie almost-perfect suburb at the beginning of a horror movie…
Tony felt a plunging sense of exhilaration, right to the very pit of his stomach... and an entirely different sort of thrill, when he realised that nothing was going to stop it. That there were none of the usual breaks on his reaction to Steve – there wasn’t going to

way, that Steve had simply assumed would never be for him, at one point…
Everything was brighter.
He could be kind to Steve, without worrying that it would be a concession on his part…
“For what?” Tony asked, baffled.

Tony could only assume that he was going to freak the fuck out, just as soon as this hit him.
“My daughter, in an unofficial sort of way – tell you the truth, I think she’s glad to have us out of the way for a while. Give her a chance to show what she can do – she’s only twenty.”

Unlike other sedatives, which just have a blanket effect, this one will reduce your physical capabilities without making you equally drowsy, uncoordinated or confused.”
He wondered if there was an alternate timeline where he simply collapsed at that point. The world where he’d finally declared his love for Tony and then just
Trying to remember how the fuck his legs worked.

“So, you just…” He gestured to her for permission, waiting until she nodded encouragingly before he pulled the flower head off and put it into his mouth…

“...And one of those things was sending the Winter Soldier to kill your parents, and make it look like a car crash.”
Steve snorted a surprised laugh, and then quickly corrected himself.
His whole body was still tingling with the memory of Steve’s kisses. His head was still full of Steve’s sweet, kind words. He was completely lost in this wonderful, beautiful moment, and so desperate to stay here-
The tension had gone from his shoulders, and he wasn’t gritting his teeth anymore… but in place of that was a sad sort of heaviness. He looked as though he’d just finished hearing bad news, or thinking very hard about life… Steve would’ve liked to ask.
…Oh no.
His eyes immediately fell on the bed.
“Bit on the nose,” he muttered.
To realise that he’d just

“Oh Steve…” Tony breathed, as he fell forward onto his arms.

He was just so tired right now. He wasn’t sure when that’d snuck up on him, but suddenly he just wanted to sit and stare into the middle distance for a little while.

to belong to Tony.
Steve didn’t have time to catch his breath, before Tony had pulled back and thrust into him again, and again, fucking him in a fast, solid rhythm. Sending wave after wave of feeling crashing through him, quicker than Steve could process them – soon pulling Steve into a state of mindless, desperate pleasure. He didn’t know how long he stayed lost there. How many minutes he spent just letting this sensation pulse through him, his cock weeping against his stomach, his fingers stinging under his grip on the sheets.
A treacherous heat flooded his face, tightening his throat against anything he might have wanted to say-
For a few seconds Steve just stood there, staring at the space Tony had left behind, listening the ringing silence left in his wake.

to have a look around that he didn’t actually take any of it in.
anything else,” Tony said instead. “That’s what I’m telling you – I really don’t know anything about him. I don’t know if he’s smart, or funny, or aggressive, or, I don’t know, he could be a white supremacist, for all I know.”
“Okay,” Tony breathed, mainly to steady himself, before he turned back to Bucky-
After all, Steve had
And of course Tony just carried on teasing him – pointedly ignoring Steve’s cock and moving to kiss his way along the crease of his legs, sucking gently at his thighs. He pushed Steve’s jeans further down his legs, almost offhandedly, letting Steve kick his way free of them.
“Steve, let me introduce you to Agent Barton,” Nick said, obligingly, gesturing between the two of them. “He’s one of our best agents, been assigned to the project since the start. If you have questions that Selvig can’t answer, he’s your man.” And then Nick turned to Clint, “Barton, this is...Steve.”
Mind made up, Tony stomped away towards the door and back outside.
“My informants and I would have Stark’s location within the hour,” Loki assured.
“Hey!” Tony spun around to catch the car keys that were being thrown at him. Tony saw The Captain point to his car that he drove over to the warehouse with Odinson. Tony sprinted over to the car, not even commenting when The Captain sidled in to the passenger seat.
Tony didn’t want to be him.
There was no reason they should have sat on this. They knew that Tony Stark and The Captain had been working together - if they knew where The Commandos were holed up at, they could have been taken out months ago. Justin could be sitting in the Bahamas with a margarita in one hand and a hooker in the other right now. By waiting this long, they may have missed their window of taking Stark out with the rest of them. Everyone knew that Stark had managed to piss off his only ally; trying to kill both birds with one stone seemed like a pipe dream now.
Tony snorted. “I always thought he was such a smooth talker.”
Steve clenched his jaw, not even bother turning around.
And Steve loved it.
“Captain America doesn’t get jealous,” Steve answered. “Steve Rogers on the other hand,” he added, pressing a kiss to the underside of Tony’s ear, teeth scraping gently against the skin. “I missed you, is all.”
Bucky leaned back on his heels, letting everything soak in. This was worse than he could have possibly imagined. HYDRA was already nipping at their heels, but the introduction of a new mob was the last thing they needed right now. And, considering what they’ve managed to accomplish in the past week, Bucky couldn’t even begin to think how they were going to get out of this one. “Okay,” he said, nodding to himself. “Well, let’s get to work. Problem’s not gonna solve itself, right?”
“PTSD. The forbidden word,” Fury replied. “A fault in society’s eyes. A weakness. One we’re taught not to have.”
He heard it before he saw it. The cracking of ice.
The man frowned, obviously unpleased. “Fine,” he agreed, but postured, hand trailing over his sidearm in an obvious threat. “But you’re going too,” he continued, nodding towards Sam.
“I was naïve before, Obie,” he hissed. “But I remember out conversation. I
“Pretty sure there are a lot of people out in the other room that wouldn’t agree with that decision, Cap,” Tony retorted, still looking unconvinced.
“I doubted a Price Charming such as yourself wouldn’t it’s just…”
Tony said in reply.
Clint froze.
“Pepper,” he croaked out, wincing at how rough his voice sounded. “How did you- ”
“I left you a note!”
The cold, crushing weight that consumed him, locking him in place.
“-you were fine, but I just
“You’re not listening,” said Steve, getting to his feet and bracketing Tony’s front, hands on his hips. “What do you think we were doing this whole time,
He knew, of course, how close The Commandos were to one another. While the thought of losing Stark would burn enough, Phil knew the loss of Bucky would be much worse. He knew that Clint would have thought that losing his eyes would hurt less than losing Barnes.
The blonde shook his head. “It’s still early though.”
That was another problem, wasn't it? Thor had offered up his sprawling loft for the people that needed it, but it was still a tight fit, even minus the men who went home to their families, and the ones that were still missing. It was incredibly generous, but Steve knew he and his men couldn’t stay there forever. They needed to regroup, they needed a plan, they needed-
After a nice breakfast, Steve had made Tony return to bed. Something about getting the right amount of rest or some shit. Which was completely ridiculous because Steve had stayed up all night watching for his could be murderer.
"If you think for one second that I'm leaving you in here alone with him- "
A snort. “Nothing, I just didn’t know that seeing you in shorts was on my bucket list, until now.”
“Laugh it up now, buddy. Just tell me who you work for. Is it Hammer? Killian? It’s Hammer, isn’t it? Look, I know your boss is an embarrassment to the human race, but you’re among friends here, you can tell me. I promise not to laugh,” Tony drawled. Now Hammer? Hammer he could deal with. Hammer can't manufacture a reliable weapon, let alone find reliable henchmen. The only threat Hammer posed was the potential of someone getting a picture of the two of them out in public together. He wasn't about to have another debacle with the local rag magazines, insinuating that he and Hammer were secret lovers. He already had to deal with it every time he went into Pepper's office, his assistant taking continued pleasure in his pain by having it framed on her desk.
Hammer nodded in agreement. “What do you suggest we do to finally push him over the edge?”
Sam had said. If someone had managed to find their way to a one hideout, they could find their way to them all. And while Bucky had never personally seen the files that the SSR entrusted to Steve, he knew that it was more than enough to bring their world crashing to its knees. Sam was right. They needed to check the rest – they needed to see what, if any, were left.
“Okay,” Tony answered shakily, head tilting back towards Steve. The blonde hummed when Tony led him into the kiss. This time, Tony let himself fall once he felt himself teetering to the edge, letting himself be at the favor of Steve’s hands. His right, that was curled around his length was merciless, fingers switching from playful teasing to harsh tugs, all to stop, a single fingernail dragging along the underside, tracing Tony’s vein.
Tony didn’t remember the drive to SI, his speeding car echoing the thoughts that were racing through his head. There were already cops at the scene when they pulled up, but Tony didn’t even slow his movements. Killing the engines, he got out and began pushing through the crowds. A few policemen tried to stop him, but Tony snapped at them until they let them through.
“You sure? We can keep going like this if you’re enjoying it so much.”
“Your faith in us is astounding,” Tony huffed.
me for something
Steve was never one to let something lie – read any history book – and this certainly was no exception. “Let’s go,” Steve decided, ripping the sheets away from him and stepping out of bed. He grabbed the nearest pair of pants on the floor, tossing the other to Bucky.
Steve thought viciously, staring right back.
A fist shot out, clocking Loki dead center. The man went spilling to the ground, gasping at the force of it. Steve turned to look at Tony, the man now rubbing at his knuckles. “Fucker,” he spat, eyes blazing.
“Hey,” Tony whispered, pulling his face back so their eyes locked. “I know that face. Don’t go there.”
“Don’t,” Sam cut him off. “Go inside, kiss your husband and hug your kids.”
On the screen, clips cycled through of people in black, flowers and candles lining the grass, and a weeping mother. Text scrolled across the bottom of the video.
“You need to rest,” Barnes interjected. “You got a bed somewhere in this joint?”
know you didn’t. But do they?”
Steve rubbed at his forehead. “Look, I’ve been nice, I’ve stood for photos, signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me. But this?” Steve gestured to the costume.
“We should go,” Steve said quietly, as if he himself didn’t want to hear it.
The man shrugged. “Maybe. I’ll run some back traces and see what I find,” he said as he handed Pierce the file.
Tony just gave a bright laugh, walking to the curb and getting into the back of a car. “See you later, Steve.”
But everything had been worth it; the long gash on his leg from tripping over a fence, the splinters in his hands from hiding in storage crates, his ruined clothes from tapping out some wayward flames. Everything was worth it when he saw Phil standing on his porch.
Steve jolted at his name, Peter making another distressed noise at the sudden movement. He looked up with bleary eyes to see Pepper smiling softly down at him. She looked as she always did; completely immaculate with her fitted suit and matching heels, her hair brushed back with not a single piece out of place. Because of years of friendship, Steve was actually able to see the true distress: her pale complexion, her usually clear eyes clouded in turmoil.
“HEY!”
There was a letter, from one of the other nine to Thorpe.
Tony came back to himself when he felt someone pulling at his suit. He turned to face The Captain once more.
“Of course,” Steve chuckled. “I should have known better.”
Avengers HQ housed many floors of labs, but this one, upon a certain billionaire’s insistence, was specifically made for Tony and Bruce. It was an extension of the one back at the Tower; anything they found on missions or anything they couldn’t fit back at home was brought to this lab. Basically, it ended up being a stash pile for all the things that Steve classified as ‘too dangerous’ to bring into the Tower. Which, on principal, was pretty hilarious considering the people occupying the building were some of the most dangerous in the world.
Rumlow tried to catch his breath while simultaneously trying to make himself more presentable in front of his boss. “Sir, you’re not going to believe what I just saw.”
Pepper scoffed, insulted. “I’m the one who writes the schedule, Tony. We don’t have any business in England.”
“Security cameras?”
“So?”
“Keep the focus on me,” Tony answered. “So far, they haven’t been interested in anything besides me and my weapons; we need to keep it that way. If they start wanting to poke around The Commando’s secrets... I know I’m not strong enough to hold it in forever. They’ll break me eventually.”
pissed yet.”
"Holy shit," Steve heard Clint whisper behind him.
this was such a mess. How the hell could one single bomb be the ruin of them all? With all of them plagued with their own guilt, there was no way they stood a chance against HYDRA. The more he thought about it, maybe it just wasn't worth it. Maybe Bucky should just convince everyone to cut and make a run for it. Was there even a point to keep fighting?
Steve gasped, taking a step away from Bucky, but he continued. “Steve. He told me things. About the future. There’s this new power; a new man in charge. He’s the one closing all the loops! The call him Iron Man. And, and then! He told me he wanted a cigarette. Just a cigarette. So I untied him, and he gives me this look. And he just starts running. I knew I only had a small window to get him with my gun. He just came, and he went. And I just watched him until he was gone,” Bucky sobbed into his hands.
The pressure from Steve’s fingers were immediately gone and Tony couldn’t help but moan at the loss. “Tony? Tony, did I hurt you?” he heard Steve ask. “God, I’m so sorry, here, let me go get Bruce, he can- ”
“Shit,” Steve whispered.
“No,” Stane retorted. “We might not have to.”
“Please, Tony. Just don’t.” Steve knew exactly what the man was going to do. He would try and apologize. That after everything, Tony would still try and put all the blame on himself. Steve couldn’t bear it. Not now. “Just let me hold you, alright?”
While Steve’s crew was made up of almost every type of person, it was still a wonder that someone like Bruce Banner had ever ended up with a crew like them.
He was almost there, just a few turns away, when a hand shot out, grabbing him and pulling him down another hallway.
But they didn’t. They won. The Captain saved the day, Clint got the girl - well, the man - and HYDRA was gone.
“He’s waiting for you,” Hill said, pointing at the door. Again, without waiting for a response, she turned and was gone, heading back into the elevator. Maybe to head back to the ground floor, waiting for the next wayward soul to drag into the belly of the beast.
his property. His closest neighbors where football fields away, and there were no trails nearby that someone could stray from.
-------------------------
“Why?”
Steve’s eyes widened. “What are you saying?”
Natasha rolled her eyes again, before continuing. “So. You going to tell me how bad it is that all of this information is in the wind?”
“So it is true then,” said Bruce. “He’s not really dead?”
she thought. Same thought she had last week.
Tony frowned, but let Obie usher him from his chair and walk him towards the door. "Fix this, Obie," he said. He got another pat on the back before he was pushed through the door, the heavy wood closing firmly behind him.
“Because the physical files have something he doesn’t want anyone else to see,” Steve breathed in realization.
“Oh, right,” Tony laughed. “Once in a lifetime activity, perfect for a date.
“I mean,” Stane continued, “that The Captain just put a hit out on Tony Stark.”
Clint looked down at the half eaten meal in his hands. “I’ve never been to Norway,” he mumbled. “I hear it’s beautiful.”
“Dance with me,” he murmured over Pepper’s shoulder, not even waiting for a reply before dragging her into the throng of swaying couples. He could see the slight shadow of uneasiness pass over Pepper’s face before it was gone, replaced by a fake amusement that she’d mastered years ago. One that was eaten up constantly by both the paparazzi and the boardroom.
Enjoy! (And, yes, we are back on regular update schedule, so I'll see you all next Sunday. Be there or be square.)
“Yeah,” Steve laughed. “Surrounding mobs would ask them for intel, and the SSR would get paid in return. They grew and gained rapport – they ended up being the middle man between the different mafias. The third party that everyone could agree to deal with, because they never infringed on any other part of their business. They didn’t run guns, or make liquor – they sold secrets. Any everyone was always in the business for that.
“What?” Steve decided to bite.
“The Ten Rings,” Obie answered plainly.
“Should we send some- ”
“I’ll take care of him,” Barnes added, looking at Pepper, voice quiet.
“Such hostility,” Bucky chided, tossing Steve a small bag. “Especially when I come bearing gifts.”
The drive to Stark’s was agony. Bucky’s head pounded as he tried to think of his best move. He knew, of course, how bad of a person he was. How bad they all were. Steve was always their moral compass, always being the lighthouse to show them the small slivers of humanity they had left. But now? Now they were all so far off the reservation that there was no way to tell between right and wrong. Who was he kidding? There was no right anymore. There were only bad choices left now.
And besides, running wasn’t exactly his style. And it sure as hell wasn’t Clint’s. They’d get through this, like they always had. Phil had seen Clint and The Commando’s deal with HYDRA once. They could do it again. They
“Anything else?”
He reached down, pulling the laptop out, when he when a crinkle of paper.
Tony thought the man looked perfect before, but after this morning? There was still a 65% chance that he had a stroke.
“Good idea,” agreed Steve. He frowned however, as a thought his him. “Maybe… maybe you should do it at your place.”
“Clint Barton,” Fury continued, “who is a known constituent of The Captain. You see, I had it all wrong. You weren’t helping Stark because you were friends with him, you were helping the man because you were friends with The Commandos.”
Steve had bristled at the way people take everything for granted now. He sat and watched Clint scrape his leftovers into the trash like it was nothing, saw Natasha leave the sink on while she fetched the rest of the dishes. He couldn’t wrap his head around it.
“Well, it was because someone had marked me down as on vacation; no one even thought twice that I wasn’t in the office.”
“What, that your handler doesn’t know about Lucky?” Steve asked. “He’s a dog, Clint, I can’t imagine that this would be too much of an issue. Especially since he’s such a handsome boy, aren’t you, bubba?” Steve smiled, patting Lucky’s head.
The woman was pleading with her cat, Steve’s car was blaring alerts, the cops and robbers shooting fiercely. “Let go,” Steve hissed at the cat, his strength sending leaves everywhere, the cat itself digging it’s claw’s into the bark to try and keep its hold.
It wasn't often that Steve had the entire family at base at the same time, due to different jobs and schedules, but it seemed like everyone and their mother was cramped in their small headquarters. Steve was met with respectable nods and smiles to anyone who met his eyes, but no one stopped their movement completely, shoving past and around Steve to continue their duties.
"Oh, really?" Tony couldn't help but laugh, tugging away from him. "I could have sworn that you said that I couldn't fool you into thinking that I
“Who are you kidding, Stark? You would have been thinking about that anyway.”
“Easy now. You just got some strength back. Wouldn’t want to go wasting it already.”
to be gathering their things instead of whispering giggled insults into the others’ ears at Emily’s display. “I’ll never be as good as them,” she added.
“But- ”
“And you need to focus on the current problem, Mr. Stark. HYDRA now, Hammer later.”
“Clint, no one has ever managed to do a successful test on one.”
“She saves my life?”
a UroClub?” Tony asked with a mischievous smile.
Bucky paused, then started to giggle. “No, no way,” he said in between laughs. “No way they don’t have the right size.”
Natasha had down a full background check on Stark when they moved in (the parts that she could get access to, anyway), so she knew that the company was trying to find its footing again after Stark stopped weapon manufacturing.
“I know, I know,” Tony replied, rubbing a hand over his forehead. “But I really don’t know how else to phrase this. I promise you, it really is me!”
Tony frowned, looking down at his hands. They were shaking. “Maybe that’s not from the cold,” he found himself whispering.
it was so wrong, I see it now, but I don’t know if I can fix it, and- ”
“To get Tony,” Steve replied. “We need to talk to him.”
Sam sucked in a breath through his teeth. “Nat, you do this and you’ll be arrested!” he argued. “No way Fury lets you go into protection.”
not good.
“Holy shit,” he heard Yinsen whisper behind him.
The others started moving around the hull, collecting their belongings, but Steve found himself homing in on Tony again. He slunk over to the sleeping man, feeling Buck follow his motions like his own shadow.
He heard voices, but he was unable to make out what they were saying. Someone was touching him, hands gently dragging over his chest. Bucky wanted to squirm away, say fuck off, anything, but he couldn’t.
His blood was pounding as he sped down the streets, swerving through cars, willing himself to go faster. Hammer was lying, right? No one had ever been able to find where the base was.
“He never came back for it,” whispered Tony. The aftermath of the past mission was chaotic. Everyone was so frantic to get Tony and Steve medical attention, things just got overlooked. Natasha had said that Clint ran off to get his quinjet when Tony and Steve were being loaded on to the stretchers. Or so she thought. Everyone had just assumed that he went back for it and taken it back to the farm; back to Laura and his family.
Maybe Steve wasn’t ready, in that first timeline.
...Tony allowed the harmless stirring of happiness, observing the nicer qualities of Steve.
But right now, it just felt …
“Sounds perfect,” he nodded, and gestured to Steve,

something more. And if we’re going to be together, this is going to be a part of it,” he sighed, his tone getting more serious as he spoke. “And what I want is to be bonded to you. To drink from you, and only you, and share that possibly supernatural connection that comes with it… But I have to know that you really know what that means, and that it’s what you really want.”
“Tony-”
Having gone through the list of possibilities, Steve had concluded that this almost detached, physical mood wasn’t anything to do with any of that - but that he did now have all of those things to worry about as well, thanks.
who had to change, now was it?
Pepper sighed, exasperated and impatient, before she stepped out of the elevator and took her place next to Coulson. Tony immediately felt about three inches tall.
He imagined a hundred hypothetical futures they could possibly share. He’d panicked about every way he could potentially hurt Steve, and daydreamed about every way he could potentially please him, he’d been desperately sad to think of all the things they could never have, and overwhelmingly excited to think of everything that, maybe, they
And he was Steve’s.
And then Tony sat up,
“I’m okay now.”

He let his eyes fall shut, and thought back to the last time Steve had come to him like this. Steve’s beautiful, strong hands clawing desperately at Tony’s back, his perfect lips devouring every inch of Tony’s skin, that low, pleading moaning as he fucked into him, again and again…
“Because… I thought, at the time – I knew that you
glad he’s welcomed all those people, and I think all those people deserve that kindness, it’s just - when
And now he found himself wondering if that made everything different, if that made it
And with that there was a sudden conflict between two very fundamental parts of Tony. The part of him that was so completely devoted to Steve, that crawled towards him in spite of everything else, that already depended on Steve to make everything right and whole again… And the part of him that wanted to make Steve happy.
sense… But it would probably get the job done, and that was all Tony cared about. He’d forgotten all about it, even as he was shoving his phone back into his pocket – because he was already thinking ahead to the next thing.
But he held his body still. He bit his tongue.

knew he was wrong for. He would never have called Steve to tell him he was sorry for attacking Bucky… He hadn’t said that in the six months Steve had been back-
He was pleased that Tony had finally fallen into his natural speech patterns, that he was starting to share his thoughts as they came to him - even if that did mean the occasional tangent.
“I did mean it, when I told
And it did change something.
… But on that basis, he would probably fit in very well alongside Fury and Romanoff and ‘Phil’...
“So, all I’m going to do is explain what these are, and then I’m going to leave you be, and you can spend some time alone, away from the noise of The Facility – and take as much time as you need to think about it, and decide what you want.” …And as Belle was speaking, Steve’s head had grown ever heavier against Tony’s shoulder… “And, of course, there are people just outside, if you have any other questions, or if you’d like anything else.”
He just
“Yeah, that is ridiculous” He muttered.
“I swear to God, I don’t know,” Wesley answered, literally throwing his palms up in front of him. “They-I- I mean, I- I got into some trouble, last year. Gambling, you know. And I owed some money. And then one day, out of the blue, this guy just calls me, and says how would I like to earn half a million bucks. So, I don’t know, maybe he knows the guys I owe money to - but he didn’t even tell me his name! I didn’t know who I was working for until the camera turned up, and there was a company logo on the shipping label - I don’t even know if they’re the same people!”
“Yes, sir?”
He thought of the strange sense of discomfort that he’d started to feel the last time he was with Bucky, that feeling that it was crossing a line to spend the night there, that realisation that he’d spent the whole time thinking about Tony… And maybe it was because of the night he and Tony had spent together, or maybe it was just the way the process had unfolded, but somewhere between then and now, Steve had finally reached
that desire to exist. He feels it now.
“Come here,” Tony smiled, snaking an arm under Steve’s back and pulling him onto his knees. Steve threw his arms around him, pulling Tony hard against his chest and breathing him in.
But, as it was, he couldn’t help but feel horribly
bump into Steve before he’d worked out what the hell he was doing-
He kept his frame locked and his shoulders held firm as he ducked his head to kiss Steve’s neck again, slower and deeper than before, sucking gently against his skin. Steve gave a low, keening moan, one hand grabbing roughly at the back of Tony’s hair, his head falling back against the pillows in a desperate attempt to offer himself up – but still, Tony kept to that same steady pace. He carried on sucking faint little bruises along Steve’s throat, his hands stroking up along Steve’s chest, seemingly unaffected by Steve’s increasingly frantic clawing-
He tried to find the context around that surreal collection of images, but there was only a nauseous swirl of lights and dead space. So, he screwed his eyes shut, and told himself to start at the beginning again-
“No?” Tony asked, robotically.
Then stilling his body, until it was just a boneless weight against Tony’s chest.
He forgot to warn himself not to be smug, and just outright grinned.
Nothing hurt, nothing ached, nothing felt weary or empty or cold-
It was even in a different voice.
He was just so fucking weary, all of a sudden.
And weird, really, because Tony didn’t actually know what state he was in.

“…Hi Tony,” Steve managed eventually. Tony felt an inch of relief as he noted that Steve didn’t sound panicked or injured – that there probably wasn’t an imminent catastrophe for him to deal with.
“Oh, okay,” Bucky breathed, sounding relieved. “So, do I just wait until I see you next week?”
But, firstly, this chapter does start with smut - which is very much drug affected. Probably the most conventionally 'aliens made them do it', no control what-so-ever scenario in the fic...

Tony physically shuddered –
Tony looked up, right at Steve. Steve’s ribs clenched with a delighted shock as their eyes met, and then melted along with the rest of him when Tony smiled.

And wouldn’t that have been pitiful?
in that sense, but…” he trailed to an awkward stop, visibly struggling with the task of putting this into words.
Tony took a moment to simply look at him, running his eyes over every perfect detail of Steve’s body – feeling as though he was looking at him for the first time.
And yet Steve was lying here wondering if he’d made a complete ass of himself last night, and asking himself if Tony liked him, and what could possibly happen between them-

I mean, I’ve had my fair share of unwise one night stands while under the influence, and I’ve gone to work with people after regrettable nights before – and I know it isn’t the same. But, all of that is part of how I come to my decision on this. So, everyone is going to have a different, I don’t know, feeling, about all of this…” And he took a deep breath, and slowed himself, and made himself look Steve in the eye when he went on “And, my decision –

“Be very cold for a few hours?” Steve winced. Tony softened in surrender.
And there was a knock at the door.
Steve tense up behind him, drawing that power into him, assuming that different form… And Tony felt himself change along with it. Instantly, everything came into higher definition. The world around him seemed to slow down, enough that he could think that much faster, observe that much more…
Steve smiled.
But he

“…Even though I’m standing right here,” she added, her expression hardening into a frown.
That it was all a case of harm, and consent.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, bucking his hips, twisting Tony’s hair into his fist, tensing his back against this sudden onslaught of sensation. The wet heat of Tony’s mouth so tight around him, the firm press of his tongue stroking back over Steve’s skin… Steve felt himself writhe involuntarily, and then another surge of dizzying pleasure as the head of his cock dragged over the back of Tony’s throat. There was a hot, compulsive ache, from deep in his thighs to the small of his back, something that almost hurt but that he wanted more of-
“So, yeah, he’s either going to hate that I’m a vampire, or he’s not – and the second one is worse,” Tony bit out, feeling increasingly weighed down by all of this. “So, either he’ll run a mile when he finds out, or I’ll kick him out because he didn’t – or I just have to lie to him, and then we’re not talking about anything, are we?

How much Steve still wanted to kiss him. How much he wanted to remember that night, and relive every inch of Tony’s skin, and-
And only then did it occur to him that he didn’t really know what Steve was saying.
And it probably wouldn’t have felt like such a blow if Steve hadn’t
“Yeah… We should probably stop taking drugs…” Steve laughed.

Blushing, Tony slammed the picture down onto the desk and dropped his eyes.

Wondering if he’d come off as aggressive or immature or rude, trying to guess what Tony thought of him.
He could see Tony struggling to decide what to think about first - whether he should commit to an identity crisis, or an anxiety about the future, or his skepticism about the immediate drama unfolding in his living room…
But that was an old instinct, right? A hangover from when he’d felt like he couldn’t talk to Tony about anything… He’d spent years worrying that, if he were ever genuinely nice to Tony, and honest about his qualities, it would give him away somehow, make everything complicated, lead him into a conversation he wouldn’t know how to finish or get out of… And he was still in that habit, apparently.
“I know,” Tony cut him off…
He sat up, feeling like his body was moving half a second faster than the world around him. It took him a minute to pick out the shapes from the shadows, and, as he did, the
He could laugh whenever Tony said something funny, or clever, or adorable.
A cool chill ran up Steve’s back, as the many answers to that question ran through his head.
“Do you, uh, want to sit down?” Tony suggested, because his legs still felt weak. And Steve exhaled, and nodded, and stepped back to sink into the couch. And Tony sat at the other end, leaving just enough distance – wanting to make sure he got this out properly before he gave into temptation and just crawled into Steve’s lap
Oh, Steve really didn’t want to talk about that outburst. Truth be told, Steve hadn’t even
He turned the cold tap on full, and put his face under the spray, and tried to focus on the sting of the water.

And then the evening had just melted away from him, and before he knew it he was following Tony back down the same corridor, in the same dull haze.
“Just trying to be safe?” Steve smiled.
“Oh, I think it’s just scans of the paper file - but I didn’t look through those as carefully,” Steve admitted, apologetically. Tony looked up at him with a reassuring smile, before he stood up again and weaved his way over to one of the computer Towers.
leaves out. And do you know what, Steve?”
And Tony winced.
And he shuffled closer to Steve, until their legs were touching, before he looked up and caught his eye in a more deliberate way…
No, he didn’t want to start thinking about that again-
And, oh, how Steve wanted to tell Tony all the things he loved about him, all the reasons he’d be lucky to have him, how proud he’d be if he could call Tony his-
…And Tony had no idea where that had come from.
And then his eyes happened to fall on one of the many boxes scattered around the workshop - and, like a rescue light in a storm, it occurred to him-
“Sergeant Barnes,” Dr Stape nodded softly.
And then another thought occurred to him. Something that probably didn’t have to be
And her smile froze on her face for a second, and then flickered, and then she frowned. Tony could see her trying to make sense of all the contradictions – the competent way he was speaking versus the way he was swaying on his feet… the pleasant tone he was using to say such ominous words…
people who’d given their lives for Clint.
And Steve could just tell that Dr Stape wasn’t afraid of either of them. This wasn’t the cowed reaction they often got from henchmen – people who were scared to be on the opposite side to the Avengers, frightened to provoke them or desperate to avoid being punished by them-
“Captain Rogers,” Nick spoke first, in a cool, professional tone. “I’m director Nick Fury, of SHIELD,” he introduced himself, extending a hand. Steve stood up to take it, making sure to squeeze just a little bit too tight. And then he looked right at Nat.
know that.
But now he could think about whatever he wanted.
“So, uh, what-do-we, what do we do… now…” Steve continued talking to the floor.
It went against every direct teaching and unconscious assumption about what it was to be a hero or a man or head of the Rogers household. All those lifelong pressures, those inherent burdens, all the rules about never showing weakness and never whining about his problems. That seemingly endless parade of 1940s American Role Models instructing him to put on a brave face and put the suffering of others first and to never let the bastards grind you down…
Instead, Steve put his hand to the back of Tony’s head, still kind and gentle in spite of his panicked desperation.

And then joy
…He could imagine Steve taking an interest.
“Thank you,” he smiled, as he reached out to take it. The paper gave way easily under his fingertips, revealing a glimpse of white fabric. “Oh…”
As he was talking, Steve was picking the frame up. Looking at a photograph of Tony with his arm around an admittedly very tired looking Rhodey, in full dress uniform. Tony, smiling brightly at the camera, his chest puffed up in pride. Rhodey, looking up at Tony, a wry affection in his eyes. Rhodey definitely looked younger in it… Steve couldn’t tell if Tony did. It just looked so much like Tony – an especially nice picture of Tony, actually.

And then he looked back to Tony.

“So, I did…
Tony considered him for a moment. He would’ve liked to wonder what Steve had told the others about this little errand – but he didn’t want to acknowledge that he cared.
It was more like he could see
Oh yeah. So he had.
And Tony took a brave little breath, steadying himself. And Steve would’ve intervened again then, just out of instinct. A protective feeling that was growing by the second, a bodily desire to pull Tony against his chest and hush him and tell him everything was going to be okay… But, before he could-
It was a choice with no perfect answer - and a choice he was going to have to get used to.

But he bit it back.

And then it hit him.
A sharp cry finally broke free, as his cock pressed against the mattress - that basic, human pleasure sliding over these deeper sensations. Tony froze, briefly confused as to what to feel first, what to lean into-

It was all in his mind so quickly. At a glance, Tony knew-
...The same little swell of comfort, when he remembered Tony squeezing his hand.
“I see it, Steve,” Tony whispered, “I know.”
And Tony should probably have thought more about it, before he indulged this sudden feeling of connection… But he’d moved past that now. He’d just lived through too many false alarms at this stage, too many moments that felt like they might be the end of the world - and weren’t. He’d stopped fearing those moments when he’d remember that he wasn’t human, not because they’d stopped happening, but because every time they
you love him-”
“He’s my personal numerologist, Tony mocked back, immediately and without joy. Steve barely heard the words, and certainly wasn’t going to waste time analysing them - already his attention was focused on reading this guy, in a more detailed and determined way than he’d ever managed on the battlefield.

Trying to decide whether he was going with ‘we can forget about how angry I am, now that you’ve said you love me’ or ‘we can forget all about you saying you love me, because of how angry I still am’. There didn’t seem to be any middle ground. It was a choice between nurturing his rage or letting go of all of his feelings – and Tony wasn’t ready to commit to either, yet.
move in these things without attracting attention,” Bucky explained, as though it should have been obvious.
Tony had been holding his breath the whole time Steve was talking. When he finally exhaled there was a rush of light-headedness that seemed to spread through his entire body, making everything seem lighter and more vibrant. And, before he could work out what to call this feeling, he realised what it
And Zan actually bit her lips in an attempt to keep this in – but it didn’t work.

All the warmth and affection in Tony’s smile as he tilted his head up to kiss him goodbye…
How much he needed it.
hard to explain all this, when Bucky did eventually make him.
Steve flexed his arms against the ropes again.
“So, was that awful or nice or both?” Tony enquired kindly - which was actually stepping pretty close to the bounds of their relationship, but still technically okay, he thought.
There was a giddy surge of pure elation, as Steve felt all the things he’d never find the words for.
It would be nonsensical to let this wound fester and infect him, when he

A cold sense of dread began to rise up in Steve’s chest, an ominous sense of what was coming…
“If that makes it easier.”
Steve’s rhythm faltered just slightly, as he forced his hand into his pocket, pushing his pants further down his thighs as he grabbed the little tube of lube. He stilled for a second, leaving Tony to rock frantically against his mouth as he flicked the cap open, and wet his fingers. And then he pressed his fingertips against Tony’s hole-
Of course, the context had changed somewhat, since he woke up in the 21st Century.
“You should be out celebrating,” Nick observed, as he made the leisurely stroll through Steve’s apartment. And Steve would’ve liked to have been annoyed by the callousness of that remark, but he was too busy watching Nick run his gaze over all of his things.

“Well – first we’ll have to deal with the fact that I’ve literally shredded all of your clothes,” he commented, mindlessly-
“Pretty sure that’s my line,” he blushed, turning to look Bucky in the eyes “
“That’s your blood, you know.”
“You don’t believe in aliens?” Steve almost teased - but then he remembered himself, and the tone he was aiming for, and corrected himself before Tony could answer. “Sorry… I forget how crazy this all sounded to me, once… But yeah, he was an alien - and powerful, and feared across the universe… and
Tony warned himself not to look at Steve, and did it anyway.
assumed that Steve was ‘going along with it’… Steve might’ve felt a lot of things, if he could’ve gotten past that. But there was no getting past that – not unless he fixed it.
“She was a nurse who worked with my mom – well, I think actually she was my mom’s boss… She was another Irish Immigrant.” Steve smiled fondly, as he moved the pan onto the range and put it on a low heat. “She used to cook this by the gallon, and just hand out bowls of it to people in the neighbourhood. This was back in the thirties, when basically everyone in the neighbourhood was starving…” He was glad that Tony’s eyes lit up at that, that Tony seemed genuinely touched by the idea. “And this was cheap to make, and easy to make in big quantities, and takes about ten minutes. And you could usually get the ingredients for it – well, she could. Her husband was… Chinese Mauritian, I think? But I remember that if anyone wanted to make this for themselves, they went to him to get soy sauce… and everyone went to Mrs Sastry for rice…”
“Because the only way to beat Thanos was to use these… they’re called Infinity Stones, and I can explain all about them too, later… But, there was no way to beat Thanos without them, and by 2023 they didn’t exist anymore. Which should have made it impossible to beat Thanos, but… well, you know how you deal with impossible…” and he paused to smile at Tony - and he could swear he’d almost seen that hopeful look again, a shadow somewhere behind Tony’s features… “So, yeah, since we needed something that didn’t exist in the present, you invented time travel so that we could get them from the past. And then you used them to defeat a Titan Warlord and his entire army, even though it cost you your life.”
“No, no, no,” Tony warned, as Peter came to a deliberate stop about two feet away from them, and began searching for a clear shot. “Don’t you dare - I’ll tell Aunt May!”
“We’ve gone to great lengths to layer a cover story, and to conceal our location – put bluntly, your friends will not realise that you are missing, much less find you, before we have what we need. However, you needn’t be frightened of us taking what we need. We have to run a few basic, non-evasive, entirely painless tests. We need to take a few simple samples-”
He could imagine Steve forgetting all about it, until it came up – and then just mentioning it, like it wasn’t a big deal, rather than dancing around it or pausing awkwardly.
But he was just too nervous to keep his hands still.
He felt
...He recognised that compelling tug of interest that it triggered.
Steve wasn’t even sure if Tony had told him to lie down. He didn’t remember thinking about it. He was only barely aware of what he was actually doing, as he rushed to lie out flat against the sheets, his arms already reaching up towards the headboard-
thinking about the details of it all, not like I see it now. I think, at one point, I had just accepted that I ‘screwed up that whole thing’, like it was one thing… and maybe, yeah, there were times I resented just how much had been fucked up by that mistake…”

“Oh, you definitely have an audience,” Tony smiled, handing him another shot. Steve cocked an eyebrow, and drank it.
to your knowledge, if you push something out every time you think of something new…”
“...Hang on, let me check that upgrade is actually running, and then we’ll go,” Tony murmured, smiling as he stepped away from Steve. And then he skipped his way back over to the side of the room, still full of that same exhilarated energy…
So, after a moment’s panicked hesitation, he allowed that fear to narrowly win the conflict. He gave a little smile, and a nod, and stepped back towards the elevator.
“Hi,” Tony replied, breathlessly.
needed to hear it from me, and you’re right. I know the reason you didn’t think I cared is because you didn’t think I was sorry – and, in fairness, that isn’t the most stupid thing you could think, seeing as I didn’t know how to say it. And I know that, if I’d just said
Tony kissed him more desperately then; he couldn’t think what else to do with that sudden spike of need. And Steve moaned softly, and opened his mouth, and arched up against him –

“Well…” Steve suggested pointedly, leaning back to make it very clear he was checking out Tony’s ass-
So, really, who cared whether it had been a complicated or unconventional start to things?
what this meeting was about or who it was with or whether it went well…
They had no choice but to keep going.
This cold, seizing terror that was almost calm, this sense of resignation in the face of something too horrible to accept…
“Was that a doorbell?” Tony asked, with exaggerated confusion.
...And why his head hurt
And these were basically the words he’d used to apologise for lying to Tony. The tone he’d used whenever he’d talked about the whole thing. And Steve really hadn’t
Casually, Tony swept his gaze over Wesley’s living room, not bothering to hide that he was doing it. The inside of the house was every bit as tired and neglected as the exterior, with threadbare carpeting and ugly duct-taped repairs to most of the furniture. The couch had a visible sag in the middle where the foundations had collapsed. The yellowed paint on the walls was flaking in the corners, stained with layers of watermarks… and without any sort of decoration. In fact, there were no photographs, no paintings or mirrors, no keep-sakes or trophies, anywhere in the house…
to it, exactly… Now, it felt more like going to the hospital with a nasty wound. Treating this was probably going to be uncomfortable, possibly outright painful…
And then Tony stepped into view.
It was immediately grounding. Physically comforting, in such an uncomplicated, pure way… Just like it had been all night. Steve was conscious enough now that he knew it was strange, aware enough to be unnerved by it - but he felt it, still.
When Steve kissed him then, it was like… oxygen to a drowning man. It was a warm blanket around the shoulders of someone who’d been lost in the snow. It was like that first mouthful of cool water after days of wandering in the desert.

He was completely broken, entirely spent and exhausted-
Tony didn’t feel especially unsafe, even now. He only shook his head because he recognised the response he was
“No, I get that. I really…” and
He really didn’t know why this whole thing bothered him so much. He’d tried to analyse his reaction, but his thoughts simply ran away from him in a thousand different directions, bouncing off of the inside of his mind like this goddamn ball. He didn’t even know what to

It wasn’t long before Steve felt himself get lost in the music, bloods singing with his newest injection of serum.
“I should have known that- ”
“What are you saying?” Steve questioned.
Jarvis had liked it. Tony remembered that he used to go down to the lab to bring Tony some lunch, staying just to have DUM-E fetch things for him, as if he was playing with a dog.
Terribly sorry about the missed update last Sunday. I was in the hospital for a few days and I wasn't able to get to my computer. When I did get home, I just figured that it would be easier to just wait until Sunday rather than throwing up a chapter willy-nilly.
“I’m still not following.”
“They do not,” laughed Steve. “Don’t do it; it’s tacky.”
“Still painting.”
Tony thought. Fury was just hoping that he could keep them caged long enough to break them, killing two birds with one stone. The rest of the team would make it; their lifestyle required them to start a new identity at the drop of a hat. But Tony? Ever since making the agreement with Tony, he couldn’t help but think about going back to the life he used to lead. How he once thought that he had everything that he ever wanted – now, Tony saw that he had nothing. And that’s what he’d go back too.
After all these years, Howard still plagued his thoughts, his actions. And after years and years of defying the man - even after he was long dead in the ground - he still managed to be right. Tony had gotten involved. He had fallen for The Captain's smooth words and bright smiles. He had fallen for
“No. I won’t let you do this.”
“Fine,” Tony sighed dramatically. “I guess you win this one. But just this one.”
“Because that means the cockroaches that survived have nowhere else to hide,” answered Bucky. “They’ll have to come up for air if they want to avoid the cops. And I’ll be there, graciously waiting.”
“You know,” Tony continued. “Like a vacation. These past few months have been pretty exhausting; I think I deserve it.”
The stroll to his office seemed shorter than usual, Steve’s brain frantically thinking of something to say, anything to say, that would make this easier for Clint. But there was nothing. Any stability that he had found over the last few months were to be destroyed, brought crashing to the ground by Steve.
“And who should I say is asking for her?”
“Oh shit, Clint, I’m sorry I thought you were- ”
Tony hummed, unable to stop himself pressing into the touch.
Pepper nodded slowly, disguising the information. "Well," she said, smiling sadly, "that would be more than enough for Tony to get his hands dirty. He's destructibly possessive with those he cares about. But working with others?" she questioned, looking between the two of them.
“Can you blame him?” Clint was just as ready to spill some blood.
“Take it slow buddy. Takes a junkie to know a junkie. I’ll give you the morning to rest but then you need to get the hell off my property.”
He watched Pepper reach her hand close to Tony’s chest cavity, his fingers barely dipping below the surface before she was pulling out with a hiss. “You know, I don’t think I can do this. I’m not exactly qualified- ”
his mother had whispered into his ear as they hugged in the airport. He remembered her tiny hand pressing down over his heart.
Tony chuckled slightly, leading Steve back out of the workshop. “Good to know The Winter Soldier has his weaknesses.”
“The Captain apologizing? Did you really hit your head?”
“This is all my fault.”
“So?” Bucky asked face tight. “We own the block now, who gives a shit?”
“I’m not disagreeing,” Steve said mournfully. “I know that this is my fault. But I’ll do anything to fix it,
Rhodey and Steve got up, Tony trying to stop the blonde with a tug on his arm. Steve just sent him a small smile, kissing him softly against the temple. “Good luck,” he whispered before pulling away, nodding to Pepper on his way out.
Of course.
The Captain glared at him. “I beg your pardon?”
“And why the hell would I do that?”
Fury smirked in return. He didn’t answer, so Natasha continued. “You’re so worried about handling some of the responsibility to criminals, right? Well, we feel the exact same way. The new head of HYDRA has been under your own roof all this time and you couldn’t sniff him out without our help. We won’t be taking any chances. Pierce is going down today, with or without your help.”
Tony chuckled, the vibrations echoing through Steve’s own chest. “If you say so.”
“Ok, then. I’m heading home. Oh, you have a file from Fury as well.” She placed another file off to the side.
“You look horrible, what the hell’s gotten into you?”
“Coming from a criminal, that doesn’t mean much. Stark deserves what’s coming for him. We’re not helping.”
“I don’t get it,” Sam said. “Why doesn’t he wasn’t us to know he’s meeting with Loki?”
Fury cut him off. “I remember that kid. And I know you. I know who you would make sacrifices for. And I know that Bucky is deep within that circle. Let me show you how much I know you.”
“Pepper?!”
,” a third voice sounded, and Steve felt his legs buckle.
He spun quickly, rushing the last few steps until his body met the armor, the metal already shaping around his body. He could still hear Steve shouting at him, but Tony just blasted off, the damaged armor taking into a graceless flight.
Who were they? Steve got closer, looking over decomposing flesh and rotting bodies, clearing showing that they were anything but fresh.
he was finally able to moan out, his hands planting themselves on Tony’s hips.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Finish breakfast and be downstairs in fifteen. Fury called; we’ve got a job.” Not even waiting for an answer, she sauntered down away from the kitchen and down the hall, towards the elevator.
“Steve’s right,” interjected Natasha. “Stark has made his living through information. He won’t turn Steve in. Having that knowledge on his side is perfect for leverage.”
“Oh, sweetheart.”
“Sir, yes, sir,” Steve replied, smiling faintly.
Tony had whispered with wide eyes.
. I don’t care if you think this is God’s punishment, or another second chance; just accept that it’s happening. It’s time to get your head out of your ass. You’re not alone, Stevie. I’m still here, we’re all still here. And, well, I don’t know about the rest of the team, but I don’t plan on going anywhere, anytime soon. We
When the two finally locked eyes, Clint could barely get a word out before he was crushed into Phil’s chest. Clint could only hold on, shaking fingers grabbing at the front of his uniform as he pushed his face into Phil’s neck. His ears didn’t catch anything from Phil’s mouth, but the feeling of hot tears that stung across his neck had Clint grasping Phil tighter.
“Because you can’t shoot a gun with the safety on.”
Just a head's up: it's not gonna be pretty.
The guard leaned down listening to his radio. "There's a situation on the main floor. We'll take care of it, Mr. Stark."
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ll help no one but yourself and you know it,” Thor snapped before rushing out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
Tony twisted immediately, ignoring the tightness of his still healing body as he threw himself onto his attacker. Snatching the man by the back of his jacket, Tony tossed him into the wall, the man crumpling easily. A well timed kick knocked the man’s knees out from under him, before the same foot stomped onto his stomach, keeping him on the floor. A quick reach behind, and Tony was pulling out the handgun that Steve had slipped into the waist line of his pants, flipping the safety off and aiming it at-
"Tony, we're already doing everything we can," Obie placated. "We've called all the branches, we increased security protocols and hired more guards."
“Well, that’s great and all, but you can- ”
But Steve wasn’t listening. He practically skipped across the street, giddy in a way he hadn’t been since he was a child, listening to Tony’s complaining huffs as he dragged his feet across the pavement behind him.
The world seemed to slip away as Tony started to drown in Steve’s kisses, his mind drifting to him and Steve on the beach, on the open road, even in a damn tent. It was so
Bucky paused. “You really alright with blowing everything sky high?” he finally asked.
Barnes tried to smile. “He’s changing tactics. ‘Enemy of my enemy is my friend’ kind of thing.”
Rogers reloaded his gun, stepping into Fury’s office. He wasn’t that man anymore. He didn’t want to be.
The silence in the room was deafening, the group looking up at Steve like they didn’t understand the words that came out of his mouth.
“Where’s Tony?” Steve asked, dread filling his veins.
“We’ll call it even, then.” Steve pulled Tony close.
But then Ma died.
“Terribly well balanced, isn’t it? It’s all in the swing,” he heard Thor say next to him. Steve swung a few more times, clipping his collarbone and ribs, each thudding noise satisfying Steve’s rage. It wasn’t long before Steve dropped the hammer and resorted to his fists, his eyes closing as he blindly hit the helpless man beneath him, the only thing running through his mind was the way his hands looked in Stark and Clint’s blood. With one final knee to the ribs, Steve stepped back, running a hand through his hair, trying to get a handle on his racing pulse and pounding heart.
He needed to get back to work.
“This isn’t it,” Steve said in return, walking past her to the back of the room. He stepped over to the back corner and over to a wall lined with dusty, unused shelves. “Look,” he added once Natasha caught up with him, pointing over to a long cobweb stretched between the shelves, a breeze making the silk fluttering slightly.
In the end, Tony wasn’t really sure how he didn’t notice it right off the back. It had felt like a car was sitting on his chest, but Tony had played it off with the rest of the pain coursing through his body. No, it was the buzzing that got his attention. The constant whirring of electricity pulling his attention down to his midsection.
“Do you think they’re coming?”
pens - seemed a lot more interesting than they were before. He started to bat at one between his fingers, listening to it roll across his desk. He could feel the heat of Pepper's stare.
Everything was too fast. Too loud. There was nothing for him here. No Bucky. No Peggy. No life.
“He’s a disruptive influence,” a third voice sounded, a nerdy looking man stepping forward. “He openly mocks me in front of the class,” he hissed, large glasses almost falling off his face as he jabs a finger at Pietro.
“It’s alright,” it lulled. “You’re safe, now.”
Steve had to turn around to hide his smile, his shoulders shaking slightly as be barely contained his laughter. Tony’s face was carefully blank, but Bucky could see his eyes narrowing slightly, his nostrils flaring.
All that ended with was a migraine for Tony and a body bag for his so-called ‘captor’.
Steve looked back at Sam. “What?”
Steve groaned. His head was pounding. This future wasn’t supposed to happen. His memories were jumbling together, his past memories changing. When his new memories formed, Steve gasped. His past self didn’t run; he went back to his apartment.
“What the- Where am I?” the man managed to choke out.
“What about him?” Phil tried to ask calmly.
me, Captain. If you remember correctly I didn’t accept your job offer,” he sneered.
There was a roaring in his ears, his vision was blurry. He could feel his blood pounding through his veins. But none of that mattered. His mind was focused on one thing.
“Did you like it?” he whispered back.
“On a date.”
Steve nodded, remembering the information Tony had shared with the group when they originally started tracking down the rest of The Killian’s experiments. The Avengers had seen a lot of things, but watching the patients try and contain that power – and watching them fail – had been gruesome. Even Bruce had commented that it looked exponentially worse than hulking out.
his mother’s voice whispered in his ear.
“If they know what’s best from them, they’ll keep us as far apart as possible,” Tony smiled.
“I’ll deal with those later. You got anything on those locations for me?”
Clint found himself smiling. “I can take care of myself.”
Keep the comments coming; any feedback I get as the story progresses makes my day.
Loki opened his mouth again, but Barton held up a finger, looking over towards the door, leaning close. “He should be out of hearing distance,” he whispered, almost to himself. He turned back towards Loki. “We should be good,” he nodded.
Which most likely meant that he was just here as a cash cow.
Tony glared down at the innocent looking hat until he saw what was blazoned on the front. There staring back up at him was badge for the NYPD. Tony's lips started to form a question but stopped when he saw a tag sticking out of the hat. Tony's blood turned to ice as he read the name on the tag.
Bucky scanned the sidewalk, when-
“Kind of weird, not going to lie,” Tony admitted.
He felt Tony slump in his hold, an invisible weight gone from his shoulders. Steve felt the weight lift as well, as the ‘
Hammer watched as Pierce approached the body slowly, taking in all the apparent injuries. “They did do a number on this one,” he said. “The Captain has quite the temper, it seems. We must have him flustered then,” Pierce continued with a small smile.
Clint pouted. "So we're gonna steal them, Steve!"
It was Hill.
“Barnes,” Tony sighed.
Obie walked around Tony’s desk to clasp his shoulder, his large head leaning in close. “But it’s not enough anymore. Our stock points are still dropping, Tony. We need to do something about this.”
“Iron Man,” Steve sighed, cursing inwardly as he sounded as lightheaded as he always was when he ran into the fellow hero. The Iron Man armor glinted beautifully in the sun, the red and gold complementing each other, each curve and joint melding together to create the modern masterpiece, centered around the marvel that was the glowing blue arc reactor.
She gave a gentle sigh, the one she always gave when she knew he was lying. “It’s just, it’s been a tough couple of months for you. First there was those bodies, then you were shot, and then The Captain- ”
"I can't lose you," Steve finished, pushing his head back into Tony's chest.
“What can I say? With a hot piece of ass like you as a boyfriend, you can’t expect me to behave.”
Steve watched him go before turning back to the dead body.
Steve found out pretty quickly that the man basically lived on two things: coffee and conflict. He always managed to push Steve buttons, even manage to find buttons Steve didn’t even knew he had. Tony was rude, always showing up to meetings at SHIELD late, either completely drained or disinterested. Whenever he did pay attention, he was cracking jokes and issuing snide remarks to anyone within firing range, which usually ended up being Steve. Tony was conflicting. The man could be completely at peace on moment, and then a few misplaced words later, and Tony was nothing but a pure spitfire, shouting brash words at Steve until he stomped off to sulk in lab for days. Steve walked on eggshells, trying to get the man to take care of himself, all the while not lighting his short fuse.
“Do you have anything to say for yourself?”
Steve looked away quickly. “He’s nobody. Now. I was honest with you; you have to be honest with me. What do the numbers mean?”
“Romanoff,” Tony sighed in relief. Bucky perked up at the name, cursing internally that he hadn’t thought to call her. But thank God Nat had gone with Steve; Bucky would trust her to keep his head on straight. “That man had better be lying dead in a ditch because there should be no other damn reason why he thought he could ignore my calls. God forbid he learn a fucking lesson and read the room; maybe going off the grid isn’t the best idea while in the middle of a mob war.”
He sighed, and finished getting dressed. He tried to tell himself this wasn’t the same.
didn’t really clarify anything; other than the fact that he’d really liked it. And that’s the bit he wasn’t confused about.
, before she skipped down to join Tony.
Bucky feels as though he was impatient to wake up, this time. Like he was thinking things before he started existing again - like he came into being with a purpose.
He turned to share this observation with Rhodey - and snorted a laugh when Rhodey wasn’t there.
Steve wasn’t keeping any secrets from anyone.
...Wait.
“It’s called the Tesseract,” Fury confirmed, before putting the phone back into his pocket. “Your father fished it out of the ocean while he was searching for Steve Rogers.
…But that didn’t mean that he and Clint
But Tony knew why he wasn’t doing that just yet. There wasn’t much of this he was sure about, but he understood exactly which part of this he had to do on his own… And why.
A whole life spent with someone he loved so much that it had changed him, someone who broadened his world and soothed his pain and made him feel whole again. A life with someone who understood him, and knew all of him, and who wanted to be his equal… his partner. A life of fun, and laughter, and affection.
“Yes.”
And then he felt Tony suck against his skin.
“So, my letter annoyed you,” Tony muttered bitterly, pointedly ignoring the racing of his heart. He could see the blush running up Steve’s neck, even in the dark.
, in and of itself, and something it would be unfair to do to someone, except under specific circumstances…” He mused… Settling into this conversation in a strangely comfortable way…. “I mean, if we think about this and decide it’s just flat out
A moment when he could just kiss Steve, and run his hands through Steve’s hair, and whisper that he loved him… and for that to just be good…
Tony thought he was just waiting to see which one it was.
way to find Bucky, without even needing an access point…”
Would he feel comfortable, applying his own personal standards to anyone else? Would he feel justified demanding this much of someone else, or judging others for these very human reactions? If he were to watch two strangers arguing the way he now argued with himself, would he think one party weak for making excuses - or would he think the other party cold, and cruel, and unrealistic? Would he demand more empathy from himself, if it was someone
... And a wave of sweet, floral scent.
Tony was, observing all the wonderful little details of him as he worked. Letting his eyes run over Tony’s soft, dark hair and his delicate, skilled fingers and the curve of his lips as he pursed them in thought or smiled in satisfaction. And Steve revelled in the fact that there wasn’t the wistful longing, or the unspecific guilt, or the fear of what this was going to turn into… and he let that relief gradually melt into a happiness, and then heat to an excitement, as he thought how much he wanted to touch Tony’s hair and feel his fingers on his skin and kiss those perfect lips a thousand different ways…and that he was allowed to think it…and then, that he was allowed to do it. That he
“What more could I possibly do?” Steve roared. “How much more do you think I could fuck up? How much more do I have to accomplish before it’s safe to say that I’m royally screwed. My best friend, whom I thought was dead, is now not only anything but that, but now a brainwashed assassin for the very establishment that we spent our entire military careers defeating. An establishment that apparently, despite me driving a plane into the artic, survived and continued to wreak havoc on the world while I took a seventy year ice nap! And oh yes, let’s not forget that even though I had a chance to stop it all, I failed.
“Yes,” Pierce agreed. “Things like failure. The age of The Commandos is over. HYDRA will reign once again.”
Steve nodded. “You know where the files are going to be?”
Clint laughed at the exchange, not missing as Pietro smacked his sister on the shoulder.
The Captain ran his hand through his hair again.
Clint tried to walk past Thor. “No, we can’t let Steve kill him. We can use him for information!”
Oops. Fooled you.
Tony had been frantically calling Pepper, but to no avail. No one had heard from her.
“You eat yet?”
“Out,” Bucky snapped. Steve lifted his head to see a poor Commando waking up from his slumber, seeing Steve and Bucky, and making a hasty retreat.
“Let go! You’re ruining my boots!” shouted Schmidt.
He was the dirty jobs guy for The Commandos, no question, but Tony could start to see that Barnes had carved this little niche for himself not because to desired too – in fact, the only desire he probably had was to make sure that no one else had too. The unrewarded guardian angel, constantly laying down in the filth and the gore so the rest could walk over him unblemished.
He was gone. Rogers was gone. Rumlow had pulled him away from fighting his future self, and now, he was in pursuit of Tony.
“What’s happening?” Barned demanded.
"No. You listen to me," Tony cut him off. "Do you realize what you've just done?"
Tony gripped his chair tightly as the screen played, ready to grab Pietro and get the hell out of dodge at any moment. The grainy video progresses, showing Sitwell write something on the board and then walk back over to his desk. Upon sitting down, Sitwell jumped back up screaming about the tack.
When he finally turned, his breath caught in his throat. Standing there was the most gorgeous man he had ever seen. His tanned skin accented his dark, charcoal hair. His eyes were chestnut, with specks of amber floating around his iris to make his eyes glint bright in the light; the way they danced curiously around, looking at Steve, pierced him brighter than the sun. He was shorter than Steve, with a smaller build, but with enough firm muscle to prove to Steve that he could hold his own. Realizing he had been staring this whole time, Steve asked eloquently, “I’m sorry, what?”
was pretty good. Not sure why her FBI handler, Don, wasn’t a fan.
had - about Loki. About what he was capable of. But he hadn't listened. And then Thor had left, and Steve watched him go, feeling another supporting strut be knocked out from underneath him. Steve wasn't sure when he'd returned - after watching him leave, Steve wasn't sure if he
“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.”
The cops couldn’t touch this guy, hell, half of them didn’t even want too. The Captain had sort of this Robin Hood thing going on, protecting Brooklyn from other gangs, corrupt officials; cleaning the streets without the law getting in the way.
Bucky hummed his agreement, pulling Tony closer to him. “We love you for
“Gents, meet Lucky. Lucky, gents.”
The blonde had at some point, which remains a mystery to Tony because his drug addled mind hadn’t really clamped down on a solid time yet, had passed out on the side of Tony’s bed. Even though he more or less looked like he passed out
“Damn it, Steve,” Tony hissed. “What the hell did you do? We can’t go and blow our cover again!”
“You said it yourself that no one would have thought to look there. You couldn’t have known.”
“Might be,” Tony shrugged. “But I want to see you,” he countered softly.
Christmas really did come early. “Thanks, man,” he said, looking through the contacts.
(insert dramatic music here)
Bucky sat up and scooted closer to Steve. “Maybe Tony was right,” Bucky murmured, mostly to himself. “Did you hit your head yesterday?”
Tony shot him an unimpressed look. “He put a tack on his teacher’s chair. During class.”
Steve hummed, not looking up from where he was untangling the mess of cords left behind by Clint, set on rewrapping the microphones neatly. For as many times as he’s chastised Clint for mishandling the equipment, his friend always had the same response:
Loki rolled his eyes. “The bomb at his business meeting, the bodies at his front door. You didn’t think they would stop now that your dear Anthony has left you, did you? HYDRA wants him dead as well.”
Tony had been pleasantly surprised at Barton’s work. Of course, Tony knew how talented each of The Commandos were; he had compiled files on each and every one of them he knew about, but Tony still found himself impressed. Barton’s initial description of the guy was spot on, the large man in front of him screamed ex-military and gun-for-hire. On top of that, Barton’s shot with his bow,
