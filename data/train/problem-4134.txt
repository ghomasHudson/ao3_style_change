"Right?" Dean supplied. "Buncha damn hyphens. Seems like a cheat, if you ask me." Cas nodded. "Dean's right though, Jack hates 'acrimonious.' He always does an ‘a’ instead of the ‘i.’"
Cas looked over at Dean, watching him take it all in, watching his eyes crinkle as his body shook with abrupt waves of laughter. He reached over to take Dean’s hand, relishing it all. Dean squeezed Cas’s hand, and the next moment he was turning, still mid-laugh, to flash his smile toward his angel (now with a lowercase “a”).
“I heard you playing,” Dean stammered, gesturing in the direction of the stage with his thumb. He shouldn't mind being caught; hadn't he known the boy would come out this way? “It was really incredible.”
It was a rainy Tuesday evening, and Dean was exhausted from rehearsal. He slung his bag over his shoulder, and left the room with its old wooden floors and enough mirrors to perpetuate 600 years of bad luck. He ran his hands through his hair and took a deep breath as he stepped into the rich autumn air.
“Oh, yeah!” Charlie piped up. “That recital really is coming up quickly. Just a couple weeks, right?” Dean nodded. “Well,” Charlie beamed proudly, “I’m really excited to see it.”
As Sam giggled his way out of the room, Jack’s smile lit back up and aimed itself toward Cas. There was little the man could do in the way of turning Jack down, so he allowed himself to be pulled into the photograph session when urged. In fact, by the time Sam returned with a tray of snacks, glasses had found their way onto both Dean and Cas, and Eileen was sporting Claire’s feathers.
But then Dean clapped his hands together, loudly, and beamed over as Cas. “Cake!” he stage-whispered.
“This is for you,” he gushed, thrusting his hand toward Cas to reveal the ring sitting on his now open palm.
Cas smiled lightly again, and Dean felt him twine their fingers together. He instantly loved the new sensation of the ring pushing into his hand.
So, as Cas shifted his focus back to the present to see Dean giving him that small, wistful smile, the fondness in his eyes was almost dizzying-- overwhelming and wonderful.
"Aww, it's no trouble, now!" Garth beamed. "Anything for my little man. And," he added, shaking a paper bag towards Cas, "anything for some good old fashioned concession stand popcorn."
“Castiel, look!” Jack called across the room, pushing the glasses up onto his forehead so he could see. (Dean’s phone made another shutter noise.) They slung an arm around Claire’s shoulders and beamed, “We match!”
“N’uh,” she muttered from the passenger seat, head lolling on the upholstery. Unlike Sam, Jo’s grumpiness usually lingered well into the morning. “Volleyball.”
“Oh,” was all Castiel said. The silence should have been awkward. “Well, that’s very… kind of you,” he finally added. His tone implied that he had been having a stream of unbroken, very intense thought between the words. Dean wondered what it had been about.
He heard a door close in the distance and knew Cas must be getting home from his new routine of sunrise walks. Dean’s heart accelerated wildly at the sound, and he took a steadying breath, laughing at himself. It’s not like Cas would turn the ring down, he reassured himself. Sure, he was still maybe a little embarrassed at the inequality of his offering, but he knew that Cas would recognize the meaning behind it. And anyway, if the grace was from Cas’s past life, the ring was from Dean’s just the same. They could give each other these pieces of their old selves for safe keeping while they made their new selves together. And in that way, at least, it would be a fair trade.
Dean crossed the little room slowly, quietly, the music growing louder and clearer with each step. He carefully nudged the door open just enough to see out onto the dimly lit stage. The house lights were all off, but one strip of stage lights shone down on the old baby grand currently sitting off to stage right. That is to say, shining down on both the piano and the dark-haired boy who was playing it.
He quirked a small smile at the memory and headed for the back door and his work boots. His flannel pajama bottoms scrunched up weirdly into the tops of his Caterpillars, so he tugged them loose as he plodded down the back steps and into the scrapyard. Dean set his sights on a rusted 1987 Chevy C/K and hopped up onto the front hood; he hated 80s cars, but not everything out here was load bearing. Plus, he told himself, at least it wasn’t a Ford.
of the chocolates were nougat-filled, and it was once again Claire’s insistence that moved things along into present-opening territory.
“Yeah, I know, right? But anyway…” Sammy continued as he followed Dean to the room they shared. “Anyway, I was wondering if you had any advice?” Sammy looked up at Dean with such admiration. He was always doing that. Dean couldn’t understand what the kid saw in him, but he still thought it was sweet. “I am the
Then his eyes locked directly with Dean’s, earnest and bright and bluer than should have been possible. His lips curled into a small— yet altogether radiant— smile. “I like that.”
They cleaned up the worst of the mess in contented silence and headed to bed. Tomorrow, after all, was a big day.
After several moments, Cas finally drew back. There was an expression of heartbreaking tenderness on his face.
The love of Dean’s life was waiting for him in the parking lot. He couldn’t help but smile at the fact that he was lucky enough to have his baby waiting there for him. The ’67 Impala may have been old, but it was sleek, black, and beautiful as the day it had rolled out of the factory. It purred like an overgrown kitten, and it took Dean where he needed taking, which was more than fine by him. And anyway, driving home from class was honestly one of Dean’s favorite rituals. It was 35 minutes of chilling out— nothing but ACDC, Bon Jovi, Survivor (sometimes Air Supply, but Dean would never admit it), wind in his hair, and that awesome my-muscles-hurt-but-in-the-good-way feeling. Of course, that tranquility always ended as soon as he pulled up to Bobby’s house.
Their school’s scheduling system allowed for one free period out of seven, and Dean, Jo, Charlie, and Ash had all set themselves up to have sixth period off together. At least for this term, anyway.
Jack nodded along, brow furrowing in thought. “One ‘a’ in ‘champion,’” he said to Garth. “And a ‘i.’” And a ‘o.’”
Dean doubled back into the choir room, leaving the doors as he had found them. He hated to shut the one; the music was gorgeous, but he needed to be able to focus on the music in his head.
The sun sparkled through the leaves overheard, causing gentle cascades of light to waltz in front of Dean’s closed eyelids.
“Speaking of Dean,” she circled back, narrowing her eyes and looking around like she had missed something obvious, “where is the old man?”
He continued fussing over bowls of fruit and powdered sugar as Cas grabbed a mug and settled in at the table. Eventually, Dean stopped to survey his work. Seeming sufficiently pleased, he turned to ask, “You wanna go wake the kids up?”
He tried to breathe steadily, listening for the soft ringing emanating from the vial around his neck.
And it would have been no matter what, because they were home, because they were family-- but it was so much better for all these little things.
Jack rang out an earnest, “Oh, thank you, Sam!” at the same time Claire drawled out an overly decadent “Thank you,
“You got it!” Dean rushes out a little more enthusiastically than he means to, but he doesn’t have it in him to care, nor be graceful as he unbuttons his slacks and shirt. “Not gonna lie, always wanted to have sex in this uniform. You mind if I keep it on?”
“Yeah, that’s good.” Dean pulled away and went to grab them waters and snacks. He was nearly angry at himself for forgetting this was all for school. Nothing more.
“Now. Fuck... always. M’yours, Cas.” Dean kisses down his neck and ruts against him again. “Please.”
Coming was an entirely different situation. Porn never failed him, why was it now? It took him closing his eyes and listening to the moans and grunts to finally get little Seger on board.
“Good, then for now… you’re just a regular man, sitting down to eat dinner.” Cas glanced around what he could see of the diner and nodded to the menu. “And yes, you can eat all the pie you want… I certainly won’t stop you.”
Ares rolled his eyes. “You know damn well you’re going to brush your teeth as soon as you're done.” He walked over and kissed his cheek.
He contemplates the answer to that question the whole ride to the store, but it's hard to concentrate on anything other than Dean relaxed and singing along to the radio. As if he wasn't already handsome enough, his voice is gorgeous to boot.
known that's..." He squints, getting angry all over again. "You're so... fucking... spoiled!" He shoves him again, growling with irritation. "You think you can just go fuck with people's lives like that?"
Jask met it, then turned Ares around and pushed him against the wall a moment before he began working the plug back out of his ass. He kept Ares’ panties pulled to the side as he slid two fingers into him, groaning at the slickness from the lube. “I always want it,” he whispered, coating his cock and nudging into Ares a little too fast.
Dean jumps back, falling over his side table and knocking down a few papers. “Holy fuck! Cas... Cas I—” He rushes out of the room but he doesn’t leave, just paces back and forth for a while.
Things continued on like they always did for the next few weeks. Just an endless cycle of work, sex, and pie. Neither one of them had a complaint, but somehow, each of them also knew something was missing.
“No, he doesn't,” Cas answers for him. “Garrett, we've talked about you projecting like this. I understand your self-consciousness, but we've discussed tools and healthier coping mechanisms than passing your perceived shortcomings off on others.”
“Course.” Dean walks closer, surprising them both when he pulls him in for a hug. It feels so good to be held, but he only stays for a moment before he pulls back. “Sorry... shoulda... I dunno, asked first. Been a long time since I had a hug.”
Jask slid over the plate for Dean and he took a giant bite. “Fine, Ima find a way. I don’t quit easily, Cas. You know me better than anyone.”
Dean couldn’t fight the small laugh that escaped but he stuck out his tongue, letting Cas slide his cock along it and then dove in, sucking the head inside his mouth and swirling his tongue along the tip.
“Yes, sir.” He scoffed and walked down the hall. “He’d probably let you fuck him if you just asked, you know.”
“I couldn’t make it, I was getting laid.” The class giggled at that, and the pink that returned to Castiel’s eyes told Dean he wasn’t lying.
Her bitchface was almost as epic as Cas’. “I’ll tell him to stay outside then.” She sighed and shook her head, grumbling as she walked away from him and out the door.
It was hard to tell if Cas was pissed or not, but he went to get Dean a towel and brought it back to clean him up. He hesitated before making contact and leaned down, licking up the mess and groaning quietly before righting himself and tossing the towel onto Dean’s stomach. “Go to sleep.”
It took him a while to get this question out, he truly was scared of the answer. “Did you ever regret falling for me?”
“I’m not either, but whatever, they probably don’t even know there’s even a hidden meaning behind the gestures. Take the damn photo.” Dean posed, his left arm over J’s shoulder with a lazy smile.
He made sure to always wake Dean up happy; whether it was sucking him off, riding him into consciousness, or bringing him coffee or breakfast. Just some way to make sure his mornings were good and he associated that goodness with Cas.
“You would have finished. You’re the most dedicated person I know, sweetheart.” Dean interlocked their fingers and laid his head back, still watching Cas with a lovestruck expression the way he always did.
Those blue eyes looked right over his shoulder and Dean glanced behind him to see Henry standing there. Cas cleared his throat. “I suppose it’s more fitting now, isn’t it? We weren’t exactly
“Ruin a career is more like it... if you got caught.” Sam huffed a laugh and looked like he had something to say.
“That all sounds... super fucking hot, Cas.” Ares chuckled. “Before I gave in, I sat on Jask’s lap while he jacked off and came on my panties. Who knew they’d both have a panty kink?”
“They don’t, which is why you keep me around.” His thumbs worked over the knots in Dean’s shoulders, then made their way to his neck. “You’re gorgeous, D. I don’t know if I tell you that enough.”
Dean guiltily takes a bite much too big for the amount of people staring at him, and he looks around the room like he didn’t hear.
Cas smacked his ass again then rubbed the skin, kicking Dean’s feet a little further apart. “I want to enjoy this, stop rushing me. I’ve waited a long time to have you bent over in front of me.” He shoved a third finger in and then moaned low, pulling back to put on the condom. “Last chance to tell me to stop, Dean.”
Cas clenched his jaw, knowing it would be fruitless to argue despite the way his very bones were screaming in protest. “And what of my things? I moved into Dean’s house. If I’m expected to move into Ashton’s... I’ll need my things, I can stop there and
The showers are completely different from the ones in D — there are individual stalls with curtains for privacy instead of one big row of showerheads.
Cas struggled with how much to say, knowing he’d never told Duma about Dean being gay. “There have been some...
“I’d expect nothing less from you, Dean.” Cas grinned, shifting slightly so they fit more comfortably together. Cas knew on some level he should tell Dean that Ishim figured out who he was, but it didn’t seem like the right time. Dean had been through enough already, and telling him that would only make it worse. But there was one thing he needed to confess, if for no other reason than Dean should know that his
“That’s a bummer. I live right next door. Your other side is Mrs. Jones. Across the way is Rufus. We’re the old bunch in the court, rest are all youngins like yourself. Dean has the fancy house on the corner, that’s where the grill is if you change your mind.” He tapped the ketchup and nodded, “What was your name again?”
Cas spends the rest of his day off doing research. He visits an old cop friend, April, who gives him a list of all the jurisdictions Dean’s made trouble in — and the list is a lot longer than Cas thought. He starts small, erasing the records and memories of the folks in Tipton County that remember Dean assaulting their district attorney, then does the same in a couple of small Ohio towns. He removes any trace of Dean’s DNA or fingerprints as well as all evidence that could implicate him — security tapes of both the crimes and the stations when Dean came in for questioning.
Dean looks around the kitchen and bites his lip. “Maybe your dorm first... then here another time. You got a preference?”
Cas nodded, throwing himself on the couch and putting his feet in Dean’s lap. He didn’t mean anything behind it, they just didn’t have a lot of room. “I’m always here for a good laugh.”
She leaned in and wrapped an arm around him. “Then do it. I support you no matter what.” Jo kissed his cheek and sat back in her chair, offering a small nod towards the microphone.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas smiles softly at him. “If I'd have known you could sing, I'd have gotten you a microphone for Christmas instead of a turntable.”
Despite his uneasiness sleeping alone, Cas eventually nodded off, pleased beyond reason when he woke up naturally a few hours later instead of due to a nightmare. They’d plagued him as long as he could remember, and though Ares tried to understand and sympathize, he could never quite relate. Cas did his best not to complain, and never sought out any sort of help or sleep aids, since his muse had turned out to be  something of a monster.
“I suppose so.” The doctor eyes him, almost as though he’s reading him like a book. It's nearly uncomfortable, but before they cross that line, he speaks again: “Tell me about yourself. Are you single?”
The thoughts had him floating through the day in a daze, hardly listening to a word anyone said. When he parked in front of their house that evening, he stared at the steering wheel for so long that Jask’s car pulled up as he was getting out.
That towel was barely hanging on, the fabric dipped away from his lower back and stretched beautifully over Dean’s ass. Cas checked his watch a half a dozen times to distract his eyes
Jask just watches open-mouthed. “Um… I'm Jask. I tried to stop him, but that kinda reaction only happens with true mates. Sorry, guy.”
Cas forced his lungs to intake much needed air and moved his hand quickly, fucking himself with Woody’s cock and his own fist. It wasn’t the greatest angle but there wasn’t much he could do - Cas was hovering on the edge already like he was balancing on a tightrope.
“You're so good, Dean, so beautiful, so… you're so tight,” Cas mumbles, kissing him again and spreading his cheeks as he starts to thrust up. “Such a good boy.”
“Hi,” he says, standing up and extending a hand. “I'm Dr. Montague, but you can call me Ares if you'd like.”
“No?” He realized how not convincing that was and cleared his throat. “I mean no. I think random touching would probably happen or even a hug and stuff but I know that wasn’t what you meant.” Ares felt like he was rambling and didn’t know how to make it better. “I know they’re attractive but... you’re more than attractive. I love you.”
He's not sure if Cas meant kissing him or kicking him out, but he doesn't get a chance to ask — the lights dim for real to signal it's almost lights out, and Cas moves away to usher everyone to bed.
Heat pooled in Cas’ cheeks and he nodded dumbly. “Yes,” he said, his voice lower than hell. “It’s your bed, I’d never tell you what to do in it.”
“The usual. Some horrific monster was chasing me. At least now I know which creature is going to be interrupting my book about Henry VIII.” He nuzzled against Dean’s chest and sighed quietly. “Is this even okay?”
Just the passing thought of Cas has Dean feeling sad again, and when he reaches the bar, he opts to just go back inside and have another drink before heading home.
“Fuck…” Dean pulls him in and kisses him just to show him he doesn’t want to, and then steps back. “Dammit. M’sorry, French.” He swings and connects with his jaw, and it cracks audibly as Frenchie stumbles backward.
“I can’t. Last time we—” Dean’s jaw snaps shut and he turns back toward his son. “You said he’s there right now?”
Saliva pooled in his mouth at the sight, and Cas leaned forward, flicking his tongue out experimentally.
The noise he releases would have been embarrassing if he could bring himself to care. Dean’s wanted this since the night he met Cas, and now that it’s finally happening, he has to use all his brain power to ensure he doesn’t quickshot the poor guy thirty seconds in. “Cas... that’s... friggin awesome.”
“Yeah, he’d probably love that. We can pick him up on the way. You think... Jimmy would wanna come? They’re probably both needing a break from the baby.”
to go back to the damn class. Cas took his time, but eventually he walked back in the classroom, avoiding Dean’s eyes as he slid back into his seat.
“I mi—” Dean was cut off by Jask’s lips. He was used to Jask being pretty affectionate, but this time it was much more enthusiastic, making Dean smile against his lips. “That much, huh?” Dean licked at his lips.
“Can’t fight what’s meant to be. And based on those heart eyes, you guys are.” Jask smiled warmly and then looked toward the door quickly as Cas made his way inside. “He has a key already?”
Deciding to mess with Jask, he bit back a grin. “What happened, did they get a touchdown?” He knew damn well this was basketball and that touchdowns happened in football, but the face he made was completely priceless.
Dean huffed a laugh against Cas’ lips and pulled back. He met Cas’ eyes and knew what he wanted. “Yeah... we’re gonna have ta go home.”
“Mr. Winchester of course. No other teachers are hot here... No, that isn’t true. I’d probably fuck the gym teacher, too.” He shrugged and took a drink. His friends may be assholes, but he knew whatever he said would stay between them. He could trust them.
“We do. Once a month, actually. Thursday’s a big believer in the arts being rehabilitation tools, so he puts on all sorts of shit. Karaoke, comedy nights, plays. Seems to think it keeps us human in here so we’re not all a bunch of wild fuckin’ animals when we get out.”
Dean jogged up behind them to listen. “... well guess what, I saw you. You should just come out and say it. You’re gay, huh?”
Ares just smiled against his lips and kissed again, noticing when Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and pulled him into the kitchen.
“No!” Bobby yells incredulously. “Imagine you're a four year old boy who’s momma tells him every night that angels are watchin’ over him, and then she goes and gets
That car had been his dream since he was in high school, and thanks to a lot of hard work, his dream had come true.
“Fine,” Ares finally says after a long moment. “One more, but I'm telling him that I can't see him anymore after. And if I get in trouble… you two are taking care of me for the rest of my life.”
She spurted a laugh, her voice getting distant for a moment like she pulled the phone away from her ear. “Jesus, Dean. Seriously, stop. It’s weirding me out. We’ll get through this together, doing the absolute bare minimum of shit we have to do. But yes, I will.”
They rocked together, slowly catching their breath and Dean went a little boneless, pulling Cas back and twisting them both so he could suck the head of Cas’ cock into his mouth. He flicked his tongue playfully and let him go, kissing over his stomach and tilting his head up to smirk at Cas. “Sorry, you know I’m into extra credit.”
Dean fought the laugh, he really did, but it came out anyway. He shook his head and moved on to Hael and Ashton, surprised to see them paired together. “And who are you two supposed to be? Lovebirds?”
“Lead the way, J.” Dean offered Cas a head nod. “Thanks, Cas, see you later on.” He winked and let Jask pull him along towards his bedroom.
Jask barks a loud laugh that echoes off the walls. “No, no. I think people around here use the word "toy" a little loosely. He just wants company, honestly. Someone that isn't gonna betray him and is half decent in bed. Can you blame him?”
It’s just a field, like any one of the thousand he and Sam have passed on their road trips across the country. But it makes Dean think uneasily of that field Amara tugged him off to when she first showed up. So, Dean’s relieved when he spots another figure walking toward him. It quickly reveals itself to be Adam.
Cain grunts, swings his folder shut again, and then looks directly at Dean. “I’ve had several weeks now to consider your case, Mr. Winchester.”
“Hmm, has he?” Luke says, and his other eyebrow joins the first. He clasps Dean’s hand hard: it’s a businessman’s handshake, well-practiced and dominant. Dean gives as good as he gets. He reminds himself that Cas specifically invited Dean because he has faith that he won’t erupt into physical violence like Meg might; Dean’s beginning to agree with Meg for once.
He wasn’t surprised when the judge called out the sentence. Wasn’t fazed when Sam hugged him goodbye, whispered fervent promises that Dean’d be okay. That Sam’d get him out. Him and Mick would keep fighting. But Dean was done fighting. He didn’t want to fight anymore.
Dean gulps. “Oh yeah?” he says neutrally, even if his pulse is racing. He doesn’t talk about his scars.
“We can sense the arrival of a Nephilim,” Amara explains, as if she could read their minds. “My brother, in his weakened state, will not be able to pinpoint your location like I can. But he will undoubtedly be searching for you.”
“Say hello to Auntie Ellen, peanut,” Dean jogs Emma in his arm. Emma looks at him, still biting her fingers, now against a slobbery smile that turns her pudgy cheeks into two perfect red balls. Then she peers at Ellen again and gurgles what passes for a hello on baby-language.
“Come on, Kev,” Charlie orders. “Study break. Listen to your mother.” Kevin frowns, but he does as Charlie says. Dean’s not thrilled about the idea of a teenager trailing after them, but he doesn’t say anything as Charlie waves bye to Ash, and they head back toward the stairs. Charlie leads the way up the last flight, which brings them to the door to the roof.
is at the forefront of his mind. What happened? Jack was God and then Jack was, for lack of a better term, dead. Or, at least, in heaven. Why is he here, now? Is it real? Or is it just another cruel trick of fate? They’ll have him for just a few hours before the universe rights itself. Or maybe this really is just a hyper-realistic dream. Dean is having a psychotic episode brought on by post-traumatic stress. Maybe he’s lying feverish in some hospital bed. Maybe this is a stroke. Maybe he’s dying.
“How’re you feeling, Dean?” It’s the doctor – Doctor – Doctor Yellow-Beard with the fake smiles and stern eyes.
“Castiel, you are coming and that is that,” Anna says, and she pouts. Castiel hates it when she pouts. It turns her pretty, pink smile sad and wilted. It reminds him of how wan she looked after Mama died. On those long last days aboard the boat.
But it’s not like Cas is totally platonic, here. Dean did kiss him. And then fumblingly told him they couldn’t have sex. Maybe Cas is going to expect something more in the morning. Dean has no clue how he’s supposed to handle this.
Dean point-blank refuses to let Amara or Michael magic him to the location, so he and Cas drive a silent and tense two and a half hours in the Impala, Eileen fidgeting in the backseat.
Either Dean’s gonna get shared custody and have an even more active part in ruining his daughter’s life, or he’s not gonna get custody, and he’ll probably slink back off toward the deep end. He can’t deny that the mirage of
Kevin looks at Dean like Dean’s an elementary school bully who just demanded his lunch money. “Hello,” he squeaks.
Dean ducks into the bathroom, answers the call, and presses the phone to his ear. “Hey, Dean Winchester here.” It’s almost eight o’clock. Kinda late for a business call, but maybe Sergei just wants to wrap up the details as soon as possible. Dean tries hard not to get his hopes up.
And the panic is getting stronger, but it’s a sloppy, cloying feeling instead of pin-prick sharp and angry. It climbs into his throat and chokes him. He’s going to cry – fuck – fuck he’s going to cry, and Sammy’s
Dinner actually goes smoothly. Eileen is entertaining, chipper, and refreshingly blunt. Dean can see how she’d make a good social worker: she’s got a frankness to her that Dean wishes the CPS workers he encountered when he was a kid could have had. He gets why Sammy likes her so much.
Micah squirms a little, so Dean loosens his hold, figuring he wants to tell Dean something. Sure enough, Micah puts his hands out in front of him, palms up, and draws his arms to his chest.
He stumbles through the dark until he bumps into his still-boxed stuff in the corner. Then it’s a matter of shuffling through his crap until his fist closes around the incognito pack of playing cards and his lighter at the bottom. He opens the pack and slides out one of the cigarettes he’d stowed there. It’s not that he’s hiding them; it’s just that he really didn’t want Sam to find out Dean still smokes.
“He’s, um, pretty drunk. And he’s on my floor. I kinda need the room, so he said you could come get him –”
“S’fucking hot,” Dean defends himself. He shoves the blankets away from his lap. He’s drenched in sweat. His hoodie is heavy and itchy around his neck. He tries to tug it off, but he gets tangled in the arms. Cas takes pity on him and helps him take it the rest of the way off. It pulls away from his hair with a sizzle of static electricity.
Jack just nods. Something tightens in Cas’s chest. He wonders how much longer he can possibly protest that Jack is okay when he so clearly is not. When at any moment he might again teeter over into another Mary Winchester situation.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean says, because he knows Sam will worry worse if he doesn’t. The anti-nausea meds the docs set him up with helped a little. His appetite is better, but by no means back to normal.
Dean doesn’t doubt it. Kaia still doesn’t talk at meetings, but she’s made a habit of snagging a cigarette from Dean afterward. She’ll chat about school and Claire and Derek and mostly Claire, but sometimes also the other two girls who live with Jody: Alex, who’s in nursing school, and Patience, who is a senior in high school, same as Kaia, and apparently better at school, better at sports, better at fucking everything. But it seems like a stable, loving home, and Kaia’s been doing good there, Dean can tell because she’s put on a little weight and she’s not so quick to dodge eye contact as she first was.
Billie smiles, but there is no mirth in the expression. “God is not bound as you initially thought. The wound in Samuel Winchester’s shoulder enabled him to return. Although, he is significantly weakened.”
The knowledge slips into Cas’s stomach like an ice cube. It’s as if he knew all along, yet couldn’t muster enough courage to face it.
“Sam,” Dean cuts out so quickly, he doesn’t even hear the tail end of Sam’s question. Sam stops talking. Dean can feel his heartbeat in his ears.
before. And I assumed you felt the same. Which is why I thought you must have talked to someone. So I asked my mom, and –”
Truth is, Dean can’t risk heading back to the cooler. He can’t do that to Sammy. Hell, he can’t do that to himself. Damn near went crazy inside those four walls. And Dean can’t risk getting hurt or killed if he gets messed up with Hunter business again. He’s got a target the size of the Empire State Building on his back now, from both the Novas and Lieutenant Campbell.
Dr. Jorgensen crosses his legs. He puts the clipboard on the table by his side. Then he fixes Dean with the same look Dean’s seen on dozens of principal’s faces across the country. It’s a
Cas nods, eyebrows furrowing immediately. “Of course. Because you also like women. You’re bisexual.”
She wipes his face, afterward, and helps him lay on his side to help ease his nausea. She pets his hair back from his sweaty forehead and promises she’ll get him a cup of ice chips to suck on. Thoroughly miserable, Dean tries to get a little more sleep.
“Would you like to lay back down?” Cas asks after a moment. He’s still holding Dean, and maybe all the physical contact should feel weird, but it reminds Dean a little about those few glorious moments in bed, all safe and warm, snuggled up to Cas before Dean ruined it.
Distantly, Dean heard the door of the Impala open. Dean thought they were far enough from the car, that the checkerboard streetlamps, haze of smoke, and darkness of night were enough so Sam couldn’t see, that maybe he only saw Dean fall. Dean heard Sammy’s tentative footsteps on the sidewalk, and Dean pushed himself up, knees weak, head tumbling, vision blurry around the edges, but he didn’t want Sammy to see him on the ground.
“Hi,” Dean says, attempting to salvage the moment, but Cas is already moving away. He stands for long enough to move to the corner of Dean’s bed, far enough away that Dean can’t immediately grab hold of him again.
Meanwhile, Sam’s been lazing around, wracking his brains unsuccessfully for some kind of career that demands the kind of talents he’s acquired through hunting – because it’s not like hitman or cat burglar are viable options, even though Sam certainly has the skillset.
“You’re safe,” he whispers to Dean. Dean’s eyes swivel from Sam to Cas, latch onto the angel’s face. “Your brother is here. I am here. I promise you’re safe, Dean.”
Dean swallows hard, but the knob is still there in his esophagus, so he clears his throat a couple times. He doesn’t know what to do with his hands; he’s not close enough to clap Sam on the shoulder. So, he just nods at Sam and coughs out a tense, “Thanks.”
Then Cas fishes under the pullout mattress for a minute until he pulls out the shoes he must have taken off last night. He shoves his feet in without bother to untie the laces. He stands.
Charlie shrugs. “I was gonna say ‘aggressively vocal in my fight for the honor of girl gamers everywhere,’ but, sure. I mean, don’t get me wrong, he was a sexist pig, but I usually operate under a strict don’t-feed-the-trolls policy. But I got dumped yesterday, so I was grumpy.”
“Shit, man,” Dean says. “That’s cool.” Dean doesn’t know shit about art. He has no idea what he’s supposed to talk about now.
It feels like getting impaled all over again. Dean bites his lip against the physical pulse of pain. Shit. It’s been two months; a kid as young as Micah might have a pretty short attention span, maybe not the greatest retention skills yet, but like hell is he going to forget his mother so soon.
There are bodies and voices in the room, hands on Dean’s shoulders and he’s wrestled back onto the bed. His hand connects with flesh and someone yelps
“I don’t know,” Cas shrugs. “I understand this is an Italian…is it stereotype? But I do not believe we all have mafia ties.”
“No problem,” Dean says, dropping his hands immediately and averting his gaze, adjusting the cuffs of his jacket.
Lydia still looks unimpressed, but a chipper voice says from within the house, “Someone say brownies?” a blond woman with plump, red cheeks comes into the hall. She’s got Emma in her arms. “I don’t mind if I do.”
She pauses, like maybe she’s expected Dean to reply. Then she adds, “And that’s about it, I guess. I’m self-aware enough to know some of what Gilda said was right. I say I like my life right now because I’m comfortable, but, really, I think I’m scared. I like stability so much because I know what it’s like not to have it. And the idea of uprooting any of that – even just looking for a different apartment, let alone cohabitating – terrifies me.”
But tonight, Dean sends Charlie a text and then creeps over the couch to climb out of the window onto the fire escape. He leaves his curtains and window open enough so he can still see and hear Emma sleeping.
She steps back over him and sits down on the bed so she can put her four-inch heeled boots back on. Dean’s glad he never really had to dress up for the part. Pair of low-slung jeans and a tight tank top, and he was golden.
He catches sight of Bobby’s cap hanging from the bedpost, a pair of clunky work boots by the closet, which is partially open, allowing flannel shirts and worn-out jackets to spill out. The room smells like Bobby even stronger than the rest of the apartment does: like motor oil, cigar smoke, and old whiskey.
Dean stopped paying attention when Jask took the box and became Mr. Macho with the top, and found himself another box.
He hadn’t, but that only made him laugh harder and kiss him deeply. “They’ll never believe I’m serious, babe. Don’t worry. You seem entirely too… proper for something like that.”
He sighed, knowing no matter what, no one told Dean Winchester what to do. The video would exist until Dean got tired of laughing at him. “Glad I could amuse you, Dean.”
Soft lips pressed just above his nipple. “Then cut your hours back. I’m already making more than enough off the other books, if you dropped back to part time... you could have the best of both worlds.”
all my fucking work.” Dean’s fists clench but he starts walking, not wanting to deal with fucking Butcher, too. “I'm not sucking you off again.”
Dean huffed a laugh and then kissed his way down Cas’ body slowly. He bit the top of his pants and tugged, looking up to meet Cas’ eyes before he started unbuckling his jeans.
“No, no, please.” He motions to the seat Castiel normally sits in. “That was just... an unexpected... meeting.” A faint blush touches his cheeks and he clears his throat.
He came, covering Dean’s hand and exposed chest, slamming back down. “Come in me, Dean. Fill me up, make me yours.”
After talking to Charlie, he still wasn’t any closer to figuring out the best way to propose. They all seemed too cliché, too boring, too extravagant... just not them. He was completely stuck in his own head during dinner with Cas, and he felt bad for not giving him his full attention. While he washed dishes, Dean walked up behind him and kissed along his neck, wrapping his arms around him tightly. “I still love how good you look in this kitchen. It was just a house before you. Now it’s a home... you’re my home.”
Jask cleared his throat loudly, but Cas didn’t care. He’d take Dean right there in front of everyone if he had to — he needed him, and nothing in the world would get between them again.
Cas shook his head. “No, because there’s no way I’ll be watching anything but your mouth. Your safety right now is more important than me getting off, now go to sleep.”
Lee rolls to grab the calendar off the wall. “With good behavior, I should be out in a couple of years. I got fifteen, but Thursday's made damn sure I won't have to serve all of it. How many inmates can go to their parole hearing and say that while behind bars, they became the first member of their family to graduate college?”
“Either way, we’re starting fresh. There’s a list here of potential witnesses we’re supposed to interrogate… Do we want to split up or stick together?”
“Yes if course but... it’s a long time apart. I would definitely miss you.” Ares pulled Cas in to kiss his temple and leaned on his shoulder. “Cas... why do you think we haven’t taken the next step?”
He huffed quietly at his own insane thoughts and rolled to face Dean. The curtains were cracked, so a thin sliver of sunlight was peeking through and casting a gorgeous glow over an already breathtaking face.
He curses himself for never going sober, but sobriety hurts. That used to be metaphorical, but for the last several months, it's become a little too literal. Part of Cas knows he has a problem, knows that he should stop… but when drinking is the only thing that gives him the courage to talk to Dean, what's he supposed to do?
“Yeah. I think it’s only fair to go into the second half of this knowing what’s what, you know?” Jask kissed his skin and shifted a little behind him. “If I were Dean, I’d want to know. We talked about this before I even left, it’s not like he doesn’t know it’s a possibility. You gonna tell Cas?”
“That’s not a good excuse to ignore me, Cas.” She heaved a dramatic sigh and shifted her books. “I won’t press if you don’t want me to, but I’m tired of eating lunch alone. Just… come have a meal with me, okay? I promise I won’t be nosey.”
Slowly, Cas mouthed over Dean’s clothes and shimmied down until he was on his own knees with Dean’s bracketing him. He kept his eyes locked to those gorgeous greens as he palmed Dean’s crotch, waking him up. “Did you ever fantasize about me before this all started? It’s okay if you didn’t.”
Once he did, Dean shut the door and got in himself. Cas looked right at home in the passenger seat, like the leather was made just for him. When the engine roared to life, Cas bit his lip and shifted. “I think we could skip the bar altogether.”
Jask clapped his hands together once and leaned forward. “Then it’s settled. I’ll take my shit with me, and at some point… you guys can come get Cas’ stuff.”
He wanted to talk to P so badly, to tell him how perfect his ass felt, and he hadn’t even slid inside yet.
“I’m still trying to figure that out, honestly. I wrote two opening chapters and trashed them both, so… as of this moment, I’m back to the drawing board,” Cas lamented. “It’ll come to me.”
Jask scoffed with a playful smile. “This month is gonna get real awkward if you don’t even flirt. That’s roughly 96% of my personality.” He folded his suits over the back of the couch and nodded. “Hungry though, yeah. Always. I’m kind of a bottomless pit.”
Everything with Ares was incredible, and Jask hoped to the bottom of his heart that the next two and a half weeks wouldn’t prove him wrong. He wanted this, wanted Ares, wanted it to be
He wasn’t five minutes down the road before his phone chirped twice with the tone he’d specifically set for the Pinocchio app.
He listened to Dean singing quietly and tried not to smile, feigning sleep, but when he started into a Bob Seger song, Cas couldn’t fight a sleepy smile.
"Mmhm." Cas walked by, getting a nice whiff of Dean's delicious cologne and ran a finger along his back as he passed before plopping into his seat next to Jimmy. "What's for dinner? I'm dying for some meat."
Cas watched Dean climb into bed with a heavy heart and a cock so hard he could barely see straight. The taste of him still lingered on Cas’ tongue, and all at once he hated himself for licking him clean.
For some reason, Cas was in a mood the rest of the day. Everyone and everything was annoying, and when he finally got home, he decided to be even more bratty than the last time. He stripped off everything but Dean’s hoodie and grabbed his dildo.
He snatched the sucker, popping it into his mouth and standing up. “C’mon, J. You said you’d kick my ass at hoops… time to prove it.”
“I thought your boytoy moved on?” Garrett asks, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. “Isn't he with that giant kid now?”
“It’s honestly a travesty that you didn’t.” Cas set down his mug, feeling terrible that he cost Dean yet another form of pleasure. “Go, finish.” He pushed Dean lightly, trying not to gasp at how firm and solid he felt under Cas’ palms.
He flipped over onto his hands and knees, accidentally kicking Dean in the process. After a whispered apology, Cas rocked back, arching to show Dean exactly what he was about to get.
Cas studied him for a moment with a strange look on his face. “Probably who’s house we’re keeping when we move in together, because at this rate… that not only seems inevitable, but we seem to be compatible in just about every way.”
“Nah, I’m not done with you yet, Pegasus.” Dean smacked his ass with his bottom lip between his teeth, and kissed him again. “Food, or your gonna have to carry me, and I don’t know how that will work.”
“That would be swell. I have some cash in the mattress.” She pushes the sandwich into his hands and then shuffles to her bedroom. When she comes back out, she sets the money on the table and starts making them some tea. “Don’t forget my chocolates, Charles. You know they’re my guilty pleasure.”
give him the motivation to cash in one of his currencies when they got home. “This one.” He fished it out of his wallet and smacked it on the table. “You blow me with your hands tied behind your back.”
“Fuck, I love you. I want you. I need you. Fuck, just c’mere. Please, Cas. Take me.” Dean doesn’t care how desperate and needy he sounds, he trusts Cas with all of him.
“Can I —” Cas’ breathing gets a little ragged and he nods quickly, palming himself. Normally he'd be too scared to try something like that, but with Dean… even if someone caught them, they'd never have the balls to say anything about it. “Holy shit, yes. Do you have lube?”
Cas gripped the base of his cock tightly and rutted against him with a grunt. “Yes.” He started stroking again, sucking on the side of Dean’s neck, marking what was his while scissoring his tight hole.
But Cas had been found out — someone in his garrison had told his superiors of their connection, and he was thrown from Heaven. Desperaged, Cas fucked his way through Heaven, Hell and Earth trying to forget… but it never quite worked.
Maybe pulling from a movie about pirates isn't the best idea he's ever had, but he can't help it. It's true, he might be in the middle of a mental shitstorm, tossing around in the deep sea of loss and despair and grief in his mind… but there is hope on the horizon. There's
Dean leaned back, gripping the tie and pulling it tighter until Cas’ mouth was open and stretched. He groaned happily at it, his cock pulsing in Dean’s hand. “Fuck, Cas. You like that, huh?”
“Fucking good. Keep your hand there baby.” Dean started thrusting against Cas’ cock, moaning at how amazing his hand felt.
He responded with the truth, more or less, but left out the details about his daydream. He spent the next few minutes walking around, eavesdropping on conversations. “Okay, your ten minutes are up. Now, does anyone wanna share their new identity with the class?”
“I won’t. I’m sorry, baby. I want you to come back here and know for sure. If I force you into anything, you might still wonder. Do what you have to and I’ll be here... regardless.”
A soft whine left Cas’ chest. “Right, that’s tomorrow. Do you think that’s something we can call in sick from? I’m not looking forward to it.”
Dean’s grin was infectious. “S’okay, Betty. I can go easy on you if ya want.” He lined up and shot another inside. “Or...” He sunk another. “We can just skip this and get to those tattoos.” He swallowed down his drink and lined up again, unfortunately missing this one. “Shit.”
Dean quickly flipped off him and stood next to the bed, both of his palms up. "M'hard again too. Fuck... not touching you is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I've never been with anyone so responsive to my touch. I want to spend an entire fucking day learning every inch of your body."
Jask fell silent with an eye roll, but started laughing at something halfway through. It was times like these that Dean remembered how damn simple everything was for them. All his friends had relationship problems but not them, it just worked. He’d truly never felt more comfortable.
He smiles seconds before leaning in and kissing that baker like his life depends on it. Dean moans into the kiss, sliding his tongue into Cas’ mouth and wrapping his arms around him, pulling their bodies flush together.
“Cas, wait,” Dean said suddenly, stepping between him and the door. He glanced nervously at a couple of students that stopped to give them a weird look, and he hardened his voice. “He tried to skip, Miss Missouri isn’t the only one that gets to scold him for it.” They moved on, and Dean turned back to Cas. “What happened? Are you okay?”
Cas blinked, irritated at himself for not thinking to ask for a photo while he Jody on the phone. Thankfully for him, Jody was ahead of the game. His phone chirped and he glanced at it, smiling when he saw the selfie of Jody and Havoc. “Here.” He handed the phone to Dean and smiled smugly.
“Things are good, I mean… he has a key now. But… things aren’t going much further. For one, we have to be a damn secret. And for two, he plays baseball and their seasons are like two years long. Mix that with
Jask kissed the top of Ares’ head and kept him close, rubbing one of his broad hands along Ares’ back. “Then stay right here as long as you want. No pressure, no judgement.”
Time dragged as Castiel tried and failed to write. It was one of the few silent ways he could think of to pass the time, so when that didn’t work, he curled up on the couch to read. A couple hundred pages later, his eyes were burning and he was sure Ares would have to wake up soon, so he set the book down and started fixing dinner.
“Yes, he probably corrupted you.” Amara looked over at him and then back at Dean. “I’d like to know how this started. Not physical details, Castiel.” She held up her hand as if she knew he was about to say inappropriate things. “I’m asking how you guys originally crossed that line from student/teacher to lovers. What do you see in him?” Cas looked over at Dean, his eyes giving away his concern.
Dean instantly followed, sinking all the way down and coming all over Cas’ dress shirt. It was one of his favorites, but in that moment, he couldn’t bring himself to care.
“I’d love that, actually.” Ares stood up from the table to go clean the kitchen. “Are you too full to go now?”
The next few classes were torture. After their discussion about moving in, Cas started sending dirty texts that made Dean wish they were actually doing it.
He points his fork in that direction. “Cause he just looks like the type of dude that would still be suckin' his mom's tit, that's why. Hey, we're inmates... not poets.”
“Mmhm. More.” He kisses Cas, but this time, his lips are parted in a smile. “I liked that nickname by the way. Sweetheart. I approve of that one.”
With a playful eye roll, Cas sat back in his seat. “Compliments to yourself, then? And it’s… interesting. We top for each other, but there’s always something missing. We usually stick to hands and mouths… we have absolutely no issues in that department. What about you and Jaskier?”
“Mind? That’s my favorite position.” Winking, Jask pulled him toward the bathroom and started the water. “Did uh… you and Cas do this a lot?”
Gold flecks burst through the green in Dean’s eyes as he blushed, and led Cas to the couch without even trying to fix his hair. “Good, maybe that’ll distract you from the fact that I was watchin’ Jeopardy.”
Cas moved to straddle Dean and slammed their mouths together, desperately pulling on his gorgeous hair as he opened for Dean’s tongue. He could feel the exact moment Dean stopped fighting it — his body relaxed and his knees spread a little to support Cas better as his hands snaked under Cas’ shirt. Dean moaned, licking into his mouth and pinning them together with strong, sure arms.
Dean blinks in surprise but Cas doesn’t miss the small smile on his lips when he grips Cas’ trench coat. “I think you meant this.” He pulls him in again and kisses a little deeper. Cas can feel the nerves radiating off of Dean, but he masks them with a faux confidence. Even in Heaven, Dean has his “give ‘em hell” attitude, and Cas suddenly realizes that even Super Mega Hell™ with Dean would be worth it.
A little confused, Jask hesitated, but quickly lost himself in the kiss. He picked Ares up again and spun around, sitting down on the couch with that gorgeous man in his lap.
“I think we’re pretty damn cute too, babe.” Dean kisses his cheek and then moves to kiss his lips, slowly backing him against the fridge.
Cas could hear and feel when they pulled off the main road and soon they were coming to a stop. “Alright. Ima help you out of the car and walk you there, then we’ll take it off... for now.”
Cas’ expression went from smug when he thought Dean was on his side to outright betrayal. “It’s hilarious to me that
By the time he was fully seated, his breathing was hitched and ragged, but Dean kissed him hard to distract him until the burn faded out and all he was left with was pleasure. Cas rocked tentatively, groaning at how full he felt already.
Dean cackles at that because regardless of his age, he’s still a child inside. “Buttsex,” he repeats. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t slightly relieved at Cas’ choice. “I get it. Gonna be hard to not touch you all weekend.”
Azrian suddenly looks down at his stomach and trips in the process, nearly dumping the stack he was carrying but catches them at the last second. “I don't, no. I was kinda dating this guy before, but he ditched me when I got arrested. I can't really blame him. Do you?”
“Then let me take care of you one more time before I go.” He kissed over Ares’ chest and down his stomach, wishing that he went shirtless more often. As he tugged on the fabric, Ares got the hint and sat up to pull his shirt off, then wiggled out of his pajama pants to give Cas a clear shot. He took his time, kissing over his skin and smiling at the way his stubble made Ares gasp, then took him in his mouth, sucking slowly. As Ares hardened against his tongue, Cas ran the pad of his finger over that tiny, glorious ring of muscles. He couldn’t quite bring himself to top, not when they’d just had a conversation about being honest, but he
Dean looked down at the cup in his hand, processing that information. “Probably hate me too since I denied who I was for so long... Alright, whatever. I’ll quit
“Seriously? You can’t even go to the bathroom?” Cas sounded pained already, and his eyes were glued to Dean’s hand.
His bodyguard was hovering like an asshole but made no move to pull Dean out, which he took as the greenest of green lights to carry on with what he was doing. He winked at Asstiel and blew kisses to the crowd, turning his back on Hottie a half second before he reached Dean and stuck his hand out.
Monday was his birthday, and he was just sad. Not ‘cry me a river’ sad, but sad enough to ditch Dean’s class for sure. As luck would have it, he got caught not even five minutes after the bell rang and Miss Missouri was more irritated than he'd ever seen her. After a lecture and a call to Aunty Amara, she personally escorted him into Dean’s class.
Dean ignored him, continuing to stroke himself and moan Cas’ name. He pictured Cas storming over and nudging his legs apart, sliding inside quickly to fuck the brat out of him. “Ah, shit... fuck me, Cas.”
Cole laughs and Dean can hear him shuffling around. “You know, there’s more to my life than being Dean Winchester’s friend, bitch.”
Seconds later, all contact stopped and he heard the sink running, then he caught a glimpse of P’s ass as he walked out the door without a word.
“Leave? You never leave. Where?” Gabe asks with a worried expression. “What happened? You were just all smiley and crap.”
“Ehh, probably not. Oh, what about building furniture together, or like a weekend with no technology. I mean they’re boring but force them to communicate right?”
be good. Still a pain in the ass, but... I think maybe it's time I return that particular favor.” He trails his fingers along Dean's shoulders and down his side, then slides his hand down his pants to palm him as their bodies press together. “I wasn't gonna do this, but I'm thinkin' maybe it's smart to get in here before the guys in prison use your pretty ass up. What do you think?” he asks as squeezes his cock through his boxers. “Maybe a little practice run before you hit the big leagues?”
Dean dug his fingertips into the cut on his palm to stop himself from getting equally hard, and attempted to hold his composure. “Your aunt said history was your favorite subject. I kinda thought it was just me, but now, I’m startin’ to believe her. You did good today, Cas.”
"Thank god. Watersports is a hard no." Ares grinned at whatever Jask's face did at the joke, and he closed the door behind him. "Do I have to comb you daily?"
“Me too.” Dean mumbles, his body shuddering above him. When he finally can’t take it anymore, Dean pulls back and rushes out, “comewithme” seconds before slamming their mouths back together.
“She’d love my oats. You’re depriving her just as much as me.” Dean rolls his eyes. “Whatever. I won’t fuck his sister unless she tries first. Deal?”
On one hand, Cas wants to argue that not having a normal life isn't an excuse to act like a spoiled playboy. But on the other, he'd be lying if he said the attention doesn't feel good. “Oh. Well, to be fair… I'd have said no if he would've asked me on a date.”
Jask frowns, then drums a quick beat on the table. “I get it. Maybe you should think about giving someone a second date, huh? I mean, if your guy moved on, maybe you should, too. Don't torture yourself.”
“No, it does. I can see that you love him and I know that means you wouldn’t recommend something that could ruin his future. Do you think you could ensure he dedicates time for homework every day when he’s at your house?”
Cole took that as a green light to leave and said his goodbyes as Cas pulled up Dean’s calendar to look over it. “Yes, but the convention is in LA so it should still work.”
“I’ll cancel. I don’t care.” Dean huffed a laugh. “Fuck all these people.” Cas’ phone started ringing and Dean frowned. “That asshat?”
He got up, making his way to the sink to wash up and then went to lay his forehead against the closed door. “How did I taste?”
“Thank fuck. Lay down.” Cas grabbed the lube and could feel his hands trembling as he warmed his fingers. “I’m really not going to last long. Did you last long your first time you slid into an ass?”
Cas didn’t respond right away and when Dean glanced up to see why he saw him staring down at his phone and drumming his fingers on his desk, almost as if he was nervous to answer. Dean followed up quickly, his cheeks flushing.
Both boys rolled their eyes, but since Dean was standing behind them, he didn’t see it, and Cas let out an exasperated but near silent sigh.
What that meant, exactly… he didn’t know. Part of him thought they had just reached a point where they didn’t need to speak beyond setting up their trysts, but louder thoughts suggested it was deeper than that.
It doesn't take much to find Dean — he’s decked out in a light grey suit with fucking sunglasses on.
The moment Cas breaks the kiss in favor of biting his neck, he knows they're both goners. Maybe dry humping each other in the back of bakery in the middle of the day isn't the most romantic thing, but Cas doesn't seem to care — he's all soft whispers and quiet moans as his teeth graze Dean’s skin, and his grip tightens on Dean’s hips a moment before he gasps. “I'm… Dean, I’m…”
“Honestly… looking at you blindfolded is making it a little hard to think.” Cas held something to his lips, and Dean extended his neck to actually bite it. It was round, small, and tough to break off… but friggin delicious.
“Yeah, he’s got a bi- never mind.” Amara gave him that look that said he’d crossed the line, and he chuckled before heading upstairs.
Dean smiled and kissed him again... and again... and again. “You know how many texts I typed and backspaced that week?”
probably got quite good at it in Cellblock D, that's not how things are done here. You will be expected to do your part, to show up for your assigned classes, attend meetings, and do your work, but you will not be expected — or permitted — to touch any of the guards. What you do with your fellow prisoners is none of my concern, though there are bottles of lubricant in the drawer in the rec area. You don't need to waste your commissary money.”
“It’s your house, too. You have every right to tell me to jack off in the backyard if you wanted.” He pulled out his mug and took a long slip before talking again. “Have you... you know... since you been here?”
“What does that even mean, ‘not a good time’? You leave a note that says ‘I love you’ and then disappear without a word. Look, just tell me you’re comin’ back.”
It worked so thoroughly he didn’t even hear the bell ring. Cas didn’t hear or see anything at all until a big, callused hand slid over the back of his head. He looked up to see Dean, who was grinning at him. “You okay there?”
Dean snorted and sent back a shrugging emoji, then pocketed his phone. Fifteen minutes later, Jask knocked on his door. “What the hell, D?” A rolled up bundle of fabric was pushed against Dean’s chest, and he gagged when he realized what it was.
Dean followed behind him and shut the door quickly, immediately shrugging off his jacket and kicking off his shoes. “Fuck, I actually can’t wait to have you inside of me.”
“The... aardvark, as you put him.” Cas smirked, standing up and tugging on the front of his jacket to smooth it out. “Not that it's any of your business, but I’m actually a hard top.”
He couldn't help Cain. Getting involved with him again had only made things worse… and Cas refuses to make the same mistake with Dean. He will not fail Dean the way he failed Cain… no matter what it costs him.
“Why’d ya lie? I didn’t know we were the lyin’ kinda peoples.” Cas started talking but Dean spoke over him. “I broke up with Jask, ya know. Not for you, you obviously don’t want me now that you got what you wanted. But just… cause.”
Abaddon showed up right as Benny was pulling back and plopped down next to him, reaching over to fist-bump Benny. “Hey, fuckers.”
“Ahh, fuck, right there,” Cas moans, reaching down to grip his leaking cock. “That's it — fuck, you're big.” He bares his neck a little more, going pliant under him and letting out a whine, and Dean has never felt better in his entire life.
Dean visibly relaxed and looked up at Cas. “Shit, I thought you were mad at me for that. That... ‘release’ was...”
“Probably because we’re adorable.” Dean took a bite with a grin. “Or at least I am... J needs a haircut. It’s outta control.”
"You got it, bossy." Dean spreads his legs and also his cheeks with his palms, showing Cas that sinful hole he's about to wreck.
Dean grinned and shrugged his arms in a carefree manner. “Probably. We’ll find somewhere. Let’s get back on the road, I feel much better. Thanks, Cas.” He kissed him one more time and interlocked their fingers.
There would be nothing in the world that could save Cas if he had to listen to Dean Winchester coming by someone else’s ministrations. He nearly screamed the end of the creed in his mind and would’ve covered his own ears if he wasn’t so serious about keeping Dean safe.
“Hey, Novak.” He walked over looking ridiculously hot in those above-the-knee red shorts. “Wanna show these numbnuts how to hit a free throw?”
Cas moans, still hard as he wraps his wings around him to cocoon them. “I've wanted you since the moment you set foot here.”
“I’m perfect for all of you, damnit,” he teased, leaning back a little further until he could grip the edge of the coffee table and plant his feet on the cushions. He prayed to a god he barely believed in that the table didn’t move too much as he dropped down harder, faster, groaning loudly when Dean’s hand took over on his cock and stripped him perfectly. Within seconds, Jask was coming in hot spurs all over Dean’s chest.
Before Winchester could answer, a student walked in for next period and Cas smirked as he turned away. “See you tomorrow, Winchester.”
Within a few seconds, his hands were wet and on his thighs again, this time between them and sliding towards his crotch. The ghost touches had him absolutely vibrating with need, gripping the sides of his chair and thrusting up. “Dean!”
Dean’s face was buried in the mattress, but it didn’t matter. Dean practically screamed, “Fuck! Yeah, please... fuck, fill me up, Cas. Come in me, fill me -”
“You’re just as clingy as he is, don’t even try to deny it.” Cas raised an eyebrow and tried to wrap his lips around the neck of the bottle, but the angle was weird and some spilled out. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “What’s she like?”
Cas held the wriggling, squirming dog in his arms and took a deep breath, opening the door and stepping inside. He’d watched Dean with Chaos enough times to know that Dean desperately wanted a little fat dog of his own, and after a couple of weeks of interviews, tests, vaccines and the like, Cas was finally bringing Chaos’ brother home.
Cas frowned, letting out a measured breath. “I’m probably overreacting, anyway. I’m sure Dean and Jask are happy with each other, there’s no reason to think anything would happen in the first place. But you’re right, I should talk to him before I leave.”
Dean scoffed at what he thought was a joke, and then sat up. “Seriously? Cas, he should have held you or somethin’. J has nightmares sometimes, and I always wake up. He doesn’t really care about the comfort part but it’s hard not to wanna help.”
They stopped outside of the game room and the assistant took his leave. Once more, Cas braced himself and walked in. “Hello, Mr. Charles.”
Cas squeezed the sides of his throat harder, slowing his thrusts and flicking the ball of his tongue ring over Dean’s earlobe. “Because I was trying not to do exactly this.” He dropped his hands and bent Dean over again, barreling into him and digging his fingertips into Dean’s sides hard enough to bruise.
“Guinea pigs? You want one?” Dean pulled out his phone and started scrolling again. “Havoc needs a friend, you’re always at my house. Get one.”
nearly looks like a demon. “Get back on the bed. Now. However you're comfortable.” He doesn't wait for a response, just opens the door and slams it behind him. A moment later, he can hear Jask barking a laugh and a sound that likely means Ares slapped his shoulder, then the front door slams.
“Alright, alright. I’ll behave,” Jask said, but didn’t quite sound genuine. “At least until tomorrow right?”
“Got a boyfriend, Thursday?” a man named Garrett asks in a teasing tone, and it makes Dean’s concerned eyes shoot up at Cas with a small frown on his face.
Cas grinned, biting his bottom lip and reaching down to stroke himself as he sped up. “Last time I… rode you, I came on nothing but your cock.”
Once it ended, Dean was torn between making Cas watch more movies and actually getting some sleep, but felt it was best to just turn in. “Alright, Betty. You sleep good.” He winked and made his way towards his room, singing out obnoxiously, “Call me Alll!” And then whistling the tune as he closed his door.
That wasn’t necessarily untrue, but Cas was equally to blame and it didn’t matter whose fault it was. He held tighter, his heart hammering hard enough he feared Dean would feel it. “I’ll find my way back. I will.”
“Yeah. Course. It’s just... energy is weird in this place since Cain. And friggin Cas keeps disappearin’.”
Cas pulled back, messy as hell, but with a sated, almost dopey smile. He looked up at Dean and again, nearly word-vomited all the things threatening to explode out of his chest. He stood up, fixing his jeans and wiping his fingers on his pantleg. “We should go on walks more often.”
A wide, sappy grin plastered itself on Jask’s face. “Hey, don't worry about it. I’m sure you’ll get laid like… an hour after Cas’ project ends. Maybe not even.” Jask pulled out a couple of red plastic cups and a handful of butter knives.
“Douchebags?” He leaned forward with an amused expression and eyed Dean. “I don’t think you’re allowed to call students douchebags, Winchester.”
“Fuck...” Cas pulled his fingers out and moved back so Dean could drop to his knees. His cock dripped onto Dean’s tongue before he nudged inside with a groan. “How the hell did I get so fucking lucky?”
“Yeah,” Adam laughed. “We also saw your boyfriend about kill the guy. How long have you guys been together?”
After sucking a mark on Cas’ hip, Dean finally fixed his sights on Cas’ leaking cock. He started with a swipe of his tongue, licking off the precome already dripping down his length and then grinned up at Cas through his eyelashes.
Cas followed him down, smiling to himself with every step. “You know, you’re going to make someone a fantastic husband someday, if you ever allow yourself to be one.”
“I thought you were kidding about feeding me your cock?” Cas opened anyway, sticking his tongue out to try and lick it before it actually passed his lips. He bit down, making a face and chewing slowly. “That’s appalling.”
Since that damn bad lip reading debacle, he had refrained from jacking off. He shouldn’t think of Cas while doing that, especially right now while they were blurring the line between romance and friendship nearly every day.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas hesitated, but moved his hand to pull his phone out of his pocket. A moment later, it disappeared again. “There, I sent you a text.”
When he came back down in his comfy sweats, Cas was waiting, looking just as nervous as Ares was feeling and he sat close, draping his legs over his lap. “Hi.”
“I was just gonna grab burgers from the diner. Do you want something different?” He slid on his shirt, flattening his damp hair but he wasn’t done, he grabbed another flannel and then tossed it on the bed to put on his jeans. Cas could tell they were clean, but the stains on them answered his question.
For the first time since this started, Cas was close to real, actual tears that weren’t from pride. He wrapped his arms around Dean and rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry, Dean. People can be… unbelievably cruel.”
face and continued on. “Why won’t you let us find new handlers?” Dean sat up straighter with a frown, but kept his mouth shut when she continued. “I get why you fired the old ones, I’m not talking about that, but why can’t we find new ones? We’re stretched thin, Dean.”
Those blue eyes are intensely focused on Dean, and he blushes as he keeps chewing the mouthful of food he’d just shoved in his face. He licks his lips when he swallows. “Mornin’, Angel. I decided I like that better than Thursday.” He grins cheekily and takes another bite as the guy actually squirms a little in his seat.
He kept the smug expression from his face and tucked his tongue ring between his teeth so it was visible. Cas eyed Jaskier with boredom and faint annoyance, but shrugged and stepped over to him. “I’m not as straight-laced as people think, I’m simply not a moron.”
Cas stuck his tongue out at him and turned to open the door. “I’m stronger than I look, you know.” He rolled his eyes at Dean’s expression and walked down toward the lobby. “There should be a breakfast buffet around here, somewhere. What’s your nose telling you? I get the feeling you could find food from down the street.”
Breakfast is a complete loss. Cas grimaces when he sees the state of the pan he had the eggs in. “That's going to be impossible to clean, I should just throw it out.” He shakes his head at himself and gestures toward the cupboard closest to Dean. “I suppose we’re having cereal for breakfast.”
A low growl rumbled through Cas as he nodded. “I haven’t been able to get them out of my head since the first time you touched my thighs.”
Cas stood a little straighter and stared ahead, taking a stance that would tell Dean the discussion was over as far as he was concerned.
“I made you a sandwich.” Dean smiled innocently and then went back to that diss he almost missed. “And my pranks were awesome. Remember the time I put chili powder in your boxers?” Dean started laughing. “He wasn’t standing so straight that day.”
Ares smiled, staring into his eyes as he leaned in to kiss his lips. “Good.” As early as this was for them, he believed Jask. “You’re all I need.”
“Yes, actually. You never sing like that for me, you’re usually a fool about it.” Cas pulled him in and kissed each corner of his mouth. “But I love you, and I loved
Cas turned his arm over so Dean could trace the other side. “A tattoo? You can get one. What would you get?”
The sun beams down into Dean’s eyes, making them look unbelievably green, and his freckles shine brighter than ever before. He looks down at the sand like he’s never actually seen such a thing, and kneels to run his fingers through it, watching it fall in awe. “Cas... touch it. It’s warm.”
Before Dean could respond, Hannah and her friend Inias walked in. They were deep in a conversation, so it was obvious they didn’t hear him… but Dean definitely did.
Dean scoffed, tired of all the questions already, but knowing damn well he was the one that called him. “It’s nice to be able to let one rip in my own living room and know my partner won’t look at me like I’m a barbarian. Instead, J turns it into a competition.”
He knocks on Dr. Montague’s closed door. It's unusual for it to be closed, but when a tall, long-haired man steps out looking sated — Cas thinks he has a pretty clear understanding of what he interrupted. He moves quickly to the side in an effort not to be noticed, then enters the room once he gets an okay.
“Nah, I got a cleaner. You haven’t met Missouri?” Cas shakes his head and Dean huffs. “I think I need to give you a tour. But you don’t gotta do anything for anyone else. You can tell them to fuck off and I won’t fire you.”
“Cas!” He called out, thrusting up with a grunt. Cas could feel him emptying inside of him and moaned, loving how full of
He nodded once, turning toward the door. “Understood, Sir. Please keep me informed as things progress. I’ll get my things when it is deemed appropriate and report to Mr. Charles’ house immediately.”
Dean gets quiet for a while, thinking about what that would look like. “I gotta like... hold his pocket and shit?”
Mrs. Tate is nowhere to be found when he walks in, so he assumes she's in bed and carefully makes his way to his own room — but disorientation and the lingering effects of too much whiskey have him gripping the wall for support halfway down the hallway.
She rubbed her shoulder and looked scared to death, like she’d gotten in way over her head and probably didn’t mean any harm at all. “Jail! I can’t go to
Cas was on the floor, typing away like a madman while laying on his belly, but that wasn’t what had Dean instantly hard in his dirty jeans. What had him hard were Cas’ pink lace panties.
“Few months. I heard of Absolution Row, but nothin’ more than the name. And some devil guy... or was it angel? I dunno. What’s wrong with A? Dude there beat and rape people? Cause it’s no different than D in my eyes if that’s the case.” Dean leans back, his mood souring all over again. What if getting transferred really
Cas finally ditched the damn suits and looked almost normal in jeans and a tight t-shirt, but not much could make those tatted, muscular arms less attention-grabbing. He leaned forward to turn the radio up a little louder and kept his fingers laced with Dean’s. “We need to head toward Washington, we’ll cross the border there.”
Eventually, exhaustion wins out over any sense of self-preservation and he gets a couple of hours of sleep before the breakfast alarm goes off.
The kiss ended way too damn soon, but P dropped his head to Dean’s shoulder and let out an unsteady breath, clenching the sides of Dean’s shirt.
Part of Cas thought that was a nice way for Dean to tell him it wasn’t his business, but just in case, Cas wanted to make something clear. “I want to hear it. I just… have a feeling once I do, it’ll be my turn to head to the weight room, and I truly didn’t want to burn breakfast.”
The bitchface his bodyguard pulled off was legendary. “You’re your own worst enemy. This is exactly why I tell you not to go into crowds like that.” He raised a single eyebrow and tilted his head, pinning Dean to the spot.
“I’m fine, I’ve been sleeping in the car mostly but we spent a few days somewhere safe and I actually slept in a bed. I eat when Dean eats, which… is about a hundred times a day.”
He wasn’t fucking ready. The second he logged onto his Twitter, he saw more backlash than he anticipated. There were even memes and parody videos made to humiliate him. “This is my fucking life, it isn’t some joke.” He frowned down at his phone. “The holy rollers are one thing; they believe I’m going to hell, and it isn’t my job to convince them I’m not. But this shit… making a joke about the hardest thing I ever did. Telling me to kill myself. This is evil, Cas.”
She gave him a sad look and shook her head. “That isn’t fair to him, being cooped up in a hotel. He’ll be fine at my house. I’ll send pictures.” She turned and walked towards the door, calling out for Havoc.
Dean placed a hand over Cas’ and exposed his neck. “He can’t sleep in our bed. I love the fat little guy, but he’s not allowed to get between us. You know how clingy I get in my sleep.”
“Me too.” Dean started playing with his hair. “I already don’t wanna sleep apart tomorrow. You’re the pillow I didn’t know I needed.”
By the time they pulled into the airport, he saw Cas standing there and actually got nervous. “C’mon Cole, you tell him.”
“Sorry. I can start bringing clothes inside there, I just didn’t think. You didn’t have to wake up, I know it’s early.” Dean walked around him and started pulling out his clothes. “You normally wake up this early?”
“I just wanna be alone. Is that too much to ask for? I have a lot of shit goin’ on. And you can say we weren’t dating all day, but fuck you, we were. Maybe not exclusively, but we were. You have a damn key, J.”
He strolled over, swirling the sucker along his tongue as he slid in the seat next to his gym teacher. “Where’d you get the good food from? That sure as hell isn’t cafeteria food.” He sucked the candy in his mouth and rolled it out with a pop, contemplating if he should take off his shades.
Dean chuckled and grabbed his phone and wallet, slipping them into his jeans. “Let’s go eat. But you’re eating with me.”
Ares hummed and let his eyes fluttered closed, a sated smile across his plump lips. “You’re too good for me.”
The next thing Dean knew, his chest was flat against the pool table at Cas was toying with the plug. He sucked in a breath and shoved it in deeper, splaying his fingers between Dean’s shoulder blades to hold him there. “You were awfully confident I’d fuck you then, hm?”
Winchester laughed low, not moving away which meant Cas landed damn close to him. “Yeah, I noticed you’re not the only one with rose colored eyeballs anymore,” he teased. “Better pink than soul-sucking grey.”
“Yes. I don’t think we’re allowed to have them where we live, but my father’s house is technically empty right now. We could go there?” Cas looked hesitant to let go of Dean’s hand, but did, then his eyes darted around the parking lot like he thought the Hatchetman himself was going to come out of the shadows.
“Can’t wait then.” Dean winked and made his way to the couch. “You know my username was AdorableBatman on that dating app?”
The noise Dean releases is nearly a gurgle as he rocks down, making Cas slide in deeper. “Yeah... fuck... fuck me, baby.” He huffs a breathless laugh, loving how Cas gets when he loses control.
She nodded, smiling a little at her plate. “I got a promotion, actually. Maybe I’ll be able to afford to send you both to college now.”
And then worse, thoughts of Jaskier Morningstar, the insufferable Dodgers pitcher that got to have everything Cas wanted but would ever admit out loud.
thing to do, but still. Poor little guy. We’re not even gonna get to see him with a cone on his head.” Dean frowned, then began driving toward the diner. “Gonna need a lot of pie.”
His thoughts drifted to homeschooling again. Not seeing Dean would hurt, but he began to think not seeing him at all would hurt less than seeing him every day.
“You got it, babe.” Jask slicked his fingers and warmed the lube, then sucked Ares cock into his mouth as he nudged a single digit inside of him. He pulled off after a moment and grinned as he curled his finger then added a second. “I think I’ll get you off
“That dickhead has saved my life multiple times... and my literal ass. Why don’t you like him?” Dean just couldn’t let it go. Cas was... well, Cas. But he wasn’t a bad guy.
pieces of furniture, albeit in very different ways. “I don’t really follow sports. Occasionally hockey, but even then, I don’t have a preference when it comes to teams. I just enjoy watching the games. I’d ask you who your team is, but… it would be disingenuous, since I don’t know anything about any of the teams.”
Apparently not enough leeway to point out how fucking stupid their latest plot line was, but hey. It didn’t stop him from telling anyone that would listen that Rex having a twin brother named Dex was not only cheesy, but stupidly overdone. “I just don’t get it. First of all, Ashton ain’t that dynamic of an actor. Second, twins? Seriously? Didn’t know life in Luna Vale could get anymore predictable, but here we are.”
Cas huffed a deep throaty laugh and reached down to start stroking himself, showing Dean just how good it felt. “Fuck... I’d cockwarm under the desk the entire class period, Dean.”
Cas pulled out until Dean’s ass was barely holding him in and snapped forward, smirking at the yelp that came out of Dean. “Of course I did, but I’m trying to keep you quiet, remember?”
he does. Things get a little hazy mid-turn, and when they stop moving, he droops forward and buries his face in Dean’s neck. He smells so damn intoxicating that he can't help but lick and suck on his scent gland.
Ares narrows his eyes at Jaskier, but turns back to Dean quickly. “In completely unrelated, not at all corresponding news, do you remember how I mentioned I met a grown man that didn't know how to work social media? Turns out all of the information on his Facebook was extremely outdated, isn't that funny? Poor guy doesn't even know how to log in anymore.”
When he finally pulled in, he spotted the outline of a car right about where Woody had said it would be. It was barely visible in the dark, which meant they would be, too.
Dean rolls his eyes and finishes his food just as a woman walks in the kitchen with a towel over her shoulder. “Hey, Missouri. This is Cas. Cas, this is Missouri.” He slides his plate at her with an annoying smirk and she shuffles over to slap him upside the head.
His gaze lingered for a moment longer, and then he barely looked Cas’ way at all for the rest of class. His movements were stiff though, and Cas could easily tell Dean was struggling with not talking to him, but it didn’t exactly make things a whole lot better.
Cas shivered, sliding up just far enough that when Dean came with a guttural growl, he actually got to taste it. He licked him clean and kissed all over the inside of his thighs, then finally made his way back out from under the blanket with messy hair and a smug expression. “Good morning.”
Pulling Dean’s gorgeous body flush with his own, Jask kissed him again. “I’ll find a way to make it up to you.”
“Kinda too gay. Just blame me, babe. It’s mostly my fault.” He thought about it. “Let’s send the gayest photo ever... I’ll finger gun and you thumbs up. No way they deny us anything, we’re literally the two most adorable people on the planet.”
Everything with Jask felt right. It wasn’t something Ares knew how to explain, but it made him want to always be around him, no matter what they were doing. Now that all bets were off, they were having the best sex of his life, and as much as he enjoyed that, it was also so much more. Even when they were apart, Ares was always thinking of him.
Still reeling from the stretch of the plug, Cas held tight to the back of the seat as he lowered himself down. It felt incredible, and Cas let out a long, steady grumble as his body opened up for Dean.
He plants his feet and thrusts up harder, using one hand to keep Dean steady as the other speeds up. Cas breaks the kiss to watch with his bottom lip between his teeth.
“Wow what??” Dean groans in annoyance and tugs at his hair. “Fuck... tell me something or I’ll fuck your sister.”
Henriksen brings his messy hand to Dean’s ass and shoves his fingers in, pushing Dean’s come inside his body. “Now if only you behaved this well outside of this room, we wouldn't be here.” The rest of Dean’s spend ends up on his cock and he nudges in, groaning at the tight squeeze. “Ahh, fuck. You always got that game face on, but I knew there was a little slut hidden somewhere under all that flannel.”
Dean leaned forward until only the smalls of their backs were touching and all humor drained from his voice. “Yeah, course. You don’t have to answer. But I think that means you gotta ask two.”
“Tell me what?” Dean’s grin only broke Cas’ heart even more, and he contemplated not telling him at all. Ever.
“I mighta seen you a couple times.” Dean leans back to see him with a huge grin. “I thought it was adorable. I couldn’t stop lookin’ at you either, and then when I walked outside the patios light hit your eyes just right... I was a goner.”
Cas had been in his classes long enough to know that this was just what Ketch did. He’d attack something from every angle until he found a crack in logic, a faltering point in belief. He’d claimed at the start of their very first lesson that it was because if one’s beliefs couldn’t stand up to scrutiny, they were little more than hopes. Cas opened his mouth to rebut, but visions of Jask and Ares started swimming through his mind.
“What’s that mean?” Dean’s eyes widened as he remembered he had a new pie in the kitchen, and he wandered off, forgetting that Cole was talking.
He tossed and turned in the bed, unable to shake the feeling that if he didn’t let his guard down before then, he might push Dean away.
Cas stopped his hips and turned towards the noise of the intruder’s footsteps. “Police business! Walk away, civilian.” It came out as more of an angry growl, because he
Jask paused. “That’s the thing. I don’t know anymore. I’m technically still with Dean, but I want you, but I have to go see Dean. It’s confusing, and I’m fucking scared I’m going to do something wrong. I don’t even know what, exactly… I just always screw shit up.”
Cas rode him like his life depended on it, bouncing so eagerly his head was practically hitting the roof. He tried to angle his cock to come all over himself, but made a mess of them both. Ares didn’t mind, he brought some up to his mouth to taste and groaned. “Gods, your ass is so tight, Cas.” He ran his hands up Cas’ thighs and leaned in for a messy, breathless kiss.
Dean,” he admits breathlessly, twisting his hand and pinning Dean a little closer to the counter. “I never stopped.”
He shook his head at the dumb way he asked. He should have been a damn adult and said frottage, but Dean never did adult well.
“Yes, I think their bios are in the email.” Cas huffed and pulled up their email account, then hovered over the message. After a quick, silent pep talk, he sat down next to Ares and finally opened it. It went through a list of their general personality traits and then was broken down by pairing. Ares was paired with someone named Dean, and one look at the picture left Cas breathless. For as attractive as he found Ares, he had
Reconciling the fact that Dean and Woody were the same person was strange, but oddly, he wasn’t surprised if he really thought about it. The humor, silliness and innate sex appeal he’d attributed to Woody also fit what he’d come to know of Dean.
“I know, baby. I’m all yours. They can wait.” Dean dropped down with the little space Cas left and he nuzzled his crotch. “How do you want me, Cas?”
“Go to bed, dickhead.” Cole’s face at the nickname had Dean laughing out loud. “Aww... baby needs a nap.” He walked up and ruffled his hair.
Dean had canceled everything for a couple weeks, but after hearing nothing from Cas, he had to get back out there. Alistair lasted all of one day before Dean fired his ass. Maybe he couldn’t override the Cas situation, but Sonny caved and found someone new. His new bodyguard, Henry, was alright, but anyone was better than that long-faced creep. Helped that he was easy on the eyes — not that Dean would ever make that mistake again.
Jagger chuckled softly. “I don’t make the rules, I’m just here to enforce them.” He stepped forward slowly, bearing most of his weight on a cane, and handed Jimmy a stack of folders. “You start here. The doors to the bank won’t open again until you’ve found your killer… and taken him, or her, out.” He raised his eyebrows suggestively and backed up again, heading for the only exit to the room they were in.
“I did, actually. Better than I have in a long time, I think.” He takes a slow sip of his coffee and glances back up at Dean, and those blue eyes are clearer than he's ever seen them. “And I assure you, I’m sober. Ben caught me early last night.”
Cas licks his lips with an amused expression, then heads over to the sink. A moment later, he's tossing a cup full of water on Dean’s crotch. “There.”
Cas pointedly didn’t watch Dean walk away, he wasn’t sure he was prepared to get a look at Dean’s ass quite yet. It was all he could do to stay standing as-is, to stay professional, to
“Do you want me to not work today? Is a sore ass a reason to call in sick? Because I’m so sore it’s nearly making me hard again.” Ares honestly couldn’t remember what day it was in that moment, but he didn’t really care. The world could wait.
“Yeah...” He felt stupid just saying ‘yeah’ so he cleared his throat. “I uh... yeah. Really liked... that.”
beg to differ,” Jask says with wide eyes. He nudges Ares. “Ar, tell them we gotta watch as part of Cas’ therapy or some shit.”
The Trickster comes up between them and wraps his arms over their shoulders. “Ohh, you don't wanna hear that. Sounds like a buncha cats tryna claw an old lady to death. However, if you're lookin’ for a way to occupy his mouth…” He points up above their heads to a cluster of mistletoe that definitely wasn't there two minutes ago.
“He...” Jack has the same face he had when he watched television for the first time. “He died on a hunt, Castiel... Do you want to see it?”
“You roped those asshats into this, too? I bet J will be dressed up with his hair all ridiculous.” Dean chuckles and motions for her to come on. “Will there be food?”
Jask fumbled immediately with his pants, unzipping quickly and not wasting a single moment as he pulled his cock free and ran it over Ares’ bottom lip. “Gonna suck me off, baby? I’ve fucking dreamed about this, about that tongue.”
“Morningstar! Do your stretches or run a lap. I shouldn’t hear your voice more than my own.” Dean went back to stretching and talking about its importance to the few students actually listening. His job was fairly easy, there was minimal teaching that needed to be done, and the kids normally just needed to burn a little energy. The hardest part was getting any of them to take it seriously.
“Yes,” Cas pounced, there was no other word for it. He slammed their lips together for the first time, backing Dean against the door. He could feel the moment his hesitation subsided when he gripped Cas’ hips and deepened the kiss. The moan he released was pathetic, but he didn’t care. Dean was the hottest man to ever walk the Earth and
Once again, can we give a huge round of applause to Blucifer? Seeing the art for this was incredible and I'm so, so grateful.
Dean pulls away first and rests their heads together, smiling with his eyes still closed. “I can’t believe you’re real. I’m so sorry I left, Cas.”
The bedrooms were all gorgeous with huge tapestries and four-poster beds, and after dropping off his luggage in the largest room, he decided to brave the stone stairs and see what was hidden underground before it got too dark outside. He walked slowly, refusing to acknowledge the rapid beating of his heart or the way the hair on the back of his neck stood on end as he hit the ground.
His heart thumped uncomfortably in his chest as he looked at the ground and tried to envision how the hell two grown men were going to get close enough to frot without giving too much of themselves away, but Cas was slowly realizing that learning Woody’s true identity wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.
“No, beans are fine,” Cas says a little breathlessly. “Just… carry on. Don't let this ruin your picnic.” He turns his head to glare at Dean and grips the edge of the table as he rolls his hips and grinds down, making Dean drop his chip and grip his hips with a groan.
A soft chuckle sent an additional buzz through his cock before Cas pulled off and licked his lips. “Okay. We can go get breakfast now.”
“If it will make you laugh, absolutely.” Cas flipped on the lights when they got inside and his eyes widened a little. Of all the rooms in Dean’s house, this was one of the only two he’d never been in. He noted a pool table toward the back with a framed poster of a black classic car behind it and a full bar off to the side. Cas wondered why the hell Dean didn’t spend every waking hour in there. “Who’s car?”
While they're cleaning up, Cas catches Dean’s gaze and jerks his head toward the hallway. The moment Dean follows and they round the corner out of sight, Cas pushes him against the wall and kisses him hard.
Jask gripped the frame of the door and kept his eyes glued to Ares’ hand. “Tease yourself. Go faster until your back arches, then slow to almost a stop. Lick the precome off your finger, and do it again.”
It took a full twenty minutes for Pegasus to text back, and when he did, Dean was scared to look at the damn thing.
“Not in the slightest. Just never see you jokin’ around with the other kids. Jack is your friend, right?”
When Cas pulls back, his shirt and bare thighs are covered in come, and he's got that gorgeous smile plastered on his face. “You taste exactly as good as I hoped you would.” He leans back in to bury his face there, licking Dean’s balls and softening cock.
“I’m not one to complain. They feed me three meals and every Friday I get to choose a cupcake or a cookie.” He shrugged. “Could be worse.”
Ares holds up a hand. “I'm going to tattoo HIPAA on both of your foreheads. And Charades or not, I can't tell you anything that he told me in confidence. I shouldn't have even let it slip that he's a patient, but... I just can't believe it. I mean, I had my suspicions, but... wow.”
Winchester was gay, that was mostly hopefulness, but he could see the affect he had on the guy and the
Abaddon had her arms draped over Jimmy’s shoulders and huffed a laugh. “Oh, we’ll have fun. Not as much fun as you, though. I’m jealous you get to go to school in your underwear.”
“Mmmm.” Cas bobbed his head, letting the candy balls stretch out his cheeks with every pass. Dean could see Cas was equally as hard, but wasn’t making a single damn move to touch himself… he wanted to put on a show.
"Yes." Ares groaned and gripped the counter. "Every time... he's so strong, Cas. He can pick me up pretty damn easily and when he pins me... I can't fucking move. Gods, it's amazing."
“That sucks. I work Sunday and Monday, but I’m off Tuesday.” Ares pulled up his fresh panties and laid down with Jask, sliding into his arms like he belonged there.
Dean feels a little nauseated when they land, and then he wonders why the hell he’s nauseous, holding his stomach with one hand. “Why do I feel sick? Do humans even have bodily fluids when they’re dead?”
Ares climbed up his body and kissed him, straddling his lap and rutting their cocks together. He kissed down his neck and bit down softly. “Let me ride you.”
“Ares. Seriously? I’m not gonna do that. I won’t even try right away. He— Ares, he’s it for me. Have I ever talked about anyone this way?”
Dean normally would respond with something snarky, but the dick walked away before he could come up with something clever.
“Yeah.” He sits with Cas to eat, his eyes flickering between his plate and those blue oceans. “You ever get food not from here for yourself? Like a burger?”
with his vows. “I love you. And you don’t give yourself enough credit, sweetheart. You are better with words than even me sometimes.” He smiled and cleared his throat. “I wanted to start by saying thank you. Thank you for believing in me when I didn’t anymore, for fighting for us and showing me there was still something to fight for. Our flame will
“Yeah, I agree. And I didn’t mean anything bad by it. I think it’s obvious I’m gay, so me calling them gay wasn’t an insult.” Cas gathered his things and approached his desk. “I learn something everyday,
and light erupts around Gad. He screams, his back arching until he falls to the ground, and all Dean can see through the smoke is an imprint of angel wings surrounding him.
She toasted and drank, then leaned up to kiss his cheek a second before a photographer snapped a picture. As if it wasn’t bad enough they were at these parties to begin with. “I’m sorry, Dean. Do you think it’s going to be awkward with you guys now?”
Dean had chosen a black suit with a deep burgundy shirt and smiled when he saw Cas’ matching tie. He glanced around quickly to make sure they were alone and grabbed it, pulling him in to kiss him. “Hey, it’s like we’re doin’ the whole ‘anon’ thing all over again. I kinda like it.”
He knew they had to be careful not to wake Ashton up, and his spine was prickling with the need to stay professional so he’d be ready if needed to protect his new charge, but then Dean bit his neck and Ashton became the last thing on his mind. “Can you stay quiet for me, Dean? As much as I enjoyed hearing you last time, it got us in trouble.”
As if he cared about a single aspect of his life other than Dean anyway, and if something ever happened to him… well, Cas didn’t like to think about that.
“Everyone sit down.” Sonny paused as everyone sat around the table. “This is a sticky situation, and I hate to do this… but Castiel, you have to be reassigned.” Cas stared as though Sonny was speaking another language. “It happens buddy, sometimes we get too close.”
“Yeah but not anyone that isn’t close to me. I never even told Jask it existed. Jo is the only person besides my bodyguards that knows.”
“I dunno. I mean, he acts like he can’t breathe around me sometimes, and others he won’t even look me in the eye. I think he feels guilty for wanting me, but he doesn't have to. I mean, they both signed up for this too, and J is probably fucking his boyfriend already.”
He nods, staring at the carpet. “Yes, his name was... well, I don't suppose it matters. We just... weren't a good fit.”
“Nah... I’ve always been crazy. Man, I miss my car. Used to talk to her more than other people.” He starts wrenching with a smile, wondering if she's in an impound lot somewhere or already auctioned off. He's honestly not sure which would be worse.
Cas made sure to constantly hit Dean’s prostate and his work paid off when it had Dean coming a second time before Cas was even close to finishing. He continued fucking into him and Dean moaned so loudly someone walked around the corner to check on them.
“I don't know anything about A. If you're in trouble in there, put a note under the flowerpot in the shed outside. You are too pretty to die in here.” He lets him go, backing up slowly as the gate lock clicks open. “Take care, Weenchester.”
“Is it because of the ironclad ships? It helped usher in a new era for our gayest military branch. You know, the
Azrian grins as he grabs a stack of trays. “Definitely gay. Always have been. I thought going to prison wouldn't be all that bad, but—” his smile fades — “well, you said yourself you know.”
The angle is so deep that Cas isn't doing much but pinning Dean’s hips down and grinding into him, but his gorgeous body is coated with sweat. “Dean… I'm… I'm close, tell me I can — fuck, I want to fill your ass up so fucking bad.” He slams in, pulling nearly all the way out before repeating the motion and lifting Dean’s leg up to his shoulder.
“Aw, dammit. She said Ares.” Dean slid his phone in his pocket and tapped on the back of the couch. “I called. You get to email.”
Dean jumps out and walks to the door, pausing to wait for Cas. The second he reaches him, he pulls him in and kisses him. “Just makin’ up for lost time. I’ve wanted to do this stuff for a long time... never could shake you, Cas.”
helped turn the tide of that war, and if they wouldn’t have, the world might look a lot different today. They fought for two days, up against an enemy they had no real way of stopping. When that battle started, the Union was on their own, with no ship in their fleet capable of taking on an ironclad. You ever hear the story of the Cumberland? The CSS Virginia plowed into the side of it with a battering ram, leaving a
“Whoa,” Jask whispers, holding up his hands in mock defense — or, maybe very real defense. “D, think about this before you go.” Dean doesn't listen, he pushes past him and keeps walking, and Jask jogs to keep up as they cross the street with no regard to traffic. “Damnit, Dean.”
Ares closed his eyes tightly and released a shaky breath. He wanted to be under Jask shaking with need.
“Dunno. Guess we’ll see soon, I’m all signed up.” He set the phone aside and searched for some clothes.
While his hand twisted and tugged, Jask sucked on the side of his throat. Ares knew those marks wouldn’t go away anytime soon, which meant Cas would see them in a couple of days — and Jask didn’t seem to care. He was doing it on purpose; marking him on purpose.
"Who? Are you having a date? Why do I have to come?" Cas looked down at his Lord of the Rings pajama pants and didn't particularly want to change.
The question catches him off guard. “Um… Well, they can be a lot of things depending on what their sub needs.” He thinks about going into detail but shuts up, fearing that Dean would be
Not knowing was infuriating, but Dean hardly had the time to dwell. They were coming up on a season finale, so work was stressful. To make it worse, Cas didn’t come with Ashton again to the set.
He pulled it out and the sight made his own cock twitch. “Been holdin’ out on me, Cas.” Dean slid him inside his mouth with a groan, showing Cas his skills and dripping at the sound of Cas’ moan.
Dean was moaning and staring at Cas like he was the greatest thing on earth. “God you’re so fucking beautiful.”
Dean yanked Cas back up so he could reach him, not hesitating to follow through and work the plug out of Cas’ ass. He gripped his own cock then, kissing Cas again quickly. “Side table, there’s lube.”
The fox tilts his head and asks him why, and it startles Cas — he's been holed up in the prison so long that he’s forgotten he can speak to animals.
“That’s impossible, Mr. Novak. No one can tell you how or when to move on. One day you’ll wake up and you’ll just...
“You’re a fuckin asshole. Fuck me harder... Sir.” Dean closes his eyes, focusing on the assault to his prostate and his cock his Victor’s hand.
A shudder ran down his spine and Jask flopped back on the bed, pushing his shorts down and spreading his legs. “I’m all yours, D. Do whatever the hell you want with me.”
“If you've got a crush on him, Jim… now would be the time to say it. You've been teasing him an awful lot.”
“Yeah, I worked that out. But it's still true, wanna see?” Dean pulls out his phone and pulls up Facebook messenger. “I should be embarrassed by this, but I’m not. I had no clue you didn’t know how to use friggin Facebook. Here.” He leans in when he clicks on Cas’ thread and scrolls up to the same year he moved away, right when all contact with Cas ended.
“Always. From the first day of school.” Dean leaned in to kiss him, pulling their bodies together in the small space. “Always.”
impression of you was much better. I thought you were kind, and funny, and someone that could be counted on. I still think all of those things today.”
Dean purses his lips in a pout, pretending to think about it. “How about a blowey in the laundry room, and I want... pack a cigs?
He rucked up Dean’s shirt, his hands desperately searching for heated skin as his lips on Dean’s neck got more insistent. Cas’ slacks were tight pressing against his growing length, and it was that alone that made Cas stop. He dropped his forehead to Dean’s shoulder and took a shuddering breath, sliding his hands lower to Dean’s ass. “If someone walks out here... we can’t. They’ll see you.”
The hopefulness in Dean’s voice broke Cas’ heart in all the best ways. He nodded, dropping his hand down to grasp Dean’s. “Yes, you are. And no matter what happens… I’m yours, in whatever capacity you’ll have me. Bodyguard or otherwise.”
“Depends,” Dean said simply. “You gonna suck me off as payment? It’s been a hot minute, and I gotta say... sometimes I spend
“I didn’t know it needed to be some big thing. I figured Jimmy would have told everyone and I happened to be talking to Gabe about it a couple weeks back, but I thought you knew. I’m homeschooling next year.” Cas rolled his eyes at the disappointed look on Nick’s face. “What? We can still hang out all the time. Don’t cry, marshmallow.” He teased, knowing that would get Nick to say something snarky back.
Cas shook his head quickly and reached out like he was going to grab Dean’s hand again, but dropped it at the last second. “Don’t apologize. You’re just… incredibly attractive. It’s making it hard to focus.”
it's already started. “C’mon, big guy, don’t let me down and go easy.” He reaches down and grips his slowly chubbing cock as Butcher shoves in a third finger.
"Well, he looks like an ass, close enough." Dean started hammering again and laughed at Sam's bitch face. "What?" He tossed the hammer aside, knowing damn well Sam was going to say whatever he thought regardless.
I trust them with my life.” They walked towards the set slowly and Dean turned to jog over to Benny. “Look... sorry about that. Hire who you need, okay?”
“Ares isn’t the only one. I don’t want it to sound like I’m blaming him, because I’m not.” He knew his brother probably didn’t want to hear about the things he craved in bed, so he didn’t elaborate further. “We swore we wouldn’t stray from each other. I’m worried that if something
Jask chuckled as he took another bite, chewing slowly and then sitting back in his seat with his head cocked to the side. “Oh, I’ve got some ideas.”
He turns to go to wash up, walking down the long hallway of family photos, and every photo of Cas makes his stomach flip.
Relieved it was a legitimate question, Dean pushed off from his desk and moved to the front of the room. “I wouldn’t say repressive. They’re reenactments, not revisions. For a lot of people, the Civil War is ingrained in their histories. Brother fought against brother, father against son. Some say the reenactments keep the horror of war fresh in our minds and prevent us from repeating the same mistakes. It’s a celebration of victory. If you ask me, there are better ways to spend a Sunday afternoon, but hey.”
Jask shuddered, letting out a soft moan. “I didn’t, wouldn’t dream of it.” He set Ares down and tipped his chin up, kissing him gently. “I’d get the cuffs, but… I wanna feel your hands on me this time.”
“Then I’m confident we’ll come out of this better than how we went in.” With a soft smile, Cas gently dislodged Ares and sat forward to sign them up. “Whatever that may mean for us, I know we’ll be just as strong.” He leaned over to kiss him briefly then filled out the application, chuckling to himself. “It says we’re not supposed to talk to each other, other than one meet-up day right in the middle… but it also says we’re supposed to be paired with people that have opposite personalities from us. I’m definitely lamenting the fact that we can’t laugh at each other through this.”
“Man... I can’t even remember. You’re too fucking good at that.” They laid back together with dopey grins and Dean looked over. “Who was I? The dude you were ‘securing’?”
a war zone, huh?” He briefly tells him about his dad’s experience in the military, but the topic threatens to derail his mood again so he moves on quickly. “I didn’t see you singing, Angel. I wanna hear it.”
“Keep talking like that, and I’ll feed you whatever you want,” Cas whispered, but immediately looked guilty. “Go on. Sit. It’s time to eat… rabbit food or not.”
“Why do you assume girlfriend? Could be a boyfriend.” Cas glanced at Dean again and sighed. “Probably just wishful thinking. He probably is straight.”
“You’re never in the mood,” he argued as he pressed a button on Dean’s treadmill to accelerate the speed.
“Hmm, maybe we should disappear to the bathroom for a little bit, then.” Cas was joking and Dean knew it, but dammit if that didn’t give him all
Dean smiled and sat back comfortably, his arm going behind Cas’ back as he searched for the news. “Do I smell better now?”
Dean’s laughing harder than Cas has ever heard him when he reaches the car. His cheeks are flushed as he catches his breath. “Did you see that?”
“Fuck.” Ares once again complied, moaning at the flavor and stroking more feverishly the second time. “Jask... fuck, I want you. Let me see it.”
Cas raced up the stairs and into his bedroom, closing the door to his personal bathroom behind him. He sucked in a breath, hiking up his apron and stuffing the fabric into his mouth to muffle the sounds he knew he was going to be making. He shoved his boxers down with one hand, tucking the waistband under his balls and gripped his cock with the other.
He settled down, closing his eyes, and finally relaxed a little now that Dean was safe… until his own bedroom door opened.
left, I shut down. Threw myself into work and taking care of my father, didn't speak with my friends, insisted I was fine when I wasn't. It took quite a bit to break that cycle.”
Cas lets out a full-body laugh and shakes his head, then fishes out his phone so they can exchange numbers. A full ten minutes and
Cas leans in to whisper in her ear, “No one remembers you. We had to show a flashback just to remind people… and it still didn't work. I've stalked him for longer than you've been alive, and I don't even remember seeing your face before. I watched you kill him the first time and you
Dean huffs a laugh. “That eyebrow is hot. I’d do whatever he says too... if y’know what I mean.” He takes a bite, trying not to feel too at ease here because he knows how quickly things can turn in prison, but it's hard not to relax.
order over easy... didn’t I, J?” Dean chuckles as his bodyguard shakes his head at him and gives Cas an almost apologetic smile. “Alright, now it’s the taste test. You gonna stand here and watch? Should I put on a show?” He winks at Cas and takes a bite of bacon with the side of his teeth, and the site has Castiel’s fists clenching at his sides.
Getting that huge mass inside of him was harder than he thought it would be, and it took an agonizingly long time to adjust to its girth enough to actually bottom out. He gasped, his thighs burning and knees cramping.
“Nah. Picked sophomore cause that’s the grade Madbay kids learn about American history, age didn’t really play into it. It's not like it matters, anyway. Sixteen, eighteen… it’s all legal. Just luck of the draw, I guess.” Dean licked his lip and nodded to Jask. “Your office open if I freak out?”
Dean can tell by the tone of his voice that his words aren't as unrelated as he's trying to claim, and he instantly pulls out his phone to pull up his Facebook. It takes him a solid two minutes to realize that Cas obviously won’t respond to this message either, but it isn’t because he doesn’t want to talk to him. He just isn’t on Facebook.
“Oh.” Cas flushed and picked his glass up, shaking his head. “No, why would we? He’s been one of my best friends since high school. What we have... works.”
“You just buttered my insides, baby.” Dean jokes, leaning in to flick his tongue across Cas’ lips and then sits up. “But yeah, I’m starvin’.”
he’s doing today, and he wants Cas to just hang with him. He could give him the day off and hang with Jask, but if he’s being honest... he misses the guy. He can’t help it.
“I thought my attitude would keep you away.” Dean kissed him again, letting out a breath. “I’m glad I failed.”
“You’re going to kill me, aren’t you? Death by teasing... or is it death by arousal? In any case, I’ll jack off in the shower like I normally do.”
Dean made them both a fresh drink and took her hand to lead her outside. Once the coast was clear, they cuddled close and he took a deep breath. “I fucked my bodyguard and then broke things off with J. And I don't understand why I felt the need to do that, Cas doesn’t want... all that comes with me.”
“I missed him, too.” Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s cock, neglecting his own on purpose and pulled Dean into a kiss that sent heat coursing through his body. He stroked slowly, his grip tight and thumb swiping over the tip. “Haven’t even had this car for a day and we’re already going to christen it.”
Cas didn’t have a normal bad dream. He may be acting like this just happened sometimes, but this dream was about
the monster, I won’t kill you. I will, however, expect monster sex… which is yet another sentence I never thought I’d utter. I’ll give the book that much.”
Since Dean already had Cas up on the counter, Jask didn’t see the need to say goodbye. They’d likely see each other in a few days, anyway. He scooped Ares up and darted toward the back door, not stopping until they were back in their own house and kicking their shoes off. “See? Don't know why we bother. We shouldn’t have agreed to socialize with other people until like year five.”
“As a delicious dick? Yes actually. I’ll put it on your headstone,” he teased, tossing his head back with a laugh.
“Mmhmm. You just love making my toes curl.” Cas looked down at his desk and nodded toward it. “I came on your keyboard.”
“Yes. Why, are you tempted?” Ares stopped what he was doing and faced him. “What do you want to do?”
Cas moved slightly, wishing he could hold Dean in his arms. “Thank you. I... know you didn’t want to take me for granted, Dean. I know things changed, but I know you never meant to hurt me... And I never meant to hurt you, but me just leaving? That hurt you. And I’m sorry.”
The moment Dean steps inside, Cas’ hands are on him, tugging at his belt and unraveling any last shred of rational thought he might've been capable of. Cas drops to his knees and looks up at him with eyes a little too clear for someone that's supposed to be drunk enough to merit arresting himself, but that thought flies away too when his cock springs free and Castiel’s attention shifts southward.
Takeoff wasn’t terrible. Dean hated flying, so he was tense and even more agitated than he already had been — but they made it into the air in one piece, which was all Cas could really ask for. He, on the other hand, loved flying. He’d given serious consideration to the Air Force before ultimately becoming a Marine, but this was one part of the job he never minded.
All the tension in Cas’ body ebbed away and he smirked to himself, partially at how adorable Dean was, but also because he knew he made the right choice by not messing around with Jaskier. “Of course I’m happy to see you, Dean. I’m sorry, it’s been a rough couple of days. I was worried about you.”
It wasn’t that Cas didn’t want to be a bodyguard anymore, it was the fact that his heart was breaking every single day that Dean had to hide. Every day he had to put on that picture-perfect persona in the public and compensate by being a brat in private. There was no happy medium, and despite how much Dean had previously seemed to love it, it seemed he had reached the end of his rope. Cas saw an out… had seen an out for both of them. Maybe away from the limelight, away from the fame, Cas could finally tell Dean that he didn’t have to spend his life searching for someone that loved him for him… because that person was right in front of him.
Thursday looks genuinely shocked for a moment. “Dean, you can't — that line has a slope now, it defeats the whole purp—” He blinks as he sees the look of amusement on Dean’s face, then smiles in spite of himself. “Cute.”
“Yeah well... you know those child actors. They live in a different world, Novak. They don’t know what the real world is like. You do a good job keeping him in line. I think I have too much fun with the guy, personally, but don’t tell Sonny.”
Those two things don't seem to go together, but Cas has an absolute one-track mind at the moment. His breath catches in his throat as he steps up behind Dean and runs his hands over that smooth, beautiful skin. “Are you prepped? I have… nothing with me.”
This was originally supposed to be a glory hole one shot, then it was supposed to be my DCBB fic but I decided to go with something else for that and you guys got this one early. Hope you guys enjoyed the filthy fluff.
Even without the downpour, that measly lighter’s flame would’ve been no match for the inferno between them, and Dean desperately reached for the buttons on Cas’ uniform. “Off. Fuck, I need you.”
Dean looked over with a grin. “Ha! I knew you fell for him too!” For some reason, knowing that made him feel better. “I know he misses Daddy Cas, too. He loves you.”
Cas folded his hands behind his back and glanced toward the door. “We could go for a run, if you’d like.”
Cas nodded seriously, despite the flips his stomach was doing as Dean got closer. “Yes. Those two are not mutually exclusive. You drive me up the wall, and yet...” He raised one shoulder, stopping himself from gushing about love instead of lust.
“Why wasn’t I notified?” Cas’ tone was immediately all business and tension. “How long did it take? Has she been detained? How did she manage to get so close to the house in the first place?”
Dean made a weird little noise somewhere between a grunt and a whine as his back arched. “Love you too, Cas. But c’mon, I know this ain’t what you wanna hear but I’m sensitive as hell right now. Speed it up.”
Ares choked on his beer, covering his mouth with his elbow. “Damn you.” He wiped up his chin and chuckled. “This is your house, jack off where you want. Just not in the kitchen.”
Dean opted to call instead of text, and maybe he should have texted first, because she didn’t answer. He wasn’t worried though, she was probably just enjoying her coffee with her—
Ultimately, he draped himself in flags of heaven and the blood of demons and all manner of other things… but
Ares felt it was a good opportunity to watch his new ‘boyfriend’. The sounds of sports on the television actually brought a smile to his face. He never really cared for them, but they brought back nostalgia and he loved watching people watch them. The excitement on their faces, replaced by frustration and fear, all in a matter of seconds. It was more entertaining than any organized sports game itself.
“Y yo a ti, Cas.” Dean pulls his bottom lip between his teeth and grins, and for a moment, Cas can't do anything but marvel at how lucky he is.
“Meg,” he starts, preparing to argue — but one look at the mess around him makes him take a sip and shut up. If she leaves, he'll have to
Jask looked at him curiously as he pulled out a shot glass. “I meant less than an hour, not that you wouldn’t make it. No way you’d let Cas down. Not a chance.” He set the butter knives in a line with a couple of inches between each one, then dropped the shot glass in the middle. “Flip cup, but better. Each time you flip it, you move the shot closer to me. I flip it right, I move it back toward you. Loser drinks. Figured we should do some husband shit since the wives are probably arguing over Rosetta Stone editions or charting stars.”
Jask hummed, walking away from the music that was blaring in the background. “Hell yeah, you just tell me when. You know I miss that ass, it’s the best I’ve ever had.”
All Dean gave him in return were the mumbled words and a sleepy thumbs up at an awkward angle, then dropped his head to the mattress and huffed. “Christ.”
“Hi.” He looked drained as usual and immediately started stripping off his scrubs. “I’m in desperate need of a shower but you look so damn comfy right now.” Ares walked over to kiss him and then hurried off to their shower.
Jask set Havoc down and flopped down on the bed, patting the space next to him. “I’m wearing makeup, how do you
“Well,” Bobby starts, “it’ll take a Christmas miracle for that boy to believe ya anyway. He's gonna need proof, hard proof, if you want him to buy what you're sellin’. He's never believed anything off faith alone, it's one of the things that makes him such a damned good hunter. Damn shame he got locked up for some false accusations… there's a lotta people sufferin’ cause he ain't out there killin’ the things that go bump.”
not hitting on. And why does anyone do anything around here? I was paid to.” Ash stares at the cards in his hand, and his face gives away how shitty it is. “And no, I'm not telling you who did it. I'm pretty sure they didn't get what they wanted out of it.”
Jask looked at him like he might toss a beer at his head and deadpanned, “Hilarious, Dean. Really.” He took a drink and then finally smiled. “Things are... going. Have you seen his eyes?”
The next few days are lonely — even more lonely than before. There’s someone in the cell across from him now, and honestly, he’s Dean’s last hope for human interaction. The guards here don’t speak more than two words to him and it’s really started to weigh. “Hey... pssst. Please tell me you know English.”
“Go away, asshat. I was having a good dream.” Dean pulled the blanket up but huffed a laugh at J’s scoff.
He nodded, assuming as much. “She didn’t, and I didn’t either. The decision has to come from you, Cas. I never wanted you to think I was pushing you one way or the other. It’s a big thing.”
Cas offers him an equally cheeky smile. “Since the two of you effectively left those kids to die last time, I took the liberty of already extracting them. They're safe, but the… mimes aren't happy. Shall we?” He gestures toward the barn door and draws his angel blade.
“Not… everything,” Cas says quietly. “Here’s me being honest… I know you're a hunter. A real hunter, and not of animals.”
The thought that grown men could still be so… primitive was actually annoying to Cas, but the thought of Dean defending himself and his brother was decidedly not. “I’ve never been in a fight, but… that’s not surprising. I doubt many people think of me as a threat.”
“Of course.” Dean kissed his hand and told him to just pull off right there so they could switch. Wanted Dead or Alive came on the radio, so Dean put it up and sang to Cas. “There’s your lullaby, baby. Sleep good.”
The damn sexual tension with Cas had only escalated over the past few weeks. Dean even found himself not wanting to text Jask back. He didn’t know why, but he had a feeling he just wasn’t what Dean wanted anymore. Jody was over, letting him know the upcoming schedule.
“Are you still pissed at him for being interested in Cas?” Sam crossed his arms, looking condescending as hell like he already knew the answer.
“Shh,” he says softly. “Don't apologize, Dean. You were helping your brother... I never blamed you. Not for a moment.” He kisses the tip of his nose and continues over his freckled cheeks. "It just... took us a little longer than I thought to find our way back, that's all."
They ended up completely entwined in each other’s arms with almost no desire to ever leave. Jask dozed off once, but woke with a smile on his face when he saw Ares. “You have to work today? Or is today Tuesday… I kinda lost count.”
Dean laughed, popping the hood and leaning in to take a look. “You could say that, but don’t get all geeky over it. None of them quite live up to the Sam Winchester legacy.”
“Probably... but we can definitely make a movie about this and people would think we’re crazy.” Ares chuckled and melted into him. “But I just don’t care. I’d rather be crazy with you than sane with anyone else.”
Ares frowned when he heard the phone being tossed around and then suddenly a very different voice spoke on the other end. “Ares? Hi. This is Dean. Is... can I talk to Cas?”
Once they called it a night, they sat on his hardwood floor in their matching pajamas and ate Chinese food. “At least the food is good.”
“Please do. Both of those things.” Cas didn’t wait and leaned in to kiss him, opening his lips to let him in. It was the best thing that had happened all day, and before he knew it he was pulling on Dean’s hair, begging for more.
“Jesu— fuck!” Cas’ head practically rolled as he bounced harder and harder. He was leaking all over Dean’s gorgeous abs and he couldn’t wait to come mark every inch that he could.
He drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly, like tension from the last few years was leaving him. “We still have a long way to go, Dean… but we’ve made it this far. We’ll make it the rest of the way, and then you
“Metal. Rusty… metal. That's… are you pranking me? Because your… biological sire already did that, and it wasn't amusing then, either.” He snaps his head to the left as he hears the far-off rumble of the Impala.
be jizzing in his pants at this age. He can’t. All he can think about is how amazing it felt when it happened, and how it feels just as good right now as they come down together.
to be in his arms, I always thought there was something wrong with me and my inability to enjoy cuddles.”
But maybe he should have. Maybe he should have called or knocked... hell, anything, because what he walked in on had his jaw hitting the floor.
“Morning, Sleeping Beauty.” Cole was already in his suit, looking like he’d gotten a full night’s sleep when he probably hadn’t gotten any at all. “Made you some coffee, you’re gonna need it...
“Yeah, what were you really sayin’?” Dean squeezed his hand with a grin. “I know you lied about the first one.”
“I know... and I love it. But, he has you wrapped around his little paw, so we’ll see.” He brought his lips to Dean’s neck and then rested his chin on his shoulder. “He’s kinda cute.”
First period was a drag, and he raced so quickly to second period that he knocked at least two people over. He managed to make it before anyone else, and for twenty, glorious seconds, Dean was kissing him. “Fuck, I love you,” Dean whispered. “Go sit, before I get us both arrested for public indecency.”
“People like that don’t want a human, they want a robot. You are not responsible for living up to other people’s expectations of you, you’re responsible for living up to your own. Do you think you’ve done that by coming out? Are you being true to yourself?”
“Fuck, baby.” Dean leaned forward and nipped his ass. “You’re so fucking gorgeous.” Cas heard the lube cap pop open and then Dean’s thick digit nudged at his hole. “I’ve wanted you for so fucking long.”
“Um… cherry, then… will be fine.” Cas was sure he wasn’t breathing, knew he needed air in his lungs to continue surviving, but his brain just wouldn’t send the command. Being so close to Dean was overwhelming in every positive way, and if Cas hadn’t been frozen solid, he’d have melted right into him.
Cas’ final shift wasn't as bad as he expected, but he got caught up finishing paperwork and then had to attend that party. The second Castiel’s phone died, he began to panic. He was late as it was, and if he missed Dean, all of this could go wrong. He picked that restaurant on purpose, feeling like it was a good place to destroy those damned papers once in for all. Calling Dean there to sign divorce papers was one of Cas’ biggest mistakes, only bested by leaving Dean to begin with.
When Dean gripped Cas’ hair and came with a shaky moan, Cas pulled off with a smirk as Dean carefully got to his knees, scooting back in the tub and running his hand over the surface of the water to clear the bubbles. Cas was hard as a rock, and to his surprise, Dean sucked in a breath and dove under, licking a line up his shaft.
“Uh... yeah. Why? You meet him or somethin’?” Dean asks, picturing that blue eyed boy he met in a bar so long ago.
Cas’ eyes water but he smiles, taking Dean’s hand and kissing it. “That's a conversation that will make you late for work, so… I'll just say thank you. And I'll never get tired of you, so don't even think it.”
“You're so good, Dean, so good for me,” he mumbles, digging around in the drawer next to them. He pulls out a small bottle of lotion and coats his cock, then does the same with his hand. It's cold as hell as Cas wraps his huge hand around Dean’s length, but the gasp he lets out is covered quickly by a moan as Cas’ other hand digs into his side and he slides fully between his thighs. “Oh, Dean,” Cas whispers, licking up the column of his neck and locking eyes with him in the mirror as he starts to stroke and thrust opposite each other.
He nodded. “Most of the time, yes. The only time I don’t, really, is when I think you might see me. But usually in bed, or just laying around the house, I’m wearing a pair under my clothes.”
“Yeah... probably. I just hate the fame now, Jo. People are ugly and I saw their true colors. I don’t want any part of that. I saw who my real friends were, though, and Ashton really surprised me. He helped Cas get me outta there.”
“Uhm... 2077.” Cas flushed from the compliment and let his eyes rove over Dean’s naked body. “How long were you... cursed?”
“Okay.” Dean started singing to Cas, doing anything to see that beautiful smile. “I feel free, Cas. Like... I know I’m not; I’m literally on the run, and I’ve never felt more free.”
Cas would be lying to himself if he said he wasn’t nervous about this part, but he knew it needed to happen. “I wanted to inform you that I’ve begun a relationship with a fellow staff member.”
Thank you for reading and for loving my boys Jask and Ares as much as I do. I have some Jares fics I’m tossing around in my head, so this won’t be the last you see of their POV’s. 😉
Jask nodded. “Yeah, it works for me. You’re the best human I’ve ever met, D. And you make me feel fucking phenomenal. What about that wouldn’t work for me?”
He chose to ignore the question about Dean, and nodded. “Of course I’ll speak to them. The sooner we get you out of here, the better. Have you... have you spoken to Jimmy?”
“Hmm. Unfortunately, you know those dreams never let me have you like this,” Cas said as he spread the lube over his cock and lined up. “That's not to say my imagination didn't work overtime, though.”
All he received in response was a shrug that sent powdered sugar cascading down to Dean’s shirt, and Cas fought laugh as Dean walked away to get cleaned up. He knew he needed a shower and some food, but while Dean was occupied he might as well get the phone call over with.
The rest of the day was a sea of gray. School was fucking boring, and before he saw his hot history teacher, he was seriously considering dropping out. He hated everything about it, especially the homework. Learning had never been hard for Cas, he could read something one time and remember it easily. He didn’t need all this extra bullshit.
Cas grinned, keeping his hand right where it was as he looked out at the road. “I thought home might be nice. It’s been a while for me.”
Ares moaned, letting Jask do anything he wanted to him before wiggling his ass, silently begging for more.
Part of Jask wanted to say no and bottom for him again, just to remind Dean that no matter how good that blue eyed guy was, Jask would always be better… but he absolutely wasn’t strong enough to deny Dean when he looked so unbelievably good straddling him. Jask nodded quickly, tugging on Dean’s hair and kissing him roughly as he thrust up. “Hell yeah, I do. Get the lube.”
Dean growled and flipped Cas around, pinning him against the hood and sucking yet another mark on his neck as he slotted himself between Cas’ legs.
Though Cas’ first instinct was to throw their ground rules completely out the window, he understood that the point was to strengthen their relationship, not throw it down the toilet for a couple of men that would likely use them and throw them away if given the chance. “We don’t… touch, right?”
“But I love it... especially when I get to spank you for it.” Dean bit his lip and pulled Cas in for a kiss. “My brat.”
Dean gallic shrugged and pressed play. “It’s fine, you didn’t owe me an explanation.” He polished off his drink and set the glass on the side table. “Shoulda known better than to believe him.”
He sniggered softly and smiled at his screen, his thumbs dancing over the keys as he figured out the most polite way to say ‘not a chance’.
“You know me, I got my four hours.” He smiles as encouragingly as he can, but she doesn’t fall for it.
“Aw man, you gonna torture me? I can’t eat vegetables in the morning because they make me grouchy.” Dean grinned cheekily and took another bite.
“Cas...” Dean doesn’t have the strength to say no, he’s squirming just from the thought of it and the evidence of how badly he needs it is bulging out of his slacks. It’s been so long — too long — since he’s been touched that he grabs the keys and unlocks the cell before he can even process the motions.
Lee nudges him and they start singing along together, and one of the other inmates yells about Zepp not being Christmas music — but half the rest of them pounce on the guy before Dean has to. He laughs again, then sits around the tree with everyone else as they open their presents. He's itching to get to that pool table, but it can wait — he's got a present of his own to give Cas.
The next thing he knew, he was being tackled onto his living room carpet. Dean laughed loudly as Jask’s giant body pinned him down, but Dean was a lot stronger than he looked and managed to flip him over. “Damn, Jask. How’d you know I like it rough?”
Dean didn’t seem to be able to help himself, he leaned forward and sucked the tip of Cas’ cock into his mouth to clean him up, not wasting any of it. When he pulled back, his tongue laved over his chin, and he smiled satedly from his spot on the floor. “I love you, Cas.”
“Probably.” He took a deep breath and looked around at all the people that worked so hard to be here.
It helped that Jask was so goddamn gorgeous, too. The game kept him animated, even as he sat still, and it took a lot for Ares to finally force away his gaze.
Outside, the prison yard looks exactly like he thought it would. A basketball court, a few picnic tables, and a shitload of concrete and metal. The sun beats down directly in his face and he shields his eyes to try and see out past the fence and how far he'd have to run to reach freedom — he already knows he won't make it in this place a full ten years.
Cas came tearing out of his room just as Abaddon walked out the door, laughing at his outburst. Cas had his phone in his hand as his face was paler than Dean had ever seen it. “Dean?”
Ares nodded a little. “He looks amazing. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him out of those flannels, I didn’t know he was capable of dressing up like this. Are you nervous at all?”
“Boy, I told you to put the damn dishes in the sink. I help you clean, I’m not your maid.” She shakes her head at Dean and holds a hand out to Cas. “It’s nice to meet you, honey.”
