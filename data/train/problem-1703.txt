gone according to plan. John decides to emphasize this point to Greg the next time he sees the senior surgeon.
John extends his hand and Sherlock takes it. The walk takes them a good forty minutes since they take their time enjoying the quiet streets; the term has just ended and most of those navigating the streets are tourists returning to hotels.
"Ever since George, — his father — fell ill with cancer, Sherlock has been privy to all his health information for practical reasons. Erroneously, Sherlock assumed the same would apply to mine. I recently had an operation for quite a harmless issue, and some copies of my records were sent home. I wouldn't let him read the letter."
"Electrocautery carries a larger risk of damage to surrounding tissues." Sherlock is dismayed that he hadn't been a part of that conversation with Collings, and wouldn’t have condoned such a choice.
"Don't make people into heroes, John. They don't exist and even if they did, I wouldn't be one of them."
Sherlock remembers Pichler's words about John needing to say these things for his own process, but they don't make Sherlock feel any better. "That doesn't change the fact that whenever you need support, I can't deliver."
"I'll ring out department head, see if we can get the approval. I'll say he declined GA, so we have to go for the next best option."
"No need to thank me. I was doing my job." Sherlock is tempted to apologise once more, but it has become obvious that nothing could sway Zezelj's opinion that he had done what he had promised, and the incident he had carried such guilt and shame for, while still a mistake, was seen by the patient as a price he was willing to pay for a chance at life after so many surgeons had turned him down.
"I refuse to rely on waiting for someone to come give us a watered-down summary. You know how to interpret all this." He nods towards the screen.
When the nurse responds with nothing but an uneasy silence, Sherlock bites out, "Visiting hours?" He assumes they are the same as on Saturday. Already in his suit, he's ready to leave the flat at a moment's notice once this is confirmed.
"Do you remember where you are?" you ask Sherlock, who's going a bit cross-eyed examining all the wires attached to him.
cut corners, lower his standards or deliver subpar care, not even when going through personal crises. Maybe someone will think he was at fault for not lingering to speak with Mr Fairholme, who I might add did not show up at the hospital for another six hours — long after his wife had died. But they don't see the big picture. Sherlock's part in her admission and assessment was done once he informed the neurologists of his decision and that day, because he's as human as the rest of us, he wanted to get home when his workday ended. Lord knows he has stayed late and even returned to the hospital every damned time someone has asked for his expertise or an extra pair of hands, regardless of whether he's been on duty or not."
He doesn’t feel calm. He feels… unsure what to do. Painfully self-aware. Out of his depth, even though a hospital is a very familiar environment for him. “Who else should I inform?”
No, she hadn't called to ask him a favour, but doing so might put him at ease. It would be predictable from his standpoint, give him the chance to bicker a bit in that familiar manner between them. A bit of innocent obfuscation feels like a small price for Violet to pay for the joy of hearing his voice and, perhaps, a bit more obfuscation is needed to keep hearing it in the future. As much as Sherlock values honesty and truthfulness, keeping certain truths to herself is something she
"Former or active addicts," Mycroft provides helpfully. "It's quite alright to be frank with him, Doctor Marsh. Lord knows he never spares anyone's blushes."
There's John's criminal record, showing only a drunk and disorderly from his university days. No DUI charges or convictions.
She continues, pushes on despite her unease. "I never wanted him to find out; we decided it was for the best. Why make a deal out of something that was never… that wasn't even…"
"No need to dredge up any of those things, now. I promise you it is nothing current. Just… old things," Sherlock says and sighs.
"Nothing worrying, dear," Violet says and stuffs the envelope into the front pocket of her apron. "Just some lady things. All benign."
The dealer shrugs, shoves his hands in his pockets, mulling over the idea. Then, he complies and Sherlock slips him the cash. The man lights his cigarette then digs out one for himself, shifting close to an air vent. "Warmer ‘ere."
The hours tick by and there are no phone calls. At noon, Sherlock re-establishes that Booze-up is a brilliant service. Originally, he’d only meant to indulge in that single delivery on Friday, but John has not been discharged yet and Sherlock is pacing like a caged panther. So what if he smokes one more cigarette? Or five? Or one more packet? If it helps him be more himself, more collected when he goes back to the Princess Royal, then those smokes will have benefited everyone.
Suddenly, time has run out. John looks in the opposite direction, down the street, then his gaze scans around. He sees.
"They don't have air bladders, so they rely on fin movement to propel themselves around, and to wash their gills with fresh oxygenated water. Some of them have other mechanisms of ensuring constant water flow into their gills, such as a pumping motion with their pharynx, and those species can rest on the sea bottom."
Sherlock downs the pill with a glass of water, gulping it down like a man dying in the desert, then throws up again. Half of a second one he manages to keep in with the sedative. He can't have eaten anything after that Cornetto, but John knows better than to suggest food. Sherlock has been running on fumes for hours, now, so John is not surprised that eventually, the pill knocks him nearly legless. John half-carries him into bed and spoons him from behind. Finally, they both find some temporary rest.
All John knows is that Sherlock lives in a two-bedroom flat on Morrell Avenue. He hadn't given John the specific address, just said he'd meet him at the train station. When the 10:42 from London had been delayed for forty minutes at Reading because of what the train driver had announced as an
John understands what this means. "No diving, then. I'm sorry, Sherlock." Without hypo symptoms Sherlock is aware of, even regular scuba diving is impossible.
John laughs. "Don't judge. Who knows, maybe this place is a hothouse of international human trafficking or something."
He can't even call his brother, unless he fancies a lecture on compromising his hideout. As loathe as Sherlock is to praise the man ever, Mycroft Holmes is very good at what he does, which is playing chess with people as pawns in the intelligence circles.
A woman standing off to the side, clutching the arm of a man beside her, dissolves into sobs. They must have been introduced, and since Sherlock must have deleted their identities, they must be inconsequential.
During the drive back to London, Violet takes care of conversation. As usual, she manages to cover a smattering of village gossip, Mycroft's career triumphs, and pointless things George has been doing in the garden. Sherlock listens with barely half an ear; bubbles of anxiety float to the surface with each spire and tower of London that becomes visible on the horizon.
Why is the PA here? Sherlock hadn't requested any assistance with transport home. Has John cooked up some plan to surprise him?
And John gives it just that. Planting his palms on both sides of Sherlock's hips, he lets the shaft sink past his lips into the warm slickness of his mouth, his palate caressing the sensitive tip.
"Studying is what university should be for, not for wasting time with social nonsense," Sherlock readily agrees. "I was disappointed to see how many medical students did not seem very interested in medicine."
"They're right about that, yeah. For some reason, this guy wanted to talk to Sherlock because he treated some patient at A&E. I don't have any more details than that."
that she's got an open cranial fracture, thank you!" he snaps, his tone tight and higher pitched than usual. He's vibrating a painful sort of nervous energy.
Sherlock steps away from the plexiglass. "I'm going to go make that case list and deliver it to Fiona."
"About what you said last night," John says, leaning on the bedroom doorframe with his hands in the bathrobe pockets. "I can never get you to unwind right after call, but it's just… What you said last night sounded like stuff you've been thinking about for some time. Is it something you've been processing with Pichler?"
how they're going to perish. If they go down, they go down together in battle. John would sure as hell not stick around as some has-been war hero widower and he doubts Sherlock would, either. They're Rangers, which means they live in the here-and-now, and they would never leave the other behind to save themselves.
"A couple hundred killings in the UK every year from domestic violence," Bethany says grimly. "My sis volunteers for a helpline. There's always the next one of these just waiting to happen.
"Barring complications," you point out. If standard-issue reassurances are all that Cowie can offer, then you don't want anything more from him. If there are no guarantees, then you'll just have to wait and see.
"He's ambulatory, capable of remembering to take his pain medications and taking in enough fluids. He's well enough to go socialise tomorrow and will go back to work on Monday. He doesn't need me. I can't do anything for him."
Sherlock huffs. Yes, she has told him this in many versions. Violet has, too. But it's hard to accept after the entire world has telegraphed at him for decades that not much can be expected from him in terms of interpersonal relationship skills.
"There are lots of surgical videos online. Maybe we could watch one of those valve operations; I could explain the different stages and you can see for yourself. Reality tends to be a lot less weird and graphic than what people imagine," you offer.
They leave the bathroom and turn in opposite directions. John decides not to ask whether Sherlock wants dinner — he can't have eaten anything in hours. He takes out the Styrofoam container from the fridge and spoons some of it onto a plate, which he sticks in the microwave while Sherlock hangs up his suit in the bedroom wardrobe and changes to a pyjama and his dressing gown.
The thought fills Sherlock with dread. Will John notice his rumpled clothes, his still dishevelled hair — all the obvious forensic evidence that he's been with someone tonight? Will John deduce that tonight, he'd tried to be as reckless, as uncaring as before, but had to admit he's never been good at separating himself from his feelings. If he'd only had time to shower, to make himself presentable… now, he feels as though there's a scarlet letter branded on his chest even though he's never accepted such premises as shame or sin when it comes to sex.
"I detest your tone and your use of the plural form. You sound as though you think you're supposed to manage
He huffs. John Watson owes him nothing, but he doesn't deserve to be kicked to the kerb like this, does he?
"Marriage is not an exchange of favours or something in which you must match in skill. In a good marriage, you complement each other, make each other better. John once told me he feels privileged to look after you, and that he's never felt like that in a relationship before. But he also made the point many times that it's not about the sort of looking after a parent does. He has always made that very clear that he doesn't see himself in that role."
Holmes is studying him, a hint of amusement in his expression. "And this couldn't wait until Monday's office hours? Tell me,
He realises the shower is still on; he had only just put the timer on when Sherlock had headed into the bathroom. He'd got a text, disappeared into the bedroom and then announced he needed a shower. He does often take this long since his curls are, quote, '
Joanna had done a good job in framing the suggestion in a way that did not signal that John was not up to the task of looking after his husband; she said that circumstances beyond both their controls had made London problematic because the place was so intimately interwoven with Sherlock's career. John shared with her that he thought that Sherlock isolating himself in the flat was making things worse.
"I assume you know what I mean when I say that deciding never to operate again is a bigger decision than it would be to leave medicine altogether."
Sherlock drags himself back under the covers and accepts an invitation to lie on his back with John's arm under his neck.
Sherlock continues. "As I stated earlier, countless patients face the same situation every year in this country, but their family members don't do what Mr Fairholme did. Not even when the death of a patient is found out to have resulted from medical negligence."
You could tell him the IEDs you saw in Kandahar never emitted any kind of ticking, but he wouldn't want to be corrected, now. Why had he told you he got used to the sound? Why had he lied? You're getting whiplash from his mood swings, from his constant denial-flirting-with-crisis way of dealing with what's happened.
Just after he has extracted the tissue sample, the door opens and John walks in wearing scrubs, a mask and a hat. Sherlock frowns.
In Sherlock's experience, people are more likely to cling to things and places after a death in the family than to abandon them. Sometimes, people even execute a strange mix of the two — Mycroft never really visiting their childhood home, but turning it into some hideous boutique hotel instead of selling it is a case in point.
"No," Sherlock says, and it's not just for the offer of continuing what they were doing that is still being pressed against his arse cheeks.
"John said that you don't think I should have called you in. That I incriminated myself by doing so."
"Don't I know it. I guess that's something that comes from home. His Mum was sort of… over-dedicated but very judgmental."
"Maybe he could have some pearls of wisdom for you in bouncing back from a mistake," Lestrade smirks, then laughs when Sherlock rolls his eyes.
, John reminds himself. He has thought many times that Roger Fairholme could just as well latched on to something else than the surgeon who he thinks cruelly denied her wife surgery just for the sake of his own convenience.
complaints and litigatory action. But even more importantly, the question of honesty  connects to what sort of a doctor one wants to be: someone who values protecting themselves over what happens to their patients or someone who wants to uphold people's trust in our profession by being trustworthy and honest?
The doors slide open again, revealing the unsurprising sight of Sherlock since John is perfectly aware his husband is on call, too, as backup for a neurosurgical registrar. When a relatively inexperienced, still-in-training neurosurgeon is taking call, the senior needs to stay in house to attend to complex A&E cases since he'll have to accompany the reg into theatre or take over managing the case. It appears he's left the registrar behind somewhere.
Greir, who has just been briefed by a liaison officer, still knows very little about what is currently going on inside. To May and John's relief, she does have the information that Nurse Joe Pilkington, the gunshot victim, has been transported to Guy's since standard procedure dictates that the King's A&E is to stop accepting new patients until the building is secure. John knows that the longer transport may mean a worse prognosis, but he doesn't say this out loud. At least Joe had been alive when the emergency team had reached him.
In fact, he becomes a regular visitor to the clinic, and after two months, John has to admit to himself that he looks forward to these visits more than he does his surgeries. He loves medicine, but the excitement and drama he had left behind in Afghanistan — and misses more than he's wanted to confess — are there in Holmes' cases more than they are in the current direction of his surgical career. Though brutal, the details Sherlock consults John about are beautiful mysteries of flesh and bone, of ripped tendons and torn blood vessels. The ones where there is a deadline are the best; they make John feel an inkling of the same pressure that had pushed him to do his best work as an army surgeon.
John starts walking again, and Sherlock hurries after him. They've reached the edge of the Bay of Noup, a vast sandy beach far below. They'll have to reach the tide-licked rocks on the open north side of the bay to get to the ancient site comprising a broch — hollow-walled drystone roundhouse — and a suspected burial mound. There is a famous one on Westray called the Knowe O'Skea but water level has been so high that it's been impossible to access from mainland. That's what John had told him, pointing him to this less known site, instead.
John's consultation phone begins bleeting, and he raises his brows at his husband. "See? It's the curse of the Q word."
, not the other way around. Maybe you could remind me of this conversation when you feel like that, hm? Just say
means that foundation could never be solid. He knows better now. Trusts it. Trusts John and himself. "What I thought of even more than medicine were the consequences to us. The way you'd look at me if I failed like that."
is a generous description. You make it sound as though it's in any condition for human habitation. I assure you that it's not."
Mycroft takes a seat opposite. "Thankfully, Hammersmith has joined the twenty-first century and their operating rooms employ a centralised, completely computerised system which collects data from patient monitors and infuser pumps, plus the team can input data by hand on the progress of surgery and anaesthesia."
"Just a bit of tidying up, loose ends, you know how it is," Sherlock explains. He looks a bit flushed.
Thom Ojerinde is a recent recruit to King's, a fifty-something Nigerian-borne surgeon who'd done all his schooling in the UK. John hasn't had a chance to work with him yet in theatre, but he must be likeable if even Sherlock has adopted the practice of using the man's nickname.
Sherlock sighs. "It's the worst for me when I think you have expectations I can't fulfil, and they mostly involve me becoming less... me."
"I don't think about it often anymore. George never wants to discuss it. You know how it was with men in those days. Everything related to women's health made them uneasy. But I would never let him claim it wasn't a decision we made together," Violet explains. She's aware of not sounding all that coherent — how does one discuss something for which the right words have never existed?
"You need to cut in next to the spine; if you cut open the belly first as usual, you'll ruin cod meat. It's just a muddy mess inside instead of stuff being organised very neatly like in many other species," John rattles off in a tone that signals he truly assumes Sherlock is familiar with all this.
When Sherlock recognises his husband, he feels the lurch of a few extra heartbeats brought on by sheer relief.
"Then you know what I mean, and you're cleverer with all this stuff than you give yourself credit for," John declares proudly before sobering up.
"Yes, mother, I am well aware," he says with an eye roll. "And I don't think it automatically means that they don't want a partner at all." He's hardly interested in educating his old-fashioned mother about such things.
"Whatever I wear needs to be good enough that… that John will notice. But not so that I would stand out. Though standing out in a favourable manner visually might be a good idea, yet it draws more attention and––" he trails out, frowning.
"Good job. Have we got enough sedation meds for transport to CT?" John glances at the patient monitors.
," Sherlock protests, but there's not much force behind it. He has tucked his legs underneath him on the sofa while Violet sits with her feet primly on the floor and a decorative pillow on her lap.
Upon arrival at the Met, John is once again stonewalled by the staff. He is told that interviews are ongoing, but they can't say how long the process will take. There will also be forensic examinations, at which John huffs. "They're not the ones who did this!" He understands the need, but subjecting Sherlock to god-knows-what is…
happen between them, if Sherlock gets a say. He's had a taste of a different kind of life, now, and that life cannot be recreated without John Watson. It's still such a difficult thought to accept that John would want him, would want him
"I should do a spot of cleaning before you're discharged," Mrs Hudson fusses; "with a dressed-up wound and a new valve, you wouldn't want to risk getting an infection. I should clean the fridge in particular," she says pointedly, casting you a conspiratorial glance.
"We have to tell them what happened," Sherlock insists again. He has a sense of his words falling on deaf ears.
"He had endocarditis in 2008. No significant valve defect developed then, and we were told that the antibiotics cleared it all up, but there was something they wanted to monitor via echocardiography once a year. I'm sure he never attended any of those appointments. His self-care and life management in those days was… non-existent."
"How astute of you." He crosses his arms. He is most decidedly not a prude, but discussing this is… he can't even find the right words to describe the exquisite mortification. It's not helping his nerves about Sandhurst that there seems to be a possibility that John anticipates having some fun at the expense of his alleged military fetish.
John rummages around the paper bags for a couple of small raspberry muffins and wedges of brioche toast topped with avocado and smoked salmon. They should go well with tea.
At three o'clock, the registrar calls to say that John will need to spend a third night in the hospital; Collings thinks it's best to err on the side of caution, and the afternoon's lab work hasn't come back yet. Sherlock had not even been informed that such things had been ordered. Underneath the platitudes he is offered, Sherlock is able to detect that the unit is understaffed, over-stretched, and a discharge is just one more hassle they don't want to deal with.
Sherlock will be furious if he does this. He'll be furious because John will have gone over his head, will have patronised him by not trusting his words that he'll be fine once he's in the OR and starts operating. But John cannot ignore what Sherlock's words had signalled: that he wasn't alright, that he
"No, I know you don't, but you should. You should tell him what you told me. He was there, and he can tell you which part of it was real, and what stuff is logical for you to remember and what might be…" you trail out, not wanting to feed into his anxiety.
His eyes flash with surprised dismay. "What do you mean, 'safe'? I don't need protection from him. As I just said, we are not headed to a war zone."
Joanna doesn't push for further conversation, just thanks him for the music. "I'll be in touch," she says, to which Sherlock replies nothing.
him, but when they did, he was left with a sense of shame and failure so profound and overwhelming that he couldn't endure it. So he left himself behind.
in this chapter featuring several callbacks to earlier stories in the series. Here are some references explained, certain elaborations as well as medical terms explained.
Once he's out of earshot, John asks, "Why do you think I saw Pichler?" He knows he's busted, but he'd like to know how.
or think they need that appointment? But perhaps John hadn’t explained properly why such a check-up would be a good idea. He wouldn't want the patient to complain later about being managed negligently.
Discouraged and angry, though he doesn't quite know who the irritation is directed at, Sherlock leaves. He hopes he hasn't betrayed just how much the visit has unsettled him. Probably not, since John is focusing on his own pain at the moment.
Sherlock pulls John closer with the arm he has draped around the man's waist from behind, buries his nose in John's neck hair. It's a very particular, heady scent which fills his awareness: the sea, a mixture of sweat and masculinity, but also something unnamed he might call the essence of John. The beard burns on Sherlock's lips and chin itch, but he doesn't want to extricate his hands. The other one is underneath John's neck and the pillow, starting to develop pins and needles. His cock has gone soft: it is spent and sensitive, still, from the hands, lips and tongue it has endured gladly tonight. The feeling of it resting against John's bare bottom is exquisite; all Sherlock would need to do to reawaken fully his still simmering arousal is to shift a bit, seek that friction that had culminated not an hour ago in an orgasm that had swept through his consciousness like a whiteout in a blizzard.
. Come along now, we've only got ten minutes until the opening. I'm sure you still have to tune and all."
"Yes, they are. Knife," Sherlock requests, and a scalpel is placed onto his expectant, double-gloved palm. He slides out the blade — this is a new model with a plastic safety cap — and makes a quick, neat incision in the patient's shaved scalp. He is passed a pair of bipolar bayonet cautery forceps, which he uses to stem the seeping blood flow from small blood vessels in the incision. The scalp is well vascularised and thus bleeds a lot.
, save for the fact that the modus operandi includes something as unsavoury as sexually motivated homicide. Someone is picking up men from bars, going home with them and, in the process of a tryst, killing them. London has seen murders with certain similarities before, the most notable example of internalised homophobia channelled into serial homicide by Colin Ireland, dubbed "
"Believe me when I tell you it spares you of much grief, not knowing what it feels like to watch your child go through something like that. All I ever wanted was to keep you safe, to spare you from how difficult I knew your life would be. But you didn't want that — didn't want easy and safe. I just… I worry so tremendously about you, still, though I try not to."
The move back to the Cardiac Care Unit is a relief. Though his ECG, oxygen saturation and blood pressure will still be monitored continuously, the HDU unit should feel more like a regular ward than the ICU did. Sherlock gets a proper single room, there is a much more normal daily routine and less ambient noise. Though released from the drains and the wires for a temporary pacemaker which was kept on standby, there are still various lines and monitoring wires which prevent Sherlock from moving about freely and leaving the room. Not that he would — even just sitting on the edge of the bed or in a chair by it drains his reserves. He doesn't ask for help so that he could do those things, and you assume it's both because he hates needing the help and because such evidence of his current infirmity decimates his already dejected mood.
You manage to convince him to let you remove his stitches and staples the next morning. You doubt he's slept any — he looks like death warmed over. He insists on sitting by the kitchen tableinstead of lying on the sofa. You have not forgot his reaction to seeing his incision for the first time, and how nauseous he got when the drains were removed, but he'll not be swayed.
Odd, how this is an outcome Sherlock had never anticipated. He'd assumed that, to talk to John, he'd have to go back to Scotland. John doesn't look like an outsider here — he looks like any Londoner waiting for his… what?
Sherlock gives you an unimpressed but not exactly angry glance. Both of you know that he probably knows more about central nervous system pharmacology than you — and you're the bloody doctor here.
"I don't like this," Sherlock says, and surprises himself. "Small talk. Not having an agenda for a phone call. I don't know what you expect of me."
After being prompted several times to lie back down and relax, he finally settles down onto the bed with your help. As the CCU nurses begin hanging up fluids, programming infusers and adjusting wires, towering over him, you see him squeeze his eyes shut, his breathing now shallow and rapid.
And the level in the small bony hole he's looking in through is rising steadily. It's pulsing and bright.
"I don't know about that." Certainly John seems to have gone through some sort of process with his sexual identity within the time Sherlock has known him, but he is confident that John fearing homophobic comments isn't the key cause of all this anxiety. He worries about what people will think about John's choice in partner because of what he is like; his gender is a marginal part of that concern in comparison to him now knowing how to function around other people.
This seems to give Sherlock pause. A tendency for using avoidance and denial as a coping mechanism might well be behind him not attending his follow-up appointments after the endocarditis, and maybe he started using again. Still, Mrs Hudson has a point — often, people know what they're supposed to do in terms of their health and what's for the best, but they just don't want it and fight against it in irrational ways. Such as trying to go MIA from a cardiology ward with a heart rate of nearly two hundred.
Sherlock has barely even sat down in the chair opposite John before he starts firing off questions and shoving photographs onto John's desk.
"Oh." It does all make sense, and Collings has been thorough, and Sherlock knows he should find all this reassuring, but the niggling doubt does not let go. It's swirling together with all his other anxieties, now, and instead of facts he wants someone to tell him everything will be alright. It takes all his mental reserves to keep his calm.
John counts seconds while he has to finish chewing. "I don't mean we have to do anything tonight. I was just… thinking of you."
Or… could it be that they have both ignored their own principles by not resisting this inexplicable pull? It's not just of the physical kind, their companionship: Sherlock has never been able to tolerate people who just want his corporeal form, not his mind. He can tell the difference, even if he cannot boast very good skills in reading people otherwise.
Had it been just a dream, it would have been alarming. A memory is what it really is — one he'd pushed away, ruled as inconsequential and logical and understandable and unimportant. John hadn't been himself in that hotel room in Islamabad when he'd woken up suddenly without recognising where he was and who Sherlock was, and it had only happened once. Sherlock has never dreamt of this, at least he can't recall such a nightmare.
Every morning, as he wakes up in this repurposed loft flat in the fanciest part of Notting Hill, he wonders what the hell had possessed him to decide to rent such a thing. He recalls, of course, what he'd been thinking about in that moment: it had been a fit of celebration for his new career on the day he'd received his first billing slip from the private hospital and decided that upgrading his living arrangements was the appropriate thing to do in his new life. The sum on that slip was about five times what he'd made as a consultant in the NHS, and he'd never have to take call again. Then again, he'd be expected to be available by phone 24/7 for the rest of his life for patients and footie managers and ice hockey coaches. Though many colleagues wouldn't agree to such a commitment, John couldn't help but feel a mixture of embarrassment and disbelief at the number. He has truly made it in his career in terms of finances, so why did that fact not make him swell with pride and joy? Why did it not make him feel like he belonged?
The landlady cocks her head towards the stairs. "The door's probably unlocked. If it's not, you best turn on your heels and return later instead of knocking. Oh, the racket he's been making all day! Must be on one of his cases that's not going well."
"I like it here," John says, gazing over the moonlit sea. "I was more in the mood for cheap and cheerful than a jacket-and-tie affair, anyway, if I'm honest. Maybe we plan trips too meticulously; it was nice just to act a bit spontaneous this time."
"Not necessarily after such a delay as we see here between her death and the crimes he committed," Halloran says, twirling a pen between her fingers. "It was the Coroner's Inquest results which seem to have triggered his decision, not her loss per se." She puts the pen down and addresses Sherlock. "This is why defence will be going after you,
"Worried enough to suggest taking a leave of absence," Sherlock says, and his tone should signal to John where he thinks Lestrade should shove that suggestion.
Laura Arthur is one of King’s College’s consultant traumatologists. We got to know her in “Scar Tissue”; she was the one who condemned Sherlock to a halo vest for months to fix a cervical fracture.
Next comes a listing of the three panel members — a layman member, a physician member and a legally qualified chair  as well as the names of the GMC representative and Vandersteen as Sherlock's solicitor. Sherlock is mentioned as having been present and represented.
. Sherlock had become familiar with several forms of Turkish folk music during a most tedious assignment from Mycroft in Istanbul. Instead of tailing some small-time spy, Sherlock had immersed himself in the city just as he cultivates his love affair with London. The achingly wistful violin in the background makes him miss his own instrument.
“I’ve stocked the fridge and freezer at home,” he says. Well, he had done the ice cream bit and turfed the rest to Edgar.
He puts away the decorative pillow he'd picked up. The usual nervousness and sense of being put on the spot which has always characterised his visits to the therapist has fused with a pervasive blandness that confounds him. He doesn't feel motivated to engage with her — or anyone.
All in all, this one has been an afternoon much like most Sundays in their household, save for one thing: the atmosphere is all wrong.
Industrial metal pounds like a heartbeat in the narrow corridor as they make their way back to the main floor. Sherlock straightens his form and sniffs as he follows Christian to the cloak room, the cocaine already taking effect and accelerating his decision-making.
"Doesn't get more local than that," John confirms, "third wild salmon I've caught this month, which is unusual. More often you get those farmed ones that have escaped their pens."
did," Sherlock insists. "And it changed all our plans, and I didn't have time to do the research to verify Collings' plan and in fact, I…”
You raise your brows, pursing your lips to signal your colleague to continue. Usually, when discussing such things with other surgeons, you'd feel that pang of loss, the fury of the unfairness of no longer being able to do what they do because your hands and your nerves can't be trusted in the OR.
One of his army mates had been a professional athlete before joining the service, and he'd got John interested in the medical challenges of such a lifestyle. Instead of trying to get grannies to use their repaired hips at least a little, he would be trying to prevent professional athletes from putting their newly repaired tendons, muscles and bones to extreme duress too soon.
"On whose good authority is that?" Sherlock snaps. "One of your athletic sportsman friends you do so terribly many daily sports with?"
Sherlock snuggles into his usual position as the little spoon and waits for the inevitable as John scoots close and arranges the duvet on them both.
"Firstly, you have several actively involved, supportive family members, and you have John. Secondly, you were not suspended. Thirdly, you are financially secure even if…" Joanna pauses, probably reconsidering how to phrase things, "…even if this process has long-term consequences. This investigation doesn't affect your research career, nor should it do so in the future regardless of the outcome. According to John, your immediate superior had disagreed with the decision to escalate and has offered all the support he possibly can give to assist you in the process."
"I think it's A-fib. You had it right before surgery. Nothing life-threatening," you scramble to reassure him.
"I just worry about the cost. He could have chosen something else which would have made his life so much easier. I… I hate to see him frustrated. I always felt as if I didn't quite know what to do, how to fix it. What you said about the medical profession and coping skills… you see, he's never had any insight regarding his mental health. Things must have got very dire before he would agree to any sort of professional help?"
things he doesn't know how to name, and when John's warmth envelops him as he wraps his arms around Sherlock, he realises how cold he's been all his life.
Emma drops some pencils into a mug. "Um… that would be nice, but he… I don't think he'd answer the door." She exhales and swallows, looking worried, now.
"In addition to the two posterior chordae which had snapped, we found two anterior cusps fused together, and there was thickening and arching towards left atrium most likely caused by the endocarditis he had years ago. Just as we suspected, based on the CT, there wasn't enough healthy tissue in the connective ring to facilitate a plasty; we had to put in an artificial valve."
"Some relapse risk always remains," the cardiologist tells him in a superior tone. "We are just making sure you're well-informed about your choices."
"We got some emails at King's asking is the Trust could sell off some of our stock to some company owned by the state of Missouri. Sounds like they're pretty desperate."
a husband, as Dr Hooper and Dr Pichler would undoubtedly both remind him. Greg's request to try to get Sherlock to speak with him, and the awareness that Sherlock must have seen those headlines as he headed from the staff entrance to the outpatient clinic helps John make an even sturdier decision to initiate some conversation tonight.
"It's still a reminder of how flimsy things really are. I can assure you I am still more spooked, in some ways, by what happened than you are right now. I wasn't when it happened, because I managed to rationalise it to myself. Talking to Pichler has made me look at it more objectively."
Finally, there was a particularly difficult period in Sherlock's early adult life which is narrated in
Our sister has not spoken after the debacle at Sherrinford. My two visits to her, violin in tow, produced nothing but a few broken duets. Whoever she was, whatever she was, appears long gone and I don't quite know when it was even lost. Did I know the real her only as a child, before long years of incarceration stripped away what humanity remained in her? The woman I met as an adult was nothing but layers upon layers of constructed identity, playacting, scheming, manipulation and revenge. She would have avenged what happened after Victor's death with more death.
John tells himself, and marches to the lifts. He'll go to the OR floor, put the patient under, and do anything and everything he can to make sure Sherlock has the best circumstances under which to operate. That's the core of his job as an anaesthesiologist — look after the patient and to make sure the surgeon gets to focus fully on their part.
cases. A consultation does not mean turfing their patients onto me, it just means that I give my opinion based on the facts presented. My workday had ended when I was asked to give my opinion on Mrs Fairholme. I
Later that night, John wraps a bathrobe around himself after a hot bath and heads down the stairs, the kitchen as his destination. He isn't very hungry, mostly just feels the mood for a sugary snack to cheer himself up.
Sherlock huffs, but starts rolling the napkins around cutlery and sticking them in the vase at the end of the table. "John shall have no such thing. Should I do swans or perhaps Sydney Opera Houses?" he asks, presenting one of the rolled-up bundles to his mother, "or will these do?"
to feel those things for Victor, but his rational self begged to reject them. He loathed wanting things like that, things that made him vulnerable, slashed his carapace open for all to see. They made him little more than a creature of lust and other lowly desires — the sort of man he'd prided himself in never becoming.
Sherlock doesn't smile — if anything, the edges of his mouth pinch straighter in irritation. "I can assure you I'm more viscerally aware of time zones right now than you are." He takes off his jacket, opens the top two buttons of his dress shirt.
For the last three days, the research unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital should have offered him a haven away from his King's College worries, but despite his best efforts, he could not focus on his work there. He stared at the graphs, but the data which usually sang to him was suddenly mute.
, which should serve you fine. I think I might enjoy doing things to you once we find out sea legs with this relationship thing."
"Was that his thinking, too? He sought expert help, didn't he, because he was worried he was unable to support his husband, because he wanted to repair the rift in your relationship?"
John extricates from their embrace and picks up his hand, slipping fingers between Sherlock's. "I always want to listen to you. I just don't know how useful I can be."
"If you can do your job just as well with an oldschool system, then the cost can't be that big to keep both. The annual maintenance for one of the Zeiss systems owned by us is peanuts compared to those new rigs," John assures him. "It'll be a tough sell to the brass, that gynae system. They'll need to demonstrate significant benefit over a normal laparoscopy set."
Helena comes back in and is taken aback by the sight of Sherlock out of bed and looking as angry and pale as he is. "Is everything alright?" she asks, approaching the two of you, ready to take Sherlock's arm.
You quickly shift to the opposite side of the bed, lean closer and rest a palm on his cheek. "Sherlock? Eyes open, please. It'll all make more sense if you do."
John, having climbed to his feet, watches as Sherlock gently wraps the shaking, lethargic dog in the blanket. He feels rather useless; two human doctors are present, but they don't know much about the medical problems of dogs, nor can they do much about them.
oesophageal cardiac ultrasound = gives a much clearer view of certain heart structures since the bony thoracic cavity isn’t in the way. It can be done to sedated, awake patients, but it is not pleasant. In cardiac anaesthesia it is used during and after surgery once general anaesthesia is induced to assess heart function before and after the surgical repairs.
"No need to hide it. I'd find it anyway if I was… inclined. But I won't be, since I'm clean, remember? It's yours. You'll need it. It would be the lowliest thing to do to deprive you of it."
he would neglect the follow-ups. He always ignores his health, mostly just to spite those who care about him," Mycroft curses.
"Because you've spent years worrying about other people instead of yourself. I want you to stop. I want you to look after yourself, and I want to stop wasting time not doing what we should have done years ago."
"I'm just tired of everything. Of needing help. Of things always being so bloody difficult. Things other people can manage."
When his mother opens the door, he replies nothing to her fussy, surprised greetings. He realises he should have messaged them about taking a later train. He'd been so wrapped up in his thoughts, so struggling to manage to logistics to get here, that other people just didn't fit into the equation.
"Could it be that you are sensitive to John behaving indifferently or negatively towards you, because you fear the rejection you've experienced all your life from him above all others? John has attended therapy to process these things, and a part of
Instead of being a National Trust property like so many grand-but-expensive-to-upkeep country piles these days, Walstead House is owned by a City Banker who'd struck gold with some hedge fund. Last night at dinner, Violet had told Sherlock of how much bad blood his behaviour had created. The locals were particularly aghast when he had dared to wall off many popular public footpaths and refused to participate in river conservation efforts. The man did eventually realise how much easier keeping good relations with the locals might make life in a small village, so the permission to hold the market at the estate was granted as a gesture of goodwill.
Why hadn't he understood that he could talk to John like this? That he doesn't need a ghostly voice on the phone, the proverbial shallow grave of self-destruction, or anybody's permission? John is in his head and in his heart and in the memories of his skin. He doesn't need a computer algorithm to tell him what John would have thought or said. Not even the world's best microchip could approximate what it felt like to trail his hand down John's stomach or to fall asleep in his arms. All that belonged — still belongs — to him, all of it stored on his own hard drive. All of it, safely preserved in his Mind Palace.
John is squinting in the sunlight as he tucks his hand into the pockets of his worn jeans. "I don't go there for company, no." He sounds wistful, as if that isn't by his choice.
Why do you want the touch of this clammy, shaky hand enclosed in yours tonight more than their bodies and their attention?
"But you chose to talk to me about it instead of just marching off after terminating our therapeutic partnership. That's very good. In fact, it's the lesson I should have hoped you'd take away here — that it's always best to talk, even if it's frightening. We often fear a much worse outcome with emotional conversations than what eventually transpires."
John manages to shove an arm between them, laughing. "Put a lid on that, Ranger, until we get back to our room. Wouldn't want to get out of there just to get thrown in the brig for public indecency, hm?" He chides playfully, pushing Sherlock off his lap so that he can climb back onto his feet.
"Might take a while. Maybe you want to go have a bit of a rest? The sofa in the family room's not too bad."
Trying to find a way to express his concern, he can only revert to the truth. "I also know what it's like to recover from an injury. Twenty weeks in that metal monstrosity was enough to drive me to the edge. Give it time. That's what you used to say to me and, in hindsight, that statement was accurate. In this case, it should be a
Sherlock is incredulous. "You want me to admit things are not great? Gladly." When are they ever — except on rare occasions when he manages to convince himself he doesn't fail at things on a regular basis, which others manage effortlessly?
"Rarely performed and even more seldom recorded," Sherlock comments appreciatively. The angry lines which you have feared would etch permanently into his features are gone, and his heart rate is down, too. "Earliest known polyphonic death mass."
John grabs his mobile and shoves it into the back pocket of his jeans. “Enough. How do we get this plan going, then?” He asks Collings.
John glances over his shoulder just in time to see a very artful eyeroll that kills the nurse's protests. Secretly, he grins, relieved, under his mask, because this is not the Sherlock he'd parted ways with downstairs. No, this is classic Mister Holmes in his work persona, perhaps made a bit more prickly than usual by nerves, but it's still what the neurosurgical OR unit staff had learned to expect. Had, not has, since Sherlock hasn't given this act free rein in several years. He no longer feels such a need to ward off people prophylactically out of fear that he'll be bullied and ostracised. It's been wonderful for John to watch his confidence grow when it comes to social situations.
"There are several in Haywards Heath," Violet replies. "I don't know which one of them would offer emergency services on a Sunday."
Suddenly, it all clicks into place and Sherlock draws a deep breath. "You're not punishing me for making a mistake — you're judging me for not covering it up!"
The male choir sections are belting out accusatory phrases, accompanied by angry, low strings and occasionally echoed by the sopranos. Sherlock juts his chin towards the ceiling in a last-ditch effort to keep the tears from wrenching out of his tear ducts. By the time the concert ends, and they shuffle out into the crisp evening air among the quiet crowd awestruck by the music, Sherlock's cheeks are pinch-red, his nose stuffy and his spirit drained. He feels as though he's a part of a funeral procession. Perhaps sensing his mood, Mycroft refrains from attempting conversation.
"Talk to me," you bark. Captain Watson has entered this space and taken over because John Watson is currently frightened and unfunctional. You were always shite at this when it was your family. Always got suspended in some gawking state of confoundment, even rather basic medical knowledge abandoning you. Thank fuck for mnemonics and protocols. They always saved you when there was someone you knew on the table — friends, fellow soldiers.
Waiting for him in the appointment room is the seventh patient of the day — he is juggling a double load since Anderson is off sick after fracturing his wrist while roller-blading with his children.
John joins him by the side of the trolley. The copious amounts of vasoactive medications which are now being bolused and infused by the anaesthesia nurse according to their instructions had not fixed the blood pressure before, but now it suddenly skyrockets only to plummet.
"But you don't. From army surgeon to family physician on a remote island. Quite a transition," Sherlock confirms and grips the hand supports of his chair. "Then again, after Afghanistan, why wouldn't you want a bit of peace and quiet? Must've seen enough pain and suffering and gruesome injuries and violent deaths for a lifetime."
— beetles from a genus that gets their name for the Latin phrase 'able to dive'. They had reminded him of his childhood, digging around the ponds and hedges at their estate.
Once in the flat, he skims the note left by John on the fridge door reminding him that there are pasta leftovers in a container and steak salad in another.
The start of Sherlock’s hike to Pierowall is delayed by the fact that seagulls have ripped apart the garbage bag he'd left on the front steps. He’d had seen Angus drop his litter into an old oil barrel and close it with a lid, and now he understands why. Wildlife damage hadn't ever occurred to him, especially not damage caused by birds, and it looks like the attack has been vicious. He shoves everything back into the broken bag and leaves it just inside the door. It might start stinking, but that's better than having its contents spread around the garden. It's humiliating to realise how much of living here just doesn't occur to him after the conveniences of London. It had taken him three tries to get the hearth in the kitchen going yesterday. At home, if he doesn't succeed at once with the fireplace in the sitting room, he gives up. Here, he desperately needs the warmth for survival and for making tea, not in that priority order.
An elderly couple Sherlock recognises as a former dean of the medical school and his wife are looking at each other with Sherlock is quite certain is fondness in the fifth row.
He asks me when I found out, and when I think I got infected. It's hard to admit I don't know, that someone he's described as the most observant man in London is missing chunks of memory. I'm not quite sure if he ever believed that our alienation wasn't just an excuse for a cocaine and heroin binge, even if, during that binge, I also used some substances I'd never touched before, as confirmed to him by Mycroft. I'm not sure if he believes I did it for him. I won't press this point, because it would feel like blaming him.
"It's caused by what's happening in her brain," John explains while securing the portable respirator onto the side of the trolley. "Is radiology ready for us?"
Sherlock can hardly afford to turn down the offer, and why should he? He has questions about this island and trying to ask Angus will just lead to mutual confusion. He's keen to see what passes for a village, and to get to make some decisions about what to wear and what to eat.
That love would never expire, never cease just because of death. The only thing that could have turned it into past tense is if he'd stopped loving John and that was not a possibility. He'd mistreated that love many times, dismissed it, hid it with shame, pushed it away, excused terrible things with it. But it stubbornly existed, nearly burnt his heart out.
"Was the blood bright or like coffee grinds, or––" John realises Mycroft is unlikely to possess such details. "He needed sedation for… what? Gastroscopy?"
You've only heard such language from him once when he dislocated his elbow falling off a–– never mind. Not relevant right now. "Want to try that pillow again?"
a lot I don't know and didn't see about getting shot and right after," you tell him, grabbing the edge of his sleeve and then prying the phone out of his hands. "Because I just wanted to forget about it and move on."
John starts introducing things in the village as they turn from the street into the car park behind the buildings on the pier. "This is Gill Pier. The surgery's the first building on the right — used to be the customs office. Best sea views any GP could have, I guarantee. Heritage Centre and the Community Centre are over there, and Peter Miller's shop should have what we need in terms of food. The Wheeling Steen Gallery's got some fantastic photos on display and for sale. Three kirks on the island if you go for that sort of thing."
"You will leave that to me. I will provide a challenge he cannot decline, if only to prove his superiority."
It's Wednesday. Two weeks have passed since Sherlock couldn't chase a suspect. It's been thirteen days since his operation. You can't decide if other visitors than Mycroft would be a good or a terrible idea, and you can't decide if the decision should even be yours. Two days ago, when you'd gone for the afternoon, you'd returned to a disgruntled Sherlock who announced that Molly had, quote 'popped by without invitation', and that she 'did not stay long'. You have a hunch whatever kind of dreadful reception she'd received had affected that decision.
George was different. He'd spent his childhood in boarding schools. Always amicable, always liked but never the leader of the pack, easily adjusting to whatever circumstances necessary, he must've been the ideal pupil for such institutions. It was obvious Mycroft had inherited many of his good traits.
There are more whisky bottles in the sitting room, but these serve a purpose: John has stuck candles into them.
Once in the psychiatrist's waiting room, he lapses into deep thought. He had wanted to believe he could reason himself out of this without her help, but he cannot even decipher how the balance he has worked for, and now achieved, gives him no sense of equilibrium.
"It was always you, and no one else," I tell him, and the way he looks at me makes the doubts disappear.
The radiologist who had made a mistake in the Zezelj case has received his decision weeks ago since it never progressed to an MPTS tribunal. The GMC has given him just a warning after declaring his error a '
John may not match his intelligence, but Sherlock suspects there is no explanation he could give to buying class A drugs that John would consider acceptable. There is no logic that Sherlock could offer that John couldn't counter very easily.
"Then it's just a fluke. A random event. Like you said, your sobriety is intact even though you've gone through a lot in the past few years."
The frantic research explanation — more of a lecture at this point — continues, and then suddenly segues into a rant about how the hotel receptionist's handwriting was so atrocious that he had read the WiFi password wrong which had been the cause of his not answering John's first attempt.
He gets one of Sherlock's death glares and another yawn. "I might need the melatonin tonight, even if I feel tired enough to sleep now. Blasted time difference means I could wake up after an hour. Ground floor of the mall, you said?"
"No, they died," Sherlock replies, dropping into a chair and snatching a still-warm bread roll from a basket. "That's what people occasionally do."
' but they do seem to go down well and console people. Being consultant-grade seems to give me a high enough rank in their eyes that they trust my judgement even if they don't always… like me." These concluding words are spoken quietly, after which Sherlock glances at John to gauge his reaction.
"The family is not filing any sort of a complaint, Sherlock. Greg says they say they accepted the risks from the start and also accept what happened in surgery."
"It's a self-invented occupation," Mycroft interrupts dryly. "One that entails hurtling oneself out of windows and falling into skips."
naproxen = a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory; some research points to it being a bit safer for patients with certain heart problems or a heightened risk of GI bleeds than other NSAIDs. The use of non-steroidals should be minimised or avoided when on anticoagulant therapy.
"Most likely the investigation won't have wrapped up by the time those two months end," John points out.
The housekeeper walks up to them, introduces herself, and asks if Sherlock would like to leave his violin inside a locked side room while they wait for the ceremony. There is plenty of time left, so he takes her up on the offer. He then explores the rooms of the house open to the public and wanders around the stalls on the grounds while Violet talks to various people about schedules and arrangements. She seems to know everyone which doesn't surprise him — she's been a part of the local charity scene for many years. She seems to have become one of those 'ladies who lunch' — quite a contrast to a university economics professor.
Mike removes his gloves, drops them into a bin and rises to his feet. He's a burly and not very tall man, but right now he towers over his hesitant patient. "You're already in full cardiac dysfunction. Your left ventricle will desperately try to keep you alive until it can't, and that moment is not far, so I'm going to go find you a surgeon," he says and gives Sherlock's arm a haphazard pat. "We'll get you sorted."
Roy pushes his glasses up his nose and gives Sherlock a slight, detached smile that feels like a personal insult.
mean is that those experiences couldn't have been traumatic for his husband. The way both you and him have described his regret at the turns your relationship took after Afghanistan tells me that much of his behaviour at home was reactive, too. But it doesn't help either of you to deny its impact on you."
"I'm… I'm not a very good husband," Sherlock explains, but his expression crumples halfway through the sentence just as his voice breaks. He buries his face in his palms, elbows on the table. "I'm not good at any of it," he manages to add, the words strained and wet as they are gasped out between sobs.
John opens his mouth, then snaps it shut. It's not like Sherlock to waste time on a radiological study that won't change the patient's outcome or their management plan. Usually, Sherlock is quite economical in terms of ordering films and labs since he can rely on his exceptional diagnostic skills based on the thorough status exams he does and the things he can deduce from signs and symptoms that other doctors fail to notice.
Sherlock coughs a bit, flops back onto his back. Any movement he initiates seems to be causing him pain judging by his heart hate and the way his features scrunch up and his breathing hitches.
When the trial starts, Isabelle Halloran's words prove prophetic. Sherlock's time being interviewed by the defendant's barrister has barely clocked ten minutes, but John is already shaking his head in the back of the courtroom. He's spent a sleepless night worrying about how things will go today, and they haven't started out well at all. Sherlock has not been able to resist being provoked by the defence team.
John can tell he's getting overwhelmed by it all. When he'd heard that the OR was secured and suspect was brought out into the yard, adrenaline had made John's fingertips tingle. Moments later, his knees had nearly buckled when the stress hormones had finally let up. Sherlock is probably reaching that stage.
"Most people aren't in a position where forgetting things leads to disastrous consequences," Sherlock mutters. The longer John holds him, the harder it is to resist to relax, to lean his weight against his husband and to close his eyes.
"There's another surgery on in the afternoon," Sherlock reminds him, swiping at his eyes as he extricates himself from John's arms.
"How would you punish John if your roles were reversed?" Her tone is oddly neutral, her expression calm and curious.
"Oooh," the lighthousekeeper comments at the sight of the bloodied, shirt-wrapped arm. He lifts the edge of a sleeve but does not attempt to unwrap it. There's a word salad with some empathetic head-shaking, then the words "ay, doct'r" seem to agree with Sherlock's repeated suggestion that they might go looking for some medical care.
Joanna chuckles reservedly. "We do, but no. What sort of person would behave in the ways you described? What kind of life would lead to that kind of thinking?"
"George? Yes, dear, he was fine, why would he not be?" Violet is surprised. "earned yourself a proper degree. Well, we had hoped that your advisers would encourage you to go into research rather than surgery, but we shan't get into that now."
, Sherlock wants to argue, but then decides against it. Out of all the people he's known who are not his relatives, it's odd how John just might know him best. Even though he'd practically been undercover on Westray, he might just have accidentally played the role of his true self when with John.
"I want you to speak in hypothetical. It's often easier to be objective when we remove a problem from being connected to a certain person."
'Have you ever had to attend to a family member who's poorly in a way that would require weeks to recover to full health?' Sherlock asks.
Their old landlord had popped by one evening to offer his condolences for what Sherlock was going through. He'd been the one to file a complaint to the GMC about Sherlock's conduct when he was a registrar at the National. When Sherlock and John had proven together that the man's wife had not been the victim of medical malpractice, Dr Allen Baxter had buried the hatchet by offering a great flat for them to rent together before they'd purchased this flat. Baxter had even become a friend of sorts, but his visit had not brought Sherlock any consolation. John suspects it had been merely a painful reminder of that first incident that could have cost Sherlock his career. During the visit, he'd abandoned Dr Baxter and John in the kitchen mid-conversation and retreated into the bedroom. John had apologised to the retired urologist, tried to explain that Sherlock was under a lot of pressure. Dr Baxter, of course, understood all that and left. Now, John wonders if it was perhaps that visit that had shattered what remained of the illusion that this hell couldn't breach the sanctum of their home.
"He says to expect for the Interim Orders Tribunal to happen within the next two weeks. There is no need for Sherlock to attend since he won't be asked to give testimony. They rarely, if ever, change the initial Interim Order, and Vandersteen thought it particularly unlikely in a case that has garnered such intense public interest. It would not look good for the GMC to eat their words about needing to protect the public and to retain public confidence without any formal hearings having taken place."
He reaches the wing housing King's A&E unit. Even before he presses his palm on the button to open the doors to the trauma bay, he can both hear and sense the urgency inside. Many major trauma alerts turn out to be stable duds with only minor injuries, and the excited buzz dies down quickly. It is good news for the patient, of course, since it means that their injuries have turned out to be less severe than predicted, but John would be lying if he claimed that the more dramatic, life-or-death cases didn't create a very special sort of excited and nervous motivation for the staff.
"Neither of us has ever put any stock on such cultural rituals as weddings and funerals, and there's certainly no need for some thespian spectacle of grief now. Forget Victor Trevor and move on."
John shrugs. If this man can tell everything about him just by looking at him, there's no keeping secrets, is there? "The patients I have expect a certain level of service from me, a service they can't get from public healthcare. Going above and beyond what people expect is, well, what they
"I'm not sure…" you hesitate, staring at the screen. Your table is in a secluded corner, but you still glance around, worried someone will think you've stolen a hospital laptop. "Not sure I should be looking at this."
Suddenly, an idea occurs. Instead of trying again to coax him to take off his coat, she grabs her own from a hanger on the wall near the kitchen only a few paces away.
By the time they reach their building and slip into the downstairs foyer, however, John is looking rather pale. He drops into the chair by the stairs, closing his eyes and leaning his head against the wall.
The purpose of the letter not just to inform Sherlock that an investigation has begun. It is informing him — with a copy sent to the Trust — that an
"I'm not engaging in some infantile dare," Sherlock scoffs, peering into the now empty Tupperware container.
He proudly presents John the water bottle he had couriered to the flat. It’s self-cooling, and alerts with a chime if one has not reached one’s drinking goals for the past two hours.
Sherlock will only need the stand for the Rondeau; he still knows Winter by heart because it's one of John's favourites, too. "Yes, he was."
His dismissive statements about medical staff as a collective seem to echo things from his past, perhaps from the days when he frequented A&E departments due to his drug use. Addicts often need such services for fractures, infections from injecting into veins, overdoses, psychotic behaviour. You can't help but send a thought out to Mycroft who'd looked after his little brother in those times, kept him alive. Sherlock, sober but ill, is a handful. Sherlock, off his tits
John hadn't quite thought of it that way. As a trainee, Sherlock must have received lots of feedback and appraisals, and much of it probably focused on his communication difficulties. While some of what Sherlock has just said is probably coloured by depression and years of emotional me-against-the-world defence strategies, he's right — not even Greg gives him much praise for the quality of his work.
"You think something must be wrong with me if I don't want sex whenever having it occurs to you?" Sherlock complains into his shoulder.
He removes his stitches with old scissors he disinfects with a lit match. The wound is closing, has scabbed, and is showing no signs of infection as far as he can tell. He hopes he's removed the stitches before they'd leave a railroad track scar. He wishes for no permanent marks of John Watson's existence on his skin. The memories are enough.
John drums the desk with his fingertips, looking thoughtful. "He said to me that he wishes you hadn't called him in and told the whole team what you think happened. Radiology could've taken the fall for this, but you won't let them."
"I know you know I won't read too much into this," John reminds him, still puzzled, but wanting to be sure Sherlock understands that naked contact may lead to physiological reactions he can’t control.
The side effects hit with a vengeance. I get dizzy if I move too fast, which leads to a most spectacular crash onto the floor as I try to climb over the coffee table while distracted by the taxonomy of Lepidoptera. At least Rosie thought it funny. There's fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and my gastrointestinal system becomes a disaster zone.
"And I cannot imagine how I could have been more honest of my faults in that regard. Ever since I was accepted into medical school, I have had to work twice as hard as others to get by. While excelling academically, I have faced many periods during my career when it would have been the path of least resistance to quit. Disability laws are what they are, but patients are not interested in why their doctor or the medical student bothering them is so odd, rude or difficult — they just want someone
Sherlock is certain that John would and suspects that Lestrade might also be inclined, but what about the others?
The rules at Princess Royal are that whoever comes to pick a patient up from the ENT ward must come all the way up to their room so that they, too, will hear the discharge instructions the patient is given. Sherlock asks Edgar to come along so that he gets all the pertinent info for keeping John company during the next few days. John is not aware of this plan; Sherlock will accept no arguments against it, so it would be pointless to raise the subject beforehand. John is given a discharge bag containing a disposable emesis bowl, a juice box, tissues and post-discharge instructions. Sherlock removes the bag from his lap and deposits it with Edgar.
It had still felt like admitting defeat to ask Mycroft to host his brother, no matter how gracious the older Holmes was about it all.
