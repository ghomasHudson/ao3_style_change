“Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn’t hungry?”
“Hatty, hi, I’m Sherlock, this is John. I was just wondering whether you could come with us to explain your situation to your husband, as he’s been rather worried about you.” Sherlock replies and fake-smiles at her.
Hope.
At first, he thought he could get past it, that after a couple of days he’d have already forgotten the blue-eyed army doctor. He spent much of the beginning of February involving himself in any crime-related opportunity that arose, annoying Lestrade even more than usual. The few remaining nights were filled with a number of experiments, some of which might have included analysing a sample of every perfume currently available on the market. But even though he used to be able to rely on The Work distracting him from anything and everything, John Watson crept in on his mind more often than not. He tried locking the door to the newly-built room in his mind palace, even tried to delete the man in question completely, but nothing worked. Now he remains cursed with the knowledge that his soulmate is out in London enjoying his life whilst Sherlock is slowly turning into a shadow of himself.
“I think I forgot to tell you something earlier,” Sherlock suddenly says.
Slowly, I’m starting to feel angry. Sherlock had better shut up sooner or later.
“Really?”
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock replied. He opened the orange tube only to smear the colour all over his hands while doing so.
“It’s still quite early.” John says. “Are you tired?”
Sherlock remains silent but his expression shifts.
“Would you rather eat somewhere else?” Sherlock asks instead.
Sherlock stares at him, and for a second John believes to see guilt in his features. “It was all under scientific, laboratory conditions. You were never in any danger.”
When Sherlock presses him closer to the outside wall, John is glad for the support of the stone cold wall, forming an intriguing contrast to Sherlock’s warm body. He grabs another handful of Sherlock’s coat to get even closer, bringing a hand up into Sherlock’s hair; and can hear Sherlock lightly groan in response. One of Sherlock’s hands is around John’s neck while the other is wrapped around his back, caressing him ever so slightly. Hot waves of desire stir up in John’s loins, making themselves noticeable rather embarrassingly. He briefly thinks that he’ll never be able to stop, when Sherlock breaks off and steps back abruptly.
John slowly tilted his head forward, anticipation flooding his body. He had kissed Sherlock once before, and had laid awake many night since then wondering if he’d ever feel those lips again. Sherlock still stared at him with dark eyes, his breath so close John could feel it on his lips.
The months following his invalidity were the hardest of his life. He sought a purpose in the dull routine of his existence, failing to return back from the war with his body and soul alike. Only when he started working as a doctor again he felt useful, if only for the sake of his patients. He started thinking that his person would give him a purpose in life, and even signed up to one of the bloody websites. It was in that time when he wished to find his person for the first time in his life that he met Mary, instead. Upon first laying eyes on her, he wished to feel the sensation of their souls bounding when he shook her hand – but nothing happened. After a couple of weeks of consideration, he decided to take matters into his own hands. How likely was it that he ever found his person, anyway? Wasn’t he too old already? Did he really want to remain lonely for the rest of his life because of a childhood fairy-tale?
I take a deep breath. “Mary, I still don’t know whether you can hear me. I never asked Sherlock when he returned from the dead. Anyway, I need to tell you something. When I last saw you, I told you that I wanted more with that girl from the bus, who later turned out to be Sherlock’s crazy sister - but that’s another story. Since then I haven’t wanted more with anyone for a long time, but now… God, I can’t believe I’m about to say it out loud… I am in love. I haven’t told anyone, but I wanted you to know. It’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen, so I might as well tell my wife about it. I think deep down you always knew…”
“Yes?”
“I don’t know what’s supposed to be funny about my misery.”
All Sherlock can do is nod, because he’s afraid of the reply he’d give.
“I’ll see you tonight,” she calls after him, not looking up.
“We’re going out for dinner. I picked out a suit for you, it’s on your bed,” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly.
“I’m not done, yet, you can go back to bed,” he says.
Sherlock can’t keep himself from slightly blushing at the compliment. “Oh that. Well, there are no cows here, as you made me realise yesterday, so I figured they were accomplished by shoeing the horses with shoes shaped like cows’ hooves.”
“I would like that very much,” Rosie replied and pulled Sherlock along towards the giant air-filled playhouse.
“Oh, sorry, dear!” She replies, stands up and lightly pats my arm before walking away, still laughing hysterically. I can’t help but feel amused at the happy sight of my former landlady.
The only thing I can do now is desperately hope that he believed me. My gaze wanders down to Speedy’s and I think back to all the uncountable times Sherlock and I picked up lunch there, when we were too lazy to even go out around the corner to a restaurant or to order takeaway. Tears are filling in my eyes and I have to blink rapidly. Mrs. Hudson isn’t expecting me. She could be gone to do the grocery shopping, for all I know. She probably doesn’t even want to see me. I turn around as I feel panic rising up inside me, and leave. I don’t look back.
“My body’s betraying me. Interesting, emotions. I always considered them the grit in the lens, the fly in the ointment.” Sherlock slams the glass down onto the table, the golden liquor stirring inside.
Sherlock starts to think about the way John cares for his patients, about how he treats victims’ bereaved with a kindness Sherlock could never imitate, how he saved Sherlock’s life over and over again, risking his own in the process, how he’s the only person in the world willing to accept Sherlock for who he truly is. Words don’t seem to do him justice, but Sherlock tries anyway.
to him. John mouthed
“Good.” I decide to move things to the bed. Sherlock is tugging on my shirt again as we make our way to the bed. I pull it over my head and watch Sherlock unbutton his own. His eyes are fixed on me the entire time, his beautiful eyes that shine chartreuse in the dim light of the room. He leans closer and kisses me tenderly. God, how can he be so good at this? I shouldn’t even be surprised. This man is brilliant at everything.
“What? Were you with a patient?”
Sherlock shifts at the mention of John. Miller seems to know a great deal more than the public, seeing as John and Sherlock kept the nature of their relation private.
“I’m sorry I don’t have any clothes for her here,” he whispers. We’re both standing next to the crib, watching Rosie, who is already half asleep.
in his lap, his expression as unreadable as ever.
He thinks about his options. Going out to buy a jumper for Sherlock seems like a waste – considering Sherlock would only wear it once. Calling Mary to bring one of John’s jumpers doesn’t seem like a good idea, either, because she’d probably think him mad for taking care of Sherlock’s cold. The only option suitable enough is offering his own jumper to Sherlock, but how would that come across? Besides, it probably wouldn’t even fit.
“Yes, Sherlock. What do you want me to do up there? I don’t even know what kind of a crime has been committed.”
“I’m glad you had time for me today, Mr. Holmes. The truth is, I’m devastated and you’re my only hope. The police are absolutely rubbish.”
“Oh, yes, of course.”
Ever since Sherlock died, I’ve been receiving a lot of criticism and hate, or rather, hate on his behalf. At first, I tried to ignore the people that kept commenting on my old blog posts saying that Sherlock was a fake, but after a while the urge got stronger to reply and defend him. I started writing back, started having heated conversations via mail with complete strangers. It helped to release my anger a bit, but in the long run most people still didn’t believe me. They only believed what they had heard in the news, that Sherlock invented Moriarty and that he had actually committed all the crimes himself. I was getting furious. Sherlock had probably saved some of their lives, and yet these utter prats didn’t believe in him. It really got to me, and I kept thinking of a way to prove Sherlock’s innocence. Maybe publishing some of our old cases is gonna help those idiots to see Sherlock for who he really was. If they could see him through my eyes, they would never doubt him. He was so much more human than he let the public know. In a way he was the most human human being I’ve ever known.
John swallowed, unable to break the silence stretching through the darkened living room. When he finally turned his head to reply, Sherlock was gone.
“I haven’t? I’m meeting an old friend from Bart’s. I ran into him the other day and he asked me about getting a drink after work sometime. I thought I’d said.”
“That’s brilliant.” John’s face has turned into a mixture of astonishment and amazement, the same expression Sherlock has seen on their very first case together and continued to see through all the years they have been working together. It finally feels like old times.
“Yes, obviously.”
“Shhh, Rosie, everything’s fine. Daddy’s here.” I whisper to her ear.
After a couple of minutes, John starts talking anyway. He tells Sherlock everything; the death of his mother causing his father to drown his grief in alcohol and to vent his anger on his son’s body; his subsequent unemployment and their eviction; his father’s incomprehension of his daughter’s sexuality; and his death due to liver failure before John joined the army. Sherlock sits still listening, not adding anything to the conversation. His frustration and anger rise with John’s narration. How could such bad things happen to such a good human being? How could anyone in their right mind treat a child like this? How could John, despite everything he went through in his infancy, turn out to be the most caring and understanding man Sherlock has ever known?
“Ah, Anderson. Here we are again,” Mr. Holmes says. It’s obvious from his tone that he’s not particularly fond of the officer.
Sherlock brings the pill closer to his mouth, watching the man mirror his movement with the other one. The second before the pill touches Sherlock’s lips, a gunshot fills the air. The bullet hits the cabbie right in the chest, too close to his heart to be curable. He falls back onto the floor, a look of surprise on his face. Sherlock drops the pill immediately and hurries over to the window, seeking the shooter that might have saved his life. The window of the opposite room is wide open, but there’s no one to be seen.
Sherlock feels as timid as in the days when they first got together and he asked John every time if he could kiss him. “Can I hug you? It’s just that I missed you so much these last three days, and I...” He lets the sentence trail off. He realises how desperate and needy he sounds, but this is John, his John, and he would give anything to hold him right now.
“Pranking Mycroft does sound like a good idea,” Sherlock replied thoughtfully. “Although my initial idea included finally drinking that Bowmore we were gifted by Mr. Carlyle last year.”
“I’m afraid not. Only the white ones.” I cross my arms and wait. This is not something I want to miss. I watch Sherlock as he carefully scatters some baby powder onto a sheet and dips the make-up brush into it. I am half expecting him to apply the powder to his face when he lifts the phone up with gloves on his long fingers and lightly dabs the powder onto it. He holds the phone close and repeats the process, examining where the powder settles.
“Yes. So?”
“We’ll see how it goes, hopefully there won’t be any embarrassing silences,” John says while placing his mug into the sink. He picks up his lunch bag, crosses the kitchen to where Mary is still reading and presses a light kiss onto her temple.
“I don’t think he’s – “
“So, what are we going to do about Rosie’s wish?” he asked.
“Yes, of course. I promised you I wouldn’t, but I couldn’t possibly turn down this case. I hope you understand.”
“Well, I guess I could do it by myself.”
“Are you sure? Maybe I could come back on the 26th and we could –“
Sherlock has to blink several times, trying to let the words sink in. The last six weeks were a torture for him, but all this time he thought John had already forgotten him. The only comforting thought was that he was doing what John wanted, what was best for him. Knowing that he was unhappy as well makes it all so much worse.
“I’m leaving. There’s someone I need to see.”
“So, basically, you guess?”
Sherlock is unimpressed. He tries to bury his face even deeper in the magazine he is currently studying and replies “I don’t have time today, Lestrade.”
I try to respond, but am actually taken aback. Sherlock hasn’t really talked about the time he spent unravelling Moriarty’s network. He’s obviously uncomfortable speaking about it. He’s still staring at me, and for a moment I can see a flicker of hurt in his eyes. In the next instant, however, it’s gone.
“Absolutely. I mean, if you don’t mind.”
Sherlock turns around and stares at John. For a moment, John returns his look, and their eyes meet.
“Oh, of course. I’m sorry,” John replies. If Sherlock didn’t know any better, he would suspect to hear disappointment in John’s voice. “Goodnight then.”
“Yeah, it was. See you soon, best man,” I add with a grin. I immediately regret saying that so I turn around and leave to escape Sherlock’s amused look.
He smiles. I place a kiss on his cheek and lie down next to him.
“That’s not a bear, that’s obviously a cricket!”
I can’t help but stare at the motion he is doing with his hands. If he did something like that with his – no, don’t even think about that. I clear my throat. He really does go through a lot of trouble to access this phone. “Why is that so important to you, anyway? It’s just a bloody phone,” I blurt out.
He doesn’t look back.
“John?”
“Er, it was Mrs Hudson laughing,” I manage to reply.
After John’s departure at the crime scene the other night, Sherlock managed to find the missing (pink) suitcase within a couple of hours. Obviously, none of Scotland Yard’s officers were of any help, but that didn’t keep Sherlock from strolling around the nearest area of the crime scene by himself. Once he found the suitcase, he immediately sent out two texts; one to the potential serial killer and one to John, asking him to meet him at Angelo’s tonight. Getting John’s number was ridiculously easy, but when John didn’t respond, he added a short
“Oh god, John. You’re so beautiful.”
“There’s an Off switch, John.”
“Yes, John. If we’re going to do this, we’ll do it properly,” Sherlock said and pulled out the larger of the two rings. He grabbed John’s hand and swiftly placed it onto his ring finger, before taking the other ring and placing it onto his own.
I stand up and head towards the door. I need to get out of here before I do or say something stupid. “I’m going out. Make sure Rosie wakes up in an hour.”
“… possibly dying,” I conclude.
“And you read my writing upside down.” She gives me a long look. “You see what I mean?”
“Keep your distance; leave John alone. Tell him you don’t enjoy his company anymore.”
He heard John’s giggle from behind. “No, absolutely not. Go ahead.”
“Oh my god!”
“Yeah, sure.”
“Okay, do you remember my ex-boyfriend Francis?”
“Yes?”
“Too hot,” John says, looking down at his shirt. “Do you want me to turn off the lights?” he asks.
“Fine.” Now John sounds slightly annoyed.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?”
The only thought comforting him is that he didn’t bring John. No matter what that psychopath tried telling him, there’s no way in the world Sherlock would want John to be drowning in this tank with him. Is that ugly grin really the last thing on earth Sherlock shall see? With the water blurring his vision it’s harder to see Miller, but then Sherlock notices a figure approaching from behind. Miller, still enjoying the show, doesn’t seem to notice. For a second Sherlock is sure to see the person his mind is clinging onto, but he hopes it’s just his hallucination.
“Sure, John, I – ”
“I can’t...” Sherlock doesn’t know how to end the sentence.
“Not saving you isn’t debatable. I would do it again in a heartbeat, and nothing you say will change that, Sherlock. That’s what friends do,” John replies.
“I can sense that you’re feeling distressed,” Sherlock admits. It’s rare for either of them to mention their bond so openly.
“You remember that?”
As soon as we’re in the cab, he turns his head to the window and starts talking. “I haven’t really talked to the client, yet, except via e-mail, but I’ll ask him to repeat his story in a face-to-face conversation. I only know that the client got married on the 22th and his bride apparently disappeared from the reception. He couldn’t come to Baker Street so we’re meeting him at his house.”
“Of course I’m okay, why wouldn’t I be okay?” He seems confused.
“What… how… where have you been?!” John asks, taking a step back to study Sherlock’s appearance properly.
“I mean… we can take things slow, is what I’m trying to say,” John adds.
“The day of your accident, I was bored and begged Lestrade for a case. He offered me to watch some houses which were likely to be the victims of a series of burglary from his car, and I texted you to come along after your shift. When you came to the parking lot you never buckled your seat belt because we were parked, and it wasn’t really necessary. Then the other car hit us because the driver lost control and you crashed through the windshield. All because of me.”
After half an hour of comforting and once Rosie had fallen asleep in Sherlock’s arms, he got up from the sofa and finally looked at John. “I’m putting her back to bed.”
“... but I haven’t heard otherwise from you since, so I’m assuming she’s immortal. As for the president, I’ve heard that the last one was some moron who got fired last year, and now there’s this woman in charge from the other party, I needed the information for a case last December.”
“I came over to the college as soon as possible, but somehow I ended up on the wrong side of the building,” John continues.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. Great, so he doesn’t believe me.
A nurse comes in to check on John and tells Sherlock that his state is unchanged. What an utterly stupid deduction. Sherlock has already examined every inch of John’s body and would’ve noticed any change right away. He currently observes the rise and fall of John’s chest, as it turned out to be a soothing movement.
“What did you wish for, love?”
A moment later a pillow is flying through the air and hitting me on the chest. “Outsch!”
“Yes, this is Dr. John Watson. Dr. Watson, this is Detective Inspector Lestrade.” John briefly shakes the man’s hand from across the tape – at least he’s got the manners to do so.
“It sounds crazy, I know.” She settles her mug on the small table next to her and rests her palms on her lap. “The problem is... John hasn’t really been himself, lately. He has issues concentrating at work and he’s constantly in a bad mood. He’d never mention anything to me, but I know him. He’s miserable. And I think it’s because of his current situation with you.”
Sherlock makes a humming sound of approval, so I enter. My best friend is sitting on his bed with his knees crossed. His hair is a mess from a (probably sleepless) night and he’s wearing a camel coloured dressing gown. I feel the almost familiar jump in my heart upon seeing him, although I haven’t gotten used to it yet. In front of him there are about twenty different rug samples in different shapes and sizes. He has a pipette filled with dark red liquid in his hand and carefully places a couple of drops onto the carpets.
“You know I don’t think anyone’s ever complimented me this way before. I hope I truly am the man you describe me to be.”
John stays still in the middle of the room, unsure how to proceed. Maybe Sherlock went to Bart’s for another experiment, Greg needed his assistance at a crime scene, Mrs. Hudson went out to buy the groceries with him, or Mycroft decided to finally engage in a brotherly activity – there are a million possible explanations for his absence. For some reason, though, John knows that neither of them are correct.
“Happy New Year, John,” he says, his gaze now locked to the sky.
But with the case wrapped and the terrorists behind closed doors, Sherlock doesn’t have enough of a distractor to stop his mind from wandering back to London, to him. Upon waking, his face is the first thing he sees. At night, in the dark hotel room, the name he never dares to think of during the day is the only thing he can think of. Sherlock sometimes wonders whether he has similar experiences, but he never dared to exploit their connection and sense how he’s doing. He’s not even sure whether it would work from such distance.
“Right, of course.” Sherlock feels exposed. The reminder that Baker Street isn’t John’s home is too cruel for this early hour.
“If you don’t mind, I would like to sleep now,” he interrupts John’s talk.
“What’s that supposed to mean?!”
“I guess there’s room for improvement,” Sherlock replies, feeling wet lines of red running down either sides of his bended leg. His hands and feet are tied together, making it unable for him to move expect for maybe fall to the side, which obviously isn’t an option.
“Afghanistan. I’m sorry, how did you –”
I’m not actually gay.
“Yes.”
“You know it’s not good for the baby.”
“Yes, it’s fine. It’s absolutely fine.” Sherlock has already half left when he turns back around towards John hesitantly.
“Tell me more about her,” Sherlock says while ducking down towards the flower bed beside the wall of the house. He can feel John’s gaze on him, who’s standing next to him on the gravel path.
John starts to giggle, and Sherlock wishes he could bottle up the sound and get drunk on it.
“I know you didn’t plan on returning, but London – and every Londoner’s life – is at stake. I thought you might want to take the case yourself,” his brother says.
“He can’t just vanish.” Sherlock starts pacing the room. “There’s something, something I’m missing. Something that’s staring me in the face,” he murmurs more to himself than to either of them.
“Why did you lie to her?” he asks Sherlock while he’s (again) ducking under the police tape Sherlock holds up for him.
“Look!” Sherlock interrupts. He holds up the container for me to see the violet colour vaporising in it. I can’t help but be amazed. Sherlock carefully extracts the phone from the container and takes a closer look.
“Yeah, it’s Christmas,” John says while shrugging his shoulders. “What’s wrong? Isn’t this what we usually do? Don’t we exchange gifts on Christmas?” His voice has started to sound tense.
“I don’t know, Sherlock.” He comes even closer and pulls Sherlock into a tight embrace. This one is different from their last one, although in the exact same spot. Sherlock tries to enjoy it one last time, but he’s burning inside.
Sherlock points his head in the direction of the Chinese restaurant we used to frequent so regularly. I can’t help but sigh at the sight. I haven’t been here in a long time.
“Sherlock? I… Are you okay?”
“Where’s Rosie?”
“John, I –“
We slowly make our way closer to the house, or should I say mansion. While Sherlock checks the windows, I look at the basement door. It’s locked. Even the basement door has a security system. There’s no way anyone could open it forcefully, not even Sherlock. I return to find my friend already back at the brick wall. He winks at me and suddenly I see the hysterical look on his face. I turn around and see a small child standing in the window pane, watching me. Since I can’t think of anything better to do, I smile at her and slowly walk backwards. The girl looks at me curiously but apparently doesn’t intend to alarm her parents. When I finally reach Sherlock, I practically fall into his arms, still walking with my eyes fixed on the girl.
, above all? Why couldn’t she have wished for a bloody pony?
“John, I… I can’t do it. I don’t know how,” Sherlock admits, still on the floor. “Forgive me, John.”
John joins him on the bed. This time, he wears a proper T-shirt. Sherlock can’t hide the hint of frustration crawling onto his expression. He leaves for the bathroom himself and finds John still sitting on the side of the bed when he returns.
“Now what was that about?!”
The innkeeper looks puzzled. “I’m sorry? Do you need two rooms?”
“How about you go home with your husband and talk about the details then?” Dr Molder saves Sherlock from having to respond.
“Do you really... you mean...  are you sure?” Was all he was capable of saying. His heart was beating too fast and for a moment he forgot to breathe.
“We’re staying at The Crossed Keys,” he adds towards the cabbie.
“John,” Sherlock pants simultaneously, and together they reach the point of culmination. John senses Sherlock’s desire as clearly as his own, multiplying his orgasm in the best of ways. He is sure to see stars behind his closed eye-lids, but he opens them in time to witness the last moments of Sherlock’s climax.
John stares at the small unmistakable package and then looks up at Sherlock.
“Magnussen wasn’t a good man and he had Mary, and therefore you, under his control. He could’ve destroyed your life at any point, and I couldn’t risk that. He wanted to play games with you. It started right there before I shot him when he flicked your face several times simply because he could. He had a power over you that couldn’t be taken away from him otherwise. So it was my only choice.”
“I’ve been having an affair with a guy from the gym.”
He detangles himself from the blanket and gets up in a rush, regretting it immediately. He throws over his whine coloured dressing gown and hurries into the kitchen. Luckily, John deposited the most necessary house-hold medicine in one of the cupboards a couple of months ago. Sherlock gulps down a pain killer with a whole glass of water, refills it and quietly enters the living room.
Does John really want to share a room with him?
A yawning Rosie was carried into the kitchen a couple of minutes later. She had her arms firmly around Sherlock’s neck, her hair still a mess from sleeping.
“How’s your blog going?” Ella asks later, during our session. She suggested we use each other’s first names. Probably thinks I’m gonna open up more or something.
“Yes, Mr. Holmes. And I don’t think you’ll decline.” He hands Sherlock an envelope that contains two Business Class boarding passes for Sherlock and John for the flight number 007 to Baltimore.
“I want to stay at home today, if you don’t mind,” he declares and moves over into his chair. I follow him, pick up the book from my desk and sit down in the chair opposite to him.
Sherlock rolls over to the side, now facing the wall. John doesn't have to realise how much he's enjoying this.
“Really, John? That doesn’t even remotely match the dressing gown.”
“Yes. You see, my mind rebels at stagnation. I abhor the dull routine of existence; I crave for mental exaltation. That’s why I’ve created my own particular profession.” He watches John’s face light up.
“Seems quite theoretical to me,” Dr. Watson replies, shrugging his shoulders and looking around the lab once more.
“What? No, no. I meant because of earlier. I don’t know why Rosie said that and I just – ”
“It’s not like that between us. It never has been. He’s just not like that.”
“Since the funeral? Yeah I was quite busy, I guess. I’m good, I’ve been working a lot since Sherlock…” She lowers her eyes and for a second I can see a flicker of sadness in them.
John gives the doctor and Sherlock a long look. “Okay. Okay, maybe that’s for the best,” he finally says. “I should probably get changed then.” He looks around the room for his clothes, which Mrs. Hudson had brought with her the very first night she visited.
“I’ll go get changed then.”
“It’s always gonna be the two of us,” I say.
He looks up briefly and repeats the question “Which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“I don’t know. To be honest, I haven’t told anyone, not even my former therapist…”
When the show is over, John turns to his side, facing Sherlock. Sherlock turns off the TV and does the same.
“There’s nothing I’d rather do,” John replied before lifting his daughter up and carrying her over to the pavilion. They danced for two songs before Rosie got distracted.
It was the last thing Mary ever said to me. Well, not technically, because that was my imagination of her. But I feel like it’s what Mary would’ve said if she knew.
John slowly takes the gun out of his back pocket and shoots the man right into his thigh. He’s an easy enough target, standing still in the middle of the room with his back turned to John, completely unaware of his presence. With a heart-rending cry he drops to the floor. John quickly runs over to him.
John smirks while raising an eyebrow. “Fine. But if you do get killed, don’t come back to haunt me.”
“Is everything alright?” I ask.
She cuts him off. “John, it’s okay.”
Just as I am about to ascend the stairs, I hear hysterical noises coming through the door of 221A. Fearing that Mrs Hudson might have lost her mind, I open the door to check on her. She is sitting at her table and, I realise with relief, laughing in a high-pitched tone.
We leave the flat and take a cab to one of the richer districts in London. The houses seem to get bigger and bigger until the cab finally comes to a halt. We stand in front of a Victorian villa with huge windows and a large garden surrounded by a brick wall. Sherlock aims straight at the wall and examines the installed security system with great interest.
Apparently his person can read him like an open book. Sherlock isn’t sure if he likes it.
“Excuse me, where is my key?” Sherlock asks. He is already annoyed at this man.
John clears his throat. What the hell is he supposed to say to that? When he can’t think of a reply, he stays silent, focusing on Sherlock’s eyes instead. It was probably meant as a joke, but now that John returns his gaze, Sherlock doesn’t speak, either. His eyes lay on John. All of a sudden, there’s that sort of electricity in the air John only sensed once before – when he first touched Sherlock’s hand. This time they’re not even touching, but the tension is almost palpable.
“I don’t know how to defuse a giant bomb. What about you?”
Sherlock had apparently lost his mind. He blinked several times, feeling the same sensation rushing through him like when he first found out that John considered him his best friend. Only this time it was even bigger, even better. John still stared into his eyes when Sherlock finally replied.
“There was a bomb, we switched it off. I’ll tell you the rest tomorrow,” Sherlock replies, already halfway out of the carriage.
How is this possible?
“Yes, it did.” Sherlock said and very carefully took John’s left hand from across the table. “You see?”
Sherlock looks hopelessly, desperately at the only person he’s ever loved.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, but John couldn’t tell whether it was because he actually tried to read his face or because he regretted his earlier choice of words.
“It’s Wayne Dyer,” Sherlock replied.
“We should go to the zoo, soon. You two have apparently forgotten what a bear looks like.”
“Any idea who they are, this underground network? Al-Quaeda; the IRA have been getting restless again. Maybe they’re gonna make an appearance…”
John jogs up the stairs and opens the living room door, but Sherlock is nowhere to be seen.
Sherlock, already on his way, throws the blanket into one of the police cars. Once he’s reached John, however, he doesn’t know what to say. His heart is beating a little faster, but he blames it on the shock.
“Y... yes of course. But John…?” Sherlock stutters.
“Mary, please. Can you put that down for a sec?”
“I don’t recall you ever being afraid, John.”
“Because today’s Valentine’s Day, Sherlock.”
Being married to Sherlock Holmes was less awkward than John would have expected.
It’s already quite late when Sherlock and I take a seat at the kitchen table. Mary is fast asleep and I feel the need to yawn a couple of times, too. I don’t really know why Sherlock took my offer to stay for a cup of tea, since he’s not usually the sociable type. For a second I even wonder whether he remembers today’s date, but I’m not sure. We drink the tea and talk about the video that stopped Sherlock’s suicide mission. Even though Sherlock is certain that Moriarty is dead, I’m not so sure. The bastard was always equal to him, in some ways. If Sherlock Holmes is able to fake his own death, so is Jim Moriarty. Of course I’m more than glad for the video, as it turned out that Sherlock had meant to say goodbye to me on that tarmac for real this time. I didn’t know it back then, otherwise I would’ve pulled him out of that plane immediately, or jumped in with him.
Sherlock looks up into John’s deep blue eyes and continues. “I vowed to have the patience that love demands, to speak when words are needed and to share the silence when they are not, to agree to disagree on your choice of jumpers, and to love and protect you until the end of time.”
His dark blue eyes are piercing into Sherlock’s now. He’s sincere, that much Sherlock can tell. A thousand questions are swirling in his head, but Sherlock seems to have lost the ability to speak. Is this really happening? Does John really want to come back to him?
Sherlock suppresses a smile before continuing. “I’ve never thought about that, but repeating everything out loud does make it seem so. Does anything up to this point sound familiar?”
Something about the situation seems wrong. It's a slight detail that doesn’t reveal itself to Sherlock yet. He thinks about the case, but there is practically no chance that he won’t solve it tomorrow. The solution has to be quite simple. He goes through the details in his mind, trying not to fall asleep as he grows more and more tired. John’s steady breath adds to Sherlock’s tiredness. John, who is lying next to him. Asleep. In a muscle shirt. John. His last thought before drifting off is that John never falls asleep so quickly, because he usually struggles with the anticipation of a nightmare.
Only then did John notice that the two of them were all dressed-up, Rosie in a lovely red and white dress and Sherlock in a black suit and a dark grey shirt.
“No. I just don’t know what to do anymore, John. We’ve tried everything! If your memories don’t return this year, they probably never will. And the guilt is killing me, it’s my fault and I’m so, so sorry for causing all of this.”
Sherlock places the violin back in its case before sitting down. He takes the whiskey in hand and raises an eyebrow at the already half empty bottle. John must’ve been drinking unconsciously while listening. His head feels slightly dizzy at the realisation.
The frustration of the last months is suddenly back. All John did day in day out for the last six months was wishing for their reunion, and yet here Sherlock is telling him he wouldn’t have returned at all if it wasn’t for a potential terrorist attack. It doesn’t make any sense, but maybe Sherlock’s feelings subsided over time. Maybe he’s over John.
“Uuuuh, John. Wake up!”
“Mr. Archer, at the count of three, shoot Dr. Watson.”
“Believe me, I wasn’t just doing this for you. I have a reputation to lose and I can’t be seen in public with you looking like a man stuck in the eighties.”
“Yeah.”
I open my eyes slowly. The light streaming in through the window is painfully glaring. I feel the weight of an arm on my waist and try to shift as calmly as possible in order to keep the person attached to said arm from waking up. As I try to get up silently, I hear Mary sighing and turning around. Her back is facing me now, but I know she just woke up as well.
Upstairs, I take Rosie from Sherlock’s arms and ask her about her day. She hasn’t really uttered words yet, apart from the occasional ‘da’. It probably has to do with the loss of her mother. I always see Mary in her, she looks so much like her mother. And she’s not even going to remember her. I feel my throat tighten at the thought of it, and try to think of something else to distract myself. These feelings are never going to go away, just as the guilt of the text affair and everything that went wrong in our marriage is never going to go away. I cannot change what I did in the past, all I can do is try to be better in the future.
“Yes. I had already made a vow before once and had called it my first and last one, but it turned out that I was wrong, which I never am – ”
“I brought booze,” he adds and shows Sherlock the whiskey bottle in his bag. It’s a sad attempt at drowning his problems in alcohol. His sister would be proud of him, John thinks. The whole issue is that Mary made up her mind too late. Had she told him that the thought of him and Sherlock together made her uncomfortable after a couple of weeks, he would’ve understood. He was surprised by her openness towards their friendship, anyway. She even encouraged him to spend time with Sherlock when John still felt too guilty. So why did she change her mind now, when Sherlock already took a spot in John’s heart, when not seeing him anymore just isn’t an option? Why does she try to forbid their contact now that they’re such good friends? What made her change her mind?
He looks up at Sherlock again, after staring at the table for the last ten minutes. Sherlock fights the urge to lean forward and embrace John with all his strength. The hound, Henry Knight, Sherlock’s panic attack, Baskerville, none of these things matter anymore.
He always knew that love was a dangerous disadvantage; a chemical defect found on the losing side. Now he had the final proof.
“Yes,” John says, suddenly recognising the man’s face.
“What does this mean? For you, I mean.”
“Isn’t that a bit fast for a definite judgment?” Sherlock hears John asking. He needs to smile. In this way, John has always been the same.
The first time I came around was a week after his birthday. He had visited the day before telling me that he had cleaned and baby-proofed the flat completely. Rosie had been at Baker Street before, but after Sherlock had had his break-down and had turned the kitchen into a meth lab and the living room into a collection of newspaper articles, I was reluctant to visit him. Now it feels almost normal to place Rosie into the highchair at 221B and watch Sherlock play with her.
He remembers how beautiful John looked in his black tuxedo that day, a warm autumn day in early September. How John held his hand in the garden of the beekeeping club; their closest family and friends surrounding them. How he slid the golden wedding band onto his ring finger. How John smiled when their eyes met. How his blue eyes misted when Sherlock played this song. How John kissed him afterwards and how Sherlock wished to be able to live in that moment forever.
She pushes herself up onto her elbow and turns on the yellow lamp on her night stand. Her hair is sticking out messily and her eyes are still small from sleeping, but she smiles at John and leans forward to give him a quick kiss nonetheless. It’s then that John realises he needs to tell her. She’d find out sooner or later, anyway.
“I did. I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for,” he says while putting on his coat. “Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t a difficult leap.”
“The fingerprints are definitely on the buttons 3, 4 and 7.” Suddenly the slight smile on his face disappears and he looks up as if just remembering something very important yet disappointing, which he probably does.
Half an hour later, after the medical tests, John has calmed down enough for Sherlock and Dr. Molder (who told Sherlock that he had already introduced himself three days ago) to enter his room again. Sherlock called Mycroft to inform him about John’s state, and asked him to inform everyone else. He can’t deal with that right now. The room is humid and hot, but the window is open enough to let in a warm summer breeze. John is still lying in his bed, brows furrowed and arms crossed, looking up at Sherlock and the doctor expectantly.
John realises that Sherlock might be a bit tipsy, too. They decide to sit down on a small step leading down from the chimney and wait for the New Year to begin. From their position, they have a clear view over the London sky. They keep talking quietly, their breaths mingling in the winter air, filling it with the smell of smoky, peat whiskey. The noises from the street underneath are still audible.
“Why would it be weird? We go out for dinner all the time.”
John knows exactly what she’s talking about. He takes her hand and stares at the bed sheets for a moment, not sure if telling his wife about his bond to another person is a good idea.
The steak is delicious, and John enjoys himself more than he likes to admit. Spending time with Sherlock is natural. He doesn’t have to pretend to be someone else; or only show his best side. Sherlock is the only person who truly knows him – his good and his bad side. And, more importantly, who likes him in spite of it.
“I know. Sorry I was just thinking about Mary.”
“We need bomb disposal,” John says. His face is white as a sheet and Sherlock silently curses himself for not sending John off with Lestrade.
She seems genuinely happy. I sigh. “Yeah, I know. I’m really getting better,” I say, wishing I could believe it. “Thanks for the call, we should meet soon.”
Now they’re standing at the crime scene, in the garden behind the house of the victim Jack Downing. The body has already been taken to the morgue, where the examination determined the cause of death: drowning.
defrocked. Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”
“What, why?”
“Well, Sherlock. I don’t recall you telling me what you do?”
“I thought our anniversary was in January.”
But that isn’t true.
“Goodnight, John.”
“Yes.”
“Wow.  This baby will have everything she needs, won’t she?”
“That our client is Finn Saltire?” He must notice Sherlock’s look of confusion as he adds: “The famous baseball player?”
“I got shot,” I say. It’s as simple as that, I guess.
The universe is a funny thing, he thinks while watching Sherlock slowly drift off. You meet thousands of people and none of them really touch you. And then you meet one person who touches your soul and changes everything.
Of a moment
Sherlock is lying on his back, with the scarf wrapped tightly around his neck, but he sits up straight when he sees the tray in John’s hands.
Slowly they fell into their own rhythm and John found that he didn’t have to look at his feet in order to get the steps right. Sherlock was guiding him with his large hand on John’s back; and John remembered how Sherlock had once admitted to him that he had always loved dancing. There was a spark in his eyes that John rarely witnessed, something similar to when he played the violin.
“Good.”
“Why?”
A couple of hours later Sherlock and I look at our result. I’m quite impressed with what we managed to put together in one afternoon. The white crib is standing on the right side of the room (with the mattress, waterproof cover and sheets), and the bookshelf next to the window fits perfectly into the room. We decided to bring the bouncy chair downstairs, as Sherlock suggested we were most likely to use it there, and placed the baby monitor on a small shelf next to the crib. The nursery looks rather nice.
the winning side.
John licks his lips when Sherlock’s stare wanders towards them. His heart is beating frantically in his chest. He slowly tilts his head forward and closes his eyes.
“Somehow we always end up together on this day,” I say.
For a moment, the two of them stare at each other, then simultaneously start smiling.
If he thinks back to the last couple of months, he knows that his relationship with Mary hasn’t been at its best. They have been spending less and less time together; neither really caring about the other’s activities – except for John’s time spent with Sherlock. But it had all started before meeting Sherlock, hadn’t it? After only two years of marriage, they managed to drift into a dull routine of co-existence, without as much as a ten minute conversation per day. They lived a life more like siblings than partners. Somehow John had always considered their behaviour normal; like any married couple behaved after the initial phase of infatuation.
With that, I slam the door and rush outside, leaving a sulking Sherlock behind.
“Seven so far.”
“Well, as you know I’m a consulting detective and therefore I’m interested in forensics, chemistry, biology and deductions, obviously.” He bites in his toast to buy himself some time to think of something interesting to tell John. “Of course my main area of interest in the last decade has been the study of John Watson,” he adds.
“Hey,” John says, and then there’s an awkward silence between them. He doesn’t know where to begin. Should he just confess everything? Tell her what a horrible husband he’s been? Or should he begin by mentioning their issues, without bringing Sherlock into the conversation just yet?
“So we’ve basically got a date with the murderer?”
“It means that I’m finally doing what I should have a long time ago.”
They are interrupted by the door flying open to reveal Greg. John stares at him angrily, but the detective seems out of breath, carrying a laptop under his arm and unaware that he’s interrupting an important conversation.
Back at home, something feels different. There’s a sort of electricity in the atmosphere that hasn’t been there in the last two months. Sherlock wonders if John can feel it, too. Maybe it’s just the fact that they’ve finally done something other than eating and talking. Of course such a minor case doesn’t compare to the thrill of the chase, but it’s a start. The way John looked at him during the deduction makes Sherlock’s stomach swirl.
“I, I gotta go. I gotta go to Mary,” John manages to get out, opening his eyes to see the expression of shock and confusion on Sherlock’s face before he manages to conceal it.
To slow down;
“I’m so sorry, John. I - I can deal with it, okay? Just forget it, please.”
“Why would you think that?”
“Well, if you’ve heard it all before, you probably know that you should get some sleep. It won’t be any help to your husband for you to stay here all the time and refuse nutrition and rest.”
John sighed. “I don’t know, Rosie. It’s quite late already and it’s raining.” He could see Rosie’s shoulders sagging down.
“I can tell,” John replies with a smirk. “Fine, I’ll take care of you for a while, but then I need to get back home.”
“So, Rosie finally popped the big question?” Sherlock asked when John entered the living room half an hour later. He was sat in his chair, looking up from
“Bloody hell. How much did I drink?” John asks, rubbing his hands through his face.
“What are you doing?”
“I didn’t know how. I wanted to wait until you remembered, but now I know that you might never gain your memories back; and that’s okay, because you’re still my John; but I needed to tell you. I’m sorry.”
Mrs. Hudson is in the flat, Sherlock distantly notices. She’s talking to him about her latest book club meeting or something similarly tedious, he’s stopped paying attention. He knows she’s mostly here to keep an eye on him.
“And why is that?” he manages to get out.
“Boring,” he replies. I raise my eyebrows in disbelief. “And I’ve got more important things to do,” Sherlock adds. He gives me a long look, which I do not know how to interpret, and suddenly stands up.
It is sweet and innocent at first, just light pressing of lips against one another again and again, until John opens his mouth and deepens the kiss. Sherlock takes the back of John’s hair in his hand and feels John carefully touching the side of his face. When their tongues slide against each other it feels glorious; and Sherlock can’t believe he managed to survive without kissing John for so long. John slightly groans and Sherlock pulls him even closer.
I get ready for work and hear Rosie’s cries again exactly one hour after putting her back to bed. I pick her up from the crib once again, change her nappy and dress her for the day. It’s quite cold outside, so I decide to put her into one of the tiny jumpers she got from Mrs Hudson for Christmas. It looks adorable on her and the colour accentuates her deep blue eyes.
“Thanks, mates! I think I can make good use of it,” he replied eyeing Sherlock, who grinned briefly and then turned to Rosie. “Do you want to play in the bouncy castle with the other children?”
Sherlock’s expression turns into a smitten smile for a second, before he focusses his attention back on my cock. He moves faster now, and after an embarrassingly short amount of time I can feel an orgasm building up inside me. My fingers grasp the cushions next to me and I can hear embarrassing sounds escaping my mouth involuntarily.
“Shut up and go to sleep, Sherlock.” John feels a kiss being pressed to his head, and falls asleep with a smile on his face.
When John returned from work late that day, he was tired and a bit grumpy. He had had a number of annoying patients who had tried to explain John’s job to him with the help of Doctor Google. Oh how John loathed that doctor.
I exhale a breath I didn’t realise I was holding. I should probably feel jealous, but I don’t. If anyone apart from me has been like a father to Rosie, it’s Sherlock. He’s been with her on her birthday, when she was sick, on Christmas, when she couldn’t sleep at night and when she needed a companion to play with during the day. The truth is, Rosie probably won’t remember Mary. I try to keep her mother in her memory, but childhood amnesia makes it difficult. Sherlock, on the other hand, is going to be there for Rosie for the rest of her life.
. The officer with a dubious professional past admitted, after giving Sherlock a long look, that they had found Thomas’ school cap in the woods, close to the local inn. This of course was no news to Sherlock, as he had already suspected that the kidnapper would take the boy cross-country to distance himself from curious eyes.
“John, if only you knew how utterly wrong you are.”
John doesn’t even remember falling asleep. He wakes up half atop of Sherlock, his head draped against Sherlock’s neck. His curls are tingling John’s cheek, so he props his head up to look at the man underneath him. Sherlock seems to have been awake for some time. John feels a wave of happiness – unsure whether it’s Sherlock’s or his own – flooding him, but he doesn’t care. This time he allows himself to drown in it.
“Ha-ha. That’s not funny,” John said giggling.
wedding band, but he couldn’t help it. Soon it was all going to be over. He had had his chance, and he had messed it up. Now that he knew that John didn’t love him the way he did, it was time to move on. The thought of believing that he could made Sherlock almost snort.
He can’t believe this arrogant git, risking his life again and again without saying a word. John feels like throwing up when he thinks about what could have happened to Sherlock.
John starts to giggle, because the amount of people assuming them to be a couple is getting ridiculous.
“Oh, it’s hard to remember an alias when you’ve had a fright, isn’t it?”
“You’d do anything, anything at all to stop being bored,” the man continues.
He looks up briefly to see the round face in front of him reddening. Whether it’s because of anger or embarrassment, Sherlock can’t tell. It’s not like he doesn’t like Stamford – on the contrary – he considers him one of the least annoying professors at Bart’s, but being rude to the wrong people has always been one of Sherlock’s strong suits.
“Sherlock? If you want, we can wait and take things slow.”
“Er, I think we both like Katherine.”
Sherlock seems pleased.
“I do, usually, but today we’re having a case, and Mary and I agreed to never bring her to cases.” Saying her name out loud still hurts. I clear my throat.
Sherlock reaches for the remote and turns on the small TV that hangs up on the wall on the opposite side of the room. From their current angle, they can’t see anything, so he decides to lay back on his side of the bedstead. John follows his example and lies down close to him. Their arms are almost touching. Sherlock flaps through the programme until he finds some boring TV show he knows John loves. It involves baking.
When she’s back asleep, I place her back in the crib and leave the nursery as quietly as possible. From experience I estimate for her to remain asleep for about an hour. I go downstairs, too distracted to get back to bed, and make myself some coffee. Today is Friday, so I only have to work until 1 o’clock at the clinic. I started going back simply because I need the money. I’ve managed to get a babysitter for Rosie who watches her when I’m not here. I don’t want her to go to kindergarten so soon, and I feel like the time with a woman is good for her. It’s not like anyone could replace Mary, but it’s better than nothing.
“She’s in the bouncy chair, but she needs to be put to bed.”
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine,” Sherlock hears himself say.
“You really shouldn’t have spent your money on me,” John replied angrily, but it was more mock-anger than anything serious.
Sherlock enters the kitchen seconds later. “Well, that was close.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and continued. “There are so many words I wish to say to you now, but what I truly long to say first is this: Will you marry me?”
John smiled and pointed at his ring finger. “I wanted to take it off yesterday, but then I read the engraving and I finally knew that you felt the same.”
The moment their hands touch, everything happens at once. John feels a tingling in his wrist slowly spreading through his whole body. Once it reaches his heart, John is certain that it will jump out of his chest. His heart is suddenly filled with an ocean of emotions he doesn’t yet realise aren’t only his. His phone drops to the floor. For a moment he’s sure to hear Sherlock’s heartbeat as clearly as his own, beating in the exact same rhythm. He turns towards Sherlock and looks up at him; into his light, green eyes, and he doesn’t see anything else. There’s a bond growing between them, stronger and more intimate than anything John has ever felt.
“We kiss each other,” Sherlock said, “just not in front of you.” He touched Rosie’s tiny nose with one of his fingers and left an orange dot there.
“No, you’re not fine. What were you thinking?!”
“I know this must be very hard for you, but Dr. Watson doesn’t remember you at the moment. He doesn’t seem to remember anything after his return from the war back in 2010, where he got injured as well. This is probably just a temporary case of retrograde amnesia, but a calming environment is crucial for your husband’s recovery.”
Eventually, they are interrupted by Lestrade, who’s suddenly standing next to them and coughing loudly.
“He has killed four people,” Sherlock replies.
There’s a brief stab of guilt somewhere in Sherlock’s abdomen. He already forgot about the presentation in light of his more interesting, officially-not-his-case case. “Thank you, I think I can get good use out of it.”
“Oh, that’s fine. I wanted to spend the evening finishing my book, anyway.”
“Sure. We wouldn’t have been able to do it all just now.” I look around and feel pleased with myself. The changing table is already placed in the left corner of the room, stuffed with a ton of diapering supplies, the smoke detector hangs on the sealing, the dresser is set up next to the changing table and the electric outlet covers are already applied. “But don’t worry, there’s still lots of work to do. We need to put up the crib and the bookshelf and we can arrange the bouncy seat and the baby monitor.”
“Very good, John. Brilliant deduction.”
“But can’t you just hand it to Mycroft and let him deal with it?” I know right away that that was probably the wrong suggestion. I just want the phone out of the flat, I add mentally.
“ Wait a second, so we were still in contact with her?”
“John, I need to tell you something before we continue. You should know that I...” he takes a deep breath. “That the accident – it was my fault.”
The reply comes at once.
“Sherlock?”
They started drinking and – for lack of better things to think of – played Cluedo. John won three times in a row which leaved Sherlock sulking. When he finally admitted that the victim had not actually committed suicide, they were both quite tipsy already.
“You think I’ve got ‘How to defuse a bomb’ tucked away in there somewhere?”
For a second, I see something in his eyes that could be hurt.
“Is everything alright? Are you in pain?” he gasps, looking John up and down and searching for any signal of pain.
need time to think!”
Her face brightens slightly. “Oh, hello, darling!”
“Listen, I really don’t mind if people think you’re Rosie’s dad.”
The voice cuts through the quiet air like a blade, and John’s knees turn weak at the deep baritone he’d recognise under a thousand.
“My heart is not – what’s that even supposed to mean?!”
“Come on, who’d want me for a flatmate?” I smile slightly to cover up the sad truth that lies beneath my statement. I’m not the type of person many people would want to share a flat with. I can’t even resent them. I don’t think I would want me as a flatmate, either.
Rosie turned to John, who nodded briefly.
John wanted to object but made up his mind and thanked Sherlock for getting the rings, instead. When Sherlock went upstairs to wake Rosie for breakfast, John used the time to stare at his left hand. He hadn’t worn a wedding band since taking his off almost two years ago. The guilt he had felt whenever he had looked at his hand had nearly made him lose his mind. The guilt of taking it off was even worse but then Sherlock had deposited the ring onto the mantelpiece next to a framed picture of Mary, Rosie and John and John’s guilt had started to fade.
“Do you have any plans for today?” he asks.
After spending the rest of the day watching crap telly and laughing at Sherlock’s deductions of the talk show guests’ private habits, Sherlock gets up from his chair and informs me that we’ll leave at 8 o’clock. While I’m still thinking about what he means by that, my flatmate disappears into his bedroom and closes the door behind him. A look at my watch tells me that it’s already 7:30. So we are going out for dinner after all. Maybe to keep the charade up for Lestrade, although I highly doubt that he’s watching us. Maybe Sherlock just realised he was hungry after inventing the excuse in the first place. Or maybe, just maybe, a tiny voice whispers in the far back of my head, he really just wants to go out for dinner with me.  Just in case my latter assumption proves to be correct, I head up to my room to get changed into something a bit less comfortable and more physically appealing.
“Look at those cheekbones. I could cut myself slapping that face. Would you like me to try?” Miss Adler narrows her eyes down at him before taking the white collar to her mouth and biting down onto its edges. Her red lipstick leaves a print on the fabric. Sherlock stares at her in confusion until he sees John in the corner of his eyes.
What?! “Sorry, what?”
“I had it all... under control,” Sherlock replies, ripping him out of his trance.
“I know,” she sighed.
The knowledge of John’s love for him threatens to overwhelm Sherlock, but then John brings up a hand to his face and that’s all Sherlock can focus on. They kiss and kiss and kiss, and it’s better than Sherlock could have ever imagined.
John saved their lives, again.
Finding your soulmate is something most people longed for growing-up in John’s infancy, making it specifically hard for young teenage boys to encounter a meaningless love-affair. John grew up with only a few persons in his immediate environment – neither his parents nor his grandparents were soulmates – and he didn’t feel like he was missing out. By the time he joined the army, the Western world’s perception of love had already changed significantly. Less and less people found their significant others, leaving them lonely and depressed until they decided to screw the universe and find someone suitable off their own bat. Trying to stop a major wave of depression, the government finally declared that two people who aren’t soulmates can get married without the previously obligatory psychological consultancy, basing their change in course on a scientific study from 1986. The new law caused a flood of marriages between non-persons who finally found the convincing reason to unite in spite of not being told so by the universe. After that, cases of soulmates kept getting rarer and rarer, despite the efforts of several “old-fashioned” online dating sites proclaiming to be able to find your person within fourty-eight hours.
“I missed you,” John adds.
They stare at their shadows on the cover for a while, both lost in their own thoughts. Mary rubs her hands through her face, and John can’t shake the feeling that he didn’t say everything he wanted to, needed to.
“So I guess you’re stuck with me after all,” he adds.
“No. I don’t even think I have one,” Sherlock admits.
“What are you doing at Baker Street?” Sherlock asks, and then, when John doesn’t reply, “Are you mad at me for returning?”
Sherlock thinks, really thinks, and blurts out the only reasonable idea he has. He’d be damned if he let John Watson die in this tube carriage with him.
“Take-out seems reasonable. There’s a Chinese restaurant around the corner whose owner still owes me a favour.”
When Sherlock doesn’t reply, John continues. “I said before that I’ve never met someone like you. And it’s true. You’re rude to strangers, you never do the dishes, you keep human fingers in the fridge, you’re probably mad, and you’re absolutely brilliant. You’re honest and kind, incredibly intelligent and frustratingly attractive. You’re like a drug. I don’t know whether my memories will ever return. I don’t know whether I’ll ever know how I proposed to you, or how we danced at our wedding. But I do know that I want to be with you.”
No matter the British weather, somehow there was always an occasion to go to the park, or someplace similar. After a couple of days John noticed that Sherlock had stopped insisting on taking cabs for everything farther away than the usual three-kilometre radius. He figured Sherlock must have seen the happiness on Rosie’s face, as well, and was therefore eager to make her happy for as long as the month lasted.
They start to giggle simultaneously.
“I had a tea, too, at the Palace. If anyone’s interested,” John says into the silence. If Sherlock didn’t know any better, he could’ve sworn to hear a fraction of jealousy in John’s voice. He dismisses the thought immediately.
“Can you fetch me my scarf, please?” Sherlock asks.
“Do you think that’s a good idea?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before, it had been easier to ignore his feelings for Sherlock, but now things were different. Now he knew what it felt like to kiss Sherlock. Now he knew that Sherlock most definitely knew about his feelings. Now he had seen a glimpse of the only thing that had been missing in the otherwise perfect, happy little bubble the three of them had created at 221B.
“Sherlock?” I knock on his door.
“Hello, Mr. Holmes.”
“It’s a day invented by sellers in order to give consumers another reason to spend their money on tedious things they are likely to throw out afterwards.”
“Do you have any idea how hard this is for me? One day I come back from the war in 2010 and the next day I’m married to a man I don’t even know and it’s ten years later. I’ve missed a decade of my life, Sherlock! I was married to someone who’s dead and who I can’t even grief because I don’t remember her! I lost a child I don’t even remember having in the first place! And that’s not even it; I also feel guilty towards you all the time. I know what I said earlier, and I mean it, I really am thankful for your patience; but don’t you think I realise that you’d rather be with the old version of me?! That you’re upset with me for not remembering you?” John is now screaming.
“I don’t need your advice on human interaction. And you and me are not alike,” Sherlock lets the last plosive pop for emphasis.
And live in that forest
“I’m… sorry, John. So sorry,” he stumbles.
“Oh John… oh god… John,” Sherlock nearly screams.
Dragging Sherlock along, John heads towards the tracks. Luckily the train arrives just in time. They sit down in an empty cabin that reminds John a lot of the Hogwarts Express.
“Er, honey, you know we talked about this, right? Sherlock and I are your parents, but we’re not… like other parents. We’re not –”
This Monday was the first day of John’s two week vacation he had been looking forward to for ages. They hadn’t booked a holiday because John simply wanted to enjoy the time at home with his family, catch up with some friends and finally finish the book he’d been reading since February. Sherlock had insisted on not taking on any cases because he wanted it to be a holiday for the three of them. He had even managed to take Rosie out of kindergarten.
“Wait a second, I got married twice?! My wife passed away? When did that happen?” John asks. There is pure horror on his face. Sherlock briefly thinks about jumping out of the window. How is he supposed to tell John all about Mary and their baby? How is John supposed to believe him any of it?
Mike seems to laugh at that. So he thinks it’s funny, too. “What?”
Sherlock quickens his steps and tightens the grip on John’s hand. He ignores the surprised faces of the officers outside, relishing the feeling of being John’s sole focus of attention, instead. They hurry back through the tunnels.
“Sorry, what?” I try one last time.
“You look much better, Mr. Saltire. Is there something you’d like to tell us?” Sherlock asks, trying his best to hide his own happiness.
“No,” Sherlock replies quickly. He walks back into the living room and takes a seat in his chair, then points the violin bow to the empty chair opposite of him.
“Rosie!” John said. His voice sounded squeaky, so he cleared his throat before continuing. “What’s going on?”
silence, but one where words simply aren’t necessary. John has gone silent, too. They only look at each other, both in their own thoughts. It’s something they have done before, but never for an extended period of time, Sherlock realises. He carefully studies John’s features. His blue eyes, the tiny wrinkles around them and his greyish hair. He then risks to look at his lips, no longer able to refuse. John licks his lips, and it seems almost like an invitation.
“I thought it was written across my face,” John said, gesturing towards his features. “Read it.”
“What was what about?”
“… the bed is more comfortable than I thought.”
“There’s one more thing we need to talk about. Could you imagine yourself sharing your bed with me?” I raise an eyebrow. Maybe it’s too soon for that.
“So you’ll have to make a speech, of course,” I say, trying to release the tension of the conversation a bit.
John blinks and gets up from his chair. He picks up the present from underneath the tree, sits back down and hands it to Sherlock. Sherlock carefully undoes the bow and removes the wrapping paper, feeling John’s eyes fixed on him.
“What’s the matter?”
My heart skips a beat at the sound of his name.
“Because you’re an idiot.”
“When I was younger my mum used to take me and Harry to local farms during holidays, we were too broke to go anywhere else.” John shrugs his shoulders.
“Good morning, John. How did you sleep?”
“No!” she protested.
Sherlock doesn’t respond for a very long time. He keeps his eyes on John, who has apparently closed his own, and thinks. He listens to John’s steady breathing. When he finally whispers “Goodnight, John.” John is already asleep.
“I seem to have misinterpreted someone’s feelings for me and now I’m unsure how to proceed. As you know, I usually never miscalculate,” he finally says.
“Oh… as you wish.”
“There’s nothing I’d rather do.”
Sherlock clears his throat. “It’s quite... effective.”
“And what if we don’t? Please save yourself and me the time and your standard optimistic responses for your other patients and be honest with me. What are the exact chances of his recovery? What can I do to help him remember? When should we consider his amnesia a permanent state?” Sherlock narrows his eyes at the doctor, anger crawling up inside him.
Hatty Simon shifts uncomfortably from one foot to the other and I can tell that she thinks about shutting the door in front of us. Before she has the chance, I intervene.
“I don’t think that’s true. And even if it was, I can assure you that I do. I actually never thought that you’d want this. You know, being married to your work and all that.”
“Could you maybe...?” He starts. Sherlock needs a minute to register what he’s asking him to do. He feels a stab in his heart, but tries to smile at John, nods, and leaves the room.
“Me? What were you... thinking? I was doing fine!” Sherlock replies angrily.
going to die and that John just told him that he loves him six times and that everything Sherlock ever wanted is right in front of him.
“You really shouldn’t worry too much, Mr. Watson, I’m sure it’ll all come back to him soon,” he adds.
Sherlock’s green eyes find his again. “I thought the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee. I wasn’t to know that you’d already been exposed to the gas previously, so I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.”
“Thank you, Sherlock. I was afraid to ask you for it, and I’m glad I have it back. It’s the perfect gift.” He looks up at Sherlock and smiles.
He can see John swallow hard at the confession. “I’m sorry, this is just all so overwhelming.”
“Your deodorant told me that. It’s for men.”
He turns his head in order to feel Sherlock’s lips on his again, and in that moment he’s sure he’s never really had sex before, because it has never felt like this; like his whole body is about to explode.
Sherlock gives me a curious look – I must’ve been staring at his penis for longer than considered appropriate. I clear my throat and focus my attention back to his face.
Once they’ve reached the metal giant, Miller forcefully pushes Sherlock up the tiny stairs. With his feet still tied together, Sherlock practically has to jump up each step, which hurts like hell. The tight grip on Sherlock’s arm doesn’t help, either. Closer now, Sherlock can hear the rushing sound of water filling up inside. Once they are on top of the tank, Miller opens the heavy screw to reveal a flood of water. The entrance is small enough for a single person and Sherlock desperately tries to think of a way to push Miller inside, who still has him in his grip.
“Er, yes, I’m sorry, Sherlock,” the doctor stammers. “I’ll be gone in a minute. You see, I’m meeting an old friend of mine, whom I haven’t seen in ages, but...”
“Hang on, Sherlock. Isn’t that live?”
“Tea?” Sherlock asks, offering me the mug on the kitchen table. I politely decline the offer and sit down. Okay, I can do this.
How preposterous.
They spend the remaining time in companionable silence, John watching television and Sherlock reading a scientific article on urban bee-keeping; an attempt to calm himself. He still can’t help enjoying this flicker of domesticity. It feels comfortable; it feels right for John to be here. The cruel laws of nature make time fly by, and after what feels like a couple of minutes, Mrs. Hudson announces Mary’s arrival. She’s wearing a red coat, her cheeks flushed from the cold outside. She walks into the living room to give John a quick kiss while Sherlock tries to look away. She then walks over to him and awkwardly shakes his hand.
“Really? Do you want to… come along?”
On my way back, I think about the fight Sherlock and I just had. It wasn’t really a fight, only me being frustrated and screaming at him. Why does he think that I care about what people think? As far as I’m concerned, I don’t give a flying fuck if people mistake us for a couple. Well…
“I’m trying to make the fingerprints visible on the buttons she used the most.”
John rolls his eyes.
“Yeah, er, I dunno. Would you mind? Just for tonight?” John replies. He’s probably feeling guilty, even though there’s no need to. This whole nightmare is all Sherlock’s fault. He’d be damned if he doesn’t do everything in his power to make the situation as comfortable as possible for John.
“Do you think you’re gonna solve the case tomorrow?” John asks.
Sherlock knows that he would love it here. If he hadn’t made that fatal mistake all those months ago, maybe they could’ve come here together sometime. They could’ve gone for a hike in the mountains or for a trip to Salzburg, Mozart’s place of birth. But it probably would have happened anyway, because Sherlock doesn’t know for how long he would’ve been able to keep up the façade. At this – what others might call – romantic hotel, far away from home, he isn’t sure what further damage he might have done.
“Look, Sherlock, I hope you understand that this, er, thing between us isn’t easy for me. I’m a married man and I haven’t even told my wife what happened the other day. I think it’s best if we don’t see each other again and forget about the whole thing. But an hour ago I was on my way back from work when I suddenly felt –“.
Sherlock waves his hands dismissively. “Well, I was grocery shopping and they were a special offer.”
Now, they’re on their way back to the Inn. Despite all the events taking place in the last hour, John hasn’t forgotten the incident at the lab earlier. He’s still pissed, to say the least. Once they arrive back at the hotel, he storms out of the car, leaving Sherlock to pay the ride for once. It has gotten too late for the Inn to still be open, so John fishes for the front door keys in his pockets. The yard is empty and quiet, and apart from a tiny street lamp there’s only the moon adding light to the scenery. After half a minute of unsuccessful searching, John can hear the car driving off into the distance and large footsteps approaching from behind.
John coughed abruptly in response.
“As long as it took for you to realise that our marriage is over,” she states matter-of-factly, the sadness from earlier completely removed from her eyes.
“Fine.”
“So, do I want to know how you found Hatty so quickly?”
Mike offers to buy us coffee-to-go and we sit down on a bench together. I think he suggested that because he saw my cane and didn’t want me to stand for too long. I don’t really like to be reduced to my limp, to be constantly reminded of my wounds from the war, but I’m sure he meant it as a nice gesture. An uncomfortable silence settles upon us. When you haven’t seen someone in so long, what do you talk about?
Sherlock shifts his weight from one foot to the other. He hasn’t heard of any similar occurrences, but then again he hasn’t really had a reason to research the whole soulmate topic. Until now.
“Nothing, eh, I was just looking for… you had a thing in your hair and I…” God, he sounds less convincing than the last murderer he had caught in the act.
“Oh for god’s sake, don’t you have your minions to help you out, Mycroft?”
“Sherlock.” Still no answer. He seems frozen, the way he is staring motionlessly at me. “That’s getting a bit scary now,” I add after another couple of minutes.
This ring felt surprisingly comfortable on his finger, like it was meant to fill the void the gold one had left. John tried not to dwell on the implication of that for too long.
The air has gotten a bit chilly and Sherlock feels a goose bump crawling onto his arms. He mentally curses himself for not bringing his Belstaff..
With that, he takes his still unpacked luggage into one hand and his coat into the other, and slams the door shut.
John laughs. “I meant the composer.” His tongue feels thick in his mouth.
In the next couple of weeks, Sherlock tries everything in his power to make John remember. He shows him pictures of their wedding, makes John read his blog entries, visits Angelo’s and several other of their favourite restaurants with him, and even invites other people to come over and talk to John. It’s boring and tedious, having all these people (especially Mycroft) over that they usually only see every other month, and Sherlock keeps repeating to himself that it’s all for John. But while John’s physical wounds of the accident start to disappear, his psychological state doesn’t change.
Mary is still in her pajama, leaning against the kitchen counter and apparently chopping something in half. The sight of his wife, knowing that this is the last time he’ll be able to call her that, causes John’s stomach to sink to the floor. Mary barely looks up when he enters, murmuring a few words of welcome from her current position.
“No, Sherlock, forget it. I’m not climbing over there!”
“Mrs. Blanchard I can assure you that your son does not have yellow fever,” John sighs. He knows he comes across as rude, but he can’t help it. Somehow his patients have gotten a lot more annoying lately.
“Sorry?”
“If you and Papa are married, then why do you never kiss each other?”
“John,” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand into his own. “There are so many words I meant to say all those years ago, and I still do. You would not believe how many times I had to hold words inside this past month. I wanted to tell you that I loved you, that I never wanted the month to end, that meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me,” he paused, feeling his voice break. John looked at him encouragingly with nothing but love in his eyes.
“Thanks,” I say and place a kiss on Rosie’s head before heading upstairs.
“But Moran won’t be there. Not tonight,” John adds.
“What’s going on, guys?”
Sherlock clears his throat. “Nothing. It’s ... better,” he finally says.
“Sherlock, don’t.”
“We could go over the case again. Or you could help me solve a cold case from 1895. I’ve been working on it for weeks but there’s a small detail I seem to be missing.”
He nods towards his companions, who leave for John’s room.
“No, it’s scientific fact,” Sherlock says and I look over at him. His eyes are resting on Rosie. “I’ll go to bed then,” he adds.
Upon entering the Inn, the owner mistakes them for a couple – something John stopped caring about a long time ago – and hands John a set of keys. Whilst John investigates the foyer of the building, Sherlock is still outside chatting with one of the tourist guides. Wondering what the hell they’re talking about for so long, John decides to bring Sherlock a pint of beer to infer himself into the conversation. The tour guide claims to have seen the hound and, after a bit of convincing, shows them his piece of evidence, making John 50 pounds richer within minutes.
“I don’t know what you’re hinting at,” Sherlock has to admit.
“I don’t know,” John said. “It’s just… I mean, you forgot your brother’s birthday last year.”
Tiny raindrops fell down on John’s face and dripped from his fringe when he said: “Marry me, Sherlock.”
“I was not wrong! I’m never wrong. I miscalculated.”
“What about taste, thickness, salt content, amount of oil –“
“It’s just… I thought you were above these things,” John gestures into the air.
“Er, be my guest.” I walk over towards him and pull back a chair.
But she won’t take it. “Look, I really don’t want to get in between whatever it is you two are having. You clearly like him more than you admit. I’m sorry.”
“Yeah?”
John sighed and got started on the coffee, wondering whether to prepare a cup for Sherlock. When he placed a mug next to Sherlock a couple of minutes later, he was still being ignored.
“It vanishes between these two stations; Lord Moran vanishes the same day…” he stops, apparently having solved the puzzle. He turns towards John, ignoring Greg completely.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry but I need to leave. Mary’s already waiting for me.”
“Please, Sherlock, we need you!” He begs.
“Yes, of course. Why wouldn’t I?”
“It’s late; we should spend another night at the Inn and leave tomorrow morning,” said person says to him. John doesn’t respond.
“Oh yes, you did,” John said. He was smiling at their daughter. At Sherlock’s curious expression he added: “She helped me set this up.”
Slowly, he ascends the stairs until the voices become more distinct. He can hear Sherlock asking for him.
Upstairs, John knocks on the living room door, knowing that Sherlock tends to ignore any sounds similar to door bells, and waits for him to answer. A couple of seconds later, the door flies open. Sherlock is wearing his whine-coloured dressing gown – one of John’s favourites – and  has his violin tucked under his arm. He seems surprised to see John.
My heart skips a beat. I turn around to look at him. “Yes, of course I do. Thank you for dinner, Sherlock, I really enjoyed it.” Sherlock doesn’t reply for some time. I should probably turn around and go upstairs, but something is holding me back.
Without having the slightest idea of the word’s meaning, he quietly makes his way back to the trail; trying to keep track of Sherlock’s shadow. He cannot see their features anymore, only the tall figures of two men in the distance.
John feels Sherlock’s eyes on him for a second, and he can hear the shifting of his voice before he continues.
“Fine, what do you want to eat then?”
Sherlock let go of his hand to near one of the swings. The park was dead silent, and the rain kept pouring down on them. “Did you know that my mother never let me go on a swing after I’d broken my foot once?”
“I do.”
After feeding Rosie in the highchair Sherlock keeps at Baker Street, I realise that it’s gotten quite late. Rosie definitely needs to sleep. I close my eyes and touch the bridge of my nose thinking about going back outside and on the tube. We don’t even have a stroller, so I’ll have to carry her all the way to the station.
“John, really, there’s no need to thank me. You’re my husband; I promised to always be there for you and love you in good and bad times; and I intend to keep that promise.”
“Rosie, aren’t you old enough to walk down the stairs now?” John asked before loading up their plates with toast and scrambled eggs.
“Oh, Mike Stamford, I see. Well, he’s nice, although I’m not sure how well he’d cope with…”
In between all of the visitors and restaurants, Sherlock lets John get to know him again. They spend their days almost like they used to in between cases, expect they never touch and John doesn’t bicker with him. He doesn’t even complain about body parts in the fridge anymore. He seems too careful not to hurt Sherlock, or he simply doesn’t care at all. But never once has he taken his ring off. Sherlock still sleeps on the sofa, because he can’t bear to go up to John’s old room and transport himself back to 2010.
“Is this..?”
“It’s okay,” John interrupts him. Sherlock is puzzled.
When Sherlock wakes up the next morning, the other side of the bed is empty. For a moment he can’t hide his disappointment, but he hears the shower running in the small bathroom. When John enters the bedroom, his silvery hair is still damp from the shower. He smiles down at Sherlock.
I sigh. “Lestrade.”
Sherlock merely shrugged his shoulders.
“Unfortunately, I haven’t found advice on this issue on any parenting platform,” Sherlock replied and tapped the back of his phone thoughtfully.
After finishing their drinks, they make their ways to the upstairs floor, aiming for their adjacent hotel rooms. When turning the locker to his door, Sherlock can hear John clearing his throat.
Lestrade heads off into the opposite direction, leaving Sherlock to walk through the quiet tunnel with John. They have never been men of many words, sharing comfortable silences with each frequently, but this silence feels different. After not having seen John for so many months, Sherlock wants nothing more than to talk to him. He can hear John clearing his throat, a clear sign of his nervousness, but with a possible blow-up of the London Parliament and hundreds of people dying Sherlock doesn’t feel like it’s the right time to resume their argument.
John only manages a couple of nervous breaths, so Sherlock props up the panel against the wall of the train in order to examine it more closely. There’s a countdown clock momentarily frozen at 02:30, so there’s still some time left.
“Were you saying Finn Saltire?” John asks while getting out of Dr. Huxtable’s car.
“You probably don’t.”
“Excuse me, do we know each other?”
“I’ve always been able to keep myself distant… divorce myself from feelings.” Sherlock isn’t even sure what he’s talking about anymore. Is this still about fear? His hand continues to tremble.
“Yes, bee, I did. That was a shooting star.”
I can feel rather than see Sherlock’s eyes on me, and then realise that Hatty’s and my life have some weird similarities. I clear my throat and focus my attention back to Mr. Simon, who started crying again.
“She can, but not you and me. Harry, please, just admit it.”
John throws another jumper into his suitcase whilst humming the Coca-Cola Christmas jingle. He’s not sure why he’s in such a good mood – it might be because of the fabulous spring weather; it might be because he’s spending the weekend at Baskerville looking for a gigantic hound. He adds a scarf to the mess in his case and jogs down the stairs.
As I put the phone back into my coat, I hear the beeping sound of another message.
“Who?”
“No I think he knows exactly where. I’m not so sure about you.”
In the afternoon after my shift at the clinic, I decide to visit his grave. I haven’t been here since New Year’s Day. It’s very cold outside, so I take my green coat that I hate because it always reminds me of the one Moriarty put me in all those years ago. The graveyard isn’t too far from my apartment. I don’t bring any flowers, as there are usually some there whenever I come by. I assume they are from Mrs. Hudson, or Molly, or maybe even Mycroft. I haven’t seen either of these people since I moved out of Baker Street. I actually tried to phone Mrs. Hudson a couple of times last year, but she wasn’t at home when I did. After a while it got easier to just not pick up the phone at all. And who knows what Mycroft is up to? He was devastated the last time I saw him. No matter how much Sherlock would fight me for it, I know that the two brothers loved each other.
“Well, I don’t. But I know that you do.”
So how had it come this far?
He was my flatmate, my best friend, he gave me a reason to live in a time when I desperately needed one. Being with him healed me, but it was more than that.
I can’t help but stare at him. Does he really remember…?
“Listen, I was wondering –“
“Is everything alright?”
“Hang on, are you just calling to see if I’m still alive? Is it because of today’s date?!”
“Mmh. Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way?” John asks after a short pause.
“Sherlock, you’re not supposed to dig in my – never mind,” John said.
“I should probably start packing.”
“That’s a bloody lie! You’ve probably been sitting in this chair for hours!” He barks while throwing his hands up dramatically.
“Sure.”
“Does that mean you –?”
“What was what?”
“Hmm? It’s August the 20th,” he replies. The date has been on John’s mind for weeks, because whenever he turned on the news lately…
“Yes, bee, what is it?”
“What’s the matter? Do you want a try?” Sherlock asked, trying to stand up from the swing, but John was blocking his way. He shook his head but didn’t make an attempt to move.
“Well, yes of course. I like the dramatic touch of the location, don’t you agree?” He didn’t object to the name, so at least Sherlock knows who he’s dealing with.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
John nodded and was rewarded with a triumphant grin appearing on his friend’s face.
Apparently he still doesn’t know what to say, so I try to help him. “Yes.”
I can’t help but frown at my friend who’s currently trying to ‘catch’ Rosie with the teddy. Rosie crawls into my lap and I feel proud. She started crawling when she was six months old already. I take her in my lap and give her a kiss on the head.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to add to that. He’s spared any further questions once he catches sight of a yellow car approaching the opposite side of the road. He gives John a knowing look before he starts to wind his scarf back around his neck. John looks at him, then outside, then at him again.
“Eat this, it should make you feel better,” John says, placing the tray onto the small bedside table.
John nods. “Yeah, sure. I’ll do my best.”
“Sherlock, dear, are you there?” Oh god, that’s Mrs. Hudson. She must be bringing Rosie up. Rosie. Jesus Christ.
Miller takes him by surprise anyway, putting a well-fired gunshot through Sherlock’s right leg from behind that sends him to his knees. He grabs Sherlock by the head before stepping in front of him, painfully pulling on Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock tries to fight, to stand back up, but then Miller lunges forward and crashes his knee into Sherlock’s chest, which causes all air to escape his lungs. Sherlock distantly hears himself making embarrassing sounds of pain before he’s finally able to breathe again. H’s still on the floor, only managing to hold himself up on one hand. He lets out a groan and tries to free himself from Miller’s grip, but his legs still aren’t of any use. There’s a puddle of blood thickening underneath his limbs.
Upon entering my flat, I immediately hear Rosie crying from the kitchen. Alana is standing next to the highchair trying to feed my daughter without success. She looks relieved when she sees me.
“So, where are we heading?”
“Well, I don’t know, maybe, yeah, because you reacted like you were... It’s nothing to be ashamed of.” I try to make sense but I think I somehow make it worse, going by Sherlock’s look. Why can’t he just admit it? I can take this. Is he trying to spare my feelings?
“Oh yes, I’m fine, completely fine.”
“Right now?”
“John? I’m glad that your date decided to leave,” Sherlock says, interrupting John’s thought process.
“John? It was nice spending the day with you,” Sherlock quickly says.
“It means I can tell that you’re going through a rough time, both of you. Did anything happen yesterday?”
“Do you know what day it is today?”
John’s words, ever the brave soldier, putting other peoples’ lives above his own, makes Sherlock’s chest clench uncomfortably.
“Shall we leave?” He asks instead.
“Christ, Sherlock, I think I’ve made this pretty clear. Why, do you want to stop?”
his wife.
There was a long silence in which John felt his heart beat uncomfortably in his chest, and then he heard Sherlock’s deep voice. “And I’d probably kiss you back.”
The day John and Sherlock decided to get married was a cloudy, rainy day in spring. It had been raining continuously for the last couple of days, and the London atmosphere was as dark and depressed as it could’ve been. Sherlock and John had spent the day bickering about something tedious that Sherlock had already deleted when Greg came around asking for help on his latest case. He had been working on it for two days but had reached a dead end and was finally willing to let John and Sherlock in on it. The case was interesting, yet predictable, merely a four on the scale. However, it required John and Sherlock to get outside and enjoy a good chase across the city, something they’d not done in a while. The chase eased the tension off them and cured the boredom Sherlock had been suffering from the past couple of days. When they finally caught the man who had killed his stepfather for his inheritance, dawn was beginning to break. John decided they should walk back home even though it was still raining. Sherlock didn’t mind. They walked hand in hand, which Sherlock was still getting used to, even after more than a year. Sometimes he still couldn’t believe that John voluntarily displayed his affection for Sherlock in public. The two of them being together had been a real stake for the press and several boulevard papers, but John never complained about the rubbish that was being written about him. As they were walking through a park, Sherlock suddenly stopped.
“No, Papa, please. He told me we could go. Maybe we’ll see another shooting star,” she said in a pleading tone and looked at him with her big, green eyes.
I turn around and look for my watch. It’s still a bit early to get up on a Sunday but I can already hear Sherlock downstairs. He must feel restless, because he hasn’t had a case in weeks. The time in between cases has improved significantly, but he still needs the thrill of the chase. Since Rosie and I moved here, Sherlock has banned all his experiments from the kitchen to his bedroom. The flat was already baby-proof before, and he only did experiments in the kitchen when Rosie wasn’t there (and immediately cleaned up afterwards, to my joy), but now he keeps all his stuff in his bedroom. I can hear him rummaging around with his lab supplies, he must still be working on the carpet-blood reaction experiment. Sherlock has gotten a bit slower with his experiments, although that’s mainly because of my daughter.
“Sherlock? Helping to set up the nursery?” I can’t help but giggle at the thought.
“Fine.”
They say their goodbyes in the hallway as if nothing happened.
Upon approaching his grave, I see a couple of fresh white roses in front of it. I wonder who put them there this time. I don’t really talk to the grave, or him, not since the last time.
“It’s fine, I’ve only been here a couple of minutes,” Sherlock reassures him.
It appears that John is more prone to complimenting Sherlock now that they’ve kissed. Sherlock rather enjoys it.
“I know, and I’m sorry, too.”
“Okay,” I reply, trying to smile. For the rest of the way, I keep thinking about what she could have possibly meant.
“You should go see him after work and finally ask him.” She raises an eyebrow.
They just got back from a particularly long, yet boring case. John has spent the last couple of days more or less living at 221B, only returning home for sleep and showers – not that Sherlock would mind. He enjoyed the company, and a very selfish part of him wishes that John could stay. He wonders again what their lives would look like had he met John prior to Mary.
Sherlock’s brows furrowed and for a moment John felt like he was missing something of importance. Rosie closed her eyes, her lips moving slightly as she uttered her wish. She opened them again as John leaned closer to her.
“No, unfortunately my dear son is still missing.” Mr. Saltire says and fails to look sad.
“Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there’s only one thing to do: find out where it lives.”
Sherlock nods in response.
“What’s going on?” John asked.
“So, any news?” She asks.
Sherlock returns shortly afterwards without his dressing gown. He buttons up his suit while directing me towards the stairs.
“Bye.” I hang up, look over to where he is still sitting on my chair and resume my train of thoughts immediately.
John looked at his daughter in utter astonishment. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say she was trying to set her fathers up. He looked at Sherlock, who was raising an eyebrow at him. John briefly nodded before changing spots with Rosie, causing him to be in the middle of their little chain.
He decides to settle on something neutral. “You look wonderful tonight.”
Even though the cab was a false lead, John enjoyed the thrill of the chase, the adrenaline rushing through his veins again after so many years. How is it even possible to feel so comfortable around someone you’ve only known for a day? John tries to think back to the day he met Mary, but it was all fussy for him then. He isn’t even sure he remembers everything correctly.
“No, please continue.”
“I didn’t,” Sherlock murmurs against his neck, his breath hot against John’s sensitive skin. “I never practice.”
Sitting down on a comfy red armchair in the living room, John feels ashamed of himself and his thoughts. Is it his fault he feels that way about this flat? He takes the tea from Sherlock, who has taken a seat on the black leather chair opposite of him.
John gets up from his chair and nods understandingly. “I’ll try to be home as soon as possible.”
“Fine. I like her. She’s an interesting person. I don’t want to see her or ‘make a move’. Is there anything else you want to know?”
John’s face is soft and tender when he slowly shakes his head. “I’m sorry, no.”
He leans forward and pulls his wife into a close embrace. The knot in John’s chest finally seems to unravel a bit. Everything will be alright; they will be able to get past this. “You’re amazing,” he whispers in her ear.
“Yes, I think I do,” John replies, but his voice sounds strange. This is not how he imagined their first conversation to go at all.
“Sherlock?”
“Wonderful.” Mary tells him the name and address of John’s clinic – as if Sherlock doesn’t know already. “He usually finishes work at 5 pm on Fridays. Maybe you could pick him up.”
For a moment, she seems startled. “Oh, no, no. I- I was actually on my way to a friend. Err, anyway John. I’m sorry but I’m quite late already,” she smiles apologetically.
John opens his eyes, panting heavily, his mind still trying to process what just happened, but once he notices the expression on Sherlock’s face, his heart drops to the floor. Sherlock looks shocked; practically horrified.
“That wasn’t just me,” he tells Sherlock.
“I don’t know the code,” Sherlock emphasises.
“Have you settled on a name, yet?” he asks while checking the instruction sheet again.
His thoughts are interrupted when John’s index finger is poking into his side.
“Excellent. I’ll have someone pick you up later. We’ll discuss the rest at my office.”
“Mmmh, let’s see. They have dinner, go out for a pint, maybe go to the movies. Something like that,” John replies with a smirk on his face. He leans back further in the chair and takes a sip of his earl grey.
Sherlock’s face is completely blank. He doesn’t move, he doesn’t speak, he only stares at me.
He can see the look of confusion on the other man’s face, an expression he’s gotten to know quite well ever since he started deducing people out loud. The lie about the call is only half-false; he’s sure that Lestrade will call for his help any minute.
“I do. They’re fascinating,” Sherlock replies, but his eyes are fixed on John.
“Mrs Hudson?”
talk with Rosie?
“John?”
“Alright.”
John nodded, then looked at Rosie. “Seems like someone is bored by our conversation,” he whispered.
John momentarily gives up on finding the keys, turning around with a loud sigh to look up at the man in front of him.
“I’m truly sorry, Sherlock.”
“Good morning,” John says with a rough voice.
Inside, pitch black darkness embraces Sherlock. He has to blink several times to adjust his vision before slowly moving forward. He tries to deduce everything he can – no lights, no screams or cry indicating a potential victim, no sign of any human being in his immediate environment. He stays still, waiting for what he knows is going to come.
For ever
Outside, the cloudless black sky allows John to see the stars from afar. He stares out of the window, purposefully ignoring the person sitting next to him.
This time, Sherlock doesn’t intent to sleep at all. This is probably the last time he’ll be this close to John in a long time, if not ever. He watches John again, ignoring the warmth currently spreading in his chest. Since they are face-to-face this time, it’s easy to bend forward and close the short distance between them. Right before John’s lips, Sherlock stops. Instead of doing what he imagined himself doing so many times, he pulls back slightly and rests his right hand under his cheek. He knows he probably shouldn't do it, but he can’t fight the urge to touch John just once. He slowly starts to stroke John’s head with his left hand. He touches John’s temples and his forehead, and then starts to slide his fingers through John’s hair. It feels so soft, if he could just –
“Alright, alright,” John heard himself say before Sherlock got the chance to answer. For once, he wanted to be the fun father.
in a village close to Salzburg. They can pick me up anytime.”
John rolled his eyes. Disagreeing with their daughter was something Sherlock had yet to learn.
I turn around and see my wife standing in the doorway. She’s already wearing her pyjamas. Her gaze wanders through the room until it sticks with the mobile.
Rosie made sure that Sherlock was listening before whispering into John’s ear. “I wished for you and Papa to be married.”
“What a lovely little family you have. Your daughter looks just like your husband!”
“I figured. Are you alright?”
“So, you… you mean, you want this?”
“Despite everything, Clara and I never got along great. I guess deep down I always saw her as a liability, which is awful I know, but if it hadn’t been for her, I would have left home earlier. Does that make me a horrible person?”
Only when John feels like he’s about to run out of air, he can see Sherlock’s feet moving outside of the tank. The tied hands come back in immediately and pull John out. John takes a deep, life-saving breath of air and spits out some water before turning towards Sherlock, who’s lying on the cold metal ground next to him.
“No. You see, I’m not looking for any sort of relationship; I consider myself married to my work.”
“Right, this should do it,” John says before stopping abruptly. Sherlock can see his eyes widening and one of his brows furrowing upwards as John stares from him to Miss Adler and back.
Sherlock enjoys the looks of confusion on Greg and John’s faces.
“Some do, let me show you a couple. I think this particular model would be a match for you. It has a nice floral design, too.”
Oh. So he wants to give his full attention to Irene Adler. Of course. Fine.
“I’ve told you that I won’t be at home tonight, haven’t I?” John asks, taking a bite from his buttered toast.
John has no idea who Sherlock is talking about, but he follows him and Mrs. Hudson downstairs nonetheless. The man waiting for them looks suspiciously like he’s working for the Palace, again.
“Fine! My grandmother made this for me when I was a baby and somehow it stuck around.”
“Okay, okay. John I am worried about you. I know from your blog that today was the day you met Sherlock –“
“Ah, you’re both here, that’s great. Sherlock, I’m glad you’re back,” he says, turning towards Sherlock and giving his shoulder a light squeeze. He shares a knowing look with John before continuing, “Your brother told me I’d find you here.”
“And why would I do that?”
“Your destination would be completely untraceable, even for me. It’s a matter of international importance; and it would remain absolutely secret.”
“Of course, John, although I wouldn’t mind a second interruption,” he states. I find myself going red at the suggestion.
Sherlock bends close to him and says: “I think I know where we could watch in peace.”
So, guess who's finally back! I couldn't resist the temptation to include the "big question" scene, as it does actually fit within the timeline of the show.
“So, when I like a woman, I compliment her on her looks.” He looks at Sherlock, thinking about what he could compliment him on. There seems to be too much.
They went upstairs together but Rosie insisted on Sherlock going first. He didn’t even have time to wonder about that when he opened the door that led outside and saw John. His stomach dropped to the floor upon the sight. John was standing on the blue blanket they had spent so many evenings on, surrounded by two dozen candles. The look in his eyes spoke of promise, of hope.
