Watson had been shot, stabbed, broken multiple bones, survived poison and been concussed. The hangover was worse. He remembered fragments, like a shattered mirror or a ripped up image: owls and chicken with rosemary, nothing made sense. When he saw Holmes, he felt a rush of excitement but couldn’t understand why.
“You didn’t even think what it might do to me, thinking you dead?” Still, John had to try to get some kind of self-recrimination out of the bastard. He needed Sherlock to feel something that showed he understood he’d almost killed John, that it would have been better to kill John than push him into that drunken stupor of a half-life…
Sherlock leaned away and John saw Mycroft looked embarrassed and uncomfortable now. Sherlock didn’t move so far away that his shoulder didn’t bump John’s when the car cornered. Mycroft kept his gaze down in his lap, apparently fascinated by his gloved hands.
“Like scratch marks?” Nithercott suggested. “Or perhaps the victim wrote something on the doors before he died.”
Watson leaned into Holmes’ body, hiding nothing of his hunger for Holmes’ skin, bleeding or not. He pressed his open mouth to whatever part of Holmes he could reach: his temple, the side of his nose, his jaw.
The one with the dark eyes, eyes she didn’t trust said, “Your art with Sir Victor was breathtaking. Your work at the church was mesmerizing, but I can’t allow the performance to go on.”
He took another half-step forward, a part of his brain starting to anxiously shudder over why. “Always.”
The victim looked around wildly, pulling against his cuffs. His feet scrabbled against the uneven concrete floor. His mouth hung open as he panted. Sherlock could taste his fear on the cold, stale air.
Not a question. Not allowing any other truth but what Jones wanted. Jane worked with and against men like that: only their vision, no one else’s. She’d tried to explain different techniques Victor could use to manipulate him, but Victor said, “The truth always prevails in the end.”
Ladies’ cries and men’s shouts rose up. Some men took to their feet in outrage, but no one moved. Except for Holmes, of course. He slid out of the pulpit and began creeping on his knees up the side aisle. Watson slithered after him.
Watson pitched forward precariously as he stepped from the carriage. The groomsman caught his arm to steady him. “Alright then, sir?”
John put on his socks and shoes while Sherlock coldly told Mycroft they “needed an extraction.” He found a wooden crate, turned it upside down. His knees protested as he eased himself to sit on it.
“I’ve no regret about bringing you low, Solomon.” Victor stood straighter, too, but not straight enough. Already compassion modulated his tone. “But I am not without pity. I’ve arranged a position in France, at the medical college. A professorship.” He took a sheath of papers from his dresser top and held them out to Jones. “This is your chance to retain your reputation, protect your name. It’s a new life, Solomon, where you can redeem yourself by making better choices, be a service to mankind.”
“What if I can’t keep you safe?” Sherlock’s whisper was so insubstantial, John wouldn’t have heard it if they weren’t standing shoulder to shoulder.
“It was highly amusing to watch Mycroft practically shit himself with fear.” Sherlock’s tone had dropped a register, almost a growl.
Holmes blinked first. “The woman who watched Sir Victor’s murder also arranged today’s extraordinary performance. She is also the one who left the message on Solomon Jones’ mirror. She decorated Sir Victor’s skin with scars.”
“Serbia? Mycroft brought me to Serbia? Christ!” Why it seemed so outrageous, John wasn’t sure. The cyrcillic alphabet, the bombed-out buildings. Still. To hear it spoken so casually, hey, you were in London and now you’re in Serbia, made it all too real. All of it. Serbia. Sherlock. Something tightened in John’s chest.
“Ride with me back to London.” It was a demand, not an invitation. But a structure of fear, not arrogance, supported the words.
He shut down that thought just as the Chemist drew a huge hypodermic from the pack, some kind of relic from the great war, thick needle, plunger hovering above a yellow viscous liquid that refracted the weak light filtering through the broken windows.
Holmes shot him a look so unexpectedly brimming with hurt Watson stood up. He couldn’t help himself. It was so instinctual. Holmes in that much pain demanded a response.
The statement rang hollow and meaningless through John’s foggy brain. Remorse and horror swamped him. “No. Sherlock. I r-r-” He couldn’t even force the word out of his throat.
When he started walking briskly away John took two long jogging steps and grabbed Sherlock’s arm. “Be careful. You made a promise.”
With a deep breath John crouched down, retrieved the key ring. He put on his soldier-self like a pair of gloves: shoulder square, spine straight, eyes forward, no thinking just doing.
In mid-homily, the pastor stuttered. Watson looked past the hats to the pulpit. A man stood behind the cleric, a man wearing a hood and a mask and holding a pistol to the back of the pastor’s head. He spoke -- Watson was too far to head his words. “Please, everyone, I beg you stay seated and calm,” the pastor said, his voice quavering. “He says no one will die if you simply stay still.”
Holmes slid onto the bench beside him, leaving Solomon Jones alone on the opposite one, still stark with fear. Something about the man turned Watson’s blood cold.
Without warning, Holmes said in a low, threatening voice, “We shall revisit the topic of your defection.”
She cut the backs of his knees, and he shook and cried out. She paused to watch the orgasm, then slashed cuts on his hips so that blood mixed with his other fluids. By the time she laid her knife against his nipples, he was hard again.
Now Watson ran. Bad leg be damned, he ran in the direction of the fleeing murderess but he didn’t care about her. He ran from Holmes because he couldn’t run from himself. He ran out of the graveyard, past the church, up the narrow country lane, hopped over a fence, paralleled a hedgerow and saw the thick branch swinging towards his head out of the corner of his eye right before it hit him, and everything went black.
This was art. Like the scars carved into Sir Victor while he suffered motionless through the cutting. This was art from agony, from love of agony. The scars on Sir Victor were the aftermath of pain and blood, the result of a private sharing. This dancer defiling the altar of a church, she was performance art, pain and blood in glorious motion.
Before closing the carriage door, Jones dropped his eyes to the place where Holmes hand touched Watson’s leg. “It lightens the load on my heart, to know you understand what Victor meant to me.”
“You worked with Sir Victor on the Queen’s noble protection of the realm’s most precious resource, then?”
Holmes eyes narrowed, and he forced his words out between clenched teeth. “You, so happy to run off to Brighton no matter how it would hurt me, will not leave me now while I bleed. I’m so touched, Watson, by the consistency of your concern.”
Just to irritate Holmes, Watson paused to say, in his best bedside manner tone, “I am truly sorry for your loss, Mr. Jones.”
Holmes’ face screwed up into the worst of his sneers. “I can’t live with you hating yourself, Watson. I cannot...wait.  Hating yourself. Watson, you’re brilliant.”
Holmes was excited, too, but the why of it was clear: there would be a private memorial for Sir Victor Greene and he was certain both all mysterious parties would be in attendance: the murderer, the watcher in the closet, and the person who mutilated Sir Victor Greene’s corpse.
Without another word, Sherlock shook John off and, hunched against his collar, his hands in his coat pockets, he walked up the ramp and onto the unfamiliar street.
Anger rolled into Watson like thunder. He felt it as a low vibration in his breastbone. “Are you going to tie me up to a stake in the yard like a pet dog?”
The carriage pulled up to the back entrance of the Queen’s hospital. Watson pushed out even before the horses had stopped stamping. There wasn’t enough air in there, what with Holmes’ proximity and Nithercott’s hapless stupidity. Watching Holmes play with Nithercott made Watson fear utterly becoming Holmes’ next mouse.
Holmes knocked Watson’s hands away and pushed down on the coat. “Go, go, I can stop the bleeding, go.”
With a sharp motion Victor tugged his hand free. He rubbed it, frowning. As always, when stressed, he fell back on the truth. “I want you to leave the Queen’s service, Solomon!”
She opened deep wounds on the bottom of his upturned feet, pausing to watch the blood rise, then pool, then spill over. The blood soaked the rope, trickled down his skin. Flesh was meant to hold blood inside, but not take it back it.
He could not imagine exactly what happened in this cold, rusted space, other than at some point the hostage mistress bit the victim -- more than once, and not shyly -- and then the victim was killed by blunt force.
“Never leave me,” Holmes said. Still not a request. Still an order, a demand, like the only universe he’d accept was one where Watson was at his side.
She’d cried down the sun but she didn’t feel empty like a husk. She felt empty like the wind, not connected to this world but still able to tear through it. Every thought she had echoed. It made her feel impossibly huge and the world insignificantly small.
Holmes reached across the table, began unwrapping Watson’s hands from his mug. The touch startled Watson, made him fear that even in his impaired state his corrupted body would react. He pulled back violently, tipping back his chair.
“The drug we used to bring you to consciousness isn’t pleasant, but neither at present is the world. Are you listening, Doctor?”
Victor made a strange, high squeal, then a groan. Jones dodged out of the arterial spray and bounced to his feet. Not a drop hit him. He was a doctor specializing in circulatory surgery. He knew exactly how to sever a femoral artery and get away with it.
The Chemist’s anticipation, the woman’s willing nudity, the lack of John -- no, no thinking of John! -- put Sherlock’s nerves on edge. There was something decidedly sensual building here, where past evidence confirmed blood would be spilled and a life taken.
She cut the pad of her dominant hand’s index finger and began tracing the scars on Victor’s skin. She didn’t know why, exactly. With her new bones came an intuitive pressure moving her gently and inexorably, a force that was in her but not of her. It marched in through the hole made by her grief.
Pulling away layers of clothing, Watson scooped away blood from the knife wound to Holmes’ left side.
Watson straightened, his bad leg protesting being bent so long. Leaning precariously, he pulled open the dead man’s shirt. The scars spread up his hips, his abdomen, his chest. Everywhere polite clothing covered the skin, he’d been carved into a piece of living art.
“Release me at once.” He sounded like the stern soldier, at least, while his spirit cowered in his skin. He’d seen her work on Sir Victor’s skin. He knew she could keep him in pain for hours. For days, if she wanted.
John flew apart, his entire body blowing wide. He dissolved into nothing, hovered there, then slammed back into his bones. Every muscle burned. His lungs burned. Gasping breaths scraped his raw throat. He collapsed, lying sideways over Sherlock’s body, his forehead pressed to the cold concrete.
But Sherlock’s question echoed in John’s mind. Who do you want? Six months of drowning in loneliness and regret. Six months of not having. And now he knew exactly who he wanted.
“Of course.” Sherlock’s smirk was full of the regret John had been looking for earlier. Fear of whatever the Chemist had done, fear of losing John. When was the last time Sherlock had really rested? For the six months John had been drunk and dying inside, Sherlock had been throwing himself against Moriarty’s secret army alone.
“You are safe.” Holmes said. “But if you receive further mysterious communications, send word immediately.”
Nithercott said in a conspiratorial voice, “Sir Victor had apparently approached the Queen to negotiate an end to his service as her Special Minister for the Protection of Children. Her Majesty wasn’t pleased.”
Waiting for Mycroft’s gorillas with guns? Unacceptable. He’d raced the villain to his lair and won. The abandoned smelter crouched between a greasy, sluggish river and abandoned railroad tracks he’d followed on foot for miles. The Chemist would be here before nightfall, and all Sherlock’s questions would be answered.
From the pack the Chemist took a vintage crystal bottle, delicate as anything on a ladies’ boudoir table. The hostage -- he could not recall her name, Olivia and Olivette or something -- tipped her head up, and the Chemist carefully dropped liquid into her eyes.
His captor hauled John back onto his knees. John blinked his sight clear again, and realized that bare foot was attached to Sherlock. Sherlock was tied to some sort of piece of machinery, his arms spread, shirtless and breathing hard, bruises on the left side of his face and shoulder and chest, misery and fear in his eyes.
Hiking up her skirt, she climbed up on the table and straddled Victor’s corpse. The difference between a living body and a dead one between her legs seemed much less obvious than it should be. If she closed her eyes she could easily imagine it was any night at all, when she was about to lay blade to flesh and Victor had fallen into his perversely intense stillness that made it possible.
Sherlock waved a hand, as if being on a different continent without consent was nothing to worry about. “The Chemist retained the mistress as a hostage, but he never asked for any ransom. He just started abducting homeless people, and we didn’t know why. Until five days ago.” He frowned. “I think five days. I haven’t been entirely lucid.”
Holmes’ voice came from just behind Watson’s left shoulder, and definitely not from ground level. Watson turned, and immediately reached out to steady Holmes on his feet.
The church was silent, spellbound, as she danced. The ornament hooks plunged into her skin tugged and pulled and shifted. The blood trails streamed faster from the wounds. She lifted her left leg with a dancer’s grace and flexibility, revealing shards of colored glass impressed into the soles of her feet.
And this was what he thought he’d lost. Absurd adventures with this fascinating man who never ceased to surprise, to amaze, and now…”I’ll never let you tie me up, no way.”
Sherlock leaned into him, a warm pressure on his shoulder. “Be easy, John.” He whispered so lightly John didn’t think Mycroft could hear, and Mycroft didn’t even try to, as if anything Sherlock could say to John was beneath Mycroft to bother. “Remember how frightened he is.”
Jane had once been sold. A pretty virgin under sixteen, with all her teeth and no pox marks -- ten years ago she fetched more than a matched pair of carriage horses.
“You left me believing you were...goddamn it Sherlock. Do you even know ...?” John bit down on his tongue. Sherlock didn’t think he was real now, but he’d find out his mistake soon enough. And he surely wasn’t going to say anything like Do you even know how it almost killed me?
The scarring fascinated him, and he wasn’t entirely sure why. He talked it out to Holmes, as he always did, trusting the detective to rearrange the tiles of his observations into a picture that could shed light on the mystery.
“Victor and I shared a forbidden passion, and we were tired of keeping to the shadows.” Jones lifted his chin and squared his shoulders.
“Stop!” Holmes surged forward but she was too quick, putting the knife against Watson’s throat again. The point slid under the skin. Watson heard himself panting, but his mind drifted above it all. He felt detached and done, done with all of it.
Forgotten in their own drama playing out, Jane’s heart opened up in a rush of burning fury. Lava split her vessels and veins, boiling to her surface. Here was love, while she was alone. Here was love denied by propriety, by respectability, by all that’s proper. She was alone, and she hated that blonde man who could have love, if he only had the courage. She longed to make him suffer for his cowardice.
Solomon Jones screamed and squealed, incoherent begging, just a string of no and stop and prayers to a divinity that surely didn’t care how he suffered.
Watson wanted to hold out. He wanted to show Holmes he wasn’t a pet, he wasn’t leashed or muzzled, his was an angry man humiliated and in pain and deserved understanding. He’d taken so much from Holmes, tried so hard, risen above what he believed were the limits of his capabilities to be what Holmes needed…
Now that the dam of truth was breached, it poured from Victor’s mouth like rain from a gutter. “I know about the funds you diverted. I know about the girls, Solomon. The girls you sold.”
Watson hauled himself to his feet, heart thudding. He stood gasping in the flickering firelight, gasping in more smoke. What the bloody hell was wrong with him? His body had gone full on rogue.
Sherlock’s anger slowly evaporated. His expression unclenched from anger. His shoulders slumped. John’s own anger cooled, seeing Sherlock so disturbed.
John’s anger folded up on itself, turned round into its flip side. He’d been so afraid that Sherlock didn’t care how John suffered, he hadn’t thought how Sherlock might’ve been hurting. It wasn’t an easy thought. Being furious that Sherlock didn’t care seemed a far more comfortable feeling than seeing Sherlock work alone to keep John safe. So much easier to be angry. But Sherlock stood there, his shoulders tense, his back straight, his hands clenched into fists. He stood there not dead and in that moment, John cared about nothing else.
“There’s a rumor started since Sir Victor’s murder.” Nithercott looked sly. “Of the quite unflattering kind.”
The words slipped out before Watson could censor them, as if Holmes pulled them from his throat with the intensity of his stare. “But I know cruel you can be.”
Watson lunged to the spot, skidding on his knees. He grabbed a thick length of rope tied off to a metal hook and lunged his upper body over the edge of the pier, barely keeping himself balanced.
Holmes stepped back to give Watson full access to the view of Sir Victor Greene’s body, lying uncovered on the slab.
“I remind you, Sherlock, that we have no interest in recovering this man alive. He has no value as a source of intelligence.” He gave John a chilly look. “Shoot to kill.”
Holmes snatched Watson out of the groomsman’s grip. “The Doctor is my problem to mind.” Then he seemed completely shocked by his own words. With a muttered apology, he started off towards the church doors.
Not much dignity, though, being pushed into a chair. His aggressor loomed over him. “Where’s Holmes? He leaving too?”
Watson drew breath to say what he was thinking, she was in the closet, the one who cut Sir Victor was the one who orchestrated today but Holmes gripped his upper thigh tightly.
“Be at ease,” Holmes said in that portentous tone he sometimes took, the wise man speaking to his brain-addled apprentice. “The villain is dead, and the hero victorious.” He put both hands on Watson’s shoulders. “Let’s not do that again, shall we?”
Those words echoed, then everything went silent. Not even a heartbeat in his ears. Just that word, not even audible but visible. It loomed over him, stretching up into the sky.
Thankfully, the Chemist arrived first. As the afternoon light began to fade, he dragged in the half-conscious body of a man. The hostage mistress trailed subserviently behind him.
But Sherlock looked at him intently, emotions in his eyes John had never seen there before. His heart constricted again, and his throat closed up in something like and not like fear. He became acutely aware of how close they stood. The hair on his arms, on the back of his neck, shivered.
On the stoop, five large Pinkertonish men stopped him. “We’ve come for you and Sherlock Holmes,” said the leader, a man without hair or neck.
Holmes could skin a man’s defenses away using words. There was no bloody way in hell Watson was going to revisit the topic of his defection. He wouldn’t survive it. Holmes would steal his breath, crush his heart and leave him dead on the floor.
The rope fell away and Watson used his hands to frame Holmes’ face, his thumbs sweeping across Holmes’ cheeks. Holmes grinned and Watson’s breath caught in his throat.
“Will that be two people, or three?” Holmes asked gleefully. “You have no color in your face whatsoever. You look like a vampire on a fast. Wear these.”
“He needs nothing from you.” Holmes’ voice shattered the dark intimacy. She twisted, putting her knife to Watson’s throat, using his suspended body as a shield. “Watson, are you unharmed?”
Jones nervously made a tube of his physician’s college appointment papers. “Give me one thing before I retreat in disgrace.” He lifted his eyes from the floor and fixed his gaze on Victor’s belt.
“If you close your eyes it’s no different from a woman,” Solomon whispered, voice quivering, eyes wide and pleading.
Caught off guard, Watson blurted the thing he feared most. Even as he said the words he knew that Holmes had played him expertly to capture just this reaction. “I can’t live with you hating me.”
Watson felt himself dragged down Holmes’ thought, loving the swirling sense of falling outside of himself and into Holmes. He saw the end of Holmes’ theory. “She was hiding inside the closet.”
A growl tore up John’s throat. He grabbed the Chemist’s neck and pushed him back, back against the assembly of iron pipes that held Sherlock. John bashed his head against the metal, feeling the skull give. Again and again, like thrusting home into a woman but never this good, never. He heard the crack and the shift in the bones, smelled the blood and brain matter, smelling like nothing else. John pushed the corpse aside, panting and gasping and shaking with need. It thundered through him, rolling and shuddering. Never like this before. Horrified, exhilarated, out of control, he heard his name in a voice that skimmed across his skin and then into it.
The sibilant “s” sounds tickled. Watson swallowed hard, but he nodded and did as Holmes bid. He scanned the crowd when the pastor stood up and led them in prayer. He tried to read eyes and expressions as attendees looked at the cluster of flowers and leaves standing where the deceased casket and body would normally be.
“This is the man you want, Sir Victor’s murderer. As you know.” Holmes tied the end of Jones’ leash to a hook in the cellar ceiling, the mirror of the one from which Watson hung. “I propose a trade.”
“And where the fuck are your shoes, do you even know?” LeStrade had hauled him off in his own private car, delivered John to his squalid basement one-room. “You can’t be doing this anymore, John. Get a fucking grip.”
John saw the Chemist had piled their clothes by the door. He’d been unconscious and the Chemist had stripped him, tossed his clothes aside carelessly. His underwear, his socks. John’s stomach clenched and rolled.
The victim’s torso was decorated with military tattoos: a forgotten veteran of the Serbian wars, a warrior defeated by PTSD and heroin.
For the space of three deep breaths, John found himself transfixed by Sherlock’s open expression, the frank honesty in his eyes.
Today would be her fifth murder. Before administering the fatal dose to the dancer, she’d killed three times before. Victor had asked her that once, dimming the afterglow of one of their earlier sessions. Back then, his skin had been dishearteningly smooth. They’d only begun to make it right.
Watson thought about the scars on Sir Victor’s skin, the intense intimacy between the two of them, artist and living canvas. “No. I’m sorry.”
Every one of John’s muscles tightened like he was a spring. Sherlock’s face faded into the golden glow he couldn’t resist.
Sherlock threw up his hands. “Visual and auditory hallucinations. I never do things by half measure.”
John laughed, both at the irony and to defuse the tension between them. “Sherlock Holmes, don’t die again.”
For many hours lay on the floor, reduced to helpless Jane Carter by the oppression of grief. That’s how she felt: oppressed, flattened, held down face first in brackish, oily water. She’d lost Victor and now she was losing her bones. She cried and her bones dried, sifting to dust in the bag of her skin. She couldn’t move. She could barely breathe. She wanted to scream, kept opening her mouth and eyes wide and straining to vomit out this burning grief. But she couldn’t.
Sherlock looked to the side, cutting his eyes hard. In the barely-there flickering light, John saw them shine.
So many whu-whu sounds in that sentence. Watson giggled, then remembered what he meant to say. “I wish I could be like you. You are art, Holmes, all the pieces in the right place, all the right pieces, a perfect symphony of intellect, Holmes. And then, me.” He shook his head sadly. “You deserve better. You deserve more.”
“Get dressed or we’ll take you like that.” Lead Brute pushed Holmes on the shoulder hard enough to spin him around. “Or I’ll come in a dress ya. See if you don’t like that, eh?”
The Chemist pulled peeled back his latex gloves and rolled off his brown coveralls. He kept on his boots, but otherwise was naked. His skin was frog-belly white, knees and elbows crusted with dry skin, his chest hairless and his nipples, thick and already hard. So was his penis, skinny and long as the rest of him.
Jones looked down modestly. “We have nothing to show for our lives on this earth if we do not leave our children better in it.”
Watson had managed to dress and meet Holmes in the sitting room. Now he took the pair of spectacles Holmes handed him and dutifully attached them to his face. The lenses were darkened, making the light less aggressive and for that he was grateful.
She thought she felt the slightest vibration under her tongue and teeth. Then, almost too faint to hear, came the imagined low strains of Victor’s hummed song.
Sherlock’s attention went to Mycroft. His eyes narrowed. John stepped out of the way and did absolutely nothing when Sherlock cold-cocked his brother on the jaw. Mycroft spun around, went down and didn’t move.
Jones jerked as if Holmes’ question was a slap across his cheek. “No, Mr. Holmes. You are entirely wrong.”
Holmes rushed to the woman just as the congregation surged like a wave towards the doubled doors in the back. Watson followed Holmes, whipping off his coat to cover the poor woman. But when he was close enough he saw the unnatural dilation of her pupils, the gathering of white specks along her lips, the jittery convulsions of her limbs that was no longer a conscious dance.
“You always did. You will.” John let Sherlock go and jostled him with his elbow. “I’m not entirely helpless, you know. I’ve taken care of myself in war zone.” He detected rebuke in his tone. He hadn’t meant to put it there, but Sherlock certainly earned it. He looked up, expecting a withering look or maybe a smile.
Mycroft offered them both burner cell phones. John pocketed it, and when he got out of the car, tucked the pistol in his waistband. The jacket Mycroft provided was loose enough to hide the bulge.
“How did you even manage to get yourself up?” He bent to check the wound. Holmes had been right; he had been able to slow the loss of blood considerably.
The younger of the two turned obediently. “Hell, sir, you’re feeding Old Nick likely he gonna skip dinner!”
A courtesan from the darkest shadows of London’s underworld found with a murdered favorite of her Majesty? She’d swing before the sun came up.
From the tomb of her dead lover she slipped like wind through the night to the house of her dead lover’s murderer. The locks there were no better, as if the tumblers already recognized the occupant was already dead.
Sherlock took a quick look at his face -- the first time since they’d regrouped in the kitchen that he’d looked at John squarely -- and shook his head. “The Chemist made that girl his completely, he made murder part of the sex act, and we killed her. He already killed the Sebian official.”
She studied her knot work. The main lay face down. The ropes exaggerated the path of his vertebrae, running like a fishbone from the base of his neck to the base of his spine before sliding around his hip bones. He was a tall man, nothing but bones and lean muscle. The scars on his skin came from dock accidents, large and small. Their randomness offended her.
Watson did not feel delighted. His brain boiled with facts and observations that seemed to have no place in the logical world. He longed for Holmes to build them into a solid wall of reason, show Watson how all the jagged edges fit together into something Watson could understand.
Watson rubbed the bridge of his nose behind the dark glasses. “Something about owls and chickens. Inappropriate laughter. Almost falling, a lot.”
The sun streaming in through the church’s stained glass refracted from the ornaments wounding the woman from crown to toes. She canted and stretched her body in a sinuous dance to a rhythm only she heard.
Holmes stood at the edge of the bed, the toes of his shoes right at the edge of the pooled blood. He tilted his head. Craned his neck. “Good Lord, the scars. Where did he get the scars?”
Watson prickled with an uneasy mixture of anticipation and anger. “What could I tell you that you haven’t already deduced?”
“No.” The word came out muttered, strangled by the tightness of John’s throat. He jerked his shoulders but the bindings just cut deeper into his wrists. Why was he naked? He felt like snakes slithered under his skin, he had to move. Blood pounded in his ears and he heard his breath hitching.
John wanted to say something else, something to make it okay, all of it okay. But it wasn’t, really. This was Sherlock and surely John had misread him completely. If he said something now it would just give Sherlock something sharp to stick in his gut. Because it wasn’t okay. He had to have misunderstood.
The pressure holding his wrists behind his back snapped loose. The Chemist stood beside him holding a box cutter but he could be fifty miles away. John didn’t care about him. He registered him peripherally. Only that sweet spice in Sherlock’s blood mattered.
The woman was barefoot, and with a flourish she tore away her veils and was naked but for slender golden chains linking gold and gem-like baubles that...Watson had to look twice...baubles and ornaments that were fastened with hooks into her flesh. A hundred shiny trinkets, a hundred narrow streams of blood, gashed skin and golden chains, her head shaved and a golden silk blindfold hiding her eyes.
“You are investigating Victor’s death?” Jones managed just a hint of hesitation before saying the dead man’s name, as if the sound burned his mouth. “It’s a relief to know the crimes against him are in your capable hands, Mr. Holmes.”
Let me. He hated how Holmes used language. Ambiguity shouldn’t be so sharp. It shouldn’t open up so many wounds, expose so much fear.
The day started with shockingly bright sun for London in late September. The clouds weren’t having it, though. Gray and low, they brought chill wind and far-off echoic thunder. Suitable for today.
“This is what you saw.” John barely recognized his voice, hoarse and scratchy. “The Chemist and the woman he held hostage.”
Holmes opened the closet doors just enough to insert himself inside. His eyes appeared between the louvers. “Find out the answer, Nithercott. Go forth and be your special investigator self.”
Sherlock’s gaze reached down John’s throat, took hold of his cock from the inside. John arched, his hips chasing the phantom sensation.
Holmes did not slide down at Watson’s approach, forcing Watson to clamor past and almost fall into Holmes’ lap. He sat down in the pew with a relieved sigh.
“Whatever he saw rendered him non-functional, and he’s going to get us both killed, John.” Mycroft, leaning out of the back seat, gave John a distasteful glare. “Do whatever it is you do for him. The Chemist must be located and neutralized.”
The Chemist was unnaturally tall, gaunt, like a preying mantis. He wore neat brown coveralls, blue latex gloves, square-lensed eyeglasses. His chin and nose and elbows and knees looked sharp enough to puncture skin. He radiated a palpable sense of anticipation.
Jones also yearned for money. Their grand plan hinged on Jones wanting coin and a future more than Victor. Greed and survival, Victor reasoned, would top passion. Jones would eagerly accept Victor’s option to leave England instead of facing Victor’s accusations of defrauding the Crown.
Holmes said he’d chain Watson to the bed if he tried to run away but Watson knew him better than anyone else. Holmes lied without conscience. Holmes lied to suit his needs. He needed an assistant, and replacing even one that disgusted him would impede the investigation and nothing mattered but the cases, the work.
Watson had to bite his lip to keep from grinning. Holmes’ capacity to be infuriating knew no limits.
Sherlock said nothing. He straightened his spine and opened the refrigerator. With a bottle of dark foreign beer in his hand instead of a cup of tea, Sherlock kept his eyes on the floor as he walked across the tile, onto the carpet. John assumed he would head for the couch. John was sitting in the chair, after all. But Sherlock didn’t think he was real, and John felt angry and perverse enough not to move. He let Sherlock plunk right down in his lap.
Well no shit. John tried to say you’re a judgmental prick but something burned against his neck and the curtain went down, hard.
Specks hit his eyes and he reached up to rub them. More rust fell, and it lodged in his nose and he sneezed. Sherlock sneezed. The sudden, wet noise echoed off the pressurized metal tank.
As if sensing the cascade of emotion rising in him, Holmes kicked Watson in the shin while Jones gazed with pensive sorrow out the window into the garden.
She laughed bitterly, her eyes narrowing. “Love is the whip on our backs. The poison lurking in our blood. No one is above it. Not even me.” She put the tip of the knife under Watson’s chin. “Do you know who I am?”
Holmes relaxed so slightly that Watson doubted only he noticed. No one else knew Holmes well enough to register the small signs: the smoothing of one or two lines in his forehead, the shift in the rhythm of his breathing. So he didn’t want Watson conveniently dead, didn’t want to escape Watson’s perversion by letting the Sultana of Blood and Pain cut it out of his life. Watson felt himself relax a little, realizing it.
The permission cut him loose. John lunged onto Sherlock, grabbing at ribs. Wild with need, John sank his teeth into Sherlock’s belly. He felt one of his canines snag on Sherlock’s navel, then hot blood rolled across his tongue.
“John Watson.” Sherlock swallowed, then the unfamiliar look turned overbearing and haughty and painfully familiar. “Don’t die.”
But Holmes was already halfway down the stairs. Between Holmes’ investigative mania and Watson’s hangover symptoms, Watson could barely manage to follow the man. The carriage waiting outside was no grungy public hire. Nithercott’s people no doubt sent it round.
Beefy bodies pushed Watson back through his own door. Huge fists spun him around, and what other choice was left but to walk up the stairs without arguing, dignity intact?
Too much naked male skin. John broke out all over in a feverish sweat. He felt the drops roll down his temple, down his side, over his ribs. He jerked again and again at his bonds, not caring about the pain. He got one knee under him, tried to stand, but the Chemist pushed him back down. John turned his head sharply, away from the half-hard penis poking toward his face. He choked down a gag.
John heard Mycroft draw breath to say something, but whatever it might have been, Sherlock slammed the door on it.
It hit her then: what would the noble folk make of her art on Victor’s skin? She hoped the shock would burn out their eyes.
How had he lost his shirt that night? Oh shit, yes, he wanted to put his heart against the sidewalk where he swore he could still smell Sherlock’s blood. But he’d just scraped his nipples and that hurt enough to make him cry. Christ he got maudlin when he got too drunk.
Suddenly Holmes was kissing him: hard pressure, dry lips, wrong angle. Their noses crumpled painfully together.
“There was no medical need. Holmes, this is art.” As horrible as it was, contemplating a man suffering time and time again under a blade, the beauty was undeniable.
Watson clenched his jaw. The closet doors were replaced to facilitate the watcher inside. But Nithercott didn’t know there was a watcher. He was the hapless mouse and Holmes the cruel tabby.
“Why were you running off to Brighton before dawn, no note?” Holmes stood up so suddenly that Watson took a half-step back.
Watson jerked forward as the carriage horse started into the street. He tilted wildly. Holmes steadied him. Watson had to sit very still for several breaths. The most dangerous man in London certainly wouldn’t throw up in his own lap.
And of course he woke up trussed and suspended, shoulders burning, arms numb, feet scrambling to stay on the ground. Because how else could he, should he end up, if not tied up?
He blinked furiously, clearing the burning film from his eyes. In front of him was a bare foot, strangely familiar even with the dirt and scrapes on the toes, as if the owner of the foot had been dragged.
Watson felt like his stomach caught fire and the flames raced red up to the tips of his hair. No hat to tilt to even hide his furious blush.
He plunged the needle into Sherlock’s bare chest. Sherlock’s spine bowed. John jerked himself up, listing sideways -- how long had he been down on his knees, he could barely feel his feet. He rushed the Chemist but was too late. Whatever was in the hypo was now in Sherlock. Still he managed to stay up while he knocked the Chemist down. The antique hypodermic clattered across the cement floor while the Chemist laughed.
Watson remembered the humiliation: LeStrade looming over him, a look of uncomprehending horror on his face. Watson, laying without shirt or shoes on the sidewalk paver that killed Sherlock Holmes.
The other man actually flinched at the doctor’s words. He seemed to be fluent in the doctor’s unconscious communication.
“The scars are presumably why Secretary Mycroft insisted you and only you investigate.” Nithercott sniffed. “Your eyes and mine will be the only ones laid upon this body, by highest order.”
“See?” Watson thumped his fist to make the point. It landed he thought on the carriage bench seat but instead struck into Holmes’ gut. Why was he so close?
Jones tipped his hat. “I’m eternally grateful Mr. Holmes.” As an afterthought, he added, “Dr. Watson. I’ll have the driver deliver you to Baker Street.”
Sherlock closed his eyes, and John’s chest melted with gratitude and respect. He sawed through the rope. Sherlock lowered his arms with a groan and sat up, rubbing the muscles.
The entrance of Solomon Jones made them both freeze. Holmes’ expression flowed from wounded to superior in an eye blink. Watson felt the removal of his attention like the sun going down.
Sherlock did not look away when the Chemist stabbed the needle into the victim’s chest. The victim jerked fully awake, gasping, as the poison flooded his heart. A sharp scent, like freshly baked rye bread with a dead mouse inside, filled Sherlock’s nose. His eyes prickled.
Her hand did not shake. The knife point stayed steady against Watson’s flesh. "So that makes you Dr. Watson.”
Rage set her alight and she bit down deeply, tearing into the cold flesh. She ripped at it, spat it out, chewing and pulling and snapping it between her teeth until the scars were obliterated, just a puddle of meat over his heart.
Counted the steps going up, too. A narrow hallway, a naked bulb hanging from a dangling socket. An open doorway at the top.
The drug. The drug in the victim wasn’t for the victim. The drug in the victim was for the hostage mistress.
“Jesus Christ, Holmes.” Watson’s nerves sparked with agonizingly sharp relief. His skin shivered with it. His brain shook with it. The smoke stung his eyes and his mouth tasted like oily green algae and Holmes was a breathing weight against his hips. “Christ, Holmes.”
Amazing how many others seemed willing to trade their nonliving for their deepest, darkest secret desire. Finding the girl to dance the death of a thousand cuts, finding this man, no effort. Like floating.
She should have enjoyed binding this man, making the ropes tight enough to restrict his circulation and turn his skin to marble white. Victor had been exsanguinated, and Jane had been bled out of all that ever mattered. Victor was dead, but she was worse than dead. Not undead. Nothing could nourish her. Not dead. Not undead. Non-living.
She’d allowed a man of virtue to invade and conquer her heart. Because it, because of love that should never be trusted, she stood in the closet watching Victor make the play that would let his conscience rest.
She found Victor’s body by itself in a small side room. Narrow windows near the ceiling let in dirty light from street level. Under the coarse linen cloth, Victor’s skin was washed and unclothed. What had they made of her work?
Holmes glided into the room wearing his most irritating chummy persona like a flaring cape. “Nithercott. What a delight.”
And in that moment it hit John with the clarity of a lightning bolt. Mycroft didn’t just fear the Chemist’s revenge. He feared Sherlock was ready to open his arms to it. Do what it is you do for him.
Sherlock shouted hoarsely. John rode through Sherlock’s bucking, clenching his jaw, nursing blood from the wound. It coated his mouth. His throat contracted, sucking it down. The emptiness inside filled, such satisfaction, such intense satisfaction. Sherlock didn’t just glow now, John did, too. He rose up on his knees, brain blanked with relief. But then ache that had been in his belly shifted lower. He put his hands on Sherlock’s ribs to steady himself, suddenly out of air. Suddenly, painfully hard, needing more now, more and more. It hurt worse, the needfulness, because of that momentary ease. Humiliation flooded him and he choked on the blood still in his throat.
“That’s accurate, actually.” John grabbed Sherlock’s hair and banged his head off the floor. “I’ve been pretty much pissed to the moon since you died in front of me!” John banged Sherlock’s head again. “And, you smell like shit yourself Mr. Druggie. What’s that about? Hmmmmm?”
John slipped his arm from under Sherlock’s hand, gripped Sherlock’s upper arm, shook him slightly. “Of course.”
Watson followed the track of Holmes’ breath until his shut up his ramblings with a kiss. Holmes’ grabbed Watson’s head in both hands, fingers tugging. Teeth caught on lips and scraped together, more blood and pain.
He stood up, rubbing his hands together briskly. They couldn’t even be sure the Chemist was on the street. They could be up to this for days before the Chemist made a move. Trotting across the street, John took the alley parallel to the one Sherlock took. All  his senses went on alert. Sherlock began whistling, a soft, meaningless meander of a tune, the sound a happy drunk might make, teetering his way home.
She leaned in close, so that Watson felt her breath on his mouth when she asked, “Does your heart hurt so badly that you want to die, Dr. Watson?”
She couldn’t love. But she could take glorious revenge. She slipped out to the balcony, stood on the railing and hoisted herself up. Her skirts swinging, she scrambled to the balustrade and swung herself up to lay flat on her belly against the steeply pitched roof.
Holmes swept past Watson, who hadn’t even realized he’d stopped moving. “Is that so? We must speak with the Solomon Jones, don’t you think, Watson?”
Sherlock moving around behind him brought John back to a semblance of sense. “I’ll call Mycroft. I hope he’s shitting himself in fear.”
Watson slammed himself into the opposite bench seat vacated by Jones. He was so angry he was shaking. “Why do you do that? Why do you use my personal shame to advance your goddamned case?”
John crossed the street and followed Sherlock parallel, pulling ahead then stopping to check a menu, dropping to tie his shoe, letting Sherlock turn down an alley.
Sherlock spat in the Chemist’s face. “You didn’t have time to tailor the drug. You didn’t have his DNA. John!”
Sherlock nodded briefly. He didn’t look up. “The drugs made her attack the victims, bite them,” Sherlock’s voice wavered a little, “for the other drug. Then, she and the Chemist…” Sherlock shrugged. “After, they killed the victims.”
He could not look away from that soft skin and the perfume it breathed. The tension, the anticipation in his blood pulsed quicker. That’s what he’d been waiting for. That’s what he was needing since the Chemist dosed him through the eyes. Whatever was in Sherlock, John must have in him.
“The Chemist. Moriarity’s poisoner.” Sherlock left the kitchen to collapse onto the sofa. He put his tea on the side table and rested his head in his hands.
It was such a horrible and horribly accurate image that John laughed. It sounded maniacal. With an echo. Christ, he was drunk.
Victor said, “This is your alternative to facing charges in the Queen’s court where you were once an authority.”
“I owe you nothing, John Watson. I have paid the highest price I can to keep you safe and alive.” Sherlock pointedly did not look at John when he spoke. “If there is a debt owed, it isn’t me to you and why the bloody fuck am I explaining myself to a fucking figment of my fucking imagination?”
Holmes opened the door, only to be tugged out by a band of his youngest Irregulars. “Come on, quick step. Shim says your bird’s a baked bean in the Wide-Legged Family and she’s shaking Ruth Hill!”
Sherlock’s voice hooked into John and pulled him around, twisted him physically so he stood over Sherlock’s bound body. Sherlock’s skin seemed to take on a golden glow. John’s nose flooded with a sweet spice, something that set his mouth watering. Shocked at the sudden aching hunger, no starvation, he stumbled back until a wall stopped him. He was seven steps from Sherlock and all that distance was a physical grinding in the pit of his stomach.
A black gloved, black suited brute opened the door and dragged Watson out of the comfortable back seat and into the too bright sun and the too cold air. He pushed a key ring into John’s hand and pointed to one of the taller houses, where the door was still intact behind a metal gate.
John felt Sherlock’s voice against him, the words like fingers pressing hard. His body boiled and his brain wailed.
“This is almost incomprehensible intimacy.” Holmes let his fingers hover above the torn pectoral muscle. “This is a connection, a passion, that transcended death. Strange how it changed, don’t you think? Both alive, the violence was precise and controlled and elegant. One dead, the violence is wild and uncontrolled, almost vicious.”
What he didn’t plan on doing was grabbing Sherlock around the chest and locking him in place when Sherlock shouted his surprise and tried to get up.
Holmes’ expression dissolved into shock, and then, something Watson had never seen before, regret. He took a deep breath, looked to the right, but never got to speak because little voices and little fists beat against the carriage door.
John woke up because something dropped into his eye. He tried to pull away, blinking because it burned. But he was on his knees and his arms were bound behind his back and there were two sharp knees on his shoulders keeping him down. Long fingers grabbed his face, wrenched his head back.. More long fingers pried his eye open. He saw the drop of liquid shimmer then fall and it bloody well burned.
The bland superiority made John clench his fist. He used it to gesture at it all -- the dead Chemist, the cut ropes. “Things have changed. Quite a lot.”
They were both clean and dressed and smelling human, but John still boiled. How could he do it? How could he? He had been duped by someone he considered his best friend, left to die inside for months, until Mycroft kidnapped him because it suited his mechanisms and didn’t have the decency to explain anything before throwing himself into a world where Sherlock wasn’t dead.
She didn’t lie, and Victor understood the profound differences in their worlds. She had to fight like an animal to survive. He had to dance like a whore. How blind they’d both been.
Sherlock opened his eyes and John turned away, turned his whole body. He was naked, still so naked. “I’ll...cut you loose. Just…” He didn’t even know what to say. He found the Chemist’s box cutter. He turned back to Sherlock and realized how could he, he couldn’t stand...he was still completely naked, limp and goosefleshed. He stood there, the knife raised his hand.
What a bloody fucking idiot. John threw up his hands, refusing to admit that believing Sherlock dead was killing him more certainly than any trap Moriarity could have laid. “Mycroft doesn’t value my life as much as you do, then?”
Watson dared not speak or shake his head. He couldn’t stop blinking. It was getting harder to breathe.
“John. Fight it.” Sherlock stared at him with wide eyes. He kicked out, tangling his feet up with John’s.
“Wait.” He couldn’t just call Mycroft like nothing had happened, just a run of the mill brush with death at the hands of a madman. “What…?” But he wasn’t even sure what he wanted to ask.
Five feet down the pier a hand Watson would recognize anywhere reached up and grasped the jagged wood, then slipped back into the water.
Watson glanced over his shoulder to see Solomon Jones waiting a respectful distance, three pew rows back.
He stood beside Sherlock, not looking up at him, giving him the privacy of his expression. He put his hand on Sherlock’s forearm. “I’ll be careful.” The words came out strong and clear, the unspoken ringing through them even more clearly: But I’m not leaving.
John’s legs buckled and he hit his knees. He bent nearly in half, his forehead touching the foul green carpet. He couldn’t catch his breath. He couldn’t think. His heart hammered so hard it turned his brain to a field of white static. He recognized the echo of his shout, inarticulate release of months of forlorn loneliness and regret, months of turning into a ghost at the bottom of a whiskey glass.
Watson’s traitorous body demanded he get closer to Holmes right now. Frantic, Watson cocked his fist and drove it into Holmes’ jaw.
The Chemist reached across Sherlock’s body, clutched under John’s arms and hauled him close. The Chemist sank his teeth into John’s throat and his body reacted, his body didn’t care it just wanted so badly.
They were outside Victor’s crypt. Or what would be his crypt, once the Queen was done with his body. The Queen. She would at some point need to kill her rival. But for the Queen she and Victor would be on a boat to the colonies. In order, though, it must be done in order. Solomon Jones first. Her wounds still raw, Jane didn’t feel up to killing the Queen quite yet.
If Sherlock was alive, came down and found John fainted outside his door...John would die of the humiliation. Sherlock would never stop with the jokes. No, it couldn’t be that way.
Every motion must have been agony, no matter how quick or slow, no matter the trajectory or the angle. Yet her face, even with her eyes hidden, evinced nothing but glory and transcendent joy.
And would Holmes even come for him? This would be a convenient, blameless way to put to rest the saga of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.
In her world Jane Carter was royal: the Sultana of Blood and Pain. They called her “lady” and “mistress” and surely no one had ever shoved her inside a closet. This is why she’d made it her life’s rule never to love. Love burned good sense to ash.
Mycroft was a big enough bastard to lie about this, just to make John perform the way Mycroft needed. And there was no possible way Sherlock... No possible way. So much blood on the sidewalk. John watched Sherlock fall. He’d heard bones breaking.
He should have a ragged drummer and torches lit on the ramparts behind him. Watson simmered. Here he was struggling with his own forbidden passions, and this creature was using it in a deceitful little play to hide something. Was he Sir Victor’s murderer?
Sherlock threw the cup against the wall. Water splattered. The tea bag clung to the rough drywall, then slowly slipped down.
“The case is my goddamned case and not our goddamned case,” Holmes said, “because you plan to scurry off to Brighton the moment you’re able?”
And John recalled that whatever Sherlock had witnessed, it had frightened him right into sticking a needle in his arm.
“The middle area had been recently scrubbed with alcohol. But inches above and below the frame had not been so aggressively cleansed.” Holmes hailed a cab, negligently asking over his shoulder, “Have you any cash?”
“What knocked me back was his goon squad. Kicked me in the head when they stormed the Chemist’s hideout. The Chemist got away.”
With sudden and irrational certainty, Watson knew that if he got into that cab with Holmes he would not come out.
“The whip on our backs, until we die,” whispered the Sultana of Blood and Pain. “Mr. Holmes, I accept your terms. On your honor, sir.”
Holmes was already seated in the last row when Watson limped inside. The church was cool, shaded from the late season sun, and dark enough that Watson, in his impaired state and with his dark glasses, had to wait for his eyes to adjust.
John dragged his teeth across Sherlock, scraping up the taste of him. He bit down and sucked on the side of his neck and his hips ground himself against Sherlock’s stomach, feeling the heat of his still-bleeding bite. He shifted so he could slide himself against that burning stickiness, the friction making him shout.
Here was such a difference between the upper classes and Jane’s world, where survival ruled as first priority. Saving face, retaining honor, finding redemption, those were luxuries of the better folk. No time for honor when you’re fighting for a crust of bread.
A whisper of “My God” and a more forceful, “Please stop,” broke Jane’s concentration. She whirled towards the sounds, feeling the tip of her knife catch both skin and rope. Peripherally she saw the man’s body lurch precariously while she focused on the two men come through the boxwood hedge.
He’d never found those shoes. Or his shirt. He hadn’t really been sober since, either. He really hadn’t been sober before that. He was really quite drunk now, but there wasn’t enough whiskey in the world, in the history of the world, to keep his blood from running cold, looking at that patch of sidewalk.
Mycroft handed him a nine millimeter handgun and an extra clip. The weight of it in his hand as he safety-checked it made his bones feel more solid.
“I found no record any order for replacement closet doors. I spoke with all the house staff, and no one performed the installation. The gardener finally admitted he saw the originals stacked behind a shed, and he took them home for firewood.” Nithercott pulled a face that made his nose look even longer. “Such lovely craftsmanship, now firewood.”
Thankfully, Mycroft burst in, all faked congeniality and brittle false pleasure. “The home team back together again.”
One hand, then two grasped Watson’s arm. Watson clawed a handful of Holmes’ sodden shirt and wrenched backwards, using the rope for leverage. His scraped knees screamed in pain as he twisted onto his back. His head smacked the pier and Holmes landed with his face pressed to Watson’s chest.
They leaned on each other for another moment, then Holmes levered himself up. Watson used his body as leverage just as Holmes’ used his own.
John held up his hand, stop, and he had to close his eyes. Sherlock’s voice actually saying his name, the gentle expression he always used when gaming John into doing something that was so deeply against his own interests. It was too much.
Three-quarters way to blind drunk Watson saw the clutch of dirty-faced boys swarm into the pub, stare blatantly at Watson, then swarm out. He drank harder and faster so that when Holmes inevitably slid into the chair opposite him, his face was nothing but a blur of dark hair and glittery eyes.
“Nithercott, was I not clear?” Holmes’ voice boomed from the closet. “Go. Investigate. Report back. Now.”
The Chemist groaned in a way that raised Sherlock’s hackles. He’d taken himself in hand and was watching the violence and stroking himself roughly. The hostage reached out to the Chemist. Sherlock could only see her profile, and even with his wavering focus there was no denying the need, the passion, the hunger, on her face.
Sherlock stood up suddenly and began pacing. Into the kitchen, back again across the carpet. “The Chemist is a genius with poisons, but apparently an inspired genius with psychoactive substances.” He clipped out the words with no emotion. “He’d enslaved her with his drugs. And he injected the homeless victims with another one. One...for her.”
“No the real question is what heights could you reach without me?” Watson gazed up at Holmes, feeling far away and incapable of sadness, everything was so damn funny. “You should have an owl. I’m a chicken.”
“But he was leaving the Queen’s service,” Holmes countered quickly. “His heart must’ve been displaced from his work, hmmm?”
Was it because Holmes’ gaze wasn’t drilling through his eyes that the truth popped out? He couldn’t stop it, whatever reason. “No,” he whispered. “You know why.”
She moved the knife away, but her fingers remained to toy with the buttons of his fly. “Victor only liked pain. Not women. Not men. Only blood and pain. It was like he was made for me. Do you think you were made for your Sherlock Holmes?”
Lead Brute wasn’t brutish enough to miss the meaning of Holmes’ performance. He shoved Homes shoulder towards the door. “Get going, you.”
Where’d this one come from, all black suited and leather gloved? A big goon thug if there ever...hold up. Where’d the big black SUV come from?
Watson sucked in a deep breath as she increased the pressure of the blade against his nipple. “Never.”
The only thing not covered in rust were the metal cuffs roped to the base of a brittle safety railing in front of the tank. Reddish-brown splotches stained the concrete floor near the cuffs. Six meters out from the cuffs there was a one-meter square cleaner than the rest of the ruined floor.
Watson looked around at the rest of the congregation of upstanding and respected faces, wondering if any of them knew, either.
It was a lit stick of dynamite and she knew it. Mr. Bright Eyes froze in absolute shock. The blonde in denial raised the gun. She closed her eyes and hoped he only wounded her. Feeling pain would be better than the nothingness.
Victor finally did flick a quick glance toward the closet where Jane hid, but Solomon was too eagerly watching him unbuckle his belt to notice the tell. Jane shifted her gaze between Victor’s face, the expression there, and where he slowly pushed his slacks down. There was no tenting of arousal in his small clothes, but she could smell him. Oh, she could smell him anywhere: a crowded room, a dark ship’s hold, a forest in a thunderstorm.
Holmes eyed him fiercely, as if he could drill into Watson brain with his eyes. “I suppose that’s a comfort, then.”
Peripherally Watson registered the woman leaving him, sliding around to stand behind Holmes. “Hurt him,” Watson said, shocked at his vicious tone. “Holmes, I almost left you forever because you couldn’t…”
After a moment, John put his soldier on like a too-tight pair of shoes. Keeping his arms loose at his sides, he walked in Sherlock’s wake, a little to the left, letting Sherlock take the turn towards the dimly-lit strip of closed shops and pubs.
Sherlock didn’t respond, and after as long as he could stand with his eyes closed and having no idea what was going on -- did the bastard walk out -- John opened his eyes and glared.
And that was the moment Mycroft’s goons stormed in. Their heavy boots caught Sherlock on the temple and he rolled away, stars bursting behind his eyes. Voices shouted. A woman’s scream rose like a terrified dove. A gun boomed. Metal shards rained down. Sherlock curled in a ball, his arms over his head. More gunfire. Another scream. Then the roof gave up and fell all over them.
“The Chemist has already taken his vengeance upon the Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs, and during those unfortunate events the DPM became...gregarious. So now we are at grave risk.”
“This is trust, Holmes. This is the most frightening example of complete trust, one man to another, I believe I’ve ever witnessed.”
Watson drank himself up to courageous, then stuffed things he couldn’t go on without into an overnight bag. With that satchel and his doctor bag, he made his escape before dawn.
Holmes brooding face exploded into a bright, almost predatory smile. It was like concentrated light flashing suddenly through the facets of a perfectly cut gem. “We must meet this rumored lover of Sir Victor’s, this Solomon Jones.” Holmes grabbed Watson’s arm and propelled him out of the morgue.
Thirty minutes of silence, and the barren snowfields gave way to a comparatively prosperous town. The sidewalks were intact. The streetlights worked. Signs glowed in windows of shops and restaurants and bars.
Sherlock stood up and tugged his shirt on. He pulled it close, fumbling with the few buttons left then giving up.
John cleared his throat. He aimed his words at Mycroft, but both Holmes brothers tensed. “Do you have any idea what this Chemist plans next?”
The first paper was a letter of appointment, naming Jones as a cardiologic instructor at a French university. Holmes leaned deeply into Watson’s personal space to read it.
Jane felt boneless. Her mouth was open but that survival instinct rendered her screams silent. How? How? The noble class did not behave this way. She hadn’t expected it. People with cuffs and collars didn’t cut their colleagues open. Only in her world did problems get solved with knives.
How many times could a man blush in an hour before losing blood pressure control and fainting dead away?
“I wanted you to throw off your shame.” Holmes’ jaw tightened. “I wanted you to want me without shame. It was selfish.”
John stormed back to the small table and sat in the only chair. “Make me a cup. You owe me that at least.”
To his absolute shame, Watson didn’t care if that man hanging from the angel bled out. He only cared about Holmes, who was definitely not fine. Sweat ran down his temples and he was starting to shake. Or was it Watson shaking? Probably both.
John sat there, watching Sherlock follow the thread of his own question and totally ignore what John needed to know. Something inside John snapped, and he didn’t realize what he was doing until he was hurtling through the air. He knocked Sherlock onto his back and held down his shoulders, so John could put his face in Sherlock’s and demand again, “How could you do that to me?”
For a half-instant Watson almost said no. He almost refused to leave Holmes’ side. But then rational sense kicked in, and humiliation -- I am a doctor! -- and he lurched to his feet.
The carriage bounced along and tossed him casually, cruelly into Holmes’ shoulder. They shared the back bench, because neither wanted to share the other with Nithercott.
The door was closed. A narrow window at the top of the door let in feeble light with a sharp slant, meaning he’d been unconscious for hours. His prison was a small room, walls and ceiling wood. Cobwebs decorated the exposed rafters. Old leaves littered the dirt floor. There was a trap door in the floor, in the farthest corner, as if there were another level to this hell. Watson breathed in mold, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dim light from the window and a single lantern hanging from a hook from the ceiling. Much like Watson was himself.
Sherlock jerked slightly, as if the words hit him physically. He leaned back and stretched. “I suppose I deserve that.” He kept his eyes on the ceiling.
“You were going to kill that woman not because she killed a man, but because she spoke an unwelcome truth.”
Jones’ gaze slid down over Watson in an intrusive way, leaving Watson put off and chilled. But he held his smile.
She moved the blade from his nipple to the crotch of his pants. He jerked his hips backwards, feet scrambling to stay on the dirt floor.
John wrenched away, falling over Sherlock’s body and crabbing backwards. The golden glow was gone. Everything’s outline was sharper, hard-edged. John shook with the need to rub himself on something. His balls were full of nails.
Watson suddenly couldn’t catch his breath. Holmes had felt it? Holmes knew??? He was going to drop dead from humiliation, a bloodless mirroring of the corpse on the bed.
“What he wants is wrong. He can’t want that,” the blonde blurted, and the dark-haired one’s strange eyes filled with the deepest sadness and sharpest frustration and an echoing black pool of dissatisfaction. His lower body twisted just a bit towards his friend, his hips seeking what he was denied.
Sherlock smiled at him, rueful and ironic, smiling like any other option would hurt too much. “I…” The smile faded. “Moriarty had embedded mechanisms to assure your death if I did not take my own life. I would not risk you so.”
Jane levered the hook into the strong rope strands mummifying the man’s ankles. This was his secret fantasy, the forbidden act, his life’s obsession. The woman wanted to dance to death in pain. This man wanted to bleed to death, slowly, feeling his awareness seep away. He’d gone as far in this obsession as opium would take him. He’d hired hypnotists. He’d tried forbidden plants smuggled back from the New World, and those, he said, took him close, so close. But it wasn’t far enough. And now that his wife had taken their daughters and left, his job was gone, he had no home, he wanted to take his final bow exactly the way he’d always wanted. He’d lost everything chasing it. Why would he flinch now?
Holmes nodded, and Watson kept his eyes locked on Homes’ face. The jagged confused expression on it, like a man about to step off a cliff and expecting to survive.
At the moment she thought she would burst into flames, or she would be so empty and dry she would simply cease to exist, something remarkable happened. The grief remade itself into replacement bones, much stronger than her birth bones. Her birth bones had been broken and knitted together. These bones were new, and if someone stripped away her skin they wouldn’t be white or gray or anything like bone-color. They’d be roiling, thunderous black.
Watson slumped into the uncomfortable bench seat, the world swirling too fast to really understand Holmes’ words. He thought he ought to be outraged, but he liked the idea of being the most dangerous man in London. He’d probably need a mask. An iron one, perhaps, a wrought iron delicacy that would make him dashing in the penny dreadfuls.
“Let the doctor see to that man.” With a gentle hand, the dark-haired one pushed down the arm of the blonde one wielding the gun.
Sherlock pulled his hands away, locked them behind his back. He swallowed, cleared his throat. He kept his eyes down, his gaze away from John’s. “Let’s get on with it, then, shall we?” he said, sounding terrifyingly like Mycroft.
“Hmmmm. Damask rose and ambergris and a sweet touch of peony. She was sweating.” He touched his fingers to the louvers near the handle, pointing out the slight oily smudges. “That’s why the perfume gave off such intense scent.”
“The Chemist has kidnapped another woman,” Sherlock said suddenly in the silence. “I don’t think he has any plans to use her like he did the Foreign Minister’s mistress. I think he’s just waving a red flag in front of the bull, knowing we’ll race here to save an innocent from some terrible fate.”
One of the brutes tossed Watson’s overnight bag into the corner, and right after the thump of leather hitting wood came Holmes’ querulous voice, “You were leaving? Why were you leaving?”
And Holmes never guessed. “Why not just cut out the scarring?” Holmes snapped his fingers. “Whoever put those scars on Sir Victor’s body equated cutting with intimacy. And so you oughtn’t be intimate with a corpse.”
John felt himself blush, but didn’t turn away. “Just because every woman in Britain thinks I’m one-night-stand material doesn’t mean you’re getting out of this.” Then, because this entire conversation was so absurd, John asked, “Do you want it with the biting and the bondge?”
Finally she did wail, soft and high and she thought it would never end. But it did, as the sun went down enough for her to slink past Victor’s body. She didn’t look. Couldn’t look. She didn’t deserve him. She didn’t deserve love. She didn’t know how to do it. She’d warned him over and over.
The sourness in Sherlock’s tone told John the kidnapped woman was probably already beyond saving, one way or the other. None of this felt good. None at all. And he couldn’t talk to Mycroft yet or he’d be overcome again with rage. So he asked Sherlock, “How can you be sure the Chemist will try to kidnap you to take revenge? How do you know he won’t just shoot you or stab you right on the street?” To his humiliation, his voice started shaking towards the end.
Mycroft recrossed his legs, scowling. He spoke pointedly to John. “We believe the Chemist is luring us into a trap. We intend to use Sherlock as bait, and turn the trap around on him.”
And so here he was again. Drunk again. Just before dawn, Sunday. No traffic outside St. Barts. He stayed across the street because LaStrade told him the last time he’d let Watson wither in the bloody drunk tank.
It happened so often, things like this, that he’d lost a certain edge to his fear. And this time, well, he wasn’t sure if death by torture would be worse than what he was enduring with Holmes.
The brute got into the limo in John’s place. The door closed with a solid thunk and the sleek black car drove off. Sunshine bounced from the tinted back window into John’s eyes, but he didn’t even blink. Mycroft’s penultimate sentence rolled through his brain.
“And then kill me.” Now Sherlock did glance up, a wry smile quirking half of his mouth. “An extravagant sort of revenge. But we beat him.”
John looked at his hands, smeared with blood. Spatters of blood across his chest and belly. Sherlock, bare-chested, hands tied, stretched out and shivering. His feet pushed against the concrete like somehow he could get away.
But she’d never seen Victor in any conventional sexual situation. Her interest rose like a cobra from a basket. She wanted to know if he would react. She’d rarely taken the time to examine his manhood. She knew how it smelled. Had brushed it with her wrist when she was making her art. But she’d rarely focused on it straight on, because her art required supreme concentration. And she’d never seen it soft.
She took a step back so she could glare into Watson’s eyes. “Do you think my heart will unbreak if Solomon Jones is arrested and tried in her Majesty’s court?”
“Did you tell him what happens next?” The Chemist wheezed the words, halfway to his feet again. John had knocked off his glasses. He squinted at John. “How do you feel, Dr. Watson?”
“Why the hell not?” John didn’t care if Mycroft died in a fire, if it meant Sherlock would go on being alive, right here, John beside him.
Solomon Jones, still wearing his grief mask, sat in a chair and made a gracious wave for Holmes to join them.
Holmes grabbed his lapels and shook, hard. His eyes were narrow and gleaming with fury. “Make no mistake, Watson. I will chain you to your bed. I will cut off your feet. Do not test me on this.”
John tried to focus on Sherlock but the world jittered. Whatever the Chemist had dropped in his eye lit a fire down every one of John’s nerves. He’d only felt this screaming sense of anticipation when there’d been a gun held to his head. His senses magnified everything: the oily smell of whatever abandoned garage held them, the way the skin over Sherlock’s ribs twitched as he breathed, the musty smell of the Chemist as he pulled down his overalls.
As a man died just twenty feet away, Watson fumbled with his fly, whispering, “Holmes, please,” until Holmes opened his own. Watson reached inside and Holmes took hold of Watson, Jones’ screams getting throaty and wet. Watson pushed their hips together and it took no time, he’d barely touched Holmes’ entire length, Holmes’ fingers shaking around his own. He sank his teeth into Holmes’ neck and Holmes bit the top of Watson’s ear and then, after a breathless moment they were both laughing.
She wasn’t surprised when the blood stained the ground by Victor’s crypt and the doctor knelt over the one with the deadly eyes, pressing his hands to the wound with horror fixed on his face.
“Yes.” He barely breathed out the word. He didn’t dare nod, didn’t dare shiver though the cellar was cold on his skin. His shoulders ached and his heart thumped and he stayed perfectly still, like a rabbit.
The car slowed and John was able to focus. It stopped in a crumbling alleyway. There were squat brick houses, windows broken or boarded. Graffiti in Cyrillic, angry black angles and anarchy symbols. Pigeons strutted and a skinny cat slunk around concrete rubble that had fallen from a second story wall.
Truly, if this got much worse she’d burst out of the closet and strangle Jones with her own hands. Would it horrify her Victor or excite him? Her slow, artistic violence mesmerized him. Perhaps seeing her in a killing frenzy would elevate the complexities of their intimacy?
Whatever he’d witnessed the Chemist do had driven Sherlock onto the needle. And now here they were, participants not witnesses. After he’d risked and sacrificed so much to keep John safe.
Watson scanned the river’s surface for bubbles of breath or ripples of movement, anything to prove Holmes survived the explosion. The burning barge cast huge, flickering shadows across the river. Screams cut the air, any one of them possibly the last sound of Holmes’ life.
On the top floor, in an ornate bed chamber resplendent with carved wood polished to the highest sheen, a dead body sprawled on a bed that was soaked and surrounded with blood.
Now would be a genuinely golden moment for Mycroft’s gorillas with guns to crash the party. Sherlock had no sidearm. Mycroft hadn’t given him one, nor given him the opportunity to procure one illegally before dumping him outside the Chemist’s lair. Besides, guns were John’s --
Watson had learned to judge the importance of a royal event by the height and extravagance of the ladies’ hats. Judging by how thoroughly obscured his view of the pulpit was, Watson realized just how popular among the quality folk Sir Victor Greene had been. He saw Solomon Jones sitting in the third row, his spine straight as a good soldier’s should be through suffering. Jones, who claimed to be Sir Victor’s intimate friend, but had no discernable knowledge of the scars decorating Sir Victor’s skin.
So not just the victim was drugged for this experience. The hostage was, too. Perhaps one substance guaranteed her compliance and passivity. This other substance...what would it do to allow her to sink her teeth into this bound, filthy stranger?
“Don’t matter,” said the head brute. “Get some clothes, yer both coming with us. Orders of the Home Secretary.”
Holmes refused to be badgered into further conversation, and Watson wasn’t sure he wanted to know what with his body’s treachery. They remained in a charged silence all the way to the small church in the city’s outskirts, a little stone gem of gothic art set among a copse of ash and rambling rose bushes blooming late. Fashionable carriages and grooms holding well-bred horses gathered round the church like it was under siege.
“I have sketches.” Watson had come back to the morgue and carefully reproduced the stunningly terrifying arrangement of scars on Sr. Victor’s body, all the while trying to understand the mechanics of it. He had to have been sedated. How else could the mutilator keep him still through the cutting?
That brought out a laugh, something John didn’t think he had left inside him. He felt scraped out and hollow, just exhaustedly blank. He listened to Sherlock’s rustling through their discarded coats, watched Sherlock put his on, even though the right sleeve was soaked through and spattered with mud. He had out the burner cell.
“I swear to you it is not lust that drives me, Victor. It’s genuine love. I’ve never, ever loved anyone before.”
Watson tore his eyes from the dancer to look to Solomon Jones. His face was drained of color. His eyes were wide not with wonder or horror, but a very personal fear.
The sunshine, so rare for London this time of year, speared Watson through the eyes. In the glare he saw Nithercott still leaning against the wall. He still looked green around the edges.
Holmes rolled his eyes. “Now now, it always turns out to be such a romp when we work together. Cast your mind back to the Grainesley case.”
“The answer could be complex,” Holmes said before Watson could say the answer was simple. “Was there evidence on the closet doors that would have implicated the killer?”
It was not the point of the knife that kept him from saying No right away. Shame rose up in his chest. He could never be enough the soldier. Never be enough the pure Platonic friend. His heart did ache badly, and he could think of no easier way to stop the pain.
“These closet doors are practically new.” Holmes rapped it with his knuckles. “And hideously out of place.” He waved a hand at the deeply polished, artistically carved door and wainscoting. The closet door was plain and painted a dull brown -- an attempt perhaps to blend in.
The carriage stopped with a jerk, and the facade of civility between them waivered. Watson saw Holmes’ eyes narrow. His hand lifted from his lap and moved towards Watson. Watson found himself instinctively moving forward, anticipating the touch. He forced himself to pull back. He was breathing far too heavily.
“Do you think your forbidden passion resulted in Sir Victor’s murder?” Holmes asked in a startlingly neutral tone.
The lock on the gate turned. There was a lock on the door, too. He started shaking again when he went inside. He closed the door and leaned his back against it and just counted his breaths.
John finally registered the repeat of his name. He couldn’t quite focus on Sherlock’s face, but he could hear his voice, understand the words. “You don’t want him, John. Who do you want?”
Why had Moriarty’s prime poisoner abducted the cherished mistress of the Serbian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs?
Holmes stood; Watson immediately missed the heat of his body sitting so close and immediately blushed because of it.
“NO!” The blonde scrambled to his feet, and Jane pushed her bleeding hostage into him. They both tumbled onto the ground.
Jones screamed and Holmes leaned back to look into Watson’s eyes. Watson took Holmes’ hand from his breeches and put the bloody, sticky fingers into his mouth.
Watson wished he couldn’t see because the light stabbed right through his eye sockets to strafe his brain. Wait. Was that street sign in Cyrillic?
Holmes spoke to Watson alone, actually turning his body away from Nithercott to face Watson directly. “Why secretly change closet doors?”
His curiosity overcame his shame after a moment. What could make Nithercott humiliate himself by losing his breakfast? At least the bastard had breakfast.
After a beat of changed silence, Sherlock turned his head to John. “I can only presume the Chemist intends to complete his revenge.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and though he still looked at John it was clear he aimed his words at Mycroft. “He took all ten fingers and toes from the Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs.” Sherlock blinked. “And his manhood.”
“A lot of bleeding, but I don’t think she cut anything vital.” His voice sounded so calm, when inside he wailed. He wanted to grab Holmes and never let go. Instead, he pulled off his own coat, balled it up and pressed it against Holmes’ wound hard enough to earn a grunt of pain.
“As deep as she will cut the “W” for Watson in me,” Holmes said, his voice hoarse. “No deeper than you would want her to cut me, Watson, please.” Holmes half reached out his arm, as if he needed to touch Watson. “Please don’t leave me, old boy. Not over this. It will be the deepest regret either of us bear. Watson, please.”
John followed slowly, and he sat in the rickety ladder-back chair. “You needn’t put on this show, Sherlock.” Christ, it felt so incredibly good to say that name and not have it tear at his throat. “I’m here. You know I’ll help.”
John heard Sherlock’s running footsteps, saw the Chemist raise his dart gun. Then he toppled forward, flinching at the upcoming pavement but he never felt the impact.
For a moment, Watson forgot that he was tied up and she threatened him with a knife. She felt like a friend, an ally who might finally understand. “He is so rarified, so remarkable. What I want is not what he needs. He needs me to be pure. He is above the baseness of love.”
“Holmes!” He reached out blindly, his eyes blurring from smoke, choking on the stench of river slime and burning flesh.
He’d fixed up the rig for her, brought the rope. He’d put an iron ring around the neck of the marble angel guarding Victor’s crypt, snapped another iron ring to it, and strung the rope with the hook through. Bunching her muscles and squaring her shoulders, Jane heaved on the other end of the rope. The man slid like a hooked fish across the ground and then up into the air. She kept pulling until she could knot the rope’s end around the angel’s feet.
The overfamiliar description of companion, the unusually intimate touch, the dismissive tone -- the uncharacteristic nature overcame Watson’s rise of humiliated outrage. This was a strategy. Watson didn’t have to like it. But he pretended to, giving Jones a sunny, vacant smile.
Holmes’ stare was intense enough to leave palpable marks on Watson’s skin. “I know you are not this dense, Watson.”
As usual, though, Holmes didn’t much care what Watson wanted. He pulled Watson up and steadied him on his feet. His hands under Watson’s arms felt huge, the only solid thing in the entire universe. Like the only parts of Watson that were solid were the ones Holmes touched. His legs waivered and he leaned on Holmes to keep from falling.
Victor held up a warning hand. Jones grabbed it, curling his fingers around Victor’s. Did you hear nothing I told you, my painfully righteous love? Always Victor expected the world to mirror him, as if he were the center of it and all other souls were in his orbit.
“Fair warning. It will cost you blood and pain, if you say yes.” She moved the knife away from Watson’s chin and laid it flat over his heart. “Even if you say no, it will cost you blood and pain.”
“I could feed your corpse to the pigs, slip away into the darkness, and your death would go unavenged forever.”
“I think you underestimated things when we found the body,” Holmes said, slowly circling the slab. His eyes glittered in the dirty light. “Complete trust between two men, you said.”
Watson raised his cane in a jaunty farewell, then went off the worst, stickiest-floored den to get drunk.
His vision was still blurred, but there was no denying what happened next. Just as the Chemist returned to stand by the victim, the mistress lunged forward and threw herself on top of the victim’s bound body. She locked her legs around one of his flailing ones, and Sherlock’s stomach lurched because her spine’s sinuous writhe and her hip thrusts made it clear that whatever was happening to her, it was profoundly erotic. The victim screamed and the hostage reared up, grinding her hips down. Her mouth was bloody, her jaw working, her throat swallowing.
The word struck John physically, went through him like a bullet. His memory repeated an echo of Sherlock chanting his name. John Watson John Watson John Watson. He didn’t understand why his heart hurt like it was breaking. Just all of it, too much.
Jane pulled out a knife: a long blade, wickedly sharp, no serration. She wasn’t cutting to cause pain, nor to create art, but to kill.
He hissed as the knife cut the rest of the letter, so slow, blood welling and dripping. Watson looked into Holmes’ eyes and watched a strange, otherworldly glory replace the pain. When she finished, Holmes shuddered and went down on one knee, white and shaking from losing so much blood earlier, enduring the pain now.
“We have a woman watching Sir Victor die from the confines of his specially modified closet,” Holmes said. “And we have someone passionate enough about the scarring to chew one off his dead body.”
The man hanging from the angel, looking for all the world like the marble angel held him upside down, was dying. Watson saw the rhythm of the blood pulsing from his neck stutter. His eyelids flickered. Already the man’s presence inside the eyes was far away, fading.
The Grainseley case had ended with Watson suspended upside down in a dank dry well on some abandoned estate house in Wales, the villain threatening the cut Watson loose to a certain death if Holmes did not give over a priceless occult scroll stolen from the Metropolitan Collection. Nithercott had shot the villain, who in his dying let go the rope and Holmes had caught it with Watson’s face six inches from crashing into slimy, algoid rocks.
If he could only leave his body and float off into the sky, leave his treacherous flesh in a heap...
When he looked up at Watson, his face clearly demanding an exit and now, his eyes shifted over Watson’s left shoulder and his lips pressed together in what Watson knew as an attempt not to shout.
Watson leaped from the carriage, landed on his bad leg, almost went down, and ran as fast as he could in pursuit of Holmes and his urchin brigade.
Mycroft’s sharp voice flipped a switch in John’s brain. It was worse than being born. One moment, nothingness. The next, sunlight and movement, bumpy road, oh Christ. He put his hand over his mouth, swallowing convulsively, leaning his head back against the leather car seat.
“You’re lucky I don’t kill you all over again right here,” John slammed Sherlock's head against the floor again, “right now, you utter---”
“No one will hear you, or know how you answer.” She looked around at the empty room, them deeply into Watson’s eyes. “It must be terribly difficult, keeping up the lies. Like carrying a dead body on your back all the time.”
“Mmmm.” Watson closed his eyes because the room would not stay still. He loved to see Holmes eat. He so often forgot to, and when he did, he always looked like the taste of things surprised him in such a delightful way. What was it like to re-experience mundane little details with the clarity of a child, again and again? “At least I’d be in your mouth before I died.”
On the bench beside him, Holmes seethed and twitched, subvocal mutterings crashing into Watson’s oversensitive ears.
Holmes’ eyes went wide and dark and Watson felt his body react again, too soon, painfully soon, and he knew this was how it would be, always. Thick and dark and wet, nothing like he imagined it would be with a decorous wife. Holmes tilted his head and licked Watson’s fingers along with him, opening his mouth wide and pushing his tongue into Watson’s mouth. And this is what Watson had feared as much as ridicule and rejection, this feeling of being turned inside out so it wasn’t the cut H he pressed to Holmes but his actual beating heart. He feared it so utterly, and now he would die without it.
They stood together in the narrow kitchen, facing off over a pot of tea they finally managed to make. The lights flickered and hummed.
It had happened twice before, Watson’s body reacting to Holmes, but never as brutally unmistakable as this time. It was a fault spreading through the bedrock of Watson’s life. It was a poison sliding through his blood set to kill all that made Watson’s existence meaningful: Holmes, and the camaraderie and cases they shared. He couldn’t let his lack of self-control ruin the Platonic ideal of their friendship. He’d rather disappear and let the memories remain clean and good in both their minds.
“The scars didn’t kill him.” Watson gestured to the dead man’s groin. “Clean slice of the femoral. Downward slash.” The wound gaped open at the bottom, the force of the motion pulling apart the flesh. “Not a surgical instrument. A knife without serration, a smooth blade with a wicked sharp point.” The entry wound punched through like the skin was warm milk. “The shape of the wound is wrong for self-inflicted. Definitely murder. The killer struck without hesitation, and by the angle, kneeling directly in front of the victim.”
John sank back in the plush leather seats, his face throbbing with fury and humiliation. His muscles shook with the need to strike out at Mycroft, cause some pain to ease his own.
She was a tall woman, strong-looking. Her hair stood out short and disheveled, like she’d recently shorn her skull with one of her less-sharp knives. Dribbles of blood had crusted in random spots on her temple, her neck, her cheek, from the shearing. She wore nothing but filthy linen undergarments: a petticoat and blouse. The buttons were brown bone.
The hooded man with the gun got away. Without a laboratory, Watson could not identify the poison or drugs in her blood. He suspected a mix. There’d been languidness to her motion that hinted at opiates, but certainly not a lethal dose and certainly not enough to do more than take the edge off her pain. How swiftly the poison killed her, he guessed it affected her brain. The seizures preceding her death hadn’t been dramatic, but they were unmistakable. In all, he deduced the person who dosed her had a work-a-day knowledge of how substances worked together to affect the body in a series of ways. A professional without regard for ethics, surely.
Watson drew himself up to full height, but still had to tilt his head to glare at the leader. “Let me by. I have a ticket on the early train to Brighton.” Or world have, once he got to the station to buy it. A one-way ticket away from his shame at betraying his best friendship with his body’s base demands.
Victor told her: I can’t leave her Majesty vulnerable to such a creature. Otherwise I would run away with you tonight.
With his back to Sherlock John pulled on his pants. For some reason he couldn’t put on the underwear, as if they were filthy because the Chemist touched them. He brought Sherlock his shirt and socks and shoes. The buttons on the white shirt were mostly gone. The material of John’s pullover was as cold as the floor.
Holmes went to stand before the mirror that balanced on the fireplace mantle. It took up the entire mantle length with its carved and gilded frame. At first Watson thought he was studying Jones in the mirror, but Holmes reached up to run his index finger down the glass from top to bottom. He leaned in and breathed deeply. He tilted his head, rubbed his fingertips, then gave Watson an urgent look. “Doctor, let us be gone.”
Jones blinked twice, his expression gone completely blank. Then a sincere look of shock and horror overcame his features. If Watson wasn’t fluent in Holmes’ rubber-faced deceptions, he would have been fooled completely.
The victim rattled his cuffs, shouting hoarsely, feet kicking hard, dislodging a flurry of rust from the ruined metal framing above Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock took two steps away, then stopped. He turned and looked down at John. “I want to do that again.”
From the briefcase the hostage extracted a tufted cushion, placed it on the floor. She tugged off her boots and shrugged out of her long jacket. Underneath she was naked. She knelt slowly, solemnly, as if starting an important ritual. She sat back on her heels, head bowed.
Waiting for them was Royal Special Inspector Jackson Nithercott, all six and a half feet of him, and now Watson’s day actually got worse.
Jane looked up at Victor’s face again, smiling at the stern for-God-and-Queen expression there. She only peripherally registered Solomon leaning closer. She transferred her attention to Victor’s cock -- would he react at all and how would it make him feel if he did? -- in time to see Jones lean back unexpectedly. She saw the flash of metal and the sudden smell of blood dizzied her. Blood meant beauty, it meant life, and it meant love. But not now.
Jane made her living reading a body’s secret signs, messages men were too shamed to share in words. That man, Solomon Jones, yearned for her beloved.
The long fingers and the hands they were on pushed John’s shoulders and he fell forward helplessly, twisting to land on his shoulder and not his face. Pain stung his skin, and he realized he wasn’t wearing any clothes. It was cold and his hands were bound and he was at the mercy of the Chemist. Who was supposed to snatch Sherlock but had taken John instead.
“Do it,” he whispered. He looked at Holmes, the sheer, ferocious terror on his face for fear that Watson would be harmed. And he thought perhaps this is better than touching his body, holding him in my arms. This look on his face right now. But he knew he was lying to himself. He looked into Holmes’ wide eyes. “Carve an “H” for Holmes over my heart, so I can deny it no longer. Let it be the bloody truth. Let it be writ on my skin, so I can never lie again.”
She kissed him, a dry pressure of her lips to his. When she pulled back, her eyes were sad, hopelessly sad. “I wish I could make that choice. I can’t, but I can give you the respite. All you need to do is ask.”
Victor swallowed visibly, and fumbled with his buckle. “One kiss, and you won’t trouble the Queen again?”
Victor didn’t look down, didn’t look at Solomon Jones. He kept his eyes open, as if closing them would make it all too intimate. He stared fixedly at the closed bedroom door.
Watson’s heel slipped into the coagulated blood. He stood there, shaking, surrounded by the blood of a murdered man, with a mystery engraved on his skin.
“The cuts were made by an artist. An artist is necessarily self-aware. This mutilation was not an act of hatred against Sir Victor. It was an act of self-hatred. Self-punishment.” He looked at the torn pectoral, then at the flesh bits spat onto the floor. “This was self-flagellation of the worst kind. This was her hair shirt.”
“Oooof!” Holmes rolled onto his back. “I’ve been kicked enough by enemies today, thank you very much.”
He felt like someone was running a low-voltage current up from his feet. His muscles tensed and relaxed and tensed on their own.
Sherlock scratched at his hair with all ten fingers, then stretched his legs and, yawning, scratched his balls. He got up, unsteady on his feet, then shambled to the hot plate, right past John as if he wasn’t even there. As if John hadn’t spent months suffering because of Sherlock’s lies, Mycroft’s lies, months and fucking months of dying inside.
She put the delicate bloody knife in her bodice, pulled a thicker, double-sided blade from her boot. She cut the rope holding Solomon Jones, leaving her a short length to drag him towards the trap door.
The gun went off but she felt more of nothing. She opened her eyes and saw the blonde on the ground, knocked there by the dark-haired one who stared down at him with his mouth open and eyes wide.
This inconvenient re-routing by Mycroft Holmes would not shake his resolve. He would kindly bow out, leave the specifics of the case to Holmes, and retreat with whatever dignity he could retain.
“It’s not that.” Victor looked toward the ceiling, though Jane knew he thought of it as looking towards Heaven for help. “I don’t…” He cleared his throat. “I do not achieve sexual pleasure in that manner.”
Finally the boiling silence became too much to bear. He had, after all, been snatched from the alternative London reality where Sherlock was dead, and tossed into the Sherlock’s alive Serbian danger zone of the Chemist. Whom he knew next to nothing about.
“I’m glad this worked out. I’ll be back in three hours. For God sakes, both of you get clean. It smells like a zoo in here.” He tossed a black duffel onto the floor, and with his own particular flourish, disappeared down the stairs.
Before he could take a breath to replace what was knocked out of him, Holmes was on him. He levered Watson to his knees and pressed their chests close together. Hissing through his teeth, he shifted to their wounds rubbed together, mingling the blood.
In a stark demonstration of the urgency her Majesty felt about solving Sir Victor Greene’s murder, Watson and Holmes were delivered directly to Solomon Jones’ apartments. They seemed far more elegant than a royal advisor should be able to afford. A lovely fresh-faced country girl served them tea and scones, declaring in a sweet voice that Mister Jones would be only slightly delayed.
Why was he now snatching street people? Why was he killing those street people in a violent frenzy after he flooded their blood and flesh with a unique psychoactive drug? And why did forensics find saliva from the missing mistress in bite marks on the victims?
Sherlock smirked and rubbed his eyes. His hair stood up in greasy clumps. Stubble shadowed his chin and cheeks. His nails were ragged and dirty. But his voice was still precise and cutting as it always was. “And now I hallucinate. Splendid.”
Instead he heard himself say in a carefully neutral tone, “That would leave Solomon Jones the most likely suspect in Sir Victor’s murder.”
Sherlock climbed up the pressurized tank, his footfalls raising low, echoing thumps. He hoisted himself up into the exposed metal rafters to wait. Either the Chemist would arrive and display all the answers in situ, or Mycroft’s goons would alert the Chemist his lair was compromised and Sherlock would need to start the investigation over, from scratch, with his quarry on the run.
The minute the words left him he knew they were a mistake. His eyes blurred and Christ he was going to cry right here and Sherlock would never let him forget it.
His awareness returned with a jolt -- he was naked, sprawled across Sherlock, Jesus bloody Christ. John levered himself to his knees. Sherlock’s eyes were closed and his mouth open. Tears stood on his cheeks. His body was smeared with blood and… John  looked down at himself: bloodier, striped and smeared with ejaculate.
The force of anger that propelled her safely from Victor’s bedroom balcony lasted long enough to see her home. And then the Sultana of Blood and Pain broke open like a dropped vase.
The woman with the knife stepped into his field of vision. She still had a knife, but a much more delicate blade. One for close up work. Detail work. The knife he guessed she used on Sir Victor.
Solomon Jones stood rigid, silent, fists clenched, face red. If he could snort smoke and fire, Jane thought, he would. Perhaps even his ear hair would be burning. Christ, how awful would that smell?
Holmes followed more slowly, as if giving Watson a little lead. Probably to make it easier to pounce. Nithercott came right out on Holmes’ heels.
Now Jones blushed, stood up, walked to the window. It was a masterful performance. Holmes followed every one of Jones’ prompts, letting himself be led into the story Jones wanted to tell. After a long moment, he went to his desk, drew out folded papers and handed them not to Holmes, but to Watson.
In a ridiculous tangle of arms and legs, they managed to climb the stairs. It all seemed so hilarious to Watson. By the time Holmes dumped him on his bed they were both laughing.
As if John wasn’t frightened as well. He turned his head, not realizing how close Sherlock was. Their foreheads bumped. John didn’t pull away, and neither did Sherlock. Sherlock’s hand was still on John’s arm.
Jane’s mind split into a hydra, angry spitting serpents hissing opposing demands. Just give up. Force them to kill you. Kill them. Kill yourself. She lifted the knife, but for the first time in her life did not know what to do with it.
In Sherlock’s tone John heard the unspoken, how it would have been entirely understandable if John opted out of Sherlock’s partnership, Sherlock’s friendship. Perhaps understandable to Sherlock, but inconceivable to John. How could Sherlock not know that? More than he wanted to see Sherlock regret lying about his death, John wanted to know that when he said yes of course, he meant yes of course.
Sherlock assumed mind-control drugs would complicate the woman’s captivity, considering the Chemist’s expertise. The woman looked thinner than in the photos provided by the Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs, but otherwise undamaged. She was elvish and ethereal, exuding waifish vulnerability that excited some men. Sherlock found it contemptible. Her large blue eyes were glassy, her affect dull, and she carried a leather pack. She seemed absolutely unaware of the opportunity for escape as the Chemist pulled the shirt off the semi-conscious victim and cuffed his wrists to the safety rail.
God what a drama queen. John felt himself grin, felt all the pieces of his heart not come together, but stop cutting him with their broken edges. The great master of deduction Sherlock Holmes thought John was a figment of his imagination. John would never let him live this down.
“Now it’s time.” She laid the linen cloth back over Victor’s body. “It’s time to make the world hurt as badly as I do.”
Sherlock drew in a deep breath. When he spoke he kept his head tilted up and his eyes away from John. “He kidnapped the mistress of a Serbian official.”
Was there anything he wouldn’t do for that wrinkled old bat with her stupid high collars? She was stupid to be jealous of the Queen. She had nothing but grief and land and responsibilities. Jane was the Sultana of Blood and Pain. She had Victor’s heart. And more inconveniently, he had hers.
Watson followed Holmes’ direction. The ground came up too fast under his feet and he lurched. Holmes caught him. “I want to go to Brighton. I want to spare you.”
Jane took out the small knife tucked in her garter. She always had a blade. There was one in both her boots, a tiny sheathed needle suspended on a chain that hung between her breasts, a spring-loaded claw set behind the gaudy fake jewel in her ring.
Two steps, three. He crossed the threshold into a filthy little walk up. Just one long space, a dripping sink and a counter with a hot plate, a rickety wooden table with just one spindle-back chair. Yellow tile bumped up against a worn green rug trying to define the different use of space. No TV, no radio. No window. Just a long sleeper sofa against the far wall, two low tables at either end. On the closest table there was a spoon and candle, a syringe and a leg from a pair of women's nylon stockings. On the sofa, unconscious, was Sherlock Holmes.
“I’m still a bit rattled by the dead-not-dead development.” John clenched his fists and glared, expecting some glib and mildly hurtful reply. Counting on it, actually, to light his fuse and let anger push him past fear.
Sherlock visualized a body, naked at least from the waist up. The bites had all broken the skin above the waist. A thin body, ribs exposed and filthy from street living -- all the victims were social cast-offs. No one cared that they died, and only Sherlock cared why and how they died. Their bodies had been dumped in various places in a twenty mile radius, no forensic clues but the hostage woman’s saliva, the bite marks and the mysterious psychoactive drug. Mycroft’s people had been working feverishly to break the formula, but the Chemist had been Moriarty’s most prized poisoner for a reason. So far they’d only uncovered tenuous evidence that the drug had been designed to work specifically on DNA markers in the captive mistress.
