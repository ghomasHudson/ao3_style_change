“This cabin is mine. My father doesn’t know about it, at least I hope he doesn’t. We should be safe to speak and act how we want. My suggestion is that you learn the proper public etiquette for an omega. Not through coercion or force from me, but as a means of self-preservation. We’ll eventually have to go back to the estate and if my father sees you behaving like an obedient omega, he’ll back off and lose interest.”
“I can’t think of anyone more worthy,” Jack said. “Angels aren’t any more perfect than humans. Having flaws is what makes you human, but it’s how you managed those flaws that makes you worthy of joining the angelic host.”
Afterward, Castiel lay behind him breathing heavily. “I hope the boys didn’t mind the disturbance too much,” he said jokingly.
“How has Castiel been as a father?” the judge asked.
“Yeah, I miss you too. I dunno when I’ll be able to see you again, but I just needed to hear from mom and dad about what really happened. Man, that explains a lot.”
“He didn’t do me any physical harm, no,” Dean replied. “However, there was psychological harm.”
“We made a pretty great team,” Dean agreed. “You take care of yourself.”
When Castiel began to stroke Dean’s cock, he could feel the coil of arousal tighten and he knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
“I need you to feel safe here, Dean,” the judge said. “I don’t want you to fear any reprisals from your alpha. You can say anything.”
Sam turns to the boys. “Go, go, go, run!”
“I am…cautiously optimistic. However, I suspect some of that may have not been truthful,” Castiel said grimly. “My father has been known to manipulate the media before. They might also be expecting us along this road, perhaps even before Donaldson…”
John leaned forward and rubbed his face with his hands. “Are you sure he’s gay?”
“Wow, he must be the best behaved omega in history. I’ve never had an alpha let an omega choose. Are you sure he’s up for it?”
“Alright, I need to get this omega to processing,” said the man holding Dean’s leash. “You will get your proceeds from the auction transferred into your account once this omega’s been delivered.”
Turning around, he found himself with an armful of angel, Castiel’s wings spread out and wrapping around him, even as the angel hugged him tight. “I could say the same for you,” Castiel teased, pulling Dean in for a kiss.
The fingers withdrew and Dean heard the distinct jangle of a belt being undone, followed by the lowering of a zipper. Looking behind him, he stared as Castiel pulled his rock-hard cock out of his jeans and began slicking it up with a bottle of lube he held in his other hand.
The grip on Dean’s hips tightened as Castiel’s knot formed. Soon it was popping in and out of Dean’s hole with increasing difficulty as it slowly swelled. It forced Castiel to slow down his rutting to pop the knot into Dean’s sorely stretched hole until it locked into place. That’s when Castiel released his bite on the back of Dean’s neck and growled “Mine!” before sinking his teeth into Dean’s mating gland.
The next day, as soon as he’d finished his lunch, Dean began to pace the suite while he waited for Gabriel. He couldn’t believe his father-in-law had actually agreed to this and Dean hoped that perhaps it was part of a scheme to let him escape.
you can be.”
Tears of anger and frustration were rolling down Dean’s face but he complied. “Yes, alpha.”
“Oh, and what if something goes wrong? How do I call for help?” Dean asked.
As Dean slowly slipped back into consciousness, he groaned as the memories of what happened flooded to the surface. He was afraid to even open his eyes until he realized he was smelling a very familiar scent. He smelled Cas. The smell permeated the room he was in, and his eyes flew open, thinking that it all had been a horrible nightmare.
“In an unprecedented move, both the House and Senate have unanimously approved the twenty-eighth amendment to the US Constitution,” the reporter said with a beaming smile. “Next month a special election will be held across the nation in the hopes of getting this amendment ratified—"
“Woah, there kids,” Dean said with a laugh. “Yeah, I know this is the good stuff isn’t it?”
“You look delicious like this, little omega,” Castiel growled. “All bound and helpless, ready to be mounted and bred like you were meant to be.”
Dean’s cock makes an involuntary twitch, not unlike it did the last time Dean saw Castiel dressed in a doctor get-up.
No one had told Dean anything about…
“So, I got what? Eight months or so before he steals my child and throws me back to those wolves?” Dean asked.
Castiel reached up and grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled him down onto his lap. “Are you going to behave for me, omega?” Castiel said with a twinkle of mischief in his eyes. “I might not have the right to do this in a few minutes…”
“Exactly,” Castiel replied. “An alpha will claim an omega by biting the back of the neck. This helps the omega remain pliant during his first claim and it releases hormones that trigger an early heat to help the first claim be a successful breeding if the omega is a carrier.”
Dean found himself held down and passionately kissed, again. Then Castiel sat back and smiled at him. “Yes. You are my beloved. Forever and always.”
Castiel blushed. “I’m sorry, I can’t help it. You have a very beautiful ass.”
If you're curious as to Castiel's new estate, I took inspiration from this one: http://www.luxuryhomes.com/lh/listing/Canada/Ontario/Ottawa/421_Gillies_Grove_Road
“Well you have been forced to eat some very bland food recently,” Castiel said. “That was my father’s idea by-the-way, after you refused to kneel next to me and eat from my hand that first night.”
Dean pondered for a moment. This last heat had ended about two weeks before the claiming ceremony, so approximately six weeks ago. Dean had fairly regular heats, once every three months. “Probably another six weeks. My last one ended six weeks ago, and I’ve always been really regular.”
The press conference was called to an end then and the pair were escorted backstage. One of the Prime Minister’s staff, a Special Assistant for Media Relations was there to greet them. “You two were wonderful. Dean, you proved to the world how intelligent omegas can be when given the chance. This will only strengthen Canada’s resolve to push forward further reforms for omega freedoms and I hope it did not fall on deaf ears in America.”
“Oh?” Dean asked. “Is that how you got brought back into the fold?”
“Your lips look so good wrapped around my dick, I’m almost tempted to just blow my load down your throat,” the sheriff said as he pulled his cock out. “But I can’t deprive myself of enjoying that delicious ass of yours again.”
“Dean,” Castiel admonished.
“So, you were trying to train me based on these stupid protocols? Do you agree with them?”
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Aha, there they are!” Gabriel exclaimed as he zoomed in on three distinct blobs.
“Alright, I’ll make a run to the nearest town and get us some more supplies. Would you like anything?”
“What do you think the old man has to announce?”
presentation form for being sexually mounted. Dean’s ass was up in the air, his legs spread, while his head and shoulders were down, as if in supplication.
Dean grinned as Castiel tossed him the keys. This wasn’t his dad’s Impala, but it was a really nice BMW. As Dean slid behind the wheel, wearing clothes in the first time in so long, without the damned cock cage and anal plug, he almost felt human again.
“Did my client ever once cause you harm while you were being held at the estate, after your pregnancy was discovered?” he asked.
“Dean? What’s wrong?” Castiel asked, his voice filled with concern.
“First, you need to be taught a lesson,” the sheriff declared, as he took a step back from Dean. “When I tell you to leave and never come back, you ought to listen. Seems I need to whip some sense into you.”
“Was,” confirmed Bobby. “Now, I’m not. That kid of yours, ‘fore he went… wherever, made some changes here. Busted my ass out and then he… we’ve set some things right. Tore down all the walls up here. Heaven ain’t just relivin’ your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always shoulda been. Everyone happy. Everyone together.”
Dean could smell Castiel getting angry and he was none too happy himself. “Now look here—” Dean began.
,” Dean cried out.
Castiel turned to him with a smile. “Come on in!”
Castiel groaned and began plunging the dildo as requested. He kept changing the angle until Dean cried out. Dean’s world burst with pleasure when the dildo hit his prostate. Dean pulled and stroked his cock harder as his world spiraled into pleasure. Dean was so close now…so close. “That’s it, Dean. Cum for me. Cum for me, my beautiful mate.”
“Yeah. I will. Love ya, man.”
Castiel nodded again and disappeared into his bedroom. Later Dean could have sworn he heard him crying.
Dean’s world exploded and his vision whited out as he came all over his hand and the bedspread below him. Once his orgasm had subsided, he collapsed, not even caring that he lay in the wet spot he’d just created. Dean barely noticed when Castiel removed the dildo and began masturbating over him. It wasn’t until he felt the hot splash of Castiel’s seed on his back and ass that he started coming back to himself.
“Are you ready for tomorrow, Dean?” Castiel asked as he held Bobby while Dean nursed the twins. They had given the nanny a night off, as she’d likely be taking care of the boys a lot more during the next few days while Dean and Castiel were called to testify.
Dean shrank into himself a little on hearing that. “Yes, Alpha.”
Sitting back, Castiel stared away for a moment. “I see. So, I take it he’s against omega ownership?”
The days came and went, and Dean grew anxious every time he felt his pups kick, reminding him of what was to come if he was still locked in his gilded cage when they were finally ready to greet the world.
They had wanted to get some of the other omegas in the Novak household to testify, but they had all been too broken after years of abuse, and they were completely terrified of saying anything against their father-in-law.
They drove back to the home they were currently renting. Castiel had refused to move back into the Novak estate when they returned to Lawrence a month ago. The boys were still small enough to share a room. Gabriel was still staying with them and helping to watch over the boys. Gabriel had seemed a little lost without having his father and brothers to dote on, and Castiel and Dean were more than happy to let him dote on them instead.
“You can clearly see that Dean is an intelligent, articulate human being,” Castiel praised. “I am very proud to be his mate, and I am so very sorry for how I initially treated him. Thank you all for listening. We will now take a few questions.”
“Dude, cowboys are awesome!” Dean exclaimed.
“Why the formality, Cas?” Dean asked, trying to distract himself from his own arousal.
“About me? Because I haven’t been the exemplary Novak omega your father was hoping I’d be by now?”
Castiel led Dean to the last empty chair next to his father-in-law. Beside the chair was a pillow. Once Castiel sat, Dean sank to his knees onto the pillow. From where Dean knelt, he knew his father-in-law as able to watch him very carefully, so Dean focused on schooling is features and following all that Castiel had taught him.
Dean groaned to himself.
Dean was convinced Michael would be lying in wait for them outside, but he wasn’t anywhere to be seen. They made their way back to Castiel’s car and got back on the road, and Dean sighed with relief.
Once Castiel began walking again, Dean immediately rose and followed. They made it all the way to Castiel’s suite without further interruption and Dean breathed a little sigh of relief. He knew he was still being watched by whatever hidden cameras there might be, but it was easier to remain calm now.
“Wow, I’m impressed. That’s a great skill to have. You were lucky you were raised by beta parents.”
“I missed you too, so much,” Castiel replied as he angled his head down and pulled Dean in for a kiss.
“Are you okay?” Castiel asked.
Dean interlaced his fingers with Castiel’s. “I’m not letting you out of my sight.”
“Why’d you sell me out, dad?” Dean asked pointedly. “After years of preaching omega rights and freedom, you went complete one-eighty on me and you refused to tell me why. I need to know.”
It wasn’t until the next insistent rumble of his stomach that Dean final righted himself. “Sorry man, I just…the fact we could just be here together and knowing your dad’s not watching us anymore. It just hit me. I didn’t realize how much I had been holding in.”
“Yeah, I also gave the angels a little bit of a remodel,” Jack replied. “Along with a new purpose.”
“They need both of us,” Castiel said. “Now, shall we go home and check in on them?”
Dean was so relaxed it took him a moment to register what Castiel had said. Then he looked at the television and blinked several times to comprehend what it was saying on the screen. Thirty-eight states in favor, twelve opposed. The Omega Rights Amendment had been ratified!
Coming down from his orgasmic high, Castiel smiled brightly at him. “You take my cock so well. I swear I’ve never had orgasms this good before your pretty ass came into my life.”
Castiel reached out and then looked at Dean. “May I?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean agreed, trying to ignore the obvious twitch his dick just made.
“Thanks.”
“I think she’s done with all the bullshit from the defense,” he said. “He’s been trying to implicate Castiel, but so far he hasn’t succeeded. I think your father-in-law knows he can’t win, so he’s going to try and take Castiel down with him, in an effort to at least see your family broken up.”
Moments later Dean heard more footsteps. He knew everyone that was scheduled to attend his…
The priest approached with a collar in his hands, handing it to the alpha. “Place the collar upon him.”
As Dean entered the house behind Castiel, the scents wafting around him flooded him with memories. Happy days running around this house, chasing after Sam, eating mom’s home cooked meals, catching the ball with his dad in the yard. Dean couldn’t help the tears that crested and slid down his face.
Castiel stepped in. “There is no need to restrain him. He chose the design and placement.”
A fresh ache bloomed in Dean’s heart as he watched Jack walk away. He nearly let him go when Dean found his voice again. “Hey Jack! Wait!”
Trying to process that, Dean looked at Castiel with more confusion. “You just said
“So, you’re trusting me alone here? Aren’t you afraid I’ll run off?”
It was gentle and chaste at first, just a press of warm lips against his, but Dean couldn’t help parting his lips when he felt the alpha’s tongue slide against his, seeking entrance. Dean turned his body, so he could deepen the kiss until his belly got in the way, which caused them both to fall into a fit of laughter. “The boys are coming between us already,” Dean joked.
The alpha sighed and gave Dean five lashes with the strap over his already bruised and battered backside. The wave of pain was so intense, Dean thought he was going to vomit.
For an omega to receive a passport, there was a three-stage process. First, their alpha guardian or mate had to make the initial application, which Castiel had done online before they left the cabin. Following that was an interview for the alpha who submitted the application. Castiel had to make excuses of why he was leaving the estate in order to attend the interview, while he locked Dean into his suite in order to keep him safe.
Dean’s eyes shot open wide. “Me? I was surprised I wasn’t sent directly back to Hell after I died, and you think I’m worthy of being an angel?”
Castiel nodded. “You saw what life was like in those omega foster homes when we went to visit them. We can give them all a better life.”
As soon as he was free, Dean got up, pulled the IV from his hand, and wiped himself as clean as he could with the bedsheets. The alpha looked a little disgusted but said nothing. Dean dressed as quick as he could in the sweats and sneakers the alpha had given him.
Castiel smiled at him, emotion welling in his eyes. “I know, Dean. Weren’t you listening? It was
The last few spanks were the hardest yet, and Dean yelped at the sharp sting of them, tears stinging his eyes. “Ah, there it is. Nothing makes me harder than to hear an omega cry out.” Castiel punctuated his point by grinding his erection against Dean before helping the omega off his lap.
“You are not allowed to leave the property without permission. When I’m at work, you may spend time in the backyard, so you don’t always have to remain indoors. As your father must have told you, it’s not safe for you to be unaccompanied in public.”
Dean and Castiel try to get Dean's passport without raising suspicion, and then go and visit Dean's family before heading out of town.
“I don’t know if I’m ready to be a parent,” Dean admitted. “But I’ll do my best, if it’s what makes you happy.”
“That’s better,” Gabriel said with a sly wink which confused Dean. “I’ll come back after dinner to check up on you and the little one, alright?”
Giving a shrug, he nodded. “I mean, we finally have free will, right? It’s made me think about what I really want to do with the rest of my life. I never wanted to be a hunter, neither did Sam. Mom didn’t want this life for us. There are plenty of other hunters out there. So, yeah.”
“That sounds fair,” Dean said.
“I wouldn’t be thanking me just yet,” Castiel said wickedly, as he resumed fucking Dean. The angle of the thrusts changed as Castiel seemed eager to bring Dean to his orgasm, the man’s hipbones crashing painfully into Dean’s tender ass. No longer afraid of disobeying his Keeper, Dean let the pleasure build to a crescendo as that glorious dick kept pounding into him.
“I see all your papers are in order,” the clerk said. “Dean, do you know why you’re here?”
“Just watch me,” Dean said with a grin as he began to increase their speed, pulling away from the pursuing vehicle.
Castiel nodded. “Yes, Jack gathered the few that were left of the angelic host and discussed this with them. He also proposed a solution for the dwindling angel problem.”
“Got it.”
The demon disappeared from view again, before grabbing Castiel’s ass cheek. He pushed the hard plastic of the syringe into Castiel’s ass, making the angel flinch. The cool lubricant filling him was a strange sensation, but not unpleasant. Dean reemerged into his field of view a moment later, leering at his naked form. “If I had known you were hiding all that under that frumpy trench coat all these years, I might have jumped you a lot sooner.”
That’s when they heard gunshots coming from the house. Gabriel stopped in his tracks and Dean looked behind him to see their security escort running back to the house. “What the hell?”
“Yes, I like the sound of that,” Castiel said with a smile, as he dug into his food.
“They just called Oregon, in favor,” Castiel stated matter-of-factly, as he began to put more weight behind the spanks.
Once they were fully settled in the new house, Dean was able to relax and not worry about their safety as much. Castiel made sure they had plenty of security, especially with four adult omegas living on the property. The cousins were a mix of alphas, omegas and a couple of betas, who all were still young. The oldest cousin was eight. Dean’s pups were still too young. Their orientation wouldn’t be known until they were at least three or four.
When they got the signal to walk onto the stage, Castiel took Dean’s hand and they walked side-by-side towards the podium. They had spent the past week rehearsing exactly what they were going to say, all Dean had to do was remember what they had practiced.
“Dean!?” Castiel called out as his human friend sauntered into view. “What’s going on?”
“Did you meet any other omega at the estate that didn’t have a red ass?”
Breaking the kiss, Castiel took Dean’s hand and laid it over his own erection. “Do you want me, Dean?”
“Are they kicking again?” Castiel asked.
“Gabriel also made sure there’s pup formula as well, just in case,” Castiel reminded him.
“Wow, you got to name all three of them after our side of the family?” Dean’s dad remarked. “I’m honored, sir,” he said as he shook Castiel’s hand.
Gabriel began to wave at them excitedly. “Guys! You’re just in time! You gotta see this!”
The first omega schools opened a year after the amendment was ratified and Dean encouraged each of his brothers-in-law to enroll. “Trust me, knowing how to read is really going to open up your world. This will give you a chance to be independent.”
Dean took a deep breath, trying to calm himself as he started to follow the alpha again. He was led to an empty space in one corner of the room. The alpha rounded him and unhooked his cuffs from each other, and swiftly grabbed one of Dean’s arms. Before he comprehended what was happening, Dean found his right hand clipped to a chain above his head. The panic set in again and he swung wildly with his now free left hand, attempting to either punch or kick the alpha away from him.
“Yet, now you’re begging not to be separated from him?” the judge asked. “Why would you want to be with someone who abused you?”
The bailiff nodded.
. Not that he’d been listening all that closely regarding the details of his claiming.
Dean then felt a warm, wet cloth on his back as Castiel cleaned up his mess. “Come on, get under the covers and let’s get some sleep.”
Castiel looked so beatific in that moment of pure ecstasy, it almost made Dean want to cry.
Letting out his breath that he hadn’t realized he was still holding, Dean proceeded to remove his clothes, carefully placing them into the basket provided, while Castiel retrieved a pillow from the couch and set it on the floor in front of him. A flush of heat flared over his face when Dean slowly lowered his boxer briefs, revealing his rock-hard erection to Castiel. After Dean placed his underwear in the basket, Castiel merely nodded toward the pillow. “Kneel.”
“I remember,” Castiel said with a chuckle. “The aches in my back remind me every day.”
They arrived amid a flurry of media outside of the courthouse. Castiel’s personal lawyer met them and the security detail shielded them as best as they could as they were lead inside, Dean clutched Castiel’s hand tightly as they made their way through the crowd. Castiel’s lawyer had been working with the prosecution and made sure he was informed of anything that might be a possible concern or complication.
“I’m so sorry. I’ll do what I can to create better memories in the future then.”
With a wicked chuckle, Castiel gave Dean’s ass a hard slap while thrusting in even harder. “Wishing you had waited to come, aren’t you pretty boy?”
“Oh yeah, right,” Dean said as he adjusted Sammy, so he could latch onto his nipple. “I didn’t even think about that. That makes you a grandpa, dad!”
John rubbed his face with his hands and sighed. “What I’m about to tell you cannot leave this room. Dean, can we trust your alpha? Are you sure he won’t snitch?”
Dean’s heart began to race with fear.
“Yeah, they kept me chained up in Castiel’s old room,” Dean explained. “At least I was treated well, despite being a prisoner. I’m just lucky Castiel was able to get me out of there before the pups were born.” Dean went on to explain what his fate would have been if his father-in-law had his way.
“Jack!” Dean exclaimed with a bright smile, reaching out to pull him into a hug. “How’ve you been? So, you made Cas an angel again?”
Time passed, and they settled into a comfortable routine. Without Chuck pulling the strings, there weren’t as many creatures to hunt. So, Sam started working on his fitness and went out for frequent jogs, if for no other reason but to give the two lovebirds some much needed space.
Dean lay there as the pain continued to wash over him and that’s when he felt the rush of fluid. His water broke. The pups were definitely coming two weeks early.
“He calls them
“Thank you, Alpha,” Dean said gratefully.
“My very own father found out I had a crush on Dean,” Castiel continued. “He is the one who forced Dean’s parents to register him. I was not aware of this when I was told by my father to seek a mate on the registry. I did not learn of this deception until after I had already forcefully mated Dean.”
“Hey Castiel, I was thinking of maybe joining you guys today? I’ve been thinking of getting my mate some piercing as well,” Michael greeted.
“Hey, hey, hey, none of that,” Dean said, reaching up to wipe away the tears. “What’s wrong?”
Castiel reached down and pulled the blankets over them. “Get some rest, my love.”
Dean hadn’t dared dream about this, always pushing the images to the back of his mind, but the moment Castiel’s lips brushed his, Dean melted against the former angel. His heart soared as he let Castiel kiss him. It was both soft and fierce at the same time.
Castiel broke the kiss and noted the time. “We need to get back or we’ll be late for dinner. You don’t want to find out what happens if we’re late.”
Castiel smirked before moving off to get the dishes. “Yes, sir,” he said a bit sarcastically. “My father would have a conniption if he saw me following orders from an omega.”
John began to explain everything that Chuck had told him.
Being praised like that made Dean feel all warm and gooey inside. It made him want to keep being a good boy for his alpha. “I think your father’s fears regarding your behavior were unfounded. You have been nothing but well-behaved for me so far,” Castiel said, running his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Right now, I want you to speak freely, so we can discuss some things. You need to understand the rules of my home, and I will answer as many questions as I can.”
Dean brought over the food and served each of them before sitting down with Cas. “That’s where this whole
Crawling onto the bed and centering himself on the towel, he presented his hot, throbbing ass to Castiel. “Fuck, your pretty ass looks so good like that,” Castiel said with admiration. “Scoot back, I want to be standing when I take you.”
Once out, Dean noticed that only his new father-in-law remained outside with them.
“I needed to get you away from Sam,” Dean replied nonchalantly, his eyes flashing black for a moment. “The only way Sam could turn me back to human would be with your help. I don’t want that to happen.”
Dean’s birthday had been three months ago, and now here he was, all trussed up for his
After Gabriel released him from his chain, Dean made his way into the walk-in closed and grabbed some of the maternity sweats that been stocked a few weeks before. He was tempted to put some shoes on, but there was no way he could reach his feet anymore. “Here, I’ll put those on for you, once you settle into your chair.”
That’s when Castiel began to fuck his throat in earnest, his balls slapping against Dean’s chin. When the alpha’s knot began to swell, it hit against Dean’s plush lips, but the alpha never pushed it past them. Soon, the knot was fully engorged and Castiel was fucking into Dean’s throat frantically, chasing his pleasure. A few more wild jabs, and Castiel’s hands gripped Dean’s head tight as he shoved his knot right up against Dean’s lips and cried out.
“Great, just what I need, a panicker,” Dr. Kadinsky sighed. “Orderly, bring over the oxygen.”
“At the Novak estate, trained, obedient omegas are still required to get…
. Castiel began raining down the spanks on Dean harder and faster than normal and Dean whimpered. It was such a combination of pain and pleasure his head didn’t know which way was up.
“Nah, they’re fine,” Dean reassured him. “I’m sure they can feel how happy I am right now, to be back and safe in your arms, filled up with your knot.”
“Just let me know when you need to work on her, and I’ll make sure it’s included in your schedule,” Castiel readily agreed. “As I said, she’s your property. I won’t take her from you. You let me know when you need something for her maintenance, and I’ll supply it. Okay?”
When Dean tried to buck back and meet the man’s thrusts, he was given a sharp spank on his thigh. “Stay still and take your fucking like a good boy.”
long time,” Sam confessed.
Dean did as he was instructed, while feeling shamefully exposed as his legs were spread wide. Gabriel poked and prodded at his hole, spreading it apart with his fingers as he shone a small flashlight inside. “You’re almost there. Your birth canal has dilated to eight centimeters and once you’re at ten, you’ll be ready to start pushing.”
Dean followed with reluctantance. His heartrate spiked as they neared the judge’s chambers, afraid something else bad was about to go down. At least the pups were in safe hands and he knew Gabriel would make sure they remained safe.
Dean looked at the alpha and realized that he might not have gotten himself off the entire time they’d been at the cabin. He couldn’t recall hearing Cas masturbate. Dean sighed and agreed, turning around and pushing his ass out while bracing himself against the wall again.
“What? What is it? Can you fix it?” Dean said in a moment of panic.
When Castiel pressed a gentle kiss on top of his head, Dean looked up and let himself be kissed senseless. This time his mind was quiet, and he lost himself in the moment. Slowly his arousal made itself known again, and he was absentmindedly grinding himself against Castiel’s hip.
“I’ll just stick to the truth, Cas,” Dean said with a shrug. “I’m fine talking about everything that happened.”
Looking around, the room was a decent size, with a large, cozy king-sized bed, a couple of dressers, and a large dog cage set up in one corner. There were two additional doors in the room. Castiel showed him the one on the right first, which turned out to be a large walk-in closet. It was only half-filled with clothing. “Set your bag on the shelf and you can unpack later. There’s plenty of room for your things, and since you’ll spend most of your time nude, you shouldn’t need much.”
“CAS!” Dean exclaimed with joy, running over to his friend, pulling him into a tight hug. “He did it. He really did it.”
“Both and Neither!” Gabriel exclaimed.
Nodding, Dean obediently opened his mouth. Slowly the cock was pushed deep into Dean’s mouth and down his throat. Remaining still, Dean let the man use his throat, doing his best to cover his teeth to avoid another punishment.
“Did you always love your alpha?” the man pressed.
Dean sat down on the pier, taking off his shoes and socks and dangling his feet into the water.
After about twenty swats Castiel paused. “How are you doing Dean? Your ass doesn’t seem to want to redden very quickly. Currently its barely pink so I need to keep going.”
They found the limo waiting for them and Castiel held the door open for Dean to climb in first. As soon as Dean sat down in the dark interior, something felt off, but before he could even bark a warning, someone was holding a cloth over his mouth while someone else closed the door shut before Castiel could get in.
“You know how to drive?”
Hopping behind the wheel, Dean soaked in the smell and feel.
“Fine,” Dean sighed. “But right now, I just want some peace and quiet. I’ll be out by the pier for a bit, if that’s alright by you,
Dean sat down and pulled Castiel into an embrace. “Hey, it’s okay. I believe you. C’mere. It’s okay.”
I hope everyone is still enjoying this story. I can't promise I'll keep posting this quickly, but I've felt very inspired by this story so far.
“Were you ever shared with Michael?” the attorney asked.
Dean sighed with relief when he felt the knot finally deflate and the alpha finally slid out of him. Before stepping back, he pushed the plug back into Dean. “We can’t let all that seed go to waste,” he tutted as Dean groaned in protest.
“I knew I was safe as long as my pups were still inside me,” Dean explained. “However, he had plans for after they were born. He was going to take my pups away and give them to his son Michael and his mate to raise, with a claim that Michael had sired them. Sharing omegas, even after mating, is still legal and is done quite often at the Novak estate, so no one would question that.”
“How long were you planning to stay in this cabin with me? How long until your father calms down?”
Then something shifted just before Dean’s birthday. Suddenly, his dad stopped preaching about omega rights. Instead he praised the virtues of a good and obedient omega. The first time John had come to Dean and handed him the official Omega Handbook and told him to learn it, to learn how to be a good omega, it was like Dean had been punched in the gut.
“So, are you the big boss or something?” Dean asked with a cheeky smirk.
you want to get me today?”
“We’ll discuss the use of this space in more detail later,” Castiel said as he stood to one side. “However, I suggest you behave yourself if you want to avoid finding yourself down here too often.”
“Woah. Powerful sister. Demon?”
“I was an angel,” Castiel explained. “As much as I loved you, as far as I had fallen, I could still not be with you. Not the way I’d wanted to be.”
“Cas, after everything you did to me, do you really still think I want to be with you?”
“I just got off the phone with Gabriel. He said to stay put until my black eye is completely healed. How bad is it, do you think?” Castiel asked.
Dean was so distracted with his armful of items; he nearly didn’t see the man standing by the war table until Miracle barked happily at the figure. As he reached the bottom of the stairs, Dean looked up, saw that familiar head of dark, tousled hair, and that damned trench coat, and dropped everything he was carrying.
Dean laughed and blushed at the compliment.
he thought to himself.
They had also asked Martha to remain their nanny. When she agreed, Castiel pulled some strings to expedite her green card application into the US so she could remain with them after they moved back from Ottawa, where they had hired her.
“Maybe we could go to Canada together?”
That’s when the vamp who was beating on Sam grabbed Dean from behind, knocking him off balance, and he went down, losing his machete in the process.
“Oh yes,” Castiel said. “I included that because there are times when I come home from work and really need to blow off steam. That could just mean I need to have some fast, rough sex, but sometimes I might need to ask you to endure some pain for me.”
“Thank you.”
Castiel came closer and fingered his collar. “Do you…want me to get this removed? We’re mates already anyway, so it’s not like you really need this…”
Sliding an arm under Cas, Dean hugged the man tight and listened to his heartbeat, taking comfort in knowing he got his best friend back. Once more, he offered a silent prayer to Jack.
“I, Castiel Novak, claim Dean Winchester, as my omega. I promise to care for him and guide him. I promise to teach him to be a good and obedient omega. I will spoil him when he is good and discipline him when he is bad. I will make sure he always knows his place.”
… by Sheriff Novak. Yet, nothing he did could get the sheriff out of his head. Every time Dean jacked off in the shower, his mind went back to when he was bent over the sheriff’s car, hands cuffed behind him, and fucked against his will. Fucked until he’d had the best damn orgasm of his life.
“I dunno what you mean by snitch, but…” Dean looked at Castiel for a long moment. “Yeah, you can trust him.”
“Dean! Are you okay?” Castiel asked as he ran back over.
He really didn’t want to deal with all these stupid omega protocols either, but if he didn’t his father-in-law would most likely ship him to one of those damned training centers. Dean had heard about those before and he knew that if he thought what Castiel had done was bad, those centers were ten times worse.
,” Sam insisted. “I’m just… I’m thinking about Eileen. She’s been distant lately. I think she might want to break up or something.”
“Don’t move,” Castiel said. “I’ll go get Gabriel.”
“Yes, you were right,” Castiel sighed. “I’ll make arrangements tomorrow.”
“Don’t worry about that now,” the judge said. “I just really need to talk to you without your alpha in earshot, so I know you’re telling me the truth, not just what your alpha may want to hear.”
“I’m fine. You passed out last night. They brought us to a hotel so we could get some rest,” Castiel explained.
Well, that was a roller coaster to write! :) I hope everyone enjoyed that chapter. I'm not sure how much more story there is to tell, but there is at least one more chapter. Maybe more, depending on my muse and continued inspiration.
Okay, so he had the bed, the bathroom, and some books. That was far more humane than he’d expected from his father-in-law. Could the old man be going soft just because Dean was pregnant? Then Dean realized it probably wasn’t for him, but for his child. The grandchild that he carried was clearly precious to the crazy old bastard. Dean smiled as he realized that gave him a certain amount of leverage over the man he hadn’t had before.
“I want you to understand one thing,” Castiel said, his fingers suddenly gripping his hair tight. “I will not always be gentle with you. As an alpha, I have… needs. If you are naughty, I can fulfill those needs by punishing you. However, even if you are the best-behaved omega, I will still need to give you pain on occasion. Does that scare you?”
When Dean’s phone buzzes, he looks at it absentmindedly. Sam’s out on another date with the resurrected Eileen, Jack is still locked away in his room, and Castiel is who-knows-where. He sits up and takes notice when he sees the text is from Castiel.
“Yeah, my dad taught me. He would take me out to the back roads as soon as my legs were long enough to reach the pedals.”
, then after you get me out of the country, you can turn right back around and head home. Am I clear?”
Ok sure, Castiel promising to get his belly full of pups sounded hot when he was in heat, but now Dean felt a sense of panic. How the hell could he and Cas raise triplets?
Tears streamed down Castiel’s face as he shook his head.
“Well, there are a couple of things yet,” Castiel said. “The first is the use of cock cages. A fully trained omega, even one that’s mated, must wear a cock cage if his alpha doesn’t want him to be used by the other alphas in the household.”
Dean was nervous, but he wasn’t going to let people see him as a weak Omega. They were both going to speak today, and he knew he had to man up and speak his mind, which was not something he’d ever had a problem doing before. He just never had to do it in front of a room full of reporters or the millions of people who would be watching on live television.
“I really want to hug you right now,” Castiel admitted as he leaned his head against Dean’s. “I’m the one whose sorry. I failed you as an alpha and your mate. It’s my job to keep you safe…Dean, I’m so sorry.”
When dinner arrived, several servants set it up in what appeared to be a private dining room that was adjacent to the bedroom. The alpha helped Dean out of bed and led him over to the table. It had only one chair, and next to it a pillow on the ground.
“Please, sir…
Once Castiel caught his breath, he looked down at Dean with a bright, blinding smile. “Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said as he reached out a hand with two fingers pointed at his forehead.
Dean and Castiel curled up into each other as best as they could with their hands cuffed behind them. That’s how the sheriff found them when he finally got into his vehicle and began to drive. Dean didn’t pay attention to where they were going, he just assumed they’d be taken to the local jail until they could be extradited back to Kansas.
Dean sat in bed, his thumb wistfully caressing the tattoo on his opposite wrist. He recalled the conversation he and Castiel had on the way back to the estate after he had gotten it.
“Simply rolling your eyes warranted being beaten with a belt?” the prosecutor asked for clarification.
Dean was sitting on the floor rocking himself back and forth. “Man, I can’t stand the suspense. Only seven states haven’t been called and we can only lose one or the whole thing is off.”
“No, Dean. I don’t want to fuck you,” Castiel began.
“Only if you’ve been naughty,” Castiel reassured him. “You woke up there today because Mildred didn’t have time to keep an eye on you while you were sedated, and we didn’t want to risk you trying to run. You’re untrained and we didn’t know what to expect, so it was the safest option.”
Peppering Castiel’s sweaty brow with kisses until those blue eyes looked up at him, and Dean ran his fingers through the former angel’s perpetually messy hair.
As Dean paused at the pregnancy channel, interested in the segment on giving birth to multiples, the channel fritzed in and out with static. Dean groaned as he slowly rose and tried to shift the TV to improve the signal when the static cleared, and instead of the pregnancy segment he had been watching, there was a news reporter standing outside of what looked like some building in Washington, DC.
Dean had to wonder if there had been other
Castiel just doing an almost complete one-eighty, in the opposite direction of his parents, also baffled Dean. After being dragged by that man down into that damned
“That’s it, little angel,” Dean said as he gave him a wicked grin. “Your body is already accepting me as its master. Your mind’s not on board yet, but…
“Primarily to get away from my father-in-law,” Dean replied. “We also feared that the Anti-Omega Rights Bill would pass, and we knew that would mean he could get even more sadistic. I didn’t want to be living under the same roof as that man if that happened.”
Relief flooded through Dean as he slumped down to his shoulders on the bed. “Yes, sir. I won’t complain. Thank you.”
Castiel laughed, and Dean realized he had been joking. Hanging his head, Dean laughed along with Castiel, reaching over to give him a little good-natured punch in the arm. “So, that’s how it’s going to be, huh? Looks like getting a soul gave you a sense of humor.”
, Dean thought. Flicking his eyes from the collar to Castiel’s face, he looked into the man’s lust blown eyes. His heart still hammered in his chest, and his mouth felt dry, but he knew this is what he wanted. “Yes, sir. I agree to let you be my Keeper.”
The door opened and in came John and Sam. “It’s time, son,” John said. “Let’s get you to the altar.”
He wondered. Still, he pulled Baby over and walked out over a bridge overlooking a lazy river, taking a moment to enjoy the fresh air. That’s when he heard the flutter of wings behind him.
Dean took in a deep breath of fresh air and looked up at the cloudless sky. Thankfully, it was mid-summer, so it was warm enough for him to be led around completely nude. Gabriel set an easy pace as he led Dean along one of the garden paths that started near the patio. The guards kept their distance, but remained ever present behind them.
“Yeah, we can do that, just not right away. My father is going to be furious that I defied him. I need to lay low until he calms down. In the meantime, I was hoping you’d be open to a different approach in your training?”
Once Dean felt sufficiently calmed down, he turned to Castiel and asked. “Where the hell have you been, Cas?” He sat up and glowered at his mate, trying to stay angry at him but just seeing him again, Dean’s face almost immediately softened.
Dean allowed himself to relax against Castiel as they kept driving. “Where are we headed?”
Dean took Castiel’s hand in his. “Yeah, I am, Sam. It’s time we moved on from this goddamned life,” Dean said and then looked up. “Oops, sorry Jack. Look, I want another shot at
Castiel kissed him back fervently and this time around Dean happily allowed it. After they broke the kiss, Dean leaned his head on Castiel’s shoulder. “Thank you. I’m sorry I almost ruined everything a couple of weeks ago. I was starting to fear…”
Castiel reached out a hand, taking one of Dean’s, gently stroking. “For starters, I’d like to stay here with you, if you’ll have me.”
It had taken some convincing, but all three finally agreed to go.
Dean rose, rubbing his eyes as if he had been asleep. “Yes, alpha?”
Smiling to himself, Dean went back to the library and selected a book before making his way back to the bed. Making himself comfortable, he started to read. He knew all the while that he was being observed with all the hidden cameras and microphones everywhere.  Eventually, they’d have to send someone to check on him and feed him. Until then he could just bide his time.
As Castiel gently rubbed the aloe over his ass, Dean felt his arousal spike again. That was embarrassing.
“I don’t think they are close enough to hear,” Gabriel whispered. “I thought you should know, I still haven’t heard any word from Castiel. It’s been three weeks now and frankly I’m worried. I know you’ve been wondering as well. I debated telling you, but I figured you’d be stressing about it regardless.”
Castiel smiled. “This makes me very happy, Dean. I was trying to figure out how to bring it up. I don’t want to be a hunter either. Without my powers, I always worry. If you or Sam get hurt, I can’t heal you anymore.”
“Yeah.”
“Don’t you ‘
“Wait, what?” Dean asked in confusion.
“Ah, ah,” Dean admonished. “Don’t hurt yourself, angel. That’s my job.”
“I learned from you, and my mother, and Castiel, that… when people have to be their best, they can be,” Jack said.
“He was pissed that my dad had the nerve to grab you like that,” Castiel said. “But he knew he needed to be cautious. If he’d sent his men after you, that would have been reason enough to declare war and that’s the last thing he wanted to do.”
Dean is now five months pregnant and there has been no word from Castiel in weeks. After learning about his father-in-laws plans for him, Dean asks Gabriel to make him a promise.
Dean tried to remember how to answer the questions based off some brief coaching that Castiel had given him in the shower that morning.
Thinking about it for a moment, Dean slowly nodded. “Yeah, actually. Could you explain the difference between discipline and punishment, and what the heck is that bit about stress relief?”
The alpha was silent for a long time before finally responding. “There should be food where we’re going. It will take at least another hour.
Castiel then removed Dean’s cage and plug, before sliding the dildo into Dean’s ass. Dean groaned with pleasure. He hadn’t gotten aroused or masturbated since several days before his claiming, so this felt so much better than he remembered.
“Dean…”
Once back in the car Castiel turned around and looked at Dean. “Okay, so now you know I wasn’t lying about the passport. I am afraid Father might be suspicious if we don’t come back with…something. Would you at least come to the shop with me and look at a few items? Please?”
Castiel drove to the shop he’d mentioned, Omega Tattoos and Piercings. Dean rolled his eyes but kept is mouth shut as Castiel led him inside.
Dean huffed indignantly.
The last two pups were pushed out in short order, thankfully with no complications. The nurses who were part of the on-call staff each took a pup as soon as they were born, taking them to be cleaned and swaddled. Dean felt a sense of relief wash over him after the last one was wailing in Gabriel’s hands.
“It’s a long story,” Castiel said with a sigh. “I have been trying to get you back since the moment they took you from me. I swear I never once stopped trying. Dad’s political connections just made it…complicated.”
When their eyes met, Castiel’s hips stuttered to a stop. He leaned forward, grabbing Dean’s hands, and pinning them over his head. Grinding his cock inside of him, Castiel’s breath came in ragged gasps that Dean could feel puff against his face. Castiel’s eyes flicked between Dean’s eyes and lips, while grinding even deeper. Dean let out a needy whine and Castiel leaned all the way forward and captured his mouth.
“Dean?” Castiel asked with a groggy voice.
Dean was currently feeding Bobby and Johnny, while little Sammy was in his bed waiting his turn. “That’s Samuel,” Dean indicated with a nod of his head as his mom walked over and picked up the little pup. “I’ve got Jonathan and Robert here.”
“Um, hey,” Dean said, to get the alpha’s attention.
“Yeah, Dean. We made it. We’re safe.”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, following Castiel.
“I would hope so,” Castiel said. “I think my brothers will be let off easier, but since I’m now taking control of Novak, Inc., they won’t be much of a threat to us anymore.”
“Is he going to be okay?” Dean asked. “His name is Nathaniel, right?”
Dean felt conflicted. Castiel had given him the pleasure he needed while he remained respectful and only fucked him with a dildo. He was keeping all the promises he’d made to Dean back at the cabin. Dean could feel himself start to soften towards Castiel. He didn’t want that to happen. He couldn’t forgive him for what he’d done to him…
“Thank you, sir,” Dean said as he picked up little Sammy.
when they arrived back at the estate. Dean came out of the bathroom and scowled at Castiel who was sitting on the couch waiting for him. “Are you absolutely sure this is necessary?”
“Alright, well why don’t you go set the table and we can talk over dinner,” Dean suggested.
Castiel pulled off to the side of the road for a moment and Dean was wondering what was going on. Then he realized that the alpha was crying. Dean felt the urge to hug him, so he unhooked his own leash and crawled forward, wrapping his arms around the alpha’s shoulders.
“And Dad,” Gabriel said, turning fully to his father. “I’m only allowing you to visit him during my weekly ultrasound exams. I know you’ll want to watch the pups develop, but your presence will be too stressful on Dean. You can watch him through all those damned cameras you have everywhere.”
After that, words failed them as Castiel slowly and gently slid his cock in and out of Dean’s channel. Dean lost himself in the ecstasy of pleasure that Castiel was giving him as his arousal grew and built. The feel of Castiel along his back, his hands caressing him, his mouth kissing and licking wherever he could reach, the wonderful feeling of being filled with his rock-hard cock over and over, slowly drove Dean to the edge. After so many months of denying his body it’s baser desires, Dean reached that edge and fell over it fast, screaming Castiel’s name as his orgasm washed over him in wave after wave of pleasure.
Castiel’s hand moved from the back of Dean’s neck and slid around to the side, where he began massaging again. “However, to mate an omega, an alpha must bite the mating gland here. This bite will hurt, because it must break skin so that I can ingest some of your omega hormones. This makes a permanent mating mark and binds alpha and omega together for life.”
“Well…it was kinda sweet…even if he was a complete asshole in how he went about it. I think he just wanted to see you happy.”
Castiel was nibbling on Dean’s ear. “Hmm excellent idea. I’d love to see you pierced. It’s almost a shame we won’t have time…”
This time, instead of kneeling on a pillow next to Castiel, Dean sat in the chair opposite him at the table. Dean had his own dishes and utensils, just like he’d had when he was growing up. He was struggling to wrap his head around how much his life had changed in such a short span of time. Many of the events were now fuzzy in his head because of how tired he’d been.
“I have put together a meal schedule for you, that will be good for both your child’s health and your own. Your first meal is being prepared now and should be up shortly. They’ll bring you a small table to use since the chain won’t reach the dining area.”
The alpha nodded. “That’s why I brought you out here. I was trying to train you based on his principles and it clearly hasn’t been working. He wanted to send you away to an omega training facility. Some place where they’d have no qualms in completely breaking you. I argued that I didn’t want you broken. Not like that.”
“He’ll stand trial,” Castiel replied. “He’s facing several counts of bribery of a federal representative and the illegal trafficking of omegas. After the bribe offered, it opened up the opportunity to do an investigation into all of his training facilities. A federal judge granted a warrant to search and seize all records and they found all the evidence they needed to put my Dad, my brother Michael, and the directors of each facility away for life, or worse.”
Mary then held a bottle of water with a straw up to Dean’s mouth and he drank from it gratefully.
Dean complied and was soon trying to relax under the hot spray. He was going to miss this shower, but not enough to justify staying in this house one minute longer than necessary. As Castiel came up behind him and wrapped his arms around the omega, Dean allowed himself to relax into the embrace. “Stop looking so worried. My father is going to wonder what’s going on.”
. When Castiel returned, he groaned at the sight. “Good boy, Dean.”
A moment later the court bailiff came towards them. “Castiel Novak? The judge would like to see you in her chambers.”
“Can you describe what happened the day of the press conference that your alpha held in Ottawa?” the prosecutor asked next.
Mildred held open the shower door for him, and he tried to indicate removing the gag.
Castiel kept up the steady rhythm of spanks slowly increasing the weight of the blows, until Dean just became a completely melted mess on his alphas lap. At no point did the spanks really hurt, it was just a continued increase in heat until he was completely lax.
(See the end of the chapter for
When the limousine finally stopped, the alpha kept Dean in place until the rest of his family was out of the car. Then Castiel stood, getting out first and tugging Dean on the leash behind him.
“Since Rowena is ruling Hell, Heaven and Hell are no longer in conflict,” Castiel explained. “Instead of fighting demon hoards, angels are now focused on tending to the souls in Heaven.”
“Good night father. Dinner was excellent as always. I’ll see you tomorrow,” Castiel said before leading Dean away, not waiting for his father to respond.
Before Dean knew it, he and Castiel were being helped out of the car and uncuffed. “Welcome to Canada,” one of the border patrol agents said, shaking their hands.
“Good. You keep that in mind before you ever try leaving here alone. If you somehow made it home safely, I would make sure you wouldn’t be able to sit for a month.”
“Now stand still and let me wash you. You’re my mate and it’s my duty to take care of you. Then you must wash me, alright?”
“Y-yes, Alpha,” Dean stammered, making his way to the bench, and letting Castiel help him onto the contraption. It held him in the classic breeding position, with his ass at the perfect level for the alpha, and his legs spread wide, while his head and shoulders were angled downward in supplication. Castiel even strapped Dean in.
“Yes, Father,” Castiel said. “I didn’t want an omega broken by those training facilities. I decided I could best handle his training by myself, in private.”
Dean obeyed, until Castiel’s hands halted him, grasping his hips, and running his hands over his hot flesh. “Fuck, you have the perfect ass,” Castiel praised, giving Dean a few playful smacks to his already smarting backside. Then Dean felt his plug being removed and set on the towel next to him.
“You feel so good around my dick,” Dean growled, leaning in to nip and bite at Castiel’s neck, his hips pistoning his cock harder into Castiel’s hole. “I’m going to be fucking this ass every chance I get. Not even sure I’ll want to share you. Not for a long while, at least.”
The next thing John knew, he was holding an armful of Dean.
Dean and Gabriel walked in front of the swings as well, ready to defend themselves and the pups. Martha shied back, unsure of what else to do. Dean’s heart was pounding, but he was ready to stand his ground and fight if he had to. The pack of alphas began to approach, raising their fists, when all of a sudden, a police siren sounded.
Dean thought as he played along.
Swallowing thickly, Dean handed over the brush. As he bent over Castiel’s knees, Dean felt all the blood rushing south as his dick decided it was very much on board with the proceedings. Dean didn’t know he had a masochistic kink before the sheriff had whipped his ass the last time he’d come through this town.
“Damnit, yeah, I am,” Dean said through gritted teeth. “You turned me into a perv!”
“Yes, alpha,” the omega replied meekly.
“You’re serious about this, aren’t you?” Sam said.
Sitting up, Dean forced himself to look Castiel in the eye.
Laughing, Castiel wiped his mouth and shook his head. “No, pretty boy. As much as I would love to redden your backside and ravish you twenty-four-seven, that wouldn’t be realistic. I am still the sheriff of this town, and I can hardly leave you chained up in a cage all day while I’m at work. At least, I can’t do that to you all the time. However, that may happen occasionally, if your behavior warrants it.”
“Hey, man, it’s okay.”
“Um, uh, well not since that sexy nurse back in Nebraska,” Dean recalled. She’d given him a
Taking Castiel’s hand into his again, Dean looked into the man’s still impossibly blue eyes. “I think I’m going to enjoy getting to know you all over again,” Dean said, waggling his eyebrows at Cas. “You know, I think Sam is going to probably spend the night at Eileen’s, so…”
“Okay, you get some rest, I’ll wake you up when we get there.”
“True, but I wasn’t,” Gabriel said. “Although, I do have to apologize for lying to you about Castiel. Dad was starting to get suspicious, so I had to make you think I hadn’t heard from him. Even on our walks, I couldn’t risk that there might be listening devices or cameras. He was always adding new ones everywhere.”
“Well I just don’t want it to have to happen again before then, understood?”
Dean watched in horror as the doctor grabbed Dean’s cock and inserted the end of the catheter tube into his urethra. The monster didn’t even use lubrication this time and Dean screamed at the burn as it slid down into his bladder. Soon urine began to flow through the catheter and collected into a sterile back at the other end of the tube. The process felt like it would last forever until the doctor felt that he had enough urine for whatever test he was going to run. Once the doctor was satisfied, he cruelly yanked the catheter out, causing Dean to scream into his gag.
“Remove them entirely. Omegas don’t need their dignity preserved,” the elder Novak growled.
“Yeah, that’s all true,” Dean agreed.
If you want to follow what I'm doing you can find me on social media:
Sam was knocked down, and that put Dean into overdrive. He managed to take another vamp’s head.
The angel shook his head and tried again. “This isn’t you. Please, let me go.”
“Is there anything more we can try to do? That vote is just a few days, isn’t it?”
Dean was confused as to why the attorney would bring that up now. “Well, according to current law, he didn’t rape me…so, no.”
“Thanks, John.”
“Hang on there, boys, I’m taking them in personally,” someone was shouting and running towards them.
good. Dean took several deep breaths to get himself back under control. “Yeah, a toy would be good…and…you can cum on me again if you want.”
“The bond didn’t fully take. Couldn’t you tell?” Dean asked. “I got through all my heats before just fine without you.”
Dean watched the alpha make his way back towards the bedrooms before getting up and clearing away the dishes from their small meal. After having been confined to a bed for nearly a week, he was keyed up and feeling the need to occupy himself with something.
“Yeah, maybe one day. Let’s just get our assess to Canada first. Then we can think about the future, okay?”
Dean fought and struggled as the man in the lab coat approached him with two burly alphas dressed in scrubs. They held him immobile, so he could be injected with…
“Yes, Doc,” Dean said.
Dean’s mother appeared, her own face tear-streaked, and she took a tissue and began to wipe away Dean’s tears, snot and drool from his face. “You did very well. I’m proud of you.”
Dean and Castiel had been in Canada for a month now. They were also still under protection and living in the fancy hotel suite that the Prime Minister had set up for them.
“Alright,” Dean agreed, as he stood up and made his way upstairs to retrieve the keys from the pocket of his jeans. Once upstairs, he went into the closet and reached into his jeans that were still in the basket he’d put them in earlier. Pulling out the keys, Dean stared at them for a long moment. The first wave of doubt hit him.
The alpha’s hands ran over Dean’s belly. “I got your test results back before you went up for auction. They showed that you are a carrier. In fact, it’s possible I already knocked you up, but you’re less likely to be impregnated outside of your heats.”
Nodding, Dean padded his naked behind back up to Castiel’s bedroom. Not sure which way he should face, he opted for kneeling sideways next to the foot of the bed. He was grateful that the man had plush and well-padded carpeting as he sank to his knees. His hands traveled up to his throat to fiddle and adjust the collar. It was a well-made collar and not just some cheap pet store kind.
“You were right, Cas. They’re focused on the Interstate,” Dean smirked.
So, Dean learned all the various kneeling positions and how to do them gracefully. Then they would go on hikes in the surrounding forest so he could practice walking behind Castiel exactly three steps, no more, no less. He even agreed to learn how to present for his alpha, just to show that he knew the proper form although he made sure Castiel knew in no uncertain terms that he was not going to get to mount him again anytime soon.
As Castiel pulled back, Dean took a breath through his nose, just before the man’s cock thrust back in, cutting off his airway. With his hands behind his back and his own cock ignored, Dean did his best to focus on breathing every time Castiel pulled back. Castiel set up a fast, hard rhythm that had his balls slapping Dean in the chin on every inward thrust.
“Yes, sir,” Dean replied. “Thanks for chasing those guys off. I was afraid they might hurt our pups.”
“I plan to also find employment,” Castiel explained, and Sam nodded in understanding.
, he chastised himself as he fished his phone out of his pocket and dialed the number.
A look of frustration crossed the alpha’s face before he made his way over to undo the restraints.
Gabriel was the only unmated son, having the luck of being born a beta. While Balthazar and Raphael sons weren’t involved in the training center operations, they still faced some charges of abuse against their mates because of the current Omega Rights laws that were in effect. All the brothers, except Castiel, had their omegas and pups taken from them and put into protective custody until after the trial.
That meant whoever had just bought Dean wasn’t even here. They’d bid on him remotely, and who knows where they lived. Dean had hoped to stay close to his family so he could maybe visit Sammy, but now those hopes were dashed.
“Like a freakin’ candy factory,” Dean groused. “I swear, mother nature sure has some sense of humor.”
The bailiff reappeared and approached Dean. “Dean Novak? You need to come with me?”
The judge looked up at him and seemed shocked at the state he was in. “Why are you trembling? Are you that frightened of me?”
“Castiel, why is your omega crying?” Dean’s father-in-law asked and Dean flushed with embarrassment and bowed his head lower.
Castiel knelt between Dean’s legs, while the omega spread them willingly, exposing his already leaking hole. Dean felt as the alpha teased a finger into him, making him moan as it slid in easily, his body willingly taking even that little bit of penetration.
This was really happening, he was being fucked by his angel, who dressed up and did a Dr. Sexy role play for him. There was so much Dean wanted to say, but before he could, Castiel began to move inside of him. The slow drag out and the hard slam back in had Dean seeing stars.
Now Dean’s cock was getting fully on board and it made his face flush hot. “Okay, joke’s over. I don’t have time for this.”
Dean handed Bobby to Castiel and pulled Gabriel in for a big bear hug. “Thanks man. Thank you so much!”
As Dean finally came back to himself, he realized that Castiel hadn’t knotted him yet and he just kept thrusting, even when Dean was well past the point of sensitivity. “Cas, Cas, stop a moment, please.”
“Okay, but I can’t promise I won’t ravish you again,” Castiel said, letting Dean lead him naked out of his room and down the hall.
Handing them over to Sheriff Novak, Dean couldn’t help but notice the enticing bulge in the sheriff’s slacks. Dean’s dick twitched again, and he knew he was soaking through the front of his jeans by now.
Dean couldn’t help the shudder that ran through him when he was called up to the auction platform. His dad had been eager to auction him off ever since he presented as an omega. All John seemed to talk about was how much money he could make at auction. Dean knew how important it was to his dad to be able to send Sam to a good university. Dean wanted that for his little brother. He really did. He just wished it didn’t come at the expense of his own life.
“I almost forgot,” Gabriel said as he pulled out something from his pocket. It looked like a life-alert bracelet. “Wear this and if you’re in any distress, push this button. It will alert me. It also monitors your blood pressure and heart rate so it will let me know if there are any other issues, even if you fall unconscious.”
Leaning back, Dean’s eyes went wide hearing that from Castiel, his seemingly innocent former angel. “Please don’t tell me you learned
Dean’s heart was still racing when they finally existed the estate grounds. “Thanks for the quick thinking back there, Cas. I thought we were caught for sure.”
Dean squawked but was too weak to really put up any resistance. The alpha made his way through the house and into a part of the estate Dean hadn’t seen before. When he looked around, he realized it was a large garage with at least a dozen cars.
before him. If there had been, did they choose to leave or did Castiel grow bored and send them packing? The man didn’t seem like he’d treat anyone cruelly, but maybe that came later. With all the sadistic equipment in the basement, it was certainly possible.
