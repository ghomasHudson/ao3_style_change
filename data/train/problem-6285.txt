"I'm-I'm sorry for calling you like this. But I just.. I panicked. I'm sorry about what happened. All of it. You were full of guilt and instead of sitting down and listening to your side and explaining mine I just expected you to understand the words I wasn't saying. I wasn't there for you, and I should have been. And while on my run, I just started thinking about you and us and how much I miss you. I.. I miss you, Tony. I miss you so much that sometimes I can't even focus or think or pay attention. There's a piece of me that will always be yours but that piece feels like it doesn't fit anymore because I jagged the edges. And then everything started piling up and I started to have a panic attack and you were the first person I thought of... thinking about it now this probably made you uncomfortable and I shouldn't have called. I'm sorry, Tony. I-"
Steve was gasping for breath. He felt like his head had just been released from being kept under water. The unsettling feeling in his chest contracted, worsening and lessening like he had a bad case of vertigo while on a carousel. His breath was visible, entering the crisp morning air and disappearing like a piece to the puzzle of the thick fog that surrounded the park. His morning run had turned into what felt like another situation where he was running for his life- except this time, the only thing he was running from was his feelings.
His panic attacks were rare, but when they occurred, they were strong. They felt harsher than almost any enemy Steve had faced in his hundred-or-so years on earth. This one in particular was shaking him to his core.
The use of his last name made Steve smile.
"Yeah, Tony?"
The dial tone made Steve flinch. It was dull, but there was a shrillness to it he could not describe. Maybe it was the sensitivity to his senses at the current moment, but he hated it. He hated the sound that made his breathing quicken. But, he quickly reminded himself that every ring was one ring closer to him.
It was a side he wanted to know more about.
“What the hell was that?” Steve demanded, hot on Bucky’s heels as he pushed his way into the bedroom Bucky had just entered.
“Easy there,” She smiled, hands raised in a mocking surrender, “What are you going to do? Stab me with your keys?”
There was so much blood and he was still shaking and fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
The guy behind him had regained his balance now and had his arms around Tony tightly, trapping him to his body. Tony kicked out at the guy advancing on him, kicking him in the gut hard enough to send him reeling back a few feet. Then his focus was on the guy holding him, umbrella trapped against his body. Tony lodged an elbow into his side. He wasn’t much of a fighter, but he was scrappy and fast. He threw his head back, hearing a crack from his attacker’s nose but his hold loosened, and Tony managed to slip free.
The second guy was on him again, but Tony hit out with his umbrella managing to get in a few shots before his attacker managed to grab the end of the umbrella, twisting it from Tony’s grasp with an ease that unsettled Tony before he was bodily forcing Tony backwards, ribs hitting the side of the kitchen island with a painful thud.
Tony shuffled from foot to foot, “Just tell me why I’m here, Steve.” There was an edge to his voice, an accusation hiding behind his words. Steve wondered how much he really knew. His mechanic was always as sharp as a pin.
Steve felt his blood run cold, “I’ll end you, Rumlow. I’ll carve the same ‘A’ into your chest as you did in those cops and I’ll leave your body out for everyone to see.”
Tony threw the sketchpad onto the bed next to him and scrambled out of the sheets, following in their wake. Whatever this was had Thor spooked and was urgent enough to have him barging into Steve’s room. It wasn’t going to be good news. Tony could feel it like a knot in his stomach as he raced after Steve in his boxers and stolen shirt, jogging down the stairs to keep up.
He moved onto his knees, letting Tony part his legs wide as Steve squeezed some of the lube onto his fingers. He spread it around generously, warming up the gel before tossing the tube to one side and moving his fingers to Tony’s hole. He circled the rim slowly before inserting a finger, feeling Tony tense around the intrusion for a moment. Steve waited, wanting Tony to be comfortable before he felt him relax and allowed his finger to move even deep inside of him.
“She was
Steve wanted to frown. Good for him? Tony had been taken and they were congratulating him on a new relationship like it was normal?
“I don’t know. Whatever he’s planning, it’s bigger than a few cop killings. This is a lot of effort to start a gang war.” Steve replied, “I had to protect you, Bucky. I had to try. Please understand that.”
Steve almost came right there and then. He drew his fingers out, feeling Tony shiver as it did so, a thin sheen of sweat already coating his back, “Okay, I want that too.”
“Then we find solutions.” Tony replied, getting up off the couch to stand with Natasha so he could see everyone properly, “I used to do this for a living, okay? Finding problems for mistakes at Stark Industries was literally my summer internship.”
Tony sighed, “Well that’s going to make Christmas awkward. You might have to let him get in a free shot to make him feel better.”
Steve wanted to tell him something good and reassuring but it would be a lie and Tony wouldn’t want it. He’d want the truth. Steve sighed, hands mindless soothing the skin of Tony’s shoulders, “No.” He breathed, “But it will get easy. One day you’ll wake up and realise you didn’t have that same nightmare like every other night. One day you’ll be able to look at the sight of blood and not think back to that room downstairs. You’ll be able to breathe a little better and sleep a little longer. You’ll be able to say his name without wanting to throw up. It doesn’t stop Tony, you just make room for it.” He paused, gauging Tony’s reaction. He nodded, like that was the answer he was expecting, “You’re a survivor, Ross tried to take that away from you and you told him no. I know you can survive this. Otherwise, even now, he still wins.”
“You’re really good.” Tony told him softly, “When did you learn how to draw like that?”
He pulls out plastic wrap, bleach and a bunch of other chemicals and gets to work, he hates having bodies in his garage. He moves the corpse onto the plastic and manages to wrap it up neatly to be disposed of before he starts on the bleach, smothering the floor in it to try and get rid of the blood stains.
“I don’t need pity, okay?” Tony replied, “I’m fine, totally. I just wanted to come and save you from your desk with pizza and maybe a movie?”
“I can make that happen.” Fury nodded, “I’ll be running the unit out of here, so you’d all need to stay together. There will be conditions, trackers to make sure you’re accounted for until you can prove your trust. I’m putting my faith in you, but it doesn’t mean everyone will. House arrest, maybe, for the first few months. I haven’t worked out all the details yet.”
“Fuck.” Steve swore and Tony had never heard him this vocal before, it sent pleasure pooling through him at the thought of Steve losing control over that as well.
“Hey, Steve?” Tony hummed, fingers weaving through his hair.
Tony uncurled slightly, fingers of his left hand twitching to reach for Steve’s. He waited patiently, not wanting to rush Tony. He had to be the one to make that move. He had to prove he wanted to fight this otherwise he’d already lost the battle Steve knew was ahead of him.
Eventually Steve had to call him out on it, the worry eating at him with every passing day. Tony had looked up at him with such shock that Steve had even noticed and adoration that he cared enough to voice his concerns that Steve wanted to bring Howard back from the death and punch him all over again. They went to bed that night with things a little easier between them, Tony actually slept, and Steve found himself drifting off soon afterwards without the worry of his boyfriend’s health.
“You have no idea,” He replied through gritted teeth, “Rumlow’s coming for everything you have. You think this was just about a few lousy cop killings? This is bigger than you know and when he comes for you, I hope you beg him for mercy.”
They were meant to start at midnight and it was at least seven minutes past that now. If there was one thing Steve hated, it was tardiness. That was no way to conduct business in his opinion and that was what they were here for after all.
The report itself was even worse and Steve could feel the bottom of his stomach fall out as he listened to the news anchor give her report on him, glancing down at her papers every so often. She was stiff and her speech was clearly rushed in the channel’s haste to break this story whilst the citizens of Brooklyn ate their breakfast.
Steve’s eyes watched him the whole time, giving him his privacy but scanning over him to check he was okay. Tony didn’t know why he found it nice rather than uncomfortable, he wasn’t used to someone paying such close attention to him. Thor zipped around another corner in fourth gear as he handed Steve back his phone.
“Steve.” Tony whispered, closing the gap between them as Steve bounced on the balls of his feet. “Look at me.”
He reached out to hook his finger around the wire of the nearest earphone, pulling it free of Tony’s ear with a smile. He could hear the bass of the song as he pulled it out. Tony whipped round, instantly relaxing when he saw Steve smiling at him.
Tony gripped the letter opener tighter into his fist, muscles aching with the grip, “You’re wrong. I am a survivor.” He moved so fast he couldn’t remember making the decision. One minute he was looking at Ross, seeing the fear and panic reflected into his eyes from Tony’s own and then he was bringing his hand up, pushing the sharp point of the letter opener into the soft skin of the underside of Ross’ jaw, “And I do know how to use a knife. You find a soft point and you push.”
“Okay, so about that name?” Steve pressed.
Howard chuckled, “I owe you? I owe you nothing, you left. You walked out on this family and this legacy. Why the hell would I risk my business, and my life, to help you?”
The victory was clear in his face, he had gathered intel on Tony’s friends and identified them as his weakness. It was a smart move; he’d taken the time to learn about Tony’s daily habits rather than rely on Howard as a source of information. Rumlow wasn’t taking chances on this one. He wanted Brooklyn. He’d do anything to get it from Steve.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, no signs of anything being trashed or upturned. His dirty mugs still littering the side along with the letters he hadn’t got the chance to open yet. A carburettor still sat on the coffee table from where Tony had been tinkering with it the night before.
They split up as soon as they entered the compound, a maze of half constructed places and structural beams that made up Rumlow’s base at the shipment yard. In the war it might have been a hub of activity but it had been left to fall into disarray not soon after. Steve himself had never ventured down there; it was one of the few places he was warned not to go to as a child. The building was structurally unsafe, rot eroding most of the wooden beams that held the structure intact although it looked like Rumlow was planning to make it his permanent base because there had clearly been work to secure the building before he moved the bombs in. There were now metal pikes along the beams to reinforce the corridor walls and plastic sheeting up to block out the worst of the rot.
“You’re really not as bad as everyone thinks, you know?” Tony replied with a smile.
There was a knock on the door minutes later, but Tony didn’t register it, he couldn’t stop looking at Ross’ body near his feet, blood pooling under his shoes now.
But they were out of time.
Steve hummed, pushing the shirt up to his ribcage, “I could.” He agreed, dipping his head down to kiss the muscles of Tony’s stomach, “But I’m rather enjoying watching you squirm.”
“You know nothing about him.” Tony snarled.
Tony’s hips stuttered once, twice and then he was coming hard. His cum coated Steve’s thigh and he was shaking into Steve’s arm as he gasped into their kiss. He shuddered, rocking against Steve’s thigh to ride off the aftershocks of his orgasm and rested his head against him as he came down for the high.
They grappled across the ground, each getting in their own hits as they went. Steve blindly looked for his gun, but it was across the other side of the room and he had no hope of getting to it.
“Light’s green.” Bucky grunted in the passenger seat, pulling Tony out of his thought.
Steve nodded, “I know, Hawkeye. Listen to Murdock, don’t say anything, okay? They won’t find a file on you because you don’t exist. No trail, electronic or paper. Give me two hours tops, I’ll get you out.”
Tony sighed, sipping his coffee, “You know we can’t have a cat here, right? Unless he can hold a spanner?”
“We’re still waiting on Sam and Clint. They were patrolling the shipment yards today. Trying to find Rumlow’s operation.” Natasha told him softly, crossing her arms over her body.
“Spitfire?” Tony repeated, “Are you comparing me to a plane?”
Steve glanced at him knowing he had just been played, “Of course I am.” He huffed, “I’ll head back tomorrow, Thor. Can we make sure a detail is set up for Rhodes and Peter?”
“I’ll make sure if I go down then you’re coming down with me. Two empires crumbling to dust in the city that we once called home.” Steve spat out.
Steve hummed around Tony’s cock as if to respond to him and it drove Tony crazy, the vibrations on his sensitive skin almost had him bucking off the bed in a move that surprised Steve but he held him down firm. Tony threw a leg over Steve’s shoulder instead, bringing Steve in closer to him as his heel dug into Steve’s back.
Sam spoke up then, “I’ll do it. We’re both A positive. We got tested in the army, it was the first thing we bonded over when we met. The only thing we had in common.”
Steve was clearly thinking along the same lines.
Sam already had a drink in front of him as Steve slid into his usual corner seat at the bar. Falcon’s was Sam’s day job after coming back from serving in Afghanistan and explaining to Steve he wanted something normal. Steve understood that much and helped Sam work out the details on buying and opening up his own bar. It was right in the middle of his patch of Brooklyn, all dark wooden panels and warm interior. Sam had designed it himself, shelves of alcohol lining the back wall and a wraparound bar in the centre.
“He did. He’s pretty bad, won’t let anyone near him. I think you’re the only one he’ll talk to right now.” Fury sighed, “This is bad, Steve. When I offered you the job this wasn’t part of the plan.”
He had a flat above it as well as a bedroom at Steve’s because he knew sometimes Sam liked to be alone and other times he didn’t. He had a hard time dealing with being back and Steve knew he was still ashamed to get nightmares about his time in the army. Steve always offered him an ear but Sam refused, Steve carried his own troubles and they weighed him down enough.
“It’s the middle of the night.” She pointed out.
He opened the condom wrapper with his teeth, rolling it onto his length before coating it in more lube. Tony would say he didn’t need it, but Steve knew he’d be even more sensitive in the morning without it. Steve lined his cock up with Tony’s hole, tip pushing against him gently as Steve slipped an arm under Tony’s body to cushion his head and placed a large hand on his hip to steady him.
Tony scoffed, “Because that’s what you do in a relationship.”
Steve wanted to say they’d make time. That nothing was more important than this but he knew Tony was right, “I have an exit, you need a ride?” He asked instead, couldn’t resist the teasing in his voice at having Tony safe and back with him.
“Do you have a death wish?” Fury snapped as a greeting, “Ross is watching my every move. I can’t take your calls.”
"You always told me war wasn't about winning or losing. It was about power. Who has it and who wants it." Sam responded with a shrug, "I'll go into another warzone with you if that's what it takes to make sure Rumlow never gets it."
“He’s losing a lot of blood, Steve. He needs the bleeding to stop and probably a blood transfusion.” Bruce told him.
"And what are you suggesting I do for a few hours?" Steve asked with a raised eyebrow.
They were both panting, but Tony was pushing his heel against the edge of Steve’s jeans as if that would remove them quicker.
Fury looked weary, dark circles under his eyes than made him look ten years older. Steve knew how that felt, “Tony hasn’t been officially charged. Ross is talking to him now, probably wants Tony to testify against you. Natasha and Thor are being processed downstairs.”
“How are you going to do that from a cell, Steve?” Rumlow asked, “You get a choice here, death by fire or death by water.”
Steve nodded, “All this from me putting my hand on your ass in public?”
Tony sucked hard against his nipple, feeling Steve buck up against him feebly trying to get some friction.
Steve was panting, hands into fists against the ties. His eyes were screwed shut, hips stuttering against Tony mouth was he sunk back down on Steve’s cock, making sure to swallow around him.
Tony nodded, “Sounds good.”
Steve grunted, “No, it’s just a graze. Bullet barely touched me. It stings more than anything.”
“Okay.” He smiled back, “We need to talk to the others, get them onboard. Sam has the bar so he might want to stay. Bruce too, he’s put his life into the clinic. He wouldn’t want to leave it.”
Steve sighed; Sam really was like an old housewife that lived on gossip. He ignored the message, moving onto the next one from Bucky:
A small pool of blood caught Steve’s attention and he made his way over to it, crouching down to take a closer look. It wasn’t enough to be alarming, but it was enough for Steve to know whatever struggle had taken place hadn’t ended well.
Steve felt his own cock ache at the thought, “Jesus Tony.” He sighed, giving his cock a squeeze before withdrawing his hand.
“I’m not my father.”
The Captain frowned, tearing into it and reading the note inside. There was a single line written on a piece of card in black marker. The handwriting was scruffy but it was clearly an invitation.
He was dead in minutes. It was a waste of ambition and stupidity and Steve almost wanted to mourn him.
“Why do they think it’s you?”
There were not good people, but the world had made them that way.
“Right, but the one thing all those kills of yours had in common? They were bad people. I’m not saying you’re the good guy in this story but you are trying to make Brooklyn safer. So, I don’t think you want Hydra running around anymore than I do.” Fury stated and Steve was really starting to hate this guy. He was just being cocky now and that was normally Steve’s role.
Steve woke up with the sun. Old army habits die hard. It took him a moment to remember where he was, expecting to be in his own bed but the curtains over the window to his left didn’t belong to him. There was a scorch mark towards the bottom like they had once been accidently set on fire. It was the warm press of the body next to him that brought Steve back to the events of last night.
The silence afterwards was just as bad, the awkward tension that no one knew how to break. Tony shifted his feet, “Well, I guess I made an impression?”
Steve nodded, “I’ll handle Rumlow.”
“Tony,” Steve breathed out in a pained whisper whilst everyone else became distracted in their conversations. He has closed the distance between them now, catching Tony before he left the room completely. He caught Tony’s fingers in his palm, warm and callous, “Can we talk? Please?”
He took gentle care to dry and bandage Steve’s side once they were out, fingers running over his skin softly. Steve hummed happily as Tony worked, planting little kisses along his bicep as he finished the job at hand.
Steve turned in that direction, “Alone?”
“Cap, we have a situation here.” It was Clint’s voice, tinny but firm.
Fury pressed the photo closer to him, “This is PC Bennett. A good man, wife and two kids at home, been on the force for five years now. He was murdered this morning.”
“Where did you find that mechanic anyway?” Steve asked, trying to be subtly but the mention of Tony brought back thoughts of their kiss and Steve’s desire to know more.
He drained his coffee in seconds, having perfected the art of making it at just the right temperature so he could down it in one go. As soon as the coffee hit his system, he felt more awake and went off for his shower, hoping the warm water would ease the protesting muscles of his lower back and legs.
Instead, his eyes found a black sketchpad resting on the armchair tucked into the corner of the room. He couldn’t resist picking it up, getting to know another part of Steve. He knew he sketched, they had talked about it in passing but Tony had never actually seen Steve’s work and he was curious. The pad was rich leather and A4 in size. It was probably a gift from one of his family members.
He hated being late.
It was smart, slipping Steve the device so no one would notice it. It also left Steve slightly aroused and more than a little confused. Tony had said he loved him, but Steve knew he had hurt him and that alone had probably ruined anything they might have had together even if he did manage to get out of there. He’d retrieved the device from the waistband of his pants, turning the little box over in his hands. It would be easy to break the lock, he trusted Tony’s design, but then he’d have to dodge being caught by police and navigate his way through the station before he was free. The morgue would be the best option, he knew the layout from when he went to visit Fury and see Coulson’s body. There was a service exit he’d used. It would probably be unmanned.
“Tony?” Steve said although it sounded more like a question. He looked tired, Tony could see the dark circles under his eyes and the paleness of his skin. It looked even more washed out next to all the orange he was wearing.
Steve wrapped his other hand over Tony’s, that was currently gripping the edge of the desk for leverage, both their knuckles going white and forearms shaking with the effort it was taking to keep them in this position.
“Hi.” Steve replied, voice equally low and unsure.
He wondered if the other residents knew a gang lived in their street. Did Steve smile at his neighbours when they crossed paths? Or did they cross the street to avoid him? Tony shook his head, it was Brooklyn, people weren’t exactly that friendly to begin with.
He pushed the cell door open a little more, delighted to be stepping closer to his freedom. His hands were still cuffed so he’d need to do something about that but first he needed to ditch his clothes. The bright orange would give him away instantly and if Steve was going to do this he needed to blend in.
Tony was in front of him receiving the same treatment, his eyes boring into Steve’s. He looked scared although he was doing his best to hide it, a steely gaze and a set jaw. Every bit the survivor.
A few days after Howard’s funeral, Tony called a press conference for Stark Industries, inviting the world and its media to attend. Steve had wanted to be there for him, to show support for his first official press conference as the new CEO but thanks to his house arrest he could do nothing more than sit at home and watch the conference broadcast on television like everyone else.
“Twelve more to secure my seat. Focus on Everett, he’ll be an easy turn for you. Hill will be slightly harder, she’s stubborn but if we get her vote then we win the vote of her whole party and I’ll have the majority.” T’Challa told him, eyes on the guests as he spoke.
Another scar, running along the width of Steve’s left inner thigh. The line was thinner than the one on his hip, the skin white and healed over. It was older than the first one.
He couldn’t change into them until he got the cuffs off though and that was his next problem. He was debating breaking his own thumb just to slip a hand out when the door opened, and Rhodes strode into the locker room. He was shrugging off a suit jacket and frozen when he saw Steve, blinking like he didn’t believe the image in front of him.
Steve understood his silent plea to stop talking about it and nodded, “What do you want to talk about?”
“Today, I give you that answer.” Tony continued on the screen, eyes darting across the mass of people in front of him, “We are no longer a weapons manufacturer. From now on Stark Industries will be a pioneer researcher for clean energy. That’s our new focus.”
“Steve…”
When the door did finally open, it wasn’t food that Rumlow brought with him but a large trolley that he wheeled in front of him and parked against the wall. It almost looked like a metal gurney and if it wasn’t for the sheet draped over it oddly, as it rested over the objects already on the trolley, Tony might have worried Rumlow planned to wheel him out in a body bag.
“You have no idea.” Steve laughed, “Tell me about it?”
“I got pretty good at being a hostage in the end.” Tony replied, “Learnt a few survival skills. I am bringing down this whole mood though so let’s change the subject.”
Bucky frowned, “Where are you going?”
"We're talking about war, Buck. A turf war, a cop war." Steve replied.
The sound of his phone buzzing from the pocket of his jacket somewhere on the floor was what brought Steve back to reality. He’d been out all night, something that he never did. His family were probably going out of their minds with worry that something had happened to him.
“I don’t really. Fixed his car once when he got a flat tire, told me about this place and said I should check it out. Been coming here ever since.” Tony shrugged, “I don’t drink much anymore, just been a long day.”
Tony pulled back from the kiss, lips moving to suck at the underside of Steve’s jaw, just below the line of his beard and Steve felt himself shudder from the attention. His fingers slipped under the edge of the black tank top Tony was wearing, rough fingertips meeting smooth skin as Steve followed the line of Tony’s jeans round to the small trail of hair at his navel.
Steve shook his head. Ross was Hydra? When, for how long? Is that why he’d been so focused on getting Steve to trial. Why he didn’t want Fury in charge of the immunity deals and why he was reluctant to take Steve’s offer in the interview room. He was never going to play that card because he was in business with Rumlow.
Steve stretched his fingers out further, “You can. Just take my hand and hold onto me.”
Tony watched in shock as Bruce pulled up Clint’s jacket and shirt to reveal the gunshot wound, sluggishly oozing blood down his stomach. He pressed against the skin with gentle hands and Clint swore.
Tony did a double take.
Now though it seemed Ross was bored and wanted to play. Steve was herded into the room, escorted on all sides like an animal as the cops shoved him into a chair and cuffed his hands back up to the table.
Clint watched him as he pulled out his chair and made himself comfortable, the lines on his face were stern and Clint could tell, even without the eye-patch, that this guy had seen some shit. Hadn’t they all?
When he was younger and Howard was in one of his drunken flashes of anger, his mother would hide him in the small cupboard on the second floor of their house. It was used to store clean sheets and towels and only the maids ever really acknowledged its existence. Howard certainly didn’t. So, when Tony was eight or nine years old and his mother was still alive, she’d rush him into the cupboard. Howard’s voice would be shouting for her in some other part of the house as she pushed Tony inside and told him to lock the door. He wasn’t to come out until Jarvis gave the special three taps on the wood to let Tony know it was safe.
“How are you going to persuade him to do that?” Bucky asked cautiously, “Friend or not, he isn’t about to let you have a talk with a criminal because you ask nicely.”
“Clint still needs to stay low in case the cops are still watching him,” Bucky pointed out, “Nat and I will be fine. We aren’t children, Steve.”
Steve was in no mood, “Grab Thor, head to the docks. I want eyes on Hydra’s base of operations. You call me the second you see Rumlow, okay?”
“I’ll try to return the favour.” Steve promised, guiding Tony out the door.
Tony wanted to throw up.
That was when Steve did another thing he normally wouldn’t have done. He knelt down, a move he normally would have avoided because it opened him up to weakness, it was almost like a move intended to worship and Steve Rogers didn’t worship anyone.
“I want you. I want whatever future that means we’re together.” Tony whispered between them, pulling back only slightly so Steve could feel his heat, “And right now, I want you to fuck me over your desk.”
Tony smiled, “When do I ever do what you tell me to do?” He mused.
Tony swallowed them lump in his throat, “Were they ever…?”
“How am I meant to break myself out of here?” Steve asked.
Steve smiled sadly as her, Tony right next to him, “Brooklyn is our home. We’re coming back one day, we have to. I have to.”
He heard the floor creak in Nat’s room, someone had moved, “I’m sorry. I am. But you know I’m right. We’re mobsters, we don’t get a happy ending. You and me, they are going to put us in the ground together, but I can’t give you anything else. You know that.”
Fury nodded, “I am. Rhodes is off today. This is Dawkins from internal affairs. He just needs to get the facts so he can sign off the report and make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary about this one.”
“You told me I was on my own,” Steve replied, “I couldn’t risk him sounding the alarm before I got out of there.”
“Bucky is watching his back.” Natasha replied, “They’ll meet us at the house.”
“I mean it. I’ve loved you since the first time we slept together and I stayed, and I woke up the next morning thinking I could get used to this. I’ve loved you and worshipped you and adored you. And even if you walk out that door now, I’ll love you still.” Steve told him, “But it’s your choice. It has to be your choice. It always should have been.”
“You were shot at!” T’challa said, his voice more alert now.
Tony hummed, “People will talk. Those papers seem to love reporting on my every decision. There was a buzz feed article the other day debating my choice of smoothie for lunch.”
“I didn’t think I’d be able to feel anything after… I didn’t think I’d be able to feel love or happiness or relief.” Tony sighed, “But I do. I love you, Steve. It’s still there.”
“You want immunity for them?” Fury replied, “For them but not for yourself?”
“How someone like you ends up with someone like him.”
Rumlow smiled, “See, I told you I can be reasonable. Missile first, then I want everything you know about The Captain. You’ll be back with your friends in no time, Mr Stark.”
“Something like that.” Thor mused, “The one I pushed out the door, perhaps would be more accurate.”
The guy in the middle cocked his weapon.
Steve stood up with a frown, hands cuffed in front of him though Rhodey hadn’t ordered him to be cuffed to the table as well. Tony was thankful for that; he wasn’t sure he could handle seeing Steve like that.
Bruce pushed his glasses up his nose, "I'll be on standby for a patch up. We don't want you winning the war with Hydra just to bleed out because you can't make a stitch."
Steve was in a state of shock himself. Tony had killed Ross? Why? He wouldn’t have done it unless he had to. Steve was sure about that; Tony wasn’t a killer.
“I didn’t want to spoil your fun.” Steve smirked.
“Because I believe you. I believe that you care about them more than yourself. I believe you want to make this city a better place, a safer one. I believe that Rumlow needs to be stopped and you’re probably the only person who can do it.” Fury said, “And I believe that you’re a better man than you think you are, Steve Rogers. You’re the kind of guy I’d want on my team.”
Rumlow looked scared in those last moments, a wild fear that had him shaking under Steve and fighting back with more strength than Steve thought he had.
It also meant Steve could see him again, and that was something he couldn’t help but smile at.
Steve groaned at the feeling of their dicks moving together, his only half hard from his orgasm and Tony’s rock solid and begging for attention.
“You asked me to come?” Fury replied, “Immunity paperwork?”
Tony turned in his chair a little more, angling his legs out towards Steve, “Did you really kill your old boss to take over his gang?” He asked, not in an accusing way but in one of curiosity.
Could he sign it himself? To be with them? Could he really march to Fury’s orders on this and pretend he had been working with the cops all along? It felt wrong, it went against everything Steve had done to get this far. Everything he had built up and fought for. Immunity was a dicey game; he knew that much. If things went the way Steve thought they would then there was no guarantee these deals would even hold and if they did there was no way they’d let the team stay together. Immunity and witness protection went together, and once Hydra was off the map the police would want to send the team off to different corners of America and separate them. It would be the smartest thing to do, they would be less of a threat if they were all on their own.
It’s difficult in a car and it’s not something Steve thought about beforehand but together they managed to move enough to get Steve’s pants down by his ankles and have his cock standing free and erect between them.
“You got blood on my knife.” She commented with a smirk as she took it back.
Steve crept a little closer, hand outstretched, “Yes, you can. Look at me, Tony. Just look at me instead.”
She was pushing him towards Tony. Steve didn't even want to know how she figured him out or about the fact she was giving him her blessing to continue whatever they had going on. Her eyes were unmistakable though. She knew more than the rest of them.
Steve frowned, “Fury, you son of a bitch.”
“Then you’ll go to jail, Steve. You’ll rot in a cell and never see your family again. Is Rumlow really worth that?”
“No, don’t touch me.” Tony shouted hoarsely, trying to make himself smaller, “I’m a monster. I’m… I killed him.”
The feeling of being untouchable.
Howard.
“Right. This might be my last chance to get closure, Rhodey.” Tony sighed, “I think I need that. I need to look him in the eye and let him know I’m going to be okay.”
“You’re going to give me beard burn.” Tony panted into his ear as Steve moved his lips over the mark again.
Bucky’s voice wavered and Steve felt his heart clench, “We could have worked it out if we tried, Nat. We could have left, gone somewhere just the two of us and been a family.”
Tony shook his head, eyes never looking at Rhodey once, “I had to.” He repeated.
Tony kissed him softly, silencing any part of Steve that might have protested. Just tonight. Just this. He needed this. Before everything fell down around them and he had to bring another heap of worry to his family. This last good thing before the storm.
"We don't have time."
Tony wasn't sure how to get ready for a fight, for a battle. He wasn't a soldier; he wasn't a gang member. He was a mechanic; he could make and invent with his eyes shut but using his inventions for an escape plan? That was new territory.
“I meant what I said last night, you know. I do want this. Whatever this is with you.” Tony told him; his words softer than he’d have liked.
Tony had shuffled closer, on the edge of his seat while they were talking and Steve knew he could close that gap in a second if he wanted to.
“No, not after the last one.” T’Challa replied firmly, “I’ve got the re-election campaign coming up in a few months. I can’t be associating with mobsters.”
“I’ll have someone get what you need.”
“Harder.” Tony pleaded, panting into the skin of Steve’s forearm.
Bucky was waiting for him in the hallway when he made it home.
Bucky didn’t meet his gaze, eyes dropping to the corner of paper Steve was doodling on, “Anyone I know?” He asked.
“So, you’re not going to walk me to my door like a gentleman?” Tony questioned.
Steve was instantly pulled out of his thoughts when he noticed Tony’s door wide open, immediately his body went stiff and he was reaching for the gun he kept tucked in the waistband of his jeans.
Steve stalled, blue eyes torn and searching for the right thing to say, “If you want to be.” He said, words for Tony. The double meaning was clear.
“Right,” Tony nodded, “Good riddance and all that.”
Well, nearly every bad thing.
Bucky had come through for him and not even an hour after he had received a call from his right-hand man, Steve was heading out to the location Bucky had given him to meet them. Natasha was with him, refusing to let Steve go alone despite his direct orders otherwise.
“It’s Hydra, I should have trusted my gut from the beginning.” Steve replied harshly, not slowing down his pace.
Tony wiggled against him, effectively regaining Steve’s attention, “Stop teasing me.”
Clint bit his tongue at that. Steve was coming for him. Less than an hour and Steve was nothing if not a man of his word. He kicked his legs up on the table, making a show of settling in for a long night and in his head he started counting the tiles on the ceiling.
Tony investigated those villains that police shown him, he finished wondering around a closed warehouse with new cars in the back. Very suspicious of a forgotten place. He entered the next store that looked more like a house, with a window where sunset could be watching. For an unknown reason, Tony sat in a corner, looking at the sunset and taking a breath. He was about to jump on the bad guys and he didn't want it. Something was missing and Tony knew was what it. When he was to stand up, a red thread sprouted from his reactor and rolled through the walls.
"You're my lighthouse, Cap", Ironman tightened his shoulder, and Steve swore that he almost felt so calm and relaxed, "Without you, I'll be lost as well."
"And be the best heroes together."
"Are you… did you see it, right? Our red thread."
"He is only a human."
When the whiskey was run out from his body, Tony thought in Captain America, how would be if he trusted instead on him when Cap's intuition was telling him that they were inside a web, HYDRA's web. The man always trusted in Ironman's decision even when it involved risks or the critics of other Avengers. Tony thought that he could do the same for once. Show him that their friendship was bulletproof. He could be with the super-soldier right now, chatting and drinking some coffee in the Avenger's mansion.
"Who are you?"
Nomad smiled and walked a few steps. "I think you could guess who I am, after all, we just fought together. You knew my moves as I knew yours. But if you can't imagine it, let me tell you. I am Captain America."
And while he was jumping, kicking, or being a hound searching for Viper's tracks, he noticed that his efforts had a lack of spark, meaning, fuel… At first, Steve thought it was his imagination. Sitting on a corner watching the people on the streets walked from one side to another whispering about how odd was Captain America nowadays -they didn't know his identity but they could sense that the man using the uniform wasn't the same when he was with the Avengers-, he felt empty on his heart. More than Sharon's absence, more than the shield or the uniform, more than the Avengers themselves. Except for one, the same who was flying over Shanghai fighting ghosts.
"You're not going to touch him" He growled.
"What…?"
"YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!"
"I disappoint him, Rhodey."
"I got you. I got you. You have to come back, Tony. Rhodey almost got killed for being Ironman in Asia. Please, let me…"
He counted the seconds that Ironman took to remove his helmet with trembling hands. Steve wanted to say something to encourage him but he remained quiet to respect the fact that Ironman was about to reveal his identity. Instead, he offered a warm smile, playing nervously with the mask in his hands. Steve's eyes open big when he discovered who was the yellow Avenger.
The next thing Tony saw was the famous Nomad breaking in the warehouse with Falcon. He didn't bother the help, but the read thread connecting with the heart of Nomad in that strong -familiar- chest. Nomad noticed too and for a few seconds that last an eternity, both looked each other with the read thread tensed in the wait for a mutual touch.
Ironman was back to business, leaving the read thread flying with him for later. Tony's heart was beating hard as his cannons roaring in the air before shooting.
"Ironman…"
Nomad raised both hands to take off the mask. "I am Steven Grant Rogers."
"Marvelous."
Steve remembered very well the day when Ironman was talking with him in a balcony in the Avenger's Mansion after a mission. Steve was disappointed with himself because he felt that he wasn't fit in the new world with new values and new technology. Then Ironman put a hand on his shoulder and told him that Captain America was the most important thing in the world because he was the mainstay of everything, especially in the modern times when everybody could get lost.
"Sweetheart?"
"Two sides of the same coin," Tony whispered to himself bitterly, "As always. I need whiskey now… I need to forget and find Gretl, damm."
Well, now he regretted it.
"Nomad! Duck!" Falcon shouted, pushing him to the ground.
There was a little chance that he overreacted at Captain America's words, and that made Tony think in how deep in his heart was the man. He even cared more for the old soldier than his own life -and choices by the way-, giving more weight at those words than his own beliefs. But that was because he founded out that Cap had something that Tony didn't, that optimism, will, and values to face the problems and the punches of life. The kind type that made his heart meltdown like ice cream and felt for a short time that he was a good man, a good hero.
One thing was sure for Steve, he will never make the same mistake. Not again.
"You will be disappointed."
Then, there was the Secret Empire incident.
"Thanks to believing in me even in this condition."
"Maybe if the real Captain…"
"Thank you, Rhodey. See ya."
He remembered those old times in the Army when all the soldiers learned to sew and have their uniforms always presentable. So, he put his imagination on the lead, and besides, Steve thought in what Ironman could think of his decision while he chose the dark blue fabric and the golden gloves. He got excited with the idea of making his suit, including a cape, smiling on the image of Ironman telling him the cons of using a cape while fighting the injustice and crime in Nueva York. Steve stopped for a moment when he realized that he was giving to Shellhead to much time in his mind.
Falcon didn't push and Steve gave thanks for that. The idea of think on himself as only a superhuman brought something else. And was Viper's fault.
"No, Pepper," Tony stopped, shaking his head, "You don't understand…"
"I can be distracted," Tony spoke to himself, "Ironman needs to come back. They need him."
"Captain America was here!" She almost screamed in his left ear, "He was looking for the thieves! I saw him!"
They avoided the main doors because Tony didn't have the mood to answer questions that he left when Obadiah sue him. Right now, he needed to be Ironman, to find Gretl and if everything didn't turn bad, search for his red thread again. But destiny was always an unknown path.
With a last look at the two knitted dolls, Steven nodded, taking Tony's hand and leaving the workshop.
"Nomad! Duck!"
Could be…?
"I have a Soulmate…" He whispered.
"Let me see your face, please."
"Is that true, mom?"
"It's okay, I'm afraid too, but… look at the red thread. There isn't a mistake here."
At first, Tony thought it was a trick of his mind because of the lack of alcohol. The possibility of a hallucination crossed his mind. He didn't deserve it, not at that moment of his life, not at any moment of his life. But the red thread was real for the five seconds it lasted, a peek of the wanted life Tony always wished all those years came to his eyes in the worst moment. He didn't understand why that happened, after all, he couldn't remember something different. Tony was looking after Gretl and he finished at the train station when a woman shouted.
"Who are you?" Tony asked with his heart racing faster.
There was a little chance that his search finally came at its end. As Nomad, Steve allowed himself to smile with the slight hope of having his Soulmate so close and so far at the same time. But if he could try, maybe his reward will be the last piece that his life needed so much. His ideas stopped at once when he saw Falcon in the roofs, hurt, and tied on the ground. One day, Ironman told him that they will never leave their identities as heroes because they were born in them, raised in them and no one else could fit their tracks in the same way as them. A flower can't replace another flower even if it's exactly at the other, precisely because it is something else, whispered Ironman while he was looking at a newspaper with the picture of the Avengers fighting HYDRA.
"I'M READY!"
"… you know? I'd never seen Captain America so mad with me."
"Shut up, Tony. If you are talking about Stane, I made some changes with the lawyers."
"Do you?"
"Come with me. There are many things to do, and you're the only one who can do it."
Tony smiled behind the mask. "Only if I can call you Winghead instead."
Just a little.
Falcon raised from the ground a newspaper picture of Ironman, stained with blood, marked with a huge X as a promise of being the next target. Red Skull thought that he murdered the real Captain America and now was after Ironman…
But Asia was too far from New York and Viper was moving faster than Nomad.
"That sounds fair to me."
She reached him by the shoulder, twisting and slapped him before gave him a tight hug with a sigh relief.
"I can't live without fighting the injustice or just let pass the bad things", Steve told to Falcon, "I'm sure that Ironman neither. And he taught me how the world could be without someone protecting it."
"It's funny how easily somebody can disappear from your life even if the person left marks on your soul."
"I am not…"
"Don't say such a thing. You were Ironman before me and after me."
Both laughed, looking at each other. They have a long way as Soulmates. Steve's hand took Tony's.
In the television, he heard about the missing of Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, apparently after problems with some demands and frauds. No one was sure, but now the former millionaire and genius were lost and the company was in Obadiah Stane's hands. Steve frowned, he didn't know what to feel about that because Tony Stark was something, he always reserved his opinion of him at Ironman's presence. He guessed that now Shellhead disappeared, that millionaire lost his way and stuck in troubles. He shrugged and continued with his work.
"Did you hear about the new Captain America?", Asked Falcon while they were patrolling.
When he reached the corner of a roof in the building next to where the hostages were, he saw his read thread once more. Tony opened big his eyes.
"Tony, please…"
"Of course, dear, you say once that your armor and you were the same. Don't let Stane make you think otherwise."
All his short-term plans were dismissed when he saw Pepper in the distance, crossing the street talking with an assistant. Tony froze, turning around with the intention of run away from her as soon as possible before Pepper noticed him. He put his trust in his appearance, a bugler, one of many in New York. But his luck was on vacation, she recognized him even in that form from the other side of the streets. Pepper stopped and left her briefcase and cellphone ready to run after him.
"Red Skull…"
"Ironman…"
Where in the hell was Gretl? She was only a product of his imagination?
"Sure. Don't be late."
"What a romantic man. Now, let's go or we'll lose the table."
"But you were right."
"Do you want me as your mate, Tony?"
"Could you let me be my choice to make?"
"Tell me you aren't disappointed because Ironman and Tony Stark are the same."
Tony took a deep breath, thinking about how fast he could fly from that situation before removed his helmet with trembling hands. Steve offered a warm smile, playing nervously with his mask in his hands. Tony was looking at the ground, shaking a little. He raised his head to let Steve saw his face, a stunned one.
The young police officer who was his replacement as Captain America was dead.
"Something."
"Get out of my way, stinky!"
The things with the Nomad identity worked more or less well, but he wasn't satisfied at all, something was missing and Steve soon realized that it was Ironman advice and jokes with the intention of open his eyes into a new concept or made him understand a problem since another point of view. Nomad was a free agent and that was perfect for a while, now with the shadows of HYDRA, Steve needed help, companion, and support from someone smart, cocky and protected with a metallic armor. He thought many nights on came back to the Avengers and asked them for help to convince Ironman to return at their side… at his side. Meanwhile, he was a new hero of the street called Nomad, Steve saw in the news that his former friend was in Asia, fighting a strange man. That made him smile. Ironman was a hero like him, they could never leave their duties as protectors of the Earth.
"Is just… do you think I can come back, Pep?"
"Let me see your face, please."
"Yes… listen, Tony."
"I…" Tony's eyes hurt, tears were coming, "I understand…"
"Are you… did you see it, right? Our red thread."
His overthinking mind was already jumping into conclusions, Tony imagined his Soulmate as one of those villains and forever doomed because he couldn't harm his mate even if was his enemy. With such bad thoughts, he prepared his armor, ready to fly and surprise the band. Ironman didn't hesitate, breaking a wall and pushing the first green uniforms he saw. He kicked heads while he descended with elegance to face the leader of those snakes.
That's why he decided to drop the title and left his identity as Captain America. Steve couldn't handle his disappointment after the Secret Empire incident and the loss of his beloved friend Ironman in one single punch of life.
Tony resisted the urge of asking her where she spotted Cap, walking at the opposite side until he was out of the train station like someone who just witnessed a ghost. The cold breeze hit his face, brushing his hair tenderly and Tony felt annoyed because he was stunned by his vision of the red thread and at the same time, he was terrified for the proximity of Captain America.
“Is this some sort of interview technique? Weird me out to get under my skin?” Tony pressed with a scowl.
“That’s what I said!”
Didn’t he want this? When he had signed up for this thing with Steve, hadn’t he known it was heading here? Tony had offered Steve his home, his body, his heart willingly because there was something about Steve that drew him in, something he couldn’t say no to.
"Don't suppose you've seen the exit?" Tony smiled with a shrug.
"While you're up, would you mind getting me a glass of water?"
Tony closed his eyes. "Peter," his voice a rough whisper, "why are you still here? You need to-"
"Is he still down there?" Cap glanced at the doorway, indecision plain on his face, then back to where Tony lay motionless, heart hooked up to heart monitors and IV lines.
So much power, enough to break and remake worlds.
Jan streaked toward Hank, and Don gritted his teeth and forced himself away from the wall.  He had to get to Mjolnir.  Once he had his hammer, he'd be healed, could get them all out of here.
“You have no idea how much effort and nagging on my part that took.”  It wasn’t all that funny, but Steve felt his mouth trying to pull into a smile anyway.
Coming to the mansion for the night had been a spur-of-the-moment decision. They weren't moving back in yet, not until Steve's still-yet-to-be-unpacked boxes had been brought over and Tony had had a chance to get the downstairs engineering lab set up; tonight was supposed to be a trial run, to see if the mansion was really habitable yet, and to give Tony a chance to have Steve all to himself, away from the rest of the team. He'd been looking forward to a chance to share a bed with Steve without waking up to find Jarvis's cat chewing on his hair.
Tony glared up at her. He would have stood, but he had a nasty suspicion that Pepper, in her customary three-inch heels, would turn out to be taller than he currently was. "I'm glad this is so amusing for you," he said.
Jessica  Jones and Luke Cage came into the hallway, both of them dressed to go  out, as was Steve.  Peter had already left, and Jessica Drew was  presumably getting ready to go right now.  Tony, whom Steve had found  tearing apart a Quinjet engine, was the only one not dressed for a night  on the town.
Tony had begged his pardon and sought forgiveness. Hank had not, had in fact flaunted his misdeeds in Thor's face, but he had not committed them out of spite and malice. Loki was warped inside, treacherous as rotten ice; perhaps she always had been, even in the days when Thor had considered her a brother.
Trying to took so much energy, more these days than it had before he'd been exposed to AIM's toxin — or maybe it just felt that way — but it was worth it. More than worth it.
The police arrived several minutes later, and looked less than pleased to see Hyde; this was, after all, his third arrest in the space of two months, if the aborted escape attempt Steve had halted a couple of weeks ago counted.
Steve shook his head. "This is your house," he said, more stiffly than he'd intended to. "If you think you'd be more comfortable, or safer here... you're still an Avenger."
to each other, it would have gone more quickly," Hank pointed out, not bothering to contain his irritation. "Next time, don't just barge in here; you almost made me drop this."
Tony was watching SHIELD communications for Steve, he knew, keeping an eye on Sharon and Bucky for him. It made him feel better, to know that he — that they — would know immediately if either of them was in trouble, but if Tony was getting headaches again...
And, unfortunately, where Thor went, Don Blake went also.
She leaned in toward him, and Doom found himself staring up into ice-green eyes that were anything but foolish. "Even with the powers of a god, you cannot stand against Chthon."
"Then you might have bothered to tell me when you got pregnant, since it majorly impacts the process of changing you back. Not to mention that all the bloodwork I've already done on you is useless now." Every test Hank had run had indicated that Tony in female form was completely infertile; he shouldn't even have been menstruating or ovulating. Obviously, Hank had missed something vital.
Tony weighed barely anything; Steve could have thrown him off easily. He didn't, though he knew he ought to. Tony's weight was resting directly on top of Steve's groin, probably not by accident, and the position had the possibility to become very interesting, very quickly.
Steve's face and ears were starting to flush red.  "And how is you giving yourself a heart attack or brain aneurysm going to help us stop that?" he demanded.  He bent over Tony — who suddenly regretted the fact that he was still sitting on the side of the infirmary bed-and stabbed a finger at his chest, continuing in an increasingly louder voice, "What the hell was that with the communications system?  We had an agreement!"
"Which means she's probably performing it now." Steve had shifted into a combat stance, his weight on the balls of his feet and his jaw set with familiar determination. "We need to track her down and stop her."
He repeated the second half of the sentence out loud, and Sharon's head snapped up.
self-control."
"That was an accident!" Tony snapped, the strain in his voice clear even though the helmet's voice modifier. "His armor malfunctioned!"
"Willing to forgive
She was around Sam's age, with well-defined muscles in her arms that probably came from hauling manuscripts around, and mid-toned, coppery skin, and had shown no sign of Dr. Thomas's tendency to talk down to them all. Between himself and Hank, Sam had gotten the better end of the bargain.
Steve didn't like the way Tony's voice sounded, didn't like that he couldn't see his face. "You don't know that."
to speak to him.
a little black dress, and no longer visibly exhausted and depressed, making fun of him didn't feel cruel.
Chthon moved her through customs like a puppet, speaking through her mouth and posing her limbs as if she were a living doll. Hearing her own voice emerge from her lips, calm and polite and completely independent of herself, was utterly terrifying. She was helpless, the way she'd been when she had watched her children die, when she had watched Ultron tear Vision apart at Chthon's bidding. And yet she smiled, and told the customs officer how excited she was to be in New York, perfect sincerity in every word.
"He's only being a jackass because he's in pain," Clint advised Hank sagely, as he headed for the door. "Just ignore him."
"You're not going to tell him about it," Tony snapped, abruptly missing the days when he could simply order SHIELD agents to do or not do something. "He'll be insufferable." Tony could already picture the pained worry in Steve's eyes, the concern, the way Steve was going to re-arrange strategies to keep him out of the field and out of the line of fire just in case, hear the 'I-told-you-so's he wasn't going to say but would very clearly and loudly
"He looks okay to me," Sam observed. And then, "He's not going to want you hovering over him."
In the back of his head, he could sense Redwing's wary reluctance to return to the Mansion, balanced against the knowledge that Sam and food were both there. Redwing didn't spook easily. Neither did the cat, who had stood his ground against two and a half pounds of pissed off, territorial red-tailed hawk without blinking.
the woman in the mirror was him, he would have turned on the charm and flirted with her.
"Yes," Hank said, not looking up from the tiny screen he was staring at, "you should have planned for Chthon to reanimate Jack's frozen corpse and bring it back from orbit."
When he reached for the next box, picking it up to set it on the bed for easier access, it was unexpectedly heavy. How many books had he had?
Clint's lips twitched slightly. "Have you ever noticed that Cap always seems to assign the fun parts of these things to himself?"
"I could tell," Carol said, her voice flat. "Afterwards, anyway. Even when it was happening, I knew something was wrong. I just couldn't do anything about it."
Wanda shook her head, rubbing at the tattoo on her left hand. "No. You don't have to trust me. I'm not asking to come back to the team. Not now. Not after-" she stopped, swallowing, and continued. "I know I can't apologize or go back. I wanted to warn you."
"Come on, Patton," Steve coaxed. "It's okay."
"Thor," Tony said, rising to his feet. "Welcome back, big guy." Even though the armor's voice processors, he sounded pleased. "I thought you were going to hide in Valhalla forever."
"Unfortunately, no." Cap walked past him toward the room. When he reached the doorway, he hesitated, turning to Clint and Sam. "I can handle this. You two go check on Jan. She shouldn't be alone when she wakes up." He said it steadily, as if Jan not waking up wasn't even in the realm of possibility.
With a roar of rage that sounded uncannily like Doom himself, the Doombot grabbed at its smoking faceplate, trying to rip it free while spidery threads of energy crawled over its hands. The faceplate peeled free, revealing bare circuitry underneath, and Wanda dodged backwards as two arrows the length of her arm punched through the Doombot's metal skull.
He lunged forward, shouting a warning, already knowing that he was too late, as a repulsor beam blew a hole clear through Sin's torso.   And Sin, impossibly still alive and upright, stabbed Loki's spear upwards, straight into the center of Tony's body.
He'd been too angry to notice it at the time, the hurt from Tony's betrayal still too raw, but Tony had been seriously holding back during that first big fight over Registration. Steve should not have been able to get into a fistfight with an armored-up Iron Man and walk away with nothing but some bruises and a couple of cracked bones.
"Promise me you won't do anything to make this worse," Steve interrupted. It was supposed to be an order, but came out sounding like something entirely different.
“A lot,” Steve said flatly.  They were both being far too blasé about this, he thought distantly.  As if this were old hat.
"And then I told Clint that he was just jealous because he was still single, and he said that if he wanted to, he could get a woman more easily than I could."
"I wasn't suggesting we try it
"Stark said that." Sharon's voice was low, the tension in it audible. "It wasn't helpful then, either."
“I thought the Extremis had a healing factor.”
Over Tony's shoulder, she saw Byrne enter the restaurant and exchange a few words with the maitre'de, who gestured at their table. "Put your game face on. The press is here."
It had had to be done, of course, but Doom was certain that, had he been wielding the spear, he could have dealt with Chthon and still had at least a portion of the spear's magic left over.  Perhaps not enough to elevate himself to the level of a god, but certainly enough to make good use of.  If that woman hadn't taken it, if Blake hadn't somehow escaped his grasp, victory would have been his.
"Scarlet Witch," Steve cut in, voice controlled. It was his Captain America, I-am-in-charge-here voice, despite the fact that none of them were in costume. "It's good to see you yourself again."
She made it about ten feet before she ran straight into Hawkeye. He grabbed her by the shoulders and the two of them promptly began struggling over the fork. "Look, lady, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? Ouch, shit, will you stop that?"
Tony took a step closer to him, until he could feel Steve's body heat through his clothing. It was probably wishful thinking, but just being near him seemed to make Tony's headache fade a little bit.
The statue stopped wobbling abruptly, and Steve's vision cleared enough for him to see Wanda standing with one hand outstretched, a look of concentration on her face. A few feet away from him, Carol was shoving her hair back out of her face, looking deeply embarrassed.
"Does anyone have any points of business to bring up?" Jan went on. These meetings always reminded her how heavily Tony had been involved in writing their by-laws. "Do we want Iron Man to read us the latest financial report on the Maria Stark Foundation and our funding, or shall we skip that?"
Tony turned sideways, using his left forearm to block Steve's punch. The follow-up jab at his stomach, heavily pulled so that all it did was hurt rather than bruise internal organs or crack ribs, he unfortunately missed.
"Clint," she said after a moment. "Can you slow down, I can't-" a pause, presumably caused by him interrupting her. "I can't understand you." As Steve watched, Jan's eyebrows drew together in a frown. Then she sat bolt upright in her chair, her eyes going wide. "Wait, Tony and Hank
"Yes," Wanda said. "With their tongues."
"All right," Jan said, clapping her hands together. "I think we can declare this Avengers meeting adjourned. Steve, go after him and make sure he's all right."
Steve  watched them head towards the club's tiny dance floor.  Even on the  extremely slim chance that he could get Tony to agree to dance with him,  he thought wistfully, it would attract too much of the wrong kind of  attention.  This was supposed to be MJ's big night, not the night the  New Avengers ended up in every tabloid magazine in New York.
Tony frowned. "Why do people keep asking me that?"
Steve let himself fall back onto his back, smiling up at the ceiling. He was not going to admit liked the idea; this was important, Tony was important, and since they weren't getting married in church, it would be nice to have at least one formal ritual to solemnize the occasion. "He just wants a chance to hit both of us on the ass with swords."
"If you want dessert," Steve said, nodding at the separate dessert menu which sat in the center of the table in the spot normally occupied by a wine list, "you need to decide on that now, too. Their specialty is a freshly baked apple tart with extra-thin slices of apple, and it takes at least a half hour to cook."
"No," Sharon said. "Don't call anyone. In fact, if anyone asks you later, we were never here."
Sharon frowned, staring off into the middle distance, her arms folded across her chest. "What would Sin want with a sixteenth century manuscript?" Then she shook her head slightly. "Never mind. For all we know, Doom demanded it as payment for giving her the dimensional transport device. We should have anticipated the possibility of those two working together; Doom was willing to cut a deal with the Red Skull to bring Steve," she hesitated, the pause so slight that someone who hadn't spent months carefully avoiding using the word 'dead' and listening to Steve do the same wouldn't have noticed, "back. Whatever he thinks he's going to get from that spear, it's worth enough to him that he'll work with Nazis to obtain it."
"Including working one truly fucked-up number on your head."
His abilities would be limited in this new host, since she had no magic of her own for him to use, but she was only a temporary stopgap.  With the spear's power and this form giving him the ability to influence this dimension, he would release himself from imprisonment himself, as he had meant to do through his avatar.
she shouted again, as every LCD screen in Times Square exploded in a shower of sparks.
"It wouldn't." Strange dismissed the subject with two words and went to peer over Don's shoulder at the results of Hank's blood tests. "Loki was quite thorough. Your blood chemistry is completely normal again, as if you had never been altered in the first place."
"No reason," Clint said hurriedly. Don was probably right, he realized. If Tony wanted half the team to know he had some kind of medical condition again, he'd have told them himself, and he probably wouldn't appreciate Clint going around behind his back and telling everybody, any more than he and Wanda wanted everyone to know what had happened between them in Transia.
Steve drew a deep breath. "I'm not going to argue with you while you're in a hospital bed. We can talk about this later." He stood up, glanced around the room. "I wonder where the doctors are. I would have thought they'd be in here by now."
Weapons. Like the ones that Tony had made once. The ones that had nearly killed him. This level of open anxiety over them was new, though. "You still do contractor work for the military, or at least you did."
"Sex performed to saxophone music" was a gross  exaggeration.   Steve rubbed at the back of his neck with one hand, and  said, "It's in a club.  What's the difference?"
Clint made a face. "Don't sound so regretful. Also, can we change the subject? I really don't need sexual fantasies with you in them."
Hank winced. He actually seemed to get smaller, though she knew that was only an illusion. Standing in the same room with him, only a few feet away, she would be able to feel it if he actually used the Pym particles in his body to change size.
It wasn't just Tony not being there; he'd had nightmares after the team had fallen apart, when they'd thought Wanda had gone crazy, and he'd had them during the registration fight, too, and during the war. Wanda coming back had probably set them off again, or maybe Chthon's presence was affecting him, dredging up old nightmares. The security guard at the Metropolitan Museum had said that the John Dee book gave him nightmares.
That got him a long, flat look. "Because no one is going to force me to follow some stupid human law and 'register.'" The air pressure in the room dropped palpably.
She looked away, one hand crumpling the fabric of her skirt. There was something dark on the back of it, but Tony wasn't close enough to make out the details. "I'm... I will be. I hope."
"And anyway, Carol's on it." Wanda frowned, sharply arched eyebrows drawing together. "At least, I think she is."
Well, if Sam wanted to play rough... Steve didn't even bother to roll back to his feet; he simply thrust one of his legs between Sam's and brought him down that way, then lunged for him. "You know that doesn't matter to me," he reminded Sam, once he had him securely in a hammerlock.
Loki stared first at Doom, then down at his hand where it touched hers, staying silent just long enough for Doom to begin to fear that he had overstepped. Then she met his eyes, a cruel smile on her lips. "This plan of yours has merit, Victor von Doom. You have ambition, you lust for power. And, of course, you plan to betray me and rule alone." She leaned down, until her lips were inches from his mask, and purred, "I like that."
Surely he wasn't so insecure in his masculinity that watching Jan fight without him bothered him. She could take care of herself; she had for years, with and without Hank around. And it wasn't as if she were on her own – she had the entire team with her.
"I was only going to be pregnant for another week. I had an appointment next Thursday at a nice, discrete private clinic to take care of things. I wouldn't even have told the East Coast team if Thor hadn't forced my hand."
Wanda shook her head, offering him a weak smile. "It's all right. There was nothing anyone could have done. I-" she hesitated, then, "They weren't really real, anyway."
Steve looked up sharply to find Rhodey standing over them. "No," he snapped. "I'll do it."
" Sam said.
"That would be now," Sam announced, his eyes flashing golden. "Redwing just saw them coming out of the front entrance."
- and tried to figure out what he was going to do.
This evening certainly beat the last time the two of them had had the entire mansion to themselves, Tony reflected. Then he shoved the thought away, hard. They were moving on now, he reminded himself, putting the past behind them, and he couldn't do that if he let himself dwell on the memory of fighting Steve, of losing Steve.
Tony was poking desultorily at his computer now, resting his chin on one hand; Steve wasn't sure if he was putting the finishing touches on his project, or had just run out of steam. He had been working on it for at least an hour, by Steve's watch.
"You wanted to talk to me?" Tony asked, as he followed Wanda along the hallway to the kitchen. She trailed one hand along the wall as she walked, over the scuffs still left in the plaster from construction; it would need to be repainted once all the work was finished.
They were actually talking, she realized, with a strange little jolt. Not yelling at each other, not trading blame or apologies. Actually talking, the way they had used to. She hadn't realized how much she'd missed it.
Tony flinched. "I didn't mean to. I- his armor malfunctioned, caught on fire. Neither of us could get it to stop." He looked away, then back up at Steve, meeting his eyes squarely. "If you want me to leave the team, I won't argue, but I owe you the whole story before I go."
Clint half-raised one hand. "I can tell Hank," he volunteered.
Tony's eyes snapped open, and he glared at Steve. "No. I am closing my eyes because my head hurts and my eyes hurt from staring at computer screens all day, which I used to not have to do. Contrary to what the Post and the Bugle have been printing about me, I do have
"Hell, I didn't even remember his name until Jan told me."
"Oh," Tony repeated. "I'm not carrying your child anymore. You don't have any responsibility to-"
Sharon raised her eyebrows.  "You can tell her yourself.  I try not to interfere in your relationship."  Something about the way she said it made Tony automatically want to protest that he and Maria Hill didn't
The nagging sense of familiarity had bothered her from the beginning; some elements of the curse were similar to the magic that she had used on herself - under Agatha's guidance - to conceive the twins.
"Stay with the nice man," Jan said through clenched teeth, shaking off Byrne's grip. The little girl hiccuped once, then let go, still crying, and latched onto Byrne.
Steve waited for more, and when it didn't come, made himself ask. "What did she say?"
"You think Chthon's causing all this?" She thought of the face on the pavement, leering evilly up at her. That one had to be a coincidence, even if the disaster itself wasn't — it was too pat, too silly and trite not to be.
"Tony's nothing like anyone I've dated before."
He felt stiff and strange in it, not uncomfortable, but oddly on display in a way he wasn't while in costume.
Rhodey made a face. "Don't do that. It's creepy."
Tony's lips twitched. "Good point. Clint and Bobbi would probably kill each other before the three of us got back."
She hadn't meant to mention that when she described the situation to Agatha, but once she had started talking, everything came pouring out. After all, this was Agatha, her first teacher, the one who had encouraged her to create the twins in the first place. If anyone would understand how much watching Tony's obvious misery over his pregnancy and relief at the prospect of getting an abortion hurt, it would be her.
Unsurprisingly, no one really believed either half of that statement.
Sin and her men were gone, and so, Sam saw as he staggered to his feet, were Hank and Jan.  There was nothing left in the room but broken Doombots and corpses.
Even after Afghanistan, he'd been able to fake it, though. And if Tony could hold it together and not appear to be a broken wreck after a near death experience and three months of torture and captivity, then he could do it now.
Jan wrinkled her nose. "Because he was a famous rock star and I was young and stupid."
Bucky was a capable, competent, deadly adult – had been all three of those things even when he'd still been a kid too young to vote – and Sharon was likewise a grown woman with a life of her own, but...
"Doom won't kill them any time soon.  That's not how he works." Tony said, after a moment, his voice slightly more ragged than it had sounded a moment ago, and Steve winced.  Doom was apparently willing perform human sacrifice in order to get what he wanted, and even if he decided that Hank and Jan were more useful to him alive, Sin might not agree.
been Wanda who had turned on them all and killed him was such a relief that beside that, who cared about some sex that hadn't exactly been unpleasant anyway?
Tony leaned his head back against the glass, eyes still closed, and waited for the cavalry to arrive.
Bucky and Natasha were both pretty good at it, though they were hardly typical, but she had a point.  He should have heard her coming.
"His pocket," Sharon said.
It made Tony want to yell at him, lash out at him, turn that concerned, sorrowful calm into the more familiar anger Steve usually displayed when Tony had fucked up.
"I'll take him down to the ambulance guys."
Strange would be able to tell her the answer to that, she knew, but she didn't want to ask. She already felt uneasily as if she were betraying Agatha by seeking out training from another sorcerer. She wasn't going to ask Strange to second-guess Agatha's advice. Whatever answer he gave, it wouldn't make losing the twins any easier. Would knowing that it was her own fault, or that Agatha had encouraged her to try to create them too soon be worse, or knowing that it had been a forlorn hope, an impossible task that no witch or sorceress would have been able to successfully complete?
Tony dropped his guard, lowering his fists, and actually rolled his eyes. "Yes," he said. "Now you have a hundred pounds of muscle mass on me, instead of just fifty. Come on, you've always been stronger, faster, and better than me at this, and you always will be. It's not like the ability to kill me with your bare hands is something you've only just now acquired."
Daredevil looked away, and Wanda felt an odd sense of relief to have the opaque red plastic of his mask's eyeholes leave her. There was something unnerving about how steadily and intently he
"You can stay with us," Cap offered, and gave the other Avengers a stern, firm-jawed glance that dared them to disagree.
Steve unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged out it, tossing it over the back of a chair, and rolled his neck. It had been a long two days.
SE's VP of Sales was generally gratingly upbeat, but lately his emailed memos had become terse and to the point, and his voice, filtered from his cell phone through the Extremis, currently sounded impatient and annoyed.
Sam swallowed. "I'm fine," he said, voice hoarse. He held up one wrist, and Redwing hopped up from his perch atop the unconscious man to land heavily on it, talons digging into Sam's thick leather glove.
Except that if there was one thing his handful of months as Director of SHIELD had taught him, it was that you didn't throw potential allies away, even if they personally scared the hell out of you. You never knew when someone significantly scarier was going to show up.
"Strange heard it, too," Daredevil protested defensively.
His chosen avatar would have been preferable, of course, or even the interfering mortal sorcerer, but any avenue into the dimensions he'd been barred from was to be seized.
"We're not accepting your help," Steve said, his voice as calm and controlled as if he hadn't just witnessed Don screaming accusations at Loki. "So you can turn around and leave, Mister. I mean, Ma'am."
Clint shrugged, desperately uncomfortable. "I don't know if I did. I don't remember. I don't remember deciding to do it, or deciding to come back. I don't even remember the sex all that well. It's kind of a blur."
Clint had been to LaGuardia airport dozens of times, and it never got any less crowded. It wasn't that hard to get through the crowd, though, as long as you didn't mind shoving past people.
"I summon the powers of the Vishanti!" he began, reaching out for the power that lay always waiting, ready for the adept to call upon it. In many spells, the words were, strictly speaking, unnecessary – the true magic was done by the exertion of one's will, with spells and gestures serving merely as a focus for the mind – but when drawing upon the great powers, they were vital. Spoken aloud, an invocation served as both supplication and invitation, addressed to forces who would only grant their aid when the proper forms were observed, or whose touch, if the forms were not observed, could be immensely dangerous.
"Or SHIELD business, or some Stark Enterprises crisis that requires your presence on a conference call to Japan at five in the morning," Steve returned, but his eyes crinkled at the edges with a smile that didn't quite reach his lips.
The spear hit the pavement, still pulsing with sullen red light, and Strange collapsed like a puppet with cut strings, his cloak writhing around him like a living thing.
Steve had missed sparring like this. The two of them had practiced together on and off for over seven years now, ever since Tony had first come to him and asked for lessons on how to defend himself, since his "bodyguard" had been framed for murder and Tony had handed the armor over to SHIELD. If Steve hadn't already been almost certain that Tony himself was Iron Man before that first lesson, he'd known it without a doubt by the time it was over.
Sharon raised her eyebrows. "You can't just not tell him your upgrades are making you sick, Tony," she said, her tone just this side of confrontational. "You're dating him."
There was nothing useful he could contribute for the moment, and he'd need what energy he had left for their escape; Don closed his eyes and let himself doze for a while.
Trusting Jan and Clint to deal with the A.I.M. hirelings he could just catch sight of sneaking up behind him, he turned and threw his shield at the billboard. It hit the giant LCD screen with a shower of sparks, and the red and white animated swirls that had been about to form themselves into the Target logo disappeared as the screen flickered, then went dark.
"We've hit a small speed bump," he said. "It will only take a couple of weeks to remedy the situation, though."
“Damn it,” Hank hissed, voice uneven.  “I’m crying.  Why am I crying? Jan?”
"Nothing." Tony lowered his face into his hands again, rubbing gently at his temples. His voice was flat, giving away no emotion. "The Extremis does this when I overuse it. Turn off the lights on your way out."
She was pretty, extremely petite -- especially standing next to Sam's six-foot-plus height -- and was really obviously flirting with Sam. "It was so nice of you to help us handle those two patients," she said, fluttering her eyelashes up at Sam. "Whatever those poor people were drugged with makes them so violent."
Maya hadn't asked any questions, just handed him a glass of water and gone back to her lab. She had never been good at comforting people, even those who wanted it, and he hadn't.
"Keep people from being killed," Steve interrupted. "I grasp that. I just don't understand why you wouldn't listen to me, why you had to put people's safety at risk."
The kids who had seen Michael Van Patrick accidentally killed at the hands of one of his own classmates probably grasped that superpowers were dangerous. They were probably less than convinced that disastrous mistakes with them weren't the end of the world. Hank wasn't entirely sure of that himself.
It had been so long since a business meeting had gone well that Tony had almost forgotten what the combination of relief and smug satisfaction it always engendered felt like. He hadn't even realized how much stress he'd been under until the meeting was successfully over with, and he'd actually felt sick from the overwhelming relief.
"Not as long as I keep treating anyone in a costume without asking what their real name is or how they got that interesting gunshot wound or laser burn. Bloomberg wouldn't like my expense reports." She gestured at Strange. "How would I itemize having him put up wards around the operating room? Or put the kind of injuries he's got now or that half the rest of you get into a normal medical file?"
Hours later, Wanda sat on the sofa in Strange's study, drinking tea and watching the sky outside his huge, round window slowly shading into dawn. She felt empty, hollowed out, and so exhausted that she no longer felt like sleeping – just an ache in her head and a gritty burn in her eyes.
Jan raised her eyebrows. "No, you have Kree metabolism, which is even better. I hate you and Jen sometimes. It's one of the perils of being short; five pounds looks like ten on me." She set the bowls to one side and dug her spoon straight into the ice cream; it wasn't as if anyone else ate it, anyway, with Spiderman and Jessica Jones no longer staying in the tower. Thor, who was better at respecting labels on food than most, never touched her ice cream.
Keeping that book here was a bad idea, and not just because of the insurance disaster it would be if something happened to it while it was in their custody.
It was probably a sign of how bad the past year had been that Tony didn't even feel surprise. Of course Wanda's return to New York was part of a demonic plot. Nothing good came without strings attached.
"That bitch. I knew she and her men gave up too easily."
he reminded himself.
Very wrong. Something was very wrong.
Tony didn't answer, just kept his face buried in the crook of Steve's neck and breathed in the scent of leather and heat and sweat.
"If you do not mind me asking," she began, deliberately changing the subject, "why did you agree to train me? You're infamous for refusing to take on students."
"I'm not sure," Steve admitted. "I think this is supposed to be an examination of how photography shaped American conceptions of the West, so it could be either."
"Okay," She-Hulk conceded, "maybe a little."
They had put him in a private room, of course – most city hospitals did that with superheroes now, for insurance reasons.  It was a painfully long walk from the staff room, but at least it was on the same floor.
Of course, so were the powered ones. Hank, Wanda, Vision. Simon, who had died twice. Tony again, who was still deeply fucked up despite his new cybernetic powers, for all that he'd gotten better lately.
Hank's lab was approximately twenty feet by thirty-five feet - pacing from one side to the other took ten steps in each direction. Tony turned, keeping Wanda in sight, and started another circuit.
"What else do you want?"
It hit the floor in a clatter of metal, the sound almost swallowed up by the ringing clang from across the hall.
Don stared up from where he knelt on the floor to see Loki standing over him, the huge golden horns of her headdress silhouetted against the ceiling.
Clint had planned to go and see Jan again, but when he found himself in the hall outside her room, he couldn't make himself enter. She wasn't going to be any better, and there wasn't anything he could do, and the last time he'd been in there, she had sent him away.
"I was not a horrible leader."
He still hadn't gotten used to how much smaller he was - the loss of body mass was even more disturbing in some ways then the loss of certain body parts. Tony didn't have to look up at people often, aside from Happy and various fellow superheroes. Now, at 5'7", most of the men in the room were taller than him. Or would have been, if he hadn't been wearing heels.
"Great. I'll call back tomorrow."
She woke up still Wasp-sized, inside a shimmering bubble of energy that she knew already was going to be impenetrable and probably shock her when she tried to touch it.  Through the greenish distortion of the bubble, she could see Hank chained spread-eagled to the opposite wall.
Bucky shrugged one shoulder – the right one, the one that was still flesh and blood. "She wants revenge. It's not complicated; we killed Crossbones, and his death wasn't pretty, or easy." The dark circles that had still smudged his eyes the last time Steve had seen him were gone; he looked fully recovered from the snake venom now, and though there were probably still bandages hiding under his clothing, you couldn't tell it from the way he moved. Seeing him now did a little to ease the memory of him leaning on Sharon, his side covered in blood, but not enough. It had taken half an hour for Steve to get all the blood off the kitchen table, counter, and floor. They had thrown the ruined, blood-stained dishtowel away.
Tony rubbed his thumb up and down Steve's bicep, the familiar warmth of his skin obscurely comforting, and leaned in a little closer. "We never got a chance to finish what we started earlier," he said, lowering his eyes to glance at Steve's crotch. "I think you said I owed you something for cooking for me."
"Mr. Stark, Ms. Van Dyne, please, I'm not making any accusations here-" Byrne started.
The crystal of contemplation was heavy, carved from a single piece of rose quartz with one milky-white flaw near its center. Wanda sat cross-legged on Strange's thick oriental rug and closed her eyes, rolling the crystal between her hands and trying to relax, to let her hex powers fill her without actually using them. Ensuring that the power she called up didn't begin to warp chance and probability out of true around her took a significant amount of concentration.
Ben capped his pen, sliding it back inside his breast pocket — he'd been taking notes by hand, either because he didn't want Tony to look at them, or because he preferred a pencil and paper to a PDA. "We can reschedule." He stood, shrugging back into his coat. "I'll see you at the museum, gentlemen."
"That's a good question." Steve frowned. "Whoever it is, we can't let her use an innocent like that. It could destroy them."
"You did," she agreed. "The way you tackled that robot was very manly."
His shield seemed to hum in his hands as Wanda spoke, pink light crackling over it. "I can't control where their bullets hit, but I can make certain that the ricochets strike nothing important."
SHIELD had stood in the way of her father's plans for years, stubbornly thwarting all attempts to impose a new and better order on the world. It had survived the Helicarrier's destruction, survived Stark's weak and faltering control, and her agents within its ranks had been eliminated. All attempts to re-infiltrate the organization had met with failure, and Doom had forbidden her to try again.
"There's nothing
He was fine. He was just being an uncommunicative jackass, because some business deal or other at Stark Enterprises, defragmenting his armor, or redesigning SE's tablet computer from the ground up because the patent infringement case had suddenly turned in HP's favor, was so important that he'd lost track of time.
, finally.
"Remember what happened the last time we tried working with supervillains?" Hank interrupted.
something wrong with it, with both of them – but he had never been very good at these kinds of conversations. But if Peter could unmask in front of cameras, Steve could hardly do less.
Instead, he went to the kitchen and dug an icepack out of the freezer, then dropped into one of the solid wooden chairs and held the plastic bag full of ice against his shoulder. It would have worked better if the leather and mail of his costume weren't in the way, but trying to strip out of the skin-tight leather right now was more trouble than it was worth. He'd wait a few minutes, he decided, let the ice start to numb things.
"She still did it," Carol snapped, glaring at him. "How can you defend her, after what she did to you? She could do it again at any time, the moment she uses enough magic to fry Strange's seals and lets Chthon back into her head."
Steve took a step closer to him, until they were standing only inches apart, close enough to feel Tony's body heat and smell his aftershave and the faint metallic tang that the Extremis had given him. "They shouldn't have printed those pictures. The rest of the article was justified, mostly, but those were private."
There was a brief, uncomfortable silence, as the Avengers carefully avoided Wanda's eyes. She resisted the urge to tug at her gloves nervously, and turned the half-finished reach to check the tattoo at the base of her neck into a tug at her hair. "I defeated him once," she said. "There has to be a way to do it again."
No hiding, he reminded himself.  Not even from rich strangers with plastic smiles at a fundraising gala.
He nearly collided with Tony and the Falcon on his way into the room, both of them intent on shoving their way out and toward the elevator. "Carol's in LA, of course. Steve's told her that she needs to pick a team and-" Tony broke off abruptly, jerking to a stop inches away from Don.
Carol was right; they had to do something about Chthon. Waiting around in the hopes that they could stop him whenever he finally made his move was already costing the city too much.
Steve winced. "I'm sorry?" He'd only met Morgan Stark once or twice, and had a vague memory of a stocky man a few years older than Tony, who reminded him of Tony's playboy facade at its most annoying, with none of Tony's intelligence or charm.
"Does that mean there's not going to be a sword bridge? I've waited my whole life to smack Captain America on the ass with a sword."
"I'm so sorry," Steve repeated. And the worst part was that he couldn't even bring himself to regret what they had done, not really - he'd been happier over the past few weeks than he had been in a long time, and most of that had been because of Tony. "I never thought-"
As Don walked toward the elevator, Wanda climbed down off the table and straightened her skirt. It was the same one she'd worn at Strange's place, the drab-looking navy one. She looked awful in it, all pale and washed out.
"I'd have googled it, but I couldn't remember how to spell it." Google searches on medical stuff always seemed to turn up as many ads and weird homeopathic remedies as they did actual information, anyway.
Tony let go of him abruptly. "What?"
of mass you have on me to pin me to the floor. Getting close enough for you to grab me would make this a very short fight."
"Or we could leave," Steve offered.  "MJ's finished her set."
Stopping Chthon had meant taking her down by any means necessary.  He’d known that from the moment Sin had stepped into the spell-circle, her eyes glowing with inhuman power.
"You'll pay for this, woman!" Doom spat, turning back to Jan with energy crackling over one gauntlet.  The other hand held his mask to his face.
"Sin just disappeared," Steve said, grimly. "Some kind of spell, or teleportation device, I don't know." Whatever it was, it was nothing he'd ever seen her or the Red Skull use before, which meant she'd had outside help.
Tony was fairly sure that Carol was on the East Coast team at this point, thanks to Steve and Jan's hints that she pick a coast and stick to it. "She and Henry had a... falling out, over Simon." Which was something he was going to have to ask Henry about, eventually, given that he'd only heard Carol's probably-biased side of the story. How exactly had he managed to lure Simon away from a threesome with two stunningly attractive women, one of whom had pheromone-enhanced sex appeal? "They're trying to avoid each other, but she went back to LA anyway because she and Jessica are in the 'ill-advised post-breakup sex' phase of a relationship."
"Well, It's good that you're here," Clint told her, dropping the topic of the book before they actually had to talk about Marcus and Kang. "We are one seriously underpowered set of Avengers. As awesome as I am, I can't punch somebody through a wall." Too bad Jen was also staying in LA; having She-Hulk on their side would be damn useful. Clint could remember a time when everyone was always complaining that all the superheroes were in New York; these days, it seemed like people were everywhere
Carol punched the Doombot in the jaw with all the force she usually tried not to use on humans, then grabbed it by the shoulder and chin as it stumbled off-balance and ripped its head clean off.
The man snarled silently at him and lunged upwards, his knife slashing at Steve's legs, only to skid harmlessly across his shield.
frown. "The project is still in development, though. It could be a year before we see any salable results."
"Personally, I've always found that fighting leads to no sex," Hank said. "So, LA's out then. There's always New Jersey." From Peter, or Steve, or Luke Cage, or any of the other native New Yorkers who'd been on the team, it would have been a sarcastic suggestion. Hank sounded as if he were presenting it as a serious alternative.
"Isn't that play supposed to be bad luck?" Steve asked.
Steve had known Tony for ten years, and in all that time, he had never once seen him charging either his chestplate or his heart up. Tony trusted him, but he apparently didn't trust him
"About what? Being a suicidal drunk for most a year?" Tony flung both arms out in a needlessly dramatic gesture. "Why not?"
"You're pronouncing it wrong," Hank said, not looking up from the computer screen he was squinting at. "Come over here and tell me if these look the same to you."
Hank glanced automatically at Tony, who shrugged. "We didn't want to risk damaging them by passing them through too many sets of hands. The police bomb squad was afraid they were biological."
The metal exam table and just-slightly-too-cold air conditioning had not improved since his last visit, and the vise-like pain in his head was all-too-familiar as well.  His hopes that SHIELD's doctors would give him a quick once-over and then release him had probably been doomed from the start — he'd known that when he'd woken up in a quinjet with Steve's hand gripping his and no clear memory of how he'd gotten there — but they'd died an even swifter death than he'd expected once they landed on the Helicarrier's deck.
"A lot of people still have reservations about the Initiative," Steve said mildly, stepping into Rhodey and Tony's line of sight. "That fact that it was originally compulsory didn't endear it to anyone."
"I'll go back out to the lobby," MJ said, reaching into her purse and pulling out her cell phone.
If Tony had snapped before, and for no apparent reason that Steve could decipher, then he could do so again. Hank had, after all, and Hank had been the last person anyone had expected it from. Hank had always been quiet, a little unsure of himself, reserved. Not the kind of person you expected violence from, especially not borderline megalomaniacal super-villain-style violence.
There was an instant of silence, everyone else presumably as surprised as Tony was. Since when did Loki feel any kind of familial affection for anyone?
Steve was examining another woodcut, this one from the mid-1500s and carefully displayed in a dimly lit alcove, when he felt another presence behind him. He wasn't sure what bit of information told his brain that was Tony – maybe the sound of his footsteps, maybe some scent, the sound of his breathing – but his subconscious had identified him before the other man spoke.
How much of Agatha was truly left? How much of the woman in front of her was simply Chthon's energy poured into an empty shell?
Then she stopped, hesitating, as she heard a child somewhere start to wail.
Barnes shrugged.  "Steve would know better than I would."
"In the future, maybe we should avoid taunting supervillains," Tigra suggested, her tail swishing gently back and forth.
Cap kept his eyes focused straight ahead, not bothering to look at Clint. "You were stabbed in the arm with a fork, and your leg is bleeding."
'Lucky' wasn't the word Steve would have chosen. Someone had used Tony, taken advantage of him. Even, possibly, violated him. If he couldn't remember, there was no way to know whether he had actually agreed to anything that had happened, and he wouldn't have been in any condition to defend himself.
Even thinking about it too hard made him feel sick, violated, made him long desperately for a drink. His body literally wasn't his own anymore. He'd been handling being female, not enjoying it, save for those moments when he was with Steve, but handling it. His body had let him down before; this had only been a new and occasionally humiliating variation on a theme. He'd just had to take it one day at a time, get through each board meeting, party, conference, and newspaper interview as it came.
Hank stopped in his tracks and turned to look back at her, a smile slowly dawning on his face. "You know, my ice cream has calories, too," he said, an uncertain note in his voice in spite of the smile he still wore.
None of them had invulnerability or super-strength, either, which hadn't been an issue yet, but had the potential to be.
The museum was eight blocks away, a ten minute walk for a normal person and a three-minute run for Steve. Neither Clint nor Steve could fly, and Jan and Sam couldn't carry another person with them while airborne, which meant that Tony was going to have to give one of them a lift. Clint, he decided, as the armor slotted into place around him. Steve could handle an eight-block sprint without so much as breaking a sweat, even carrying twelve pounds of metal on his back.
The surge of adrenaline-fueled worry snapped Steve out of his daze, and he forced his attention back to Doom himself, now striding calmly toward them.  Tony's armor was more than capable of standing up to Doom's weapons; he would shake this off, just as he had the other hits he'd taken.
They all wore little nametags on their lab coats, slips of plastic-coated paper with the logo of their imaginary shell company stamped on them. No SHIELD badges or insignia, but they were branded with the enemy's mark as surely as those who wore SHIELD's uniform. They took SHIELD's money, worked to further its goals, and shared in its guilt.
"She woke up a little while ago. You're the one that had us worried." Steve's arms tightened slightly around Tony's shoulders. His grip was painfully tight now, but there was no way Tony was going to object.
"You can run it after you eat," the Wasp interrupted. "Tony has many admirable traits, but that thing where he locks himself in his lab or a machine shop for days on end without eating or sleeping isn't one of them."
Steve already fought Viper and other HYDRA's member. At least, as consolation, none of them were his Soulmate. Who was then? His question will be answered when he heard a known sound, a blaster one.
Felt again the armor was like if Tony just was living a nightmare and then woke up. He touched the metal and the helmet with tender while Rhodey explained what happened in Asia and the track that pointed to a group of villains, probably and surely HYDRA's member. Tony looked at his friend, now fresh and with the older look.
"Will I see it?"
"Seems that we can learn from each other."
He even didn't see Obadiah's perfidious plan. From one day to another, he was in the streets, without money or someone to help him. Tony's thirsty gained force and his mind told him that being a bugler wasn't a bad idea, after all, he could drink all day. So far away from the hurtful thought of lost Captain America trust and his friendship when he insisted on work with the government when HYDRA already infected it with his agents and attacks. Or the memory of his bright smiles, those blue eyes opening so big when they saw it the new technology that Tony created for him. Someone who could saw through him and not only try to pretend.
"You… wanted me?"
"If you were here," Steve dared to speak out loud his mind, "Probably you were telling me how foolish I am for this Nomad appearance".
Silence came again, but this time, Tony moved forward and kissed Steve, leaving him blinking and smiling.
"I think you could guess who I am, after all, we just fought together. You knew my moves as I knew yours. But if you can't imagine it, let me tell you. I am Captain America."
But who?
Like if Ironman was important in his life.
"That was fast."
Tony made a fake smile. "Doesn't matter. It was my fault."
"Maybe you're right, Falcon."
"Do you want to be mine?"
Years passed and Steve never saw the famous Soulmate Red Thread. He believed that Peggy could do that magic, but nothing happened. He was frozen and met Sharon Carter with his disappointment appearing again. Not because she wasn't worthy. Sharon proved to be the best companion and fighter that Steve could imagine. They understood very well and she always was a cheerleader for him in doubt times.
Steve laughed and Tony felt alive again.
Steve almost slapped himself, with all the emotions he forgot that he was in his Nomad costume. He smiled and walked a few steps.
"And you taught me my value as a man, my friend," Steve put his hand on the gauntlet, wishing he could remove the metal and touch the real hand.
But Tony failed him and his only company was Gretl, that poor pregnant woman.
"Thank God it was you."
Tony raised his head and smiled at him. "I'll be ready in a minute."
"Well, destiny wants me to face my demons and watches me fail once more."
"He was… he was dead. Newspapers…" Tony stuttered.
"Y-You don't understand…"
The wind blew the red thread, like hair floating in the water. Steve forgot his current situation, only thinking about the shocking fact that he was watching his red thread, the one which connected to his Soulmate. If the red thread was there, that meant only a thing: his mate, his Soulmate was near. He sat to breathe and calm himself, with a hand on his chest, feeling his beating heart. He had a Soulmate. Steve smiled, raising his head to the bright sky with joy. That moment was broken when Redwing appeared and shrieked, flying in circles waiting for Nomad to follow it. Steve jumped from his seat, touching the red thread -a ghostly sensation- before ran behind the falcon.
His Soulmate was near and he was hiding.
"Could you let me be my choice to make?"
"Then, how…?"
"Seriously, what is going on with those wings?"
No way.
"Thank you for making my mission easier, Ironman," Red Skull showed a gun and Ironman shot.
Tony grew up with half of his heart waiting for his Soulmate and the other half giving up over the topic for the sake of his life. He never expected what happened in Vietnam or became an Avenger. Or found his teenager dream frozen in the Arctic. There were many things to forget the red thread theme, so he did it. Tony concentrated in his company, the Avenger team, and to teach the poor soul of Captain America how to live in a futuristic world. His world had bright colors, and for a very narrow instant, the genius thought in the possibility of being happy with that.
Steve walked in the workshop, was about to ask Tony why he was taking so much time to be ready. They had a date, and Cap liked to be early in the restaurant. He founded his Soulmate very concentrate on a model, finishing the details.
A red thread coming from his heart to the horizon.
"Hey, Shellhead."
"You should be in the car, Mr. Rogers."
"When you meet your Soulmate, a red thread appears in front of your eyes. It's connected from your heart to your mate's heart."
"Do you have a penny for this man?"
Everybody knows the story, but at some point, they heard about it for the first time in their lives. To Steve Rogers, he was in a dinner with her mother, months after his father Joseph passed away. They were in silence, eating slowly the few carrots and beans that meant to be the main dish. Sarah raised her head and smiled at him, one hand caressing his short blond hair.
"Call the Avengers, vacations are over."
Steve was thinking in return as Captain America, but Falcon was right, Red Skull was sure by now that he killed his former enemy and the surprise could be an excellent element to catch him. He swore himself that will be his last time as Nomad, after finish his mission, he will return as Cap. It was his duty and the path that he chose. Steve looked at himself in a glass of a window, his reflection on that dark blue uniform, he scaled to the roof, waiting for Redwing sign. Nomad watched the streets below, his thoughts wondering about his fellow Avenger when he got a big gift for his eyes.
Finally, he found that kids cartoon about the children with magic kung fu that was more addictive than he was ever going to publically admit, and settled down to kill half an hour.
He felt silly about that now, especially after weeks spent looking at the bare, unfinished walls of the Avengers Mansion as it was slowly rebuilt. Spending months living in a house with no pictures on the walls was not normal, but by the time he'd actually noticed how barren the apartment suite looked, Steve had been back for almost a month, and the boxes with the pictures in them were sitting in the middle of a dozen other boxes of Steve's things, waiting for him to unpack them.
Steve and Tony's cat was waiting outside the elevator. It gave an odd, creaky chirp, and did its level best to trip him before he could even get through the elevator doors, rubbing against his ankles and coating his pants with orange fur.
Steve's grin was sudden and blinding. "I'm sure you have an extra pair of goggles around here somewhere."
"That's... good, I guess." Actually, it was potentially very useful, but building it hadn't required Tony to hide all day. "We should have figured this out days ago," he added, feeling a flash of irritation at himself as well. "It all makes sense now. Sin's never had any interest in magic, but Doom's been after Loki's spear for months now. It's too much of a coincidence for a book with spells for summoning chaos entities to be stolen while Chthon is in the city and for the two of them to have nothing to do with one another." In hindsight, the likelihood of Doom's involvement was almost painfully obvious. Why had none of them seen it?
Jan screamed, flinching back against the wall at the head of her bed. She drew her legs up and hid her face in her arms, making little whimpering noises, and oh God, what the hell was wrong with her? The other people, the ones Cap would have called "civilians," had been bad enough, but this was
Neither of them said anything for a long moment, and then she blurted out,
Rhodey picked up on the subtext instantly, his face breaking into a grin that showed off even white teeth. "Oh yeah. Come on, I'm a jet pilot. There's no such thing as too much throttle. Plus, that finicky suspension and all those fancy electronic add-ons in your ride weren't my idea of a good time anyway. You practically had to have an engineering degree to operate it. I prefer to put all my attention on the road."
He might not like it, but that had never stopped him from doing it – Tony had always been willing to stick to his planned course of action with maddening stubbornness if he thought it was necessary, even when said course of action was self-destructive and morally questionable. If he truly believed that an alliance with Loki was the only way to save the world, he would walk into the cathedral and pick up the spear himself to bring it out to her. Or he would have at least kept arguing a lot longer. The near-fight in the kitchen was probably as much about Tony's ingrained habit of playing devil's advocate as anything else.
“I don’t know.  I just know I’m glad I did.  The world wouldn’t be right without you, any more than it would be without Cap, or without Simon, or my—“ she broke off.  “I miss Pietro.  I think he’s alive.  I want to think I’d know if he weren’t, but twins don’t actually work like that.”
It had never been that easy with any of the women he had dated, or the occasional man. Even with Jan and Pepper, who had been his friends before he'd ever thought of them in a romantic context, it hadn't felt this natural, this right. Probably because Pepper had already started to fall in love with Happy by the time Tony had gotten around to noticing that his assistant a) wasn't named Kitty and b) was extremely attractive, and because he and Jan had both known from the start that a relationship between the two of them couldn't last.
"A lot." Tony concluded solemnly, smile turning wistful. He yawned, and added, "Mind giving me a hand up?"
He deserved Steve's anger and contempt, but that didn't make the thought of facing it again less painful. If anything, it made it worse.
Cap stared at him blankly. "What?" he said, after a long moment.
"Tony's not here yet," she told him. "Or at least, I'm guessing that's why you're here."
Hank folded his arms, staring down at his computer screen. "It's not like I want them to. I didn't even want to do the experiments with Thor's clone; they were the least disturbing option out of an entire list of unethical experiments. The scientist they had me working with under the Initiative was dissecting and cloning dead teenagers without their parents' knowledge."
He’d seen Tony unconscious in hospital beds so often by now that there shouldn’t have been any drama left to it.  Even the IV line in his arm and oxygen canula in his nose, and the wide swath of bandaging around his torso shouldn’t have been anything new or frightening.  He had looked worse after heart surgery, and when Steve had visited him in the hospital after he had stopped drinking, when he’d disappeared for all those weeks.
"He looks bad," Clint agreed. Tony's face was flushed, his hair was sticking to his forehead, and from the expression on his face, whatever he was actually seeing wasn't very nice. "But hey," Clint went on, trying to sound encouraging, "Hank's working on an antidote, and he's almost as good at that kind of thing as he is at creating things that turn out to be evil."
At a civilian hospital, he would have had to argue or beg to get the details of said surgery out of the medical staff.  Not here.
She yawned, suddenly tired, her eyelids feeling heavy. The shadows dancing at the edges of the candle light seemed to thicken, reaching out across the carpet toward her.
"Instead of standing out here worrying," Jan said, taking hold of his arm. "You can come watch fashion week with me. They should be broadcasting the taped recordings of last night's runway shows right about now, and I missed at least half of them because I was too busy backstage to go out and watch."
"He's not really people," she pointed out.
Carol met her eyes, her face serious. "But he wasn't in control, any more than she was. Any more than Tony or I were when we were drinking. And anyone who loses control like that once can do it again."
Steve nodded sharply. "Right. Everyone suit up. I doubt will have much of a window before she gets here."
than before. He smelled like a woman. But then, what else would he smell like? "I don't want to lose that, not after just barely salvaging our relationship from... everything."
"Want  me to get you another drink?" Tony offered, indicating Steve's empty  glass.  Almost before Steve could say yes, he had scooped up both his  and Steve's empty glasses and was up and walking towards the bar.   "Coke, right?" he asked over his shoulder.
"Is now a bad time? Because I can come back later," Peter said. Maybe he should have knocked.
“Scratched it.  Right down the middle.  Not even adamantium can do that.”
"That's the only other time I was ever mad at the Witch." Clint shrugged slightly. "I don't know the whole story, she didn’t tell me until after everything was over. Apparently there was a while there, right after Tony stopped drinking, when Rhodey was having some kind of issues. Wanda saw him haul off and slug Tony once."
The last time Tony had arrived here via quinjet, he'd come out wearing his armor, changes completely hidden by red and gold metal. This time, he was wearing a different sort of armor, the three-piece business suit concealing almost any hint of feminine curves. It didn't manage to make him look any less like a woman, though, not when his face and smaller frame were so clearly visible, nor did it hide the white-knuckled grip he had on his briefcase.
He had the torso of the armor and one repulsor gauntlet back together when there was a knock on the door.
Sam shook his head, pulling his shirt cuffs straight and brushing futilely at the punctures in the fabric of his right coat sleeve, the spacing of the tears looking suspiciously like something Redwing's talons might have made. "I don't want to talk about this. I'm tired of thinking about it. And about Chthon and whatever part of Lower Manhattan's going to blow up or fall down next. Have they re-opened the Islamic art gallery yet?"
He felt naked when his armor wasn't working properly. He wouldn't have waited this long to get to work on it if he'd had a choice.
apologized?" Wanda's eyebrows rose, and Tony shrugged uneasily, feeling as if he were being judged over something, but not sure what.
The elevator between Tony's basement lab and the Avengers' apartments rose with perfect silence; even more than the brass and wood paneling, that spoke for how expensive it was. Don, watching the floor indicator climb with impressive swiftness, wondered morbidly what would happen to anyone who happened to be in the lab if the building's power ever went out. As far as he'd been able to tell, there were no stairs between the lab and the ground floor lobby. On the other hand, forgetting to plan for disaster was not among Tony's failings; there had to be some alternative way out of there, not to mention a way to get massive pieces of equipment in and out. The elevator was the size of a freight elevator, but even it wouldn't have been able to accommodate some of the things that Don had watched slowly disappear from the lab over the past week, which had included giant arc welders, a massive sets of jacks for propping up quinjet engine blocks, and one of Tony's two Cray computers – slightly outdated, but they apparently had some kind of nostalgia value – along with half the contents of a machine shop.
