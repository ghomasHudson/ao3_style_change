"Rude!" Clint pouted at her. He looked over his shoulder when he heard someone treading through the forest rather loudly. "Look who decided to show up." Tony was following them at a distance, stumbling over the thick undergrowth. He cursed when a branch smacked him in the face. Steve snorted in amusement.
"I...know...but it keeps talking to me. Telling me everything I know is wrong. Telling me the 'truth' about everything. I...I don't know what's real and what's not anymore." Peter looked away sadly.
"I'm not the one who set the lawn on fire. Twice." Iron Man appeared behind Clint, with Bucky at his side. Clint stuck his tongue out at the robot. "Mature." Iron Man tilted his head up as if he were rolling his eyes. "I'll make the popcorn, Thor. Go find Bruce."
Peter's anguish had been replaced with raw determination. This was his body. His family. His girlfriend. And he'd die before he let anyone hurt any of those things ever again. Enough was enough.
"You want to tell me why you're back in your pajamas?" Tony held up his phone, showing a blurry photo of Peter in his homemade costume.
The suit latched onto Tony's arm and unfurled around him. He was out of the car and blasting off in mere seconds. Steve cursed under his breath and got out to follow on foot.
A second explosion knocked everyone off their feet. The tower seemed to sway for a moment. Large cracks formed along the floor, small sections of it starting to cave in. Steve used his shield to protect himself from the bits of ceiling that were raining down on him. "We need to get out of here! Everyone get to the Quinjet!" They were on the 50th floor. No time to take the stairs.
Spider-man tugged at his hoodie, looking down at the now faded spider emblem. "New? This is my old costume."
The Iron Man suit came back, knocking Tony away from Steve and crashing into a nearby bookshelf. Steve rolled onto his side and propped himself up on one elbow. "What...the hell?" He breathed out. If Tony had just saved him, then who was in the armor?
"Wanda. Why are you doing this?" Steve stood in the doorway, the look on his face resembling that of a kicked puppy. "I thought we were your family?"
"You're not in a position to make demands, Mr. Stark. Show me the Venom. And I'll show you Spider-man." Osborn remained stock still, brown eyes not leaving the glowing blue of Iron Man's faceplate. Iron Man held up his hand, the small vial between his thumb and index finger. A smile tugged at the corners of Osborn's lips. "Put it on the headstone and walk away."
"He sticks to the ceiling," Bucky said. Steve looked up at that, realizing he had misunderstood what Bucky had said.
Bruce shook Osborn's hand. "Thank you. Glad to do business with you again, Osborn. I'll start work on the symbiote right away."
"There's nothing more we can do right now, Stark." Nick Fury leaned back in his chair. Tony sat across from him, his helmet placed on the desk between them, its eyes pointed at Fury. Of course, Fury knew who was behind the iron mask. Nothing got past that man.
"I hope so. Who else is gonna help me prank Captain America?" Tony gave a small smile at that. Clint grinned, "although maybe we shouldn't be pranking your boy toy. Bad for relationships. We'll have to find a new target. Widow?"
"Sure." Tony straightened up and held his hand out to his partner. Steve gladly took it and walked hand in hand with him to a donut shop. Steve slid into a booth while Tony went to get the donuts. Steve hummed to himself as he looked around the tiny shop. There was an elderly couple on the other side of the room, and a teenager working behind the counter. This particular donut place was always quiet, and Steve enjoyed coming here with Tony. Although to be quite honest, Steve enjoyed going anywhere with Tony. He often found himself following Tony around his lab.
Steve sprinted back to the lab. Dum-E whirred happily, waving an empty syringe in its claw. "Thanks," Steve grabbed the needle and spun around wildly, not sure where to find the sedative itself. Med bay was on the other side of the building. He wouldn't get there and back in time. FRIDAY opened up one of the metal cabinets, a rack of vials sliding out.
Spider-man twisted around in midair and shot a web between two rocks, creating a soft place for him to land. "I'm okay!" Peter landed on all fours. The Iron Man armor turned on Falcon, giving Peter the time he needed to run for cover. "Take out the reactor, just gotta take out the reactor," he muttered to himself, using his organic webbing to propel himself further up the mountain. Once Iron Man was completely focused on his battle with Sam, as well as War Machine and Captain America, who had just shown up, Spider-man made his move. He grabbed a rock, planning to smash the reactor with it and jumped down onto Tony. In one swift motion, Iron Man spun around and blasted Spider-man in midair. The blast hit him square in the chest, sending him flying back against a boulder. He slid down the stone, hands hovering over the nasty burn on his chest.
Tony sighed heavily on the other end, "I know, Cap. Now just really isn't a good time. Where are you anyway?"
"Someone's feeling better," Rhodey observed when Tony came upstairs for dinner, freshly shaven and fully clothed. "Steve called again by the way."
"Yeah...hot liquid doesn't mix well with a sore mouth." Peter motioned to his face. Tony had been trying to ignore the red marks around his mouth, but now he was forced to look. They had been healing fairly well. Though a few might leave small scars in their wake. Only time would tell. Peter took the lid off his cup and used it to fan the hot drink. "Slug bug!" He suddenly punched Tony in the arm. A second later, a bright yellow VW bug rolled down the street in front of the cafe. "No slug backs."
"Don't interrupt. It's rude," Obediah sneered. "Fuck it. I'm just going to kill you now." He lunged.
Tony awoke to the cold surface of an operating table. In a strange place with strange people in lab coats fluttering around him. He had been stripped of his armor and clothes, now wearing nothing but a pair of white shorts. Tony thrashed against his restraints. He tried to activate the repulsors in his prosthetics but nothing happened. He tried calling his armor next. It didn't come.
"Stark won't eat," Bucky hissed. "I tried to force him, but his arm turned into this...canon thing." He held up his forearm and used his other hand to make a circular motion around his wrist. "Didn't know it could do that...anyway. Not the point. Point is, he won't eat, and I'd rather not get my head blown off."
"Yup," Bucky poked his head back into the living room. "He told me about it this morning after he calmed down a bit."
"No, no, no. I-I got this...I got this." Tony dropped onto the couch, where he had been living for the past two days. What he had seen in those caves was still fresh in his mind. He hadn't been able to save the person the Hydra agents were experimenting on. And he hated himself for it. Part of him wished he hadn't gone down there. Then he wouldn't have seen what they had done to that person. He wasn't even sure what gender they had been. Most of their body had been replaced with robotic parts.
"Sure he's not," Bucky rolled his eyes. He gave Tony the five minutes he had asked for, but ultimately stomped back over to the bed and yanked the blankets off. Tony yelped in surprise, instinctively curling himself into a tight ball. It was a rather brisk morning, and Bucky felt a little bad about doing that. But Tony needed to get going. "Glad to see you kept your pants on for once."
"Thanks," Steve gave him a fond smile. He held his hand close to his chest and activated the sensor in his palm. The shield came flying across the room, snapping into place on his arm. "Works!"
"Hey, you said five minutes!" Tony reminded. Fury ignored him, looping an arm around the boy to steady him as they walked out of the cell.
"Evening out the playing field," Wanda smiled cruelly. Venom rose up from the floor, taking humanoid form. His body type resembles that of Peter's, but with a bit more muscle on his bones. The symbiote's face split into a stomach-churning smile, with jagged teeth and a long pink tongue that flicked around his mouth like a that of a snake's. "That's Richards boy. Go wild." Wanda pat him on the back. The symbiote let out an ear piercing shriek and darted straight for Peter.
Steve shrugged, "Nat's turn to pick." Natasha was already scrolling through the romance section of Netflix.
Steve instantly jerked away from his friend. "I-I am not! Absolutely not! I would never have relations with a teammate, that would be extremely unprofessional!"
The agent held up their hand, "we know you did no such thing. That was the real test to see if the lie detector was working. Congrats, you passed."
It shared his memories. His feelings. His trauma. And yet the AI was a completely separate consciousness. It knew as soon as it couldn't find its body that it was in fact not Tony Stark. This revelation led to confusing emotions. It felt betrayed. Alone. Lost. But also relieved. It couldn't feel pain in its current state.
"Sorry about your house, Ms. Potts," Natasha apologized as she jumped over Pepper and stabbed knives through the eyes of a rogue bot.
May was a smart kid and caught on to what Tony was saying fairly quickly. She hadn't inherited any of Peter's powers. Tony had once asked Peter if he was disappointed. Peter claimed he was glad she didn't have his powers.
"We should call him Sparky," Clint smirked. Natasha hit him over the back of the head. "How about Robert? He looks like a Robert."
"Shhh...shh...you're safe now, Petey. You're safe. We're gonna get you fixed up, okay?" Tony soothed, brushing a hand through Peter's hair.
Steve put a steady hand on his shoulder. "Stark-" Tony smacked his hand away and scrambled backward, pressing himself against the wall. Steve clenched his jaw. He had never seen Tony so afraid. No, come to think of it there was one time he had seen Tony afraid. Tony had had a panic attack in his lab two weeks ago. Steve had seen the tail end of it. Tony clearly didn't want to talk about it at the time, so Steve had forgotten about it until now. "Tony?" The engineer flinched at the sound of his name. His eyes flicked in Steve's direction. Recognition sparked in them and Tony allowed himself to relax. "Are you okay?"
"You could say that," the bot's voice was deep and gravely. It raised its fist, a small projectile attached to the back of its wrist.
The man's eyes widened and he squirmed against the webs, desperately trying to get away. "Stark! I swear-"
"Clint let him go!" Steve ordered, "let Banner explain himself. Surely there's a logical reason behind this. Peter, are you sure it was Bruce? He was the one who patched you up when we found you-wait, where is Wanda?"
"Great," Bucky shut Tony's menu. "I'm serious, Stark. I think it would be fun. Everyone misses you when we go out-"
"I got an apartment with a...friend." Peter looked away. "I've been saving up money from my job at the Bugle. Oh, and I got a job offer at Oscorp." Tony was paying for Peter's college tuition and wanted to pay for everything else his son could ever need in life, but Peter wouldn't let him, opting to get a job to support himself. Peter had told Tony he would pay him back the tuition money, much to Tony's shock.
Everyone fell silent. The only sound came from the steady hum of Tony's repulsors, propelling him across the skyline.
"He's strong and he's fast. If he wants to leave he will. I'm just a guy with a bow. I can't stop him," Clint held up his hands defensively.
"Who are you drawing?" Iron Man leaned over the back of the couch, eyeing the sketchbook in Steve's hands. He was drawing a man sitting at a workbench, fiddling with a clump of wires. The man had dark, unkempt hair, and slim fitting clothes, with one of his shoes untied.
Currently, Peter sat in the backseat of an old beat up truck. Wanda said they were going to Chicago, but didn't explain why. They had been driving all day and Peter was bored with looking out the window. Now he was looking at a tiny black disk in his palm. A bright red button was in the middle of the disk. He had found the object in his belt next to the photo. On the back of the disk the words "don't panic" had been carved into the black metal. Peter took out the photo and read Tony's note again. He felt a strong urge to press the red button. And so...he did.
"I'm trying!" Steve sat on top of Peter, holding his arms down against the mattress so that he wouldn't hurt himself. The wall crawler thrashed around violently. "He's strong!"
"I don't think getting physical with him would've been in anyone's best interest...Ms. Potts, I will make this right. I promise you-"
"I'm fine, Tony." After everything that had just happened, Peter still looked at him with nothing but trust. Tony wished Peter wouldn't look at him like that. It would make dealing with the guilt much easier.
"So you're the one stealing all my microchips...you little..." Tony went over to the desk and crossed his arms, glaring at the spider.
There was a heavy metallic thud behind them followed by a, "give him to me." Everyone looked up to see War Machine. He held out his arms to take the injured bot. Steve scooped Iron Man up bridal style and handed him over to Rhodes. Steve had to pry Iron Man's hand from his shirt.
The explosion shorted out Tony's suit. He was barely clinging to consciousness as he plummetted through the clouds. One of the bots grabbed him by the ankle, successfully stopping his fall. Tony used the last of his strength to lift his head. The bot stared down at him, soulless blue eyes meeting Tony's own. Tony let himself go limp, arms dangling below his head as darkness overtook his vision.
"You're unbelievable," Steve let his head fall back against the chair and screwed his eyes shut. He could hear Iron Man clicking with laughter, but chose to ignore it. Steve got up and moved over to edge of the balcony. He drummed his fingers on the railing. Looking up, he could clearly see every single star in the sky. The full moon washed over the mountains with more light than Steve thought possible. After living in New York for two years, Steve had forgotten what the sky really looked like. It was comforting in a way, with there being no light pollution to hide the constellations from him.
"Transfer a copy of the Mark 46 schematics to this new file. Let's start by altering those." Iron Man took a seat at his desk and waved a hand over the keyboard. The keys instantly lit up. An image of the Iron Man suit popped up. He pointed at the faceplate and made a swiping motion with his index finger, removing the selected part. "Alright, Ultron. Let's get to work."
"Ow...Fuck..." Tony worked his arms and legs under him as best he could, crawling into the workshop itself. Not too much further. Dum-E noticed his struggle and rushed over. It beeped frantically, waving its claw. Tony reached out to it, "get me to my desk." Dum-E grabbed Tony by the back of the shirt and drug him the remaining distance. From there, the cyborg was able to climb onto his stool. Tony's chest heaved, his mouth open wide as he gulped for air. He grabbed the edge of the desk to steady himself. "It's fine. Just going into cardiac arrest. Everything is fine," he mumbled to himself as he typed a string of commands into his computer. His vision was starting to blur. He must have been swaying because Dum-E had put its arm against Tony's back.
The next morning, Sam poked his head in Steve's room. The two always went on morning runs together. It was almost eight, and Steve still hadn't met Sam downstairs, and he was starting to get worried. Sam blinked at the scene before him.
Iron Man was a strange being. Sometimes Steve forgot that there was no actual person under that metallic armor. Just clumps of wires and oils. Steve didn't like to think about Iron Man like that, though. He liked to think that there really was a person in there. Iron Man acted like a real person. Most of the time. He would often spend time with the team just like a normal person. Watching movies, and playing board games. Iron Man would assist Bruce in the labs, and spend his free time reading books. He joined them in their training sessions.
"SHIT!" Natasha jerked the Quinjet to the side, right as War Machine shot past. He took a sharp turn downward, going straight into the water. Thor and Falcon hovered just above the waves, watching nervously.
"The arc reactor in his chest is the only thing keeping him alive. If the light goes out, then he'll die," Natasha explained. "It's been flickering ever since we crash landed."
"I said I'm fine," Tony put his helmet back on. His bots were affectionate, somehow knowing how touch starved he was. And most of the time he appreciated it. Now wasn't one of those times. "Be a dear and steal some food from the kitchen for me. I don't care what. Canned soup if there is any." Dumm-E sped off, happy to have a job. For once, it actually brought back what Tony had asked for.
Tony mentally screamed at himself. The current was too strong. His face scraped against the rocks. Which way was up? He couldn't tell anymore.
"I like the new design. Lovely paint job, as always, too bad I have to ruin it." The bot's voice crackled as if it were laughing.
Air flooded into Tony's lungs. He doubled over, gasping in the sweet oxygen. The Avenger looked up to see Steve standing over him, shield in hand. "W-what hap-? Where's Peter?"
"Shut up, you're cute when you're sleepy," Iron Man gazed into Steve's eyes. He wanted so badly to kiss him for real. To hold him in his arms, and actually
"I try," Peter murmured. "I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-man. It's kinda important that I stay happy-go-lucky."
Peter had his face resting on the kitchen table, his arms outstretched. Bruce was removing the stitches from his forearms.
A year later, Tony Stark once again held an infant in his arms. This time his hands didn't shake. He hummed softly to his grandson. May was curled up next to him, her eyes never leaving her new baby brother.
Tony was stroking his hair comfortingly. Without looking up he whispered, "I promised him that nothing bad would ever happen to him. That I'd protect him." Tony took in a shaky breath. "Look at him, Steve. Someone went and stitched up my boy's mouth and I wasn't there to stop it."
"Engaging as we speak," Steve grunted. "This guy isn't going to go down easily. I may need back up."
The Avengers looked between one another in a mix of worry and intrigue. They had been called to the Hellicarrier for a meeting with the director, and had been told to bring Iron Man with them. Steve found that a little odd, considering Iron Man always accompanied them on team meetings. He was an Avenger, so why wouldn't he? But Fury was very adamant that they brought the robot. The robot in question was sitting next to Steve and hadn't spoken a single word since they arrived on the Hellicarrier.
"I know. I told him that you stabbed our neighbor, got me pregnant and burned down the entire city block before we finished unpacking the kitchen," MJ said with a completely blank look on her face.
"I have contact!" Clint announced, handing the headset over to the team leader. He remained close to Steve, listening in on the conversation.
"I told you not to touch me!" Spider-man yanked his head back and rolled onto his stomach. He started to army crawl away but Bruce held him down by putting his foot on the wall-crawler's back.
There was another unusual thing about the Iron Avenger. He experienced emotions. Real emotions. The emotions seemed to be limited to joy, anger, and fear, but they were emotions none the less.
Peter dialed Happy's number on his phone and held it up to his ear, "hello? Happy, there's this weird guy sitting next to me, asking about churros. I think I'm gonna have to take him down."
"Huh," Deadpool nodded. "So I should get in on the Avengers family stuff? Try to seduce Widow?" He wiggled his eyebrows.
Tony took a seat across from Henry, "you can't understand me. Jesus Christ, I'm talking to a spider..."
Oxygen flooded back into Steve's lungs. His eyes snapped wide. Iron Man was no longer on top of him. Instead, Tony was hovering over him. "Steve! Are you alright?!" Tony looked like he had seen a ghost. His fingers brushed over the bruises on Steve's neck. "Steve? Can you hear me? Speak to me, baby."
Tony's expression darkened. "No. And you're not a science project. I meant before the symbiote bonded with you."
"We barely got you out in one piece... we're on the run now." Wanda continued. "We have friends in Queens. They're going to help us take down Stark before he can hurt anyone else."
The was no more wood to chop after that, so Steve sat down on top of his log pile, putting his head in his hands. Bucky took a seat next to him.
The dragon was quickly closing in, and the ground was starting to slope uphill and become rockier. Natasha dove into a small gap in the rocks. She slid down a narrow tunnel, coming to a halt in a large cave. Bruce followed suit, tumbling down into the cave and bumping into the assassin. Thor had to shove Clint through first since they couldn't both fit at the same time.
Steve cleared his throat, doing his best to ignore the archer being attacked by a massive spider. "So...what movie are we watching?"
Tony's eyes flicked around the room. "I'm sorry." His jet boots ignited and he shot through the opposite window before anyone could stop him. The people nearest it ducked to avoid the shattered glass.
This chapter originally suuuuper long, but I decided to cut it into three parts to build suspense. Plus I didn't want to give away our traitor too soon...
Tony tilted his head at the child, holding her close to his chest. He was going to protect this girl. Keep her safe from all the evil in this world. He might have failed Peter, but he would not fail May. She was going to grow up happy, and not a single person was going to lay a finger on her. May giggled, and Tony's heart melted. "She's perfect."
"They might not be on good terms with Spider-man. Look, I'm not going to question a fucking Avenger-" Toomes cut himself off when he spotted a splotch of red against black. "He's here."
"I know he's your friend, but I don't think you should trust him, little spider," Natasha said softly.
"I still can't believe you had Henry in that box," Clint muttered, his back to Peter as the web slinger changed out of his costume. Wanda and Natasha were keeping guard outside the room. He traced his finger around Peter's desk, amused by the way Henry chased after it.
"You're not the boss of me," Steve huffed, continuing to fiddle with the gauntlet he had found. He was once again visiting Iron Man in his workshop, but this time the two of them were sitting together at the workbench.
"What?! Everyone knows I'm the fun dad!" Tony protested. Steve heard him hit something with a wrench.
It was all wrong. All so very wrong. The place didn't even look like Tony's anymore. His tech was there. But
"He can call himself whatever he wants. It's not up to you, Clint," Steve said firmly. He gave Iron Man an apologetic look, "he does have a point though. Are you sure you want to keep going by Iron Man? It's no big deal if you want us to call you something else."
"You're the best," Steve gave him a peck on the cheek. He picked a record at random and hopped over to the player. A giant smile was plastered on his face.
"Thanks, Dumm-E," Steve accepted the cup of coffee from the bot with an earnest smile. A few days ago, the Avengers were homeless. Then they got ahold of Director Fury, who relocated them to a facility upstate. He hadn't been expecting them to make the move so soon, so most of the compound was still under construction. The main living quarters and Bruce's lab were really the only things finished. Iron Man had made a home in the spacious garage that housed the Quinjet. The items he had salvaged from the tower were scattered all around.
Peter heard the Hulk roar again and looked over his shoulder to see the green beast running at him. Iron Man and War Machine flew over Peter's head, the sound of their rocket boots making Peter cover his ears. The two armored Avengers flew right at the Hulk, punching him in the face and knocking him flat on his back. It wasn't long before Hulk was back on his feet, but by that time, Iron Man, War Machine, Falcon, Captain America and the Vision had swarmed around him and were putting up one hell of a fight.
"You're no fun," Deadpool whined, throwing his arms and head back like an upset child. Spider-man laughed.
"W-wha' are...y...you d-doin'?" Peter was barely conscious. The burning smell was still stuck in his nose. He really hoped it was the grass.
Natasha made another jab for his ribs. This time Tony caught her arm and flipped her onto her back. Natasha easily switched their position. "Just because you know a few things doesn't mean you get to skip out on training. You got off easy when you were a robot. Time to make up for lost time. STEVE!" The super soldier paused, his attention turning to Widow. "Your turn to beat up Tony." She let go of him and moved out of the way.
." Tony took a long sip of coffee, holding the mug tightly in both hands. Tony truly believed his one purpose in life was to pilot the Iron Man suit. Help people. Save lives. Do what he can to atone for his sins before he kicked the bucket.
"Those exploding arrows Clint uses work like a charm on robots. Too bad that whats left of the bots have nowhere to go but down. Down onto whoever was unlucky enough to be under them."
"I can tell," Peter shot a look at Clint, who was standing directly behind him with a smug look plastered on his face. He hadn't been back to the compound since the Osborn incident and was honestly planning on spending his birthday alone with Michelle, but his family obviously had other plans. Peter followed his father into the living room, where the entire team was already gathered. Everyone had to give Peter multiple hugs and wish him a happy birthday. Which was perfectly fine with Peter. He liked hugs. Even Happy gave him a hug, which honestly made his entire day.
"Tell anyone about this and I will launch you into the sun," Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. He threw the sheets to the side and headed towards the bathroom.
One of the screens up front flickered to life, Iron Man's face appearing before them. Steve did a double take. It wasn't quite Iron Man. The faceplate had a few subtle differences. The robot also had a gray color scheme and red eyes. He didn't look too friendly.
Steve leaned forward on his motorcycle, looking out over the cliff. He and Bucky had gone for a ride along the coast, wanting some time to themselves. They paused at a viewing area on the side of the road. Far below them, waves crashed against the rocky cliffside. "I'm sorry I worried you all so much."
"It'll have to do," Spider-man said over the comms, quickly scrambling up his web and crawling onto Tony's back. "What are they doing at Oscorp?"
"Hands where I can see them, swiper," Tony ordered. The man held his hands above his head in surrender. "How did you get in here?"
"Fine. He's going to find out eventually. And then he's gonna get pissy because I hid you from him."
"Bullshit. I had my armor grab you a change of clothes when it left the facility." Tony folded his arms. "Where did you get that suit?" Tony had remotely activated a pair of suits for himself and Rhodey. The suits were currently powered down in the Quinjet hidden down the road.
"Like I said, we're on your side, Tony." Rhodey sighed, he pushed off the wall he had been leaning against and went to stand directly infront of Tony. "I get it, I wouldn't trust us either, but you have to. We all have to work together if we're going to save Peter."
"No, it's not!" Steve slammed his fist on the desk. Tony didn't even blink. "Your name is Tony Stark. You're human. Whether you believe that or not doesn't change the fact that you are human. And you don't get to just check out when things get rough. Whatever's going on inside your head, we can help you. There's therapy, medicine, whatever you need to feel whole again, we can get that for you."
"Let's do this." Clint nodded once, face full of determination. He wrapped his legs and arms around the Captain's torso. Steve took a deep breath and jumped.
"This is serious, Tony. He really might be in danger," Sam gave him a disapproving look, effectively wiping the smile off Tony's face.
The microwave dinged and Peter quickly pulled away from the Avenger. He retrieved his Pizza and ran.
"I'm bi, not gay. We've been over this. Me and Ned were a thing for a hot second but I'm with MJ now." Peter explained, getting up to stretch. He hadn't gained much in height, but he did have a bit more muscle on his once lanky form. "Where's the tape at?"
The Vulture spoke again, "he made it very clear that he wouldn't meet us in person until we gave him Spider-man. And thanks to your fuck up a few weeks ago-"
Tony groaned, "shit, I forgot about that. That was a nightmare. I'll make this right. I promise." Steve nodded, knowing that Tony would do everything in his power to stand by that promise.
Tony tried to lower his gaze, but Steve wouldn't let him. Tony needed to know that he was loved. Because this was literally life or death, and he needed to know. "I want to be a robot again. I want us to all to be a family again. I want...god, I wish I'd never taken off my mask. I just can't keep doing this, Steve." His hands grabbed onto Steve's shirt. Even after everything that happened, he still found himself looking to Steve for comfort. "I'm sorry I wasn't a very good teammate. Or boyfriend. I tried. I really tried."
Spider-man fell silent, his extra limbs lowering. For a moment, Tony thought he had gotten through to Peter. Then Peter shot forward and wrapped his hands around Tony's throat. Tony clawed at Spider-man's hands, gasping for air. The bug eyes of Peter's mask were just inches from his own. For a brief moment, Tony's vision went black.
Steve stepped close to Tony and put a hand on his flesh shoulder, giving it a loving squeeze. “We still would’ve forgiven you in time. I’m sorry that happened to you. I should’ve talked to you before things got…out of hand.”
"I'm working on it," Tony answered. "Give me a few hours and I should be able to dismantle the force fields. It'll take awhile without the proper tools, though."
"GET DOWN!" Steve threw himself over Natasha and held up his shield. One by one, the Iron Man suits blew up.
"Hopefully, you won't have to find out," Tony sighed. "Clint, Thor, stay with Peter. Everyone else, suit up. We have work to do."
"Hey guys, I'm looking for the bathroom. Must have taken a wrong turn somewhere?" Spider-man scratched the back of his neck. Someone cocked their gun. "you guys aren't big on jokes, huh? Pity." Spider-man took a defensive stance.
"Great!" Peter stretched his arms and took a deep breath, enjoying everything the New York air had to offer.
"Spiders are terrifying. Peter is terrifying. I have to keep looking up to make sure he's not there."
Iron Man started to fly towards him but Steve jumped onto his back, tackling him to the ground. "Forget the reactor for right now, take out the repulsors!" Tony pleaded, and Steve was glad to comply, bringing the shield down on Tony's hand left hand. Tony bit back a cry of pain when his hand shattered along with the gauntlet.
"I have Stane," Iron Man said to Steve, noticing his concerned look. From there the fighting started to leave the house, spreading out along the cliffs.
"Don't worry, Stark, taking down that tin can should be no trouble," Clint shot an arrow at his shoulder. The arrow sent shock waves through the armor, causing the eye pieces and arc reactor to flicker. The armor reached up and tore the arrow away.
After several hours of drinking, eating, and messing around in the common room, the team settled down on the couches. Iron Man sat on the floor between Steve's legs. The soldier leaned forward to wrap his arms around the robot's shoulders, his chin on top of Iron Man's head.
Iron Man laid one of the drawings out on the coffee table. His metal fingers clinked against the glass as he smoothed out the creases. It was a drawing of Wall-E. The tiny bot was flying through space, holding a plant in its claws. Tony couldn't help but smile at the doodle. He and Steve had watched just about every robot movie they could find. Although that had kinda stopped after Ex Machina had scared the living shit out of Steve. They would still watch their favorites from time to time, though. Steve's was Iron Giant. He liked the underdog kid and his friendly giant. Tony liked Wall-E. He saw himself in the tiny bot who was trying his best to do that one job he was created for. Wall-E took quite a pounding in the film, but he kept moving forward, desperately trying to get that plant to where it needed to go. Iron Man traced a finger over the lines of the drawing as he thought about just how alike he and the little bot were.
"Sorry guys, Avengers emergency." Peter shut his laptop before his friends could say goodbye. He shoved it into a backpack along with his Spidey suit and a few other things. He took one last look around his room, then jumped out the window and raced across the lawn to the landing pad.
"Well, come back inside until then." Sam motioned him in. The Captain was standing a bit away from the jet, using his shield as an umbrella. Steve was about to do as suggested when he heard the roar of repulsors. His face lit up at the sight of the Avengers' beloved robot flying towards them.
"Why would he throw away his backpack?" Steve frowned, getting up from his chair. The team was currently in a quinjet, which they had parked on top of an apartment building.
The shield was flung at the agents holding the whips, effectively disarming them. Steve caught the shield and glared at Maria. "That's
"Quiet, Osborn. Take the screwdriver and get out." Tony took the tool from the box on the floor and tossed it to Harry. Harry sprinted out of the lab without another word.
"I swear, I didn't know she was there, I thought I had gotten all the civilians out of the way," Clint choked out. Peter was unable to tear his eyes off the archer. Was this the reason why Clint was always so nice to him? Even when they pretended to get mad at one another, or when they were training, Clint always lets him win. Peter assumed it was just because Clint saw Peter as a little brother. And maybe Clint did indeed see Peter like as a brother, but all of that must have spawned from Clint feeling guilty.
"I will," Peter promised aloud. He went for Steve first, disarming him and engaging in a fist fight. It was almost too easy. Before, Peter had been holding back out of fear of hurting his friends. But this wasn't sparring practice anymore. This was life or death and Peter planned on being the one to live. Tony came to Steve's aid, unfortunately, his attacks were too slow. Spider-man dodged and countered each blow. It wasn't long before Tony's suit was in shambles. When FRIDAY tried to send new parts, Spider-man was always there to make sure Tony didn't get them.
"I'm going to help!" Iron Man broke away from the Hulk. He grabbed the symbiote by the neck and flew it up into the rafters, then turned around and increased the power on his boots, crashing down into the floor. The symbiote half liquified in the newly formed crater, whimpering slightly. It let itself melt into the floor, swiftly snaking its way to Peter and latching onto his leg. The symbiote reformed himself right in front of the arachnid, its hands around Peter's throat.
"His memories are gone," Tony sighed. "He's still just as snarky as before, but he doesn't remember anything. He didn't know his name. Or who I was. Or what he is. I told him everything he needs to know but it's just...not the same. Jarvis is gone."
Peter crouched on the arm of the couch. The Avengers had given up on trying to get him to sit like a normal person a long time ago. He still wore his costume, with the mask tucked into his belt. "We've seen that a million times," Peter groaned at the movie Clint was holding up.
"Right, sorry." Bruce pulled back. For some reason, Peter had been really jumpy around the entire team. He trusted Tony, that much was clear. However, he lashed out at anyone else who got near him. Bruce was just thankful the kid had been unconscious long enough to clean up his wounds.
"Or not. That's fine. Anything else you want to work on?" Tony shrugged, not caring either way. "Peter?" Tony looked up when his son still hadn't answered. Peter was hunched over on his stool, hands clamped over his ears. His shoulders shook as he struggled to breathe. Peter stared ahead, his eyes wide yet unseeing.
Thank you all for sticking around long enough to read this little update, and I hope you will enjoy what comes next!
"I will. I'll do everything in my power to make this right, Ms. Potts. You have my word," Steve straightened up and saluted her.
"Tony?" Steve was suddenly on the other side of him. He was vaguely aware of the two Avengers guiding him to a chair in the waiting room.
Steve chuckled at Sam's message, able to perfectly picture the exasperated look on his friend's face.
"You are Ultron," Jarvis supplied in the same language of code, "meant to be a robot for the Avengers."
Tony paced in his lab. It was a long, frustrating process, but all the remaining Avengers had finally been cleared. Everyone could be trusted, according to SHIELD. Fury said otherwise, but then again, Fury probably didn't even trust his own mother. Tony heard someone come into the lab. He ignored them.
Steve was screaming, but Tony couldn't make out what he was saying over the crackle of the rope. Tony lashed out, blinding slicing one of his lasers through the air. He must have met his target because the rope loosened just enough for him to shoot back into the sky.
Tony looked up at Steve, who was looking at the chat on his own phone. They exchanged a worried look before grabbing the donut boxes and rushing out the door. Both Tony and Peter had been in and out of therapy the last two years. Peter had been doing a lot better because of it. Unfortunately, there were days when he didn't do so well. Usually, Peter's episodes consisted of him having extreme panic attacks and flashbacks. The worst one had happened six months ago. Clint had been the one to find him doubled over on the living room floor, screaming and clawing at his face. Trying to get rid of the thread that had been long since removed from his mouth. Thankfully, Tony wasn't too far from the facility and was able to quickly come to the boy's aid.
All three men were blasted in different directions. Iron Man crashed into a car, setting off the alarm and leaving a sizable dent.
"Fine," Steve let go of him and leaned against the desk. It wasn't long before Steve got bored and started messing with anything and everything in arms reach.
Tony switched his eyes back to their normal blue and threw his head back with laughter. Iron Man's laughter was a strange thing. The speakers didn't pick up the sound quite right, turning it into an odd sort of clicking noise. It had taken the Avengers awhile to figure out that the clicking was meant to be laughter.
"Calm down, Junior Bird Man." Tony held up his armored hand, "I'm not dying. I'm in danger of dying, yes. But I am not currently dying. There is a difference."
"You should ask his dad, then. I don't know anything about him," Spider-man shifted around nervously, pulling one of his legs up and hugging his knee.
The faceplate snapped shut, hitting Steve's nose in the process. "I don't believe you." Tony walked out the door. Steve was calling after him, but Tony ignored him. He blasted off into the sky and didn't look back.
Iron Man went back to the computer. "Let's see what we can do about that," he got to work on typing in lines of code. "These people are smart enough to hide files from me, but not smart enough to upgrade from windows 98? Jesus, Christ." Tony shook his head in disbelief. It took a minute, but Tony did get the files unlocked. "Wait. Hang on...these aren't weapon plans..."
"Okay..." Rhodey pulled his phone out of his back pocket. "I'm gonna call Cap, let him know that you're coming to the compound." He had no intention of actually letting Tony go home so soon. Rhodey was going to call Steve, though. Call everyone on the team. Let them know Tony was alright. Give them time to process. Ease Tony back into their lives with as little yelling as possible.
"Oops is right, metal dick!" Peter sprung to life, body slamming Tony and sending him tumbling across the room. His jet boots ignited before he hit the wall, and he proceeded to fly straight for Peter. Peter jumped to the side and made a run for it, only to be hit in the chest with Captain America's shield.
Steve sat in the passenger seat of Tony's car. The two men were silent as Tony drove through the streets of Queens. They had found the stranded Quinjet at the location Fury had given them. No sign of the rogue Avengers. Or Peter. The Avengers had decided to split up and search the area at street level. Steve and Tony were the only ones in a car. Everyone else was on foot, checking back alleys and asking around. Steve had Tony's phone in his lap. The scientist had set news alerts for the keywords "Spider-man", "Scarlet Witch", and "Hulk" before giving the phone to Steve to monitor. So far there had been no hits.
"I see you're in a good mood," Tony said from the doorway. Steve looked up, frowning when he saw that Tony was back in his armor. "I was being sarcastic. Damn. Go back to beating up the sandbag," Tony waved his hand dismissively.
"Karen said FRIDAY went offline, what happened? Are you okay?" Spider-man looked up as Tony made his way over to them. The split second of distraction was just enough for Osborn to punch Spider-man in the jaw, knocking him to the ground.
"I'm not going anywhere." Tony pulled Peter's desk chair up to the bed and took a seat beside his son.
Peter stepped over Ned on his way out the window. The boys had given Michelle the bed, opting to sleep on the floor. It was only five AM, but Peter's friends would be getting up for school soon. He had to leave now before they tried to talk him out of this again. For the second time in the past twenty-four hours, Spider-man slipped out the window and ran off into the cold unforgiving world.
"You heard me. Sit down." Fury snapped. Iron Man hesitated before righting his chair and taking a seat. "Now, you wanna explain this bullshit to me?" The screen at the front of the room switched on, displaying several photos of murder victims. Justin Hammer was among the dead. Upon closer inspection, Tony realized that he knew all of them. They had all been either competitors of Stark Industries, or people who had personal grudges against Tony Stark and vice versa. "Recognize anyone?" Fury sneered.
Iron Man had pressed himself into a corner. He hardly left the tower, unless for a mission, or if he was accompanying Pepper to Malibu. Steve put a hand on his arm, "you gonna be okay?"
Iron Man went back to his workshop. Tony Stark was asleep at the workbench and didn't notice his armor walk right behind him. "Pathetic," the armor spat. "Humans are such weak creatures." The armor returned to its usual place among the other suits. "And oblivious." Ultron's consciousness left the armor, slipping back into the depth of the internet. Ultron had already come to the conclusion that he was the one to save humans from themselves. He had also realized that the Avengers posed a huge threat to mankind. They had done more damage than good in Ultron's eyes.
," Tony hopped off the desk and made a dramatic show of leaving the room. Steve couldn't help but smile at his retreating figure.
"Will there be beer involved? I miss chatting with you over a bottle or two." Bruce's voice came through the comms. If Spider-man heard him, he didn't say so.
"Damn, Stark. That's a cold move, even for you," Toomes was smiling like a little kid. He couldn't imagine a more perfect situation.
"I don't know. Her magic's different from Loki's..." Clint laid back on his cot, pressing an ice pack to his black eye.
"Tony Stark used to be our friend. He was like a father to you, Peter. But then something happened, something inside him broke...he went mad..." Wanda looked away, her voice quivering. "He...he experimented on you...cut you up, sewed your mouth shut..." She hid her face in her free hand, "he did something to your head. Bruce and I tried to save you but we were too late..." She sobbed.
Iron Man remained on the hillside until the remaining parts of the facility collapsed. Then to took to the skies. Tonight he was going to kill Obadiah. And there was nothing that could stand in his way.
Steve took a deep, shaky breath as he tried to push away the image of Iron Man's lifeless body lying in the sand.
." Steve was leaning in close, and Tony felt the urge to shy away from him, but he held his ground. "Does trust mean nothing to you?"
The Hulk charged. Happy held his stance, firing his gun until he was out of bullets. The Hulk was fast, but Spidey was faster. He darted over, grabbed his friend around the waist and swung off on a web line just in time.
Steve parked the car outside their living quarters and led Bucky inside. Everyone was waiting to welcome their newest member with open arms. Even Tony. Although, Bucky couldn't tell if he was genuinely glad to see him, or if he was being nice to spare Steve's feelings. He stiffened whenever Bucky got to close to him, so he figured it was probably the latter.
"I'm sorry, Cap." Bruce gave Steve a look mixed with grief and exhaustion. "I just can't trust Tony after what he did. If he doesn't want to be a part of this team, then that's fine with me. You guys can go after him if you want, but I won't be a part of this rescue mission."
Natasha sighed and turned back to the elf that had given them a ride. He was holding out the reins of another horse to her. "Thanks. Now for some weapons..." Her eyes drifted across the village, eventually landing on what looked like a blacksmith shop.
"Just do what you have to do, Rogers!" Tony hissed. The Iron Man suit flipped onto its back and shot forward, throwing Steve off and rocketing towards Peter. It landed with a thud in front of the youngest Avenger and grabbed him by the hair.
"No. We have a situation, Peter." Tony's voice became grim. Peter could hear other voices in the background. His enhanced hearing picked out Clint, Thor, and Rhodey. Possibly Sam as well.
"Easy, big guy..." Tony wrapped his arms around Bucky. "You can't get rid of me that easily. I'm like a cockroach. Keep coming back."
"Wanda!" Peter ran towards her, "you have to stop this! People are going to die!" It was no secret that she was the one who started the fire. Peter didn't know why. And honestly, he didn't want to. He just wanted it to end before someone got hurt.
"So the fact that he's a robot doesn't bother you? You're not making a move because he's your teammate? Wow," Clint giggled.
"Keep doing your job, Barton. Whether they like it or not, these people need to get out of midtown." Steve snapped.
"You're his best friend. Figure it out." Rhodey eyed the rest of the Avengers clustered around the couch. Once Pepper arrived, she could distract the others with food or other means. Pepper always knew what to do.
"No!" Spidey said a bit too forcefully, startling everyone. "I...I'm way older than him. I'd be weird for me to date him."
Bucky moved over to the other couch and lay down on his back, one leg thrown over the back of the couch and one hand behind his head. "How's this?"
"You have shell shock. You've been acting differently ever since the Chitauri. You had that panic attack, and now you're having nightmares-"
"Where are we?" A wave of nausea swept over Steve as he sat up, and he had to hold his head in his hands.
"Yes, you do. I don't care if you go to college or not, but you are finishing high school," Tony said firmly. "Are you wearing your seatbelt?"
The Avengers bolted. Seconds later fire spewed down where they had just been standing. The dragon roared, twisting its massive body, knocking down sections of the treetops.
Steve pulled Iron Man all the way into his lap, "shhh. Go to sleep, shellhead. You'll feel better when you wake up. I promise."
"Don't crush her," Peter chuckled, maneuvering Tony's arms so that he was supporting the infant's head.
"Hey, little Anthony," Tony chuckled. "You better start growing, cause I have big plans for your Iron Man suit."
"Uuuuuum. Maybe? I'm gonna power down now." Iron Man's eyes went dark, his arm falling in his lap with a soft ting.
Peter's blood ran cold, "w-what do you mean? Hey! What are you doing?!" His spider sense was screaming at him to run. 'Great advice,' he thought bitterly.
"In the same way they would adore a pet. Trust me, they don't ever let me forget I'm not human. That I'm not
"Iron Man?" Bucky called warily. Slowly, he moved into the door, closing the door behind him. No answer. Bucky crept further into the room. He kept to the walls, not making a sound. He spotted someone crouching behind the tool cart. They were dressed in black and trying to make themselves as small as possible. Bucky moved closer to them. The person had their back to Bucky, a wrench gripped in one hand. Bucky didn't recognize them as any of the SHIELD agents that worked at the Avengers compound. Even if it was an agent, they shouldn't have access to Iron Man's workshop. Or anywhere else in the Avengers' personal building, for that matter.
Tony held up a hand, "well, you thought wrong. This thing is literally in my body. Doesn't come out. End of discussion. Let's go find shelter. I'm freezing my balls off."
Steve nodded, eyes landing on a nearly finished Iron Man bot. It hadn't yet been painted, and wires hung from areas that weren't covered in the armored exoskeleton. The entire thing was held up by thick cables and chains. The familiarity of the faceplate made Steve's skin crawl.
Steve pulled him back into a tight embrace, running one hand over the robot's head. "Okay, sweetheart."
"I know...Can I sleep before you yell at me?" Tony looked like a kicked puppy. He also looked like he hadn't slept in days, with his hair sticking out at odd angles and dark bags under his human eye.
"BANNER!" Steve hit the Hulk in the back of the head with his shield, catching it with ease when it rebounded.
"Bastards." Tony glared at the wires around his chest. "This isn't a regular lie detector. What is this?"
"Mr. Parker, Doctor Banner has requested your presence in the medical wing," FRIDAY announces over the intercom.
"Don't follow me." Spider-man jumped off the fire escape, catching himself on a web and swinging around to the other side of a neighboring building.
The engineer nodded and hurried back over to the wrecked jet, with Thor not far behind. Tony stumbled through the debris, searching for the small red box. "I can't find it!"
"You really want to stay with these people, Peter?" Bruce huffed. "You have scars inflicted by your own father."
Fury sent Clint a look that made it very clear that the situation, whatever it may be, was not a joking matter.
"I believe the Iron Man suit does constitute as a weapon," Jarvis said dryly. Tony's mouth hung open. How did Hydra get their hands on the schematics for his suit? For his
"I'm fine, Winghead. Just a bit of a cold." Iron Man looked down at their interlocked hands. "I need to talk to you about something. In private."
One by one, Peter's memories were stolen away. His most prominent ones were the first to go. Him and Clint hiding in the vents, watching their latest prank unfold. Natasha giving him dating advice right after sneaking him into a bar. Listening to old records with Sam on lazy Sunday mornings. Playing baseball with Rhodey and Steve. Playing chess with the Vision, determined to win even though it was impossible. That one time Happy had picked him up from school early so they could get ice cream. Going to the zoo with Thor, who was convinced giraffes were fake and needed solid visual proof of their existence. Tony putting the Iron Man helmet on Peter while they worked together in the lab, commenting on how it made Peter look like a bobble head. Aunt May hugging him goodbye the morning she was killed by a drunk driver. Sitting at the lunch table with Ned and Michelle, talking about...what were they talking about? Peter couldn't remember. The memory was ripped from his grasp before he could finish processing it.
"He's not gone. You said it yourself, he still has his snarky attitude. So he's still Jarvis," Steve reasoned with him. "You got him back. That's what matters, right? You can build new memories with him."
Tony smirked. He leaned his chair back and put his feet on the dashboard, wanting to spite Bucky. But the soldier didn't seem to care. They drove the rest of the way in silence. It wasn't until they were seated at the restaurant that Bucky started talking again.
Spider-man's lenses narrowed in rage. "You're twisted! Fucked in the head! I'm a human being and you can't just-"
"Bingo." Iron Man shoved Bucky's head forward, nearly breaking his nose on the concrete floor. The weight was lifted from Bucky's back, and the soldier pushed himself to his knees. He looked over his shoulder to see Iron Man retreating to the corner. He bent one of his legs up, looking at the bottom of his foot. The repulsor had shot a hole straight through the sole of his shoe. Iron Man cursed and stomped his foot. "Get out."
"Workshop. As always," Sam reported. "I tried to stop by earlier, but he had the place on lockdown."
"Hey, Shellhead!" Steve smiled brightly at Iron Man, who had just entered the living room. Iron Man slowly approached Steve, looking him up an down as he did so. Steve hadn't bothered changing out of his work out clothes. He didn't really need to, considering he had hardly broken a sweat. "Thought you and Bucky were out for the day?"
"Doesn't matter. He's a robot. Sure, he can think for himself, but he doesn't have an ounce of humanity in him. I could never love someone like him."
The dragon was now right behind him. Steve pressed his back to the door and raised his shield. Black smoke billowed out of the dragon's mouth. The orange light was back. The shield wouldn't be enough to save Steve. But there was nowhere left for him to run.
"Okay..." Steve sighed, "Spidey. I think we accidentally skipped you when we were doing our reports. Anything happening in Queens?"
After a while, the three of them migrated to Tony's lab. He was helping May build a robot dog, and they were at the stage where the dog could freely walk around on its own, even do a few tricks. Rhodey was amazed at how good Tony was with kids. He spoke softly to May, never once losing his patience when she didn't understand something. He took his time to explain things in ways that a four-year-old would understand. The look on Tony's face was gentle and relaxed. He adored May. He adored her with all his heart.
"Peter," Tony brushed his thumb over Peter's cheek, wiping away his tears. Peter flinched at the contact.
"Iron Man told us he could feel pain? And was begging us to help him?" Bucky hissed. "Yes. It was. But that doesn't matter anymore. What matters is that he's gone after that psychopath while he himself is mentally unstable!"
"He's the reason you were kicked off the Avengers, wasn't he?" Osborn guessed. "I can have him killed much easier than it would be for me to bring him to you alive."
"Tony. Look at me." Steve pulled Tony into his arms. Tony let out strangled gasp and squirmed in Steve's arms, his hands outstretched for the invisible body. "LOOK AT ME, TONY." Steve ordered. His friend looked up through watery eyes. "There's no one there, Tony. No one. You didn't kill anyone."
"He better..." Bucky sniffed. He'd never forgive himself if Tony died alone in that cold suit of armor.
"I can't just sit here and do nothing! God knows what they could be doing to my son!" Tony waved his hands wildly in the air.
"Damn," Clint slumped against the wall, his gaze slowly scanning the room. The communal area of the compound was huge, rivaling the one they had at the tower. Now it was even bigger, thanks to a large portion of the walls and ceiling having been destroyed. The windows were long gone, sharps of glass littered all over the room. The furniture was beyond salvageable.
Blinding white pain ripped through Tony's very being. It was so much that he couldn't even muster up a cry of pain. He looked down to see one of the Iron Spider's extra limbs impaled just under his rib cage. It had broken right through Tony's own armor. FRIDAY assured him that the wound wasn't deep enough to be concerning, but Tony thought otherwise, judging by the pain. Spider-man ripped the limp away with a sickly squelch. Blood spewed down the front of the Iron Man suit.
Peter let out a strangled scream and clawed at his chest. Tony tried to stop Peter from hurting himself, but he was no match for his super strength.
"I know you do. But we still don't know how to remove them without damaging the tissue in your arms," Tony sighed.
"Uh oh..." Natasha looked up. Several helicopters were advancing on their location. Even more Quinjets appeared above them, their stealth modes lifted. Natasha wondered how long they had been there. High above them all was a Helicarrier.
Bucky had decided that morning that he was going to take Tony out to lunch. So he could have an honest to goodness fresh meal for once.
"You used to. You probably won't remember them now. Their names are Otto and Adrian," Wanda explained. "I'm not as fond of them as you are, however, Stark has an army to back him up, so we're going to need all the help we can get."
Iron Man pulled the blankets up over Steve's still form. He hesitated before brushing a hand through his ruffled blonde hair. "Goodnight." Iron Man whispered.
"Doctor Banner," a voice spoke from the driver's seat. Bruce stepped onto the bus and handed the driver the folder. They flipped through the papers within. The words "Family Business" were stamped at the top of each page in small black letters. "This all of it?"
Steve sighed in relief. "I need you to slow down so we can pick you up. We'll go into stealth mode once you're on board."
Iron Man walked around the room while he waited, inspecting the old computers. There was a thick layer of dust over everything.
"How sweet. Jesus Christ!" Tony nearly had a heart attack when Peter let go of him. The teen free fell for a moment before catching himself on a web. "Don't do that!"
Bucky glared at Tony until the other man was forced to meet his gaze. He put his hands on either side of his head and made an upwards motion, silently telling Iron Man to take off the helmet. Tony shook his head. Bucky sighed.
"Like I said, we're not dating. But I'm will go check on him," Steve left the room before Bucky or Rhodes could stop him. The two exchanged another look. The Captain shouldn't be able to get past the heavy locked doors. But there was nothing on this earth that could stop Captain America's pure determination.
"Spider-man! Where are you going?! What happened to sticking to the plan?!" Iron Man yelled over the comms. He had a small map in the corner of his screen, showing everyone's approximate location. Spider-man had taken a sudden left turn, heading right for the origin of the loud bang.
"No, no." Wanda wrapped an arm around Peter's shoulders, "you poor thing, you really don't remember anything, do you? That damn Stark..."
Rhodes' image was pushed to the corner of the screen, a blurry image of the missile taking up the rest of it. There was no mistaking the Stark Industries logo on the side.
"We have punching bags for a reason. You didn't have to take your anger out on yourself," Steve sighed. "Or your workshop..." he looked around sadly, knowing how much this place meant to Iron Man.
The chart showed Spider-man vitals. It was reporting an increased heart rate and a significant amount of blood loss. Another chart with his skeleton showed several of his ribs and his left arm highlighted in bright red, signaling they had been broken. Tony felt his own blood run cold. He swiped to the next screen. A tiny red dot was bouncing around a tight area in Queens. Tony picked his phone back up, "Happy, how close are you to-"
"I'm not ready for that," Tony finished wiping up the spill and tossed the rag over the back of a chair. "I don't know if I ever will be, honestly."
Tony spoke up, "I got the Hulk mostly contained-fuck. Nevermind. I can do this. Rhodes, go help the cap!"
"Good morning, Peter," Steve said, making the teen jump and hit his head on a cupboard with a loud thump. "How are you feeling?"
Tony ripped the keys out of the ignition and grabbed his suit out of the back seat, which was currently folded up in the shape of a briefcase. There was no way he would be able to follow the bikes through this traffic.
"No. We give him five more minutes. Bucky and I will go down there if there's still no word." Steve reported.
They flew together in silence for awhile, heading north along the mountain range. The clouds started getting thicker, and the air colder.
"No. God no." Tony drew in a shaky breath. Steve moved closer and wrapped his arms around the trembling man.
"About last night..." Tony whispered. Peter had woken up screaming multiple times last night, causing Tony to come running from his lab every time. Peter was inconsolable after whatever nightmares he had just experienced, and Tony could do nothing but hold his son in his arms until he cried himself back to sleep. "I have nightmares, too. Comes free with the purchase of a lifetime supply of PTSD."
Steve used his shield to knock a Hydra agent out of the way. He vaulted over the banister, letting himself drop several floors and using his shield to break his fall. Bucky jumped down after him. Steve slowly rose to his feet, facing the long hallway that led from the stairs. The lights were flickering.
"Okay, but isn't 'Iron Man' a little weird?" Clint went on, waving a hand in the air. "I mean, he goes on and on about wanted to be treated like a normal person, so shouldn't he have a normal person name?"
"Children," Natasha shook her head. Steve chuckled. He flipped to a blank page and did several quick gesture drawings of the two men.
Steve still had the remains of Spider-man's costume, shoved in the back of a desk drawer. He hadn't told anyone about it. As of right now, he was the only one in on the truth. He wasn't sure if Peter knew that Steve knew. To be honest, Steve wasn't sure what to do with this new found information. Should he tell the team and risk both Tony and Peter's wrath?
Tony lifted his face plate, "thanks..." He downed the entire bottle in one go and crushed the plastic in his fist. "Is Peter still here?"
"I don't want your damn promises," Pepper snapped. "I don't care if you're mad at him. I would be too. And you had every right to break up with him. What you
"Okay, fine. The old man wants to talk to you, kid." The speaker was muffled as the phone was passed to Tony.
Tony wasn't able to give his all in the fight, not with so many bystanders, but he was doing his best. He and Osborn were currently locked in a fight, hovering about a hundred feet above the main battle. What happened next was a blur. A new wave of goblins swarmed around Tony, throwing what looked like...pumpkins? Yes, definitely pumpkins, at the Avenger. The bright light they emitted caused Tony to momentarily black out. He heard multiple people screaming his name over the comms. He wasn't aware that he had been falling until he hit the ground.
Tony nodded, knowing Steve was right, but also knowing that this was the first time Peter had ever gotten blood on his hands. The past week the teen had been walking around the compound like a ghost, not speaking and hardly eating or sleeping. What if he didn't come back from this. Tony fiddled with a loose string on his jeans. "You know...sometimes, I think about what it would be like if I never recruited Peter. Never took him to Berlin to fight. If I had just let him be."
"It went," Steve nodded slowly as he scanned the area. The living room was decked out in Christmas decorations, complete with a very large, overly adorned tree by the window. That wasn't there when he left a few days ago.
"I meant that in a good way. He's smart, strong, and has more attitude than you and Clint combined. Peter's going to be just fine."
Peter nodded and slipped out of the vehicle. Happy frowned. Was Peter limping? Had he gotten hurt while on patrol last night? It had taken Peter all of five minutes to find the new tracker in his suit and rip it out. So Happy had no way of knowing what had happened to the teen these past few days. He tried tracking his phone, but Peter left it at home when he went out on patrol.
Steve sat completely still, back pressed against the stone wall. Human bones lay scattered around the soldier, along with other remains. Burnt clothing. Tufts of hair. A few fingers. What looked like a jaw, part of the tongue still attached.
"I didn't want to hurt you, Peter. Wanda was the one who wanted to see you bleed. I just wanted to help you," Bruce sighed, dropping his hand. "I wanted to help you reach your full potential."
"You aren't going to be fighting jack shit until that burn heals." Tony snapped, yanking Peter's mask off. "It's been how long since we escaped SHIELD? Five hours? Six at most? Lay down and let your body rest."
That one takes Steve a bit longer to wrap his head around. Why does the robot act so human? Of course, if Iron Man's creator could build such an advanced piece of machinery, then, of course, they could make his mannerism just as advanced. But who thought it was a good idea to give a robot attitude? The amount of sass Iron Man gave Steve on a daily basis was baffling. According to Nick Fury, Iron Man's creator was Tony Stark, who had died a few years ago. Fury also said that Stark had a bad sense of humor, one that he had passed on to his robotic child.
The Avenger smiled at that, "you're a tough kid. But Stark can't protect you forever. Not like he was doing a very good job of it in the first place."
Steve was silent for a moment, searching Iron Man's face for something he knew wouldn't be visible. "Do you ever get nightmares?"
"Peter? What does he have to do with this?" Spidey turned on the tablet by tapping the screen. His lenses blinked, surprised to see his own X-rays and list of injuries. As well as grainy video footage of himself, dressed in civilian clothes, running away from several heavily armed men. The footage was only a few seconds long, due to him and his attackers disappearing into an alley. Another video showed the men making their escape in a black van. No license plate.
"I see. Stranger things have happened on my world," Thor didn't question it one bit. "My brother has a thing for horses."
"I want her to be able to live a normal life. I don't want her crim fighting. Or having to keep looking over her shoulder. If she develops powers later on, then I'll help her learn to use them. But for now, she's better off this way.." He had said.
Peter bit back a cry of pain when his spider sense exploded again. Someone was in the lab. Heavy metallic footsteps echoed throughout the room. Peter yelped in surprise when a laser suddenly cut through the vent, less than a foot from his face. He made a move to crawl backward, but a second laser cut through behind him. With a crash, the section fell to the floor, with Peter still inside. Iron Man grabbed him by the arm and hauled him to his feet.
Natasha did as she was told. Both Avengers stared at the newly opened file in shock. "I don't believe it..." Natasha's mouth hung open as she scrolled through the document. "Stark, you bastard..."
." He stomped on Iron Man's head. Steve wanted to scream. Wanted to fling himself at Obadiah, rip him apart. Make him hurt for daring to even look at Anthony.
"Mom an' pop shop in Colorado," Natasha reported. "Owner said this fell out of the sky two months ago. Hit her on the head. She had it on display in the window, saying it was alien tech."
"Yeah, we're not quite...there yet," Tony pat Peter on the shoulder. "He calls me Stark when he's pissed at me. Which happens a lot. So today's a good day if he's calling me Tony."
"Dude, it's been almost two months. We thought you were dead," Michelle scooted the swivel chair closer to the bed where Peter and Ned sat. Peter had shown up at Ned's house around midnight, with no explanation other than he needed a place to stay. Ned had texted Michelle right after. She had to sneak in through the fire escape because Ned's parents were asleep.
"Spider-man said he had it under control," Tony pried Steve's hand off, "I have more important things to worry about."
They could hear metal clashing against metal somewhere ahead. Along with the roar of Iron Man's repulsors. The walls shook with one of the more powerful blasts.
"Fury gave me his word that he wouldn't pursue Iron Man. On the condition that Iron Man turn himself in by the end of the week." Steve sighed. "That's how long the council gave Fury to arrest Iron Man. He said that once the week is up, not even he can stop whatever horrors the council decides to unleash on Iron Man. But if he turns himself in they'll literally tear him apart. Either way, Iron Man is a dead man walking."
Tony sighed. "C'mon. Osborn's office isn't too far from here. We'll check there and then we'll leave." When the three reached Osborn's private office they were surprised to find the owner sitting behind the desk. Or rather, a holographic image of the owner. The blue hologram illuminated the otherwise dark room.
"I don't know what's happening, but I want no part of this," Sam held up his hands and moved to a different couch.
"My boy...I killed my boy..." Tony reached out and stroked his hand over empty air. "There's blood in his hair...w-what...what do I do, Steve?"
"We might not have to!" Clint pointed out. There hadn't been any new bots, and there weren't many of the previous waves left standing.
"Um...how about you don't erase my mind?" Spider-man spoke up. "I have finals next month and I kinda need my brain."
"No, it wasn't." Tony nodded, "I had all records and data concerning the project stored on my private servers. Someone stole them. Along with some other very important documents. I haven't been able to figure out who did it."
"I was. I got over it. He's family. And I will always trust him with my life. He had his reasons for staying hidden, and I don't hold it against him anymore." Natasha fluttered around the kitchen, putting on a pot of coffee and throwing some bread into the toaster. "The others are upset. But they all still adore Iron Man. They can't stay mad at him forever."
Okay, so this chapter was originally just about Peter and Bruce, but then I got an idea for how to torment Tony and also sneak a bit of Stony into this story. And then the chapter just evolved into something completely different than what was originally drafted...
Rhodey blinked, a bit taken aback by his hostility. "But you love Steve. Don't you want to see him?"
"You're not in band. Anyway, The Avengers are all up my ass about this. And they aren't going to leave me alone until they get answers. Happy will pick you up from school on Friday. End of discussion."
"Because the armor is the one doing the walking. My legs are just dead weight inside it," Tony explained. He took a long sip of the now cold coffee.
Peter straightened up. He had never met Thor in person. The god had been MIA since the Ultron incident.
"Don't kill him too soon. Make him suffer. And make him know you did it." Wanda's voice spoke in the back of Peter's head. "I want to hear him
"Yes, he does," Tony growled. "Tony Stark was a monster. The merchant of death. That's what they called him. And they were right. The world wants to believe that Stark died in Afghanistan. Let them. Now get out."
"I think you've 'helped' enough, Stark. We saw everything," Fury walked calmly over to the Avenger. "On top of everything else that you are currently being arrested for, you can add attempted murder and child abuse to that list."
"Stay where you are, kid." Sam was speaking now, his voice calm. "We see you. Just stay where you are."
"Human Experimentation." Iron Man's voice was barely audible. He was facing Steve, but Steve could tell his eyes weren't focused on him. "But, like I said. I took care of it. We should go."
"I know how to fight. Remind me, who was it that broke you all out of the Helicarrier? And who did that without his armor?"
"Where did you find this?" Steve turned the bolt over in his palm, carefully examining the bright red paint on the end of it.
The assassin stopped walking and faced Peter, "has it ever spoken before? I thought it was just an extra sense. Eyes don't talk."
Tony thought with a shake of his head. He returned Peter to his room and tucked him in. He sat on the edge of the bed, watching the spider crawl back into his tank and disappear under some leaves.
"You can go back to calling the shots when you stop acting like a lovesick puppy," Bucky rolled his eyes.
"Shut up, punk," Bucky manhandled Tony into the car and slammed the door in his face. "You need to get out of the facility." He said once he got in the driver's seat. He had already put the child locks on, just in case Tony decided to make a run for it.
"I will...later," Steve hummed. Iron Man looped an arm around him and pressed his mouth to the top of Steve's head. "You're awful affectionate, today. Not that I'm complaining," Steve gave him a loving smile.
Steve lounged on the couch in Iron Man's lab, working in his sketchbook while the robot repaired one of Falcon's wings. AC/DC was playing softly in the background. It had been blaring loudly until Steve asked that it be turned down. Steve had tried to get him to play different music in the past, but Iron Man was very enthusiastic about his music tastes and refused to do so. Currently, Iron Man was playing the same song on loop, just to piss Steve off. Steve had half a mind to hit him over the head with a wrench. He glanced up every now and then at the robot who seemed to have made it his life's mission to push Steve's buttons. Iron Man had been in the same spot for the past three hours, making it easy for Steve to draw him in great detail. The conversation he had had with Clint and Bucky a few days ago was still fresh in his mind.
This chapter was intense, and I promise the next one will be toned down. Tony is in great need of happy times with his Avengers family.
Also, I'm picturing Anthony's costume being something like the second Superior Spider-man one, with the black lenses and the gauntlets.
"Tony! Do you have Peter?!" Steve ran over to him. Iron Man was clearly holding something in his arms, but he kept his back to them. Tony didn't say anything, he just hurried inside. Several nurses rushed to meet him, taking the figure from his arms and carting him away on a hospital bed. Tony hurried after them, not wanting to leave his son.
"I don't want to have to keep putting you back together," Steve was using his "no-nonsense Captain America" tone. "I don't want to see you in pain ever again. Next time, I'm going to have your back. I promise." He kissed Iron Man's forehead.
Tony and Steve whirled around. Harry Osborn stood in the doorway. "Avengers business," Tony answered, earning a kick to the shin from Steve.
"I heard you, Captain Rogers. I am...in shock...over Wanda's actions." Vision looked sadly at Steve.
"I need a minute with him," Steve said to Rhodey and Bucky. "Alone." Tony heard a pair of footsteps exiting the door. There was a minute of silence before Steve spoke again. "Anthony."
Obadiah flipped Iron Man over and proceeded to shatter the protective glass on the arc reactor. He reached into the suit and yanked the device free. "Just power down..." He whispered as if comforting a terrified child. He tossed the reactor just out of reach.
"Spidey! Let's go!" Wanda called. Peter tucked the picture back into his belt before walking out to meet her. The three headed along the empty subway tunnel for almost an hour before sunlight started trickling in. The sun had begun to set, casting a warm orange glow onto the city below. Peter held up his hand, shielding his eyes from the bright light. The area they had arrived at looked like some kind of junk yard. Wanda ripped a worn out tarp away from a group of motorcycles. "The quinjet is too easy to follow. Good thing Bruce hid these for us."
Peter took several steps back. It had been awhile since he had been on the receiving end of Tony's anger. "Sorry-"
Bruce Banner sat alone at a bus stop, a folder resting on his lap. It was nearly midnight, and the buses wouldn't start running for another five hours at least. And yet, one such vehicle pulled up to the curb. The door swung open with a loud squeak.
This chapter was a bit more serious than the others. I'm trying to keep this light-hearted, but sometimes the plot calls for angst.
"You're Peter's friend. We need you to talk to him. Find out everything he remembers about the people who attacked him. And I mean everything," Tony explained. "Once we figure out who these guys are, you can plan our next moves."
"NEVER." Wanda boomed, red light exploding from her body and sending everyone within range sailing across the hangar.
"Of course you do," Bruce grumbled. The more he thought about it the more Thor's mindset made sense. He had forgiven Loki for a great deal of things. Tony's wrongdoings were practically nonexistent compared to the evil Loki had done. Thor gave his friend a pleading look, begging him to see reason. Bruce just shook his head and continued on down the hallway.
Bruce frowned. He looked Peter over for a moment, taking in his battered form. "You disappoint me, Peter. We could have done great things together."
"Did you seriously want me to come here just so you could tell me your evil plan?" Iron Man's tone was light, as if he were about to laugh. "Guess I shoulda seen that coming!"
Tony stayed at his side awhile longer, watching over him while he slept. Tony rubbed his eyes. Images of Peter lying dead and bloodied still fresh in his mind. The hallucinations hadn't stopped. He had just learned to live with them. The armored Avenger stopped telling Steve about them, though he suspected Steve still knew they were happening. Suddenly the teenager before him was covered in crimson. The thick liquid dripping from his mouth onto the white pillow. Tony grabbed Peter's wrist, feeling for a pulse. There was none. Tony screwed his eyes shut. This was just an illusion. It wasn't real. Peter was safe. And very much alive. Taking a deep breath, Tony forced himself to look at Peter. Sure enough, he was just fine. No blood. Peter's side rose and fell at a slow, steady pace.
Iron Man drummed his fingers on the armrest, thinking for a few minutes. "You still haven't seen Star Wars, have you?"
Exactly one minute later, Iron Man crashed through the window of his former Malibu mansion. The place was an absolute wreck. Glass shards littered the floor. Holes dotted the walls. Scorch marks covered every surface. The couch was even on fire.
"I thought so too," Tony muttered. He refused to turn around. He knew the team was angry with him and couldn't bring himself to face them. Hell, he was angry with himself for fucking up again. He had made Ultron to help his teammates. But it turned around and tried to kill them. Steve had been
"I don't know. I'll send a postcard when I get there," Tony lied. He knew exactly where he was going. And what he was planning on doing when he got there.
Tony yawned loudly. He stumbled blindly through the compound on his way to the kitchen. Hair a mess, and still in the clothes he had worn the day before. He may or may not have fallen asleep at his workbench. And it may or may not already be past noon. Something had happened to Jarvis. Some kind of virus had gotten into his personal servers and completely ripped apart his AI. He had been working nonstop for the past few days to fix him, but there wasn't much left to fix. Tony was doing his best, and in the end, he knew he would be able to fix the AI, although Jarvis wouldn't be the same as before. There was no replacing the memories the AI lost.
