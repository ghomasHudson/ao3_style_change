“No, baby,” Mycroft said, unable to keep from calling Bunny his baby when he was looking at him with such adorable innocence.  “They’re for Sherlock.”
Daddy came to realize that Bunny was in no state to care about getting cleaned up at the moment, could see that Bunny’s tears were about far more than a wet bed.
John knew it was useless to attempt to restrain Sherlock at the moment.  All he could do was watch and ensure the man didn't harm himself.  Sherlock kicked or pulled apart each puzzle in turn, growling and muttering to himself about lost pieces and ruined pictures.  When the puzzles were nothing more than scattered pieces strewn about on the floor, he lost some of the fight, and slumped onto the carpet, dropping his head into his hands.  He began to cry.
Sherlock kicked at Mycroft from beneath the blankets, and Mycroft clucked his tongue in warning, which made Sherlock stop.  He was frustrated and sick of being uncomfortable and unable to sleep because of his coughing fits, which of course Bunny didn’t seem to have.  Everything always went Bunny’s way.
“Do you need your Daddy?” Sherlock tried when John did not respond, possibly misunderstanding John’s thoughtful silence with distress.
Mycroft nodded, finishing his cup of tea and pouring himself and John another glass.  John took the sippy cup, unscrewed the nozzled top, and drank the orange juice from the cup.
Bunny was sulking in the backseat of Papa’s car, arms crossed and feet perched on the seat so he could press his knees against his chest and make it more difficult for Daddy to fasten his seatbelt.  He had thrown Willa the rabbit into the footwell alongside his cast-away pacifier, and was currently glaring at Daddy, who was climbing into the passenger seat after placing Sherlock and Bunny’s overnight bags into the trunk.
Greg nodded, then stood from the rocking chair with the boy in his arms.  The boy pointed to the pacifier on the bedside table, and Greg pocketed it, telling the boy he could have it as soon as his timeout was all finished.
The room was dark and the space under the blankets warm and comfortable, but Greg could hear one of the boys just outside their bedroom door, and knew he would not be returning to sleep anytime soon.  He forced himself awake with a large intake of breath, propping himself up on an elbow as he allowed his vision to adjust to the darkened room.  In the glow of the nightlight from the hallway bathroom, he could just make out Sherlock’s hunched form hovering in the doorway, stuffed dinosaur dangling from one hand.
Greg could see that something had upset his kid.  He was hunched with his hands in his pockets, and he did not even glance up at Greg’s worried questioning.
And then Bunny was crying, which Greg knew was likely due to the guilt the boy felt over wetting his backseat.  He also knew there was no amount of verbal assurances that would convince Bunny that Greg was not upset, so instead he focused on showing the boy through his gentle actions as he helped him step out of his wet jeans and underwear and began wiping him down with baby wipes.
Sherlock shrugged and hid his face in Mycroft’s chest as his brother kissed the top of his head.  He was uncomfortable with the praise.  But he could not help but let Mycroft’s words warm him, could not help but believe he'd been a good boy.  It had been a trying night, and a trying few days.  But Sherlock had Mycroft all to himself for the moment, and, for now, that was enough.
“You’re such a smart boy,” he said, and Sherlock did not squirm away.  In fact, he was eager for his brother’s attention; he did not want to be alone.  He raised his arms towards Mycroft, who held out Sherlock’s pacifier before signalling for him to wait one moment.  Sherlock was left alone while Mycroft brought the last of the breakfast plates, utensils, and napkins used for clean-up into the kitchen, and then Mycroft was lifting him into his arms and carrying him to the kitchen, where they sat at the table.  Sherlock rested his cheek on Mycroft’s shoulder.
He’d been planning what he wanted to say in the event Mycroft came to check up on him.  He’d known it was a distinct possibility, particularly given the anger Greg had shown in the moments before John had retreated from the kitchen.  And while it would have been far easier to talk with Greg--understanding, progressive, supportive Greg, John knew it was important that he and Mycroft get on the same page, that they find a way to move forward without any lingering unease.
Mycroft did not address Greg’s apologies or emotional state.  If anything, he became even more aloof than he had been a moment before, clinical and cold.
But he was feeling young and alone in the room, and, now that he was awake, he wasn't sure he'd be able to get back to sleep.  The shadows in the room were angled and sharp like the slashing claws of monsters, and Sherlock suddenly just wanted Mycroft.  Mycroft would help if he asked him, but Sherlock was angry with him; Mycroft had chosen to put John to bed instead of him.  He hadn't forgiven Mycroft.  Besides, he was a bigger boy than the babyish and needy Bunny; he didn't need anyone's help.
“Hey, champ,” Greg called to Sherlock, as usual attempting to bring some positivity into the situation.  “Missed you.”
“Want to help me with the dishes, Bun?” Papa asked, and Bunny agreed while his Daddy settled down to finish his tea and read the London Times.  He’d arranged to have the paper delivered to the lake house each day they were staying.
And Greg understood.  John rarely spoke about his father, but the murder victim had been late-thirties, stocky in the shoulders but not particularly tall in stature.  It didn’t take a Holmes brother to discern that John had been somehow defending his own experiences with his father when they'd come up against Anderson’s snide remarks.
“They're wrong.  It would be wrong of us to tell Sherlock he shouldn’t like pirates, just as it’s wrong of Sherlock to tell you you shouldn’t like The Little Mermaid.  We like what we like, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  Understand?”
Mycroft turned to Sherlock expectantly when they were alone, and Sherlock, with an over-dramatic sigh, forced himself to eat.  He was relieved when Mycroft finally decreed he could be done and took away his half-empty plate.  Sherlock stayed seated at the table, running his fingers along the bevelled edge absent-mindedly.
Mycroft chuckled at the boy’s staunch efforts at clarification and reached forward to continue lathering the shampoo in his hair.
When he’d woken up the night before alone and afraid, and had gone to Mycroft with red cheeks as he shook him awake and asked him if he could wear a pull-up.  Mycroft had seemed to understand that Bunny had just needed the comfort they brought; after all, John had admitted he liked wearing them, that he took comfort in wetting himself.  It was only after he had been changed into a pull-up and tucked back into his bed in the purple bedroom and Mycroft was kissing his forehead that he realized he may not have gone to Mycroft simply for a pull-up, and after much hemming and hawing he had asked Mycroft if he could sleep in the bed with him and Uncle Greg.
There was a release of tension in the room as Greg chuckled and Sherlock huffed at the accusation that he would wet in the car.  The detective stormed back into the bathroom with a restatement that he was a full-grown adult.  He emerged a moment later, fully dressed in the clothing Mycroft had set out for him--trousers and a white t-shirt--and tossed a spare pull-up directly at John, who caught it before it had the chance to fall into his now empty breakfast plate.

Mycroft smiled; He would never admit to thinking so, but John would make an adorable little.  The idea had been in his mind since the day Sherlock had shouted that he was a bigger boy than John.  He had done his best to assure the man that he was there for him, although Mycroft had been too cowardly to simply come out and ask the man how he was feeling.  He was forming a bond with the doctor, that was for sure, but Mycroft hesitated when it came to expressing his feelings of mutual friendship for the man.
On his way out of the bedroom, Mycroft bent on the other side of the bed to straighten Sherlock’s tangled bed clothes.
Sherlock wrapped his arms close to his chest and pressed himself up against Mycroft, a signal that he wanted to be held.  Mycroft’s arms were around him in a moment, and Sherlock, sitting at the kitchen table in his brother’s arms, no longer felt anger or fear.  Mycroft had always been there for him, and that would never change.
John was grateful she left the door propped open to let in some of the light from the hallway.  His heart was beating wildly, confused and concerned and afraid over letting himself slip towards Bunny in the presence of a stranger.  He pulled the plush dog close, hugging it to his chest and desperately grateful for its presence, and gave in at long last to the tears that had been threatening to fall all day, which he tried to stifle by slipping his thumb into his mouth.
Sherlock considered ignoring Mycroft’s request, considered stomping right along through the trees and bushes in search of frogs.  But his brother’s voice was firm, and, as much as he wanted to cause Mycroft trouble, he also really wanted to stay outside to find frogs.  If he disobeyed, there was no way Mycroft would let him stay outside to play, and he’d be stuck inside with nothing to distract him from his sudden need to analyze each look Mycroft gave to the Bunny and to categorize his brother’s tone of voice in contrasting degrees of affection when he spoke to Sherlock and the Bunny.
Sherlock climbed over and jumped off the spare cot Uncle Greg had set up in Sherlock’s room in case John got scared and decided after all that he wanted to sleep with Sherlock.  He picked up a plastic dinosaur from where it had been left on the bedside table and made growling noises as he guided it to fly through the air.  John could see Uncle Greg look at his Daddy with raised eyebrows.
They shared a look of surprise before Mycroft stepped farther down the hallway to peer into Sherlock’s room.  The boy was still asleep, cuddling his plush dinosaur.  Mycroft pulled the bedroom door closed to keep the carried noise of John’s concerned mumblings from waking his brother.
Sherlock nodded.  They had had the conversation many times before; Mycroft did not need to reiterate what the boy already knew.  Conversely, he needed to reassure the boy that big brother was there for him, that he could always trust him to help put things back into order.  There were a few key ways Mycroft could do that for Sherlock, but only the kid could tell him which one he needed at the moment.
John was leaving for his sister’s later that day, and although Greg had told Mycroft to remain optimistic, he couldn’t help but let precedent dictate his feeling that the man was about to have his hopes for Harriet’s sobriety dashed.  He and Sherlock had invited John to Christmas at their parents’, and Greg had invited him to his own family’s celebrations, but John had insisted on accepting Harry’s invite, trusting his sister’s assurances that she had her life back on track, that she was looking forward to John meeting her new girlfriend.
“Of you,”  he said, passing over a sippy cup he must have filled before carrying Sherlock downstairs.  “You took care of Bunny when he needed it earlier tonight, and you called for help when you saw he was in trouble.  You were a very good big brother, tonight.”
“Little boys need some extra help, sometimes, and that’s okay.”  It was Greg’s way of reminding John that he’d just stated his desire to be little, his way of reinforcing what John already knew to be true: pull-ups could only help John to age down.
After a moment of well-intentioned snogging, Sherlock seemed to realize that John hadn’t gotten off, and he got the energy to pull at John’s upper body until John was settled above him, knees on either side of Sherlock’s hips.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft demanded, now closer to the space where Bunny was scrambling to his feet.  “Come here.”
Bunny clambered up onto the mattress and leaned into Mycroft, pulling the man's arm around his shoulders.
And as seemed to be becoming progressively the case with Sherlock, Greg’s steady, down-to-earth presence grounded the man far more than Mycroft ever could.  Mycroft could visibly see a bit of the anger leave Sherlock, an anger surprisingly replaced by a slight tinge of pink along Sherlock’s cheeks as he held the pull-up in his hand in front of Greg.
“Quiet,” Mycroft said, smirking through his ragged breath as he bodily turned Greg over and, propping himself up with hands beside each of Greg’s shoulders, bent to kiss him.  “You’ll wake the kids.”
John was hesitant.  Sherlock rarely showed any displays of affection while in public, at times went out of his way to defray any suspicions that they were a couple.  John knew these were his own hang-ups, not Sherlock’s, that if it weren’t for John’s ridiculous aversion to others thinking he was gay, Sherlock would not waste any energy attempting to uphold the friends illusion.
“Is he going to win?” Bunny asked, fork paused halfway to his mouth as he watched intently, concerned when the evil forces seemed to be gaining ground on the hero.
“Not a baby,” Sherlock repeated, quieter this time given the surprised glances he’d received after his little outburst.
John softened his face to let Mycroft know he harbored no hard feelings, and the man smiled slightly until a thought seemed to cross his mind and his face stilled once more.
“Alright, love,” he said, because it was suddenly clear that Mycroft was not only struggling to protect Sherlock, but struggling to somehow make up for actions he had not taken in childhood, struggling to overcome his residual guilt.
When Greg closed the car door and began leading them inside, Bunny slipped his hand into Greg’s, and Greg gave it a squeeze.  The store was fairly empty for a late Saturday morning, which Greg could sense calmed John immensely.  He grabbed a trolley, and John followed close beside.
“No,” Sherlock said, seeming to interrupt as Mycroft said something which obviously frustrated the consulting detective.  He turned away from the closet and lowered his voice.  “Would you get over yourself, Mycroft?  It’s the baby.”
John knew he should pull himself together and assure Greg’s mother that he was just fine.  He should suck it up and put on a brave face and trek back into the family room to wait out the rest of the evening.  But, exhausted and frustrated and already tipped towards the wrong side of headspace, he found himself nodding, pleased to have the decision taken from him.  She gestured for him to follow, then led him down the hallway and upstairs to a bedroom crowded with trophies and football posters.
Lots of angst/comfort in this chapter.  221bCupOfTeaAndSherlock requested some Greg/Sherlock love, which was a perfect direction to take this chapter.  Thanks for the suggestion!
The man had done well with the conversation, and Mycroft was pleased.  He settled on patting Sherlock's arm goodnight.
Because he knew they were alone in the house, that Greg would not be back with John for at least another two hours given the drive and the shopping time, Mycroft began to sing.  Mycroft only half-remembered the lyrics of the old lullaby, and hummed the melody whenever he came to a section of words he’d long ago forgotten.  But he had never found anything quite as effective at calming his brother, and Sherlock never seemed to mind that the song was a hodgepodge of remembered words and Mycroft’s improvisation.
“No arguments,” he said.  “For now, lunch is ready.  Head on downstairs before it gets cold, and Papa will clean up the spill on the carpet.”
“You don’t have to be potty training if you don’t wish to be, kiddo,” Mycroft assured.  “You can take it at your own pace.  There’s lots of history, there.  It’s understandable that putting yourself back into that mindset is difficult.”
If he were honest with himself, John was feeling a bit on edge, caught between the clarity of his adult mind and the lingering vulnerability of the previous night, uneasiness keeping his younger headspace creeping into his thoughts.  It wasn't rare for thoughts of John's father to enter into his thoughts, but it was rare for them to affect John so keenly.  He'd spent a lifetime steeling himself against his father's influence; it was disconcerting to find himself strangely plagued by the man's gruffness once more.
After bundling the boy back into his towel to keep him from catching a chill, he ushered him to the master bedroom.  Sherlock’s room was still a mess of broken lamps and light bulbs, of duvets cast off beds and cushions tossed around the room in what Greg assumed had been an earlier fit of Sherlock’s anger.  He would clean up the kid’s room once he’d gotten him settled down for a nap.  For now, he thought it best that Sherlock be taken to a neutral space, away from reminders of the low points of his morning.  He knew there was a clean basket of the boys’ laundry in the master bedroom, which saved him from having to root through Sherlock’s room for clean clothes.
“Nah, he definitely wasn't the problem.  It takes a pretty shitty home life to send a guy scrambling to a place like this,” Anderson said, laughing along with the bald man.
“Let’s get you out of that yucky pull-up, sweetheart,” Mycroft said, pulling Bunny by the arm a bit closer to where he was kneeling in front of the tub.  Mycroft had rolled his shirtsleeves up past his elbows before turning on the faucet.
Mycroft glanced up from the computer screen and stopped typing, watching as Greg leaned against the doorframe with his eyebrows raised, expectantly.
Mycroft had been with John the entire day, in both his adult and child headspaces, but, emotionally, they had avoided each other for Sherlock’s sake, a silent agreement passing between them to put Sherlock’s needs first until the stress of the day had been resolved.  It was comforting to be able to settle back into the role he knew was best for John, grounding to be able to care for John completely once more.
“That’s what you said this morning at breakfast, too,” Papa said.  “It’s clear you haven’t been eating well.  So you can either take them with you upstairs, or you can sit at the table and I’ll monitor the number of bites you take.”
“Ladybugs!” He said loud enough to make his throat hurt.  He grimaced and lowered his volume.  “Thank you, thank you, thank you Daddy.”
Papa nodded, and Sherlock whined again.  He knew he should have changed out of the wet pull-up.  He’d had diaper rash before, had suffered through the biting pain and the irritation.  He hated it; it made him feel like such a baby when Mycroft had put rash cream on him.
“I think it’s best if we take a little break from potty training, buddy,” he said, opening the fridge to find the half-empty apple juice container.  “It’s all been a bit too much too soon, I think.”
“We haven’t even met the boyfriend,” one of Greg's brothers said conspiratorially, leaning close to John as if removing Greg from the conversation.  “We’ve taken to calling him the mystery man.”
Bunny nodded immediately, cheeks reddening.  Uncle Greg seemed to catch on to what the others already knew, clucking his tongue in understanding.
“Yes,” he said.  “You’re a boy who likes mermaids and bunnies and unicorns.  Just like there are girls who like pirates and cars and dinosaurs.”
Mycroft could see that Greg was not happy.  He was looking at Mycroft with an expression that conveyed both anger and disappointment as they sat in the kitchen in the wake of Bunny’s tears and distressed fleeing from the kitchen.
And then it was Mycroft's turn to sigh.  John’s anger was something they'd previously just let run its course, the child-John so rarely succumbing to its vice grip that they'd somehow kept from needing to deal with it while ageplaying.  That said, it was irresponsible of them not to have prepared for the possibility.  John had suffered a PTSD nightmare and a panic attack the night before, had spent the morning struggling against self-disgust, shame, and shifting headspaces.  It was no wonder he’d acted out under pressure.
Sherlock had been ready for a tantrum all morning.  Uncle Greg had been able to prevent them so far--making Sherlock toast when he refused to eat the cereal Mycroft placed on the kitchen table, suggesting the compromise of Wellies and a sweatshirt when Sherlock refused to wear the jacket Mycroft held out to him before their trip outside in case the rain came earlier than forecasted--but Uncle Greg had needed to take a phone call from work, and there was no one to stop Sherlock from pitching a royal fit over the idea of being forced into time out and then forced into taking a nap if Mycroft were to force the issue.
“Three more big bites,” he said, and Bunny could tell he was attempting to be encouraging, that he was starting to suspect Bunny's concern.  “Then you can show Sherlock your new toys before naptime.”
Ageplay had done wonders for John’s anxiety brought on by his PTSD, something he had come to see during sessions with his therapist where she prodded for changes in his life in an attempt to find causation for his less apprehensive mindset.  He shrugged and told her he was doing nothing differently, not ready to express to her that he was coloring in princess coloring books and calling another man “Daddy,” but it had not been hard to realize the connection.  John may have come a long way since he had begun therapy, but he was, first and foremost, a private person.
“I'm not a monster, bud.  Would a monster know that your stuffed dinosaur is named Dmitri after the chemist Mendeleev? Or that you like to have handstand contests when you go swimming even though the water hurts your ears?  Or that your favorite meal is chicken nuggets and spaghetti with butter?”
“I’ll never stop liking you,” Sherlock said after a moment, stilling the worries in John's mind by addressing the question Bunny had first asked when burrowing against Sherlock to stave off the fear of the storm.  “I’m quite fond of you.”
“You have to be very careful with your choice of words, buddy,” he said, watching to make sure Sherlock kept eye-contact.  “When you said you didn’t like Bunny when she wasn’t normal, you had just said you didn’t like girls.  That made Bunny and Daddy and Papa think that you were calling Bunny abnormal for wanting to be a girl, which is a very mean thing to say.  Do you understand why that hurt Bunny?”
There was no answer when Mycroft knocked, at least none that he could hear through the closed door, and so there was nothing to do but open the door and peer into the room.  Mycroft heard John’s sniffling immediately, could see the man hunched fully beneath the sheet on his bed.  His wet clothing had been left in a trail on the floor, as if he pulled items off one by one until he reached the safety and comfort of his bed.
It was part of the nighttime routine: bath, teeth brushing, last pee before pull-up, and lights out.
“You can take a nap while we finish the movie, Daddy,” Bunny said as Mycroft carried him back to the living room.  “I’ll look after you.”
“I’m not a baby!” Sherlock spat.  He slammed his fork onto the table, suddenly angry that Mycroft would suggest something so childish.
“That will have to be Bunny’s decision, bud,” he said, twisting the top back onto the now-refilled sippy cup after diluting the juice with some water to keep Sherlock’s sugar intake down.  “You just worry about yourself.”
It was all too much.  Sherlock left his post against the dresser and paced the room.  He needed his mind to stop its furious whirling, to stop its self-deprecating commentary, its derogatory name calling.  He needed the headache to stop building, needed his desire for Mycroft and John to settle.
“That’s enough,” Greg said with a chuckle when John continued to brush vigorously far longer than was necessary.  “Good boy.  Now, spit.”
The kid glanced up at him after rubbing at his eyes again.  Greg guided his thumb away from his mouth, where it was once again hovering, by taking John's hand in his own.
Sherlock relented, letting his crossed arms drop as he began to move towards the door with a whine.  But just because he understood Mycroft’s job responsibilities did not mean he had to be happy about them.  He stomped his way out of the room, down the hallway, and all the way up the stairs--as loudly as he could--to prove his point that Mycroft was nothing but a mean big brother.
“Sherlock.  Listen to me,” he said, guiding Sherlock by the chin to look up at him.  “I love you very much, and I love your brother very much.  My relationship with Bunny will never replace  or change my relationship with you.  My role as Bunny’s Daddy does not alter the fact that being your big brother is the one of the most special parts of my life.”
“Just a little quiet time,” she said as she plumped the pillow on the bottom bunk, repeating the phrase with the same breed of nonchalant positivity Greg used when trying to get Bunny and Sherlock to take a midday nap.
“Adults have a need for the loo, too, brother mine,” Mycroft said, feel his patience with his brother slip.  For a man insisting that he wasn’t acting the toddler, he was certainly putting on a good show of it.  “You’re not a child for needing a piss.”
His sadness shifted into anger as he shifted up in headspace, and he hurled all the pillows from his bed in a fit of frustration, pleased when one caught the pirate ship lamp and sent it careening from the desk to the floorboards, shattering the ceramic figure of the lamp's base as well as the light bulb.
While his eyes were closed it was easy enough to envision himself sitting on the loo at home while he peed, but the spreading warmth in his briefs and jeans kept him from forgetting that he was in Papa’s car, and a blush spread to his cheeks as liquid began spreading.
“How’s your little troublemaker?” Greg asked, setting down two plates of roasted chicken and green beans at the kitchen table.  Greg had been trying to get Mycroft, who had survived for his years as a single man on takeaway and sandwiches, to eat a bit healthier.
“It’s possible he’s sublimating his rage,” Mycroft agreed.  “He’s still particularly vulnerable to feelings of inadequacy while young, and I’m sure he saw that way his own father’s anger contributed to his dysfunctional family dynamic while growing up.  He may be modifying his anger out of a fear of rejection. ”
Sherlock wasn’t supposed to at all, and especially not when he was young.  But the shards of ceramic from the broken pirate ship scattered along the floorboards had taunted him, and when they hadn’t been sharp enough to do more than scratch, the pieces of glass from the shattered light bulb glimmered with the promise of a far more destructive result.
“What would you like me to do?” Greg asked when they pulled apart.  “I can stay here and keep watch until he’s ready to come out.  Or it might be possible to get in through one of the windows if I climb up onto the roof of the back porch.”
Sherlock had tried to speak when they’d reached their flat, tried to provide his own breed of comfort, but John had ignored him, casting the man’s coat off and retreating to his bedroom, where he was currently huddled beneath the blankets in nothing but a t-shirt and his soaked briefs, pushing away the encroaching thoughts that his thumb might provide him a bit of comfort, that his plush rabbit was only a few steps away, closed in the closet.
Mycroft nudged Sherlock away from him so he could get him out of the dirtied pirate shirt, assuring Sherlock they would have it washed in no time.  John was waiting with the clean shirt he had brought out from Sherlock’s bedroom hours ago.  He strung it onto Sherlock’s raised arms as soon as Mycroft had whisked off the striped shirt, and between the two men, they had Sherlock clean and clothed.
It was John who pulled away after some time, making a distressed noise at the back of his throat and rutting himself quite forcefully against Sherlock’s hand.
John wasn't sure how he was doing.  He was relieved that he had heard from Harry, relieved she had been lucid enough to hold a conversation through text.  But the contrast between Greg's warm, tight-knit, and laughing family against his scattered, solitary, and uncommunicative own was disconcerting.
Sherlock nodded as he moved the sharks around underwater, bumping them into each other and then squeezing them to take water into their bellies.  He squirted water along the side of the tub next to him, giggling gently before coughing once more.  Greg counted himself lucky that Sherlock had woken up young and quiet.  He didn’t like the fact that his boys were both sick, but he did find it a relief that Sherlock was too tired to second-guess his behaviors and force himself older.  The warm tub was good for Sherlock’s congestion as well as his mental state, and was already setting the boy back into a sleepy complacency.
Greg made his way to the guest bedroom, happy at long last to climb into bed next to his little Bunny.
“A rusty old saxophone,” John said, leaning up against the headboard as he draped his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders.
“John? I’m stealing Sherlock away until Wednesday,” he called upstairs to a presumably sleeping Doctor Watson.  “Call me or Greg if you need anything.”
Sherlock was in the living room in a second, pulling out the new toys Papa and Bunny had picked out at the store the day before, which included his new lego set.
“Disappointed in yourself?” John looked up in a bit of shock, and Mycroft realized that John still found it surprising when Mycroft showed affection or care towards him.  "It wasn't your fault,” John said, and then stared down at the table.
And now Greg had gone and told a weepy and vulnerable little Sherlock that his brother and John had entered into a new breed of relationship than that which he had learned--at times, not easily--to come to terms with.  Greg was gutted; he had been able to read the pain on Sherlock’s face after the words had been spoken, had been able to see just how much the news had affected him.  Sherlock was skilled at hiding his emotions in all of his headspaces, but he had not been able to hide the betrayal he had felt in the moment, the betrayal Greg had no doubt the lad was still feeling.  The news had clearly shaken Sherlock to the core, and that was Greg’s fault.
But before he’d had a moment to process, a new problem presented itself.  In such close proximity to Bunny, Mycroft could smell urine.  A quick glance down to Bunny’s lap told him all he needed to know; given the fairly form-fitting nature of footed pajamas and the way Bunny was sitting with his legs tucked up under him, the bulk of a wet pull-up wasn’t hard to spot.
Bunny whined a bit, and hugged his rabbit and blanket closer to him, but he let Daddy remove the pacifier from his mouth.
“I, ah...yeah,” John fumbled, suddenly plagued with thoughts of his father--his gruff, no-nonsense, unforgiving father who had teased him for a ‘momma’s boy’ when a seven-year-old John had come crying to his mother with a skinned knee and chin after toppling over the handlebars of his bike.  “It’s fine.”
Whether Sherlock understood just how close he was to the edge, sensed that John was as emotionally spent as he was, or simply welcomed a bit of coddling as long as John didn’t name it out loud, John didn’t know.  Whatever the reason, Sherlock let his phone drop onto the carpet as he unfurled himself from the chair.  He wrapped his dressing gown around himself and shuffled into the kitchen to take a seat.
John blinked up at him.  A part of him saw how much easier that would be, how John could go on without needing to change his own day to day routine to meet Sherlock’s needs.   But there was another part of him that longed to know more about the way Mycroft could care for Sherlock, a part that longed to join in what he knew was exactly what his boyfriend needed.
Mycroft should have known the day held more obstacles to overcome.  He began untangling Bunny from the blankets, attempting to assess the damage.  The boy’s pull-up had obviously not been able to handle the volume of liquid, for the kid had also wet his pants and his bed.  There was wet patch on the sheets where he had been curled up, crying.  He was unconcerned about whether this had been an intentional wetting or, as Bunny said, an accident.  He assumed it was perhaps a bit of both, the boy not in a position to get himself to the bathroom and subconsciously desperate for the comfort he gained from wetting.
“You don’t like me, anymore,” he cried, unable to keep himself from giving into the desperate need for his brother’s reassurance.  But the words were mumbled into the crook of his arm, and Mycroft could not have understood.  Which was for the best, as far as Sherlock was concerned, considering the words brought a blush to his cheeks and sent him into louder, hitching cries.
Greg, by Mycroft’s side as he wiped down the kitchen table with a wet rag, leaned over to kiss the man on his temple in acquiescence, humming agreement.
Ma she didn't need to worry about you,” he said, smirking as an eyebrow quirked.  “Look at you.  You’ve found yourself your own little family.”
John felt a haziness of pleasure come over him as he struggled with his full bladder, shuddering at the painful fullness beneath his beltline.  The warmth and the pressure and the impending lack of control were almost titillating, and John was too far gone to feel guilt.
He knew it was the wrong thing to say, that it would draw attention to the fact that the door was locked and that Sherlock was nervous and stuttering, but he didn’t have time to worry about that at the moment.  He ducked to his knees and shoved his wet clothes as far under the bed as he could.  It was the quickest solution, and, with any luck, no one would look under that bed until the entire event was long past.
Three men who could only be Greg’s brothers stepped forward, each a variation of Greg’s broad-shoulders and warm eyes, his quick smiles and scruffy jawline.  It seemed at least two of them had not been present at the party before Greg had left to pick up John, for they both approached with cheerful welcomes.
“It’s okay, kid,” Greg said with compassion in his voice, reaching over to unbuckle the boy.  “You’re doing a good job holding it.  Let’s just get you inside so we don't have any accidents.”
“Take your plate to the sink, big boy,” Mycroft said with an amused laugh and a wink, and Bunny pushed his chair back from the table to do as he was told.
Sherlock may have accepted Bunny’s nightshirt and pink pull-ups the night before, but now there was less gentleness to his gaze, a hint of superiority tucked beneath his slightly furrowed eyebrows and some criticism hidden in the slight grin at the corner of his mouth.
Bunny took Sherlock’s hand and squeezed it.  Sherlock turned and smiled gratefully; John’s goodness shone through even when the man was in headspace in the same way that Sherlock knew his selfishness and irrationality shone through when he himself sunk down.  He wished he were better behaved, wished he didn’t feel such a blinding desire to act out and strop.
“One second,” Sherlock called again, knowing it was only a moment before Papa took more drastic measures to get the door open.  Sherlock wasn’t allowed to lock doors when he was young, not with his history of self-harm.  “Be right there!”
“I’ve got him,” he heard Mycroft say.  “Why don’t you take the little Bunny outside for a stroll before dinner?”
Bunny nodded and held out his ice cream cone, now dripping over his hand.  Sherlock leaned over to lick the melting treat, and Mycroft clucked his tongue and told Sherlock he should eat his sandwich before eating sweets, but even Little Sherlock could tell he was only speaking halfheartedly, and he said nothing as Sherlock continued to lick the ice cream cone.
John could not help but snort into his half-finished pint.  Sherlock did not look amused, pretending to be hurt by John’s laughter and vowing to give him the silent treatment for the rest of the night.  John apologized and half-heartedly consented to the fact that the origins of liquor certainly made for riveting party conversation.
The boy seemed all too relieved to be lifted from the sink cabinet, peeled out of his soiled clothing, and helped into the warm bath.  Mycroft rolled up his shirtsleeves and made quick work of washing the lad, paying careful attention to his inner thighs and genitals in order to ensure he was as clean as possible after his little potty accident.
“I maybe told him he wasn't allowed to go?” Sherlock said, voice inflection moving upwards as if he were asking a question.
John climbed the steps to 221b heavily.  He had just returned from where he and Sherlock had been finalizing a rather brutal case in Scotland, and although Sherlock had solved it, there were still loose ends to tie up which would keep him busy for at least another day.  John hadn’t slept more than an hour or two in four days.  He was exhausted, starving, and irritated with Sherlock, who had been distant and cocky the entire trip.
“Didn’t want to go potty,” Bunny mumbled, and Greg gently guided the kid’s stuffed friend away from his face.  “Was mad at Daddy.”
Papa took a moment before answering, and, by the time he spoke, Mycroft had stepped closer to join them next to Sherlock, who was still seated at the table.
After all, the boy had done exceedingly well with potty training up to that point.  Greg had been a bit surprised, if he were honest.  Given that John had suggested potty training in order to diminish the guilt he felt over accidents and given the way Mycroft had surmised that potty training would be the opportunity John needed to explore more of the comfort--and, at times, arousal--he received from wetting, Greg had been expecting lots of wet pants and soaked pull-ups.  It seemed, however, that the boy was basking in the praise he’d been receiving from potty training success, happy and confident in the stickers on his chart.  Greg just had to hope that desire for success and praise would get them through the night.
He found his kid in the farthest aisle of the toy section, surrounded by super hero action figures and plastic army men, toys Bunny generally steered far clear of.
Sherlock tensed his hold, squeezing John’s groin with a strong, sure grasp, and and now John was tilting his head back and shifting his hips again, desperate for release in more ways than one.
“And you believe little boys should be allowed to use the word ‘hell’ when talking to their guardians?”
Greg wrestled his nephews off of him by finding a few well-placed ticklish spots, then stood with a smirk, holding his hands out to either side of him as they tried to approach once more.
“Lastly, your Papa and your brother are very much looking forward to seeing you when we get to London, and anything that happened between you and John can be worked out with just a little bit of conversation and understanding.”  Mycroft ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.  “As for me, I believe you made some naughty choices this morning, but I do not think you are a bad boy.  You are a good boy who made some poor decisions.  Do you understand?”
"Yes, sweetheart," he said.  "You know it's against the rules to use your fists instead of your words."
John had been careful to pay attention to his body throughout the evening, knowing that Mycroft had dressed him in big boy panties even though he had wet himself without realizing it earlier in the day.  He had been starting to feel less nervous about the accident because he’d made it to the loo whenever he needed it that night, and his undies were still dry.  He didn't need pull-ups.  John had worn a pull-up to bed the night Uncle Greg babysat, and it had made him feel safe then, but he was glad Mycroft had not asked him to wear one that first night at the lake house.  He needed to be a big boy.
John was standing in the doorway of the master bedroom, peeking around the opened door.  Mycroft paused his pacing and turned to face him, quickly assessing that the conversation must have been successful; John was far more at ease than he had been last Mycroft had left him.
Sherlock settled almost the moment he was in Greg’s arms.  Distress still played around the corners of his eyes, but he was, miraculously, no longer in danger of tears.  Greg took the pacifier from the boy’s hand and, after Sherlock made his way through a rather gaping yawn, offered it to the boy, who took it into his mouth eagerly.
“If you’re referring to your newfound attachment to my older brother,” Sherlock said, alluding to Mycroft’s new status as John’s Daddy without expressly using the words,  “I think it’s about time someone else gets the bulk of his overbearing coddling for once.”
“I cried and complained and yelled at you and then I...I went to the loo in my pants like a baby and you had to clean me up.  I'm supposed to be a big boy and be brave like a Gryffindor.”
He held the brand new pacifier to Sherlock’s lips, knowing the man needed the comfort, and was relieved when Sherlock accepted it without complaint and then wandered over to lean against his brother.
Bunny stumbled and was pressed against a column in the center of the attic.  Sherlock yanked the rope he had been using to keep his pants up from the belt loops of his trousers, pressing Bunny up against the column with his elbow.  Bunny was pushing at Sherlock’s arm, trying to get him to stop hurting his collarbone, and before he understood what was happening, Sherlock had tied his hands together behind the column, the rope digging into his wrists.
When Mycroft woke up, it was to a brightening bedroom and a bed full of his boys.  John was asleep pressed against his side, Sherlock’s pirate pacifier still somehow in his mouth despite John’s slack-jawed, deep sleep.  Mycroft shifted carefully so as not to disturb the boy.  When he sat up in bed and turned to pull John’s pajama shirt down from where it had ridden up to expose his belly, he found wide eyes from his other little boy turned to glance at him from behind dark curly hair.
When Sherlock glanced up at his brother, Mycroft looked pained, as if Sherlock’s question had confirmed fears had had been harboring about Sherlock’s uneasiness.  But he quickly recovered, taking Sherlock’s bandaged hand in his own.
“Go look after our fake little Bunny upstairs,” Mycroft told Greg.  “Treat him as you would were he at his youngest.  I'll handle the pirate.”
“‘Kay, Uncle Greg,” Bunny said, climbing out of bed and trailing his stuffed lion behind him by the paw as he walked out of the bedroom and into the hallway.
Mycroft shared a look of surprised amusement with Greg.  Making the boy clean up John’s urine was an interesting choice, but one that would have certainly instilled in the boy a sense of his own responsibility for the events of the afternoon.  Not to mention, it would have given Greg an easier excuse to get Sherlock to agree to a bath.  Mycroft hadn’t been giving Greg enough credit; the man had certainly held his own with Sherlock.
, Mycroft corrected himself--could not be honest and upfront about her emotions.  Mycroft had been close-minded and short-sighted, and he hated that his bigotry had caused his kid stress.
“There is one more thing about this past weekend we haven’t properly discussed,” he said, and John turned to face him, attempting to think through what he may have missed.
Greg ran a hand down the length of his face.  He could not help but feel as if they'd somehow let the man down.  It has been Greg’s suggestion that he take Bunny to Baker Street.  He had been hoping the separation would allow John the space and time to explore the new, feminine side of Bunny without asking the lad to compromise on self-expression while Mycroft worked out the best plan for telling Sherlock.
“I think so,” Bunny said, nodding.  She could not help but let her thumb slip into her mouth, feeling a bit younger and more unsure than she had a moment before.
“I appreciate that you regret your actions,” he said.  “But I think we need to ensure that a bit more definitively.”
Greg turned on the faucet for the boy, who began rinsing off his toothbrush, and nodded, smiling, as he helped Sherlock lean over the sink in order to spit out his own mouthful of toothpaste.
He could hear muffled voices through the doorway, and then John’s voice called to Sherlock from the hallway.
"Mycroft said he was okay with it, that we didn't need to discuss unless I wanted to.  But he said we needed to be careful to tell you at the right time."
“Can you tell me what happened today between you and Anderson, kiddo?” Greg asked, voice gentle as he rested his elbows on his knees to lean forward.
John emerged from the bedroom down the hall, dressed in jeans and a button-up, nodding that he was set to go.  Greg fought against the urge to ask if the man needed the loo before they left, willing himself out of caretaker mode.  The man wasn’t actually toilet training.  But John was quiet as they made their way to the car, bordering on distracted; Greg hoped he hadn’t made a mistake by allowing the man to tag along.
Mycroft didn’t need to say any more.  Even the insinuation that he may have cause to take the night off seemed to aggravate Sherlock, who stood from the kitchen table and retreated to the living room, where he threw himself down on the couch, all the while typing and switching between websites.
Mycroft paused.  He couldn’t very well put an end to potty training when the entire weekend had been planned for experimentation with it per Bunny’s request.  Yes, Sherlock had admitted he found potty training to be difficult, but Mycroft should have known the boy wouldn’t give it up simply because it caused him distress.  There was competition to worry about, and his status as older brother.
“We’ll see, little one,” Greg said as he doled out toothpaste to first Bunny and then Sherlock’s toothbrush.  “Clean your teeth.”
“Of course you’re not,” Mycroft said, knowing he would need to speak to Sherlock about teasing his brother.  “You’re my big, kind boy.  And you know what?”
five years old.  Sometimes there are voices in your mind that tell you you shouldn’t be five years old.”
“Not off of the floor, kiddo,” he said.  “Let’s wait until we get home so we can get you a clean one of those, alright?”
Thanks as always for your kind words!  You're all so sweet and I'm glad you're enjoying reading as much as I love writing about little Sherlock and little Bunny.  Let me know what you'd like to see while the boys are at the lake house!
Greg leaned toward Mycroft to kiss his boyfriend, then settled on his side of the couch, leaning against his chest as Mycroft wrapped an arm around him
“It can be scary when someone is taking care of you in a new way, huh?  But we can pretend it’s just like when I take care of you and Sherlock whenever Mycroft is called away.  And that’s pretty normal, right?”
Sherlock whined to block out the sound of Mycroft’s voice, feeling the push of his indignation against the pull of his neediness.
“Bunny yelled and I woke up too fast,” Sherlock sniffled, knuckling at an eye.  “Papa helped but I wanted you.”
John froze.  Until this moment he had been little more than an observer to little Sherlock.  Now, he was being asked to enter into the arrangement.  He must have hesitated long enough for Mycroft to guess his insecurity.  The man emerged from Sherlock’s room after John heard him assuring the boy he would return in just a moment.  He moved to close the bedroom door, but Sherlock nearly screamed, so he left it propped open and spoke softly when he found John standing in the kitchen, holding Sherlock’s stuffed toy and obviously contemplating whether or not to bring it into the boy.
“Okay, no problem.  Let me get your suitcase, and we’ll head inside to the loo so you can finish up, okay?”
Bunny nodded, and Mycroft gathered up the wet sheets as he supervised Bunny in the task of picking out some new clothes.
It's a Christmas miracle!  I'm back with a short and sweet chapter that is the beginning of the end for this story.
“I need to talk with John about this,” he said.  “I need to be sure letting him explore this desire is in his best interest.”
He turned to let John be, but before he had made it down a step, he heard John call to him from behind the closed bathroom door.
“Itchy, Papa,” Bunny said, wiping at his runny nose above the pacifier and looking as exhausted as Greg felt.  “Yucky.”
He let the mobile fall, then sank to the floor between his bed and his desk.  He couldn’t explain it anymore, couldn’t talk to Papa without breaking down, couldn't handle the shifting headspaces between angry and sad and middle and teenager and little.
The only warning is that this was written fairly quickly and hasn't been edited, and is probably a little shmaltzy.
John was unconvinced, certain Sherlock had an issue with John’s newfound expressions of what was coded as feminine behavior.
Sherlock shifted to the edge of his chair in order to rest his head against Mycroft’s extended forearm.  He was desperate for his brother’s affection after rejecting it for the entire morning, desperate to return to the solid, reliable love of big brother.
Sherlock nodded, pushing himself from the table he had been picking at with his fingernail and moving towards the hall closet.  By the time John joined him in the living room, he’d pushed his armchair back against the wall and was lying on his stomach in front of the fireplace, puzzle pieces strewn before him.
John could feel the piss soaking into the sleeve of his sweater, and, not long after, soaking into the rear of his jeans as liquid poured beneath Sherlock onto the seat, no longer able to be contained by the fabric of his own trousers.  John realized for the first time that Sherlock had taken off his coat when he switched seats, that it was draped over the bench seat across from there.  In retrospect, if John hadn’t been quite so drunk, he may have realized what Sherlock was planning.
"I think the likelihood of that is fairly high, kiddo," Mycroft said, smiling at Sherlock as he glanced at him through the rear-view mirror.
Sherlock grimaced and squirmed despite the fact that Mycroft’s grip almost immediately turned to something soft and gentle.
But the laundry was piling up and Sherlock, at times, could not keep from wetting on the furniture, some of which was quite difficult to clean.  It was John who had suggested training pants.  He had noticed Sherlock’s piqued interest one afternoon when they were watching telly and an advertisement for pull-ups appeared on the screen.  John thought they might be just enough to feed Sherlock’s desire for humiliation which would keep him locked into headspace when he needed the help while still saving them from too many clean-up jobs.  They knew toddler training pull-ups would be too small for Sherlock.  The bedwetter pants were a good compromise; a big-kid version of training pants that would just fit Sherlock’s skinny hips.
“Sherlock, I'll be with you as soon as possible,” Mycroft was saying.  "Right now, I need you to be a big boy while I’m working."
He left Sherlock to play and set about washing the breakfast dishes Greg and John had left in their haste to get to the crime scene, stepping back into the living room every few moments to keep tabs on Sherlock.  He wiped down the counters and the stovetop before moving onto the floors.  It was rare that he had a moment to clean up in the midst of ageplaying; often there was simply not a quiet enough moment to tidy the place to the state Mycroft found most comfortable.
Sherlock huffed and threw the blankets off of himself, taking the opportunity to kick Mycroft once more while disguising the action as a desire to kick away the errant sheets.  He had stripped himself earlier of his pajama top, and so lay bare-chested before his older brother.
Mycroft was forced to regain his footing, nearly knocked over by Bunny’s shifting weight.  He turned away from the wet bed and took the boy out of the room.
And with that, the detective gasped and turned his eyes down to his thighs, where a stream of urine was quickly darkening his trousers, pulsing down his thighs.   He whimpered, one hand squeezing his crotch in a futile attempt at stopping the flow.  But it was too late; his eyes closed and cheeks reddened in shame as Sherlock braced himself against the wall and wet his pants.  His clothing was dark, but the warm flood pushed through his underwear and into his jeans, and the spread of urine puddling on the floor would be hard to miss.  John watched, eyes wide, as Sherlock--holding back his coat to keep it from getting soiled--stood helplessly, peeing in his pants.  The urine splattered against the hardwood floor.
The boy sat to pee, and Greg took the opportunity to strip him of his wet clothing, taking them to the sink to rinse.  He would hang the clothes in the guest room to dry and keep from having to ask his brother about a load of laundry, which he knew John would never allow him to do for fear of being found out.
Thank you all for your kudos and comments--I apologize for getting behind in responding to them but promise to catch up.  As always, let me know if you have any ideas you'd like me to try to incorporate.  Thank you for reading and supporting.  You're all the best!
John nodded as he pulled himself out of bed, and Mycroft gathered trousers and a shirt for Sherlock, who he knew had not brought an outfit into the shower with him, before he left John to his own devices.  He dropped off the clothing in the bathroom, leaving them on the sink counter and grateful that John had implemented a no locked doors policy in the flat after Sherlock’s last drug relapse.
Papa breathed a laugh at the state of Bunny’s t-shirt, then reached to wipe at the worst spots with a wet cloth.
“You can do it, yourself,” Mycroft said to appease him, guiding Sherlock out of the corner and down the hallway, where he deposited the boy in front of the bathroom door.
Bunny tried not to show them that he was starting to cry.  He rubbed the palms of his hands against his eyes to keep the tears from falling visibly.
“John Hamish Watson, answer me please,” Mycroft called in warning, treading the line between friend and caregiver as a means to an end.
After a few moments, the two emerged and Mycroft guided Sherlock by the hand to the boy’s bedroom.  The thunder was striking more frequently, and, between the booms, John heard Mycroft’s attempts to soothe the boy.
John looked nervous, but Mycroft seemed to understand that Greg didn’t want to speak in front of their youngest, and encouraged John to follow the other man’s directions.  He set John down on his feet and ushered him away.
All in all, the boys had only been alone for an hour and a half.  Mycroft had sent Greg to the bottom of the stairs to listen in and make sure all seemed well on two separate occasions, and he had checked in with Sherlock when the boy had bounded down the stairs looking for paper and markers for his treasure map.  Every indication was that the boys were having fun playing dress up.  Greg and Mycroft had been relieved that the drama of the morning had been solved, even a bit pleased with themselves for the roles they had played in its resolution.
“Sherlock Holmes, are you purposefully trying my patience today?” he asked, tone veering towards anger.  “Don’t think I’m above putting you over my knee on the side of the road.  You’re clearly in need of some discipline.”
John could not help but blush at being spoken to like a child, but his smaller side was not far away, and it was as grateful for the praise as his adult side was embarrassed.
He could not help but feel a desperate protectiveness over the kids, and as he lifted Bunny in his arms and carried him to the kitchen to wait his turn to be sunscreened, he hoped that, even though they were all heading back to London and the regular routine of jobs and separate apartments, there would not be a long stretch of time before he had the chance to care for his boys again.  He saw how much it meant to them, and he never felt quite so content or quite so connected to Mycroft as he did when they were Papa and Daddy.
“It’s okay, I promise I’m not mad,” Greg said, knowing there was a real chance Sherlock would hang up were he to feel uncomfortable talking.  “Where’s Mycroft, sweetheart?”
“I’m sorry for not noticing, kiddo,” he said, setting Sherlock back onto the sink counter so that he could give Bunny his full attention.  He was grateful the baby was easily distracted by the plastic frog bath toy he handed him, the one closest at hand.  He placed both hands on Bunny’s shoulders and pulled the kid in for a hug.  “Thank you for telling me.”
They sat in the kitchen chair--Sherlock pressed against Mycroft’s chest and Mycroft running a hand up and down his back comfortingly--long enough that Papa and Bunny returned from their walk and began to get dinner ready, Bunny eager to be Papa’s helper.
Greg’s mum seemed to assess John for a moment before taking the dish towel from her shoulder and setting it on the dining room table.
There was a moment when the men stood blinking at each other, but then Sherlock swore, glared at Greg with an impassioned hatred, and swung the door shut, leaving Greg once again alone in the hallway.  Greg was glad Sherlock had not attempted to get past him.  They both knew who would have won the confrontation, and Greg knew he may have been forced to cause Sherlock discomfort had he been forced to restrain him.  Sherlock had apparently decided he would rather hold his ground than lose it attempting to escape.
Sherlock let tears well up in his eyes, shifting in place at the uncomfortable bulk of the wet pull-up between his legs.
Bunny nodded, less unsure of herself now that she’d had the conversation once before and was speaking with Papa, who never judged.
“Sherlock asked me to get young,” John said after a moment, eyes darting up to Mycroft and then down to the striped comforter.
“He’s wet,” he said quietly to Sherlock when Bunny was distracted by crying into his shoulder.  “When did he have an accident?”
“Are you coming home?”  John asked, shifting from foot to foot on the kitchen linoleum, wishing Greg would stop looking at him.
With a small catch of breath in the back of his throat, he allowed himself to release a trickle of urine.  He stopped himself right away, however, the shock of the dribble soaking into his briefs jarring him into a slight gasp.
“Gregory, Bunny deliberately disobeyed me,” Mycroft said, gesturing towards the bathroom with a jerk of his arm.
They sat across from each other in silence, and John began to wish he had asked Mycroft and Greg to stay.  He ran a hand along the back of his neck.  John may be attuned to emotions in a way Sherlock was not, but that didn’t mean he was prepared to discuss his propensity for calling another man “Daddy” with his boyfriend.  Especially not when that other man was his boyfriend’s older brother.
Since having heard Mycroft’s revelations about Sherlock’s wettings, John had become more attuned to his boyfriend’s needs, had even attempted to talk with Sherlock about waiting too long.  But Sherlock was always guarded, closed off, and this time was no different.  He had refused to acknowledge the accident when he returned to the kitchen in a new change of trousers to finish his experiment, refused to acknowledge that John had cleaned the urine from the chair and floor.
There was laughter in Mycroft’s voice.  “Exactly,” he said.  “Now, hun, once Uncle Greg gets you all cleaned up, he’s going to tuck you in and read you one story.  It’s past your bedtime and you need your sleep.  I’ll be there when you wake up in the morning.”
“Good to see you, little bro,” another said, wrapping him in a one-armed hug while balancing a wide-eyed toddler on his hip.
“I was wrong,” Mycroft said, standing to step closer to John.  “I’ve been holding onto asinine misconceptions and rationalizing them by insisting this was an unhealthy interest on your part.  But this has always had more to do with myself and my own qualms than it has with you, and for that I’m sorry.”
Besides, Mycroft could see that something more than a head cold was bothering Bunny, and if he could find a moment to talk with the boy without distractions, maybe he could get to the bottom of whatever was on the kid’s mind.
“You’re mean! I’m the biggest!” Sherlock called, but he sniffled and sat on the stool facing the wall, mumbling that he was a big boy who didn’t have accidents.  Lestrade caught Mycroft’s raised eyebrow and smirked at the boy’s blatant lie.
Mycroft sighed and paused in the routine of running his fingers through his brother’s hair.  His hand rested against the back of the boy’s head, and he skirted it around to cup Sherlock’s cheek, guiding his brother to look up at him.
“Yeah,” Sherlock smiled, thinking of all the times Uncle Greg had put him to bed or helped him after a nightmare or played pirates with him.  Mycroft wasn't his Daddy, exactly, but Uncle Greg could be his Papa!  “Can Uncle Greg be Papa, Mycroft?”
Greg clucked his tongue and rubbed his hand along Bunny’s back as he hugged the boy to his chest.  He whispered assurances into his ear, telling him he understood and that he wasn’t in trouble and that the car seat would clean up just fine.  He began rocking the boy once more, hoping to keep him from more tears.  Eventually, the boy was quiet and sleepy on his shoulder.
“Scaredy-cat,” Sherlock namecalled, but he did not shift away when Bunny leaned up against him or try to pretend he hadn’t been scared, too, when the next clap of thunder caused them both to gasp.
There had been a bit of hostility in Bunny’s countenance throughout the morning, from as early as his tantrum at the breakfast table.  Mycroft has never cared for John while he was sick, but if he was always so moody while ill, he hoped for his own sake that the boy’s cold would leave his system sooner rather than later.  At least Sherlock had allowed himself to age down; Mycroft wasn’t sure he’d be able to deal with the attitudes of both boys at once.
He instructed the boy to take off his pants and wet pull-up while he retrieved some wipes from the bathroom, and after a quick clean-up and a few more words of encouragement, Mycroft had the boy over his knee.
Sherlock huffed, then pushed his stuffed alligator between his legs.  He always had to wee badly when he woke up, and he knew he should get out of bed and use the potty like a big boy.  But gyrating on the plush toy and the bulk of his already-wet diaper made his tummy feel fluttery in a good way, and he wasn’t exactly in the mood to behave like a cooperating, easy kid that morning.
He sank onto the end of the bed, head in hands.  The nightmare had jolted him into his hyper-aware adult self, but the smaller side of his mind was not far off, and his smaller side was desperate for Papa.
Mycroft was never there when he wanted him.  Even when John was away with Papa and Sherlock should have had Mycroft all to himself, Mycroft had people to deal with who were more important than him.  It wasn’t fair, and the resentment he felt--the desire to prove to his big brother he didn't need him, anyway--had him aging up to his teenaged persona, sullen and moody.
“Bunny?” Sherlock mumbled, somehow making strong on his promise to watch over his little brother despite his sleepiness.
“I don’t want to be anywhere other than right here, bud,” Greg said.  “Besides, it helps me relax, too.”
Sherlock placed John’s hand on his thigh, just below the crotch of his trousers, and John could not help but blush as he glanced down to see that Sherlock was aroused.  He attempted to pull his hand away from where Sherlock was pressing it down against his leg, but Sherlock would not let him free.  This went far beyond the usual public displays of affection.
“Why don’t you tell me what you want to say to her, and I’ll pass along the message, okay?” John asked.
Bunny had begun to use the backs of his hands to wipe at his own wet eyes, squirming away from the wash cloth, and he nodded.
But John didn’t have the words to explain that it had all been too much over the past few days, that he still hadn’t had time to process his thoughts from the weekend, that the contrast between the weekend at the lake and being little for so many hours on end and being adult and chasing murderers with Sherlock was too great.  He couldn’t tell Mycroft he’d been fighting to stay fully grown, that he just wanted to cuddle and suck on his pacifier but his adult mind had told him he’d had plenty of that over the weekend and he needed to be big.  He couldn’t put into words the way his relationship with Sherlock felt different, now, that there were unspoken questions and concerns neither of them had found a way to bring up.
He was restless, desperate for the time he could be excused upstairs and closed in the safety of his old room.
In the front seats, Mycroft and Greg were involved in a conversation about the schedule for the next few days, and when John chanced a glance at Sherlock, worried his boyfriend may catch on to what he was planning to do, he found Sherlock still firmly aged down, happily absorbed in his video games and mumbling to himself as he played.
"There we go," she said, pulling the blanket up to rest beneath his chin.  "No need for tears, right?"
Sherlock’s pulse quickened.  He hadn’t expected such a direct question, and his cheeks burned in embarrassment for what felt the hundredth time that day.  Why couldn’t Papa just leave him alone?  On impulse, Sherlock sat up and, lashing out, slapped his hands against the table.  Anger, for Sherlock, had always been the easiest way to keep away the tears, so he forced himself to find a bit of his teenaged persona--his most guarded headspace--in order to add venom to his voice.
“It’s settled then,” Uncle Greg said with a smile as he lifted John into his arms.  “Let’s go get you dressed for the day.”  Bunny accepted the cuddle, burrowing his face against Greg’s neck as he was lifted from the chair.
“Ironically enough,” Sherlock continued, seemingly unaware of John’s amused staring, “the items you were drawn to in childhood were those that Harry herself rejected as she struggled with her own questions of sexuality.  Your predilection likely stemmed from an unconscious belief that your sister’s life was easier than your own and a subconscious desire to therefore claim for yourself all that Harry was given as the female, and youngest child, of the family.  But there’s an interesting point to be made given Harry's sexuality and the dichotomy between---”
“I apologize it had to be brought to light,” he said, standing from the kitchen table.  “But it couldn’t be helped, unfortunately.”
Greg scoffed, broke off another bit of biscuit which he popped into his mouth, then brushed the crumbs from his hands.
Greg’s mom immediately reached to cup the back of John’s head before pulling it down onto her shoulder to swallow him in a hug.  John stiffened in the familiarity of it all, still rather overwhelmed by the day’s turn of events.
“Need you, My,” Sherlock said, feeling a bit vulnerable as his brother failed to drop his professional demeanor.
“You know he’s never been one for easy transitions into headspace,” Mycroft said, one hand absently running through the hair at the back of Bunny’s head as their youngest dozed against his chest and suckled rhythmically on his pacifier.  “He’ll be okay after some time alone.”
“---Sherlock,” John said as he broke into a smile, feeling affection for the man despite needing Sherlock to stop, knowing the man would continue delving further into John’s past and psychological hang-ups if he were not forced to pause his train of thought.  “Sherlock, that’s enough.”
“I’ll be fine,” he said, opening the car door and removing himself from the passenger seat before Greg could pry for further information.
London tube system?” John asked, recognizing two empty boxes and a pile of mixed puzzle pieces on the carpet.
It was perhaps for the very reason that John rarely thought of his father that the recent persistence of the man’s memory was unsettling him.  Mycroft had said it before: ageplay had the potential to bring back memories you’d rather forget.  But John’s memories of his father had come while John was adult, and were persisting in his aged up mindset, calling back memories of his father’s diffidence and brusqueness, his expectations and often gruff treatment.  He was suddenly ashamed to think of what his father would think should he find out his son was ageplaying, the man's reach extending far beyond the physical role he'd played in John's life.
And then, voice no-nonsense once more in order to provide the boy with the structure he so desperately needed: “Alright, into the corner to think about what you’ve done.”
John could not help but chuckle at the boy’s tendency to view Bunny as an entirely separate entity from his adult self.  If he’d ever had doubts that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to separate their ageplay life from their everyday lives, they had long since been put to rest.
His brother’s eyebrows knitted together for a moment before he sat back in his chair and raised them once more, a silent command for Greg to continue.
“Uncle Greg put me in time out for a really long time, Mycroft,” Sherlock explained as Mycroft led him out of the bathroom by the shoulders.  “But he said if I was really sorry maybe I wouldn’t get a spanking but that wasn’t his decision; it was yours.  So, am I gonna get a spanking, My?”
“I was only joking, princess,” Greg explained, turning the key in the ignition.  “I promise no one’s opening any presents until we’re all together.”
“I, ah,” John seemed to realize just how he must look and yanked the sheets to cover his half-dressed state.  “I’m alright, now, Mycroft.  I’m sorry I asked you to come.”
He slipped away when everyone was distracted by the suggestion that all the kids take pictures with their new toys from grandma and grandpa, something that seemed to be a Christmas Eve tradition.  He found himself back in the now-empty dining room, collapsing back into the chair he had perched in with a fake smile as he'd suffered through dinner.  He pulled his knees to his chest and pressed his face against them, struggling to hold back tears.  He didn’t want to be there, anymore.  He felt little, and he wanted Papa to come and bundle him up and take him away.
“Can we open presents, now?” Sherlock asked when the musical number ended, turning over his shoulder to sigh at Mycroft and Greg.  He’d been asking since they’d arrived to find a stack of brightly-wrapped gifts Greg had left for the boys under the tree, impatient and tetchy as only young Sherlock could be.
Bunny nodded and skipped towards the fridge, where the stickers were held to the stainless steel surface with a variety of colorful magnets.  On the fridge, Sherlock could see what he hadn’t noticed before: Bunny’s chart already held a mermaid sticker in its first box.  Bunny must have used the loo that morning, maybe around the same time Sherlock had peed in his pants.  The thought sent Sherlock’s cheeks blazing, and he buried his face once more into his arms crossed on the table.

John had blinked awake in the seat beside Sherlock as soon as the tantrum began.  He was now staring wide-eyed at Sherlock, pacifier bobbing up and down in his mouth as he sucked nervously, his lion clutched to his chest.
“I know you’re not.  I’ll speak to him,” Mycroft said.  “And everything you’ve said sounds more than doable.  Thank you for explaining to me.  I want you to be happy, John.”
The doorbell buzzed during the final song of the movie, and Greg gestured for Mycroft to stay put as he left the living room couch and went to collect the take-away.
Mycroft managed to get his boys through the next hour or so without any additional incident.  Sherlock was giddy with excitement over watching the dinosaurs, his younger headspace allowing him to show true emotion where he was usually reserved.  Bunny was quiet and distracted, which Mycroft assumed was a combination of not feeling well and being overtired from the events of the morning.
It's been far too long and you've all been very, very patient--I apologize for the delay and thank you all for your kind comments from the last chapter (and for whispered for checking in on me--you're so sweet)!  This chapter has given me a ton of trouble and I've been working a lot on some other projects which have taken up a lot of my free time, but I finally got around to updating!
“You think, or you know?” he asked, raising an eyebrows as he glanced down at the boy’s upturned face.
“Your Daddy and Papa have known for a while now that you may want to be a girl,” Papa continued, still rubbing Bunny’s knee.  “We’re very glad you felt comfortable enough to finally tell us that today.  But this is a big change, and now your Daddy has to find the right way to explain that big change to Sherlock.  He needs to make sure Sherlock knows what good news this is for all of us.”
And then Daddy was standing up from the couch and walking out of the dark, wood-panelled living room.  He began pacing back and forth in the hallway, back straight and head tilted towards the ceiling.  It was clear Daddy was frustrated.  Bunny knew that he had been giving them a bit of leniency because they were sick, but that he was not going to stand for an entire day of the type of carrying-on Bunny and Sherlock had been participating in to that point.
Mycroft generally had little trouble carrying John if the kid was awake enough to hold on tight and wrap their arms around Mycroft’s waist, but Greg knew that Mycroft would currently have a bit of trouble given Bunny’s sleepy, relaxed state.  Hell, Greg was even having trouble maneuvering Sherlock at the moment.
“You’re not as aged up as you’d like to believe right now, Sherlock,” Greg said from the front seat.  “And even if you were currently adult, your behavior is unacceptable.”
“Tell your brother,” Mycroft said, and Sherlock turned back towards Bunny and Papa Greg.  Bunny had stopped crying, and was blinking up at Sherlock, trying to understand.
“All that matters is that he agreed not to take things any further,” Greg said.  “Thankfully, he won’t press charges.”
Mycroft checked his phone once more.  He knew Greg and John were not attempting to be intentionally vague; holidays were inherently busy, with little time to get away and communicate with those outside the immediate circumstances.  Even so, as much as he’d deny it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep until he knew his boyfriend and his kids were all okay.
Bunny was pliable in the warm water as Mycroft maneuvered his body, his pacifier ever in his mouth until Mycroft coaxed it out to properly wash the boy’s tear-stained face.  When Bunny’s eyes lingered behind his shoulder, Mycroft turned to realize Sherlock was still just outside the doorway, shifting his weight from foot to foot.
“That’s enough, buddy,” Uncle Greg said, but he was laughing, and Bunny knew he wasn’t mad when he pulled Sherlock close to him in a hug.  Sherlock only squirmed away to get more comfortable, as it was tight quarters to fit four in the bed.  Bunny felt safe and calm pressed between his Daddy and his big brother.
“Let’s save your new nightgown for bedtime, huh, Bunny?” Uncle Greg asked, coming up behind him to place a hand on his shoulder.
Mycroft nodded, then guided Sherlock to rearrange himself so he could look him in the eye.  Sherlock shifted until he was straddling Mycroft’s lap, his back leaning against the edge of the kitchen table.  He peeked up at Mycroft through watery eyes and was relieved to see his brother looking at him not with disappointment for Sherlock’s admission of selfishness, but with something more resembling care and compassion.
Hi lovelies--It's been a rough few days, so I needed some cuteness!  Hope this chapter will bring some comfort to those of you also dealing with negativity.  We'll be okay! xoxox
“Yes, Lock?” he asked, and, this time, Mycroft did not comment on the thumb which had made its way into the boy’s mouth
“Oh, my little Bunny,” Mycroft whispered into John’s hair, cheek resting against John’s head.  “If it’s all too much that’s okay.  There’s a spare cot in the closet we can make up and put in Sherlock’s room, just in case.   But Uncle Greg and I think this would be a good idea, just to try.”
“Come on,” Sherlock said, and John stood from the bed as he took hold of the hand Sherlock was holding out to him.
They found John and Sherlock asleep in Sherlock’s bed.  Sherlock’s head was on John’s shoulder and John’s thumb was tucked into his mouth.  Although they certainly both looked young at the moment, it was likely only Sherlock had been young when they’d gone to bed: while Sherlock was dressed in a ragged pair of dinosaur pajamas--a too-small pair that were some of the first items of clothing Mycroft had purchased when he’d begun ageplay with a barely nineteen-year-old Sherlock--John was still dressed in his jeans and sweater.
Mycroft stood, scooping up Bunny, and turned to Sherlock, who had been hovering just beyond the end of the bed.
Sherlock whined, but the warning glances from both his brother and John had him second guess his decision to throw a fit, and he skulked to the bathroom.  It was clear the man was too exhausted to strop once more, and Mycroft felt a bit guilty that he would have a pliant, cooperative version of Sherlock to care for that afternoon after John’s tiring ordeal of a morning.
“See? Asleep before bedtime,” Greg teased when the kids were breathing gently.  “Just what you wanted.”
Sherlock knew he was working himself up into a right state.  He was having a hard time catching his breath, and he was getting precariously close to wailing.  He cried into his hands, not registering the words Mycroft was saying until he felt himself pulled into his big brother’s lap and could settle into the man’s arms when they wrapped tight around him.  He realized after a moment that Mycroft had stopped talking, that he was simply rocking him back and forth.  And that he was humming.
As dusk settled and the novelty of the games wore off, the darkness in his mind began to make itself known once more.  He was cranky at the dinner table, where he cried because Bunny got the purple fork and Sherlock wanted purple too, not the orange one, and he kicked while Uncle Greg tried to clean his face of spaghetti sauce.  But, through it all, he could sense the darkness had begun to recede, could feel his mind clearer of the type of overwhelming sadness than it had been that morning.  There was no telling how long the dark days would last--at times, they stayed for weeks--but Sherlock may have just gotten lucky this time, and may be feeling better by morning.
John nodded, trying to blink back tears but only succeeding in causing them to spill over onto his cheeks.  He’d been wrestling with memories of his father since the aftereffects of his nightmare the night before.  Why did they have to stumble upon a crime scene that reminded him of all those years ago?  He’d left those nights in stifling motel rooms smelling of fast food and cigarette smoke far behind him; he thought he’d put them to rest once and for all once his father had been buried.  Harry had shown up drunk to the funeral, which John had almost been able to acknowledge as some sort of tribute.  The memories were supposed to have stayed in the past.
Among the mass of guests, Greg was been cheerful and light-hearted, clearly warmed by so many reunions with those he loved and who loved him.  Alone with John, he remained bright-eyed, but his tone had become serious.
John kicked the heavy pull-up off of his ankles and let it slip over his feet until it rested on the floor.  He could see where it was swollen and yellow from his accident.
“Then that’s what we’ll do, Bun,” Mycroft said.  “We’ll need to keep you in pull-ups all the time, then.  Is that what you want?”
“Now, Sherlock,” Mycroft said.  “Unless you’d like me to call your Papa and tell him how you’ve behaved today?”
“Let’s get your teeth cleaned, kiddo,” Greg said, reaching down to lift Sherlock from Mycroft in an attempt to give the man a bit of a break.
“Roll over on your tummy and I’ll rub your back a bit,”  Mycroft said when John was settled back into bed.
Had Sherlock come home having wet his pants in public, he would have been punished severely--time-out and a stern talking to, relegated to pull-ups for the rest of the day and possibly even spanked.  John had received none of that.  He had been comforted and changed into fresh Harry Potter underwear after his bath, had been given hugs and been allowed to pick the movie they watched.
The kid was too cheeky for his own good, and Mycroft cast him a warning glance reminding him to keep his sass in check.  He sighed; he’d known Greg was prepared to spoil the kids with every Christmas treat imaginable if it meant they were happy for Christmas night, but there had to be rules drawn somewhere.
They had been drinking whiskey after putting the boys to sleep, processing the events of the day and planning for the next.  Mycroft’s exhaustion from his lack of sleep the night before as well as the alcohol had made him a bit cheeky, which had led him to tease Greg good-naturedly when Greg admitted he had suffered his own bedwetting problems as a child.  Eventually, however, Greg had gotten Mycroft to focus back on the topic of conversation at hand.
John protested a bit, struggling between his adult self and child self, but when Mycroft ran a hand across John’s back, the man settled, and Mycroft could see that although he hadn’t yet, he was close to slipping down in age.
“Are there monsters in the lake?” he whispered, glancing up with genuine curiosity and a bit of fear.
As Daddy turned the telly back on, Bunny traced the outline of Ariel on his Little Mermaid nightshirt and ducked beneath the blanket settled over him to check on his ladybug underwear.  They made him feel safe.  He leaned his head against Daddy’s arm and closed his eyes, making up stories in his mind about the ponies he had seen on the telly, with lots of glitter and rainbows and ribbons.
Wow, was this a difficult one to write.  I'm not sure why I had such trouble with the narrative here, but it's the reason it took me so long before updating--I had to leave it alone and come back to it numerous times before I even felt like I was marginally getting across what I was hoping to.  Hopefully the flow is okay, and, if not, we'll chalk it up to my busy week and try for something better in the next chapter :)
Another update for all of you lovelies! Your comments make me smile so much and I'm so glad you're enjoying the story.
“Sherlock, you call John ‘baby’ because it’s too hard to call him his grown-up name and stay little?"
He pushed his baby blanket off of the mattress, not wanting to be close to the girly bunnies, and buried his face into his plush lion.  But when he remembered she was named Ariel, he pushed her off the bed in disgust, letting her fall to the floor beside his baby blanket.  He curled up against the pillow, and could not help but let his thumb slip into his mouth, wanting his Daddy and his Uncle Greg and, despite the blush it brought to his cheeks and the tears it brought to his eyes, his new nightgown.
Mycroft did what he could to keep his body relaxed despite the worry the question brought.  There were calculations going through his mind all at once, potential stories he could attempt to weave and the likelihood of Sherlock's accepting them.  But even Mycroft Holmes had had enough of hidden information and false statements for the day; hopefully, a little bit of truth would do more good than harm.  As far as Mycroft could sense, the long-believed story that Redbeard was a dog had not been shaken by the morning’s discussion.
Sherlock rolled over and forced himself to stand with another groan.  He knew John was right, that it was best that they compared information and formed a game plan before being forced to have a conversation with Mycroft and Greg.  But that didn’t make it any easier to leave John’s bed and the comfort of their private life.
Greg smiled, releasing tension in his shoulders he didn’t realize he’d been holding.  His brother stood and, yanking Greg from his chair, wrapped him in a hug.
“--John,” Mycroft said, holding a hand up to stop the man from speaking further.  “There’s no need to discuss unless you’d like to.  I told you last night: you don’t need to be little to accept comfort.”
“Only because you’d slipped those comic books into my duffel bag,” he said.  “Before I found them no one had said more than two words to me.”
He balled up the sheets and carried them to the hallway bathroom, where he placed them into the washing machine and began the wash cycle.
It was one of Mycroft’s old rules, one of the rules he had passed down to John, who was now the main enforcer of the routine of Sherlock’s little life.  They had settled into a comfortable arrangement.  Sherlock spent most of his time as an adult, but he was a bit more open with John about when he needed little time.
“We need to talk about what happened at the store, sweetheart,” Mycroft said when the boy did not say anything further.
“Exactly, sweet boy,” he said.  “You can act however you’d like.  You know your Daddy and I love you and your brother Sherlock loves you, and that’s all that matters.  But, when we’re around other people, there’s the danger of them watching and judging.  Do you understand?”
Now the entire ordeal was in danger of being brought to light, and Mycroft was unsure Sherlock was prepared to go through the stress of it all a second time.
“It’s not time for playing,” he explained as he stripped the boy of his pajama shirt and then helped him step out of his sopping wet trousers and cartoon underwear.  The boy’s skin was warm to the touch.
Mycroft smiled at the Bunny and signaled for him to close his eyes and tip back his head so he could rinse his hair.  He let Bunny squeeze a bit of shampoo into the palm of Mycroft’s hand before he spoke.
Thanks for your kind words and support, loves!  I'm so pleased to see that you enjoyed the first chapter, and it's great to be back writing for all of you again.  Thanks also for those of you who sent in requests--it's always fun to be able to incorporate new ideas and perspectives, so keep them coming!
“Nothing,” Bunny said, the words only coming with effort because he felt exposed and trapped and emotionally vulnerable.  “Was big.”
It was strange to be in the space where Greg and his brothers had been children, where they’d raced and practiced footie and played at firefighters.  There was a wooded area about ten meters from the back porch, and John trekked through the rising snow, somehow knowing Greg would have gone exploring in the woods as a child and wanting to see all that had made Greg his caring, self-assured, quick-to-laugh self.
In the past, John had spoken to Mycroft with only uncertainty and confusion about wetting, but both Greg and Mycroft had begun to sense that John’s feelings were becoming a bit clearer to him over the course of their time at the lake house.  Both Greg and Mycroft sensed that the boy wanted to regress a bit in the way of his toileting habits.  That said, they had decided to keep an eye on Bunny for a day or two more before approaching him about his feelings towards pull-ups and his accidents, wanting to gather as much information as possible to ensure they were well informed.
There was a bit less of an edge to Sherlock’s voice, however, as if he had finally snapped out of his one-track mind solely focused on playing pirates and could actually see Bunny’s distress.  Sherlock pressed down between his own legs, as if watching Bunny wet his pull-up caused Sherlock to begin feeling desperate himself.
He had knotted the drawstring tight around his waist to keep the pull-up out of sight, but now it was giving him trouble and was far too tight to yank down over his hips.  It didn’t help that his vision was getting blurry as his eyes filled with frustrated tears.  He felt himself leak into the pull-up and gasped, yanking on the ends of the drawstrings in a desperate attempt to get the knot to budge.
“You don’t ever have to hide who you are, baby,” Papa told her, wiping her face free of the tears she had not managed to keep from spilling down her cheeks.  “Your Daddy and I want you and Sherlock to be just as happy as you can be.”
It wasn’t that Bunny hadn’t liked wetting himself.  On the contrary; he couldn’t wait to do it again.  But standing in the middle of his bedroom and wetting himself so helplessly had sunk him down in age to the point where he felt content but so, so needy.
Mycroft turned over his shoulder to catch the boy’s pleading glance, and could not help but breathe a laugh.
“Come on, Sherlock,” Mycroft said after they had stood in silence for far longer than was comfortable.  Sherlock, fully regressed once more, had begun plucking the wet fabric at his crotch.  “Let’s get you cleaned up and into some training pants.”
We've reached the final chapter of this story in the series!  Thanks so much for all of you who have stuck with me even when I've taken months and months to update--you really are amazing, every one of you!
As Papa stepped close behind Mycroft, Sherlock studied him for any clues as to whether or not he’d suspected that the stain on the carpet was not entirely attributed to juice.  There was a part of Sherlock that hoped he’d noticed, hoped that, after he chatted quietly with Mycroft--who did happen to glance up at Sherlock rather pointedly after something Papa said--he would tell everyone just how babyish and naughty Sherlock had been.  At least then the guilt and the worry would end.  But a larger part of Sherlock--the part that was still clinging to his pride--prayed he hadn't been found out, prayed he would never have to admit to what he'd done.
“Alright, lad, you’re turning into a prune.” Lestrade said after quite some time.  “Let’s wash your hair and get you nice and dry.  I’ll bet our food will be here any moment, yeah?”
Mycroft placed the boy to sit on the counter of the sink cabinet and, after wetting a washcloth, reached to wipe the tears from his face.
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter.  The Lestrades basically appeared fully-formed in my mind, so they were easy to capture for the quick moments they have the story's focus.
But Sherlock’s mind was as one-tracked as ever when he returned, and it seemed, now that he had reemerged, he was solely focused on completing the treasure map.
“Come on,” Greg said with a smirk, wrapping an arm around John’s shoulders.  “You’re too cute for your own good.”
“Okay, kiddo,” Uncle Greg said.  “Finish your breakfast, then we’ll head on upstairs and get you changed outta your jammies before we’re on our way.”
“You’re mean!” Bunny said, but he pushed the remote from the couch onto the floor and curled in on himself.
Decision made, John opened another drawer and pulled out one of Sherlock’s pull-ups, which he tucked away in the folds of his dressing gown.  He had learned the day they went to the zoo that Sherlock’s pull-ups were a bit snug on him; he was not as thin as the taller man.  But the sides were stretchy enough to fit him just fine.  They were Goodnights, John knew.  Real pull-ups would be too small for him and Sherlock.  None of the men had ever broached the topic of adult diapers around John, although he had picked up on clues that Mycroft may have used them with Sherlock in the past.
“I’m not a little boy right now, Mycroft, although no one seems to have noticed.  I’m probably seventeen at the youngest.”
“Love you, too, My,” Sherlock said, leaning forward until his forehead was once again resting on Mycroft’s chest.  “Love you always, too.”
Bunny’s eyes widened and he could not hide his happiness.  He smiled and reached for the nightgown, pulling it to his chest in a hug.
It was clear to Greg as he lifted a dripping John out of the wet backseat that the boy was having a rough morning.  Mycroft had specifically instructed Bunny to use the loo before they’d left Baker Street, and it was now clear that their usually compliant child had deliberately disobeyed his Daddy’s request.  It was out of character for their sweet Bunny who generally felt too much guilt to break the rules, and Greg wanted nothing more than to clean him up, give him some love, and see what was bothering him.
“Ariel,” he said, and Greg, seeing the sheer joy and comfort the item brought to the boy, vowed to stop entertaining Mycroft’s hesitancy to encourage Bunny’s love for traditionally little-girl things.
“I don’t need it, My,” he said, still clinging to the door handle.  “I’ll be in the water the whole time.  The sun won’t get me.”
Warm wetness pulsed into his clothing and the couch cushion until all he could feel was wet fabric against the skin of his legs and bum. It was exhilarating, peeing himself on the couch, but it was also terrifying.  He sniffled and blinked up at Greg when he felt himself able to stop.  He felt so young and so vulnerable.  He felt excited.
“Good boy,” Greg smiled when the boy gazed up at him with pride over the dry pull-up, seemingly just realizing he had not wet it during the night.
Mycroft sighed.  Perhaps Greg was right.  Perhaps he was letting his own hang-ups pepper his interpretation of the situation.  John had seemed genuinely pleased by the items Greg had purchased for him, proud to show them off.
Daddy turned to Bunny and then to Sherlock, as if assessing which of the two should have the chance to choose.  Bunny pouted and looked up at his Daddy with his best pleading eyes.
“I didn’t mean to!” Bunny lied as he finally finished emptying his bladder, pants and underwear absolutely sopping wet.
Sherlock was surprised when he met John’s gaze, perhaps taken aback by the interruption or the warmth in John’s tone.  But in the next moment he seemed to realize that John had received his point, that he felt Sherlock was currently putting on a bit of a needlessly detailed display.
Papa paused, as if realizing Bunny and Sherlock were blinking up at him and that he had two sets of little ears listening.
Mycroft could not help but smirk.  Greg had done the reading on ageplay that Mycroft had given to him, and it was always endearing when the man used technicality from the literature.  In regards to ageplay, Mycroft had always known he was fully caretaker and Sherlock was fully little.  But it might just be that John felt pulled in both directions, that he may enjoy switching between the two roles, even that he was currently serving in a role that was not his preferred.
It was why, when he felt a stab of need, he released his heavy bladder into the pull-up Papa had dressed him in the night before without much hesitancy at all, releasing his urine into the padding.  The warmth spread beneath and behind him, and although Sherlock still felt overheated, the warmth in the pull-up was a welcome comfort.  He sighed, moaning a bit before he realized just how content the action had made him, just how much he had needed to go, and just how young he had become in the past few minutes.
He’d been far more accommodating after a misbehavior than he normally would have been, and his already shallow well of patience was just about dried up.  So when Bunny refused to move, Mycroft was forced to lift him from the couch and physically carry him to the kitchen, where he placed the screaming boy into the timeout corner.
John rolled his eyes and stood to pull Sherlock into a hug which Sherlock stood to accept but did not reciprocate.  Sherlock was not finished making his point, and the detective began speaking the moment John released him from the hug.
Feel free to let me know what you'd like to see in the coming chapters, and have a great night, all!  Stay inside and bundled up if you're somewhere where the weather is bitterly cold right now (like me!).
But the flat was not silent.  As John shrugged off his jacket and turned to head upstairs to his bedroom, he distinctly heard the cling of a spoon in a teacup.  He paused, one foot on the staircase, and sighed.
John nodded, turning to glance towards the living room, where Sherlock lay on the couch.  It was impossible to tell whether the man was asleep or not, but John imagined Sherlock more than likely had at least one ear open to their conversation.
“You know you’re too big for thumb sucking,” Mycroft said, causing Sherlock to look effectively chagrined.  “But I know it’s been a hard day, so I’ll allow it.”
“You’ve both been running around with a bunch of zoo creatures all day.  You need a bath now and then we’ll put on something comfortable and watch a movie.  Bath now means no bath tonight before bed.”
“The man on the floor…” Bunny tried, unable to keep the tears from falling.  “They...they were laughing.”
They had been through this before: the twisted memories of the trauma John had seen on the battlefield, the suffocating nightmares.  All a part of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, his therapist had long-ago explained, the nightmares a symptom just like his anxiety and dislike of enclosed spaces.  But the nightmares generally happened while he was fully adult; they were usually kept at bay by the contented calm of his younger headspace.  It was almost worse when they happened while he was little, because they never failed to remind him of the deepest pains of his adult life, shifting him far too quickly up in age and leaving him rather unmoored.  John slipped out of headspace as he slipped away from the bloody, horrifying images.
Sherlock nodded, swirling a hand in the pile to mix the two puzzles and then setting to work separating the combined pieces by color, atomic number, or station name: periodic table to one side, tube stations to the other.  He was attempting to occupy his mind, and John wanted nothing more than to help him along.
John hung up, then dug his raw hands into the deep pockets of Greg’s jacket.  There were too many differing images to choose from--Harry drunk and crying, Harry drunk and laughing as she danced from room to room, Harry drunk and angry, casting bitter quips to anyone who attempted to calm her.  He was relieved when his phone pinged with a text message.
Mycroft placed a box of biscuits in the cabinet and took a seat at the kitchen table, where he opened the newspaper and began to read.  He watched Sherlock over the top of the paper as the boy began to calm himself, continuing to hitch on softer cries and little whines until he was doing nothing more than breathing heavily.
“What if maybe I’m a girl today?” Bunny asked as all once after they had sat in silence for quite some time.  The boy blurted out the words all at once, as if there was only a limited space within which he could say them.
“Please, My,” he said, cheeks reddening at the necessity of saying it aloud. “I need you to spank me.”
Generally, he and Mycroft discussed various elements of ageplay while John was fully adult.  But he knew his adult mindset would censor him in this case, would keep him from fully expressing himself out of embarrassment.  John taking a liking to wetting had the hints of arousal to it, and while he had grown far closer to Mycroft than he’d ever imagined, he was not ready to discuss his sex life with the man.   That was something they’d rarely touched, not least of all because John’s sex life involved Mycroft’s little brother.
“Daddy, were the pull-ups in the trolley for me?” he asked, voice sweet and small, standing with a blue and green striped pull-up in his hand.
Bunny began to cry a bit as he pointed to his head and then his throat, and Greg could see that the boy was disconcerted from waking up in the middle of the night, that he was clearly feeling a bit nonverbal and more than a bit needy.
Mycroft patted Sherlock’s rear.  “Go use the loo and then let’s sit down and have some lunch before John has to go to work and we put you down for a nap, okay, bud?”
Sherlock took a step forward, trying to cling onto Mycroft in a show of neediness.  But Mycroft refused to give in to Sherlock’s ploys.
John shrugged non-committedly, and if they had more time, Mycroft would have pushed to find out exactly what John was feeling at the moment.  As it was, Greg had knocked on the door to ask if they were ready to go, and Mycroft could hear Sherlock whining that he’d been woken up early only to have to wait around for the others to leave.
“And Sherlock?” Mycroft asked. He was impressed by John’s verbosity.  The man was clearly getting less self-conscious about expressing his needs and feelings as a little.  “He’ll tease.  Might be jealous of the attention.”
“Eat a few bites, Bun,” Mycroft suggested to John even as he nodded at Sherlock’s prattling on about lakes and food chains.  He placed the baby fork into John’s hand.  But John just rubbed at his eyes and pushed the food around on his plate.
After a long time-out, Sherlock had been released to play with an anxiously waiting Bunny, and the boys set about trying to determine a name for the new stuffed rabbit that had become such a constant presence in their lives over the past day.  It was while they were very seriously weighing the pros and cons of including a middle name in their deliberations, Sherlock keeping notes with a broken crayon on the inside back cover of a coloring book, that Greg entered the living room with the boys’ swim trunks in hand.
Bunny said nothing, seemingly paralyzed by the blooming wetness in the crotch of his underwear.  He squeezed the hand between his legs he had been holding himself with, but otherwise he remained as still as possible, somehow young enough to think that if he didn’t move a muscle, Sherlock wouldn’t notice.
Following through with the established routine of their usual little days seemed to settle both boys back into themselves rather quickly.  John was allowed to squirt the bubble bath into the tub while Sherlock chose the bath toys and tested the water so that it matched his idea of the perfect temperature, which luckily John never railed against.  John seemed to relax a bit more when he was undressed and the shameful borrowed pull-up (still dry, thankfully--Mycroft didn’t think the boy would have been able to handle two accidents in one day) had been removed.
John kissed along Sherlock’s neck and switched tactics, using the heel of his hand to press down.  He knew from experience that masturbating in a wet pull-up was equal parts stimulating and frustrating; the naughtiness of the wet material as it pressed against you was amazing, but the bulk of the soaked material made getting the right pressure from the outside a bit difficult.  The heel of the hand seemed to be the right move; Sherlock gasped and wrapped his fingers around John’s wrist to keep the pressure steady, moving to shift against John’s hand with increased intensity.
John did not prolong the conversation.  He took the phone from his ear and, with a quick, “Yeah, alright,” hung up, hearing the girl give a pathetic “Happy Christmas” through the speaker before they disconnected.
Greg stopped tickling and stepped aside to let the little one hurry to the toilet.  He helped Bunny down with his pajamas and dry pull-up, and the boy took a seat and began to pee.
There was urgency to his voice, the sort of no-nonsense tone he used when working with the efficiency required for police work.  John could not help but identify that it was reminiscent of the tone he used when in Papa-mode, working to solve a problem that had emerged between Sherlock and Bunny.
He cleared his throat, pointedly ignoring Greg’s concerned glance as he tried to ground himself to the crime scene.  It was important that he examine the details of the corpse to provide initial information.  He needed to be adult.
"Or did his wife and kids a favor," the bald man said, holding up the weathered wedding ring in the evidence bag.
Hi lovelies--You've all been incredibly sweet when leaving comments and kudos--thank you!  I'm going to respond to comments in just a minute, but thought I would go ahead and post a short update in the mean time.  This chapter is basically just fluff and cuteness--hopefully it will make you smile!  Keep sending your ideas and I'll try to fit them in when I can!
He hugged his knees to his chest and cried, unsuccessful at keeping himself silent and beyond the notice of the nightmare creature perched beneath the bed.  He became more and more panicked that it was waiting for him to step off the bed, that it was waiting to grab his ankle and yank him close, and the more he tried to keep from crying, the more he cried.  The monster would brandish his jagged, twisted flash of a knife and bring him back to the darker world he had once known.
“Let’s see if we can’t find something to cheer up my sick little boys,” Daddy said, flipping channels to find something kid-appropriate.
“Brother, mine,” Mycroft said, pausing until Sherlock glanced up at him.  “When’s the last time you ate something?”
Greg ran a hand up John’s shoulder to cup the back of his neck.  He squeezed gently, helping to ground John.  It was exactly what John needed to keep him from dissolving further into sobs, and he was grateful for the gesture.
“Now would be the time for you to piss yourself, John,” Sherlock breathed when they’d parted for a moment.
There were tears forming in the kid’s eyes when he next met Greg’s gaze, and he was sucking hard at his thumb, but his face was set as if he were trying to keep from breaking down.  Greg reached out to place a hand on the boy’s knee in assurance, then gently guided the kid's hand away from his mouth so that he could speak clearly.
Warnings for gender confusion and general angst, in case either of those topics may be triggering for you.
“He’s doing fine,” Mycroft said.  “The tantrum settled him, allowed him to express the frustration he’s been avoiding.”
Bunny yawned.  He let himself go limp as he was carried to the master bedroom and placed beside a sprawled-out Sherlock, who was twisted up in the sheets.  Mycroft settled Sherlock back into a more comfortable position, then straightened and re-tucked the sheet around both boys.
It was Greg who noticed him first, glancing up from his corner of the puzzle on the far side of the kitchen table when Sherlock entered the room.  Mycroft noticed Greg’s shift in attention and turned around in his chair to face his brother.  Both men were clearly contemplating Sherlock, gauging his current state of mind.  Sherlock, now adult, could not help but feel a bit embarrassed by his earlier behavior--tantrums and all.
“That’s a good boy,” he said, but Sherlock shrugged him off and turned his attention back to his alligator, who he made walk along the table edge.  The boy still had a ways to go.
Mycroft remained finely attuned to Sherlock’s state of mind.  There was a careful art to knowing how much the boy needed.  Mycroft had become skilled at understanding the tells Sherlock had to show he’d had enough, and, today, it was a gasping sob that came after a long, drawn-out pattern of intense hits.
“You’re sweating, kiddo,” Daddy said, sitting Bunny down on his unmade bed.  The fact that Papa hadn’t put new sheets on Bunny’s bed made him blush, as he wound up sitting on the plastic sheet.  “Let’s change you out of that nightshirt.”
headspace.  Besides, he didn’t he think it best that he speak to Sherlock while young without being in the presence of Mycroft or Greg.
New update!  Thanks for your kudos and comments--they really do keep me inspired to write.  Let me know what you'd like to see during the weekend at the lake in the comments below!
It was clear from the darkness behind his little brother’s eyes, the apathetic haze that generally came with Sherlock’s bouts of depression, not only that Sherlock had wet the bed unintentionally, but that he was currently struggling against the self-loathing and self-doubt usually brought on by his accidents, emotions which took residence in the corners of Sherlock’s worst days.
“Not at all,” Mycroft said as he pulled away to begin unbuttoning Greg’s jeans, but the quickness of his movements said otherwise.
John could have asked questions, but he had a sinking feeling he already knew what Sherlock was up to.  It was one thing for an adult Sherlock to make Mycroft’s life miserable; the brothers generally worked themselves into a passive aggressive silence and eventually argued their differences out as soon as one of them needed the other.  It was quite another thing entirely for a little Sherlock to plague Mycroft with temper tantrums, outbursts, and general disagreeableness; Mycroft could not ignore his younger brother or simply wait out Sherlock’s grudge if the man was in headspace.
“I can’t,” he said, but a part of him was desperate for Papa to gather him up and coax the story out of him.
“You won't make it to the toilet now, anyway,” Sherlock sneered despite that fact that he himself was standing with thighs pressed close together, clearly holding his own bladder.  “I can tell you're already doing it.”
“Come here, lady bug,” he said, holding his arms out and guiding the boy to the rocking chair, where he sat before settling the boy into his lap.  It was clear whatever had impacted John that morning was still affecting the boy now.  “Papa’s got you.”
“Alright, loves,” Greg called as he returned with armfuls of take-away bags.  “Dinnertime and then presents!”
For the first time that night, John was glad he had not gone to Mycroft’s to be babied.  Being adult certainly had its own advantages.
Thanks so much as always for your kudos and comments--they always make me smile and inspire me to keep writing!
“Let’s get you clean first, bud,” he said,  “and then we can cuddle a bit before you go back to sleep.”
John nodded, straightened out his rumpled clothing to the best of his abilities, then followed Greg downstairs, where he put on the front of adulthood while he exchanged a litany of pleasantries--thank you for having me and see you soon and Happy Christmas again and again--while Greg fetched their coats and hugged his family.
Sherlock nodded, currently feeling as if he would agree to anything if it meant he could stay cradled in his big brother’s arms.
Mycroft was talking to important people, and Sherlock wasn’t supposed to interrupt when Mycroft had to work.  But he was uncomfortable and the living room was cold and he’d wet too much to clean himself up.  He pushed open the office door and stepped inside.
“Do you remember how we talked earlier about people acting rude because they didn’t understand something?” Greg asked.
You're all so amazing with your comments and suggestions--thank you!  It's been a stressful week, so I thought we could all use some cute fluff and lots of caring!  I apologize for those of you waiting for Part 2 of 'Pushing Boundaries' over on tumblr--I was hoping to have that updated before the newest chapter of this story, but inspiration struck for this one and I ended up working on this instead.  I will do my best to get back to 'Pushing Boundaries' as soon as possible, especially because I've officially reached 100 followers on tubmlr, which is super exciting!
“Come on, ladybug,” Greg said, voice a bit louder now in an effort to rouse John more awake.  “Let’s get you into the car so we can get you to my brother’s for a proper night’s sleep.”
But Sherlock wanted his brother’s help, wanted to return to a night like when they were children, before Bunny had come into the picture and when Sherlock really had needed Mycroft desperately.  So, when he could feel the diaper filled, he did not stop peeing.  In fact, he readjusted himself so that he was peeing right against the leg hole of the pull-up, and sure enough he felt the diaper begin to leak, and he was peeing into his clothes and onto the bed sheets.  The warm liquid spread out beneath him in a small puddle, and, by the time his bladder was empty, his pajama pants were saturated and his sheets--forced by the plastic sheet Uncle Greg had put on the bed earlier to absorb all of the liquid--drenched from one edge of the twin mattress to the other.
“Now, Sherlock,” Mycroft ordered, voice harsh and dominant enough to send Sherlock sighing and dragging his feet towards the bathroom.
Mycroft took a seat on the bed, resting his hand on Sherlock's leg beneath the blankets.  “Everyone of all ages has accidents now and then," he said. "And everyone needs different things to make them feel comforted.  That doesn’t make them a baby.  Do you understand?”
“Let me go,” Bunny said, distressed, trying to yank himself free from where he was tied to the column.
He settled himself into his armchair, pulling out his mobile and beginning to type away.  Mycroft and John shared a look.
Sherlock blinked up at him and wiped his tears eyes with the back of his hands before leaning forward to press his face into John’s sweater.
Usually, Sherlock barely knew what day of the week it was, nevermind their plans for the following week.  It figured Sherlock would want to launch into a conversation about future plans just as John was beginning to find the correct direction for the blog post.
He underestimated the way his heart would begin racing as soon as he finally heard footsteps climbing the staircase, and at the thought that he was about to get caught once and for all, he felt his hand growing warm and wet in his crotch.  He was peeing in his pants.
His younger brother was left rather speechless, and he humphed, turning to press his face against the mattress as he drew his legs to his chest, closing himself off from the outside world.  By admitting to his own wrongdoing, Mycroft had cut his little brother’s plan off at the knees, leaving Sherlock with few options beyond childish grunting and whining.
“Have you been thinking about me?” Greg asked in the midst of snogging, enjoying the image of Mycroft fantasizing about Greg when they were unable to be together.
“There’s a plastic sheet on his mattress and on Bunny’s, just in case,” Mycroft said, “Even so.  You know as well as I that it’s far easier to deal with a wet pull-up than wet sheets.”
“There were bad thoughts all morning,” he said, unable to make eye contact.  “But I was distracted by the telly until I…”
Bunny scooted closer to Mycroft when the Marley brothers appeared draped in chains, resting his back against the base of the couch so he could press his cheek against Mycroft’s knee.  The boy looked adorable in his red and white striped one-piece pajamas, nursing his favorite pacifier as he cradled both Willa the rabbit and his baby blanket to his chest, and the solid presence of the kid leaning against him grounded him a bit, for which Mycroft was grateful.  He may have been a loss of exactly how to care for Sherlock while they were away from home and avoiding the notice of their parents, but knew how to show up for his kiddos here in London.
“Don’t need it,” John mumbled, cheeks pinking, suddenly transitioning into headspace at a far quicker pace than a moment before.
“Stop, Mycroft,” Sherlock said as Mycroft began pulling him out of the car.  “I don’t need the loo.”
“No!  I hate you and I hate this fucking trip and I want to go home!” Sherlock shouted, fully aware he was behaving like anything except a rational adult but unable to keep himself calm.  It felt good to prod and yell, and swearing and sassing his brother kept him from slipping down into the neediness of a younger headspace.
Sherlock moaned and then his sadness seemed to turn to anger.  He shoved himself away from Mycroft and stormed out of the room, mumbling about not needing anyone and how Mycroft was a mean brother.
“I felt mad,” Sherlock said, starting over.  “I felt mad because you got to be a princess and I...I wanted to be littler, again.”
“Come in, Mycroft,” John said.  His throat was raw from his earlier crying, and his voice sounded strange to his ears.  Without realizing it, he had grown used to the more childish tone he slipped into whenever he spent time as Bunny.
Mycroft raised a hand to run it through Sherlock’s hair, but Sherlock batted his hand away with an angry growling sound that surprised even Sherlock himself.
“Okay, hon,” Mycroft said, closing the storybook--The Velveteen Rabbit--and standing from where he had been sitting on the edge of John’s bed,  “Time for lights out.”
“Sherlock, can we talk?” Greg asked through the crack in the doorway.  He had to bite his tongue against the nicknames--bud, buddy, kid, champ--that were desperate to be spoken as a means of comfort and coddling.  Sherlock is not little, Greg told himself.  He needed to shift his tactics.
“Thanks for the ‘gator and for lunch and the cotton candy and the trip to the zoo, Uncle Greg,” Sherlock mumbled, and, not surprisingly, John lifted his face from Mycroft’s shoulder and mumbled a thank you as well.  Mycroft smiled and told him he was a polite boy.  The praise seemed to help to settle John a bit more.
It wasn’t like Bunny to argue, and Sherlock glanced back at Uncle Greg to see how he would react.  Uncle Greg looked more confused than angry.
“None of that, now,” John said, soothing Sherlock by running a hand through the curls on the back of his head. “You did all you could.  No one is cleverer than you.”
John could not help but squirm and laugh as Sherlock tickled, cheeks burning red as he imagined how ridiculous he must look, a grown man dissolving into giggles.  He pushed against Sherlock’s chest, but the man’s arms were far longer than John’s, and Sherlock was too dead-set on accomplishing his goal.
Sherlock began sniffling once again, clearly upset that Mycroft had learned about his earlier wetting.
“I want Daddy,” John sniffled, and then, after a moment where Greg looked down at him with raised eyebrows, he broke down in hysterical sobbing.
John could see that the boy was listening to what he had to say, and he hoped that would remain the case when he moved from empathy to chastising.  It was true he had a sense of where Sherlock’s tantrum had come from, but that didn’t mean the words hadn’t been harmful and painful on multiple levels, to both his young and adult self.
Before John could process what he was seeing, Mycroft lifted his younger brother into his arms.  Sherlock wrapped his legs around Mycroft’s waist and lay his head on his shoulder.  It was an act that they had clearly performed many times before.  John was surprised that Mycroft could lift his brother so easily, but he seemed to have little trouble as he crossed the kitchen and took his seat back at the table, this time with a lapful of sniffling Sherlock.
I have a very clear idea of where I want the next few chapters to go, so I'm just hoping I'll have the time to write them this week!  I'm in the midst of busy real-life things, however, so that comes first, I'm afraid.
Despite the boy’s distress, it was comforting to find John aged down, and Mycroft ran his thumb over the boy’s flushed cheek to wipe at his tears.  Bunny turned to glance up at him, eyes glossy and lower lip trembling.
He held his plush alligator beneath one arm and his plush dinosaur beneath the other as he ventured into the hallway and to the master bedroom.  Halfway there he shifted the alligator to the same arm as his Dino in order to leave a hand free so he could suck his thumb.  Mycroft had first seen Sherlock suck his thumb on a night he had gone to him to explain that his sheets were wet, and it had become part of the pattern: clean up, fresh clothes, and his thumb to comfort him while Mycroft rubbed his back.
Sherlock pouted but did as he was told.  Mycroft pulled over the corner armchair and sat facing Sherlock but said nothing, simply raised his eyebrows to signal that he expected Sherlock to explain himself.
He optimistically lay out a new pair of pajamas for Sherlock--blue cotton covered in little sharks--in the navy blue bedroom, and a new nightgown for John--light yellow with a fuzzy bunny on the chest--in the pale green bedroom.  He had only just begun, but already he had stocked each room with a selection of clothing, toys, and comfort items specific to each boy.
They’d made it home without any further incident, John silent and seething with anger towards himself built not only out of the soaking wet state of his jeans but also out of the arousal he felt in spite of his displeasure.  He was disgusted with himself in more ways than one, and he’d let not only Sherlock, but Greg, see him squirm.
“It’s not a contest, ‘Lock,” Mycroft said.  “Little boys learn at different rates, no matter their age.  It doesn’t matter whether you use the potty all the time and earn twenty stickers or whether you use your pull-ups or even your pants and get no stickers; your Papa and I will never love you any less.”
Sherlock woke up in Mycroft and Papa’s room, remembering Bunny’s nightmare in the middle of the night as the reason he wasn’t in his own bed.
Mycroft hummed, lips pursed, but allowed John to lead him upstairs, for the moment turning his attention away from his disappointed frustration over John’s choice of coping mechanism in order to prepare himself for the conversation he needed to have with Sherlock.  It was rare Mycroft Holmes doubted, but when it came to his younger brother, he was particularly susceptible to second guessing.
John nodded absently, grateful that he and Mycroft were on the same page once more.  He tucked the plush bunny beneath his chin and swayed slightly from side to side.  His mind was already so calm and settled as he felt the fabric of the nightshirt against his chest and hips; he wasn’t sure what would happen when he was also dressed in the pink pull-ups he was so excited were actually his.
Bunny let her face fall into Papa’s shoulder, feeling happy and sleepy now that she knew Papa was home safe from work.  It was such a relief after feeling the pull for him all morning, and she never wanted him to leave ever again.
“I will, Myc,” Greg said, and, when Mycroft did not release his hold on Greg’s now knotted tie: “You just worry about the baby.  I’ll look after him.  I promise.”
“Hi, little bun,” Greg said, smiling as he brushed the hair from the boy’s face and held his dropped pacifier to his lips once more.  “Go back to sleep, love.  Christmas tomorrow.”
He was unsure whether his head hurt because he was hungover or because he was getting a cold--there was a bit of congestion in his sinuses and a scratch in his throat--but, in either case, he wasn’t going to be able to fall back to sleep unless he decompressed a bit and found some asprin.  As he sat up to climb out of bed, however, he knew something else was off besides his headache.
“We should get cleaned up,” John said, pressing himself up onto his elbows and causing Sherlock to whine as he was jostled.  “You get in the shower.  I’ll take care of the bedding and then join you.”
“Finally!” Sherlock said as he scrambled into the kitchen, all sign of his previous tears disappeared.
“All we’re saying is whoever killed him probably did the poor guy a favor,” Anderson said with a pointed smirk to John as he stepped back into the bathroom, proud of himself for the irony.
“Okay,” Greg said, holding the boy close as he ran a hand up and down his back.  “Papa understands, Bun.”
“It’s okay, bud,” he said, finding himself quickly slipping into endearing nicknames in an attempt to help John free himself of some of his clearly mounted up anxiety.  “You’re welcome to give it a try.  Sherlock could certainly benefit from socializing with someone his own age for a change.”
John emerged from his bedroom, dressed in jeans and a sweater.  He nodded at Mycroft, seemingly having trouble making eye contact, before following Greg downstairs and into the kitchen, where they would wait for Mycroft’s next word.
This chapter is a mix of angst and fluff/cuteness.  It does contain discussion of and some depiction of depression in the first half (the Mycroft/Sherlock section), so take care with reading if that is triggering for you.  So many of you requested Sherlock slipping a bit younger in age, and it seemed to me that one way that might occur would be for him to be dealing with some angsty feelings.  This chapter has the beginnings of him slipping younger, and I'll continue to explore that in the next chapter or two.  It also has a good deal of discussion about wetting, which I know I use often--In the next few chapters, I'll try not to focus too much on that aspect as I have been, as I know it's not everyone's favorite thing.  I just find it so cute so I sometimes can't help but include it!
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow in turn and collapsed into the kitchen chair at the head of the table.  He picked up a puzzle piece and began half-heartedly attempting to place it in the correct spot.
Sherlock nodded.  Bunny felt very young, and that much must have been clear to Sherlock.  Between the thunderstorm and the emotional turmoil of the morning and the fact that he was, at least for this moment, able to relax in Sherlock’s presence, he had sunk into a comfortable littleness that, for the first time since they were looking for frogs outside, was not overly plagued by jarring moments of adult thought.
“Okay,” Bunny said, voice quiet.  He lay close against Mycroft and pulled his knees up towards his chest.
“Come here, kid,” Mycroft said, an endearment he had picked up from Lestrade.  Sherlock allowed himself to be pulled out of his chair and into his brother’s lap.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock yelled after succumbing to a nasty streak of coughing, voice loud and shrill.  “The baby’s crying!”
He had to move quickly.  He pulled a pair of grey joggers from the bottom drawer of his ocean creatures bureau, then moved to the top drawer in order to find dry underwear.  But he hesitated while reaching for a pair of dinosaur undies, eyes catching on the stack of pull-ups on the other side of the drawer.  No one would be able to tell if he put one on, and if he had an accident he could change himself and not be in danger of having to put a black mark on the stupid training chart.  He didn’t need a pull-up, but no one had to know.
