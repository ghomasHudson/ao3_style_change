John realised that that fumbling flirting he had experienced yesterday was just for show. This was the real thing and it was, frighteningly enough, hard to withstand.  But Sherlock’s smile didn’t last and John found himself disappointed.
“YOU DIED YOU PRICK!” John bellowed back. Sherlock could feel John’s breath on his face, he smelled of alcohol. Sherlock showed John back. Hard enough to make him stagger back.
- Shush John I’m thinking! Was the answer he got.
I’m not gonna let him take one of the microscopes home, I’ve learned from your mistakes, she smiled to take the edge of the words. John tried to smile back but it was more of a grimace.
John had lunch again with Molly the following day. She came late and was blushing when she sat down.
Are you leaving? He asked. Sherlock turned around, he looked surprised.
- So, tomorrow at eight? He asked. Sherlock nodded again and John left the kitchen, trying to hide his smile.
-Saturday?
"Dr Watson" he said extending his hand.
Any good? John decided not to get offended.
- Do you know how hard this has been on me? Being your little experiment so you can find out if you like me or not? John felt a pang of guilt, it was true he was using Sherlock as a labrat.
Hi, he manages to say. What on earth did Sherlock want? Did he need help steel more bodyparts? Maybe he thought John owed him to help now.
- Oh no, thats Janice, Janice Williams. She is a childhood friend but she could just aswell be my sister. Our parents were friends so we grew up together. We had so much fun. She was the only one who had the patience to listen to my father’s ramblings about his stamps. Sherlock put the photo back on the mantelpiece then strode out of the room.
He began to leave, but stopped at the door. He turned, then bowed respectfully to John’s grandmother. “All hail the queen,” he proclaimed quietly. “Gods keep you, m’lady.”
John is woken up the next morning by a restlessness he can’t quite describe. He wanders through his rooms, not quite knowing how to dress for the day. He finally chooses something comfortable and heads over to the kitchen. The cooking fire is making the kitchen more sweltering than he predicted, and he can smell every single jar of spice on the shelves. He fills his bowl, thanks the cook, and decides the infirmary should be cool and quiet enough for his needs today.
I will be the first to admit that I know nothing about prostitution. I read fics that feature characters who start as prositutes, but I understand those stories aren't reality. It is my hope that this portrayal isn't offensive or ridiculous.
He placed a hand on Mary’s shoulder. “You’ve survived worse patients, myself included.” Mary smiled wryly at that. John turned away and set his shoulders. “Keep me updated,” he said to Standford, who saluted and crossed into the room after John left.
“Look at him,” she replied bluntly. “You could charge anything and it would be paid.”
“Spit it out, Standford,” John commanded gently.
“He’s an utter arse,” she answered bluntly. “Self-defense mechanism, yes, but an arse nonetheless.”
Standford spoke even more quietly. “He’s…a prostitute, sir. An alpha prostitute.”
His movement rushed back. “Enough!” he barked, and the two stopped mid-word. John breathed for a moment, then scrubbed a hand over his face. He turned toward the hallway. “Standford!” he called, and the guard stood behind him in a few moments.
“Mary said he’s not to do more than a few laps around the shelves, sir,” Standford dutifully reported, and John nodded his understanding. He stood and made his way to the duo, then turned so his good shoulder was closest to the invalid. If worst came to worst, Standford could help them both to their feet.
Sherlock lights up at that, and John can’t help but laugh. “Let me eat, first,” he half-begs, causing Sherlock to roll his eyes and scoff. “If you
un-beta'd and short
As Sherlock’s hand clamped down on John’s shoulder, John realized two things. One, the man’s hands didn’t suffer from the weakness his body had incurred: his grip was downright painful. Two, the man’s hands were enormous, with the longest fingers John had ever seen.
The sherriff sighed irritably and spat. “Nothin’ much I can tell you, boss,” he said to John, crossing his arms. “Same as all the others. The crops are ruined, not a trace of who did it, and so on. Far as I can reckon, Bart was doin’ his own patrols, seein’ how far he lived from town and all, and caught them. Poor bastard.”
He swallowed and forcibly dismissed the realization. He looked up at the man and put a pleasant smile on his face. “Ready?” he asked.
John’s hands tightened over the arms of his chair. He cursed his injury on a near-daily basis (especially in the aches of winter) but couldn’t regret the winding path of his fate. War had allowed him to taste strange liquors, strange spices, strange lovers. Upon his return, Harriet’s caring family surrounded him, and eventually, on a cool, summer evening, Harriet had relinquished the holdings to John.
“In the west corner of your land, sir,” his head guard, Standford, supplied. The man’s normally jolly face was creased with worry. “I believe he’d been following the river but was cut down by starvation. He’s skin and bone, sir.”
His leg started to ache, all the way down to the bone. John grit his teeth and clamped the cane more tightly. He forced himself to breathe slowly and deeply, as Mary had advised a hundred times.
John could feel secondary terror prickling across his skin, and he forced himself to breathe. “What is your plan?” he forced out. “After Mary kicks you out of the infirmary?”
His voice was low, and quiet, and knife-edge dangerous. “Gentlemen, this lady deserves your respect.” He paused, and checked the face of every single elder in the room. “Do not call me about this matter again.”
John heard the doors to the library crash open, and the staggering feet of a half-dozen men. “M’lord!” a man’s voice called, obviously attempting to be respectful but falling into the panic of an urgent situation.
He cleared his throat and silence cut through the crowd like a chill. “I’m going to need everyone to leave,” he ordered calmly. “I will update you when there is news.” He moved out of the way and after a few minutes, the room was blissfully empty.
“Omegas would seem the most obvious choice,” he admitted. “Heat frenzy and all.”
“Not in the last few weeks. I’m expecting one, though.” John shook his head, then adjusted his hat and clapped the sheriff on the shoulder. “Keep me updated. If his savings can’t pay for the burial, I’d be happy to help out.”
The stranger returned the gaze for a very long moment, then nodded so slightly John almost didn’t catch it. He looked away, and John had an idea. He dug into his pocket and pulled out the folding knife he kept there, a remnant from his days in the army. He held it up for the stranger to see, then carefully opened it so he could see how the mechanism worked. He snapped it closed and placed it between them, then scooted it towards the stranger, who just stared at John, expression unreadable in the low light.
“They called you to arrest me. They hold that even though I have maintained the Watson holdings for over half my life, I am unfit to rule solely because I am an Omega.”
is still unclear. He tries to put it from his mind. Scooting out of his solitude, he can see Sherlock fidgeting in his chair, impatience to leave palpable. He can tell now that Mary is trying to remain calm but her patient is close to driving her into the madhouse. She glares at John over her empty bowl, wordlessly. John shrugs apologetically, to which Mary rolls her eyes (in a very Sherlock-like manner, John notes) and turns to open a book on her desk. John walks over and helps Sherlock out of his chair. His grip might be stronger than yesterday. As they hobble out of the infirmary together, Mary addresses them both while still perusing her text. “Stay out as long as you like, but rest when you’re tired.” After a beat, she looks up at them. “Is that understood?”
“Where?” John asked, fingers moving to take a pulse. Relief washed through him: this one was alive. The pulse was slow and weak, but it was there.
This chapter is actually the reason I wrote this fic: I wanted to create a role-reversal and turn a trope on it's head--specifically, the assumption in alpha/beta/omega-verse that omegas would be sex workers (since they're kinda the equivalent of women?). I also wanted to upend the assumption that "omega = woman" by having John, the omega in this love story, exhibit both male and female traits. I know that the alpha/beta/omega-verse (slash trope) is varied and can range from "ridiculous PWP" to "where's the freaking porn??" and I wanted to create a story somewhere in the middle. Anyway. I love trope-upheval, obviously.
John’s stomach rumbled and as if on cue, Mary poked her head around her office door.
John paused, still melancholy from the latest act of vandalism, still sore from the ride to and from the scene, and tried to laugh. He halfway succeeded. “You should be grateful I don’t allow her to use leeches,” he said wearily, and sat on the stool next to the cot. The stranger was already looking healthier: the bruises visible on his arms were fading, eyes even brighter today than yesterday. He was sitting up in the cot, bowl of what looked like oatmeal in his lap; if Mary had filled the bowl, then half of the oatmeal had been eaten already.
With some breakfast, he is finally able to label his mood: it’s like the last ember in a fire glowing in the early hours of the morning. But what the mood
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The door to the bathing room opened and Mary peeked around it. Her grim demeanor lightened when she saw John. “Good man!” she whispered. “Now help me get him into the cot. He’s thin but he’s heavy!”
True to promise, Sherlock wobbled into the library, leaning on Standford’s arm, slightly after midday. He looked grumpy, and John was reminded of his own time re-learning how to walk. He stifled a laugh: there was something endearing about the combination of Sherlock’s petulant frown and the unruly mess of hair curling over his eyes.
Once again sitting in the library, John gave the ledger up for a bad job and turned his chair towards the window. He could remember the day his grandfather died and his grandmother, a frail omega, refused to allow the next “legitimate” (an alpha cousin) heir take over the land. John had been a child, hidden and eavesdropping on a room full of anger. This very library, in fact, just with fewer shelves and books. Over and over, the town elders had demanded the guards take the omega away, to be locked up in the jail, to be taken to the insane asylum in the next town over. Every time, the guards and household staff refused. The Sheriff, a terrifying being to John in his youth, was called, and John was in tears by the time he could hear the lawkeeper’s boots clinking down the hall towards the meeting.
The sheriff had walked through the door, and John was still grateful to this day he hadn’t seen the look on the man’s face: the adults in the room had, and had gone deathy quiet in just a few heartbeats.
“Too hot in the kitchen,” he explained, then curiously glanced around for Sherlock – he hadn’t been on his cot when John came in.
John couldn’t speak—there was nothing to say, not really.
John heard a single person resume breathing, and breathed a sigh of relief himself. No intruders, just a startled stranger in hiding. He began searching the shadows with his eyes, still moving carefully through the room. Finally, he found the stranger curled into the space between the medicine cabinet and the far wall. The stranger’s eyes were wide open, jet black in the low light and glinting with the pattern of the flame.
John sighed, then noded. “Please take him to the Healer.” The woman, Mary, lived on the other side of the house because she was John’s personal physician. “You probably should’ve taken him there, first, then alerted me.” The men shifted uncomfortably, avoiding his gaze. Standford took a step closer and lowered his voice. His eyes skittered away and he bowed his head slightly. “Sir, you should know…” His embarrassment was palpable.
The Healder scrutinized him for a long moment. “None of his bones are broken, so he should be walking in the next fortnight.”
Standford, bewildered but accustomed to following John’s orders, sheathed his sword. “As you say, m’lord.”
“Who called me all the way up here to arrest somebody?” His inflection formed the question but his tone dared only the bravest to respond.
She frowned at him and punched him lightly in the arm. “Don’t tempt me, sir,” she answered, and John laughed.
John turned back to the oatmeal. “I may not be able to run a kingdom, but at least I have a way with people,” he said ruefully. He could feel Mary frowning at him, but she didn’t say anything further.
Sherlock nodded indulgently. “Take a step back and look at the bigger picture: even the youngest, healthiest omegas only go into heat once a month, and for days at a time. There’s only a small market for that kind of sexual activity, so no significant amounts of money can be made. And further: why would those omegas sell themselves into slavery when they could make ten times as much money in a marriage agreement? No, the omegas desperate enough to turn to prostitution are made less desirable by their debilitating and unpredictable heats. True money is made in servicing the hundreds of thousands of travelers who pass through the northland’s cities each year. For those clients, alphas are the best solution: a quick night of pleasure, a burst of light in the endless winter nights.”
John didn’t approach. He carefully knelt, then sat on the cold stone floor, placing his cane behind him. They stared at each other in the silence, and John wished the whirring summer night could be around them instead of the heartbeat in his ears.
John ponders his ancestry.
John felt sick. Most farmers on his land had enough family and neighbors to keep patrols after the first acts of vandalism were discovered. Bart lived on an isolated farm, the nearest soul a mile through dense and dangerous forest. He wasn’t a frail old man: just three months ago he’d won the strongman contest at the spring festival. John didn’t have the guards to post at every farm, and even if he did, he’d probably be sending them to their gruesome deaths.
When John got close enough to scare the birds away, Sherlock let out a huff of frustration and unfolded his legs. He looked over at John, presumably to say something rude, but stopped himself. He narrowed his eyes at John, a series of expressions forming and flitting away that John couldn’t interpret. Before he seems to make up his mind about what to say, Mary speaks lightly.
..." he starts, but is cut off by John brandishing a second hat triumphantly. This one is even more absurd than John's current headgear. John can see the tantrum brewing and he smiles guilelessly.
Sherlock shrugged again. “I was extremely lucky to be born with this face and this body: with a fair bit of shrewdness, I became my own master, up to a point. I could pick my own clients, within reason. I was very lucrative. It actually became a game to me, to learn how to understand what the client wanted, and deliver flawlessly.” He was preening slightly, and John chuckled quietly. Hearing the story without remorse was like debridement by fire: this man had found a way to survive a fate that John couldn’t imagine surviving in a thousand lifetimes.
The night shushed and chirped around John as he reclined under the moonless night, wooden chair cool beneath him, warm blanket draped across his legs. He was facing away from the doors that led to his rooms so that he could see the stars stretching from the horizon all the way to the dome of the heavens. The bells announcing midnight prayers had rung an inderterminable time ago: the cool night flowed around him like an ocean’s tide, cycling through noise and silence in endless repetitions. John was no stranger to sleeplessness; he preferred these quiet eternities where his mind could be at peace while his body couldn’t rest.
John looked from Mary to the stranger, who shrugged without a hint of regret. “It’s not like you’re in the middle of a shortage,” he said primly, and John felt a laugh bubble up from under his gloom.
"Either you wear this hat outside, or I tell Mary you exerted yourself needlessly," he says, holding out the hat. Sherlock full-on glares at him, expression not dimming a whit as he hobbles across the floor and snatches it out of John's hand. He crams it onto his head, over his summer-weather-curled locks.
The sheriff was watching him out of the corner of his eye. “You get another offer to sell?” he asked quietly, and John sighed.
Tonight he allowed himself to drown in the emptiness, in the lost futures where his children filled the rooms with noise during the night and cast shadows across floorboards glowing in midday sun. He allowed himself to imagine a mate, handsome and practical, looking up from whatever task they were doing and smiling at the sight of him.
she said every time,
Sherlock’s eyes glanced away; it was the first time he hadn’t looked haughty since John had seen him awake. After a long moment, he lifted a hand and gripped the inside of his elbow, as if it had suddenly pained him.
Sherlock’s blunt, straightforward honesty emboldened John and he spoke. “Why are you, a decently well-educated and well-spoken alpha, a prostitute?”
John wasn’t halfway through the door before the stranger sighed in an exaggerated manner, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. John decided to err on the side of pleasant authority.
John turned to Mary, who was now facing him. “Do not rebuke him for speaking the truth, even in anger,” he said quietly, and she blinked at him. After a moment, she nodded minutely.
“I am the ruler of these lands,” he said, bowing slightly. “I would prefer you not call me king, but…”
John limped into the infirmary. The six guards had managed to attract onlookers like old fruit attracts flies, all whispering and muttering and generally crowding the small room. The door to the bathing room was closed: John inferred that the stranger was inside, being bathed by the Healer.
John took a deep breath, in through his nose and out his mouth. “Good,” he said firmly. “Good.” Two weeks should be just fine. Hopefully. He turned to walk out. “Summon me when he starts speaking, please. I’ll be in the library.”
“Sir?” he asked, sword in hand, visibly confused at the calmness of the room.
The first thing he saw was Standford slumped in one of the chairs lining the walls, snoring slightly. John blinked and moved farther into the room. Sherlock was curled up against the third row of bookshelves, having stolen a cushion from one of the couches in the room to sit on. John blinked again. His favorite book was sitting open in Sherlock’s hands, and the man seemed deeply absorbed in the tale.
John turned to the stranger, whose eyes were still shut, and raised his voice slightly. “You’re my responsibility until you’re fit to travel and willing to leave. I will provide sanctuary as far as I’m able until you reach the border of my land.”
John blinked at him, then smiled a bit. “Are you saying you want a tour of the house?” he said, half teasingly. “I would think you’d rather do your own explorations.”
Even this close to the man, John couldn’t catch a whiff of Alpha, so he asked Mary about it after the stranger is carefully placed on the cot and covered with a blanket.
John, summer sunshine warming his outstretched legs, forced himself to breathe. Yes, that wizened old woman who had stood defiantly to be arrested would be proud of him: he, who couldn’t pull the farmers in his kingdom out of their post-war debts; he, who was practically lame in one leg; he, who would never bear…
I knew about your PTSD and still put you in a situation that could trigger it. I should have realised being trapped by a much larger man could be frightening. John looked at Sherlock in disbelief,
John woke by the sounds of the violin. Sherlock was playing one of his own pieces. It was a bit dark for John’s taste, not on of his favourites. But Sherlock preferred dark and dramatic when he was thinking. He only stopped playing when John put a cup of tea in front of him.
- So you’re saying you wanted me to kiss you but it wasn’t because of any romantic feelings towards me, it was my looks?
- I need a shower, he said. He walked to the bathroom and opened the door. He stopped and turned to John.
John sat down in the one opposite, eying the books with more interest.
- Yes John, I lovelove you, he said sarcastically. It was the first time John had someone confess their love for him one second and then calling him stupid in the other.
John picked up his bag, put the light out and close his door behind him. He wondered if he could ever look at that door again without thinking about Sherlock, thinking about what John had done to him.
I have to go, I’m on a case and the clock is ticking. I really didn’t have time to come to see you at all. I just… I couldn’t concentrate when you were avoiding me. Sherlock gave John another quick kiss, then he walked out of the office without a second glance. John sat down on the desk, stunned. He wasn’t really sure what just had happened. Somehow he had gone from breaking up with Sherlock to being in an outspoken relationship with him. His phone buzzed in his pocket and he took it out. “I’ll see you soon. X SH.”. John smiled, he got an x at least.
John was walking to his office a monday afternoon when he saw his mysterious student standing waiting for him. He was even taller than John had thought, he towered a good five inches above John. He looked nervous, shifting his footing every other second. He quickly eyes John before diverting his eyes. His hand that took John’s was sweaty but he hold on a moment to long, glancing down at John as he did.
John.
- Saturday is fine. Sherlock gave John a hint of a smile before he disappeared into his room and closed the door. They went on three more dates, all initiated by John. Sherlock accepted the invitation, seemed to have a good time and kissed John at the end of the evening. But he didn’t try to take things further, didn’t even try to kiss John with an open mouth. And he always trembled when John was near. It made John uncertain. He was falling for Sherlock, he could not deny it. But Sherlock almost looked like he was falling out of love with John. It made him second guesses everything. After the fourth date he didn’t ask if they were going on another one and Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. Until the next morning when John was sitting in the kitchen reading the morning paper. Sherlock came in and stood by the counter.
No, he’s still here. I was going to kick him out but then his brother came for a chat and well… now he is staying. Molly sat up straight looking at John with big eyes.
“Do you want one?” Alcohol wasn’t Sherlock’s drug of choice but he shared John’s sentiment.
But… John started, Sherlock sighed and kissed John to silence him. John stood motionless, fighting the desire that raced through him. Sherlock was holding his hands, laced his fingers with Johns. It was a sweet kiss, slow and exploratory. After a while John relaxed, he didn’t feel as angry any more and that made the arousal easier to deal with. He could savour the moment. When Sherlock picked up on the change in John’s posture he let go of John’s hans. Instead putting both his hands on John’s back, drawing him closer. He broke of the kiss and put his face against John’s neck. He made a sound of such content that John’s heart swelled. He put one of his hands on Sherlock’s neck, the other one at the small of his back. John felt a bit deflated. He wanted to protect Sherlock, plain and simple: he loved him and wanted to protect him. Instead he assaulted him, what he just had done must be seen as sexual harassment. Even though Sherlock said he liked it had he been forced to push John away, John had been that oblivious for the signals from Sherlock.
Do you want something to eat? Thai? Italian? Indian? He walked from the kitchen carrying a bunch of take away menyes. John laughed.
When Mr Andersson left John looked up Mr Holmes phone number. It was easy, Sherlock Holmes wasn’t exactly an ordinary name. He got to voicemail and recorded a message stating that he wanted to speak to him as soon as possible. An hour later there was a knock on his office door. A tall man in a tailored suit was standing in his doorway. He had an umbrella in his hands, he tapped it onto the doorframe. John rose from his chair, stepping out in front of his desk.
We just have to give it some time I think, John said, trying to sound convincing.
You stopped before I passed out right? Said Sherlock, John looked perplexed at him. Like that made it all better.
You are in love with me? He asked after a while looking John in the eyes. John nodded as a reply.
Do you ever cook? Sherlock looked at him, surprised at the question.
“Means.” He felt out of his depth. More than he had in a long time. John took Sherlock’s hand, but didn’t move closer. Still, Sherlock saw it as a good sign.
"And by the way" Mr Holmes leaned back into the room.
“So you’re saying you have been in love? That someone rejected you and broke your heart?” John sneered.
Mycroft likes to feel needed, I think I would stay clean anyway but this course has it’s merits.
"John Watson" John said and opened the door to his office. He wondered what had prompted this man to seek him out, he clearly didn’t want to be there.
Well, you never met me before. Sherlock smiled, looking deep into John’s eyes.
There is talk about PTSD and druguse throughout this work.
- Got you how? John rolled his eyes.
I want to know what you want to do about us. You told me you were in love with me and you show up here almost every day but we haven’t spoken about it. Sherlock turned around and leaned against the bookcase. He looked like he wanted to be anywhere but where he was.
- No, not really he cleared his throat.
I don’t know, it was quite a trick, trying to flirt with me to get me distracted and get my card. It obviously worked. John felt he started to blush. He was embarrassed at how easily Sherlock had duped him. He understood now that the whole nervousness from yesterday was just an act.
- Mrs Gordon? He asked, Sherlock just smiled.
I don’t like feelings, Sherlock said after a while. John looked up at him. His brows were furrowed and he looked annoyed.
- What about the brother? John intervened.
It was a gift, I have another one as well, Sherlock shrugged his shoulders and put the book back.
“In short yes.” Sherlock waited as John composed himself. Soon he could feel something wet pressing against his back. He hissed as it stinged in his opened wounds. *
"He is, but I think I should take it up with him in person instead of talking to you. Your brother seems old enough to fend for himself." Mr Holmes turned around with a knowing smile on his lips but didn’t in any other way acknowledge that John remained standing.
- There are 365 days to a year, they have the surveillance on 24 hours every day. 24 times 365 is 8760. Times three because we have three surveillance cameras, that’s 26280 hours. Johns head was spinning a bit from the numbers.
What did you do then? Is the student expelled without an explanation?
Sorry, he said, clenched his hands at his sides. He could still feel Sherlock’s skin under his fingers, he ached to touch him again. All his resolution was gone.
You like me?
Yes, I was just passing the time. Sherlock took the violin and put it back in his case. He turned around and looked at John. There was a brief moment when none of them spoke.
If you put it that way it sounds really bad but yeah. Sherlock’s brother seems to have some bureaucratic superpowers. And I’m not sure I would have expelled him any way. It was partly my fault, I gave him my card. John felt he was making a bad job out of explaining his thoughts the last couple of days.
You have no fault in this. I’m the one who’s sic, I’m the one who should know my boundaries and keep them. I’m clearly not well enough to start seeing someone. I’m sorry, I truly am but we can’t continue seeing each other more than these classes. Sherlock stared at him in silence.
“Don’t play stupid Sherlock it doesn’t suit you” Sherlock straightened up, preparing for a new fight.
- I was wondering if you would like to go on a date with me? John felt silly, like he was fifteen years old. But after much consideration he had come up with the date-idea. It was either that or ambushing Sherlock and surprising him with a kiss. And that could set things in motion that John wasn’t prepared for.
John didn’t know why he was so angry with Sherlock but he was. He was more than angry, he was infuriating. What kind of game was he playing? John wanted no part of it. He felt like he had been tested and he didn’t know if he had passed the test or failed miserably. Sherlock was his normal self (as normal as he could be when faking to be John's boyfriend), but he called for a cab quit early on to Johns relief.
- Yeah, you know: food, drink, talk, candles at the table, maybe a kiss at the end if the date is going well. John felt he was talking too much and too fast but he really wanted Sherlock to say yes.
“That was the point.” Tears were rising in Sherlock’s eyes. He hadn’t cried in front of someone in over two decades and wasn’t going to start in front of this John-copy. He turned around and walked back into the hallway, trying to get his breath back. He felt bile rising in the back of his throat.
Yes, Sherlock said simply. John looked at him, trying to get him to elaborate but he wouldn’t budge.
Sure I do but I didn’t think you wanted to. John hid his face in his hands.
He wondered if Sherlock had read all the books he owned, there were a lot of them. Sherlock walked out into the kitchen, out of sight of John.
You are the most stubborn person I’ve ever met. Why won’t you listen? Sherlock’s voice rose at the end of the sentence. He walked two steps towards John before he stopped himself.
- Is this okay? he whispered, John could feel his breath on his face. He swallowed
“Lestrade took my gun. I would have succeeded if he hadn’t meddled in things he shouldn't have.” Sherlock felt the room spin and his knees grow weak. He tried closing his eyes but that made everything worse. The only thing he could see was John putting his gun in his mouth, his head exploding, Johns blood on the walls. He felt nauseated.
Using? Sherlock stopped and actually looked a bit embarrassed.
- Sentiment, he said. Almost spitting out the word. John raised his eyebrows in a question. Sherlock took a deep breath then continued in a voice void of almost all emotion.
“You… how?” Sherlock smiled again. Nice of John to ask the important questions at once.
- Is this part of the act? he asked, nervous about the answer. Was this one of Sherlock’s mind games, was someone watching them and he was playing his part, of was this the real Sherlock?
Why did you need those livers anyway? John asked looking up from his computer.
- Is that a promise? He asked. Then rose and planted a kiss on John’s lips.
“What happened?” John questioned, still looking a little apprehensive.
“Rosie. What’s the matter?”, her Pa asked almost immediately.
“Are we ever going to see the back of him?”, Sherlock huffed, so only John could hear.
"That's true.", John said, throwing Sherlock a wink, which caused him to blush wildly, before clearing his throat. John loved the effect he had on his husband, still, after the many years. He found it adorable that Sherlock still acted like an innocent virgin. John, and a lot of other people too, knew Sherlock was far from that now.
“You’re welcome, love. I know you needed it.”
“Oh my God…”, Greg let out, running after Sherlock.
Everything went quiet for a moment, and Sherlock stood up, watching the musical director keenly, for his cue. Sherlock hadn’t said anything about a solo, but he was definitely stood, playing on his own, to thousands in the Royal Albert Hall. John felt a swell of pride in his chest, and tears threatened to escape down his cheeks. He glanced at Rosie, who was sat, in awe, with her mouth wide open. It was clear that she would be bragging about this to her friends for years to come. Not only was her Papa the world’s only consulting detective, but he had also played a solo at the Royal Albert Hall, during the proms. She was astonished. Mrs Hudson was openly crying, by the end of it, and even Mycroft was wiping away a stray tear. Sherlock finished the piece with a flourish, before looking directly at the box they were sat in. He blew them a kiss, with a smile, and then sat down again. The members of the orchestra around him were also clapping. The woman sat directly next to him placed a quick squeeze to his shoulder and Sherlock gave her a genuine smile. John knew how lucky he was to have such a husband. He was beyond in love with him. And so was his daughter. She had jumped onto her feet to clap for her Papa’s solo, with tears running down her face.
“In that case, I’ll make sure they can have her. Although, due to the new development in our relationship, they will be probably all too eager to let us go on a ‘date’ of sorts.”, Sherlock also smirked, before leaning over and capturing John’s lips softly. John moaned soft in content, before he pulled away and the pair began to get ready for the day.
“Go on, Molls.”, John replied.
“Yes, sweet. We don’t have room for them at home, unfortunately.”, Molly explained.
Sherlock had stayed unusually quiet throughout the whole conversation. He just stood and sobbed.
“Has something happened?”, her Dad added.
“You know, when I was your age, I was bullied for being clever too. In fact, I am still bullied now for it. But I have your Dad, and he believes that I am amazing. Rosie… You are clever. You are smart. You are beautiful. You are kind. You are caring… Promise me you’ll not change just because other, small-minded people, tell you to. You are not a freak, little bee. You are a star, yeah?”, Sherlock said.
It only took two minutes to inform the Browns of their plan to use the library, which they agreed to, mainly because it gave Mrs Brown some peace of mind that they would have something to do whilst they waited. They then said their goodbyes, with promises of their return at 8am on Thursday morning.
Tea was served and, still, Sherlock did not leave John’s side. They sat together on one of the sofas, with Sherlock wrapping his arm around John’s shoulder and pulling him close. He placed a kiss on John's temple and John smiled widely, not being able to hold it in.
“Of course, you do, Mycroft. It has the word pie in it.”, Sherlock joked, causing them all to start chuckling uncontrollably and almost hysterically. It shouldn’t have been that funny, but they were all feeling the effects of the loss of adrenaline after another case solved and a confession in the bag.
“I don’t know how you do it, Sherlock. I am so bloody tired.”
"We need milk. Watch Rosie?"
“Well, I just thought you should know.”, Greg told her, with a smile.
“You said you liked my Lady Bracknell, Sherlock… I am quite offended.”, Mycroft joked.
"I want to wear my flashing shoes, Daddy."
"I know... That's what I said.", John chuckled, as he came into the kitchen, to make another cup of tea.
Rosie was up first the next morning, as was usual. She climbed out of her bed, in her own room, which Uncle Mycroft had made she sure she had, specially, and made her way out onto the landing. She opened the door, of the room next to her own, to find her Uncles asleep. Her Uncle Greg was lay on his back and her Uncle Mycroft had his head resting on the chest of his partner, their arms wrapped around each other. Just as quietly as she had entered, Rosie left the room and tried the next one. There she found her Auntie Molly, curled up on her side, snuggled deep into her duvet. She left her Auntie Molly, too, before trying the last door, which she knew wasn’t the bathroom, knowing it would be her Fathers room.
- The second thing is that... hm... You got to me. Sherlock opened his eyes and fixed his gaze on
You know this one is outdated right, he said holding up the book for John to see.
I mean..., he said slowly.
“Let me see your arm.” he said, reaching out. But John was faster. He drew back his arm and backed away so he stood with his back against the counter. His reaction told Sherlock what he had seen and his head started spinning. It couldn’t be.
Sure, John said and looked on as Sherlock walked in and closed the door. He stayed by the closed door, keeping the distance between them. The sight made the lump of shame in John’s gut to grow.
That pretty much sums it up yes. There was so much John wanted to ask about, but he didn’t know where to start, or what kind of answers he wanted.
- Are you sure there has been a theft? Could your father not just have sold whatever it is that is missing? Sherlock sounded bored. He was leaning back, arms folded over his chest. Mr Bryce blushed
- I’m feeling a bit sorry that you’ve not been on a date before but I didn’t know that when I asked. Sherlock looked at John for a moment before he nodded, relief flooded John’s body.
“I’ll go check on him. Thanks for your concern.”
“Yes John?”
“How do I look?” Sherlock said, with the most smug tone a pickle had ever produced, although John was sure (read; hoped) the bar was very very low.
A pause. Even though he couldn’t see him, John felt he knew that the pause was because Sherlock was almost ashamed to answer. Almost.
Hesitantly John crouched towards the pickle, “... Sherlock?” This was ridiculous, there was no way-
“Well what?”
“Yes John the floor.”
“Where.”
“That wasn’t so hard was it John. John?”
“No you did not!”
“I was pushing the limits of science John, it was FOR science.”
John nodded, though he wasn’t sure if it was actually a response, it was more likely it was him trying to rearrange whatever brain cells he had left in a way that made this make sense. He gently placed the pillow (and Sherlock) on the table before fishing the mirror from the shopping bag and holding it vaguely over where he knew Sherlock was.
“It’s a little hard to open the door when I can’t get to the door let alone reach the handle John.”
“That’s the spirit John, now grab the glad wrap, no point in contaminating a plate. There’s a scalpel in the utensil draw, or at least that’s where I think I left it.”
“Thank you John, um, the paper towel too if you wouldn’t mind,” Sherlock gestured to himself, “Pickle juice.” He watched as John quickly swiped the paper towel from beside the sink, placing it in his hands with the same gusto as he’d thrown him onto the pillow. He gave a brief nod as a thank you before he began to get the pickle remains off him as best he could. He watched quietly as John debated whether or not to leave the kitchen before he settled on just standing in the doorway with his back to Sherlock.
“What do you want, Oliver? Don’t you think you’ve gone too far now?”, Molly asked, suddenly finding confidence, as if it was Mary who was speaking and not herself.
“Yes. Now, come on… It won’t be so bad.”
“That’s very noble of him.”, John commented.
Even Sherlock understood that taking a one-and-a-half-year-old child to a triple murder scene would potentially scar them for life. Well, he understood that now, after the whole Archie situation from John's wedding had left John shouting at Sherlock for his 'stupidity'.
They wandered around the park for a while, and Rosie was let lose onto the play area, as John and Sherlock sat on a bench close-by, to keep an eye on her.
Just then, a black car pulled up next to them, and Mycroft climbed out.
Joh wandered to the back corner of the lab, which was around the corner from where Molly was working. Sherlock didn’t acknowledge his presence. He simply carried on with whatever it was that he was doing.
The house was gorgeous and even had a garden that Rosie could run around safely in. The little girl was so excited to see so much grass next to the house, what with her only usually being able to run around on the rare occasion that her Dad and Papa took her to the park, or sometimes her Auntie Molly and even, on one more memorable occasion, her Uncle Mycroft (who had even let her share an ice cream and feed the ducks and squirrels). Despite being so young, Rosie was definitely intellectually advanced in years. She could read simple words. And could chat your ear off if you weren’t too careful, usually about what she could see, or what she’d had for dinner, or who she had spent the day with whilst her Fathers were racing around London solving crimes.
“Greg? Why are you out here?”, Mycroft asked. He was wearing a three-piece black suit, with a bow tie. It was clear that he had just left something important to be with his brother.
“Hey, Mol.”, he said, as he passed her.
They got a taxi, which didn’t take that long at all, before getting out near Blackpool tower.
“Does that mean the competition will end? I’ll have to go home too?” John questioned, getting worried again.
“Come on, Rosie! We are going to be late, if you don’t hurry!”
Does he currently have a case on? He doesn’t as he doesn’t take cases around anniversaries and birthdays, so he is there for them… He did finish one two days ago, I think, which will probably be up on Dad’s blog soon. Hey, Dad?”
"I want Paw Patrol."
Inside the building, Rosie was crying, snuggled up to her godmother, who was trying her best not to join on the tears. Rosie had a suspected broken left arm, from what Molly could gather, and a gash to her right cheek.
Not five minutes later, after what seemed like an eternity of silence and Greg’s pacing, Mycroft came into the living room, a tired, worn look on his face. John and Sherlock immediately jumped up off the sofa and Greg stopped pacing.
"Because the dinner is being used as a whole 'meet the parents' dinner."
John picks Rosie up from 221B, after a day at the surgery, and gets a pleasant surprise...
Sherlock has a case at a seaside town and John takes time to explore the area...
“Of course, I love you.”, John smiled a little.
“So, you’re talking to me now then?”, Sherlock said, not looking up.
“It isn’t your fault… Rosie. Now, I’m not angry, sweetheart, but what else did they say?”, Sherlock asked his daughter.
“Thought you’d never ask. I’m shattered.”, John smiled, standing and pulling Sherlock up too. After a small peck to Sherlock’s lips, John then laced his fingers through his mad detective’s and led them up the stairs to bed. The pair changed for sleeping and, once John had taken his tablets and had taken his sling off, the pair climbed into bed and snuggled close, sharing one last kiss before falling asleep, both with smiles on their faces.
“Hi, John. How is Mellie?”, she asked.
“No problem, Mr Watson-Holmes. Let’s take a seat, shall we?”, Mrs Laniston replied, smiling.
“Detective Inspector Lestrade…”, he said, more like a statement than anything else.
Sherlock sighed and braced himself. It was going to end up in a shouting match.
Hope you got home alright. Rosie and I are planning on a walk down the Mile, if you’re up for it? And bring Sherlock – Moll x
On the day of Sherlock and John’s 10
“Er… Dinner? I ate earlier.”, Mycroft commented, trying to regain some decorum.
"Do you love him?", John asked.
“Don’t forget your medication, John.”, Sherlock told him.
“Well, that’s as good as it’s going to get.”, Greg chuckled, as John rolled his eyes (but he was smiling) and Sherlock and Rosie began talking quietly to each other. Mycroft was sat in the same chair he had been sat in the night before, typing ferociously on his laptop and sighing once in a while.
Things are looking dull for Greg, until a certain government official turns up to save him from the downpour...
"You just thanked me without having to be forced to.", John chuckled, causing Sherlock to roll his eyes.
"Er, you're welcome.", Molly smiled.
"So, there is this group... They're taking kids. And then a week after they go missing, they turn up dead, all having been raped post-mortem. Most of them are so mutilated that they can only be identified by their teeth records. There have been seven kids now.", Greg explained.
Sighing, Sherlock picked up the television remote and then proceeded to change the show to Peppa Pig, which was even more drivel than Alvin.
Rosie came running over to her Fathers, shouting, “Dada, Papa!”
"You two. About time.", Molly smiled, making John grin in reply. In truth, John knew how much Sherlock had meant to Molly, and was slightly worried how she'd react when she found out.
“You have a temp of 37.8 degrees Celsius.”, John informed his friend.
“Okay, so… Where are Molly and Rosie?”, Sherlock asked.
When they got back to the house, John was confused to find the lights on downstairs, with it being extremely late, and going on for two in the morning.
“Yes, hello… Sorry about my husband. I’m sure you know of his reputation. He is having an off-day.”, John explained, which caused Rosie to scoff, only to receive a look from Sherlock, which shut her up straight away.
It was the little things that, gradually, turned into dinner dates, which turned into day trips, which then led to weekends away, where they didn't see anything except each other and the four walls of whatever luxury hotel Mycroft had booked for them. And it was beautiful.
They got to the park and walked in a comfortable silence, until Sherlock stopped at a bench, looking towards Buckingham Palace. It didn’t go unnoticed, by John, that it was the same bench they’d sat on all of those years ago, on the case with Bainbridge, the sailor who was being stalked. That made John smile even more.
"Why not... Thai, Chinese or Italian?", Sherlock replied, before John got up off the sofa, to grab a handful of menus and his phone.
“No, Molly… You just saved my little girl’s life. And he was trying to kill you and your unborn child. It was self-defence.”, Sherlock told her, rubbing her back soothingly.
“Don’t go to sleep, John. You’ll feel even worse if you nap and then have to get up. You need to wait it out.”
"And who is Papa?", John asked. Rosie pointed at Sherlock, who immediately froze, the way he had when John had asked him to be his best man.
"Be nice, John. He's only just got used to Doctor Who. We can't expect him to know what Shrek is yet.", Greg chuckled.
“I couldn’t even if I tried, Rosie.”
“I know. I’m sorry.”
"That's Draco Malfoy, Pa. He's cute.", Rosie replied, before blushing, after realising what she had just said.
“What a lovely surprise, Richard, dear… You did not tell us you would be coming.”, Mrs Brown had said, the smiled evident in her voice. Greg and John had shared a look, saying, ‘She is bloody good at that’.
"Yeah, why?"
"Er... I want watch Alvin, Unc Lock.", she replied, grinning madly up at him. Sherlock couldn't help but smile whenever she did that, scolding himself mentally every time afterwards for going soft.
“Okay, so we go and meet them, yes? Catch them up at the house of Smith’s in-laws.”, John asked.
Sherlock didn’t reply, he simply pulled John in for a hungry kiss, their tongues colliding as they shared their love for the first time after their confessions.
They both sang together, “Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away. Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, save it for a rainy day.”
“Sorry, I’ll go.”, he blurted out, before going to leave.
By the end of the message, both men were in tears and were clinging to each other for dear life.
"That's where you're wrong, John. Because I may not know about the actual universe but you are my universe, and I know everything I need to about you.", Sherlock replied.
“Yeah.”
Yes – Mol
"Mmm.", Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes, which set Greg and John off again. It's safe to say, they didn't get much done on the case for a good half an hour after that.
“You’re pacing, love. That screams that you’re not okay.”, John almost chuckled.
"Yes, baby girl.", Sherlock smiled, pulling Rosie into his chest and hugging her.
After their meal, which Sherlock had been acting strange all the way through (which John shrugged off as he was thinking about their recent case), the pair left Angelo’s and began their walk to the park. On their way there, Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist, as was usual when they were walking, and pulled him close. The cold November air bit at John’s cheeks but he was warm with happiness, the smile present on his face.
“OI! Get a room!”, Greg shouted over at the pair, making Sherlock adamant to keep kissing John, with a smile, and John to carry on, also, but also to put his middle finger up at Greg whilst doing so.
Sherlock finds something out about John that, in all the years they had known each other, he would never have guessed...
“Why is Dada sleeping when it is the daytime and the sun is shining, Papa?”, Rosie asked Sherlock.
Sherlock pressed play and Mary appeared on the screen, smiling. A tear ran down John's face at the sight of her and he clung onto Sherlock's hand a little tighter.
At that moment, his phone beeped, and lit up, telling him he had a text:
“I know. I don’t take any of what she says to heart, when she is like this. Are you okay?”
“Harry?” Sherlock asked.
“I love you, John.”
So, you heard that, guys, 5 minutes… Er, what have we got… Can I save the live? Yes. I can do that for you.
"Sherlock... Are you okay?", John asked for the fifth time in as many minutes.
The night of the performance came around. John, Rosie and Mrs Hudson were picked up by Mycroft and Greg, in one of Mycroft’s posh black cars, and they then made their way across London to the Royal Albert Hall. A member of the front of house team met them in the foyer, and led to their box, where there was free champagne, chocolates and Philharmonic merchandise (which the adults were happy to give to Rosie). Mycroft poured the champagne, and John let Rosie try some of his, but she quickly pulled a face that said she didn’t like it, and she stuck to the lemonade she had (which had also been provided free of charge).
“You haven’t done this in a while, have you?”, John asked him.
“It would be a miracle if they lasted until we got back to London.”, Greg thought to himself, before turning back to his book and letting the pair be.
“Of course, I do, you daft man.” John said, with a smile and a chuckle.
John was writhing, and grunting in pain, but asked, “Sherlock… Can you promise me something?”
Mycroft Holmes has a heart after all, and it belongs to a certain member of Scotland Yard...
“I don’t think I can have you so close all of the time, anymore, without doing this…”
“Rosie! 5 minutes and then we’re going…”, her Dad shouted through.
"Sherlock... Please tell me you aren't smoking.", John said, looking hurt.
“What’s all of this?”, John asked with a smile.
“So, boys… Rosie informed us of the reason you didn’t join us for breakfast.”, Molly told them.
There was a knock at the door, after Rosie had been put to bed, so Greg went to answer it, as Sherlock was lay across John, once again, this time his head in his lap instead of his feet. And John absentmindedly played with his curls as he read a book that he’d been wanting to read for ages: Emma by Jane Austen. Greg came back into the living room, followed by another man, who was a similar height to Mycroft and had light brown hair and eyes that seemed to stare straight into John’s soul, which made him feel uncomfortable. Upon seeing the man, Sherlock had bolted up straight and had put distance between himself and John, moving to the other end of the sofa, which made John extremely confused.
“I thought you were attracted to The Woman.”. John told him, looking confused.
Does my Pa wear cologne and if so, which one? I think he does, but I don’t know which one. That’s one of the strangest questions I think I have ever had…
"Dad? Can we watch Harry Potter?", Rosie asked John, on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The boys didn't have a case on, and Rosie, who was 6, had finished all of her homework for that week (including a model of an animal cell).
"What?", Sherlock asked, looking confused.
It started when John met Claire. She was nice, and kind, and had lovely curves. Even Sherlock, as a gay man, could appreciate she was beautiful. They met at a conference and hit it off, right away. And then, within months, John was gone. His daughter with him. After all, why would Rosie need her Papa Sherlock anymore, when she had a new mother on the scene?
"Hey, little bee. How was school today?", Sherlock asked, letting go of John and picking Rosie up, placing her on his hip. It did help, massively, that they had decided to co-parent, and that Rosie called him Pa.
Upon arriving, it was all systems go. Mycroft and John stood in the viewing space, just off the interview room of Richard Smith, as he bullshitted about how it had all been Perry and how he was a victim of circumstance as he was easily manipulated. Mycroft watched with a perfect poker face, which John figured he would need in his line of work, but John found himself getting extremely annoyed. Sherlock, after about 40 minutes, brought up the fact that John had been stabbed and Smith, once again, tried to claim innocence and say that John was the one who had pulled the knife on him, and he had accidentally stabbed him whilst trying to tackle it off him.
“At least 10 minutes. If they think we’re onto them, they’ll expect to be ambushed within the first five minutes upon their arrival. We have to let them think they’ve won and then jump out at them when they least expect it.”, Sherlock said.
"You don't mean..."
“Thanks, Mycroft.”, John replied.
"Erm... Are you sure? They're really sour."
Rosie's bottom lip then began to wobble, in an attempt to get her own way by making a scene, and crying.
By all accounts, it was just another normal day in 221B Baker Street. With it being a weekday, the now 5 year old Rosie Watson was at school. John was doing some online banking (sorting out the movement of money into his and Sherlock's accounts from the payments they had received from private clients). Sherlock seemed to be doing some sort of experiment, but John hadn't been paying attention to his babbling. Sometimes, he could go out for hours, and come back, and Sherlock would still be babbling. It was quite comforting. And he had missed the constant stream of nonsense when he had been with Mary. Mary spoke quite a lot but it was always succinct and always needed an answer or an affirmation. John was actually fond of the babbling.
“Did she now?”, Sherlock asked, giving Rosie a mock-stern stare, causing her to giggle and for her to hide behind her Auntie Molly with a grin.
One day, Sherlock was stood at the window, half hanging out of it as he smoked, when John turned up. He was on his own.
January 2021:
That left John sat in his armchair, feeling empty and full at the same time, as tears rolled down his face. They had wasted years by not confessing to each other and John felt like he had now missed his chance with Sherlock. He just hoped he hadn't.
However, Mycroft Holmes found all these things to be a welcome distraction from his work. And he was more than grateful, those few years later, when he knew he was going home to a husband who loved and cared for his brother as much as he did. And it didn't hurt that he found his husband a little too hot for public consumption and, with his husband being an officer of the law, he didn't want to commit an act of public indecency, did he? That would never do.
“No, don’t let go just yet.” Sherlock pleaded. John nodded, before placing a kiss in Sherlock’s hair and bringing one hand up to stroke at his curls.
“You haven’t called me that in ages.”
“This will be resumed at the earliest convenience.”, Sherlock said quickly, before running into action, leaving John to pull himself together for a moment, before joining the case once again, with a smile on his face.
The next few moments seemed to happen in slow motion. They were stood at a crossing, waiting for the green man to show, when a motor bike veered off the road, straight into Sherlock, nearly dragging Rosie with him. Luckily, he had managed to push her out of the way. Knowing she was only a street away from the surgery, she ran as fast as she could, as tears streamed down her face.
Whilst everyone ate dinner, Greg, Mycroft and Molly chose to ignore the presence of Sherlock’s hand on John’s thigh. When Sherlock had first put his hand there, John had flinched a little bit but soon settled, despite the pinkness of his cheeks. They ate and chatted, and Rosie was happily telling the group about the inactive volcano she had seen earlier in the day. Everything finally seemed to be fine, in John’s eyes, but of course, that didn’t last for as long as he’d hoped.
“The day started alright. We went to the Capital and walked around a bit. Of course, people began to notice. I mean, she is known, what with her mediocre acting career, and I am the Prince. People know who we are. We started getting a lot of attention. Then the press showed up. As you know, the press aren’t allowed to be involved in the ceremony, as they just cause issues. Irene then decided that it would be a good time to kiss me. So, she kissed me, in front of all of the flashing cameras. I was in shock. I didn’t kiss her back. I simply stood there, rock solid and unmoving. She then dragged me into a shop, where they weren’t allowed to follow and tried to kiss me again. Except, I refused her. I couldn’t quite believe she had stooped so low. We got into a pretty heated argument, where she ended up pulling a whip from one of the displays and started to hit me with it. She was so angry, John. There was fire in her eyes and she was shouting. And I was scared. I have never been scared of anything like that before. I thought she was going to kill me. Of course, being in public, there were people standing around us with their phones out, until a woman pulled her off me, shouting at everyone for not making sense. She was so angry, John. Irene, that is. This other woman was angry too, but helped me up and asked if I was okay. I nodded and told her I was fine. And then my security team managed to get through the crowd and carried me off into one of the cars.
Pacing. He was pacing from the kitchen, right past John, to his chair, and back again. It was doing John's head in. Sherlock had just finished a case, a little over two hours before, and was already huffing and complaining because he didn't have another. John was trying to do some online shopping, in light that he had very little clothing, due to Sherlock using it in his experiments to test different materials. Sherlock huffed, as he passed John, and that was the final straw.
“What’s happening?”, Rosie asked.
“Sherlock… I wasn’t expecting you today. Where’s John?”, Molly asked.
“Well, Mummy rang and said something about a carnival, near their house, if we wanted to travel down? She said we can stay the night. Thought Rosie might enjoy it.”
“I’ve not finished, Dada. Alkali metals: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Alkaline earth metals: beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. I’m finished now, Dada. You can clap if you like.”, Rosie grinned.
"But you promised you wouldn't."
“I’m starting to think that taking her on a ballet day was a bad idea.”, Sherlock muttered to his husband, causing John to chuckle.
“I broke up with her because I realised that if continue to ignore how we feel about each other then we’re not going to get anywhere.”
“There you have it, guys… A new case should be up by the end of next week…
“Sherlock, we live in London, which is always full of tourists. And, I think we could take Rosie with us. It’d be nice to get away for a bit as a family. It’d be nice. We could make a thing out of it.”, John said.
"Wow, love... You might want to take it a bit easier. You'll be having us all trying to play Quidditch next.", John chuckled.
When he re-entered the kitchen, Molly had finished talking and Mycroft was recalling some story, or other, and Greg smiled at John, who realised that the smile meant he had some good news, and that Molly had been right.
“Can we sing our song?”, Rosie asked Molly, which surprised her a little. It had been something that Molly used to do when Rosie was very small – sing to her.
“Horsforth, just outside of Leeds… I’ll get onto it now. Ask if there have been any sexual harassment claims. There is a university in that area, as well as there being more in the centre of Leeds. There were a few break-ins in that area, I know that much from the report. I’ll be back in a minute.”, Greg informed them as he went out into the garden to phone around and get more information on their new theory (well, Molly’s new theory).
“So, Rosie-bear… When can we meet her?”, John asked.
That morning, he had woken up to an empty flat. The night before, he and John had an argument, and Sherlock was petrified as to their future friendship. Sherlock didn’t need to ask to know that John had taken off, when he had stormed out of the flat, to the flat of his latest girlfriend. Sherlock had simply huffed, plonked himself onto the sofa and not moved until the Lestrade had text him the next morning.
Sherlock showed up, with Rosie settled nicely in her pram, at exactly the moment he finished with his last patient. John smiled and made his way over to them, placing a kiss to Rosie’s forehead and stealing a kiss from Sherlock’s lips (which caused the detective to blush profusely). They then made their way home and, as promised, Sherlock placed a kiss on John’s forehead, once he had changed into his pyjamas and took care of Rosie whilst John went to bed. 5 hours later, when Sherlock joined him, John didn’t even stir. He slept straight through to the next day, when he was woken by soft kisses peppering his neck, just the way he liked.
"Sherlock is my brother, John. Whilst he was away, for those two years, he asked me to keep an eye on you. He even risked his undercover mission and life to meet me in Berlin, where I had a picture of you for him, upon his request. Your daughter already calls him Papa. She knows, and she isn't even two years old yet, so why are you two so oblivious to it?"
“Auntie Molly?”, the girl asked her godmother.
"Sherlock... Don't you think that after the year we have had, as a family, that this needs to occur?"
“Brilliant. So, if you talk to your husband and then send me message? You have my number, yes?”
“Okay!”, she shouted back, before sighing. She knew her Pa would know something was up with her as soon as she went downstairs, so she pocketed her phone, took a deep breath and then made her way downstairs.
Once they had got home, and Rosie had changed out of her uniform, Sherlock called her over to him.
"Well, then... I think that someone had tipped off people about a wealthy house, which would possibly have cash in it, and they have gone in, realised that isn't the case, have panicked and have acted accordingly. The daughter and the mother will have been tied up first, to give the father a chance to cough up. When they realised he couldn't, they were too deep into it so shot the lot of them, and then the daughter was raped post mortem. That's the only explanation with all the facts and evidence we have. We're looking for someone from out of town, possibly with criminal connections, and possibly recently released from prison themselves. There has to have been more than one person, but no more than three."
“Come on, love… Mycroft won’t keep us in the dark for much longer. We’ll be okay. We’ll get through it.”, John said, pulling Sherlock onto the sofa, and pulling him in close, so that Sherlock ended up curled in a ball, his head resting on John’s shoulder.
“She was?”, John exclaimed, even more surprised.
The next morning, everything was back to normal. John woke up to the sound of Rosie calling him, and smiled, after remembering the night before. He soon stopped smiling, however, and started panicking, scared as to how Sherlock would be with him.
"Let's go to bed... It's been a long few days. I just want to lie down and hold you close.", John said, pulling away and standing up.
"I'm sorry, Mr Holmes... She just keeps asking for her Papa.", the woman explained.
“Of sorts.”
"Yes, I do mean. Don't worry. It nauseates me too."
“Oh…”, Sherlock grinned.
“John.”
The smell that hit the boys, as they entered the house, was a welcome one, and caused even Sherlock’s stomach to grumble in anticipation of food.
"Yes. Works every time.", John replied.
“We’re going on holiday, Rosie. Me, you, Papa and Auntie Molly. Uncle Greg will be there too. And Uncle Myc might even come.”, John told the toddler.
“If Rosie isn’t careful with her cast, I’ll end up with a bust nose.”, Sherlock replied.
John got up to make a pot of tea, leaving the others in the sitting room. As he put the kettle on to boil, Mycroft entered the kitchen, and lingered by the door to the stairs.
“Then why is it my fault? I was nicer to this one.”
Mycroft immediately aided his brother towards the injured man just as the paramedics were tending to John.
“Hi, love.”, John smiled, before greeting Sherlock with a kiss.
"Of course, I can. I would love to.", Sherlock smiled, feeling his heart swell that he had been asked for help on something that meant so much to Rosie.
“Rosie. Do not talk to your Dad like that.”
“What was that for?”, he asked John.
“He is my ex-boyfriend, John.”, Sherlock said, with a shaky breath, examining John’s face for his reaction.
"Who brought Sherbet Lemons into the flat?", Sherlock asked, scowling.
The week, by all accounts, was a success, even if there were a few touch and go moments between the brothers. However, each had their partner to pull them away or rein them in a little, when needed. Rosie loved spending the week with her Grandparents and Uncle Greg, who was already her favourite Uncle. Rosie went up by millions of miles, in her love for him, it seemed. Greg had been a star, armed with a bucket and spade, and dressed in his long swimming trunks and an old t-shirt, as they played on the beach. One more memorable moment, which had been caught on camera, was when Greg and Rosie had buried Mycroft’s feet whilst he slept in the sun. Sherlock was never going to let him forget it, that’s for sure. And a copy of that picture, where Mycroft was still asleep, buried under the sand, and Rosie was stood next to him, with her spade, and a massive grin on her face, found itself a space on Greg’s office desk at the Yard.
“Well, Greg… I must admit. That is genius.”, Sherlock told him.
"It is much appreciated, John. Goodbye."
"Okay. Okay...", Sherlock smiled a little, calming down a bit.
"No, Rosie. You'll ruin them. You either put your wellies on or we don't go to the park at all.", John told her.
John helps Sherlock with an experiment...
"Seriously?! But that's primary school stuff.", Kitty said, shocked.
“They said that Mum was dead because she escaped from having to put up with me and that I am going to go to hell, with you both, because you’re both wrong. I didn’t want to worry you.”, Rosie explained.
“And I apologise, but myself and my friend here, Perry, need your help, if you could.”, he pleaded, which sounded genuine.
"That's why I'm here... I want to thank you, William."
“You know, what, Greg… I haven’t actually seen Mycroft drive since I was about 14. He came home from Uni in a banged-up Ford capris… He took me for a drive.”, Sherlock told the Detective Inspector.
“Oh, really?”, John asked.
Rosie just grinned before running out of the kitchen door to the garden, Bilbo, her hedgehog, in tow as she sang happily to herself.
“Really?”, John asked.
"What happened?", Sherlock questioned, not letting go.
“You may be, but John isn’t.”, Oliver smirked, causing Sherlock to place his hand on John’s knee and squeeze, which seemed to come as a comfort to him, as he glared at Oliver too.
“So, you’ve said… I think you need to apologise to your Dad too, now, don’t you?”, Sherlock asked, as Rosie sat up. She nodded a little before climbing off his lap and going to stand in front of John, who was sat in his armchair.
"This case, John, it's... I can't even begin to describe how sick these bastards are.", Greg sighed, sitting on the sofa, burying his head in his hands.
“She really did that? Well done, Rosie… I am so proud.”, Sherlock said, picking Rosie up and spinning her around.
“Not really.”, Sherlock replied, smirking a little before placing his hands under his chin and going into his mind palace. Rolling his eyes, John moved Sherlock’s feet so he was more comfortable and then continued to browse on his laptop.
Life in Baker Street was perfect, and Sherlock found that he could work on a case and look after and teach Rosie at the same time. She was fascinating to him. Just the way that she looked at the whole world with wonder, as though everything was amazing. Of course, Sherlock knew the harsh reality, and that was not the case, but it inspired him to look for the best in people, rather than the worst.
Sherlock gets a cold and John deals with his dramatic arse...
The sight he found upon entry to the flat was not on he had ever expected to see. For one, Rosie was asleep, which he even found difficult to achieve. Sherlock was sat on the sofa, slumped slighty, snoring quietly, with a certain Molly Hooper, also asleep, sat next to him, curled up into his side, with her head resting on his shoulder. Rosie was lay across both of her godparents, with her head on Molly's lap and her legs splayed across Sherlock's lap. Not wanting to spoil the quiet, John just stood in the doorway, watching the tranquillity, and smiled. He even took a picture and sent it to Lestrade, for good measure. The good thing about sending it to Lestrade meant that Mycroft would also see it. Ever since Lestrade's promise to keep an eye on Mycroft, after Eurus, to Sherlock, the two men seemed to never be out of each other's company. And, although they didn't tell anyone, even John had noticed them holding hands under the table at a dinner at the Holmes', which had been attended by John, Rosie, Molly and Sherlock, as well as Lestrade and Mycroft.
