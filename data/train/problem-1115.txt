Sebastian nodded. "I can't help it Jimmy. There are days when I don't see his leering face at all, hear that sleazy voice saying all those horrible things, and then all of a sudden, I start thinking, remembering..."
and he has to have him...my other brother? I don't know where Mycroft is, he's probably skulking around brooding somewhere. Yes, I want you here. Can you come over? Two hours? Wonderful. I'll see you soon...I can't wait. I have so many games and treats planned for us."
By the time the Watson-Holmes family had settled into their cozy room, the rain turned heavier again. Nobody mattered, as everyone was asleep, Sherlock and John cuddled together while Rosie was snuggled under the sheets of her twin bed, dreaming of bees flying around a garden of white roses and yellow carnations, pollinating the blooms to the tune of "Closing Time."
He cleared his throat and continued. "After some disturbing incidents involving the Holmes children, Pete wanted to get some parents together to talk about protecting our own kids. We have Officer Morstan here representing the police in case you have questions regarding law enforcement matters."
Seconds later, a pounding disco beat paired with synth sounds could be heard. Sherlock frowned and turned towards Irene, who just shrugged.
As the two were getting dressed, a figure dressed all in black stood behind some trees and watched with a cruel smirk on his face. A scalpel was tucked neatly inside the back pocket of his pants. He'd seen the car pull up and park and he knew exactly who they were and why they were here. But it wasn't their time yet. He was on another mission, one that would send the citizens of Sherrinford even further into despair.
"I don't like it either honey, but I hate seeing him like this. If it's just for a few minutes, then he'll feel better and we can all move on."
As the boys continued to make plans and tease each other, Susan Powers stood at the top of the basement stairs, listening to everything, and a devilish gleam flashed in her eyes. Smirking, she left and headed towards the phone in the kitchen.
Sherlock sat inside the car in the community center parking lot. It wasn't that long ago that he left his house, confident about making his entrance in the sock hop, but now he was beginning to feel hesitant, and his stomach began to feel like it was full of knots. But he had to see John. He was worth the risk.
More cheers erupted at hearing Billy's name. The young DJ had quickly become very popular with Sherrinford's teenagers.
Next on the list was theme. Sherlock had some ideas for their wedding. He loved bees, and wanted to incorporate them into their wedding. John loved spring and gardening, and he was growing some plants and flowers on the roof of their flat to make it look more inviting. The two compromised and decided on a spring garden theme with a focus on bees.
John gave him his best 'what the fuck look.' "Seriously Sherlock? Three kids have been murdered and a married father is visiting gay male hookers on the side, and that's your reaction? You're unbelievable."
"Actually John I wouldn't be averse to some television tonight. Molly told me there's a Hitchcock marathon on. How does that sound?"
Veronica turned around and saw Eurus standing there, rubbing her eyes. Suddenly, she was filled with rage. She didn't see her youngest child of fifteen dressed in a pink cotton nightgown, pale and miserable from being sick. She saw a psychopath, a killer. She was no better than the maniac on the loose murdering innocent people.
John wanted that very much, but if Sherlock was avoiding him, maybe it would be best if he left things as they were.
But now he had gone and fallen in love, and he was terrified. Not only terrified of trying to deal with his new explosive feelings for John, but terrified that his sister would lash out and someone else---maybe even him---would end up six feet under.
Sherlock smirked and chewed his piece of cake. It was scrumptious. He let out a small moan of appreciation, and John's eyes bugged out even more.
The knock at the door startled John for a moment, he wasn't expecting any visitors. Evie was in her highchair, feeding herself peas from a small plastic bowl. He made sure his daughter was secure and went to the door. "Who is it?" he called out, trying to sound firm and forceful.
Janine is having a slumber party. Carl Powers and his friends weren't invited but they still want to come anyway. Sherlock is back in Sherrinford and missing John, who is still in LA and gets some surprise visitors.
"Sounds good Sherlock. We'll wrap it up here and have the body transported to the morgue for autopsy. Thanks for your help, and thanks John for remoting in. Hope you feel better."
The two poured over wedding websites, picking out the pros and cons of each site. Eventually, they agreed on having their wedding at RSA House, which catered to smaller groups. It was also in central London, which both men loved, as neither wanted to travel far for the ceremony. They booked a tour, and were extremely impressed with the different spaces to hold a wedding and reception. Sherlock fell in love with an area called The Vaults, which were originally used as wine cellars. He loved the architecture and the lighting. John loved seeing his genius so happy and excited, and he also thought it was a cool place to get married. Especially since Mary would have sneered at a place like this.
Warren nodded. "Not combat though. He worked in the kitchen. He's an excellent cook. He would make us meals dressed in fatigues and it was a major turn on for me. One of the reasons I actively pursued him was because he had been in the military. Ever since I was fourteen, seeing a man in camouflage turned me on. They represented protection and security to me. My childhood was pretty abusive, and I felt I had no one to turn to."
"Me too. But then I saw lights on across the street and I wasn't worried anymore." Sarah motioned for John to leave his room. "Come on out to the lobby, there's more light out there. I definitely need to get a generator for this place."
“No!” he exclaimed. I broke up with Irene because I want to date you! I want you to be my girl Molly.”
“You’re picturing him fighting right now, aren’t you? Wanting to see if he can beat The Captain?” Irene playfully teased, her red lips in a full smirk.
"I can make you feel really good if you come back to bed. Why did you leave in the first place?" Sherlock said.
John decided his business email would be captainjohn@leatherandlace.com.uk. It wasn't overtly sexy, and it would be easy for clients to remember.
But before Harold could tell him who had attacked him, he blacked out, in true movie cliffhanger fashion. The doctors had put him under sedation, and he would be for a few more days.
Sherlock smirked and rubbed his hands together. This was going to be fun. "You don't have to tell me anything. I know you're former military due to your haircut - you could choose to grow it out but you're used to regulation length so you keep it that way. Before I came over to you, you reached up and self-consciously touched your left shoulder - so more than likely discharged due to an injury there, gunshot wound. You didn't come alone, but with a friend who is omega, as you have a faint trace of his scent on you, but he found an alpha that's trustworthy so you didn't have a problem leaving him and you're content to be by yourself. You don't own any pets, there's no scent of any other animals on you. You have a callous on your right middle finger caused by extensive writing, you must have kept a journal while you were in the military. The watch you're wearing looks masculine but is actually a woman's, it has a smaller face. Since you're in a gay club, it's not from a girlfriend, so either a sister or female friend."
Sherlock shook his head. "No, it's not the wind, the air's been still all evening. Someone's out there."
"Sherlock's older brother showed up at Molly's house and she agreed to talk to him, but he made her uncomfortable, so Pete and Sylvia asked him to leave, and he did. Pete's worried that he'll try and hurt Molly like Sherlock did with you. So he organized a meeting. It's going to be talking about how to protect the kids, and Officer Morstan is coming too. "
Sherlock held him tight and kissed his hair. "Well, the time to stop feeling low begins now. We have this delicious dinner to eat, and later, I'm going to prepare us a nice, warm bubble bath. Then I'm going to lay you down in our bed and worship every inch of you, as you should be." He gently caressed John's swollen belly. "You're carrying precious cargo in there, and doing an excellent job taking care of little Hudson Holmes-Watson."
John's excitement was on the verge of bubbling over as he turned to see his husband. He saw the bee pin and beamed. "Oh Sherlock, it looks smashing on you. I hope you like it."
Suddenly the dancer turned and threw his helmet towards Sherlock, who immediately threw his arms up to catch it. Sherlock was sure he saw a little devious grin on John's face.
Lunch passed quickly and pleasantly, and John retired to the library for his free period. His plans were to do his history homework and compile a to-do list preparing for he and his mother's move to their new apartment.
He looked around, taking in the sights of happy families and couples enjoying the sunshine. A few kids were making sandcastles. Many were in the water, cooling themselves off. It wasn't blazing hot, but it was pretty warm.
"Believe me I won't, but if it continues to be hot like this, I'd invest in some summer weight bespoke suits," Greg told him.
"It's a match made in heaven. He's a soldier's son, she's a cop's daughter, they're both tough as nails---honestly, it should have happened ages ago," Janine had said. I heard Little Seb's dad was over the moon, and Mary's parents said she couldn't do any worse."
John was caught off guard for a moment at hearing the deep British baritone, but he quickly composed himself and easily pried the taller boy off of him. Playing football certainly had its benefits. John spun around, nostrils flaring, anger spreading over his body. “Don’t you ever touch me again, you freak!” he spat. With one last murderous look, he turned on his heel and went back inside the roller rink.
Sherlock placated his boyfriend with a gentle kiss on the lips. "Yes I do, and I'll eat some tomorrow, I promise."
The two ended their conversation. John let out another yawn and decided to head to bed for a nap. He didn't want to go out and be tired.
"That's good to hear. I know you were missing that extra money," Wanda said, stirring a pot on the stove.
It was two hours to closing time and there weren't many shoppers out in the streets, most of them were done for the day and were probably already safe and dry indoors. It had been a busy Saturday and John had sold quite a few items for the upscale customers. He was surprised he'd even gotten the job in the first place. The shops on Jermyn Street catered to wealthy Londoners with a taste for expensive, custom, bespoke clothing along with fine art and jewelry. He wasn't posh by any means, and he thought only the best looking and the best tailored would be hired to sell shirts that cost more than two weeks' worth of grocery shopping at Tesco. But he was surprised when the store manager hired him. The manager said he liked John's appearance, he looked trustworthy, and he was impressed with him winning a rugby scholarship to St. Bart's so he could pursue his dream of being a doctor. And John was also a master at gift wrapping, with many customers expressing their delight and satisfaction at John's handiwork.
"That sounds lovely. I really should cook a meal, but I'm beat." She reached into her purse and handed John a twenty dollar bill, which he tried to refuse. "No Mom, I have some money, I can buy dinner. Please?"
John smiled sadly and sat down next to Sherlock. "I didn't feel you'd appreciate them, being 'naughty pictures.' I know you have first class taste."
Wanda nodded. "He's really in a mood. He's so upset about Sherlock, and feels he's responsible." Wanda looked sharply at her daughter. "Maybe we should let him see Sherlock."
Mycroft charged towards her and grabbed her shoulders. "You know where he is. This is no time to be cryptic and obtuse little sister. If you know where Sherlock is, you better spit it out."
"Do you think he's still even in Sherrinford?" I don't even want to think about him hiding in someone's backyard, waiting to strike." Wanda shuddered at the thought.
Sherlock watched John put the pieces together. He grew tingly seeing John's eyebrows furrow, his pink tongue dart out and roll around on those gorgeous lips of his. Sherlock just wanted to push him down and kiss the life out of him. He didn't think John truly knew just how beautiful he was.
When he was out of the room, I watched Sherlock. He had a small, soft smile on his face. Yep, definitely smitten.
"Housecleaning this morning, and then Ellen Chambers and I are heading down to Loki's to do laundry. After that, we're going to grab a bite to eat and then home for the evening."
By the time Sherlock was ready to get up, both boys were soaked to the skin. "You berk," John teased, shaking out his wet hair. "You'll need pliers to get those leather trousers off."
“No John, you can’t. I know you like being the man of the house, taking care of me, and thinking you can handle any situation that comes your way, and I appreciate it so much. When Ham died, I didn’t know what I was going to do. I didn’t want to rely on you, you were only thirteen. But you stepped up. You were strong for both of us. However, you’re just sixteen. You are way too young to be dealing with sexual predators on your own. You should have called the police.”
"Thank you." Then Sherlock was right back to being Mister Business, talking about his boring and useless physics professor, and why did he have to show up for class anyway. John laughed while finishing his cereal, then stood up and kissed Sherlock's curls. "I have to get ready for my lab. You behave yourself today and go to class even though you don't want to. I'll see you later, and I'll make that curry and pea dish you love so much for dinner tonight."
It seemed to take all of John's strength to push Sherlock off of him, but he managed to grab fistfuls of Sherlock's shirt and shake him loose. Sherlock was panting hard, his beautiful face flushed a mix of pink and peach. John was also breathing heavily.
Anthea opened the doors and walked in with Mrs. Watson following her. She was in what appeared to be the library, stacks and stacks of books were neatly arranged on several large bookshelves that went from ceiling to floor. It was decorated in a red and black theme. A chess table was set up in the far right corner. Anthea quietly left the room, leaving the three alone.
Greg gave her a sharp look. "Things are cool between Molly and Mycroft. He leaves her alone and when they talk, it's quick and cordial. So don't try and make something that wasn't there to begin with. You're just pissed that I wasn't devastated by our breakup and I'm dating a so-called nerd. Concentrate on your own life and stop trying to screw with mine."
"When I first heard the news, I was startled to say the least. I mean, his son is a jerk---well used to be---but he seemed so with it," John said.
Greg got up. “I’ve had enough. My love life is none of your business Ms. Holmes. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m getting the hell out of here. I need to be somewhere normal, with normal people.”
"There's a taxi already out front. I'll be home soon. I love you, and I'm glad you're safe. Oh, and the tests on the poison they found on that wine bottle, it turned out to be thallium. Molly was able to find out, she's got a friend at the lab the bottle was sent to who provided her with the results."
“John may be there tonight as well, I know you’re itching to go too. Plus, a few cheeseburgers might do you good, you’re so thin someone could get a paper cut from hugging you, that is, if anyone actually wanted to touch you. Haven’t had much luck since we came to the land of opportunity, have you brother mine?”
"First of all Mrs. Watson, I want to apologize for Sherlock's behavior. He won't come near your son again, I promise," Veronica said firmly.
The last fic for the February Johnlock Prompt is here! It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be! After this, I'm going to take a break from prompts and finish my Love and Snow series so I can begin on a new anthology, Love and Spring. I'm enjoying writing these anthologies - I hope to do a Love and Summer and a Love and Autumn, to complete the whole package.
She smiled."I wanted to let you all know I've barred the Holmeses from The Big H. If any of them show up on my property. I'll call the police," she promised. "You've all been so nice to me, especially knowing what I've been through back in Florida, and I have to return the favor."
Henry broke off the kiss and laughed. "Leave it to you to turn a serious conversation into something sexual."
He blushed slightly. "Sorry. Sherlock had texted me, he was worried. He heard about the bomb threat on his police scanner app. He's also working on those serial poisonings that have been in the news, and I told him about a hunch that those poisonings might be connected with the suspected poisonings at the law office."
Irene laughed. "Well, to quote John Watson, you like who you like. Speaking of John, where's that little dreamboat been?"
He looked down at the floor, feeling sheepish. When he returned John’s glare, he was blushing. “Well, I think she’s really sweet and cute. And she likes to do things that Irene won’t do, like roller skating. I’ve been trying to get Irene down to the Roller-Rama ever since we got together, but she refuses. And she wouldn’t go to the sock hop at the community center, or the beach bonfire...I don’t want to badmouth her, but we’ve been together for a year and a half and I’m starting to think she only wants to be with me because I’m on the football team, like it improves her social status or something. And the way she went on about that Holmes kid...it’s like she forgot that I was there. Molly just seems a lot more sincere. But she’s so shy around other guys, except for you.”
John sat down and leaned back against the tree, closing his eyes, bracing for the confession, wondering if the madness engulfing his town---and his life---would cease and desist.
"I know, and it was mostly because of your meticulous planning. I can't thank you enough," Rosie replied, pressing a kiss to her papa's cheek. She turned to John and gave him a kiss. "And you Dad, you look so dapper in your suit. I think you were made to wear pinstripes and a fedora."
The two made their way to the edge of the rink, and they saw one of the employees, a muscular man in his thirties named Gary, holding two teens on either side of him by the back of their T-shirts. John recognized them as Art Doyle and Marty Freeman. He saw Greg shooting daggers at the two, while holding Molly tightly in his arms.
A rumble of thunder was heard in the distance as Sherlock and John closed the door behind them. "Nothing like a spring storm in a quiet forest," John said. Reminds me of when my dad and I went camping one summer and a dandy of a storm came through. Thought the tent would collapse in the wind but it held on. I was snuggled inside my sleeping bag munching popcorn while Dad told spooky stories."
Before Sherlock realized what he was doing, he leaned in and gently brushed his lips on John's. Then he felt John kissing back, and he felt a big wave of relaxation wash over him. For the first time in quite a while, he felt things were going to be just fine.
He opened the door and quietly walked in. He saw Sherlock was asleep. He looked so peaceful with his eyes closed, and his dark curls were mussed and spread on the white pillowcase.
When John had arrived for their session, Warren was crying.  John immediately approached him, gently asking what was wrong, and Warren had told him he'd heard on the news his ex, Gray, had been murdered.
It was 2:45 when John pulled into The Big H parking lot. There was a break in the rain, but the skies were dark, the winds were whipping through the air, and a huge wall of clouds swirled menacingly in the gray vastness. It wouldn't be long before another storm would come through, drenching Sherrinford once again.
John smiled. “I told Sherlock to back off and he left. I also told him to get Mycroft to leave you alone. We have nothing to worry about.”
John's eyes were closed and he was enjoying the California breeze softly ruffling the air. Then Sherlock spoke.
A few seconds later, Sherlock opened the door, his black raincoat wet from the showers, dark curls slightly sticking up. John thought he looked adorable. Then he saw Sherlock pushing a cooler with a handle attached, and his face scrunched up in curiousness. "What's in the cooler?" John asked.
Her mother Sylvia tried to comfort her. "Now Molly, it's not your fault. You did the right thing not going off with him. You were only protecting yourself."
John skated over to Sherlock, cupping his face and pressing a kiss to his forehead. "Well I do. You're beautiful when you skate. You're beautiful when you walk."
"I love stargazing. Every time I look up into the sky, I dream about going up there one day, seeing and exploring the planets, wondering if there's other life out there." John smiled up at Sherlock. "For now though, I'd rather be on earth, with you."
"Bye Sherlock. Enjoy the rest of your week." John got on his bike and began to ride away. Sherlock soon followed then went in the opposite direction, his mind thinking of nothing but the lovely summer afternoon he spent with the boy he considered his everything.
Mrs. Watson was shocked to finally see the boy who had attacked her son; she was expecting a burly, brawny roughneck, not an impossibly tall, thin, pale child with delicate features. He wore a loose, white button down short sleeved shirt with several buttons undone, showing off his milky white chest, and tan shorts. He left his dark hair ungreased, revealing loose curls on top of his head.
Wanda, Hal, Mrs. Hudson, Molly and her parents, Greg, Mike, and Ella were sitting, waiting with baited breath on news about John's surgery. Harry and Clarence had called the hospital from a payphone to let them know they would be there in another hour or so. Harry had gotten carsick on the way, a side effect of her newly confirmed pregnancy.
"No, but I'm sure I'll find something in our attic. Mom is very sentimental and still has a lot of her old dresses packed away up there from when she used to go to the Friday night dances at the American Legion. They're still in great shape, she told me I could have my pick. "
John finished his write-up. "Go ahead and take a look, I know you'll want to provide your constructive criticism." He grinned and handed Sherlock the laptop.
Janine's house was dark. Carl and the other boys were standing behind tall shrubbery off to the side of the large manor home, all dressed in black. Little Seb Moran even had grease paint on his cheeks and under his eyes. All were confused and wondering what was going on.
Loud and wild applause along with some hoots and hollers punctured the room. Sherrinford and Eurus were among the revelers. Sherlock just watched John's lovely face as he reacted, and couldn't help but smile.
"She was walking down the street, probably home from school. He pulled beside her in his car and was talking to her. I knew he was trying to coax her into getting inside. I saw her say something back, she looked upset. Then he took off like a bat out of hell. He was a pervert and he deserved to die."
Sherlock had also noticed John wasn't his usual chipper, humorous self. While John was grateful for his gifts and was very affectionate with his alpha, Sherlock could tell something was bothering him underneath the surface. He didn't want to press his omega on it, because of John's heightened hormones. He just hoped John would tell him what was wrong.
His client, Owen Haines, was a trust fund kid who had moved to London to work on his masters degree in business administration at Cambridge. His family was from the States, Savannah Georgia, and his father owned and operated a freight company, Haines Shipping. They were looking to expand in England, and Owen jumped at the chance to run the operation over here.
John is laid up due to a bad flare up of arthritis, but with a big snow storm on the way it's not like he could go anywhere, and he's fine with that.
Wanda was at Hal's Gun Shop, perusing a case of small handguns. Hal Auden, a handsome man of forty-four, with strawberry blond hair and emerald green eyes, looked at the widow appreciatively. He'd been attracted to her for some time, but never approached her because she still mourned her late husband. He felt like a fool for approaching her son and basically getting his blessing to ask her out, but was ecstatic that John thought it would be good for his mother to go out with him.
When a dull pain in his left ankle began four days ago, John figured it was due to the approaching snowstorm and that he'd strained it last week while chasing a murder suspect. He put ice on it and took paracetamol and figured it would go away.
Wanda watched fondly as John went into the kitchen and began to make his snack, pleasant memories of she, Ham, John, and Harriet buying their bags of popcorn at the drive- in and watching the latest movies. When she and Ham had a little extra leftover in their paycheck, they would go to the drive-in as a treat. She and her husband would stay in the car while the kids sat in front on a blanket.
"No I won't. I have a very strong rugby player that can easily remove them." Sherlock smirked at him. "After all, you did say you we're going to play Daddy's Little Monster, and I think a monster will have no trouble with a simple pair of leather slacks." He winked and started sauntering away, although a little crooked due to rain-soaked leather.
remember it, and promptly hung up. Principal Saxon remained calm and called the police, and announced over the loudspeaker school was being dismissed early due to an emergency, and for no one to panic, and exit through the closest door. Students were not to go to their lockers, to leave with what they had on them. Staff would exit with students, and once the emergency was dealt with, custodians would lock all doors and make rounds. Any student that rode a bus, if they could walk home or get a ride with a friend, to do that, or walk to the nearest safe location, which was the Big H parking lot, and he and the secretaries would direct the buses to pick children up there.
"Well you two have fun, I better get home. Talk to you later." Mary got off the bed and with a wave, left the room.
Soon there was a knock, and Wanda opened it up. It was Hal, dressed in jeans and a short-sleeved white dress shirt. He carried a bouquet of carnations in colors of red, pink, and white. "Hi Wanda. He presented the flowers to her. "These are for you."
She patted his shoulder and placed a soft kiss on his cheek. "I'm glad you've mended things with John. You've been more relaxed and cheerful this past week and it's good to see."
A few minutes later, the lovely sounds of "Stand By Me" could be heard over the loudspeaker. It made John sit up, turning his head towards the music. It must be a Homecoming announcement.
Enjoy some fluff and mild smut just in time for Valentine's Day. I hope to get chapter two up sometime tomorrow or the day after.
Sherlock harrumphed. "I'm sorry if I'm keeping you from the pub Grant, but if it wasn't for me Arthur Peters would still be on the loose, stealing the jewels of London's precious elite."
"Nothing like that, not yet anyway. But I'm working on a new project. It's about a day in the life of a heart surgeon and with you being a doctor, I'd thought you'd like to see my initial shots."
Sherlock smiled affectionately at him, kissed him back, and led John to the sofa. Why don't you take off your shoes and relax. I'll fix you a cup of tea and order us some takeaway, how's that?"
"Yes, we believe he did that as well. The murders, the fires, all of the threatening phone calls---we suspect it was him, and there were no accomplices."
John gently but firmly pressed the tip of the horn to the head of Warren's shaft. He could see the other man's mouth open in wide O but no sound came out.
John put down his slice of pizza to ruffle Sherlock's loose dark curls. "You look a lot more handsome with curly hair," he murmured.
Mrs. Brealey walked into the room and called the class to attention to get ready to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. All thoughts of the killer were swept aside for now.
“I had one try the same crap you did last year at a Christmas party. Only he wasn’t as lucky as you. I poured beer all over him and threatened to break his nose. When Mom found out, she was livid.”
"Look Sherlock, you need to stop listening to your siblings. No wonder you're so screwed up when it comes to feelings. Listen to your heart."
John awoke and smiled at seeing Sherlock already awake and smiling softly at him. "Good afternoon," Sherlock greeted him, before kissing him gently. "Feel better?"
"Thank you." She daintily knelt down in the cool grass, leaning back and stretching out her denim-clad legs. She glanced at John with a smirk on her face. "I understand Sherlock started telling you about our brother."
"I'd love to doll, but I can't stay overnight. Not yet anyway. I'll come back tomorrow." He kissed her again.
"Yeah, Harry and Clarence have a cute pad. It's not fancy but it's close to everything and down the street from the garage."
Molly taught Year 10, and was one of the first to welcome John to Hiddleston. The two had become fast friends. Year 9 and Year 10 science classrooms had their own wing on the second floor, while Year 11 and Year 12 were on the third. John hadn't met any of those teachers yet, as he pretty much stayed in his classroom. He ate lunch in his room or in the lounge of the academic wing with Greg Lestrade, the varsity rugby team coach. John was considering accepting a coaching position for the junior varsity rugby team. He'd played rugby when he was in secondary and had been pretty good at it.
The two headed to their bedroom, and day clothes were exchanged for comfy pajamas. Just as the two got comfy under the sheets, the baby monitor came alive to the cries of a certain little girl. "Dada! Papa!"
"Yeah, but I shouldn't. I shouldn't even be here. My family was not happy when I insisted I wanted to see you."
John went back to the phone. "Give me your number. I told Mom and Harry it was my friend Mike. I need to hang up and call you from the bedroom. I can't have them knowing it's you."
"Much better. I ran into Bonnie Evans at Leonard's this afternoon. She said you called out of work because John was sick with that horrible bug that's been going around."
Greg had told John he got a friend who called himself a consulting detective who would be undercover at the disco smoking Discopath out. This friend was apparently a brilliant genius, who could tell you your life story by how you comb your hair or a piece of jewelry you wear. "If anyone can catch this jerk, it's Sherlock Holmes," Greg had said.
Chris took John and Rosie into an old bedroom used as a fostering space, and there were seven kittens, in all shades of ginger, zooming around the room. Rosie had her eye on an all orange kitten with subtle stripes that made her look like a tiny tiger. The kittens' mom, a beautiful orange and white cat, lay on a blanket observing her clowder of energetic kits.
The two made some circles while holding hands, exchanging happy smiles with each other. Eventually Sherlock broke away to do some solo skating. John watched him elegantly move around, thinking how beautiful and graceful he was, like a ballet dancer. He wondered if Sherlock ever took dancing lessons.
"Yeah, I know. Before we ended the tutoring session he started talking about Jim, the omega he loves. He got so worked up his scent got really strong. He also invited me to the next swimming meet on Friday, he wants me to meet Jim."
John got in the car and he and his mom took off. Angelo saw the car across the street start up too and head in the same direction. He thought that was weird and a bit spooky. With that crazy murderer on the loose, he couldn't be sure of anything anymore.
John had returned to the cottage, and it had to started to rain. The water felt refreshing on him, and he stood there for a moment just taking the scenery in of the trees swaying in the summer's storm breeze, the fast swirling dark clouds, and the seashore far ahead of him. For a second he wondered what it would be like to feel this every summer.
Sherlock's face fell. He couldn't let anything bad happen to John, his beautiful blond soldier he vowed to protect. He looked down at his lap. "I'm sorry."
Mycroft turned to look at his brother with a sneer. “I would say the same for you and this John Watson. So don’t lecture me when you’re also being a hypocrite, brother mine.” Then he smiled, his icy eyes gleaming. “I did find out from Mrs. Smallwood that my Molly and your John both work at the same place, a drive-in called The Big H. It sounds absolutely pedestrian, but unlike us, they must work for their money.”
John frowned slightly. He needed to know what he could do and couldn't do. "What was he doing that made you uncomfortable? I'd like to know so I won't repeat it. This is all about your pleasure, you're the paying customer."
John snuggled closer to Sherlock. "I'm glad we decided to hang out here this week. "We'll have lots of peace and quiet. Imagine, a week of no Anderson whining about Sally dumping him for Dimmock, no strenuous rugby practices, no boring lectures, no awful pop music being blared in the halls..."
John's a general science teacher, Sherlock teaches chemistry. A nighttime class outing is the perfect setting for these two idiots to make their own chemical reaction.
Sherlock's eyes widened. I could see he was definitely caught off guard by Doctor Watson's remark. I was too. "Hang on Doctor. You mean you're not going to chastise him about trying to play action hero and getting injured?"
The detective followed his curly-headed daughter out into the white marshmallow winterscape, expecting to see imprints of John and Rosie's bodies on the ground. He was not expecting the display shown in the middle of the rooftop.
Unlike Saturday night when Sherlock had him on the floor, he was gentle and tender. Sherlock moved his mouth to John's neck and peppered his golden skin with soft kisses and flicks of his tongue. After a bout of affection, Sherlock broke to gaze at John and he smiled. "You're beautiful."
Carl just stared at Molly, surprised to see such fury coming from a teenage girl. Then surprise turned to shame, and he fell to the ground in a heap and started to cry.
Sebastian was completely numb. He and his father had a great relationship. Richard had supported him, had stood by his side during those difficult times when he'd acted like a reckless pervert, stood up for him when everyone else in town wanted his head. Now he wondered if his behavior caused his father to crack. How else could he try and rationalize what his father had done? And now he was on the run after shooting Jeff Hope.
“I came here to talk to you. Will you just allow me a few minutes?” Mycroft pleaded and on the inside he was shocked at the words coming out of his mouth. He never pleaded. He always ordered.
A new week was here, and John's Monday was going to be a busy one. He'd dropped off Evie at daycare, and after breakfast the bulk of the morning was spent reviewing his bookings and confirming appointments. He also responded to a text from his new friend Raquel, inviting him to lunch with her and her husband Luke. They all were free on Friday afternoon, and plans were set to meet at a coffee shop not far from the lab where John used to work. Raquel explained her husband was not comfortable in upscale restaurants, and the coffee shop was a favorite of his. John was fine with that. His bank account may have gotten larger but that didn't mean four star meals at four star prices all the time.
"Certainly," Sherlock said. John drained the glass than lay back onto the pillows. "That hit the spot."
John shook his head. "Awful. But at least they're caught and now people can breathe easy again. Speaking of breathing easy, did you get my text about the clinic losing power? At first I thought the killer had changed their pattern, but someone deliberately cut off our power, so we were sent home."
He felt a hand clap his shoulder. "Hi Sherlock. How's the surveillance going?" Greg's friendly voice asked.
The April day started off as chilly and sunny, and when Greg and Molly's wedding got underway, the temperature had warmed to a comfortable 61 degrees. It had been a short but sweet and lovely ceremony at St. Margaret's Church in Barking. The structure was a gray stone building that wouldn't look out of place in a medieval fantasy movie. The inside was quaint and elegant, with wooden rafters and whitewashed columns and arches.
He gave himself a final once over, satisfied at his appearance. He wore a light gray sweater over top a pale blue short-sleeved collared shirt, with snug black jeans and his boots, dark hair loose and relaxed. "I'm taking the Aston-Martin. Don't wait up." He gave a knowing grin to his brother and flounced out of the room. Mycroft could only shake his head. This was sure to end in heartbreak for Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at hearing the DJ's puns, despite thinking he had a pleasant voice. He absolutely loathed disco music, and discotheques. The pulsing lights, loud thumping music, vocals that sounded like cats wailing and dogs barking, and people dancing like they were having seizures were a blight on his brain. But he'd promised Greg to be on the lookout for Discopath (an absolutely ridiculous term, the British media were such idiots). Sherlock knew the attacker would strike tonight, and Lestrade's was next, based on a complex pattern he'd mapped out while laying naked on the sofa in his flat (he did his best thinking while wearing nothing but his birthday suit).
"Nah, I don't think so Jimmy. He's got a little girl, and he talked a lot about how violent his dad was when he was younger. He got some pretty bad beatings, and his dad is a homophobe. He's been hurt, just like me."
John saw his mom and smiled, running to meet her. "Hi Mom! How was your day?" He leaned in for a hug.
The TV yule log switched to a countdown and the boys counted down along while sucking their lollies. Once it hit 0 and the clock struck midnight, a fireworks display began to play to Kenny G's rendition of Auld Lang Syne. Sherlock and John shared another kiss, wished each other Happy New Year, and finished their lollies. Then Sherlock got the champagne out of the fridge and poured two small glasses. Before they sipped on the bubbly, they took their medicine. They raised their glasses and toasted to a better new year, for their flus to go away, and to an early retirement, as they decided 2021 would be the year they stopped chasing criminals and would enjoy a slower life together with Rosie, who would be turning five in a few weeks.
Sherlock kissed John back and laughed heartily. "Looks like the angels took 221B instead of Manhattan this time."
"You better believe it Johnny. It was dull lying in bed. It was nice having my family dote on me, but I'm so used to being up, active, and working."
"Don't worry, Linda and I have a plan," Barbara answered, a devious smirk on her face. "They're not due here for another hour and we've got some time to execute our revenge."
Janine's mom Barbara, and Linda Stamford walked out from the other side of the cabana. "We could call the police boys," Barbara announced firmly. "What do you think Linda?"
"Sounds good to me. But for now, I just want to snuggle with you while you read me chapters from that book of yours."
"It is. I made it up myself. I'll be the only one in the world. I already assist a friend of mine back in London with cases he and the Yard are unable to solve, which is all the time."
Molly just nodded, tears forming in her eyes. Their perfect summer was ruined, thanks to those psycho Holmes siblings.
"You're not acting like one now and you seem to have some remorse for what you did," John softly pointed out.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he broke away from John, pacing frantically around the room. "Of course John! A bomb threat! It all makes sense!" He furiously ran his fingers through his hair, shaking loose his curls. "He probably left something on school grounds and that's why we had to be evacuated."
"I'm not going to hurt him. He's the first person that hasn't treated me like a freak. You're not going to ruin this for me, or you'll end up like---"
"I know." She gave her son a squeeze. "Now both of you get in. I think we're due for another storm."
A loud clap of thunder tore through the night air, and John smiled. "I think that's a sign. I'm heading back inside. Do you have someplace to go?"
They were going to host a small gathering this evening, but the blizzard nixed those plans. Instead, they will have a New Year's Eve party, with Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft, Lestrade, Molly, (bringing her new boyfriend), Mike, Harry, and Clara attending. Sherlock has ordered food from Angelo's and everyone will be bringing their choice of spirits and sweets. Harry has non-alcoholic champagne, she's two years' sober.
Jimmy knelt in front of Sebastian, tenderly cupping his face. "I know it's difficult. But I'm taking care of it, taking care of you. No one is going to hurt my tiger anymore, I promise you." He placed another soft kiss on his lips.
“Well then, I’m proud to be your first one then, so to speak.” John was quickly gaining his second wind, and once again kneed the greaser in the groin and pushed him off hard. He shot up off the floor and ran out the door into the dark and stormy night. Steady cool rain was pelting him but he didn’t care. He had escaped, and he was making his way across the street to the Dimmock house. He could tell Addie what happened as she saw what Sherlock tried to do earlier today.
Sherlock smirked. Then he leaned in closer, those catlike eyes of his showing hunger and desire. "I want to kiss you," he murmured.
"I'll have your check ready for you when you're done, and we'll book the next session. I have some time coming up at work, going to take a three week holiday."
Sherlock had pulled disappearing acts before when someone had yelled at him or he didn't get what he wanted. Generally he ran off to the house of whatever boy he'd been sleeping with at the time, or to London's seedier neighborhoods where eager dealers were waiting to make illicit sales of the pills and cocaine he craved so much. His parents had no idea how to deal with a teenage sex and drug addict, short of threatening to put him in rehab, which they never did, ultimately coming to the conclusion Sherlock sequestered at home (once he decided to return or was found by the police and/or Mycroft) would be better than him locked up in a white room with doctors and therapists obsessing to get him to talk about his feelings, which would cause him to shut down completely.
the weakest and sappiest of Shakespeare's plays, but now he could see where The Bard was coming from, and why Romeo and Juliet had intentionally killed themselves to be together forever. Love is a vicious motivator, and it motivated him to want to stop living. All for a boy he barely knows.
A soft rain began to fall. In minutes it turned into a downpour, as if adding its own commentary to all the horrible events that unfolded over the weekend. John looked at the drops hitting the windshield and wondered when the black cloud hanging over his town would finally go away.
Sherlock sat cross-legged on the bed and began to unwrap the present. It was a plain white box. He lifted off the lid and what he saw nearly took his breath away. Pictures of John, in a rugby uniform and smiling. He chuckled at seeing the one with the candy cane down John's shorts. But it was the one of him with his shirt rolled up to show off his perfect bronzed abs that was Sherlock's favorite. His athletic power, his beauty, his resolve were all demonstrated in that one perfect picture. Sherlock wanted to show everyone in all of London how lucky he was to have such a perfect person as John as his bondmate, his best friend, his husband, his conductor of light.
Janine knew what happened to John after Molly told her when she arrived at the house. "At least John is with his sister and brother-in-law. But he's tough. That Holmes creep will take the hint. Sebastian Wilkes did."
"My fever broke at lunchtime, and Mummy said I could come and see you." His lips were set in a grim line. "I really need to tell you about Sheridan---" he began, but John cut him off with a wave of his hand.
The tea kettle sang out that the water was to a boil, but neither man moved to get it. John had his head on Sherlock's shoulder as the song wound down to its close.
Too soon, dinner was over and John's friends had to get on the road to get back to Sherrinford. The three were standing outside by Greg's car.
Sherlock and John were late in getting their flu shots. In their defense, the fears of Covid had led to more people in general getting their flu vaccinations which led to a shortage. John had retired from the clinic before summer so since he was no longer a working doctor he wasn't eligible for the free shots his former employer provided for staff. With he and his husband busy with cases for the Yard and Mycroft, caring for Rosie, and life in general, the two had been jabbed a week before Christmas. Since the vaccine needs to be in the body for two weeks for it to be effective, the boys weren't surprised that they got sick.
Sidney put a comforting arm around his wife. "Well, we now know where he is. We'll just go to Los Angeles and get him."
Warren stayed silent, still face down, not daring to peek at what John was doing. John had retrieved some rope from his bag and stood in front of the bed. "Turn over soldier and keep quiet."
The voice cackled again. "Don't be stupid. She's just a child. If it wasn't her, it would have been some other poor young girl. He never learned the meaning of the word no, and if you weren't like him, thinking like him, he'd go after you."
Sherlock took a drag of his cigarette and blew out the smoke in a way that John could only silently describe as seductive. He was literally like a cat swathed in leather and denim. He smirked at John again, and the blond was quickly losing his patience.
The morning was cool and cloudy, promising afternoon rain. John was leaving his English class, on his way to his favorite spot in the library to spend his free period doing the reading assignment his English teacher just gave him. When he entered the room, he saw Sherlock was already sitting at the table, in the chair John always sat in. The greaser grinned upon seeing John, who just smiled and shook his head.
"Right now I'm more worried about some unknown prowling around the community center," John replied tersely. "Let's go."
"Hope had his back turned from Wilkes, so I'm assuming Wilkes asked him to leave, or he was leaving of his own accord when he got shot. I want to know why the Hope kid was here," Fred replied.
"Nope. I would have remembered someone like him. He's got very light blond hair, so light it looks almost white, and he's tall and lean."
"It sounds most excellent. Let's go, my conductor of light. Or in today's case, my conductor of petrichor."
John came to stand right next to him. He glanced over at Sherlock, taking notice of his lean body and unusually handsome face. He was dressed as a pirate, and the knee-high black leather boots Sherlock sported were doing things to John's mind and groin. John had recently come out as bisexual, after a few short-term relationships with women that didn't go anywhere, and he was ready to explore and date a man. A guy that looked like Sherlock though, probably wouldn't be attracted to a short, ordinary person such as himself.
That force continued to keep John still, allowing the kiss and before he knew it, he was kissing him back.
John laughed and shook his head. Oh he had formal wear. His Army dress uniform, currently stored in a wardrobe bag in his closet. He never knew when he had to break it out. He even thought about wearing it to one of his sessions.
"And you and I will get in some Christmas Eve cuddling before lunch, how does that sound?" John suggested, ruffling Sherlock's snow-christened curls.
"Yes, I'm fine. Why do you ask?" Sherlock responded, putting his usual mask of indifference and annoyance back on.
"There's nothing normal about you doll," Jim murmured. "That's why I like you. But you're just fifteen."
Dave sat in his office, floored at what James had told him earlier today. But he couldn't make an arrest without getting evidence, and that meant requesting a search warrant. The town would be gobsmacked when there would be an arrest, but judging from what the bartender told James, and from what he knew, he could see why the killer did what he did, even if it was complete and utter madness.
John slowly opened his eyes. Sunlight was streaming in through his bedroom curtains. He could already feel the heat from outside seeping into his room. He sat up in bed, stretched, yawned loudly, and got up, switching on his fan that sat on his dresser. He exhaled as the cool air covered his face.
"It also helped that the song was stuck on autoplay on one of the cell phones at the scene, which makes it even more chilling," Sherlock added.
The two walked into the school, weaving their way through the groups of kids hanging out chatting in the hallway and up the steps to the second floor where their lockers and their homeroom were. John walked to his locker, opened it, and grabbed the books and notes he needed. After homeroom, his first class was history, then a free period before lunch.
When he finally looked up, he saw a man, about his height, a few years older than him, with short blondish-brown hair, cut short. It had been military style but now growing out. He wore dark jeans and a loose-fitting camouflage T-shirt. Silver dog tags were hanging around his neck. He was thin, but muscular.
The two men were enjoying a bottle of wine and waiting for their meals, making comfortable small talk. John was telling Victor about his day with Evie at the children's museum, and how the little girl loved the hands-on displays.
"Oh honey, please don't cry." Sylvia didn't know what else to say so she just rubbed her daughter's back and continued to hold her. She didn't want to leave her, but she and her father had to go to a funeral in Los Angeles and would have to go soon.
The two paid it no mind and went back to the movie. The infamous murder scene was about to happen. The shower curtain was suddenly pulled open, the knife raised, and as the first screech of the violin screamed out, all of a sudden the living room and kitchen windows in the flat were illuminated with white-blue light, and then everything went dark.
A few people ran into the alley, and their eyes and mouths dropped at seeing Molly, standing over Carl, fuming at him. Officer Dave Morstan arrived. He'd heard Molly screaming. "Molly! You okay?"
"Victor and I are at Oxford. I'm majoring in chemistry and he's majoring in partying," the man answered matter-of-fact.
"That's what his head says, but his heart is speaking a different language, especially after what happened yesterday at Regent's Park."
Sherlock couldn't help but smile at the sight. John looked right at home in the shop. He began walking towards him.
"He couldn't make it. There's a blizzard in New York and all flights are canceled. He's hoping to get in tomorrow night. But we already sent him pics of Jonathan. He's a proud granddad and already planning where he'll go to med school," Oliver explained.
Miss Eurus makes her first appearance, Sherlock is a sexy little stalker, Molly and Victor are protective best buds, and John is a stubborn idiot (as usual).
Jim remembered the Christmas party last year at Big Seb’s mansion on Baker Street. He had been chasing John for weeks and the fifteen year-old kept turning him down. Everyone in his social circle knew John was bisexual, so Big Seb thought he had a chance at finally getting with him. That night, he was fed up with John saying no so he pinned him against the wall and tried to kiss him. But he underestimated John’s strength and ended up with a beer bath and a threat of further violence if he tried it again. On New Year’s Eve, at yet another party, Big Seb laid his eyes on little Henry Knight and that was all she wrote. Unlike all the other teenagers, Henry enthusiastically responded and the two were together ever since.
Thought I'd end this on a nice note, because more mayhem is around the corner! So Eurus is not the psychopath we thought, but she still can be a manipulative lil' shit!
The fake blond who called himself Gray was a smarmy, self-righteous bastard who'd bragged to Jim about his last two relationships, mocking his exes and their demands that they not be treated so roughly. Jim had wanted to vomit all over the smug creep, but he had to stay in control if he wanted to finish the job. So he played the role of submissive perfectly, serving Gray a drink he'd laced with GHB. Gray downed it in one gulp, and within thirty minutes, he was in la-la-land, giving Jim all access. He'd stripped him, got him on the bed, and stuffed the gag in his mouth.
"You!" he hissed. "It's your fault my boy is dead! He told me he tried to give you a ride home and you turned him down...insulted him...he was trying to be nice to you...he liked you. Really liked you. And you treated him like dirt!"
John's eyes widened in shock. "Mr. Firth?  Ol' stuffed shirt, wishes he was in Regency England? Him? No way."
"You feel like getting some lunch?" John asked, removing his hand from Sherlock's curls and beginning to rub his back.
All of a sudden, the man charged towards her, screaming and ranting about how she should be at home and not whoring around town, threatening to bash her brains in, shouting that it was as God commanded. The police immediately jumped him, bringing him to the ground. One produced a pair of cuffs and slapped them on him. "That's enough!" he yelled at the suspect. "You're going to the Yard for a nice little chat!"
“No can do love,” John replied cheerfully as he entered the living room. He was dressed in grey sweatpants, white trainers, and a long-sleeved St. Bart’s T-shirt. He was carrying a red rain slicker. “If Sebastian can’t pass anatomy, he’s out for the rest of the season and he’s the star football player.”
Sherlock couldn't help but preen like a proud peacock, and the jealousy he felt when he entered the arena dissipated. "I'm very lucky to have John."
It was mid January, a week after Sherlock's 40th birthday, and six-thirty in the evening. It was also raining steadily, a cold raw rain that sank into bones and irritated old wounds and sore joints. It was the rain John hated the most because it reactivated the ache in his left shoulder, reminding him of when he got shot in Afghanistan. He was so looking forward to his holiday with Sherlock to Florida at the end of the month. Mrs. Hudson had bequeathed them a beach house in Miami that she owned but no longer wanted as it reminded her of her abusive marriage to the late and not great Frank Hudson. Sherlock and John jumped at the chance to have a separate place they could escape to when London got too much, even if it was on another continent. If she had asked the detective and the doctor two years ago, they would have turned her down, but now, after Sherrinford, after Mary, after a baby that turned out not to be John's, they needed a far away retreat more than ever.
"Wow," John breathed. "Hate to say it, but it sounds like they all deserved each other. But what does the song have to do with it?"
"Mrs. H, I hate to scare you, but what if the killer goes after you and Angelo again? He's probably furious you fought him off and survived," Ella soberly pointed out.
The police had been called, and with their help, Officer Dave Morstan contained everyone at the scene and roped off the parking lot. Phillip and Sally's bodies were removed and taken to the morgue for autopsy. DJ Billy Wiggins continued his live broadcast, interviewing everyone. John and Sherlock told their story about them being outside and hearing what they believed to be a prowler, and that Officer Morstan, Angelo, and Robert Lestrade had checked the grounds and found nobody. Now people were wondering if this unseen prowler returned and committed murder.
“Don’t worry babe, I’ll have you home in plenty of time.” He stood up and took her hand, kissing the top of it. She giggled, feeling absolutely giddy and still in disbelief that Greg Lestrade, handsome popular jock, was now her boyfriend. “I have to tell my Mom I’m leaving. Wait right here.” She bounded out of the kitchen and into the family room. Greg did a fist pump, a big goofy smile on his face. He couldn’t think things would get any better.
After five months of working at the clinic, his life changed again, but this time for the better. He met someone.
"Whatever we don't eat, I'll bring it to work for the gals' candy dishes out front," John said. "If I can get it away from Captain Sweet Tooth over there," motioning towards his boyfriend.
"Yeah, and you certainly aren't going to be around a bunch of half-naked chicks in their underwear," Marty cracked, a knowing grin on his face.
"I think I'm going to step out for a bit so you boys can talk. Will you be okay John?" she asked, a little hesitant. After all, it was only several days ago John had left Sherrinford because of her son's actions.
The psychotic killer terrorizing Sherrinford struck again last night, this time claiming two teenagers as his newest victims.
Sherlock, captivated by this intriguing mix of scents, took a look around the club to see where this lovely symphony of smells was coming from. With his gaze towards the left side, he saw a small blond man sitting alone at a table, watching the dancers and smiling, head and shoulders bobbing from side to side in time with the music. He'd found the source, and he had to meet him.
Eurus tensed up and frowned. Her brother was going to tell him everything. She knew the guilt was eating away at him like acid.
"It's okay, just a flesh wound." He looked down at Wilkes, who was curled up into a fetal position on the floor. "Nothing but a waste." He turned to Wanda, who was still breathing hard from her physical confrontation with the murderer and leaned into her. "It's okay Wanda. It's done."
"But John, I am a sex-starved pervert." Sherlock shot John an intense, lustful gaze. "Skip the library and let's spend free period outside. I didn't get to spend any time with you yesterday." He scooped up John into his arms and held him tight. John could feel warm nicotine breath ghosting lightly on his neck, and he started to feel tingly.
The calm silence was broken by the door opening up. Veronica Holmes entered, and upon seeing John, her pale blue eyes widened in surprise at the stranger sitting next to her son's bed.
Greg nodded, letting go of John’s hand. “Yes. My husband Mycroft runs the club.” He cleared his throat. “Look, I want to apologize for Sherlock’s antics---”
"Happy New Year Sherlock, I love you," John told his husband, leaning back to look into the detective's blue-green eyes.
“I don’t think you’re a nerd Molly. I think you’re a sweet and wonderful girl and I want to go steady with you. Irene doesn’t like doing normal fun things. I want to be with someone who likes sock hops and drive-ins and roller skating and hanging out listening to records.” He placed his hand on top of hers, which made him shiver. “So come on, will you be my girl?”
The two police officers shot by Wilkes had been treated and released. They had only been grazed by the bullets.
The two sat down to their Valentine's meal, and John no longer felt like an ugly old omega. He felt beautiful, and cherished, and suddenly this icy, dreary Valentine's Day became bright and wonderful.
Hal started his car up and pulled out of the parking lot. "He had everything too. Money, a nice house, a good job...what went wrong?" Hal mused.
"Now let me turn on the radio. I'll be right in the kitchen if you need me." The radio sat on top of a small table that sat in the corner of the living room. She turned it on and tuned it to KMOF, then went back to her work. John slowly munched on a few crackers and sipped some of his soda before laying back on the couch, closing his eyes and humming along to the rock music. It didn't take long before he fell asleep. Wanda looked over at him and smiled, glad to see him resting peacefully.
Rosie was happily babbling as John entered he and Sherlock's room. She immediately held out her arms when she saw Sherlock. "Papa!"
John nodded. "He died in a car accident when I was thirteen. He was riding with a friend, and another car came out of nowhere from a side street and crashed into them. It was so sudden and there was nothing Sam could do to avoid it. Sam was paralyzed after the accident. I hate to say it, but I would rather Dad be dead than alive and not being able to walk. It would have destroyed him."
And from then on, Jim was fascinated and enchanted by the handsome soldier with the tattoo of a tiger on his back whose name was Sebastian Moran. He had been honorably discharged due to a knee injury.
Bryan sat back in his chair. “I actually met Zach Quinn months before he attacked Sebastian. He was a real piece of work. Arrogant, sexually aggressive, thought he was God’s gift to men.” He suddenly looked at Evie. “John, if we can have this conversation later, I mean, might not be good with the baby here…”
The breeze had picked up a little, sending refreshing waves over John. He could smell the sand and sea and he closed his eyes in utter bliss. He could live like this forever.
“Don’t call them that John. They’re perfectly lovely children. But they were both in bed with colds tonight so that made my job a lot easier.” She grinned and took a drink of her strawberry milkshake.
Sherlock smirked to himself as he watched John leave in the cab. He was sure he didn't see past his disguise. Now he could follow him around the city, get his routine down, and John would have to give in eventually and give him a session.
She smiled sadly at him, and then at her son. John felt like an intruder. He stood up. "Um, thank you Mrs. Holmes. Well, I'll guess I'll go, since he's sleeping."
Sherlock bent down and grinned, kissing Rosie on the cheek. "Good choice honeybee. Bespoke is a good word. It means custom made. Like this kitten was custom made for our family."
