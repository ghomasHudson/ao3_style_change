And then he wonders what the hell to say next, because what if Steve isn’t gay, what if Steve hates Tony, what if Steve is disgusted and repulsed?
Too quick to be read, Tony catches a number at the far-most right of Steve’s wrist and stares in shock.
Tony was adjusting his shirt when he notices his cuff was facing the wrong way. He pulls it off, wondering what the number had jumped to. It had been a day since he checked it last—the time still hadn’t changed since then. Tony had rolled his eyes and pulled the cuff on yesterday. He had thought it was going to change sometime soon, and didn’t really bother to check it.
Steven Grant Rogers, unlike everyone else on the list, has earned his spot not because Tony likes/respects/cares about him, per se, but because he's fucking Captain America and a guy who is very, very hard to impress—and Tony wants to impress him just once. He's not proud of the reasoning behind it. He doesn't mention this to his therapist, either, because she'd go into a round of daddy issues and self-worth issues. And probably everything else that's wrong with him. But whatever. Tony doesn't
It was hard to fake the surprise on his face when Tony took a step closer to Steve when Steve knew that it was supposed to happen, but he wasn’t an actor for nothing. Even if this entire scene was conflicting for him and he was compromised, he couldn’t just drop the ball.
) loves Rogers, and think he's completely adorable. Pepper—Tony still can't believe she betrayed him—likes Steve enough that they go out to art museums whenever there's a new exhibit at one of them. Even Hill, the poster girl for glares and not cracking a single smile, has been caught smiling or smirking at Steve.
“What am I going to do with your Oscar? That’s a given,” Tony jokes briefly, but his expression devolves into seriousness, studying Steve intently. Steve has always known that Tony could almost perfectly read him like an open book, with the exception of just one little thing. “I meant anyone that matters won’t think any less of you.”
“I’m here tonight with none other than our leading men, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark! How’s it going for you?” she asks, her bright smile showing off all of her blinding white teeth. But the gleam in her eyes says more about her than anything in her eyes, Steve thinks, because she’s out here for something more than basic tabloid fodder.
Two hours later, the story completely changes. Both of them are drunk, him more so than her only because she’s drunken what seems like two glasses and he’s drunken what seems like two bottles to a normal person.
Now, staring at the row of zeroes that was his timer, he wasn’t laughing anymore. He had met his soulmate. Somewhere, somehow, he had met his soulmate, and he didn’t even notice who it could have been. There had been hundreds of people at the Stuttgart Museum and the time would have corresponded to that and—he had a soulmate. He had someone out there who he had a... and Tony had played it off as a joke, and he hadn’t cared.
“Sorry,” he apologizes on behalf of Tony, “We’re still not allowed to breathe a word about the movie. He’s just being a jerk about it, since he’s half in love with his character. A bit narcissistic if you ask me, but to each their own.”
“Who think that Erik Lensherr shouldn’t have been my father in the movie?” Steve fills in for her, half-guilty for interrupting. But it’s kind of a pressure point for him, especially given the fact that Erik’s help had been innumerable to him. “I swear, if he didn’t belong in the movie, then neither did I. He fell into character perfectly on set, with such a level of professionalism I can only
"Nope," Clint says, popping the p and somehow managing to grin over a glass of champagne. Classy, and so much unlike Clint. "We all know your favorites are Bruce and Steve. Because of sex and science."
Tony is starting to think that this is maybe why Steve accepted so quickly, had it not been for his eye catching someone coming up the stairs. There he goes.
“Hmm,” Steve says, looking through the comments and playing dumb. “I think I lost all the questions from before; send in news ones!” Tony huffs a laugh. They both know that they’re only one question everyone’s going to ask now.
Steve smiles innocently and starts to pull off the next one, which is being particularly stubborn. “I’m not accusing you of anything. I’m telling it like it is.” Tony gasps again.
”No, Tony, it doesn’t. I’ve always told you that you have a soulmate, and now we know that you do. I know we’ve lost them—”  It's funny how Pepper seems to share responsibility for this, like she was the idiot with an ever-changing timer and absolutely no belief in their soulmate timer or the fact they had one. Like she was the idiot who didn’t bother to look at their timer and let her soulmate slip by. Like she was the idiot who then did all but cry about it, even though she still had no faith in it, “—but it isn’t your fault. You aren’t a bad person or an evil monster and you aren’t the Merchant of Death to deserve this.”
“Or you could tell me how much you appreciate me,” Tony says, barely hiding a laugh. “You know being your roommate and all.” Steve shoots him a sly look.
"They're definitely going to fuck, right?" Tony asks with a need for confirmation. "I'm not seeing that wrong?"
“You guessed it in one,” the bartender says, before someone down the left end of the counter calls for him, rather impatiently and rudely. But Tony can't really say he expects any different from the people here; that's the nature of this place. “He's behind you, by the way. You'll recognize him.”
“You think I walked out of that alright,” Steve slowly says, a haunting expression coming over his face. “Because there wasn’t anything to bounce back from. Natasha saw remnants of a past that had been washed out of her by brainwashing and locked away in shackles, because that’s how she lives, by not thinking about it at all. Thor saw a future where he failed, but it hadn’t occurred to him before this, had it? And he saw something in there that’s going to distract him from his dream. Bruce saw a Harlem where he killed Betty. Do you know the last time Bruce worried about Harlem specifically? 2012. And then we helped him out of it. She spent minutes on them, reading their minds and pulling thoughts out.” He laughs. “She spent twenty four seconds on me, twenty seconds too many with the number of times I’ve seen that nightmare and the number of waking moments I think about it.“
.” The break in his voice came from him shamelessly moaning again, now that he didn’t have lines left in this scene to try extra hard to remember in the midst of remembering that this was not real. But damn, did he want it to be.
The Avengers have all been invited to some governor's (senator's?) party that Fury makes them all go to, on pretense of staying on their favorable side. Tony hates it, hates this, hates that he couldn't even put up a fight because Fury had left before he got a word in. Lucky Thor; Thor always seems to miss the boring Avengers PR events.
Still, that didn't change how Cap was partially the reason that Tony didn't care about his stupidly changing timer. It also didn't change how Steve was still the reason that Tony was not losing his mind like he had his soulmate. He was just inspiring like that, and Tony marked it down as the Steve Rogers phenomenon again.
“You’ve checked every single person from that day?” Pepper asks one day, when the two of them are just lounging around in the mansion, a rarity thanks to both of their schedules.
“The first one came out in, like, 2008. That was eleven years ago. I was still dancing around the drinking age then,” Steve says with a frown. Well, he technically could have gone to the movie drunk and be fully within legal limits, but it was fun to tease Tony about his age sometimes.
Words sounded fake to him, and maybe it was because he had repeated reassuring phrases over and over again until they had lost all value, but now they sounded fake. Empty and hollow, and of no use. But they were true, and everything had worked out just fine, and now Tony would learn from his mistakes again and live. He would live. It was going to be just fine.
He says it all in a thick Brooklyn accent that Tony never knew Rogers had. Actually, Rogers being this carefree and light, without the stick up his ass and without that permanent scowl was something Tony hasn't even imagined. He thinks he would more sooner believe this was a cheerier, possibly gayer, more carefree and casual clone of Rogers than Rogers himself. Seriously, the sexuality (because why else would Rogers be here at a gay bar like a regular and look so comfortable?) reveal was shocking enough that Tony wondered if he was overthinking it. Maybe Rogers was here as a friend or something... but Tony hadn't even known that Rogers was aware of the mostly accepted LGBTQIA+ community, let alone be someone from the 1940's who accepted it this well. He can't handle this information right now, and—
But since Clint is searching for his hearing aids, she’s forced to turn around and say, “Did you take them out again, you idiotic disaster?” while she signs the ASL translation of that. Tony catches her pinky entending near her forehead upwards in a motion he recognizes with the sheer frequency she uses it towards Clint.
Steve jumps from his seat to grab the bucket of tweets before Tony can, and all but cradles it. “Really?” Steve asks, feeling the camera panning in on his expaserated face. “You couldn’t have at least done better?
“Oh my god Steve, Maria’s on this,” Tony says suddenly, and Steve winces. “Alright, there’s a question from Steve’s agent, and she asks why Steve’s being a coy bastard when subtlety isn’t in his nature. Wow. Steve, she really went for you.”
Steve looks out the window again and sees that he has less than a minute before he has to get out and walk the carpet. A buzz from his phone has him looking down just as his chauffeur for the night rolls down the window and notifies him of the seconds he has left until he has to do just that.
Though, with the way that Steve is looking like he stepped out of a photoshoot perfectly attractive right now, in that indigo two-piece suit, it isn't hard to see why people flock to him. Seriously, Tony needs to find out whoever does Steve's wardrobe, or even whoever helped him with that suit. It's a necessary task now. Very necessary.
"Alright, so he doesn't stand out too much, then, in this crowd." Tony realizes that's not a question, so he tacks on, "Right?"
“Tony?” Steve asks, before he catches Tony’s gaze to his wrist. He immediately turns away his wrist and tenses. “Tony.”
Tony tries to hide his shock at the information that has been revealed to him and instead looks at Rogers. Rogers, who’s in jeans that look like they’ve been stitched onto him for how tight and ass-flattering they are, and a green-gray Henley that shows off every flexing muscle while leaving nothing to the imagination. His hair is messy and tousled in a way that Tony’s never seen in. He can’t make much out, but he can tell that the shirt is buttoned, for hoe the light doesn’t reflect off of them right.
“I flirt with everyone when I’m in the mood for it,” Steve says, giving Tony a strange look, since he honestly thought Tony knew that he’s not exclusively into a particular gender. “I thought I didn’t have to come out.”
,” Tony hissed, before kissing him again. For the next thirty seconds, they worked out a rhythm of ‘faking it’ more until Peggy called it.
Tony pretends to not notice when Steve leans in imperceptibly closer, and he doesn’t complain either.
A resounding number of answers reassure him that he doesn’t, so Steve glances back to Tony with a smirk, raising his eyebrows and shrugging. Tony rolls his eyes, but the careful look in his eyes is replaced with relief. Steve realizes he’s staring, and looks away.
Steve gestures to the apartment all around him with a hand, waving frantically everywhere. The same commenters sends a thumbs up emoji.
Steve laughs, loud and clear and winces again, but the blond doesn’t seem to care. Tony takes one look at him and wonders if this is what having a soulmate feels like. If this is the kind of love they feel, because he really can’t imagine anything else.
“You’re putting on a brave face,” Tony accuses him, “Stop doing that. I just outed our relationship; I outed you.”
Tony starts to ask him what made him stop, because all that he can see in that direction is a clock and this isn't Cinderella, but Steve beats him to the point once again.
“36 years ago, Barbara Streisand won this same award, and in those 36 same years, not a single woman has had the honor to hold this award in her triumph. I know as I say this, there are always the detractors who say that women are not qualified to hold this trophy and their hands and proudly smile; they are the same people who dare say that Barbara Streisand was not worthy, and the same who will later say I am not worthy. Oh, but we
The smile doesn’t leave his face as he thinks about how to answer. If he says anything about Tony, she can and will seize upon it. But if he mentions nothing, she will also seize upon that. So he splits the difference and says, “I think I was the second actor to sign onto the movie, which meant I kind of spent some time before shooting began last year following up on the news of casting and script changes. And the thing about Peggy Carter is that she casts people who fit their roles and the people they work with almost perfectly, so I don’t think it was any surprise that all of us got on really well. And I kind of got to know everyone beforehand too, at least by meeting them once or twice, so, I loved them all.”
Of course, they all leap to their feet and cheer loudly when the Howlies win for best Screenplay. Across the room, everyone from Centre of the World are cheering. The Howlies, as befitting of their talent with words, kill their speech that Steve is too busy being happy for them to listen and soak it all in. Oops.
“Can one of these be about you?” Steve asks, pulling out a fifth one and finding that it was about him. On a suspicion, he dumps all of them out, and at quick glance, they all seem to be about him. He stares at the camera, unimpressed like he’s on the Office. “I’ve been set
”Oh,” her breath catches in surprise, “Oh, Tony, that’s delightful, I knew you had a soulmate, I can’t wai—”
He pauses when footsteps approach his way, fearful that it’s some paparazzi, even if the cemetery itself is closed to those who don’t have a specific person or purpose to visit. Steve hates himself for having to think about that when he has to visit his mother, but it’s one of the few detractors of the life. Not that he has to worry for long, not when a familiar dark cologne washes over him. Feeling himself releasing the sudden pent-up tension, he closes his eyes and hums through a few prayers.
“I don’t want it,” he says in between loud gasps for air that sound broken to his own ears. “I don’t want it, I just want her back, goddamnit, I want to be happy, not this, I can’t do this, not without her, who am I even kidding, I shouldn’t
Rogers's jaw sets as his face darkens and glares at Tony, pinning him better to the wall than any shackles could ever hope to. “Congratulations, you found me. And now you know
"Are you sure you aren't deliberately fucking with me? Because I refuse to believe you've thought of everyone and come up blank."
"Things like visiting hospitals, talking to kids at schools, raising awareness for things like the VA and other causes. I mean, those are the good parts of the job, but they are part of the job. Just as much as talking to the WSO and worldwide governments on how the Avengers are not a threat. Or on how someone's needs to take responsibility for allowing the Mandarin's influence to spread and the nuke on Manhattan." When Tony stares at Steve like Steve has grown a second head, because wow, what the
Tony gapes, because he hadn't known that. At all. Huh, that explained why none of them had seen Rogers in over a week. “He d—”
here,” Steve says helplessly, gesturing to the ceremony with a befuddled expression everyone laughs at. “I didn’t think I was going to be invited to the Golden Globes, to be honest, I—my god, I think I’ve somehow brainwashed people into thinking I’m a decent actor.” He stares at his award for a second in amazement, shaking his head in amazement as people continue to laugh. He’s suddenly aware of the looming time limit that’s going to hit if he doesn’t start talking and talking fast. “It just has to be because of the amazing cast and crew from Centre of the World, who I’d love to give a big shout-out to. They’re the true criminals, with how they killed it. Without their performances and their magic, my role would have been nothing, let alone award-worthy. Especially to Peggy Carter and Tony Stark—is this what you two meant when you kept telling me that all the crazy things we did would pay off? Well, something happened. And to Maria, Bucky, and Sam, I love the three of you dearly for all the support and patience I’ve gotten from you. Same goes for everyone who’s part of the coffee circle, you know who you are. But most of all I’d like to thank anyone who has ever watched a movie that I’ve been in. You have no idea what that means to me—an actor owes their job to the people who watch them on any screen. Thank you.”
Tony’s face loses all colour, and his hands drop from his hair. “What?” he asks, sounding horrified. “It’s a what now?”
The man is punctual and planned and prepared and perfect and quick-thinking and responsive and responsible and reliable and strategic and serious and everything else that falls in that basket of a perfect soldier. Fury loves him, especially since he shows up to every single meeting/debriefing and actually does his paperwork, extensively. He doesn't miss a single work-related details and really doesn't stop working. On the rare occasion he's not working, Rogers is seemingly moping in SHIELD-assigned apartment that's incredibly pathetic.
"Who do you take me for?" Tony asks, offended at the insinuation. "A, no matter how much I don't like him that's a dick move, especially considering how I found out. B, I'm not about to ruin the dreams of millions of women around the world."
"Yeah," Tony says, because his mind cannot function with how close Steve is to him and how much hotter he looks up close. "That's fine." He makes a prompt exit, lest he lose his cool, and saunters over to Natasha. She already knows what he wants, and he just waits while he thinks.
"Well, the only two people left I can't really see are you and me, and it can't be you, and it can't be—”
Rogers cuts in sharply. “Don't tell me that I'm half gay, or whatever you're about to say, and don't tell me that I can just date women and get away with liking men as well sometimes. I'm fucking gay and I can't fucking choose to just like girls; I've been trying for the past twenty damned-something years! And if you really don't know why I can't just be out with it, I really don't know what's to tell you, Stark. Thought you were supposed to be smart."
Steve snaps out of it intensely enough to give someone else whiplash. Tony’s always known for being in his head, but no one seems to realize that
“Word of advice to everyone or anyone who wants to get in the industry,” Steve says, straight-faced, “Find an agent who doesn’t want to watch you suffer. Or an agent who doesn’t make fun of your slippers. Listen, anyone who disses your Iron Man slippers is a fake friend. How else am I supposed to show my appreciation for Iron Man?”
“He’s 6’2”, blond, blue eyes, muscles on muscles, uptight personality with a great ass, and probably not here,” Tony describes as the other man’s smirk deepens, somehow recognizing the description and knowing full well who is being described.

Tony pretends to sulk, but uses the tactic to steal a tweet from the bucket. He waves it in the air in triumph, too gleeful about it, Steve thinks. Why is he this eager to read them? Does he know something Steve doesn’t?
spend the time wondering about his sexuality. Or the fact that Steve had showed up to the mandatory team meeting late and a little disheveled, promptly ending any and all debates about his virginity, but sparking new ones about
Tony gapes for what must be the fifth or sixth time that night. "You did what?" He wasn't even aware that Steve knew about the list, let alone was helping Tony with the list. "She did what?"
"Caltain America is a day job," Steve says when he comes to pick Tony up from his lab because Tony has apparently spent too many hours in here without real food and sleep. "It's not my priority in the sense that it's yours, but it is a priority and a day job."
He doesn’t know how long he spends crying, or how long the people running the backstage part of the Oscars let him stay in their corner and cry. Maybe he’ll make the news if someone tells on him. Steve won’t give a single fuck about it anyway; he’ll be drunk and crying his entire way next week, probably.
“Thank you,” he whispers to Ricardo, who nods and slips back in, driving off. Steve, now alone, looks around in the crowd for Tony, who said that he would be here, right out the window. Hopefully Tony hadn’t been lying or wasn’t confused.
He absolutely was not panicking in his penthouse of Stark Tower at seven in the morning. No, he wasn't, what was anyone talking about? Shut up, JARVIS, he did not need this sass this early in the morning.
So when Tony absentmindedly dips down low and places a quick kiss on the top of Steve’s head, before walking away to do god knows what, Steve knows immediately that there’s not enough planning in the world that could have prevented that. It doesn’t stop him from turning pink, the realization that he couldn’t have stopped it, but at least he doesn’t turn red or start stammering. This is fine, he tells himself, this is absolutely fine. It’s okay; the truth had to have come out sometime. Steve very carefully doesn’t think about it.
"It's a priority in the sense that most people don't think Steve when they see me, but Captain America," Steve dryly says, a hint of a fond smirk dancing around his words. "And it's a day job because I spend every other day at SHIELD or some government as Captain America, or out somewhere doing Captain-like things."
That was an answer in itself for how telling it was. "Nineteen forty-something? Thirty-something? It can't be twenty-something, you would have been eleven at best." He pauses.
So Tony invites Steve to a party he's throwing at the Tower out of good spirit, and Steve accepts it surprisingly, also in good spirit. He didn't even have to say anything to convince Steve to say yes, which really threw him for a loop, considering he had a few things up his sleeve to try and persuade him. Tony'll take it as a win.
Steve takes a break from his HYDRA hunt on the first of July with Sam and without the Winter Soldier. Right in time for his birthday and the party that Tony’s throwing him. Really, Tony wishes he could have planned the timing this well.
Just as he is about to leave the room, Steve peeks back, having thought of something. Those eyes look at Tony again dead-on, really seeing Tony and leaving him bare open. Tony wonders why Steve never lets himself stop at the exterior, why Steve tries time and time again to see Tony as the broken monster he really is. Steve leaves.
from him, from Liam and the scene and whatever else. He pretended for a moment that he wasn’t kissing his best friend, but rather kissing a nameless, faceless person from a crowd. He didn’t want to think about the way that both of them groaned into each other’s mouths, pushing and prodding each other’s mouth in a one-sided fight for dominance. Tony’s arms were still on either side of him, trapping Steve in even though physically Steve’s taller and generally larger.
Of course, he can't avoid Steve forever, or even at all now that they’re vaguely friends. For one, the jobs that they have make it impossible for that to happen. And for another, Steve is a goddamn stubborn bastard with no sense of social cues. Okay, maybe he does have social cues; it’s just that he doesn’t know anything about Tony. Nothing.
“I have a soulmate,” Steve says with a smile, only the smile is so wrong, so bitter, so sad that Tony wants to look away now from this extremely private moment but can’t. He stares at Natasha, before pulling off his cuff and showing it to Natasha in just an awkward angle that Tony can’t pick it up in all of the shadows and whatnot.
Where the hell did these thoughts about Steve come from? Why the fuck does he want to fuck Steve until he couldn't walk right, super soldier or no? What even happened to disliking Steve and taking their glacier-like friendship and actually turning into a friendship? Why does Tony even care? Oh fuck, he cannot be lusting over Steve.
“Looking around,” Tony shrugs, “Wanting a drink, maintaining a low profile, searching for you, finding you, oh you know, basic things.” He tries to steel himself at whatever is about to come next, but he has to face it. When it comes to Rogers, Tony is never prepared, and he's never fully giving as best as he could. He barely manages to give as good as he gets by means of insults and backhanded jabs.
So he doesn't expect Pepper walking out right behind him, matching his quick pace with her killer heels and trying to get a word with him. He expects her to command him to stop, or to talk business with him, or to scold him for his lack of attention. So when she doesn't do any of that, he's surprised.
"I'm counting that, by that way," Steve says, rolling his eyes, "But he knows because he caught me out on a date."
“So while the two of you, and the entire cast and crew of Centre of the World, were on your week of silence,” Kat Farrell, the late night talk show host says, “I’m guessing you missed generally every single word that was said about the movie?”
) loves Rogers, and think he's completely adorable. Pepper—Tony still can't believe she betrayed him—likes Steve enough that they go out to art museums whenever there's a new exhibit at one of them. Even Hill, the poster girl for glares and not cracking a single smile, has been caught smiling or smirking at Steve.
"Bucky loved dancing. Bucky loved taking me on double dates that involved dancing. I loved dancing. And I also loved going to clubs all around Brooklyn and finding people to dance with," Steve's face lit up a little at the mention of it, like a man who wished he could go back, and like a man who seemed to be reminiscing past naïveté. "Nineteen thirty-something, yeah."
“You guessed it in one,” the bartender says, before someone down the left end of the counter calls for him, rather impatiently and rudely. But Tony can't really say he expects any different from the people here; that's the nature of this place. “He's behind you, by the way. You'll recognize him.”
Tony grins as his mind is doing cartwheels and flips and playing fireworks in his mind, congratulating him for his soulmate. “As long as we’re in agreement.”
Steve shakes his head, gesturing vaguely to negate Tony’s point. “I mean—it wasn’t—I just—okay, it wasn’t like there was no hesitation. Obviously I knew that if I took it, the role would be, like you said, like none other in my filmography. But it was just—I liked it. The challenge.”
“Better on our own terms than anything else. Besides, I admitted to everyone that I’m not okay. Pretty sure that I was going to be in the news anyway. Might as well get everything out, right?” Steve jokes, quirking a grin.
"That's bullshit," Tony says, because what else is he going to respond to that? "Can you just give me a straight answer? Come on."
“We did the entire movie together and you didn’t ever think, hey, Steve’s too comfortable with this? Huh, I wonder why.”
Clint blinks. "Buddy," the archer slowly says. "You're really not going to tell me that you haven't noticed that Steve swings the other way, right?" Tony gapes, because since when does Clint know? But Clint takes it the wrong way and frowns. "Oh man, did I just—Tasha! You said that he fucking knew! Jesus fuck, outing someone isn't... that's—”
Still no Rogers, and Tony’s disappointed his system has lied to him. He eyes the newly freed, bloodless stool right near the handsome bartender and decides he can use a drink. Tony orders and watches the bartender do a double take, rolling his eyes.
“Depends,” Tony responds, downing a third in one shot. “I was looking for a friend, but maybe trouble’s what I want.”
“It was the stuff out of my deepest fantasies,” he says with a smirk, pretending to struggle with keeping a straight face at Tony’s expression. “Kissing Tony Stark was like a thing off the bucket list, you know, right below punching Hitler or going to the moon. He’s such a
From the way that he sees delight on Everheart’s face, he realizes that he’s said something that perfectly wants to hear. Whatever that may be, whatever he’s accidentally transitioned himself into, he’ll just have to wait and see.
“I wasn’t about to let you cry alone,” Tony responds, not unkindly, but sympathetically. “Not when you’ve worked too hard for this, not when she’s worked too hard for you for this. You know, she told me to watch after you. Said you cried too easily.”
SHIELD is/was HYDRA. Pierce was their leader. HYDRA is/was everywhere, in governments all around the world. That was why the three of them were declared fugitives. The new guy is Steve’s running buddy, and a VA counselor with an impressive resumé as the Falcon. New guy was Air Force, trained by Rhodey. Fury was almost killed by an elusive decades-old assassin named the Winter Soldier. Fury is now, for all intents and purposes, dead. The Winter Soldier is not. He was James Buchanan Barnes, as in Steve’s best friend and Howling Commando and personally Tony’s favorite. He was sent to eliminate Steve as well, right before Project Insight was launched. Project Insight, something Tony had taken a look at and not paid attention to. There’s the shit with Arnim Zola, and Hill now working with Pepper, and Coulson being alive (with his own new team) and the Winter Soldier
"What's blasphemous to everyone else is your weird ability to not sleep in days just or the fun of it."
He laughs self-deprecatingly, wiping the last of his tears off his face and hoping he doesn’t look splotchy. “She’s not here and all I can think is how much I wish I told her that she’s the reason I’m here, the reason I’ve made it this far. Five years ago, on this day, she received a cancer diagnosis, stage four. On the date nominations came out this year, but four years back, she died. And I wonder to this day if she knew what she meant to me. A lot of you voted for me to receive this Oscar, but I have one more thing to ask of all of you, regardless of who you are. Everyone has one person that matters the most to them, and if you don’t, you will one day. Tell them, show them,
“Stark is German,” Steve points out. “Means strong. Don’t ask me how I know that. Someone, somewhere once told me. Anyway. Next one. Is Tony Stark done being Iron Man?”
But as the party winds down somewhere near midnight, somewhere near one, and he's gliding across the room, checking up and socializing seamlessly, he notices something strange. When he looks at Natasha, who's subtly staring at the same thing with a hint of curiosity, he goes over to her again. Seems like they were wrong, or Steve wasn't telling the full truth.
"Seems like you're real broken up over him," Natasha says, glancing over at Steve again. Damn, she's not going to let this one go until he leaves, and maybe not even then. When she looks at Tony, it's to say
”No,” Steve cuts him off, “Don’t apologize. This is what you do. Push, prod, and poke, because you’re an engineer and someone who tinkers. That is who you are. Don’t apologize for being you.”
"And that's not the right question," Steve smirks again. "When did I learn to dance, on the other hand..."
As he looks out the window, he sees that they’ve already made it onto the red carpet. Now there are only a few minutes left to steel himself for the ongoing slaughter of reporters, press, and interviews he will undoubtedly have to face. Sometimes, the press is the most daunting thing he has to do for a movie, and after three long weeks of exclusively traveling and promoting Centre of The World, he can’t wait for it to be over. Thank god that it’s only been three. Steve wants go back home—at this point, if someone asks him which home, he honestly doesn’t care—slump into his couch, throw his feet up on the table, and watch all the television shows people keep telling him to watch.
”I don’t know what the context is, but fuck you too,” Clint says from behind Natasha, seemingly looking for something. He’s staring intently at Tony’s lips and Tony sighs. Natasha doesn’t even have to turn around to figure it out.
Tony wants to backtrack, backtrack, backtrack faster than he can think or even handle right now. “Fury—”
Steve scrolls through them on his laptop, skipping over the questions that ask about the mystery woman from his Oscars speech and where we went after the Oscars, since he had missed all of the after-parties. He finally stopped at one that encompassed what he really wanted to talk about.
“What the hell was that?” Tony asks, awe in his voice. “Oh my god. Do that again. Actually, wait, don’t, I’m going to start tearing up, Rogers. Can we end the interview right here?”
Steve smiles. If he had a dime for every time someone asked him this question, Steve would have just about the actual amount of money he earned doing the film itself. “It was very different, but I loved the change in pace. I think a lot of the movies I’ve been are very high-stakes kind of movies in the sense where there’s always action and heavy sequencing driving the movie, so in that sense it wasn’t drastically a change. But a lot of the others involved a lot less heavy emotion, if that makes any sense. Someone could watch the soliloquy scene twenty different times and walk away thinking something different of it each time. And shooting a scene like that wasn’t easy.”
kisser?” Tony asks. Steve very pointedly doesn’t look at Tony, because he doesn’t think he’ll stop himself from caving and saying something dumb and sappy. “Kind of
“How long did it take, shooting that soliloquy?” she asks. “There is currently a running debate on several social media platforms that it isn’t the same one each and every time that the scene appears during the movie. I think I might have to agree, with how nuanced each instance feels when watching.”
are you doing here?” Rogers growls, all but trapping Tony, back up against the closest wall from the stairs. The suit just might be a lost cause at this point if the wall is as
He eventually stops crying, sobs eventually subsiding into quieter tears and then completely ending. “This is wrong,” Steve says when he thinks the worst of his shaking has also ended. “Tell me I’m being selfish. Tell me I shouldn’t be crying and wanting Ma like a child.”
“Mine,” Tony growled, but not before nipping Steve’s lip again, in a move that would have drawn blood if it hadn’t been faked by faking the camera angles. “Unless you ever leave again.”
And Steve looks so young and peaceful without the heavy weight of Captain America on him that Tony doesn’t want to move and wake him up. It’s at this exact time when Tony realizes that Steve isn’t even thirty yet, that Steve has had to soldier the mistakes of the world and every other person from such a young age that he probably doesn’t even know what it’s like to be a carefree twenty something. Steve, who is sunshine and quick sketches and witty remarks and from-scratch baked goods, probably hasn’t even dated anyone.
much more than what his words do, his mannerisms that are so very distinct, and anything and everything else that’s uniquely Tony. He can walk into any room where Steve’s at and suddenly Steve will feel all the more better. It’s like magic, the way Tony makes Steve want to smile and never stop.
“No, but I learned all about your failure to film your first scene from her,” Steve says all too sweetly. “And to everyone who watches the movie, you’ll see what I mean.” He winks. It’s all a lie, because it’s still a little hard to breathe, but Tony makes it just a little lighter, just a little more honest. But it’s fine; Steve can act.
Tony’s blood runs cold. This is eerily like his story, and it can’t be, it really can’t be. And yet, this makes so much sense on why he hadn’t found them, even after combing through all the lists and footage and people. This makes the love and the pining for Steve have context and meaning, and maybe he actually has a shot. Like breathing, he’s always called it, and that explains why he’s always wondered what soulmate love was like if it was supposed to be stronger than this and he thought nothing could be stronger. His heart speeds up. Goddamn, he has a heart condition and this is bad for him.
Pepper knows him better than that though, and she cuts right through it. “This doesn’t change anything about you.”
That someone happens to be Steve, wearing light wash jeans that are almost even tighter than anything Tony's seen before and a red button-up that could be anywhere from ruby red to maroon with how the light is hitting it. It is also tight-fitting, but it isn't completely ridiculous, and looks just perfect between showing off those muscles and not. Tony wonders just who is in charge of Steve's wardrobe and his outfit choices, and if he wants to send them a thank you basket for helping him move on from khakis and old man plaid. Then again, maybe
"Chicken butt," Steve shamelessly quips, before walking in and then unapologetically picking Tony up. All of Tony's attempts to break away go ignored and unsuccessful. Steve doesn't even wince.
The press and absolutely no one has a word against Captain America. Well, besides neo-Nazis, but they're also neo-Nazis. Tony's not about to go and get himself called that by calling Rogers a dick. Hell no. Even, strangely enough, villains have no actual bad things to say about Rogers. They just want to defeat him and brag. Tony's not going to be the one tells them that Steve's like a spring; he'll never not pop back up. Even if it's annoying, and even if it's seven decades later.
"You're not denying it," Tony observes. "So there is someone. You know, you've been dancing a long time with me. Are you trying to play a jealousy card? Doesn't work too often, you know. Especially when you're with me; because then they'll think you're mine for the night."
Of course, he can't avoid Steve forever, or even at all now that they’re vaguely friends. For one, the jobs that they have make it impossible for that to happen. And for another, Steve is a goddamn stubborn bastard with no sense of social cues. Okay, maybe he does have social cues; it’s just that he doesn’t know anything about Tony. Nothing.
Natasha smiles at him sympathetically. He blanches, wondering what on earth he's done to deserve such a scary thing. Tony shudders as she says, "You're the host; tell him." She's completely dropped her bartender character. He doesn't to know what to think.
The man is punctual and planned and prepared and perfect and quick-thinking and responsive and responsible and reliable and strategic and serious and everything else that falls in that basket of a perfect soldier. Fury loves him, especially since he shows up to every single meeting/debriefing and actually does his paperwork, extensively. He doesn't miss a single work-related details and really doesn't stop working. On the rare occasion he's not working, Rogers is seemingly moping in SHIELD-assigned apartment that's incredibly pathetic.
As he says that, Steve pulls Tony into an elaborate Left Whisk that most people can't even recognize is a waltz step, unless they see it in the context of a waltz. He has to hand it to Steve for making a point boldly.
“Okay,” he says, and when Pepper makes a noise indicating she doesn’t quite believe him, he much more confidently repeats, “Okay. I have to—”
“From capamericaandnomad. Man, I’d devour that Dorito body any day, are you kidding me, question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark,” Tony reads, a bright and childish smile breaking out onto his face. Steve tries to take the tweet away, but Tony fends him off with his right hand continues on reading. “I’d at least lick it top to bottom.”
"The particular shade of his clothes is a little off from anyone else, but many would say it's a fairly common color," Steve says with a complete straight-face, and then Tony remembers two things. A, Steve has really good serum-enhanced eyes, and B, Steve is also an artist, so he knows what to do with all that sensory information.
“Haven't you figured it out yet, Tony?” Steve asks, his dark, tired voice doing things to Tony that really shouldn’t be done.
“You’re an enabling idiot,” Tony says, and when Steve turns to make a face at Tony, he almost turns a little pink at the fondness on Tony’s face that lasts for a split second. And then it’s gone, but Steve now knows what that face looks like. Very interesting.
“So why me, why tonight?” Kat asks, unaware that she had opened a can of worms that Steve had tried so hard to close just hours before with Tony. He hides his wince as best he can.
Just as he finishes his drink and plans to talk to Steve, he notices Steve chatting up some brunette (who he really can't see) near the billiards table. Both of them are talking and laughing at the players, and Clint's drunken determination. Tony really doesn't know how Clint's gotten better with a few drinks, but then again, it's also Clint. No one knows. Well, maybe Natasha. Natasha knows everything.
(god, he almost wishes JARVIS hadn’t found the file and the video, and he almost wishes Natasha hadn’t mentioned noticing something for a second, a little too late) and Steve fighting the Winter Soldier and someone having dragged Steve out of the Potomac.
“Only if you want it to be,” Steve says, finally peeling off the stubborn sticker. “Okay. Is Tony Stark... Italian?”
"Dance is a great workout," Steve recites, and from where Tony doesn't know. "So yes, I'm trying to catch up. Ballet is something, though. Real hard stuff, and I don't have the exact body type for it. Tap is fine, tap is good. Jazz is fun, unless I mess up. That happens a lot." He makes a face at himself.
kisser, so passionate, and it was like I melted right then and there in his arms, hoping that time would just slow down so I could—no! I’m kidding. It was kind of there.”
Somehow, he had gotten Natasha to tolerate him and smile at him, Clint to easily trust him (despite the fucked-upness the mind control thing), Bruce to let go some of that tight control around him, and Thor to follow him during the battle. In the month and a half later, Steve already had won everyone over, whether they realized it or not, and whether they wanted to be won over or not. Tony belatedly realized that included him.
“I—” Steve says, looking out into the mostly supportive crowd—since there are always a few people who hadn’t approved of the gayness of CotW. But that’s never mattered, not when he’s always had the support of one person looming over him. That’s all he makes before he bursts into tears; it hits him that his ma isn’t here to watch him. He sees the audience in front of him startle, but pays them no attention; half these people have seen him cry in Centre of the World anyway.
No one really thinks of Tony as a people-observant kind of person, and they’re probably right in doing so, but there are some things he pays attention to. Steve; Steve is just one of them, and Tony has known since Day Two or Three (hey, cut Tony some slack here; Day One was a mess involving aliens) that Steve wasn’t too comfortable or happy here. Tony really couldn’t blame him. But as time passed, and everyone made an effort to know Steve and Steve seemed to make
“I—” Steve says in automatic protest, but one look at Tony’s face has him quiet again, sucking in a breath and expelling it slowly. Tony lets go of him, stepping back a footstep or two, hands awkwardly untangling themselves from Steve. It isn’t until they’re gone that Steve misses their warmth. It isn’t until Tony musters up a smile, weak as it is for how concerned Tony evidently is still for Steve, that Steve sees the sadness in Tony’s own expression, the conflict and guilt on Tony’s face that he doesn’t understand. It isn’t until Steve sees the tightness in the way Tony’s eyes are crinkling with his fake smile that Steve realizes that he isn’t the only one mourning his ma. Maybe it’s hurting for Tony just to see Steve so visibly shaken.
It's maybe nine at night and people are just beginning to have fun and loosen up. There's alcohol flowing freely from the bar that Natasha has ever so graciously offered to work, people talking and laughing everywhere, a game of billiards where Barton would be fleecing the others had they been betting money with how well he's playing, music playing thanks to JARVIS working his coded magic, and everyone having a good time. Except Steve, now that Tony looks around for him like a good host. Because he isn't there, not yet.
“Steve pet a dog for ten minutes,” Tony says, smiling innocently when Steve groans and pretends to walks away.
She laughs, most likely about to change the topic to something related to Tony. “And what about you, Tony? All we know is that you’re playing an elusive pianist.”
Because tonight, Tony's at a charity gala that the Maria Stark Foundation is hosting—not to be mistaken for the annual MSFG or any of Tony's parties. Of course, all of the Avengers are now on the roster, as has been the normal for the past few months, but Tony no longer has a need to worry. Thor is off-planet and he's the only one prone to damage things nowadays. Natasha and Clint have made it a competition to charm as many people as possible (which is only good for him) and though it stemmed out of an argument on who has better social skills, Tony isn't going to get in the way of that. Bruce, whenever he comes, always manages to find a fellow scientist or science enthusiast and then spends the entire night talking science. He isn't here tonight though, bowing out thanks to a science conference. Steve, Tony has only worried about once and that was at the initial Avenger's post-Loki press conference because he didn't want to have to be stuck on cleanup PR duty. But after the first one, he had discovered Steve has incredible schmoozing skills, probably gained from being Captain America and being a showgirl. Steve is in no way shy when it comes to people, unlike what his reputation says.
"I'm counting that, by that way," Steve says, rolling his eyes, "But he knows because he caught me out on a date."
Silence reigned after Steve’s last four words. After what Steve deemed an appropriate time of tension-filled silence, he locked his jaw and looked down, as his character seemingly took the rejection. With an unhappy smile that fought its way onto his face, he took a step back. He was still shaking, and Steve recalled something he had learned years ago that it was much easier to internalize an emotion to induce shaking rather than fake it altogether. People were savvy, and could spot false emotions a mile away.
“Where's the tracker that's on me?” Rogers sharply asks, fishing out his phone from his back pocket. “It's yours, isn't it? It has to be yours, never mind, why'd I ask? Tell me where it is.” When he doesn't respond, Rogers's voice increase in volume as he demands, “Tell me where the fuck it is.”
“Where's the tracker that's on me?” Rogers sharply asks, fishing out his phone from his back pocket. “It's yours, isn't it? It has to be yours, never mind, why'd I ask? Tell me where it is.” When he doesn't respond, Rogers's voice increase in volume as he demands, “Tell me where the fuck it is.”
"Anyone with eyes wants to fuck him in that suit," Clint bluntly says. "But you want to get him every other time too."
Tony raises an eyebrow at the camera. “That is the face of a man who secretly has a few stories he isn’t sharing. I’ll find them out, one of these days, don’t worry.” He pulls off the next sticker though, and reads, “Is Steve Rogers married?”
Steve—bastard—cuts him off halfway and stands right in his way. "I've gotten to her already," he says, making sure that no one else can hear in the middle of the room. "Tough woman, by the way. I didn't think she'd crack."
Steve preemptively glares at Tony before Tony says anything. “Don’t you dare,” he warns, pointing a stern finger in the man’s way because he knows Tony too well to think Tony would keep his mouth shut if the alternative was teasing him.
Steve has always been a fiercely guarded, private person. It just so happens that he is currently one of the most popular actors in the world, fresh off another Captain America movie. Everyone knows him thanks to the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the success of the Nomad trilogy—that is, they know that Steve is decent at playing superheroes, heroes, and good guys in or out of straight rom-coms.
“Okay, okay,” she says after they’re done playing her game. They’ve just lost, since Tony somehow lost his graceful form and mannerisms within the timeframe of this game. Steve’s kind of miffed; he had thought that they were going to win easily. “I think we’ve skirted around the biggest question and shocking plot point that everyone has been talking about, the very same one that has launched you two and the movie into the spotlight.”
He hears Tony huff a laugh next to him, and still doesn’t look. “It was also tricky,” Tony says, his voice too strange. It’s... neutral? Fake? Chilling? “He’s not exactly the smallest person in the world, which meant pushing him up against that wall in one of the scenes hurt my arms. We had a lot of... wall scenes.”
The blond's expression is icy cold as he snaps, “Don't tell me Fury called me in; he gave me a mandatory two week vacation that's to be obeyed unless aliens attack. Sky's still intact and all, so that isn't it.”
Tony blew out another breath, but it was shaky, just as Dominic was losing his controlled composure. “No you don’t.” This was it; this was the point that turned Dominic Galan down a different path. Steve steeled himself. “If you
“Steeb,” he gasps when he thinks his face isn’t too red anymore. “Okay, I gotta be serious. Crap. I’m not even going to think about the other half; I’ll start laughing and I won’t stop. Okay. I got this. Okay. The questions asks why the background looks different. Um, you mean like...”
He stops short of saying something and then drops a bag of clothes and supplies to the ground. Steve shakes his head, thinking better of it and then pulls off his shirt, tossing it in a little basket to the side. He grabs a cotton tee, underwear, a pair of old man plaid pajamas, then heads towards the shower in Romanoff and Bruce’s room. All the tenseness from his body leaves in a wave that leaves Tony reeling in how much has changed.
Steve likes it here, Tony knows that much. Right now, as he’s sitting right next to Steve and watching the Hunger Games so that Steve and Thor can understand Clint’s nickname, he can just tell that Steve like it here. He can at least tolerate being here.
A comment pops up on the screen that throws him off. He knows that everyone can tell that he’s been thrown off, and what exactly caused that. Steve knows it’s nothing to be ashamed of, and
Characters: Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, OMC(s), Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton, mentions of Nick Fury, mentions of Pepper Potts, mentions of James “Rhodey” Rhodes
“Stuttgart Hall? Okay, it’s in, and I’ll have JARVIS update you? It’ll be alright, Tony. We’ll find them.” Pepper assuredly says.
"And that's not the right question," Steve smirks again. "When did I learn to dance, on the other hand..."
Tony really cannot believe he's being the reasonable one. Nevertheless, Rogers loses some of his tension, and he silently dashes upstairs, leaving Tony downstairs and wondering what the hell kind of day today is. When he finally goes upstairs, Rogers is nowhere to be found and the bartender just gestures out with a glare. Great; he's managed to piss this guy off too, and he made good drinks.
“No less a victim than my parents and Jarvis,” Tony merely shrugs, trying to play it off, trying not to show anything, and Stark men are made of iron, they don’t cry,
“Aw, babe, jealous?” Tony asks teasingly. But his expression sobers up pretty quickly. “Don’t answer that; I don’t want my heart crushed by your answer. But in all seriousness, I wish I could tell you how much fun it was playing the character. It took me a lot of convincing, I’ll admit that, but I don’t know why I hadn’t said yes sooner and saved Peggy, our Director, the trouble.”
"I think I'll let go of you for now," Steve says as Tony realizes that this song, whatever it is, is winding down. "Come find me if you've got another question. Promise I'll answer." He winks at Tony lavishly, and then they part ways, with Steve going to find a new dance partner, and Tony finding someone new to schmooze. Though really, they're both doing the same thing. "You have eleven questions left."
So Tony does, and he's proud to say that he can more than easily hold his own with Steve thanks to all of those dance classes when he was younger. "Why are you suddenly helping me with this?"
Steve’s piercing gaze suddenly turns on him, assessing him just like Natasha or Hill would. But unlike them, he isn’t cold or calculating and he isn’t trying to figure out how many ways Tony can be taken down. Steve’s looking for something deeper, and his look sets Tony on a fire that isn’t exactly bad.
"I think Thor would have liked him better," Steve says, wrinkling his nose at the memory. "More of a feast and fuck type. I thought it was a causal hookup, and then he brought me to a local restaurant from his apartment, so I was wondering if he wanted to date, but then we went back to his apartment and then I realized it wasn't so... that's five questions by the way."
Tony blinks as his eyes drift away from the clock and towards his empty stashes of coffee and his empty pot of coffee. He frowns. Great, now he has to go to the communal floor and get some coffee... without getting caught by one of any of the frequent night-prowlers or someone passing through or leaving the Tower. Otherwise he knows he’ll just have to face the wrath, or in Steve’s case, puppy eyes, of someone and lose against them telling him to go get some sleep. The '
out of this. And be sure to leave questions on my Instagram post, I’ll be answering a few of those as well that I hadn’t got to here!”
He can't also believe that there's a chance that his tracker and app system is wrong, though. It's impossible to think. He just thinks that Rogers being actually at End Line is harder to believe. So he drives, and he's grateful he never brings anything but the cheapest-looking cars to SHIELD on days where he has new missions with the team. The rich and the vanilla get eaten for breakfast at a place like End Line, so virginal Steve Rogers doesn't even has a chance.
, but, well, there's only three people on there he wishes could still be on there (and for that matter, also alive). That list, he thinks, may soon be expanded to hold a fifth person. Even if said fifth person doesn't even realize that they're on it. Mainly because they aren't here, at the tower, more often than not.
But it’s nothing surprising. Somehow, Tony has this way of making press and fame seem less stressful, like Steve’s anxiety quietens under Tony’s presence. Tony just makes Steve’s mind want to shut up and focus on him, his words, his flashing smile, his dazzling words, his expressive eyes that communicate
“Whoa, Steve, what?” Tony asks, and before Steve knows it, he’s as close as enveloped by Tony’s arms as Tony can try. He’s an ugly crier, so he feels bad for Tony’s suit. But that doesn’t stop him from heaving into Tony’s shoulders, trying to make himself as small as possible to fit.
"Yeah," Tony says, because his mind cannot function with how close Steve is to him and how much hotter he looks up close. "That's fine." He makes a prompt exit, lest he lose his cool, and saunters over to Natasha. She already knows what he wants, and he just waits while he thinks.
,” Steve said in challenge, rolling Tony’s character’s last name over with the tip of his tongue in a way that he couldn’t even attempt to with Tony’s actual name, “But you were good at it, at lying, once upon a time.” He let his eyes fall down to Tony’s lips, one of the written blocking steps in the actual script since writers just loved to torture him, and said, “One of the best. I miss you.” He flickered his eyes back up to Tony’s again, teasing.
The Avengers have all been invited to some governor's (senator's?) party that Fury makes them all go to, on pretense of staying on their favorable side. Tony hates it, hates this, hates that he couldn't even put up a fight because Fury had left before he got a word in. Lucky Thor; Thor always seems to miss the boring Avengers PR events.
Steve couldn’t manage to hold in his smile for that one. “Thanks,” he says. Then he turns to Tony and adds, “This was also the Nomad movie look, the scene when I first walk in all angsty. I had a lot of people scream at me on Twitter for it.”
Thank goodness she skims right over the dog and into the movie, something he can easily talk about. “Well,” he shrugs, “That’s what everyone told me, you know? I was actually discouraged from taking the role by a lot of people because it just wasn’t me or like me to even pretend to be someone like... my character, but Peggy was insistent. Truth be told, I really wanted a change of pace and it all lined up really well.”
"Well, we are headed towards your bedroom," Steve says as the elevator doors open and he steps in. "For something that's probably better for you than sex."
"Can we play 20 questions on who it is, then?" Tony asks, because Steve is indulging him this when he's
Steve founders for a second, but in that same second, Tony picks up for him. “Do people really say that? I’ve always viewed the relationship as a heavier one. Even if Rogers wasn’t a serial murderer, and I wasn’t one of his victims, it’s not healthy. If it was just sex, then Rogers and I probably would have been alright, could have walked away and brushed off the dust, but turning it romantic made things unhealthy. Saying that our love story was a love story in the first place, let alone a good one, kind of... it’s a dark, blurred area, I think. It’s kind of like a game, and relationships shouldn’t involve people toying with each other.”
He isn't listening, and almost misses the end of the board meeting, had it not been for his mind trying to find an out to this dreadful thing. Tony stands up in joy and practically dashes out the door as dignified as he can. He is completely aware of the fact that he probably doesn't have any, at least not to these people, who have seen all of his public ups and downs. And Pepper, well, she was there for the private ones too.
Tony fares a lot better than Steve does, or ever will. But it’s fine, because Tony catches Steve’s hopeless look and winks. Before he can turn pink, Steve looks away and flashes one last smile to the cameras.
Tony flickers his attention over to Natasha, not wanting to be any more obvious, and sends her a seductive smile that both of them know means nothing. "Why don't you do me wrong? I bet it'll feel right." With that stupidly cheesy line, he stifles the urge to grin at himself and break the game Natasha's playing.
And just when Tony can't be anymore surprised by the fact that Steve sometimes does ballet and tap, he says, "But the salsa! Tango! Samba, rumba, jive, bolero, those are all lively!" His excited face changes into one of amusement when he continues on with, "And then someone at the place I go to tried to tell me that I should learn how to belly dance. I'm starting to wonder if everyone thinks that I don't know what I'm doing."
"I didn't think you were the type to play chicken, Rogers. If I win, I feel like you should go find this guy.”
"Where did you learn how to dance?" Tony asks, because he's been dying to find out where Captain Save The Dance has had time and the ability to learn. He couldn't ask before, because that would ean admitting that he's been watching Steve dance, but now he can. "You're not half bad."
“If you had to kiss your best friend on screen in front of twenty people who thought it would be funny to watch you stumble a scene, you have to find some humor in it to stop yourself from fucking up the scene in anger,” Steve points out, though he’s never been such a damned liar. There had been no humor in him trying to control his libido during the entire scene, just general lust. The only reason he had started to laugh because Tony and him had finally pulled away and he thought it was just so funny that he had throughly messed Tony up for this one scene. “Oops, can I swear?”
showed up here randomly, asking specifically for me.” The way he says friend, almost like a double entendre, coupled with his previous words of charging money for people finding him, has Tony's mind spinning with possibilities that are all very, very unlikely. And yet, he can't help but think that Rogers's very presence here is unlikely, why not what else he's thinking?
that he doesn’t have to even acknowledge it if he doesn’t want to, but maybe he should. He has a voice to use. And he can’t give off the wrong tone by ignoring it; everyone knows that he’s seen it.
Steve smirks and shakes his head. "Your Pepper-ordained 'must socialize' list. I've been going through a few people who are lower priority on it, but then Lucinda Reyes got me for a dance, so I thought, why not?" He looks like he wants to say something else but, then apparently sees something out of the corner of his eye and then stops talking.
"Modern dance? Are you caught up there?" he asks. "Or is are the worlds of hip-hop and contemporary confusing?"
