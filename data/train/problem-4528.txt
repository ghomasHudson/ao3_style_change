And waits, and waits. The rippling line is no longer visible.
Instead of snapping at him, Cas gives a defeated sigh and says, “Maybe I should.”
at him again, Dean wants to soak up as much of him as he can.
Taking a breath, he opens the door slowly, peeking inside. There’s a small entryway with a set of stairs going to the second floor of the cabin. A rustic wooden chair next to the banister has a metal briefcase sitting on it, but there doesn’t appear to be anyone actually inside.
He hands the elephant to Jack, who grabs it immediately. “Can you watch him for a sec, I’m gonna go grab Sam’s gift,” he says, zipping the bag back up and storing it on the floor.
One of them, a woman with long blonde hair that sticks wet to her forehead, shakes herself out as she walks onto the beach, stretching her arms over her head with a groan. “I can’t remember the last time I had to shift,” she complains. “Does it always feel this restrictive?”
But if he laughs now, he thinks he might puke, and he’s not sure if it’s because of the concussion or because of the way he’s
When Cas comes, it’s with a groan of Dean’s name, and Dean can feel it hot and wet, filling him up like fire. Cas leans down and sucks a bruise into the thin skin over his pulse, stubble scraping over the tender flesh, marking him. When he’s finished, he carefully pulls out and leans down to kiss Dean, disentangling their fingers gently.
Exhaustion sweeps over Dean and pulls him into sleep before he even realizes what’s happening. The last thought he has before drifting off is that he should tell Cas he loves him.
“You said he saved you. That he summoned the Empty. But you didn’t… how did he do that, Dean? How was he able to do that?”
to get ahold of himself. He blindly pulls out eggs and milk from the fridge, then turns to rifle through the pantry for a box of pancake mix, putting a pan on the stove to preheat. “How does breakfast for dinner sound?”
Sam shuffles next to him. “There was -- was some kind of power surge, I think. I dunno. And then, well.” He gestures at the monitor. “This started happening.”
angry, dammit, angry and scared and helpless--
“You get used to it,” one of the other two replies. He’s tall and has dark skin and a wide, handsome face, lines at the corners of his eyes showing maturity and experience in his gaze. He turns to the third, a slightly shorter balding man with a bit of a paunch. “After a while, it’s like taking off and putting on a favorite coat, right, Zachariah?”
“Just some texting,” he mutters, shoving his hands in his pockets. “We talked on the phone a week or two ago, and I mentioned doing lunch again, but he blew me off. Again. Said that when he’s not working, he’s sleeping, and that I need to mind my own business, basically.”
“She’s finished?” he asks, gaze focused on Dean’s hands. “That was fast.”
Cas’ mouth twists in an amused smile. “No, that just about covers it. I didn’t plan anything because I wanted to make sure you had the chance to relax. You’ve been pretty stressed out lately.”
Something inscrutable passes over Dean’s face. “There’s a key?”
“Hey, that’s cheating! Uh, I mean,” Dean stutters, “it would be cheating if I had a favorite. Which I don’t. Like I said, more Sam’s thing.”
“Dean,” Castiel says, or tries to, but Dean cuts him off with a shake of his head and another step forward, nearly chest-to-chest now, Dean’s soft gray robe open.
When he turns back around, Castiel is indeed wearing the clothes. Dean notes, a little hysterically, that his thighs seem to be testing the limits of the sweatpants. “Great!” he says, and he knows he sounds manic but maybe he can blame it on sleep deprivation. “There’s some clean towels in the bathroom if you wake up and want to take a shower, and you’ve got some pillows for the couch and the blanket, so you’re all set.”
One of the security guards comes over to where he and Cas are on the grass. A couple of nurses follow him, rolling a stretcher with them.
Someone enters and everyone’s heads turn, he’s called over to different tables, dropping by to say hello to everyone who calls his name:
“Good.”
Then he smiles.
you have to say it
“Mmm.”
“Knew it,” the guy spits, storming in closer. “Fucking queers coming into
“I did.”
“There is no such

should probably cool it before you start some shit, alright?” The bartender looks at him with a hard stare that he can’t quite read. “It’s not that kinda bar.”
Heckles up immediately, Cas tries to contain himself. This is a human, an asshole, but just a human. “My partner is just in bathroom and then we’ll leave.”
, you know them. Their faces hold the same weariness, their clothes practical or incongruous by design, masks and costumes and performances, all finally relaxed. So relax.
“Want me to stop?”
“Bingo,” he grins, holding up a small, clear bottle. “Close call. You okay?” He notices Cas’ expression, unable to look away from the bottle. He sits on the bed heavily. “Is this too much? Fuck, I thought- We can do something else-“
. Dean becomes acutely aware of where they’re touching: the burning handprint on his shoulder, the weight of Cas’ actual hand splayed across his back. The hard points of their kneecaps. The softness of their thighs as they move closer. When did they start moving closer? Who went first? But Dean’s head is swimming with alcohol and lust;
But he stops abruptly because Dean is pulling his clothes off - more specifically he’s taking his trench coat off, but the general statement still stands. Cas takes over when it’s clear that Dean is not going to get off of his arms, and the Hunter sits back, grinning.
“I gotcha,” he tips his chin understandingly and gets to work.
-” he repeats the word with the same intonation that she did to see if that helps the situation. “-has had a lot to drink, but we mean no trouble.”
Nothing has ever felt as right as kissing Cas does, even though his technique is sorely lacking and they’re both still dressed and they’re
. By the bright light of his phone torch, Dean rummages through his bag, throwing shit on the floor like he’s not the one who’ll have to pick it all up.
“I’m older than you,” you say, or slur, or think.
It takes a second for you to realise he’s talking to you, by then all three of them have their attention on you, openly appraising you. You wonder what they read in your posture, your face, the way you’ve ripped a paper napkin into tiny shreds.
He sighs. “The men in the bar, they seemed to think-“ Why can’t he just say it? “They took a disliking to me.”
You gasp before you can stop yourself. An Angel of the Lord, walking on Earth, living above a bar instead of Heaven. He’s nothing that you expect. Tall and commanding, but different from Dean and Sam, the same, but somehow very not. His eyes are bright and intense, as blue as the deepest sky, the bluest eyes you’ve ever seen, a blue that you never thought possible until right this second. You feel as if you should look away, as if seeing beneath a hair covering, something sacred and prized, something that is not for public consumption, only God’s eyes. Only Dean Winchester’s eyes. What is the difference now? Is this bar paradise? Where is the divinity in craft beer and crude hunters, clawing out a life on the edges of society, wading through the horror in the hope of retaining peace, but not for yourselves. Nothing is for yourself.
“Don’t worry about it. I would’ve called you over if I needed you that badly.”
A few days later Dean is sitting on the balcony, enjoying the warm weather now that spring has finally come, when his phone buzzes, rattling loudly on the glass table next to the wicker armchair.
Dean can’t see Castiel behind him, but he can hear his voice growing closer and closer still until Dean can feel the heat of Castiel’s body behind him. “Now, would you like help finishing those cookies?”
Dean frowns. Who the fuck is Alfie?
It only takes a few minutes before his phone chimes and Dean smirks to himself.
He had thought it would take more time to heal, that he wouldn’t be ready for another relationship for quite some time, but Dean makes him feel secure, and a whole barrel full of emotions he hasn’t felt in a long time.
“Come on, Dean. You can do it. I know you can.” Castiel tugs Dean’s hair again and dives back down to bite bruises into his neck. “Paint yourself with your own come.”
He has to break the kiss to breathe, but Castiel follows him, mouthing at his neck and nibbling against the soft flesh there. Dean tilts his head to give better access and his gaze lands on a woman who’s eyeing them from a bus stop across the street.
“No,” Castiel admonishes and Dean looks up at him through his lashes. “No swallowing, just hold it. That’s all you have to do.”
In the quiet peacefulness of his bath Dean’s mind threatens to bombard him with memories of the previous day, drawing up images and feelings he’d much rather forget. He hums to himself until his thoughts quiet and the only sound is the echoed sloshing of the warm water in the tub as he moves.
“You’re ridiculous.”
“Of course I’ll notice. Now let’s go to bed. I need to get as much of you as I can before you leave.” Dean lets his hands wander lower, grabbing at Castiel’s ass and pulling him close.
“Well, at first I was going for Sammy, so I just chose something that I knew I could get a job out of and make decent money, so I started in accounting. I’m pretty good with numbers and money after having to budget what little we had growing up, so I thought it’d be as good a job as any. I wasn’t unhappy in the program, but I could tell after the first year that it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I kept with it though, because Sammy comes first.”
Dean doesn’t want Castiel to go easy on him. He’s been seriously missing the SM part of BDSM, something he doesn’t want to bring up to Castiel. But now it looks like he won’t have to.
“Sounds like you had everything planned out.”
Dean hears Castiel’s voice, but he can’t stop. He has to prove that he’s worthy of Castiel’s time. Has to prove he’s good enough to keep around. But he’s a bad submissive that can’t even deep throat properly.
He hadn’t meant for it to just slip out like that. Dean’s never been the first one to say ‘I love you.’ In all his past relationships he waited for the other person to say it.
Alastair ignores him and winds up, landing the first strike unforgivingly across the crease of Dean’s ass.  Dean’s cries only last through the first twenty or so before his voice gives out. He loses count before Alastair is done, weeping silently into the mattress, now wet with tears, snot, and drool.
The spoon he’d been using to scoop fried rice clatters against the plate as Dean turns to face Castiel. “I thought we covered everything already.”
“Put it on me,” Dean blurts. “Please, Castiel.”
Dean’s not sure he’s going to fulfil Castiel’s fantasy of wearing nothing but panties, but he does leave the store with enough for every day of the week. Just in case.
“Cas,” he breathes, barely a whisper as he looks up through red, puffy eyes.
Dean focuses all of his being on Castiel after that. His body is being bombarded with so many different sensations that he can’t shut down like he normally does during these performances. He is painfully aware of everything happening to him as Alastair raises red welts over his back while the machine keeps driving into him.
The fingers withdraw from his ass and he feels the blunt head of a dick press against his slick hole. Dean shuts his eyes so tight he sees white spots in the blackness.
“What’s your safeword?” Castiel asks.
“Can we order something for dinner first?” Dean asks, “There’s no food in the entire apartment and I haven’t eaten all day—I’m starving. Then we can talk while we wait.”
“Castiel is nothing like Alastair.” Dean can’t help the venom that seeps into his words.
“Are you telling me or asking?” Castiel’s voice is a deep growl as he holds Dean’s hips and pulls him up, drawing almost all the way out, and then plunging him back down in one smooth motion.
Dean moans around the fake cock in his mouth, slobbering around the length of it as it slides further past his lips.
“What about before Alastair? Did you have any of these feelings then?”
Dean looks at the menu for the first time, scanning the pages for something he might like.
“Absolutely beautiful,” Castiel whispers. He traces the rope with his finger, coming to stand in front of Dean once more to admire his handiwork. “How does it feel? Is it too tight anywhere?”
, Dean texts back.
“It’s not as easy as you think, Cas. I’ve been with him for nearly four years, and—”
Dean walks hand-in-hand with Castiel through the forest, the constant chatter of birds accompanying them on their way. They hear a woodpecker or two and Castiel swears he saw an owl, but Dean only saw empty branches in the distance.
Dean laughs as he types:
And then everything streams back into Castiel. He sits up in a rush and immediately doubles over, groaning and willing himself not to throw up on the lady’s shoes.
Castiel sits up and looks at the clock. “Oh. Well, I’m almost done. I’ll just be a few more minutes.”
CAS: Dean.
Dean’s glad for the little boxes that let him add comments so he can make a note that he likes to be called ‘good boy’ and the like, but not derogatory names like ‘whore.’ He also makes sure to note his enthusiasm for spanking, hair pulling, giving head, and being restrained.
Castiel glances up at him with a raised eyebrow. He had called to Dean that it was time to leave nearly ten minutes ago, but Dean had still been trying to decide on what to wear.
Even over text Castiel’s praise still affects Dean. It makes him smile as he ladles soup into a bowl.
“You looked amazing in those panties. I’ve never had a panty kink or anything, but I think seeing you in them that night may have changed that. You don’t have t—”
“Okay,” Castiel agrees, but makes no move to retreat to his own car.
“Oh, Dean. What I want to do to you is going to take well over forty minutes.”
He reaches for the fly of Castiel’s pants but jumps when Castiel grabs his hands. His eyes dart up to Castiel’s, pupils overtaking the blue. “Stop,” he says firmly, sending shivers through Dean, and yeah, he can’t wait to see this side of Castiel in full effect. Powerful; commanding; dominating. Dean shivers again just thinking about all the things he wants Castiel to do to him.
“Uhm, I’m pretty sure this isn’t a self-serve kind of place,” Charlie says as Dean presents the cappuccino.
“At the very least it would have put me in a very embarrassing position. So I had to sit there, even after the meeting was over, waiting for everyone else to leave so they wouldn’t notice that my brat of a boyfriend got me hard during the meeting.”
“Dean?” There’s a thud and a muffled curse from the other end of the line followed by a door banging shut. “Dean, what’s wrong? Are you okay?”  Castiel’s voice is panicked and it makes Dean’s stomach turn. He shouldn’t be bothering Castiel like this. When he finds out why Dean’s calling he’s going to get mad at him.
Rough hands are on his ass cheeks, kneading and spreading him wide. Alastair clicks his tongue disapprovingly as a thick, calloused finger circles Dean’s hole. “Too bad you didn’t follow my instructions, pet. Because I’m not prepping you any. I’m not going to lay a single finger on your defiled body tonight. You’ll be at the mercy of anyone here who wants to try out one of your slutty holes.”
Dean doesn’t say anything, too focused on Castiel’s fingers playing with the hem of the ugly shirt. Cool fingertips brush against his stomach beneath the fabric and Dean gasps, eyes darting over Castiel’s shoulder to the short hallway that leads back to the store filled with other people shopping.
“And Dean?” He had been about to disconnect the call when Castiel speaks again and Dean almost drops his phone.
“Would’ve been last call before you finally ordered somethin’,” Dean quips.
“Fine. I just told him I’ve got my eye on him so he better not hurt you.”
He used to spend days at a time without leaving his apartment. He’d hole up on the couch rewatching old episodes of Doctor Sexy. If he didn’t need groceries there really wasn’t any point in going out. The only thing that got him off the couch was quick bathroom breaks. Sometimes he would make a nest of blankets and pillows on the couch and sleep in front of the TV. And he would sleep a lot, napping in the middle of the day even though he slept for twelve hours that night.
The voice berates him as he tosses the rest of his breakfast away. Only weak-willed men need to vent their feelings to some shrink.
Warm air wafts across Dean’s chest when Castiel chuckles. “Another time, perhaps.”
Shrugging, Dean says, “Sometimes I’m just not hungry, or I don’t feel like eating. Sometimes I forget to eat, or…”
Castiel nods and leads the way, pausing in the doorway to look down the hall. Thankfully, there’s no one in sight. He turns back to Dean, who’s huddling close behind. “There’s a fire exit at the end of the hall. The alarm will go off as soon as it’s opened, but it’s our best bet right now.”
“I guess, yeah.”
He feels like an ass now. Castiel is dealing with his own shit, stressed at work and having to deal with Dean’s shit on top of all that and here Dean is whining like a child about not getting enough attention. He shouldn’t have let Castiel talk him into staying here. He’s nothing more than a burden.
“That’s one minute, by the way,” Castiel says from behind him.
“That’s wonderful, Dean. And how did it go?”
Castiel opens his mouth to speak, but the waiter comes back then to announce their orders got mixed up in the kitchen and will take another little while. He places a platter of deep fried pickles in front of them as consolation for the delay.
“Neither of us has been tested recently, so yes, really.”
Dean chews on his lip, but shifts and moves to sit up.
“It’s not that I think you’re going to hurt me,” Dean says, “I trust you. It’s just that sometimes my brain forgets you’re not—” Dean turns away from Castiel, unwilling to voice that thought.
Dean’s not sure what to make of that. He doesn’t know if it’s a good or bad thing he’s lasted longer than anyone else.
“Dean, I think—”
“No, it’s not, is it?”
“He’s…” the woman hesitates and Castiel risks the shooting pain to straighten. The comforting coolness of the woman’s touch vanishes as she draws back. Castiel rolls his shoulders and that hurts too. “He’s okay,” the woman says finally, “They, uh, continued after you blacked out, and Alastair—”
“Are you all right?” Castiel reaches out a hand to steady him but pauses just short of touching Dean, unsure.
Dean pants shallowly against Castiel’s neck, running his hands up underneath the sweater to caress heated, sweat-slicked skin. Castiel hums quietly and continues peppering kisses to Dean’s neck and collarbone.
Castiel helps Dean up off the kitchen floor and holds him steady as he gently removes the grains of rice still embedded in the skin of Dean’s knees. Dean is shaking as he watches Castiel. He lifts his hands to see that they’re shaking as well, though he doesn’t understand why.
“Castiel!” The man from the window greets them at the door. He’s all limbs as he hugs Castiel.
Escaping from Alastair was only step one. Dean still has a whole bunch of stuff he needs to work through in order to move on.
“Funny, I thought the same thing when I saw you come in.”
“I see you haven’t missed me at all.”
It’s game night. Dean meets Castiel’s friends and learns some things about his past. Then their extended weekend comes to an end and Dean faces the reality of job hunting.
Dean tries to move carefully, but when he lifts his leg up to get onto the bed the plug jabs into his prostate and makes him choke on a breath. He struggles for a moment with figuring out how to get up on the bed with the plug inside of him, but eventually makes it onto the mattress, lying down on his back.
Dean knows Garth is joking, but his words still twist his stomach into knots. One of the first things Alastair did was cut Dean off from his friends and family and Dean hadn’t fully realized what was happening until it was too late. It makes Dean sick knowing he was doing that to Castiel, even if it had been unintentional.
“Goodbye, Dean,” Castiel says, and the warm hand slides down his face and squeezes his shoulder lightly before he turns.
After a minute Castiel lowers his hands slowly and says, “I’m going to go change my shirt. Are you okay?” Dean nods. “Okay, I’ll be right back.”
Dean slips off the oven mitts, rushes to the door and presses a finger to the call button. “Hello?”
Dean sighs and starts the Impala, listening to the engine purr as he pulls out of the apartment complex.
Dean follows Alastair into the bedroom and his gut wrenches when he sees the restraints hanging from the bed. He’s not sure he can handle an intense scene today, but he still obeys his Master when he’s ordered to lie on his stomach. Hesitation and disobedience mean punishment. Alastair climbs on the bed after him, securing each wrist to the headboard by cold metal handcuffs.
Dean thinks, eyeing Castiel over the top of his menu. The thought sends little butterflies fluttering about in his stomach. He’s enjoyed the soft touches from the man up until this point, has enjoyed every second they’ve been together, but he hadn’t considered the possibility of a relationship.
Dean only looks up and locks eyes with Castiel, doesn’t need to look down to see the evidence of how affected Castiel is right now, can feel it pressing against him insistently. Castiel’s eyes are blown wide, and a fine sheen of sweat dots his forehead.
Only one minute?
The gashes from Alastair’s whip have healed quickly, at least. Castiel’s salve was truly magic and now the crisscrossing marks remain as stubborn, itchy scabs to remind Dean of his failure as a submissive. He’s just glad that they don’t open and bleed everywhere anymore.
Castiel said he wanted to be Dean’s boyfriend more than his Dom, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t be both, right? Dean isn’t really sure how a relationship like this is supposed to work. The only one he has for reference is what he and Alastair had, and he knows that’s not what a Dom/sub relationship is supposed to be either, so he really is in the dark.
Okay, I do want Sabriel and I’m going to write a spin-off of this with Sam and Gabriel and their budding relationship so stay tuned for that!! Don’t worry if Sabriel isn’t your thing, I won’t get into that in this fic. There’s only one or two chapters left here anyway, but if you’re jonesing for more DeanCas goodness, I’m going to do single chapter oneshots of these two in this universe and each chapter will have them exploring a new kink. Lots to look forward to!
Castiel offers him a small smile and caresses his cheek. Dean leans into the touch.
Part of Dean knows that Castiel is just concerned, and that part is glad to have someone actually care about his well-being, but another part of him, the part that’s currently winning, fuelled by alcohol and anxiety, is annoyed that Castiel is acting as if he has control over Dean. He’s a grown ass man and doesn’t need to be taken care of.
“Of course.”
“I want you,” Dean tries, hoping it’ll satisfy Castiel enough to get them moving to the bedroom. But Castiel just stands there and pins Dean with his unwavering stare.
A hand smooths across his shoulders, down his back. “Relax, Dean. You don’t need to be so rigid.”
“All right, fellas!” The waiter announces his presence, “Food’s finally here. I apologize again for the delay. One Rock N’ Roll burger,” he places a plate in front of Castiel, “And one Google It.” He places the other plate in front of Dean. “Anything else I can get you? Hot sauce? Ketchup, Mustard? More beer?”
Castiel has to pick up his pace to catch up to Dean. “They said ‘up to two weeks.’ It likely won’t take that long. The last time I got tested the results were available in less than a week.”
Garth is a little strange. But strange in a good way. Dean can see them becoming fast friends. He’s glad to be getting along so well with Castiel’s friends, like he could actually be a part of their group, like he found a place where he fits.
“And what, sweet boy, did I tell you?” Castiel withdraws his finger and Dean huffs into the mattress, annoyed at the loss.
“Would you feel the same way about the whole thing if it had been Alastair in Castiel’s place?”
The grip on his wrist holds him in place. Dean tries to pull away, but can’t. He’s trapped now. He can’t escape the punishment that’s coming. He pulls again and the grip is gone.
“Yes, because I think it would be beneficial, but only if you are willing to give it a chance.”
“Hi.” Castiel tilts his head after a moment. “Are you going to invite me in, or did you plan to have dinner in your hallway?”
“Watch it,” Castiel grumbles, but the smile on his face lets Dean know he’s not really offended by the comment.
The man arches an eyebrow at him. “No?”
“The only thing causing my concentration problem is you constantly interrupting me.”
Too soon Alastair is adding another finger and Dean hisses in pain, trying to step away only for the hand on his shoulder to tighten. He likes the rough burn and stretch usually, but Alastair always takes it a step further. The fingers turn more aggressive and Dean bites his tongue to keep from crying out.
“You can change your limits at any time, Dean. If we ever do something and you don’t like it, we never have to do it again. If you decide one of your hard limits is actually something you’d like to try out, then that’s okay, too. Nothing is set in stone.”
Dean has his own way of dealing with the traumas of his past. Are they healthy? No. But it gets him through the day.
One of Alastair’s lackeys has to lift him out of the stocks and Dean drops to the come-covered floor when his legs can’t hold his weight. He shivers on the stage as come dries in patches on his body.
“He’s still in school. He’s gonna be some bigshot lawyer soon, though, working all the highest profile cases and winning each one. He wants to help the people who can’t help themselves, wants to see all the evil in the world put behind bars, and wants to do it all himself. I’m pretty proud of him.”
Dean groans and rolls his eyes as he admits, “Castiel only has my well-being in mind with this rule.”
“It should be numb right now, but the damage is pretty serious. I’ll put the rest of the lotion with your clothes; you can take it home and re-apply it in the morning.”
“My filthy cockslut. You’re just a warm hole waiting to be filled with come.” His cock twitches in Dean’s ass and he grunts again. Dean can tell he’s getting close. “Say it. Say you’re a filthy come slut.”
“Yes, you did, and you need to tell him that you’ve had too much to drink to participate in a scene tonight.”
“Sorry.” Dean stretches as he yawns. “I didn’t mean to fall asleep.”
the responsible one now?”
A loud bark of laughter startles Dean, and Castiel covers his mouth with a hand in an attempt to quiet himself. “Oh, I can assure you I had absolutely nothing in my life figured out. I changed my major five times during my undergrad.”
“Like I said: I’m down for whatever.”
He leans over so he can growl into the man’s ear. “Touch me again and I’ll break every one of your fingers.”
Dean watches as Castiel’s eyes go wide in shock right before he hears the sickening
Having no problem following orders now, Dean is moving before Castiel has finished speaking. He carefully lowers himself in the middle of the rice pile, hissing in pain as he rests his full weight on his knees, making the grains of rice dig into his skin. Dean shifts, trying to get comfortable, but it just grinds the rice further into his knees.
Dean catches up with someone from his past as Castiel’s absence looms over everyone.
Castiel is still missing and Dean is struggling with the inability to do anything. When given the opportunity, will he be strong enough to save Castiel and himself, or will one or both of them fall prey to Alastair’s plans?
Dean frowns. “No. Cas wouldn’t do that.”
Dean holds his hands to his chest. “Wanna keep ‘em on. Just a bit longer.”
“Do you want to know what I had to deal with while you were here being a tease? Disobeying me. Breaking rules.”
Dean tries to say, “I’m sorry,” but his words are garbled around the dildo and he’s not sure whether or not Castiel understands.
He slowly comes back to himself and opens his eyes when he feels the presence of another person, but relaxes when he recognizes the bartender from earlier. He hands Castiel another glass of orange juice and something else, taking the empty glass and leaving without a word.
“Mmm, yes, but what else?”
Dean rubs at the back of his neck as he sits up. “Not really, you just make me feel…”
After dinner, they’ll drive to pick the Impala up from the club, maybe stop and grab a pie for dessert on the way home that they can eat while they watch the historical documentary Dean picked out. They’ll cuddle on the couch and Castiel can finally forget about work. Or maybe they’ll forget the documentary altogether and Dean can distract Castiel another way. A much more fun way, in his opinion.
Dean can see a blush colour Castiel’s cheeks as he fingers a fry on his plate. Seeing Castiel be the sheepish one for once reassures Dean. He likes the calm, collected, in-charge Castiel, but this side of him is undeniably adorable and now Dean’s not sure which he likes more.
He wants to drag Castiel off his stool and into the grimy bathroom at the back of the club, wants to push him against the wall and kiss him so hard he tastes blood, wants to sink to his knees on the damp floor and fucking worship Castiel. He wants to take Castiel home and spend all day in bed getting fucked in positions he didn’t even know existed. He wants bruises in the shape of Castiel’s fingers that bloom pain whenever he even so much as thinks about them. He wants—he stops himself short. He shouldn’t want any of that. Shouldn’t want to bleed for this man he barely knows. Shouldn’t so readily want to debase himself.
“Have I only been good at kissing because of
There’s a trickle of water slowly traveling from the edge of Cas’ temple down the side of his cheek, and Dean can’t tear his eyes away from it. “Glad you’re havin’ a good time, buddy,” he says weakly, willing his heart to stop pounding so hard in his chest. Everything’s fine. Cas is safe. All Dean has to do is go change into his actual trunks, drink beer, and flip a few burgers later. He’s
“Yeah, but it’s got, you know… umami, or whatever. Sweet and salty.”
2. Jack’s confession
Dean waves over his shoulder as he walks out of the diner, the door jingling loudly as it shuts behind him. The cold winds of late autumn sweep down the street, making him flip up the collar of his jacket around his neck. He runs a hand down his face, exhaustion making a home for itself in the space behind his eyes. They burn and prickle slightly in the chilly air and he blinks rapidly to stop himself from tearing up.
“Okay, I’m in the back room. Nora can show you.”
Sam responds almost immediately.
“Me too,” Dean says, turning down the street for the Gas-n-Sip. It’s large yellow sign glows brightly above the street. “Hey, I’m about to park, so I’m going to hang up now.”
That kiss would have been enough to drag him to the Empty.
A horrible prospect crosses his mind, and he knows Cas is thinking the same thing at the look of shock that flashes across his face.
“I can see if there’s anything else Sam could try --”
“Yes, there will be. But I don’t know exactly what they are. So you have to stop them. Now.”
They need to leave, Dean knows this, but something has cracked inside him and needs to be let out. Maybe it’s Purgatory, maybe it’s just him, but it makes him say, “Cas, I need to say something,” and he’s ready, he
going to leave again, he knows. Nothing about Cas’ expression makes him believe otherwise. Dean would save himself a lot of trouble if he just ignored him.
(When Sam gets back an hour later, the chair is still in pieces on the floor. “Dean? Cas?” he calls, worried. “Everything okay?”
There’s a part of him that knows Sam probably didn’t mean it, but it’s a quiet part, buried underneath worry and hurt and a few more complicated emotions that Dean really doesn’t have the energy to deal with right now. He and Sam have always known how to push each other’s buttons, and Dean
Cas chuckles and shakes his head. “Right, of course. You wouldn’t be caught dead watching something like that.”
There’s an exhausted pounding starting at the base of Dean’s skull, his brother’s words burrowing deep under his skin. He knows Sam means every word of what he’s saying, and that… that might make it worse. Because it means that he’s convinced himself this quest for power will have a good ending, when he should know from experience that’s not true.
“Because I can change the world, Dean!” Sam shakes his head like a dog throwing off water, agitated. His eyes are feverishly bright in his pale and drawn face. “The work we’re doing could open doors and unlock mysteries, and figuring out how much power we’re capable of channeling is the first step. The experiments Rowena and I have been doing, they’ve taught us so much --”
He nods. “Okay,” he says, and that familiar mix of hope and despair that is so unique to his relationship with the Winchesters rises up within him. “I’ll stay.”
Cas’ lips are chapped, his stubble scratchy against Dean’s cheeks, and it’s not quite right until it is, until their noses bump and Cas tilts his head just enough to line up their mouths.
, only to be replaced by a strange numb panic, because Cas’ eyes are back on his and he takes a deep breath, tension wrapping around his throat and squeezing, because this is his
idea to be kissing Cas right now, after Cas left him behind, after Cas showed up at his apartment spouting cryptic messages of dire consequences, but Dean doesn’t really give a shit right now. Because he has his hands buried in Cas’ hair, Cas’ stubble scratching against his cheek, and after two months of thinking he’d never get to have this again, it’s like drinking water after walking through the desert.
“Found it,” Dean says. “I can hold onto it for now if you want.”
“I said leave!” Sam shouts, whipping around, gaze furious. “I’m… I need to get back to work. I need to clean this up.” Suddenly his shoulders slump, like a puppet whose strings have just been cut. “What I’m doing is important. I just wish… I wish you’d respect that,” he says, then turns away from Dean once more.
“Nah, we were waiting for you,” Dean says, eyeing his brother over. It’s the height of summer, but Sam is pale and his face looks creased, like he hasn’t slept properly in the last few weeks. His movements are slower than normal when he picks up his menu and looks it over, but his red-rimmed eyes seem strangely bright. Dean knew he’d been working hard on a new project with Rowena, but he hadn’t realized
“I guess that makes sense,” Sam says, face edging back towards constipation again. “And you’re sure it’s because you have magic, not that you’re a non-human of some sort?” He looks to Dean, who shrugs.
world back, but there’s no guarantee about the other worlds.
“Night, Dean,” Sam says. “Eileen said she’d make the bacon if I made the eggs for breakfast. You gonna join us?” It’s an olive branch between them, extended without expectation, and damn if Dean doesn’t love his little brother so much it hurts sometimes.
And after Cas’ last words to him, right before he disappeared? Dean knows that sometimes you just have to face the music. It’s pretty clear where he sits on the totem pole.
The pancake is definitely charcoal on one side. “Shit,” Dean snaps, tossing it into the trash can. “Dude, how much magic do you
Cas shrugs. “Nineteen or so, I think?”
“Well, yeah. I mean, the hospital isn’t exactly the best comparison to make, because work there can be a little more seasonal than you realize. People go nuts during the summer, when the weather is nice and you can spend more time outside. Winter night shifts can be pretty boring, but summertime is a challenge.” Dean blows out a breath, shaking his head absently. “The stories I could tell, honestly. Let me know when you work your first night shift, I’ll try to stop by during it and help keep you awake.”
“Well, Dean found me injured in an alleyway. Who knows what kind of person I may be to have ended up in that situation.”
“I do.” Dean waves at Benny as they walk out and head to the Impala. The early spring sun is high in the sky at this point, and while it’s still pretty chilly out, being in the light is nice. Cas seems to think so too, as he lifts his face to the sky and takes a deep breath. He blinks a few times, like he’s just come up for air and is blinking water out of his eyes, and a strange look crosses his face.
sent Dean into a private meltdown when Cas had first tried it on. So what if the navy color brings out Cas’ eyes. Just another thing about him that Dean has made a
When he passes Eileen and Sam in the kitchen, he just waves and says, “Going for a drive.” Sam looks like he’s about to ask questions, but Dean just keeps going, walking with purpose. He slides into the Impala, settling into the familiar dip in the seat as he turns the car on and throws it into drive. She rumbles down the cracked asphalt of the highway, crunches over dirt and gravel until he pulls her to a stop in front of calm, shimmering water, the sun turning the surface of the lake a deep blue-green.
“Hey, no sleeping yet,” Dean says, putting the kit on the coffee table and snapping it open. Castiel startles awake again, his eyes focusing on Dean immediately. Even with the (more than likely) concussion, he’s sharp, Dean has to admit. His gaze feels like it’s peeling Dean apart layer by layer, letting Castiel peer inside to his very core. It’s unsettling but exhilarating at the same time, and, shit, Dean realizes he’s been staring back for way too long.
“Add it to the list.”
“Hallmark is more Sammy’s thing than mine. You two can have a cheesy rom-com marathon when Christmas rolls around. I’ll drink beer and be, you know,
And then someone claps, loudly, from outside the cabin. Dean jumps, heart pounding wildly in his chest, before realizing that it hadn’t come from behind him, from where he’d come in -- there’s someone on the other side of the building. Closer to the water.
to Dean. Like there’s time to fix things later, and they can deal with this first.
that hard up. Cas may be ridiculously attractive -- only a person without
Dean looks down at his half-eaten burger, still hot and steaming on the plate, surrounded by Benny’s perfectly crisp fries. His stomach feels leaden. The thought of trying to eat anymore makes him want to puke a little bit. “Sorry,” he apologizes, “I’m just not super hungry at the moment. Think I might’ve eaten a little too much for breakfast.” Lie. “I’ll eat two burgers the next time I’m here, to make up for this one.” Another lie.
Cas sips at it and sits down at the table. For a moment, Dean looks around the room, then goes and grabs a folded blanket hanging over the back of the couch and drapes it over Cas’ shoulders, tucking it around his body. It probably doesn’t actually help that much, now that he thinks about it. At least Cas doesn’t immediately shake it off.
? Sam, what have you been
“Yes,” Cas says, and a smile tugs at the ends of his lips. “I think it does, too.”
“It’s possible,” Dean says and unlocks the car door. “If you’re from around here, that’ll make things a lot easier. Guess you’ve never been to Benny’s diner though, since he didn’t recognize you,” he jokes.
“Goddammit,” Dean snaps, ending the call and flinging his phone down onto the seat next to him. He’s tried to call Sam over a dozen times in the past twenty minutes, and has left three different voicemails; even with Sam ignoring his existence, he would’ve picked up after the third consecutive call. They always did, in case it was an emergency.
At this moment, though, everything seems to be going right, and Dean should probably be suspicious about that, but he’s finding it hard to care. Because Cas is laid out before him on the bed, shirt unbuttoned and hair a mess from where Dean’s been running his fingers through it. He’s straddling Cas, working their hips together in short, jerky thrusts as they kiss, and they’re both still wearing their boxers but it’s fine, it’s amazing actually, the heat and pressure growing exponentially between them, the friction just this side of
of this process, which is huge! I’ve been poring over the data we’ve been sent, and looking at magical energy readings that we thought were next to impossible to achieve. But it turns out, maybe not! Because so many people and creatures harness that energy nearly every day!”
“Yeah, he’s got enough clothes for a week, so I’ll definitely do laundry while we’re there. And you know Eileen wouldn’t move in somewhere without a washer and dryer within fifteen feet of their bedroom.” Dean unzips the duffel, searching through it for Jack’s favorite toy, a patchwork stuffed elephant. Without it, Jack would be absolutely inconsolable for the entire trip, and Dean really does
But Cas is looking at him with an open gaze for the first time in months, not clouded with hurt or devastation or anger, and maybe Dean’s getting too old for this shit but he thinks he recognizes it for what it is: a door that’s been opened just a crack. An invitation.
And Dean --
Castiel blinks and tilts his head a degree, but then his smile grows wider.
she responds, and Dean quickly taps out his new address and sends it over.
He gets the final number a few hours later, when things have calmed down enough that he can take a quick break for a cup of coffee. “Fifteen patients all came in with sudden blindness,” Dr. Jeffries, the on-call ophthalmologist, tells him. “
Castiel makes a small snarling sound, and Dean glances up in surprise.
Charlie doesn’t take the hint and continues her line of questioning as she pours the popcorn into a big bowl. The smell of fake butter permeates the room. “So what way is it like?”
Cas is looking at him, eyes lingering on the taut line of Dean’s throat, dipping down to the hint of collarbone, traveling back up to the curve of his cheek. Dean is suddenly extremely aware of how his lips must look, wrapped around the mouth of the bottle, and it sends a hot pulse of want through his stomach. He sucks on the bottle, just lightly enough to hollow his cheeks, and watches as Cas’ eyes darken, fingers tightening almost imperceptibly around his own bottle. Dean lowers his beer, purposefully lets it spill a few drops of amber liquid to pool in the divot of his lower lip.
a toddler on a plane?” Dean asks, unable to resist poking at him.
With a huff, Dean puts a hand on Cas’ back and pushes him forward. “You and Sam can put a meeting on the calendar to discuss your dating life, Rowena,” he says. “If you don’t mind, can we talk about what we came here for?”
thing that’s ever happened to him. “Well, when you put it like that,” he grumbles, and sits up. It may not be the worst, but it might make the short list. At this point, though, even the short list of bad things that’ve happened to him is getting pretty damn long. He sighs again, drops his head into his hands. “I just want this to be over,” he admits.
Dean considers how quickly he could suffocate himself with one of the pillows on his bed currently. Not that long, probably. Hell, with the way things were going, he might even be able to actually do it. Or would he
There’s not much time left, Dean knows, but he doesn’t care, because there’s time enough for this. Time enough for him to step back and run his eyes over Cas, take in the bloody gash on his head, the slump of his shoulders. The slight smile that lifts the corners of his lips as he tells Dean that the leviathan blossom got a little smushed but it’s okay. Time enough for Dean to realize that they did it, that
Next to him, Cas hums unconsciously, slightly off beat with the song, staring out the window as the street slips by. He does that a lot, Dean’s noticed, almost like a soft echo of whatever music is playing. He didn’t know any of the songs Dean made him listen to at first, but he always cocked his head to the side, listening intently as he picked up on the melody or the driving rhythm. It didn’t take him too long to start the strange humming habit, which Dean should probably find annoying but mostly finds endearing.
“Wow, what a fascinating discussion,” Charlie deadpans. “Give me the remote, I get to pick the movie tonight since you two are wasting time.”
He’s come back to Dean, after he’d thought Cas gone forever.
After feeling over the entire ankle and foot, Dean nods and gives what he hopes is a reassuring pat to the man’s… shin. Right, this dude is still naked. “Well, your ankle isn't broken, just sprained pretty badly,” he says, trying to keep his tone light and positive without letting on about any awkwardness. “If it’s okay with you, I’m going to take a look at your head now, and then we’ll get you somewhere warm so I can take a look at your ribs, okay? I just need to make sure that you don’t need a brace for a head or spinal injury before I take you anywhere.”
, his mind says, and he shuts that shit down fast) and then driving six hours home in one stretch, running on adrenaline the whole time. It didn’t help that Lee’d probably given him a concussion when he’d knocked him out back in the salvage lot. There was a tender spot on the back of his head still, throbbing with the beat of Dean’s pulse, and it drowns out whatever else Sam is saying until Dean can hear nothing but blood, a bassline that won’t go away--
His heart constricts in his chest, and he tilts the bottle back, taking a long drink to distract himself. That’s the kind of sappy bullshit he’s not sure he’s allowed anymore with Cas, not since their fight. Purgatory had patched up the major tear between them, but Dean knew there were still jagged rifts and cracks between them that needed fixing. And it was on him. Cas seemed content to let things lay as they were, for the most part. To let Dean figure out where, and how, to take that first step forward.
Dean looks up as a plate with a cheeseburger and a small mountain of fries is placed in front of him, catching Benny’s frown as the vampire slides across the booth from him. “Still ain’t heard from him?” Benny asks, sliding ketchup and vinegar bottles across the table to Dean as well.
Dean says, “Holy shit, hold on --” or at least, that’s what he
Not that he regrets making the deal for Jack’s life. He could never regret that, not when it saved Jack from an immediate eternity in the vast nothing of the Empty. No, what Castiel regrets is that now Dean is burdened with this knowledge, too. That now Dean will look at him and see a dead man walking, and know he can do nothing about it.
The brass sign on the door glints in the late morning light, declaring
Dean laughs. “As far as I can tell, we’ve got nothing but time. Unless you’ve got a surprise schedule I don’t know about, I wasn’t planning on doing anything except sit on the beach and try not to get sunburned.”
Cas nods. “Yes.”
“Please,” he whispers into the air between them, “please, Cas.” His skin feels too tight, like he could explode at any minute. “Want you.”
Packed and ready to go, you linger by the door, wondering, briefly, what the rush is. Why do you need to leave today? What is really waiting for you at the other end?
what that like, he just knows that is it. Someone taps on his shoulder and Cas spins expecting Dean. It is not Dean. It’s one of the men; a guy a bit older than Jimmy is now, greying in his rough stubble, adorned in a permanent baseball cap and ill-fitting shirt stretched over his beer belly. He’s even drunker than Dean.
“You never actually asked if I was a Hunter.”
But tonight you’re safe behind the warding and in front of a bar with a surprisingly pretentious beer menu and burgers that come with avocado and the word
“Game over kiddo,” Claire comments when you sit up suddenly. “Past your bedtime.”
“And Claire?”
Both stripped down to their underwear it’s hard to ignore the reality of the situation, that Cas and Dean and their very male bodies are pressed against each other and that they
he’s horny. Even sober, he would’ve struggled to recall the last time he’s gotten off with anyone other than his right hand and
“Very smooth. Filling.”
God, you’re so tired, it’s a tired that sinks you into the ground, that makes you blood slow and your heart sticky and blinking a dangerous game. You want to see the end of the episode though. You don’t want to miss a moment.
“Neither. I mean, once, I’ve done it once, but I didn’t- I did the- Not the- you know.”
“Was-“ You swallow and finger the pin that Dean gave you. “Was that your kid?”
“Hey, you and your
And then the picture shifts. Castiel turns and you see a child, old enough to walk, but small enough to get away with demanding not to. It’s balanced on the Angel’s hip like it belongs there, like his body (is it his? Who did it belong to? Are they still there? Did they ask for this?) was made to hold it there. Dean ruffles their hair, their ambiguity is intriguing, refreshing for the Hunting community. Youth is a clean slate, you are never more full of options, full of potential, which slowly seeps from you as your choices narrow, as life demands decisions, assigns decisions, weighs you down with expectations and being perceived, an object for perception rather than existence.
Dean chokes on his tongue. “They- They thought- That- That we’re-“ He motions between them. A thousand facial expressions cross his features and none of them are in the normal Dean Winchester vocabulary. “Wow. Why? Why would they, uh, would they think that?”
“Wait,” he leans back in and undoes Cas’ top button. The cotton of his shirt feels extremely thin, Dean can feel the heat of Cas’ skin through it, and fumbles clumsily with the little pieces of plastic. “Now you don’t look like a fed… much.”
” he uses his fingers to make air quotes around the word. He laughs, but it’s a grating, sad sound. “Fallen.”
He grunts appreciatively, his gaze flickering over his shoulder. You notice the bands on his fingers. Silver, you assume pure, but it catches the light in a way that isn’t quite right, you stare at it. He twists it with his thumb, an unconscious habit, a soothing touch, a comfort. Even a Winchester needs comforts. It’s a comfort in of itself.
Cas sighs loudly, his side-eye sharper than any of the knives in Baby’s boot. “What does it matter?”
He’s never wanting anything less than for Dean to stop devouring him, to not finish the show between his thighs starring his lips, full and wet enough to glisten in the half light. But he also wants more. He knows that Dean wants more.
“You’re the only one.”
That catches him off guard. “Not as much as I used to.”
“With the bees?”
His mouth is warm and soft against Dean’s back. It seems to be the best way to soothe the hunter and Cas wonders if he’ll allow it in the sunlight. Or if they’ll go back to only touching each other when one of them is bleeding.
There are pockets of people throughout the bar: loners like you, pairs and trios quietly nursing their sustenance, groups crowding round tables, pulling chairs from elsewhere or standing when there are none free. They’re loud and joyful and free. Is it better to have a crowd? Is it enough to be adjacent? You’re not sure you have the energy to socialise, to make nice, maybe next time.
It’s Cas’ turn to not let Dean speak. He claps a hand on Dean’s shoulder and spreads his wings, instantly transporting them from the bar to their motel room. When they land, Dean’s knees give way and Cas catches him instinctively, holding him close until the hunter’s head stops spinning. They’re warm against each other. Hearts beating hard. Panting from the adrenaline of the moment. He helps Dean to the bed, keeping a hand on his back long after the need for support is gone; if Dean registers it, he doesn’t protest.
“Every county.”
Cas leans against the Impala, squinting in the bright winter sun at something in his hands. He packed up the car while Dean checked out; their case neatly wrapped up, the monsters slain. Business as usual.
, it’s fucking incredible. Dean threads his hand into Cas’ hair, something he’s imagined doing it a thousand times; usually when he’s drunk and lonely and Cas looks at him with those beautiful eyes and he imagines that he sees something in them- Guess he wasn’t imagining it after all, huh?
Being in a bar in the morning feels wrong, the grey light filtering into the room that’s already too lit, too exposed. Somehow it feels inviting though. A couple of people are already in the room, sipping out of big mugs with plates piled with toast and pastries and even cooked food. Who’s the chef here?
“And Jack?”
He doesn’t wait for Cas to answer. It seems to be a pattern tonight; Dean is on a mission, moving through decisions and ideas and sentences like a shark, afraid of what will happen if he leaves enough breathing space for Cas to actually engage in conversation with him. He talks about the hunt, about the victims, about Sam being out west with Eileen, about the motel, about the bar, about he silent football match on the fuzzy tv. Cas is a celestial being and he’s barely able to keep up with all the topics and references and allusions that Dean manages to cover between sips of his drink.
The rest of the men stand from their seats, bloodlust in their eyes as they glare at Cas.
“In the time it took me to piss? Jeez, Cas, what did you do? Fuck their wives?”
“I- I think- I might-“
“Coffee, please, lots.”
- opened a bar around here. It’s already ridiculous, considering the things you’ve heard. Only half of them can be true, mostly the half that you can reconcile with your understanding of the truth.
For the first time in… well, you can’t even think about it, you sleep well. As soon as you crawl into bed, curled under the heavy duvet, surrounded by warmth and softenss, it creeps into your brain and takes away the tension from your body. You don’t even think to check the room for warding or make an escape plan, the assurance of safety here is like the knowledge that the sun will rise tomorrow, to doubt it seems like an insult to you and the universe. Maybe there is gentleness in the hunting life, a tender hand of comfort and understanding that will offer quiet and healing and rest, between the blood and guts and bones and death. Life.
Your family is somewhere, out there, maybe where you left them, what’s left of them. Dean picks Jack up and they dance to the song on the radio, some sugary pop song that makes Jack laugh in that infectious toddler way and you get to witness the Dean Winchester sing all the words, perfectly. This isn’t the Dean that ruled Hell or Purgatory or Earth, that was the Hunter and the bow, the sword to Castiel’s shield, that fought the Devil and God and the every other cosmic entity. Could
is getting too long. You can’t remember anything left that you can do, that doesn’t conflict with an imperative for self-restriction. Where do you have to be? Who is expecting you? What is your next move? Why are you even questioning it?
“I’m sure he’ll ask for help if he needs it.”
That earns a derisive snort from Dean. “Yeah, that’s bullshit.
Nick frowns and tuts, pulling a small black notebook and pen from inside his suit jacket, flipping through a few pages. He scratches something off one of the pages, then makes a show of shutting the book and slipping it back into his pocket. “That’s so disappointing,” he says.
“But why!”
“You guys starting a medical practice on the side?” he asks, looking over the monitor. It sits on a rolling cabinet, making it easy to move around; it’s the heavy-duty kind used in Dean’s hospital that can deal with the latent magical energies many magic users possess. “Thought you were too busy with whatever you’re currently working on.”
Castiel doesn’t respond, still frowning. Dean lets him be: it’s been a hectic day already, with Dean dragging him all over town. Even with his rapid healing, this has probably been a little too much for Cas to deal with so soon after being injured. Guilt twists in the pit of Dean’s stomach at that thought.
Charlie leans around to take a look at Cas’ sleeping form. “Aw, what a little angel,” she whispers with a teasing smile, and Dean chuckles.
Dean raises an eyebrow and says, “Excited? Mostly she just seems tired. And crabby.”
He’ll make sure they get through the rest of their errands today fast, and then maybe introduce Cas to the wonders of
Dean is tired of being angry. He wants to be
“This way is faster,” Cas says from behind him.
Like he knows what Dean’s thinking (and who knows; maybe he does, Dean wouldn’t put it past him), Castiel shifts, hitches Dean’s hips up higher, folds him in on himself so they can press their lips together. Cas kisses like it’s a battle he plans on winning: all teeth and tongue, expansive, devouring. It leaves Dean gasping as Castiel moves to his neck, biting the thin skin over his pulse, sucking marks that Dean won’t be able to hide later. He kisses the dip between Dean’s collarbones and moves back up, hands finding Dean’s wrists and holding them to the mattress, twining their fingers together, nosing at the space between Dean’s jaw and ear. He sucks another mark there, grinding his cock in deep, and Dean throws his head back against the mattress with a shout, cock jerking and drooling against his stomach in the space between their bodies.
“Yeah,” he nods. And leaves.
Cas turns his hand over, clasping Dean’s and squeezing it, his eyes soft as he looks at Dean. There’s still doubt lingering in his gaze, but he gives Dean a small smile. “You’re a good man, Dean Winchester.”
and his eyes had burned, but he didn’t cry, not in front of Sam and Chuck. Because Cas gave his life for Dean. Because Dean asked him to stay, and he did, and he
Dean raises a bottle of beer to his lips, leaning against the long table where his family’s names are carved. There’s a solid contingent of empty bottles next to him, lined up like soldiers as he’s methodically finished them, one after the other. They’re not really doing much for him, but Dean went through the last bottle of whiskey the other night while he held a knife in his shaking hands and painstakingly wrote out Cas and Jack’s names. He doesn’t really have anything stronger on hand, unfortunately.
“Yes. Please, Dean.”
There’s a shuffling sound from the other end of the line, and then Charlie says, “I’ll get a tracker up and running, but you gotta tell me what’s going on, Dean.”
Charlie gapes back at him. “Dude. Star Wars? Luke versus Vader? Light versus dark? It’s a cultural touchstone! Have you never seen it?”
“I feel fine.”
“Whoa, what?” Dean startles, moving over to Cas’ side and putting a hand on his shoulder. “Dude, you can keep staying with me. I’m not going to kick you out or anything, I swear.”
, but his mouth won’t form the words. Cas seems to understand, though, laying back down beside Dean and gathering him into his arms. He presses his lips to Dean’s sweaty temple, warm and familiar.
Dean’s hands clench the destroyed skin. “I’m so sorry,” he says again.
“That would never happen.”
Dean slumps back against the ground in relief. The claw marks on his leg sting, but he can already tell they’re not that deep.
1. The key to Death’s library
He’d missed this so much, missed the feel of Cas’ lips on his, their stubble brushing together, the… sloppy wetness?
“Other than your head, which isn’t actually in pain.”
“Yeah, alright,” Dean says, exhaustion settling into his bones like a weighted blanket. “I’m gonna take a nap first, though. You should… you should stay, if you want.” He swallows hard against the sudden lump in his throat. Asking Cas to stay shouldn’t be difficult, and yet…
The shitty motel bed creaks beneath them, sounding like it might give out at any moment, and the headboard is banging against the wall. He doesn’t care, though, not when Castiel is filling him up with every thrust, splitting him open, making Dean gasp and moan and rake his nails down Cas’ back, spread his thighs wider. “Please,” he hears himself beg, ripped out of him involuntarily, “c’mon, Cas,
“Um,” Sam says, looking after her with concern. “It’s been a rough 48 hours or so. Lucifer was -- I think she’s taking this kind of hard.”
It’s the same clerk working as the last three times he’s been there, but fortunately she doesn’t say anything to him, just rings up the bottle of Jack and puts it in a bag. There’s no one else in the store, which Dean guesses is pretty common for two in the afternoon on a Tuesday. God, he can’t wait to crack into this bottle when he gets back from work later. If he’s lucky, he’ll drink enough to sleep through most of his unwanted vacation. He leaves it on the counter in the kitchen, ready and waiting.
And then promptly trips over a discarded book, cursing as he tries to regain his balance without breaking his fucking elbow,
Inside the workshop, Sam leads him to the alcove where the modified monitor Dean had set up sits, a comfortable chair now adjacent to it. The monitor is on, but the display looks like it’s fritzing out, the multicolored lines for heart rate, oxygen levels, and the rest appearing jagged and cut off as they run across the screen. The small secondary screen, the one Rowena had installed specially, is completely blank, although it seems to pulse with a dull gray glow every few seconds.
Heat crawls up the back of Dean’s neck; he knows that it’s obvious he’s nervous, but he didn’t think it was that bad yet. “I hate planes,” he whines, sinking down. His knees bump against the seatback in front of him; the occupant, a teenage girl with red eyes, turns around and bares her fangs through the gap between the seats.
Dean squeezes the hand wrapped around the steering wheel and says, “I’m still here, only a minute or two away. I’ve got some meds for you as soon as I get there.”
It’s the night before they leave, and Cas suggests they go for a walk on the beach. The moon hangs full and bright in the sky, casting plenty of light across the sand and waves, and Dean agrees, wanting to get away from rinsing more sand out of bathing suits for a bit. The night air is just beginning to turn chilly, a breeze dancing off the water and ruffling their hair as they walk and hold hands. The seasons are turning, and Dean is grateful for this last bit of summer here in Southern California. It feels like a moment frozen in time.
They order pizza for dinner and stay on the couch with Dean’s head in Castiel’s lap, talking quietly while they wait for their food, and Dean can think of a dozen places he wants Castiel’s fingers more than in his hair, but for now he’s content to sit peacefully on the couch with his boyfriend.
“I don’t mind. You must’ve needed the extra sleep.”
“Scotch with a splash of water,” Dean orders, pointing to the man next to him, who looks up at the sound of Dean’s voice and places the sticky drink menu on the equally sticky bar.
he loves you, Cas. You’re the first person who’s paid him any attention in years. This is exactly like last time. What he’s really feeling is gratitude. And that will fade and he’ll leave, but by that point you’ll be too attached and I’ll be forced to pick up the pieces yet again.”
Yeah, Dean isn’t about to argue that. Still, though, he’s a grown ass adult. He shouldn’t need anyone checking up on him; he should be able to take care of himself.
He kicks off his shoes and heads straight for the kitchen, grabbing containers of food from the fridge to dish out a pile of spaghetti that threatens to spill out of his bowl. He heats it up and brings his dinner to the living room so he can sit with Castiel while he eats.
He makes sure to fold his clothes neatly and does his best to kneel in the perfect position.
“What happened?”
Castiel squats down beside Dean when he stops fidgeting and lines the dildo up with Dean’s mouth. Dean parts his lips to accept the silicone dick, but Castiel smacks it against the wall and Dean blinks as it remains there. He hadn’t realized it had a suction cup.
“Please,” Dean moans as Castiel breaks the kiss. He tries to capture Castiel’s lips once more, but he’s pushed back until he’s resting on his heels again.
“About Alastair beating you to death?”
Dean mumbles something under his breath, refusing to meet Castiel’s eye.
Castiel is staring at him with wide eyes, his mouth slightly agape before Dean’s words fully sink in and he’s breaking into a wide smile. But Dean still has business he needs to deal with before he can take part in Castiel’s excitement.
Dean glances over his shoulder at Castiel. “So you’re not mad at me?”
Dean doesn’t want to move. He wants to savour this bliss for as long as possible. That was the most intense orgasm he’s ever had. All the teasing and waiting was worth it if it meant an orgasm that strong every time.
Once he steps into the apartment and shuts the door behind him Dean breathes a little easier. He sits heavily on the bench in the entryway, meaning to take off his boots, but instead just staring at the wall in front of him.
Alastair’s voice draws Dean’s attention again. “And here I thought I was through with you. I thought you’d finally been broken beyond repair, and then you go and surprise me.” Dean glares at him. “Look at that face. That is not the face of a broken man: I’ve still got work to do.” The smirk on Alastair’s face can mean nothing but trouble for both Dean and Castiel.
Dean takes a deep breath to center himself as he steps out of his underwear. He looks back towards the bar, eyes locking with Castiel as he sinks slowly to his knees, legs spread, hands clasped behind his back, pushing his chest out slightly. He focuses on Castiel as he waits, eyes following every movement, watching as he shifts in his seat, as he sips at a glass of water, as he watches Dean kneeling on stage.
They stop in front of a store with half-naked mannequins in the window, all modelling fancy-looking underwear and lingerie sets. Dean can put two and two together well enough to figure out what Castiel is getting at.
“Mmm,” Castiel hums, “If it means I get to keep you shirtless all the time I’m never going to stop licking and biting your nipples.”
“That settles it, then.” Dean takes the DVD out of Castiel’s hand. “It’s entirely unacceptable that you haven’t seen the Swayziest of Swayze movies.” His joints crack when he squats to put the disc in the player.
“Really?” Castiel crosses his arms over his chest. “Because since I’m the one who scheduled the appointment, mine is the number on file and I got a call from Doctor Pavlovská this afternoon.”
“Great. I’ll go call her now and see if she’d be willing to take you sometime this week.”
“Cas?” Dean croaks, his voice rough with sleep. “What is it?”
Dean nods and feels his cheeks heat when Castiel orders for both of them. “I’ll have the Rock N’ Roll burger, and he’ll have the ‘Google It’, both with fries.” They hand their menus over to the waiter and he retreats with their orders scribbled hastily in his notepad.
All the alcohol in his system is having the opposite of the desired effect. It makes his heart beat faster, makes him sweat and his mind race. Dean’s breath is coming in shallow pants now. Sitting so close together at the crowded bar he can smell the scotch on Castiel’s breath, feel every little shift in position, limbs brushing together in the cramped space, and it’s overwhelming.
CAS: Italian sounds good. What did you end up getting?
Dean’s body is on fire, and he’s gasping for breath. He can feel his abused cock, half hard, hanging between his spread legs. He doesn’t want to look out at the crowd, doesn’t want to see the faces of the people judging him.
Dean blushes and sips at his coffee. “Maybe.”
The sounds of Dean blowing Castiel fill the otherwise quiet room and Dean blushes at the loudness of it. He’s displeased that Castiel is silent above him, save for his rapid breathing and the occasional low groan. He wants his sounds to be completely drowned out by Castiel’s reactions.
Dean tilts his head to try and see what Alastair is doing, but only sees his back as he opens the closet that holds all his supplies.
He feels physically sick as he washes his body in the shower, thoroughly scrubbing over the scrapes and bruises that mar his skin. The steady stream of hot water washes away the suds Dean had spread across his body, over all the darkly coloured marks.
Dean’s grateful, he is, but he can’t even leave the apartment because Alastair might find him, and staying inside with nothing to do is driving him insane. At least before Dean still had the freedom to go to the grocery store.
When Dean is situated lying over his lap Castiel runs a hand over Dean’s smooth flesh.
“Dean.” Castiel says his name like he’s in physical pain and Dean is the source of it all.
By the time Dean sees the text, it’s past when he was supposed to be done at therapy. He can’t tell Castiel that he bailed; he had been so happy when Dean said he would go.
Dean isn’t giggling when he has to sit on a red ass during dinner, which ends up being frozen pizza instead of tacos, both of them too tired after their impromptu round of sex to finish cooking.
Castiel stops and turns to Dean. He sighs and puts the knife down, leaving a bell pepper half-chopped on the cutting board. “You heard that, huh?”
Castiel shivers at the light touches. “You didn’t ask.”
“What?”
“But I like buying you stuff. I like making you happy.”
He wipes the sweat from his brow and types out his reply.
Dean’s never been in Castiel’s room before. The door is usually closed and he’s only gotten brief glimpses inside. It seems forbidden to be in here and he takes a moment to look around.
Castiel gets situated between Dean’s legs once more and pulls Dean’s feet to wrap around his waist, lifting Dean’s butt up off the mattress so he can pull out the plug and slide himself in.
needing to be fixed.”
“Please, Castiel,” he says, “
He didn’t feel like talking about Sam. Or thinking about Sam. But now he can’t quiet his brain. So he texts Castiel, hoping to distract himself and his one-track mind.
Castiel pulls Dean close, tracing a gentle finger along his cheek. “She will.”
“The food will be here in forty minutes,” Castiel says, eyes flicking to Dean’s lips, “How will we ever pass the time?”
Castiel pulls Dean close, sliding him onto his lap and into a kiss, smiling as he speaks against Dean’s lips, “I said I love you, Dean Winchester.”
“Whatever,” Castiel huffs in mock anger and rolls his eyes but can’t keep the smile from his lips.
“As in
CAS: I ordered a vegetable panini from the restaurant at the hotel for lunch. Work is paying for all my expenses so I also ordered the most expensive cocktail on the menu.
DEAN: Too late.
Dean follows behind him a minute later, sinking down on the closed lid of the toilet as Castiel fiddles with the knobs on the tub until it’s the perfect temperature.
“Did we just find real-life Snow White?” Dean whispers to Castiel.
“I can’t.” He never had to ask when he was with Alastair. It was always a given that with Alastair came pain, but Castiel is gentle by nature.
“Other clubs have a drink limit?” It had never really occurred to him before. He’d always had at least a good buzz going before any of the performances he and Alastair did to help settle his nerves.
“It’s not normal,” Dean repeats.
“Does something amuse you?”
He bites his tongue to keep from screaming as pain shoots through him. He can hear cheers from the crowd but everything is drowned out by the sounds of his pathetic gasping, unable to catch his breath as the machine pumps into him. Tears leak from his eyes, and he doubles over, resting his head on the padding in front of him. The angle doesn’t really help the cock currently dragging against his insides, but the cool leather feels good against his cheek. He gasps in shallow breaths, trying to regain his composure. Trying to be good.
“Four days?!”
The scuffle has drawn the attention of nearly everyone in the club. Heads turn to watch the altercation play out but none of them step in. Dean has never hated this club more.
“After that I switched back to undecided so I could take a wider range of classes and figure out what I liked, then said fuck it and went back to Philosophy, got through a semester of that before having a nervous breakdown because I kept picturing myself homeless, thousands of dollars in debt with a useless Bachelor in Philosophy. I went home during winter break that year and found myself walking by the old bookstore and it finally clicked for me. I changed my major as soon as the next term started.” Castiel takes a long sip of his drink, and then says, “Sorry. I went on kind of a tangent.”
As they eat Castiel’s praise of the food and Dean’s cooking skills is constant and Dean soaks in it. It’s been so long since he cooked for someone and it makes him swell with pride that Castiel is enjoying it so much.
“I wasn’t. Well, I moved away after graduation and I just moved back a few weeks ago.”
this, more than I’ve wanted anything in a long ass time. And I don’t want to let this slip away. I don’t want to lose you. I want to give this a shot, I want to be happy damn it and I’m so bad at this and I’m just rambling nonsense like an idiot.”
Dean hadn’t realized how hungry he was until the smell of Szechuan beef came wafting down the hallway when the delivery guy came out of the elevator. His mouth waters now as he stares down at his full plate and he’s glad he’s sitting on the floor so Castiel won’t be able to see him scarf down dinner in what is sure to be a very unattractive manner.
Dean dives back in, taking Castiel to the root. He tries to swallow around him, but the length slides into his throat and he gags instead and has to pull off. He splutters a bit, but doesn’t miss the choked noise that Castiel makes. Fuck, Dean wishes he knew how to deepthroat.
“Talk to me.”
Dean turns back around to finish plating their dinner and to hide his blush. “Not to rain on your parade, Cas, but those don’t exactly sound like punishments.” Well, except for the cock cage one. He can’t remember the last time he went so long without an orgasm.
Dean nods.
“You said you were going to tie me up and make me beg for it.”
But once they get home Dean can’t seem to sit still. He wanders between his room, the kitchen, and the living room. He sits on the couch with Castiel only to get up a few minutes later and go to the kitchen, standing there staring at the contents of the fridge.
“Doms can drop too?” Dean understands sub drop: he’s experienced it enough firsthand and knows that it happens because of endorphins and whatever, but Doms dropping? That was something he had never even considered.
“Up.” Alastair pulls Dean by the hair until he’s standing. “Stay,” he orders, and Dean feels him step away.
“Yes, Master.”
Castiel reaches out, but Dean backs away from his touch. “What do you mean?”
DEAN: And I need you to pay attention to me.
“I do, however, have rules,” Castiel continues, “If you agree to them.”
It ends up taking hours, plural. Dean sits next to Castiel while he works at his desk in the living room. They chat and spend time in each other’s company, but Castiel’s attention is split. Still, it’s better than being left alone in the apartment all day with no one to keep him company other than his thoughts, so Dean can’t really complain.
The heavy weight of Castiel’s gaze is overwhelming. Dean feels him watching, knows the bastard is probably smirking at his struggle. That’s all right, Dean thinks, he’ll wipe that smirk off Castiel’s face soon enough.
Dean finds him sitting on the floor in front of the shelf, mulling over two movies in his hands. Dean watches as he moves, his knitted sweater shifting and revealing a sliver of tanned skin that appears even darker against the cream of the wool.
“You’re so good,” Castiel says as he applies more of the ointment and works it in. “You were so beautiful up there.”
After a moment Dean nods in response, the chain clanking loudly behind him at the movement.
They order in for dinner, flipping through the various menus Castiel has in a pile in the kitchen before deciding on Thai. Dean perches himself on the countertop while Castiel calls to place the order.
“Here.” Castiel presses a cold glass into his hand and Dean eyes it curiously. “It’s just water. Drink; you’ll feel better.”
Panic and adrenaline fuel Dean’s fight as he thrashes against his bonds, howling wordless cries that get swallowed up by the excited murmur of the crowd. To them, this is just another Saturday night performance. The wooden device creaks with Dean’s effort, but ultimately stays put.
“Perhaps there need to be repercussions for your actions, then.” Castiel slaps him playfully on the ass, his hand lingering to rub over his jeans. Dean wiggles his butt in Castiel’s grasp and giggles when he’s rewarded with another swat.
Even that is asking too much, but Dean obeys and flops onto his stomach. He grunts when he feels Castiel tugging at the rope. It takes a moment for him to realize that Castiel is untying the knots, freeing him from the rope harness.
Castiel breaks the kiss too soon, using the hand tangled in the hair at Dean’s nape to pull his head to the side, baring his throat to lick and suck a dark bruise there.
“We haven’t been dating long enough to validate missing him this much…but it’s more than that.” Dean pauses, thinking about how to put it into words. “It’s like…it’s like I don’t know what to do with myself when he’s not around. It’s like I’m on edge all the time. Even at home I can’t really relax. I’m anxious and…I don’t know.”
“I’ve never been in your room before. The door is always closed.”
want that, but hearing Castiel say out loud unsettles him.
“Hael, yes. We weren’t in a romantic relationship, but she was my submissive for a time. I wasn’t in love with her like I was with Alfie, but I did care for her. As it turns out, she didn’t feel the same about me. The only thing she was after was furthering her own place in the world. She wanted a position within the company I work for and thought I could grant her that. When she realized I couldn’t, she left. But not before breaking into my apartment and stealing anything she could get her hands on.”
Dean’s been tossing and turning for an hour waiting for Castiel to come to bed.
Castiel frowns at the bruising around his left eye and cheek. His heart clenches when Dean lets go of the chain and lifts his arms to Castiel, beckoning him, and Castiel knows then that he can never deny Dean of anything. Wouldn’t want to, even if he could.
At a quarter past six Castiel still hasn’t shown. Dean tries to occupy himself, but he’s already cleaned everything and ends up fiddling with the throw pillows on the couch: flipping them one way, pacing from the living room area of his studio to the kitchen and back again, only to fluff and flip the same pillows back the way they had been before.
Castiel hooks a finger in the D-ring at the front of the collar and tugs him forward, leaning down to pull Dean into a kiss, his tongue sweeping into Dean’s mouth.
“Dean, of course you need a safeword. And safewording out of a scene does not make you a bad submissive. That’s what it’s there for; it ensures the safety of both parties during play.”
Dean baulks at that. “But I thought out of a scene you’re not my Dom and we’re just boyfriends?”
Castiel reaches around and wraps a hand around Dean’s erection.
There are, of course, some customers that Dean wishes he could scream at, but he just grits his teeth and forces himself to smile and wish them a good day.
The buzzer sounds when Dean’s head is in the oven, checking on the bread, and he nearly burns his scalp when he jumps.
“What’s there to talk about? Just let me do this for you.” Dean untucks Castiel’s shirt and runs a hand along the taut skin of his stomach. Dean needs this; needs to prove his worth to Castiel.
were the responsible one.”
Dean’s hands shake as he fumbles with the wire between sweaty fingers. Castiel wants to reach out and soothe the tremors, but holds himself back, watching quietly as Dean breathes out slowly and closes his eyes, calming himself enough to work the lock open. They both gasp when they hear the mechanism click and the collar falls away.
He lifts the lid and Dean cranes his neck to see inside. Castiel chuckles and spins the box around, tipping it so Dean can see and revealing a ring of dark leather.
“You want me to?”
Dean nods.
“Give me your hand.”
“Thanks,” Castiel says as he takes the offered plate. “And yes, I think so.”
After that, though, I will give you a much-needed update on Dean and Cas. Maybe probably sometime early February. I'm saying it now so I have to hold myself accountable and actually update when I say I'm going to, so if there's no update from me by then feel free to yell at me.
Dean focuses his attention on that hand instead of meeting Castiel’s gaze and nods, cursing himself for being so weak. He closes his eyes tightly and wishes he could make up for failing his Dom and burdening Castiel with his problems.
They both groan as Castiel enters Dean for the first time, sinking into him slowly. And Dean was wrong, he still wasn’t stretched enough to take Castiel. He groans and screws his eyes shut, but the burn of Castiel stretching him open is the perfect kind of pain that Dean’s been craving and he rocks down to take more of it.
“Are you trying to stall?” Castiel whispers in Dean’s ear.
Castiel shimmies to get comfortable and then sighs as he sinks into the mattress, surrounded by Dean’s warmth. “Much better,” he says, ending in a yawn.
The coffee shop is packed with people. One woman is behind the counter, both taking orders and making them, flying back and forth so quickly Dean thinks she blurs for a moment. But she still isn’t fast enough to keep up with the demanding line of customers.
, and I—”
Life as Alastair’s on-call submissive is not easy, but lately Dean’s been finding it unbearable.
“One thing at a time, babe.”
good,” Castiel says before shoving another handful into his mouth when Dean enters.
“This is not going to be pretty,” Dean warns, “Don’t you know you’re supposed to order a salad or something on the first date?” His eyes go wide when he hears the words fall from his mouth. “Uh, I mean, not that I think this is a date or anything, I just mean…”
“We’re doing something a little new today.” Dean looks up at him and licks his lips. “You wanted to try cockwarming, yes?”
“Yes, Master,” Dean mumbles.
“Alastair’s at the bar. He left a guard by the door, but he got a phone call and stormed off.” Castiel leans forward to run his fingers along the metal at Dean's neck, searching for a clasp or lock. “I don’t want to stick around until our luck runs out.”
The lights are too bright and he blinks rapidly to get the spots out of his vision, watching his reflection do the same. He raises a hand to his puffy eyes, still swollen from crying, not made any better by the dark bags underneath. He turns around and looks over his shoulder to inspect his back and gasps. It’s completely red, angry lines crossing over each other until there isn’t a scrap of skin left untouched by the damage of Alastair’s whip.
The waiter comes back a few minutes later and Castiel pays, as promised, but Dean still blushes when Castiel tells the waiter they’ll both be on one bill.
“Of course I’d come to support you.” Castiel gives him a dazzling smile that momentarily makes Dean forget all his worries. “Your dancing the other night was captivating; I can’t wait for a repeat performance.”
“But if you were having more ‘normal’ sex that would be perfectly fine dinner conversation with your family?”
Dean only nods slightly before he feels a cool, damp cloth dabbing and wiping away his blood, clearing the gashes on his back. He winces in pain as the cloth passes a few of them. The worst of the lashes seems to be one that starts at his right shoulder, crossing over the smaller cuts before ending around his hip on the left.
and Dean pushes back into Castiel’s touch, desperate for whatever his Dom is willing to give.
“It helps calm me down.” Dean grasps his glass tightly when the bartender slides the drink towards him. He stares into the dark liquid and twirls it around so it splashes against the side of the glass, but doesn’t make a move to take a drink.
“I don’t think anyone has ever used that word to describe you, Charlie.”
“I’m going to take my time with you, run my tongue over every inch of your body.” Castiel slips his tongue out to lick a stripe along the side of Dean’s neck. “I’m going to cherish you, Dean, and give you everything you deserve. Gonna open you up slowly, until you’re begging. And then?” Castiel smirks. “Then I’ll keep going until just before you think you can’t possibly take another second of pleasure.”
“What the hell did you just order me?”
“Yeah.”
Castiel keeps an eye on the door as he moves briskly across the room, but the only thing in the drawer is a crumpled condom wrapper and a layer of dust.
“If it were up to me, I wouldn’t. Or at least I’d bring you with me. Then maybe I could keep you out of trouble.”
“Excuse me.” A woman with graying hair waves her hand in front of Dean, but he just stares at the place the man disappeared.
“I know you can. I just want to spend time with you.” Castiel starts rolling a chunk of dough into a ball.
Castiel bends down and pulls his arms back in front. “Like this,” he directs and places Dean’s hands on his thighs, palms up. He puts a palm on Dean’s chest and pushes him until his back is straight. Dean hadn’t even realized how hunched over he had been. Castiel tweaks Dean’s position bit by bit, making him push his shoulders back slightly, lifting his chin, shifting his knees.
“Yeah. I mean I know we haven’t been dating that long, but I feel a connection with you like I’ve never felt before.”
“I know. You’re forgiven.”
Dean shakes his head. He’s pulling on the cuffs, metal cutting into his skin as he tries to get away from the shock of pain.
“Tell me what else,” Castiel prompts.
“Two weeks,” Castiel says, “That’s the time you’ve earned for breaking the rules. Maybe after this you’ll learn your lesson.”
Castiel picks up the length of braided rope from the bed and uncurls it. “You’re going to look so good all wrapped up for me,” he says from behind Dean.
“Right. Thanks. It was nice to be able to catch up with Charlie.”
Castiel opens the door and Dean is suddenly staring at his naked chest. He’s never seen Castiel in this state of undress before, and it short-circuits his brain because all he can seem to do is stare.
“Please,” Dean whines when Castiel just continues caressing him instead of spanking him.
