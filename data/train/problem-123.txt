The detective woke slowly, his hand clenching against John’s jumper. He sighed and smacked his lips. John’s heart lurched, and he knew that he wanted to wake up to that sight every morning. He spoke softly as he coaxed the man towards waking.
Suddenly, Sherlock’s left arm was on fire. A tingle of sensation shot along his nerves, and he couldn’t suppress the moan of pain that escaped him. He didn’t realize that John had gripped his arm until the hand was snatched back. Sherlock shook his head and concentrated hard. He had to know what John was saying.
John hunched forward and gripped his knees tightly, ignoring his own sweaty palms. “I don’t think that."
"Really, John. That's the question you want to go with. I thought you'd be more interested in the why of it all."
“Right,” John murmured. Knowing he’d been summarily dismissed, John turned and, shoving his keys into his pocket, he left the flat.
Sherlock glances down and evades the question by picking at his cuticles. John is having none of it. He grabs Sherlock's hand, forcing him to stop. The contact shocks Sherlock into looking directly into John's eyes and he finds himself compelled to answer.
“This building will be converted into temporary living accommodations. The entire first floor will be renovated and outfitted as a small clinic. The government wants to have a more comprehensive program for soldiers returning home.”
John sank down, one hip pressed against the arm of the sofa. As soon as he was situated, Sherlock tipped sideways and rested his head in John’s lap. He turned his head and nuzzled affectionately against John’s stomach. His low baritone was barely audible as he spoke against John’s shirt.
Warning: conversation about past sexual assault near the end of this chapter. It is not explicit or graphically described. In fact, the words sexual assault and rape are not even used in conjunction with the conversation. Just know that if discussions of past sexual assault trigger you, you may want to check with me for a summary that omits the convo.
anything. Could anyone really know anything if it was liable to go and change on you the minute you’d catalogued its parts?
Sherlock unrolled his silverware and placed the linen napkin in his lap before folding his hands in front of him on the table. He remembered the rules, and it was too early in the evening to aggravate M. He hadn’t revealed his purpose in calling Sherlock here yet.
Sherlock’s lips shaped words that his voice failed to form, and it took John several long moments to figure out what was being murmured repeatedly into his neck.
"For a genius, you can be spectacularly ignorant, you know that? I don’t care about all that, Sherlock. How long have
“We learned about reproduction! How a mum and a dad have a kid! I asked the teacher how two daddies have a daughter, and she laughed at me! It’s not possible! You lied to me! You’re not my real dad! You can’t be! It’s not
“A person who has been given Hypno will not typically recognize that they have been drugged. Their sexual response will be stimulated, and they will act upon it. That’s not – that wasn’t how it was for me.”
No one looked at Sherlock like that. Most people at the Yard begrudgingly accepted his utility, though Lestrade often seemed to be genuinely grateful for his help. No one looked at him as if the flesh and blood and bone that comprised Sherlock was worthy of appreciation as anything other than an unwieldy flesh vessel for his extraordinary brain.
“Right. So anyway, wanted to give you two an update on the case. You were absolutely right, John. The lab has identified three human femurs belonging to two different people. It took them bloody ages, but they’ve positively identified the remains of Alex Dumas. The other remains are still unidentified, but preliminary examination indicates they belong to a male of roughly the same age. The explosion has really bungled this whole investigation. The cause of death is undetermined, and we haven’t been able to locate a single motive or potential perpetrator. We know that two young people are dead from presumably unnatural causes, but without anything further, the only crime we can definitively prove is arson, and perhaps desecration of a corpse. We need him on this one.”
“There is nowhere else I would rather be, Sherlock. We could be at our flat or on the trail of a counterfeiter in Frankfurt or in a bloody rubbish skip in Brixton. It doesn’t matter to me so long as I get to be there with you.”
As John crosses in front of him to clean the coffee table, Sherlock grabs him and pulls him down to lay on top of him.
Mycroft raised his hands in surrender. “I know, but Moriarty did not see him that way. To him, Sherlock was a unique object of priceless value. An object that belonged to him.”
She gives him a knowing, indulgent look as she sets the plate on their counter, staring mutinously at the bacteria cultures and microscope hogging the kitchen table.
Sherlock bites his lip and turns to leave just as the doorknob turns. A wind-swept, red-cheeked Mary ushers her still-ill husband over the doorstep. They both stop at the sight of Sherlock running out of their kitchen. Sherlock's heart pounds. He feels trapped.
that signifies John hopping from foot to foot as he tries to get his trousers on and almost falls. All is silent for thirty seconds, and Sherlock is contemplating going upstairs to check on John when his phone pings.
Greg’s eyes had been focused on the table, but he quickly raised them to John. Greg’s elbows rested on the table, and they seemed to be the only thing holding him up. “It’s this bloody case,” he answered with a resigned sigh.
slither into the building this morning. The gall of him! Can you imagine? Showing up uninvited to someone's flat at half six in the morning? Anyway, I heard the unbearable
Sherlock leans into the touch and breathes a sound that is so deep that John can only call it a purr. The detective flips a few more pages to display RAMC orders regarding supervisory capacity of the Watson Homes Foundation. John reads eagerly, hoping it will be a name he recognizes. He would love to speak to the new director. His lips move as he reads the orders, then freeze:
Sherlock whines and dives down to suck John’s cock into his eager mouth. He pants around John’s throbbing erection and slides a second finger in alongside the first. He stretches John carefully and adds a delicious twist of his fingers on each out stroke. John is thrusting steadily back on each stroke and pumping up into his mouth. Stephen’s moans are growing high and needy as he lowers his own hand beneath Sherlock’s to fondle his balls. With a final flick of his wrist, Sherlock withdraws and watches John’s hole spasm greedily at the sudden emptiness. The man himself growls and bends at the waist, to pull Sherlock down on top of him.
"Not an actual relapse. For god's sake, John, keep up. You need a viable reason to stay away from your house.  So, I orchestrated a relapse. This way, you can tell Mary that I am struggling with my sobriety and stay here without raising her suspicions. I assumed actually relapsing would have been taking it too far, but Wiggins is still an active user, so I asked him for a sample. Once I explained it was a stand-in for me, he was more than happy to oblige."
Sherlock knew this was all his fault. All the pain hidden beneath the iron control of the soldier was his doing. He hated the way John was favoring his leg and didn’t even realize it. He hated the stupid tremor in John’s hand. It hadn’t made an appearance in ages. He’d helped John put aside his steel façade, but now the cracks were starting to show. Sherlock was purposefully prodding at them. Pushing John to pull away before he could break him.
Iain doesn’t need telling twice. He kicks off his shoes while pulling his shirt over his head and looks Stephen up and down as he undoes his fly.
Sherlock, too busy flicking chemical compounds of his own design into the fire, hadn’t deigned to reply. John watched as the flames turned green –
He is pretty sure the paramedics were discussing John's condition on the ride here, but Sherlock hadn't absorbed anything.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow and waited for John to elaborate. John made a show of settling back into the seat before answering. “Of course they haven’t,” he repeated spreading his arms in front of him as if it should be obvious. “You haven’t arrived yet.”
"The worst part is that I'm not even surprised. Not really. I should be angry. I should feel betrayed. But I don't. I just feel really, really relieved."
Sherlock blinks hard and chokes down the constriction in his throat. He can still smell that specific blend of medical-grade antiseptic and Clair-de-la-lune. He can still hear the way John's chest rattled and squeezed around each harsh, despairing sob. Every time he closes his eyes, he still sees a soft, warm, unmoving pink bundle cradled to John's chest as salty tears fall on her head like the rain she'll never get to feel. Sherlock doesn’t need to say the word. The memory of his stillborn daughter is etched into every line on John's face.
Sherlock tried to look away, to turn his head so that he wouldn’t see, but M held his head in place. There were no track marks to be found. Instead, a livid black spider adorned the delicate skin. The veins surrounding the tattoo were mottled black and throbbing angrily.
Molly takes the recently vacated chair and pours herself a cup of tea. When she has added milk and sugar to her liking, she settles back and sips, watching Sherlock over the rim of the cup. Meanwhile, Toby curls up on Sherlock’s lap and refuses to shift. So much for keeping the cat hair off his suit pants.
When it was over, Sherlock hastily shoved his traitorous cock back into his pants and zipped his trousers. He wiped his palm on the floor and pushed himself to sitting. His body was satisfied, but he found no pleasure in it. The nausea and shock were pouring through now that the siren call of his flesh was sated. Sherlock pulled his knees to his chest, rested his forehead on them, and cried.
He wasn’t hiding in the shadows anymore, then. In the past, he wouldn’t have dared to pick such a public location. This was new. It indicated surety. M was sure of his place and his actions. There was a concrete purpose for this night. There was a reason Sherlock was here.
“It was pointed out was it? You brilliant man. I love you. This is going to make such a difference.”
The repetition of washing each dish was calming. It narrowed his focus in a way that allowed him to focus only on the task at hand. Was that a bit of dried egg clinging to the plate or had he used it for that experiment with the mucus membranes?
He tried to rephrase, but he wasn’t sure the slightly altered inflection was having much affect. “I mean,” he trudged on, “why are you meeting me here, like this. Normally, you have me picked up and brought to you. In fact, we’ve never met in your car. Why…”
They took their time. John carefully finished shaving away the stubble covering Sherlock’s jaw. For once, there was no urgency to their actions.
Sherlock flinched violently and wrenched his wrist away. Startled, John searched his friend’s face for some sign as to how to handle the situation. He had no idea what had happened, but it was clear that Sherlock had been greatly affected. Not, that he would ever admit it. John hadn’t the first idea as to how to begin this conversation, but a horrific hypothesis was forming in his mind.
A voice echoes through the empty warehouse. Sherlock concentrates and determines that the person is on the floor above him, so he cranes his neck to attempt to pinpoint their location.
He was so absorbed in his thoughts, that he barely noticed himself unlocking the door or climbing the stairs.
Well that’s one of Greg’s questions answered at least. Runner up to John is not so shabby a position, he supposes. Sherlock’s tone softens so suddenly, that Greg has to lean forward to catch his next words.
“I can’t promise to never leave you behind. If given the choice between my safety and yours, your safety will always come first.”
“I have personal knowledge.” Sherlock’s voice was strained, like the air struggled past his vocal chords to push the statement past his lips.
“I want to be with you. No matter what. I want you to know that you can rely on me. I-I need you, Sherlock, and I think – or hope – that you just might need me too.”
Sherlock could tell that John didn’t really think he’d found any new information yet. This was his way of asking Sherlock what he was up to. Sherlock pretended to consider the question.
"Okay. You didn’t know. But you figured something out. That’s why you were so intent on making me leave. You figured something out yesterday."
associates. There aren't many sources with the institutional knowledge to tell us what we need to know."
Sherlock’s left foot spasmed as he came back to reality. He’d spent too much time locked in his mind palace. He stretched along the length of the sofa. The popping and cracking of his joints was oddly grounding. He held his left wrist loosely in his right hand and moved it in a circular motion. When the joint was pleasantly loose, he switched to the other wrist.
Sherlock folds the carrier bags and stows them next to the bin under the sink. John used to like to reuse them. Sherlock glances once more around the shiny, bright kitchen and grips the cool marble of the island like a lifeline. This is John. John's house. He can feel the man everywhere. But there is no Sherlock here. He feels like an intruder. Perhaps, John did not want him in the house. That's why he has not been invited. He and John remain friends but his married life and his crime fighting life must stay in different spheres. No crossing-over.
Sherlock checked the sign hanging above the door, though he already knew what it said: Sebastian’s. He’d have to walk across that street in thirty seconds if he wanted to be on time. He hadn’t decided yet. He used these final moments to deduce what he could from the location.
Sherlock's forehead creases as he tries to figure out how Mary introduced the toxin if John wasn't eating at home.
“Don’t be an idiot, Lestrade. I love John – that’s hardly news, but you’ve missed the important implication of the statement.”
“After all that, you are the one who lifted us up. You inspired us, made us laugh again. You made us safe, and you make us better. You give all your love, unreservedly, without any expectation in return. You love deeper and harder than anyone I have ever known, and that is why Rosie always has been and will always be yours. Your love is written into her bones in a way that science will never comprehend. It is a fundamental part of who she is. I’m sorry that she said those things to you, and I am sorry I wasn’t there. But you have to know she didn’t mean them.”
“What you must think of me! Do you think I’d rub off on just anyone who walked in here and offered? What do you take me for, an animal?! I don’t need your pity, and I certainly don’t need your help,
A feeling of unease gathered in John’s chest. Greg rarely texted John about a case. Sherlock was notoriously bad at returning texts, and John had willingly taken up the mantle of go-between for Sherlock and the world at large. But Sherlock always made an effort to reply when the message was case-related, and John had never seen his silence on such an occasion stretch beyond twenty-four hours.
Mary’s question rushes through Sherlock’s mind alongside the bang of a gun. Mary turns on her heel and runs. Sherlock, trusting fully in John’s ability, doesn’t even move. He knows John could make a kill shot across the entire distance of the warehouse without breaking a sweat. Sherlock waits for a shot that never comes.
Bill Wiggins was depositing a needle in the sharps container he had evidently brought with him. John knew for a fact they didn’t have one in the flat. It had been the source of one of their biggest arguments. Sherlock had wanted one around due to the unpredictable nature of his experiments. John had outright forbidden it due to Sherlock’s history of drug abuse. He didn’t really know all the details, but he knew enough to know that Sherlock did not need that kind of temptation in the flat.
Greg is saved his blathering by the kitchen door swinging open. Molly comes through carrying a proper tea tray and trailed by Toby, of course. She sets the tray on the table and looks between the two men, her hands on her hips. She sucks on her pursed lips and shakes her head. Idiots – the both of them.
“Lestrade’s got a date. Before you ask, his hair’s been recently cut, he’s walking with a slight limp – obviously wearing new shoes that pinch, and he’s trying out a new cologne. It’s been applied with a heavy hand, if you ask me. Not to mention he has been obsessively checking his watch since we arrived. Obvious. He has a date tonight. A new partner – it must be. He can’t call and cancel or be late because he hasn’t built up the relationship cache to allow such a faux pas. He knew he wouldn’t be able to leave the scene until he had at least a tentative picture of what had happened, so he called me in to speed up the process. Good thinking too. He really likes her. It wouldn’t do to have to meet her here. Quite the distraction. Besides, it is horribly inappropriate to display characteristics of arousal at a crime scene. People would talk you know.” Sherlock rattled off, sarcastically.
“Yes, but I’ve gotten quite used to having you here when you’re not on cases. Besides, you have never been one for a friendly chat. Why did you need to visit Lestrade?”
M speared a gnocchi with his fork, dragged it through the cream, and offered it across the table. Sherlock leaned forward and took the pasta into his mouth, wrapping his lips around the metal tines and sucking the sauce.
John grins at the familiar petulant tone. He missed the colossal berk. He lies back in the warm grass and lets the blades tickle his ears. He rests the phone on his drawn up knees as he considers his reply.
“Let’s have a proper dinner. Hmm? Take this off. It’s too warm in here for all that wool. Besides, you’ll be staying a while.” M’s lip curled in a sneer.
He stands in front of the Diogenes Club and pulls his Army-ingrained confidence around him. John hasn’t let richer, taller, stronger men intimidate him since uni, but there is something about this place that cuts right through him. It makes him feel small and vulnerable and lacking. He hates it.
When they had consumed half the pasta, M paused, wiped his mouth, delicately folded his napkin onto the table, and crossed the short distance. He twirled Sherlock’s chair so that it faced away from the table and straddled his lap.
"I know this is hard. And you feel embarrassed. I know, Sherlock, but it's just me. Just you and me. Breathing. Okay?"
Sherlock shuffles the contents of the file and rereads the autopsies. He memorized them hours ago, but it is something convenient to do. Despite the loss sweeping over John, it is his own heartbreak that makes it impossible to look directly at the man across from him.
He was still embarrassingly hard. He tried to ignore it but stumbled as he stood. His foot connected with a small brown parcel, and he only managed not to fall over by grabbing the back of the chair. The package was tied with frayed black string and a small printed card was pinned to it.
He fought to meet John’s eye, to let him know he understood. John seemed to draw strength from this reaction.
His own arms wrapped easily (too easily) around Sherlock. The man was worryingly thin, yet he didn’t feel fragile. Determination carved its way across his broad shoulders, given him a certain sturdiness he’d lacked these last few weeks.
Finally, the doors groan open and an exhausted surgeon beckons them over. The cup of tea falls from Sherlock's hands and lies ignored on the floor. The detective has room only for information about John.
Sherlock rocked back on the stool, and, for a brief moment, John was afraid that he would tip over. Balancing himself on the knife’s edge, Sherlock leaned forward and brought the stool crashing back down on its front legs.
Rosie whined, knowing her Dad had very little patience for whining. John had turned toward Sherlock with pleading eyes.
“It’s an antidote?” John clarified. Sherlock nodded affirmatively. John mulled that over. Odd word choice – antidote. If Sherlock was ill, the terms treatment or antibiotic would be more appropriate. Besides, John had examined Sherlock numerous times as he treated case-related injuries. Sherlock wasn’t sick. John would know wouldn’t he?
Sherlock concedes the point with a slight inclination of the head. He watches John with a fond gaze, but John can see the edge of wariness that creeps in despite Sherlock’s best efforts. John goes to stand in front of him, not touching.
John smiled softly, knowing now what Sherlock needed and no longer afraid to say the words out loud.
Lestrade made for the car muttering darkly. Sherlock would probably pay dearly for his moment of fun, but right now he couldn’t care. His mobile vibrated insistently in his pocket. Probably Greg already threatening to leave Sherlock off the next five cases if he told anyone else.
A noise like a gunshot rent the silence and both men jumped. John prowled into the sitting room, automatically assessing danger and clearing the room. By the time his brain caught up and realized the noise was most likely a cat getting into the bins out back, Sherlock had disappeared into his room and shut the door.
John looked up at him and nodded. His face remained serious, but hope was carved into the hesitant slope of his shoulders.
Two things were going to happen tonight. First, he was going to have to meet M at Sebastian’s. If he didn’t show up, there was no telling what M might do. Second, he was going to have to ditch John. After last night, the man was unlikely to let Sherlock out of his sight, but Sherlock would never let him within a five-block radius of M.
John carried the tea into the sitting room and left Sherlock’s cup on the side table. Sherlock watched him with a bizarrely calculating expression that made him uneasy. John sank into his arm chair and returned the look, challenging Sherlock with his intentional silence.
In the wake of Mycroft’s message, however, John found that he could not find it in himself to feel guilty. All he felt was a deep well of terror. What could have happened to shake the great Mycroft Holmes?
"Uh…came home, watched a detective flee the house for reasons still unknown, unpacked my bag, had dinner, and Mary gave me my meds before bed…"
“I know, but you can’t.” He tried to make it sound final, not leaving any opening for denials or discussion. “This isn’t something to be fixed.” Sherlock drew on all his past experiences – the parents, teachers, and therapists who had tried before. He let the hurt and the rage loose. He gave them free reign and was surprised to find the acid in his voice was real, albeit misplaced.
He has done many dangerous things for John before. This is hardly the worst. Sherlock spends the next twenty minutes picking out the things he remembers John buying most often. Easy essentials that can be combined into quick, wholesome meals. He also is sure to grab John's hobnobs, crisps, and milk of course. He mutters it to himself the whole time he is in the store. He mustn't forget the milk. John is adamant about milk in his tea.
His arms wrapped around his ribs and he seemed to be holding himself silent through sheer force of will. Sherlock rocked precariously back on his heels, wobbled for a moment, and fell hard on his tailbone.
“Connections. You would not believe the connections Jim had. Anyone who was anyone in the criminal world had thrown their lot in with him. How could I resist that much power?”
Then, he turned to glare at Sherlock. “Of course you know about my plans, never mind the fact that even I’d forgotten. You could have reminded me, you know.” John’s tone was accusatory but there was no heat in it.
The bureaucrat's voice was mostly unchanged, but John detected a note of desperation bleeding through. The realization that Mycroft was almost pleading with him stayed his hand for the time being.
Exactly forty-three minutes later, a scowling Sherlock is standing on his doorstep. John knows he must be irritated that he's late. He smiles welcomingly and gestures quizzically toward the box in his hands.
, are all negotiable. We’ll navigate them as they come. So long as we both agree to try and communicate when we want something, or when we don’t want something,” he added hastily, “we should be alright.”
“It was…for a while. Magnussen changed everything. He was truly a font of knowledge, that man. Told me lots of helpful things about the Ice Man and his
“Look at me, John. Really look at me. Do I look like I’ve just injected cocaine into my bloodstream? Are my pupils dilated? Is my heartrate elevated? Am I manic right now?” Sherlock looked caught, like he wanted to get up and pace, but he was afraid it would make him seem more excitable than he was.  “You’re a doctor, for gods sake! You should know the basic tells of someone who is high. I am displaying none of those symptoms.”
“Sherlock, dear, mind the door! It’s nice to hear you humming again. It’s been ages. Anyway, I’m just popping to the shops. Shouldn’t be long.”
John says nothing but tightens his grip on the gun. Sherlock’s stomach flips, clearly John did think his marriage to Mary meant something. He steps forward to intervene, but Mary refocuses the gun on him. She knows that threatening Sherlock works even better than pointing the gun at John himself.
The words were somewhat muffled between warm, soft breaths and needy presses. Soon, Rosie started to squirm and they had broken apart, breathing heavily. Sherlock stood and John, ever practical, took command.
John took the folder from Greg and slipped it into his jacket. If Sherlock was still intent on destroying the flat when he got back, this could be the very distraction he needed. Besides, John couldn’t ignore five dead bodies. He’d hide the violin if that’s what it took to get Sherlock onto this. The sooner he solves it, the better for everyone involved. Interpreting John’s actions correctly, Greg’s whole body relaxed. John hadn’t realized he was so nervous.
“Most of the symptoms mimic the flu - fever, chills, lethargy. I’ve not got much of an appetite, and most food turns my stomach. Good choice with the apple, by the way.” He smiled that small, fragile smile meant only for John.
After several minutes, a harried-looking young man walks briskly across the atrium and hands a small card to the doorman. The doorman nods, but the besuited young man is already walking away, tapping frantically at his Blackberry. The doorman holds the card out for John, who is surprised but takes it.
“Please lie down. When you’ve got your strength back, you can plot 100 ways to get revenge on your brother, and I promise to help, alright?”
“I will always think of her as my daughter, John, but she may not choose to see it that way. I can’t force her. I just…I love her so much.”
John came with a grunt and licked a wet stripe up Sherlock's neck. That's all it took. Sherlock was coming hard, soaking his pants, and cringing at himself. He'd just come in his pants like a bloody teenager.
Piles Case Number 4 looked at John expectantly, and he realized that he’d been asked a question. He smiled as reassuringly as he could, handed over the signed order, and an information packet.
Sherlock’s blood runs cold as he hears the quiet snick of a window rising. He rushes to keep Mary’s focus. He is going to bloody kill Mycroft. Why couldn’t he just keep John busy for an hour?
Sherlock gave a practiced twist of his wrist, skimming his palm over the glans of M’s cock, and the man was lost. He spasmed in Sherlock’s hand, and he felt hot stripes seep through the thin silk of his shirt.
"You solved it. You got me out. But Mary's not stupid. She's bound to notice a missing husband, even if said husband has been spending all his time down the pub."
John didn’t relax. While he was relieved that Sherlock had escaped that sick bastard, Mycroft hadn’t explained what that had to do with Sherlock’s recent disappearance. If Moriarty had agreed to stay out of Sherlock’s life, why was the story relevant?
Sherlock clattered down and wrenched the door open. He turned back to make sure that John was following and caught the tail-end of a small resigned sigh before John was schooling his face with a nod and a smile so stretched that it hurt Sherlock’s cheeks just looking at it.
Sherlock brushed a wayward curl out of his eyes and got up to check the computer monitor. He was pushing the process as fast as he dared. They didn’t have enough samples for him to repeat these tests if he got it wrong. He sighed when he saw that it would still be several hours before there were any new results to analyze.
A cold greasy feeling settles in John’s stomach as the conversation begins to feel a little too familiar. Magnussen’s sadistic voice echoes through John’s mind.
"Oh the poor dears. They must be worn out from being in hospital. Did you say John was coming home soon? Oh Sherlock, you should do some shopping for them. I know they'd appreciate that. Go on. Just a few things so Mary doesn't have to nip out the moment they get home."
John just smiles already anticipating the delicious shock of a Sherlock proven wrong as he pulls out his phone to send his text:
John shuffles to the bedroom while Sherlock trails behind him uncertainly. As John climbs under the comforter, Sherlock glances around making sure everything is in order.
Sherlock's hands bunch into fists and his eyes squeeze shut. His frame is vibrating and his breathing is shallow and quick. John stands and walks around the table to crouch by his friend's side.
John thought of all the pain that caring had brought him. He thought of Harry and the backlog of spiteful voicemails saved on his mobile that he couldn’t bring himself to erase. Despite the hateful words, each message was another piece of proof that Harry was still alive.
Sherlock sank to the floor and let the fear and frustration and arousal wash over him. His whole body shook with the effort of not touching himself. He clawed deep red lines into his own arms as he fought his body's impulses. Eventually, it was no use. He unzipped his trousers and palmed himself quickly. He lay on his side on the cold floor, turned his head away, and screwed his eyes shut. He'd do this as quickly as humanly possible. He felt arousal rise within him, mixing with shame. He knew he was going to come, and he hated it. He didn't want it. He didn't have a choice. In just a few minutes, his hips were grinding steadily, and, finally, he was coming in long spurts.
Three dots appear as John stares at the phone. He's not sure his electronic demands actually warrant a smartphone, but Mary had insisted. This is one of the only perks he has found useful so far. He can see that Sherlock has read his message and is typing. The screen goes dead for a moment and John's heart drops. The three dots reappear for a moment before a message quickly replaces them.
When John did not immediately follow, Sherlock poked his head back through the doorway. John stood by the workbench looking incredulously at him. In that moment, Sherlock was struck by the memory of their first meeting.
Sherlock’s search turns frantic as the echoing distorts the sound waves, throwing them against the walls and concealing the enemy’s position.
“Lestrade texted. We’re going to Bart’s,” he called over his shoulder. “You have fifteen minutes before I leave without you.”
“This isn’t just some lowlife criminal painting a target on our backs. It’s more complicated than you can even imagine, and I am compromised. I can’t protect you.” Sherlock steeled himself for the final blow. “The last thing I need is the liability of carrying your dead weight. I can’t be stopping to answer question after question. Not with this. The match is set. There’s too much at stake, and I refuse to lose.”
“Because there are three femurs in this picture.” John said it nonchalantly, laid it down as fact, but Lestrade still spluttered in disbelief.
“Brilliant,” John breathed. There was an unfamiliar tightness in Sherlock’s chest, and he couldn’t look away from his raggedy doctor. John’s face did something complicated and his brow wrinkled. Lestrade swore under his breath and radioed Donovan to meet him at the car. Before he could take more than three steps, John called after him.
In Sherlock’s experience, it was the only place they ever managed to hide. Secrets, lies, obfuscations - they cannot exist in the too ephemeral darkness. There is no refuge there on which to rely. You cannot hide a whisper in the silence.
"Mary's herb garden caught my eye. She had a shockingly large variety. Lots of plants no novice gardener would own and any knowledgeable gardener would know not to use in their cooking. Many of the herbs in your yard are poisonous, lethal upon ingestion. When you mentioned the suddenness of your illness and its strange recurrence, it all became clear. What I can’t understand is why now? She's had ample opportunity to poison you for weeks. Why wait?"
Sherlock's breath stutters on a gasp as he tries to force a deep breath into his lungs. A choked whimper escapes his throat and he tightens his fists in aggravation.
John’s chin drooped toward his chest, and he jerked abruptly awake. He was shocked to find the room dark. He’d slept for some time. John cursed himself and focused his attention on the bed. His hand stuttered to a halt halfway toward rubbing the sleep from his eye. Sherlock’s penetrating gaze was fixed on him.
Sherlock brushes the creases out of his shirt and slides gracefully around John to gather his wallet and keys off the kitchen table. John, resigning himself to a morning full of Mycroft, sighs and heads for the stairs. Sherlock shouts at him to text when he is done at the Diogenes, and John just manages to hear it all before he slams his door shut.
Sherlock goes nonresponsive beneath him. John pulls back and panics at the carefully blank look on Sherlock’s face.
“That can’t be right,” John murmured, grabbing the photo and angling it to see better in the dim light. Sherlock beamed at John, thrilled that he had picked up what half of Scotland Yard had not. Lestrade, fidgeting and impatient, crowded behind them to look as well.
“Sherlock,” John said quietly. He hadn’t wanted to reach for his friend again, given the poor reaction he’d received last time, but he was determined that Sherlock should remain in bed. Surprisingly, the man stopped.
“We can’t really spare the time,” he said in a whisper. “I know there’s only so much anyone can do with these things…” he gestured around the lab. “Even for Sherlock there are limits.”
But the man remained eerily silent. John’s heart dropped as he contemplated the idea of Sherlock having a boyfriend he did not know about. Had he missed his opportunity without even knowing it was an option?
Minutes passed, or at least that was what it felt like for Sherlock. Suddenly, John was knelt at his side. When had he moved closer? His hands were out, palms facing Sherlock. He felt like his head was full of cotton-wool and there was a high-pitched ringing in his ears. John’s mouth was making shapes again. John’s eyes were wide, and his brow crinkled in hard lines when Sherlock didn’t respond.
"Okay. I'm going to sit here, alright? Now, I'm breathing deeply. Can you try? Just follow me. Nice and easy."
John’s eye was drawn up to Sherlock’s neck. The man’s shirt was buttoned all the way up. John wondered if Sherlock had been too distracted this morning to notice he had done them all. He could see it in his mind’s eye. Sherlock’s mind focused inward as he went through the rote motions of getting dressed. Long pale arms slipping into cool soft sleeves. Nimble fingers doing up the buttons one by one until he ran out. Fondness for the disastrous genius flooded John’s system, and he reached up to undo the top button.
It takes John several minutes to drain the tub and dress. Sherlock listens for the telltale sound of John’s footsteps on the stairs to his room, but none come.
Sherlock shakes his head and takes several steadying breaths. When he brings his gaze up to meet Greg’s, Sherlock’s eyes are full of uncertainty.
John bent forward and ran his finger along the wall searching for any signs of concealment. He found none. After covering the entire alcove twice, he was forced to give up. He rested his forehead against the nearest panel and shut his eyes.
John kisses him gently then steps back. He runs his hand through his own hair and looks at the ground. There was something important he meant to say…
John's voice is oddly compatible with the day, all soft lavender and downy clouds. Sherlock sucks in breath and forces himself to look up.
“Sherlock and he were...friends?” John was not sure what point Mycroft was trying to make, but Mycroft’s eyes flashed with fury. It was only a moment, quickly hidden away behind his typical calm exterior, but John saw it.
Sherlock realizes he has been staring at the same page of the report for several minutes and wonders if John has noticed. He flicks his eyes to John's face. It is immediately apparent that John would not notice a troop of murderous assassins in the flat right now. Sherlock sighs, flips the page, and settles in to wait.
John is transported back to that first time. The twin aches of arousal and loss ricochet through him again and for a moment, Sherlock is dead and John is conflating the two in his desperation and lust. He goes still on top of Stephen, who looks lost. Sherlock understands immediately.
John's back was a hard line, a steel cage woven around Sherlock, but his hands were painfully gentle where they held him. One palm came around his neck to cradle Sherlock’s face against his shoulder while the other ran soothing lines up and down his spine. Sherlock shivered. John didn’t shush him or hurry him along. He stayed with Sherlock, giving him the time he needed to come back to himself. John simply was. He existed in Sherlock's periphery. Unshakably firm.
John longed to press his lips against the delicate pale column of Sherlock’s throat, but he didn’t dare disturb the balance they seemed to have found. Sherlock was in his arms, and that was enough.
Mycroft can hear the sound of his little brother retching through the door. He presses his palm flat against the door and holds silent vigil until the violent sick noises stop. He waits another thirty seconds, but when Sherlock shows no sign of coming out, he tries the door handle, which is locked - of course.
John’s voice had dropped dangerously low and his teeth were grinding with restraint. The infuriating bureaucrat merely uncrossed his arms and fixed John with a penetrating stare that, for once, did not unnerve him. John refused to back down, knowing that the information he sought was imperative if he was to help Sherlock.
The detective sighed and scrubbed a hand through his curls. “I imagine your first thought was cocaine, given the placement of the injection.” John flinched at the clinical detachment in Sherlock’s voice. “It’s an understandable mistake given that you are operating without all the facts.”
Sherlock's pleading cuts off with an inhuman screech that sends Mycroft sprawling as his ears ring. His Blackberry hits the floor and shatters as he rams his shoulder against the door. When the lock breaks, Sherlock is huddled in the corner of the shower, knees hugged to his chest. The crash of the door hitting the ground resounds loudly in the small room, and Sherlock shrinks further into the corner, covers his head with his arms, and begs again.
“Don’t look like that. I absolutely love it. It just all feels so unreal. I’m engaged to the love of my life who knows me so well that he got me an engagement present only he could deduce would touch every part of my heart.”
John comes back to awareness at the sound of his name. He had been lost in his head for a moment there.
That was the cruel twist of being deemed M’s favorite. The man wasn’t satisfied to simply drug Sherlock and have his way. No. For him, M had concocted something special, something new. A neurochemical reaction that coded Sherlock’s sexual response to M’s DNA. When Sherlock had imbibed the drug, he hadn’t just been turned on by anything with a pulse. His body sought M’s and would burn itself down until he got it. He’d been marked by the spider.
He crossed into the kitchen without waiting for a response, grabbed the now empty plates off the table, and put them in the sink. He gave himself a second of privacy to smile at the fact that the butty had vanished.
He heard the rustling of John removing his jacket, but he didn’t turn to look. He felt unmoored. He wasn’t sure where to start. The floor groaned as John moved further into the sitting room. Sherlock could make out a weighted thudding. He heard John’s knee creak as he squatted down, and a long sharp zip of sound…
After several minutes, John gives it up for a loss. He’ll never be able to treat this like just another case. Not when it actually signifies the collapse of the life he has so carefully constructed. He has spent so much energy becoming normal, steady, safe John Watson that he willfully ignored the details that he couldn’t make fit. He should have known better. He’s heard Sherlock berate Scotland Yard often enough.
“Oi, listen! I really don’t think that. It’s obvious to me that you’re not enjoying what’s happening here. I don’t know the details of what happened, but Mycroft mentioned that this time was different. Will you talk to me? Between the two of us, maybe we can figure this out, yeah? I want to help.”
Sherlock can hear sporadic wheezing until the rush of water against porcelain drowns out all other sounds. Sherlock slips into his room as the tub fills and pulls a small, plastic storage box out from underneath his bed. He actually spent time picking this box personally. He wanted to be sure it would seal and protect the items inside from dust, water, chemicals, everything. He pulls off the lid with a
“I don’t know what you expected Greg to do about it. I mean really, Sherlock. The man can barely put together a romantic evening, not that it matters. I love the sod, dearly, but expecting him to help plan a romantic proposal?”
Lestrade looked like he wanted to evaporate on the spot, but John was struck dumb. A moment later, he was bent in half giggling hysterically. Between wheezes, he was apologizing to Lestrade, but it was clearly difficult to believe he was being sincere when his face was turning purple.
John, not wanting Sherlock to stop on his account, looked down at his own plate and tucked in. When he had eaten half his sandwich, he looked up intending to locate his tea. Sherlock was watching him with a deep penetrating gaze. John squirmed under the scrutiny.
Light, on the other hand, covers a multitude. It’s like cloaking a private conversation amongst the murmured static of a busy coffeeshop. With enough ambient noise, numerous lies can be hidden.
All motion stops as he discovers the wound. It is now clear that John didn’t drop the gun out of exhaustion. He dropped it because he could no longer physically hold the weapon with the damage his shoulder sustained. His shirt is quickly soaking crimson. Sherlock whips off his scarf and tries to stem the flow. He quickly calls emergency services and gives them the necessary information. As he hangs up, he knows the exchange was sufficient, but he can’t for the life of him remember anything he said. All that matters is that John is here, and the man in his arms is dying.
“You better watch out,” John said a bit more seriously but still laughing. “I could get used to this.”
Sherlock didn’t have the luxury of following that train of thought much longer. Soon, there was a flurry of movement and a mismatched thudding on the stairs. John was home – finally!
Sherlock shoots out of his chair and towers over John, pressing him backward into the counter. His keen eyes taking in every detail. His brain whirring away parsing the vital information from extraneous facts.
Sherlock’s hands are buried deep in his pockets, but he fiddles all the same. His shoulders hunch in and he seems to physically be recoiling in anticipation. John tries to make himself softer. He rounds his spine and pulls his shoulder down, shrinking The Captain back into a kind man in a fuzzy jumper. Sherlock stands in the decrepit foyer unable to do anything but love him. He breathes deeply and goes on.
Soon, the tremors turned to full-body shaking, and Sherlock grew tired. The rosy blush of fever painted itself over his cheeks, and John helped him into his clean pajamas. He gripped Sherlock by the elbow and half-carried him to the sitting room.
Sherlock can’t imagine what Mary needs to convey that hadn’t been conveyed in the two prior disks. The postmortem notes are actually getting a bit cruel now. The constant reminder to John of his dead wife is a bit not good. Hopefully, this will be the last. Hopefully, they can let her be at peace.
John holds that beautiful, impossible future in his mind for a moment. He sees Mary smiling, kneeling, sweating in a sprawling garden under the noonday sun as two children chase dragonflies. He watches the children rush up the path as John arrives home from the clinic, swinging the side gate open. He imagines raucous family dinners and sweet, sleepy baths. He can almost feel the strength of tiny arms wrapped around his legs and smell the indescribable scent of childhood. John allows the hope and happiness to fill him.
Sherlock’s expression shuttered immediately, and fear flashed across his face. As John’s hand made contact with his chest, he flinched but did not move away. John held his hand completely still, waiting for an indication from Sherlock. The man’s chest heaved, and John could feel his heart beating just a bit too fast. He watched the delicate column of Sherlock’s throat bob as he swallowed before nodding imperceptibly.
John would not make him regret it by forcing him to answer all the questions burning through John’s mind.
“Not really,” Sherlock admitted. “It’s not a matter of just running tests. I know you’re perfectly capable, but I have to be able to make the necessary connections.”
Warning: Sherlock describes some details of his traumatic past experiences with sexual assault in this chapter. If discussions of past sexual assault trigger you, you may want to check with me for a summary that omits the convo. There is also discussion of dismemberment and desecration of a corpse so proceed with caution if that is not your thing.
John’s throat was tight, but he forced his way through it. Now that he’d begun, he found that he was quite relieved. The words came more easily than he’d ever believed they might.
John crosses the room, grasps Sherlock's arm reassuringly, and follows Mrs. Hudson into the kitchen to start the kettle.
Sherlock smiles a lazy, half-smile at him, and John decides he doesn't really care. However this happened, and he's certain Sherlock will tell him later, John is exactly where he wants to be. He heaves himself into a full-body stretch and takes pleasure in the shiver that ripples through his muscles. He feels surprisingly well rested.
His blood runs cold as the answer occurs to him. John rips the mobile out of his pocket and punches in Mycroft’s direct line. It only rings once before the man himself answers. That alone is unusual. Usually, one of his minions answers first to screen calls. He must have been expecting John after being notified about the mix up at the Diogenes. John doesn’t waste any time on pleasantries.
John pulls his phone from his pocket and checks to see whether he has missed a notification. He knows he hasn't. He has been checking his phone every twenty minutes since Sherlock whirled out of their kitchen three weeks ago.
John smiles to himself as he turns his key and re-enters 221B. His heart pounds with a combination of nerves and excess caffeine. Maybe coffee hadn’t been the best decision. His toe connects painfully with the edge of the top stair, and John grabs the door to keep himself from literally falling into the flat. Sherlock, deep in concentration on his “
“Ta, Greg,” John replied, already thinking about how to broach the case with Sherlock. “I’ll have him take a look, yeah?”
With a suave wink, Sherlock disappears back into the sitting room just as Molly reaches the top of the stairs. John, confused but pleased, rushes to shower and change.
John could hear a loud ticking as time passed. He saw the vulnerability in the soft slope of Sherlock’s shoulders and the cold truth in the tremble of his lip. Though he knew what Sherlock was trying to tell him, John’s brain rejected it.
you know, right?” He looked for a glimmer of understand from Sherlock but saw none. “It’s enough that you know. Forget the rest.”
He was used to folding away his fractured, fragile edges. He kept them well out of sight. But Sherlock had always seen them, no matter how hard John tried to keep them obscured. He had gotten used to his flatmate pulling his deepest secrets to the surface to examine them in the harsh light of day. It hardly bothered him anymore. John assumed that was why Sherlock’s face hovering mere inches away from his scar caused him no more than a single skipped heartbeat of nervousness. Sucking in a breath, John dispelled the anxiety entirely.
John held Sherlock's focus with a searching, desperate gaze. Even now, he was trying to reassure Sherlock. The detective couldn't understand John's depths. The man never seemed to run out of empathy and patience.
There was a tightness in Sherlock’s chest at the tender look John was giving him. Suddenly, he wanted to tell John. He needed John to know.
He didn’t know how it happened. It should have been impossible, but suddenly, John was there. He was standing next to Sherlock in the dingy alley, watching him shake his way through the shock. He watched John’s lips form shapes, but they had lost all meaning. John chewed his lip, probably deliberating the best course of action.
Both men groan as John’s cock throbs at the thought. Sherlock dives into their bedside table for the lube. He kisses John’s hip as he coats his finger and circles John’s entrance with a light teasing touch that John can’t help but thrust back toward. With his other hand, Sherlock grasps Stephen’s cock and strokes with purpose. The other man’s eyes roll at the practiced twist of Sherlock’s hand at the tip of his cock, dragging his palm over the sensitive head.
The familiar flow of information winds itself around Sherlock's brain. He settles into the comforting cadence of deductions. His shoulders grow lax and his face lights up in a way John has not seen in months. Sherlock's words slow as he reaches the end of his list. His brow puckers.
Mary inclines her head in acceptance, but Sherlock barely sees. He is busy watching John drop from the window and sneak along the shadows.
Sherlock turned away. He had to do this, but he didn’t have to watch that hope flicker and die. He was not such a masochist as all that.
With a heavy sigh, he rolled onto his back and rubbed at his eyes. He’d lain there most of the night trying to think of a way around the inevitable, but he hadn’t been able to find one.
The ticking of the clock sets the pace for Sherlock's solemn march back and forth across the stained linoleum.
The word is barely a croak. John bends closer just to hear it. Sherlock swallows several times, attempting to lubricate his throat without sufficient hydration to complete the task. Drawing a reusable water bottle out of his travel bag, John encourages Sherlock to drink. He sucks greedily and soon the bottle is empty, though it had enough water left in it to moisten Sherlock’s throat back to working order. Taking the empty bottle from the detective, John tucks it back into its compartment.
Sherlock tucks himself into a chair and lets the cup warm his fingers while they wait. Time passes with no word on John's condition. Mycroft takes off his suit jacket. Lestrade alternates between sitting and standing. The tea grows cold. No one speaks.
safe. Apparently, that is no longer the case. It is not yet clear what circumstances have changed to allow Moriarty to risk that which he was unwilling to risk before. Sherlock could likely tell us, but he is in no state to do so.”
“NO!” Sherlock’s voice was loud in the small kitchen. He stood and stalked toward John, eyes narrowed. “I will not be going to hospital. You don’t even know what I’m dealing with. They won’t know either! It’s none of your business anyway. I’m managing it perfectly fine without you.”
After three cups of coffee, a thirty-five-minute delay on the Underground, and four cases of bloody piles, the sun had finally fully risen. Its brilliant rays highlighted the bustle of the city outside the clinic windows.
The lights of London outside the window blurred and ran like an Impressionist painting come to life. Gone were the stark well-defined edges of the familiar buildings, swept away by his mind’s insistence that he focus on the not inconsiderable effects of the cab’s motion. The minutia bled together until Sherlock could no longer tell one object from another. Where did the street end? Where did the shopfronts begin? The darkness lent itself to this illusion, shrouding important distinguishing details, while the lamp light smeared over it all in webby, veined fractal patterns.
“Oi. Enough of your snark. You were so lovely when you got home. Cuddles and secret plans. Have you used up your store of civility for the night?”
Sherlock seems to search for a word. Just when John thinks he's lost the detective to his memories, Sherlock continues.
Sherlock indulged himself with a quiet, “Mmm,” of agreement before looking away out the window. He knew that he was abysmal with reading the emotional needs of other people, but he’d have to be blind to miss the misery carving its presence into John’s muscles. He surreptitiously used the pane of glass in front of him to study John.
When he got back to the flat, Sherlock was pacing around the sitting room, obviously growing impatient. John forced the coffee into his hands, and Sherlock looked at it in disgust.
“I should be going,” said Wiggins, shattering the silence. “Two weeks, Shezza,” he muttered cryptically. He quickly gathered his things and all but ran out of the flat. He managed a contrite grimace at John on his way out.
John lifts a fried egg and sets it carefully on top of his own buttered toast. He bites into the monstrosity and flicks his tongue out to catch the stray yolk running down his jaw. Sherlock gulps and looks away, trying to concentrate on the seriousness of the situation. His rebellious cock pays no attention as it hardens with anticipation.
John watches Sherlock swan out of the room. He draws his severely confused brain back to the task at hand and wraps a dressing gown around himself before following his mad friend.
The brothers stare at one another for several long moments. John briefly contemplates getting up and breaking the stalemate, but decides against it. At last, Sherlock gives a terse nod, and Mycroft breathes deep. John would almost swear it was a sigh of relief. If it had been anyone other than Mycroft Holmes John would have known it with certainty.
John took two steps toward him before he remembered Sherlock’s reaction in the bedroom. He stopped but did not retreat. He waited until Sherlock met his eye, and he tried to convey all the comfort and empathy Sherlock would not let him voice. He turned back to the counter to take the pressure off of his next statement.
Lestrade had called about a new case precisely thirty-seven minutes ago. It sounded like a promising case too. At least a seven…seven-point-five if his suspicions about the dismemberment happened to be correct. Sherlock had listened just long enough to hear Lestrade say
He looks anxiously at John, who is still stunned. The concept is incredible. He remembers what it was like to come home and have nothing. He remembers how hard it was to make it to physio those first few weeks. He could barely make it a few blocks with his cane. That had been bloody humiliating. It would have been life-changing to have had an in-house clinic. Happiness bubbles up and fills John’s chest. He can feel tears streaking down his cheeks but he doesn’t care.
The door swung open to reveal a shockingly cluttered room that flouted the obviously patrician hand which had furnished the rest of the house. A long table ran the length of the room and a tall, skinny tower of immaculately spaced shelves was wedged in the corner. The shelves held an inventive variety of beakers, retorts, and flasks. The table itself was strewn with maps, diagrams, several old CPUs, an assortment of monitors, a keyboard missing several keys and a mouse with the connector cord snipped in half.
Sherlock rushes to explain as John's voice rises. If he doesn’t get control of the conversation, it will only be another 3.2 minutes before John storms out of the flat, judging by the escalation rate he has displayed thus far. Now that John's left Mary, he can’t go out on his own. It's too dangerous, and John is too valuable a target. He needs to
John cleared his throat and levered himself out of his chair. “It could be nice to see a physical sign that you’ve met your person.” John walked slowly toward Sherlock. “I can see the appeal in that but…”
John stays close but knows better than to touch. Sherlock manages a terse nod but doesn’t stop shaking.
Sherlock's words come out in a tangled rush. He's not sure John can even understand him, but his desire to get John away from here before Mary returns overrides his desire for clarity of enunciation.
John could see how he thought that, given the fact that the cab door had been flung open before the car had fully stopped. “Nah, mate. He’s just late for work is all. Here ya go,” John said handing over the fare. The cabbie accepted the bills and thanked John for the tip, chattering on for several minutes while John fought the urge to just leave. He couldn’t bring himself to be so rude, but he couldn’t listen to the man yammer any longer.
Sherlock goes completely still. That’s wrong. Mary didn’t like classical music. She teased him about it all the time. But that would mean that John is not talking about Mary, which is equally impossible. His mind goes utterly blank and all Sherlock can do is stare at the television with a desperation he has kept locked away for so long that it pours out of him. He’s no longer in control.
As he stepped out of the clinic, he was buffeted by a wave of pedestrians hurrying down the street. He huffed in annoyance and pulled himself up against the building until they’d passed. When the sidewalk cleared, John could see a sleek black car idling at the curb. A nondescript man exited the driver’s seat, circled the car, and held the back door open. He took the bag from John and deposited it in the trunk while John slid inside.
Sherlock folds his arms and clutches his ribs. Perhaps if he squeezes hard enough, he can hold the jagged pieces of himself together. He bows his head against the wind and sets off, quickly researching the nearest Tesco to John and Mary's new home.
The thought frightened him. He wasn’t afraid of John. Not at all. John wasn’t the one who needed to be protected. A wave of bitter anger washed over him as he indulged his own selfishness. John was selfless, kind, and caring, but he was not without his limits. There were more than a handful of offences Sherlock knew his flatmate would not tolerate - lying, leaving, cutting John out- any one of those actions would push the doctor too far.
“I’m all wrong!” He bellowed, ruffling his riotous hair. “I can’t undo what’s been done, and I’ll never be right. Don’t you understand? I can’t be what you need. I can’t do what you’re supposed to do when you’re, you know…” he fished for the right word, not quite finding it. “We can’t be together. I mean we can’t be
He swallows hard and gives a firm nod. Sherlock understands immediately. He rises from his chair and paces across the flat. He will treat this like just another case, though it is anything but. John won't be able to completely detach, but he'll appreciate Sherlock's effort to keep it as impersonal as possible.
Sherlock shot out of the cab without a backward glance while John pulled a few rumpled bills out of his pocket.
“Good, John. Physical symptoms also include extended periods of arousal and persistent erections. Emotional symptoms are harder to define. Mood swings - definitely. Frustration, longing, desperation, disgust - all expected phases. But this time, there is something different. Something I haven’t ever had before.”
He turns it over and over but there are no clues to be found, except the two words printed on the front: Miss Us?
John knows the video was meant to arrive today. He’s checking in without giving everything away. Sherlock smiles at his big-hearted idiot.
John sat at his desk and unlocked the top drawer to withdraw his mobile. He waited a few moments for it to power on. Maybe it really was time for an upgrade. Sherlock had offered several times recently, but John had refused. The phone was perfectly functional, and there was a comfort to its plodding reliability. It reminded John of times past when he’d had to wait for dial-up. Back then, he’d had enough time to fix tea and toast while his computer sputtered to life. His mobile was not quite that slow, and the lag suited him just fine. However, it probably was a hinderance in an emergency. Besides, he was fed up with the barrage of insults from Sherlock regarding the substandard qualities of his phone whenever he “borrowed” it. Just because Sherlock often forgot his own or was too lazy to go and retrieve it, did not give him the right to berate John’s choice. He sighed and made a mental note to research options later that night.
The detective draws his legs up under himself and turns his body so he sits sideways. John sits gingerly on the far end and stares resolutely forward. In profile, the strain marking John's face is amplified. His eyes are puffy and ringed by deep wrinkles. His whole frame sags into the sofa as the weight of three years, of endless secrets, of gravity itself bears him down.
Across the lab, John’s stomach gave a loud grumble. “Lunch time for me,” he said briskly. “Want me to bring anything back for you?” He asked without even looking up. He clearly did not expect Sherlock to answer.
