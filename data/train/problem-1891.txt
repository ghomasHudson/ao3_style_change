"Call me Liz, please Doctor Watson." She smiled up at the army doctor, extending a hand to him, which he took immediately, shaking it. As he did, a few strands of hair fell out of her bun. She tucked them behind her ear with her gloved hands.
"Jesus, Mycroft! You didn't think to knock before you just walk into our flat?" Mycroft eyed John lazily. Clearly the army doctor was still on edge after their talk that morning, but he disregarded the tone of annoyance and anger that was dripping from every syllable John spoke.
"John, if you're under the impression that suffering from temporary amnesia as a result of a head injury has awakened my appreciation for life and that I will now strive to be a better - and consequently more polite - human being, then I'm afraid to say that you are mistaken. Clearly nothing has been done to improve your intelligence during my - as you keep delightfully referring to as - 'little memory blip'."
It was the time of year where the evenings were still warm. John scanned the area for an available taxi, before spotting the sleek black car which rolled gracefully up to the curb. The door opened and John hurried in. Anthea was seated next to him in the back, once again tapping away on her beloved phone and not paying the slightest attention to John.
"Yeah, okay, give me a minute." John fumbled in his coat pockets until he finally found his phone and began to type out the instructions for Lestrade.
Greg let go of Mycroft, looking absolutely disgusted, before pushing through the door into the room where John was being held.
He removed his head from his hands, and found Mrs Hudson’s eyes. Before he knew it, he was telling her everything.
"I could say the same think about you," Sherlock's rich baritone ran out through the cold air. If he was feeling at all tense or anxious his voice certainly did not give it away. Sherlock sounded the epitome of calm and collected. "Very clever stunt you pulled all those years ago."
“The game is never over, John but there may be some new players now. It’s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
The crux of the matter was that John was scared. What if he was reading too much into the use of his middle name? What if he had got his hopes up that a miracle had occurred and the man in the next room was the same man who John had been living with these past weeks?
But John wasn’t looking at him. In fact, he appeared to be avoiding his eyes determinedly. And he looked angry. Very very angry. Sherlock frowned. That reaction didn’t make any sense. Why would John be angry at Trelawney’s prediction? Perhaps he’d wanted love for his own? Or…. Did he not like the idea of Sherlock meeting someone? But that didn’t make any sense…
Hours earlier John had convinced Sherlock to let go of him momentarily just so he could grab a flannel from the bathroom and clean them up both, insisting they would end up sticky and crusty if he didn’t. Sherlock pouted in protest but was convinced after a couple of kisses and a gentle hand coursing through his sweaty curls.
John groaned, scribbling out the hundredth attempt at a letter for Sherlock. He was determined to have this conversation with him once and for all, and he figured… if it was written down he wouldn’t have to die of mortification with whatever answer Sherlock gave. If Sherlock was indeed looking to avoid him, he could just write it down and then John would quietly slip into the gloom of embarrassment and hide out whenever he saw Sherlock anywhere in his proximity. Simple enough.
John shut his book, smiling fondly. “Fine. Let’s do something else. Something to distract that brain” he turned to Sherlock. “Quidditch? Movies?” he paused, turning to grin at Sherlock “Pirates?”
The artist nodded, still unable to speak around his puffing breaths. His hands clutched at his lover's back in an almost hug, needing to be held. John, understanding, kept on holding him tight, raised his lips and kissed his cheeks and closed eyelids. Sherlock let out a quiet shuddering breath, the question of what they meant to each other dying on the tip of his tongue and the seam of his open lips, knowing he wouldn’t be able to bear it if John didn’t feel the same intensity as he did for him. And in this moment, as John whispered compliments and endearments in his ear it was so easy to pretend that they were already together and that John would never let go.
John smiled and followed the path of Sherlock’s tongue across his lower lip, his pupils dilating, “Good”, he replied.
“Hello, Mr. Holmes” the woman purred, stopping in front of Sherlock’s desk. “So glad you finally booked me for one of your classes again”
It took everything John had but pulled back momentarily, both of them instantly taking gasping breaths and panting as if they had run for miles. “Sher-“ John gasped out. “Have-“
Sherlock just smirked, “Well at least you can tick off that last one on the list” he glanced down at John’s legs.
He led them close to the fire where, regrettably, they had to let go of each other’s hands as they divested their soaked coats, gloves, heavy winter boots and scarves. Since they basically had the common room to themselves (no other Gryffindor had stayed behind for the winter break) they just dropped their sodden garments on the floor.
“Okay?” Sherlock asked softly. “It was perfect. I’ve been wanting this for so long… wanting you for so long”.
In the end, the most prominent emotion he had up till now was anger. A familiar buzz in his veins thrummed to the beat of his whirling thoughts. He’d already been hurt enough when Sherlock had never attempted to make contact with him. HIM. Someone, Sherlock had claimed was his very best friend. His
“It’s perfect” he smiled up at Sherlock “Thank you”. He didn’t even bother to ask how Sherlock knew he didn’t take sugar. Of course, he knew.
He just gaped for a moment before making a mental note to slip that last one into his jacket pocket before Sherlock could do anything rash and followed.
have a broad collection of books… but they’re mostly boring charms. Hogwarts has a much more extensive variety in the dark arts. Especially in the restricted section”, he mused.
Molly beamed right back, practically jumping out of her skin in excitement. “This is so great, John!”
The anxiety of not seeing John again had made Sherlock cling to him tightly, desperately. He silently begged John not to leave. Not to see her again. To stay with him always. But he didn’t voice anything, knowing exactly what John’s response would be, and scared to see the disappointment in his eyes and to hear the heartbreaking words leave those rosy lips.
John seemed oblivious to the woman’s interest, or at least Sherlock hoped so. He was still talking rapidly, gesturing about something around himself and then pressing his hands to his chest as if talking about something emotional. She nodded, smile still perfectly intact and responded with equal enthusiasm, throwing in a wink in his direction and then reaching her hand out as if preparing to receive something. Sherlock’s heart was thumping rapidly in his chest, this time so forcefully and so uncomfortably… different to the nerves John usually sparked inside his body. His eyebrows rose slowly in alarm as the blonde handed her his cellphone. She took it with a smile and began typing something onto it, John peered onto the screen to observe.
A thought, however, popped into Sherlock’s slowly whirring back into place after the mind shattering sex. “John?” he whispered into the darkness.
With resignation to finish this painting tonight in his mind, he quickly cleaned his paint brushes with turpenoid (he detested the smell of turpentine), stretched his arms and neck and headed to take a bath before he had to head out for work. After all, all those student loans, the apartment rent (even when halved by his darling landlady Mrs.Hudson) and the gas and electricity bills would not pay themselves.
John kissed Sherlock’s forehead gently “I would love to move in. But don’t think we’ll be needing two bedrooms, love” he teased, nudging at Sherlock’s face to reach his lips.
“Well, she approached me when you were speaking with Dimmock” he started, encouraged by Sherlock’s nod to continue, “I admit it did seem as if she was trying to hit on me at first, asking how I knew you and why she’d never seen me around before, that sort of thing” He shrugged, Sherlock’s eyes narrowed slightly, glad he knew she definitely had been interested but feeling the sudden urge to cover John’s body with his possessively.
“Okay… okay” John murmured soothingly. He took a couple of steps forward before turning back to Sherlock who was still frozen in place, hands trembling by his sides.
Gladstone blinked, which John took as a sign that he understood. He placed the letter in front of Gladstone, and the owl clasped it with his small yellow beak. Fortunately, John’s bed was situated directly beside the window which John usually left open when the room became stuffy. Gladstone fluttered outside, wings outstretched and sunk into the darkness.
It was all so clear now. They’d just been so caught up in what was going on elsewhere in their lives that they’d failed to recognise the symptoms for what they were.
John was wearing the same as what he wore to Moriarty’s trial, minus the tie. He wanted to look smart, but the tie felt suffocating. It felt like a noose, waiting to choke him, to cut off his air.
There was a crumpling sound as John clenched his fists around the delicate paper. His eyes snapped up to Sherlock as he instantly put the paper on the table, turning his full attention to Sherlock.
Revealing to John that his attempted murderer was actually his wife was the hardest thing that Sherlock had ever done in his life, because he knew it was going to hurt John. So Sherlock sat with them both, he stayed clam, he was the strength when John could not be strong, despite the fact that he was bleeding internally, but that was okay, because John needed him, and Sherlock would not let him down.
John needed this, he needed the comfort, and was grateful that Sherlock had the good sense to deduce what John needed.
“Fine,” he sighed, exasperated and irritated. He moved out of the kitchen and into the living room, flopping magnificently and
Alvarez raised an eyebrow at him, finally taking his eyes away from his food. He was a large man, as you'd expect a rich, powerful drug lord who clearly enjoyed the finer things in life - if the room they we currently in was anything to go by - to be. He wiped the corner of his mouth with a delicate, white napkin before speaking again. His accent was not as heavy as those of his employees, but he would be more experienced in the English language, as it would have been an essential part of his drug business.
In fact, one of the main reasons John was here was to make sure Sherlock didn’t relapse, because in his mind, he wasn’t, he was just picking up where he left off. Although Sherlock had mentioned none of this to the doctors examining him, they had determined that Sherlock couldn’t remember the past five years, and five years ago, Sherlock had been in a dark place in the confines of his brilliant mind. As a doctor, he knew all about addictions and the marks they leave behind on the lives of the addict, and the people around them, he was prepared for any circumstance. As a friend, it terrified John to even consider that Sherlock would fall so easily back into addiction’s unyielding grip.
Sherlock swallowed, and he began to fiddle with the blanket he was sat on. John waited. He had all day, and - according to reliable sources including, Mrs Hudson, Mary and Lestrade - the patience of a saint. John folded his arms and just watched, waiting.
“For now, we must let them alone. It’s unwise for either of us to be in direct contact with Sherlock, and he will most likely not let us contact John either.” Mycroft thought momentarily. “I will employ the services of a mediator. Someone close to Sherlock enough for him to trust them, and someone who was equally in the dark about Doctor Watson’s state of being. Hopefully this person will allow us to communicate to Sherlock and John, and will be happy to help us talk him round.”
Another flash of colour. A brilliant blood red splattered across a gloomy grey. And there was John’s face again. This time his face was above Sherlock, angled down towards him. The same blank, empty look clouded his features.
"No, Sherlock. I'm not going to let you do that." John's voice was shaking in poorly hidden rage, and Sherlock flinched again at the harsh tone. He needed to get over weaknesses like this. He was in 221B, he was with John, he was
“We’ve got time. We have all night.” John looked back up at Sherlock as he said it, and his fingers clutched a little tighter around Sherlock’s in what he hoped was a reassuring pressure.
If Mycroft Holmes had seemed terrified before, it had been absolutely nothing compared to the look on his face as Sherlock spat these words with as much venom as a man could.
Sherlock pulled away. Obviously, Sherlock wanted to continue to comfort John, but there were more important matters that required his attentions.
Since their return to Baker Street, Sherlock had reacquainted himself with his beloved home. Losing his memory had left him out of sync and he had spent the previous evenings just sat in his leather armchair, breathing in the atmosphere withing the wall of 221B. He had been happy, content to just sit there forever listening to the sounds of life both inside and outside of the flat. He listened to Mrs Hudson shuffling carefully up the stairs to check up on her two boys, to the sounds of the cabs driving past their windows, the laughter and conversations of the customers of Speedy's. But his favourite sound was that of John. Just John, existing, breathing, living. He was a reassuring presence in the flat, and Sherlock relied on it to keep him calm whilst he solved the Moriarty enigma.
‘I may not understand sentiment, but I do recognise it. And this must be what it feels like.’ Sherlock thought. He cared for the doctor just as the doctor cared for him. Not in a sexual way, or in any way that would cause them to be a couple. No, they didn’t work like that. But they knew that they would risk their lives to save the other. Hadn’t Sherlock already proved that?
Maybe one day, he would go back to Sherlock and try to help him again. It seemed unfair that he had to miss out on these things. John had his doubts that he’d be let back into Sherlock’s life after what he said. He was partially responsible for the rift that had been forced between him and his best friend – okay, almost entirely responsible.
But Sherlock welcomed that madness. How could he reject it if it was bringing him John? Sherlock, of course, knew that it was not actually John. He might have been driven mad with grief (as cliche as it sounded), but he was not an idiot.
This was the signal that John had been waiting for. He launched his entire body backwards, catching Moran by surprise and causing them both to fall backwards. Moran released John I'm favour of using his arms to break his fall and in doing so released his grip on the gun, which was sent skidding along to where Sherlock and Moriarty were currently locked in a fight. Joh. Fell back onto Moran, who acted as a safety mat for John. John scrabbled off of his back and turned to face Moran, pulling out his Sig from where Sherlock had hidden it. Without hesitating, he shot Moran in the head, killing him immediately.
“Detour?” John roused himself from his thoughts and what she had said began to register. He was just about to ask why they needed a detour before he answered his own question. His exasperated sigh filled the silence that had fallen upon the car. He gazed out of the window, watching the tiny water droplets collect into much larger ones, before racing each other down and across the smooth, tinted glass.
One month. He had spent one month away from John. He was exhausted; he felt paper thin, translucent. And most importantly, he was alone again. He had not sought out John, but John had not sought him out either. But why would he? John did not feel for Sherlock as Sherlock felt for John. John had a wife now, and a baby on the way. John didn’t need him anymore.
John shifted uncomfortably where he stood, but his gaze was still steady, eyes fixed on Sherlock, demanding an answer.
"Because the door was unlocked and I knew I wasn't interrupting anything of importance," he could see Johns fists clench, but continued to talk. By now, John was seething. "I need a word with my brother, it does not concern yourself, Dr Watson, I would not expect you to understand the urgency."
“Well, it was very convincing.” The two men chuckled lightly. John drained the remainder of his tea, checked his watch and reached for the television remote. He could hear Sherlock rolling his eyes. “Sherlock, if you’re so against watching the news, go and play the violin in your room.”
As stood at the end of the bed and he stared at the pale, lifeless being that was laid out it, John’s mind replayed the moment he had walked back into his old flat and found Sherlock.
No-one, not even Donovan, had ever shown this much contempt for Sherlock so quickly – at least not to John’s knowledge.
“You too, Sherlock. Please, come and visit us again, any time. Just give us a bit more warning next time, okay?” A smirk appeared at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
The driver ignored him, continuing to drive along their route and not turning around to even acknowledge him. Cartoon clouds appeared over a blue backdrop, and the screen faltered momentarily. When it returned, there was a face, smiling manically out at him. The screen faltered once more.
Someone closed the door to 221 behind him. Possibly Mrs Hudson. Sherlock's mind was too preoccupied to remember that Mrs Hudson had left that afternoon for her sister's. There were more important things to think about.
'We can't giggle, it's a crime-scene!' His own words echoed in his head as he followed Sherlock as he exited Mycroft's office in a swirl of black coat and blue scarf.
Occasionally, John would be wrenched from sleep by dreams of a very different ending to the rooftop scene from months ago. But Sherlock would always be there, be it to provide a source of comfort, or to sooth John back to sleep by playing the gentlest and most beautiful melodies on his violin.
As he had seen on Sherlock’s face earlier, a cold fury had settled over Lestrade’s features, all aimed at Mycroft.
When John Watson’s best friend was lying unconscious in a hospital, he hated them. The lights were too bright, the machines were too loud, but more importantly, it had been three days, and Sherlock was still unconscious and the doctors who had been assigned to him had not done a thing about it.
“You!” Sherlock found that once again, he couldn’t move. He man’s smile grew wider, and more terrifying.
When he heard John's heart stop, he felt his eon leap into his throat. They could not lose John, it was imperative that he survived, for both his own and Sherlock's sakes. Mycroft would never forgive himself if he was responsible from not only removing John from his life, but also for John's death.
"John, you need to understand. I never meant to cause any of this. I had to!" The tone of his voice was desperate as he tried to make his friend understand.
Instead she looped one of her arms through Sherlock's, who - surprisingly - raised no arguments, and continued to walk into the night.
Except John didn’t seem happy. Why? Sherlock was confused. He had done everything in his power to ensure John’s happiness, so why did John not seem so?
“And Sherlock. If you honestly believe that leaving would be the best way forward for both of you, I suggest you take a look at yourself in the mirror, and then the man on the sofa. Just the thought of you leaving has got you both in a complete state.”
He'd found that his abilities of deduction had somewhat vanished after John's death. Prolonged shock, Molly had said. He'd still not leave that flat for anything other than his dinners with Molly. It wasn't that he particularly enjoyed them, but he knew everyone would stop fussing as long as he left the flat at least once a week. Molly's company was tolerable, if not a little annoying as her persistent infatuation with him reared it's head every now and again. But Sherlock didn't mind that in exchange for keeping everyone else, particularly Mycroft at bay. And they got a free meal out of it, Angelo still insisting that everything they ate was on the house.
John’s eyes snapped open. He knew Sherlock was right, of course he was.  He could practically hear Sherlock’s brain whirring, figuring, calculating. He watched him with intent. John liked to just watch Sherlock when he was thinking. He often tried to figure out what thoughts must be running through the genius’s head. It was fascinating.
“He slipped and fell and dropped almost everything. I ran over to help him pick everything up. He told me that I must have been his knight in woollen armour. He had the most appalling sense of humour, but he made me laugh. The first thing he said and it made me laugh.”
John let out a humourless laugh. "I'm always bloody worried, Greg. Ever since he came back I've been worried."
Once John had finally calmed down completely, Sherlock had reached the flaw in his plan. He couldn’t leave John again, it would kill him. It was too dangerous. If this is what a 10 minute separation did to him, Sherlock wasn’t going to risk leaving him, even for one night, So that left two options.
Sherlock stayed staring at John’s face for hours, until the sun began to rise through the window. Just as London was waking itself back up, did Sherlock allow himself to relax, and eventually his eyes closed and he succumbed to sleep’s clutches, slumped over the bed, safe in the knowledge that John was alive, and still grasping John’s hand within both of his own.
Sherlock had never faced such a difficult decision. Choosing to jump off of the roof of Bart's was easier than this. But the consequences of that decision...
Sherlock watched the world from the window of 221B. He saw the sun rise and set. He saw the never ending cycle of the moon. He saw as the very air around them changed as London moved through the seasons. He spent nearly an entire year just watching at the window.
"You're a deduced, Sherlock. Deduce." Mycroft watched as his baby brother tried to piece it all together.
Sherlock stood there, eyeing the woman. Sherlock was impressed, but made no obvious sign. John could tell though, by the way he angled himself slightly toward her, and the corners of his mouth twitched up ever so slightly. Sherlock was hardly one for smiles and hugs, especially around new people. He buried his hands in the pockets of his coat, still watching, analyzing.
Greg entered the flat. Absolutely nothing had changed since John had died, expect from the thick layer of dust that seemed to have settled onto every non-moving surface in the flat.
He had done so well all day. He hadn't broken down, and had managed to hold himself together in front of everyone. And there had been so many people. Any other day, Sherlock would have been proud of himself for behaving. But not today. He took in a deep breath and began to ascend the stairs.
“Go to the family, ask about the girls previous relationships. Arrest the man who fits the description.”
It would kill Sherlock for John to admit this, but Mycroft had been right. Sherlock was here perfectly healthy, memory restored.
, and I was so in love. Our life was absolutely fantastic. I came home one day and she was waiting for me with the most amazing news. She was pregnant. I was going to be a
“State of my marriage, right there,” John finished, grinning as he remembered their first case together. Sherlock looked at him, confused but also surprised. John looked down at his left hand and twisted the ring off his finger for closer inspection. Sherlock held out his hand, and John immediately handed it to him, and Sherlock proceeded to examine the ring, twisting and turning it in his long, slender fingers. The trust was there, and Sherlock could see that, he just didn’t understand why John trusted him so wholly. For now, John was content to give him an answer to the questioning looks. “On our first case together, you deduced that the deceased woman was a serial adulterer from the state of her wedding ring. All her other jewelry was clean, but her wedding ring was dirty, except on the inside. The only cleaning it got was when she worked it off her finger, and that’s a direct quote from you by the way.” John shot Sherlock a grin, pleased with himself for remembering, and hoping that the glimmer of a memory was somewhere within the foggy, blurry confines of Sherlock’s mind palace.
Molly was insisting on taking Sherlock out to dinner at least once a week. Usually they went to Angelo's, as the food was free and the atmosphere was tolerable. But they stayed well away from the window booth. That was his and John's place there was absolutely no way Sherlock was ever going to let anyone take that place.
It was the first time he had ever been to Angelo’s, a tiny Italian restaurant tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main streets of London. John had held open the door and pulled out Sherlock’s chair, the shining of example of a perfect gentleman. The food had been amazing, but the company was better. John was funny, intelligent and managed to hold Sherlock’s attention all night. Sherlock listened to John’s stories all night, watching how his face beautifully expressed all of his emotions, and how the candlelight reflected in his eyes made him look almost mythical. He was the most interesting person that Sherlock had ever met, and he was smitten.
When Sherlock came back form his flashback, he noticed he was doubled over in pain, hands clutching his skull so forcefully that it felt like he was going to crush it. The pain kept building, an uncomfortable pressure was rising just behind his eyes and he began to feel nauseous. Never had a memory been so strong – not only an image, but a conversation, and even emotions. But with a memory this strong, the headache that Sherlock was experiencing was the most painful yet.
John had typed out the whole of Sherlock’s story, but had not published it. Sherlock guessed that John had the same idea as him when it came to publicity. Keep it secret until they were ready, and John was obviously not ready.
John had been completely broken. He had grieved. Admittedly, Sherlock hadn't thought John would mourn his loss. He didn't comprehend how much he meant to John. And John meant the world to him too. Listening to John's words as he lay on the pavement, unable to move for fear of exposing himself, then separating from him for two years - it was hard. It had taken it's toll on the both of them.
John knew in the logical, medical part of his brain that they were doing the right thing. There was no major damage that they could find, however they would be more sure when he woke up and they could perform a more thorough check. The only thing they could do was wait.
John's thought's were interrupted by the high-pitched chiming sound of his phone. He put his glass back on the surface of the bar and pulled the ringing device out of his pocket. Lestrade looked towards him questioningly. John ignored him in favour of checking the caller ID. His blood ran cold. He hit the 'accept call' button quickly and aggressively, nearly knocking the phone out of his own hand, and bought it up to his ear.
John left then, he couldn't put up with Mycroft for an extended period of time, especially if he's skirting the issue and being mysterious.
Sherlock's face drained of the little colour that was there. He was never told. This information, it was new. Mycroft promised that it wouldn't happen. He stood up and made a move towards John, but John brought up his hands to tell him to stay put.
A hand came to rest on his shoulder. A strong, steady hand which wasn't shaking. If Sherlock looked down, he would notice that his own were shaking quite violently. He turned his head slowly to the hand on his shoulder. His eyes continued to follow the arm attached to it until he saw the face of Lestrade. Sherlock noted that Lestrade's eyes were filled with an aching sadness, there were more lines to his face now, and he looked exhausted. The last case had drained him. It had drained the entirety of Lestrade's team. It was tough, for everyone. Especially Sherlock.
Now he knew how Sherlock felt, now he knew for sure how he himself felt, John wanted everything. But would Sherlock? Sure, Sherlock had declared his love for John in his suicide note (John’s stomach clenched at the terrible reminder), but that didn’t mean he would still want to be with John when he woke up. After all the pain John had put him though, he would be surprised if Sherlock wanted anything to do with him. After all, Sherlock had believed that being with Mary would make him happy. And John had believed that too.
“Yes, John. I visited the hospital roof as soon as Molly had performed the body swap. He’s gone. My checks were incredibly thorough. Molly helped me move him, of course. Couldn’t have the Yard snooping around up there after he was supposed to be an actor. Too suspicious.”
John took his hand after a moment of hesitation. Sherlock felt the warmth of John’s skin seem through his palm. He wanted nothing more than to pull him into a tight embrace and keep him there forever. But John Watson was not his, and therefore he did not have the right to make suha request of him. Instead, Sherlock turned and boarded the plane, making his way towards certain death.
He hadn't gone far, just to the stairs before his exhausted body dropped onto the top step, his hands burying themselves into the silver stands atop his head. He could still hear the music floating from he flat. The click of a door closing muffled the music slightly, and then slow, steady footsteps approached him as he sat there, cradling his own head in his hands and trying very hard not to feel the pain that was being communicated through Sherlcok's playing.
"Everyone's been telling me I need to get out more and actually eat so etching decent, and is way we'd be killing two birds with one stone."
The evening in baker Street was filled with a relaxed haze that often settled over them during the lull between cases. John had learned to enjoy these nights whilst he could, because at any given moment a client could turn up or they could get a phone call from and exhausted sounding Lestrade requesting their presence.
God, he felt like a teenager, he felt pathetic, how much could a man cry in one lifetime? John Watson felt like he was crying for the rest of mankind. He fished his phone out of his pockets and dialed the number of the only person he felt like talking to, because they would not pity him, they would let him cry. They would make everything better, because they always did.
“You really shouldn’t leave so early,” Mycroft interrupted turning to Sherlock. “What will the reporter’s say?”
Still. Kissing him had been wrong. No matter how good it had felt. He should’ve made his intent clear and let Sherlock take the step. Especially if he had never kissed anyone. Which John doubted, considering how gorgeous Sherlock was. He must be lined up with romantic candidates. Maybe he even had a relationship right now and his significant other would now be hunting John down for taking their boyfriend’s plush pink lips.
This artist was Sherlock Holmes. And currently, he was trying desperately to figure out how to perfect his latest painting.
A sudden knock at his studio’s door interrupted his wandering mind and he jumped, almost knocking over his empty cup of tea on the table beside him as he rose up quickly from his seat.
“Well I think you should. Lord knows I’ve never seen you bring anyone over, aside from that brother and the detective inspector once in a while. And oh my goodness you need someone to take care of you! Feed you up! Aside from myself of course, but I’m not going to be here forever. At my time of life..”
The class wore on sluggishly, in the break John had gotten a phone call. Sherlock tried not to think too hard about that. The good news was the blonde seemed quite annoyed as he had walked out of the room to answer, maybe even surprised that whoever was calling was doing so. Maybe he had gone out with the woman but they hadn’t had a good time. Maybe he would not see her again! Sherlock tried to suppress his tiny smug smile.
The cab stopped in front of his apartment, and tossing some bills to the driver, John sighed and went up to his empty apartment. Resolving to not pressure Sherlock into talking to him again. If Sherlock wanted to see him and was willing to forgive and forget John’s monumental idiocy, he would.
John chuckled “Fine. THREE, TWO, ONE…. GO!” They both threw the balls into the air and John zoomed in slamming down the bat and sending the ball flying directly into the middle hoops on Sherlock’s side. Sherlock, in turn, held the bat with both hands and swung as hard as he could to his own ball, desperate to get to John’s rapidly approaching ball, but just then John whooshed in front of Sherlock and intercepted the Beauxbatons ball, sending it alongside the other to Sherlock’s right hoop.
“You guys...” he panted “You aren’t supposed to come upstairs without me. They wouldn’t have let you in.” he gasped a couple of times “Wait for me next time. I had to run up the stairs”. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand and motioned them forward “come along then.” He started walking down the narrow hallway towards his left.
Mind made up Sherlock stalked to his laptop sitting on his desk and opened up the school’s website and onto the teachers section under his name. He scrolled through the list of next week’s available models and found ‘John H. Watson’. He hesitated briefly over the button that read
Sherlock smiled and walked alongside her towards the Quidditch field. “Not my fault Anderson’s an idiot” he grinned.
“John” Sherlock gasped “Please. Now” he breathed, still shuddering helpless and arching toward John, bearing down on the breaching fingers harshly, needing more.
They’d made their way to the class and as fate had had it, John was to be sitting directly in front of the younger Holmes boy, who incidentally looked nothing like the elder Holmes, a chubby and big nosed 5th year that had the reputation of having the habit of stealing all the leftover cakes from the school’s kitchen.
They walked into the store and a heavy scent of old and new books drifted through the air. While Margaret Watson checked her mobile and Jack waited by the cashier waiting to pay for whatever Harry picked out, John drifted away from Harry’s side, feeling curious as he caught some of the titles around him. He saw everything, from “Magical beasts and where to find them” to “Quidditch through the ages”. What even
John went slowly, letting Sherlock’s body adjust and whispering soft words into his ear, Sherlock did his best to focus, but caught only strands and bits of the sentences; “gorgeous”, “perfect”, “Yes”, “Amazing”… it was enough for the artist, with just those he could feel his tension melt away as he experimentally bore down onto John’s cock and felt himself be filled even further. More pleasure than pain, now, rippling down his spine.
When the 30-minute mark alarm sounded to indicate it was finally time for lunch everyone sighed in relief. Sherlock huffed out a laugh, he really wasn’t THAT demanding, was he?
“Newborn mandrakes John! They have amazing magical qualities! They grow at alarming rates so finding them at this stage is really quite rare,” he peered into the pot, enthralled. “Maybe if I just…” he reached over to the tips of the leaves peeking out of the dark soil.
“Yeah, I figured” Molly laughed “So tell me, John... How much more do I have to torture you before you tell me why you were spying on Sherlock hmm?”
He felt Sherlock lightly tap his tongue with his own, hesitant and unsure. Again the question of Sherlock’s experience popped into John’s head. Sherlock was far too good at this to be new at it… but then again, this was Sherlock.
John nodded, humming an agreement. “Could I…” he paused, seeming nervous and uncertain “Could I see?” he motioned with his head towards Sherlock’s drawing. Sherlock blinked, surprised that John would show interest in Sherlock’s art at all. No other model had ever asked Sherlock if they could see his drawings, probably presuming that he would write all his deductions about their deepest secrets or afraid that if they saw himself in their drawing they would somehow be able to see them just as clearly too.
“So you're telling me… Acromantulas are.. spiders?” John asked, eyes wide with shock. Sherlock lost his train of thought, thoughtful frown turning into an amused smirk.
The first summer John spent learning everything he could about the magical world and Sherlock spent it learning everything he didn’t know about the muggle world. It seemed like the first week was a series of incessant questions going from “What’s this?” to “Why do muggles/wizards use this?”, both of them tripping over each other to know more about their opposite worlds. Sherlock had taught him about Quidditch and even let him borrow one of his many brooms, not that they could even fly them as neither of them had had any signs that they were magic. But they pretended just fine. They threw the bludgers around and did their best to catch an old snitch Sherlock’s mother owned from when she played Quidditch in school.
“I...” Sherlock muttered. “Fine. I might’ve been the cause of the potion exploding. But how was I supposed to expect that it would affect every spider in a 20km radius so drastically?”
This, combined with the awful smells they emit caused Mycroft to ban them from the house and Eliza to demand they each take at least 3 baths each before dinner.
“Hey Sherlock!” he called out, relieved at the sight of the clearly nervous Beauxbatons. Sherlock had just enough time to look up in surprise when John yanked him enthusiastically by the arm and pulled him towards his friends at the Gryffindor table.
Sherlock’s smile faded. “Are you…” he spoke softly “Are you alright? I was... I” he bit his lip, unable to get the words out.
John sighed, laying down on his bed but leaving the curtain open so he could see when Gladstone came back. He stared up at the ceiling, trying not to panic too much about Sherlock’s response. If there was one at all, anyway.
“I think I’d rather do standing now. Get it over with.” he positioned himself in the centre of the stage and started untying his robe. Sherlock busied himself with the lights, placing the around the stage, some overhead and some below, and finally when he felt the air rush past from John dropping the robe and swinging it onto the floor off of the platform Sherlock knew that he had to adjust the lighting to John’s body so he took a breath, and looked up.
John stroked his thumb across the artist’s palm, prompting a small shiver from the latter. He felt his eyes flutter in pleasure and he hummed happily.
“NO” Sherlock snapped, taking a step back as John reached closer and closer, taking tentative steps against the mossy surface of the wooden roof.
It all started one Sunday morning, surrounded by Eliza Holmes’s marvellous pancakes, omelettes and an array of breakfast biscuits laid on the table. Sherringford was to be out for most of the summer and Mycroft had taken up an internship at the ministry for the summer, so it was just the three of them.
They never took it further, John soothingly stripping Sherlock of his shirt but nothing more. He had assured Sherlock that they didn’t have to do anything if he didn’t feel like it. The artist had tried to deny it, tried to kiss him harder to make him see that he could. That he’d do anything for John. That he wanted him. He would always want him. But the blonde had only slowed their kisses and held him tight. He’d guided him onto the bed and covered them both, whispering soothing words in Sherlock’s ear until they both fell asleep, tangled together.
“This is great! I love what you’ve done with the place” He turned around to face Sherlock, still looking around himself. “Love the.. uh, is that a skull?” he shook his head, grinning as if he should’ve known to expect a skull sitting on the male right under a dissected bat.
He still hadn’t seen even the slightest glimpse of the Beauxbatons anywhere but decided that if Sherlock wanted to see him, he would. So he wouldn’t worry about it anymore. Or he would try not to anyway.
Sherlock bit his lip, his heart thundering against his chest. He couldn’t say anything, afraid he’d be wrong or had somehow misunderstood. Because somehow it sounded like John… like John meant that…. It couldn’t be that he actually meant to sound like he... Sherlock cleared his throat, saying the first words that came to mind, “because… because you're an idiot?”.
Sherlock tried to smile back, feeling like he probably failed miserably “Uh yeah... Would you um… Would you like some tea, John? Take a seat, make yourself at home” without waiting for an answer he turned towards his left and onto the kitchen, feeling his face flaming hot red with nerves.
“I know… I just... He means well, he’s just… temperamental. And… I just can’t leave him. I can’t… What would happen to us?” her voice was a whisper, and John knew the question wasn’t directed at him, so he didn’t answer. Instead, he just held on to her as her breaths calmed slowly. Eventually, she pulled back taking a deep breath and smiling that familiar smile that made John feel much more loved and welcome in a house even in where he had no family ties.
John clenched and unclenched his free hand, barely containing his anger. He remembered that scum of a man vividly. The way he treated Sherlock. And the way he treated his mother. It was absolutely despicable. He remembered seeing him corner her in their kitchen and yell abuse at her, how the only thing that stopped him was the explosion of the small flower pot John had accidentally detonated in his anger. For a moment now, John wished that the exploding pot had been Sherringford. He exhaled shakily, trying to calm himself down. “None of this is your fault, Sherlock. None of it” he leaned closer to the Beauxbatons, who was looking down at his folded hands with a pained look. John swallowed down with difficulty, his throat dry. “After he left… that was about a year ago right? After that… why didn’t you write then? I would’ve come to you, Sherlock. I would’ve done anything.”
He stopped in the corridor. His eyes moved up the stairs. In their flat, above his head, stood Sherlock’s best friend, who now finally understood everything. He allowed a smile to spread across his face and he strode up the stairs two at a time. He reached the top and paused. His smile had not gone from his face, but he forcibly removed it, resuming his cool, blank expression as he entered the flat.
Sherlock grinned happily, closing the book and hurriedly placing it and the pencils behind him on the bedside table. He slid back into the sleepy warmth of John’s arms, the delight of once again being pressed skin to skin with John Watson made his heart swell and his stomach flutter joyfully.
Chapter two!! Im getting really into writing this story so I hope it sets well with you guys <3<3<3 Thanks so much for being so sweet <3<3
“Pfff I knew this class was a fraud!” another blue robed student whispered back. They both snickered maliciously.
“What. The. HELL. Is going on here?”  Sherringford deadpanned. Both boys turned to look at him, feeling exposed and vulnerable. John had only seen Sherlock’s father looking like that this time last year when he’d seen him yell at Eliza.
The students looked at the woman that had just walked in inquiringly, somehow haven expected John to walk into the room again, beaming at their professor. The model today was one they knew, but that didn’t make her presence any less striking.
“It’s not… quite as nice as yours.” John shrugged, laughing nervously in clear self-consciousness. “But... it’s warm. And it’s close. And well... it’s home” he met the artist's eyes with a tiny nervous smile.
John watched the woman close the door and had felt a sudden rush of panic. He ran after her, needing to know if he too was special. If someday he would receive a letter just lie Harry’s and a promise of an escape to a magical land. The woman had smiled sympathetically but shook her head, “I’m afraid I don’t know, dear…Sometimes, sadly, only one sibling from muggle parents has the magical gift.”
Sherlock turned around, wondering why it bothered him that it wasn’t the “female attention” that John did not seek.
was so overwhelming, so grandiose that the necessity to be closer was palpable in the air. In the few weeks they’d been seeing each other Sherlock had guessed this might happen soon and was thus, prepared. He knew that John was clean, and he himself had never had any kind of sexual activity with anyone before John came along, but he’d bought condoms just in case John insisted, and a large bottle of lube.
Sherlock found that in a single facial expression he could depict the entire family history of a  heartbroken widow he had observed on the street. With a smoothly downturned collar and mismatched tie he drew on a middle-aged man he could represent an entire career in business and recent marriage problems. Sherlock came to realize that a way to make his mind stop buzzing with the overload of knowledge he could perceive in every passing stranger was to let it all out. He let out the deductions and experiences into pictures, images, sketches, silhouettes and paintings.
They approached the body, Sherlock instantly kneeling beside it and raising the man’s left hand for closer inspection. “What do you think John?”
In surprise at the outburst, Sherringford let his hold on John go. John, in turn, fell back onto the pillows with a loud oo
“Right. I didn’t. Umm. Yeah. That’s perfectly understandable. I don’t know what I was- uh.” Sherlock spluttered out, mentally berating himself and blushing to the very top of his ears embarrassedly.
the kissing. Sherlock made his way blindly to his usual spot at the Gryffindor table, lost in his thoughts about last night. After he left the Gryffindor common room last night he had spent every minute before he dozed off transferring all the data from that night into his mind palace. John’s warm touch. His fingers that had been hesitant at first but had quickly become hungry and wanting. Looking back now, everything they did was quite tame. Nothing more than an innocent snog on the couch. But last night, Sherlock had felt like he was on fire. Like John had set a burning flame of desire in him. He didn’t recall ever feeling like this. Like he could physically combust at any moment just by John’s warm touch.
“You’re just not pushing hard enough!” Sherlock gasped, pushing the books harder against his clothes.
5 years later John hopped down from the train onto the ground, the badge on his robes glinting slightly as it caught the last remnants of sunlight from the day. He grinned, looking around at his surroundings as people passed him by. It was his sixth year here… in his home. He breathed in the cooling dusk air as started walking in the direction of the crowd. Greg stepped down beside him, looking equally as relieved to be back.
Sherlock swerved past Dimmock, the Beauxbatons chaser, as he caught a glimpse of something golden zoom past on the other side of the field.
Breakfast passed quickly, in between John and Sherlock telling Greg and Molly about their childhood adventures and John’s first magical experience with their own version of Quidditch. To this Greg responded excitedly with his own first magical experience when he was 8 and had made his mother’s cat Scruffles invisible for about an hour and only noticed when he’d when he tripped over her and nearly fallen head first down stairs. Molly had had her first experience when she was 7 and she’d fallen off her father’s boat into the sea. At the time she hadn’t known how to swim and had rapidly sunk into the murky waters, but when her lungs could take no more and she instinctively opened her mouth instead of the gush of water she’d expected to flood her mouth and lungs, she found that she could breathe.
They reached the elevator, Sherlock not having noticed Lestrade had fallen behind until the doors had closed and he found himself left alone in an extremely enclosed space with John.  Said man cleared his throat, looking down at his feet self-consciously.
“I imagine” John breathed out “drawing this cheekbone, this mess of raven curls” he caught one of the with his index finger, his hand still not moving far from Sherlock’s pink soft face. “The lightning shock of your pale skin” John murmured, tracing his finger down Sherlock’s neck, feeling his sharp intake of breath. “Your sharp-cut jawline” he traced it delicately and Sherlock could picture the painting John was describing. For a moment, seeing himself the way John saw him. Not pointy and lanky but beautiful. Under John’s gaze, he felt so beautiful…
“Thank you, John… I don’t know what will happen. But I trust you. I just hope he doesn’t find out I’m here with you. Or that he finds out we’re… uh… you know”
Anyway... I do want to warn people that this chapter is a tad angsty-- there's an instance of a not-good relationship (NOT between Sherlock and John, obviously)- so if that's triggering please go ahead with caution. Again I promise NOTHING less than a super happy ending :)!
“Huh?” Sherlock looked up blearily, disoriented. He’d been sitting next to John’s bed since he’d been brought, still unconscious, about 7 hours ago. He’d been almost falling asleep until John had spoken.
John was blinking back tears, his grip on Sherlock’s thigh firm, supporting himself from crumbling down. “That bloody asshole… I can't believe he would do that…. Why?”
“Yeah. I’m okay”, the Beauxbatons muttered, eyes squeezed shut as he raised a hand to feel where he’s hurt his cheekbone. It was wet.
Greg raised an eyebrow, knowing there was more to it by the worried look on John’s face, but let it drop and followed his Quidditch captain through the dark hallway leading to the Quidditch field where the rest of the team was chatting with some Gryffindor girls that had come to watch the practice. After all, getting the captain annoyed certainly wasn’t on his list of favorite things to do. John was the nicest person he knew when he was happy but when he got mad.. well Greg shuddered just thinking about it. He certainly did not envy Sherlock and whatever it was he had done to make John upset.
To say ‘probably six pack’ had been a complete understatement. John was… absolutely ripped. Sherlock had to blink at least four times before the alarms in his mind palace could be silenced from the seconds of internal panic and the rush of blood not knowing whether to go upwards and pool in his already flaming cheeks or… lower. And now that he observed John without a shirt one of the first things that his eye was drawn to was the messy and extensive scar that spread in the blonde’s right shoulder. So clearly he had linked the pain of the bullet tearing through him onto his leg instead of his shoulder. And judging by the scar the wound had not been painless at all.
He started off towards the back of the room, John closely behind him, trying hard to keep up with Sherlock’s massive steps
“How could I regret you kissing me? When…” Sherlock had closed his eyes once again and rested his forehead against John’s. “When I cannot think of anything else anymore?”
“Sports injury?” Mary murmured, licking her lips and her gaze slipping down to John’s uncovered legs.
John beamed back, feeling warm and safe and suddenly not so long in this place full of dragons and wands and magic.
In the back of his mind, the artist knew they really shouldn’t be doing this. Not just because they were still in school…Still in his classroom. But because they really needed to sort themselves out. They needed to have a talk to know what they meant to each other. Whether this was just physical attraction and a way for both of them to get off- or whether John did, in fact, want something… more. But it was so difficult to think… with the other man’s hand around them both. Feeling him against his body, the grand expanse of chest sheathed in sweat, pliant and warm underneath his roaming hands. It was so hard to care about anything other than the man under him when he could pull John’s lips with his teeth, stroke John’s tongue with his tongue, elicit gorgeous deep moans from that exquisite throat every time he thrust into the tight hold of his closed fist.
“Absolutely John. They're just potion ingredients… Oh no, not that one! Maybe.. maybe just this one. And this one. And.. I'm sure a
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully “We used to get along…. When we were kids. But I was so different from the other kids… I never had many friends. I guess he became concerned about my well being when the bullying started” Sherlock rolled his eyes “Never left me alone after that. Not as company, mind you. More of a watchful prison guard.” He narrowed his eyes.
The halls of the school were completely empty and eerily quiet as John reminisced, with the exception of the faint rustle of autumn leaves being thrown into the drain pipes to block them by a sniggering Peeves.
The moment John had been waiting for what felt like an eternity had arrived. Maybe not THE moment but certainly one of the top ones.
John, in turn, taught Sherlock some muggle customs and games. Sherlock had been completely fascinated when John told him about pirates. He’d showed him a couple of his own picture books and a few movies and at first, Sherlock had scoffed, but John knew he’d been entranced by them. Especially since the entirety of their second summer had been spent pretending they were pirates. Eliza Holmes magicked two mattresses they used as boats to float around, not too high as if they were in water while both boys threw pillows at each other until one surrendered or fell off.
Sherlock watched him take a couple of steps away from him and panicked.  “John!” he shouted out unthinkingly. Suddenly, the thought of not seeing John for the rest of the day was somehow painful. And the look on John’s face… it was almost like he DIDN’T want them to be apart either. Like… he
Sherlock closed in on the golden sphere inches away from the tip of his broom, he stretched out his hand and… Sarah cut through Sherlock’s path, whooshing past him and sending the snitch flying in a completely different direction. The push forced Sherlock to dodge her by ducking in a dangerously steeped dive. Sarah was taken by surprise by the fast move and almost crashed into Soo Lin, who was focused on something else in the distance, bat at the ready. She lost her balance and dragged Sarah in. A tangle of frantic limbs clutched at the still airborne broom as Sarah’s crashed into the ground.
His father had been the one to give in to the insisting buzzing of the front door bell. John had turned to watch him walk towards it, mumbling under his breath. He peered through the door of the living room and down the hall to the opening door where his father stood and promptly gasped. He blinked several times, making sure that he was seeing correctly.
“Paul. Why must I always remind you to stop erasing so much? Stop questioning every single line you plant down? Gain momentum. Observe the model and REACT. Stop thinking so much. I can hear you thinking. It’s annoying”
“I- ah… yes. Talking. In… in a minute” Sherlock sighed back, pushing his chest onto John’s and tipping his head further to dip his tongue into John’s sweet
To John's surprise he had not been intimidated, but instead mesmerized by the dark haired boys’ strange features and sharp eyes. Were they blue? Green? Gray? He had no clue but he wanted, nay, needed to find out.
John huffed a laugh and shook his head “Nothing Greg don’t worry about it. Come on let’s go practice” He motioned towards the pitch with a nod of his head and started walking.
Eventually, John got his balance back and he tentatively skated over to Sherlock, who was already spinning around and doing small elaborate jumps. “Show off!” John teased. “Where’d you learn that anyway?”
He was, as usual, ridiculously early for his 7 am class, so he took his time to arrange the canvases around the platform where he would ask the model to pose, and started figuring out what he wanted to do with the lightning today. His models usually preferred standing up poses throughout the first half of the day and after the hour long lunch break they would agree to horizontal and sitting down poses. Not really surprising, as the energy in the room buzzed down to a calm lull of concentration after the frenzied energetic inspiration of the morning. 5-hour classes would do that for everyone. So he put the chair aside for now so the model could position himself anywhere on the stage and started setting up the overhead lights.
John considered this for a moment, before his eyes widened in realisation, and he looked around the flat, taking in the lack of evidence, or experiments.
He pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialled the number he knew so well. It dialled briefly before the person at the other end picked up, as Sherlock knew he would. He always started work a 5.30am, so by 6am, Sherlock should be able to speak to him whilst having his full attention.
And he remembered that he needed to keep fighting. He needed to get home to fix the life he had destroyed.
The depth of betrayal ran deep, and if Sherlock went alone to face Moriarty, he'd be pushing John to the limit.
John didn't think, he just moved until he had hold of Sherlock in his arms, pulling him into another tight hug. Sherlock returned it - hesitantly at first, as if afraid that John would break down at any second, but grew stronger as he realised he wasn't going to. It was strange for them to be so physically close in such a short space of time. This second time, however, they were not impeded by a hospital bed or IV lines.
Stage 4, malignant brain tumour. It was a secondary tumour, meaning the cancer had already spread far enough to affect her spine and nervous system. Inoperable, impossible to cure, but her life could be prolonged for a while.
Sherlock scoffed at this. Honestly, did people seriously believe that it was actually possible to ‘die of fright’. It was a ridiculous concept.
Sherlock came to visit regularly. He'd been taking cases again, Lestrade had called him in to solve a locked room murder – honestly, could New Scotland Yard really not solve these by now? There had been plenty of them!
She started violently, turning forcefully in her chair. Wen she realised who it was, she immediately relaxed. Then, she proceeded to hit him over the arm with her tiny, yet surprisingly forceful hands. The sensation of her hits seemed familiar, yet unwelcome. Sherlock caught her wrist in his own hands and held them out of hitting range. She pulled her hand out of his grasp and folded her arms across her body.
Sherlock glared at the woman with what John could only describe as a burning desire for her to be the next victim of a clumsy serial killer. The look even sent shivers down John’s spine. The woman shifted uncomfortably where she stood.
There was the sound of a car pulling up, and John saw the shape of a London taxi out of the window. Sherlock would have approved, London taxi’s being his preferred method of transport. Mary held open the door for him. He wrapped his arms around her again and kissed her. She made him promise to at least text her when he got there, and waved him off as the taxi began to move away. He sighed and pulled out his phone. He typed out a message and sent it.
“Sure, no problem.” The music cut off immediately, and Sherlock heard just how fast and deep he was breathing. He held his head between his hands as he tried to stop the pain and the spinning by rubbing hasty circles on his temples. It was no good, and it would continue to be no good until he got home. There, at least he had John to rely on to help him through this. At least, Sherlock thought, he hoped so.
One again, Sherlock was frozen. He couldn't bring himself to enter the flat. He envied the ease with which Lestrade just seemed to glide into the flat as if it wasn't emptied of life.
John nodded. His breathing was still heavy, and the possibility of this still being a dream, a trick his subconscious was playing on him as a new form of torture, was not off the cards just yet.
“Yes.” Mary looked at him, confused. John should have probably discussed this with her first, but now was not the time for discussion. “I do.” And in that moment, it was decided. John was returning to 221B Baker Street.
After establishing that he was most definitely in a hospital, John tired to think back to establish a reason for him being there in the first place.
Sherlock suddenly felt a surge of jealousy towards himself – the him that had gone on all of these incredible cases. It was hard to tell if the cases had really been like that, and if his deductions had been that amazing because John had a terrible habit of romanticizing things.
It had been over half a year since the incident on the roof, since Moriarty had died and finally left John and Sherlock to live in peace.
John watched, fascinated at the different emotions passing over Sherlock's face as he finished speaking. Wariness that Moriarty's web was larger than he'd first anticipated, anger at the fact that he had not realised this, excitement at the prospect of the game being back on as Moriarty's still out there, somewhere, pride and elation at John having reached the same conclusion as him, and fear. Fear of what?
He was going home, he was going back to John. He buried his face in his hands and tried to keep the tears at bay, only one thought echoing around his mind.
“I had to get back to work. There were two more assassins running around. I moved on to the one assigned to Mrs Hudson. Tricky, very tricky. I can see why Moriarty hired him. He put up a struggle when I found him, which took nearly a week. I was sent on a wild goose chase all around Scotland. Managed to lead him into an abandoned factory, where Lestrade was waiting for him. Didn’t need to get my hands dirty at all, although I hear Lestrade may have ended up a bit worse for wear.”
Lestrade coughed, interrupting the men and giving both a look, which was clearly meant to say “I give up on you, both of you,” before settling himself in his chair. He gestured to the two chairs opposite. Sherlock and John took their places, and tried to smother their laughter.
His priorities were conflicted between the tow people in the other room. He loved both of them very dearly, in different ways. They’d both unknowingly saved his life. It was unfortunate that in one case, he couldn’t return the favour.
The doctors, with their stupid, unnecessary questions and their flashing lights and tests. People always assumed that Sherlock had diagnosed himself as a high-functioning sociopath. This assumption was entirely incorrect. At the age of 7, Sherlock was branded with the title, and grew up with it as if it were plastered across his forehead. Mycroft seemed to be the only one actually interested in Sherlock’s welfare, but after years of nothing, Sherlock rejected his brother’s concern, felling it was confining. Much like a straight-jacket, or the back of a taxi.
Sherlock donned his signature coat and scarf and started to leave. A thought occurred to him just as began to descend the stairs, and heawiftly turned bak to grab his wallet. he needed to make a quick purchase.
Returning to the present, John noticed that Sherlock was now sat in his chair, head dropped in his hands, still shaking. John moved to sit opposite him in his own cushioned armchair. If John was capable of processing any train of thought, he would probably have been amused at the role-reversal that had occurred between himself and Sherlock, as the detective was overwhelmed with emotion and John seemed incapable of processing any emotions.
It was in this exact position that Sherlock came to the decision, and it would be from this position that he acted upon it.
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I'm sorry for not recognising that you were unhappy. I'm sorry for being, probably the worst flatmate imaginable. I'm sorry I never asked. I'm sorry I drugged your coffee at Baskerville. I'm sorry for the experiments in the kitchen. I'm sorry for the body parts in the fridge. I'm sorry for always waking you at 3am with my violin. I'm sorry I ruined so many of your dates. I'm sorry I couldn't save you."
They stayed there for a moment, locked in the shared gaze, before John broke the eye-contact, choosing instead to look at both sets of their hands, still clasped together between them.
Sherlock thought whilst he played his violin, as he often did. He remembered his school days, the teasing, the laughter. John was the best and only friend Sherlock had ever had, and this made Sherlock realise why he felt like this around him. John was everything Sherlock had. Of course he had material possessions, clothes, money, a flat. But Sherlock didn’t have any emotional – Sherlock felt himself shudder slightly at this realisation –attachment to these things. The only thing he cared about was John. His amazing, brilliant John, who could reduce the high-functioning sociopath to a complete mess of tears and sobbing. Sherlock hated and loved the swooping sensation that flew through him when he saw John smiling, or laughing, or just being happy. Sentiment – a chemical defect found in the losing side, and Sherlock Holmes was losing.
The door to his cell slammed open, and two burly looking men shuffled in. John stood as they entered, trying to make himself appear larger and more intimidating. They never went too close to John, afraid of his famous temper. John laughed. How was he supposed to do anything whilst in chains? He wasn't bloody superman for crying out loud.
“But I did, once. And I wish I could remember, because then I could help more, but I just don’t know what to do.”
John looked up from his own globe, shrugging, “No”. He blamed the flash of wild dark curls he might’ve seen on the lack of sleep. Or maybe the dreams that he’d had. All full of Sherlock.
“I’ve got a brilliant idea,” Sherlock suddenly said, his voice a low rumble that perfectly contrasted and warmed the icy surroundings.
The students were already waiting for him, chattering amongst themselves curiously as to the lateness of their professor. Nothing like this had ever happened before. The second the black-haired professor walked in Molly had gasped, turning to Mike instantly.
Sherlock nodded in silent approval of the chosen pose and pressed the timer for the half hour on his phone on.
Sherlock was quite used to having nights like these where he would not sleep at all trying to finish up a painting, or because he had far too many ideas and he simply had to sketch them all before he inevitably overthought them all and ended up doing absolutely nothing but stare intently at one of his many sketchbooks.
Sherlock couldn’t help the tiny giddy giggle that escaped his lips. After their afternoon together on Tuesday and their equally wonderful morning on Wednesday, they hadn’t seen each other. With each other’s full classes and differing schedules they hadn’t been able to make the time.
They had walked for hours around the Hogwarts gardens and a couple more within its maze-like halls and only managed to get lost twice. Quite an accomplishment.  They’d talked about Sherlock’s mother and what had happened to them during the years he and John hadn’t been in touch. Sherlock left things out, naturally. Things he still wasn’t ready to talk about without going into
“Oh. Um. Yes. I decided the class was ready to handle a morning without me breathing on their necks. I’ll check their progress after lunch.”
“Oh. Uh. Thank you. And yes I suppose he could be deemed not physically unappealing” Sherlock answered as neutrally as he could, not meeting her eye.
Sherlock was buzzing with energy, dragging John by the sleeve from store to store to buy the materials on their lists and to explore the ones that had opened in the year they hadn’t been around.
“There goes the Quaffle and... Watson scores again!” Sherlock heard the voiceover say. It was Henry Knight, a  7
One of the boys, clearly the leader, shoved Sherlock against the wall as the other two laughed merrily. “Don’t you dare say anything like that again you freak! You don’t even know what you’re talking about!”
“No Sherlock we need to go!” he reached over to the Beauxbatons and tried to pry the clippers away from him, but one of the cut devil snare limbs tied around his and Sherlock’s wrists.
Sherlock shook his head sadly. “She won't listen to us. Never has. We’ve had a lot of financial troubles since he left. He made sure all his contacts never hired her and spread rumours about her having bad work ethic. It's disgusting. He feels like he owns her. Like he owns us. And my mother. She waits on his hand and foot. He has absolutely destroyed her sense of self-worth and- and. After everything, he’s done. To her. To me. He kept things from me, John. He kept- he… I can’t. I can’t talk about it right now. He… You.” Sherlock swallowed heavily, his eyes blinking rapidly as to avoid any wetness from leaking out. John did the only thing he could think of and pulled Sherlock in by the waist into a hug.
was the cause of it. John smirked, licking a flat strip across the very same nipple and feeling Sherlock shudder beneath him, eyes closed. He caressed up and down the artist’s ribs with one hand and pinched the other nipple between his thumb and forefinger. He felt every crevice and curve of his sides and slowed, giving him a chance to answer, soothing him.
John rolled his eyes “It's not like that… he and I used to know each other when we were younger. Sherlock? I think I told you guys about him”.
“You studied here? That’s amazing! No wonder you're such a great artist. I bet you were an honour student”
Flashes of memories burst behind his eyes. Memories of that boy smiling down at him, laughing with him. Memories of that boy he hadn’t seen or spoken to in almost exactly 5 years. His best friend. Even after all this time. The only one Sherlock Holmes Had ever had.
There were more pages beneath, detailing the uniform and a long list of materials and books but John just stared at that front page. At his name. The acceptance. The signature. That name… Minerva McGonagall... wasn’t that the woman that had come to speak to his sister all those years ago? It had to be.. that last sentence. She remembered him! He grinned. His cheeks hurt with how wide he grinned. He just couldn’t stop. And when he raised his eyes and met Sherlock, he found an equally astounded… amazed… and completely bewitched expression on his face.
He’d, of course, seen John naked before. But seeing his from a distance lit up by artificial white lights and a room full of students was entirely different to seeing him like this, only lit by the dim moonlight, panting, pressed close against him, hard cock dragging wetly against his own in enticing bursts of sizzling pleasure.
Sherlock, in turn, had appraised John’s figure for a second before asking “So... Auror, Quidditch player or Healer?” and had proceeded to make John dizzy with an array of perfectly calculated observations and deductions.
At the end of the class just as the students were leaving and John was at the back of the room changing back into his clothes, today a striped blue and white jumper and navy blue jeans, Sherlock’s phone pinged with a text.
“Not potions. Just regular old medicine. What’s your potion for, anyway?” John tried to come closer but the fumes coming out of the small black pot were rather unpleasant and he instantly recoiled. “Eurgh! Sherlock! Seriously, what the hell is that?”
Sherlock thought. That wasn’t exactly what he’d been afraid John would notice, he wasn’t even sure what he’d been afraid to show anyway, but he definitely did not want to get into
John groaned and threw his head back against the cushions. “I know... how, though? How do I talk to him?”
The following couple of hours had been possibly the strangest of any of their lives. There was a lot of talking on the McGonagall’s side, and a lot of confusion on the other. In the end, what was understood was that everything John had ever thought to be impossible was indeed… happening to his big sister.
“The phone call... in class earlier today. What was that about?” He recalled John becoming upset and thinking it was about Sarah, but now after having obviously dismissed the thought due to the overwhelming amount of contradictory information he had no idea what could have possibly made John react like that. He probably could have deduced it any other time but right now in the sleepy after moments his mind was still mostly at rest, as if he had painted John for hours and hours on end.
He met John’s eyes. John looked oddly… hesitant? He could definitely see some excitement in there, some spark ignited from the expectation of danger. Maybe some sadness too? Nostalgia over something missed, something lost. His hand was clenching slightly as if awaiting some sort of adrenaline rush eagerly. OH!
He detached momentarily from Sherlock’s addictive mouth and kissed his sharp jaw and slowly down his neck, leaving a slight wet trail. Sherlock was moaning softly under his breath, craning his neck and letting his head fall back to give John better access. John wasn’t sure Sherlock was even aware that he was making any sound, but with every soft whimper, a warm jolt went down to John’s groin. His hands tentatively slid down to Sherlock’s sharp hips, hesitant.
Sherlock just breathed a small ‘Oh’ sound and held tightly to John's hand as he led them through the cobbled street and there in the distance Sherlock saw it: ‘Madam Puddifoot’s tea shop’. It was a charming little place, decorated to the brink with flowers and plants that must have had some sort of anti-freeze charm, as they seemed like they belonged in the midst of a spring day rather than a chilly winter morning. The snow flakes slid right off the petals and onto the pebbled ground. Sherlock thought it looked absolutely charming.
“MISS ADLER!” Professor Mcgonagall exclaimed, scandalized. John pulled back, and they separated with a soft wet pop, giggling. John looked into Sherlock’s grey eyes full of wonder, surprise and affection and instantly knew this moment was the start of the best thing that had ever happened to him. So he beamed at the scowling Slytherins' surrounding them, grabbed Sherlock’s warm pink face and kissed him again.
John smoothed his thumb on the swollen red velvet head of the other man’s cock, spreading the leaking wetness down onto his shaft and
A few weeks later, well into the summer, they were playing in the gardens. One moment they were playing Quidditch… well “playing”, and the next, everything changed.
Before either of them was sure what was happening they were kissing. Well, Sherlock was mostly standing perfectly still, still too shocked to react as John's lips slid between his over and over again, pressing and pulling. He felt his eyes slip closed as John tangled his fingers onto his curls, drawing a low almost imperceptible moan from Sherlock’s throat. He felt John’s tongue tracing the seam of his lips and was just about to open them and grant him access when-
