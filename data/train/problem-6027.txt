Steve stepped close to kiss Tony’s cheek and then Juliana’s curls. Her crying had tapered off, but she was still sniffling and getting snot and drool on Tony’s neck and collar. He didn’t mind. He’d rather go to a meeting with baby puke all over him than not comfort his own child when she was crying and in pain and confused about it.
Wade shrugged. “I figured your dads got you out of there immediately. And I saw the news, but I didn’t expect those.” He motioned to the wounds.
Bucky snickered. “Stevie and I went to one when we were kids. Didn’t know who was getting married, but we snuck in because they were giving away free ice cream to the guests’ kids.”
But the room was neat and orderly – most likely by Pepper’s hands and JARVIS’s guidance – and the three bots in question were by their charging station. They weren’t charging though and even Tony could see the subtle vibrations of sheer excitement going through them.
Phil glared at the back of Tony’s head and Steve gave him an apologetic look, all the while trying not to put his hands over his ears. Tony was no doubt going to take a picture just to embarrass him.
“Save it.” Phil walked over and handed Juliana to Tony. “I’ve seen worse and Juliana’s not old enough to focus past the edge of her nose. Your virtues – or lack thereof – are safe.”
“Let’s go check Uncle Thor’s soufflé, shall we, Yulia?” she asked. “And I know you’d rather be with me than Uncle Rhodey, anyway.”
Steve whirled around to look at Juliana who was peeking out from Clint’s arms. She was pointing at the armor.
Everybody knew Miss Hauer. She was the elderly Head of Accounting and knew every single agent, recruit and trainee in SHIELD. She and Tony got along like a house on fire and she was one of the few people Steve personally told in confidence when he and Tony finally decided to start dating. She called herself a diehard fan of theirs, said they were well-suited together.
Tony flapped his hands in the air, demanding attention, as always. “Speaking of five months, concentrate, Steven. Stop going off topic.”
“You deserve it,” Pepper said. “And we've been hearing good things about you from SI Scholars and SEG.”
Because Tony had that really telling hitch in his voice when he said the word surprises, with an –s.
Steve poked him on the side, making Tony yelp against his mouth. He knew all of this was just a sign that Tony was worried about Julia, but probably didn’t want to sound like he didn’t trust Pepper.
“–Especially as she has yet to understand them. But once she is of age, then she can use them most aptly.” Thor nodded sagely. “I don’t partake in it myself, but Lady Sif and Brunnhilde say it is quite invigorating, shouting it to the heavens as they pummel their foes.”
Clint had put the pretzels away and moved to sit inside the playpen with Julia, playing with the blocks Thor and Queen Frigga had gifted her. They were made of some type of springy material, bouncing like a ball and changing colors whenever they were thrown around.
While Tony let Juliana listen to Pepper’s voice, Steve got her dressed and talked to Dr. Pius. Tony let him take care of that, listening to Pepper’s soothing voice talking to their baby. Juliana seemed to like it, getting a little smile as she listened to whatever Pepper was saying, probably something about shoes, or strategies to take over the world, or about how Tony was a bigger crybaby.
Tony powered through his own tears, his grin so wide as he focused his phone on the mother-daughter pair on the bed.
“Of course I did,” Tony huffed. He tossed a handful over Phil’s head. “Confetti goes well with surprises.”
It was so different from the gorgeous, flamboyant, overconfident man Steve had first met, or the more gorgeous, more flamboyant, more overconfident, gentle, kind, self-sacrificing, lovely man Steve had fallen in love with.
Finally, the man sighed and let himself plop down on the workshop floor on his butt, leaning back on his hands. He kept his gaze on his lap.
The Tower had been decorated from basement to penthouse in all manners of yuletide décor, and employees could be seen in costumes, ugly sweaters, and Santa hats. There was even a Tower-wide Secret Santa for the employees, while hot chocolate, hot apple cider, and candy canes were made available in all the breakrooms and lobbies.
Julia was dressed in a long-sleeved bodysuit designed to look like a penguin costume, complete with flipper feet and a black hoodie with pompom hair. She looked far too cute for words. Her playpen was a few feet away in front of the couch and she couldn’t have gotten out on her own if it wasn’t for the curly-haired man hiding behind the couch, peering from a distance.
Tony shrugged, the move too calculated and too stiff. “Sure, I guess. Nothing interesting about them though.” He waved a hand. “Jay, bring up the folder on Stark family photos, you know the ones.”
Steve looked at his husband in confusion, which was par for the course since his husband was Anthony Edward Stark, who swung between crazy and genius at the drop of a penny…or a hundred dollar bill as it were, because Tony Stark did not carry change in those hideously expensive slacks, nuh-uh, no way.
“Fine then.” Tony sighed. “You can go with SHIELD’s supposed banning, which is not legal or binding anyway–”
He and Da had always meant to try this out and well, here’s the chance. He only had one so he was going to have to do this left-handed, but thank god for ambidexterity.
He pretended not to notice the bashfulness that crossed Tony’s face or the way DUM-E patted his creator’s head and how Tony subsequently karate-chopped him. Instead, Steve held up the photo against the hologram of Tony’s seventeen year old family photo. It made his chest ache thinking that compared to his family photo, young Tony looked happier beside DUM-E with the little half-smirk on his face and the bright, mischievous look in his eyes.
Steve chuckled as he watched Julia tumble backwards against Clint’s leg, catching her toes in her mouth and gumming them. Clint chuckled and tugged them away.
“Just like your baby blues, pecan pie.” Tony turned to Steve, kissing his cheek. Steve looked quietly pleased at that.
Steve knew he and Tony lucked out big time when it came to birth mothers. Gail Antera was beautiful, brilliant, incredibly kind, and doubly patient, which was no mean feat considering how overprotective he and Tony became the moment Gail agreed to allow them to adopt her unborn child. Steve was usually the calmer of the two of them, but even he had almost agreed with Tony when he just about wanted to stash Gail away at the Avengers Tower so she and the baby were safe.
Pepper scoffed, though her eyes looked a little shiny. “I’m not going to cry. What I mean is…” she cleared her throat. “You both have a daughter now and honestly, I never thought that would happen, at least… legitimately or planned or without lawsuits and screaming and scandals happening. But you have a daughter now and I’m confident enough to say I’m family–”
After his Ma had passed, Steve always looked back fondly, if a bit bittersweet, at the memories. The winter holidays most especially had a thing for making him feel melancholic.
“But why?” Darcy whined. “Jane and I were already planning a super-duper cool theme so you’ll pick us for this month.”
It was Bruce who had first noticed the magazine, snatching it up and bringing it to the dining area where everyone was gathered for breakfast. Natasha had teased him about it, but had looked a few times over his shoulder at the pages.
Tony was quiet, busy munching on sandwiches to avoid talking. Steve usually appreciated that method of deflection. Anything that made Tony eat was a plus in his book, but he wasn’t getting away this time.
“What Clint said was actually quite accurate,” Bruce commented. “Newborns have yet to build on their perspective of the world, so even the littlest thing has to be quite overwhelming and confusing for them, and the only means they have by which to express themselves is to cry. There’s no science to figuring out their crying. It could literally be about anything.”
“Same diff, now shush,” Da said, waving a hand. “What I’m saying is, this is not about you. Your Pops was the one who wanted to go to on a trip, and he’d always wanted to go to Greece. So blame him.”
Satisfied that his daughter was secure, he glanced over at his husband. “Gigglenoodle?” he chuckled.
“Your paternity leave is coming to a close soon,” Phil said. “You’ll be going to SHIELD HQ regularly, which is a good thing let me tell you.” He grinned. “Some of the agents have been asking after you, Tony, and Juliana, while the new recruits that came in over the past months were disappointed to hear that Captain America and Iron Man weren’t dropping by headquarters due to paternity leave.”
That seemed to wake Bucky right up. He looked at the frame in his hand. In his arms, Juliana let out a giggle, cheek pressed to Bucky’s chest. He was probably still warm from sleep. Bucky’s eyes widened slowly as he looked at the picture.
“Oh, well if that’s the case, I don’t mind giving Julia some time with her Auntie Pepper,” Steve said.
It was two days before Juliana’s first month in this good old earth when Steve thought about a good theme for Juliana’s baby photos.
Peter’s eyes darted around and, with quick calculations and a prayer on his lips, he fired a web and dug his heels in. The web caught an already crumbling wall ahead of the attacker, and Peter tugged as hard as he could, sending it toppling over the man’s head. He jogged forward, trying to find the man and see if he was incapacitated, maybe take the weaponized gauntlet off. He was only a handful of feet away when multiple electric rounds suddenly erupted from the rubble, sending rocks and electricity everywhere.
“Well, that’s the end of that game,” Clint announced, fluttering his eyelashes at them all before he dragged Bucky away. “I feel so close with you all. Yay team!”
None of them liked hearing Juliana cry. The first night Juliana had her crazy time, none of the Avengers slept. Even Bruce said the Other Guy hated it.
“It’s not my fault I haven’t seen Thor,” she scoffed, her long straight hair spread out like a waterfall on her pillows. “It’s like Fate or maybe Mother Nature is telling us that we’re not meant to meet.”
Tony was a mix of nerves as he keyed in the code to his workshop. He and Steve had been in and out of the tower for the past few days now and hadn’t seen the bots in all that time, so he was both nervous and excited to check on how his robot babies were doing…
Bucky shrugged. “I stole one back when I was on the run, yeah, but Stevie was the one who kept calling
Steve grinned, and smiled wider at Wade's firm grip and honest smile. “Thank you, and yes, it's just Steve for today. Good luck on your match.”
Like a sixth sense, Steve turned towards the doors just as Tony and Pepper stepped in. Pepper was in a sleek, peach-colored pantsuit and Tony was in a dark blue shirt, a suit jacket, white pants and white sneakers with plaint splatters, also painted by Steve to match Peter’s pair.
They were embarrassing, but Peter liked that they were having fun. It was bad enough always being celebrities Tony and Steve Stark-Rogers, but also being superheroes Iron Man and Captain America were titles that always followed them around. It was nice that they could just be husband and husband, no matter how sickeningly sweet they acted.
Pops walked up, running a hand through Peter’s curls. Peter didn’t have the heart to shake his Pops off. He’d get that sad puppy look and then Da would get snippy.
“And where is Darcy, giver of knowledge?” Natasha asked. She had bullied Tony into giving her a foot massage.
She suddenly seemed a bit wistful. Steve was far too familiar with that expression to know there was most likely a story there, but he knew better than to ask. Clint didn’t seem surprised or worried when he glanced over at her. He was leaning back against the foot of couch, Julia on his lap, and was letting her slam her tiny fists on the remote. The TV would have been a mess of sounds and channels if JARVIS wasn’t obviously directing it to cartoons and Christmas carols.
Steve smiled. “She has a favorite napping spot now, and that’s on Dada or Poppa’s chest. Two minutes in and she was out like a light. Come in.” He grabbed a clean rag and tried wiping as much charcoal from his fingers.
Gail’s laugh was gentle and bright. Steve thought it was only romanticised in books, but Gail’s laugh always reminded him of the pretty sound of tinkling bells.
Steve looked down, both surprised and not when he saw a tiny figure by his feet. Julia had recently started crawling and she was learning fast. All the Avengers knew to be cautious in case they suddenly found a baby underfoot.
Thor, ever curious about Midgardian’s odd customs, had joined in, asking Nat to read a few interesting passages to him. Clint was being a mess and adding commentary. Bucky scoffed, but wasn’t fooling anyone with how attentive he was.
“A monthly baby photo book,” Tony said, grinning. “Kids grow like a weed and while we’ve both got eidetic memory and an AI that could record every single moment of our child’s life in this tower and beyond–”
“I don’t know who you’re talking to because that’s certainly not my surname,” Pops said, grabbing two donuts, “anymore, at least.”
Two days later, it was time for a family dinner-slash-movie night. Steve and Tony had been prepared to pass on movie nights for a long while because Julia was scared of loud noises and any sudden reactions or loud exclamations from the team. But in a show of solidarity, the others would occasionally pick a cartoon, a Disney film, or something mild so that the family of three could join them for a while and then switch to other films after Julia was bundled off to bed.
“I beg to differ,” Clint scoffed. “Juju-bean is the cutest, which is probably something she got from Gail because there’s nothing at all cute about old man Stark and older man Rogers.”
“I know you won’t steal my baby, Gail Antera,” he said, slowly sliding out of bed and placing a pillow in his place. “So just make sure no one else does.”
“And your jokes don’t seem to be getting any better, Mr. Stark,” Dr. Pius clapped back. “How’s the baby?”
“None taken, Agent Barton,” JARVIS replied. “I was as surprised as you all.” As if on cue, Juliana turned her head to the side, hearing his voice.
“I am not a child, Steven.” Tony snorted, and then promptly dropped a piece of syrup-soaked pancake on his shirt. “Oh, fu– fiddlesticks.”
“Uh-oh.” Steve mumbled. He turned to see Phil rubbing his temples, obviously already anticipating a headache.
Tony sighed. “Steve, baby, I really think it’s better as a surprise, and if we send it out, the tension of waiting is going to be even more unbearable.” When Steve couldn’t help but pout, Tony leaned over to kiss his cheek. “But fine, fine, we can just sort of tell them, dumpling. I’ll handle it.”
Steve: “Oh, that would be wonderful, JARVIS. That’s a good idea to use to the Iron Man armor. While you ready that, I’ll go get Julia.”
Clint made a face and murmured something under his breath. Darcy let out a snort, and tucked Julia into her arms. “Man in Black and the One-Armed Wonder told birdbrain to stop calling, and he’s too chicken to bother Lady Russia in the first place.”
Steve propped the toy chest against his hip as he walked down the hall to the nursery. More and more of Julia’s toys were migrating to the living room, rec room, Tony’s workshop, Steve and Tony’s room, Bucky’s room, and Clint and Coulson’s room. Tony was certainly not going to put them back and Bucky and Clint definitely weren’t going to stop stealing some just so they could entice Julia to play, which left Steve to do all the work.
of their child, so she knew her body better than anyone and no one was going to get her to change her mind.
Bucky scowled at him and handed Julia over to Thor, who bounced her delightedly with his bulging biceps. She shrieked and gave him a drooly smile. Steve handed Thor a bottle for Julia. Thor had been the first to notice that Julia could hold her bottle up on her own now and took great delight feeding her.
There was a fine trembling in Tony’s form and he looked down, fingers of one hand hooking against the collar of Steve’s shirt. He was silent for a long while, but Steve was patient and pressed a kiss to his temple every once in a while.
Unlike Bucky’s disdain for cameras, Rhodey was similar to Pepper and wasn’t averse to being photographed. It was probably part and parcel of being around Tony Stark. He also didn’t mind if it was Tony taking the photo, even if Tony was being obnoxious and demanding about it.
Steve stroked a hand over Juliana’s head. Her wild, untameable curls were getting longer by the day, so much like Tony’s own disheveled locks.
“Oh god, I’m not ready,” Tony moaned. Thank god Julia was in Steve’s arms or else Tony was going to run away with his daughter.
Pops rolled his eyes and downed the rest of his coffee. He licked his lips. “Huh. You know, Greek coffee tastes really good.”
“Yeah, the Avengers are constant customers,” Peter said, sitting down. He noticed his mangled shooter on the table and pushed it to one side.
“Yep,” Tony turned to Steve and Steve just had to kiss him on the cheek in encouragement, “And Steve and I agreed that not only are you getting the first picture in our baby book, you are going to get the first picture
Tony raised two fingers in the air. “And second, I’m not trying to foist our daughter on my CEO. I am telling you the truth. Pepper put it on my calendar, and yours. I checked.”
Gail was far too used to Tony’s babbling mouth and tendency to go off topic and simply nodded. “Oh, as in taking a picture of her every month? That sounds like a good idea.”
“It’ll be fine, Tony,” Steve said, cutting through his thoughts. He smiled gently, leaning forward to kiss Tony’s cheek and press their little bundle of joy between them. “We can trust your bots, and JARVIS will be there to help us out. Right, JARVIS?”
Their tiny bundle of joy had two of the world’s greatest superheroes for fathers, and had Pepper, Rhodey, Happy and the Avengers as her godparents, aunts, uncles and role models. She had the world’s most advanced AI and the three most protective bots as her guardians and brothers.
“I was pretty worried,” Wade admitted. “I couldn’t help coming over. I’m glad to see he’s okay though.”
housekeeping staff. Steve liked doing chores though, so he always tried to carve out some mundane tasks for himself before the staff could get to them, like sweeping the rec room, cleaning the gym, or doing laundry. It wasn’t as if it was a hardship for him, and Clint and Tony both amassed enough messes to keep the staff busy, not to mention the added mess of gigantic proportions when Thor was in town, so Steve knew he was lessening their burden.
“Wade, good to see you, kid.” Da smiled, standing up to shake Wade’s hand. “Sorry if your guide was worried. Peter saw us and came over.”
“Don’t be so melodramatic, Mr. Stark,” Dr. Pius tutted as he got ready. “It’s your daughter who’s getting the vaccines, not you.”
“Of course, Captain,” JARVIS replied promptly. “However, he has already turned off all comms in anticipation of his Classified mission. He might not see your message in time.”
“Good. Good. Thanks, Jay.” Tony pressed the last button and sighed when he heard the soft click of the locks sliding open. That sound was like coming home.
[Video: Tony shouting at DUM-E to stop running around and around in excitement. Tony shouting at U when he bowled over the party hats. Tony shouting at Butterfingers to stop moving the podium around. In the background, the holographs were turning on and off.
“And,” Steve poked Tony on the side again, sending him scrambling away and making Julia giggle, “And it’s Thanksgiving, so we have much to be thankful for, like Julia and family and the fact that we all haven’t killed one another yet, or that nothing has killed us.”
Bucky winced, looking at the tiny, squirming baby in his arms. “Zvonochek is not going to like that.”
Clint smacked a kiss her cap-covered head. “Wow, Juju-bean! You look so cute in your onesie! And look what I have!” He showed her the milk bottle. He helped Bucky offer the milk until Juliana was happy sucking her bottle and waving her feet in the air.
“Love you too, boss,” Happy said, grinning. “We’ll send pictures and updates.” And just like that, the elevator doors closed, leaving Steve bereft of his child. He squared his shoulders and turned to his husband, who was indeed close to face planting on his coffee cup as Natasha took photos.
[Image: Bruce is cradling a large, silver metal pot. Juliana is inside the pot, dressed in a Thanksgiving themed tutu and a crochet turkey cap. Julia is looking up at Bruce with a big smile, one hand clutching Bruce’s glasses. Bruce is laughing so hard, pink-cheeked and teary-eyed.]
“Your offspring grows so much in so short a time,” Thor said, smiling warmly. He fiddled with his phone, looking at the image JARVIS had forwarded to all of them. “I am most excited to show my dear Mother how Juliana’s growth has progressed. I am sure she will have more blessings and gifts to impart. Even Lady Sif and the Warriors Three would greatly enjoy hearing more stories of her.”
“Don’t let it get to your head. I’m pretty sure even then, you knew just how good-looking you were,” Steve said, handing DUM-E back his photo. “Me at seventeen was,” he waved a hand, laughing a little, “short, skinny, couldn’t even walk without tripping or breathe without coughing afterwards, and definitely not the kind of ladies’ man in high school compared to how you were in college.”
“Yeah, everyone pitched in,” Steve said, pressing another kiss to Julia’s cheek before handing her to her mother. “Here you go, sweetheart. Snug and warm with Mama.”
In the end, Bruce had helped with the decision when the scientist, after weeks of listening to their talking and fighting, called Jane and together presented a neat, surprisingly objective, well-researched, and definitely well-referenced paper, wherein the most intelligent people they knew offered their hypotheses on how the super serum would affect their offspring. They even got Reed Richards’ opinion, which Tony didn’t read and insisted almost made the whole paper null and void, but they did get Dr. Helen Cho’s incredibly detailed hypothesis. Tony greatly admired her, so that made up for it.
He pushed the door and, on instinct, stepped forward first, shielding Steve and his baby from the room. The room was far more orderly than he had left it a few days ago. He and Steve had been hanging out at the time, Tony with his soldering iron and Steve with his sketchbook, when they got the call from the birth mother that her water broke. They high-tailed it out of there like their asses were on fire. It was unexpected. Their baby was a few days early. Steve claimed their baby no doubt inherited Tony’s impatience, but for Tony it was all about Steve’s preference on arriving early.
The first set were pictures of Tony and his family from the day he was born – one of newborn Tony in a blanket, a family picture, and then one each of his parents with newborn Tony in their arms. Steve chose not to comment or linger on the happy smiles on the Stark parents’ faces, especially the rare one on Howard. The next sets were more the same, taken on Tony’s birthdays, Howard’s birthdays, Maria’s birthdays, a family picture, and then the same family picture but printed to have the words ‘Merry Christmas from the Stark Family’ written on the front. All of them were stiff, formal… severe.
But Gail had a mind of her own. She wanted to stay at her apartment and continue her work at Stark Industries for as long as possible. She lived alone and she liked that, so no bodyguards, no SHIELD, and no robots. They soon realized that she was her own person and that she was the
“Oh, I would love to have been part of that,” Tony groaned. “First wedding I could remember was for business. I was six. It was boring.”
Steve waited until Tony murmured something under his palm. He leaned away and rubbed Tony’s cheek with a thumb.
“No, no, no, no. Not us. Just you.” Tony tried to grab his phone, which was really pretty unfair for him considering how much stronger Steve was physically. But Steve knew how scrappy and devious his husband could be.
Hovering over a few more tabs, Steve noticed that there was a gap in the pictures and the next that followed were from the age of twenty-one years onwards, the time Tony became Stark Industries CEO. He didn’t have to look closer to see that they were outlandish, scandalous even, some scribbled with ‘Merry Christmas from Tony Stark’ with a gaudy kiss mark at the end. He’d seen those before. They usually came up every slow season or so when journalists were in the mood to dig up Tony’s explosive and controversial bachelor days.
“It’s Stark-Rogers,” Steve said, sliding an arm around Tony’s waist and kissing his cheek. “Hello, my love.”
Wade was smart and funny and nice and he was good at games and he didn’t mind Peter’s techno babble and awkwardness and he got along with Ned and MJ and his parents and…
Wade grinned, blue eyes so, so bright behind his glasses, and his smile softened. “Honestly, Petey. It’s fine. Don’t be embarrassed. Your dads are nice and they’re… well, your parents can afford to go anywhere around the world, but they decided to go where you are. That doesn’t seem so bad.”
“He’s going to open that tube in front of the Air Force! What if they see those?” Steve shouted as the third photo appeared.
“Brucie, my scintillating, science side piece,” Tony fluttered his eyelashes flirtatiously. “Darling, dearest, sweetums, you know I love you, don’t you?”
“Now that I think about it, this is DUM-E’s first photo, and his first photo with you,” Steve said. “It makes sense for him to keep it.”
“Penthouse, please,” Steve said. “I just need to get changed. Then, please tell Tony I’ll be at the gym. He and Rhodey can play with Julia, but remind them she’ll need a nap soon.”
“Will do,” Gail said, chuckling and holding out a hand to Julia’s tiny one. “Shall we have a bedtime story, my little miracle?”
Tony got his groove soon enough and leaned over to the bags to the side. They brought two, Julia’s diaper bag which was apple green with the letters JJSR stamped on it, and a matching blue one with SGSR on the side. Tony had one in red with the letters TONY in gold. As per their agreement – and to prevent accidents from happening again, because Steve really didn’t want a repeat of Pepper complaining that Tony brought diapers and baby formula to a meeting with an important foreign investor – whoever packed their stuff packed it in their own bags.
“I don’t really know. Maybe their face or their smile?” Bruce smiled sheepishly. “I, uh, back when I was on the run, I had to figure out quickly if people recognized me or if they were sincere or going to be welcoming.”
Tony wiped away the crumbs from his beard. “Two months ago I got the bots ready. Last month, Pepper got everything ready. It’s your turn, muffin. Go and figure out what you want with the other nonagenarian.”
“We’ll leave you two to sleep. Come on, Tony,” Steve said, holding out a hand. “Night, Gail. Night, Julia.”
He was wrapped up as always in a long-sleeved sweater, jeans, and a facemask and beanie. He was also toting two boxes and a paper bag.
Maybe Steve’s earlier thought was wrong. Bruce was probably the one who brought that darn magazine, not Clint.
“And you, Juliana, my dear, this is going to hurt, but not for long, and it will help you grow big and strong.” Dr. Pius never talked to children with a baby voice, always so soothing, quiet, and calm. “I find that parents usually fret so much more than their children. It’s frankly such an embarrassment, and I’m not going to hold back my judgement or laughter just because your parents are superheroes.”
“I said Barnes is your family. You…” Tony heaved a sigh as if he was doing something so incredibly terrible or annoying, but it was obviously all for show going by the light flush on his cheeks. “The bots are our family, okay, I get that. But Pepper and Happy are my family from before you and I even met. Barnes is your best friend and your family from back then and I want your family to be a part of it. I mean, yeah we talked about how we’re going to invite all the Avengers, but I think… you know, your family should get first dibs too.”
Through the doorway, Steve could see Bruce’s side profile. He was standing in front of Julia’s photo wall and holding one of Julia’s toys, a Hulk plush toy that was part of an Avengers toy series Tony had SI make exclusively for Julia. Bruce was looking at the wall where Tony had put up the latest photo the minute they all got home from the parade.
Steve thought about how casual Natasha was when she mentioned the photo book last month. He should have known. Natasha was never
Tony disappeared around the hall, whistling as he went. Steve watched him leave, feeling a little colder without his husband, but plenty warm enough in the company of friends.
“I made a lot, good for everybody, super soldiers and gods.” Bucky grinned. “Babies too, if zvonochek wasn’t so teeny yet.”
It was a sunny day in good old New York and Steve took a deep breath of fresh air. He had decided against going on his usual run today to invite Tony and Julia out for the morning. Every day they took Julia out on the balcony on one of the private lower floors for some sun and fresh air, but there was no substitute for Mother Nature.
Bucky looked up when he felt something on his forehead, only to see that Julia had scooted over by his head. “Why do I have a baby leaking all over me?”
“Knew you’d like it.” Tony grinned in satisfaction, ducking back into the square-ish contraption on his workshop floor. “Practically everyone has one these days.”
There was a beep and Steve turned, managing to duck away when he almost got clonked on the face by a claw.
“You’re all far too easy to please,” Tony grumbled, trying to put up a front despite the sweet gesture. And yeah, Steve married the sweetest, most kind-hearted fella.
Tony looked back and saw the amusement and sheer joy on Steve’s face. And was once again reminded of the many, many,
Steve chuckled. He shifted Julia to step on his thigh and look over the crook of his elbow out the window and the view below. She immediately started banging on the glass, making ‘ooh’ sounds. A little hologram appeared on the window showing a cartoon Santa Claus and his reindeers dancing, JARVIS’s work no doubt. It made Julia laugh.
Darcy’s lip wobbled a little and Steve managed to catch her when she tipped over the couch to hug him and kiss his cheek, her glasses clacking against his temple.
Suddenly there was a knock on the door and it flew open without a word. Phil walked in, cradling their drooling newborn, who was looking adorable in an orange onesie and a green cap, like a little pumpkin.
“We have an appointment on Wednesday with a very important person,” Tony declared. “And by we, I mean Julia, and by appointment, I mean babysitting, and by VIP, I mean Pepper.”
Tony scoffed and waved a hand. “And honestly, your record speaks for itself, kid. SI Scholars was happy to offer you a slot. Didn't even have to do anything.” He waved a hand towards Steve. “Wade, this is my husband, Steve. Steve, Wade Wilson. He's going to be playing later.”
Steve waited for his husband to elaborate, when he didn’t he reached out and poked Tony on his ticklish side, making him jump. Juliana seemed to love that as she giggled from her spot between Steve’s legs and clapped her hands. Steve smiled and leaned down to kiss her on her curly head. She could sit up by herself now for a few seconds at a time, and Steve was feeling really proud. She had been ahead of the curve on most milestones and Tony (and maybe Steve, sometimes) had been telling everyone what a genius she was.
“I was a mess,” Steve admitted, “Always getting my butt kicked trying to deal with bullies and needed Bucky to save me.”
“Oh, good. That’s one of my favorite things to do.” Tony grinned dopily. “So, are you here to kidnap my baby again? If you wake her up, she’ll scream at you, or who knows, maybe Reason #34 applies to you too.”
“Yes, Sir.” JARVIS immediately opened a hologram screen near the charging station, which made it easier for Tony to usher the bots back and for Steve to move towards the elevator.
“I’ll move the meeting here instead of having it at SHIELD,” Phil said, already on his phone. “Need a sitter?”
Julia let out a peal of laughter and Steve couldn’t resist running his fingers along her soft head and curly hair. Julia turned his way, waving a drool-covered fist. Steve let Natasha carry her off though, reminded of Natasha’s telling twitch.
Tony pressed his face to Steve’s hair and kissed his ear. Steve leaned back against him, as if knowing his thoughts.
“Thank you for self-censoring yourself at least,” Steve said. He then held out Juliana, who was looking quite perky and was pawing at the edge of the picture frame Steve gave her with her mitten-clad palms.
“Thank you. I know Bucky will love it, Tony, even if he’ll try to hide it.” He rubbed the shell of Tony’s ear. “Thank you. I love you.”
Steve gave in to the urge to pinch Tony’s hip. “The better question is: what have you been telling her?”
“See there? See?” Tony poked him on the cheek. “That’s what I mean, watermelon. I mean, you can lie about some things maybe, like in front of SHIELD or when duping bad guys, but about the important things? Like whose turn is it to change Julia’s diapers, or who broke the microwave, or who ate the last of the ice cream, or when you tell me that no, you don’t want to get a blowjob in between SHIELD meetings–”
“Erm…” Wade looked confused, but waved gamely at MJ’s camera. “Yeah, I’m Deadpool. It’s nice to meet you all.”
“See you later, kiddos.” Tony waved at the bots, pleased when they waved back. They immediately crowded towards the charging station, watching the slideshow and videos JARVIS had brought up.
By the time they were at the lobby waiting for Happy and Juliana was settled against Tony’s chest, Tony noticed the clock on the wall.
Tony raised a finger at Clint. Steve batted at his hand and he changed it to the fourth finger instead. “Do go on, Barton. I’ve been looking for an excuse not to upgrade your gear.”
Tony snorted, and before he could say something self-deprecating, Steve leaned over and kissed him on the mouth. Oh, but Tony tried, he did, the stubborn man murmuring something against Steve’s lips. He relented eventually and kissed back lazily.
And every night it made something warm grow inside Steve whenever he and Tony would curl up in bed, Juliana asleep on a nearby bassinet, with her holographic calendar projected over their heads, reading and looking at the pictures of just about every single wonderful thing their baby had done. There were stuff like: first day at the Avengers Tower, first time meeting the Avengers, first time sleeping in her bassinet, first time Julia touched Dada’s beard, first time Julia slept on Poppa’s chest, Poppa’s first drawing of Julia, Dada’s first selfie with Julia, among many, many others. Steve had actually heard Tony and JARVIS talking about giving primary user status to Juliana and about building a separate secure memory bank for all her files from now until when she grew up.
“You’re a gem, babe.” Tony reached for the baby and swiped his thumb across her chin. “And oh my love, you’re making a mess.”
“Oh hey! That’s Reason #34 for crying: I hate my parents’ faces!” Tony grinned madly. “JARVIS, add that to the list!”
“Julia hasn’t eaten yet, because she was crying hard enough to just spill milk everywhere, but we have bottles ready,” Steve said. He motioned to the diaper bag already waiting on the coffee table. “She takes a nap four or five times a day, six if she’s feeling up to it, and drinks about seven bottles depending on how many times she decides she wants a nap more than her bottle. We have extra bottles, diapers, and clothes in her bag. She doesn’t like bright lights and loud sounds and the sound of frogs, and don’t…”
Juliana immediately started crying and Tony hovered beside Steve’s seat, nervously flapping his hands.
The man had a package tucked under one arm and a gauntlet or brace of some sort wrapped around his other arm.
So everyone was as prepared as they were going to get, and Tony decided not to delay the inevitable.
JARVIS was prompt. “Miss Potts already had the baby bag sent to the baby’s room, and the bassinet is in the penthouse. Everything has been ready, Sir, as it has been for weeks now.”
Steve slapped Tony lightly on the leg, because Tony was being ridiculous (as always) and he had kicked a few boxers and shirts to the ground because of his wiggling.
. Bruce was ridiculously cautious, never once initiating contact, but he – both of them – were family and Juliana was not going to grow up afraid of either of them.
“My finest moment.” Darcy grinned, while Steve just chuckled. “And hey! Now I got confirmation that I’m going to get a photo!”
Steve let him go on for a while before leaning over to place his palm over Tony’s mouth. “You mean Rhodey knows.”
Peter sighed. His parents might have been following him around, but this was the first time Peter saw them and confronted them. So yeah, they were both pretty well-behaved. And they did seem really engrossed in one another and not on Peter – stress on
“Babe, we don’t exactly spend Thanksgiving like normal folks anyway,” Tony said. “And the holidays have nothing to do with this.”
Clint made gagging noises before turning to Bucky. “Okay, how about you, pretty boy? You stole some rando phone and it’s Steve, right?”
“That is… that is so true,” Tony said slowly, the same silly smile blooming across his face. He pressed a palm against Steve’s chest and pushed him back on the bed before sprawling over him. “Because you met me, dated me, married me, then had a baby with me.” Tony lied down on his chest, chin on his sternum. “Hmm. I guess for all your perfection, it was statistically likely you’d hit a snag somewhere.”
“We’ll have to give you a bit of tummy time later, okay?” Tony said, letting their daughter catch his forefinger in one tiny palm and wiping her face with a bib with his other hand. “I know you hate it, but it’s good for your back and neck and sometimes we gotta do what we gotta do, kiddo.”
“They said it could be quite cathartic,” Phil commented lightly. “The fact that it is usually taboo adds to the thrill.”
“Good, good,” Dr. Pius said. “No fever, no infection, and we’re looking at blue eyes here, definitely blue I bet. Her eyes are probably gonna lighten up as she gets older.”
At this point, he was mostly trying to web all manner of flying debris from hitting civilians or glass windows or buildings as the assailant got farther and farther away. Peter had to find a way to stall him and keep him in place until backup arrived.
Steve almost didn’t want them to go back to work. He loved being an Avenger, of course, but he loved being Julia’s Poppa and Tony’s husband and spending time with his little family. Villainy waited for no one though. They’d been lucky so far and only a handful of missions had been handed out the past few weeks, usually divided between the others. No doubt something big was going to happen soon. It always did.
under there, you can strip that off in the workshop. And honestly, I really need to get started on that undersuit I’d been planning to make for you. I keep putting it off whenever Julia does something adorable, which is every single hour. We can retake your measurements now–”
“Yeah, Gail’s paediatrician,” Steve said. “If we even thought about going to someone else, Gail’s going to be mad.”
Steve sighed. Every time new recruits were brought in, it was always the same thing. He found their admiration flattering, but the sheer gall and forwardness of a few made him uncomfortable and annoyed him, especially since Steve had never made it a secret that he was a happily taken man.
Two days later, Steve and Juliana knocked on Bucky’s bedroom door. Bucky opened the door, messy-haired, shirtless, barefooted, and grumpy.
“I guess you found that already.” Steve grinned, ruffling Peter’s hair affectionately. “Yeah, Da told me. He wanted it to be a surprise. We’re so proud of you. He said you, Ned, and MJ can even try it out before the Opening Ceremony before everybody else.”
Tony flounced in, late to the party, as always. He smacked a kiss on Juliana’s curly head and took a moment to compliment her demolishing her toy with her new itty bitty baby teeth, before moving over to smack Steve on the ass.
“I know you are, dear,” Steve said soothingly, “But if we don’t nip these things in the bud, you’re going to run a mile with them.” He waved a hand. “Go on.”
“It did take a long time to calm her. I guess the shots really surprised her,” Steve said, checking his phone for messages. “Aww. Damn.”
The face plate slid up to show Rhodey’s intensely unamused face. “Why the hell would I even bother thinking about what to wear when you left me some vague message telling me to rush over here because there some kind of emergency, you fu– da– bas–” Due to the baby in the room, he glared at Tony for lack of a curse.
“I’m not sure,” Steve admitted. Rhodey was a busy man and he had very few days off, days he had to divide between his family, friends, and Tony. (Yeah, Tony was a category onto himself.) He’d been here for over a day now and he hadn’t mentioned leaving anytime soon.
“Ah. Dearest Gail. Fate has yet to see our paths cross.” Thor sighed. He smiled down at Julia as he fed her, so gentle despite his large, firm stature. Through some odd coincidences, Thor and Gail always had conflicting schedules. No matter how hard Steve tried to set something up, things never worked out and they had never met one another in person.
“Air Force is fine with it, Phil-bug. I already cashed in a favor,” Tony piped up, apparently having heard them over the sound of Julia’s screaming.
“I know, isn’t it great?” Da perked up, smiling dorkily over at Pops, who flushed and smiled back just as cheesily.
“It’ll be fine, darling.” Steve kissed his grumpy husband on the forehead. “And Bucky is never going to pose for a photo. So we’re going with candids. Let them play, JARVIS will take a few shots or videos, I’ll see if I can take a good one of them, and then we’ll use that for the photo.”
There was a pause and Steve immediately turned to his husband. “Tony! You told Rhodey there was an emergency?”
(Steve had seen Bucky staring at the photo a few times, always with that tiny, content, disbelieving smile on his face.)
“Tony, you are going to clean all that,” he said. “And don’t say you’re going to leave it to the… roombas…”
[Image 3: Gail and Juliana are curled up in bed with Gail reading a sleepy Julia her bedtime story. Juliana’s mobile is seen hanging over their heads.]
“There you go, my love,” Tony cooed as he settled Julia on a nursing pillow in the space between them. The grass was soft under the blanket and while the weather was pleasantly sunny, they were settled under a tree to give Julia some shade.
“Wade is such a nice boy though, very smart, and thoughtful. He’s an orphan, got into a bad accident when he was a kid hence all the hiding and the scars, and while he never got adopted, his current guardian’s a blind older woman. He actually got into e-sports to try and pay his way through college and to help his guardian, said it’s helped him stay away from drugs and fooling around. Part of why he got into SI’s radar is that he’s pretty involved with charity. He helped fund a school in his area and started up CEGA, their local Charity E-games Association.”
Clint snickered. “Oh my god, Darce, you know what you did? You just blew a raspberry at Captain America.”
Dr. Pius was at the reception area when they arrived. He was as old as ever and Tony thought it was so weird that the old man could soothe babies as well as he did, much less carry them.
Steve smiled. He placed the toy chest to the side. He could put that away later. Bruce probably knew he was there, but Steve thought it was a good idea to give the man some space and privacy.
“I have an idea,” Tony said, so obvious and unconvincing that Steve just sighed and Pepper coughed lightly to hide a giggle. “Why don’t you, Ned, MJ, and Wade go and try out the new VR console before everybody else comes? Perks of being the one to actually design the system is that you get first dibs.”
“I’ll be fine,” Rhodey said. “I’ll be meeting up with an escort team and we’ll be taking a detour.” He waved a hand, the term Classified obvious in his tone.
Da’s eyes lit up. “Does it? We can buy some to bring home.” He turned to Peter. “See? How could I deprive your father of
Steve remembered that moment. Tony was telling Bruce to serve the turkey and he passed Bruce a large pot. Bruce had been a bit out of it, probably a little high on the good company and conversation as they all were, and was surprised to see a beaming Julia inside the pot. He was so surprised he had laughed.
And yes, they were even considering their daughter doing some interplanetary meet-and-greets. This was the kind of life they had now.
Some of the items were too big and too advanced for the still-little, still-young Juliana, but most could be used and Tony couldn’t wait until she was old enough to play with all of Uncle Thor’s gifts.
Peter saw his Da visibly soften and rolled his eyes at them. He glanced at Wade, who was chuckling, face creasing under his glasses and mask.
JARVIS answered promptly. “Of course, Captain. I shall be with you every step of the way.” His usually crisp voice sounded pleased, excited even, and filled with purpose. It helped calm Tony.
“Oh, these?” Da looked too pleased. “No, no, dear. This is fashion. When you have gorgeous legs, you never hide them.” He tutted, waving a rather toned leg around. Pops just laughed.
“Hey, Steve, Clint, Darcy, and hello, my little miracle,” Gail walked over and leaned down to kiss Julia’s chubby cheek and rub her head. “And just look at those curly locks. You certainly didn’t get those from me, or those baby blue eyes.”
Steve nodded Happy over to sit at the island with everyone while he paced and rocked Julia back and forth to calm her. She had been feeling finicky most of the night and all of the morning and nothing they did would soothe her. Tony was nursing a cup of coffee, watching them both and looking sulky and tired. He had taken over most of the night shift wrangling and Steve knew his husband was probably cranky and emotionally fraught right now. Tony absolutely hated it when Juliana cared. So despite his supersoldier ears ringing, Steve stepped up to the plate this morning to give his husband a break.
Peter remained focused on the trip though, because it really was a good opportunity. Greece was so picturesque and inspiring, with good food and so much history, art and beauty.
Pepper shook her head. “No. I’m just dropping this off.” She waved the package. It was rectangular and wrapped in special brown paper with green and black twine.
Tony stuck his tongue out. “I’m really trying not to cry and scream and faint all at the same time here, so cut me some slack.”
“Ooh, she’s here! I’ll get that.” Tony smacked a kiss against the side of Steve’s head. “Be back in a jiff, minions.” He wiggled out of the blanket and ambled off, pausing only to kiss the top of Julia’s head. “Later, chicklet. Gotta get your Momma.”
Steve noticed Jane get an odd expression on her face. Tony seemed to have noticed it too and they shared a curious expression. Yeah, something to talk about later.
Natasha hummed in agreement, tilting her head to look at Julia. “Her blue eyes are starting to show. I know Gail is the mother, but Yulia looks like quite the combination of Tony and Steve.”
“For Petey-pie’s sake, let’s not.” Da smacked a kiss on Peter’s forehead so he knew there were no hard feelings. He turned around.
“And I appreciate it,” Tony said, sliding into his lap. “And you know, I’m suddenly not in the mood to go back to my workshop so…” He trailed off. “Let’s go up so you can appreciate
Before they could even start another round of fighting and decision-making though (cue groaning and growling from the Avengers), they found the perfect baby. Or rather, their baby found them.
“We’ve already got scientists working on inhalable vaccines,” Bruce piped up, gathering his notes and tablet. “But it’s still touch and go on the effectivity.”
Steve looked around the stadium, amazed at the leaps and bounds the future had taken. Back in his day, sports were physical and rough. In his wildest dreams, he’d never thought that sports could evolve to the electronic and the imagined. But with the surge of technology, now even online games have evolved into a full-fledged sport. A very competitive sport at that, as per Peter, and a very lucrative one, as per Tony.
“He found it in my files and had JARVIS print it out. He keeps it in his charging station,” Tony said. He was scoffing, but Steve was intimately familiar with that twitch to his lip.
Thor looked saddened at that reminder. “Aye. I have seen her in photographs and we have exchanged pleasantries through cellular devices. But as it appears, we are not yet fated to meet in person. Perhaps tonight will change that.”
“Thank you, Phil. I appreciate this, and I know Tony will to.” He reached over to place a hand on Phil’s shoulder, taking care not to crease his suit too badly. Phil hated that. “I know Tony grew up with a nanny, but before we decided on starting a family we both agreed that we didn’t want anybody else raising our child. But I guess we haven’t really ironed out the kinks completely.”
Tony waved a hand at Steve, keeping him back, and stepped forward so he could give the terrible trio cursory checks and pat them calmer.
Steve noticed that Ned and Peter were gaping and whispering furiously and slapping each other as MJ trained a camera on Wade.
It wasn’t that Peter didn’t love his parents. He did. God knew it was probably weird having superheroes-slash-celebrities as parents, not to mention having to put up with his Da’s paranoia and his Pops’ overprotectiveness. But they had always been first and foremost Peter’s fathers. They were supportive and understanding and, coupled with Peter’s extensive, nosy and occasionally overbearing extended family, Peter was in want of nothing in his life.
“Ugh, you guys are sickening. Thank god your baby’s cute.” Bucky rolled his eyes, stepping forward and swooping in to take Julia in his arms. “Come on, zvonochek. Time for breakfast. Let’s get you away from your gross Dads.”
“Aww, see, there’s that beautiful face,” Steve said. She was still red, scrunchy-faced, and grumpy, but they loved her. “Dada made it better, didn’t he?”
“Steve is fine, son,” Pops said. “And thanks for the treat. I take it you came to see how Petey’s doing?”
Steve looked up from where he was bundling up a sleepy Julia in her long-sleeved bodysuit, leggings, and pale blue mittens. She just had a warm bath, which was among the top five things she loved – a list that included cows, bananas, Clint’s hearing aids, and the War Machine armor – much to Tony’s dismay.
“Yes, dear?” Steve started folding underwear again. Maybe if he hurried, he could get them in the drawer, and Tony wouldn’t have time to mess them up even more.
“It’s completely uncanny,” Jane said, patting Thor’s head from where it was buried in her lap, his massive arms wrapped around her tiny waist.
Peter bounced up to Steve, brandishing the Program. “They’re going to showcase the new Stark VR console! The same one I helped Da design!”
Tony smiled back and reached out to tuck Steve’s blankets around his shoulders. “How about I make us some hot chocolate and we can–”
Steve had actually walked in on that conversation and instead of laughing it off, he had been mildly upset and accused Tony of giving them ‘the talk’ without him. But since Steve was perfect and ridiculously patient and wonderful, he forgave Tony and held his hand as they
“Da, Pops,” Peter called out. “Sorry I was being a brat about you guys being around in the first place.”
“Here, she is, Pep. She just got her shots and cried her lungs out. Talk to her. Show her how kickass women handle getting poked,” Tony said, grinning at Pepper’s unladylike snort at him.
JARVIS: “You have allowed DUM-E and U to use their own props, Sir. I don’t see why I cannot also decide for my own.”
Tony wasn’t sure what words were coming out of his mouth, but it was probably a variation of what Steve was also murmuring.
And Tony, who was a bit high from a thirty-plus hour work binge – still not done, just taking a break, much to Steve’s chagrin – was the one to notice the words on the magazine cover and have them turn to Page Sixty-Two.
“Darce, don’t call her a spawn, and Tony, I love you, but I’m going to kick your behind for suddenly dumping all my stuff in the hall,” Gail said, huffing tiredly.
“Go away, Agent,” Tony called, flapping a hand. “We’re having a photoshoot here. Your glower is casting a bleak light on everything.” He had his phone upside down and Rhodey had devolved from playing peek-a-boo to making animal sounds. Juliana was attempting to copy him by shrieking nonsensically at each word.
Bruce had fashioned the body of the mobile, made of slim dark green metal with sprockets on the ends to symbolize machinery and had made sure that each hanging item was secure and there would be no potential choking hazards. Everybody else contributed small charms and trinkets to hang from it. Natasha, who turned out to be good at calligraphy, wrote a Russian verse on a piece of framed glass– Каждый кузнец своего счастья. Bucky built in a few little tinkling bells. Clint poked fun at the project, but he ended up working hard on his – taking the parts of a broken hearing aid, painting it yellow, and sticking it into a plastic coin that was painted like a starry sky. Phil knitted a little secret agent out of soft yarn and wool. Rhodey had airplane charms on his, while Pepper and Happy brought a colorful pair of baby screwdriver and baby wrench.
Dr. Pius made a face. “Oh, she definitely didn’t like that. She’s got a powerful cry, even makes me want to kill something, maybe a waffle or a croissant.” He shook his head as he cleaned up.
“But we’re all still cooking Thanksgiving dinner, okay,” Steve stressed, looking around at everyone.
“Tony is my family, certainly much more than my own family.” Pepper said, voice soft and smiling fondly at them. “Then Rhodey came, and Happy, and the Avengers blew up New York. Then the two of you started dating…”
Natasha raised an eyebrow at Tony. “I’ll give you a pass this time, Tony, considering you’re probably far too sleep-deprived to have thought that comment through.”
Plus, he and Tony and the others had been pretty obvious about it. Rhodey crashed into the Tower last month, Pepper had the photo on her office desk, and DUM-E, U and Butterfingers still occasionally showed off their copies of the photos to any visitors to Tony’s workshop.
Happy waved away the chair Phil pointed at. “Thanks, but Pep and I grabbed breakfast on the way. I’m actually just here to pick up Julia.” He winced when Julia let out another cry. “That doesn’t sound good though. What’s up with the little darling?”
So for now, people were as tame as they were going to get. Steve had noticed a lot of cellphones and cameras trained their way and a lot of whispering and pointing, but no one was walking up to them and that was good enough for him. The only one who got close enough were a young couple, two young women who passed them by, one of whom was expecting, who told them they were fans of the Avengers and wished them good luck. They didn’t even try to peek at Julia, just smiled at the baby carrier strapped to Steve’s chest.
Wade being there was also a bonus. He was fun, smart and he was actually very personable. Peter knew Wade struggled a lot with his appearance and how people acted around him, but the other SI scholars were good people and they weren’t put off by his looks.
“Infants lose heat faster than adults, Steve, and the younger they are, the less they can cope with the cold. Small babies can’t shiver yet and they don't have as much body fat to keep warm," he had said, as if Steve actually needed that much convincing.
“The love of my life in my bed while my daughter and her mother are asleep just down the hall.” Steve sighed, feeling himself sink deeper into the bed and tightening his hold around Tony. “How perfect.”
“Can’t blame her. You look like a horror show,” Clint said, poking Tony on the forehead. Far too drowsy, Tony lolled back, but was saved from falling over thanks to Bruce tugging him forward.
Tony clapped his hands together. “To the Thanksgiving Day Parade, of course! It’s on Tuesday, actually.”
“You’re such a pushover,” Tony said, poking his husband lightly on the back. “You’re going to let them get away with everything.”
“We know, son, but good thing we were,” Pops said as Da threw him a flying kiss. “SHIELD’s European Branch is three minutes out. Find shelter.”
Wade’s blue eyes grew so, so wide. “You designed the new Stark VR console?” He stepped forward.  “That’s so cool! I heard the new VR console has a totally different interface than other VR headsets and they even upgraded the command system!”
There were screens everywhere, literally everywhere, even in the bathroom. And just as many speakers, lights, phones, laptops, and all sorts of stuff Steve could only marvel at. E-sports were still a bit confusing for him, but sports and the excitement and electricity that came with it were all very familiar to him. So standing there, at the Stark E-sports Stadium, and with his husband and his son being so involved in this, Steve couldn’t help feeling just as giddy as everybody here.
“See you later, guys,” Steve called back. “Give her a few weeks and then you can all even come up to see her.”
“You’re a jackass, Stark,” Bucky snarled, his gun disappearing somewhere in his person. “I was fucking sleeping.”
“Fine. You’re such a nag, Stevie.” Bucky inhaled his remaining pancake and then downed a glass of water. “We doing tummy time?”
Steve shrugged. “Yeah, but Gail gave us this weekend because she can’t be here for Christmas. How was she supposed to know Thor and Jane would suddenly decide to take a trip?”
“To- gurk!” Steve almost swallowed his tongue. Okay, bad idea, bad idea. He shouldn’t have. “Tony, stop it!”
As expected, Thor ended up engaging in a massive, thunderous sulk at finding out he had missed Gail… for the umpteenth time.
He looked up from his sketchbook. Tony was on the floor, greased up from hands to elbows, neck, and left cheek from working on… something, but it was obvious his mind was multitasking.
Steve was watching a promotional video for the event. They were holding the Opening Ceremony in a few hours and Peter told him there were even a few celebrity performers lined up. Steve didn’t know any of the bands or acts he named, but he was just glad his son was so excited.
“Is this another one of Anthony’s attempts at humor?” Thor asked. “Because if this deflates my soufflé, I will not think it at all amusing.”
So, yeah. Steve could relate to Clint’s predicament. But he still had Tony and Julia, so the past three days they were gone flew by pretty fast. With no Bucky to join in his schemes, no Natasha to reign him in, and no Phil to keep him entertained, Clint was left releasing all his pent up energy, moodiness, and general moroseness on the remaining Tower residents and their guests.
[Image: Rhodey and Juliana are in the nursey. Rhodey is on the rocking chair with Juliana on his lap. They’re reading and listening to Julia’s ‘Amazing Animals’ play-a-sound book. Rhodey is pressing a button and Juliana is wide-eyed with her mouth in an ‘O’ looking surprised. Half of the War Machine armor is visible, standing guard off to the side.]
Julia had been sleeping with them since the first hint of snow in the air and now that Gail was staying over the weekend before Christmas, she was spending the night with her Mama at the guest room just down the hall from Tony’s and Steve’s, all toasty and warm as JARVIS watched after all of them.
“There you go, baby. All done.” Dr. Pius put on the last band-aid and leaned back. “Go on pick her up. She's done.”
Wade raised an eyebrow at him, which reminded Peter that it was in bad form to talk about injuries that way, especially not to a teenager who had eighty percent of his entire body burned.
Steve sighed, as if it was such a burden, but the kiss he placed on Tony’s nose probably didn’t help. He stood up and looked down at his own grease-stained shirt from Tony’s questing fingers.
[Image 3: Rhodey has his back turned to the camera. He is completely naked, save for the metal jetboots of his suit.]
Neither Pepper nor Tony were going to make a speech, which was unusual for any Stark Industries major event, but Tony claimed it was better to let their e-sports team handle it and get the credit. With the way the two were now, so relaxed and laughing and smiling, it was obvious they enjoyed taking a break from being hosts.
Clint grinned and tossed himself on the couch with a big bag of pretzels. Darcy settled on the floor close to Julia’s play mat. The presence of new people caught Julia’s attention and Darcy waved at her, grinning when the baby started pumping her legs up and down in excitement. Steve let her down on the floor gently.
The next two days, Da and Pops were as good as gold. They still called twice a day and texted about a hundred times a day, but Peter never saw them around. They were still in Greece though, as evidenced from the photos they sent the family chat.
They were having a family day out in the park, which was rare since Steve and Tony knew to be careful with reporters and fans hovering and wanting to take pictures of their girl. Nobody’s gotten a clear image
“Peter, let’s go!” Wade tugged harder until he managed to squeeze himself and Peter down a tight alley.
Steve reached out as Juliana started tipping backwards. She giggled, finding it all so hilarious, and started tipping herself sideways whenever Steve let her go. “Should we tell them they’re all going to get a picture?”
Steve reached over, placing a hand on the back of Tony’s neck. Sometimes Tony surprised him, not because he didn’t think his husband was capable of bouts of thoughtfulness and kindness. He knew more than most how incredibly warm, kind, and generous Tony could be. Steve was just constantly surprised at the world in general, that Fate brought him this man and that Steve was the lucky fella who earned his love.
“–everyone knows we’re doing monthly family photos. And we’ve already gone with family, or at least the closest ones. I’ve got Pep, Rhodes and Happy and you have Barnes. So now it’s just a question of who’s up next.” Tony shrugged.
“He’s fine, DUM-E,” Steve said, shifting the bottle. “She’s just too little so we have to be careful not to let the bottle press on her. See?”
Tony looked down, busying himself with Julia. He kissed her chubby cheek and slowly eased her on her tummy on the nursing pillow, straightening her dress. She made a displeased noise. She hated tummy time, but she wasn’t crying yet, which was a good sign.
“You’re an ass. Aww. Hell.” Rhodey glanced at Julia guiltily. “Sorry about that. Anyway, guess I’ll be opening this back at base. It’ll be a good surprise for the guys there, let’em see how beautiful my goddaughter is.”
Julia let out a soft cry and waved a drool-covered fist demandingly. Bruce started rocking her, a bit awkwardly, but it worked. Steve smiled, his baby girl had good timing.
Tony took out the green bottle in his jacket pocket. It was part of a set of the most adorable colorful newborn baby bottles from Rhodey – one among Juliana’s many, many, many presents from her many, many, many godparents, aunts, uncles, and admirers. The bottles were small and carried only a few ounces of milk, perfect for small tummies. Each one came with a cap and a long, stretchy cord because Rhodey knew Tony was probably going to lose them unless they were attached to his person.
Natasha’s lips quirked a tiny bit. “In this case, shots mean medical injections, Thor. Yulia is going to get vaccines injected into her, which prevents her from contracting serious diseases or illnesses as she gets older.”
In contrast, the holidays certainly had a positive effect on Tony. Steve knew how much cause his darling husband had more than most to despise this particular holiday, an occasion he had never really celebrated were it not for the kindness of his late-and-much-loved butler. Not to mention a time when he had lost both parents to that devastating car accident. But you wouldn’t know it with how completely and utterly Tony devoted himself to Christmas.
Even before, when Steve and Tony were all but strangers at each other's throats, Steve already Tony Stark was
Tony leaned back against Steve and kissed Juliana’s curly head. He felt oddly melancholic and pensive. “Sometimes things hurt and that’s okay, my love. It’s okay if it hurts and you want to cry it out. And if you do cry, you can always tell Dada and Poppa about it, okay?”
Juliana let out a small smile and Tony couldn’t help smiling back. He’d been doing that a lot the past few weeks, months even. These days, all the nosy journalists or the fans could capture were pictures of his smiling face. It was glorious.
It wasn’t as if Steve hadn’t seen pictures of a younger Tony before. Those kinds of things tend to come up if you’d been together for years, your husband was a celebrity and a superhero with websites and blogs dedicated to photos of him, and when you had incredibly nosy teammates. But these were something else, more personal images that Tony kept close to his chest.
“I’m a bit burned, but the webs were perfect,” he breathed, waving his web shooter. “But I’m gonna need one more to balance things out.”
“It’s turning out to just be some kind of game at this point,” Clint snorted. “I’m going to get a selfie with Gail and send it to him.”
Peter ran, following after the panic and damage the attacker left behind. He finally saw him up ahead. The man fired off a round and Peter saw a bunch of tables and chairs outside a café fly into the air. Another hit sent a parked motorcycle skidding down the road and Peter webbed the vehicle away before it could hit a man and his daughter who were running for cover. Peter stopped to help the man hide inside a shop with some others, before he ran off again.
Pepper smiled a bit bashfully, a rare sight for her. “So I thought I wanted something hanging up on that photo wall of yours in the nursery. I sent JARVIS copies and took the liberty of having this one framed the same way you framed the ones already in Julia’s room. You’re welcome.” She squared her shoulders, as if she was thinking they’d decline. As if they would.
“How’s the pixel density and the distortion in the new system?” Wade asked Peter as they walked off. “It gets so distracting when everything looks so heavy, really takes away from the experience.”
Steve pulled out a pair of red briefs with gold trim and then hastily put it away, red staining his cheeks. Yeah, that one was particularly memorable.
Steve just rolled his eyes at his best friend and pushed Tony down on a seat. Tony kept an eye on Bucky, but for all he griped at the man, Tony knew he didn’t need to worry. All of the Avengers loved Julia and were always extra careful with her. Even Bucky was a pushover, always carefully cradling the baby in his flesh and blood arm and not his cold metal one.
“I had one, not a monthly book though. We all had our pictures taken, me, Mom, and... Howard.” Tony made a face, prompting Steve to push his sketchbook aside and move over to sit beside him on the floor. “We had a family photo and a solo portrait done every year. Usually these are the ones we send out to the press and stuff, or the ones they put on the generic Stark Christmas cards, or whatever.”
Tony had left the individual suites alone, but the Avengers’ common floor had a large tree in the living room and a few smaller plastic ones in the various rooms. Their big tree had been decorated beautifully and left with lots of spaces left for anybody who wanted to hang up a décor, which had quickly devolved into a game of who could hang up the most interesting junk – so far there were two glass angels, one of Bruce’s spare glasses, a pair of figurine elves with beer bottles, four sprockets with the bots’ and JARVIS’ names painted on them, an Iron Man mask, strings of dried chili peppers, and Mjolnir balanced near the upper branches. A picture of Juliana on a star-shaped frame was balanced on top of the tree, which Steve knew neither he nor Tony had hung up. And hanging from the back wall was an array of stockings, labeled with all the members of their ragtag family, AIs, bots, magic hammers, and green rage monsters included.
“You are so adorable, my chocolate latte,” Tony said, patting Rhodey’s armored arm. “And to answer your question, husband mine, I had to, okay? If I didn’t, Rhodey is going to miss another month, like a heathen.”
“Hey, I don’t blame Julia. Being a baby is hard,” Clint spoke up. “Everything is just so big and awful and terrible for someone so tiny and fragile.”
Clint.’ Phil is munching and popcorn beside Natasha, who is trying to kick Clint from the other seat, while Darcy is pouting and is taking a marker to the last three words. Thor, Jane, and Bruce are on the other couch, watching the TV off view of the camera, with Thor eating a four-pizza-sandwich and Bruce explaining something to Jane about what they were watching.]
Juliana sucked her bottle slowly and lethargically. DUM-E almost reached out, but stopped himself in time and clicked his claws in concern. Tony reached out and patted DUM-E on the arm approvingly. U kept the camera trained their way, moving it this way and that in a way that was probably going to be dizzying once they watched it later.
“Is he supposed to be here?” Clint asked. Juliana let out a cry and Clint rocked her, shushing her gently.
Clint grinned and dropped down beside Bucky. “She said baboon. Close enough,” he teased, leaning back to avoid Bucky’s lazy swipe at him. Bucky seemed too tired to engage in a fight though and settled back down, and Clint placed a hand between his shoulder blades.
Clint made a stink face at them. “Like I said, keep all that ickyness where you won’t nauseate the masses.” He tossed a handful of pretzels into his mouth.
Pepper knew better and didn’t choose a side, simply saying she’d love their baby no matter who was the genetic donor. Happy, always so jovial, simply said the same as his wife. Rhodey hung up the phone the moment Tony asked, while Bucky slammed the door in Steve’s face in much the same way. Clint had said they shoot in a cup without labels and let Fate decide. Thor offered to ask his mother Frigga if it was possible for Midgardian men to conceive, which scared Tony badly, so they immediately dissuaded him from making the trip. The others only offered their opinion because they were sick and tired of all the questions and arguments. Natasha suggested twins, while Phil said they could have two children at any point anyway if they didn’t want two kids right off the bat. Nick simply said that ‘he didn’t fucking care whose damn kid it was going to damn well be.’ Maria just looked at them like they were crazy.
listening in, and it was both hilarious and ridiculously heart-warming listening to Steve explain that the baby was theirs, his and Tony’s and the birth mother’s; no, the birth mother was not going to take the baby away at any point; yes, the baby was going to take up much of their time, but that didn’t mean Tony and Steve loved the bots and JARVIS any less, and they were always welcome to talk to them if they needed anything.
“I might just up their budget next year.” Tony winked. “Come on. How about I take you on a tour before we check on those kids?”
“Hey! Hey! Hey, you hunk of junk. You’re going to hit Steve.” Tony whacked DUM-E’s base. There was an undercurrent of relief in his voice at the tension breaking.
Julia smacked her lips, smiling when Dr. Pius pressed the stethoscope to her chest. She wiggled about and Tony had to hold her hands and kiss her quiet until she was agreeable enough.
Phil got off, waving a hand. “Take some time to think about it. There’s no rush, and I’m sure you won’t find a shortage of babysitters with the Avengers.” The ‘and myself’ was implied.
His Ma had tried, and so did Bucky, and Steve himself had tried to be careful and not to make trouble. He tried finding work to help her, which would have been easy considering how much help people needed during the winter, but not a lot could actually be done by somebody short, weak, and sickly. What tugged Steve’s heartstrings even more was that as far as he could remember his Ma had never missed a Christmas present. No matter how small, tattered, or broken, his Ma would always have a gift for him and would scold him whenever he tried to return the gesture, claiming money was all better saved or spent on himself.
“Let’s do Disney tonight. Something for Julia and something I can sleep through,” Bucky said. Both Natasha and Phil nodded.
“Ooh! Ooh! Let’s have the oldies answer that one,” Clint said, elbowing Bucky and letting out a yelp when Bucky elbowed him back with his metal arm.
Tony made a face and smiled when Juliana waved a fist at him. “Thor’s not gonna like that. He leaves for New Mexico around that time. They’re not going to meet up.” He kissed Juliana’s cheek. “Yeah, I know, baby. Uncle Thor isn’t going to be happy to hear that. Definitely not meant to be.”
“Uhh. Nice ones? What’s wrong with you?” Tony turned to Steve. “Jealous, apple pie? Want me to print one out?” He leered. “One of me? We can pick one from our private–”
Darcy was suddenly standing on the couch, wide-eyed and arms waving madly. “I taught her something! Oh my god! I have imparted knowledge! I take it back!
Pepper walked in, toting a slim package. She sat down on a loveseat across from Tony. “They’re all fine. The engineers are having fun with them and when they inevitably break it, you can storm down there and shout at them for being idiots.”
Tony beamed. “Of course I did, kiddo. I’m super proud of the work you did on that. Plus your grades were all topnotch this sem, of course I was gonna add it in.” He smacked a kiss to Peter’s forehead, who flushed and then tried to kick MJ on the shin for getting that on video.
“Come on, beastie. Let’s drown those murderous urges in some chocolate, okay? And since you’re our resident baker, you can go save Thor’s soufflé when it does inevitably deflate.”
If Tony wasn’t in the presence of incredibly deadly, sharp superheroes and his own husband, he might have gotten away with the subtle twitch to his eyebrow.
Steve flushed and Tony snickered against his chest. Steve was tempted to pinch him, but it would just draw Pepper’s attention.
Peter beamed and he and his friends immediately started gushing about the new toy Tony and Peter built.
Tony tossed himself down onto one of the couches, head landing on Bruce’s lap. Bruce grunted, but didn’t complain.
“Don’t call your baby crazy, Tony, for god’s sake,” Phil sighed. “And how many times do we have to tell you - it's just colic.”
Wade suddenly flushed behind his mask. “O-Oh, well that’s… yeah, I’m pretty proud of that, er, for both. T-Thanks.” His eyes crinkled behind his glasses and his mask creased in a big smile.
Tony shrugged. “I was being kid-friendly.” He stood up, stretching his arms over his head. He was in a thick, faded Stark Industries sweater, jeans and thick socks that were probably Steve’s. He moved over to sit beside Steve, one hand curling around the knee where Juliana was standing, still transfixed by JARVIS’ cartoon.
name in technology. And later, after they almost lost New York and Steve and Tony began to build their friendship, Steve started to see that technology was more than just a means to an end to Tony. They called him a futurist for a reason, and while most people would just equate Tony’s tech to his genius, as the product of his mind and were mere inventions… Look at it this way: It was like Tony’s arc reactor. His tech, his inventions, his ideas, they kept him alive, kept him moving forward, kept him believing that there was more to do and that he could do it… even if he had to do it alone. Even without parsing through the minefield that was Tony’s childhood, Steve could understand that fact most especially whenever he looked at DUM-E, Tony’s pride and joy, his first robot baby, his eldest, his favorite, built when he was only seventeen years old and needed a friend more than most.
They looked it up online and they found that one of the ways to keep their child calm and at ease during injections was to hold them. It was a no-brainer for Steve to step up to bat at that. He had been worried about his strength, but Tony knew Steve was only ever gentle with their daughter, always. And this was better because once Juliana cried, Steve wouldn’t have a free hand to punch the old doctor with.
“How about the R2-D2 one from Rhodey? It has a matching cap, good for when we go outside,” Steve suggested, ruffling around the cabinet and pulling out the items. It had R2-D2’s body on the onesie and its dome head on the cap. He turned back to the phone. “Oh, Tony’s dressing Julia today. Yes, in about an hour. We’re fine, nervous, probably more nervous than Julia.”
“I’m not sure, which is why you should go ahead, call her up, and ask her why.” Tony poked Steve on the sternum.
Steve turned back to Phil. “Anyway, we’ve got the paediatrician in an hour and we’re not sure how long that’ll take and how Julia will feel after. We’ll be home straight after since Tony has a meeting with Pepper and we all have–”
feet. He held on lightly, beeping excitedly. DUM-E and U immediately started beeping in low tones, and rounded on Butterfingers. Apparently they didn’t think of that.
Juliana’s cries slowly tapered in the face of her new audience. She flailed a little, still red-faced and teary. Happy kept on rocking her and talking to her, and Steve was definitely not exaggerating when all the Avengers let out a collective sigh when Juliana finally quieted in Happy’s arms.
“…six-thirty, is that okay?” Steve was saying to his phone as he walked in the door. He pressed a hand to the speaker. “Tony, don’t let Julia spend too long without clothes.”
It got to the point that Tony had fashioned an adjustable rolling pole stand for it so they could wheel it around easily enough whenever Julia was napping in the nursery, the playroom, living room, Steve and Tony’s room, the library, or pretty much anywhere.
[Image 1: It’s a black and white photo with the only splash of color being Pepper’s long, red hair. Pepper and Happy are facing one another. Happy is laughing with his arms around Pepper, who is smiling brightly. Juliana is curled up in her arms between them, giggling and the fingers of one hand are wrapped around a long lock of red hair.]
“Well, we couldn’t resist. She’s a beauty,” Steve said, lifting her up a little so the bots and JARVIS could see more of her.
Gail brought Juliana (their daughter!) higher up her chest and smiled at the camera. As if sensing such a momentous occasion, Juliana opened her eyes.
Steve sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose and reaching for patience. “And just why did you call Rhodey here, Tony? Why did you have to make up some emergency and bother him?”
Something inside Steve tightened with so much love and affection for this man. He cleared his throat. If he made a big deal of this – because it was a really huge, really thoughtful deal – Tony was bound to flee.
“She’s fine, boys. She’s probably just a mix of hungry and sleepy,” Steve said as Juliana wiggled in his arms, the bottle’s nipple slipping from her lips as she let out a cry.
Clint, Darcy, Natasha, Rhodey, and Tony posts the photo online and it trends all the way until the New Year.]
Gail laid Julia down between her and Tony, smiling as Julia yawned. Gail laughed when Julia let out a drooly raspberry before sleepily accepting a bottle of warm milk from her.
“Ok then,” Tony said, voice and hand shaky. Steve had to hold him. “Mommy Gail and baby...” He took a deep breath. Gail had told them the baby’s name just before she was wheeled inside the delivery room, and he and Steve had been murmuring the name between them like a mantra for hours now.
Steve chuckled, moving over to sit beside Clint and Julia. “It’s Christmas and everyone’s here. It wouldn’t be fair to pick just one. So we decided we’ll have our first ever Christmas family photo for her.”
“Come on. I made breakfast, and Julia’s bottle is ready.” He offered his arm like the gentleman he was and led them to the elevator.
Julia blew another raspberry before devolving into a mess of giggles. Steve laughed at Tony’s absolutely besotted face.
“Yes you are, darling,” Steve commented, busy attending to his daughter. Julia looked exhausted, but she smiled when Steve kissed her soft, warm, chubby cheek. She let out a weak raspberry making Steve chuckle.
“Anyway, what I was actually saying, is that the mobile’s quite beautiful,” she said, motioning to the mobile over her head. “The stone is definitely eye-catching. A team effort, you said?”
“Elevator,” Tony said, distractedly. He shuffled over and collapsed on the floor against Steve’s side. “Hey, munchkin, what’d Aunty Darce taught you?”
“Boo.” Julia smiled toothily at him, her little palms pressed against Steve’s cheeks. Steve felt his heart melt.
“My turn to what?” he asked. Steve wiped Juliana’s chin with a bib. Oh, but they had a leaky baby in their hands.
“Don’t worry, Steve,” Phil said, as he, Steve and Natasha handed out the plates. “I made sure Clint cleaned it before handing it over.”
The two exchanged one last hug and they all watched Rhodey get suited up by the bots on the landing pad before he jetted off with a final wave.
It wasn’t as if the Avengers weren’t aware of Juliana’s monthly baby photo book. They had all received Juliana’s daily emails after all – and yes, Tony went and made or bought their daughter her own email and domain, or something of the sort – and none of them would miss the email blasts of ‘Juliana’s Monthlys!!!’ Not to mention the fact that the photos were hanging on the nursery wall.
smiling, and those were the ones from the ages of one, two, and three. After that, his expressions ranged from despondent to defiant to cocky to… lifeless.
A hologram appeared, hovering just in front of them, showing a series of photos dated by year. Steve pressed his shoulder against his husband’s comfortingly, before leaning forward to inspect them, bringing up each one. Tony didn’t seem inclined to say anything about them, so Steve didn’t think to ask.
Peter yelped and ducked, feeling the electricity singe his side. He fired a web, using it to pull himself into safety. Behind an overturned stall, he grabbed a brick and threw it across the way at the direction of the attacker. The brick exploded when it hit an electric shot. Peter noticed a metal table at a café across and webbed it, pulling it and then whipping it around the corner before letting go. There was a thud and a shout and Peter knew he made contact.
Steve sighed, but stood up, hitching Tony up with him with his hands under his man’s… well, voluptuous behind. Tony’s eyes darkened as he hung from Steve’s arms.
Dr. Pius then asked them a few questions about Juliana’s diet and sleeping patterns, and before Tony could mentally prepare himself, it was time for his baby’s shots.
Steve smiled, warmed by the display. He found Tony incredibly gorgeous most days, even when he had bags under his eyes from pulling an all-nighter and had grease on his face and was incredibly cranky, but he was never more attractive to Steve when he was doting on their daughter. Like almost everything, even fatherhood suited Tony to a tee, and Steve felt fortunate that he got to share that with the man he loved.
(The only thing that had lifted Tony’s mood was that Julia had puked on Steve’s shield. Steve didn’t really take offense, but Tony decided that they were going with the idea that Julia was just a baby and obviously didn’t know better yet.)
The pole was also detachable, and Tony had unscrewed the top part from the stand and had brought it over to Gail’s bed, sliding it into the pole fastened behind her headboard.
