Dean thinks ’
. All this time he thought that the best thing that could happen was to know that Cas loved him, but the way Dean feels now, seeing his eyes shining as he hears his words, yeah, nothing can beat that. He decides then, that he’ll tell him everything that Cas always deserved to hear and he’ll make sure he never forgets it. It may not make up for the time he spent doubting, but for sure he’ll try. Cas grabs his hand, “I feel the same way.”
Part of him knows that there’s something that he should be saying, that one of them should be saying at least, but nothing is said. Maybe it’s their bodies that do the talk for them somehow. Cause one moment Dean wishes very hard to be wrapped in Cas’ arms and the next, there he is. Everything else disappears as he sighs and melts completely in his embrace, his face in the crook of Cas’ neck. He smells like blood and car wash-soap. Cas’ arms hold him as he sinks.
The kitchen has plenty of storing space. Sam has organized everything in a way that he thinks is the most practical, so now they have things like a spice cupboard and a candy and chocolate drawer. Dean likes that.
Cas asks again if they have everything, like he’s packing for a kid going to summer camp (Dean tells him), and takes one of the duffel bags from Dean’s hand without asking, and walks past him, like he’s used to carry Dean’s clothes and weapons. “Do you have your snack for the road?,” he asks, climbing the iron stairs and Dean stops in his track, glosses over the snarky suggestion that
“Yeah, well, I wanted to make sure we had enough for a while.” Dean says as they meet in the middle of the room and Castiel hands him a pile of trays of different kinds of meat.
He feels the fabric of the trenchcoat against his skin and Cas’ strong arms and warm hands around him and if he didn’t already know he was in Heaven he would have started to suspect it right then. “Hello, Dean.”
Then he is over Sam again, untying his boots and taking off his socks and addressing him gently but urgently to keep him talking. He feels Steve’s eyes on him the whole time, boring the side of his face. He has taken a step back and he’s watching them from the door with a thoughtful expression. Dean looks up at him and not unkindly he says: “I got it from here”.
One time Eliot ventures to the counter to get a refill for his drink. He makes a poor attempt at covering the fact that he is watching him and Cas pretends not to notice to spare him the embarrassment, but Eliot surprises him, turns around and bravely asks
He walks around him maintaining the distance, almost advancing on the side like a grab.
“Are you sure you don’t want to come?” Cas asked draping his towel on the railing of the porch next to Sam’s.
Cas senses his struggle, “If you want, you can ask me,” he says, coming closer, in his eyes his timeless patience, that gaze that tells him that he is seen, he is known. Cas says: “I will say yes,” and it’s barely more than a whisper but Dean’s brain is a step away from short-circuiting anyway.
“Relax, we’re gonna be right behind them.”
; it’s nothing like with Eileen, he asked her for
“Alright, Poirot,” he bites out, “it’s my uncle’s card. Do you wanna call him in the middle of the night to check?”
They eat on the couch in front of the tv, their plates balanced on their laps, one of Castiel socked feet bumping lightly against Dean’s calf.
Dean is glad to know that. She has opened a door in Sam’s life that he probably thought closed forever and Dean will always be grateful to her for that. Also, she is a badass and totally out of his brother’s dorky league.
Dean woke up a few hours later wondering where he was. Then he registered Cas turned on his side, sleeping next to him, registered the tv off, the night outside the windows, the dim light from the fridge. He got up and went to his own bed.
Hearing him speak his brother’s name, Sam’s gaze travels between the two of them and a look of understanding crosses his face. He takes a step towards him, and goes into his comfort-victim mode.
It’s not a big place. Ten rooms or less, all ground floor. The blue neon sign on top of the short building says
"I can see that... something weird is going on." It made him smile. "Well now get your asses up cause I got burgers here" he said, going for the kitchen table.
“It’s Cas, right?” he asks and Castiel’s wide eyes set on him as he nods. “Those were vetalas. They are creatures that poison humans and feed on them.”
them?” he is in disbelief. “Why?”
“Where’s Krunch Cookie Crunch?” he asks then and Dean stops in his track in the middle of the room to turn on his heels and look at him in disbelief.
Sam dismisses every moment, finds every excuse for them. They’ve always been like that. Can’t two friends do it? Does it have to mean something? It’s just the way they are.
Sam tells him in so many words that if the vetalas don’t show up soon they might as well move on. He says it tentatively and he seems taken aback when Dean agrees right away. “No reason to stay around,” he grumbles as they reach the Impala.
Sam clenched and unclenched his jaw before saying: “Are you free next week?”
Dean shouts “Go! Run!” but he seems to be frozen in place, pressed against the wall.
And then Cas’ posh corporate dick sister Naomi shows up unexpectated one night and tries to convince Castiel to go back to New York with her. Dean hates her the moment she steps in with a face like she’s coming down from Heaven to set her rich foot on the smelly Earth, and she very clearly despises Dean’s everything, judging by the way her eyes slide over the room and stop on him when she tells Cas, “Look what you’ve become”. And Castiel throws her out shortly after that but Dean understands that even if he doesn’t regret it and Gabriel too calls to say, “So what? The witch is dead, good riddance!”, Castiel is still feeling like shit. So he curls up on the couch with him and when Castiel whispers “I’m sorry for that,” Dean holds him tighter and when he hears him sniffle quietly Dean says, “It’s okay. I’m here,” and strokes his back until he falls asleep.
“I’m serious, Dean. Nothing stops us from going on vacation for a couple of days. We’ll bring our emergency phones and that’s it.”
car.”
“You forgot your personal effects.”
“I like music but I don’t really get the attachment to it.”
Sam is yawning in the passenger seat and Castiel, who Dean can see form the rear view mirror, seems lost in thought. They decided to skip the stop to the motel and go back to the bunker right after the hunt and although it’s been a long and mostly quiet journey, Dean doesn’t feel tired. He is still fuelled by the adrenaline that has washed over him when he’s found himself way too close for comfort to a set of werewolf’s teeth. It had taken him all he had to shove the werewolf away enough to swing his machete and cut her head off.
“Still training with Bobby. Can
His grip was probably a little too strong. Dean didn’t know why he seemed unable to release it even a little. Cas didn’t seem to mind anyway.
“Can you bring it in? I’m gonna stay here and wash the blood off the car.”
“Jack’s here?” she lights up. She says she’s heard
“Don’t look this way, think of something else,” he pants.
and Cas says
Cas presses his lips together. “I thought it was best to let you decide where you wanted to go and who you wanted to see.”
Castiel huffs a laugh. “I have seen nothing then,” he promises as he goes back to the last items on the table.
This time Dean doesn’t need to say anything before he moves to resume his task. Silence falls upon them. Dean sneaks looks at Castiel as he works. He looks at his hands, strong and efficient but careful, as gentle as they can be as they hold something that is not lethal, pointy or dangerous in any way.
Cas frowned. He seemed to find difficult letting the words out. He cast down his eyes and Dean didn’t like at all where the conversation was heading. “I want to keep it. But I don’t have anywhere that’s mine. Of course, if my situation doesn’t change I will soon need to find a place for myself and I will take it back.”
And then, Dean suddenly understands.
Then he hears footsteps behind them and suddenly the weight becomes more bearable as Steve is holding Sam up from the other side.
Sometimes before going back to the bunker he visits the pizza place, where Max’s mum, Caitlin, works. He opens up Sam’s latest text message and lists off their order. During the weekend, a table far back in a corner is usually crowded with young familiar faces. He stands at the entrance waiting for his order to be ready, looking down at the checkered floor and twisting the receipt in his hands and he feels their eyes on him.
, but today he also wants to say,
“You made an exception for me,” Dean says, and it’s meant to be playful but it hangs heavy in the air.
Castiel senses grief and sorrow that run deep. He senses that the man is about to weep. He doesn’t know what to say to offer comfort. What he did was not on his own initiative. He had orders and he executed them, so he’s not sure he deserves this man’s gratitude. He says “We made sure he was not harmed.”
“Dude, what’s up with you?” snaps Sam when he can’t take anymore of his fidgeting.
Dean kisses him again and this time doesn’t let go.
Dean didn’t know why Sam had hesitated before saying it. If it was because he didn’t think Dean would want to invite him or if he thought mentioning the fact that Cas was now so low on his mojo that the littlest effort could make him sleep would hurt him.
Sam notices that there’s something different with him, because he keeps calling him back to reality, snapping his fingers and looking at him all weird as they plan what to do with the vetalas.
Dean feels a smile growing on his lips. “Oh, right.” He shakes his head. “It must be in there somewhere. It was the blue box, right?”
“Here you go,” Steve says, his voice low, and their fingers brush on the warm cup as he hands it to Dean. “Sugar?” he asks, now almost in a whisper.
Dean huffs a laugh and slaps his back. “We’re done, Cinderella. Good job though. Did you have fun?”
“What? He said he likes the sounds of nature or something,” said Dean uselessly, and sounding way too defensive for someone who up until that point hadn’t really thought about where Cas was planning on hanging it. He quickly averted his eyes. He felt Sam’s stare on him for a few seconds more, then he seemed to give up on what he was going to add and went back inside.
Dean rolls his window down and in the night air that ruffles his hair he can smell another storm coming. He turns the music up and meets Cas’ eyes. There’s a smile in there somewhere that mirrors his own.
Okay,
Sam smiles a little. “Nothing.”
“You always forget your clean clothes in the laundry room. There should be a red one that you haven’t wore this week yet. I assume it’s still there.”
One quiet afternoon though, she is clumsily trying to figure out how the brand new object scanner works and Cas sees her growing frustrated. She says
As he drives by the small movie theater he makes sure to memorize the movies they are showing that week in case they decide to have a movie night out. One time they are giving an old movie whose title sounds familiar, so he stops the pick-up, fishes out his phone and sends Dean a picture of the posters, to which Dean texts back
He gulped and licked his lips and took advantage of the fact that Cas was not looking at him.
Dean’s mouth hangs open for a few seconds, then he beams up at him, nodding vigorously.
you to do me this solid, man. And it’s gotta be now. Please,” he says, almost out of breath.
"Be right back."
"Right. Yeah." Dean lets himself relax. Cas is fine. Probably.
"Hi," Dean says around a smile, his hands in his pockets. He has a black jacket on with a ton of zippers in odd places.
Castiel turns back to garden, where the carnage lies. Dean's grip is strong, or else Castiel's fever-weak, so he's stuck, Dean gripping him tight.
"Thank you," He says, heart pounding, "I need to redo it."
“Pulmozyme,” One of the nurses in the crowd shouts out. Jo snorts a laugh.
Castiel swallows and takes out the last few items: a blue rosary, a diner receipt, and a few photographs.
Castiel considers it. Sam definitely would not judge him. Dean... he isn't sure.
She puts a hand on her hips. "Ugh, again?"
"You want a beer, Castiel?" Ellen asks, holding one out for him. "House rule is you gotta be eighteen."
“Relevant like going on a date with your male friend?”
“Thank you. But no.”
“Uh. Fuck, dude, I dunno, you picked the wrong time to ask.”
After that, Dean comes over to the side of the bed and looks at Castiel, his gaze wavering as thoughts fire behind his eyes.
“Thanks, Ma. Thank you.”
“Jesus,” Dean snorts, “Fine. Okay. Dad just, like, shut down. And I thought, like... if I could make it easier for him, for Dad I mean, then he would, you know, get better. So he could start being our dad again.”
Castiel tries to say something, but Jo shushes him, “You sleep.” He obliges and shuts his eyes.
Dean's stomach flips, "Aw, man. They already love you." He leans in, tugging Castiel in by the coat and kissing him, "Okay, Rocketman?"
"It's an expression, dude. You got this."
“Mm,” Castiel answers, closing his eyes. He hurts lately, an ever-present ache that all the treatments in the world can't seem get rid of.
“Novak was... Unique, to say the least,” Jo starts, and chuckles ripple through the crowd, “Let's face it, the guy was weird. He liked to order all the desserts from a restaurant and try them one at a time. He seriously rated them for things like moistness and mouthfeel. I dunno what he was on, but damn, I sure would've liked some of it.”
"Give me a moment," He says.
That was Dean's job as a kid, when Sam was too little to help out. He takes the potato, “Sure.”
"Wash your food? And eat five hundred more calories?"
"Ugh," She scoffs and goes over to the table.
The first group out is a trio, two girls and a boy. The girls are on violin and the boy is on bass, and hey play a fast, trilling song that makes Sam think of rabbits running across a countryside, or heroes running from the bad guys before ducking, breathless, into an alleyway. One of the girls has a solo, and Sam stares slack-jawed the whole time. Her bow is a blur, it's incredible.
"Hey, Rocketman?" He asks, nudging Cas' foot again.
There's a book on Dean's bed when he goes upstairs that night.
She eyes him a moment, pursing her lips, "If it was a choice between you and history, Castiel, I'd rather have you."
Dean blanks, “Uh, I'm graduating high school this month. Otherwise I'm a waiter at the Roadhouse and I put in some hours at my – my dad's auto shop. Oh, I help Castiel with the garden, too.”
He takes stock, sitting up a little, “About as good as can be expected.”
Dean stiffens. He wants to turn away. Everything in his body is telling him to turn away. “Sir.”
Cas blushes. “It was, uh, a ballroom dancing class."
Dean flips his phone over and squeezes his eyes shut. Damn it! Castiel is his friend! His good friend! Sure, Dean wants to hang out with him all the time, that's what friends do. And he's done a literal spit-take because of Cas -- more than once! -- but that's because the guy is fucking hilarious when he's not even trying. And... the way Cas listens to him talk with his full attention, like he really thinks Dean is worth listening to, makes Dean share like they've known each other for years. In fact, he's pretty sure Castiel knows more shit about how he and Sam grew up than Jo, and she was there for a lot of it.
“Yeah, man. Me, too.”
“Is he like, okay?”
"Heya Bobby," Dean grins.
"Mm?"
"Me neither."
“No, no it's – it's fine.”
, the cool, suave, thoughtful young man who also happens to be Castiel's best friend. No pressure.
, it reads, in Castiel's all-caps handwriting.
“Bobby? He's good, he's still trying to get tenure.”
Right, it's summer now. He's officially a high school graduate. Graduation itself was a small affair: instead of attending a dumb ceremony, the gang spent the afternoon in the hospital. They brought Castiel a cake, a proper one using an old recipe of Bobby's, and all the nurses on the floor came in and celebrated with them. They took pictures with his diploma, which he propped up on the side table.
The worst part was the wind. Sudden bursts of high-speed winds were pushing them around, causing the helicopter to dip in every direction and then some. Dean’s knuckles were turning white and he kept his eyes shut, telling himself that Cas could handle it. Cas was a good pilot. Cas was the best pilot on the island. Cas would get him home.
Cas nodded and swayed on his feet. “It’s good,” his words were dry, “But it would be better… if the first aid kit wasn’t in there.”
He was thinking about Sammy- not only having to deal with their father but now Dean too. Poor kid must think he’s all alone in the world. He was thinking about Charlie as well, who was probably running frantic back at the resort. She would probably skip her business meeting and instead be on a search and rescue chopper. Or maybe she wouldn’t be. Did she even know? Or did everyone still think Dean was en route to America?
to see before he left. Unfortunately, he would be leaving without seeing half of those places.
At some point, he fell asleep. The vibrations from the engine were mesmerizing in the way a mother lullaby mesmerized a child. He doesn’t know if Cas fell asleep before he did, but Dean was sure Cas fell asleep during the ride. The pair of them weaved in and out of their sleep state, one of them waking up and stirring the other, only to fall back asleep moments later.
Dean couldn’t make out the words coming out of the phone and decided to give up trying. Whatever was said would be passed onto him as soon as Jo hung up. Which felt like it would never happen. Time had slowed down, Dean was sure of it. He couldn’t concentrate on anything that was coming out of Jo’s mouth, let alone actually comprehend it.
“Hmm?”
Dean nodded his head rapidly. “That’s all.” Dean knew that Cas could tell that he was hiding more, but he just prayed that he wouldn’t press for any more details.
Cas reached over and took Dean’s hand, bringing it up to his mouth and lightly kissing the top of his knuckles. Dean could feel his breath wash over the skin of his hand.
“I’m sorry for getting blood all over your Led Zeppelin shirt,” Cas held up the grey shirt Dean had given to him, which now had a large dark in the middle of it. Dean brushed it off, told Cas it didn’t matter because well, it didn’t matter at all. What mattered is that Dean isn’t stuck on an island with a corpse keeping him company instead of a living, breathing person.
Every few moments Dean would glance up at the helicopter sitting just 100 feet away from him. The sun had come out now and was reflecting off the sleek black surface, which appeared to have been recently cleaned. Gabriel had referred to Novak’s helicopter as a “junker”, and while Dean wasn’t a helicopter expert, he thought that it looked pretty clean and classy.
He reached under the pilots seat and pulled out a mess of melted plastic, all curled up and ashy. He could make out the red cross on the front and tried to pop the box open, hoping that he could salvage something from inside. The box may have well been empty because all of the bandages and helpful items had been completely burnt to a crisp. Just as expected. Dean tossed the box to the ground in frustration.
Cas slid to the floor and held his head in his hands. Slowly, the noise faded away and he was finally able to think straight. Dean looked worried, that was for sure. You didn’t have to have a mood sensor to figure that one out.
Taking another glance back at Cas, Dean waved goodbye and began to walk into the jungle. It was hard to navigate and Dean was constantly getting the toe of his shoe caught between roots. He could see that the island sloped upward and even formed a bit of a mountain on the opposite side from where they had set up camp. Dean figured that it was best to head in that direction in search of shelter.
Dean looked over at Castiel, his face just barely illuminated by the dying fire. Dean wanted Cas to look over at him, to just tear his eyes away from the fire for a second. But he didn’t. At least not until much later, long after the fire had died out. They hadn’t moved from their spots in the dark when Cas finally glanced over at Dean. It was so quick Dean almost missed it (he would have been pissed if that had happened), but Cas looked at Dean and their eyes met. Cas smiled softly, just barely the ends of his mouth turning up. It was almost impossible to see in the dark of the night, but the bright stars above assisted with that. Dean smiled back.
Dean furrowed to eyebrows, unsure what Cas meant by “something”.
“I shouldn’t be doing this but it seems that you’re adamant about seeing your friend. He’s just down the hall, room 401.”
Cas raised a limp hand and gave what Dean could only assume to be a half-assed thumbs up. At least he was alive.
Cas nodded in agreement.
He was filled with so much adrenaline that it felt like his tired body was being controlled by a puppeteer who had him on strings. It all felt like a dream to him. It all felt so distant and euphoric; it just couldn’t be real.
Dean was disappointed and it showed: “Uh. Sure, you can give it to us. I mean, if that’s what you want.”
“That’s it? No researches, no checking the news, no nothing?”
“Cas,” he says, “I was thinking I could stay a little longer next time.”
“Then why is the place basically about you?”
“Where is your bag?” Dean had teased, practically hearing Sam rolling his eyes behind his back.
“No,” he says, “well, not usually. Only if they need me.”
A long beat passes and then Cas says, “I’m sorry, I never meant to make you feel like I don’t want to spend time with you.”
Dean flashes his teeth. “Awesome.” then he eyes the clock above the counter too and sees that it’s five past seven already. He hasn’t notice because it’s still dark outside.
Steve sighs and shakes his head. “It’s a long story.”
“Welcome, Dean,” she says, “Are you ready to move on?”
“Make it two nights.”
Soon the bottle is empty and Cas says, “I’ll get you another one,” but Dean refuses.
And he likes how the smell of the softener fills the room, likes the warmth fabrics under his fingertips and how quiet his head gets as he does the same movements over and over again, once, twice, three times. In there, he can’t get it wrong. He never gets it wrong.
"Hey, that's a very offensive assumption."
“I don’t know. You won’t tell me.”
Sam is the first to disappear in the packed living room, with Jack following right behind, but Dean grabs Castiel’s elbow before he can take another step. He circles him to block him from the entrance and says, “Hey, stick with me, alright? Last time I was at one of these things this guy Norman talked about his knife collection for
Eileen shakes her head. “But why haven’t they invited us
Steve raises his eyebrows. “Let me guess. You’re not going to tell me because I wouldn’t understand nor wanna know.”
and you don’t
Cas had already put the coffee on by the time he left the bedroom.
So when they get to the bunker, Dean doesn’t follow Claire’s car to the garage and stops up front, the engine running. Sam looks at him confused, “We’ll be here in an hour,” Dean just says, grateful for the shadows around his face.
Dean frowns at her but she’s already halfway out of the room. “I can be his big sister. I mean, he should have someone he can talk to. Living with you three must be – a lot.”
Dean didn’t look up and kept eating his fries, so Sam turned around again, “Of course, Cas.”
He knows he sounds distressed and as he hardens his tone and raises his voice, possibly a little scary, but he is just out of options. This is it. He doesn’t know what he can possibly do if the guy actually kicks him out of there.
Hearing him say his name makes Dean’s heart strangely flutter for a second. “So, you satisfied?”
when it comes to paperwork and whatnot. They aren’t gonna appreciate you playing the Spanish Inquisition with them, you know what I mean?”
“I wanna help.”
Then the dryer at his right beeps and Dean moves to take out the new load and drop it where the first one just disappeared. Castiel looks at it with a frown like it personally offended him.
Then he goes to the map room where Cas is usually squinting at Dean’s laptop screen. Not too long ago, he used to knock on his door and ask, “May I borrow your laptop?”; now Dean just leaves it around, and Cas doesn’t ask anymore. Dean doesn’t mind.
“Uh, I was just gonna say that me and my brother are probably leaving town tonight, so – just – wanted to let you know in case you take that shift off of Steve.”
At Castiel’s side, Robert Singer huffs and curls his lips in something that resembles a smile; Castiel senses pride and affection, glowing and expanding and growing tall inside of him like baobabs.
He doesn’t take out his key, he rings the bell.
“Hey,” Dean shifts on his chair, now frowning. His tone has changed as well, it’s sharper, “what do you want?”
“How the hell does this work?”
"Just an observation."
He runs into Cas in the hallway one afternoon as he’s going to the laundry room. They almost crash into each other, but they both take a step back just in time. Cas says “Dean” as if he was looking for him, and studies his face for a long moment as if he’s able to check the history of his facial expressions of the last few days, those he wasn’t around to see, as Sam had sent him to meet Claire somewhere to take down a nest of vamps.
Dean closes the distance in a heartbeat and wraps his arms around him and holds tight. “Hey, Cas.”
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Yeah well, you know what they say about people who wear sunglasses inside.”
“Yeah.”
“Morning, Meg,” says Castiel behind him, and her attention shifts.
When Dean speaks again his voice is definitely softer. “You are an idiot, but alright. Yeah, we just got here,” the frown disappears and his voice goes quieter still, “Okay. Yeah, I’ll see you at home.” his eyes flicker to Sam and he clears his throat so when he speaks again his tone is back to normal. “Remind me to kick your ass for making me worry.”
So he pockets his change once again and takes off towards it.
Dean raises one eyebrow, tilts his head, pursues his lips.
Only, he can’t sit around all day, so he keeps busy, trying at the same time to stay as much as possible away from all the others. He doesn’t need their eyes on him. They are respectful and kind, but Dean knows. Dean knows that deep down they are asking themselves
Cas is dumbfounded for a moment. He looks down at the striped rag in his hands like he has never held one before.
“I heard about the missing people. Pretty freaky, uh?” he says, casually. “Did you know any of them? Heard they were mostly locals.”
Cas rolls his eyes. The water washes away the pinkish suds and Dean towels her off like he himself is a well-oiled machine, making always the same movements, always in the same shapes, with the same kind of towel in his hand, and underneath it, always the same solid, black and silver surface.
If he thinks that he could have -
- them, like this, side by side - it feels right. Dean looks back down shaking his head a little, as if he’s regretting something he has done or something he can’t still bring himself to do.
“It wasn’t unpleasant.”
Then he stops at the liquor store. Jackson will have ready for him two or three cases of the usual beer. From the moment he sees him at the door he talks and talks about how happy he is that the Campbell brothers moved to town, because
Cas walked the length of the porch looking around, then went back to where Dean still stayed seated.
sign half a mile away. The tires squeal on the wet asphalt as he makes a rapid turn and enters the parking lot.
Dean doesn’t like those days. He gets snappy and irritable and Cas leaves and it makes everything worse.
. Cas doesn’t know what she knows but he doesn’t ask. He doesn’t even tell Dean because he doesn’t know how to explain it. She shows him pictures of her grandson and he buys stamps with sea animals to give Jack as a present.
“So you got stuck.”
Dean was about to ask him what exactly did he plan to do with those, if stick them in a family album and also do some bricolage while he was at it when Cas with his red towel on his shoulders sat next to his knee, splashing his legs once again with the cold water of the sea.
“Lights off?” he said, his fingers already on the switcher.
“I am God’s father. There are perks to the position,” Cas says, as they both get inside.
Sam snorted. “Okay, since the answer is no, where’re we going next time?”
“Yeah. Or I could – do just that. Yeah. Sounds great. Just, uh, give me a sec.” he says and before Castiel can say anything else he goes back to the Impala to open the driver’s door.
“Come on,” he simply says, in response to Dean’s silent question. Dean sees that he doesn’t have his coat on either, he must have been right behind him. Dean nods and accepts his help.
Cas remained silent so Dean added. “And we could still do that. It’ll take us more time but we could still do that, we got cars, don’t we? Trains, planes, we can go wherever you like.”
Cas slips his fingers through the hair on the back of his neck and presses his cheek against his.
“Oh,” he says, looking down at his clothes as if he only now remembers that he’s wearing them, “this isn’t mine. I’m just filling for someone else.”
Steve still looks at him unimpressed. “That is exactly what a bad guy would say.”
“A long, nice walk on the beach” mocked Dean. “Should I hold your hand next?”
He can’t contain the smile that takes over his face. He waits a second more before opening his eyes.
“Hey, Sammy, look at me,” he says and Sam seems to make an effort to focus on him, “we are here. We’re gonna get you inside now, you hear me?” he says. “You just gotta hold on for one more minute. I’m gonna check us in and you’ll be warm in no time.”
He got him quickly to the car, but all the motels they passed by were full, and every mile Dean had driven had seemed a mile too far and every second a second too long to have Sam paling and shivering and half unconscious in the Impala.
It’s always too early to interact to anyone; the town is still sleeping and whoever is already around is too groggy or too busy to give you anything more than a curt nod. Cas appreciates that. Although at this point he feels pretty comfortable on Earth, there are times when he still feels like a fish out of water, so he relishes these morning walks that don’t require too much effort.
Seeing him walk away anyway would be too much then.
By the time the sun got too warm Sam and Cas had gotten out of the water too and Dean was starting to see the freckles appearing on his body. They decided to go back inside to cool off and have something to eat, but then Cas fell asleep on the couch watching tv before the meal was even ready, and after lunch Sam said he was going to read out on the porch for a while, so Dean was the only one who went back into the water.
It took a warm bath, dry clothes, a long sesh with the hairdryer (and a half-fight about hair length), all the blankets in the room, a cup of tea – that Steve brought on his own initiative, knocking lightly on their door – two temperature check and a hundred or so questions about how he was feeling, but Dean is fairly certain that Sam is fine now.
Robert doesn’t say anything else, he just clears his throat and looks towards the other room.
“I don’t wanna ask
And there’s also this: are they really ready for Jack’s debut in society? Sam thinks they are. He thinks it’s a great opportunity to show that the community doesn’t have anything to worry about. He’s with them now and he’s not going anywhere so they should get used to that. Cas says he’ll be there to intervene in case things go south and Dean’s mind flashes with Carol’s house burning to the ground after Cas’ has gone all mama swan on the hunters. He meets Sam’s eyes briefly and it looks like he had the exact same images playing in front of his eyes, “I’m sure it won’t be necessary,“ he adds quickly.
The brothers never had many chances to swim so they just stayed near the shore, enjoying the cool of the water and the sensation of their bodies floating, while Cas seem to be taking the sea as his personal Olympic pool. Dean watched him getting further and further away and only really relaxed when he saw him turning around. When he made his way back to them he had short breath. Dean surveyed his sea drops covered face and found him well enough.
They laid their towels on the sand and went for a swim. Sam started bitching about how cold the water was so Dean splashed him to shut him up. It worked.
Dean feels his knees bumping on the back of his seat from time to time and looks at him in the rear view mirror and Cas sometimes catches his eyes and sometimes he doesn’t.
cause he can handle it of course, but Jackson is already grabbing one and cutting him off saying
Dean had just gotten to his last mouthful when Cas pushed his half-finished plate towards him. He did not complain and dove right in again.
But time had changed a few things and Jack had changed a lot of other things. Packing long shelf life items, experimenting with flavours to teach him and show him, working through their supply at the speed of light were just a few of these things. They spend a lot more time at home and Dean for the first time in his life is not in a rush anymore when he goes to buy something. He takes his time, does his maths, ponders his choices, has favourite things now – not just chips and beef jerky, but things like favourite kind of pasta sauce - and he likes it.
Castiel looks at him confused.
“Great.”
Cas frowns slightly at him, “I stick around,” he protests.
Sam raises his eyebrows when he sees the coffee in Dean’s hand but thankfully he doesn’t comment on it. He assures him that he will keep his distance from lakes and other body of waters as he carries his own research, asking questions in tourist points in the nearby towns where hiking trails start and end.
“Sorry we dragged you here,” he finds himself saying, “You never stick around, and for once that you do, that’s what you get.”
They talk again about how they don’t have jack squat.
He hands one to Dean as he comes out from his side but Dean doesn’t take it.
Sam gave him a funny look. “Is he moving in?”
It’s a guy about his height, dark hair and striking blue eyes. He is wearing just a white shirt and a blue vest with a tag that reads
He dared looking up at what he could see of his face but Cas was staring ahead, partially lightened by the crappy tv. Dean closed his eyes, then he reached out and laid his left hand on his, palm against palm.
Despite how hard he tried to ignore it, his eyes kept flicking towards the blood dripping into the pale sand. It wasn’t pretty, the flesh all cut away and split- dark red liquid sliding down the side of his face. Dean didn’t have to check for a pulse to know that Cas was still alive, he could see his chest rising and falling with every shaky breath.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and hugged him. At first, Dean was stiff and tense. He stayed rigid and Castiel could tell that Dean was fighting against every instinct he had. He was fighting against caving in. It was like a hungry street dig being tainted with a piece of steak.
Dean almost chuckled. “No, Cas. I was going to tell you to come sit next to me and watch a movie. You spend so much time just…
Dean sat up in his chair and shook his head in disbelief. “Thank you, thank you so much.” He was going to get home- based on the weather (and his luck) he thought he was going to be stuck on the island, but things were looking up for a change.
Cas shrugged and turned his head to look out the large glass window on the other side of the room. “I guess we go back to our normal lives,” He said, “I’ll head back to the island and you’ll go back to Kansas with your family.”
It was only then did Castiel finally yell, “Brace for impact!”
Suddenly there was an elbow in his guts and Charlie was shaking him out of his popsicle sucking trance, directing his attention down the boardwalk. Dean spotted a man walking in their direction with an open suit jacket and blue tie blowing in the breeze.
Dean let out a sigh. “Lemme get my bag.”
“Nothing to worry about. I just thought I had timed this right so we could avoid this storm,” Cas murmured. “We should be able to go around it and stay out of the real heavy parts, but I’d recommend putting your seatbelt on just in case things get a bit bumpy.”
“I don’t think I’ll be going back to sleep anytime soon,” Cas chuckled. He seemed sad- really sad. Hopelessly sad.
Dean eyed the smoke that was surrounding the outside of the aircraft, the grey plume already reminding him of the storm that was lurking overhead.
Dean didn’t say anything in response but instead grabbed the remote off of the small bedside table. He clicked on the TV and pulled up the news just in time to see his own success story. The anchor spoke about how a helicopter went down in the ocean, carrying only one passenger and the pilot-
Dean walked over and placed his gun down on the wooden dresser. He had a feeling he was going to be there for a while.
Castiel chuckled softly and placed one of his hands on the side of the helicopter as if it was a large black stallion rather than a well oiled machine. “Nervous flier?”
“Holy shit,” Dean exclaimed, shooting upwards. “Holy shit!”
Dean would be lying if he said Castiel wasn’t attractive. He was tall and fit, had light stubble along the bottom of his face, and blue eyes that surely made all the girls go crazy.
Castiel was being sincere, completely blaming the crash on himself. Dean could practically hear his internal monologue,
They walked across the beach, their feet sinking in the soft sand. They picked a spot that wasn’t too close to the shoreline- they couldn’t risk their cry for help being washed away, now could they? They wrote in the sand, making thick lines that were hopefully visible to anyone who might pass overtop of them. Dean noticed how long it took Cas to write out the last S, but he wasn’t going to comment on the uneven lines or the shakiness of it.
The power outage would have been no problem if one of the inhabitants hadn’t spilled his beer all over the backup generator a week before. That inhabitant, of course, being Dean Winchester. There was no power in the bunder at all- except for the emergency backup lights. Sam suggested they must be battery operated, otherwise, they would have no way to light up. Along with the lights, the television, and the internet being out, they were also lacking one of the most important things. Heat. They were in a bunker, underground, in the middle of a snowstorm, with no heat.
. I’m not sure how, but we are, okay?”
Cas nodded again.
The cave fit the two of them nicely, each of them pressed up against an opposite wall so that their feet were just centimeters away from one another. Dean dug out the granola bar from the bottom of his bag, splitting it in half and passing it over to Castiel.
“Is everything alright?”
Dean walked down the corridor, trying to make as little noise as possible as his bare feet hit the cold floor. He knew he should be asleep at this hour- hell, everyone else in the bunker was. But there was just something keeping him from shutting his eyes and calling it a night. Instead, he wandered around the bunker, had a few beers in the kitchen, cleaned his gun, and even tried to bore himself to sleep by reading some old lore. Unfortunately, he was as wide awake as he was when he started and given that it was just past three in the morning, he figured he should at least try to get some rest. He didn’t need much sleep, but he most certainly depended on those four hours he could normally achieve.
It was that line that just sent Dean right over the edge. “You want me to tell you how I really feel, do you?” Dean’s voice started low, “I think you should have told me that flying in this weather was impossible. I think you should have taken the extra time to go around the storm. I think you should have just turned back when the rain got too havey to fucking see through!”
Either that or he was reading something completely different. Humans were funny like that- just as soon as you think you’ve figured them out you realize just how deep and complex they are.
Dean let out a groan of exasperation. It would be so much easier if Jo was a mind-reader who could just see what Dean was thinking without him having to explain it. That would save them both a lot of time.
Dean blinked and swallowed the little bit of saliva hanging in his throat before nodding his head vigorously. “Yeah, yeah. Sounds great, man.”
Cas smiled briefly and bid Dean a good morning, which was cut off by a long yawn. The cut on the side of his head looked okay, at least from where Dean was standing. He couldn’t see any sign of infection, not yet, at least.
That night they slept with their backs barely five feet apart. Dean faced towards the water, his arms clutching onto his messenger bag as he tried not to think about how he could roll over and be right next to Cas. Did Dean actually feel something for Cas or was it just because they were both alone on an island? He fell asleep long before he could answer the question.
Jo seemed unbothered by Dean’s panicked plea and she continued to scratch something down on a yellow notepad. Dean couldn’t see what she was writing.
“Plus, like I said, we don’t keep you around just because you’re an angel,” Dean told him. “I mean, yeah, it was nice to have some Heavenly back up sometimes, but just because you’re human doesn’t mean you’re dead weight. You’re strong as hell, Cas. You can wield a blade like nobody’s business and punch somebody into next week. You’re a freakin’ genius too- you know all this stuff about demons and angels that won’t be found in any lore books. You’re always there when we need you.”
They didn’t talk much, which Dean was okay with. Cas seemed like a nice guy and all but Dean wasn’t exactly up for sharing his life story with a stranger. Was Cas even a stranger anymore? They had survived a helicopter crash together- surely that must account for something.
“There is nothing wrong with me!” Castiel snarled.
Dean opened his eyes and looked out the window, seeing nothing but grey clouds. The wall of rain was on the other side of the storm, blue and purple toned lightning crackling through the distant clouds.
headache.
“How do you know Captain Novak?”
Cas nodded. “You know when you turn the sink on and all the water comes shooting out of the faucet? And then it hits the bottom of the sink and the water splashes out because it has nowhere else to go?”
Cas leaned in closer and Dean could feel Cas’s heated breath spread over his face. “The only thing that’s going to get us killed is your recklessness and pessimistic attitude, so why don’t you just shut your fucking mouth?”
“You know that ain’t true,” Dean hissed.
“Who’s Novak?” Dean asked immediately as he looked between Jo and Gabriel.
“I just need to see if he’s okay,” Dean pleaded.
Dean crouched down and took a look at Cas’ ankle, which was red and swollen. He let out a heavy sigh and smiled up at Cas.
“What the hell are you going on about?” Dean cocked his eyebrow.
Dean watched as the helicopter pilot reached into his pocket to produce a large set of keys. He fumbled with them for a moment before inserting one into the side of the helicopter, popping open one of the front doors and tossing his stuff inside.
“Yes,” Dean chuckled, “I would
Dean felt his mouth go dry when he realized he was actually going to have to get into the helicopter. He hated flying. He hated it so much. He doesn’t know quite where the fear came from- all he knows is that it has dictated every road trip he’s ever taken.
Dean stared at the ceiling and could feel Cas’s eyes on him, but he didn’t say anything. Some things were just better left unsaid.
“A pilot,” Dean slammed his hands down onto the check-in desk. “I need to hire a pilot.”
“We’re really stuck here, aren’t we?” Dean eventually said, not being able to tear his mind away from the thought of being back home.
“Margarita popsicle?” She asked as Dean accepted the offer.
“Yes, well, you have good taste. Most of the time.”
“Fuck!” Cas cursed as he skidded down the slope. It wasn’t an actual drop, more like a steep decline, but Dean was panicking nonetheless.
“So am I, Dean!” Cas said. He sounded exasperated. “I don’t have my grace! I’m no use to anyone as a human. I’m just dead weight.”
Dean’s heart was going to explode out of his chest. He fumbled with the harness style seatbelt, eventually getting himself strapped in. The helicopter tilted away from the dark clouds that they were approaching and aimed more towards the grey sky area.
“What is it I do to you, Dean?”
Cas didn’t even look at Dean when he spoke. “My helpfulness got us stranded on this fucking island. We’re stuck on this island and I- I’m all sorts of messed up,” He stuttered through his words, “I’m hearing shit and seeing things that aren’t there. I can’t concentrate on anything- It’s like I’m always dizzy and I can’t stop- I can’t do anything. I got into this mess because I wanted to help and now I can’t even think straight.” His voice had long since broken, surpassed defeated, the words throwing themselves out of his mouth. It was like opening a set of flood gates.
With another look up and down the dock and a quick glance at the time on his phone, Dean walked up to a relatively empty stand selling different kinds of sea shells.
Castiel gestured vaguely in the direction of his head before locking his fingers in his dark hair, which was already a mess to begin with.
“Me dying?”
“You sure you’re feeling okay?”
It wasn’t even a joke- just a stupid comeback- but somehow it tugged a small laugh out from behind Dean’s lips. “I meant on Great Abaco,” Dean clarified.
He didn’t go flailing down the mountainside, thank God, but it took him a minute to find solid footing again. He felt a sharp pain in his leg and glanced down, noticing a wide gash along the back of his calf.
Dean could tell that Cas was holding back another laugh. “Okay, you do that. In the meantime, I’ll see if I can get those coconuts opened.”
He needed to sit down.
Castiel finally looked down at Dean, his eyes wide and filled with panic. It took him a second but once he registered that Dean was there, his face went soft.
“Local helicopter pilot,” Gabriel had produced an apple and was sinking his teeth into it, chewing as he finished his statement. Dean couldn’t stomach the idea of food right now. “He was practically born to fly- I mean, a real natural. Loves to show off in that stupid junker he keeps down by the docks. Little cocky if you ask me.”
“So Cas- can I call you Cas? Why did you become a pilot?” Dean asked. Castiel was getting to be quite the mouthful.
Dean crouched down in what was left of the cockpit. The inside was almost completely blackened from the fire and smoke. The metal was all warped and peeling, revealing nothing but fried wires and support beams in the walls. Out of sheer curiosity, Dean pressed the buttons on the dashboard. He wasn’t expecting the aircraft to roar to life, but it would have been nice to at least have
“Just ate lunch,” Dean gestured to the plate that had been shoved to the other side of the table.
Cas titled his head. Dean seemed… hungry. Cas could sense he was lacking something- something his body needed to survive. He was so void of this substance that his body seemed to be screaming out for help. Dean was starving.
Dean found himself a lengthy stick that he deemed appropriate for a spear. He and Cas were in their own little worlds, not exchanging a single glance (at least not at the same time). As Dean picked at the end of his spear with a rock, he would occasionally sneak glances at Cas working his way around the outside of a coconut.
“‘Bout 20 minutes,” Castiel told him.
“Don’t think I can’t see you wiping your hands on your pants every five minutes,” Castiel laughed. It was a warm laugh; warmer than the sun-bleached beaches he had spent the past few days visiting. Warmer than those weird steaming shots he and Charlie did the first night they arrived. Warmer than the stuffy air inside the helicopter cabin.
Cas sighed. “Of course I want to go home, Dean.”
Dean eventually slipped off his shoes and made his way down to the water, rolling up his pants and clutching his crafted spear in his hand. He didn’t actually know if there would be any fish big enough to eat this close to the shore, but could you really complete the deserted island experience without trying to fish at least once?
“No, Cas. Nothing on my mind.”
Cas’s eyes lingered on Dean and he could read the energy flowing through his body. It was a difficult thing to explain to an outsider, but he could sense what Dean was feeling. It was a few steps away from mind reading. Castiel essentially had an angelic mood sensor.
“Me neither.”
Dean pushed open his eyes and tried to focus his vision. Standing next to his bed was a tall figure and it didn’t take Dean very long to realize who it was.
Dean was determined to find something useful among the helicopter wreckage despite the fact that deep down he knew there was nothing salvageable. He crawled over the pilot chairs and into the back row, where he had been sitting when they crash landed. There was a large split down the center of the chopper and Dean stepped over it, trying to avoid getting electrocuted by any of the potentially live wires jutting out from the floor.
given you you’re still here. We need you, Cas.
Dean sighed. “Cas, look-”
“I’m fine,” Cas snarled.
“What am I supposed to do?” He asked quietly.
“Yeah, seems so,” The length between Dean’s statement and Cas’ response was notably too long.
“I don’t know if I want to go back to my normal life,” Dean’s voice was barely above a whisper. He did want to go back to his normal life but what he was trying to say is that he didn’t want to go back to before he knew Cas. He wasn’t ready to give that up. Not just yet.
“Well… can’t you get back here and fix it with your angel mojo?” Dean sighed, toying with the empty beer bottle on the table.
Cas let out a deep breath and slowly turned around the face Dean. “I told you- nothing. Nothing’s going on.”
He sat up, cracking his neck and his fingers and just about every part of his body that moved. Cas was still asleep, lying on his side with his arms wrapped around the makeshift pillow that was propping up his head.
He raised an eyebrow. “Got anything stronger?”
“Castiel!” Dean shouted, making Cas stop dead. “I’m over this- okay? Let’s not talk about it then. But we need to figure a way to get off this damn island!”
“Hmm?”
The island began to grow bigger as they approached it quickly, the wind not letting up on them at all. Dean let out a yelp as they spun in the other direction and suddenly they were close enough to the island to see the individual trees that sprouted off of it.
The rain outside was soon accompanied by thunder and Dean suddenly felt very tired. The kind of tired you get after driving across the country all night and you finally crash in a little motel in the middle of nowhere. He adjusted himself on the floor of the cave, tucking his bag under his head as a makeshift pillow. It wasn’t comfortable, but at least it was something. Cas followed shortly after, folding his coat around the bloody Zepp shirt and placing it into the cool dirt.
“Dean?” Cas scrambled off of him, backing away into the dirt, allowing Dean to finally sit up.
Cas’s head kept gently lolling to the side and Dean knew that the blow he took to his head had left him in pretty bad shape.
and break them open,” Dean said, holding up the sharp rock he had found. “Maybe we can write “help” in the sand too.”
“Dean?” The name rolled off Cas’s tongue and made Dean smile.
Not that Dean was big on apologies, but before he could even get one out Cas was spinning around and marching down to the beach. Dean rolled his eyes at first, internally calling Cas immature, but as he walked away Dean felt a twang of regret.
The day had been just about as uneventful as all of the other days spent on the island. Dean practiced his spear throwing, trying to catch them some sort of crab dinner (like Tom Hanks did in Castaway, that movie was honest to God one of the only reasons Dean had made it this far).
Dean pointed out that the helicopter had stopped smoking and that there was no sign of any more flames, so he wanted to go over and investigate.
“Call him, please,” Dean begged. “Price isn’t a problem- I’ll pay him whatever absurd amount he requests. I just need to get home.”
“Are you sick?” Cas blurted out. He needed answers. “Have you summoned something? Or- or made a deal?”
The next thing Dean can remember was being shuttled into the helicopter and being handed a pair of light blue headphones, much like the ones he had worn in Castiel’s helicopter (which remained dead on the beach).
The idea of willingly getting into a helicopter - especially one described as a “junker” - wasn’t something Dean had ever planned on doing in his lifetime. But, alas, life can throw some nasty curveballs sometimes. One of those being a family emergency so severe that it was going to force Dean to leave his vacation four days early.
It wasn’t until they started spinning that Dean really had the urge to throw up. The storm was tossing their helicopter around like the ragdoll, sending them spinning in circles as they headed towards the ground.
He knew it was stupid. It was something you could only get away with in cheesy romance movies, but it wasn’t going to stop him from trying. Dean let out a fake yawn and he stretched out his arms, allowing one of them to wrap tenderly around Cas’s shoulders. He was biting his tongue in anticipation, but when Cas showed no sign of annoyance Dean let out a sigh of relief.
“There isn’t anything to talk about, Dean.”
“I mean, I agree with you, Cas, but what exactly do you want to do?”
Cas cried out in pain and he was sure Dean was asking him all sorts of questions but the only thing Castiel could hear was his brain going into full meltdown mode.
“We’re getting out of here,” Dean whispered. He let out a halted breath before turning to Cas, grinning. “We’re getting the fuck out of here!” He laughed loudly as the minuscule helicopter slowly became more visible.
It had been two hours since the bunker lost power. There was a raging snowstorm outside, complete with howling winds and fog so thick you couldn’t see through it, which was no undoubtedly the cause of the sudden power outage. Living in a fancy bunker had its perks, one of which was a fully equipped back up generator.
“I assume you’re Captain Novak?”
“Mr. Winchester,” She smiled warmly, placing a hand on Dean’s arm while her other hand held onto a clipboard. “What are you doing up?”
He looked up at Cas, who kept drifting off to the side. Dean didn’t want to say anything, in fear of pushing him away again, but as Cas got closer and closer to the edge Dean couldn’t help but speak up.
“Sam told me he would give me details when I land, but I don’t think anything noteworthy has happened yet,” Dean told her as he breathed out a heavy sigh.
Being an angel had its perks.
Only then did Jo look up. Not because of what Dean had said, but instead because another worker appeared behind the desk. Dean hadn’t seen him come in, but his thoughts were so scattered that someone could rob a bank right in front of him and he would have no idea what was going on. Dean didn’t recognize the boy who gave a limp wave to Jo, but the nametag pinned to his black polo shirt stated that his name was Gabriel.
Dean tried to talk to Cas more than once, but every time he opened his mouth he couldn’t think of anything to say. Maybe start with “I’m sorry”? He thought. But what the hell was he apologizing for? For accusing Cas of being concussed? Surely that didn’t warrant an apology.
“If everything is fine then why were you running around in the middle of the jungle? I thought we agreed to stay within shouting distance,” Dean said sternly.
“I don’t deserve your worry, Dean,” Cas said, quietly. It was practically just a whisper hanging on his lips.
The island was huge, at least when you were trying to find someone. Dean didn’t even know where to start looking for Cas- if he was even still here. Even if Dean did have some sort of tracking skill, he was too frantic to admire broken twigs and crumpled leaves. Dean repeated Cas’s name one too many times, yelling it just about every five steps he took.
“You can blame this on me if you want, Dean, but don’t forget that you were the one who was desperate enough to hire me! You were desperate enough to fucking drop almost one grand just to get back home instead of waiting out the storm like a normal fucking person would! If you hadn’t hired me in the first place then neither of us would be stuck here!” Cas was shouting, his voice resonating through the chilled island air.
Cas’s lips were beyond chapped, but being on island would do that to you. Dean didn’t mind, of course, for he was sure his own lips were in no better shape. Cas pulled away gently but stayed close enough that Dean could still feel his breath. Their foreheads were pressed together and Dean wanted to close the small gap between them. He wanted to kiss Cas again and again, wanted to wrap his arms around Cas and never let go.
“Dean, stop!” Cas managed to get words out of his mouth and just in case Dean hadn’t heard him, he held up his hand telling Dean to stay back.
He rolled to his side and then cocked his head when he noticed something else: Castiel was gone.
“Captain Novak!” Dean screamed, his voice cracking and begging for water. He had tried just about every variation of the name Castiel that he could think of, although he was rather unsure why he had done this.
The island fell quiet. Dean could have sworn the birds stopped screeching and insects stopped chirping; it was like when a teacher starts to yell at a student and the whole class goes silent. It was unsettling. Dean knew that if he kept pushing he was bound to get a reaction, but was it really so hard for Cas to admit that he wasn’t quite right at the moment? They survived a helicopter crash, for fucks sake. Usually, people walk away with a little more than a banged-up head- if they even got to walk away.
“Castiel?!” Dean screamed, running through their little base camp and into the thick jungle beyond it.
“Ah, shit,” He murmured, watching thick blood trickle down the back of his leg.
“Cas, hey,” Dean greeted, moving slowly into the room.
Castiel smiled softly- that dumb, dorky smile that could cheer anyone up on a bad day. That stupid smile that was responsible for driving Dean mad. He pulled Cas close to him and their lips collided, sending electric shocks through Dean’s body. He didn’t know if the sparks were because he was kissing an angel or because he was kissing Cas.
Dean couldn’t argue with that.
“I’m fine,” Dean put on his million-dollar smile, hoping it would hide his shaking breath.
He would like to think that he had an eye for these sorts of things, given that he spends almost all of his time in a garage doing restoration work and repairs on cars. He could tell the difference between a well-loved car and one that sat around collecting dust. One thing was for sure- Novak took good care of his helicopter. Clean, tucked away from the crowd, hidden from the majority of the afternoon sun by surrounding trees. Maybe this wouldn’t be too bad afterall.
“I managed to get the coconuts open,” Cas said, standing next to Dean. He had rolled up his pants as well as stripped himself of his suit jacket and tie. He was left in nothing but his black pants and white shirt, which seemed almost translucent in the bright sun.
“About anything in particular or…?” Dean didn’t quite know if Cas wanted to open up. Sometimes he would tell Dean exactly what the problem was and other times he was sealed as tightly as a Ma'lak Box.
They hadn’t been awake for very long when Cas suddenly stood up, tossing the remains of crab meat breakfast aside.
“Well, you’re a shit pilot!” Dean snapped. He didn’t mean to say it, nor did the words hold any truth, but Dean was frustrated. When he got frustrated, his filter slipped.
“Are we going to talk about it?” He spun around on his heels to see that Cas had frozen in place.
“Dean Winchester?” The man asked as he approached, removing his pair of reflective sunglasses to reveal a set of blue eyes that competed with the ocean a few yards away.
Dean, still keeping his gun cocked and aimed, relaxed his shoulders a bit. “I heard you yell. Is everything alright? Did someone get in?”
Cas didn’t respond.
Defeated and with nothing else to do, they began to make their way back down the mountain.
“Excuse me?” Jo raised an eyebrow. She had grown quite familiar with Dean after his arrival at the resort (and after his failed attempt to get her to go out with him). Dean would swing by the lobby at least twice a day and chat with Jo about all the places in town that he just
Charlie shook her head and plopped down next to Dean, stretching her arm high above her head while the other raised the popsicle to her mouth.
Even though he couldn’t Castiel’s face, Dean could tell it had softened purely based on his tone. “I’m sorry to hear that. Is he alright?”
“With what, exactly? Your bare hands?”
“I think we should head back to camp.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Many commercial jumbo jets have crashed as a result of microbursts. We’re just lucky there was an island out here.”
“Can’t argue with that,” Dean smiled.
Now that the dam broke, the words sort of come on their own now. "And, uh, since we're saying stuff. You don't usually start anything unless it's going somewhere, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm cool with, y'know, just making out and stuff." Different thoughts in his head race to his mouth and he has to take a moment to decide what to say first. He feels like a whole idiot. Fuck, it's like he's trying to put together sentences in a foreign language. It all comes out jumbled and disconnected.
He just wasn't used to all that soft, lovey-dovey stuff and it made him want to run the fuck away. He wanted the two of them to work out but he didn't know how to deal with... well, everything. Give him something to fight, to punch and stab, and he's golden. But this '
Chapter title from the song of the same name by Meiko.
Cas' smile is fond. "You were being you." His eyes sparkle lovingly before he closes the distance between them again, deepening the kiss. And a good thing too, since Dean wouldn't know what to reply to that anyway. So he talks with his body: pulls Cas closer, runs a hand through his hair, and makes approving sounds that get carried away by the breeze.
"Yup."
Cas' brow is furrowed. "Why are you sorry when I'm the one that can't get you off?"
"I know", Dean can't resist the reference.
"The harm is that I'm getting a migraine listening to your relationship drama", Sam sighs, with his own bitchface in place. "Just get it out in the open. All the issues. And figure out a solution."
Dean swirls the booze in his glass. He's not giving up that crutch just yet. One problem at a time.
"'kay, I'll talk."
"But it's pretty important. I mean, hey, I'm ain't old yet. Man's allowed to have a libido." He's not being defensive, shut up. "'Sides", he slurs, "sex is the only difference between a friendship and a relationship."
Sam just looks at him with an unamused expression. "Dean. That statement was such bullshit, I can't believe we're related."
Fuck his life.
Home. Just one word but it's the one that makes him feel warm and tingly, more than all the scenery around them. He nods and ducks his head, until he's sure his voice won't betray him as a total sap. Cas cups his face, leans in for a kiss. Dean melts into it, heart rate speeding up as the kiss grows more heated. "Not that I'm complaining, but what brought that on?", he asks.
"Oh, right. I was going to fill it in later but things came up -"
Sam directs an exasperated look skyward. He'd been listening to Dean half-vent (because he can't verbalize half of the things that bother him apparently) for too long. "Look, I don't know how to help you. We're getting nowhere here." He eyes the bottle, then snatches it from Dean. "Go sleep it off. And when you're sober: talk."
"Yes, totally. Communication is the word of the day." Suddenly, a sort of relief floods him, the kind you get when you finally do something you've been postponing and dreading for way too long, and it's not even a big deal. He hears himself laugh. "I'm so glad we're talking." He gets the urge to look at Cas' gorgeous blue eyes, to smile at him, so he indulges himself and turns around. A quick peck on the lips, too, just because he can. Damn, he's actually kinda tipsy.
"You're too obsessed with sex. It's not the most important thing in a relationship."
He mentally rolls his eyes at himself. Man up, Winchester. It's just a conversation, not a werewolf. Though he feels like it'd be a lot easier to deal with the latter.
But he nods because maybe this will be different. He has to let Cas try. Cas flips them over again so he's on top, kisses Dean nearly out of his mind and it feels good, so damn good. Minutes go by, and the voice in the back of his head gets louder. It's not happening, he's taking too long, Cas shouldn't have to try so hard for him, why is he this fucked up -
Sam and his intellectualization. He doesn't get it. Dean knows he should be communicating, just like he knows booze and junk food is bad; doesn't mean he's gonna do anything about it. Thing is, Cas seems happy right now. He seems fine with movie nights and snuggling and peck kisses and those are all great. But. It's not Dean's idea of a relationship, even if he doesn't have much experience with those. Does Cas not think he's hot anymore? Sure, he's hardly a kid, but he's not that old. He can't tell what the angel is thinking half the time, and Dean will drive himself crazy with overthinking and pessimistic assumptions. Hell and the multiple Apocalypses didn't do him in, but relationship drama apparently will. Sonuvabitch.
And he sort of lets himself get a little hopeful that they'll figure this out.
me: wait no - THESIS writing! 😑
Because Cas kinda freaked out. Like, physically moved away, started hyperventilating a little bit. Something about that being a lot of responsibility. Dean didn't catch the whole explanation, he was a bit busy with his own panic attack, a litany of "look what you did you upset him what is WRONG with you why can't you just be normal" going through his head.
Another bite-sized chapter fell out of my brain, so I'm just gonna dump it here. Toodles!
And of course Cas can sense his nerves, or maybe he just knows him that well, because he wraps his arms around Dean and pulls him in so he's half-lying across his lap, back to chest, feeling each other's breathing. It's calming, and intimate, and somehow easier than talking face to face. How Cas knew that holding him would help, when even Dean didn't think of it? Sometimes it feels like the angel understands him so well there's no need for words.
His fingers were flying over the keys before he's thought it through, and really, thinking's overrated. His mind was already coming up with a scenario, easy as pie.
And Dean can't deal with that, can't think about how he can't do this one simple thing right by Cas. So he wraps his arms tighter around him and breathes in deep, letting the smell of Cas' hair be his focus.
Dean writes Destiel fanfiction. He can't believe this is his life.
", Sam catches the omission. Damn him.
Dean? Repressed? Nahhh.
"Sure", Dean replies, plastic smile in place.
He breaks off, closes his eyes for a second. "I'm sorry", comes out all rough and raspy.
"Nope, nah, got it under control. Totally", Dean chuckles completely naturally and not at all forced, as he tries to twist the knife embedded in the material. It crumbles enough to nix that plan but not enough to be opened. Sonuvabitch.
One step forward, two steps back; they were just going to keep dancing around this, like they did with getting together in the first place. After all, both of them were more than capable of ignoring the obvious for literal years. More so because Sam was off on some hunt with Eileen in fuck-knows-where, for fuck-knows-how-long. No catalyst in sight.
Okay, so he's bitching. What's the harm?
Cas) any of the stuff he jerks off to - well that was just out of the question. He tried to tell himself that Cas
Dean lets out a breath he didn't even know he was holding. "Yeah. Yes, that we do." Okay. So Cas also sees the need to communicate, so that's half of the work done, right? They're totally on the same page. He takes another nervous sip and sets his glass down. Eye contact, he should totally do that, right? He looks over at Cas, sitting next to him on the bed.
Dean tries lighting candles. Actual goddamn scented candles, that's how chick-flicky his life is now. Still, worth it if it works.
"Okay, out now. I still have lore to go through tonight."
Cas seems to get the point, tilting his head and listening. "It puts you at ease to have someone else in charge."
In the words of John Mulaney: "I'll just keep all my feelings right here and then one day I'll die."
He remembered the first time he had tried to let Cas know about his kinks. They had been making out, already horizontal, when Dean took Cas' hand and tugged at it. "Dean. Use your words", Cas reminded him gently. "Nope", Dean breathed stubbornly, guiding the angel's hand to his own wrist. "You want me to hold you down?" Dean nodded, arching up into Cas at the sensation of a firm grip on his skin. Acta, non verba - or something like that.
Cas took the cue, a smirk in place as he leaned in to lick the liquor off Dean's neck, and
"And, uh", he says as he pours himself a glass, "remember that link I sent you? The, uh carnalcalibration.com questionnaire?" He clears his throat.
"We could plan a scene? Definitely communicate more."
Sigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It has come to my attention that you're not all that interested in vanilla sex."
It turned out to be a sort of time-capsule from the early days of Men of Letters, spelled to open itself exactly a century after being sealed, and apparently not compatible with the newer warding that saw it as a threat. Sam got his geek on, excited that he got another thing to study, but after the ungodly amount of time it took them to fix the magical alarm, Dean was exhausted and pissed, and he didn't even have any monsters to take out his frustration on.
So he chickens out. He can wait this out, after the current crisis is done. Totally doable. He lasted thirty years of torture in Hell, he can postpone one conversation. He just wished it didn't make him feel like a ton of bricks got deposited on his chest.
, so to speak. Told him his safeword, too.
So. That's where Dean's headspace is.
Well, he tried.
Chapter title from Graveracer by Michael Malarkey.
"Nerd", Dean chuckles as he gets up.
"And if I happen to forget anything else - don't hesitate to remind me", Cas adds, running his knuckles down Dean's cheek. Shit, that feels good.
"Ya know distractions are good for that", Dean continues, his voice dark molasses right into Cas' ear. "I can be a pretty good distraction."
Cas is biting his lip, trying not to smile too wide but Dean's busy being spectacularly stubborn anyway. He'll get it opened if it's the last damned thing he does. He curses and readjusts his grip on the knife handle, before he feels hands gently tugging the bottle away. "We'll open that at home, okay?"
"It's okay, I know you have a lot to do", Dean ducks his head. It's not a big deal, he doesn't know why he's even bringing it up. "It's just sometimes people 'forget' stuff as a way of subtly letting you know they aren't interested..." His face is heating up again. He feels ridiculous and petty talking about these minor issues - it's not like it's the end of the world (again).
Dean shrugged at this. If somehow after hours upon hours of rain, the helicopter wreckage was still flammable, then by all means, let it explode. Dean would think that was rather impressive. He climbed in through the front of the helicopter, carefully avoiding the shattered glass around the edges.
“You’ll like it, trust me. It’s about these space explorers who discover a bunch of alien eggs on their ship and-” Dean cut himself off as he walked over to the television to pop the disk in. “Just trust me. It’s a classic.”
“Do you know where I can find Captain Novak- the helicopter pilot?” Dean inquired, snagging the attention of the middle-aged lady running the stand.
Dean was a few paces behind Cas, not really paying too much attention to their surroundings as they made their way back down the mountain side. Dean still had the sinking feeling in his stomach- the feeling that they were going to be stuck here forever. He couldn’t seem to shake it off no matter how hard he tried to focus on other things.
Dean took a seat against one of the trees, the sharp bark poking through his shirt. Cas sat on the other side of the fire. Dean kept looking at him through the warm glow of the flames, his face orange and yellow.
“It means a lot of things, Dean. It means I’ve been spending my time in Heaven trying to get thousands of angels to stand down and not obliterate everyone I love. So I apologize for being absent recently, it’s just that I prefer my friends alive.”
Dean sighed and dragged his hands down the side of his face, suddenly longing to be asleep so he could be oblivious to all that was happening around him. He crawled forward and stuck his head out of the cave. The rain had stopped and there was nothing to show for it except some wet plants- the sun was fully out this morning, not a cloud in the sky.
Dean sighed. “You hit your head in the crash. You probably just have a really nasty concussion and that’s fine, but you need to say that you aren’t up to par! It’s not going to do either of us any good if you keep acting like there’s nothing wrong!”
“Where are we?” Dean looked around their little clearing as if he was expecting there to be a big flashy welcome sign for stranded tourists.
The trees were providing Dean with a nice shade, protecting him from the harsh sun. Water occasionally dripped down from the canopies, sending a cool chill down his spine every time it did so. He was already thinking about his shower back home in Kansas. Thinking about his little house with a park just across the street. Thinking about waking up for his mundane job at the auto shop and then coming home with grease all over his hands. Thinking about a nice beer to accompany whatever cable TV had to offer that night.
But at the end of the day, it didn’t matter. As the rain fell outside, bouncing off of the trees and burrowing in the dirt, nothing mattered. They were on the same playing field. Both Dean and Cas were shoved inside a cave on an island in the middle of nowhere, neither sure if anyone was looking for them, without any clue on how to survive.
“That nickname isn’t uncommon,” Cas said before answering Dean’s second question. “I don’t know why I became a pilot. It just seemed fun so… one day I went out and got my pilot’s license and now I do island tours and charters.”
Cas went quiet again after that.
“Out,” He leaned against the doorframe and tilted his head. “What are you watching?”
“Ah,” Dean nodded his head. He had his fair share of bad dreams; it was just part of the business. If there was a hunter out there who had never once gotten a nightmare Dean would pay a hundred bucks just to meet ‘em. With the kind of shit they saw on a day-to-day basis nightmares were practically guaranteed.
“What the hell, man?” Dean asked.
Sam burst into a grin and sat down in a chair, pulling it as close to Dean’s bed as he could.
Cas nodded. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Cas, they’re just dreams. Me and Sammy are big boys, we can take care of ourselves, you know.” Dean tried to be reassuring but it wasn’t exactly something he excelled at.
Dean let out a shuddering breath. “I don’t like what you do to me, Cas.”
There was nothing. Blue water stretched out in all directions, melding with the horizon to the point where you couldn’t tell what was water and what was sky.
“You just seem like the type of person a lot of people would be into, that’s all,” Cas told him, not quite looking at him but looking past him instead, “You just have that general vibe.”
“Nothing to worry about. Nothing that’s worthy of being worried about,” Cas told him. He ran a hand through his hair and let out a heavy sigh. He tried to hide it behind that dorky smile of his, but Dean could see right through.
“Dean?” Cas asked, softly.
After walking for ages in complete silence (well, silent if you ignore their heavy breathing) they reached what would be considered the top. It was a fairly flat area, and the moment they reached it Dean planted his sweaty hands on his knees and took in a deep breath.
“You’re right, Dean. We are stuck here,” He spat, “That’s probably why I’ve been acting weird! I’m hungry, I’m tired, I’m terrified for my life! I want to go home!”
Dean eventually got to his feet and dusted the sand from his pants. He knew he had to go back to the campsite eventually, especially because he left his bag over there, but he would be damned if he wasn’t going to try and prolong it as much as possible.
The trees seemed to part a little and since he was growing exhausted of hacking through vines, he moved in the direction of the clearing. Dean spun around, suddenly realizing just how alone he really was. He was deep in the jungle and was probably fairly close to the middle of the island. He screamed out, again and again, just waiting for a response. Every time he opened his mouth he was reminded of how raw his voice was, of how chapped his lips were. He screamed himself hoarse before his voice finally gave up on him- before he finally accepted defeat.
“Is there anything else on your mind, Dean?” Castiel whispered, his lips just barely hovering over Dean’s.
“Why don’t you just make me?” Dean’s voice went low and gravelly, much different than what it had been before.
Dean approached their basecamp and saw Cas crouched over the pile of wood, attempting to start a fire with the stick in between his hands.
“We’re going home!” Cas cheered as he threw his arms around Dean’s neck, yanking him into an embrace.
The lightning was quickly followed by the thunder, which was somehow more deafening than the rain. Dean could feel the vibrations through the floor of the cabin, making his legs shake even more than they already were. He had one hand wrapped around his messenger bag, the other gripping the seatbelt tightly. He couldn’t help the small gasp that escaped from his lips when the helicopter dipped to the side, but he noticed it was just Cas steering them away from the middle of the storm.
Dean leaned his head back against the trunk of the tree and sighed. He closed his eyes for just a moment and focused on the sound of the fire, the sound of Cas’s breathing a few feet away from him. The sound of ocean waves rolling against the shoreline.
“C’mon, Captain,” Dean was terrified. What if Castiel didn’t make it and left Dean all alone? What if he was going to be stuck on this island, by himself, until he starved to death? What if-
“Cas?” Dean’s hands hovered over the pilot’s body. “Captain Novak?!” He gripped onto one of his shoulders, trying to shake him awake.
“Dean,” Cas leaned over and spoke into Dean’s ear, his voice low and gravelly. “Sometimes I think you forget that I can sense when people are lying.”
“Hey man, what the hell are you doing out here?” Dean cocked an eyebrow and loosely gestured to their exotic surroundings.
They pulled apart briefly and Cas cupped the sides of Dean’s face, their foreheads pressed together.
Dean ran both hands through his hair, almost having to resist the urge to yank it all out. “You aren’t! You’re not fine! Why can’t you just admit that?” Dean asked, desperately. “You’re going to get yourself, or even the both of us, killed if you keep wandering off like that!”
He looked as if he was on the verge of tears. It was clear that the subject at hand was like a dam that had begun to crack and the more Dean asked, the more water would come flowing through. At some point, though, the dam was going to come down.
“Just try to relax,” Castiel told him. There was something about his tone, or maybe his posture, maybe it was the slightly unbuttoned collar, but there was something about him that Dean trusted. He was actually kind of okay with trusting this guy with his life.
They couldn’t stand to be up there any longer. They had put off climbing the mountain for so long Dean couldn’t help but have hope for what they would find at the top. The mountain was his way of thinking that maybe there was someone else out there, maybe there was a way off that they just hadn’t found yet. But there wasn’t. There was quite literally nothing. Any bit of hope Dean had left had drained from his body.
It was hard to hold a grudge when the person you were holding a grudge against was the only other person on the island, but somehow both Dean and Cas managed to do so. Every time they would get within 10 feet of each other, one of them would dramatically storm away.
“I said I would get you back home and anyone will tell you that I’m a man of my word.”
His messenger bag bounced heavily against his leg now that it was weighed down with coconuts. He wasn’t even sure if they were going to be able to break them open, but it was worth a shot. Dean had picked up a rather sharp looking rock somewhere along the way and he hoped they could use that to help them with the whole coconut situation.
Dean made the mistake of looking up from the ground when Castiel started to speak and balled his sweaty hands into fists when he looked out the large window in front. “Family emergency,” Dean explained. Usually, he would leave it at that, but they weren’t even a quarter of the way done with the flight and some small talk might help to take his mind off of things. “My dad was in a car accident. My brother is with him now but… I have to go make sure he’s okay.”
Cas didn’t respond. His face had fallen flat, his lips drawn into a tight line. He avoided Dean’s gaze for a moment and focused his eyes somewhere else. Dean became worried he had pushed Cas’ boundaries again, worried that he had upset him, but Cas turned to face him slowly.
“I can’t move my leg!” Cas panicked. He looked down at his leg and then back up at Dean with wide eyes.
“Dean?” Cas said.
Satisfied with his findings, Dean began to march back in the direction of their camp. “Camp” was a rather generous word in this situation. It wasn’t even a camp- it was just the area where Cas was. So he wasn’t heading back to camp, he was heading back to Cas.
Castiel sighed and took a seat on the edge of the bed, seemingly miles away from where Dean was positioned. It was almost like he was trying to make things awkward. Cas kept his posture stiff and his eyes glued to the laptop at the end of the bed. Dean, on the other hand, was looking anywhere but the screen. He was bearing a hole into the back of Castiel’s head, hoping that he would just turn around.
I don’t think I’ve seen you take a minute to breathe in months. We can discuss the angel issues at a later date, just… watch a movie with me. Like old times.”
Dean was wearing more layers than he would ever like to admit and had wrapped himself in the blankets on his bed. He had, embarrassingly enough, been watching Dr. Sexy M.D. He had a file on his laptop that contained nothing but pirated episodes of his favorite guilty pleasure.
“No, no. It’s a good memory,” Dean told him.
Dean couldn’t help but scoff. “Clearly something is going on! You’ve been acting real weird.”
They didn’t exchange any other words for the rest of the night. They just went through the motions; eating what they could and trying to quench their thirst. They sat in a comfortable silence as they waited for the fire to die down. The flames grew smaller and smaller, much like the hope that Dean cradled so closely. They had been there for too long; they were surely on their own by now. Someone must have called off the search.
Without any sort of warning there was suddenly a body crashing down on top of him, knocking Dean down into the dirt. When he looked up he realized it was Cas, or at least a clearly sleep-deprived version of him. He was mumbling quickly, stringing together words at a rate much quicker than what Dean was capable of comprehending.
Dean sat still for a moment, partially hanging on his side as he tried to calm himself down. The ceiling and wall around him were completely caved in and dented, the windows shattered to the point where there wasn’t any glass left attached.
“You little
Dean furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. “I thought you said you just wanted to become a pilot because you thought it was fun.”
Dean let out a breath of air that was just on the verge of a scoff. “What are you? My mother? I’m fine, Cas.”
Dean turned to look at the rocky mountain that loomed over the rest of the island. It probably wasn’t even that tall, but it was steep and intimidating (especially if you haven’t been eating or sleeping properly).
Cas almost started laughing but it came out like a repressed snort instead. He eventually settled down, but when Dean hadn’t made any follow up statements Cas must have realized he was being serious.
“Damnit, Cas,” Dean murmured. He picked his bag up from behind one of the trees and flipped it open, digging around for his lighter. He pulled it out and held it in his hand for just a moment before holding it to Cas. “Take the lighter.”
Jo mumbled something about “Actually having to get to work” and she exited the room through a back door, disappearing into the inner workings of the resort.
“What do you really think we’re going to find up there?” Dean picked at the leftover crab that had somehow got itself stuck between his teeth. He missed burgers.
“Give me something, give me something,” Castiel yelled, his hands flying between the different helicopter controls. Dean felt the aircraft soar upwards again and they peaked over the top of the fog. For just a moment, Dean could see clearly. Up ahead, there was a small landmass jutting out of the ocean. Cas must have spotted the island the same time that Dean did because suddenly Cas was fighting against the wind, doing his best to make them spin in the general direction of the landmass. They might not die, but they were certainly going to crash. That much was inevitable. Dean almost wishes it was still raining so he had some noise to distract himself with because now all he had was his own screaming thoughts and Castiel’s string of unintelligible commands and cuss words.
The temperature was dropping fairly quickly. Too much time had passed and Sam had made no progress on fixing the generator. Dean had tried to help, but Sam had pushed him away and told him to let him have some room- something about his big nerd ego probably.
“Yeah, well, nobody asked you,” Jo retorted. She pushed her hair back and pulled a face in Gabriel’s direction. Turning back to Dean, she said, “Gabe here is right. Captain Novak is probably the only person who is just crazy enough to go out in this kind of weather.”
“Dean?” Cas said softly into the microphone on his headset. “You have nothing to worry about. This is just the tail end of a storm- a minor inconvenience is all.”
Dean sat up, quickly looking around the area in case Cas had just gotten up to stretch his legs or something, but he wasn’t anywhere that Dean could see. Dean jumped to his feet, his heart rate beginning to accelerate.
“Goodnight, Cas.”
“Dean,” Cas said as he followed closely behind Dean, “It’s useless. Everything in there is going to be all burned up.”
It was like Castiel couldn’t hear him. When he finally turned to face Dean, his eyes were completely glossed over and he had a dopey smile on his lips.
