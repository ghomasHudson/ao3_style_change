Castiel whimpered.  He clenched his thigh muscles, spreading his legs wider in an attempt to stay upright through the pounding.  “Please, alpha mine.  Claim me.”
The pack didn’t dawdle, and a half hour later they were back in motion.  It was well past dark before they stopped again, this time to camp for the night.  Now that he knew what to expect, Castiel got out of the way and watched as the camp was efficiently set up.  A small fire made, bedrolls passed out, while the designated cook dumped dried meat and veggies into a large pot over the fire, tossing a homemade sachet of spices in to the mix.  Surprisingly, it made for a very decent meal, and before he knew it, Castiel was comfortably full, tucked into a bedroll between several of his packmates.  As with the night before, he surprised himself by quickly falling asleep.
Dean looked back up, somber green eyes boring holes into Castiel.  “Did you hear me, Cas?  Did I pray to you?”
He hesitated.  This was more than a simple yes or no.  Was Castiel indeed incapable of taking this to the next level of intimacy if he wasn’t the one with ultimate control?  There had been times Dean had taken up the ‘driver seat’ from beginning to end, quite a few times actually, but the underlying fact remained that Cas had always held ultimate power in their coupling.
What was with Cas and the damn hickies all the time?  Of course, the dude always had been into marking.  And the impulse hadn’t exactly been curtailed when they’d finally started sleeping together.  He needed to remember to make Cas heal all the overtly visible ones when they were done.  Past experience proved he’d ‘forget’ to remove the ones that could be hidden beneath clothing, regardless of Dean’s requests.
“I know that he has had sex with men in both of the positions you’ve described,” Castiel told him.  “I’m not sure what his preference is, though. We haven’t discussed it.”
Jo Harvelle was tough as nails, like her mother.  The plucky young beta had a gift for knives and a supreme willingness to use them.
“Damn it, Cas.  You had to have figured out early on it was a dead end and you couldn’t track me that way.  Why didn’t you block me?”  Dean demanded harshly.  “There was no reason to hold on to that link.”
Hours after Dean had done every possible thing he could think of to bolster their aging ride and reluctantly headed back in, Dean decided that he’d had about all he could of existing in the same damn room.  Cabin fever was a bitch and Dean needed out.  Of course, he couldn’t exactly head out to the local bar like normal.  For starters, the closest one was the better part of an hour out; secondly they were in hiding for a reason.
He cocked his head, hearing soft voices in the other room.  Taking a deep breath, he smelled sex, food, and the slightly cloying, unwelcome scent of an alpha not his own.  Realizing he was starving, he rose.  He took the time to dress, aware that showing up in a lack of clothing would only incense his mate.
Nonetheless, folk gamely climbed through the remains, covered head to toe in thick protective garb, their faces covered in hankies in an attempt to keep their lungs clear of the grainy smoke, hoping to find enough pieces of packmates to identify who was in the wreckage and salvaging anything worth keeping or selling.
But there was no need to use violence with Dean these days.  No, Castiel had found a much more effective, and admittedly far more satisfying, way to deal with his stubborn hunter.
She sighed.  Her pack had never been big, a dozen or so families that lived around here and a handful of strays.  Traders mostly, helping run the Roadhouse and keep it supplied.  Plus another dozen or so permanent loaners quick with a gun and a willingness to use it.  It had always been enough.
Crowley side-eyed him, grinning that snarky gaze that never failed to make Dean want to punch a few of his teeth out.  There was no chance that this was a random prize.  Crowley knew very well how much the Winchester needed gunpowder.  No, this was a game for his own dark amusement, not to mention profit.
Actually, it was quite a bit more than a quarter, but norms couldn’t naturally detect when another person had a secondary nature.  And thanks to a whole fuck-ton of bias, most duals chose to stay firmly in the closet.  But there was no hormone or special spray to hide them from each other.  A dual always recognized another dual.
Of course his father found out.  Not much got past John Winchester.  And in John’s defense, he didn’t blame Dean, not really.  He blamed himself.  Which was so much worse.  Blaming Dean, or even Sam, for the choices they’d made meant a spanking, cold treatment for a time, or worse of all, making it clear he was disappointed.
Apparently he’d managed to get everything more or less correct, because the woman walked away with her purchases without ever having exchanged eye contact, much less dialogue with him.
Dean fought back against the rough onslaught, plying all his strength against the angel’s, to no avail.  He’d admitted to Cas in the past that the angel was the only man Dean had ever been with that had the sheer physical strength to hold him down during sex.  And he’d had no trouble admitting to Cas that he liked it.  A lot.
He found his shirt on the hood of the Impala and slid it over his rapidly cooling torso, not bothering to turn in ride-side-in.  It wasn’t that warm outside, and he’d worked up quite a sweat, his semi-naked body rapidly chilling in the cool night air.  He opened the back door and dug around until he found a bottle of water.  He took a deep swallow, relishing in the cooling liquid.
She gave her mother another quick hug, and if it felt a little desperate, she was entitled.   Seventeen was far too young to bear the responsibilities she’d had to take on.
Sweet Mother Moon, he smelled delicious.  Like new leather and fresh tobacco, with just a hint of honeysuckle.  Castiel couldn’t help but take another intense inhalation, drawing that luscious scent in and holding it close.
Her body language was very dominant, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything.  He’d learned not to make role-based assumptions around here.  A cursory scenting told him she was almost certainly beta.
This wasn’t a new thing.  Cas had always been fond of…well, petting for lack of a better word.  He could spend an hour just touching.  Dean would be lying if he said he hadn’t enjoyed the angel’s focused attention, his clear admiration and pleasure in Dean’s body.  But that was before Cas had chosen to betray them.
“The last time I had him, I started him on his back, after getting that stupid coat off, of course.  We were on a big bed, plenty of room to maneuver.”  Purple hair placed a hand on his inner thigh, massaging gently.  Dean spread his legs just a few inches, enough to signal encouragement without breaking off his story.
Castiel deliberately worked the battered fabric of his tie loose until hit hung untied on either side of his neck.  It's presence didn't bother him, but he knew Dean liked the look on him, and he'd need any edge he could get.  He slid off the old, battered trench coat that was as much a part of his identity as his vessel’s blue eyes, and threw the heavy jacket onto the bed.  The whole time he kept his gaze locked on Dean, watching the hunter’s expression go from the familial aggressive/defensive to blank, then to wary.  Because there were a few different ways this could go.
He had a fleeting thought of stopping Dean, asking if they could trade places.  It seemed safer, easier to take lead position.  He’d never felt particularly vulnerable during any type of sex with Dean before now.  Of course, that was when he had super strength and could disappear anywhere in the world with a single wing-beat.
Sam cleared his throat, fighting back the deluge of questions.  Was Dean okay? What did this mean?  Was it different, or escalative if an Alpha in rut and an omega in heat paired off?  The movies made it seem like that was the natural conclusion.
Takes place at Rufus' cabin, while Sam and Dean are hiding out, just after acquiring a newly awakened Crazy Castiel from the psych ward. Same day he manifests the Twister game (hence the name).
“Well, since we’ve settled our minor differences, I’ve been empowered to negotiate a deal.  Clever of your brother, by the way.  I can honestly say that was a first for us.  The lads will be talking about it for eons.”
It was Dean who eventually found him, of course.   Castiel was at the north edge of pack territory, deep in the woods with no clear recollection of how he’d gotten there.  A benign glow from the half moon filled the night, the bright Cheshire smile holding court over a star laden night.
Cas rolled his eyes, shoving the Hunter all the way onto his back.  Dean went with it, pillowing his head on his crooked arm, bicep casually bulging in a pose Cas knew wasn’t feigned.  Dean was always sexiest when he wasn’t trying, his natural grace and inherent masculinity more stimulating then any practiced moves or poses.
“Sam, that isn’t what I mean.  I understand that Dean is very, very good. But he can’t win, not against one of them.”
Jo also wanted Ash, the pack’s self proclaimed ‘mad-scientist’ to test the gunpowder, and she had a few blades she’d acquired that needed to be properly checked into the Arms house.  Anyway, the Pack Alphas needed some time together to touch bases.
Bobby sat in the car, staring at nothing.  He’d just spent the better part of a day stalking Mrs. Daphne Allen while she ran errands, her husband in tow.  Or the man that she claimed as such, anyway.  Bobby hadn’t found any paperwork making it legal, but he’d seen a generic kinko-quality certificate hung in the hallway of their home when he’d snuck in to take a peak around.  Not a big deal in and of itself, lots of folks didn’t bother involving the government in their personal lives.
Dean was panting now.  He rested his forehead on the angel’s chest and closed his eyes, reveling in the dual sensations.  Blushing virgin, his ass.  That damn angel just needed to be sure of his welcome and shy and innocent went right out the fucking window.
Satisfied that her friend and one of the few remaining fighters left to her was going to be okay, Ellen turned back, looking into the distant south.  They had a few vehicles.  Not enough for everyone to ride, though.  Even if they left everything behind.  And they’d never be fast enough on foot.  Running wouldn’t work.  Fighting was death.
Straight up smut.  Originally meant to be lighthearted but Dean wouldn't allow it, the damn Broody McBrooderson.  So now it's angsty smut.
“No, Dean.  You really don’t.”  Cas leaned forward, claiming the other man’s lips in a savage kiss.  He may not be an Angel, or quite as powerful a human as Dean, but he wasn’t a doormat, either.  Cas was plenty strong enough to handle his Hunter.  And he certainly wasn’t going to give this up because of irrational fear.
Not that Cas wasn’t scared.  He was terrified for the brothers, two very large males capable of inflicting serious damage on each other, but he had no fear of Dean.  No matter how enraged, his mate would never harm him, even on accident.
Whatever Dean was thinking about, it must be a pleasant thought; Castiel reflected.  Dean had a slight smile his face, green eyes sparkling with some inner knowledge.  As if there was a joke in there somewhere that only Dean was privy to.
Grinning to himself, Dean spun back around and on near silent feet ran back the other way.  Ha.  It was a nice try, but his Alpha would have to work a hell of a lot harder to get him.
“Dean,” he told his brother softly, his tone openly concerned.  “This is a problem. You have to know that.”
Dean considered his options. One:  he could settle down and try to get some rest; or   B) he could fuck with his brother’s belongings.  While the latter wouldn’t do him as much good as sleep, it was a surefire guarantee of future entertainment during the trip home.
“I’m sorry you wasted a trip,” Sam reiterated.  “But everyone on our lands is Pack.  No exceptions."  Dean glowered silently next to him, but at least he didn’t disagree with the statement.
Ellen glanced back at the trucks filled to capacity with crates.  “Looks like we took in a good haul.”
He glanced around at the myriad of humans patronizing the busy library.  Perhaps it was better if he go back to books, more familiar ground for him.  But he’d been told the device before him was the greatest repository of human knowledge in existence.  Surely it would be the best place to find what he sought.
Dean took after their mother. Like her father before her, she’d been born with a secondary nature, though ‘lone-wolf’ was an extremely rare sub-designation.  Dean could only wish he’d picked up that share of the genetics lottery.  But no.
Sebastian choked, once again expelling coffee. “A bluh..bluh…aga…against the car?  That car?” Sebastian seemed to have temporarily broken again.  Castiel waited.
It had taken only a few minutes in Dean’s company after his suspiciously easy escape from Michael for it to became apparent to Cas that Dean didn’t realize that his desperate pleas for help had been strong enough to connect with the Angel.
Motion from the distant pasture briefly caught his attention.   It was nothing, one of the girls shifting around to get closer to his brother.  Initially, Sam had been worried about the girls’ safety, but Dean hadn’t shown any interest in causing them harm so far.
“Every time he goes into a fight I wonder if this is the last time I’ll see him, my brother, again.  Or will he become a monster in truth, someone that I have to hunt down before he becomes something he’d never want to be.”
With a tired grin, Dean wandered off across the open meadow to the cabin closest to Sam’s.  Sam leaned against the porch rail, watching as a petite shape materialized against the dawn light to meet his brother, rising on tip-toe to wrap her arms around him.  Dean bent down and accepted Ellen’s hug, holding her close for just a tad longer than usual, then made his way up the stairs and inside the house.
Dean threw back his head and laughed with his whole body, and it was beautiful.  All the more so for it being so rare a thing for the damaged Alpha.  Cas decided right then he would do anything to hear that carefree sound again.
A shift on the bed marked Cas settling back down beside him, both hands on Dean’s body now, caressing and massaging.  Dean squeezed the pillow under his head, senses on high alert as he listened for the Angel’s next move.  Another flash of heat, and the remainder of his clothing joined his shirt in a pile of ashes on the bed.  Dean winced.  That one, he regretted.  Those had been awesome jeans.
If Dean was willing to be on the receiving end of penetration, he would definitely be a ‘pushy bottom,’ Castiel decided.
Castiel quickly developed a new appreciation for the Winchester’s ‘get the hell out at the first hint of dawn’ approach to travel.  By the time the sun had reached its zenith, the heat had built up to miserable temperatures.
Dean shrugged, the movement tugging at where they were tied. Cas grunted at the uncomfortable jostling.
The omega who’d been in charge of dinner appeared at Dean’s side, subtly refilling the grouchy Alpha’s oversized cup with coffee while Dean answered a steady flow of questions directed at him.
Dean growled at her.  She winked back, smiling enticingly.  Her smell said she was totally interested in a romp if he was.  Reluctantly, Dean abandoned the chance of a good after-fight lay.  He had an encampment full of twitchy pack mates and an abrasive omega to see to.
Castiel’s inner omega was going crazy, doing the lambada, a tango, and some form of chaotic interpretive dance inside him at this development.  It urged him to rub up against his Alpha, to seduce with his body and his scent.  This was a fit mate for him, his omega self pressed. Strong, protective, controlled.  Dean smelled so good.  It was taking all of Cas’ will to hold back.
“Let him be,” Sam cautioned, taking a hold on Cas’ shoulder.  “Dean isn’t himself right now.  Just give him some time.”
How had he gotten free?  Had Dean finally managed to find oblivion?  Had he struggled so hard that Michael sent him into a new torture?  Cas had no way of knowing.
Dean dropped his head back against the concrete wall, eyes closed.  “I quit having heats by 19.  I didn’t have another one until I dug myself out of my grave and realized that my reincarnation had been just a bit too thorough.  Thanks for that, by the way.
John walked over to where his youngest looked up at him with solemn eyes.  Sam couldn’t know about this.  John wouldn’t allow it to poison him.  And if that was pure selfishness on his part, well, he never claimed to be anything like perfect.
Castiel blinked his eyes, attempting to adjust to the unfiltered dawn light.  It’d been a solid four days, moving into five, since he’d seen the light of day beyond a dim haze hidden behind thick curtains.  It was past time he step outside the house and reacquaint himself with the outdoors.
It required quite a few folk to adequately man a supply run, not to mention the several spares that wrangled a place in the caravan for the sheer thrill of it.  All told, twenty of his people were out in the world, far away from the safety of Winchester territory.
Dean scanned the area, catching sight of Persephone’s Alpha sitting on the raised dais built to oversee the fights.  He was short, small for an alpha, but a vicious, conniving bugger of a man.  Crowley was currently lounging atop his mammoth throne of a chair, sipping from the new bottle of Hunter’s Helper that he’d been 'gifted' when the Winchesters first rolled in. Crowley noticed him back, smiling sardonically.  Dean winked back.
This was ridiculous.  It had been 26 minutes.  Did Dean really need to be in the shower this long?  Perhaps Castiel should damage the water-heating device.  If Dean had only cold water available then surely he’d get out, wouldn’t he?  Castiel was fairly certain that it wasn’t healthy for a human to be under such hot water for so long. As Dean’s guardian, Castiel had an obligation to protect him from these types of risks.
Castiel, Angel of Thursday, and one of Heaven’s finest warriors (redacted), was no stranger to imprisonment.  Or torture.  He’d been savaged with angel blades, beaten bloody, lied to, spelled into raging insanity, hell, he’d even had pieces of his very essence sliced out through his eyeball with an angelic laser.  Yes, he knew a thing or two about torture.
“Firstly, three crates filled to the brim with highest grade gunpowder!”  The crowd roared in approval.  An excellent bid.  Dean turned away to gleefully catch Sam’s eyes.  His brother had gravitated close enough to see the fight ring over the heads of the crowd.  He gave Dean a thumbs up; eyes alight at their future prize.  Guns the Winchesters had aplenty.  Keeping them loaded was the issue.
It was a lot to take in.  Too much, actually.  And his upcoming heat wasn’t making it any better.  The longer he waited, the better everyone started to look.  He’d found himself evaluating betas as they passed and scenting every alpha that came near.  Despite the way he was radiating pheremones, Castiel had not gotten a single catcall or vulgar sexual offer.  Generally his condition was either politely ignored, or sympathetic glances sent his way.
“Yeah, good luck with that,” Dean muttered, striding away towards his and Sam’s shared tent and the nearest bottle of Hunter’s Helper.  He wanted a solid head start on that bottle before getting his arm popped back into place.
“What?” Dean asked, voice raspy.  Damn, he was hoarse.  He sounded like he’d been on a weeklong bourbon bender.  No matter, a few salt-water rinses and some cough drops and he’d be fine.
“Fine, fine,” Dean muttered, allowing Sam to help him fit the thing across his chest.  “But when half the pack thinks I’m broken and challenges me you’ll have no one but yourself to blame.”
Dean swore.  He reached forward and grabbed Castiel by his coat, hauling the Angel close so he could stare down into his eyes.  The storm green of Dean's eyes was so bright they appeared to glow, echoing his rage. Castiel blinked, convinced for a moment that they actually did.  Which shouldn't be a complete surprise.  Technically, Dean was an Archangel at the moment.
Castiel wouldn’t blame the Alpha for making a move, not with the way he was stinking up the place, but he would take actions to dissuade him.  Castiel was a being of more than simple instinct, and his mind was not on board with his body’s clear message of ‘Oh, hell yes’.
There was no thought, no rational process in Castiel’s actions.  He reached for his grace.  Fighting against the magically enhanced Angel cuffs attempt to restrain access power, he ignored the wrenching pain and pulled hard on his Grace.  He only had a moment before the cuffs firmly shut him down, but it was enough.
“Magog, take that Winchester bitch down and win us the omega!  Your brother could use a mate.”  Dean glanced over to the speaker, noting the trademark shoulder length salt and pepper hair.  Rafe, naturally.  He was the Alpha for the Fang Pack.
If his chilly demeanor bothered Dean, the other man gave no indication.  He drove the Impala with the casual ease of long experience, no trace of tension in his slouched position behind the wheel.  Considering how much time he spent traveling with his brother, Dean was probably accustomed to a fair amount of sulking from the right side of the vehicle.  Not that Sam would ever admit that that was what he was doing, but it had always seemed that way to Cas.
Castiel had never actually been to Dean’s house.  He’d been in the Alpha Curve plenty of times, but it was usually to see Sam.
Ellen’s mate had loved the place as much as she did, Mother Moon shine on him.   He’d given her a daughter as tough her mother but caring like her dad.  And now it was gone.  This was the only life Jo had ever known, gone completely to rubble.  There was nothing left to build on, and certainly no money for supplies.
He didn’t know why he’d never told Sam, or anyone else about what they’d been up to.  He was hardly ashamed.  Dean was a self-pronounced horn dog and Castiel’s vessel was stupid pretty.  Dean wasn’t one to judge how consenting adults chose to get off; screwing the angel didn’t evoke any strong moral issues for him.
Trusting that Cas wouldn’t give him anything potentially Leviathan tainted, he accepted the bottle.  They walked on for some time, the silence surprisingly easy.
“Is that right?” Dean asked as he walked back into the room.  He strode up to Cas and slid his wrist in front of the bound angel’s face.
No, they were actually glowing, Dean decided.  He was fairly certain that the Angel wasn’t doing it deliberately.  He was just that juiced.
Castiel allowed the contact, his omega easing a little at being marked.  He could handle himself alone, but omegas never really tolerated roving solo well.
Dean strode away from the other man back towards his people.  A moment later, he heard sounds behind him; apparently the male was coming with after all.  Goodie.  They walked together in silence.
“Let’s go,” he told the as yet unnamed omega shortly, turning and walking in the direction of the Winchester encampment.  His shoulder screamed at him from carrying the crate, but he’d be damned if he asked the rude bastard at his side for any favors.
“Lady Moon, Dean.  That was a particular brand of stupid,” Benny bemoaned dramatically.  “We need another defenseless omega to feed like a hole in the head.  We could really have used that powder.”
Dean looked up, and up, and up, gazing into the other man’s hairy nostrils.  Magog was a fucking giant, a mammoth of a man, his hairy chest slabbed with muscle.  He dwarfed Dean’s 6’2 height by at least a foot and a half, probably more.
“I heard you,” he agreed reluctantly.  “Every time you called out to me, I heard.  But I couldn’t find you.  I couldn’t help.”
“You recall when you first joined our pack?  Hell bent and determined on telling me exactly jack and shit about your past.  You were all about that blank slate.  And I agreed.  I just asked for one thing.  One.  Your past was your own.  All I needed was your promise that nothing you left behind would come back on the pack.”
“Sam,” Cas asked softly.  “Will Dean really be okay?  His behaviour didn’t appear to be merely the result of excessive alcohol ingestion.”
Dean lifted his hips, allowing the girls to pull his pants down and off, while Blondie the Lap Pillow unbuttoned his shirt, baring his chest.
Jo gave her mother a quick hug and stepped back.  ‘I need to go help with unloading the cargo boxes.”
“That we did,” Dean replied with a grin.  He leaned down to hug the petite Alpha.  “Not as good as when you are doing the wheeling-and-dealing, of course, but Sammy here did alright.”
(I wrote this at the same time as The New God and was never really sure what to do with it. Rather than leave an fully finished story to languish on my desktop, I'll stick it here and as a standalone.)
Impatient, Cas gave up on his zipper and burned the remainder of his clothing away, ignoring the way Dean chortled beneath him when he correctly deduced the source of the heat at his back.  “Something bothering you, angel?”  He asked slyly.  “You seem to be a little fluffed.”
Castiel glanced uncertainly at Naomi, who looked liked she’d just swallowed an entire orchard of lemons, but she didn’t object.  Shrugging, Gadreel took a seat on one of the two sideways crates a Winchester soldier and hastily supplied before fading back in with the other hunters.
“Given that you have more experience in this area, it may be best if you take the lead,” Cas told him cautiously.
Cas smiled, the expression lighting up his beautiful face.  Dean grinned back, a feral challenge that was more teeth than grin.  He released Cas’ wrist and twisted back to rest on his forearms on the bed.
Dean absently reached up and pressed his palm against the red handprint seared into the flesh of his shoulder.  He swore it pulsed beneath his fingers in response.
He was still standing there when the door swung open.  Leather and tobacco wrapped in honeysuckle.  Castiel wanted nothing more than to lick the other man from neck to thigh, see if he tasted half as delicious as he smelled.  He choked back the familiar impulse and dropped his gaze in a rare gesture of submission.
Cas hands took a firm grip, holding Dean’s head still so he could thrust into his mouth, setting a hard, rapid pace right from the jump.
Dean smelled so damn good.  He always had.  Not remotely like rut and sour sweat, the typical reek of the alphas he’d spent so much of his life evading.
Sam shrugged.  “I don’t think so. None that I can remember, anyway.”  In point of fact, he felt better well rested than usual.  He might actually have gotten a few hours of honest to god rest.
More unhappy grumbles filled the air, louder this time, some in support, but a great many others in disagreement, voicing complaining about lack of supplies and more mouths to feed.
The old pack Alpha wasn’t the toughest of fighters; but he was smart, and near- soulless in his decisions.  He wouldn’t put up a fighter, much less one of his two sons, creatively named Gog and Magog, if he didn’t think they would win this fight.
He knew he was neglecting the tightly wound balls he felt tap his chin with his deeper strokes, but he could only do so much multitasking at once.  He’d have to save that for next time.  And there would absolutely be a next time.  There was no way Dean wasn’t doing this again.  He’d just have to ensure Castiel survived his meeting with the ninja turtle angel.  Because now that he’d had a taste, Dean wasn’t stopping anytime soon.
There.  Done.  Itch officially scratched.  Now maybe he could get the haunting blue gaze of that freaking Castiel creature out of his head.
He was so convincing that Castiel might have actually believed him, had he not had factual evidence that Dean was completely, unequivocally, full of shit.
Startled, Dean jerked, more in surprise than in any need to move his body away from the contact.  If anything, he leaned forward into it.
“Do you need a hand?” A voice asked kindly from behind him.  A middle age human female smiled politely.  She wore a deep blue oversized sweater with a cat drinking coffee on it; a badge pinned to her shirt identified her as an employee of the library.
Dean was weaving where he sat, clearly seeing at least two copies of his opponent, maybe more.  Gadreel appeared rock steady, though his eyes were noticeably glassy and he was statue-still.
Dean hesitated.  “However.  There’s been a bit of a snafu.  Cas did do something to me.  Apparently his Alpha didn’t like being the only one out of his gourd.”
“I came to apologize.  I made assumptions, admittedly not without reason, and common knowledge suggests…”
Now that he had full maneuverability, he had a prize to claim.  Cas reached down, sliding his hand into Dean’s jeans, gripping his cock and massaging the erection.
Then their had father walked in.  He eyes his eldest son in thinly veiled warning.  “Never you mind that, son,” he’d told Sam.  “Just let Dean go get cleaned up and we can forget all about this unpleasant situation.”
“Hey, Jo. I got you. It’s okay, baby.  I promise ya, it’s all gonna be okay.”  Ellen wasn’t sure how in hell she was going to keep that promise, but she would find a way.
He knew his pack was tough; hell, he’d designed the training required of every member of the Winchester Clan.  Dean’s people were armed to the teeth, they were dangerous, and could damn well look after themselves.  And at least half the crew included in a ride was always upper echelon toughs.  No one in their right mind would fuck with a crew of Winchesters.
Castiel thought he’d understood the rules of designations.  Alphas ruled, bred, protected.  Betas were the soldiers.  They carried out alpha orders, performed day-to-day tasks, and had the liberty to choose alphas, other betas or omegas to take to mate, though producing offspring was less common.  Omegas handled the domestics; they bore pups, cooked, and cleaned.
Castiel was still deciding on whom he wanted to spend his time with into the next day.  He’d just finished preparing his morning coffee when a familiar scent wafted into his window on a soft breeze.
The pack was now light of their annual moonshine harvest by a good 60%, but they’d gotten so much more than they could have hoped for out of it.   And they could always trade what they’d gotten off the Halos for damn near anything at any of the border towns.  All in all, a solid win.
Dean’s struggling against Cas’ iron grip elicited the desired effect; Cas squeezed tighter, his movement’s becoming rougher.  Exactly the way the hunter wanted it.  The way Dean’s hips bucked powerfully against his, and his groan’s of pleasure, interposed with grunted demands for more, spurred him on to even greater lengths.
It didn’t take long until the shuddering settled.  Castiel wanted nothing more than to roll his omega over and take him, but he didn’t want the concrete floor to tear at Dean’s bare knees.  That would have to wait until they’d found a bed.  Or some softer flat surface, at least.
The blonde, Tanya, or was it Tasha, (who cared?), looked into his eyes, her fingers carting across his scalp.  “I’m not sure I agree.  I think that would definitely be something that would benefit the one individual.”
She glanced at Sam, every bit the hard eyed Alpha.  Anyone who mistook his caring nature as softness was very, very mistaken.  Sam was alpha through and through.  He was just a bit subtler than his brother.  She had a feeling the brothers played up their roles with deliberately.
Dean chuckled at the catty reply and reached down, tugging Cas’ pants down to his knees.  An unexpected twist, and Cas was flying, lying on his back on the nearest mattress.  Dean crawled over to him, high on his knees while he pulled off the angel’s shoes and pants, leaving him completely naked on the mattress.
Yanking Cas’ head off his erection, Dean pulled him up by the shoulders and half led half dragged him into the bedroom.
This was a good thing.  Any residual aggressive dominant pheromones that might have been riding the Alpha following his fight should now be safely out of his system, exhausted in some girl’s welcoming embrace.  Castiel should have been relieved.
Well, at least one of them could watch this scene without wishing to go blind, Sam decided.   He glanced to his left.  Rowena was gazing the same direction as Cas, her eyes glowing faintly with a witchy light.  Make that two.  Apparently she didn’t need binoculars to see from a distance.
“I’m sorry.  Did we give you the mistaken impression that you had a say in this decision?  In case you all forgot, this pack ain’t a democracy.  Anyone who disapproves step on up and explain to me the error of my ways.”  A faint red glow backlit his usual green.  No one took him up on his offer.
Dean followed Meg’s glance, eyes widening as he witnessed Castiel, former soldier of God, later the actual God, and leader of Heaven’s Rebellion II, try desperately to pretzel his body in such a way that he could manage to get his left hand on blue while successfully maintaining a reverse bridge.  In his defense, he managed it…for about 2 seconds before his poor vessel collapsed on the mat in a tangled heap of crazy-ward white and trench coat.
Dean was always careful to keep his darker nature firmly in check.  He harbored a monster inside; he could never afford to lose control.  But he was finally, finally letting his beast off the chain a little. Dean was desperately looking forward to this fight.  He scanned the rail of opponents, hoping he’d find a real challenge somewhere in the mess.
A slight tickle against his mind warned Cas that he was being sought again.  Called by one of only two people alive who knew him well enough to forge such a connection.  He ruthlessly blocked the anguished Prayer, shielding his mind against the heartbreakingly familiar voice.
“Never again,” Dean growled.  “If Michael gets free and takes me over again, he’s gonna be all kinds of pissed.  I can’t even imagine the next type of hell the sick bastard has been dreaming up for me.  If he ever takes over again, you need to stay the hell out of my head.   And if I somehow try and link to you, do not stay and share that crap.  Do you understand me?  There’s no reason for both of us to suffer!”
Whatever Dean read in Cas’ expression, it drained the languid heat from the other man’s expression faster than a bucket of ice water.  He leaned back, gaze becoming guarded, the previous openness hidden behind his familiar cool, emotionless mask.
Dean blinked, taken aback.  The omega had actually growled!  At an alpha.  And not just any alpha, one riding a killing high who had literally bled for the damn guy not minutes before.
“You’re the pack’s Alpha, Dean.  People will want, and deserve to celebrate.”  Dean scowled.  Reaching for the food plates, he started spooning himself another helping.
Sam hefted his bag and left the hotel, taking one reluctance glance back at the dented wall.  Dean was leaning against the Impala, patiently waiting when Sam finally emerged.  Also not a good sign.
Rowena smiled.  “Well, now.  That didn’t hurt, did it?  I said it twas a simple spell, and it generally is, but with all this iron…” She twitched her bound wrists, sighing theatrically.  “I’m afraid it’s a might more difficult, trying to manage a delicate spell under these circumstances.”  She held out the cuffs expectantly.
“You aren’t terrible at all,” Castiel said.  “Who you are, what you are, doesn’t scare me.  You’re the strongest, most honorable person I’ve ever met.”
The rest of the trip was much the same, until day three when the sky decided to mix things up by pouring rain down on them.   The soaked group gritted their teeth and kept moving.
It was strange how even Dean’s psychic screams were muffled, strangled by the sensation of water clogging his nose, his throat, filling his lungs and suffocating him with every breath.
“Say goodbye to your little beta harem,” Dean replied.  He raised a hand, running his palm possessively down Castiel’s arm.  “You’re mine, only mine.  Live here with me.  Help me lead the Pack.  Make this a safe place for our kid’s kids to grow up.”
Dean downed the rest of his beer in one gulp, desperately trying not to think.  It didn’t work.  He sighed, gazing longingly around the empty room for something, anything to hold his attention.  It was a fruitless endeavor; there wasn’t shit for distractions in the crappy motel room.  Sam was out, doing whatever the hell he did these days.  Dean had quit asking when all he got back was lies.
Cas reached up; taking a double handful of the most amazing ass he’d ever felt, massaging the muscles, silently encouraging Dean to fuck his mouth.  He slid one finger along the crack of Dean’s ass, pressing teasingly at the hole before sliding the digit in.  Over the last few days he’d had multiple opportunities to discover just how much Dean loved assplay.
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Jody is back guarding the trucks.  I pity anyone dumb enough to try to steal supplies from her.  Not to mention Jo.”
Cas’ hands slid out from Dean’s pants, falling to his sides.  “Dean?” Cas asked, his tone reverting back to his initial uncertainty.
In the face of such intense focus, Cas automatically took a step pack.  Dean took a step forward.  Feeling oddly hunted, Cas backed away again, jerking when he found himself backed into a wall.
“Here ya go,” Crowley’s man, well, woman in this case, said cheerfully, handing the end of the chain over to him.  “This one is all yours.  You made our boss a tidy sum, Winchester.  I’ve been instructed to let you take one of the crates of gunpowder with you, a gift to show our boss’ good will.”
“Is this right?” He asked, too innocently in Dean’s opinion.  Of course, the damn angel could count his pulse and blood pressure at sight, he’d know exactly much of an impact his touch was eliciting.
His heats tended to be more intense then an average omega’s, and he’d put this one off for too long.  He’d need to spend a long time getting caught up.  From where he lay, that sounded just about right.
True to Dean’s assertion, a large basket of fruit and meal bars, plus a full bottle of their best hooch that carried Ellen’s distinct scent, had appeared on the porch, the food staples smelling strongly of Sam. In addition, hot meals on covered trays were routinely dropped off.  Cas was always hungry, but given the option he’d choose sex every time.  It took cajoling and bribery on Dean’s part to make sure Cas got the necessary calories.  Not to mention an occasional dousing the omega in Dean's powerful shower.
Dean grinned faintly.  His brother really was awesome.  He tossed the kit into the nearest chair on his way out of the room.  He’d not be needing any of that.  But it was still a nice thought.
The bikes pulled up to the circle.  The rider of the trailered bike hopped off with an overly dramatic leg swing and stood.  He removed his helmet, revealing short cut blond hair, light blue eyes, and a saucy smile.
“Christ,” Dean rumbled.  “Have you ever heard of afterglow? Because you are seriously killing the mood, buddy.”
Dean continued his story smoothly, a satisfied gleam in his eyes.  “Once I was sure I had his undivided attention, I swallowed him whole, straight to the root, no warning.  The way he groaned, giving it all up for me, there’s nothing quite like that moment.  When you have complete control in how you want to make them feel, how much you choose to give, their orgasm is in your hands.  And ladies, there’s a reason they call it the ‘little death.”
It seemed like that would be callous on Sam’s part, but then Castiel didn’t always get the brother’s peculiar social interactions.  He’d come to the understanding that the Winchesters had a very strange way of showing love and accepted it.
Dean shook his head.  “Nope.  Maybe Cas could manage something, but I’d have to take the cuffs off so he could fully access his grace, and right now they’re the only things allowing him to keep what control he has left.   Good news though, I think the spell did its damage and dissipated.  I’m not picking up that twisted scent off him anymore.  Just good, old fashioned Alpha lust.”
“Omega,” Dean parroted back.  “No one goes wandering without a partner.  House rules.  This is a good place as any for a pit stop, but there’s hill folk in the area prone to kidnapping people if they think they can get away with it.  Sam and I are headed to the stream if that’s where you were going.  You can tag along.”
“I have a grown daughter.  She’s a beta and fine fighter.  I know she’s the Alpha’s kid, and understand that it may make for difficulties with integration of my pack into yours, but she’s part of the deal. It ain’t negotiable.”
“I’m fine,” Cas replied automatically.  Dean’s eyes narrowed.  “Really,” Cas amended, his tone more genuine.  “I’m doing okay.  This being human thing has a bit of a learning curve.”
The cock filling mouth throbbed as he slid his lips along the shaft, taking it slightly deeper with each glide until his nose was tapping pelvis.  His tongue slid along the under side, stroking the vein as he did a slow pull, backing away until he slid off entirely.
Brave man.  Or stupid.  Daisy may be pretty, but Bobby wouldn’t bed down with that she-hyena for a dragon’s nest worth of gold.
Castiel had been alive for a very, very long time.  Eons, possibly more. Time as a construct was fairly new, cosmically speaking.
He may be reclining, a figure of casual patience, but his firm erection gave away his interest in the proceedings.  Cas was drawn to it, felt the desire to touch the silky hardness.  So he did.  Dean hissed, eyes sliding shut while Cas stroked him.
Dean had power on his side and used it, employing his arm strength to assist his thighs in fast, powerful movements, slamming down onto Cas’ lap with each thrust, squeezing the muscles of that delightful ass to tighten that perfect seal around his dick.  Castiel felt himself approaching completion far sooner than expected, and he took Dean’s dick in hand, wanting his omega come with him.
A cheerful female with bright red hair was leading the class.  Ellen watched as she easily took down a large male she’d been demonstrating on.  The alpha didn’t appear to mind kissing dirt, instead asking to be shown again so he could try it.
The few people willing to discuss having that particular surgery called it the worst pain they’d ever endured, most strongly advocated for therapy afterward.  Those that chose the surgery were usually deeply damaged from bad relationships or childhood traumas.  Others had family trying to force them to take a mate not of their choosing and felt this was the only way out.  The individuals Sam profiled were a mixed bag, but they all had one thing in common.  At the root of all their reasoning, it came down to trying to protect their most vulnerable spot.
His mind flinched away at what it found there, and he jerked back into physical vision, eyes wide as he met Dean’s steady gaze.  “You don’t have a mating gland.”
“No, it’s way too late for that.  There’s nothing left to save.  I’m here to ask you to take what’s left of my people in.  Claim ‘em as yours.  Everyone knows Winchester’s protect their own.”
“Okay,” Sebastian began, taking a cautious sip of his steaming beverage.  “First things first.  I have to ask, are you asking with anyone particular in mind or are you just expanding your mind?”  He looked hopefully at Castiel.
How could he live under the same roof with the person he loved above all else, knowing he wasn’t loved back? That it was all a lie?
Castiel’s hips snapped against the blankets as he humped the bed in time with his eager mouth.  They would have time for finesse later.  Now he just needed them both to come, and he needed it now.
Dean swung the rider around, ignoring the outraged squeak and the heavy thud of the bike falling to the ground behind them.
Dean sighed.  “Funny you should ask.” Both brothers turned to look at the parked caravan where Castiel was standing, arms curled protectively around his core, looking around uncomfortably.
“It’s the principle of the thing,” Cas informed him, already feeling better now that he was getting a healthy dose of alpha pheromones.
“A bit,” Ellen replied with a sigh.  “Plus side, looks like Ash is gonna pull through. Touch and go, still, but he’s hanging in there.”
He watched Dean walk away.  The boy was right about one thing.  John had seen him necking in the bleachers, hardly a new thing for a horny teenager.  But he’d been gobsmacked when he realized Dean’s tonsil-hockey buddy had turned out to be another boy.
Dean poured him a glass of beer from one of the heavy growlers, raising an eyebrow at the double helping of food Cas was putting down.
Dean panted below him, sweat slicked and sated.  Cas released his lover’s wrists, healing the spattering of small, fingertip sized bruises.  As for the inner soreness, he let that be, knowing his lover enjoyed the lingering sensation of being marked.  Cas slid his hand along the length of silky, heated muscle and graceful curve of Dean’s lower back in an act of pure hedonism.  Dean was truly one of the most beautiful of all God’s creations.  For him, Castiel, one of the mightiest fighters in Heaven’s garrison, had irrevocably fallen.
Well, it was better than nothing.  At lease he was unique.  A familiar ache filled his body, his heat fully reasserting itself.  As lovely as the hand job was, it wasn’t nearly enough.
How dare she come out here in the middle of their pairing and try to make a claim on Dean’s time, like she had the right to it.  Dean was more than just some parade stud whose job it was to screw anyone in need of a fuck.
He coughed, attempting to clear out the last of the come and saliva he'd been swallowing as best he could.  “That was a helluva ride, buddy.  Didn’t see that one coming.”
“I put my lips on the tip, blew a little air on the sensitive skin there,” he shrugged, smiling wickedly, “I’m a bit of a tease.”
“Well, good for you.” Dean replied caustically.  “Did you stop by our place for directions or something?  Borrow a cup of sugar, maybe?”
Cas slid to his knees in a smooth, elegant motion.  Dean started talking the moment his tongue was freed; still denying, still trying to explain why this was a bad idea.  But his body was fully on board, at attention and ready.  Castiel put a hand on Dean’s cock, firmly massaging through the denim.   Dean’s words became gargled, devolving to a low, throaty groan.  Got him.
Castiel gets his first clue of what it is to be a Winchester.  A wild Jo makes another appearance.  Dean pulls a Dean, Sam is Sam, and merrily we move along.
Castiel was many things.  He was a fierce fighter, a loyal friend, a hard worker, one hell of a lover, and a pretty decent weaver, as it turned out.  Of the many things he was, a farmer was nowhere on the list.
Sam also recognized the lie, of course.  Dean’s younger brother knew the whole denial game by heart.  Sam was also astute enough to understand that Dean needed him to believe what he was telling them.  At least for the moment.  So he said the right things and made the appropriate noises.  Sam was a very patient hunter.
Cas felt a twinge of nervousness, even as he maneuvered so that he was actually lying with his head at the head of the bed.  Everything was new.  That didn’t necessarily make it bad, he reminded himself.  The last few moments had been definite examples that different could be very, very good.
Castiel didn’t bother to answer, tightening his core as the truck lurched into drive.  As soon as the trucks reached the paved path, the ride smoothed out considerably.  The truck must have amazing shocks.  The Pack must an excellent mechanic in their ranks.
For the life of her she couldn’t tell.  By right, it should be Dean as the oldest and toughest.  Sam was clearly a fighter, but even he couldn’t withstand an alpha Hunter’s Rages.
Cas blinked.  Earlier that morning, they’d both decided that Castiel was well past the worst of it and it was safe to remove his restraints.  Without the cuffs, he had full access to his tattered grace.  He couldn’t do much, but delving was simple enough.  He turned his gaze inward, seeking to find what Dean was speaking of.
Not that it mattered.  She had no chance against those beasts. They’d kill every one they didn’t have a use for, the alphas, the kids.  They’d steal the omegas and use ‘em up.   She couldn’t stop them.  They were fierce.  No one would come to her aid against them, not that she had money or goods to pay for fighters.
“Well, let’s start at the top.  That’s Dean, by the way.  He’s usually available and always amenable.”
The door slammed behind them and Cas spun in Dean’s arms, pressing his erection into Dean’s hip and grinding just this side of painful.  Dean growled, one hand cupping the back of Cas’ head, pulling him in for a kiss.  An agile tongue slid between Castiel’s lips, demanding he open for his alpha.
Cas was apparently very in tune to Dean’s physical reactions at the moment.  “That looks uncomfortable,” he commented, the hint of a smile in his tone as his eyes focused on the painfully hard erection tenting up through Dean's open jeans.
Sam hefted his bag and left the hotel, taking one reluctance glance back at the dented wall.  Dean was leaning against the Impala, patiently waiting when Sam finally emerged.  Also not a good sign.
Castiel also realized that there would be nothing to be gained by telling him.  Dean carried enough guilt; if he knew that he’d dragged Castiel into Michael’s torture with him, even for a few short moments in time, he’d never forgive himself.
The taller of the two strode right up to her, and before she could even gather some form of defense, muscular arms came around her, pulling her in to a tight embrace.
Behind him, his people stared on, silent as stone.  Naomi watched the drinking contest impassively, her blue eyes bright with a hawkish glare.
Jo stood, giving his shoulder a gentle punch.  “Good night, then.  It’s okay to sleep.  The big guys are camped out by the main road, so nothing’s gonna make it to us alive from the south.  And we have sentries posted at each corner of the camp.  We wake early and move fast, so try to rest.”
Cas didn’t stand a chance in heaven or hell of hanging on.  He came with a groan, mind going briefly fuzzy and grey.
If that was what Dean wanted, needed, to redress the balance between them, Castiel would yield.  He refused to acknowledge the part of him that devoutly hoped that was exactly what Dean would demand.
The other man’s grip tightened on his, no more teasing, nothing but firm strokes intended to take him over the edge.  It didn’t take much.  One more, another, a third, and Dean was coming.  His climax ripped through him, sparks exploding behind his eyelids.  He may have briefly passed out.
He was long past chills and pain, the heat urges more than satisfied with the overwhelming rush of alpha pheromones and the most intense pummeling he’d ever felt.  He’d been with alpha’s of Dean’s length before, and his width, but the combination of the two was like nothing he’d every experienced.  His ass would never be the same.  So. Fucking. Worth. It.
He narrowed his gaze, waiting as those around him ducked their heads, averting gazes in deference to their Alpha.  “The death of our father left a hole in this pack, one my brother and I have both strived to fill.”  Lots of voices called out at that, quick to call support to their Alpha pair.
Since seeing Dean spin and flee from him back in their bedroom, all Castiel could think about that lovely ass.  He wanted to taste it.
But Dean had a reputation to maintain; giving that lovely young lady anything but his absolute best was unacceptable.  Currently, his dick and his ribs were engaged in a heated argument over who was ultimately right in that decision.  Ow.
Dean growled low, a deep, ominous sound that originated at the base of his chest and rumbled to the surface. The folk closest around him eyed him uneasily, several deciding to strategically step away from his immediate vicinity.  Smart of them.  Dean was in no mood for bullshit.
Castiel stared at the tense, angry lines of the Alpha’s shoulders as he drove the jeep.  He was beautiful all the time, and when he was angry he was magnificent.  But he wasn’t a particularly forgiving person when he felt his Pack was put at risk.
Dean walked into the map room.  He leaned heavily against the wall, arms crossed across his chest.  He looked awful.  Sam wasn’t sure what he’d expected from his brother, probably something cocky or sarcastic, but not this.
Despite the warm greeting, he didn’t go in for a hug the way Sam had, keeping a few feet between them.   She looked into his eyes, hiding a flinch at the darkness lurking behind that beautiful gaze.  A faint sheen rolled over his eyes, feral and wild, a promise of impending violence, swift and without warning.
A lean, fit female alpha stepped forward, removing her helmet.  She had short-cropped blonde hair framing a stern face with cornflower blue eyes and pixie features.
The hand at Dean’s crotch disappeared, moving away only long enough to unbutton his pants, sliding down the zipper and pulling the fabric down to pool at his ankles.
Sam closed the door softly behind him.  He caught up with his brother in the map room on the way to the garage.  Just as well.
Magog charged again, narrowly missing as Dean gracefully spun and ducked away.  The force of the charge, coupled with the damaged knee, sent the giant sliding to the ground on his stomach.  He pounded the ground in rage, rising up to his feet.
“All I’m saying is that, done properly, it can be good for everyone involved,” Dean told them casually.
Dean didn’t believe a word the angel said, but in all truthfulness, it didn’t matter all that much to him.  He was too broken to trust, too tired and disillusioned to care.
Dean resisted, trying to lean back against the car to block the dropping of trouser.  Of course, diverting a determined Castiel had rarely been a successful endeavor in any circumstance.  Now proved no exception.  He was more than strong enough to keep Dean’s hips away from the car.
A hand gripped Cas’ achingly painful, abused balls, stroking rhythmically. Cas screamed hoarsely, the tender, too gentle contact a special torture all its own.  It was more than he could bear.  His scream lacked the volume he’d started with; he’d gone slowly hoarse over time.
“Sammy, keep looking for that damn ginger witch.  I’m going to the dungeon to get a second set of spelled cuffs.  Hopefully they can keep Cas’ strength in check.”  Dean rose, striding away down the hall.
His body vibrating with a deep-chested purr, Dean obliged, adding a sharp nip of teeth, followed by a wide lap against the abused nub.
Cas filled a second mug with coffee, snagged a blanket, and stepped out into the chilly morning air.  He silently handed the alpha the steaming cup and took a seat on the stairs next to him.  Dean accepted the coffee with a nod of thanks.
When Dean made no indication of displeasure, Cas hesitantly guided Dean’s head up his shaft.  Dean made a sound of encouragement, letting his tongue snake wickedly against the head.  There was no way the little virgin angel was about to…
Dean decided to allow Cas to divert their discussion.  This new topic was so much easier than that heavy shit.  He groaned and rolled over, letting his full weight settle on top of the other male.  He knew Cas was more than capable of bearing it.
It was too late to prevent it from happening in the first place; John didn’t own a time machine.  All that was left to him was damage control.  The first thing he did was hunt down the rat bastard and put a bullet between his eyes.  It wasn’t the first time he’d had to kill a human, and it wouldn’t be the last.  But it was the first time he’d done it without a shred of regret.
“So, boyfriend, huh?  Of course you’d be taken.  Can’t blame a guy for wondering.”  Sebastian winked.
“There’s nothing there.  It’s just a mass off scar tissue and healed muscle.  Dean.  What happened?”
Gazing down at the peaceful alpha, Castiel realized his greatest fear had been realized.  Now that he’d gotten a piece of the man, he never wanted to let go.  And Dean had never been his to keep.
“You don’t have a picture of your intended, by any chance.  Not to be nosy or anything, but I totally am.”
The weapons were forged with such perfect balance and heft that his people called them Angel made.  The weapons were sacred, each Halo getting exactly one when they left the Silver City to venture out into the world.  There was only one way Dean could have acquired them.  Halos would die before they sold or traded the precious weapons away.
“Sam’s doing research,” Dean said, in response to Cas’ obvious confusion.  He shuddered dramatically  “I’d prefer to miss as much of that as possible.”
Sorrow filtered through him. Dean never leaned away from him, even after all the horrible acts Castiel had inflicted on his friend over the years.
The motel room was identical to any of the dozens Castiel had manifested into while working with Sam and Dean over the years.  It was plain, the wall paper a completely inappropriate colour to compliment the inexpensive furniture.  Still, it smelled relatively clean.  And it was gloriously private.
Bobby watched the pair walk away before sliding back into the car seat.  He continued to watch through the side mirror as they stowed their bags in the boot of the car.  Emmanuel hopped into the passenger seat and they were gone.
Castiel had thought he was sure.  But with that one minor demonstration he knew with certainty that it was actually the exact opposite.  His reaction to a scenting alone fiercely tested his waning control.  If he was unbound, and a willing Dean stood before him… there would be no stopping his urges.
Sam didn’t have to wait long.  Shortly after the promised two-hour mark, his senses gently whispered the arrival of a familiar presence.  The mild breeze brought him the faint, watered down scent of sweaty, spent alpha male moments before Dean appeared over the hill.  Sam’s brother was soaked to the skin and looked incredibly pleased with himself.
Castiel considered that.  A feral Dean Winchester pouncing on him, working all that wild aggression out on his body in a rush of unbridled, animalistic sex.  He wasn’t sure whether he was intruiged or nervous.  Maybe both.
“No.  Never again.  You’re a Winchester, Dean.  You will act like it.  Winchesters do not do that.  No son of mine pulls that shit, do you understand me?”
Dean hopped the fence, ignoring the way his shoulder screamed and his ribs burned.  Maybe he’d managed to crack one or two, after all.  No matter, a good taping up and he’d be golden.
“I…I have no idea,” Cas stuttered.  “I’m sorry? It was an accident.  I don’t know what came over me?”
Without conscious thought, Castiel lunged forward and savagely bit into Dean’s mating gland, claiming the Alpha as his own.  Joy and pride, satisfaction and pleasure, saturated his body as he reveled in his prize.  Then he tasted blood on his tongue and the wall of reality came crashing down, clearing the possessive fog from his mind.  His eyes flew open with a horrified realization.
Dean stood; wiping his hands clean of pie crumbs.  “Okay, then.  Let’s make it official.  Why don’t you go with Sam to his house, he’s got an adorable little office set up.”  Sam glared at his brother, gracing him with a very specific finger.
He’d never, ever, wanted to hurt his friend and occasional lover, but as Cas was only now understanding, there wasn’t really anything Dean could have done to prevent it.  It’s not like Dean would have had the opportunity to cut himself and fashion a Banishment sigil in this situation.
Now he just had to move.  That was all.  Open the door, walk inside, and announce his request to further his sexual education.  Dean had told him he was invited, after all.
The cuff’s energy flared back at him, smashing against his power with all the force of a brick wall.  Cas grunted, stunned, and fell to his back.   Cas eyes sparked a few times as his aborted attempt to reach his grace died away.
“Your pulse is currently 89, significantly higher than your baseline resting rate average of 64,” Cas replied.
She grinned, her smile lighting up an already lovely face.  “Odd name.  Welcome to the Winchester Pack, Castiel.”
Cas had been on the landing, patiently waiting, only to leap over the rail right as Dean passed under the balcony.  Clever hunter.  Dean’s omega thrummed in approval.  But Dean wasn’t going to make it easy for the Angel.  Abandoning stealth, he took off at a dead run, pelting down the familiar hallway towards the control room.
Which was nice and all, but they didn’t know the whole story.  Castiel was still waiting to hear from the one person who’d paid the price for his choices.  The person in his life who mattered most to him.  And who was leaning against the weapons locker, watching him.
“Head’s up,” Sam looked up just in time to see the Impala’s keys flying at his head.  He snapped them out of the air before they pinged him in the face.
Castiel reached across the bed, relieved when Dean didn’t so much as blink as he gently settled his two forefingers against his friend’s forehead.  Power came at his call, cool and smooth as he eased all the hunter’s aches.  The Alpha in him, down but not quite out, bucked mildly at the action, protesting as Castiel cleared Dean’s skin, erasing the last several days’ worth of marks.  Dean was HIS; the omega should proudly wear the bites proving his claim.
Bobby sighed.  That termite infested old pit of a house had been the last reminder of his old life.  Losing that, it was the final nails in the coffin.  He’d thought burying his wife the second time, after killing her of course, had put paid to all that emotional crap.  Apparently not so much.
One life for her entire pack.  It was more than fair.  And Ellen would give her own life ten times over if it meant she wouldn’t have to watch her daughter die.
Namoi stared down at the unconscious body of one her most elite soldiers.  She looked up to meet Dean Winchester’s uncompromising, if somewhat glassy-eyed, stare.
Castiel had spent his life worrying about being claimed against his will by some monstrous Alpha.  But he’d never heard of it happening in reverse.  Trust it to him to be a freak even in this.
Cas looked Sam in the eye, an unusual ability for an omega, but he’d never been normal.  “I bit Dean without his consent.  And my life should be forfeit.  But it’s done, and my death would only traumatize my mate.  Similarly, leaving would do no good.”  He looked to his mate, seeing the resolution in Dean’s steady gaze.  If Cas left, Dean would follow.  Selfishly, Cas was relieved.  He really didn’t want to leave the Winchester pack.  This was his home.
He downed the rest of his shitty coffee, catching a whiff of new aggression somewhere off to his left.  Fucking hell, couldn’t they get through a single morning without someone starting some shit?  He was so not in the mood.
“Honey, I think we woke the neighbors,” he muttered languidly.  He sounded smug.  And so very happy that Castiel couldn’t even call him on it.  Or maybe he was too sexed out to bother.  But one thing definitely needed addressing.
“I didn’t mean to do it.  I…wasn’t thinking.  At all,” Castiel told him, desperate that his Alpha, his friend, know he’d never deliberately…but then he kind of had.
He took a second to rub his face in Dean’s groin, inhaling deeply.  Dean groaned above him, placing one knee on the bed for support.
Daisy-Ann was about as ruthless a hunter as he’d ever come across.  Five foot nothing, with warm, innocent brown eyes and a guileless smile, you never saw her coming until you had a knife pokin’ out from your gullet.  He still had memories of clearing out a couple of vamps with her, when he’d finally seen her genuine smile for the first time.  It wasn’t something a man just forgot.
Sam narrowed his eyes and growled right back.  “Chill.  I have no intention of trying to poach and you know it.”
“We need to call Sam.  And Ellen,” Cas said quietly.  “I’ll tell them exactly what happened.  It was a horrible, unforgivable mistake.  I acknowledge that.”
He nodded to the pack sentry who’d risen from her crouched place to watch him stride down to the road.  At Dean’s casual wave, she sent a dirty gesture his way before melting back into the brush.
They were at the outskirts of town when a petite female came flying at them. “Dean!  I heard you fought a monster in the Ring! Are you okay?”
Dean stepped up, sliding his body between Castiel and Naomi.  “There ya have it.  He’s ours and we’re keeping him.  House rules.
A soft brush of fabric at his side.  Sam shifted in annoyance, causing the busted old Chevy truck he was currently sitting atop to groan in metallic protest.  He was legitimately surprised the antiquated car had managed to support all his weight without falling to pieces.  The old tailgate appeared to be held together by rust, grit and a prayer.
With a momentous amount of willpower that he should get a goddamn medal for, Dean stepped back, away from the perfect frottage he’d been enjoying.
“Please, Dean.  I’m asking you.  Give me the knife?”  Time froze as the a silent contest of wills dragged on.  And then something gave.  Sam sighed heavily in relief when Dean reluctantly loosened his grip, allowing his brother to take it from his shaking hand.
The map table was very flat.  The idea of putting Dean on his back on that table, holding his legs high overhead and having him was too compelling to disregard.  They’d definitely get that later.  But for now, his dick was painfully hard and needed attention.
When Castiel had finally lost the battle with his raging curiosity and asked about it, the alpha had just shrugged and said ‘Garth has mad skills.’
“That sounds…uncomfortable,” Cas replied cautiously.  It wasn’t the word he wanted to use.  Monstrous, torture, those were closer.
‘’This ain’t the first time I’ve scrapped with your kind,” Dean told him.  “A while ago, when the pack was still fairly small and dad was running the show, a pair of your buddies came sniffing.”
“One of our border guards,” the man next to Castiel yelled to him over the noise from the wind and engines.  “She’s a bit of a show off, that one.  But at least now we can anticipate a warm welcome.”
“Silver City?”  Sam asked, monitoring as most of his people fanned out, while others who weren’t going to be spending the night in the field made their way back to camp.
“No reason at all,” Ellen told her.  “Dean is just being his usual charming self.  I need to go back to what I was doing.” She looked over at the brothers.  “Find me once you’ve gotten settled in, would you?  I’d like to review the list of new supplies and there’s a little nomadic pack squatting just outside the northwestern edge of our territory that I need to tell you about.”
Dean sat up, stretching muscles no longer sore from exertion and repeated slamming into hard, unrelieving surfaces.
Dean raised an eyebrow at that.  Fang? Now that was an interesting development.  His inner alpha rose eagerly at the thought of a worthy fighter, craving blood under his fists.  Fang was a bunch of feral beasts, the lot of ‘em.  Just like him.
A myriad of guns and blades were neatly tacked along the wall, as well as metal boxes of bullets arranged by caliber on the counter top.  Cas ran his fingertips reverently over an ancient looking battle tomahawk, then looked at the next display.  He stilled.  The bottom left of the board held a pair of crossed Halo knives.
Castiel screamed as pain and pleasure rocked through him, ripping the most intense orgasm he’d ever experienced out of his body.  He was distantly aware of Dean’s rumbling roar as his cock pulsed inside him, slamming his knot home and feeling it catch, but he was too wiped to care.
Dean strode out from the tree line looking as wrung-out as Sam felt.   His older brother didn’t say anything, but came to the edge of the steps and leaned against the sturdy railing.
Meg leaned back, smiling fondly.  “Yummy.  That man is one hell of a lover.  He’s a genuine pleaser, takes his time figuring out what makes his partner scream.  Stamina for days, crazy creative.  And he’s a real two-hander, if you get my meaning.  Hung like a damn stallion.  And that personal scent of his is almost as delicious as yours, angel cake.”
Half of the bikers behind Naomi dismounted as one, the single move disturbing in its perfect choreography. That was one of the most tightly kept Halo pack secret.  Along with a lifetime of learning fighting with their blades, Halos trained from the cradle to read a form of micro body language, giving them perfect symmetry of motion to the point it looked nearly telepathic.  Naomi’s ability to nearly invisibly direct the squad of soldiers was one of several skill sets that made her an incredibly lethal opponentl.
Not sure how I feel about this section.  But I really dig how the story ended, so I'll keep plugging on.  Oh, and there's an origin story chapter coming up, which I really like but it may or may not make any sense.  Cheers!
“Do it,” Dean ordered, his voice completely lost to his alpha.  “Come for me, my mate.  Let me have it.  Now, Cas!”
Groans filled the ring at his pronouncement.  “You heard the man,” Crowley announced.  “My lads will be coming along directly to collect any wagers due me.”
Dean clearly cared very, very much.  He buried his face into Cas’ ass with gusto, licking him like he was Dean’s favorite flavor of ice cream.  The deep rumbles of pleasure suggested he was enjoying this every bit as much as Castiel.  A swipe across his hole with the flat of Dean’s tongue and the omega gave up on thinking and gave into sensation.
She leaned up on her toes and murmured something to Emmanuel who smiled and followed her out to their car.  He didn’t look back.
Cas reached up, taking hold of his own legs, helping Dean keep him bent over.  The move was a particular act of genius on his part as it allowed Dean to let go with one hand and wrap it around Cas’ cock, his hand wet with slick and precum.  He jerked Cas off in quick, rapid strokes in jarring counterpoint to his thrusts.
“Alright, featherhead.  Let’s do this; show me what you’ve got.”  Dean dug his fingers deep into the hay, clutching tight.  He didn’t resist when Cas hauled him to his knees, took his hips in vice-strong grip and proceeded to do his very best his to pound the hell out of him.  Dean huffed out a rough laugh, delighted when the taunting sound only seemed to spur the angel on to even greater efforts.  He’d worked for this ride, damnit, and he was going to enjoy every aching minute.
Open chuckles at that.  Anyone who’d had more than a passing conversation with Dean knew the alpha was hardly the dumb thug he so often played at, but Sam was a legitimate genius.
“We got the dumb brawn covered,” Dean told them, grinning as he jerked a thumb in his oversized brother’s direction.  Sam grinned, shaking his head.   “And I think we call all agree I’m the brains of this outfit.”
Dean’s eyes flicked opened.  His body stiffened, head cocked to he side as he listened, gazing towards the front door warily.
“I don’t know exactly how much influence I have on him,” Cas told Sam honestly.  “But I know that I love him.  And I know, and can almost believe, that he loves me too.”
He looked up as the next customer came to his queue, his hand subconsciously clenching tight around the little price scanner.  He was here; again.
And now the man had just accused him of being a rapist.  Dean hadn’t done a damn thing to the omega.  Not even a little harmless scenting, though it was more than clear from the luscious scent wafting off him that the man was close to his heat.
Dean muttered darkly to himself and reached for the covered plate of pie.  Satisfied that they’d gone through their first understanding as a mated pair, Castiel followed Sam out the door.
“Lips at his neck, tracking hotspots like x’s on a pirate’s map.  The neck’s a hot spot for most everyone, have you noticed?”  Brunette moaned a soft whimper as Dean’s fingers ventured further up her inner thigh.
He snuck a glance around the raised trunk lid, noting the way Dean’s shoulders stiffened at the question.
Cas dropped his head to the mattress, pillowing his forehead on his arms and canting his ass higher in invitation.
Cas knew without doubt what Dean would want him to do were he sufficiently cognizant to understand the choice Cas had before him.  So Castiel did what his hunter would ask of him; he abandoned Dean, leaving him to bear his torment alone.
Dean wanted to shove Cas away, the pain of old, enduring rage rising.  He raised his arms to do just that.  But his arms didn’t obey his command.  Instead, they wrapped gently around his angel, tugging him tight against his body as he opened his mouth, deepening their kiss.
Emmanuel looked so peaceful; unburdened by the metric load of crap he'd been dealt the past few years.  Bobby knew the world would come along bristling with pins to burst that particular bubble sooner or later.  Call him an old sentimental, but he felt like the man should have at least a measure of peace while he could.
What would be the advantage of bringing attention to this situation, anyway?  It took Death to build a wall in Sam’s mind.  Bobby doubted the angel was likely able to do so without his Purgatory super strength or he would have done it back at the old warehouse.
Dean spun around, tugging Castiel with him towards the back door of the house.  Cas came along readily, completely on board with this plan.  On some level, he knew Sam had very valid concerns that needed addressing, but at the moment, he had a gorgeous mate sliding a sneaky hand to his caress his butt as they walked and Castiel found he had much more urgent concerns on his plate than Sam’s issues.  Namely, getting Dean’s cock in his ass as soon as physically possible.
Cas appeared, walking calmly beside him as if he’d been there all along.  He might have been, for all Dean knew.  There wasn’t much method to Cas’ madness these days.  He handed Dean a beer, one of Dean’s preferred brands.  He was quite sure they didn’t have any in the cabin.  Or the state, for that matter.  Eh.  Gift horses.
Dean grinned as the lone figure stealthily approached. Looks like Sam’s belongings were safe.  Tonight, anyway.  Definite rain check on that, though.  Dean had plans for his brother’s toothbrush.
The two climbed into the jeep, waiting for the back seat to fill with other people hoping to catch a ride back.
“Yeah, well.  Mike wore himself out earlier and I was able to sneak in a solid two hours of quality shut-eye before he got his second wind.  I’m up for the rest of the night, now,” Dean replied gesturing dismissively with one hand, as if that was perfectly normal.  For him, it probably was.
But whatever he was doing, it was at least slowing things down, giving Dean’s giant-sized little brother a desperately needed respite. Cas probably thought he was being generous in helping Sam.  Rewarding his favorite pet’s good behavior, or whatever bullshit the Uber-Angel felt like spewing in the moment.  It would go easier on him if Dean could keep his damn mouth shut, but that just wasn’t his way.
“You mean when you finally told us he kept you drowning?” Castiel clarified, definitely uneasy about where this line of questioning was headed.
Castiel keenly remembered the first time Dean’s mind reached for him after Michael stole him away.  He could never forget that moment when Dean’s struggles became so desperate that his screams turned into a Call.
Oh, Castiel was going to do something alright.  He spun Dean around, pinning him against the wall with his hips.  He switched to hold both of Dean’s wrists in one hand so he could undo his jeans, the loose pants falling to ground.
Dean groaned.  “I have ideas.  But I’m not sure you’re up for ‘em.”  His gaze turned serious.  “It may be different for you, now.”
Murmurs of anger briefly filled the group.  “Dean and I talked the matter over.  We’re adopting what’s left of her people into the Winchester pack.”
What it was was a death sentence.  Castiel had staked a mating claim, and he’d done so without consent, or permission.  It was the gravest violation of a person, his greatest fear.  And he’d just done it to Dean.
An instant later and he was shoving his dick back inside Castiel's body, slamming his hips till they were snug against his balls.  Cas screamed as the rough intrusion filled him to the brink of his tolerance and past.
Rowena smiled, dropped the angel hair into her tea, and spoke a few ancient words that may or may not have had a common ancestor with Latin.  The cola coloured liquid began to glow, moving around the cup in gentle, sparkly golden swirls.  A mist of iridescent purple sparked up from the cup, spinning in lazy circles, a mini whirlpool of tea leaves and glitter.
Dean’s eyes bore into his, gaze haunted.  “Then why won’t you be mine?  I can’t stand the idea of watching you die, Cas.  You’ll take a piece of me with you.”
He sucked in a breath, taking in the full picture of a beautiful man kneeling between his legs doing his utmost to suck him dry.  Cas had picked up that particular trick from Dean, though that new thing he was doing with his tongue…Dean groaned, yeah, that move was all Cas.  How the hell had he managed to press his tongue at the underside of Dean’s cock and lick upward without sacrificing an ounce of that perfect suction?
“You get to change your mind, you know,” Dean reminded him, eyes intent.  His hands left Cas’ face as he began to pull at clothes, tugging off Cas’ shirt, carelessly snapping the buttons.  “That’s always up to you, no matter what we’re doing.”
Dean groaned at the bite, his body shuddering.   Cas pressed his naked body tightly against Dean’s back, pinning him in place.  His wrists were still cuffed together, but somewhere along the way, he’d managed to get rid of the chain entirely.
Maybe Dean shouldn’t have called him a shitty lay.  But he’d been hurting, on several different levels, and pain always drove him say things he probably shouldn’t.  No matter, he’d heal up in a day or two.  There had only been a little blood, and after a hot shower and a couple of Tylenol, the throbbing had receded to more of a dull ache.
When he’d first laid eyes on the thing that they’d summoned, the Angel, he’d sworn he felt a familiar energy rolling around in his flesh just beneath the brand.  And when he’d finally appeared before them, Dean had felt the truth of it all.  Submerged beneath all the sparks and fancy winged shadow-puppet show, Dean had known with instinctive and absolute certainty that the mark on his shoulder belonged to this being.
The newly combined pack thrived under its triumvirate.  It was Ellen who provided the secret recipe to Hunter’s Helper, and she and Dean dedicated years to perfecting the pack's trademark moonshine.
She could have been that into his story, or maybe it was how his thumb rhythmically rubbing against the soft, warm edges guarding the way to her promised land.   No panties, which simplified things.  Dean liked easy.
Both Sam and Cas were staring at him expectantly.  Dean sighed.  “All I can tell you is something within you Cas, it escalated the relatively gentle A in Jimmy.  I don’t know if it’s the spell doing something, or just you.  Regardless, you’re kicking out Apex Alpha pheromones like a furnace.  I don’t get how you’re even keeping it together as well as you are.   Any other Alpha would be dry humping the chair leg about now.”
“Cas?” Sam asked.  “You okay? Cuz we still need to figure out how to catch Dean so I can turn him back.”
Every hair in Cas' body stood up at attention.  Mother moon, he wanted Dean.  Wanted to be held down and taken, fucked until he was too sore, too sated, to move.  And then he wanted to do it all over again.  But more than sex, more than heats, he wanted Dean’s bite, craved it.  That last thought was deluge of ice water directly onto his libido.
Dean laughed, the sound choked off when Cas shoved his tongue into the other man’s mouth, the kiss messy and rough.  Just the way they both liked it.
“That’s it!  No point in finding the dead if it costs us the living.   Everyone get on outta there.”  The salvage efforts paused, three of the five people obediently turning and carefully making their way out.  The remaining two gave her matching mutinous stares.
“Yeah, well.  This is hardly the first time someone in this family did something they regret under the impulse of a spell.  Dean understands.”
“That’s just swell, Cas.  Good for you.  Take a vacation from all the smiting.  I hear Maui is nice this time of year,” Dean told him.  “Have a mai tai or ten.”
Magog pulled himself upright, turning around just in time to see the blade Dean had scooped from the ground flying at his face.  Before the giant of a man could react, Dean struck, the blade neatly separating the giant’s head from his shoulders, sending it rolling across the dirt ring.
Fortunately, they were nearly done and inside an hour, Persephone would be a pile of stinking dust in their review mirror.   Dean glanced over to where Jody and their new omega sat chatting.  Jo said he’d finally coughed up a name.
Castiel was resting on his porch when he smelled a familiar scent approaching.  It took a moment for his mind to filter this one through all the new scents he'd taken in.
Dean leaned down, taking Cas’ lips in a deep, claiming kiss.  His hips slid smoothly against Castiel’s in a delicious frottage.  Excellent.  He was already hard again.
Bobby tried one more time.  “Hey,” he said, reaching out to grab the other man’s arm.  “I don’t mean to intrude, but you look awful familiar.  Have we met somewhere before?”
“Wait, you were having sex?  For three days?” Then it had clicked.  “Wait, it wasn’t just sex, was it?  You’re one of them, aren’t you?  You have a secondary nature.  Is that why you had to go away?  Were you in rut?!”
Castiel lost track of how many days they’d been screwing.  He had to hand it to Dean; the alpha had no trouble keeping up with him.  The man’s stamina was damn near limitless.  No wonder the other people he’d been with tended to respond with a dreamy smile whenever it came up.
Slowly, teasingly, Dean angled the device until he was able to slide it into Cas’ ass, even bound flat as he was. It was a small toy, slim. It fit easily, only a little snug in his unprepared hole.  The vibrations were a new kind of agony, the toy short enough that it cheerfully buzzed just below his prostate.  Another fucking tease.
And as long as Dean didn’t actually say ‘no,’ he’d never have to find out whether or not Castiel would honor it.
The dude had literally died for them.  The least Dean could do was help a buddy out.  That excuse was so flimsy he could use it as a Frisbee, but he made the conscious decision not to overthink it.
“I was on my way to warn you.  Marauders to the south.  Lots of them.”  Asa hesitated.  “They’re Black Eyes.”
“What?  You think it takes me 15 minutes to grab a set of cuffs?” Dean asked, tracking Cas' gaze.  “I took a few minutes to make some adjustments to my room’s decor.”
Castiel frowned.  “I assure you, sex alone would not cause that.  But if it would make you feel more secure, I can tell you that he gave me a very thorough blow job against that car a month ago and the world did not deviate from its course.”
Most of the towns had some degree of organization or guardianship.  But Persephone was a whole other kettle of fish.  It was a law unto itself, generally the law of survival of the fittest.  And because Dean’s pack were the type of people they were, the town’s risky nature only made them want to come along all the more.
“Tell me you want it,” Dean murmured, rough voice husky with lust.  It took nearly everything Cas had to stay silent.
Castiel kicked at his omega’s ankles to spread them, deciding he liked them staying bound by the pants.  He pressed one hand firmly between Dean’s shoulder blades, forcing him against the wall.  “Stay,” he told him firmly.
Castiel raised an eyebrow.  Blowjobs were happening, no matter what.  But a challenge had been issued.  And Castiel hated to lose.
Castiel sat on the porch steps of his assigned house, gazing up at a star filled sky.  He was beyond exhausted both physically and mentally, but sleep eluded him.
“I wasn’t hunting, Sammy,” Dean had replied shortly.  “I just, had to take care of a few things.”  As he’d walked by, Sam had caught the familiar odor of old sweat that meant his brother had gotten laid.
Deciding he needed something, anything else to do, Sam left the other two to play voyeur and went to the passenger side of the truck to check his supplies.  Opening the cooler, he checked on the half dozen bags of ‘O’ neg blood nestled securely under a thick bed of ice, a number of rosaries bobbing around in the icy water.  Next to the cooler, a Trader Joe’s bag held several dozen syringes and a set of the dungeon’s super-spelled cuffs.   Sam pulled out the cuffs and returned to the tailgate.
On some sane level, Cas was aware that Dean was planning damage control, and that he’d sent the other omega firmly away.  But none of that made it through the fog of sudden, overwhelmingly possessive rage.
He felt his eyes tearing up at the bruising pace, and he had to swallow continuously in an attempt to keep all the saliva at bay.  As it was, he felt it dripping down his chin and knew he looked a mess.  Apparently, Cas was into messes, because he thrusts only picked up speed.
Dean spent another twenty minutes wandering aimlessly through the halls.  Even knowing what he was up to, and clearly in agreement with the plan, twenty minutes was all the time his omega was willing to spend away from his Alpha.
“I didn’t ‘sneak in’, I flew in.  But yes, that’s what I’m referring to.  What I did to you that night, Dean…”
Ellen Harvelle has the ruined remains of a roadhouse, a few dozen broken packmates, one very spry beta daughter, and not much else.  Well, that and some freaking amazing moonshine.  The weary Alpha has one play left to save what's left of her pack.
Dean gave one last, longing look at the four glorious boxes of gunpowder.  Life just wasn’t fair.  “I’ll take the omega,” he announced with a sigh.
Dean laughed.  “Anywhere you want to, darlin’.”  His smile was warm and inviting, specifically designed to put the newbie at ease.  “There’s no wrong here; this is supposed to be fun.”
Dean stalked toward him, placing his palms on the wall at either side of Cas’ head, boxing him in.  Castiel had always known Dean was strong, but it had never affected him with the immediacy of their current position.  He swallowed back nerves, the unfamiliar bitter copper taste of adrenaline a coating his tongue.  He found himself leaning back as far into the wall as the unforgiving plaster allowed.
Gadreel took up the bottle, filling his shot glass with a hand that shook.  Half the glass spilled before he was able to fully lift it.  He set it back down, carefully refilled it, gingerly raised it to his lips and swallowed.
“That’s exactly what I mean,” Sam replied evenly.  “It’s been burnt down by rogues.  The majority of her pack was taken out.  Most of those capable of providing protection are dead or wounded.”
“Ellen,” he replied.  He graced her with a flirty, teasing smile that lit up a stunning face.  She was suddenly very glad she’d left Jo back at camp. The poor girl wouldn’t have stood a chance.
“And you’re carrying a heavy crate?” She demanded. The blonde turned her glare to the new omega.  “He was hurt saving you.  The least you could have done was carry the damn box.”
The omega’s eyes widened at the chastisement and she turned, walking purposefully away back towards the Hub.
“Did you want to hear what they’re saying, then?”  Rowena asked in her musical Irish lilt.  “You could have just said as much.  It’s a basic spell.  Easy as sin, my lovely.”
Dean snapped out a hand, deftly catching the bottle of moonshine before it could fall and spill.  “No need for waste,” he commented, the words coming out thick and slurred.
Castiel’s eyes gleamed in the darkness, backlit with his stolen power.  His expression however, was troubled.  Or disappointed, maybe.  Dean didn’t really give a crap.
“Are you alright, Dean?”  The innocent tone was so laced with smug that Dean decided he had to do something about it.  He was not going to be the only one falling apart in this damn parking lot, and he absolutely was not going to come in his pants two minutes in like some green teenager.
“Moved onto a little frottage between the legs, caresses over the pants.  Not too much, just a tease, enough to make sure that beauty stayed put for me.”
“One hell of a bender,” Sam commented, taking a seat on the steps next to his sibling.  And, just to be a bitch, “Want a drink?  A little hair of the dog?”
He stretched his arms high overhead, reveling in the chilly morning air.  A crisp breeze teased along the newly exposed skin of his abdomen, goose bumps prickling up over his warm flesh.  He was past the peak need of his heat, but it’d be a day or two yet before he was completely ready to rejoin the world.  Or maybe never; he thought ruefully.
Sensing eyes on him, Dean turned his head, cracking his lids so he could take in his bedmate.  Unsurprisingly, Cas was staring at him.  He always seemed to be the first one to wake up after a post-coital nap.  And they’d had more than a few of those over the last few days.  What he could remember of those days, anyway.  It had been one hell of a ride.
Sam finished getting dressed, taking his sweet time.  For once, they weren’t in any big hurry.  Dean had nearly finished loading the Impala, but he could wait.  Sam was just so tired.  Sleep had become a rare and precious commodity, what with Lucifer playing Angel of Music 24-7 in his subconscious.
Dean shifted atop him, causing Castiel’s cock to throb anew, the sensation a continuous agony buried as it was in the deep, tight perfection of his lover’s ass.  The sensation was enough to make him come, more that enough.  But, among the numerous ropes that Dean had strung around him in a slow teasing dance of hickies and kisses, was some form of torture device that wrapped around Cas testicles, preventing him from achieving orgasm.  For such a simple device it had proved devastatingly effective.
This was exactly why he’d always been so careful to meet Dean anywhere but in his home.  His omega was sitting up at attention, just waiting for a chance to pounce or be pounced.  Dean had this lazy sexiness about him; calm and so casually Dominant that Cas nearly missed it when he wasn’t paying close attention.
Dean turned and hefted his box of gunpowder.  It wasn’t nearly as satisfying as sinking his teeth into Crowley’s jugular, but at least it’d make Benny more agreeable.
It wasn’t like he’d wanted to do anything with that trucker.  And it was just a blowjob, no matter what his dad seemed to think.  And the man hadn’t hurt him or anything.  He’d gotten his rocks off; given Dean the money as promised and left.
Apparently GodCas was as entranced with Dean’s body as his previous, moderately less psycho incarnation.  Cas ran soft fingers down his chest, gaze intent.  He didn’t go lower for Dean’s ‘money spot’, instead letting his touch rove at random, Pectorals, abs, an occasional flick over a nipple.
Sliding up until he was mere inches away, Dean made sure to hold Castiel's gaze while taking a deep, deliberate inhalation.  Cas’ pupils instantly dilated and his entire body grew taut in response to being scented, confirming what Dean’s heavily suppressed second nature had been trying to tell him at him all along.
“Well, I am irresistible,” Dean agreed.  The smiled faded.  “But I figured it was just your omega reacting to its Alpha, and not what you really wanted.  Otherwise why would you avoid me all this time?”
“I don’t care what you have to do.  Knock over a gas station, pick freaking pockets.  You will not allow a man touch you again.  Not like that.  Do you understand me?”  He demanded, voice ice-cold.
“Damn straight, I do,” Dean growled, taking a knee alongside Gadreel’s body with a good deal more dexterity than he’d shown in the last half hour.
John Winchester in his wisdom, chose to build the Pack home over the bones of an old, decayed town.  This meant that over the years they were able to resurrect a number of amenities, including generator-based electricity and plumbing, to most of the structures.  It was but one of his many choices that allowed the Pack to flourish.
Castiel rose, not bothering to dress, because fuck her, and wandered into the hall to watch the interaction.
Sam smacked him in the shoulder.  “Shut it.  You know what would have happened if we let the Fangs get him.  He’s safer with us.  I’m proud of you, Dean.”
Castiel was about to say...something, but fingers at his entrance derailed his train of thoughts.  Bright sparks of pleasure deep inside him made Cas shiver. Closing his eyes and sighing deep, Castiel gave into the sensations thrumming through his body.
He’d been careful to keep a wary eye on Benny; well aware the ornery beta blamed him for costing the pack the valuable crates of gunpowder.  Castiel was far from helpless, but the beta was a big man and clearly well liked. Castiel didn’t want to start any fights so soon if he could help it.
The man at the computer next to him suddenly made a choking sound, spitting a mouthful of latte into the air.  Castiel glanced over, watching the man attempt to wipe coffee droplets off the screen with a paper napkin while continuing to make that choked sound.  Humans were so odd.
“I cannot believe you never told me,” Dean muttered.  Castiel stiffened.  The alpha was plenty angry, sure, but he sounded a little hurt too.  That was the last thing Cas wanted.
“Yeah, sure.  But I’ve been on the road all my life; sometimes I just need to get out.  Relive the glory years, ya know?” Dean said, pulling out one of his guns for a cleaning.
The three girls fell asleep as one, happy, sated looks on their faces.  If their sudden unconscious state seemed suspicious, well, it wasn’t anything Dean hadn’t anticipated.  He rolled onto his side Burt Reynolds style, buck-naked on a pile of clothes on the hay bale and waited expectantly.
“Dean,” she greeted, smiling.  Whatever he was now, she still harbored some affection for the boy she’d once known.
So many reasons.  Because he was worried he would lose a piece of himself.  Because he’d never reacted to anyone the way he did with Dean.  Because the more Castiel wanted something, the more likely it was he’d lose it.  Because he was scared…
“What are we going to do about this?” Sam asked, a tad helplessly.  This was one place where he was absolutely useless.  Ever since he’d figured out that his big brother wasn’t just ‘off getting chicks’, he’d researched secondary natures of and on.  The available information was spotty at best.  Duals didn’t like to talk.
On the outside, the pack Arm House was nothing special.  It looked like any of the other small block homes dotting Winchester center.  One had to look closely to note the reinforced locks at all the doors and armed guards reclining on the wraparound porch 24-7 to realize it wasn’t what it seemed.
“My name is Castiel.  You have experience in this topic?” Castiel asked, rising to follow Sebastian.
Castiel couldn’t help but admire this whole set up.  And while he hated to admit it, such smooth organization tended to be a ‘from the top’ kind of thing.  A pack took their cues from the leader.  As much as Castiel distrusted the notion, the hyper vicious beast that had won him in a ringside death match may actually be a good man.  More than that: a good Alpha.
He bolted forward, crouching down just in time to grab his brother’s arm as the blade’s edge bit into the fallen soldier’s neck.  A bright red bead of blood spouted at the knife’s tip, dripping in a steady ruby stream into a puddle on the dusty ground.
“Dean…” Cas began weakly.  Because he did trust Dean absolutely.  And really, Castiel always wanted Dean.  Ever since that first innocent, curious taste, he’d found himself impossibly addicted to the other man.
Getting Cas’ top half completely naked just wasn’t in the cards without removing the handcuffs, and Dean had no intention of making that mistake.  Castiel may appear outwardly calm and patient, but believing that was a rookie mistake.  The Alpha was just waiting for an opening to strike.  Instead, Dean left the opened shirt on Castiel's arms, focusing lower.  He unbuttoned the pants waistband, delicately lowering the zipper so that it wouldn't catch sensitive flesh before gripping the material with both hands and sliding down Cas legs, taking the clothing with him.  Cas raised his hips to assist, groaning slightly as his erection was freed, the skin feeling overheated despite the bunker’s cool air.
Benny came trotting out to meet them in Jo’s wake.  “This is what all the fuss was about?” He asked in his smooth Cajun drawl, eyeing Dean's companion, clearly unimpressed.
He reached his arms around Dean’s quaking body, easing him to the ground.  “I have you,” he murmured, stroking his arms and back, allowing the omega to settle against him.
Dean extricated himself from the clinging ginger.  “Charlie, would you do me a favor?  We need someone to play host for Cas, here.  He needs to a mentor that won’t punch him in the face.”
He knew Cas had sensed his acceptance, because he slowed down the pace, began to take his time to nuzzle and lick and enjoy.  A sharp bite at Dean’s inner thigh and he knew he’d be sporting a deep purple mark there for days.
Sam glanced up, his eyes seeing too much as always.  “You were gone a while.  Eventful walk?”  He asked, tone carefully neutral.  His gaze slid to the bottle of home made hooch in Dean’s hand, but he didn’t say anything.  Sam always was the smarter of the two of them.
Dean slowly opened his eyes.  “You mean that time you turned into a murderous, psycho, all powerful megalomaniac and destroyed half of heaven and tons of folk down here?”
He wandered over to the prize corral amid myriad shoulder claps of celebration that made him ache.  Hiding the pain from the good-natured congratulations came easily, the result of long practice.
“Well, of course he is,” Ellen, replied.  “Those bastards would have stormed us to demand a rematch otherwise.”
Fuck.  A flick of angel power and Cas’ banished his pants entirely.  He’d figure out where they’d gone later.  He reached for Dean’s freed leg and positioned the knee bent on the mattress and laid his full body weight over the other man's body.  He firmly slid one finger, angelically slick, inside the hunter.  Dean bucked at the unexpected sensation, groaning.
When Dean didn’t answer, Cas lifted his body weight up, pulling away.  At least he’d gotten to taste Dean, feel the hunter’s pleasure as he writhed for him.  It would have to be enough.
Cas didn’t have much of anything to use to stake a similar claim.  After a moment, he removed his baby blue Gas N Sip employee issue vest, neatly folded it into quarters, and set it on the other bed, before taking a seat as well.  He was a little tired, but not physically exhausted by any means.   The tasks required of him for his job weren’t exactly straining, physically or mentally.
Dean had at least acknowledged him, and while it hadn’t exactly been an expression of absolution, he wasn’t freezing Castiel out either.  As long as Dean was actively communicating with him, the issue would usually blow over.
One look at the purely, viscerally mortal form of Dean Winchester had rendered Cas completely speechless.  For in losing his natural Angelic Sight, Castiel had actually Seen Dean.  Say what you would about the salty Hunter, but physically he was a truly magnificent specimen of his kind.
“Just a minute, Sam,” Cas replied.  I’m busy.”  His eyes were glued to the far group, focused on their target with all the stiff, dedicated fixation of a pointer hound.
Dean crouched at his side; waiting cautiously until the Angel was through the worst of the convulsions before leaning in and gingerly sliding the fallen blanket back over his shoulders.
Dean’s house was identical to Ellen and Sam’s.  Each house was about a half mile apart, located at the wooded border of Pack territory, a short ways away from the main hub.  Three small steps led to the wrap around porch.
Chuckling at his bossy soon-to-be-mate, Dean pulled out to the tip and slammed back with his full strength, forcing a grunt out of the omega. The power of his thrust was so strong it sent Cas sliding forward and he had to scramble to get his hands against the wall to keep from hitting his head.
Dean actually laughed, though his hips never slowed their bruising pace.  But Cas’ hole had loosened enough to fully embrace Dean’s width and he struggled now to push back into his fucking, trying to meet each thrust.
Dean groaned, eyes sliding shut as he thrust his hips into the teasing fingers.  “If…if you’re waiting for me to complain, you’re gonna be waiting a while,” he replied, gasping when the angel’s hand gripped his cock as best it could in the confined space.
This was exactly why he’d moved so fast.  Getting Dean to accept what they both wanted was, for reasons Cas didn’t truly understand, a daunting task.  Now was the moment where he found out if he’d succeeded in getting them there, past whatever ghosts plagued the hunter’s mind, or whether they both stopped, frustrated and unsatisfied.  He’d experienced both outcomes enough times in the past to know it could go either way.
Worse, the next time Dean was lost or hurt, and this was Dean Winchester; there would always be a next time, his enormous will might take hold, choking back the impulse to cry out for Cas.  Dean wouldn’t want to drag his friend into his torture.
A particular birdcall sounded, carried over from person to person as the pack scattered to their assigned locations.  Castiel dropped his gear and bolted for the weapons house.
“This is a problem,” Dean said finally.  He looked up, more serious than Cas ever remembered seeing him
“You’re right,” he agreed after a moment.  “My vessel is toxically overwhelmed with mating hormones.  The Angel-cuffs are helping me maintain control, but I don’t think it will last.”
Ellen smiled, reaching out to take one of Castiel’s hands, gently scenting marking him as pack.  “Hi, yourself.”
It was what he’d been doing for over a millennia.  Interposed with the occasional smiting here and there, of course.  A few battles with renegade angels, rogue demons, whatever his Heavenly father required of him.  But mostly, he watched.
Freshly showered, Dean sat down on his bed. He glanced down at the crumpled napkin on the floor.  Alec had boldly slipped it into Dean’s back pocket with a saucy wink and a fond pat.  His phone number, of course.  They always gave Dean their number.  With a sigh of regret, he scooped the napkin up, rolled it into a tight ball and lobbed it into the trashcan across the room.  Rim shot.
Ellen cursed.  Her best Hunters, gone.  They’d all been spinsters, at least. So she didn’t have more pups to deal with.  She had enough of that already.  Ellen glanced over at the hastily erected tent where the pack’s children were holed up; two thirds of them with at least one dead parent, the rest orphans.  What the hell was she going to do?
“Do you intend to go pursue her personal information?” Cas asked.  If Dean was going to make a move on the waitress, Cas hoped her shift ended late enough that he could still secure a ride back.  It would be a long walk back to the Gas N Sip.
The idea sent a brief nervous twinge down Cas’ spine, an unpleasant reminder that he couldn’t just disappear at will, that if Dean plied his full strength on him, that it would be no illusion this time; he’d have to rely entirely on trust.  Just as Dean had done for him every other time when he willingly put his body into an Angel’s powerful grip.
Cas groaned and he was coming hard and fast.  Dean would have grinned if he could.  So much for that angelic absolute control bullshit.  Cas emptied himself down Deans throat, gradually softening in his mouth.
Jody shook her head.  “Nah.  I appreciate the offer, but everyone here has specific jobs.  We’re a pretty well oiled machine.  Best to leave everyone to do their thing.  Next time.”
Castiel groaned as a new burst of agony wracked his body, desperately fighting to free his limbs, though he’d long ago determined that escape was impossible. He’d been very effectively bound by a true master of the craft.  He wasn’t going anywhere any time soon.
“You take care of yourself, Castiel.  Enjoy the vacation while you can.  I have a feeling the world ain’t near done with you, yet.”
“Aww, Bobby, what kind of boring old house wife do you take me for?  You know that’s no fun.  But while I got you beholden to me and all that, can you tell me anything you may have heard about spider men?  And I don’t mean the friendly neighborhood kind.”
Ellen chuckled.  The whole area seemed so damn...healthy.  No hollow eyes, no fear.  Folk eyed her curiously, sure, but trusted their Alphas in letting her in.
Castiel tugged gently on Dean’s hips.  “You’ve rested enough.  I need to be inside you.  Ride me, omega-mine.”
In many ways, Sam was the conscious he’d had stamped out of him from growing up in a life of death and bloodshed.  It felt good to know the little brother he’d raised from a pup could still think well of him.
“Now, in about a minute, I’ll have this open.  And you will be free.  Do whatever the fuck you want.  If you want a place to live, my pack will take you in.  We have a thriving territory a few days out and have more than enough room for you.  There are plenty of alphas and more than a few betas back home willing and capable of helping you through your heat.  Now generally, I’m on that list, but I am about fucking done with you, no matter how gorgeous you are.  So, if you want to join my pack, follow me.  If not, go. Be free.  Find your damn bliss or whatever.”
Turning to the crowd, Crowley raised his arms for silence.  “I’d say we have a worthy challenger for the legendary Dean Winchester, eh lads?” He roared into the anticipatory silence.
Using two hands simultaneously proved beyond him.  The Halo soldier gave up on holding the glass, instead using his right hand alone to lift the bottle, pouring a thin stream of clear liquid several inches to the left of his goal.  Without so much as a whimper, Gadreel’s eyes rolled to the back of his head; the bottle falling from his nerveless grip as he toppled to the ground.
The fights were completely voluntary; no holds barred, no rules.  Sometimes you lived to fight another day, other times…not so much.  But that was the nature of the Fifth Ring.  If you couldn’t handle that particular flavor of heat, stay the hell out of the Ring.
Fast forward a while.  Dean and Sam have gone their separate ways (briefly), what with Sam betraying his brother for some damn demon. Smoking hot or not, that just was not okay.  And the whole letting Satan out.  Not exactly awesome.
Dean raised his voice, the deep tones resounding through the clearing.  “It’s decided.  For the good of the pack, the Winchester Alpha Duo is officially becoming a Triumvirate."
“I’m not going to ask how someone as lovely as your sweet self has gone this long without going all the way, it’s not my business,” Sebastian told him.  “Though I won’t lie, I’m curious as hell.”
Dismissing all thoughts of Sam, Dean continued purposefully striding through the hall.  His Alpha would be near to losing it, and Dean needed to be ready.   The game was just starting to get good.
“Right.  Whatever,” Dean muttered, but he couldn't conceal the smile directed down at the young lady.
The bigger packs around here left the Roadhouse alone; it suited them to have such a place around.  Most could be counted to throw in a few extra supplies here and there during dry spells.
“Please, Dean.  Tell me what I did?”  Cas asked.  Distraught was still a fairly new sensation for him, but he’d felt it enough times over the last few years to recognize it keenly.  “I can’t come over there, please come back.”
“I figured it was something along those lines,” Sam replied cautiously.  “But since you obvious didn’t want to talk about it, I never asked.”
Cas lifted one elegant eyebrow.  “Really? Not that I noticed.  He actually seemed particularly inventive…ow!”
True to form, Dean surged forward, briefly claiming control of the kiss.  “Fuck Cas.  Be careful.  You how bad it stings when you pull that shit,” he murmured lips dancing around Cas’.
“We’re going to let the fire die out since we leave at first light.  You’ll get a chill if you don’t wrap up.  There are spare bedrolls over by the supplies if you want one.”
Dean chuckled.  “Fair warning, Sam will come by at some point.  He gets twitchy if he we don’t touch bases on the regular.”
Fortunately, his body language worked as he’d hoped, calming his mate’s protective rage.  He felt Dean’s muscles relaxing as his body came down from attack mode.  He glanced over his shoulder; relieved to see the red haze had bled away and Dean’s eyes were back to their usual green hue.
“Everything will change,” Cas replied firmly.  “For starter’s, certain stupid brunette omegas are going to need to find someone else to knot them.  Actually, the smart ones too.  And redheads, and blondes.  I don’t share.”
Looking distinctly green around the gills, he reached for the bottle, filling the glass until it overflowed.  He straightened his spine, and slammed the shot fast, stuttering as it burned its way down his throat to join its many, many friends.
“Oh, and Cas?” he asked innocently.  The heat of his breath danced along the stimulated flesh, making the angel squirm in him arms.  “It’s okay if you want to put your hands on me, you know.  Anywhere you want.”
“Dean,” Cas asked a few minutes later.  His tone was back to his usual calm, all that heat and need safely buried.
For the first time Castiel truly understood the insidious call of temptation.  And he wasn’t at all sure he was strong enough to resist.  Or if he even wanted to.
“Okay, okay.  Hold on, Mr. Bossy,” Dean muttered.  He sat up on his knees and positioned his cock, Cas’ legs still propped over his shoulders.
“Whatever,” Dean growled. He turned and walked toward their newest pack member, Sam and Ellen just behind him.
The first time Sam had seen this type of mark since waking up crazy, he’d had his suspicions, but no facts to back it up.  The second time he’d noticed, he’d made a point of watch his brother; noting odd moments or behaviors suggesting he was newly injured for no reasons that Sam knew of.
Castiel was cleaning his long knife after weapons practice.  It had been almost a week since the Halos had come and gone.  And since the pack had made a major windfall with the amazing bargain Alpha Ellen had worked out, Castiel was definitely in favor with his packmates.
“And plan B involves us alone in a dark park?”  Cas asked, though it seemed he was slowly getting the idea.
Because it was unlikely that Dean was still openly seeking out a hookup with the rebel-angel, considering what Castiel had done to them.  But the usual signs were definitely there; sex was almost certainly still happening.  And Castiel was a God, now.
“Friends and neighbors, let us prepare for the next duel,” he roared in his deep voice.  “I’ve outdone myself, if I do say so myself.  I submit as a prize to our victorious gladiator the choice of these two items,” Dean rolled his eyes at the fancy talk.  Crowley always did have a flair for the dramatic.
Even as Cas opened his mouth to ask if Dean was sure, his hips took the omega at his word, thrusting hard into that tight, welcoming heat.  He held back as best he could, wanting to go slow, to give Dean time to adjust.
“I always knew you’d be trying to call the shots in bed,” Dean told him with a smile that was pure devil.  His eyes had darkened from their usual apple green to a rich, dark amber-flecked shade that matched the Pack’s best barrel aged whiskey.
Fortunately, the town they were currently planted in sported a thriving gay bar so he didn’t have to worry about the secret handshake, which ear had an earring, any of that subtle crap.  $20 slipped to the motel clerk bought him an address.  Once there, it didn’t take him long to find a buddy.
But they wouldn’t be any good to her injured or dead, and there was nothing of value left in that pile of burnt wood and rebar; it was best left to the ghosts.
He wasn’t sure whether the angel needed to hear that or not, but Dean wanted there to be no misunderstanding between them.  He’d thoroughly enjoyed every minute of that unexpected trip.  Maybe too much.  He needed some distance, time to think.
Dean’s response was to grind his pelvis against Cas’ trapped groin, the friction a delicious torment against his cock.  The motion cast sharp relief on the fact that he was painfully hard.
Castiel watched the large alpha leave.  He took one lingering glance back in the direction of Persephone, where at least he was in familiar territory and knew what to expect.  Of course, the expected was also terrible.  This new future was unknown.  He cast a rueful look up at at the distant tent, where he could scent some residual and unfortunately enticing traces of Dean's lingering battle pheremones.  Well, at least the future would be interesting.  Castiel squared his shoulders and started down the path that led to the Winchester Pack encampment.
Daphne stepped forward, coming between them.  “My husband had an accident a while back.  He occasionally experiences some residual amnesia.   If you met some time ago, he may simply not remember.”  She smiled, but it wasn’t particularly friendly.  “Now if you will excuse us, we need to get home before the ice cream melts.”
But this wasn’t something Sam would ever be able understand, not really.  He couldn’t.  It was a matter of simple genetics.  Some folk had it and some… did not.  And Sam was mercifully out of that particular loop.
“Excellent.  One would be the ‘top’ if they were the do-er, the man who will be doing the penetrating.  Also called ‘pitcher’ if you are into sports metaphors.”
As he spoke, Crowley’s men neatly herded a clearly resistant figure into the prize corral amidst the hoots and hollers of the crowd.  The man stumbled as he was forced into the corral, then straightened, casting a level gaze a cross the crowd.  Cerulean blue eyes locked briefly with Dean’s before continuing his scan.
Cas wasn’t fixing Sam; he’d made it clear that that particular boat had sailed back when Dean and Bobby had tried to stop him from opening Purgatory.
Dean set a bruising pace right out of the gate and Cas loved every aching second of it.  Heat built inside him, the promise of a mind-shattering orgasm on the horizon.  Impossibly, Dean sped up, slamming his ass, the edge of what promised to be an epic knot brushing against Cas’ hole with each pass.
Once he’d again filled Castiel completely, Dean leaned forward, his hand planting on either side of Cas’ head, bending him nearly in half.  Castiel hadn’t thought he could take that cock any deeper.  He was so, so wrong.
He looked into Cas’ eyes, every inch the Alpha.  “You want to make it better? Then turn around, Castiel.  Offer me your neck.”
“Well, well, well,” Dean murmured, eyes shuttering to demon black.  His hand emerged from the hay, blade free.  “Guess my Angel really is a centerfold.”
The rider tugged off the helmet, revealing a pale redhead with big doe eyes, wearing an adorable scowl.
When they came out, they weren’t alone.  A dozen or so folk ringed the blazing fire, the flames lighting up the quickly darkening evening.  Dean stood among them, passing around the one bottle remaining of her moonshine left, clearly purloined from her jeep.  Not that it mattered, she reminded herself; the bottle, like the jeep, was his now.
These days he didn’t see visits to the outer towns as a fun chance to indulge in his favorite vices.  They were overcrowded, filthy and inherently dangerous.  And in a lawless, rough and tumble town like Persephone there were too far many variables that were out of Dean’s control.
The alpha smelled so fucking good.  He was everything Castiel could ever want.  Dominant, protective, more than tough enough to protect him and any pups they may have down the line.  They hunted well together.  And the sex was the best Cas had ever had.
Maybe Dean shouldn’t have called him a shitty lay.  But he’d been hurting, on several different levels, and pain always drove him say things he probably shouldn’t.  No matter, he’d heal up in a day or two.  There had only been a little blood, and after a hot shower and a couple of Tylenol, the throbbing had receded to more of a dull ache.
Taking Cas’ elbow, Dean hauled his friend to his feet.  Cas allowed himself to be guided down the hall without complaint.  His resistance was hanging by the barest of threads and he knew it.
“Dean, “ Cas murmured much later, his hoarse voice soft in the soothing darkness.  He hadn't started out hoarse, that had been a gradual result from all the screaming.  Dean's skills as a lover had never been in question, but he never truly appreciated it the way a human could.
This was a good time.  Nothing overtly dangerous lay within miles of the motel.  Sam and Dean were both reasonably safe and in good health.
He surged forward and slammed Dean back against the wall, gripping him hard by his arms.  He didn’t realize in his anger that he was leaving bruises, and Dean didn’t complain about the too-tight hold.
Sam took after their father, no matter how much he might try to deny it.  And John Winchester had been a norm through and through.
“They will,” Castiel told him as the hunter’s jumped to their tasks.  “A deal made with the Silver City Pack is sacrosanct.”
“What was I thinking?  I was thinking that we ran out of food three days ago, Dad!  This motel is in the middle of nowhere.  The credit card you left us was dead.  I was thinking that I couldn’t keep pressing my luck stealing from the only gas station within walking distance.  Eventually I’d get nabbed again.”
“That’s a good thing,” Dean replied, a hint of relief in his expression.  “You have enough nightmares.”
“I don’t believe so,” Emmanuel replied, looking faintly troubled.  “I usually remember every face I come across in exact detail.”
Ellen followed Sam across the way to the other identical house.  It was surprisingly spacious, neat and quite tidy for a single alpha male.  Dean was right about one thing; Sam did have a nice writing area set up.
Cas didn’t give him any time to adjust or stretch to accommodate what was a fairly generous helping of cock, but they tended to skip that part anyway.  Dean could handle the burn, and he’d usually preferred his sex with men to be a little on the rough side.
Cas stepped up beside him.  Before Dean could ask what the other man was up to, gentle fingers grazed his forehead.  The ache in his throat and residual headache vanished.  Well, that was convenient.  It would be particularly useful for other sex-related aches, Dean’s treacherous mind pointed out.  No, no, bad libido, he chastised him evil little brain.  No more hot angel-sex for you.   At least for now.  He’d liked it entirely too much.
Sam sighed.  “I’ve found that it’s always easier for the person who was wronged to forgive than the person who has to watch the fallout.  But yes, we’re okay.  This isn’t your fault.”
He paused, listening intently for the sounds of his pursuer.  Just before he turned down a narrow hall passage to the left, he froze.  Dean didn’t hear anything, but unlike him, Cas hadn’t had the opportunity to fill the bunker with his scent.
Above him, Dean groaned, leaning heavily against the wall.  He pushed his ass out, begging with his body for more.  That was nice, but Castiel thought it would be even better if his omega begged out loud.  But Dean was stubborn; Castiel would have to work to get him to that point.
Castiel watched the Winchester brothers and older woman walk his direction.  With all the flurry around him, he couldn’t get a great scent on her, but her eyes and body language pegged her as an alpha.
Asa limped around the jeep, pulling a woman wrapped in a blanket out one side.  “She’s injured.  Hit by something big.  Right arm is broken as well as some ribs, I think.  She’s been out in the woods for a while, got some open wounds that smell infected. “
“Yeah, we might’ve thrown down a little bit.  Dean’s monster wanted to dance, and mine was a fair bit jealous at being left out of all the excitement and wanted out, too.  We didn’t do each other any lasting harm.”
“Easy, you,” Dean gentled him down again, kissing back with a teasing nibble.  “I’ve got this.”  The soft velvet of Dean's lips traveled down and along his neck, eliciting a shiver.
Cas weakly smacked him on the arm.  “Don’t pretend to be coy.  It doesn’t suit you.  You know I’ve always been attracted to you.”
The next match wouldn’t be for a bit.  Bored, Dean looked around, watching as Sam loomed watchfully over his packmates as they continued to carry crates out to the truck parked at the Winchester encampment on outskirts of town.  His eyes gleamed, watchful expression hinting he was on the cusp of violence.
“Umm, thanks, but no.  Try Sam.  He’s more the yoga type.”  Smirking slightly at Sam’s caustic glare, Dean turned away and headed outside to change the oil on their latest stolen vehicle.  There was no way in hell he was going to get all cozied up with Castiel.  Nothing good could come from poking at that beehive.
He legitimately screamed, new wetness pouring out of him, soaking them both where they were connected, saturating the blanket beneath them.  Dean continued to fuck him though his orgasm, groaning as Castiel’s ass clenched around him.
Sam rarely fought, but not because he was unwilling.  He was gentle for an Alpha, sure, but still an Alpha.  He may publicly detest unnecessary violence, but once he was in the thick of it, he loved the fight nearly as much as Dean.  The problem arose in that opponents took one look at the massive pile of muscle and abruptly decided they had somewhere else to be.  Which was exactly how Dean liked it.  If he’d orchestrated a few rumors glamourizing Sam’s ‘brutal' fighting style, well, Sam didn’t need to know.
Castiel looked away.  “I know.  I honestly never thought they’d care enough to look for me, much less find me.  Nearly all Halos are betas.  Our clan has a very difficult time reproducing, and the rare omegas we do manage to birth are seldom allowed to leave our territory.  I was…an abberitation.”
Reaching into her pocket she pulled her flask, offering it to Dean.  Curious, the Alpha sniffed at the drink and took a swig, eyes widening in appreciation.
Before Dean could formulate some type of response, Cas stood and turned to face him, leaning against Dean’s slightly larger form until they were firmly pressed chest to chest.
Dean grinned toothily at Sam and winked.  His eyes shuttered to demon black, making Sam wince.  He grunted when Cas yanked him along.  “So worth it,” he told his brother, chuckling darkly as he was guided away.
Okay, then.  Sam turned back to Rowena.  “Well?” She asked, raising one delicate eyebrow.  “One brother, as promised.  I believe we had a deal, Samuel.”
“No.  You don’t get to talk yet.  You had all the time in the world to talk before you disappeared to make that…thing.  It’s my turn, now.”
She moved on.  “Now, Benny’s a solid choice.  Nice and easygoing, non-threatening, but plenty alpha where it counts.” She gave a little groin thrust as a visual aid.  “If you’re wanting a nice, thick knot in a big ol’ sweet-talking, teddy bear shaped package he’s the way to go.”
“What, um, what do I need to say, or do, to get you to keep doing that?”  Cas finally stammered out.  “Please?”
Castiel is ready to take Dean up on his standing offer.  He just has to figure out how.  And as he learned from Sam Winchester, when in doubt, there's always research.
Which was way Dean was the last person Castiel expected to see leaning against his porch at dawn.  Well, that and Dean’s deep, lasting aversion to mornings.
Her voice sobered.  “I put half a dinner set worth of silver through her chest, but not before she’d clawed Jason’s arm to pieces.  It looked like someone had run it through a damn shredder from the shoulder down.”
He put the word out that he was unavailable; only the one’s he was close with, or the truly desperate, managed to reach him. But it was enough to stay busy.  More importantly, he looked busy enough to settle Dean’s concerns. Damn mother hen.  Bobby supposed that’s just what happens to a person when they have to become a father by age twelve.
With a click, the first wrist cuff flipped open.  Dean took the omega’s other wrist in hand and began to work on it.
Cas lost his grip on his legs, collapsing in heap, distantly aware of a surge of pressure in his ass as Dean slammed his knot home, spilling inside Cas and locking them together.  And then the world went dark.
Castiel’s hips moved faster, rutting blindly against the bedspread, his orgasm chasing Dean’s.  It was the work of a moment until he was spilling onto the bed.
“It’s not an issue; Dean has no mating gland.” His gaze had turned back to Sam so he didn’t notice the warning glare Dean shot his way until too late.
“He’ll wake two hours after sunrise, well rested and refreshed.  I’ve even ensured that he’ll have pleasant dreams.  Wasn’t that generous of me, all things considered?”
The faint ‘pop’ of a distant gunshot and the furthest Halo soldier to the left was suddenly clutching his chest, blood pouring from the open wound.  The man wavered a bit before collapsing heavily to the ground.
Dean glanced behind them, locking eyes with his brother.  ‘Keep searching,’ he mouthed.  Sam nodded.  There was no guarantee, or reason really, for sex to nullify the spell.  It was just a stop gate.
Curious.  Things being what they were, it was particularly exhilarating scent.  Down boy, he chastised his inner omega.  This was one person who was completely off the table.
“Did you know I’ve spent weeks looking through the world’s plants and beasts?”  Cas asked.  “I’ve examined over 40 species of tree frog alone, trying to find a single thing that comes in a similar shade of green as your eyes.  I haven’t even come close.  Nothing else in nature compares.”
After as much thought on all this as he could bear, Castiel went in search of Sam.  Finding him wasn’t hard.  The lanky alpha was teaching tracking fundamentals to teenagers.  Apparently tracking, as well as basic fighting and weapon care was something every member of the pack was expected to learn.
Cas took advantage of Dean's lower body position, licking at the heated skin of the omega's neck, temporarily satisfied now that he was properly inside his partner.  Dean tasted like sweat and salt and leather.  It was the sweetest thing he’d ever tasted.
Apparently satisfied, Rowena slipped the piece of horn into a side pocket, smiling brightly.  She then hopped back up onto the tailgate, resuming her former spot while she continued to sip elegantly at her whisky.
A dark, eager part of his mind reminded him that the Winchesters were all about second chances.  And if at first he didn’t succeed, well, there was always next time.
His arms were still pinned up behind his head by the cuffs linked to the heavy chain, but the metal appeared very tight, straining against the pressure being applied to it.
Sam shrugged.  “I don’t think so. None that I can remember, anyway.”  In point of fact, he felt better well rested than usual.  He might actually have gotten a few hours of honest to god rest.
Okay, this chapter took a sharp left into whatthehell, I won't lie.  But I do like how it worked out.  Also, the end is nigh.  And by nigh, I mean smut.  Mediocore smut, but smut nonetheless.  All the hurt/comforts.
“C’mon back. I wanted to show you something.”  Dean led the way to the back of the small house.  In Sam’s home that had been the weapons area.  Dean’s set up was no different.
They wound their way through the underbrush, the hidden path zigzagging in a clever maze.  Ellen was impressed.  One could always burn through the grass, of course, but they’d be sitting ducks while they did it.
Castiel spent the next several days exploring his new territory.  Not everyone was a fucking ray of sunshine like Charlie, plenty were rude or dismissive, but that seemed more likely to be attributed to their cuddly personalities and not related to Castiel’s omega status.
He reached around to the front of Dean’s neck, pulling the key to the handcuffs off the leather necklace he’d hastily tied on earlier.  Dean bucked against him, making Cas snarl and press his cock against Dean’s denim-covered ass, pressing firmly with his hips.  “Be still,” he murmured, hot breath and soft lips dancing along the sensitive skin behind Dean’s ear.
But what she saw wasn’t some beta blockheads kicking a fuss.  A dozen folk of all ages, sexes, and yes, apparently types, were sparring in an organized class.
“What the hell do you think your doing?” Dean demanded, slamming the brake  “Get the fuck out, Cas.  You have a designated job, same as anyone else here.”
The figure straightened and strode into the middle of the road, her dark silhouette distinctive against the bright light of the waxing gibbous moon.  And what a silhouette it was.
Dean had a mating bite, but he hadn’t taken in his partner’s.  It was going to start to really suck in a little while.  Despite everything that had just happened between them, Dean didn’t shake off his touch.
Dean looked up and briefly caught John's eye, the glint of humor fading before he pasted on a smile and bent back down to murmur something to his brother that made Sam laugh again.  At least John had one kid he hadn’t screwed up.
Dean raised an eyebrow, focusing on Cas eager cock.  “Not bad,” he told him, meeting his eyes with a wink.
“Cas,” Dean muttered, his body shuddering below Cas' own.  He stopped fighting, giving in to the Angel’s demanding hands on his body.  “Please.”
The fine hairs at the back of his neck prickled, his instincts whispering that something dangerous was approaching.  Sam flew too his feet, scanning the wooded area behind his home.  Fucking finally.
Forty five minutes later two bottles lay abandoned in a discarded heap on the ground, both very recently emptied of the Winchester’s headiest moonshine.  A third was perilously close to joining them.
He swallowed.  “As an alpha, you shouldn’t have any trouble surviving an incomplete claim.”  It would be terrible, alphas had been known to get incredibly sick over rejected mating bites, but they survived it.
“Time to move up to my A game, I guess,” Dean commented absently.  implying that all this had merely been his B game? What else could he possibly…
For the first time in his life, he didn’t dread his heats, accepting them as a natural part of who he was.  Mother Moon help him, he was beginning to look forward to it.
The mammoth stood at full height and kicked out, surprisingly fast for such a large man.  The kick landed, nailing Dean right in the abdomen. He tensed his abs and loosened his body, allowing the momentum to carry him backwards into the air, saving his ribs from cracking but sending him rolling across the dirt.  His blade went flying from his hand and out of reach.  Dean cursed; rookie mistake.  If his father were still alive he’d beat his ass for that one.
Cas glanced coolly at his mate, daring the Alpha to try and tell him he wasn’t allowed to walk out the door with Sam.  Exceptions could be made when heat and hormones were in the air, but this was different.  This was about setting a precedent.
“I’ve been…very busy since my ascendance,” Cas replied, taking a seat next to Dean on the bed.  “It occurred to me that even the former God rested once a week.  I’ve decided I’ve earned a respite from my Good work.”
Dean didn’t look okay.  He was clutching the jeep door with both hands and swaying heavily.  He looked toward his brother, then turned a blood shot, wild gaze briefly onto Castiel.  Clenching his fists, the alpha spun and stumbled away.  He dove into the tall grass and disappeared.
But still.  Had Castiel been paying attention he’d have noticed that the Alpha had attained injuries; and by his very nature the man would be compelled to hide any damage attained during the fight.  Jo had been right.  Would it really have killed him to carry the stupid box?
“We have a couple of hard cases,” Sam replied with a sigh.  “I can’t stop them.  Believe me, I’ve tried.  But they just challenge whoever we pick to put in and they kick their asses first.”
Dean sat back up, gripping Cas’ hips in his hands so forcefully he was sure to have finger shaped bruises.  It was that image, his Alpha marking his body, that melted away the last of Castiel’s stubborn determination.
He leaned forward.  ‘Okay, first rule.  Lube is your friend.  You can literally never use too much…”
“How’d round two of Twister go?” Dean asked after a while.  He briefly wondered how Sam managed to get his overlong form onto the tiny mat.  He quickly quelched that line of thought.  It led in a direction Dean did not want his mind to go.
Castiel is looking for God.  And he wants to use an archangel to further this goal.  Wait, what?  Didn't one of those things blow him to little tiny angel bits not that long ago?  Looks like it's Dean's turn to play wingman for a change.
Sam watched them go.  “I should check in with a few things, and I definitely need a shower,” he reported.  “You two going to be okay?”
“Ellen,” Asa greeted.  “I found her by accident,” he reported, gesturing and the unconscious woman being carried into the medic’s tent.  “She was alone on the side of the road, knife injury.”  He winced slightly, shifting his weight to his good leg.
Dean dropped the crate in time to catch the slight blonde that threw herself at him, careful to tug her into a hug with his good arm. “Hey, Jo.  Yes, I fought. Yes, I’m fine. Everything is okay.”  The slim, bright-eyed beta openly scented him, completely unconcerned by her proximity to a blood-high, blood-drenched alpha.
“In a minute.  I need to speak with the Alpha,” he told the young medic frantically trying to attend to his leg wound.
“None more important than this,” Dean replied with a smile.  “I’ve been trying to get into your pants for years.”
“Why are you still over there?”  Cas asked.  “You’ll need to be significantly closer if we’re going to have sex, much less the kind involving my...”
Sam responded to Dean’s relaxed posture, his shoulders sagging slightly as he also went off battle mode.
“There we go,” Dean said in satisfaction, patting Cas’ thigh.  “Safe and sound.  Now, where were we?”
“Help you fight it?” Dean asked, needing to be clear.  “As far gone as you are, it’s dangerous.  Also, I’m really not the best at that…”
”Oh, smart and handsome.  What's a boy to do?  Yes, that’s exactly what I’m proposing.  Unless you can think of any other things you’d like.”  Balthazar canted a hip slightly, smirking.
Castiel stared into the place in the high grass where Dean had disappeared.  Keeping himself in check rather that following after the Alpha was nearly painful.
Rising up on his toes, he leaned in and kissed Dean gently on the lips.  “In all of creation I haven’t found anyone or anything remotely like you.  The way you feel, smell, your taste.  It’s completely unique.”  Pressing even closer, he pressed his lips against Dean’s again, a teasing hint of tongue encouraging him to respond.
Castiel moved silently along the still hallways, softly opening the door and slinking into Sam’s room, a dark shadow in a trench coat.  Sam’s degree of trust in him was so great that his wary subconscious accepted him in his space and didn’t alert the slumbering hunter of Cas’ presence at his bedside.  It was a humbling gift.
One thing Cas knew for certain.  Sticky and itchy or not, this was not the only time they would be indulging in sex.  Even if he had to storm the bunker, kidnap Dean, and sit on him.  His exhausted cock gave an optimistic throb, signaling it was in complete accord with the whole ‘sitting on Dean’ plan.  He rolled a bit, wincing at the ache.  Stupid mortal body.  Maybe round two in the morning.  Dean’s ass wasn’t sore, after all.
What was interesting though, was hubby may call himself Emmanuel, but he was the spitting image of a certain renegade angel that had disappeared on them earlier that year.   Bobby watched through the glass of the store he was currently staking out while the mystery man walked by his wife’s side, placidly pushing a grocery cart.
Over the years, Castiel had found himself in the homes of many pack Alphas, one way or another.  In all that time he had never once felt like it did with the Alphas of the Winchester Pack.  Most Alpha dens carried the telltale scent of rut, sex, and an oppressive Dominance that set his teeth on edge.  Conversely, just walking into Alpha Curve was enough to soothe all but the most crazed pack members.
Dean grinned his most wicked smile, noticing the way the angel’s eyes dilated in response.  He’d seen it before, caught signs suggesting that if he made a move it might be well received.  But it was always nice to have confirmation.
To his surprise, Benny didn’t come over to put him in his place.  Instead, the large male continued on with his task.  Castiel almost swore he saw a hint of a smile on the man’s face.
