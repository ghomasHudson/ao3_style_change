"Hmmm..'
"I know"
In the end we managed to find Suga several outfits that were not manufactured out of a petroleum product. She looked very nice and after a quick trip to Eddie’s pharmacy for some cosmetics she looked almost back to her normal satanic self. No actually she did look quite lovely, until she opened her mouth. Oh well, baby steps I suppose.
“Oh for goodness sake Locky, can’t you see Dr. Watson is a decent man and not some tart you can bat your eyes at and they fall to their knees. Control yourself. This is a doctor’s office and we are here for MY appointment.”
Brad and John spent the day together. Brad decided that John needed a new look to go with his new sexuality. By the end of the day John had been shorn and waxed and was carrying bags of potions and lotions. He also had managed to purchase a new wardrobe with his new friend's help. John was wearing new slim fit navy trousers and a very fitted navy and white striped polo shirt. A top his head was a jaunty white strawed fedora. There was one thing left to do.
Ft Stewart is a real Army base in south Georgia. Not sure if they sent anyone to Afghanistan but they did train troops to go to Iraq. Piggly Wiggly is a grocery store usually found in small southern towns. Lawrence Welk is a variety show from the '70's. It was and still is very popular with the over 70 set and can be found in reruns. Benadryl is an over the counter allergy medication. It also can control itching.
In the end the wedding went off without a hitch. Although John felt the designer wedding attire was a bit over the top. Sherlock had dragged him to several fashion shows In Paris to see which designer would suit the pregnant Omega best. John was extremely flattered when Modern Omega magazine wanted to do an article about the making of his wedding suit. Sherlock preened about like a goddamned peacock at the thought of his omega being featured in the magazine and everyone knowing the desirable omega was his and his alone.
"Excuse me gentlemen may I be of assistance?"
"Mary," he tried again."May I please speak with you."
I came downstairs around 5:30 and found Lolamae in the kitchen making supper. Lolamae had worked for my family for as long as I could remember. I used to hang out in the kitchen with her and watch her cook. That woman made the best biscuits.
"I am sorry brother but what exactly do you wish for me to do."
"Fine, Dr. Watson is recently invalided from Afghanistan. He is an Army doctor obviously. He has trust issues, obviously. An alcoholic brother. He attempted suicide but not really. He just wanted to quiet his mind. Something I do understand. "
“I don’t understand why we are going to this. You know I don’t like this sort of thing,”He rumbled to his blogger standing next to him.
“Oh my God, Sherlock Holmes, you are so going to get that fine arse licked tonight.” Sherlock turned a peculiar shade of red and attempted to scurry back into the safety of the dressing room.
"Good to know some aspect of reality managed to find its way into this nightmare. It is refreshing to know that you are a size queen even in your subconscious."
“No one gets my piece of arse,’
"Sherlock?"
"I did."
Restraining order. Seriously. The bastard took out a damned restraining order. I mean It wasn’t like I actually hit him with the knife. Hell I wasn’t even close to his privates. If I had wanted to cut his dick off, trust me I would have.
"Mary, love..."
"Mr. Holmes that is not why you are here!"He sputtered."This was an opportunity for you and Dr. Watson to get to know on another."
John makes a new friend and leaves a former life.
"Apparently I did coke in the bathroom while at the art show."
Supper was a simple affair, just Suga and me in the formal dining room. Lolamae had fried up some chicken and made rice and gravy. We had field peas and  ripe tomatoes. The tea was cold and sweet. She had made  pound cake for dessert which we had with coffee in the parlor.
"Good"
"Sherlock?'
"Afghanistan or Iraq?" Tall, dark and coated asked in a voice that reminded John of a jaguar or a cello or perhaps a jaguar playing a cello. God why was it so hot in here? Isn't he hot in that coat? John was quickly losing what little grip he had on reality...
"oh my god!"
"Not really. But you don't do relationships and you don't love me. Alone protects you. Sherlock I need love and affection in a marriage."
John deals with some 'tea'.
"Really never knew.You should have told me. Could have been messy business with the gloves and all..."
"Thank you Mycroft."
The Holmes are a prominent family in Gertmond. Or rather they would be if any of them had stuck around. My father was a Holmes. My mother is a Gertie. Why yes just like the town name. Yall see where I am going with this. Both families prominent. Children married. Had blue eyed little boy and called him Locky. Doesn’t make a bit of sense. My mama’s name is Eugenia Weaver Gertie but everyone has always called her ‘Suga’ ‘cause she was always so sweet. I shit you not. My daddy’s name was Emment Sherlock Holmes. He was called ‘Yank’. I haven’t the foggiest idea why. He had been called that for so long even he had forgotten how it all started. So Suga and Yank had Locky.  I really suppose I should have provided barf bags on this adventure. I should also probably let you know that while my mama is named after something sweet, no one has ever in my life called me sweet. Also in case you haven’t figured it out yet….I am light in my loafers, queer as a three dollar bill, a fudge packer. Gay.
"Yeah just standing here in the middle of sex shop with the intent of tasting various flavours of personal lubricant with my same sex partner so that when we lick each other's arses out we wont be left with a vile taste in our mouths.  Yup not embarrassing at all."
The next morning John had decided to surprise the Alpha with breakfast in bed. He wanted to make Sherlock’s favorite which required a quick trip to the market to replace the eggs the detective had used in one of his recent experiments. John did not want to know what he did with two dozen eggs. The Omega was walking down Baker Street on his way to Tesco when he spied it. There on the front page of The Sun was a picture of him and Sherlock, taken the previous day at the park. Sherlock was waving his hands like a madman explaining to John why it was important that the cake have a cream filling. And not just any cream filling but a filling from a bakery found on the other side of London. Apparently the owner owed Sherlock a favor. John was staring at his lover convinced that everyone in London owed his madman a favor. It was a good picture and John was thinking about calling the paper to request a copy of the image when he saw the accompanying article:
"Not for you daddy."smiled the youngster.
"Yeah, Greg. What's up? How is the case going?"
"How was I supposed to know it would taste like shit.  The label said Birthday Cake."
"Yes Sherlock next time......Wait, what do you mean next time. There will be no next time."
Finally Sherlock removed his hands and reluctantly placed them in his pockets.
"You mean Lestrade?"
"John," drawled out Sherlock,"I'm bored, so bored."
“Can you possibly be a little less…..”
I had underestimated just how many fucking pairs of polyester pants the ole’ gal had. Jesus Christ on a cracker this is what happens when you don’t embrace having a gay son. Didn’t Suga understand the value of a queer son as she got older. She would never be badly lit and would always look immaculate. None of this 100% Polyester bull shit guaranteed never to shrink or discolor. It took me half a day just to go through the closet and get rid of the offending items. All that was left was a fur stole and a sequined cocktail dress.
“I don’t want you to get burnt.” pleaded the consulting detective continuing his mission of covering his beloved omega in a coconut smelling paste. John felt like a giant cream pie.
John was getting stir crazy. He loved spending time with his little boy and with his mate. But there had come a time when the new family needed to get out of the house. "Sherlock we are going for a walk, get dressed."
"John? John? "
"Who the fuck is Giovanni."
John needed to shake off this defeatist attitude. He really needed to become Captain John H Watson right now. He could not be middle aged limpy GP with slightly murderous soon to be ex-wife John Watson. Nope not right now. For right now he was standing on the sidewalk outside of 221B wearing ridiculously tight vinyl trousers and some of the highest heels John has ever seen. Additionally his nipples hurt like hell. Right now John was really doubting the decision of getting both nipples pierced right before seeing Sherlock. Giovanni had said it was a dandy idea. But then again Giovanni was the one doing the piercings. Giovanni was also the one who told him his arse looked fabulous in these trousers and that of course the tight white v neck tee shirt went with them. White tee shirts are classic and besides you can see the outline of the piercings the sex store owner/ piercing god had told John. He might have mentioned that Sherlock had the same ones. It all got a wee bit blurry at some point. John was having an extremely hard time with reality right now.
"Indeed fortunately, I anticipated she might be antagonistic towards you and remembered to bring your gun."
"Before what, Sherlock?"
"True....Sherlock?"
John had fell in with the lads seamlessly. It felt good to run around and get dirty. All of the exercise had certainly helped with his midlife pudge. it was all good. John had told his mad flatmate that under no circumstance was he to interrupt his rugby practices with anything less than an 8. So far he had behaved himself. John liked to think that it was how he looked in his rather short and tight white shorts.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hmm"
"Yes unless you have another home you're not telling me about."Sherlock chuckled. God John loved to hear that man laugh. It didn't happen often but when it did, John's heart beat a bit faster. John relaxed a bit.
“No I mean the restraining order.”
“John,”
"So she had all female parts. No penises?"
Amber was not amused with yesterday's post. She muttered something about the sanctity of life or some other bullshit. It was a joke people. A little dark humor to brighten our dreary Monday! Anyway I have been moved from group. Some nonsense about not being quite ready to share in a constructive manner. Basically I don't play well with others. I also have a new therapist, a man, a very handsome man. This could be fun. Oh Boy!
" I appreciate your concern Dr. Watson. I am going to go home and think about it. Perhaps we could discuss this further tomorrow."
“I have come to nurse you back to health. I  brought my white nurse’s outfit, it even has the little hat.” I replied know full well I was winding the old bitty up.
"Sherlock explain to me why we are here exactly."
Oh dear god Dr John H Watson was going to blow and not in a good toe curling expletive spouting I just had the best orgasm of my life way. Nope. No no no. The shouty doctor was going to lose his shit.
"Sherlock what the fuck? Where did it go?Make it come back." John realized he a being a bit not good but for christ's the man was huge and well dammit he had waited long enough to have that between his cheeks.
"Do you happen to have the keys. The git didn't think to theal them."
“Fuck off.”
"What the hell are you wearing?"
They had just finished up their weekly game and were celebrating at the local. John felt the consulting detective way before he saw him. Sherlock had a way of consuming all of the air in a room and this was no different. He also happens to be sex on a stick and there is no way in hell he would not capture the attention of 12 gay males working on their third round.
"The boys will be too busy looking at that delectable arse to notice anything else,"smiled Brad.
“Anything for you. Anything.”
John carefully opened his eyes, this time steadying himself against the trousers. It just so happened that at this very moment the good detective decided to add a pirouette to his prancing routine and John found himself eyeballs to vinyl encased arse. And what an arse it was. It was like looking at two ripe vinyl covered peaches. They looked so plum and lush and juicy and Captain John H Watson found quite a bit more drool making its way out of his opened mouth. His hand had somehow wandered over to the front of his rather tight jeans and began to stroke the quickly hardening member as he began to think how lovely it would be to rut against the vinyl covered peaches. To nestle between the soft vinyl covered mounds. A sound might have escaped his mouth at this point the good doctor had lost all control of well everything. And here is where John third mistake of the evening came in. He looked down at the shoes that matched the shiny black tight vinyl trousers...He supposed they were shoes or perhaps more boot like he supposed. They were made of the same shiny black vinyl material which would explain why the detective thought they matched. They stopped mid thigh like pirate boots which John thought was fitting since Sherlock always wanted to be a pirate. There were laces up the back of the boots and the heels added a good half a foot to the already giraffe sized detective. John's hand that had moments before been caressing his rapidly hardening cock dropped by his side. And there might have been a groan heard. Hard to say because it was at this precise moment that the good doctor made his fourth mistake of the evening.
"No Sherlock I want you to stay. I WILL BE FINE!" John realized he might have said that last part a bit louder than he had intended if the turned heads and opened mouths were any indication.
"Mr. Holmes, do I need to notify your brother of your refusal to cooperate in your therapy."
Instead I am in the outer bands of hell also known as anger management therapy. Apparently I have anger issues. Really, couldn’t tell. I suppose throwing knives at your soon to be ex husband at the Golden Corral is considered to be a bit not good and seen by some as having issues with anger. Nope no problem. I was just really pissed off.
"Where am I."
"Sherlock?"
The detective fidgeted throughout the entire performance. When the time came, John covered them up with the ponchos before the blood flowed, accidentally on purpose brushing oh so lightly across the detective's very interested member. A sound that sounded quite like a moan escaped the pink swollen lips the detective had been chewing on during the play. The consulting detective was covered in a thin sheen of moisture. His erection was straining against the obscenely expensive and tight trousers he wore. His eyes looked like black onyx globes in the low lights of the theater.
“Be careful, darlin’ don’t let this place suck you dry.”She patted my hand.
There were six of us today. Four females and 2 blokes. Overall everyone was well behaved for a Monday. I have high hopes that by Friday someone will be screaming and crying. God I hope it's Amber. We talked about why we thought we were here. I am sure it had nothing to do with us trying to end our oh so rewarding and happy lives. This will not end well for all involved.
"No key. Lifted 'em from Giovanni."
Sherlock makes it home and sees things his pretty little eyes should never ever see.............
"Not really. Kind of kills the mood don't you think. Kind of like thinking about Mycroft of something." it was at the mention of his brother's name that Sherlock's python of an appendenge lost all interest in the proceedings which in turn caused the good Dr to gasp and mourn the loss of that meaty morsel he was close to having.
"I'll answer in the the cab."
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”I asked as I extended my hand.
Sherlock looked up at him and asked, "Am I a good mate to you?" John walked over to the grief stricken Alpha in alarm. What the hell brought that question on he wondered. Sherlock Holmes is many things but insecure is not one of them. "What? Of course you are. What in god's fuck is wrong?"The omega realized that perhaps he could have worded his response a bit more gentle but god dammit he was nine fucking months pregnant. He was the one who got to have the moods. He got the tears. That prat better not be having second thoughts on this enterprise. The ship has sailed. We are having a fucking baby and he ass needs to be on board for this. As John was mentally raging on in his very pregnant blond head he happened to look at his extremely fragile mate's laptop.
Mary kept babbling to Simon and whatever his wife's name was. Finally he couldn't take it.
“Yeah, fucking shame that is,”joked John trying desperately to keep the detective from bolting from the theater. It was imperative that they see this play.
"John, don't be tedious."
"Donovan! Enough!" Shouted Lestrade rubbing his eyes. He was in no mood for this. It already took eight texts and four phone calls to get Sherlock to come out without his blogger.
"Sherlock?"
I have no doubt that Sherlock would have never let Rhett out of his bed.
"Sherlock, look at me,' John gently grasped his beloved's face to make his next point."You are the wisest and best human being I have ever met. You have saved me so many times and there would not be a John Watson without a Sherlock Holmes."
"Case."
"God-dammit what the hell were you thinking?"Obviously not I thought to myself. At least I hoped it was to myself. Even in my weakened state I knew that would be a bit not good.
The good doctor cleared his throat and got down to business examining Satan’s bitch while I sat in a chair, crossed my legs, thrust out my chest and waited. It was a glorious appointment and by the end Dr. Sex was glistening. His cheeks were pink and if I had a dollar for every time he licked his lips well lets just say I would not  have needed to put that remote control vibrator on layaway. I hustled Suga out of the room so I could make my move.
"Hm..."
“You go get ‘em babe,”
"Indeed we do.....come here you and give your husband a kiss."
“Of course, anything for you.”
"Do you really think so? I need to get rid of this pudge though," John lifted up his shirt to show the offending flesh.
"John"
"Um John?'
"Nope pretty sure it is just us...."
"Listen here! Mr......."
"Can we get some silk rope while we are out."
“Sorry.”
"John? John are you alright" asked a very concerned consulting detective. John had at first found Sherlock's concern for his well being lovely but now, well let's just say there was very little John Watson found lovely. He felt bloated and nauseous and why the fuck was it so hot. He had no desire for sex and he actually growled at Sherlock when he tried to initiate some contact.
"Well that went better than I thought."
John is hot and cranky and wants to go home.
"Just a bit light headed. I need to sit a bit. I will be fine."
"Sorry??? what is brilliant?"
I apologize for any errors. Trying to finish this so I can work on a fic with one of the boys in leather booty shorts. I might have a 'leather' problem!
It was while Sherlock was busying solving another case for the Met. John had been at the clinic all day and decided to drop by to see if he could be of assistance. It was the first time he had seen Lestrade since the case after the rugby game. John was wearing his new favorite outfit. It was a blue and white striped suit tailored to within an inch of it's life. It fit like a fucking glove. He was wearing a white shirt buttoned to show a nice bit of skin and his hair was coiffed and gelled to perfection. John Watson was a walking gay man's wet dream. He had been hit on 4 times today....three just attempting to get to the crime scene. Lestrade turned to greet him and his mouth fell open.
I know. There has been no porn or plot and where the hell are the nipple rings......don't worry they will show up eventually.
John and Sherlock go off on a romantic trip to Bora Bora.
It was so nice to see that Gertmond has not changed in the years I had been gone. The last time I had been home was for my Daddy’s funeral. Victor had opted to stay home. In retrospect he was probably fucking some uneducated harlot in our bed. Water under the bridge I suppose. Any hoo my daddy was a good man. He was quiet but would speak up if someone really pissed him off. That someone was usually Suga. God that woman was sent straight from hell.
It is now that I spend the quiet moments of my life contemplating exactly what the fuck has happened. My hold on reality appears to be precarious at best. On good days it is non-existent. The dreams come nightly and the voices stay to play during the day light hours. I have given up normal and now spend the time attempting to convince my captors that I won't end my life. I won't, but I am not to be believed. I tell them it was an accident. I needed the voices to stop. I needed to rest...they smile,they nod and they write in that hideous manila folder.
I had met Victor when I too was a freshman at Ole Miss. I had spent a year traveling with a carnival as a magician's assistant and fuck toy. After a while it became tedious and I enrolled in college. I was a chemistry major and only took Victor's class because it was a requirement. He was lovely. All tanned and slicked back hair with chocolate brown eyes. I was smitten and after a year perfecting my cock sucking skills with the carnival he was smitten as well.
"Vinyl John, the trousers are vinyl."
So sorry for the delay in posting. My only excuse is that I have been busy reading so many incredible works by such talented people. There are mistakes but I needed to get this up and move on and attempt to finish this before baby Cumberbatch has a sibling!
John Watson looked at the stick again. Yup. What he thought it said. He looked at the second stick and the third and the fourth and they all said the same thing. He was pregnant. Knocked up! Up the duff! At 36 Omega John Watson was finally pregnant with his first child. He couldn't believe it. He was going to be a dad. He and Sherlock had been on suppressants for so long they thought for sure it would take more than one heat for it to happen. The consulting detective was going to be one smug bastard. One heat and wam, bam, thank you mam.
John was so done. It had been a month since the incident in the Pub. Mr. Married to my work had not said or done anything out of the ordinary. John wasn't sure what the problem was. Did the consulting detective not have a working 'gaydar'. My god even Lestrade had figured it out.
"Oh this is going to be fun."
“Fuck,” yelped the good doctor.
So the idea for this chapter was the Evening Standard Awards when there were some allegations that Sophie had thrown a fit on the red carpet.
"Who the fuck is Giovanni? Do you mean Greg?"
We pulled up to the good doctor's and I helped Suga out. She looked good. I had picked out a pair of cream slacks and a black silk blouse. We had accented the outfit with a scarf and I had rooted around in her jewelry box and found a broach for her to wear. Her blue eyes were lined in jet black and I had used a soft mauve for her lips. Her hair had been teased to within an inch of its life and set with half a can of Aqua Net. She looked like my mama instead of some trailer park inbred.
"Sorry???"
"Sherlock, you haven’t had a case since we got the results. You need this." I need this thought John. I need to get home, get these fucking hot clothes off and it in a cool bath without being poked and prodded....
I roused Suga and got busy making her look more human and less demon like. I then got to work on myself. I poured myself into my seersucker and slicked back my unbehaving curls. Normally I like to let those puppies flow, but today I needed them to behave. I was meeting the good Dr. Watson and I do like to make a good impression. Not to mention I have had many a man fall prey to that one lone curl that escapes and rests angelically across my brow.
“Sherlock, please.”
"Yes, John?'
"I think the time has come for her to perhaps live in a place where she can get round the clock care," he said carefully.
"Baker Street?"
"I don't think so but to be honest I am a bit confused."
"I can't believe Lestrade could not solve this one on his own. It was barely a three. Hardly needed to leave the flat. I could have solve this one from our bed."crowed the detective."John?" Sherlock found his blogger curled up on their bed sobbing. His face was red and blotchy and tear stained. He had never seen the doctor so overcome with sadness. "John, look at me. What happened? Are you alright? Is the pup alright?"It was then Sherlock saw John's laptop opened to his blog and quickly he began to read the comments section.
Of course I was cockblocked by the universe and my mother. The evening was progressing nicely. Suga was fed and watered and was drooping slightly during the Lawrence Welk rerun. Right on time it was 7:45. Perfect, in 15 minutes she would be safely ensconced in her floral boudoir of hell and I would be off to get off. At 7:54 all hell broke loose and that is how we ended up in the emergency room with ma in her gown and me wearing loose sweat pants and a t shirt that had a picture of chick on with with the words ‘I just got laid’ in orange sequins. Trust me the irony was not lost. And of course since we are wandering around in the outer bands of hell, the ER doctor on duty just happened to be Dr. Sex.
"What? Someone got shot?"
"Who?"
"Hmmmm"
and with that he winked. The fucker winked at me and left. This time it was me who sputtered!
This chapter is based on the first day of Sherlock special filming when Benedict was spotted and the press was asking questions about the upcoming baby.
"No I'm not and you're a high functioning sociopath so I am thinking we might be perfect for one another."
" I don't exactly remember John!"
Just a short chapter so Sherlock can get rid of the polyester before we go meet hot Dr. John.
I went up to the back of the house and let myself in with the key that was under the rock. The back porch had been enclosed when I was a baby. It had been screened in when the kitchen was added at some point. My daddy insisted that it be enclosed after I was born. He said there was no way he wanted his child to catch pneumonia attempting to get to the kitchen for food.
"Please do not tell me we are going to taste test....."
"A doctor with PTSD and a psychosomatic limp."
It was after his eyes adjusted that John saw him. The god in leather trousers.  The only person he had ever seen with such long legs had been Sherlock. John quickly pushed that thought away to fully concentrate on the sex god in leather in front of him. The sex god with thigh high leather boots and raven black curls. The sex god with cheekbones you could cut glass on, the sex god looking straight at him.
“What the matter honey,” asked a very surprised Brad
"Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes." He said to me extending his hand.
“But I do, you big git and it was kind of your brother to give us the tickets,”replied John elbowing the sulking detective in the ribs as a not so subtle reminder to lower his booming voice before Captain Watson decides to lower it for him. Most of the time John wasn’t really convinced this was good motivation. The retired Army captain suspected that his flatmate and lover  had a thing for boys in uniform.
Inside the dressing room John felt something he  had rarely ever felt since Sherlock had died. Joy. He slid the rather small piece of clothing over his bare flesh. They were tight in all the right places and made his arse look incredible, if John did say so. Hmm....he was getting a bit soft in the middle but that could be easily fixed and he had a pair of black boots left over from his previous life as a soldier. The decision was made and at the edge of 40, John Watson was going to be gay. Oh dear God was he ever going to be gay.
"He is upset because of the hate that is posted on his blog."
"I promise you no case. Just a weekend in Las Vegas...the two of us before...."
"Yes love I know....."
“You mean the therapy?”
"It was when you were planning you wedding to Mary, Didn't seem to be the right time."
"And that is the last thing I remember."
“You know as part of your deal you are to attend and successfully complete the program. Failure to do so will result in criminal charges being pressed.”
"Really." John responded watching the blush creep further up the detective's neck and across those chiseled cheekbones. Sherlock mumbled something about a cold drink and quickly excused himself from his doctor and evil twin. Both of whom watched the detective's ample backside as he sauntered off.
Our boys begin their talk.
"Crystal, brother. As you wish."
Sherlock is wearing a seersucker suit which is a type of suit common in the south. Seersucker is a cotton material and in our dear boy's case is Carolina blue with a white stripe. The caddy is a 1966 Cadillac  convertible coupe de ville in candy  apple red with white sidewalls and white leather interior.
"Yes John," she turned toward him and he could see her 'don't fuck with me now' eyes. John had zero fucks to give at this point.
"Sherlock, you know nothing will change...right!"
Sherlock swore to himself when he saw the photos. He had not noticed the photographer. He had been distracted by his adorable baby boy. He felt his heart drop. He did not want his boy to live with people lurking in the bushes taking pictures of his life. That was not a life. The little boy had done nothing but be born to the Consulting Detective and his blogger. He went to find his mate and come up with a plan to protect his young family.
"Are you alright?" The alpha asked while gently rubbing his mate to be's rapidly expanding belly.
"Perfect, It's 221B Baker Street, and Martin," said John.
“Love, I am pretty sure I won’t get burnt in that particular location. And sunscreen is not a substitution for lube.”John moaned, for his dutiful Alpha had given up on the application of said cream and now was simply moving his sunscreen covered digits in and out of his pregnant mate to be’s engorged hole. Both were moaning now and John was quite grateful to be wearing the thong. He was ecstatic that the detective was sporting a pair of board shorts with tiny skulls on them instead of his usual suits. A pair of tented board shorts, John smirked to himself.
"Used to back in uni."replied John.
"Partner?"asked Sherlock.
The post-birth micro-heats usually happened one to two days after the omega giving birth. They were short and merely helped the omega begin to heal after the ordeal of giving birth. However, they could also be used as a chance for the previously unbonded couple to quickly bond for the sake of their child. Many old fashioned people believed that children did better when be raised in a bonded household. At the very least they would go ahead and publish their 'intent to bond' papers before he started to show. There was no way in hell John Watson was going to be seen waddling around in public carrying Sherlock Holmes' pup without a bond intent....being pregnant and unbonded was bad enough. 'Fuck,' thought John,'there was no way they would be able to hide their relationship now. Great, the press are going to have a field day now!'
“I don’t trust him. He is up to something.,”whispered the detective.
"he's who Sherlock stole the handcuffs from."
“Not to my arse.”
Well, it was fun until he told me that he did not date his patients. Date? What? Uh no I just wanted a quick and dirty fuck. It has been awhile doc. Not a lot of demand for injured suicidal ex Army doctors you know what I mean. Shit! There went the fun. He asked me about the noise and the voices.He asked if they were still a problem for me. I refrained from my usual comments. Still holding out hope for the fuck.
"what? No not that. I had the strangest dream. I was married to a woman and she was pregnant and I was wearing banana pajamas."Sherlock shot up at that remark with a disgusted look about his face.
In the end they had managed to all get dressed and get the buggy and get out. It was a beautiful day. Sherlock was busily making faces at the baby while pushing the buggy. John was so proud of his mate when he took the fussy guy and held him to his shoulder so he could scent him. John had never thought he would ever see the Consulting Detective married and with a baby. He was deliriously happy.
"Back to your flat?"
"Does it involve me?"
"WHAT!"
“John?”
“Oh no Mr. Cheekbones. You are staying out of that closet. It is time. For John, remember. It is time that you be the best damned gay man you can be.”
"Yes, Greg I am gay. Out of the closet. No hiding."
The party was at a hotel ballroom. Everyone was dressed up and it was good to see Greg smiling. Even Sherlock looked like he was having fun. He and John were standing near the back of the room watching Greg attempt to dance with the rest of the yarders.
"John, not in front of the baby....and do you mean it?"
"You see my partner here loves margaritas with salt and so we decided...."
"Your child she is carrying" the detective tried another route.
John knew what he had to do. Fortunately when you run with the world's only consulting detective you learn a few tricks and meet a few people. People who know more about the workings of social media and web addresses and IPs and how to get the bastards that made his mate cry. In the end, web sites were shut down and anonymous posters were outed thanks to the tireless workings of their fan base. In the end they opted not to proceed with legal action mostly because John's water had broken.
First of all thank you to everyone for the lovely notes and kudos. It always makes my day. As always the boys aren't mine. I am merely playing with them. Also all mistakes are mine.
"Sherlock, Sherlock...Are you exciting about becoming a dad? How is Dr. Watson feeling? When will you bond?" Shouted the horde of reporters standing just outside of the poor girl's flat. This had been the first time he had been on a case since John had announced his pregnancy on his blog. To be honest Sherlock did not actually think people read John's blog. The throng of reporters and cameras currently flashing in his eyes proved that sometimes even the great Sherlock Holmes is wrong. Sherlock rubbed his temples and tried not to lash out at the crowd. That would be most definitely not good in John's eyes and could possibly upset the pregnant man. And that was something Sherlock Holmes had no intention of doing. His inner Alpha was preening under all of the attention that he had impregnated his future mate. Sherlock was shaken out of his reverie by Lestrade's voice.
"Yes of course!.....John?"
"What about your fucking MIND PALACE!!!!"
MODERN OMEGA
"Oh, this is brilliant."
"Sherlock?" John sat up quickly jostling Sherlock as he  stared at the wide eyed detective.
"Actually..."
For John. Sherlock hoped he was right. He loved his blogger with all of his heart. He had jumped to protect the man and now he was wearing make-up on his back to conceal the remnants of his time away. He never thought John would ever consider him more than a friend. John was straight. John was married. Now John was gay but was he gay for Sherlock? 'On to battle' thought Sherlock as teetered out of the store and headed out to claim his man.
"Burning?"
“Can we be naked?”
So for those of you who have actual lives and don't follow a stranger's pregnancy as closely as I, the idea for this chapter comes from the photos of Benedict and Sophie in Palm Springs or as I like to think of it. 'Palm Springs: Is that a bump under that print'. As always this is for fun and I am so very happy that our dear boy is going to be a daddy. My only hope is that their beautiful mother teaches them to speak french.
"Indeed." replied my new bestie.
shit. For the detective had decided that a black mesh half shirt tank thingee was the perfect item to go with the shiny black tight vinylness going on. John could see little pockets of  perfect snow white detective skin between the meshness. He noticed  the dusty pink of the detective's hardened nipples and the glow the warehouse lighting had on his silver nipple rings. What?  John's mind backed up a moment...nipple rings? What the fuckity fuck? He closed his eyes, opened them, rubbed them and looked again. Yup two sparkling silver rings nestled in the dusty pinkness of the nipples framed nicely by the meshness.  Quick action was needed by John and quickly. He needed to derail his current line of thinking. The line that had him suckling on the rings...tracing the pert hard nubs with his tongue. Recite the bones in the feet...just not the bones of the feet currently ensconced in black vinyl. Think of Mycroft in a thong....yes that's it. Think of something that is bound to stop all arousal dead in its tracks. Yes Mycroft in a thong...wearing boots...NO Sherlock in a thong wearing boots. NO NO NO! Think what is the one thing that always puts him off of sex....hmm Mary. Yes think of Mary. Home in bed in her flannel night gown.....
Later that week Sherlock had been invited to a boxing match at the O2 arena by Mycroft. Many people didn't know that while at Cambridge both Sherlock and Mycroft had boxed. He didn't want to leave Will and John home alone but his mate insisted. "Go Sherlock. We will be fine. It will be a nice for you and your brother to get some time together." John of course was right. He and Mycroft had a lovely time even though the fight only lasted two minutes. The next morning the skeptics were on the war path about the brutality of the sport and how Will should be taken from his negligent parents.
It all came to a head when I discovered that Miss Butterfly Cassandra Wilson was pregnant. She of course would keep the baby and of course Victor would marry her and they would live happily ever after. Small problem, he is married to a man. Actually not really a problem at all because I found out at the same time that my marriage to Victor was not legal. My stupidity with this man is astounding. I swear to you I really am a smart man. A genius in fact. I can tell things about people just from looking at them. I knew that harlot was up the duff when I saw her coming out of Victor's office. I just didn't see who impregnated her. Funny thing about that. You fuck a man for years you kind of assume they are gay. Nope. Victor Trevor is bisexual. Who knew.
The next day I would get the old bat all gussied up for her visit to the doctor. She had been telling me all about her trips to the good doctor. Apparently he was not from these parts. Had a funny accent she said. He had been married to a local girl and lived up in the old Latimer house in the country. Apparently his wife had up and ran off with the handyman they had hired to fix up the ole place. She said his name was Dr. Watson, Dr. John Watson she said. He was a former Army doctor she thought or something like that. He was very kind and always listened to her so she loved him. This Dr. Watson sounded very interesting.
"Sherlock love, babe, crumpet. WE NEED THE FUCKING KEYS to the handcuffs!". John really tried not to yell at his consulting lovely but dammit man. He needed that lovely sleeping hiding python to wake the hell up and invade Johnastan's rear alpine region NOW!
"Of course you do.....you always mattered I just couldn't....couldn't stop the noise ...the voices....the confusion"That was the part I should have kept quiet for that was
I should put a disclaimer on this chapter that the names have been changed to protect the innocent. Many of this was taken from my childhood of visiting my grandmother in the budding hell hole known as Hazlehurst GA. My family owned the oldest house in town which was built by Dr. Latimer who really was a Captain in the Confederacy. The house was miserable and it was true we couldn't sleep with the heat on and there were chamber pots in every bedroom. My grandmother was the youngest and one of her sister's was a hermaphrodite and her brother was a Klansman with a humpback.
"And that my dear doctor is why we are here."
"Hmmm?"
III. Duck
"No not at all, just that you are a young man and your mother requires serious medical attention and quite frankly I do not think it is fair for you to put your life on hold to care for her."
"Greg! Lestrade!"
"Shut it you. Besides I haven't told you the good parts."
They were the stuff smutty dreams were made of. They were vegan friendly. Made from vinyl and shiny. God they were shiny and tight. They would leave the most delicious lines on the good doctor's feet. They were high....6 inches. The doctor felt tall. Not as tall as his honey but tall enough to reach that delightful neck and hopefully just the right height for a little frot in the vinyl trousers. John felt giddy with anticipation and may have broke out in song and dance at the Emporium. Let's be honest here where else is it really appropriate to do the time warp if not in a sex emporium/piercing parlor. It was all good. John looked fucking good. He looked fuckable. He was ready to face the consulting detective until Giovanni uttered those fateful words....
"What, Sherlock?"
“Oh my god...no! just tell your fucking inner Alpha I am right beside you. Possessive Git.”
"You just said you stole the handcuffs from Giovanni."
“That is good to hear. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about your mother’s care.”
"Acidity!"
“I see you threw out the polyester pants.”
Sherlock gathered his Omega up in his arms and closed the laptop. He held his doctor until the Omega fell asleep.Quietly Sherlock left their bedroom to make the phone call.
"Fine I will go get us a cab"
For Christ's sake what was wrong with him John thought. Of all the times for his PTSD to act up, the night of his rehearsal dinner! God it was hot in here. He needed to get out. Shit...Mary.....what to tell Mary. He just needed some air, that's all. No biggie...just some air.
"What the hell are you wearing?'
"Don't be stupid it doesn't suit you. This case. The one we are working on."
"Hmm. Why", asked the Omega. Marriage was not a common occurrence among bonded pairs. It was seen more as a beta institution.
"So Doc who is this pretty boy you have been hiding from us."asked Pete.
“What if I leave town?”
I did happen to notice that she dropped several boxes of Benadryl into our cart full of fried chicken and Sanka. I did not recall Suga having allergies but perhaps this was a new thing. She and I had settled into a certain routine after her appointment with Dr. Sex. I would watch her like a hawk for any out of the ordinary craziness and she would bitch at me. I was beginning to get a bit stir crazy and horny. This had to be the longest time I had gone without a partnered orgasm since i was 12. I had run through three packs of batteries on old Buck.  I really needed to look into rechargeable batteries for him. Perhaps tonight I could sneak out after Suga went to sleep. The old gal went down at around 8 o’clock...that gave me plenty of time to find someone to take care of my own itch.
"Really John has the putrid taste of blue playdough in your mouth for a week taught you nothing."
Which is how I found myself careening out of Oxford Mississippi and heading towards the bowels of south Georgia and into the bosom of the anti Christ also known as Suga, my mother. I have not actually been in the town of my upbringing for any considerable time since I was 18. I graduated high school, left town with the magician from the county fair and never looked back.
Dr. Sex and Lockie talk (sort of)
I might have blacked out after he said young. The good doctor had a point. I mean I was a young and virile man. Now I just needed to get myself together.
I was right by the end there was screaming and crying but surprisingly enough it was not Amber. Damned! Amber did pull me aside and told me that I didn't need to always be a dick. Oh but I do I told her. She then went babbling on about defense mechanisms and letting people in. About the reason I felt the need to try to kill myself. I DIDN'T FUCKING TRY TO KILL MYSELF. IT WAS A FUCKING ACCIDENT! I JUST WANTED THE FUCKING NOISE TO STOP! God i hate Amber and her fucking pink kittens. Somebody kill me now since I am apparently shit at it.
"Who's Giovanni?"
“Ah shucks DJ you are making me blush.”
"Hey Sherlock,"yelled Lestrade,"the case? Did you solve it."
"I borrowed them from Giovanni."
"Sherlock, love come back to me"John petted the part he could reach of his leggy almost lover.
John Watson was many things but a coward was not one of them. The illustrious Sherlock Holmes had called him the bravest man he knew at John's wedding. What a colossal fuck up that had turned into. If John really had been brave he would have dumped his bride to be and ran off into the sunset with his best man.
"Not mine, shoot blanks."John mumbled against the nub.
“A what?”
“Yes, Sherlock.”
Fortunately I had made a visit to the seamstress before I left Oxford. Since I was once again single, I decided that I needed to make sure my suits emphasized my best attributes or my ass. I have a fabulous ass. It is what you might refer to as a ‘bubble butt’. It is round and perky like two ripe peaches. I made sure to have my pants tailored extra snug in that region. I also pulled out my extra slim dress shirts. Now I know most southern gentleman wear bow ties with their seersucker but I do not. I prefer to wear a simple cotton white shirt unbuttoned just enough to scandalize the church ladies and tempt the menfolk.
"Sherlock, take me home."
John arrived home to Mary singing to her daughter in the kitchen. She looked up at her husband and a slight smirk came across her face.
"Well, go get some,"she replied sourly waving him off, turning to resume her mundane conversation with Simon and company.
John and Sherlock finally get together in leather.
"Want to play some more since this idiot has managed to get himself banged up right at the beginning of the season."
We had been there for at least 4 hours and it was now approaching 1 in the morning. I had not moisturized nor conditioned and lets just say I was looking like I had been ridden hard and put away wet. The good doctor caught up with me outside of Suga's room as I was planning my escape.
"John!"
"Would it really be that bad?'
"Actually I just got tired of pretending that wasn't married to a lying bitch."John gathered up his few belongings, texted his best friend and left his former life.
"They say it isn't real. The baby. I...am tricking you. There is no way you would knowingly mate with a broken soldier. It was a mistake. You don't love me. You look unhappy. If you loved me you would smile all the time and look happy,"John rambled all of the comments as if he had memorized all of the hate directed at him.
As always no beta, don't own just playing with the boys. Of course everyone is in leather. I might have a problem. I blame Cumberbatch and those ridiculous long legs that were just made for leather and heels.
"You do know where Las Vegas is, right?"
"I want to get married,"murmured the Alpha into the blond's warm neck.
"yup"John really wasn't going to go there. Pretty sure it would be not good to go into the details of exactly what he had been planning to do with his vinyl clad sweetie. Nope not good at all.
"Mary?"
“He would say, ‘leave that boy alone, he aint hurtin’ nobody and it aint anybody’s business who he fucks.” My daddy would never say the word, ‘fuck’ but he would have told her to leave me alone.
"GET DRESSED! WE ARE GOING OUT!"
“Our baby is in there.”
They had been venturing outside of the flat less and less as John’s pregnancy progress. He was now in his second trimester and the ickiness of the previous three months was behind him. He was feeling good and quite randy which was more than fine with his future bond mate. Sherlock was a most demonstrative lover inside of Baker Street. They both had agreed that public displays of affection left them feeling a bit off….they were after all British men!
"Lestrade! Dammit Sherlock his fucking first name is Greg not Giovanni!"
"What address?"
"Well Mr. Mitchell, I think you will live. I would however suggest you stay away from slide tackling for awhile,"said John while pulling off his gloves.
"Brother mine, what do I owe this rare phone conversation to"
"Of course. Hold on...what case?"
"Do you have any lube?"
He looked at the shirt that the good detective picked out to go with the trousers and boots. It was here that one could honestly say that Captain John H Watson lost his
My mother is a lot of things but she is not a liar. She had not exaggerated a bit about Dr. Watson. The man was sex on legs. He had short golden hair that was turning shining silver. His skin was a coppery brown and his body. Oh lordy his body! He had forgone the white doctor’s coat and was wearing a blue button down with the sleeves rolled to the elbows and well fitting khaki pants. Now if my best asset was my ass the good doctor’s was his thighs. They were tight and muscular and my mouth watered at the thought of them wrapped around my head as he….Well enough of that train of thought. My already tight pants were getting a bit tighter. And while I am more of a grower than a shower, I needed to at least shake the man’s hand first.
"Just thinking about the wedding.."
"Of course I will marry you. I want the world to know that I am yours."purred the Omega rubbing his nose along his Alpha's neck taking in the rich scent.
Sherlock felt ridiculous in this get up. Fortunately the cab drivers of London did not feel the same. He was quickly picked up and whisked to his destination. Sherlock had been paying close attention to John and what he was up to on this fine Saturday. He knew that John was planning on meeting his new bestie Brad at the TomKat Klub. Sherlock was ready and into battle he went.
Baby!
"We match."
I didn’t see the doctor for some days. I spent my days watching Suga and seeing just how batshit crazy she really was. She seemed perfectly normal while we strolled through Piggly Wiggly on Saturday afternoon after our hair appointments. Suga was once again violet hued and teased and I was magnificently  mahogany hued with my curls tamed and curled with precision. I was wearing khaki pants tight enough to get the First Baptist preacher to blush and a pink shirt tight enough to get his number. Suga was wearing a lime green raw silk shift with a coordinating scarf. We looked damned good!
“Somebody took a video on their phone of you and Victor and posted it up on YouTube.”She replied. What? I was an internet sensation and I had no idea. This would not do at all.
“That was bloody brilliant!” Brilliant! Dr. Sex called me brilliant. Oh dear lord, it was going to be difficult to keep one’s hands to one’s self if he kept that up.
John knew it wasn't unheard of for Alpha/Omega couples to have children outside of bonding. It was considered more of a celebrity thing to do. The big celebrities always had children and partners but many never bonded. Sherlock had been surprisingly romantic about bonding. He wanted it to be perfect. John would never admit it but his omega was absolutely purring that his Alpha wanted to court him. They were thinking about going to one of the new 'heat and bonding resorts' that were all the rage now. Some place in the country. They had looked at one in Sussex that had gardens and made their own honey. Sherlock was very excited about the possibility of bees. John didn't have the heart to tell him that he wouldn't really have the time to look at too many things other than John's arse. It was a nice idea though. A nice suite of rooms with fresh sheets everyday. Organic meals and snacks delivered. John was mesmerized by the giant tub,  perfect for two people and built especially to be used while knotted. John sighed well maybe after the baby is born they could go to one for their anniversary. It looked now his bonding would most likely happen at the micro-heat that would happen shortly after he gave birth.
Shit just got real.
"What Sherlock...match what?'
"Mary, your wife?"
"I believe so..."and so he did. See John thought to himself. No talking is needed. However his great big doctor brain disagreed. Fuckity fuck fuck.
"Nonsense! Besides she is cheating on you and you are actually homosexual."
"Because he asked me to." And that pretty much summed up Dr John H Watson's life. He would do anything Sherlock Holmes asked him to. John also knew he was a bit gay for the mad genius, even if he didn't have a python in his pants. John was still pretty sure he did. I mean those pants he wears are really tight. Yes,  of course John looked. He was after all a bit gay.
Now some 20 years later I am back. This time to take care of the  bat shit crazy woman that used to be my mother. I might also be running away from that pesky restraining order. Everyone in Mississippi seemed to be on board with the idea of forgetting about the whole mess if I promised never to set foot in Oxford again. No problemo, I have always wanted to go back to that god forsaken place known as Gertmond Georgia to take care of my ailing mama, said no one ever.
“Seriously, Sherlock, what are you doin’ home. This is no place for you.” I always loved how Lolamae never called me ‘Locky’.
"New look husband, although I must say it makes you look a wee bit like a pouf."
The stranger was thin, dangerously thing..Ah drug addict then....hmm something else....ah yes of course, suicide attempt, accidental. Oh a kindred soul. Oh Dr. Hottie match making are you? He is a wee bit young but young I can work with. New Young Hottie blinked and sat up. Hmm not as young as first thought. This could get good. It had been way too long....damned shame Dr. Hottie was a no. I did love a good threesome and my god new Young Hottie had a pair of lips that would look sinful wrapped around my cock.
Dr. Hottie interrupted our tet-a-tet to announce that New Young Hottie, I mean Sherlock and I were going to be our own little group. Ooh cozy.
"Oh so His Nibs returns and now your're gay."
"Kill me now, please..."
"John, smell! This might work of course no salt...."
By the time the pregnant Omega made it back home his face was tear stained and red from anger. It didn't take long for the consulting detective to solve the mystery of his blogger's distress.
The Gertie house was made of heart of pine which meant no termites would ever bother it but it also meant that the damned thing could burn up in a blink of an eye. When I was a youngster the house was unpainted and had taken on a scary grey tinge one would associate with houses in horror movies.  My grandmother had at some point, painted the homestead white, which certainly perked it up a bit. Unfortunately  heart of pine and paint do not mix, leaving the house in a constant state of peeling.
"Wear the uniform."
"Indeed....John?"
"John I am sure that whatever we need to talk about can wait until one or prefably both of us gets off."
“Oh love! We have always been gay together.”
"They went with the boots."It was at this statement that the good doctor's brain went officially offline. He quickly closed his eyes somewhere deep inside him hoping that he would open them and be back in his safe warm bed with his warm wife. Safe he knew Mary wasn't. That ship had sailed when she tried to kill his best friend. The best friend who currently had resumed his prancing.
"Fucking thiar. I will just add them to his account."
Sally and Anderson were both there waiting in the foyer having just witnessed the spectacle  on the sidewalk
When Sherlock returned home John was curled up on the sofa resting. He was wearing Sherlock's dressing gown and was snoring softly. Sherlock couldn't resist and softly ruffled the sleeping man's hair. John slowly opened his eyes and smiled at his Alpha. Sherlock quickly gathered the smaller man up in his arms and breathed in his pregnant Omega scent.
"Forget about her she shot you"
John quietly slipped off of his box perch and slid down onto the cold cement warehouse floor. He could feel the big fat tears forming at the corners of his eyes. He closed his eyes and all went black. When he awoke it was black. He felt warmth and wetness and the urge to suckle. He nestle closer to the bulge and began to mouth at the warm shiny surface...
Sherlock finally meets the good Dr. Watson!
Sherlock is not a clueless as John thought.
"Yes I remember" followed by another squeak/moan as John decided to answer all questions without releasing the detective's now bright pink and very hard nub.
"Yes, they are still around," I replied. I told him about the constant buzzing in my brain. About the voices making comments about everything around me like a play by play account of my dreary existence. He asked how I usually would quiet the noise.
"Married? To a woman? But you're gay!"
“Neither did I .”
"Right so it is so why are you wearing shiny black tight vinyl trousers on a Wednesday?"
"John are you awake?"
"Umm...good, I think. His highness is still inside tormenting the staff. How have you been?" John just giggled at Lestrade's attempt to make eye contact while at the same time not make eye contact."You look good."
"Love to."Just then Mr. Cheekbones decided to swan out of the building, took one look at the blushing DI and the dandied up doctor."Oh for god's sake, leave him alone. Haven't you collected enough numbers for the day."sulked Sherlock.
"Jooohn, you said we needed to talk. I just assumed" the limp detective whined.
"Not really i knew you always used latex free gloves."
"It is technically Wednesday John not Tuesday..."
John tried very hard to saunter seductively in his army boots but he was in a fucking hurry to get to his honey in leather before the pumped up beefcake snatched him up. Fortunately, Mr. Sex in leather was still quite prickly on Not Johns touching him and beefcake was sent off with a seething deduction about a rather small appendage. John smiled and thought ‘that’s my boy’. Unfortunately the good doctor had begun to pick up quite a bit of speed in his quest to Mr. Sex and well, things did not go down exactly how John had pictured, in his quite frankly pornographic mind. Let’s just say that if you mix a short determined Army doctor in leather shorts with a rather tall consulting detective perched on very high stiletto boots, bad things can happen if you are not careful.
“But I need to touch you,”whined the Alpha.
“Thank you! That is not what most people say when I deduce them.’
“Oh fuck it,” replied the always eloquent doctor and just went with his gut or in this case his rapidly filling cock and kissed Mr. Sex. He kissed him in the X rated, oh my god this is the best porno ever way. Sherlock quickly figured out what was happening, adjusted his hold on the good doctor’s arse and settled in for the foreseeable future. Brad just stood there and smiled and maybe checked out an arse or two.
"Let's go then. Later boys, duty calls."John yelled as he left the pub. Sherlock waited until they had got out onto the pavement before asking the million dollar question.
"Love you, always have."
We are at the end. This chapter is based on events this week. I am constantly amazed at the stories the 'skeptics' keep telling themselves. I personally hope that the Cumberbatches go on to have a long and happy marriage.
"Let's go"he said grabbing John's arm and pulling him away from the DI.
"About what" the detective opened his sea blue orbs to see what exactly had gotten into his new lover. He was mostly naked and handcuffed and aroused. Sherlock did not understand what there was exactly they needed to discuss. Ah the wife. He had forgotten all about John's wife in the excitement to leave the warehouse and get John as naked as quickly as possible. Sherlock is many things but he is not stupid. There was no way in hell he was going to have a talk with a Dr. John H Watson while they were naked and handcuffed in bed.
"They fucking think it is a doll. They fucking think our precious baby boy is a fucking doll. They don't believe i was pregnant. Shall I show them my stretch marks. Do they fucking want to see my incision. A fucking doll. Our precious precious baby boy is a fucking doll!"roared the omega."They will fucking pay for this. THIS IS WAR."
Sherlock had been stunned and then hopeful when his flatmate had come out. Now he was just stunned. He thought John was hinting that he wanted a relationship with him but he had been wrong before. Apparently he is the one gay male in London with a faulty gaydar. He knew about the French. It is so hard to decide: are they gay or are they French. Americans. Now that should be easy….nope! He did not factor in the Southern American male. He had no idea one could dress in a blue seersucker suit with a bow tie and wear sockless loafers and talk with a slight lisp and still be straight. The bruise on his precious cheekbone proved otherwise. This was all so confusing and here he was: a certifiable genius consulting with a man named Bo Bo who currently was wearing hot pink spandex leggings and a feather boa. Nothing else unless you count the enormous amount of eye make up and hair gel.
“My God DJ, you have gotten fat!”
"John you were having a nightmare. You were thrashing about the bed. Yelling about a key and shouting Giovanni. Who is Giovanni?"
My cousin Dorothy Jean works for the good doctor and I had not seen her since my daddy’s funeral. She was a large woman with an equally large bust and a tendency to squash my face into the large boobs. I think it was her way of attempting to turn me straight. Obviously it did not work. Today I was prepared. The hair could stand a lot of things but boob squishing was not one of them. I approached her and did the cheek kiss thing. Southern women love this. It makes them appear to be more cultured than they really are.
The resort was private, Mycroft Holmes had made sure of that when his baby brother had called about his distressed mate to be. Mycroft liked John a great deal and he would do anything to make sure his brother and his Omega were happy. However, private resorts are not necessarily known for being high paying and there is always someone who can be depended upon to do the wrong thing. In this case it was a young boy of about 17, a beta who needed money for his family. His alpha father had run out on the family after his mother had failed to produce an Alpha heir. Mycroft felt for the lad but there were limits and unfortunately he had reached them with the British Government. One does not take photos of a pornographic nature of Mycrofts’ baby brother and intended bond mate. Even the photos of John in the red thong with Sherlock rubbing sunscreen on his distended belly was a bit much for Mycroft. He would never allow these photos to see the light of day.
