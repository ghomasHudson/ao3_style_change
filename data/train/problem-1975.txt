He was pulled back out of it sometime later by his phone buzzing. Lestrade. He sighed and accepted it. A case would be good, probably. If it was interesting. Otherwise, he was content to stay in the flat and let his brain tear itself apart.
John pressed a hand to his forehead. Usually when John said his name like that, in that tone of voice, it was with exasperated warmth. Sherlock sensed no warmth this time. Anger and annoyance and something else underneath. Sadness, emptiness.
It only took Sherlock a week before he got bored. The week was spent being catered to by Mrs. Hudson and lying on the couch in a stupor. He was still in shock that John did what he did, and so spent most of his time thinking over everything. He thought so hard that his brain ached and turned to jelly but he still couldn’t think of a resolution. A few times he got high, and that only served to exacerbate his feelings of self-loathing.
I know it's late, sorry. I don't know when I'll have the next chapter up. Hopefully soon, but...I may get busy. We'll see. Anyways, it'll be up as soon as possible. Also, John should actually be in the next chapter instead of a vague presence in Sherlock's mind.
“It is a science, John,” Sherlock said, affronted. “But to answer your previous question. I did not trust my deductions because I feared my, ah, emotions were getting in the way.” He scowled when he said ‘emotions.’ John found it incredibly endearing.
Wiggins was flung over the couch when Sherlock returned, strung-out and glassy-eyed. “Did you save any for me?”
The office was painted a turquoise colour. There was a stained-glass window at the bottom of the wall opposite the door. The side walls were cut in a way that the rooms next door were visible only through slits at the bottom. Sherlock figured that the blue was supposed to be aesthetically pleasing, but it’s resemblance to the light in the aquarium set his teeth on edge. The window was nice enough, the floor slits weird. The chairs were brown leather and not nearly as nice as his own chair back in his flat.
They woke up wrapped around each other. John was using Sherlock’s chest as a pillow and Sherlock had his fingers in John’s hair. Sherlock knew, or rather felt, that John was awake. He smiled at the thought of John lying there, just enjoying his company.
He pressed the butt of the cigarette against a nearby brick wall, not caring that it probably wasn’t the best idea, and threw it into the street. His hands were so cold at this point that he could barely open the package. He tried, fumbling, until finally he managed to pull out and light another cigarette. It admittedly wasn’t his choice brand, but right now he didn’t mind. He wished he had his gloves. Those were back at the flat. He held the cigarette between his lips and rubbed his hands together, trying to bring warmth into them. He had stopped shivering, now numb with cold.
When John reached the altar, his smile didn’t break. Mycroft cleared his throat. The room fell completely silent. Sherlock shifted a little, tugged at the sleeves of his suit. Waited.
“Bad memories,” Sherlock said, not wanting to bring them up but desperately not wanting that song to be played.
This chapter has mild drug use. It talks about the time after Mary dies and how Sherlock turned to drugs. A slight mention of suicide as well.
Sherlock widened his eyes, a thought coming to him. “That’s why you like the morgue. You can talk to the bodies.”
“John Watson,” Sherlock said, smiling brightly. “For my second gift to you, I give you the honour of being my boyfriend.” John couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Boyfriend? “If you want, of course,” Sherlock added, mistaking his silence for uncertainty. John lunged out of the bed and tackled him, nearly knocking both of them to the floor. He brushed Sherlock’s sleep-mussed curls out of his eyes.
A shower actually sounded quite lovely, so Sherlock stood up. His hair fell greasily into his eyes, and a twinging in his ribs reminded him that they were very much not healed yet.
“You have before,” John said. “You’ll be fine. You’re Sherlock Holmes, remember?” Normally, when John would say that, it was complimentary. But there was nothing but malice in his voice, now, and the words stung Sherlock more than he’d care to admit. “You can do anything, apparently. Cheat death.”
“I plan to do that. I may not be your housekeeper, but I do care about you.” Sherlock blinked tears out of his eyes. “Now, let’s play another game of Cluedo before I go back downstairs.”
“I think that’s enough talking for tonight.” Sherlock stood up and went to stand near John. The rain had picked up while they were talking. It lashed against the windows, blurring everything outside. The streetlamps shone yellow, reflecting off the wet pavement. Sherlock felt drawn to it. He was suffocated, suddenly. Maybe it was the sight of John crying. Maybe it was the heartbreaking noises he made. Maybe it was the fact that everything was suddenly catching up to him. Whatever it was, he wanted to go outside and drown in the night. He wanted to wander the streets of London and sort everything out. He wanted to stop thinking. He wanted John to love him. He wanted to go back in time. Back to before his fake death, even. Back to when it was just the two of them against the rest of the world.
“Thank you.” Sherlock stood up abruptly, making his way to the open casket. The line was small, and so he stood behind it. Olivia was near the front, clutching the wood. He waited patiently, thinking about evidence. He could solve this murder. He knew he could.
Sherlock was secretly pleased, now that he thought about it, that John turned it off. He didn’t particularly want John to leave. He didn’t protest again when John reached over and skipped it. After Christmas, then what? The holiday spirit put John in a good mood. Sherlock knew that. But afterwards? John might decide that he hated Sherlock again. It was a likely outcome. Tears suddenly came to Sherlock’s eyes, and he blinked furiously. His heart grew heavy, realising that John only had one more full day left with him. In less than forty-eight hours he’d leave. Sherlock didn’t even know if he’d see John again.
Her expression softened as she reached for his hand. “Whatever happened, you two better ‘kiss and make up,’ as I believe the saying goes.”
“Good.” John kept doing it. Sherlock sighed and curled up even tighter. He normally would have shied away from all forms of physical contact, particularly ones like this which made him seem very vulnerable. But he was too tired to pretend like he didn’t like it, and he was too tired to pretend like this wasn’t something he had been needing for years.
Sherlock sighed. “John, please. Lestrade merely pointed out that my speech sounded like a love confession. And I realized that he was right. Any more questions?”
“I missed you too,” Sherlock said, a lump forming in his throat. His voice had gone gravelly. “You were right to blame me.”
Alan Turing was a mathematical genius who helped to win World War II, but was chemically castrated due to him being homosexual. After a year of this, he died by eating an apple laced with cyanide. The presumed cause of death is suicide, but it's not certain. He died 7 June, 1954.
John was up and off the couch in a second. “Hey. Sherlock. Hey. It’s okay. It’s going to be okay. We’ll fix this, okay? We can do it. We’ve survived so much together. We can get through this too. It starts with conversation, right?” John’s voice was panicked but it sounded so very far away. Sherlock grasped at his hair. John’s arms were around him and picking him up. Sherlock fought against him, but John somehow managed to take him over to the couch and bury Sherlock’s face in his chest.
They had more physical contact than usual. John was usually the one who initiated it, but Sherlock sometimes found himself leaning against him while watching a movie or brushing his arm or hand when they were cooking. Sherlock broke down twice out of overwhelming emotion, and John was able to hug him properly until he felt better. All in all, it was very good for both of them.
“I had to,” Sherlock said quietly. “You don’t-I’ve never said what happened to me whilst I was away, but you were the only thing that kept me from going insane. I don’t mean like in the movies. I mean that I probably would have shot myself for real if you weren’t waiting for me. Or worse. I don’t want to think about what I would’ve done. Don’t you see, John? I had to pretend you were okay with it, I had to expect you were okay with it.” That barely brushed the surface of what he had gone through when he was taking down Moriarty’s web, but he couldn’t talk more about it. Mycroft had forced him to go to a therapist for months after he got back, until he convinced everyone he was fine. And he was fine, now. He hadn’t deleted the memories, because they wouldn’t go away (annoying), but he’d locked them away so that they couldn’t hurt him.
The line went silent. John put his head in his hands, feeling more lost than ever. Where would Sherlock even go?
Sherlock looked at him for a moment too long. Mrs. Hudson peered at him curiously. “John,” he said, clearing his throat. “Then why are you here? Obviously,” he gestured to his ribs, “it wasn’t your choice.” The silence in the room was thick and awkward. Sherlock tamped down a strange surge of anger. He deserved what John did, he knew that. Then why did he feel angry about it?
He was sorting through a few files on John in his mind palace when he remembered. His birth certificate. Sherlock pressed his eyes closed even tighter, recalling the exact words on it.
“That was an awfully long shower,” Wiggins remarked. Sherlock scowled at him. “I assume you want me to move out?”
The beginnings of a headache started at the base of his skull. This was not the way he’d imagined spending John’s birthday. The uncomfortableness would be there, of course it would, but there would be talking and laughing and maybe telling old stories. Maybe John would talk about his previous birthdays. Maybe John would tell him about what he used to be like, before the war and before Mary. Sherlock knew that the war irrevocably changed him, of course it did, but to what extent? What was John Watson like before?
Finally he gave up, sinking into his bed, and was asleep within minutes. Normally Sherlock didn’t sleep. Sleeping was boring. But he had been out on a case with Lestrade for the past few nights, barely sleeping, and for once he was exhausted.
“Surely you know who I am?” Sherlock glared at him. He rearranged his expression to look frightening, menacing, and thrusted his phone towards the officer. The officer gulped and signalled for him to go in.
“Oh. Good.” John felt Sherlock pressing his face even more into his hair. He moved himself a little closer, allowed himself to burrow more into Sherlock’s complying arms.
“I’m fine,” he said, again. “Goodnight.” He set one foot on the stairs, then the other. Still wobbly, but he figured he could manage to get up to his flat.
And then Sherlock realised it. “You needed the money,” he said dully. “Mycroft offered to pay you again, didn’t he?” Mycroft raised a hand, but John interrupted him.
After they were done eating and cleaning up (“you have to do something to help, Sherlock.” “What for?” “I’m not your maid”) they got Rosie dressed and went to retrieve everything from John’s old flat.
Sherlock frowned. He didn’t understand why people thought therapy was helpful. This wasn’t helping him at all. “What I should do. I killed his wife.”
They separated again, breathing heavily. “I really need to go,” Sherlock said, as gently as he could. John sighed but didn’t argue. Sherlock slowly stepped away and held out his hand.
He returned his focus back to the front of the room. Someone was speaking. Molly, he thought it was. He listened for a moment. Yes, it was Molly. She was saying something about how Mary was a good friend and mother.
The room smelled faintly of John. Dust swirled into his mouth as he switched on the light. He coughed. He hadn’t allowed even Mrs. Hudson to come clean. The bed was neatly made, the sheets and blankets tucked in the corners with the military-precision Sherlock had expected from John. He placed the chair underneath the window. The wardrobe in the corner stood slightly open. A few of John’s old jumpers hung inside. Sherlock crossed the small room in a few steps, coming to a stop in front of it. He could see John standing there, right where he was. Could see him picking out what to wear for the day. He shook his head, his curls almost falling in his eyes. He hesitantly reached into the wardrobe and pulled out one of the jumpers. The soft material spilled over his hand and he brought it to his face. The John smell was stronger on the jumper than it had been in the room. He was aware of the dampness of the jumper on his cheek, aware that there were tears in his eyes. He sat down on the bed and clutched at the jumper, shoulders heaving. John. John. john. John put him in the hospital. John knew what he was doing, he was a bloody doctor. John
Sherlock was certain that his face flushed. “I wasn’t staring.” He injected as much disdain into his voice as he could muster. Which unfortunately, wasn’t very much.
“Really? Because I heard that you were in love with me,” John hissed, and Sherlock stopped breathing. He couldn’t respond. “Which is, if I’m being honest, weird, Sherlock.”
“Me too,” John said softly. “Christ, Sherlock, I almost lost you. Many times. I don’t-I don’t know what I would have done if I did.”
“For...what? For you to get in another relationship? Why are you asking me this? Surely you know that I think it’s far too late.” Sherlock’s stomach plunged. Maybe John would break up with him now. Annoyance flickered over him. John should have said something earlier, before all this started. Sherlock didn’t think he could bear to lose John now.
“Yes, you were! I saw how you looked at her, how you treated her like a puzzle that needed to be solved. The same way you treat your bloody work. And you love your work.” The jealousy thickened with every word that came, unbidden, out of his mouth. He knew that he was being insensitive, that Sherlock had just lost someone, but he was incapable of shutting up.
Anger and hurt flared in Sherlock, bright and white-hot, and before he knew it he was snapping back at John. “I don’t need you.” Sherlock’s voice was low, brimming with anger. “I don’t need any of you. I was fine alone. I preferred being alone.” He
Sherlock hesitated. He hadn’t been out of the flat since he overdosed on the case. It would do him well to get fresh air. On the other hand, he was a long way from recovering and was still very shaky. “Okay,” he agreed, finally.
“Sorry, but you’ve-your hair is-” John was still smiling, but his words came out more halted than usual. Sherlock patted at his hair. Sure enough, it was tangled and ruined from sleep. He sighed.
“You gave him a place to live, and in return, he provided what you needed to get high?” Mycroft frowned at him.
Water ran in rivulets over his skin and dripped into his eyes. It was embarrassing, sitting in the shower like that. It was embarrassing that sharing a bed with John made him feel like this. John didn’t deserve him, he didn’t. He was glad John told him he was still angry, but it hurt. After all, he did it to protect him. When would he and John stop hurting each other? It was a vicious cycle that cut him to the quick repeatedly.
John laid next to Sherlock. He yawned. Sherlock found it endearing. “I hope you enjoyed today as much as I did,” John said, softly.
Saying John’s kiss was surprising would be an understatement. Which is why he wasn’t surprised all that much when John pushed him away.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said. “The apology helped. I think it will simply take time.” John’s face fell at that. He wanted to help, that much was obvious. Sherlock wanted to forgive him. He wanted to tell John that he loved him and that he forgave him and that he’d never leave him, but that would surely be unwelcome and wouldn’t be wise when John was so worked up. And something was stopping him. He wasn’t quite ready to forgive John-not yet-but he understood why John didn’t say anything, sort of, which definitely helped. “Why did you do it?”
John nodded. “Can I ask a question? It’s sort of related.” Sherlock waved his hand for John to continue. “You said the cases hit a bit close to home, but you never-I was just wondering...” he trailed off.
“Yes, I did, because you left for no reason. I was waiting for you,” John burst out, frustrated with his lack of helpfulness. He appeared to be determined for John to make the first move, but he wasn’t giving John anything to go on.
John pushed the door open. He sucked in a breath when he saw Sherlock, who was curled beneath a blanket. Only his messy curls were visible. For a moment, John imagined walking over and curling beneath the blanket with him. He was probably warm, and John was tired.
Drizzle fell on his face as soon as he stepped outside. He tilted his head back and let the rain fall. It was cooling, refreshing, compared to the cold, dry interior of the aquarium. He took a deep breath, then another. His breath was shaky. He finally let himself cry, hot tears mingling with the cool water.
“This morning,” Molly said. A tear slipped down her cheek. “Estimated time of death was sometime last night. Bullet wound.”
Mild violence/gore in this chapter. Also, I’m not a doctor. I did my best but there may be factual inaccuracies.
“Oh, for gods’ sakes, John!” Sherlock snapped. John raised his eyebrows. “Alan Turing was a mathematical genius. He helped solve Enigma, which pretty much won World War II.”
Sherlock watched him leave the room, gazing at the door long after it closed. He had no idea where to go from here. Should he find John? John obviously didn’t try to find him. He sat there, thinking, until Mycroft poked his head back in.
and everything slipped into place. The morgue. The perfect place to hide bodies. He owned the hospital. It would be so easy for him to pretend someone had died and hide the bodies. He had built up an image, had become trusted by so many people.
Clara leaned against the wall next to Sherlock. “I’m glad you two finally got together,” she told him. “You deserve that.”
Sherlock shook his head, feeling ashamed all of a sudden. “I am a genius, John, but I don’t know everything.”
“Cleaning,” Sherlock said, trying and failing to hide the wastebasket from him. John reached in and pulled out a receipt.
“Well,” Sherlock said. And then he leaned over the side of the couch as his stomach tried to empty itself on Mycroft’s shoes. Nothing came out, but Mycroft recoiled anyways.
“Brilliant.” Sherlock pushed back out through the door, Olivia at his heels. The door slammed shut behind them. Across from the small building was a park with a forested area in the middle. It was the perfect place to conceal something. Or someone. Olivia followed him as he dashed across the street. The trees were packed close together. A dim shaft of light filtered through the gloom. A small body laid on the ground. The figure was half covered with leaves. Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat and he didn’t miss the way Olivia gasped and covered her mouth. He knelt down next to the body and brushed a few leaves away. Madison was still breathing faintly, shallowly, her eyes closed.
“Sherlock Holmes.” He didn’t have to wait long before the figure of a person emerged from the shadows. “I knew you’d find me.”
John closed his eyes as Sherlock wrapped himself back around him. He realised he was getting tired, but one more thing was plaguing his mind. He understood the consequences but decided to ask it anyway.
Harry looked genuinely disappointed, a little line forming down her brow. “Actually, what I wanted to hear was some sort of lovey-dovey nonsense so that I could rip the shit out of you and never let you forget it, so no. You're such a let down.”
A brief moment where Greg genuinely seemed to consider it – but no, he was pushing himself up off the armchair and rubbing his hair roughly with his hands, shaking his head and grinning almost as if wondering how he had let it get this far. "Nah, no, y'know what? I can't do it. He has to do this himself, it's not fair on him -"
..." Something flickered behind Jim's eyes, something undefinable, "...and having to trust them implicitly not to spark the flame."
"I think he's been here quite long enough now to no longer be counted as a guest, Mummy," Mycroft drawled from by the toaster, not even bothering to look up from his phone. "If he wants to help then let him, by all means."
Rolling his eyes as he laid back on his bed (at 9:30pm, for the love of all that was holy, it was THAT bloody awkward to sit with his parents and watch television), John exited Mycroft's pleas for help and hovered his thumb over Sherlock's text conversation window, hesitating a little as he considered what he would say. They hadn't spoken since their little spat this morning and although he was too exhausted – both physically and emotionally - to care about the whole situation he was unsure if Sherlock would be as receptive to communication as Mycroft seemed to think. He didn't want to have to deal with drama, with Sherlock being stiff and unyielding, and if he opened that can of worms now and found himself faced with a grumpy child he would almost definitely lose his patience.
"You really are an idiot," John said in exasperation, half-laughing as he dragged his palm down his face, "really, Sherlock, sometimes you are
Without a single moment spared, John released his grip on Sherlock's hand and steadily made his way back over to the mince which was now brown, burned and bubbling amidst some very, very hot tomatoes. His hands betrayed him as they picked up the spatula, trembling enough that he had to close his eyes for just a minute to bring his racing heart back down to earth and cease the shaking fingers that slowly wrapped themselves around the handle of the frying pan.
Eyes widening and mind unable to keep up, John shoved past the shrubbery and gripped the ledge of the windowsill, throwing his leg over into the open window and throwing his body weight into the empty space inside; he fell through gracelessly, staggering as he dragged his other leg through and finding himself quite without balance as he reached out into the dark room for something to grab onto -
John barked out a quiet laugh, still distinctly uncomfortable. "Nothing like I've had before, but... yes, I'm pretty sure we could call ourselves friends now."
"How lovely," Brooke said smoothly, raising her glass to her lips and taking a small sip. "I was rather expecting him to bring a lady friend with him, if I'm to be honest, after you called me up to let me know to expect one more guest from the Holmes party."
Sherlock's eyes travelled slowly down to the vegetables and mincemeat sitting on the counter. "You want me to cook for you."
"Yep," he said with a weak smile, rubbing his palm to his eyes. "That's about where I am too at the moment."
"Yes, you did," John clarified with a shrug, his voice suddenly far quieter and almost achingly hollow, "so don't bother denying it. You were angry at me for being there, for... what happened. So you saw it as only fitting that you make it impossible for me to want to stick around. Me being here just reminds you of what sent you here in the first place. You took all of that anger and you directed it right back at me." His sentences were short, to the point. He couldn't hash about with sugar-coating. There was obviously no point. "Don't tell me you weren't trying to hurt me when you think it's the very thing that I deserve."
Sherlock's eyes darted between John's fumbling and the stairs. "I'll be upstairs. I have a lot of work to do."
Somehow, an hour later, they managed to pull together a dinner that was actually quite tasty. There had been a few moments of panic ("John, I forgot to switch the oven on at the socket." - "John, the chicken smells funny, is it supposed to smell like that?" - "John, the chicken is still pink, should I put it back in?" - "John, the little red light on the oven has gone out, I think I broke it.") and the chicken ended up a little overcooked, but generally speaking it was a dinner that was worth the time it took to make. Greg brought down his television from his bedroom and set it up on the coffee table, connecting up John's laptop to it via HDMI cable and putting on some sort of British black comedy which had both Greg and John chuckling through mouthfuls of food and even had Sherlock briefly smirking from time to time (before realising his fatal error and returning his facial features to a look of mild indifference). Sherlock only had half a chicken breast and a few mouthfuls of rice but, considering he had actually eaten a proper meal the day before, it was an impressive effort and made even better by his rave review of 'it wasn't entirely offensive on my pallet'.
John shook his head, nausea beginning to creep into the crevices of his stomach. "I'm fine, Sherlock, really."
Sherlock looked down to his navy shirt and saw that Mycroft was indeed right; a streak of blood arced over his chest, though for the life of him he couldn’t think of where it had come from or a point where John’s hand had connected with his person. “I’ll have to throw this away.”
Sherlock looked at him intently, uncomprehending. “I don’t understand why this bothers you so much.”
sing. It wasn't particularly loud, more of a hum with an occasional smattering of words thrown in, but as soon as 'Here Comes The Sun' by The Beatles came on Sherlock seemed to forget that he was sitting less than a metre away from John and began crooning away to it in a voice that not only amused John but also, in its own way, endeared him to his friend. He wasn't a particularly
The shorter man sighed, moving around Greg to stand in front of the fridge; he reached in, grabbing the jar of green pesto and the soft cheese. "Like this. The green stuff is the pesto, the white stuff is the mascarpone."
She observed him from across the desk, looking no more harmless than a fly yet already she had somehow slipped from him information he had been intent not to release. He had underestimated her. "Most of the time I hear that people have been encouraged to seek counselling by family members, close friends, people who have seen you at your best and your worst and have seen the process of change before their very eyes. It says here that your addiction started at…" she glanced down at the piece of paper in front of her, "…seventeen. You've known John for a significantly small period of time since your struggle began and yet he's the only one who has managed to have an effect enough to convince you that you should consider coming to see me. Not only did you consider it but you're sitting here in front of me. It's interesting."
to put it mildly. John had stared at the colour-coded spreadsheet of intensity for at least five minutes, certain that there must have been some sort of mistake – there was at least five hours work included on the first day alone, including reading course material that John had never even set eyes on before which was covered in notes that ranged from insanely detailed to snarky and sarcastic.
been a while since I've made one... it's not as if anyone else is ever really around to eat it!" The knot came back. "Usually it's a ready meal for one... yes, all right, shepherds pie it is!" Her tone changed dramatically, brightening, the facade back in full force. "I'll even get some cream to make the mash, spoil you a bit."
Mycroft was completely out of the door now, hand on the outside handle, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Hmm. You’re probably right. How glad I am that I don’t have such ridiculous desires to distract me.”
"Compromising." John shook his head slowly from side to side, head starting to hurt. "No. No, it wasn't like that. It's not what you're thinking."
There were nine of them in all, nine young adults crammed around the kitchen table like sardines, each of them staring at the currently empty pint glass in the middle of the table as Greg spread out not one but
get to choose someone to take a drink. Hmmm." His index finger and thumb came to rest on his jaw, eyes swivelling around the circle as he pretended to think. "Whoooo shall I pick?
me, but of course you can't help me, an utterly ridiculous notion that someone like you could help someone like me -"
Sherlock walked a few steps further ahead, only stopping when he realised that John wasn't immediately following. "You ask like it's a bad thing."
John's grin widened slightly, feeling the stress ebb somewhat; he had no idea how William did it, it was... odd.
John let go of his glass and began to shake his head violently, not having it, not one bit. "I'm not fucking kissing him, Greg, I am
"Right." The two young men stood opposite each other, staring awkwardly until finally Mike took a step away. "I should probably get to my lecture, but if you get your phone fixed just drop me a text about next Friday, yeah?"
John's hand curled into a fist by his ear, a small grunt of pain from the man's lips as he felt the repercussions of his actions. "I can't."
My intentions to aid you in your academic failures were clear in each e-mail I sent to you, therefore I saw no need to respond. It would have been a perfectly ridiculous waste of my time.
"Fantastic, fantastic." Sliding his chair over to his computer, Jim started clicking and typing. "So that'll be... Monday and Thursday of next week aaaaand..." he clicked and typed some more, "Monday and Wednesday the week after. Same time as today. Does that work for you?"
The silence this time was not one of hesitation but one clearly of disdain. "Though it comes to no surprise to me that he should refer to me that way, I do wish he would at least try to remain civil. Regardless, yes, that is who I am. And you are, as we have already established, John Watson -"
He cut himself off from his intrusive inner-monologue and focused again on the conversation, keeping his eyes firmly fixed upon his mother. “I'm not exaggerating. I have depression, am depressed, am... struggling.” He took in a deep breath, putting down his knife and fork and moving his fingertips down, placing them against the edge of the table and pressing hard against the tablecloth. “I'm going to counselling.”
"Mm. No, because, when you say you're fine..." John was slowly pushing himself off of the bed, looking at Sherlock with almost the ghost of a smile on his lips, "you tend to be lying. So. Yeah. If you're not fine, just tell me."
something?" John violently stabbed a few more pieces of pasta, shoving them in his mouth and practically swallowing them without chewing; he'd learned quickly that if Sherlock was in one of these moods it was unlikely that he'd be there long enough to enjoy – or even finish – his meal. "We might as well have stayed at Well Place."
It all sounded so… romanticised. Like he was talking, not about their friendship, but about the undercurrent stemming from the dark-haired genius that neither one of them were willing to admit to each other. He had no idea where it was all coming from, these words, but even as he said them he realised how true they were and how all along this had been how he'd felt and what he'd been wondering from the start. It was, as Sherlock had so rightly said, absurd.
"My first? Oh..." The meaning sunk in; John cleared his throat, uncomfortable. "I don't really... is that really something you want to know?"
John could only stare at Greg, at the open palms offered to him with this piece of scattered information upon them, a piece of information that he was now apparently supposed to accept and comprehend. The words couldn't quite click into place. The meaning was lost.
"What makes you -" Sherlock wobbled slightly but regained his balance with a huff as he leapt onto the third rock, face twisting momentarily in surprise. "Ugh. What makes you think you need to look out for me?"
Tim chortled to himself, leaning out of his window momentarily. "Looks like you weren't wrong about Greg being a bad influence on him, dear."
"Well, I guess that means you're not my type then," John teased with a grin; he couldn't swear to it, but there was a definite twitch to Sherlock's lips that could have almost been a smile. "Really, Sherlock, it was one night of sex and never hearing from each other again. Meaningless."
a few inches; they were being led by a man who looked terribly like a maitre d' through an odd alcove underneath the staircases and, despite all that he had seen so far, he had genuinely not expected to feel quite as small and as awed as he did upon entering the room that had been their destination all along.
Holmes brother, he more than understood why he remained two steps behind, silent. John grimaced at him just as Mycroft took a step forward.
Sherlock's face suddenly widened into a huge grin, his grip tightening even more on John's arms as he gave him one final, resounding shake. "Life, John! Life itself!" Suddenly he was moving closer, so close that John could smell the wine on his breath, feel the warmth of the taller man's every exhale ruffling the top of his hair; Sherlock's face came within inches of his, leaning down slightly until he was perfectly at eye-level. "Let me show you how I live it!"
"So, if you'll have me..." Sherlock's hesitation was palpable, his lips mouthing words before he spoke them as if making sure they were the right ones; John found he was suddenly able to lip-read, or in the very least he knew which words would come before they arrived in the space between them. "If you'll forgive me... I would like to resume our friendship and do with it what we can in the rubble of destruction that I have left behind."
Mycroft looked between them for a moment before making a low noise in the back of his throat, clearly beyond finding their little camaraderie amusing. “Ugh. Please don’t make me take back what I said earlier, John, I would so like to believe that you’ll be a good influence on my little brother.”
Three pairs of eyes flickered to the youngest Holmes, shock crossing both Wanda and Tim's expressions and mere exasperation spasming on Mycroft's at the words so briskly uttered; John continued to eat as if Sherlock had not just revealed a hugely personal piece of information to his perfect parents at a time when it was highly, devastatingly inappropriate, trying to force down a mouthful of chicken and cauliflower so that he could speak. "Mm, excuse me – yes, Dad struggles with alcoholism," he verified, still refusing to look at the young man who was supposed to be – in his eyes at least – his friend, if only so his anger could remain subdued enough to continue this conversation, "but he's going to group sessions and working through it. I'm sure once he's back with us properly he'll be able to vocalise how he feels about my career choice."
"Watson," he said, feeling distinctly uncomfortable to have the dignified man's eyes so suddenly upon him, "John Watson."
"I know you're going through something right now, Sherlock." John's words were rapid, firing them out before Sherlock could even think about turning his heel and running from the situation. "Don't think I don't know that. It's unfamiliar, it's... it's
He figured that John did it because of adrenaline. He had been worried that Sherlock would die - Sherlock himself was worried that he would die - and it was a spur of the moment thing. Still, just in case it wasn’t an impulse, he thought he’d ask when they got home.
Sherlock mouthed back. But he winked, actually winked, and for a second forgot Mycroft had been saying something. However, Mycroft was still talking, and while Sherlock didn’t usually feel the need to listen to anything Mycroft said, this time he found himself actually wanting to.
He wished, not for the first time, that he had overdosed and saved everyone the pain of being near him.
John hastily climbed inside the cab. He tried to figure out exactly what he would say when he got to Sherlock. He had never been good with words, and now would be a good time to get better with them. If only his mind would cooperate. An image, unbidden, rose to the front of his mind. Sherlock, hugging him so tightly when he saw him. Tilting his face up until he was staring into his eyes and then-and then-John shook his head.
“Where’s John?” She peered out into the night before firmly shutting the door. “I would’ve thought he would be with you.” Sherlock pressed his eyes shut, turning his face towards the stairs so it wouldn’t show anything he was currently feeling. Her words cut him to the bone, made him feel as though he was seeping raw emotion straight from inside him.
Sherlock opened his mouth. “John, I-” he swallowed, suddenly a bit nervous himself. “I can’t promise that there won’t be another attempted murder. I will solve it though, if there is. I promise that.”
“I deserved that,” Sherlock said, remembering. He made a joke, not thinking about how John would react. He didn’t think, he just did what he wanted. That night was the night he decided to think about what John wanted. That night was the night he nearly lost John forever.
John nodded and pressed his lips together. When he spoke, it was grim. “Dad, he, he said terrible things. He hated it. Said that he didn’t raise any gay children.” John closed his eyes. “He said that he didn’t accept her. Not in that many words, of course. He mostly said it with his fists.” John laughed hollowly. Sherlock wanted to hold him tightly in his arms. “Harry handled it really well, looking back on it. She started ignoring him. And she started ignoring me. I didn’t stand up to him. I was too terrified of him. I couldn’t help her, and I think it was easier for her to ignore both of us. She started staying out later, not coming home until well past midnight.
“It’s quite all right,” Sherlock said coolly, even though it hurt that John didn’t want to bring Rosie.
Perhaps the nightmare had just shaken him. Perhaps he was scared of telling John that he loved him - he did close up after that - but they had said that before, at John’s wedding. He didn’t see why this time would be different.
Sherlock triple-checked the flat on the morning of the twenty-third. John’s chair was back in place. Mrs. Hudson had helped him prepare a fresh pot of coffee for John and biscuits for both John and Rosie. He was sitting across the table from Mrs. Hudson, waiting. The flat was as prepared as it could be. He had even gotten rid of any body parts from the refrigerator.
He closed his eyes for as long as he dared, trying to compose his expression. His phone buzzed then, and he reached for it, fingers stiff from cold.
All too soon, the time came. John packed up the rest of his and Rosie’s stuff and brought everything down to the stoop. Sherlock followed them out, wrapping himself up in his coat. His plan was to go walk around London for the rest of the day, lack of sleep be damned, until he stopped thinking about John. He didn’t know where exactly he’d go, but anywhere was better than being with his thoughts.
John clapped a hand over his mouth at his exclamation. They both glanced towards Rosie, relieved to see that she was still asleep. Good. “She shot you, and I went back to her. I fucking went back to her.”
The song they dance to is Always by Isak Danielson (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZdyIgst-S4). As Sherlock says, it is not a song to slow dance to, but the lyrics were so fitting that I couldn't resist. :)
Ella’s mouth opened, the first emotion she’d shown since he sat down. “I’m afraid I’m going to have to call the police-”
“I’m surprised you didn’t deduce this,” John said. “What with your ‘science of deduction’ or whatever.”
Basically, Sherlock told John that he loved him, and then panicked and left. This is not good, because literally all they needed to do was to talk. John is fairly confused, and the reason why will become clear next chapter.
Once he was on the plane, he pressed his fist to his mouth. The same one John had just been holding. He allowed himself to cry then, finally, silently. The rumble of the plane grew louder as it began to taxi down the runway. Sherlock watched as the three of them, John, Mycroft, Mary, grew smaller, wishing he could go back in time. He hoped the drugs would start to work more soon, to relieve him of this pain. He wasn’t sure he could do this sober. He wasn’t sure he could do this at all. Not without John.
John nodded. And then reached up a hand to run it through Sherlock’s hair, brushing the curls off his forehead. Sherlock blinked at him, his brain slowing considerably. It felt nice.
“Yeah, actually, can we talk about that?” The emotion in John’s voice surprised Sherlock. He thought they had, well, maybe not moved past, but at least discussed all there was to discuss about them.
Mycroft took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and held them up. “I’d offer you some, but it would be best not to tempt you.” Sherlock scowled. Mycroft flicked open a lighter and lit a cigarette. Sherlock’s fingers twitched and he wanted to take it, but his head still spun and ached. Mycroft inhaled deeply and then sent smoke billowing into the room. Sherlock imagined he could smell it. “Now. How can I get you to stop?”
“I’m surprised,” John said after a while. “I thought you would’ve picked a restaurant or something.”
Sherlock nodded and knotted his scarf around his neck, pulling on his coat. John flexed his hand, once, and followed him out into the chilly London night. A light mist was falling. Sherlock rubbed his hands together and tucked them into his pockets. He stopped on the stoop, tilting his head back and breathing in the air. It was nice to be out of his flat. He hadn’t realised how bored he had been in there until that moment. Until he was standing outside, John next to him, out in the city. A small smile crossed his face.
“Sherlock,” she said, and he could tell she wanted him to say more, do something, anything, to help her know he was okay. But he wasn’t okay, he would never be okay again. He couldn’t bring himself to care what she thought.
Ignoring the stiffness in his body, he walked slowly into the living room, leaning on the wall for support. His mind grew foggy. Right. He forgot how much he hated the fogginess of opioids. He ground the heel of his hand into his forehead, trying to clear it. It didn’t work. John’s face swam in front of his eyes, and he blinked to clear them. He somehow stumbled until he was out of his flat, facing the stairs to John’s old bedroom. He had only been up there once recently, to put John’s chair up. Sure enough, it was on the landing near his door. He took the stairs one at a time, still seeing John’s face. He pushed open the door and dragged the chair in, ignoring the fact that heavy lifting would be detrimental to his broken ribs.
“You’re far too clever for your own good, Mr. Holmes. You’ve made a lot of enemies. And being gay is so
“I’m also too tired to talk about Mary, so the conversations we need to have about her are going to have to wait until tomorrow.” Sherlock nodded. Mary. That was probably the big one. “Good, yeah. Sherlock, you have to understand something. I don’t like talking about these things. It’s why I-it’s why I pushed you away for awhile. It’s why we’ve never talked about your death, and why I didn’t have the courage to face you after Mary without copious prompting from Mycroft.”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, trying to regain his composure. Why did he wait so long? Why? They could’ve been happy, they could’ve been together, they could’ve been married. He let out a shaky breath. “Why didn’t we talk about this...earlier?”
“I’m burning up.” He kept his eyes fixed steadily on John. He imagined he could feel the marks in his arm, feel them taunting him. “I’m at the bottom of a pit, and I’m still falling. And I’m never climbing out.” John looked pensive.
“You didn’t fail him,” Mrs. Hudson said gently. “He’s grieving, you’re grieving. He’s blaming you because he can. Because otherwise he’d be angry with no one to tell it to. Because you were there, because Mary sacrificed herself for you. But it’s not your fault.” He let her words sink it, imprinting them into his mind palace.
“Oh,” Sherlock said. John crumpled and started to cry again. He stood up, walking past Sherlock to stare out the window.
John handed Rosie to Sherlock. His skin sparked and heated up where Sherlock had touched him, like there were live wires under Sherlock’s skin. He avoided Sherlock’s eyes.
January passed by quickly. Sherlock wasn’t quite allowed to be alone, but sometimes Mrs. Hudson would go down to 221A while Sherlock sat upstairs.
The movie finished without a change in their positions. Sherlock was too tired to move, suddenly, so he stretched out and laid his head in John’s lap. “Is this okay?” He couldn’t help the small bubble of anxiousness in his stomach.
He rang the doorbell of Olivia’s. She came to the door moments later, eyes red with tears. From the inside came the faint barking of a dog. Sherlock pulled off a glove to shake her hand. It was trembling slightly. He attempted to smile reassuringly but thought it was probably unnerving.
John stood above him, looking concerned. Sherlock tried to control his breath. “Hello, John,” he managed to say. “You’re late.”
Muttering, Sherlock took a seat at the table. He looked at the map on the wall. “No, no, no,” he said.
“Whatever you’re trying to say, please just get to the point,” Sherlock said, more than mildly exasperated with him.
“I didn’t say no.” He swallowed. “I did, however, immediately push him away, run into the bathroom and throw up.”
“Oh, shut up,” John said. “It didn’t, and that’s what matters. You look very handsome, by the way. In case I didn’t say that earlier.”
“Yeah, of course.” John swallowed. “I wish you had more time with her.” He stuttered a little, the words foreign in his mouth. Never would he have expected to wish for Sherlock to spend more time with Irene. But he supposed stranger things had happened. After all, he wouldn’t have expected to be sharing a bed with Sherlock either.
Sherlock made his way back down the stairs, holding the gift. John’s eyes were red when he came down, but Sherlock didn’t mention it. John smiled gratefully at him. Sherlock got his present from under the tree and then handed both to John. Just as he was settling in and John was giving Rosie her gifts, his phone buzzed from its spot on the table.
They made their way towards the Thai restaurant. As predicted, John loved it. He loved the idea of takeaway even more. Whilst waiting for their food, John suggested that they make up stories for each of the people around them.
“That was fairly ridiculous,” Sherlock agreed. “But I didn’t want you to feel uncomfortable. I didn’t know if you felt that way.”
“You did allow that,” Sherlock muttered, hating himself. He should just shut up now. He should accept John’s apology. It should make him feel better instead of making it feel like he’s splintering apart. He focused on the word
“Nothing,” Sherlock said, because that was the truth. “You can’t do anything. It will just take time.”
daughter. Sherlock gave no indication that he had heard John’s possessive pronoun, but he was Sherlock bloody Holmes, for gods’ sake. Of course he had heard it.
“Detective Inspector Lestrade-the officer called him-and Mycroft. Oh, and Molly and John. They might get Mrs. Hudson, I don’t know.”
“Rosie will have to come, so possibly not...but maybe one night soon we can go out, just the two of us?” Sherlock swallowed nervously. “I’m asking you out now.”
“It was a mistake. Christ, Sherlock. I’ve made so many mistakes lately. I don’t know how to fix this, but I’m trying.”
“How much do you know?” Mycroft studied Sherlock for a few moments. Sherlock looked down at his hands, at his coat all rumpled from sleeping in it.
“Smith, he, he…” Sherlock swallowed. He gestured to his face. “He did this. Well. Part of it.” He touched his stitches and realised that Smith had reopened the injury.
He was a bloody idiot. John was there, he was actually with Sherlock. They were hugging, and Sherlock relished every second of it. Then he had to go and mess it up, like usual. He said the wrong thing, which prompted John to say that Sherlock was his best friend. As if Sherlock didn’t know this already. John had told him time and time again that he wasn’t gay. Sherlock knew this. And he had had John right there, right in his arms. Of course he had to mess it up. Now that the secret was out, Sherlock was worried that they would never talk again. Which was a likely outcome. Why would he want to talk to him after he knew Sherlock’s feelings?
Sherlock resumed his examination of angles. He closed his eyes and saw the man standing up, back to the position he had been in before he was shot. He walked to the edge of the rooftop and glanced over the edge. The rooftop of the building adjacent had a better hiding place. A door stood upright on it, cracked open. Perfect.
John stayed at the flat for the next week. He had left some of his old clothes in his room upstairs, so he didn’t have to worry about that. Sherlock kept finding reasons for him to stay. He didn’t seem particularly inclined to leave, either. The week went by normally. Sherlock took a case or two, John had some locum work at a clinic somewhere. Mrs. Hudson watched Rosie when they were both out. The nights were Sherlock’s favourite part. It was the time when he felt the safest. After that first night in bed, they slept in Sherlock’s room. Rosie was left in her cot, but a baby monitor was placed on Sherlock’s nightstand so John would hear if anything happened. They held each other close and fell asleep that way. John only had one nightmare and Sherlock was able to immediately comfort him.
“I don’t know.” He licked his lips nervously. It was Sherlock, after all. The most brilliant, amazing man he had ever met. If he was a woman, he definitely would be in love. But he wasn’t a woman, he was a man, and that’s where the issue started.
“Fine.” His body twitched violently again, and he wondered if he’d be able to survive the withdrawals. Maybe Wiggins could bring him something, just to take the edge off.
“I could kiss you all day,” John said, “but I think there are other things we need to do. Like eat, for one.”
The sigh that fell from John's throat was one of frustrated acceptance. "Then that's that. You get it. I don't have
"Fine." John stood up, slamming his own laptop closed. "If we're not going to be on an even keel there's no point carrying on with this conversation."
Sherlock sighed. "If you must. James?" He turned, seemingly looking towards John. "Would you mind stepping to join us? Lewis here needs to make sure you're not carrying anything that could do him any damage."
As much damage as Neil's alcoholism had caused, as much outward and obvious damage which had been clearly been thrown upon Harry, John was finally starting to see that he had not escaped unscathed.
John finally looked up, his face flushed pink from the heat rising from the simmering meat. "No, it's all right. It's a small kitchen. I know what I'm doing."
John stared down at the dull blue carpet of his bedroom without seeing, forcing himself to take a step back from both his father and the anger he could feel welling up after years of suppression; he had to get control of this, of himself, it wasn't worth making the visit even more uncomfortable than it already promised to be. Taking a few moments to compose himself, inhaling a deep breath and folding his arms over his chest to lock it back up tight, he nodded briskly and licked his suddenly dry lips. "And that's it. That's done. I don't want to have this conversation whilst I'm here."
Without further question, Sherlock had simply let his body fall to the side, eyes closing instantly; it didn’t look particularly comfortable but John wasn’t going to attempt to make him move now, not after so quickly winning a battle. As John stood to quietly cross the room to get a blanket from his wardrobe, Sherlock’s sleep-heavy voice floated across the space between them. “I warn you, I’m horrible when I first wake up.”
"Ooooh." Harry sounded impressed. "Maybe Mum and Dad will forgive you, then. They still haven't forgiven me, I'm obviously picking the wrong people."
He could not. "I can't even say it aloud to myself. I'm not sure I've even thought it. Not what you're asking. Not those words."
John allowed himself a few minutes to think it over; he felt a little groggy, a little grubby and more than a little self-conscious when in the presence of an extremely clean-looking Sherlock – it probably wouldn't have bothered him if the man looked anything like he had ten hours ago, but now he felt extremely out of place and didn't relish the idea of having to sit and concentrate on whatever delights Sherlock had planned whilst in the same clothes as the day before. He rubbed his hands on his thighs and pushed himself into a standing position – his muscles groaned. As comfortable as the sofa had been, it wasn't quite a substitute for a real mattress.
Slowly, Sherlock allows the hand holding the bow to fall to his side; he leaves the violin, though. It’s oddly comforting, settled against his shoulder, the weight of an old friend.
"No," John said, shaking his head forcefully, "no, it's not embarrassing. Do you remember how I reacted when I first saw you? Do you remember how long it took me just to turn around after hearing your voice for the first time in person? Bloody hell, do you remember," he was murmuring now, low and intent, "how I reacted to the first time I heard your voice coming from my laptop? It was like being punched in the stomach."
The tiniest of smiles flickered momentarily on Sherlock's face before he effortlessly shrugged, throwing a slice of bread onto John's empty buttering plate. "That depends. Second thoughts?"
John glared half-jokingly at Sherlock as the taller boy passed to follow Mycroft. "We're not done here, Holmes."
"So give yourself a little time. Maybe you just need a kick up the bum, something to happen to spur you into figuring your shit out. True, for most people this would've been enough, heroin and all, but some people need a bit more of a push and you're obviously one of those people." A smile slipped into her tone like butter. "Just be sure to keep me updated."
There was a moment of silence before a sigh, a groan and, finally, the words that John had known would be coming. "Well, he wouldn't be messing around on rocks, I can tell you that much, but I suppose if I'm to make sure you don't break something..."
How often had he spent nights avoiding phone calls, texts, emails? There were the earlier days of depression where he'd spend time with Mike and Molly and Greg, perfectly fine, but once the sun had risen once more and he was forced awake by biology and sunshine he would find himself utterly unable to reach out to a single one of them and would hide himself away in the darkness of his room to recover from the mere effort of being with the people who genuinely liked him. There were, of course, the weeks where he would completely go without seeing anyone at all, curled up in a ball on his bed with only the empty space above his head to talk to – when he spoke at all. That in itself, during a day of nothing, was a miracle.
“You think I’m going to judge them?” Sherlock’s tone was steady, asking a question he already knew the answer to. “Judge your home, perhaps, the place you grew up in?”
"I'm not going to fall in love with him, Harry – and you too, Katie, I can practically hear you shaking your head from here. I don't think I'm...
John stared unabashedly at him, mouth still hanging open. “Of course it was. Extraordinary. It was... quite extraordinary.”
John found himself turning away from the Observatory, looking instead towards the city. "I don't have the patience for this. Just tell me what you're not saying."
Sherlock threw his hands up into the air. “Fine, fine, yes, it is personal! It’s personal in that I don’t want you to have to go through any more discomfort than you already will! It has absolutely nothing to do with your ridiculous notion that I don’t want to go with you out of desire to avoid meeting your parents and everything to do with attempting to consider your feelings in all of this.” The fervour in his voice, his changeable gaze was mesmerising; John rarely saw him so passionate, so determined, so equally confused in his own want to accommodate John. It was endearing and captivating all at once. “If you really think that I want to let you go miles away and spend days,
talk to your mother that way. With the crap I've put her through, the terrible husband and dad you all know I've been -”
Sighing, Sherlock rolled his eyes up to the sky. "Yes, all right, I'm a pot and I'm calling the kettle black. I assume that means that you think I'm stubborn too."
. I'd never insinuate that it gives her the slightest advantage, but Mummy is rather more emotionally intelligent than either one of us.”
The awkward silence that met his words was broken by Wanda, seemingly determined to smooth things over. "Well. We all have our trials, don't we? No one's exempt, there's always something going on close to home -"
"Great, thanks Sherlock. Oh, right -" John could feel Greg's eyes move to his back, knew exactly what was now coming, " - Sherlock, this is my mate John from uni, one of Mike's friends -"
John offered him a smile, nudging him again with his shoulder but lingering there for just a few moments before leaning away again. "Yeah. Lots of that."
His body collapsed into itself, falling back onto the soft leather cushion behind him as he brought the blankets up to his chin. John was in a state of shock, for the most ridiculous of reasons. “You’re a
Mycroft smirked. “And, so, you're now altruistically – never did I think I'd use that word to describe you, dear brother – staying put at home whilst your paramour -”
“Talk to Clara,” he called after her. Then, turning back to Rosie, he asked, “What exactly am I going to do now?”
“She’s asleep, so she either hated it or loved it. Come on, come help me with food.” Hopefully it was love.
“Sorry,” Sherlock said, looking apologetic. “I didn’t mean for it to be. I could go out and get you a heated blanket, or something, or we can order one, that is if you want to have more nights like this-”
John didn’t. “I get it. You need space.” He paused briefly before continuing. “Is it because of me?” The hesitant, pensive expression on John’s face almost made Sherlock reconsider the whole idea. Almost.
“In 1990, Michael Boothe was jumped in Elthorne Park and killed. Also for being gay. In 1999 the Admiral Duncan bar, a popular gay nightclub, was bombed. In 2000, ten year old Damilola Taylor was murdered in North Peckham Estate after being bullied and called gay. And in 2005, Jody Dobrowski was murdered at Clapham Common. Why? Because he was gay. So forgive me if I don’t want you to blog about this one, John. It hits a bit too close to home.” His voice was hollow and he barely recognized it. This was the first time he’d actually acknowledged his sexuality to John.
“That would be lovely.” He flashed her another smile and then turned to the fireplace. She didn’t say anything else as she went back downstairs, but later came up with a cup of tea, setting it beside him without a word.
He shut off the water and managed to wrap a towel around his waist. He shivered suddenly, in the cool air. He rubbed at his eyes and, oh-those were tears. He let out a despairing sob and leaned the side of his head against the wall. He didn’t care what Mycroft said. He couldn’t live without John. He needed to not be sober or he would quite literally fall apart and crumble to pieces.
“Handsome,” Sherlock mused. “No, I don’t believe you did. You said I looked fantastic. But not handsome.”
“Careful,” Wiggins warned. Sherlock scowled again and righted the flask. Wiggins exited the flat. Sherlock didn’t know what he did most of the time, or if he was even in the flat. It made no difference to him whether he was in the flat or not.
A heavy silence fell upon them. The room seemed frozen in time as John tried to keep himself together but couldn’t, clutching Mary’s lifeless body.
“Shut up,” Sherlock said halfheartedly. The documentary was talking about black holes, a subject Sherlock found mildly interesting.
“Me? I’m the one being difficult?” He raised his eyebrows incredulously and hissed out the next sentence. “This is your fault.”
When John didn’t say anything, Mrs. Hudson said, “I’ll be back later, Sherlock. Maybe with some tea?”
First up. They watched Skyfall which is a James Bond movie (Daniel Craig). At the end of the movie, Bond's family home where he grew up burns down. It reminded me of Musgrave which is why I chose that specific Bond movie.
“Good.” Sherlock slipped out through the front door and breathed in the air. His veins tingled at the thought of shooting up again. It had been so long, too long. He hailed the nearest cab he could, and made his way back to Baker Street.
That’s why he left. He couldn’t bear to see everyone else. So happy, and together. He didn’t need people. He told himself that he didn’t need people. He just needed one. Just that one person. With John around, he didn’t want anyone else. But then John ran off and got married-he supposed he was partially to blame for that, what with the dying and all-but John didn’t need him anymore.
Sherlock was lying, seemingly asleep, on the couch when John walked in with Rosie. The windows were closed, the curtains drawn, so it was quite dim. The flat smelled of cigarette smoke. John considered getting angry, but when he thought about it he really couldn’t blame Sherlock. He set Rosie in his chair and went to the kitchen to make tea. Yes, he had just had some, but it would give him a semblance of normalcy before the storm that was sure to begin.
“You can’t possibly know what I’m going to say,” John said. “I barely even know what I’m going to say.”
Night had fallen hours ago. Sherlock hadn’t moved from his chair. He and John got home, John put Rosie to bed, and then by mutual agreement John went upstairs with her and Sherlock stayed in the sitting room. Part of him wished that John was with him, but the other part of him was glad that John was upstairs. It provided an opportunity for him to sort out more of his feelings. Ever since his outburst, his anger at John slowly receded. There were only flickers of it left, and none of the flickers were very intense. He just needed time to process everything before he was able to fully forgive him. So he sat in his chair and thought and sorted everything into his mind palace.
Sherlock was suddenly crossing the last few metres and freezing inches from John, his hands stopping short from grabbing him as he finally found the opportunity to speak just a few, short, simple words:
Sherlock held himself completely unaccountable for his actions; just as John proclaiming him not to have a romantic bone in his body was like a challenge laid out on a plate, this reference to the fear/enjoyment argument was simply too tempting, impossible to ignore. He had stepped lithely from his chair within two seconds, found himself standing in front of John within four and, within six, had his hands placed firmly upon John's legs and was leaning down with his nose brushing like a whisper against John's as he watched, up close, John's eyes snap open and focus like a shot upon his own.
John's heart was almost uncontrollable in his chest. This was it, then. This was going to be the moment. It was too far gone to just walk away now.
If John had been under the misapprehension that Sherlock would be happy about his catching a ride home with him, he soon discovered that he was sorely mistaken.
"Because that's how you work, isn't it? When you don't want to say something, admit something. If people keep asking you push yourself further and further away, rooting yourself deeper and deeper into the sand until there's nothing of you left. But
Sherlock's deep voice broke through his reverie like hot water; almost as if his vocal chords had unlocked, John's voice burst out into the darkness with words he had actually not been thinking at all:
Unfortunately that left a myriad of options that Sherlock found difficult to sift through whilst John was being so ridiculously reticent; it was an odd change of pace to be on the other side of the fence. Usually John would be the one to (unsuccessfully) attempt to read Sherlock’s thoughts, eventually reaching a stage where he would ask – no attempt to mask his irritation – what the genius was thinking, feeling, inquire as to what was going on behind the fluttering of closed eyelids and steepled fingers; Sherlock wasn’t used to being the one wanting to ask the question. It tended to only take ten seconds of observation at the most to accurately surmise where John Watson’s thoughts lay and another five to make a snarky comment – all he had at this moment in time were snarky comments, snarky comments without route or foundation and there was no point whatsoever in being snarky if he couldn’t back it up. That in itself was frustrating, particularly as he rather enjoyed John’s usual reactions and threats in response.
Sherlock did not follow John's movements; instead he seemed to simply accept John's words, accept his final rejection. His shoulders dropped, his fist grasped tighter at the towel and he walked towards his own bedroom without a single glance back.
Slowly John lifted his hands to his face and dragged his palms across the warm skin, trying to ground himself enough that he wouldn't fly out of the door and go running off in any direction in order to bring his best friend safely home. "Are we over-reacting? It's not like he's completely unstable."
He started from the beginning of the evening. "We had kept up a pretence of a sexual relationship for the sake of irritating my brother, something to entertain me; he went along with it without question, he saw nothing in it. But yesterday, yesterday he asked for me to clear it up with Mycroft. He asked me to specify what we actually are rather than continue the charade. I agreed. I planned to tell him that we were merely friends."
"Chill out," Greg sighed, "both of you. Loz," he turned to her, apologetic to the last inch of him, "I'm sorry. I'll come along later if everything's cleared up."
Once more Sherlock looked away, the usual dance of gazes that John still wasn't used to making him feel as if he couldn't quite keep up. The man was impossible to read sometimes. "I'm not intense, just focused."
He recalled the rush of the week previous upon hearing Sherlock’s voice fill his empty bedroom from his laptop, deep and mocking; he remembered vividly the way his stomach had tightened and body frozen at the mere sound of the voice in person, tension exploding within himself as he’d turned around and met the intense gaze of the man who was supposed to have been nothing more than an academic tutor; the walk they’d taken around campus, talking of the party and medicine and nothing even remotely personal; dinner at the cosy Italian restaurant with wine and water and a clever, irritating, changeable childlike version of Sherlock; the heat of adrenaline pumping through John’s body as he climbed through a window; the feel of a rough coat against his cheek and surprisingly strong hands on his arms as Sherlock dragged him into hiding to avoid being caught by a security guard; the look of fierce jubilance on Sherlock’s face as he’d slipped out of a headlock and grabbed John’s wrist, yanking him towards the open window and throwing himself out of it and John practically falling through it; the mad dash across the park with laughter and swearing and stumbling until finally they’d stood gasping for breath whilst overlooking Canary Wharf… and the conversation that had followed, the foundations for their friendship hardening into stone and mortar.
Mycroft had not missed a single beat; he had heard every word said and heard every word that Sherlock had failed to utter. “Yes, well, you can thank John for me for his honesty.” He waited, eyes remaining completely fixed on Sherlock’s strained face. “And what about you?”
“I said to her, after she managed to make me angry - she was good at that, passive-aggressively antagonising a response out of me. I probably don’t pay her enough.” Sherlock can hear the slight smile in John’s voice, relishes in it, relishes in the odd twist of normalcy in such an abnormal conversation. John’s never really spoken about this before, this determinedly hidden point in his life, and Sherlock knows its basis lays within a point the doctor has yet to make. The thought makes him tense up all over again, almost missing John’s next jumble of words. “I said to her... I told her...”
Now, with the myth knocking at his door, John wondered if he would still feel the same as a young adult.
“Is this a therapy session?” His tone was curt, a cutting and sarcastic enquiry; instantly he regretted it, seeing her eyebrows raise high behind her fringe and the tightening of her jaw. He raised his hands out in surrender, or perhaps more likely in defence. “I'm sorry. For that. And for the bad marks. I know... I know it's not what you expect from me.”
“It is for me!” He scowled at her and stopped pacing for a moment. “Don’t you understand? It is what I need to do.”
Sherlock abruptly pulled John towards him. John let out a little noise of surprise. Tremors ran through his body, either adrenaline or crying, Sherlock couldn’t tell. Though he didn’t think it was adrenaline. He wrapped his arms around John, hands spanning his back. John tucked his head into Sherlock’s chest. “Stop talking,” Sherlock mumbled against the top of his head. “Good?”
“You would have died, John. You, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson. You all would have died. I couldn’t have that happen.” It was in no way an adequate thing to say. It was as far below adequate as one could get, actually. But it was the best he could do.
He didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know what John wanted him to say. He and John had reached an impasse, and Sherlock had no idea how to breach it.
Sherlock allowed himself exactly two minutes to compose himself before he got his clothes and slipped into the bathroom. He turned the shower on, undressing quickly before stepping in. The ghost of John clung to his skin. John’s fingers in his hair, John’s arms around him, John, John, John. He washed quickly, taking even more time to get his thoughts in order. This kind of reaction was abnormal for him. He never thought this much about physical contact. He also never craved this much physical contact. It had been unimaginably nice, better than he’d ever dreamed of-and he’d thought about this a lot-and he desperately wished that John would let him share his bed again.
“It’s fine. I’m sure that if I were normal I would have enjoyed it. I did enjoy the kissing, I just don’t want that right now.”
The smallest of grins flickered on John's face as he blew air out of his mouth up onto his forehead, trying to cool himself down. "As you can see, I took care of that for myself. Decided to only give myself ten minutes to get here."
"Never before has Sherlock so readily agreed to stop taking opiates." He half-turned, not quite looking at John but clearly directing his words towards him. "One mention. That was all it took."
"Well, would you like to come for a walk with Tim and I?" She seemed as if she genuinely meant it, her eyebrows raised as she pointed to the door leading out to the pathway. "I warn you, we do like a long one, but if you feel like a good old wander...?"
to understand." He breathed the words onto John's own lips, making them his. "You. Are. Enjoying. This."
"John," Sherlock groaned, flopping down onto his pillow and pulling the duvet with him, "that's hardly necessary…"
The hallway of the house was decorated with fairy lights – again John considered the idea of Greg's raging homosexuality – and was warm and welcoming, wooden floor instead of the carpet he was expecting and warm yellow walls offsetting the generally cosy feel. There were a few people sitting on the – carpeted – stairs, talking in hushed tones and grinning over more cups of the red stuff (presumably Greg's punch), all of whom looked up as he entered and nodded their welcome, two of them even raising a hand. He nodded back, not recognising any one of them but assuming (correctly) that they were already under the influential effects of the pick and mix punch so naturally were willing to be friendly to a complete stranger in their midst. He continued to walk slow steps, glancing to his right-hand side and jerking in surprise at the huge mirror hanging over a radiator, his reflection crisp in the lighting; he found himself looking over his clothes with a critical eye, the crinkles at the front of his dark blue plaid shirt, how the black t-shirt underneath it made him look pale, washed out. Thank god he couldn't see his lower half to judge that, because no doubt even his favourite jeans wouldn't be able to save his self-esteem now. Add to it the mess of his hair and the circles underneath his eyes and he looked like absolute shite.
Mycroft glared at him from across the table as he ladled two eggs onto his toast. "No need to be catty,
John finally pulled his eyes off of the table and looked his friend in the eye; it was difficult, though this was mostly down to how suddenly the alcohol seemed to be affecting his vision. "Mm? Yes, of course I'm all right. Of course."
He felt it as clearly as he had when he had first uttered John's name in Mycroft's study earlier on, that faint nudge in his chest that told him that something had changed, something was different; even though he was aware of its foundations now, it was still an odd sensation. He pushed it aside, determined that at least for now he should act as he had before this – then again he didn't really
John laughed and let go, allowing Sherlock to take it into his own hands. "I think I'll pass. But still, speaking of hidden talents..." His eyes found Sherlock's again, openly curious. "You never mentioned you played the violin."
A laugh slipped from John's throat. "It's not like she was my girlfriend, Sherlock, it was just one night."
John shook his head, looking down at the carpet; no, he’d keep that thought to himself. “It’s nothing.”
?” Harry whispered, an undertone quiet enough that only John would hear – he shoved an elbow into her arm, simultaneously gritting his teeth and fighting the urge to grin. He fucking hated his sister. Hated her, loved her, wanted her to shut the hell up and equally take over with her own special brand of chaos. He became oddly aware of the growing gratitude in his stomach, strange in the face of the situation, at her presence. The fact that she was here at all was a huge gesture, and he was fully aware that it was for his sake rather than her own.
John's eyes had not left Sherlock's face the entirety of the time he had been speaking. "Y'know, I think I know why you weren't talking to me now. I think I know why you wouldn't say a word to me."
And so that had been the moment. The moment that John had realised what Sherlock had done and the consequences he had been prepared to face in retaliation.
Sherlock sighed. "Let's not do this. Just say what's on your mind so that we can both attempt to get some sleep. I've heard that a hangover is rather debilitating and I would rather try and get some rest before it happens."
"Nonsense, you're a village celebrity!" Whatever they were talking about it was clear that Wanda Holmes was not going to let it go without a fight. "They were
"Quite," Wanda said with a firm nod, reaching over John to pat Mycroft on the hand, "you have enough to be getting on with without the added responsibility of a girlfriend. Or boyfriend."
The car journey, in the end, was actually somewhat enjoyable. Wanda had perhaps overestimated how far a game of 'I Spy' would go, Sherlock guessing everything within seconds and complaining two minutes later that he was bored – unsurprising, of course, considering the man seemed to have the attention-span of a five year old. Tim, realising far quicker than his wife that Sherlock wasn't going to be entertained by children's games, put on the radio and turned it up whilst rolling down the windows, welcoming in a wonderfully warm breeze alongside popular hits of years gone by; Wanda and Tim were soon harmonising to 'I Got You, Babe' by Sonny and Cher whilst Sherlock shot John a tortured rolling of his eyes and sent the smaller man into such a fit of giggles that he had to smother his mouth with the heel of his hand for at least five minutes.
Moments stretched where John thought that perhaps Sherlock wouldn't answer; he leaned back in his chair, watching, waiting for the little typing icon to flash.
As the dark-haired teenager wrapped his hand around the doorknob, slowly twisting it as he had twisted the one to John's room the night before, his voice came out as stiff and as deep as the first time John had ever heard it through the speakers of his laptop two months ago.
His face lowered slightly to the side, letting his eyes flicker down to meet Harry's, and found his own desperation to get the hell out of there mirrored in her own. “It was good to see you, y'know. You should come and visit me at uni sometime.”
“Fine.” Sherlock was planning on signing himself out in the morning, anyways, so it wasn’t really a big deal. The nurse left the room.
When John knocked on the door, Sherlock stiffened. Mrs. Hudson noticed his hesitation and opened the door for him. “Oh, John,” she said. “Rosie is beautiful.”
An odd pang shot through John's stomach, momentarily breaking through the cloying fog. His fingers began typing before he could even wrap his head around the idea that he should stop.
And now John's hands were letting go of his shirt and, instead, pressing their palms flat against his chest. Sherlock opened his eyes and found himself staring into heated pools of hazel-blue mist.
John was quiet for a few moments. "I'm not trying to be a dick about it, Mycroft, it's just still a bit of a mess in my head. I haven't had a defining moment either way and I just... yeah. I don't want to make a decision only to regret it later."
So you hacked into the system and found my marks, essays, whatever else you could get your hands on. Considering you so clearly have no desire to be even remotely appropriate that comes as no surprise, though you can be sure that I'll report you just as soon as I've said all I have to say to you.
John's eyes flitted to Sherlock, teeth gritting as he felt the urge to both laugh and swear; christ, he never knew whether to love or hate her. "I don't even need to correct you, you
The smallest of laughs from Sherlock and the twist of an unfamiliar smile; there was no warmth in it whatsoever as he turned his head and looked directly at John for the briefest of moments, eyes full of derision and disbelief. They stood that way for a while, John looking at Sherlock, Sherlock looking at John and Greg looking between them both as he lifted a hand to the back of his head and scratched the edge of his ear with all the awkwardness of a boy who had just walked in on their parents having sex.
day. Certainly you won't be lying down, and there may be no need at all to discuss your childhood. I won't push you for topics unless I think it's absolutely necessary – essentially the effort will be coming from you. You're here to talk to me, not be told what to say. You won't see any improvement if I'm feeding you lines to repeat back to me, after all."
"Ordinary." John's voice was undeniably bitter, the sound of it making even himself intensely uncomfortable; the acute, keen gaze he found himself locked in as Sherlock's eyes shifted to his only made it more so.
Sherlock had been unaware that it were possible to feel more alarmed in his life. His whole body was frozen. "I… that wasn't… I didn't…"
"My brother, you see, never does it just once. He's no better than the rest of them after the first prick of the needle, seeking it out constantly, forming a habit – he functions far better than most addicts, of course, but it has been known to crack before. He has been known to... break. I mean it, though: if it is in his possession, he will inject it."
Ahem. Seriously, though. You're all amazing. I dedicate this to all of you. And every other chapter. =3
"Oh," Sherlock said airily, his shadow moving against the wall outside in the dark hallway only slightly lit by the crack of light coming from the room which the genius currently occupied, "round and about. Had to have a word with Lucas about tempo. Had a very interesting conversation with a Baroness about joining some sort of orchestra."
The voice that came from Sherlock’s throat was so unfamiliar in its brokenness, its vulnerability, that Sherlock was unsure that it was even himself was speaking. “I’ve observed relationships for years. I’ve watched people from my pedestal, seeing them converse and interact, somehow gleaning joy and sadness and anger and… love, simply by allowing the constant presence of another person in their lives. I have seen friendships fall, marriages fail, families deteriorate and I have never understood the basis behind them, the foundations. Every connection seemed weak, damaged before it had even taken hold. I didn’t want to understand it. I didn’t want to know.”
we're going, Sherlock. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy being taken through backstreets and questionable alleyways any day of the week, but…"
Sherlock's responding glare was answer enough. "Do you really think I'd be foolish enough to take you with me? If I was picking up drugs, John, you'd be the last person I'd tell, let alone bring along for the hell of it."
Mycroft Holmes was tall, maybe even slightly taller than his younger brother. His misty-blue eyes and dark brown hair were oddly flat in John’s eyes, lacking most if not all of the sparkle and dynamical energy of Sherlock’s own features… in fact, they looked absolutely
"Yes. Soon. Okay, but, until then I'm going to just kiss you one more time, just once more, and then we can -"
John felt that odd warmth around him again as William's voice came through the speakers in such gentle tones he could barely recognise it was the same person. "I know, John. It's all right."
don't want to hear what you get up to with Katie. Ever. EVER. You're my sister, for crying out loud...”
John felt a fierce rush of relief run through him at Greg's words - thank god. Thank god. Greg didn't know. Greg was still blissfully unaware.
“I’m sure he’ll find some way of keeping me distracted,” Sherlock said lightly, curling a few strands of hair around his long index finger as he kept his intense gaze fixed uncomfortably on Mycroft’s own steady stare. Sometimes John could almost have sworn that his friend wasn’t joking about it at all, so believable were his tone and manner. “And it wasn’t an attempt, Mycroft. I distinctly recall that I
..." It was all coming together now. In a haze. In a flash. In a storm. "If people leave you alone, if they let you mull it over and stew in it until you're finally so full of words you can't possibly hold them back anymore -"
"Stop talking about his g-spot, fucking hell!" John's head swivelled to face Sherlock, eyes widening in horror as he saw a very bright red blush working its way up to the genius's curved cheeks. "Oh, hell… no, Sherlock, I'm not making plans, don't start freaking out -"
"I'm not a child," Sherlock grumbled, pushing the plate away and towards John. "If you want it eaten so much,
The dark-haired man hesitated, trying to piece the right words together. "Did Sherlock ever tell you about what I realised from what happened at the party?"
"All this nonsense about being dull and whatever you were planning on saying before I interrupted you earlier – about not even understanding why I even want to be your friend. I know you well enough to know you don't suffer from any particular brand of low self-esteem, you're relatively well balanced and consider yourself to be a good sort of person, so this drivel about not thinking you're
John folded his arms across his chest, the old familiar frustration threatening to make an appearance. "Would you really rather that I had told you? That I'd sat you down tonight and said, 'it's great that you play the violin, oh, and by the way, Greg told me that you're in love with me'? That's what you would have wanted?"
Sherlock had been gone only mere minutes, and in that space of time John had gulped down nearly an entire glass of wine.
He did not have words, for words were pointless; everything was a mess of colour and confusion and John was genuinely unsure as to whether he was coming or going – and what an odd sentence that was. He wasn't going. He couldn't possibly move. But going, going forward, where would they be going forward to? Surely at this point it would be to take a step back to accept Sherlock's proposition and carry on as if nothing had happened?
Greg was staring at him, agape. "Riiiight. And you're sticking with the whole 'we're just friends' thing?"
Sherlock's eyes narrowed slightly, almost as if he could hear John's thoughts; this did not stop the thoughts from continuing to shout, belligerent.
"You've read the form that I was forced to submit. It's really quite redundant to ask a question you already know the answer to."
," John stressed the word, reaching for a new bandage, "yes Greg, that's what I'm telling you. What, can you make more sense of it? You saw... what happened." The images shot through his mind, the darkness and the intensity and Sherlock's breath on his lips. His stomach jolted. "You aren't blind."
here for a reason," she said, suddenly sounding terribly fair, "but as you seem unwilling to discuss it at this point in time I would like to find something that you
Well. That was a good sign. Wasn't that a good sign? He was typing before he'd even thought about what to say:
He tried to match the offhand timbre, leaning against the counter and resting his weight onto his forearms and elbows. "I've been to Burgundy. I've tasted the real thing."
Wanda gave her the sweetest smile she could possibly muster. "Of course. I wouldn't dream of leaving without doing so."
"I want to learn," Sherlock insisted, suddenly sitting up straight – John found himself wondering at the strength of his stomach muscles – and moving his hands so that they were behind him, supporting himself on the bed; John was now pretty much kneeling up either side of one of Sherlock's long legs, arms at his sides. "I want to learn, John. So teach me."
Also, I write slow fics. I do. I update fast, sure, but I'm not the kind of person to write a fanfic JUST for slashy smut/fluff etc. The build up is the best bit in my opinion, and I know that a slow-moving fic can put people off but honestly, I do believe it's worth it. Don't give up. Keep reading. More importantly... enjoy. :)
“That.” Sherlock’s teeth moved on to the skin at the edge of his nail, biting unnecessarily hard. “That’s what I came to say.”
“It’s quite a space of time, I know, but... well, I’ve been thinking about it.” John is slipping the coat from his shoulders, not looking towards the man silhouetted against the window with a violin perched on his shoulder as he shakes the rain from the somewhat soaked material and throws it unceremoniously to the floor. Sherlock observes, but makes no deductions. Now isn’t the time. “Because it’s five years ago today - did you know that? I know it’s not exactly the sort of anniversary you celebrate, your first suicide, but...”
"Both of which being maladies he's never encountered before. You don't seem to see the importance of -"
Just about managing to control the coughing, John managed to croak out a series of words quietly to the man sitting beside him.
Hardly believing what he was reading, John could not stop the small noise of disbelief that escaped his throat. Was this guy even for real? He found himself not knowing which part of the message to respond to first but, after a quick inward battle, decided to focus on the task at hand rather than attack the man for his tone. That could wait.
She shrugged. "As long as both of my boys are healthy and happy it really doesn't make a difference to me."
"Hi," John greeted him with a grin, extending out a bottle of red wine and holding two plastic bags aloft as if they were sacred, his eyes meeting Sherlock's very briefly before glancing behind him and into the warmth of the house. "Greg left yet?"
wrong with it whatsoever; Sherlock's lips were as soft as any girl's, just as responsive, just as warm and dynamic and
"No!" John's quick response was too quick, too loud. He cleared his throat, feeling his hands start to shake at the effort of it all. "No, I... I'll meet you at the party, got things to do on Friday but yeah, sure, as soon as I'm done... I'll be there. For sure."
When he speaks it’s raw, hoarse from restraining himself from speech - he’s sickened with himself, utterly full of loathing. John, spilling his emotions, and Sherlock, unable to control his own in the wake of them: weakness, such weakness, and now John - John, who should be comforted, not Sherlock - is reaching out to soothe
Sherlock's arm rubbed against his again as he lifted his glass. "I'm not sure I should be listening to you. You're already drunk."
"Sorry about the dull conversation earlier," Tim apologised quite sincerely, glancing to his left as if he knew that the instigators of said conversation were nearby, "but we always seem to get into it no matter where we meet them. Very nice people but
John's voice was gentle when it slipped from his lips, surprising himself. "It doesn't mean that you don't care."
"Just pay your part," John insisted, pushing his £10 back into the middle of the table and standing up, heading towards the door of the restaurant without giving Sherlock a chance to argue. "And if you're implying what I think you're implying you can bloody well forget it."
, that you did it for my sake. And if the first time didn't kill me, Sherlock… it would have this time. For sure. There is not a doubt in my mind -" his own chin tilts up in an gesture so similar to Sherlock's familiar action, " – in the outcome for us both. I would not have even
"Yes," Sherlock said shortly, rounding the corner and entering what seemed to be a long, dark tunnel. "I am."
Mycroft’s lips tugged into a humourless smile. “Oh, let’s not go down this path, John. There’s no need for us to be unpleasant to one another.”
The first thing that John sees upon entering the flat is that Sherlock is leaning over his music stand, a pencil grasped between the fingers of his right hand and his violin in his left; he's composing, composing when most people are settling into their beds and of course Sherlock wouldn't be sleeping now, of course he would be awake precisely when John needs him to be and is now glancing across the room and straightening his spine with that wonderfully arrogant chin-tilt as if to say:
John watched as the tiniest of smiles flickered its way to life on Sherlock’s cupids-bow. “Mm. Perhaps.”
Mycroft shot John a quick look as he nodded in agreement. "Well then. We're agreed. This conversation is now entirely unnecessary."
Wanda gave her youngest son what John could only describe as the biggest shit-eating grin he had ever seen and laid her hands on the pile of food in front of her. "Well, John told me what a marvel you two are in the kitchen, so I thought you could both give us the pleasure of your expertise tonight and make us something!"
John's mutter was meant for her ears only, but it didn't particularly matter or make any sort of difference. The words had been spoken. Sharon was already staring, open-mouthed, at her daughter, offended to the very tips of her fingers if the trembling of her hands was anything to go by. Jesus, this wasn't good. “What do you mean,
A knot of tension wormed its way into the dark-haired genius's stomach; there was something to it… there was nothing to it. Just like that, the night before lingered between them like barrier. "I don't know. I wasn't implying anything, I…" He had to salvage this, he could hear the confusion in his own tone and it needed to be altered imminently. "So essentially you're cooking a glorified beef stew."
what would happen when you played tonight. You knew it was either going to go one way or another. You were just too scared to find out which."
"GOTTA TAKE A PISS!" Mike interrupted with a yell, perhaps over-exaggerating the need to do so when the music was only really deafening in the living room and only somewhat audible in the kitchen, but then he couldn't really judge his friend. He could tell exactly the effect his mere presence at the party was having on Mike and he would put up with all the yelling, touching and drinking as best as he could for as long as he could. The fact that Mike had welcomed him with open arms and not mentioned at all the fact that John was a total arsehole of late meant that he was owed John's presence and patience, for as long as the twenty-three year old could possibly manage.
Sherlock's face was pale, paler than usual. All of his own irritation seemed to have vanished into thin air. "I... I didn't intend..."
"So…" John thought about it for a moment. "You were actually trying to encourage me to make it for you again?"
"That's where we were when you started getting snarky. I'm a lesbian. What does that have to do with anything?"
Wordlessly Sherlock turned and followed his mother out into the dining room, not even giving John so much as a 'goodnight'; John didn't particularly blame him. He'd be distracted too – not to mention nervous – at her request. He had a horrible idea that he knew the exchange that was about to pass between them and he was well aware that if he stayed he would overhear a conversation that was by and large going to be awkward as all hell.
John tilted his chin up, his attitude the very reflection of the man currently dozing in his bedroom. “I’d say that’s none of your business, actually.”
Mycroft rotated slowly on the spot, pivoting in such an elegant way that John would have sworn against his mother's own life that he had taken at least one dancing lesson in his lifetime. When the man spoke, his voice was very soft, eyes betraying a flash of amusement. "You. Gregory mentioned your name once. He went to his bed and crawled underneath the covers without a further moment of fuss."
"Oh yeah," John enthused, purposefully not explaining that Sherlock was better at complaining that he was bored of waiting for it to be ready than actually being helpful, "pesto chicken, lasagne, shepherds pie, you name it. He's quite the chef, with a little help!"
"We'll probably take a picnic," Tim suggested, "as we tend to do a lot of walking. There's always Southsea Castle -"
"I'm not suggesting, John, I'm saying very clearly that it is what it is." Greg shrugged, looking up at the ceiling and then back to John. "Jesus, the whole room felt like a fucking furnace when I walked in."
Sherlock shut the book with a 'snap', throwing it down in front of him and placing both hands flat on top of it. "I don't know, isn't it the sort of thing friends know about each other? Favourite colours, siblings, childhood pets? I've known you for a significant amount of time now, John, and I don't know any of these things. So... I'm asking them. Colour? Sibling? Pet?"
John almost choked on his chicken. "Sorry, sorry -" Tim quickly handed him a napkin and a glass of water that seemed to have materialised from nowhere, " - thank you. Sorry. No, I'm fine, it's all right – what's the village ball?"
Sherlock can feel his own defenses rising, yet he doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want that at all. Not now. This is the wrong moment for defenses -
"They didn't have the store-brand cherry vodka, Greg, so I got the name-brand bottle instead. It was eight pounds dearer but I assume that won't bother you in your current state of inebriation -"
"Yes, all right," John interrupted, putting his hand out to quieten the man. "All right. Fine. So let's assume that he isn't planning on telling me anything. Where does that leave me?"
Sliding his coat from his arms and hanging it on the edge of the banister, he found himself nonplussed when a murmur came from the living room.
The taller man took a few moments, a comfortable silence settling around them; a clock ticked from the dining room, marking the seconds until Sherlock finally spoke again. "Do you have any siblings?"
had spoken openly, it had been his initial confession of his feelings for John. His face flitted between defensive and annoyed, rapidly changing between the two. “Precisely like last time. Except for the fact that, at this current moment, it seems to have worked in my favour. Not that it has anything to do with you.”
... it's new. It's terrifying. I know that, I can see that in every word you're saying to me but running is not the answer. Do you hear me? Can you hear the words that I'm saying?" Nothing was enough, these words were just not enough. "
John decided that it would be back-pedalling to bring up what he had been trying to explain before – that he hadn't been at all referring to her sexuality as something she should change and, rather, it was all of the
Slowly he sat on the edge of his bed, resting the laptop on his knees. His eyes travelled over the conversation screen, lingering momentarily on the name.
“Oh, I have no doubt,” his brother said lightly, fingers drumming against his upper leg, “I had already ascertained that John would be the inspiration behind such a drastic decision. He has been, after all, the reason behind most of your life choices in recent weeks.”
The taller man snorted, looking away. "In love with you. I should've realised he'd resort to such ridiculous terms."
"You -" John bit his tongue, willing himself to stay patient. "I'm sorry. It wasn't... it isn't an easy choice. Being here. I would rather try and deal with it on my own."
How you think you can know all of these things is beyond me. You may in fact be a tutor, in fact I accept that gladly. That doesn't stop you from being a troll, someone who would rather inflict pain and misery than actually be of any use or decency. How Joanne thought you could help me is completely and utterly beyond me, it truly is – do you really think that your clever little deductions are going to impress me?
John placed his hands on the coffee table, shaking his head and closing his eyes. "All right. I can see this is upsetting you."
want to communicate with you. I didn't know what you looked like, I didn't know what sort of person you were, I knew nothing about you other than the fact that Jo was concerned that you were in a bad place and that you needed academic assistance… and then you sent that e-mail. If I'm to be completely honest with you, John, I did rather a lot of digging in those minutes between your responses and what I found left me quite unable to stay away."
"All right, guys, all right! I'll make the bloody decision, shall I?" Greg stood in the doorway of the kitchen, staring at them both with exasperated eyes. "Christ, you're like an old married couple..."
"I'll try some when I get in there," he said pointedly, gesturing towards the house, "unless you want to spend the whole night out here catching pneumonia?"
to what he had expected – but the majority of students in the class seemed to be girls, only nine or ten men dotted around the room. He was tempted to crack open the door to find out what class it was that Sherlock was taking, pressing his face up against the glass to see if he could read the presentation currently projected onto a giant screen –
It took a few slow moments for John to catch up; his mind was so infinitely delayed that Sherlock found it amazing that he had somehow managed to get into university at all. "What? Greg? No, he came home alone. A few minutes after you left."
Sherlock's eyes flitted sharply to rest upon Greg's horrified face. "I think it would be better if he said nothing. Always nothing."
From then on it had been one battle after another. After ten minutes of trying to cajole the young man into eating his food (and finding himself faced with a 6ft child) he had instead tried encouraging him to drink his wine, hoping that in the very least a tipsy Sherlock would be an easier one to deal with – a terrible mistake. Not only did Sherlock become increasingly irritating, he also started to pick at John for different things that were absolutely none of his business. First it had been his hair: "You need to get it cut, you're starting to look like a street urchin from the seventies"; it had rapidly moved on to his intelligence: "I'm not saying you're an idiot, John, but one day I'm going to stop tutoring you and you'll have to actually do your work without my constant guidance"; now it had apparently shifted back to his appearance, padded cleverly by Sherlock's apparent concern at his lack of eating.
A small mutter of ‘christ’ came from Greg’s corner of the room; Mycroft sighed deeply and started to walk towards the doorway, swinging his umbrella from side-to-side gently. “Calm down, Sherlock. You’ll give poor Gregory a heart attack.”
John shifted his body so that he was properly facing his friend. "It's like when you're angry with someone, you want to hit them. And sometimes they
"As friends. To everyone. We continue our friendship without introducing the idea of anything more to anyone. We keep our friendship first and foremost for everyone to see."
Something rocked wildly within him, a cross-section of panic and the slower surge of guilt. “Why am I leaving? Why am I depressed? Why am I sorry?”
When he could stand the blind ignorance of his best friend no more he forced the words from his lips; he did not sound like himself, he was possessed, utterly transformed. He had not wanted something this much in his entire life.
"Yes," John said with a quick nod, turning back to the stove and poking at the beef which was surely ready to be put in the oven with the vegetables by now, "yeah, sure. I'll be here."
The familiar hesitation, the slow turning of a doorknob; John instantly felt more awake, knowing as he did who would be on the other side of the door.
As the evening drew to a close and all of the washing up had been completed, Mycroft heading up the stairs to bed and Tim and Sherlock still at the table discussing something to do with the pros and cons of leaving a glass of brandy to 'breathe' before drinking it, John found himself standing alone in the kitchen with Mrs. Holmes as she hummed along to the radio and scrubbed at the rather dirty stove; naturally she had refused any offer of help, instead asking questions about his family and his plans for after university, seemingly genuinely interested and enthusiastic.
"I hurt you. I hurt you knowingly and willingly, as you said, with every intention of making it so unbearable for you here that you would have to leave. It is unforgivable. I have done so many things that are entirely... unforgivable."
No. No, he would not say that damned word again. Sherlock took the remaining few strides to close the distance between them and reached out with an impatient hand, grasping the wrist of John's tightly clenched left hand and dragging it towards him, the bandage practically brushing against his cheek as he pulled it up beside his face. His entire body pulsed with unfamiliar heat as he came quite as close to John as he had ever been, so close that he could now accurately read the confusion and brief flash of panic on his friend's face, close enough that the scent of him which rose up and clouded around him was almost overwhelming. His mind quickly raced with errant and useless thoughts, his conversation with Mycroft earlier at the very forefront – he had told his brother that he had no sexual desire towards John yet there was something about the body-warmth emanating from the shorter man in front of him that made him wonder if he perhaps had spoken too soon, the effect on his inability to focus rendering him into a state of clarity and awareness that made him feel quite overpowered by his senses. He took a dragging breath inwards, cursing himself at doing so as it was almost as if he were
Greg shifted uncomfortably beside him; Mycroft simply gazed at John without a flicker of emotion as he replied, completely matter-of-fact: "Heroin."
John rolled his eyes – he'd done that a lot at the supermarket. "No, you just couldn't be bothered to listen. Now look -" he grabbed a knife and cut open the pack of chicken breasts, reaching in and grabbing one, " - you slit it along the side, okay? Then put the mix of pesto and mascarpone -"
The slightest tremor to Sherlock's taut facial expression, the flitting of an irritated eyeline. “I'm not obsessing. I'm thinking.”
Bringing it back up to his eyeline he forced aside the gradually developing loss of emotion and began to type.
"Fucking sickening," Harry mused, though her tone at least suggested that she agreed with Katie. John could feel his own cheeks burning quite as much as Sherlock's had earlier. "So I'm guessing you two are keeping this on the down low for now?"
The next hour and a half flew by in a mass of introductions, people gushing about Sherlock's raw talent and copious amounts of champagne. John had already had three glasses due to sheer need of replenishment (who ate
For the first time since John had met Sherlock Holmes, uncertainty crossed the taller man's face. "I was just rambling, John, I'm not in my right mind. I'm ill."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, picking a book up and letting his eyes fall to the open page. "I didn't realise it was that difficult a question."
"True," John mused, lifting his legs and slipping them underneath the covers, "but I have a very short attention-span. So if you wanted to entertain me a little more..."
