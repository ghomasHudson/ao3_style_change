"Neither do we," Samandriel said fervently.
"Why?" Jesse screwed up his face, like Dean had announced that he thought tuna jello was a good idea. "I'm fine. It's not like anything can hurt me."
Dean tipped his head in confirmation.
That night, he'd had nightmares about his dad coming home the way he used to, drunk and miserable, snapping at Dean while Sam hid away, pretending to be alseep. John's voice had gotten louder and louder, his taunts crueler and crueler, until his face turned into adult Sam, furious and betrayed, and Dean had  jerked awake, gasping. That had been almost a week ago, now.
“Jess,” he said helplessly.
“Turning a blind eye due to prior arrangement, and then shackled to Lucifer,” Cas replied dryly. The dream was reforming around them, colour and shape returning. He reached out and caught Dean’s arm, halting him. “I am sorry that I cannot reunite Sam with you. But I am glad that he is safe, and among friends.”
The clock on the bedside table flicked
Lisa sighed.
"Nah, kid," Dean had said quietly, glancing over his shoulder at where Jesse was doing a good job of pretending not to eavesdrop. "She'll be home soon enough, I'll tell her then, okay?" Thankfully, Ben had accepted this with a small shrug, and vanished up to his room.
Dean clenched his jaw, the muscles in his cheek jumping. He didn’t say anything. Cas released his hold on Dean’s arm, but he didn’t move away either.
“They seemed to be getting along,” Cas agreed tentatively, sparking another wet laugh from Dean.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yeah, maybe." He ran a hand through his hair. "I have been told that I have a saviour complex." Time to change the subject. "What brings you here, anyway?"
"He informed me that Lisa Breaden had been encouraging to reach out to people he... cared for. Bobby and myself were the only ones he mentioned, but I expect there will be others. She also has given him some literature designed to aid humans coping with grief."
kid, definitely, but still just a kid." Jesse settled back down, slightly less mutinous. "There's also the fact that I promised to help you. To try, at least. And even though leaving was your choice, I guess I still felt like I'd failed you."
If he could have, Dean would have jumped. As it was, the shock of it freed him enough to slowly turn his head and meet Cas’ eyes. When he’d first woken up as himself, the first thing that he’d noticed about his best friend was how goddamn tired he had looked. Not physically, no, angelic boosts from both Jack and Gabriel had had Cas stronger than he'd been in years; even his wings had been restored. But the lines of his face and the set of his shoulders had told Dean everything he needed to know about the emotional toll his disappearance had taken.
“Shit,” he said at last. “I bet she kicked Dad’s ass.” His mouth pulled up at the corners in an uncertain smile, his eyes shining with tears. “You know, Sam never really got to meet her? Not as our mom. I bet they’re catching up.”
"Samandriel is one of my most trusted lietenants. He watches over this heaven when I am unable to." Cas informed them dismally, watching Samandriel fawn over an amused looking Sam, who seemed flattered by the attention.
"Sure," he said, shrugging helplessly.
"He prayed to you?"
“He’s still dead.” It sounded like a challenge, the way he said it, like a dare. He stared fiercely at Cas, eyes wild, like he was waiting for something. Under their feet, the dock creaked and groaned.
Jody and Donna were there too of course, although the rest of the Sioux Falls gang had stayed behind at the bunker with Bobby and the newly resurrected angels who had not decided to return to heaven. They were intended as the backup for when the mission almost inevitably went to hell in a Winchester patented hand basket.
“No ‘kind of’ about it kid, you’re a full on powerhouse.”
———————————————————————-
All of it was familiar, and all of it had been missed. But none of it more so than the two women puttering around the room, bickering good-naturedly with each other as they served drinks and fond insults to the crowd of patrons that had found their way here. Working alongside them was a broad-shouldered man with warm eyes and Jo's smile, who'd shaken Sam's hand firmly and introdced himself as Bill Harvelle.
“Dean?” Lisa interjected gently.
Lisa had announced that she and some of her friends from yoga had planned a girls night out at around lunchtime, and had let Dean know that he'd agreed to babysit.
He looked - heavy was the only way Cas could think to describe it – like the weight of all his pain had seeped into his bones and become tangible, bearing him down towards the earth.
"I just went to visit the Roadhouse heaven, on your orders, Sir, and I noticed that everyone there seemed very excited, so I went in for a closer look, and Sam Winchester is there!"
He nodded solemnly.
"Why, because you're a kid." He held up a hand against the stubborn set to Jesse's jaw that definitely preceeded some sort of offended outbust. "A very mature, powerful,
Dean’s subconscious was no different, though Cas knew it far more intimately than he did most humans. It was darker than he remembered though, more tumultuous, full of things with sharp teeth and sharp words, strengthened by Dean’s memories and fed by his emotions.
Jesse had eyed him skeptically at that, which Dean found mildly offensive since for once he'd been telling the truth.
"I recovered," Cas said absently as he looked over the Roadhouse. The exterior glowed with the warding sigils he'd given to Ellen Harvelle. He was glad to see them in use. "Would you mind letting them know we're here? We can't enter the premises without permission."
Jesse shifted awkwardly.
“Well, what is on the table, then?” Dean shook his head. Nothing, was what. At the moment? With a gaping hole in his chest were his brother used to be, with a brain full of shit that would send most people howling to the nuthouse, with a soul so battered that it was a miracle there was anything left to it? There was jack squat on the table, and Sam had just been too stubborn to see it.
Cas nodded, surprised that Sam seemed so skeptical.
"Oh, he's here. Don't ask me where specifically, because I don't know. Wherever he is, it's gonna be far away from me."
“I’d rather have him alive.”
“I thought,” Cas said quietly, “that you would want to know.” He met Dean’s infuriated gaze, carefully keeping his own face blank, until Dean scoffed at him and stepped back, the strength of his rage fading.
“Dean,” she started, and oh, God, that was a serious face if he’d ever seen one. “You show up at my door, traumatized to Hell and back – literally – after losing the last bit of family that you had, telling me that you have been fighting a war for the last two years – which isn’t even counting the rest of your life – asking me for help. Well, guess what, bucko, this is me. Helping.” Her dark eyes bored into Deans, and he looked away. Her voice softened. “You can’t stay in my guest room forever. You’re thirty, Dean. You have a lot of life left to live, and your brother wanted you to live it.”
"It's an honor," Samandriel said breathlessly, seizing Sam's hand and pumping it up and down. "The entire force of heaven heard what you did to protect the Earth."
Cas stretched out his grace, grasping at the monsters that lurked in the shadowed corners of Dean’s mind and banishing them, recalling instead a peaceful lake, a narrow wooden dock and a sky lit up in a spectacular sunset of pink and orange and gold. It was peaceful and lovely, and Cas was glad that he could provide it for Dean, even if it was just for a little while.
“Okay!”
"Well, that would be Cas," Ellen leaned her elbows on the bar,  proud smile pulling at her mouth. "Came right in the other mornin' like a man on a mission, handing out warding sigils, telling us that he'd try and keep the others of our backs."
Morning came slowly, the way it always did for Dean these days. He jerked awake from familiar nightmares at four o’clock, and stared up at the ceiling until the sun rose before rising to prepare the promised breakfast.
"You need somewhere to crash for a few days?" Dean asked, before he could stop himself.
Dean’s eyes roved over his face, as though searching for something. Whatever is was, it seemed that he found it, and his shoulders dropped from their defensive tension into something more neutral.
Preteen antichrists appearently had pretty similar appetites to preteen humans, Dean learned, watching as Jesse demolished the leftover pizza. It almost felt like deja vu, sitting back at the kitchen table with a hungry kid - or, it would have, if Jesse hadn't been so obviously different from Ben.
"Oh, Sam," she whispered, face pained. "I'm your mother. I was meant to protect you. There shouldn't have been anything in the world that could get through me to you. Nothing."
“Yeah, me, and Sammy, a little bit.”
Cas tilted his head at the idiom, still unconvinced that it made any logical sense, but glad that he at least recognized it. “Lucifer is dead.” He said bluntly.
“Yeah?” She responded.
"Leave that poor boy alone and come help me out back here Joanna Beth, before I stick you with dish duty." while Bill laughed at the two of them, eyes shining.
“Fine, Mom,” He wolfed down his last few bites of food then jumped up. “I’m gonna go change!”
“Wait!” Sam blurted before he could stop himself, then shrank back at Death’s narrow eyed glare. “Uh, sorry, I – I just wondered… what about Adam?”
“I don’t.” Cas repeated. “Death has reinstated control over the souls within heaven, with extreme prejudice against resurrection. He interferes in nothing else, but there is not a single being in creation powerful enough to cross him.” He paused, allowing humor to creep into his voice.  “Not even you, Dean.”
Jess raised her eyebrows at him. “How about the beginning?” She suggested, slightly acerbic. Sam smiled at her, hopelessly fond.
"Yeah, why wouldn't he be?"
“Yeah,” Lisa agreed. “Whatever the hell that means.” He laughed shakily, and she grinned back.
Everyone was covered in blood and dirt, clothes torn and grimy. Even Gabriel and Rowena, for all their power, looked disheveled, too tired to straighten out their appearance like they normally would. The high-maintenance pair had still each snapped themselves up a chair rather than slump in the ground like all the others. To the entertainment of the group, Rowena had made a sly comment about her chair being better quality, which then somehow led to a wholly ridiculous contest between the witch and the archangel in which they both began producing abominably gaudy thrones with ever more outlandish decorations in an attempt to outdo each other.
It hadn’t happened, of course. Jess’s mother had cooed over him, and her father had shaken his hand without any of the macho posturing that dads in movies always seemed to do. They’d been kind and welcoming and utterly normal, and Sam had taken their daughter from them in a way so much worse than what they had been expecting.
“Well, you’ll never know if you just stand here for the rest of eternity.”
They both nodded at him.
“I wish it were,” Cas said, unsure why the almost imperceptible hurt in Dean’s voice disturbed him so much. “I would endeavour to see you even if I had no practical reason to. That I do merely provides… a good excuse.”
Dean froze, bottle halfway to his mouth. His head snapped towards Cas, his brows angled downwards in a way that looked angry, but on Dean meant that he wanted to hide whatever it was that he was truly feeling.
"Bye boys!"
"It wasn't a cakewalk, no." He said somberly. Sam nodded, skin crawling as he remembered the bone-chilling fear and regret of facing down familiar men and women who never should have died. "To be honest, I don't remember too much of it. I know I was angry. The kind of anger that wipes out everything else. That makes you desperate for something, anything to turn it on." His dark eyes were haunted. "I'm sorry that it ended up being you."
"Victor, wait up!" He called. The former FBI agent paused, eyebrows flying up as Sam approached.
"Sure thing, Dracula." Victor took a last swig of his beer and stood. "Be right back."
The thing about dying, Sam supposed, was that it eliminated a lot of people’s skepticism, so at least the disbelief had been kept to a minimum, but all that had really done was leave more room for horror and disgust at the reality of his life. Jess had cried when he told her the details of his childhood – more so than when he’d given her the sanitized version when they were in college – had turned green when he talked about the death he’d seen and caused, had sobbed when he talked about Dean’s sacrifice for him, the hopelessness and despair of being hounded by Lucifer.
“Congratulations,” the mild voice came from somewhere to his left, and his eyes flew open at the sound of it. He bolted upright, eyes landing on the man who stood a few meters away from him, bone-thin and pale and radiating a chilling sense of quiet. Whoever he was, he seemed unperturbed by Sam’s reaction, his face unmoving from it’s neutral expression, his hand resting easily on his cane. “You actually succeeded,” the man continued placidly. “I did wonder if you would.”
“I expect that it’s discouraged. But, you’re human.  When do any of you let something as insignificant as rules stop you?” Death sounded amused, which was only marginally less terrifying than when he sounded annoyed. He shifted and turned to walk away. “As much as I’ve enjoyed our little chat, I am a very busy person, Sam. I must be going.”
"I checked his soul, Ma'am. It's definitely him. I went to the Reaper headquaters, too. They all said that Death himself brought him here!" He seemed awed by the fact.
Seriously, he planned on holding off on introducing those two. The phone call he’d had with Bobby and the conversations he’d been having with Lisa were way too similar for Dean’s comfort, though Bobby had sworn a whole lot more.
"As well as can be expected, given the circumstances." He looked up and found everyone watching him attentively. "Raphael sees himself as the logical choice for ruler of heaven, now that Michael is gone. He is the last remaining archangel, so traditionally speaking, he is correct. But many of our siblings," He gestured between himself and Samandriel, hovering behind him, "disagree. They're angry."
A solid glass tumbler thunked down in the bartop, making both of them jump. Ellen brandished a towel at Mary, face stern.
"I'd vote for ya," Ellen grinned.
"Thank you." Cas said softly. It was strange how much a little encouragement could bolster his spirits. He paused to reorganise his thoughts. "Sam."
“It was good. I normally sneak into empty hotel rooms to sleep, so it was nice no know no one would come and try to kick me out.” He’d somehow already cleared his plate and was eyeing the leftovers. Dean wordlessly pushed the pan with the extra bacon towards him, trying to rub the bruise forming on his leg as surreptitiously as possible.
"You've been around demons?" Dean asked urgently. Jesse rolled his eyes.
"It also means that Raphaels options are extremely limited," Cas mused. "Either he accepts that things have changed for good, or..." He paused, suddenly noticing that everyone human had focused on him with hawk-like intensity, and Samandriel had apparently joined in out of solidarity.
“Okay, kid,” Dean said, leaning forward to pick up his plate. “Stay safe out there, alright? And feel free to swing by if you end up in the same neighborhood as me, okay? Give me a little peace of mind.”
“Not that involved,” Sam muttered, thinking uncharitably of the time they died to get a conversation with the guy and he essentially told them to get lost. Jess’ hand waving got more violent.
"She's not wrong," Cas said. "I found myself constantly frustrated with your recklessness while on Earth."
None of it was right; he should have been trapped and in pain, still listening to Lucifer rage inside his skull, promising retribution for daring to defy him. The tranquility around him shouldn’t exist.
"Well, yeah," Ellen agreed. "Have you seen the decisions these morons make when you leave them to their own devices?"
For a moment, all that Dean could do was stare blankly, still too numb in mind and body to do anything else, but his hand, where Cas was touching it - the smallest brush of fingers on palm - found itself gripping back. And Cas, who for all he had learned from them, was still awkward and stiff and bad at reading people, shifted just a tiny bit closer and oh-so-softly squeezed Deans fingers.
"Yeah, I get that. Things really did work out pretty well, all things considered."
"Shit." Sam concluded, dread sinking icy claws into his gut. Mary and Ellen both nodded in agreement, eyes serious. "That is definitely not a good thing."
"So it's like a presidential campaign," Victor said contemplatively.
"And he is your friend." Rachel said knowingly. "We understand, Castiel."
She shook her head at him, eyes fixed on his.  “I… I don’t…” She stopped, looked around the room as though searching for answers as the faux calm that heaven had cast over her began to crack. “Did we drive here?”
He couldn't help but tense as he approached the door though.
“Sam?” She asked, voice small. “What’s…what’s wrong?
“Can they do that?” Sam asked, surprised.
She laughed giddily next to his ear, her voice thick.  “I can’t believe it!” She drew back and he released her, trying not to let on just how reluctant he was to let her out of his grasp. “What are you doing here?”
"Well, he - he dragged both of them to hell. They ain't ever coming back."
Plastering on a neutral expression that he hoped conveyed
"Riff raff?" Samandriel said interestedly.
They sat there, holding onto each other for a long time. The light outside changed, fading from clear blue daylight to the dazzling array of stars and galaxies that filled heaven’s simulated sky. Sam watched it with dull eyes, feeling cracked open and raw.
"Goodnight," he murmured.
“Just in time, Jesse. I’m about to plate up,” Dean nodded at the empty seat and grabbed the plates, setting them out on the table. Hesitantly, Jesse made his way over, offering a shy smile to Lisa and Ben as he sat. He looked better after sleeping, his eyes clearer and his shoulders lees tense, though he still wasn’t anywhere near relaxed.
Finally, Jess pulled away, wiping at her nose with an undignified sniff. “Well, that sucked.” She said dryly through her stuffy nose, and startled a laugh out of Sam. She giggled at him, an octave too high to be normal.
"Since you're here anyway," she'd said breezily, while Dean tried to convey how very not-qualified for childcare he was at her through expression alone. All she'd done was smirk at him, sadistically amused by his distress.
Cas kept pressing his face against Deans head, almost rubbing, like a cat. It was odd, but sweet, and later, Dean might gently tease him for it. He smoothed his free hand over Deans back, murmuring soft reassurances that Dean hardly payed attention to, focusing instead on the voice that was saying them. It could have been in English or Enochian, or something else altogether. He didn’t really care. Being able to hear the rumble of Cas’ voice in his ear was enough.
Dean scoffed again, louder, his mouth opening with the clear intention to argue.
Which meant that he was going to get dressed and smile and teach a kid how to fix a goddamned car, and he would not curl up into a pathetic ball in a corner and wait for death to come and take him. He wouldn’t. Even if he tried, he had a sneaking suspicion that Lisa would appear and kick his ass back to functionality, and call Bobby to help her.
"Good for you, kid." Ellen said warmly. He wilted a little at the nickname, and Cas felt a soft prickle of amusement at his disgruntled expression.
At that moment , Jack was blinking sleepily with his head resting on Claire’s shoulder. The two of them made an unlikely pair - her all biting sarcasm and spiky personality and him with his endless optimism and enthusiasm. When they first met, Jack had managed a remarkable resemblance to a baby duck; following Claire around with an awestruck expression, and, once he had gathered up the courage to speak actual words to her, theorizing in that odd, sincere way of his that since Castiel was both sort of his father and sort of her father that they were basically brother and sister.
"Uh, yeah," Sam confirmed. "One minute I'm falling into the Cage, the next I'm lying by the road up here, being told by the scariest person that I've ever met that Lucifer is dead and I am too."
“Chill dude, you’re right. Sleep and me haven’t been having a good time lately. Who knows, I might feel less dead tomorrow.”
Dean waved a dismissive hand.
“Thank you.”
The smell of bacon sizzling woke him up properly, along with the sharp sting of hot oil leaping from the pan onto his wrist and making him hiss loudly. It also seemed to act like a beacon, summoning the other occupants of the house downstairs in their pajamas and bedheads.
“Unless you have coffee, don’t talk to me.” She muttered at him. He grinned at her, just to wind her up, but obligingly handed the pot over. She groaned in ecstasy and poured herself a cup. Dean turned back to the stove and flipped the bacon, turning the hob with the eggs off so that they would stay warm without getting burnt.
“Okay,” Sam smiled back, feeling it waver at the edges as joy and sorrow warred in his chest. “And – Jess? I promise. Any answers, any explanations you need – I’ll give them to you.”
"That's dumb," He told Dean, finally going back to his pizza slices. Dean huffed a laugh.
"Night," she said, turning the light off, leaving Dean in darkness once more.
“Well, yeah,” Dean said automatically. Lisa shrugged at him.
“I can’t imagine what you’ve been through. I know you told me a lot of it, but the amount of pain you must be in? It’s… there’s no way for me to wrap my head around it. I bet that happiness seems… further away than the moon right now.” Dean didn’t respond beyond a shrug. She wasn’t wrong.
Castiel now had an office. It was large and bland and would have been incredibly empty if he hadn't strong-armed Rachel and Hannah into sharing it with him. They had both protested, unused to having a superior willing to lower themselves to their level, but Cas had steamrollered their arguments out of sheer desperation.
Sam’s blood turned to ice – this was it. She’d gone nuts. The insanity of his life had finally managed to ruin someone else’s death, which would be impressive if it weren’t so awful. Why had he let Mary convince him this was a good idea?
"...Hi." Said Jesse Turner, tiny and  freckle-faced and weary beyond his years. "Can I come in?"
“How’d you know Dean?” Ben piped up after about three bites, clearly unable to hold back his curiosity any longer. Jesse looked surprised, eyes flicking between Ben and Dean, but Dean stayed quiet, unwilling to say anything that Jesse might not want shared with two complete strangers.
Cas smiled ruefully. “Heaven is… tense at the moment. But currently it’s nothing I can’t handle.” He looked Dean in the eye. “I appreciate your offer of help, Dean. If I ever do need it…” He let himself trail off. Dean nodded, cleared his throat.
He dissolved into incoherent apologies, choking on them, trying to get all of them out at once and breaking down into sobs, years worth of regret all pouring out of him at once. Distantly, he registered a scraping noise, the sound of a chair being dragged closer, and a warm set of arms curled around him, pulling him into a familiar embrace, and he sobbed harder, hating himself for needing to be comforted when he was meant to be comforting her.
“Alright, I’ll leave you alone. You can go and be manly and emotionally repressed with your car.”
Another name on the long list of people who Dean had broken his promises to. At least this one was still breathing, which he chose to demonstrate just then with a loud snort.
"Everything went quiet about a week ago," Jesse said, impressively clear through his set of chipmunk cheeks. "All the demons just - disappeared."
“Sam,” Jess said, trying for firm, but wavering badly. Her hand gripped at his so hard it was painful. “What happened when you came home? I remember hearing you come in, but…”
"Lisa and Ben, they're friends of mine. Non hunting ones, that is. I've kinda taken over their guest room while I get my head back on straight."
"But then, last week-" He shrugged, swallowed his mouthful. "They vanished. I waited to see if they'd come back but they didn't, so..."
Letting out the breath that he’d been holding since he’d decided to question the most powerful being he’d ever met, Sam laughed shakily to himself and started down the road towards whoever was waiting for him at the end.
However, away from their little group, Dean stood, tense and still and silent. Sam frowned a little; he knew the feeling of abruptly being yourself again, of walking away from being worn almost to shreds by something huge and bright and burning, and everything afterwards feeling unreal and lopsided, like being drunk and alone at five in the morning, the world left strange and liquid.
Sam let out a soft breath.
“I’ll go.” Sam started a little, tilting his head back to look up at Cas where he was leaning against the driver side door, staring off towards Dean. Cas glanced down at Sam and straightened up as he watched.
"He did look worried though," Ellen admitted, brow furrowing. "Stressed, like he had a lot going on."
"Now don't you start up that nonsense, Mary Winchester. Sam's right. You were up against Heaven and Hell and destiny and all that crap, and you can bet that if they hadn't gotten through you one way, then they would have found another. Most likely one far worse than what you got. So you accept that you did your best, and that your son grew up into one of the finest men on the planet despite everythin' that those bastards put him through, and move the hell on." She pulled out a bottle of whiskey and poured a healthy serving into the glass before pushing it at Mary. "Or you'll drive yourself mad." Ash poked his head out from the back room and hollered at her, so she patted Sam's hand and went to deal with him.
Death raised a slender eyebrow at his disbelief.
Inexplicably, the idea of Jesse taking off again made a solid cold lump settle just under Dean's ribcage. Maybe he was latching onto a new cause or whatever, falling prey to his hero complex, but he really, really wanted to see the kid sleeping properly, eating something decent, smiling without it seeming forced. Wanted to do something nice for someone for a change.
He ended up ordering more pizza than they'd actually be able to eat in one sitting, because he figured variety was good, and anything they didn't get through would make a decent lunch tomorrow. Ben wasn't the most verbose kid, so he didn't seem too bothered that Dean didn't make much dinner conversation, beyond checking that the food was okay and asking Ben to rinse his plate when he finished. (Dean had made the mistake of not rinsing his plate before putting it in the dishwasher exactly one time. In his defense, it wasn't like he'd had the chance to use dishwashers very often in his life, which may have been all that saved him.)
“Yeah, but… how did you get here? What do you remember from before?”
“I will ensure that your dreams remain pleasant once I leave,” Cas promised. Dean sent him and indecipherable look but didn’t say anything. “I have news.”
But now, gathered around the impala and Jody’s cruiser, Dean had separated from their little rag tag group. Exhaling softly in resignation and concern, Sam shifted, palm digging into the dry, gritty earth, abused muscles creaking in protest at the idea of moving.
"Hey, uh," He stopped. Forged onwards. "If - if there's anything I can do for you? Just say the word, man, I'll be there, okay? Just because I'm out of the game doesn't mean I can't play. Even... even if you just need someone to talk to. I mean, turnabout's fair play, huh?" He slumped, rolled his eyes at himself. "Okay. Offer's there. If you need it. Take care of yourself, Cas."
"Great," Dean said cheerfully. "I'll go change the sheets in the guest room. I'll take the couch."
"Yeah, Dean gave Jo a bit of trouble when she first started out." Sam took a sip of beer, reminiscing fondly. "I think it was his big-brother complex coming out more than anything else, but she still set him straight."
She made a series of incomprehensible sputtering noises, hands waving erratically.  “The Devil, Sam! God! You actually had God directly involved in your life! That is…”
"Okay." She fiddled with her shoes, still hanging loosely from her hands. "I'm going to get some sleep, and you should try to do the same." She eyed the rumpled mess of blankets that Dean had created tossing and turning earlier. "We'll have a talk about Jesse in the morning. When he's around to speak for himself, I think." She stepped forward to press a kiss to Dean's forehead, the same way she did every night.
Dean groaned as he climbed the stairs, making his way back to the guest room to get dressed, smiling to himself when he spotted Ben peeking through the crack in his door to see if he was ready yet. It was cute, how excited the kid seemed.
"You're mad at him?"
"Will you teach me about cars? I think they're cool, but Mom doesn't know very much about them."
"Yeah. Your brother."
"Yeah," Sam chuckled disbelievingly "I knew she was good but... Damn."
"I haven't hurt anyone,"  He'd started defensively.
Dean flicked some water at him, and he ducked, grinning. It actually looked genuine.
The first of these incidents had been with Sam, when the archangel had decided to announce his return from the Empty by materializing in the shower just as Sam was entering it, with a shit-eating grin and holding a video camera. (For the sake of his sanity, Sam did his best not to think about where exactly that footage had ended up.) Maybe when Dean was back on his feet, he could help Sam come up with some appropriate revenge.
Dean froze, glass poised halfway between the table and his mouth. Christ, this kid. It was ridiculous to be so fond of someone you'd spent less that two weeks with, total, wasn't it?
Jesse frowned at him.
"Non-family hunters. Everyone who wasn't in the inner circle, or whatever we're calling it these days." She sounded begrudgingly entertained by the whole thing. "Only Harvelles and Winchesters allowed in at the moment, a few exceptions aside." She winked at Victor, who rolled his eyes.
“Your life is… insane, Sam!”
"Yes." Castiel said, while Samandriel nodded vigorously beside him. "I came to see him."
Going by Jesse’s expression, he could have asked for a purple elephant and it would have been less weird, but he just nodded awkwardly and ducked out of the door instead of protesting, so Dean counted it as a win.
Dean exhaled, hands clenching into fists, shoulders rising. He wanted to punch something, that much was clear, was aching for some kind of violence to exorcise his turmoil on.
Sam shook his head, throat thick.
"Seriously," He said, looking Jesse in the eyes. "I've been worrying about you ever since you took off."
A few hours later, once breakfast had been eaten and cleared away, and Ben had been bundled off to school, Lisa cornered Dean in the living room and requested that they ‘talk,’ which was one of the few words that could strike true fear into Dean Winchester’s heart. It must have shown on his face, because Lisa had the audacity to giggle at him.
“So, Jesse,” Lisa cut in, kicking Dean under the table. “Did you sleep okay? I know Dean’s been fine on the spare bed, but he grew up in motels so I don’t trust his judgement.”
"Yeah, you can probably  make your own five-star hotel whenever you want," Dean grinned at him. "But sometimes you just want to be somewhere that has home-cooked meals every once in a while. I make a mean breakfast." He pushed his chair back and grabbed Jesse's plate, forcing himself to seem nonchalant so as not to spook the kid.
Needless to say, Jack had become very good at using his powers for healing out of necessity, and it often took a lot out of him; when asked, he would simply say that he was glad to be using his powers to fix something, rather than to destroy. Sam had praised him for it, and he had been so thrilled that he had quite literally floated around the bunker for about a day and a half, causing Maggie to shriek and hit him in the face with a book when she was interrupted in the library by a bright “Hello!”.
“Trust me, I know. I was there.”
“That wasn’t…”
“Are you going to be alright?” He asked. Dean sighed, but he was still smiling, just a bit.
“Okay, that was a bit rude.” She admitted.  “I’m sorry.”
It was funny, how quickly Dean had settled into a routine of domesticity while staying in Lisa and Ben’s house, and how much he enjoyed it. Making breakfast seemed like such a mundane thing, but it stopped his hands from shaking and chased away the remnants of his bad dreams. It felt good, plating up well-made food for people he cared about and watching them enjoy it.
Sam stared at her, wide eyed, and she softened.  “You owe Jess a real explanation, Sam. Forget the way you feel for a few minutes and focus on her, okay? And if she hates you, then we’ll deal with it.”
“That’s what I thought.” Lisa cupped his chin in one hand and leaned forward to kiss his forehead. “So start small. Start with ‘not unhappy’. Anything more than that? You have time to figure out, Dean. I promise.”
Lisa's book had said something about that. 'Healthy coping mechanisms,' or whatever. A hobby or something that you could do to make yourself feel better, or express your emotions or some kind of shrink crap. It made sense, in a way, but Dean's 'hobbies' were all either violent or self-destructive in some way, and the odds of him changing that seemed pretty slim.
With a final smile, Cas stood and prepared to take flight.
In his minds eye, he held every picture of Jess he could summon. The way she slept face-down, mouth open with hair everywhere. The way she used to contort herself over her books as she studied,  her limbs folding into interesting knots while she concentrated. The way her smile would turn wicked when she spied Sam watching her with heat in his eyes, the way she would curse when she stubbed her toe, loud and crass, then switch to yelling at him if he laughed at her.
“You can say that again,” he muttered.
Jesse offered her a timid smile.
"She, uh, got me this book," Dean scratched at his eyebrow, feeling small and dumb. "'Losing Loved Ones: The Five Stages Of Grief And How To Cope, or some shit like that. Said it helped her through her dad's death. And, you know, I figured it couldn't hurt, right?" He tried for a laugh, but it got mangled somewhere in his throat and came out closer to a sob.
"Yeah, kid," he said when the pause began to drag on a little too long. "Tomorrow afternoon okay? I can show you the basics when I gived the Impala a tune up."
“Apple pie life,” Dean said roughly, scrubbing at his stupid, watery eyes.
Dean snorted.
"I'm sorry we got you killed," Sam said shakily. Victor scoffed.
He refused to look back at Lisa, because he knew that she would be wearing that expression that made him feel flayed open and exposed, like she could see straight through to his soul.
“Stop it, you’ll make me blush,” Dean muttered, but he looked happier. “What’s shaking, then Cas?”
“Trust me, I’d’ve loved for the kid to stick around. But kids like that?” He tipped his head towards the hallway where Jesse had vanished. “They’re used to doing things on their own. They don’t want to owe anyone, and they don’t want to be controlled by anyone. If I’d tried to keep him around, I’d never see him again. Hell, I still might. But at least now he’s got a full stomach and someone to come to if he really needs it.”
“Yeah!” Ben sat up straighter. “Right now?”
Beyond the limits of human perception, Cas entered the house, searching through the rooms until he found Dean, laid out on a double bed, sleeping fitfully. It was late, and the other occupants of the house were deeply unconscious, but Dean shifted and grunted in his sleep, clearly plagued by nightmares.
“Sure, Cas. Go for it. God knows the two of us have worn the ‘are you okay after traumatic events’ talk to death. Maybe it’ll work better coming from someone new.” Cas pulled a bit of a face at that, as though to say he very much doubted it. But then he nodded, and, after a slight hesitation, strode purposefully away from the car. Sam’s smile turned a little knowing as he watched him go, but he turned his head to give them some privacy. Exasperatedly, he then rolled his eyes at Gabriel and Rowena whose competition had apparently graduated into seeing who could create the best dragon illusion.
Cas sat back in his chair, mind spinning. Sam Winchester's fate had been a source of great sadness for Castiel. The man had been a true friend to him, offering advice and reassurance, a sympathetic ear when the weight of the world threatened to come down and crush them all. That he might be able to see him once more - convey his freedom from Lucifer's control to Dean, to lessen some of his suffering on Earth - it was the first truly good news that Cas had recieved since returning to heaven. He stood.
Distantly, Dean registered footsteps approaching. Probably Sam - after all, how many times had they danced this fucking dance? Sam would come up to him, hover for about a minute and then would either try to make him talk about feelings or some shit, or would try and distract him somehow, as if that was possible anymore. It came as a surprise then, when the person standing next to him reached out silently, and gently took his hand.
"That wasn't your fault."
"Who's this?" He asked, offering a hand to Samandriel.
"Dracula?" Samandriel questioned softly.
Holy shit. How the hell was Sam supposed to respond to something like that? He’d been braced for an eternity trapped in the worst part of hell, had welcomed it, even, knowing that it was the only way to save the world. But now – what? He’d somehow managed to weasel out of it? He got to go to Heaven? It sounded way to good to be true.
Death hummed quietly. “Not your personal Heaven, I’m afraid. I believe Raphael destroyed it when he received the news of what you did. This one, I believe, began as your friend Ash’s, and has now become something of a communal midpoint for hunters who knew each other in life.”
Stood on the green grass of the Braeden’s front lawn, Cas took a moment to breathe, to let the weight of command drop from his shoulders, if only for a while. He knew that he couldn’t stay long, that only the fact that he had important news justified his coming at all, but he couldn’t help but revel in the illusion of freedom.
So that was what it was like to have your be mother angry at you. It felt startlingly similar to when Dean was angry at him, which wasn't a feeling he wanted to examine too closely. He didn't like it.
"Yeah, Sam was just asking how we managed to swing the multiple-heaven thing," Mary told him. He lit up, sliding neatly out from behind the bar, beer in hand, to perch on Sam's other side.
“I have my own people to go and see, mister. You’re a big boy, Sammy, you can handle this. Get!” She made a shooing motion at him, and he laughed and turned back to the blurring line of the threshold between heavens.
"Sure, kid," Ellen said easily. "Swing by any time."
“Wife and kids, I think is what Sam had in mind.” He admitted. “I don’t know if that’s on the table, though.”
She let out a soft huff of laughter, face twitching in confusion.  “What do you mean?” She said, eyes flickering around the room. “This is my parents house, you know that.” Something a little like fear shone in her eyes, and Sam hated himself for causing it.
Lisa’s eyebrows had risen halfway up her forehead, but Ben looked enthralled.
"Samandriel," Hannah said sharply. "Are you sure?"
"Hey, Cas." Dean began, leaning over the kitchen sink. In the living room a new program was starting, somthing with a catch theme song that he didn't know. "I, uh, know you're probably busy but... I just wanted to reach out. Check in, you know." Jesus Christ, he sounded dumb.
he told himself.
Gabriel was still sore from the failed portal of the year before, for all he denied it. These days dead set on proving he he was back to full strength - hence the unnecessary display of power. Rowena, however, was the reigning champion of these competitions; it seemed that what she lacked in power she more than made up for in imagination and trickery.
She buried her face in her hands, wheezing, while Sam peered at her with concern. Her head snapped up. “Oh, God,” she said blankly. “I’m the fridged love interest, aren’t I?
“Gee, Cas, why don’t you just call me a giant sissy and be done with it?”
"Cas!" He shouted, and jumped forward to pull Cas into a brief hug while he froze in shock. "Shit," Sam said, releasing him. "Sorry man, it's just - it's good to see you." His eyes flickered curiously over to Samandriel.
"He might've already taken off," Dean said quietly. "But he just looked... I don't know, run down. Like he hadn't had the chance to stop for a while."
"No," he said hastily. "I mean, uh - I don't think so?" He glanced between her and the stairs, and she did the same, squinting at him. "Look, it's nothing bad, I promise."
He’d given up on lying down a few hours ago, back when it had still been dark. Watching the light seeping through the curtains go from grey to blueish to yellow had been a nice way to pass the time while he sat hunched over on the edge of the bed, eyes stinging with the effort it took to keep them open, his brain playing a never ending loop of Sam, falling and Sam, dying and Sam, screaming.
“Do you know where you are?”
The doorbell rang, and Dean jumped, then frowned. Lisa hadn't said she was expecting anybody, and she'd always, always let him know about stuff like that before. Sometimes it felt a little like being treated with kid gloves, but Dean was a paranoid bastard and he knew it, so mostly he just felt grateful.
"Sam Winchester, you son of a bitch, you
"What about Dean?" Sam asked. He seemed unduly focused on the floorboards, but his face was twisted with pain. "Does he know about this?"
Jesse sat on the edge of his seat, tense as a wire, eyes flickering constantly between his plate, Dean and the door, so regularly that Dean bet he could have set a clock by it. He ate methodically - not rushing, trying to to seem rude, but quickly all the same, without wasting so much as a few crumbs. It pained Dean to see it in a kid as young as he was, but he knew better than to comment.
"Yes," Cas agreed solemnly. "I've been... busy, of late."
"Sure thing." She settled herself down at a table. "You picked a good time to come by, I just kicked out the last of the riff raff."
"No. Not really. I mean, there used to be loads of them everywhere - getting ready for the end, you know? But I never spoke to any of 'em, and none of them ever figured out who I am. But I could hear them. Kinda in the back of my head, if they were angry or excited. I tuned it out most of the time - it was annoying." He looked annoyed, too, like hearing demon voices was down there with staticky radios on the list of general irritations that people have to deal with.
"Well, you'd better keep on truckin', then," Ellen said faintly. "I don't particularly feel like havin' a do-over."
Ben blew a raspberry.
“Oh yeah, where was he during the apocalypse? Or before, even, when your bosses first decided to play  Frankenstein with me?”
“Stupid?” Lisa suggested. “Dumb?”
“Dean?” He turned, offering a smile to Lisa, who stood sleep-tousled and groggy in the doorway, watching him with a bemused expression. “You’re making breakfast?” She sounded perplexed, but not unhappy.
"Lucifer like, exploded him." Sam made a 'boom' motion with his hands to demonstrate. "And he'd lost his angel mojo before that. Like, all of it, he couldn't even fly any more."
“Okay, we’re going to start with the basics,” Dean said. “Where do you think the oil is?”
“Souls go where they belong,” Death responded curtly. “You made a very dramatic sacrifice for your family and the world and saved billions of lives. Your soul belonged in Heaven, and so I brought you here. I am Death, Sam. There is nowhere in the universe that is off limits to me.”
“He reminds you of yourself, doesn’t he?’ She asked softly. He paused in slotting the rinsed plates in the dishwasher. He risked a glance up, but he’d been right about her expression, so he glanced back down again and nodded.
!" until her mother barked at her to
“Stop looking at me like that.” She snapped. “You just dropped a huge amount of information on me, and I fully intend to process it on my own terms. So you-“ She jabbed a finger into his chest, “- quit looking at me like I’m doing mental breakdowns wrong.”
“What?” He got out.
“Maybe it is. But you told me that you promised to try.” Shit. It all came back to that stupid, unfair, unbreakable promise. The last promise he’d ever made. The last one he ever could make. The one that he would die trying to keep. He shook his head again, but it wasn’t a denial so much as a last-ditch protest, and he changed it into a nod halfway through and probably ended up looking like one of those bobble-head things that always gave him the creeps.
"I hope to see you soon." And with that, he spread his wings, and took flight.
After a few minutes had passed, Sam couldn’t take waiting anymore and got up to tidy the table. Snotty tissues sucked, but at least they wouldn’t start yelling at him. Hands busy, he turned over the conversation they’d had in his mind. For the most part, Jess had listened, cutting in every now and then with a question, but silent more often than not.
"Mmm." Mary huffed quietly. "Hunting women normally do. There aren't many of us, so we have to get loud to be heard." Her mouth twisted over the word 'us' like it tasted sour on her tongue.
"Oh yeah," he said enthusiastically. "Totally off-regulation, right? The big bosses had this whole, keep-em-seperate policy, don't ask me why 'cause I'm not sure,
"I leave you alone for a few hours," She sighed, but it didn't sound angry and Dean allowed himself to relax a little. She looked up at him, strangely two-dimensional in the sleepy haze of after-midnight.
“Maybe go and did out some old clothes, Ben, if you’re going to be messing around with cars,” suggested Lisa. “I don’t want you complaining if I have to throw out one of your favorite shirts because you decided getting oil all over it was a good idea.” She mock-scowled at him, then laughed when he rolled his eyes.
“Bye Cas,” Dean said. “Don’t let the god squad bring you down, alright?”
It didn’t even hurt any more, which almost worried him. How fucked up was he, that even his worst nightmares couldn’t break through the numbness? In a way, though, Dean was grateful. Numbness was better than pain. He’d had enough of that for a thousand lifetimes.
“And Ellen and Jo,” Cas confirmed. “William Harvelle, Victor Henriksen, Pamela Barnes. Many others. Your father is in heaven, but I understand that he is currently banished from any place that your mother is currently inhabiting.”
“I should probably go.” He murmured.
“Well, you’re welcome here anytime,” Lisa said, smiling warmly. “Just say the word.”
"You'd make breakfast." Jesse said flatly. Dean turned from rinsing and pointed at him, feeling closer to playful than he had in weeks.
“See you on the other side, I guess,” He told her, then took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and stepped forward.
“Hello Dean,” Cas responded. “I received your prayer. I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner.”
"Sorry baby," Bill said sincerely. "Next time I go to the range I'll leave you behind, okay? So you don't miss anything. Ow!" He jumped away from her agressive elbow jab, laughing. Sam watched the two of them warmly. He'd never realised just how big an absence Bill had been in Jo and Ellen's lives until he got to sit and watch them light up with him around.
"Yeah?" He finally said, wondering what the hell he was supposed to say if the kid asked for details. Ben looked mildly impressed.
But all of that paled in comparison to the woman sat at his side, hand in his, blue blue eyes filled with tears. Mary Winchester was radiant here, dressed in a flowy top and jeans, hair long and impractically loose, beaming at Sam like he was a miracle, like he might disappear at any moment. There was no plaid camoflage, no concessions to the  hunter aesthetic. She was defiant in her softness, and Sam loved her all the more for it.
"Okay," he exhaled. "Okay, so, uh - there's this kid, his name's Jesse. He's half demon - great kid!" He added hastily, seeing Lisa's alarmed expression. "Completely normal except for these crazy powers, but he's got control over them so no worries there, uh..." He scrubbed a hand through his hair. The middle of the night was not a good time for stuff like this. "Anyway, he came by, asked if all the shit with the shit was over, and, uh, I gave him the guest room." He finished lamely.
"So..." Sam groped desperately for a subject change. "Whats the deal with the whole communal heaven thing? The last time i was here it seemed like everyone got their own little 3D cinema of their greatest hits, but this -" He gestured around appreciatively. "- This is different. Awesome, but... not really Angel approved."
"I look forward to it," he glanced over his shoulder before meeting Victor's eyes. "You know, I remember us making a pretty good team."
"So?" Dean asked, drying his hands. "You staying the night?"
"I'm sorry," he murmured. Mary glanced at him, then away. "You know, he, uh, he tried his best -"
"God, why is it that I miss everything?" Jo complained to Sam once he'd finished filling her and Bill in on Cas' visit. "I thought it might stop after I died, but nope! Still out of the loop."
Sam opened his mouth. Closed it. “That’s… it’s a long story.” He caught sight of her narrowing eyes. “I’ll tell you all of it, I promise,” He said hurriedly. “I’m just… trying to think of where to start.”
"You aren't fancy enough to be Gordon Ramsey." But he was smiling. "What about Lisa?"
“Heaven.”
“Do you… wanna come in?” She stepped backwards, motioning towards the door, smile still hanging bravely onto her face.
"Sam Winchester, get your butt over here!' Yelled Jo from where she, Pamela and Ash were holding court. "We need your Stanford education to settle a bet!"
And he booked it out of there before Jesse could protest.
“Um,” he swallowed around the razor-sharp lump in his throat. “Nothing, I just… I’m really happy to see you, Jess.”
“Uh, yeah? Kind of?”
Sam jumped slightly, sitting up at Cas' sudden focus. "The reapers informed us that Death himself brought you here."
"Uh oh," Sam said, tension fading from his shoulders as he wove his way between tables. "What kind of bet?"
“Yeah?” He responded warily.
“Mornin’,” Dean said as they shuffled in. Lisa’s nose scrunched up at him, her eyes squinted so hard they were almost shut.
Dean winced slightly at the ruckus he made charging up the stairs. Jesse stood too, abeit much more slowly.
"Cool," he said. "Can we have pizza for dinner?" And that, apparently, was it.
And at his side, hand firmly clasped in his, walked Cas.
A few feet away, Jo had been wiping up a spillage on one of the tables, and gave Sam a sympathetic hip-check as she walked past.
"Hey!' Sam protested, laughing.
“This is really Heaven,” he whispered, hope like he hadn’t felt in years springing to joyful life in his chest.
A choked off noise escaped Dean’s throat, and Cas stopped, concern spiking. Dean let out a low, shaky breath, pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes. He sniffed.
"No, kid," Dean had protested. "You're just fine, alright? I'm glad to see you."
"Hey, uh..." Sam paused, glancing around the room. In the corner, Victor Henriksen raised his glass at him. Caleb and Pastor Jim offered him proud smiles, and Pamela gave him a blatant once over, complete with a salacious wink. He looked back at his mother. "Where's Dad? Is he here?"
“What, the angels are all out of resurrection juice? You couldn’t bring Sam with you when you came down here for a little chat? Did you expect me to be fucking grateful?” Deans voice got louder, his steps faster as he paced murderously. Darkness crept in around them until all they could see was each other.
"Heya, Cas," He said easily, thumbing the saftey back on. "It's been a while."
Dean thought.
"You only want me around because I'm sensible," He teased.
“Was that a joke?” Dean eventually sputtered. Cas shrugged slightly, trying not to smile. Dean worked his mouth for a few moments before letting out a sputtering laugh.
Over their shoulders, he spotted Victor standing from his table, clearly preparing to leave, and he stood hurriedly, excusing himself to intercept him.
All three angels straightened, exchanging shocked looks.
Jody was hovering near to her daughter, flinching every time she caught sight of the blood still staining her hair, while Donna had started cheerfully handing around mugs of soup that she had brought in the largest thermos that Sam had seen in his life. Every so often, Donna would glance over at Cas or Rowena, who were staring down at the eye-wateringly fluorescent cups in their hands, and break into quiet giggles at the bewildered(Cas) and disgusted(Rowena) looks on their faces.
"The analogy is sound," agreed Cas.
"No - thats - no." Dean interrupted. "Not worried about
“Oh, God, I can’t do this,” Sam scraped his sweaty palms against his jeans, shoved his hair violently away from his face.
"Wasn't your fault," he croaked. Victor smiled ruefully at him.
“I’m not saying that it’ll be easy,” Lisa murmured, sitting down on the couch next to him. “But you said that you made a promise.”
"It would require phenomenal amounts of power, but yes."
“I will.” Cas promised. “Goodbye, Dean.”
“It’s good to know you catch on quickly. They did tell me you were the smart one, certain inadvisable choices aside.” He didn’t offer anything more, so Sam licked his lips nervously and dared to ask,
"I could be," Jesse said innocently. "You don't know my life."
"Samandriel," Cas and Samandriel chorused.
“Ben, you still want that mechanics lesson?” Dean said casually. Lisa glanced up.
“Okay,” Sam breathed. “Okay.” He shook out his arms like he was preparing for a fight, rolled his shoulders. Glanced back at his mother. “You sure you won’t come with me?” He asked – half pleading. She gave him a look.
Ten minutes later and they were in the garage, leaning over the open hood of the impala, dean with practiced easy and Ben with wide-eyed excitement, balancing carefully on an upturned box so that he could see properly.
“Yes you can,” Mary said, face long-suffering the way it had been since the third time she’d had to repeat herself. “Stop overthinking it.”
Michael had given him dreams like this though.
Jesse glared at him.
They both smiled, warm and tired at each other, until Jess looked away, out of the window, her expression turning lost. “Sam? Where are we?” She asked. He closed his eyes briefly.
"Castiel!" The door flew open, making all three occupants of the room jump. "Sorry, Sir, Ma'am, Ma'am," Gasped Samandriel. Castiel felt fondness well up inside him.
"You know, you don't have to take care of everyone," she said softly. Dean shifted uncomfortably.
“Um, I’m half demon?” Jesse said hesitantly. “I was meant to help the devil win the apocalypse, but Dean and Sam helped me get out of it.” He glanced around the table and started attacking his eggs with single-minded ferocity.
"So you came to see if I knew why," Dean finished for him.
“Uh, yeah,” he said, glancing between her and the pan as he flipped the bacon. “I was up early, figured I could help out a bit, y’know.” Lisa was still looking at him with that soft look on her face, and he felt his shoulders go up, defensive. “It ain’t gourmet or anythin’ but, uh,”
"Likely a figure in human pop culture," Cas murmured back. Samandriel looked fascinated.
Sam took the moment to look around properly, and suddenly realized that the stretch of road he’d found himself alongside was heart-wrenchingly familiar. Three hundred meters away, just around a bend in the road, was where the roadhouse should be.
Sam stared at her in shock.
“Three? I still love you.” She finished simply. He sucked in a breath, hope flaring to life in his chest. She held up a hand. “I don’t – I need time to process.” She said. “I need to think about everything you’ve said, and I need to figure out what I want from you, what I can give you back, knowing what I know now.” She chewed her lip. “I need time, Sam. And a promise that if I ever need more answers, you will give them to me, straight away. No lies.”
"Apparently," Sam sighed.
Distraction or punishments or twisted entertainment when he got too loud or too annoying or too quiet.  Although they had never felt this real, he still couldn’t quite trust it. Story of his fucking life, right? The corner of his mouth twitched in a parody of amusement; the first movement he had made in almost fifteen minutes. There was still a voice in his head, hissing that none of this was real, that he was deluding himself, that he should
“No,” Sam whispered. “I only just got here, remember? The last time you saw me –“ He cut himself off, suddenly uncertain that she even had seen him from her horrific pose on the ceiling of their room.  “- the last time we spoke, my brother had just come to see me, remember?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Her smile vanished completely and she pulled away, looking down into her glass of whiskey, fingers curled loosely around the rim.
“What the hell am I even going to say to her? Sorry for lying to you about my entire life, sorry that a demon murdered you to manipulate me, I love you?” He pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. “She’s going to hate me –“
onto his own chest?"
So he'd gone through the trunk and the glovebox and his jackets, pulling out the bottles and flasks that he'd stashed there over the previous months and handed them over without protest. Lisa had taken them away, and brought the flasks back empty and squeezed his shoulder with a sad smile that he didn't deserve.
“For God’s sake, you’ve faced down demons and angels and who knows what else - are you seriously telling me that I’m scarier than the apocalypse? Me?”
"Yeah," Dean said. "Sam too. He sacrificed himself to do it, which..." He chuffed, without humor. "Is how I ended up here."
Except cars, he supposed. He like fixing cars, getting his hands dirty and making something broken whole again. Maybe he could do that. Call Bobby and ask him for weekend work fixing up some of his old junkers. Take Ben along, if Lisa didn't mind. Show him the ropes. Give him an actual skill. It was a nice thought, and Dean clung to it.
They exchanged amused glances.
"Yeah, I know." He said defensively. She didn't dignify him with a response.
Sam hadn't even noticed it most of the time, but hearing it once more after so long without it made him feel like he was coming home. And that didn't even begin to cover the nostalgic smell of beer and cigarettes and gunpowder that filled the air, the low murmur of voices from behind the bar, the way the cheap lights glowed warmly from their dusty fittings.
Cas sighed and lowered himself into the seat, Sam perching next to him and Victor propping himself against the bar behind Ellen.
And she stood and walked out of the room, leaving Dean sat on her nice couch in front of her nice bay windows, feeling more lost than ever
Returning to Earth felt strange. Cas had spent so much time here in the last year, searching and fighting and falling slowly into humanity that it felt odd to return fully powered and with heavenly purpose once more. Cas didn’t miss the uncertainty that had plagued his actions on the side of the Winchesters, but there had been a sort of freedom to it, to be beholden only to a few humans who would ask rather than order, who saw him as an equal.
"Or...?" prompted Victor.
“Probably not,” He said. “But then, when am I ever?” He nudged Cas with his elbow. “What about you? You going to be okay? Heaven treatin’ you alright?”
you were doing - I've been worrying about
"You look beautiful," with a terrifying amount of sincerity, and she'd given him a peck on the cheek, hugged Ben, and sailed out of the door with a cheerful
“That’s…” he trailed off.
“I don’t have power over that.”
"I'm pretty sure we only got away with it because all the angels were so busy getting ready for doomsday. Bigger problems, you know?"
Cas nodded.
"You can say that again," Ellen knocked her shoulder gently against Sam's. "Michael trapped, Lucifer dead, Sam up here where he belongs. Almost makes up for all the crap that came before." She shook her head. "Almost."
“Yes,” Cas said. “It seemed prudent to allow you to sleep.”
“Um… thank you, ma’am.” He said softly. Lisa gave him a small nod, but dropped it, to his visible relief.
The Roadhouse door had always had a very specific creak. The kind that started deep and pitched higher as the door swung open, before petering out at the end.
She gave him a look that couldn't have conveyed 'ya think?' more clearly than if she'd had a sign over her head. Which, thinking about it, made an awful lot of sense, Sam realised. Mary had made it implicitly clear that she wanted nothing to do with the hunting world. She wanted safety and comfort and a family that didn't keep guns next to the crockery. She had given up everything for it, and her husband had thrown it all away for the sake of revenge.
"You kiddin' me?" Dean snorted. "She won't care. It's not like you're an axe murderer."
"So you don't know how he's doing." Sam surmised, rubbing a hand over his face.
"Goodbye Sam." Cas said. "Ellen, Victor."
"Don't sweat it, Cas, seriously," Sam said, though his face was disappointed. "You've got a hell of a lot on your plate right now. It was good just to see you."
When Ben had put away an impressive amount of pizza for someone barely scraping five foot, cleared his throat and asked,
He’d hugged Dean, of course. As soon as his brother had gasped his first free breath, they’d yanked each other close and choked out each other’s names, and reveled in the safety that they had only ever known with each other. But then everyone else had wanted hugs and Jack and Cas and Gabriel had needed to fix the lesser injuries that had been passed over earlier in favour of Claire’s broken neck and Mary’s gaping chest and Dean’s burnt out, shattered shell.
“God, I wish I could hug baby-you,” she laughed sadly. “All your childhood stories break my heart.”
“It’s okay,” he heard her whisper. “It’s – oh god, - it’s going to be okay.” He looked up, and she was crying too, eyes and nose running, cheeks blotchy, face blank with freshly-remembered horror, and he clutched onto her tighter, pressing a careful, shaky kiss to her hair.
It was around midnight that the sound of the front door swinging open woke Dean out of the fitful doze he'd fallen into on the couch. Lisa was nothing more than a dark silhouette in the hallway, identifiable only by her curly hair and sweet-smelling purfume. She flicked the light on, gasping when she caught sight of Dean, sitting up and yawning, one hand going to her chest in fright  and knocking the heels she must have taken off earlier against her chest.
“Oh my God!” She took a single, hesitant, step forward, then threw herself at him. He caught her easily, arms sliding back into place against the familiar shape of her body, face coming to rest on her shoulder as he lifted her up, the smell of her favorite apple-scented shampoo filling his nose.
It wasn’t particularly graceful; he essentially face planted Cas’ collarbone. His nose was crushed sideways; the weird canvas material of the trench coat was rough and the buttons dug uncomfortably into the side of Deans chest. The fabric itself still smelled of blood and gasoline and he was clutching at Cas’ hand so tightly that, had he been human, his fingers would have probably been in splinters.
"Am I going to freak out?" She said, eyes narrowing. Crap, that was a lot more than 'slightly' suspicious.
“Your unfortunate younger brother is still alive, and therefore, for now, not my problem.” He straightened his coat with a sharp tug. “Goodbye, Sam Winchester. I wish you luck. For some reason, I think you’ll still need it.” And with that, Death vanished, like he’d never been there at all.
"And Dean read it?" Ellen cut in incredulously. "Damn. I want to meet this woman."
"He'll be real glad," Victor told them seriously. "He was worried about you when he got in. Said Lucifer did you a serious injury."
"Try to move, go on. Move, fight, scream! You know how much I like to watch you fail."
“I thought my soul would be trapped even if I died.” Sam said.
“And three?” He dared to ask. Jess almost smiled.
“A for effort buddy,” He said, and Cas tried not to preen, glad that he’d at least given Dean something to smile about.
Samandriel nodded furiously.
Sharing close quaters with the Winchesters had made the very idea of solitude a terrifying one. It was ridiculous - Castiel had lived for uncounted millenia without friendship, and yet a few short months with humans and his very makeup had been changed - though he believed it was for the better.
"Sam too?"
"Christ, you scared me," She whispered. "What are you doing downstairs?" She sounded slightly suspicious, which was more than fair, considering.
At that moment in time, what Castiel ought to have been doing was organising his reports. Instead, he found himself contemplating Dean Winchester's prayer. It had been pained and heartfelt, and Cas had felt both joy and sorrow, listening to it. It seemed that he too felt lonely and uncertain in this post-apocalypse world, and Cas fully intended to take him up on his offer of conversation, as soon as he could logically excuse his absence from heaven.
It was the birdsong that first alerted Sam to the fact that something was very wrong. The birdsong, and the fact that he was lying on something that felt an awful lot like dirt and pine needles, the air around him still and warm.
“Is Mom there?” He finally asked, eyes fixed on some distant point, his voice and face deliberately disaffected.
"I'm still sorry." Sam said with a bitter twist of irony. Victor barked a laugh.
"But he cannot currently move against me. He has the power currently - almost all of upper managment are backing him. But we -" he waved one hand at the room at large "- have numbers on our side. A full scale conflict would decimate both sides, and Raphael needs the full might of heaven."
"He looked just fine to me," Ash said cheerfully. "And he showed up on the angel radar I still have going, all high-pitched and shiny."
It still seemed ridiculous to Dean, that this being, this millennia old force of nature who had seen him broken and twisted and shattered, who had betrayed and been betrayed by him, who had sacrificed everything he had ever known, who had been broken just as much and reduced to something so much less than what he should be, all because of an insignificant, useless human, could still be so grieved by his loss that it took a physical toll.
Mary eyed him in a way that said she knew exactly what he was doing, but she didn't comment on it.
In his periphery, Dean spied movement and glanced over at Jesse, stood awkwardly in the doorway, already dressed but eyeing the food hungrily.
Dean held up his hands.
Time slipped by as they stood there together, almost shyly, as if it didn’t want to disturb them. Eventually, though, Dean released Cas, and pushed himself away from him, just a little, and smiled. Not widely, or even really happily, but it was mirrored back at him, like an agreement. Like a promise. Behind them, car doors echoed as they slammed shut, good-natured bickering fading in and out as everyone argued over seats. Dean turned around to walk back to his family.
Cas frowned, shrugging slightly. “I knew that you were likely to have a strong reaction. You and your brother have always had powerful emotional responses when receiving news about the other.”
“To ask about your dad,” Jess murmured. “Then you left, with a bunch of really lame excuses…”
“Sure, bro.” Jack, being Jack, had taken this (supposed) confirmation with a beaming smile, and continued to idolize Claire, until she found her general irritation softening into heavily disguised fondness for his antics. Apparently, even she wasn’t immune to his unique brand of charm. In the quiet after the battle, they sat together against one of the trees not reduced to a smouldering stump, arms around each others shoulders, struggling to stay awake.
Heaven had always been about hierarchy, about who was in charge of who. It was always ‘your superior will hear about this’ or ‘your subordinate did that’ and though Cas was doing his best to reduce the rigidity of that system among the angels who had chosen to follow him, it was a system that had been hammered into the grace of every angel since time immemorial, and would likely never truly fade away.
"Did someone say my name?" Called Ash from behind the bar.
"Or he succeeds on regaining control of heaven and, using the full force of the Host, projects himself backwards in time to prevent Sam from succeeding in his plan to prevent the apocalypse." Cas finished grimly. Everyone stared at him in horror.
Sam smiled warmly at the angel.
“Heaven.” Death said, like it should have been obvious. Sam gaped at him.
“Sam?” She breathed. He tried to smile, but it wobbled and cracked around his sudden, helpless tears.
"Sure thing, kid." Dean said, relieved. "Your mom's having a nice night out, so we should at least get something good out of it, huh?" He dug around in the cutlery drawer, where Lisa kept the takeout menus. "What topping do you want?"
"Not yet," Cas admitted. "I haven't had the chance to return to Earth since... well. But I intend to visit him as soon as my duties allow, and I will inform him of all that has happened."
“Urgh, I’m a mess,” she grimaced, running her hands through her hair, then glanced up at Sam and paused. “Wait, no, you look worse.”
"The archangels lied to us," Samandriel cut in. He shrank back a little as the focus shifted to him, then visibly steeled himself and forged on. "None of us were told that they wanted the apocalypse. They threw us onto the front lines of a fight that they never wanted to win. They treated us like cannon fodder, when they weren't killing us themselves to keep us from questioning orders. We trusted them, and they betrayed us. We won't follow them any more." His voice weakened as he finished his speech, but Cas gave him an approving nod, and he flushed proudly.
"Hey! You boys gonna stand out there all day?" Called Ellen from somewhere inside. "Cas, you and your friend are welcome, or whatever."
“Yeah, well, demons and angels you can stab,” Dean told her, eyeing the door longingly. Lisa looked unimpressed.
“Are you having a mental breakdown?” Sam asked.
Four hours later and Sam’s voice was hoarse from talking, the table was littered with tissues and cups of coffee, and Jess had her head in her hands, staring down at the half-full bottle of scotch that had been full when they started talking.
Dean closed his eyes. Jesus, he didn’t want to start crying again. He’d let himself have a good ol’ sobfest the night before so that this wouldn’t happen during the day while there were people around to see.
He’d actually taken to watching shows on the cooking channel when Lisa was at work and Ben was at school and he didn’t feel like sitting through the cheesy soap operas that Sam used to tease him for watching. A lot of what the chefs made looked too fancy or too expensive, but some of it looked nice, simple enough, and every so often Dean found himself taking note of the name of the dish in a little notebook, with a half-baked thought that one day he could try and make one of them.
Dean didn’t sob or scream. He still wasn’t capable of that, not yet, not really. All he could really do was gasp into Cas’ shoulder and bring his other hand up to grip shakily at his back, tendons spasming minutely as though being electrocuted. His lungs were working overtime to make up for the months of running on nothing but grace, his arms wound crushingly around his best friend, his brain emptying for the first time in forever, because the endless struggle for his own body was finally, finally over.
By the time he had reached the end of the story, Jess had been almost catatonic, so drained by everything he’d already told her that she had nothing left to give. Really, her reaction had been a lot better than he’d been hoping for, he mused, as he washed out the coffee mugs.
A gentle hand touched his hair, and he jumped, but it was just Lisa, running slender fingers through the slightly greasy strands. He needed to shower, but the feeling was so nice, he couldn’t help butt lean into it, fresh tears streaking their way down his face even as he gasped and shuddered, trying to keep them back.
Cas looked both worried and hopeful, terrified and impossibly determined. His face said “I’m here”. It said “whatever you need”. It said “let me help you". Crazily, after years of cut off moments and unnamed feelings, Dean felt like maybe, finally, he could accept. They had been to hell and heaven and purgatory. They had fought off gods and monsters and even their own Goddamn families, and fuck it, right there, right then, they could be brave.
“She probably hates me,” Sam said hopelessly.
Jesse inhaled softly.
Samandriel lit up.
“Alright.” He agreed. “The beginning it is.”
"Wait," Sam said, frowning, "But thats all over now. And Lucifer is dead, so its not like they can restart it. Whats stopping them from breaking in here?"
She flapped her hand at him. “No, no, I’m totally right. You know, at the start of a movie when everything is great and they want to get the plot moving, they have to pick someone to kill off and it’s usually the hot but underdeveloped female love interest – that’s me. Jesus Christ, I died and became a cliché, that’s…” She sank down in her chair, fingers pressed into her cheeks until the skin went white from the pressure.
“He just… vanished.” She made a little ‘poof’ motion with her hands. Dean shrugged.
"So you're both idiots," Victor summarised. Samandriel let out a nervous giggle. Castiel sent him a quelling look.
Thankfully, Ben chose that moment to shuffle into the kitchen like a pint-sized zombie in soccer pajamas, and the food was ready to dish up, so Dean was saved from having to continue making awkward small talk with the woman whose life he’d butted into.
Tremulously, she smiled at him. “But, I love you. I need you to know that, because it’s true. Okay?”
Dean sneered and resumed pacing.
"No rest for the wicked, huh?" Ash asked, with a cheeky smile that died before it could reach his eyes. Sam had a sinking feeling that Ash's words were about to become a contender for 'understatement of the century.' Death's quip about him still needing luck was beginning to make a whole lot more sense.
"Thanks!" He chirped, and darted off upstairs. Were all kids that hyper? God, Dean was getting old. He laughed at himself and went to stack the dishes in the dishwasher. Outside, the sun was setting, and the light through the windows painted orange-gold stripes down the kitchen walls.
“Oh.” He blinked at her and licked his lips nervously. “Uh, you’re welcome?”
“Don’t look at me like that,” She protested. “You do!”
“That is… a lot.” She said, unmoving.
He opened his eyes.  The house in front of him didn’t look like anything special – it could have been any house on any street in America, except for the fact that he knew that it belonged to her. He’d been here once on Earth, one nail-biting weekend when Jess had taken him to her home to introduce him to her parents. He’d spent the whole time torn between longing and fear, wanting to be accepted by them by terrified that they would see past his paper-thin façade of normalcy to the freak underneath.
"Hey!" Sam said again, genuinely offended this time. "Whose side are you on? And," He jabbed an accusatory finger at Cas, "Who was it that carved an
