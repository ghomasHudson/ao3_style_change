Steve, taken aback slightly by Tony's anxiety, found confidence within himself to continue pressing.
"Tony Stark was a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist..."
Tony was tired and didn't have the energy to put up with the banter. He sighed until he heard footsteps coming closer his way. Both Natasha and him turned their heads to see who was coming. Tony eyes lit up when he saw Steve but then his face dropped after realising that Bucky was following close behind.
'_CaptainRogers_'
Ah shit.
The woman ripped her arm away from Tony and bid her goodbye, leaving Tony speechless in the middle of the footpath. Angrily, he called for his suit as he ran and flew off into the sky. Even though it was his fault, he wanted to blame Steve for the fact that he had just lost the best girl he had ever met.
"I made it myself. Do you like it?" Tony smiled whilst looking down at him.
"Go on a date with me? Let see how this turn out."
"Hey there," Tony said, jokingly making his voice lower than usual, "I'm Captain America."
"If he just need your help, why don't you wait until we finished our date for the night? It's not like it's anything important."
"What does this has to do with your father?"
Steve ran down to Bruce's lab, pushing through the door and scaring the poor scientist in his chair.
Steve turned around as fast as lightning and saw Natasha holding his wedding band in between her fingers.
"No because he told me not to follow him."
"He left."
"Steve...a year ago you asked me to forgive but don't forget. Well. I know it's hard but I'm asking you to forget. I forgave you and you forgave me. I know it's not ideal but if you look at it in this way, if we didn't have the fight, I wouldn't have gone to the hospital, you wouldn't have shown up and we would still be on non-talking terms. It's twisted up but I'm glad it happened because I realised I love you." I said sweetly into his ears. Steve's body trembled underneath me and cried. Not out of sadness but pouring all the guilt out for a new start.
Sometimes, Tony wished Bucky never existed.
"I was going to give this to you after the reception but I want to give it to you now. Tony made and left this for you. I have never watched it because it's not for me. I hope this gives you closure."
"Then we'll do that together too."
"Okay okay,"  Tony said, pecking a kiss on Steve lips. After 20 minutes, they finally agreed on a name.
"O-oh...Uhm...Ahh...No-one! No-one," Tony stuttered. He quietly cursed himself for not being able to hide the flowers well.
Tony blushed and smiled. He shook his head as he focused back on his work, laughing quietly at his darling captain.
Tony glanced up at Steve through his fingers.
"Hi Tony," Steve said, kissing Tony's cheek lightly, "I'm going to sleep in Bucky's room tonight. We have a lot to catch up on."
"Tony, look. I'm not asking you to forget the past because it's hard to. I know. But...please forgive me. I missed you and...and I really want us to start over."
"I didn't know it was him."
"Steve? What the fuck are you doing here?! Go away!"
A few weeks has passed and Steve was happier than ever. Tony, on the other hand, have been busy down at his lab, tinkering away his insecurities and jealousy. There has been a couple times when Steve have tried to talk to Tony and Tony have tried to talk to Steve. However, each time they were both busy in the process of doing something so they didn't have the chance to actually talk. Steve have unintentionally moved into Bucky's room which one night, Tony had found them sleeping on the bed together after another episode of panic attack that awoken him. He felt something inside of him break and vowed that he didn't need Steve.
Steve's posture relaxed a little as he felt like he was being too harsh on Tony but he continued to stay quiet and listen anyway.
"That doesn't sound very convincing."
"I'm sorry, what did you say in the last part?"
"What do you mean?"
"What are you wearing?!" Steve laughed out loud as Tony walked through into their bedroom. He watched as Tony swirled around and posed, placing one of his hands on his hips and dark sunglasses sitting at the tip of his nose.
"I love it," Steve said genuinely, love pooling over his eyes. He grabbed Tony by the waist, gently pulling him closer to peck him on the head. Tony cupped the taller man's face and caressed over his cheeks with his thumbs. Steve leaned down, fully kissing the shorter man with love.
"Hi Nat," Steve said, turning around with the piping bag still in his hands.
Tony nodded in shock. His future seem so full, he wonder if it was true. Suddenly an elevator door dinged and he whipped around quickly.
Steve shook his head at the memory. "No," Steve thought, "Tony saved New York by pushing the missile through the wormhole himself."
Steve ignored Tony's warning and enveloped Tony's body against the kitchen counter. He felt him tense up under his hug and Steve buried his head in the crook of Tony's neck.
"What are you doing down here love?" Steve mumbled in the crook of Tony's neck.
He stood up, not caring about the fault that was made during the mission, but cared about how Tony was doing. He entered the elevator and bit his lip as he kept going down memory lane. Young Tony's face kept flashing in his mind until he got out the elevator and stopped behind a couch and looked down at the shorter man. He saw Tony's body tense in his presence.
He placed on his aviators once he stepped out of the airport. While waiting for a taxi, he saw a small flower stand selling fresh roses. Smiling to himself, he bought a bouquet of roses and hugged it tight to his chest as he climbed into the back of the taxi.
"Yes I am champ," Steve said, looking up into Tony's eyes. His eyes lit into happiness as young Tony fell on top of Steve, arms thrown around his neck.
"Oh. That's great." Tony replied simply.
"Woah, woah, woah Natasha! I'm just trying to help! He's incredibly malnourished. He needs sleep and he needs therapy!" Bruce cried while holding his hands up, surrendering.
Steve, not bothered by Tony's remark, shook his head and gave his puppy eyes. He looked as if he was a child begging his parent to let him sleep over at his friend's house. Tony sighed and closed his eyes.
“It’s Runway!” yells Peter Parker. “Let’s Practice!” Shuri tells Nebula and Peter.
"Uploaded to the cloud.  Sounds like heaven."
"It's- That's- Complicated" Steve stutters.
They arrive at Smashbox Studios, everyone is excited for their first photoshoot. They walk in to see a large green screen behind Phil Coulson, wearing a cape?
Erin: “Sexy, Dynamic and without being raunchy.”
Holding a quarter in her hand, “Oh.  Do you want to…?”  Steve looks at the game.  The racing game depicts a red car thundering along a highway.  The vehicle spins out of control in a shower dust.  Steve stares at that for a moment, it disturbs him.  Then he answers, “Uh no… thank you… sorry it’s not you.  I’m sort of…” he gestures around “Just want to get my Barings.”  Natasha responds, “Uh Okay.  See you around.”  She smiles.  Steve wonders off, Natasha watches him leave, the she drops a quarter in Bubble Bobble.
Rhodey just looks puzzled.
FANTASTIC STORY! Let’s Make A
Then an angry Tony begins to speak, "Forty nine years!  I was with her for
“You’ve been pardoned by the new government.  They see you as a hero for killing Tony.”
Steve throws vibranium blades at Tony.  Tony jumps midair to dodge the blades but one hits him in the leg, he crashes to the ground.  Steve has the advantage, so he runs towards Stark to try and kick him, but Tony summons a piece of the armor to block the kick.  He backflips to get away.  Tony struggles to stand up, he begins to cough harshly, and coughs blood into his hand.  He begins to limp towards Steve, pulling the blade out of his leg in the process.  Steve pulls a gun out, and shots at Stark, but he quickly lifts Sam’s limp corpse as a shield.  This infuriates Steve.  Steve suddenly appears in front of Tony, surprising the shorter man, and begins to squeeze his throat.  Tony begins to struggle underneath Steve, scratching at his hands.  He begins to turn red, staring deeply into Steve’s eyes, all he sees is anger in those ocean blue eyes.  Suddenly Tony stops fighting, stops struggling and eventually stops moving at all.  Steve stays on top, choking Stark out until he sees the life fade from his eyes.  Tony is dead.  It begins to rain, and Steve gets off Tony.  He stares up into the rain, letting the water hit his face.  Suddenly he sees black.
"Then stop this Carol!"
"Okay ," Steve replies.
“The dashingly handsome Creative Director Phil Coulson.”
"C'mon, you know that's just a gesture..." Tony says.
Erin: “The only thing about that, is I pay more attention to the costume than the shirt.”
"If you
Steve replies, “Never.”
“Shh,” Tony’s just reached a conclusion, “why the glasses?”  Self-consciously, Steve touches his glasses.  “I mean I like them, they totally work on you, but do you need them?  I mean do you…”  “Yeah the lenses don’t do anything.” Steve answers right way.  “Knew it!”  Tony slightly yells.  “I wore glasses back in school, but I guess now they’re kind of a comfort thing.”
"No-one nowhere."
The sound of heels is getting louder, and everyone sees Tyra coming down the L-shaped stairs.
Just a heads up, next chapter will be short.
"No don't!"
Tony thumbs in the direction of Carol, “She’s not a bad girl, I feel kind of bad, met her at the Quagmire, so…”  “What’s a Quagmire?” Steve asks, cutting Tony off.  Tony looks at him, he decides Steve is a little innocent.  “If you don’t already know what the Quagmire is, you probably don’t want to know.”  Tony looks at Steve’s empty glass.  “You want another one?”  Tony asks.  Steve replies hesitantly, “Uh, I’m not sure—”
Steve can’t match that.  He glances around, self-conscious, Tony is oblivious.  For a moment, time stands still on Steve, as he watches Tony in the moment, enjoying the attention of the other dancers.  Steve, a little sadly, backs away, then leaves.  Tony doesn’t notice at first.  Then he looks around just in time to see Steve leaving.
“It’s been great to meet you” says Steve.  He holds out his hand.  To shake hands.  Tony looks at his hand, amused.  Then shakes it, “Likewise” Tony replies.  Then Steve turns and starts to walk away, quickly.  Tony watches him leave for a moment, still slightly amused.
Tyra looks around, “Well hello models, welcome to the first panel of the season.” Cameras pan to the various smiling faces of the models. “The first judge is the Legendary Runway Coach, Nick Fury.”
“Something transparent to hide behind?  Okay”, Tony says in a sarcastic tone.  Then “Thor” puts the drinks on the bar.  “Thanks”, Tony then turns to Steve, “Cheers!”  Steve clinks glasses and takes a sip.  The taste of the Jack Daniel’s makes him cough a little.  “That’s—”, Steve says coughing.  “Never tasted it before?”, Tony ass incredulously.  Steve doesn’t answer at first.  Sips more, a bit embarrassed, “No I just- haven’t had it in a while.  It’s good.”  Tony is ‘regarding’ him again.  Tony asks, “Do you live here?”
Phil: “Attractive, stunning, spectacular.”
Producer: “She’ll be here any minute.”
"You sure?"
*confessional*
There's a silence, Tony looks lost in thought.  Peggy looks over at Rhodey with a 'What do I do?' face, Rhodey looks back at her with an 'I don't know'.  Tony is the one to break the silence, "When?" Tony asks.  Peggy waves an arm in the direction of the hospital cafeteria, "uh... let's go grab a coffee."
cute—"
Steve rolled his eyes.
"Are you-" Tony paused, staring at Steve in disbelief. "Are you
-and fell off the bed.
Being stuck in an elevator was one thing.
The smaller man simply hummed in response, too sleepy to say anything else, and so Steve kept quiet and waited until they reached their bedroom. It was still the same as it was this morning, the bed unmade and clothes scattered about on the floor, but Steve didn’t care. He’d sort it all out tomorrow.
That nickname stood out the most from what Bucky had just said. Tony tried not to let it bother him. Instead, he said, "Huh, right,"
love you—"
"Oh, my God," Tony's eyelids fluttered shut, and his lips parted as he somehow twisted around in Steve's grasp, leaning into the blond's touch. "You are such a-" He was silenced by Steve's lips on his, and he made a noise in the back of his throat, a pleasured groan, as he accepted the kiss, pushing forward, demanding for more, and Steve-
And then he kissed him, and the world fell away.
And there was another thing, as well. See, Steve and Tony always had this routine every morning (if Tony had actually left the workshop): Steve would wake up at the crack of dawn, like the perfect soldier he was, and go for a jog, or kill punchbags in the gym. Then he'd make breakfast (he was one of the only Avengers who could actually cook). And then, he'd
*Wanda voice over as she hugs everyone goodbye: “I am shocked that I am going home, because I feel like I did bring a lot of energy to my pictures.” Photo tribute of Wanda’s photo appears. “I know I’m not just a pretty face, cuz I was never the pretty girl in school. I know my stuff and it’s just I didn’t get a chance to prove it, and I didn’t get a chance to werk it. I’m going to make it on my own.” Wanda is shown waving goodbye as she leaves the judging room.
Phil: “You have a strong face, and your eyes give off such intensity that I just can’t look away.”
HERE LIES
“At your age?” Tony says in a snooty way.
“If you let me finish, then you will get your answer.”  Carol sits back down.  “Tony still loved you.  He still loved you even when you cheated on him with Bucky.  The Accords were the nail in the coffin, and he noticed how you stopped loving him.  Regardless, he still loved you, even if you didn’t.”
Steve’s eyes were wide open, taking in all the new formation.  He closes his fist with the dog tags inside.
. “Loki.” “Jane.” “Margret.” “Stephen… Strange.” Steve Rogers looks upset that he wasn’t the Steven they were looking for. “19 models, but only 5 spots left.”
“Peggy!  She’s called Peggy”, Steve interrupts.
“Carol Danvers, I used to work with Tony.”  She walks forward and leans against the wall.  “I brought you here because I need to talk to you about Tony.”
*screen fades to black*
Tony Slaps him.  Steve holds his cheek, shocked.  There's a silence.
A voice suddenly appears, “You clearly never knew Sir.  Captain Rogers, how do you think you won the fight against Sir.  He was a futurist, he always had extra suits for reinforcements, do you really think one destroyed suit is the reason for his demise.”
Tony, 19: "This is it; this is the end of this journey and Tyra is coming to say bye.”
Nick: “Strong face and confidence.”
Okoye, Shuri, Wanda and Hope claim the Tokyo Room. And both Peters, Nebula and Carol claim the Milan room. Everybody is ecstatic, but Tony is walking in and out of rooms seeing everyone has a bed.
“THOR THE GOD OF THUNDER IS APPROACHING!” Yells Thor. Item to sell: Pants. Phil: “although Thor gave good face, he was joking around a little too much. Other than that, he gave a great photo.”
"Good luck with that."
"V-card?" Tony laughs, "What is this?  Eighth Grade?"
Steve flashes back to the fight.  He remembers Tony still wearing his wedding ring.
Everyone walks into the hallway, grabbing their backpacks and purses and head into the elevator. They ride the elevator for a few minutes, and they’re navigated by production into a room. The room is covered in tape, boards and curtains. Their suitcases are plopped just right under the stairs.
Thank you  to everyone who is reading the fic, I appreciate every single one of you.
CLICK, they're gone.  Steve pushes the button again.  In a bored sounding voice from the intercom, "You want in?"
"Reminds me of where I grew up-" Tony adds.
The game begins, Steve seems to know what he’s doing.
Erin: “I would book her to sell my jewelry.”
Steve, 26: “I served in the army, so these critiques aren’t affecting me.”
Phil: “Which just goes to show how amazing you were this week.” “Thank you, Steve.”
Tony is racing, at speed, down the freeway.  A coastal road.  Steve winces slightly as they skid around a bend.  Tony in a voice raised over the engine, "RELAX, WHAT'S THE WORST THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?"  Steve looks out the window.  Then back at Tony, "How long have you been here?" Steve asks.  "Sorry?"
' inscribed at the bottom. Tears gathered in Tony's eyes: the picture was stunningly perfect — Steve had captured every detail perfectly, from the freckles on his cheeks to the light curls of hair at the nape of his neck — and the amount of love that had gone into making the art was clearly evident, so much so that Tony's heart swelled with affection.
"That obvious, huh?" He replied, ducking his head sheepishly. Happy chuckled.
"Tony," Steve interrupted, raising an eyebrow with a small smile. "You think I'm...adorable?"
"Okay, then, Mother Hen-"
"Yeah, you are," He agreed, shifting into a crouch before standing up, extending a hand out for Tony, who took it gratefully, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet. Steve allowed him a few seconds to regain his balance, and then enveloped him in a tight hug. "But if I wasn't there-"
"You love me really, Anthony Edward Stark,"
— popped into his mind for the last time as his head sagged sideways towards his slumped shoulders) and then, finally, with his arms hanging loose by his sides, the light faded from them until they were gazing blankly into nothingness, wide and open, yet dull and lifeless. Unseeing.
"Right," Tony nodded, drumming his fingers on the table. "Right. Well. I suppose you'll have to, won't you?"
"Oh, Lord," Tony groaned. "What do I feed him?"
"And stop apologizing," Tony continued, his back still turned. "Honestly, you're worse than Steve,"
"—that it wasn't your fault, that you—that you couldn't have done anything to—to—"
"But I could've—"
common courtesy."
"Shut up, Watson-"
to make it out of the battle field;
"I don't want to lose you," Tony whispered, squeezing his eyes shut and inhaling Steve's comforting scent.
, he thought as he went to wipe it away and accidentally knocked his injured nose.
"Oh, thank
"Well, yeah," Tony replied immediately. His voice was partially muffled from being bent over as he finished tying the laces on his white skates, but Steve could hear him perfectly with his enhanced hearing abilities. Still, that didn't stop him from doing a double take at Tony's next words, wondering if he'd misheard him: "I rented the place out for a couple of hours."
"You'll wake up
"Mm," Tony hummed, sighing happily as he nestled into the warmth of Steve's embrace. "Yeah. Yeah, I do,"
Steve knew how to make it all a better experience for Tony, anyway, with just three things:
to talk?" He asked suggestively, a hint of a blush appearing on his cheeks.
"Okay," He said, poking fun, "Just for that-" He pointed to the airbed. "-I'm sleeping on the floor,"
"Can we go ice skating?"
"I'm not your dad, kiddo," Tony muttered in reply. Steve took no notice, and continued whining, hitting the billionaire's arm lightly with his tiny fists. Tony looked at Bruce. "I'm serious. What do we have that we can give him? Can he even have solids?"
How long had he been out?! The sun was still burning away in the sky, but Steve couldn't tell if it had moved or not since the last time he looked. His eyes scanned the ground, searching desperately for the phone, and when he spotted it, he actually cried out in relief.
It turned out that Steve wasn't joking about the book. Tony had had to wait what felt like hours for him to complete the chapter, and then another few minutes prying it away from his hands before the blond could sneakily start reading Chapter 6.
) had been in the room, and so he headed in their direction. Soon, he could hear Steve's voice, and he knew he was close.
"No," He lied, turning his head away. He could hear footsteps, and then suddenly Tony's warm hand was on his arm, near his shoulder, gently turning him around.
"Y-you mean, t-today is-" Steve stammered, and then he went pale. "Oh, shit. Oh,
Steve shook his head, stubbornly pressing his lips together. As Tony brought the spoon closer, Steve unexpectedly began kicking his legs, which shook the high chair slightly (yes, they had a high chair. Tony didn't know why, or how, but used it anyway. After all, what else was he supposed to do with it?). And then, just as the spoon neared his lips, he started to yell.
"Santa Rosa, California" Steve utters out.
Moments later she’s standing beside him, watching him progress over his shoulder.  It takes her a to pluck up the courage to speak, “you’re good at this.”
They walk through the door of a larger bar/ music venue called Shield.  Steve looks up at the sign for the bar.  Then at the door.  Gingerly, he pushes it open.
A few months later
“I never said I accepted it.” Steve barks back.
Tony puts a finger to Steve's lips, "I'm gonna say something crazy."
"Tony, I'm Sorry!"
"In San Junipero?"
Nick: “The person who impressed me the most is…” he pauses, “…Tony.” He jumps up and down in excitement.
Nebula, 20: “They bring us to this basement looking room, and it’s just like ‘this is it’.”
Steve looks at all this, daunted.  What the fuck?
Steve stands in front of a vandalized tombstone.  “Hey Tony.  I’m back.  I’m sorry that things turned out they way they did.”  Steve places flowers down on the grave.  “I never stopped loving you Tony.  I so sorry that you died by my hands believing that I stopped loving you.”  He places a kiss on the tombstone and starts walking away, “I hope we meet in the next life.”
“Yeah you do, come on.”  Tony stands up, beckons Steve to follow.  “Do I have to tug your leash?”  Steve just smiles at the question, and Tony leads the way.
"You like it?"
They arrive at Tony's house.  Tony's Jeep is parked outside his home.  Tony and Steve are entering the front door.  They walk inside, Steve looks around.  It's a nice place, Steve looks around a moment, "Wow!"
Phil: “I disagree, I think it’s fresh and what clients look for.”
Okoye- Hero name: Okoye. Item to sell: Skirt.
Rhodey's even more confused. "For what?" he asks.
, he's full-fat San Juniperan-" Peggy adds.  "I know, but- can you?" Tony pleads.  Peggy stops eating, "We're meant to stick to the five hour cut off.  Once a week..."
Tyra: “next up is Okoye.” Okoye’s picture pops up on the screen.
, which looks like an early PlayStation attempt to recreate the movie
"How long have you been here?" Steve repeats in a raised voice.
Tyra: “Hello Wanda, Let’s see your best shot as Scarlet Witch.” Picture shows up. Silence.
It's dark in here.  The two men lay down on the bed, Tony leading Steve.  Tony's hand moves to unbutton Steve's jeans.  Steve is breathless, "You'll have show me." "Good", Tony replies.  Tony takes Steve's shirt off, revealing his muscular body, "Wow!"  They kiss passionately.
It's daytime outside a care home for seniors, a frail man in his mid 70's is helped into a futuristic-looking vehicle by a young nurse, with a name-tag that reads Rhodey.  "Okay Tony..." Rhodey says, "Take my hand... there you go."  Once they are both in the car, it automatically drives, a driverless vehicle.  As the nurse, Rhodey, sits reading some kind of translucent tablet.  Elderly Tony (because yes, that's who it is) looks out of the window, watching the scenery, a faint smile on his lips.
Virginia 'Pepper' Stark  age 71
"Night before his wedding, that's a special occasion," Tony persuades, and Peggy thinks.
“You’re Lying!” Steve exclaims.  Tony surely had gotten over him, he knows he did, or at least he thinks so.
There's a billboard for
"But a spouse can override that.  Hence the wedding bells."  Peggy nods in agreement, "you got it.  Got a Pastor coming tomorrow in the morning, he's scheduled to pass tomorrow afternoon."
In the bedroom, The clock radio clicks from 11:59 to 12:00.
Tyra: “Amazing, I can see Anna Wintour putting this in Vogue.”
Hope, 24: “Oh my lord, they tricked us. I’m happy it was a good trick.”
Journey to The Cave of Monsters!
"We made a connection!"
Its a deserted beach, daylight hours.  A small cove, white sand.  Steve alone, walks along the shore, closing his eyes and feeling the warmth of the sun.  he picks up a stone and tosses it into the water.  He feels the breeze and smiles.  He sits on the beach, clenching and unclenching his toes in the sand.  He removes his glasses, looks at them for a moment and drops them on the sand.  Looks up and watches the sea and the skies.
"Didn't think to.  You know when she was dying, Pepper said to me- when they offered her this, to pass over, pass through serve eternity in this fucking graveyard you're so in love with- she said 'How can I?  When Peter didn't get the chance, How can I?'" Tears are in Tony's eyes, "And so she went, and I wish I could believe she's with him now, they're together, but I don't.  I believe they're nowhere.  Like you said, gone, just gone."  Steve goes to embrace him, but Tony physically pushes him away.  "No.  I pitied you and that's the truth, I pitied you.  And now you give sales pitch about how fucking peachy 'forever' can be..."
choice.  She
“I am at your service Captain” JARVIS says.
Tyra: “Hi guys. I’m so sorry. But this isn’t the end, the road to success is not a straight line, it’s a zig-zag line.” Tyra reaches into her pocket. “Sadly, you have to go home now.” She pulls out a remote control. “But you don’t have to go far.” She clicks a button, and all the curtains and boards around them fall to the ground, revealing the interior of a penthouse. A modern living room with all black furniture, large dining table and beautiful plants, and the coolest kitchen you’ve ever seen. All of the ‘Rejects’ starts to scream and cry as the curtains fall. They immediately run to the living room, jumping up and down. Shuri falls to the ground crying, Tyra walks over to pick her up.
Tyra: “Definitely am getting high fashion, but I want to say that in your film you had photos in which you older than you are, and that’s not a good thing. Next up is Shuri.”
Steve walks over to the arcade.  He catches a glimpse of a part of the intro to the Namco arcade game
"For the rest of it!" and Tony smiles, turning back to the sunset.
Carol, 25: “Our bags are just thrown on the ground, we’re nothing to anyone now.”
The clock radio hits 12:00am.
Steve starts to smile.  Hesitancy giving way to enjoyment.  Tony shows him another move—he copies it, and another.  It’s almost like Simon says.  Then Tony ups his game, performs a more flamboyant, somewhat proactive, writhing move.  Other people on the dance floor start to notice.  They’re enjoying the scene, not in a malicious or mocking way, but laughing appreciatively.
Tyra: “One of the best this week, and there were many photos to pick from in your film.”
"I have to."
*Confessional*
“Tony, c’mon…”
Tony looks at Steve for a moment.  Steve is kicking his legs against the wall, absentmindedly.  Tony looks at his legs, “What would like to do?  That you’ve never done?”  He sidles in, a little closer.  Steve smiles, a little excited, a little shy.  “Uh…”, Steve looks up at the Sky, “Oh so many things.”
Tyra: “The winner will have a contract with FENTY Beauty, a contract will LA Models, and a Cover and a 6-page spread in Vogue Italia. Let the competition begin!”
“My ass you can’t” Tony says “C’mon”.
“Yes, I know, yes”.
“While fighting you, Sir had to take drastic measures.  From what he observed, you were willing to keep him alive.  So, he did what he never wanted to do.”
Tyra: “You were all probably wondering why the fiercest 14 were going home, because you weren’t going home.” Everybody cheers in agreement. “I got to go now before you beat me up.” Tyra laughs hysterically out of the penthouse. The models are all so happy.
Natasha, 22: *teary eyes* “I am strong. And I will just try again next year.”
“Next up is Steve.”
Steve sighs, “They don’t worry.  Just the concept of me enjoying myself…  That would blow their minds.”
San Junipero, sunset.  Steve stands by the side of the road, waiting, staring at the waves crash onto the beach.  He has no thoughts, his eyes reflect the sunlight in the distance.  Suddenly, Tony pulls up in his 1987 Jeep, 'I Need Love' by LL Cool J is blasting on the stereo.  The red jeep has a giant white bow on the front, and Tony is wearing a puffy 80's white tuxedo.  Steve laughs, and with instinct, has his hand on his peck, and is almost out of breath from the laughter.
Steve looks Stunned.
Nebula poses her gun at the ceiling. Hero Name: Nebula. Item to sell; Black boots. Phil: “Nebula needs more confidence because her nerves were showing in her face.”
Nick Fury: “Models, I know you’re enjoying yourselves, but we have some news.”
"I guess." Peggy replies.
“Since last week.  You’ve been asleep for 10 days.”
Next he's in the bathroom, looking closely into a cabinet mirror at his face.  His hair is now slicked back, he's now giving a cold look on his face, looking like the male models of the day.  He looks up and don on the tight black clothing.  He looks at his face, it's not him.  "No", Steve sighs out.  Finally he tries something else.  A bit more confident, a bit more glam than before, but still him.  He puts on his glasses.
Tyra: “Next person is… Virginia.” She breathes a sigh of relief and heads over to the stage. “Could, Bruunhilde come on over.” Fist bumping the air, she gladly walks over. “Next model is Maria!” Tyra says with enthusiasm. And Maria lets go of the people holding her and runway walks over to the “
Then a hand reaches down to help him up.  He turns around.  It's Steve!  Tony looks at the outstretched hand, then looks up at Steve.  He begins to reach up.  The clock on the dash clicks to midnight.  Steve now stands alone in the middle of the road.
“Thor”
Nick: “Good shot, I look at the glove, and your face is strong.”
Tony looks down, there lying in bed, is an exceptionally frail man in his early 70's.  Grey hair, and bot much of it.  He's in a neck brace, he can't move.  His eyes are open, his mouth is frozen in a blank expression- neither a smile nor a grimace.  He's looking at Tony from his fixed position.  Tony, for a moment he doesn't know quite what to do.  he walks closer, takes a seat beside the bed.  He looks at Steve, takes his hand, "Hi Stupid."  he squeezes Steve's hand.  "It's good to see you" he rub's Steve's hair and kisses him on the forehead.
Tyra: “What was your hero’s name, and where you trying to sell?” “Star Lord, and a leather jacket” Quill replies.
Peter Parker- Hero name: Spider-Man.   Item to sell: Dress Shirt. Phil: “Love the concept Peter.” Phil to camera: “Peter’s idea of having him changing into his hero costume made it easier to sell his article of clothing.”
Meanwhile, elsewhere, Tony is leaving a house-- a kind of clapboard beach house-- and walking towards his car, a red jeep.
"Sure."
"Can we just enjoy tonight?" Tony is Trying to change the subject.  Steve checks his watch, "It's ten to midnight, you're out of here in ten and we gotta wait a week to meet again."  Tony tries to reassure himself, "You know I'm just a visitor..."  "For how long? Couple months?  Then what?" Steve asks more aggressively.  "We're not discussing this..." Tony is trying his best to end this conversation. But Steve isn't allowing it, "Then you'll be gone, just gone!  You could have forever!"  Steve is now sounding like a San Junipero sales ad and Tony isn't buying it "Forever?  Who could even make sense of forever..."  "How ever long you want then, you can remove yourself like that..." he snaps his fingers, "it's not a trap, it's... look at it!"  Steve gestures around.  He then taps the hood of the car again insistently.  Still tapping the hood, "Touch it," Steve says confidently.
Tony visits Steve.  Everything is not as it seems.  Tony asks Steve a serious question about their relationship.
“Tony”
Steve begins to think about the entire fight.  After Natasha and Bucky destroyed the suit, Tony began to fight them one on one, his weakest form of fighting.  Why would Tony let himself be taken to those measures?  He’s seen Tony defeat an entire Chitauri army, and he was brought down by 2 spies and 2 super soldiers?
I never thought people would actually read this, lol.  Still getting the hang of this website.  enjoy chapter 2
"I'm not gonna jump-"
Phil: “Let’s head to hair and makeup.”
Tyra: “Yeah You! So, you think this just a typical episode of Top Model, Uh-uh. The last two seasons we had a whole week of auditions to pick out the finalist, this season we already picked the top 14.”
Tony gets off the car, starts heading for the driver's door, "I'm going."  Steve grabs Tony's arms, turns him around.  Steve takes Tony's hands and puts them on his own face, "It's real.  This is real, and this."  He holds, gestures to the wedding ring to his finger, smiling, "Uh-huh?"
Steve just starred at Carol, “I don’t want to hear any of it.  Just get me out of here, I am technically still a banned from being here.”
Natasha, 22: “I’ve wanted this since I was 6, so of course I know what I’m doing.”
by The Fugees.  In almost a shot for shot repeat of when Steve first saw Tony in the club, everyone's dressed and styled a la 1996.  Again he looks, again no sign.  Steve sighs.  No dice.
Tony goes down on one knee.  Right there,"Wanna marry me instead?"
Steve glances at the dance floor.  People uninhabited, laughing, enjoying themselves.  Then he looks at Tony, “Dance Floors are not ‘me’”.  “Ah let’s not limit ourselves”, Tony says, he grabs Steve’s hand and starts to lead him toward the dance floor.  Steve pulls back hesitant, “I can’t”
“Tony__”
.  A Chrysler PT cruiser thrums past.  Steve, styled for the era, passes a shop window with a widescreen TV showing footage from 2002.  Into Shield he goes.  The system is blaring
"Just hear me out."
Tokyo Room: Okoye returns from the kitchen and sees a towel on the floor. She picks it up and realizes it is still wet. “Who the hell left this used towel on the floor?” Okoye yells. Wanda and Hope come in the room. “Hey what are you doing with my towel?” asks Wanda. “Putting it in the dirty laundry, because your ass just leaves shit on the ground.” *Wanda, 18: “Wtf this bitch is trying to call me dirty for leaving my towel by my bed.”
“Let’s see ‘Iron Man’s’ best shot.” Tony’s photo pops up.
"Please..." Tony begs
"One, I did not.  Two, I owe you zero, and Three, see point two." He storms into the men's restroom.  Steve is right on Tony's heels.  "It's not about who owes who, it's about manners."  "Hah!" Tony chuckles.  "You don't know who I am.  You don't know what this means."
"I said 'Well okay then'"
Tony starts to head to the bar, Carol follows,"Look okay, I know--"
Phil: “A lot of you might need some more practice, but I will not be picking the winner.” Everyone looks confused, “because…” Nick walks out from behind the models.
Tony a little offended, "So come on.  I 'showed you mine'.  Where are you?"  No Answer.  "I can just look it up..." Tony teases.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Limo is seen on the I-5
“Not only were you Pardoned Captain, but so were the rest of the rouge avengers.”
Tony and Steve are on the dance floor, in 80's attire, but Steve is no longer wearing glasses, and they both have gold bands on their ring fingers.  They laugh and embrace each other on the dance floor.
.  It's claustrophobic.  Stuffed corridors.  He finds himself squeezing past more people.  The further he ventures in, the more warren-like it gets.  At one point he passes a room in which some kind of orgy seems to be taking place.  Then another area- from the doorway, glimpsed over shoulders and between arms.  He can see there's some sort of bare-knuckle fight going on.  No blood.
Tyra: “Best photo goes to…” Tyra pulls out a photo “…Steve.” Steve has a look of shock on his face, steps down and walks towards Tyra. “Congratulations Steve, you’re still in the running towards becoming America’s Next Top Model.” “Thank you, Tyra.” Steve adds.
"All things considered, I guess I'm ready."
"You want to spend forever somewhere nothing matters?  End up like Carol; all those... lost fucks at the Quagmire, trying anything just to feel something?  Go ahead but I'm out.  I'm gone."  Tony takes a long breath.
Tony thinks, "You think you could hook us up to the system, now, just for a little while, before he passes?"  Peggy pauses, "You can still see him afterwards.  I mean then he's
"I was looking for you.  Where did you go?"
Tyra: “You also lost your neck, if you would’ve raised your chin a bit, I think it would have made this picture a lot better.”
Okoye, 23: “OMG, I don’t think I’ll be able to handle this.”
The sun sets on the skyline of LA.
Shortly afterwards, a young gal named Natasha spots Steve on the Bubble Bobble machine.  She’s faintly preppy, a bit like a young Molly Ringwald.  She’s holding a drink with a straw which she seems ill-at-ease with, she’s nodding her head in time to the music, badly.
Steve stands up with sheer force.  ‘Please don’t make me do this’ he thinks to himself.  ‘You have to do it’ another voice in his head whispers.  “Fine!” Steve exclaims, he drops his shield, “Let’s do this one on one.”  He tightens his leather gloves on his hands.  “Face me like a man Tony.”  Tony turns around, the life in eyes has faded, he doesn’t recognize the man who stands before him.  This isn’t the Tony he used to love.  The old Tony may have signed the accords, but Tony would never overthrow the US government, he would never become a ruthless dictator, and he would never kill his friend.  What happened to him?  Now’s not the time to ask, it’s only time to stop him, even if it means killing him.
Steve looks a little troubled, Tony can't see this, but after a few beats he notices Steve is facing the other way.  "Hey!" nothing "you okay?" Tony is waiting for Steve to answer.  "Yeah", Steve turns around, Tony is looking straight at him, not watching the road.  Suddenly Steve sees headlights coming straight for them.  Their car has drifted into the oncoming lane.  "SHIT!" Steve yells.  Tony quickly tugs the wheel, sending the car off the road, on a long dusty bank.  Steve looks
Golden hour.  Amber light cast on mountains in the background as the sun bows behind the ocean.  In a low-rise apartment block, a light is on.  The room is small and sparsely decorated.
But it's to late.  Tony roars away.
"I know, I'm sorry whatever, it's... in the time I've been here" Tony sighs, "I'm just visiting, you know?  And it's... I didn't want to... I said I wouldn't... I don't know... 'do' feelings"  Tony pauses slightly, "you freaked me out."  He takes Steve's hand, "I don't want to '
Anthony Edward Stark  age 76
*Tony, 19: “Damn, this is not a good sign at all. I’m going to be the lone wolf in this competition.”
"I don't want some boring romance like, Jesus, put us in the retirement home, deal--"
Tony starts talking, "I'm saying there's plenty of other guys for you Carol.  Ones you should actually settle down with."  "The locals?"  Carol says disgusted, "they're like dead people--"  Just then a nearby party- going group walk past- a man, whoops.
Elder Tony sits opposite Peggy at a small table.  They both have trays in front of them.  Lines behind them forming to get food and drinks.  "So he didn't tell you?" she asks.  "No", he sets his coffee down, "No he did not... He said he was just visiting."  "More like visiting the trial version" Peggy adds.  Tony stares down into his coffee, Peggy fills the silence, "I mean I known him the past three years.  We talk on the com-box.  He told how he ended up quadriplegic?  And how long he's been that way?"  Tony's face says no, he didn't.
“These… These are…” Steve gulps, “My dog tags.”
“I’m ‘regarding’ you”
Nick: “Okay photo, seems confident and he seems a bit full of himself.”
First up, Quill. Item to sell; Brown leather jacket. Phil: “What’s your superhero name?”
Phil: “I would say that your poses are a bit boring because during the shoot your barely even moved.”
Bruce, 22: “I was so angry and now I’m just so happy.” *he starts crying*
"Yeah"
Suddenly everyone realizes there’s an upstairs. The BEDROOMS. BEDS. All the models run upstairs. The Penthouse is a 3-bed 2-bath apartment with 2 office spaces. The largest room is the New York Room (originally the master bedroom), with 4 twin beds and 1 queen, a walk-in closet and a beautiful bathroom with 2 sinks, a toilet, and a tub/shower. Downside to this room is all doors have been replaced by curtains. The second largest room is the Tokyo Room, 4 twin-size beds, amazing views, but only 2 dressers. The smallest room, Milan Room has 2 bunkbeds, enough for 4 models with a beautiful closet, downside is the tight squeeze. Just outside of the rooms is the second bathroom, and a lounge area overlooking the kitchen, dining room, runway, and living room. Steve, Clint, Thor, Natasha, and Bruce run into the New York Room, jumping on the beds, and Steve lays right on top of the Queen.
“What are you doing?” asks Steve.
machine, one of those huge two-player 'dancing games' where you step on pads on the floor to progress, when he suddenly stops.  Tony's dancing on it, with Natasha, whose alternative look suddenly seems quite chic.
Tony is almost amused by Steve’s embarrassed flustering.  “She’s a good girl.  She’s a nice girl”, Steve continues.  “Good girl, nice girl”, Tony says questioning Steve.
"It's not just sex--" Carol says intensely.
“Star Lord!” Quill Replies. Snap, Pose, Snap. Phil: “Quill did well portraying his hero, but he needs to remember to put the fashion element to the character.”
"Uh, yeah-- I--"  There's a buzz.  The gate is unlocked, he opens it and steps through.  In front of him, down the end of the track, in the distance, he sees The Quagmire.  This must be the place, for one thing, it has a big neon sign that says
"I'm okay, thanks" Steve says embarrassed.  He walks away.  Now the music is
It is night time on San Junipero's main street.  The billboard?  Independence Day.  A '96 Ford Contour slides by.  Steve-again, the same age but now styled in a grunge flannel like attire, but still keeping the glasses.  He walks past the store, which now has a Sony Trinitron in the window, relaying a story about the Atlanta Olympics.  He looks up at the Shield sign, which has changed.  It looks more... 90's.
Moments later, Steve is standing outside Tony's house.  The lights are off.  He looks through the window- nothing.  Checks the door.  Steve stands back a distance and calls up at the upper windows.  "Tony!" then louder, "TONY!" but nothing.
“With each other?”, Steve hesitantly asks.  “Uh huh”, Tony looks at Steve in a ‘of course silly’ type of way.
“I’m using it!”
The night turns into day over the city of LA
Wanda steps down from the platform and walks over in front of the judges, “Hello judges.”
“In this?” Tony says indicating the rain.
“When I arrived back on Earth, you were considered a deserter.  The American public was divided.  You were hated by the government and the public, the Alt-right used your image to fight for smaller government.  You were either hated or praised by hate groups.  Tony hated seeing your image like that.  He hurt seeing the world hate you after you have fought to protect them.  So, he came up with a plan.  A plan to make the United State need you once more, even if it meant that he would be hated.  He became aggressive as a leader.  Eventually Rhodey and Pepper left because of it.  Peter stayed loyal to Tony.  Tony cared for Peter and he didn’t want the kid to fall with him, so he made Peter hate him as well.  After the team disbanded, he then began terrorizing the country.  When he finally took over the country, resistance movements appeared.  The public began using your image as a sign for change, for peace, and as hatred towards Tony.”  Carol got closer to Steve.   “He set up a plan to get you and the rogue avengers to come back to defeat him.  And when I say defeat, I mean he wanted you to kill him.”
Tyra: “Very good job Okoye. Next up is Hope.” Hope gracefully walks to the judges.
In the men's room moments later.
“Hope”
“And is Peggy here?” Tony gestures.  “No, she’s…” Steve indicates ‘somewhere else’.  “Elsewhere?” Tony questions.  “Yeah” Steve answers.  “Uh-huh” Tony pauses, “you want to go to bed with me?  We could be back at mine like…” he clicks his fingers.  “I never did anything like that” Steve says super nervously, with a slight blush in his cheeks.
“No.  I mean…” Steve puts his hands over his eyes, “Dammit”.  His eyes open again, trying to get words out, “Look I—ah—you seem…”
Models are walking up and a runway in the middle of orange cones while wearing Flight Attendant attire. Nick and Phil are seen critiquing and praising some walks.
"Hi- I'm looking for someone-"
Tyra: “Nick, Phil, the envelopes please.” They hand them over to Tyra. “These envelopes have the pictures of the final 12.”
"I don't care--"
Wanda sits beside him, "Get you a drink?"
Downstairs Peter and Shuri sit on the couch with large blankets and large bowls of Captain Crunch. They just discuss about life outside of the show, suddenly the screen turns on revealing Tyra Mail. “Tyra Mail!” Peter and Shuri yell. The models rush to the TV screen.
Steve walks onto set. Lots of whistling and catcalling commence, Steve just smirks. Hero name: Captain America. Item to sell: Jewelry (shield covered in diamonds.) Steve begins to pose. Phil: “Steve was amazing, every pose he did was super editorial and definitely sold more than his shield.” *Steve, 26: “I rocked that photoshoot, so I hope I get best photo.”
them let me..."
"Try me" Tony interrupts.
.   Steve walks past.  Deeper into the Bar, the music system is playing
Picture appears of Peter ripping the shirt open to reveal a hero costume underneath. Phil: “I love your idea if having you reveal the costume.”
*Group photo of the Models. Wanda fades out of the group photo.
“She is a good girl.”
“Yes.” Carol replied, “He wanted to make sure you would kill him.  He fought at 20% so you wouldn’t catch on.  He disabled all other suits so if his armor was damaged, he wouldn’t have any other way to defeat you.”
Meanwhile Peter and Shuri are by the TV waiting for more Tyra mail. Once they hear the yelling from upstairs, the skull mail appears. Peter and Shuri yell for their fellow houseguest to come. Once everyone is there, the message appears.
“Let’s See your best shot.” A photo appears and the judges start clapping.
BOOM! *Dramatic Music Plays*
"Can you make this easy for me?" Steve finishes.
The New York Room: Natasha: “I think the six of us in this room are definitely the final 6.” “I couldn’t agree more.” Comments Clint. Steve and Thor nod in agreement.
"You would not have got me at all.  At All." Steve let's out a sigh, "If you really met me, I mean if you REALLY met me, you wouldn't like me..."
"Shit!"
He couldn't bare to think about it.
That was enough for Tony to jump out of his chair, and hurry towards the elevator. He'd soon realised after the amounts of occurrences that an increased heart rate meant a nightmare of some sort.
. Tony hadn't meant to let that slip. He kept his mouth shut and stared at the floor, at his shoes, at Steve's shoes - anywhere but his boyfriend.
Steve felt kinda bad, knowing he should've just ignored the text; Tony was ill — he wasn't being sharp on purpose.
"Tony!" Steve cried out, shaking the man beneath him in a terrified manner, as his eyes roamed everywhere but Tony's face; he was too much of a coward to meet his gaze.
Steve looked surprised, but a small smile was on his face. "Bucky, c'mon. I couldn't just-"
And so now Steve was always driven around by Happy. It wasn’t as bad as he’d initially thought (not that he'd ever thought being in the company of Happy would be bad — he just disliked the idea of not being able to drive by himself). Happy was forever in a good mood and would always offer a welcoming smile towards Steve whenever the two greeted each other; he reminded Steve regularly that if he ever wanted to raise the partition that separated the front seats from the back, he could freely do so, not minding if Steve wanted a bit of peace and quiet; he even let Steve choose which radio station to listen to. At first, Steve had no idea about which to pick, and so Happy gradually introduced him to them all, which in turn helped Steve learn more songs that he’d missed the release of during his time in the ice. Now, Happy let Steve listen to whatever he wanted, not caring whether or not he himself liked the music.
Tony breathed out a long sigh, shoving his phone back into his pocket and folding his arms. "Fucking SHIELD with their fucking tech," he muttered. "My elevators don't stall like this,"
"Excuse me," Tony scoffed, narrowing his eyes and poking Steve in the nose again. "I'm middle aged, thank you very much!" Steve giggled.
"How long?" Steve said immediately.
"Oh," Steve said, quietly. "I thought you were the one doing all the work,"
"Tony, you
"Still, there must be
Steve turned his head, meeting Tony's eyes for the first time. "What?"
"Not now, Jarv," Tony swatted his hand at no one in particular - despite the fact that the Artificial Intelligence was...well...an Artificial Intelligence, Tony still treated him like a fellow citizen.
"Actually..." Bucky smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. "I lied. To Steve, I mean," He shrugged. "I told him I was going to explore the tower. I never said I was going to see you, and Stevie never told me to,"
"So," Steve began, once his mom had finished patching up Tony's face: it wasn't broken after all, but a rather large, angry bruise was beginning to blossom around it and his eye, which would, no doubt, still be painful. "You wanna tell me who did this?"
Tony took Rumlow's proximity to his advantage and sharply brought his head forward. There was a loud, satisfying thwack as it made contact with the bully's forehead, and Rumlow yelled out in surprised pain, stumbling backwards and loosening his grip on Tony, who, despite being slightly disoriented (
From the lower floors of the tower, a particular brunette shivered as the loud weather boomed. He'd always disliked storms - he was more of a sun-sand-and-sea type of guy - and he hated Monday's too. The slowly improving mechanical arm that he was working on was giving him 'nightmares' too, not working the way the genius wanted it to. Overall, Tony Stark was not having a great day. Or night, as it was now.
"It's okay, Steve. I promise," Tony replied, with as much sincerity in his voice as he could muster. "It was just an accident. And I’m not hurt."
"Oh, uh, yeah," Tony replied. "Please,"
"Uh, yeah, of course!" God, that came out
"Tony?"
Sherlock in the first place!"
It was impossible to refuse him.
"No!" Steve was literally screaming now. "No trains! I don't wike trains!!"
!!!). He just didn't know how, or if he should say it.
"I-I'm sorry," Steve whispered, closing his eyes and shaking his head. "I'm so
"Steve, this is...I-"
"For the love of-
"I just need you to breathe. Can you do that for me?"
Steve shut his eyes again with a smile. "I love you too. So much." He sighed, relaxed and content. Having Tony curled up next to him was comforting in a way words couldn't describe, and Steve couldn't express enough how much he adored him, or how fortunate he was to have him as both his best friend and husband.
Looking around, the kitchen was empty. Everything was in it's place: the cupboards shut securely, with no six foot soldier in sight. But then Tony spotted the small packet of marshmallows lying open on the counter top, evidence that someone (aka
"Okay," Tony agreed. "Love you," He added, smiling goofily. Steve chuckled at his expression, though he too wore a similar one on his face.
"Great!" He said cheerfully, releasing Steve's hand. Steve already missed his touch, even though it had been merely seconds since they'd parted. But then Tony was talking again: "Okay, first of all, let's actually get you on the ice..."
, alright?!" Tony snapped. "That's why I've been putting off telling you. If you found out, it could've ruined the team's...dynamics, or whatever, and then the school would end up losing all the time, and you're the captain, so you'd probably get the blame, and I just-" He sighed. "I kept it quiet because I didn't want to upset you, to disappoint you-"
"Now, come here and give me a kiss,
"I assume that's Tony texting you." Happy suddenly said, smiling knowingly. As far as Steve was aware, he'd not taken his eyes off the road once, and so he felt himself startle a little and blush at the observation.
"Aww, that was nice. I didn't realise you were so fond of kids,"
"What?" Steve asked quietly, frowning at the way Tony was looking at him: it was like he was frightened of...of something. "What is it?"
If it
said that you could stay here?"
"I-I love you too, but—"
The letter escaped from his shaking hands and floated gracefully to the floor. Tony watched it blankly with tear-filled eyes, and—
for survival;
"No,"
"Well, yeah," Tony replied, back to his normal, chatty self. "You shocked me, okay? I was just offering you a sweet, and then, boom! You were kissing me,"
"Thanks, guys," Tony smiled, then said his goodbyes and headed towards Bruce's lab.
Oh, Lord. Now his cheeks really were blazing. "What?"
"Steve, you
"Tony, wait-"
Steve was surprised. "But when I, um...when I kissed you, you pushed me away...?"
"Tony," Steve breathed, relief washing over him. "Tony—Yeah, I-I'm still here."

-and left without uttering another word.
He set the drawing aside, carefully so as not to crease it, and then started on the letter.
really tired, and he should probably shut up now. It fell silent, and Steve assumed Tony had really fallen asleep this time, when he suddenly heard, "'Love you."
"Wha-" Tony's eyebrows knitted together, and he spun around to see where Bruce was looking. "Oh,"
"How dare you, Steven?!"
"Hey!" Steve pouted. "What do you mean, 'a typical Steve thing'?!"
It was when he nearly passed out again that he decided to ask The Question. It wasn't ideal to do it over the phone, really, but what choice did he have? He was running out of time, and if he didn't ask now, he'd never...he'd never get the chance again.
"Yep," Steve lied, gritting his teeth slightly. "I'm fine, don't worry. The mission is kinda at a-a standstill at the moment, though. Um..." He paused, blinking away black dots that had suddenly appeared in the vision of his one good eye. "I got bored, so I...I thought I about calling you." He was surprised by how easy it was to lie.
"Tony,"
up here," Tony growled, pressing a button on his watch. Within seconds, his Iron Man gauntlet was forming around his hand, and he lifted his arm to point it at Barnes. "You won't

Steve shook his head. "You don't know that,"
his PTSD, then Tony knew there was no point trying to 'wake' him up. He knew that this would only make things worse, and if Steve was picturing the scenes deeply, he probably wouldn't hear him anyway. Tony slowly slipped an arm around his shoulder, and it wasn't long before he was leaning on him slightly, rubbing his hand over his arm for comfort, despite being covered in grease.
To say that Steve was terrified was an understatement. Tony...Tony wanted him to let go of the safety of the bar and glide forward without aid, but that—that was a risky move. It would only take one false move and Steve would be on the floor—
He stepped closer and around the L-shaped sofa to pick up a fallen cushion from the floor — and sure enough, there was Tony, stretched out haphazardly on the couch with his limbs spread out everywhere: one leg was dangling off the side, while the other stood upright and bent at the knee; his left arm was thrown over the top of his head, loosely holding a scrunched-up tissue, but his right hand was resting above the arc reactor, clutching tightly at his phone. He was dressed in an old, faded MIT sweatshirt, what looked like Steve's sweatpants — if the rolled up cuffs at the bottom were anything to go by — and wore Iron Man socks on his feet.
"No, no, it's...it's fine," Tony stammered, still breathless. He rested his forehead against Steve's, staring into his eyes. "Christ, Steve. Where'd ya learn to kiss like that?"
"I-" Tony paused, looking up at Steve's smirking face. He narrowed his eyes for a second, then a goofy grin formed on his lips, and he ducked his head. "Yeah, yeah. Guess I do,"
"Everything okay?"
It was an old Italian lullaby, sung to him as a child, and it seemed to be doing the trick. "
"Are you serious?" Tony scoffed and took a step forwards. "Steve, this man just walked in here with zero explanation, decked head-to-toe in all sorts of weapons, and you expect me to 'be
It took him a while to regain his senses, but he managed to get back onto his feet eventually, leaning heavily against a wall.
"Cap's room," Tony muttered, telling the elevator where to go. Jarvis immediately responded.
That was new. But he followed the AI's words and headed for that floor instead. As soon as the machine stopped and the doors opened, Tony quickly hurried to search for Steve.
"Will do," Bruce complied. "Though I'm sure it wasn't intentional,"
Tony nodded. Using his back to push open the door, he stepped into the room. He took a few seconds to marvel at all of the decorations, and then slowly lowered Steve onto the bed. The blonde stirred slightly, his eyelids half open.
"Yeah? Well, I guess I put two and two together, and-
he was. He knew Steve suffered from PTSD, hell, all of the Avengers did. And with today's storm...the thunder and lightning...they could easily be mistaken for the rolling of tanks and nearby explosions. And the rain: in a way, as they hit the metal exterior of the tower, they did sound a bit like bullets firing.
"Tony," Natasha said, softly. "I can practically hear your worried thoughts right now. Stop it. Steve's going to be fine,"
This didn't seem to do anything. When Steve spoke again, his sentences were longer, and his voice was softer, more emotional. Tony noticed that though the tears had stopped, more were coming, the hurt and the misery clear in his eyes.
. "I'm listening."
Steve was tugging at his sleeve again. "Whatsa Wa'son? Whatsa Wa'son?"
"Tony, stop it," Steve said, and it actually came out sharp and severe. Tony turned to his boyfriend, frowning.
He mumbled against Steve's mouth: "I love you, too," And felt Steve smile.
"Uh-huh," Tony replied, moving Steve to the other side of his body to rest his arm. "See ya,"
Steve nodded his head, squeezing his eyes shut. "M'cold," He was shivering, too.
"Steve is going to be fine," Natasha said, more sternly this time. "Okay? Bruce is going to fix this,"
"Please,"
"Yes!" Steve snapped, because it was true, damn it. "What else am I supposed to think?!"
The blonde blushed more, dipping his head to avoid Tony's gaze, which was
," His boyfriend said carefully, holding even more tightly onto Steve's hand. "You spent seventy years frozen in the stuff, and you—you still have nightmares about it, and I brought you
"Yeah, well, the feeling's fucking mutual," Tony grumbled, staring daggers not at Steve but at the ground, because he couldn't look at his boyfriend, not yet. He heard the light shuffling of feet on the soft bedroom carpet, and then he felt Steve's presence by his side.
