She lies back, legs open in front of him. He dives in, finally giving in to his urges. He kisses from her toes, all the way up to her inner thigh. Her pussy is glistening wet under the low light. He cautiously licks at her core, opening up her folds with his tongue. She rolls onto her side, letting him know exactly what she wants. He kisses up her back, crawling up their large bed before slotting into place beside her. They tangled their limbs together, a well-rehearsed dance, before he enters her.
He helps her out the bath, her centre of gravity completely off. He gets to his knees again and kisses her round belly, his hands on her soft hips. He wraps her in a towel that is getting far too small for her body, and helps to the bedroom. She drops her towel and lets his stare linger over her. She was huge with swollen ankles and stretch marks forming on her hips and thighs.
They have a hunter’s funeral for Maria. She fought to live more than any of them had. Jody comes to offer her condolences, the only person to really understand what they were going through. He clings onto Deanna’s hand, terrified she was going to run into the flames to be with her child.
“You want me to get someone?” he whispers, one hand on her elbow. He can see the look of panic dance through her features. “Let’s get you back to the bed.”
“No, you don’t get to come back in here!” she screams with tears in her eyes, “I needed you, we needed you,” she says and before she knows it she has slapped him across the face. He doesn’t move but a look of disbelief comes across his face.
“I understand,” he says, before placing a strong hand on her back.
“No!” she whines.
“Stay there, I’ll come and get you.”
“No,” she interrupts. She has to see them asleep, see them like a normal mom would see her babies. “Take me to them.” Cas helps her out of bed. She is wearing pyjamas and she knows Cas has washed and dressed her, brushed her hair and cared for her as she slept. Cas helps her to the chair beside the two cribs. They both lay asleep. Her daughter is as perfect as she imagined. Her son is smaller but beautiful, his tiny fist clenched above his head. “I missed so much.”
“I don’t have anyone,” he chokes out.
She hears footsteps and prays she hasn’t woken Sam or his perfect little family up. “You’re in my spot,” Dean says. She looks up at him with blurred vision, he’s holding her purple dressing towards her and dark circles are settling under those eyes. “Thought you might get cold,” he says, offering her the garment. She was sat in her thin silky slip, bare feet and bare shoulders but she hadn’t considered the cold. She takes it from him and cuddles the dressing gown to her chest, feeling how soft it felt against her collar bones.
The car seat gets thrown in the trunk with no care. It’s not like it would ever be used. He can’t help but feel guilty as pregnant women and newborn babies surround him in the car park. Why did they deserve to be happy and Deanna and he didn’t? They had saved the world, again and again, they had given so much to a universe that would give nothing back.
“You guys are so cute,” Charlie claps from behind the bar.
“Why won’t he love me, I want him to love me.” Cas can feel his heavy body trying to slumber, his eyelids drooping. He pulls Dean to his feet, holding him up with his arms under his body. He walks, almost drags, the man to the kitchen and sits him down at the table.
“That I’m happy? That for once in my life I actually did something for me, instead of for you, or for a case, or to try to stop the world ending!”
“You are being sarcastic?” She dives her head back into the steering wheel before she starts to cry.
“It’s safe,” she tells him. She shimmies her panties down to her knees and he helps her take them off. The shirt is hanging from her shoulders, revealing her full breasts. “My water hasn’t broken.” He leans down and kisses her clit. It’s extra sensitive and she visible shivers at his kiss. He gently licks at her core, earnings some purring.
She feels the first cramp after dealing with a haunting, she just blames the pain on the fall to the floor to duck from the incoming statue being thrown at her. She’s in a diner bathroom when she sees the spot of dried brown blood in her panties. She shrugs it off, it was normal to have some blood, she had read somewhere.
“I understand.” He can see the hurt in Cas’ face. He had spent the first part of his afterlife convincing Cas that he did truly love him back. He wasn’t saying it out of politeness or courtesy. Cas was truly the one for him, he doesn’t know how he could convince him more.
“Oh no,” she sarcastically replies. “I always wanted to have a baby in the middle of the apocalypse with a man I met in some bar.”
“You don’t want a child?” She could hear the sadness in her voice, feel the tears in her eyes.
“I’m here,” he murmurs into her hair. This is the first time she had touched him since their loss. Last time they were like this she had a belly, she had larger breasts filling with milk, she had dreams of their future family. He presses his hand against her flat belly before he even realises it. She says nothing as he splays his hands against the now flat, empty space.
“Not married,” she mutters. Not sure which continent the baby’s father is, not sure if he’s ever coming home, more like.
“Peachy,” she mutters, wiping the inevitable eyeliner smears under her eyes.
Deanna says nothing until he drives her home to the bunker. Sam has hidden any sign of their child and her pregnancy. No charts in the kitchen, no books on the table, no vitamins on the tops and clothes in their bedroom. The only thing they brought home was a box of memories, which gets laid down on top of the desk. He watches Deanna sink to the floor in tears, watches her sob and scream, watches her hit the floor until her hand becomes bruised. Watches her curl up in a ball on the tiles. It was like he was watching himself from out of his body. He couldn’t find a way to say or do anything.
“I remember when Sammy was this small,” he says, before clearing his throat with emotion. “Dad gave him to me and told me I had to look after him, no matter what. That’s what big brothers do, protect at all costs.”
“What do you mean? Isn’t it just a cluster of cells,” she says, her voice high with panic.
“I have known Sam some years. I do not believe he would have an issue with you being with a man. I believe he will be happy to see you being so happy.”
“She’s almost here,” he whispers. He strokes the child’s chest, feeling the strong heartbeat under the impossibly tiny ribs.
She thinks labor has started after she and Cas finish a rather long and slow 3 AM sex session. Cas makes her lie on the side and drink a glass of cold water, and they calm down. She thinks it would be a pretty funny story to their kids.
“We’re going round in circles on this case,” he says, sitting down opposite her. “I think I’m going to head back out to the site, I am getting nothing from the statements.”
“Let’s get you some coffee,” Cas starts talking about some television comedy he had been watching recently, trying to keep Dean engaged enough to not fall back to sleep. He makes him a strong cup of black coffee and sits down beside him. He places his hand on his shoulder and lets his grace run through him.  “Why would you do this Dean. You are so important, we need you, Sam needs you, I need you.”
“She’s right there,” he reassures her. It felt incredible to feel unborn life in his hands. She’s starting to push, he can see her bulging and changing from within as her cervix stretched open.
“You really want to conceive our child on the kitchen floor?”
“Cas asked after you,” Sam tells her, perching on the end of her bed.
“Making a baby,” she whispers. She doesn’t mean to say those exact words, but the topic is at the forefront of her mind. She leans ups and kisses him forcefully, feeling the way his hands were exploring her body.
“Yes,” he murmurs. “Jack is strong. Stronger than me.”
“Is he okay?” Jack asks, looking down at him.
“Alive,” he laughs nervously. She leans in and softly kisses him. He places a hand on the bump, feeling it tremble under his touch. “How you doing?”
He cradles the head between shaking thighs. The head moves with every pant Deanna does. Her face is bloodied and purple, and he has no idea if he’s doing the right thing. The next contraction surprises Deanna. She pushes with all the strength she has in her. No matter how hard she tried, and how much she grunted, the child doesn’t move.
He wraps his arms around her bump, and she clings onto his wrists. They move slowly together, her hip bucking when his hand sneaks down to touch her clit. She is writhing and moaning in his arms, her orgasm long and intense. She’s wet and contracting around him, making him come too quick. They entwined until she starts moaning again. He slowly pulls out from her, noticing his dick is wetter than normal. There is a slight gush as his dick slides out of her, like a cork being pulled from a bottle. She laughs nervously and rolls onto her back.
“Cas,” she grins. He gets down on his knees and she leans over to hold his head in her hands. She kisses his forehead and feels him melting into his touch. “I missed you.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. “I shouldn’t have taken you here. We should have stayed closer to the bunker. We should drive to the hospital.”
“Stay there.”
She has nightmares. She sees her dead child fall out of her on repeat, every version more and more warped. At first, he is cold and blue, then he is glowing blue with grace, then he is warped and twisted with a face of pure evil, next he has the teeth of a werewolf, and it goes on and on.
“Is it over?” Deanna gasps, tears rolling down her face. Cas carefully takes the tiny girl in his arms and holds her out to Deanna. He uses his powers to safely cut the cord, not trusting anything in the cabin to be sterile enough.
“Deanna!” Sam says. “Are you okay?”
“Dee,” Cas says, knocking on the door. He opens the door before she can fully pull her panties and jeans up. “You are in distress.”
“I thought I killed him,” she says. She traces his face, trying to remember every part of him.
“I wasn’t there when you needed me. I understand if you would never forgive me.”
Sam said it was all be okay. He would look after her. Cas wakes up to three short but panicked voice messages from him.
“I’m not strong enough, it’s stronger than me.”
“Not like this. Not by creating a whole fantasy world in heaven.”
Deanna stiffens beside him on the bed. “Oh, God. Not another one.”
“Get out,” she says, a little louder than before. “Go now.”
She winks at him before saying, “I’ll hit the sack before I get a full lecture from this one. You coming me with me, angel?” He smiles at her, all gums and crinkly eyes. It’s the most human Cas has ever looked. “Don’t ignore it. You’ll regret it,” she says, looking directly at him.
Sam runs to the bottom of the stairs when she opens the bunker door. “What happened, you weren’t picking your phone up?”
Suddenly there is a tuff of slick black hair between her pussy lips. It disappears again but with another push her lips apart again. Her face is straining and she is gripping the sheets, making grunts but he can see their child. Another push and her labia is splayed out like butterfly wings. She is still touching herself, letting herself stretch out around their child. Dean is too amazed to say anything.
Cas gently knocks Dean’s door. He gets no response, not unusual as Dean often sleeps with his headphones on. He opens the door to see Dean led on his front, his arm hanging limp from his bed. On the floor is a little bottle of pills, someone else’s name printed on the side. Cas can hear how shallow his breathing is, how the tips of his fingers have turned a light shade of blue, how his skin is clammy. He rushes over to Dean, hearing the gurgling from his throat.
Dean doesn’t let out his breath until he’s upstairs, knowing Sam is not around. He rests his forehead on Cas’ shoulder, trying not to think of the worst-case scenarios.
“No,” he says, shaking his head softly. “Cas and I, we’re going to find a way, we always do.”
“I’m here,” he says, one hand on his shoulder and the other on his knee.
All he can do it grip her hand and listen to the wind howling outside. He sees the trees swaying in the gale, can hear the creaking of nature as it’s forcefully beaten by the elements. He’s thankful the log pile has been left high, the fire the only comfort they had asides from each other.
“Fuck,” he murmurs. He pulls away from her and sits up in bed. He turns on the light and rubs his eyes. “I didn’t think you meant it.”
Deanna yawns, not bothering to cover it with her hand. “Missing the coffee, eh?”
“Fuck,” he says, jumping up onto his knees, “Are you okay?”
“A kid?” he asks, looking up at her.
“It’s good,” she murmurs. She laughs again, in relief.
“He knew I didn’t want him,” she quietly murmurs. She rests her head on his shoulder, noticing that he didn’t breathe. “He knew. I didn’t mean it.” It’s he, in all her dreams it was a he.
“I’m sorry, my body failed you,” she says, looking down at her knees.
“I thought you were getting an abortion,” Jack says with a frown as she gets back to the bunker. He looks so much like Cas, she can’t look at him.
“She’s not my niece,” he snaps. “She isn’t real.”
They move them to a little office made for these situations. They offer them a grief councillor, but Deanna shakes her head. They finally get left alone. Just Deanna and him. No daughter. He grips Deanna’s hand but when he opens his mouth nothing comes out. His voice is hoarse and his mouth dry. If he could talk, what would he say?
“Please sleep,” she reminds him. All his tiredness and aches had melted, only to be replaced with love and admiration for Cas.
“I promise, Sam will not be angry. He named his son after you, you are deeply loved by your brother.”
“I understand you do not want to have the child.”
“That’s not the sort of language a mother of an angel should use. You see, heaven is missing angels, it needs a little power boost. Now we all thought Cas would finally come in use and create a Nephilim but he couldn’t even get it up for a beautiful woman like you.”
“Are you okay?” he asks, his hand gently stroking up and down Dean’s side.
“Cas, I think I can feel the head.”
And suddenly he was alone with himself, herself, with this alternate version of her who was raised by her mother, who lost her father as a small child, who spent her adult life with Eileen in the roadhouse. He has a million questions about her world, her life but only one comes to mind first. “So, you and Cas, huh?”
“I don’t care,” she grunts. He pushes her legs apart and positions himself between her legs. He brings his fingers up to probe her passage. She is hot and slick, her passage swollen. He inserts two fingers into the slit, he doesn’t need to probe long before he feels the hardness of her baby’s crown.
Dean slaps Cas’ ass with the rag. “One day you’ll open a beer cap correctly,” he says, watching the angel struggle to get the cap open.
“You shouldn’t be drinking that,” he says. She shrugs, she knows.
“Oh yes,” she smirks. “And then your brain will make you forget all about it. That is how so many women have been duped into having babies. Now, have your waters broken?” she asks. Deanna shakes her head and feels the nausea rushing over her again. “Lying in bed is going to no one no favours.”
“Has your water broke yet, love?” Rowena says, a calming hand on the base of her spine. She shakes her head and rocks her hips from side to side. “Do you think I could check what’s going on down there?”
“Women have been doing shit knocked up for years!”
“Typical Winchesters,” she hears Cas say, she’d know that voice anywhere. She can’t move, can’t open her eyes.
“No, that chick was pissing me off. Too many questions.”
She writes a letter to her babies. She tells them about her parents, about childhood, about her life. She ponders writing a version of her life without monsters, an edited fairytale where everyone she had loved hadn’t died. She writes about her love for Cas, about her love for Sam, about Jack, about Mary, about Bobby. She wishes Bobby could hold her child and pretend he didn’t love them like his own grandkids, she wishes her mother could hold her hand during her labor, she wishes Charlie could distract her with her silly science fiction tv shows.
“I’m sorry.” He looks down at his hands, unsure the right words to convey their grief. He isn’t wearing his trench coat, he knows it makes Deanna uncomfortable. It reminds her of the angel who betrayed who, the angel she blamed for her mother’s death.
For a while he thinks she’s not going to make it. She drinks and screams. She sleeps and rarely leaves her room. He fears one day he’ll wake up and she’d be dead beside him. Her milk still comes in. Her body still aches for the child she birthed. She still automatically cradles the bump, only to find it like jelly and empty.
She wakes up in a room she doesn’t recognise. It looks like a nice hotel room. All fancy wallpaper and expensive bed linen. It smells clean. Not bleach clean but like nothing. She sits up and pulls at her long hair, it has fallen out of the pony she wore on hunts. This wasn’t a motel she’d stay at, or even be let into. She stretches out on the plush bed and feels how expensive the sheets are. She’d love to roll over and sleep, but she knows that would be a dumb idea.
“Where the-” she starts. Cas is by the door, using all the grace he has left to try to open it.
“Cas,” he begs, “After Dad, Sam can’t know about this.”
“Hey!” she scolds, sitting up.
It seems like forever until the passenger door opens and Cas is crawling on the floor to try to reach them. “Deanna,” he calls quietly. His eyes are red, and his voice still panicked. She feels too tired and weak to be able to look at him.
“I’m not going to even be there for its first breath,” she murmurs.
“No, a little cold and in shock. You, on the other hand, I was so scared.”
He flips her over and looks down at her with a passion she didn’t know he was capable of. He strips her, struggling with her jeans, until she is left in her bra and panties. “You are beautiful,” he says with a gummy smile. He removes his shirt, adding it to the discarded pile of clothes on the floor. She gulps as he stands to remove his slacks. His boxers are plain and gray, but entirely smug against his bulge.
“Sandalphon,” Cas says, in a low growl, fist tightening at his side.
“Sam loves you, Dean.”
“I’m here, I feel like I’ve lost a fight to three vamp nests, but I’m here,” she reassures him, before leaning in for a kiss. “You were worth it, James,” she says to her son.
“Well, I don’t.” Sam is rightly cagy about the baby. About the Nephilim, she had drunkenly created with Cas. She knows he wants to ask about her and Cas’ status, whether it was a one-time accident, whether she kept this baby out of love for the angel. She’s glad, she can’t answer any of those questions.
“Let us out dickwad!”
“It’s late, Cas. In the morning.”
“Jack, our universes Jack, he was never a child and his parents were very different,” Sam says. He seems to be dealing with the situation with a calm level of amusement. He didn’t have to see himself as a mother, see himself (or is it herself?) so deeply in love with Cas.
“I wasn’t going to let him die a virgin,” He gulps, he remembers that night. Staying up all night drinking and laughing, comparing absent fathers and strip club disappointments. “Purgatory was fun, eh?” she says with a wink. “You do have a Cas right, who is, I presume, a female?”
“You were in shock. You were bleeding and haemorrhaging so much,” he takes a gulp, like the rest of the sentence is too much to say.
“I can’t do this,” she cries, leaning back against the seat.
“Awkward wee bairn you have here,” Rowena says. She barely notices the squeezing and prodding around her. She wishes Cas’ had been here to witness the birth of their first child, his first daughter, to hold her hand and catch their child. Suddenly a contraction comes out of nowhere, but it wasn’t one of those gentle ones from three days ago.
“I have to see them,” she says, she tries to climb out of bed.
“Yes, the two of them,” he replies. Deanna runs to the nearest trash can to throw up the remnants of the healthy lunch Sam had made them. Cas runs to her side before Sam can get up, rubbing her back and looking back at Jack.
On her way to there was a job. There always was a job. Sure, Chuck was dead, but there were always some nasty waiting to be ganked. It was just one lone vamp, a pretty easy job. She was driving on the highway when she sees a little kid run into the road. She was bleeding and shaken. Every maternal instinct Deanna was sure she didn’t have kicks in.
“I will do anything to make you happy. Anything. Always have,” he clears his throat. “Any issues I have is not because of you, it’s because of me.”
“Creating doors to universes can do that to a two-year-old. Can’t believe something that powerful came from my vagina,” she chuckles. He sits down beside her and gives her a look that isn’t foreign to him. The one she gives back is certainly not one he would ever return.
Her body is quaking beneath his shaky fingers. The shoulder slips out and then back in, sitting underneath her fingertips. She brings her legs down in tiredness, but Cas pushes the back up.
“Anna,” Sam coughs.
“I drunk, I hunted, I didn’t sleep, I ate crap,” she lists. A huge stabbing pain hits her and she grabs out for his hand. Embarrassed, she quickly pulls away from his touch, but he takes her hand back and places it on his lap. He uses this touch to ease some of her pain.
“I still feel her little kicks in the morning,” she quietly tells him, a hand splayed across her flat belly. “I can feel that she likes warm showers, not cold ones and sometimes I think I can feel her moving around.” Cas gently takes her hand in his. He wants to kiss the back of her hand but he’s scared she’d punch him from the gentle action.
She’s never been gladder to have Sam around, Cas still MIA. She is too tired to function, too sore to move, too sad to care. He puts together a diet that helps with her constant morning sickness, puts together an exercise plan she mostly ignores and starts to buy all the boring stuff they need.
“Man, if I could fuck my wait out of every case,” she laughs. Her laugh dies when she sees how solemn Cas looks. “It’s okay, rather you than him.”
“Hello, Deanna,” Jack says with a wave.
“But you think our kid is an abomination.”
“I’ll go and collect our belongings,” Sammy says, standing up and stretching her long limbs.
“Let me,” he says, moving the hand to her belly.
“Cas, if I was a dude would you have still fucked me?”
“Cas,” she murmurs.
“Samuel, cut the cord,” Rowena tells her. She doesn’t notice any of the cord cutting, she’s too in love with the little girl in her arms
“I’m here,” Cas repeats, feeling the comforting rise and fall of Dean’s back. He runs his hand up and down his back, feeling his breath becoming less rugged. The death rattle he had heard earlier was easing. He makes Dean drink his coffee, one hand never leaving his knee.
“Is everything okay, are you okay, are they okay?”
“You don’t know, Cas. Where we come from, how we were raised.”
He watches her body open in slow motion. The teardrop opens slowly to an orb size. The orb grows more than he knew a woman’s body could. She is pushing as hard as she can, the baby finally crowning. The forehead and brow appear in the next push. It takes three more pushes for the nose to appear. Two later the lips and chin.
“Bored.” She kisses him again, this time deeper. She makes a little squeaking noise and wraps her hand under the bump.
“Are you calling me a slut?” She laughs before kissing him deeply. “It was perfect,” She lays naked in his arms, drifting and out of sleep. She feels him trace patterns in her back, symbols in Enochian and strokes her golden streaked hair. “What happens if you’re firing blanks. We stay in here forever?”
“I don’t feel it,” he replies, before yawning. He had slept in his car last night, his neck still sore and his knees creaking. He takes off his towel, comfortable no one was going to walk in, and uses it to dry his hair. She sits up, still agile, and perches at the end of the bed. She groans a little and grips her thighs. She makes a gesture for him to come to her, parting her legs for him. Her panties don’t quite fit her anymore, but it’s not like she could shop in the maternity section of the mall. He could see the outline of her lips, the tuff of dark hair peering out from the top.
“You are?” Dean nervously replies.
“I’m sorry, I tried to-”
“Deanna,” Sam repeats. Cas turns around and shoots him daggers.
“Deanna, I care about you. This isn’t normal.”
“Dee,” he says gently, a hand on her the base of her spine.
“What’s the issue?” She says, getting up carefully from the sofa, her daughter tucked against her chest.
He opens the door to their cabin with trepidation. He’s not sure what he’s going to find, it was a common feeling since he set up camp. She could be dead, she could be bleeding out, she could be cradling their child. It’s silent in their cabin. No weird groups of women breathing together. It’s dark, drapes over every possible light source.
“Dee, I believe we are in an alternative universe,” Cas explains. “Let’s get Jack home and talk this over.”
“Still getting pains?” He was expecting her to have delivered. She complained of pains days ago. He had to leave for two days, but his mind wasn’t on the mission. He could just think about her, alone in the cabin, labouring without him. It was his duty to go, Cas was strong, she could do it.
“I can see the head. Fuck, Cas,” he says. He’s trembling, not in fear, but in awe. He suddenly didn’t feel out his comfort zone. Her body knew exactly what to do. Another push and the head was out. So quickly, he almost missed it.
“I think Stevie needs a feed; I’ll be in her room.”
“I am not firing blanks,” he replies, with an eye roll. “Was it okay? I am not as experienced.”
He finally hooks his hands in her grey cotton panties and pulls them down. He had only ever seen one woman naked before, and he had never inspected anything beneath the waistband. Her center is slick with blood and amniotic fluid. “Should I check for cervical dilation?”
“I’m sorry, I had to get him away from you,” Cas says, crouching beside her.
She distracts herself with watching Sam clutching her daughter, she’s reaching out to clutch his shirt, her little hand gripping hard onto her uncle. “Looks like they’re cooperating, clearly doesn’t take after their mother,” Rowena says. She carries on for what feels like an eternity, pushing and rubbing, talking to Sam about ingredients and spell work.
She picks up the child and hushes him, bouncing him slightly on her hip. She takes a step back into the crack of light. Dean’s gun stays pointed at the crack, waiting for it close again but it doesn’t.
“He left me,” he murmurs again, his body lolling forwards into Cas’ arms.
He looks down at the tiny newborn, barely four hours old. He has that perfect smell and little rosy cheeks. He had done nothing but sleep and feed since he was born, but he was just perfect.
“You do whatever you need to,” he says. It’s like she couldn’t hold back anymore, and he had now given her permission. Her whole body tenses and she gasps. Cas is memorized by her heaving chest, the plaid rising and falling. She holds out her hand, and he takes it. She squeezes him so hard, her knuckles become white.
She sobs into her desk. It was all happening too soon. There was too much left to do, so much left to say. She had felt this before, the ticking time bomb over her head, but back then it was her and Sam, two siblings on the road with the sweetest car in existence. Now she had a home, had a family, had a partner. She cries for all the moments she would miss with her children. Their first bath, their first words, their first day at school. She wouldn’t be able to soothe their cries, tuck them in at night, teach them how to tie their lace. Sam and Cas would do a good job, she knew that, but they would never meet their mother.
“Rosie and Jude, they are perfect,” he looks at her with a fondness.
“No,” she sighs, resting her head in his hands. Her body was so tired, her joints aching and morning sickness ongoing. “I don’t want to know. I want to keep on thinking my baby, mine and Cas’ kid is okay, is good and healthy and freaking normal,” Sam nods, but he doesn’t get it. She touches her belly, feeling it protrude above the top of her pelvic bone. She gets up and feels a sharp lower abdominal pain that causes her to sink back into her seat.
“I believe it is customary to say congratulations.” She snorts out a laugh in response.
“You didn’t?” she warns, slowly clambering out of the bed. Cas looks down in embarrassment, rubbing at the back of his neck. “You didn’t?” she asks again with a deep voice. She can see the answer in his eyes, full of shame and apologies. She can’t look at him.
“Cas?” he asks, some focus appearing in his eyes. He suddenly realises Cas is there, Cas hasn’t left him.
“You’re going to be a fantastic mother,” he says. He watches the pure love in Deanna’s eyes as she strokes her daughter’s slick cheek.
“She suffered a miscarriage last night.” She hears Sam swear and then the door closes, she peeks around and both men have stepped outside to finish the conservation.
Soon, she feels the head against her entrance. It takes a few hard pushes before Rowen says she can see the head. All she can focus on is the odd sensation of her baby working through her pelvis and down the birth canal. Suddenly there is burning as they crown. Rowena grabs her hand and holds it between her legs. She can feel her open entrance, burning and sore, and between it the soft skin of her child’s head.
“You can, just listen to your body, we’ll be there soon,” Cas tells her, sounding miraculously calm. “He’ll be in your arms soon, hold in there.”
“The pressure will get worse but that just means your wee one will be here soon.” That was reassuring for most mothers, but it meant Deanna was another contraction closer to death. She’s surprised at how her body takes over, it automatically pushes and stretches to accommodate her child. She tries to remember any of the breathing exercising Cas has taught her, but her body has taken over and is doing all the work.
Deanna stars to pant, her fingers clawing at his arms. Her belly is quivering against her shirt, her lips are parted and her eyelids heavy.
“I think my water has just broken,” she giggles.
“I feel better stood.” She gently kisses his neck, her belly pushing against him. He misses feeling close to her, their body’s entwined so tight he didn’t know where he ended and she started. Of course, that was how they got into this mess. As an angel, she was worried her strength would be too much for him but once her powers faded, he found she was a rather insatiable lover. She was curious and experimental, loving and trusting. It was a powerful thing to create a life with a woman you loved so much.
“Don’t touch her,” Cas says, but earns a celestial throwing across the room.
“Enough from you. Any more and I’m cutting off your apple juice,” Dean says with a chuckle, pointing a finger at the redhead.
“No,” she says, slapping his hand away. “I don’t want it to disappear. I, I need to feel this.”
He’ll never forget the look on his dad’s face when he first sees him with Cas. He automatically threw his arm over his shoulder and sees the look of disgust on his father’s face. He walks straight out, Mary apologetically following him. He could feel the tenseness in the air, every time he crossed paths with John. He was disappointed, that wasn’t unusual, but disgusted was a new one.
“I did not,” he says.
“Cas, can you save it?” she mutters. He squats down in front of her and places her hand on her tight belly.
“Deanna!” Jack cries. Her body is paralyzed, her limbs unable to move, her eyes unable to stay open. She never had a chance to thank Rowena, apologize to Jack, tell Sam she loved him. Cas wasn’t here to hold her and tell her it was going to be okay, he would never live with himself and she needed him to know he was forgiven.
Deanna sinks to her knees, feeling sick the stomach and like she could sleep for a thousand years. He saw the good in Jack, even when they couldn’t, he died for Jack. Now he couldn’t even accept their own child may be good. It seemed so alien that they could have made something good. He walks away, not even looking back at her crumpled body. She lets out a scream and hits the tiled floor with her palms.
He puts his arms around her and she lets him hug her tight. Her head falls to his lap. “He’s doing this to save you. He truly believes he can save you. He wants to be with you as much as you want him to be here.”
“It’s good to hear your voice.” She smiles to herself, closing her eyes and enjoying the comfortable feeling a normal pregnant woman must hear when talking to their partner.
“You’re going to get rid of our child?”
Sam is snoring in the adjacent bed as she lays wide awake. She splays her hand on her flat belly and wishes her problem away. She didn’t want to make this decision. She couldn’t be a mother, couldn’t strap a baby on her back and hunt down the devil, like her dad would have done. But she had made her lifelong mission to save innocent, not kill them because she was stupid enough to forget to use protection.
Last time he saw her she was at the centre of a tangle of tubes, surrounded by equipment. Her skin was almost translucent. She could move and she could strongly grip his finger, she could make little sucking noises and for a while, they hope. She recognised them. Knew their voices. He thought she would make it. She was a Winchester after all.
“Sh-she-I’m-” she stutters.
“To kill our child.”
“The baby,” he mumbles.
When he returns, wearing nothing but a towel, she is led on her side in bed. “You look good,” she says with a soft smile. She rubs circles on her belly, her shirt falling open to reveal her enlarged nipples. She has turned the light bedside light on, giving the room a deep glow.
“She’s right there,” he tells her, removing his fingers.
“She’s right, I think you should go,” Cas says.
“It?”
He speeds to the hospital, half asleep, his hair still sticking up in all directions. Sam is waiting for him in the hospital hallway. “She’s in the office,” he murmurs, hands deep in his jacket pockets.
“We won’t ever forget her,” he’ll tell her.
Less than a month later she feels like she is being stabbed in the belly. It’s the worst period cramp she has ever felt. There is no doubt what is happening to her body. She looks for the nearest motel, not caring where they were supposed to be going.
She has to sit at the edge of the bed, her body too heavy to stand for too long. He sits down beside her, and they kiss again, their knees knocking together. He takes the moisturizer from her hand and opens it. He smells the light vanilla scent, before dipping a finger in it. He smears it across her new, large breasts. She looks down at the smear of white and laughs. She dips her fingers into the jar and smears on the dry skin of her hips. He rubs it in into the stretched skin. She hadn’t really how horny she was until she felt his touch on her skin. He starts to rub moisturizer across her belly and hips, his hand sneaking up under her breasts. She rests her weight back on her arms, outstretched behind her, and tips her head back in enjoyment.
Her second child is a little blue but appears to be healthy enough to cry. She opens her arms up to quickly hold her second child, but her vision is starting to blur. The cord has already been cut and Rowena is rubbing vigorously at the baby’s back. She desperately needs to hold her child, needs him to be okay, needs to be safe in her arms.
He lets her sleep on his chest, his firm broad chest the perfect pillow. He wraps his arms around her and it reminds her of purgatory. She shouldn’t feel safe in his arms, but she does. When she wakes up, no idea how many hours had passed, he is still led beside her. “So, it’s done?” she tiredly asks, holding back a yawn.
“There’s two,” Jack smiles, holding up a v sign.
“Deanna,” a voice, solemnly says. She lets out a choke in response. “Are you in pain?”
Cas doesn’t come back and she refuses to interact with anyone. All she does is pee, eat grilled cheese, cry and sleep. She’s so tired, her breasts so sore, she can barely eat without throwing up. She Googles every symptom, there is nothing special about her pregnancy symptoms. This wasn’t some side effect of being knocked up by an angel, this was totally normally. Why would woman want to go through this multiple times?
They make love side by side, her leg hooked over his hip. What would happen once their time ran out? Would they just kill them both or would he do the job himself? They make love like it was their last time together, the clock ticking over their heads. She gasps out her love for him, clawing at his back, a weighted lifted off her chest with those three words.
She wakes up gasping for breath. Cas is sat beside her watching a weather report on the grainy tv. “You were having a nightmare.”
He sticks around for a few weeks after. She finally feels comfortable to nest, now all her family was here. They set up a room with two of everything in it. Jack gets involved in decorating, although paints more of himself than he does the wall. Cas finds flat-pack furniture infuriating and she sees him lose his cool at an alarming frequency. Sam is a bit better, although he gets a little too excited at the instruction manual.
“Hey, baby. I’m your mommy,” she whispers. She can feel his fist against her maternity bra, his body slick and cold with fluids. She still feels liquid gushing from between her legs and she leans against the cool glass of the door, waiting. Her body is going into shock, she knows the feeling, the chills and the blurred vision.
She grabs a beer from the fridge and takes a seat outside the motel, on the little porch by the door. “You shouldn’t stalk women in the dark,” she tells the shadowy figure in the trench coat to her left.
When he enters her it feels right. She had forgotten what it felt like to have sex with someone you have feelings for. It was so wholesome and pure. They entwine their limbs together and nuzzle at each other’s cheeks. It takes a few strokes for him to find a rhythm, but they fall perfectly in sync. He doesn’t last as long as they both would have liked. He rests his head against and mutters, “I love you.” She smiles and kisses him back.
“Aw, a surprise? I suppose these days everyone is so gender-neutral. I imagine you’re going home to your husband and laugh at this old broad here talking about gender.”
“It’s dangerous, Jack wants us here. Jack was trying to save us.”
“Yes,” Jack answers. “Cas and I put lots of equipment in there.”
“You’re going to leave me with him?”
“Best get to it, it’s getting dark,” she says, standing back up with a slight groan. Everything was a bit more of a struggle in the last two weeks. Her back a little more aching, her belly strained recently, her face a little more bloated.
“No,” she cries, clinging onto his lapels.
Now all they had of her was some items in a box in a bereavement office. Her hospital tag, her tiny knitted hat, her little onesie, her little blanket. They were all gifted by the hospital. All the items they had brought their child would go unopened and unworn. Sam has gone back to hide them, he knows that. Deanna holds the tiny little tag in the palm of her hand.
“I understand. I’m not here for that.” She finally lets go, lets her guard down, sobbing into his chest. He takes her face in his hand and kisses the trails of tears that are running down her cheeks. They’re tinted black from the mascara she was wearing that morning.
“I’ll be home soon.”
Deanna is curled up in the chair, eyes red and skin splotchy. “Mr Winchester,” their doctor says. He sits down in the chair, feeling numb. They tell him that their daughter’s lungs could never form right. Respiratory distress syndrome, that’s what he calls it. He doesn’t care about the ifs and the whys. Not now. He will later. But now all he knows is that his daughter is dead. At three days old Maria was dead. They talk in short sentences. They sign forms. He and the doctor talk. Deanna says nothing. Her eyes are glazed over and watery, her knees are curling up towards her chest.
Jack and her son disappear out of sight and Cas’ lips are suddenly on her head. He’s kissing her forehead and gripping her hand, “We have to deliver the placenta,” he says in an unnervingly calm voice.
“You will be a good mother.”
“I don’t want some Colonel Sanders getting hot and heavy on top of me. I want you.” He smiles weakly at her, eye filled with worry, but she pulls him in for a deep kiss. She knows how angels are once they get an idea in their head, she was genuinely scared at the way they would try to impregnate her.
“Are you in pain?” he asks. She absent mindlessly strokes her large belly, that peers up between the bubbles in the water.
“You ever think about trying for another?”
“I don’t think they are bad,” Jack says. She had forgotten he was even there, sat quietly watching it all unfold. He crouches in front of her. “I think you and Cas are good people. I don’t understand why anything you would create would be bad.”
“And now. What do you believe?” she asks, rolling over and winces at the ache in her hips.
“You’re carrying a child.”
“Why did you go?”
“Jack is not wiping out our kid!” she snaps, pulling away from his touch. “I will not have that sit on his conscience; the kid has enough issues how it is.”
“I think she’s in shock,” he replies. She clings tight to the life hidden in the trench coat on her chest. “Can I hold him?” She nods and eases her grip, allowing him to take him in his arms. He beams down at his son, whose face is scrunched tightly. “Jack!” he shouts. “Meet your little brother.” Jack perches on the end of the passenger seat and takes his brother in his arms. Cas helps him hold him safely, supporting his head correctly.
She unbuttons his shirt slowly as he stands unnaturally still. She slides his shirt off, revealing his wide broad shoulders. She rests her head against his chest, feeling a heartbeat that wasn’t keeping him alive. She wraps her arms around his back, feeling his warmth and taking in his scent. He gently kisses the top of her head. She was usually his height in her boots but now she seemed so small and delicate as he wraps his arms around her.
“It’s okay,” he reassures with a low voice. She doesn’t reply, instead, she turns her face away from him and moans into the pillow.
She ends up sliding down his side in pain, and her head falling onto his lap. Her legs stretch out before her, blood pooling on the dirty tiles. Her child deserved a better place to die. If she was alone she might have sobbed or punched the tiles, but in Cas’ company, she couldn’t let go. Instead, she lays her face on his thigh and cries slow and silent tears. Her body is contracting and clotting, she has no control over what is happening. Cas’ hand sits awkwardly on her back, occasionally patting it.
“Hey, you need to stay awake,” he responds, rubbing at the back of Dean’s head, letting his grace run through him. Dean’s head is limp on Cas’ shoulder, his breath ragged and rattling.
“It can get chilly in here,” he defends himself. She strokes her daughter’s rosy cheeks and her heart fills with love seeing those familiar blue eyes look up at her. “We’re going to have to move soon, we’re too near the lake.”
Sam jumps up and crouches up beside her, his hand on her knee. “You okay?” he asks. She nods tearfully, her hormones overtaking all her emotions. “You need to take it easy,” he reminds her. “You’ve looked after me my whole life and you’re going to look after this kid for its whole life. But for now, I need you to look after yourself and let me help.”
“I’ll do it,” Cas says, before her jeans can get pulled down. “Get your hands off her.”
“She didn’t,” Sammy snaps. “They can’t. Months Cas and I spent trying to save her, but Dee died during the birth. Cas died during defending her during the birth. I-”
“Hey, angel,” he smirks. She runs her hand up his shirt, across his still toned body. “What you up to?” He asks between kisses.
“Yes, you can,” she says, gripping Deanna’s shaking knee. “We’ve got this strapping lad to help you.”
He traces patterns on her large quivering belly. He sees the area between her legs bulge. He knew every curve of her body’s landscape, and it was changing as she prepared to push. He couldn’t see the head but it was clearly there, just inside her. He doesn’t know what to tell her, anything of those cliches of pushing and breathing redundant.
“Dee-” he starts.
“You knocked me up?” she asks, rolling onto her back and stretching her legs out.
“Is that okay?” she asks.
“Chill. Your kid is acting like an asshole today.”
“Well someone has to keep an eye on me,” Dean jokes. “Walk around, catch up, people will be happy to see you.”
“They would have been born today; we should have a little girl here. We should have some fucking apple pie life and a yard, a little yellow nursery and not a plot of land with her ashes in.”
“Sleepy,” she tells him with a soft smile. “Happy,” she adds with a sigh.
“Not you as well.”
“I know,” he replies, holding onto her arms to keep her steady. Her back is stiff and her legs wobbly.
Cas returns when she is in her tenth week of pregnancy. She has already started to get a small bump and her breasts have gone up over a cup size. She doesn’t know Cas is back until she bumps into him on her way out of the bathroom.
“Because you took a bottle of sleeping pills. You tried to kill yourself!” Cas says with a raised voice, sitting Dean down on the couch.
“You ever think about Gia?” she tiredly mumbles into his neck, her cold bare legs entwining with his.
“Like Stevie Nicks?” Sam asks.
“I’m so tired,” he says, rubbing at his eyes.
“Hey,” Dean nervously says. “I should probably tell you something. Cas lives here with me.”
“I failed her,” she says. Cas grabs Deanna and shakes her, telling her it wasn’t her fault on repeat. “She was perfect and I couldn’t look after her. My body failed her. This stupid fucking body failed her.” And they fight, she hits his chest and he grabs her shoulder. She screams at him and he grabs her wrist. They leave bruises and scratch marks. He feels nothing but heartache.
Deanna’s face crumps up, fear seeping into the lines around her face. She digs her short nails into his arm, her breaths coming ragged and sharp. The cabin had towels and sheets, although poor quality Cas had done what he could to cleanse them. The fire has been lit, embarrassingly Deanna had to teach him to make it work between contractions.
She walks down the stairs heavy-footed. Her body aches, heavy and sore. She’s slept but her body is tired and empty. She automatically clutches her belly as she pads down the stairs, but her belly is small and soft now. She feels light, but also empty and lonely.
“What’s it to you?” she snaps back.
“Baby is led traverse.”
She lays back and closes her eyes, waiting for the contractions to take over again. She feels Rowena’s nimble fingers on her belly, prodding and squeezing. “I’m going to try to turn this baby.” She nods, not entirely sure what was about to happen. A cold gel is applied to her belly and she watches as Rowena makes smooth motions, slightly pressing down.
“I have to wait for Cas, he has to be here.”
“I will make the bed for Sam.” Cas disappears into their spare room leaving Dean to worry once more. Cas doesn’t make eye contact when he enters the room. He cuddles up behind the angel, nuzzling into his neck.
“Don’t,” she snaps. She didn’t want to hear it, no sympathies, no ‘it’s not your faults’, no promises of another child in the future. “I couldn’t keep him safe. I failed him.” She finally lets go, sobbing into her hands. She doesn’t know if the pain has eased, Cas was working overtime or the shock of her miscarriage had numbed the pain. She looks down to see her panties magically clean, the blood celestially gone. She looks at Cas but he is looking down at his lap, hands clenched together on his knees. “What happens now?”
“What do you see?” She asks, through gritted teeth. What could he say? He was scared seeing the pussy he spent years thinking about, touching, kissing stretch would revolt him. Instead, it was amazing. She was strong, he knew that already, she rebelled and protected him. Now her body was stretching open to help their child into this harsh world. He thought she would be screaming in pain, but she is calmly grunting.
“You’re a chick.”
“I couldn’t give her the life she wants, the life she deserves but now I can.”
“I’m fine,” she scolds him. She hears Sam at their front door, asking how she is.
Sam tells him about Eileen, about his son, about his retirement. Dean tells about the roadhouse, about LARPING with Charlie, playing pool with Jo. He doesn’t much the flat he shares with Cas. He doesn’t mention the ring he wears around his neck.
He takes off his trench and jacket, letting them fall to the floor. She runs her hands down his shoulders and arms, feel how strong the muscles are underneath his shirt. He’s solid and powerful, his chest broad and strong.
He kisses the top of her head. She leans up and gently kisses him, her lips barely touching his. “I can’t, I’m still not ready.”
“Jack saved me, saved us,” Deanna adds with a casual shrug. She was a pretty hot woman, even if he did say so himself. The freckles he hated somehow looked beautiful along her tanned skin, the green eyes he had thought were boring we pretty striking on her.
“I’m here,” he whispers. Now wasn’t the time to talk about his issues with Dean. He felt the man’s despair, his loneliness, his hopelessness. Dean falls into Cas’ chest, his fists clutching at his shirt. “I’m here. Not going anywhere.”
The house is quiet, and her body fills with fear. She lets out a breath when she sees him on the sofa. He is bent over a little bundle of blankets. She walks around the side in their cabin on tiptoes, careful to not disturb the scene.
“I’m sorry,” he says, looking up at her solemnly. “Your child has already passed.” She knows it, she knows that her body is empty.
“Are you okay?” the mother asks. She didn’t realise she has been rubbing her belly and making faces, up their driveway.
Sam is a lifesaver those early weeks. Giving her antacid when her heartburn keeps her awake, buys her fibre rich food and doesn’t wake her up when she falls asleep on the couch. He takes Jack on hunts and leaves her to rest.
When she gets to there she climbs onto the bed on all fours. It feels instinctive and natural to be in this position. Rowena disappears and comes back with Sam and their ingredients. Deanna finds this position has sped up the intensity of the contractions.
“I’m sorry,” she gasps into his chest.
“You have an infirmary, right?”
“He left,” he murmurs.
She doesn’t sleep but it gives her more time to spend with Cas. She realises that she had been entirely in love with him the last decade or so. She only wishes she had done this early (the fucking and the talking, not the knocking up).
“When have we ever been normal?”
“I could use my powers,” he replies with an eye roll.
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” he replies through gritted teeth.
“Breathe,” he reminds her, making her sit at the edge of the bed.
“Not since the test went blue,” she responds. She still accepts the seat on the couch and a drink of cool water. She lays her hand flat against the swell of her belly, clad in a flannel shirt, and feels her baby flutter beneath her fingertips. She’d miss that feeling, knowing they were safe as they performed star jumps inside her
She wakes up in the familiar motel room, it smells like damp and fried food. It smells like her childhood. The springs dig into her back and the ceiling fan is mouldy. Cas is on the phone, pacing up and down the room. She sits up in the bed, feeling her head throbbing.
“I want a baby, I want a family, I want to be a mother,” she murmurs.
“I believe,” he replies, turning on his side to face her, “that Jack is good, we made him good. Our child will not be as powerful as Jack, they will not be as strong, but they will be good.”
“Are they okay?” Sam asks, somewhere in the distance.
“Like I didn’t see all those heart eyes,” she smiles. “Now let’s get back to helping these wee ones topside.”
“You see you have the perfect body to bear an angel, or two. When Cas gave it all up for you, we thought we could at least get a new soldier. The righteous woman and the rebellious little angel were going to create a perfect child, but you couldn’t even do that right.”
“You know, I think I’m done here,” she snaps, realizing she wasn’t going to get through the dense report. She gets up, curling her hand under her belly and walks out the station’s back office. “Sam, we’re going now.”
“Let me see,” he says with a gulp. “Is that okay?” he asks. She nods, her body limp like a ragdoll. His heart is racing looking at the blood-stained denim. He unbuttons her jeans with a shaky hand, hooking his fingers in the waistband and yanking them down. Her panties and thighs are stained with red. He looks away, embarrassed at seeing her so vulnerable. No number of books prepare you for the moment in real life.
“Bring your legs up, Deanna,” he urges, remembering the passages he’d read in his books. He helps her draw her shaking legs back as far as they can go. Her face is red and scrunched up in pain. Her frantic pushing comes to nothing. Cas scans his memory for something to help her.
“I hope mine is as cute as yours,” Deanna whispers. She gets a sharp pang in response. A typical Winchester, couldn’t take any form of a compliment. She wakes up the little girl who tells her where she lives.
“And you don’t have a kid?” Deanna asks him.
“Precious cargo on board,” she says. He grabs her by the arm as she tries to walk past him.
Afterwards, she leans against him, still in their favourite spot behind the kitchen worktop. He drapes the dressing gown across her feet, worried they would get cold.  “You’ll never be your father,” she tells him. He wraps his arms around her body and holds her tight.
“I’m gonna shower,” he tells her, feeling confident enough to leave her alone. He has a quick shower, regretting all those hot steaming showers he hasn’t enjoyed. He would take a grimy motel shower, compared to the tin bath they currently had.
Dean can’t believe who is sat in front of him. She has his green eyes, his freckles, his scars, his bow legs. She loves Led Zeppelin, drives an Impala, hates salads, loves beer. Sammy is sat beside her, tall and thin, her neck long and her arms strong. Jack is small and fragile yet a happy child. He climbs over the table and pulls at Deanna’s hair.
Outside the cabin, the storm rages on. When they left the bunker the winter sky was blue and crystal clear. She was going stir crazy cooped up inside, the fights it was causing were not healthy for either of them. Ice and hail rains down on them, echoing on the tin roof of the out-house. He tried to get them out but when the pains came, he feared she wouldn’t make the drive home. That’s when they discovered the little run-down cabin on the edge of the forest. It was warm and it was dry.
“You see anyone?” he whispers.
“Not every kid gets an angel at their funeral,” she replies as brightly as she can. She takes the pie from the paper bag and climbs into bed. “Let me show you the wonders of daytime TV. Take off that coat, feel like I’m filing my tax returns.”
“No, Dean,” she says, looking down at the way their hands join in his lap. “I won’t force you into such a big life decision.”
“Look at gorgeous he is,” she strokes his soft slumbering cheek. “I can’t imagine how magical it must be to bear and birth your own. I want to have a baby with you, Dean.”
Cas gets into paternal mode, researching birth plans and learning every breathing method ever invented. Sam buys her more comfortable furniture for the Deanna cave, turns out every chair in the bunker was greatly uncomfortable on her everything. She sits on their new sofa, her back pressed against Cas’, her legs up on a little stool. Jack and Cas have put together a list of names, most of them entirely strange and definitely not what she was going to call them. She appreciated their enthusiasm.
“What are you doing?” he asks, with a gulp.
Sam smiles and pats him on the back when he sees the roadhouse. Every detail is the same. Except now Dean wasn't ashamed. He was no longer scared to fall asleep and wake up the next day.
“I can’t do this,” she sobs.
“It’s to support her lower back,” Sam adds, from where he was sat at the table.
“Ann Wilson,” the nurse calls. She sits silently, looking down at the linoleum, feeling Sam’s eyes on her. She stands up, clears her throat and walks out the door away from the nurse. Sam follows her to the Impala.
“You got to live a full life, have a wife, have children, grow old. She died needlessly young, just as she was about to start her life, she never got the chance to be a mother, to be normal.”
The walk silently to her room, making sure to not wake anyone else up in the bunker. It’s the first time he’s been in her room since they lost their daughter. The first time she had acknowledged their loss since the buried her ashes in the nearby forest. The stand in front of each other at the end of her bed, their bed.
Finally, Sandalphon reappears, still wearing that godawful white suit. “Well Castiel, I didn’t think I had it in you.” He stares at the floor and then suddenly a flash of light appears. Two fingers touch her head, and she falls to the floor with a thud.
She opens her legs wide again and strains with the new pressure inside her. Cas watches in terror and amazement as her lips bloom again. The teardrop grows, the skull pushing against the soft, thin skin. Her hips are bucking and she is crying. He can’t help but gently cup his hand against her slick sex, white and strained with the crowning head. He can feel the pressure against his hand.
It was supposed to be a milk run. Pick up some goods, get out the bunker for a few hours and go home before Cas noticed she was out. She didn’t feel great, she hadn’t for a good seven months. Her joints felt painful, her pelvis heavy and she was permanently nauseous. She hated the way people watched her waddle around Walmart, staring at her compact yet heavy bump, asking to touch it. To start with she loved her little bump, it took a while to pop, but once she stopped looking like she’d eaten a big dinner she found her belly quite sexy. She loved rubbing it, loved when Cas rubbed it more and then all the other pains and pressure started.
