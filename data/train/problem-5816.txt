‘I never realised there was so much magic in the world,’ Cassie says, her eyes wide. ‘Can you teach me any of it?’
‘You taught me plenty,’ he reassures her, pulling Steve along behind him. ‘I just can’t always find room for everything alongside the equations up here,’ he points to his temple.
Laura smiles in thanks and takes her and Clint’s mugs of coffee, leaving him alone again in the kitchenette. He starts making pancakes, humming softly to himself and trying not to feel too happy with himself. A pair of arms sneak their way around his middle when he’s making the third pancake and he looks over his shoulder.
‘Which means you’ve thought about it,’ Bruce sighs in a way that is as long-suffering as any sigh Pepper ever gave him.
Tony bursts out laughing at the look on Natasha’s face. ‘Well it isn’t Miss Romanoff, Nat,’ he supplies.
‘Young Peter!’ he booms as soon as he catches sight of him and comes over, putting his hand so hard on Peter’s shoulder that he starts choking on his mouthful. ‘It is good to see you again!’
‘That’s why we’ve got Steve and Bucky: they were fighting HYDRA. They’re our first enemy. Thanos just overtook them in importance.’ After a pause she adds. ‘We’re never going to get rid of them completely you know.’
‘The old Mark II is downstairs, kid,’ Tony says, ‘ready for you to have a tinker whenever you want.’
May just sighs. ‘No going out on patrol still.’ Peter shakes his head. ‘Alright, just be careful and make sure you pass anything on to Natasha alright?’
‘Call us if you need anything. And don’t lose hope,’ he replies, returning the salute and standing back as Tony boards the jet.
he thinks to himself, missing the comforting weight of his daggers as he forms an ice weapon at the end of each arm,
Tony knows it’s that time of year again when he walks into the common area to hear overly cheerful music being played at breakfast.
Peter, and even Wade, end up being pretty helpful and moving between all the new skaters and giving pointers and help where needed. Nebula takes to it like a duck to water, and she even goes to help Mantis.
‘Sorry, Cap, but I’m not going to trust he’s not up to his usual mind tricks,’ the archer growls, Scott’s looking between him and Loki like he’s watching a tennis match.
‘There seemed to be enough of you not that long ago,’ Ross smirks at him. ‘What about that Spiderman that you’ve been getting so friendly with? And Stephen Strange, and King T’Challa? I’ve found three more without breaking a sweat.’
‘Peter? Honey come on talk to me,’ May pleads, he can sense the rest of the occupants have started to notice something wrong, but it doesn’t fully pierce the fog in his brain.
He nods. ‘You mind taking the lead with this? I may not have actually gotten any sleep last night and I’m still too wound up to mention Ross without blowing a gasket. Vision and Wanda can join us when they get back.’ As she nods he gives her a smirk.
There’s a chorus of cheers and agreements and, as Wade puts his arm around his waist and starts directing him to the kitchenette, Peter keeps his eye on Nebula. She’s now standing at the bottom of the steps and looking at the newly decorated tree with a pensive look on her face.
‘Yeah,’ he croaks out, unable to even attempt to calm his shaking as he pushes his covers off, letting the cool air of the room calm him. Before he’s even managed to get his breathing under control his door is opening and Steve’s walking in, only in his pyjama trousers and hair still mussed from sleep.
‘Sir! There’s been intruders!’ of course one of the few guys to actually make it into work today decides to reappear at this moment and warn him.
‘If you say anything resembling the word “proper” I swear I’ll kick your arse from here to Brooklyn and back again.’
‘No,’ Peter admits, looking back out the window. ‘Wanda promise me you won’t tell anyone and promise me you won’t freak out?’
‘How about instead of seven more bowls we just get you a sundae with seven different flavours?’ MJ suggests.
‘Yeah, I want to find out what these packages are,’ Quill says, poking at a pile of similar looking parcels. Loki hides his grin behind the mug that Wanda passes him, and winks at Peter. Who proceeds to turn bright red and look away, prompting a laugh from Wanda.
‘This is stupid, this is stupid, this is stupid,’ Clint chants as he jumps back into the café through the blasted out window. ‘Rhodey? Hulk?’
‘He’s probably about the same as you,’ Tony tells him, giving the dark haired man’s hand a squeeze. ‘Come on, Elsa, I thought you were supposed to control the ice.’
‘We have a final draft all ready to go, T’Challa is ready to call a meeting at the UN as soon as you give the word,’ she responds, handing him a tablet with the document on. ‘Any last alterations?’
‘Wanda Maximoff is a member of the Avengers and, as such, has made a promise to protect this world and everybody on it. She is making a concerted effort to improve control of her abilities so as not to cause any unintentional harm in the future; and if I’m honest is working harder than I did building the first Iron Man suit in a cave in Afghanistan,’ the last part of that sentence is spat at the crowd. ‘And perhaps I should remind you that without those powers more than half of the population of Sokovia would still have been within the city limits when it started heading skyward. As it was only a quarter of the population still remained to be evacuated.’
Matt just shrugs. ‘Her heartbeat.’ Is all the answer Peter gets before the vigilante starts talking with Ned and MJ about his abilities.
as well, Peter. And by trying to push it so much you’ll be telling him you don’t respect him enough to respect
‘-but I’ve just spent the best part of an hour consoling a man who I have never seen cry before in my life. And he watched me kill me his parents.’
Steve looks up, surprised to find the other man still there. He thought he’d left with Sam and Bucky. ‘What is?’
Lorena laughs. ‘I think, my king, you will be the best ruler of all your forefathers if you continue as you are. Goodnight.’
‘I can return the Hulk! We shall have a glorious contest and I will return him once I have bested him!’ Thor says, turning to face the forest.
‘Same reasons, Pete. You understand the scientific jargon and can double check anything Pep isn’t sure about. Besides this way no one outside of the team needs to know we’re gone anywhere for anything other than a brief break. It can look like I’m still able to sign off for things even if we have to go off grid for a day or two.’
‘In a way yes it was, Nathaniel,’ he turns to respond quietly to the boy, though still loud enough for others to hear. ‘I shan’t bore you with the details, but in summary: as a Jotun I was supposed to be a sworn enemy of Asgard. In order to try and ensure that I was treated the same as Thor, our father kept my true parentage a secret and raised us as brothers. I suppose he didn’t want me to feel like I was a prisoner as I was growing up, or have me want to turn on the rest of Asgard because I was different to them. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances I found out the truth, the thing he was trying to avoid ended up happening and when I…
having you ruin our shot at getting the attention of the main weapons supplier of the US Army. Do I make myself clear Rogers?’
A/N: Ok so please remember that I love you all dearly and I apologise profusely for everything in this chapter. Also please do let me know what you think.
Peter would be lying if he said he wasn’t completely drained by the time they sat down to dinner that evening. He’s pretty sure the rest of the team haven’t been told about his little breakdown that afternoon as no one mentions anything, and no one seems to treat him differently. Well except Wanda being a bit more ‘big sister’ with him; he’s not even sure he minds it that much.
He blinks his eyes open, wincing at the brightness that assaults his eyes, making them water. Turning his head, his neck muscles protesting, he sees the reason his hand won’t move: there’s a mop of messy brown hair lying on top of it.
‘I’d love to see you try and explain it to Ross,’ Natasha laughs as she lands the jet and grabs her bites.
Tony and Steve share a look. ‘Wanda,’ Peter’s voice is soft, ‘Vision isn’t here. He’s in Wakanda waiting for Shuri to work on him after we faced Thanos.’
‘Yeah well having a fully functioning brain can do that to a guy,’ he replies, then grins. ‘Plus getting all the embarrassing growing up stories about Tony from Rhodey helps.’
‘Clint come with me,’ Natasha says, ‘let me explain outside.’ He looks ready to argue again, but she grabs his arm, twisting it behind his back in a lock, and all but shoves him outside.
‘Bets please gentlemen,’ Wade grins, taking out a pen and piece of paper and writing down their bets.
‘Right,’ Steve forces the word past his closing throat and careful picks up the broken genius. It’s terrifying how light he feels, and Steve makes sure his shield is covering as much of Tony’s body as possible as he starts to move.
‘I suggest we all get some rest,’ T’Challa says, ‘where would be the best place for the General and I to stay?’
‘Alright,’ MJ appears back next to their table with three bowls in her hands. ‘These are for you, we’ve put one ice-cream and one sorbet in each bowl for you,’ she explains putting two in front of Loki.
‘We can’t let him keep doing this,’ Steve is surprised his voice comes out so firm, he was sure it’d be a wavering mess. Everyone turns to him in surprise.
Tony looks away, blinking at the tears gathering in his eyes. ‘Not sure how I feel about that. You’ve made a lot of promises to me before.’
Before Bucky can respond the link is firmly shut, giving him a sharp pain in the side of his head. ‘Ow,’ he grumbles. ‘Bastard’s on his way,’ he tells the other two, throwing his bag into the trunk and then slipping into the backseat. Tony’s already in the driver’s seat and Steve’s waiting by the trunk for Loki to appear.
‘It’s really good,’ he says, taking another spoonful. He looks at Rhodes and grins. ‘If you don’t want yours I’ll have it.’
Peter groans and the two of them rush out of the doors. Sure enough there is Tony Stark, leaning against a car that he’s parked right outside the gates. Not even a blind man could have missed him. Students are already starting to gather a little away from him, obviously unsure if they should approach or not.
‘What kind of a question is that?’ Peter demands. ‘MJ’s my friend and I don’t like her like that. No offence MJ.’
‘I must admit I am pleased you decided to do this, Tony,’ T’Challa says as they watch Thor place it at the base of the bonfire they’d built and raise Mjolnir to the sky, calling on his lightning to light the Yule log, ‘it is good to celebrate new traditions and festivals with friends.’
So when I see Tony climbing to his feet, struggling to hold his arm still and stop it from shaking, I run forwards before he can snap and I grab his hand.
‘It’s not the fact that we made the weapons that makes it hard for me to sleep at night now, it’s the fact that I
stones,’ Loki says, ‘not with my rule still so new, loyalties not yet fully known, and our army depleted after the battle with Thanos.’
‘I know,’ he says quickly. ‘I know, we need to be less direct than would be ideal. I never intended to try and take him out physically. Though I’m sure you and Barnes could manage it between you,’ he says with a half-smile. ‘But all that would do would create a space for another person to step into. One we don’t know quite so well.’
Bucky nods and takes the seat opposite him, glad of the coffee table between them to act as some sort of barrier. He’s still not sure he really wants to be asking for this, but he needs to know. ‘I- you took over Clint’s mind when you first arrived here didn’t you?’
‘We’d have to deal with contractors coming in and doing up the place for a few weeks. Wouldn’t exactly be peaceful,’ the inventor says eventually.
When he next opens them he’s alone and lying sideways on the sofa and someone’s put a blanket over him.
Wade looks over at Peter, grinning with a snowball in each hand. ‘Time to make some chimichangas Baby Boy.’
‘We will not be cowed by a second rate being such as-’ whatever she was going to say is cut off by the largest axe Tony has ever seen flying into her, and taking her head clean off. The axe goes flying backwards, very reminiscent of Mjolnir, and into Thor’s outstretched hand.
‘Oh god, I’m so sorry,’ he starts babbling, ‘I didn’t mean to give away EDITH I just didn’t know what to do and I was feeling-’
‘Tony Stark? My name is Doctor Stephen Strange, I’m the Master of the New York Sanctum and I’d like to know why you have allowed a threat to the world into your home,’ the man responds.
There isn’t much about the facility that Peter doesn’t love. But, next to spending to time in the lab with Tony, the training room is his favourite place to go. It’s getting all the fun of having the Spider-Man powers, without having to remember the responsibility.
The team face Thanos and desperately try to protect Vision from him. Peter faces a race against time to save Tony.
‘You’ll be fine, Steve. Don’t forget dances today are nothing like what we used to do. Just move side to side and don’t step on her toes.’
‘Tell me, Ross, are you deliberately trying to sabotage the team now? Are you trying to break us up again? Or are you just moving on to trying to take down other members of the team now that you’ve realised you can’t take me out?’ Tony’s voice is cold and hard, and he feels a small sense of achievement at the look of fear that flickers across the other man’s face.
Peter turns to look at where he’s pointing, and his spidey senses start tingling. ‘Karen? Can you get me sound?’
Bucky nods showing he understands what Tony is saying, though he doesn’t look particularly convinced of the truth in the statement. Though honestly, Tony is not sure he’s making the most sense.
‘Give the guy a minute Sharon,’ Sam frowns at her. The woman crosses her arms over her chest but mercifully remains quiet.
‘Please drop all these titles and just call us all by our first names. You do know it’d make Tony’s life if you did right?’
He hangs up and shoves his phone into his pocket, puts the second web-shooter on his wrist and drags his friends back out the classroom and down the hallway.
‘Shh,’ she soothes him, one hand reaching up to stroke through his hair. ‘We got him out, Pete. He’s back at the facility in the med wing. He’s-’ her voice catches a little and he can’t help the fear that courses through him, ‘he’s not in a good way, Pete; but the doctors think he’ll recover.’
Nakia joins them. ‘We are taking you all to the Wakandan Embassy,’ she explains, ‘we’ve sent people to collect your belongings from your hotel rooms. You’ll be safer there and, I imagine, be better able to relax knowing you are among friends and are well guarded.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Wow nearly at the end of this story; I'll be really really interested to hear what you all think about this chapter and where you think this next series is going to go. This was my answer to my own question of: how can I make the Deadpool films fit into the MCU with no X-Men around. It also then gave me ideas for where to go with some of the future instalments - which are also starting to give me headaches with the planning!
‘I know,’ the king smiles in reassurance as the team trek past them, having already said their goodbyes, putting their bags into the Quinjet. ‘Take care of yourself, Tony.’
‘Oh Thanos!’ I manage to sing-song, waving at him with the gauntlet. ‘Yeah so I thought Cable was butt-ugly but you really take the prize. How about I see you in hell, motherfucker?’
‘Exactly. You landed a fair few hits on me, kid, but there was barely any of your strength behind it.
‘Get in line,’ Steve growls, coming up to them after having thrown another inmate into a cell and slamming the door shut.
‘Anything you want to talk about, kid?’ Peter shakes his head and hears Tony sigh. ‘Alright. Go put your stuff in your room, then come and do some of your homework before dinner. Nat’s on cooking duty tonight.’
‘Flattery won’t work on me son,’ she says, ‘now come here where I can see you properly.’ She puts a hand either side of his face and pulls him down to her eye level. ‘Hmm,’ she says, taking in every aspect of his face.
seen or heard of their whereabouts is Spider-Man,’ he ticks off another. ‘The clues all point to Wade actually being Deadpool, who we’ve been introduced to as Peter’s boyfriend and there’s all the rumours that Spider-Man and Deadpool are dating which,’ he turns to Peter, ‘by the way there are so many questions I have about that.’ He turns back to Betty. ‘Not to mention that would explain why he spends so much time with the Avengers, and why they’ve been finding ways so far today to keep him away from the school where he can’t accidentally reveal who he is. And most importantly,’ he points to Ned and MJ, ‘neither of them are surprised.’
‘Could be in a theme park,’ Wade suggests. ‘What? They could!’ He adds at everyone’s questioning looks.
compared to what he was like now. Though he has a feeling it’s affected by the fact they still have no news from Wade.
The team are reunited after the separate attacks, and are offered sanctuary while they attempt to regroup.
Steve stands facing him, hands clenched into fists at his side and tries desperately to withhold the urge to smash his face in. He catches Sam’s eye and the other man shakes his head minutely. ‘
‘We’re soldiers, Tony,’ Bucky answers for them both, ‘we’re used to following orders and keeping our mouths shut.’
Gamora smiles at her wryly. ‘Thanks. But what’s this of Nova being destroyed? We were the ones to defeat Ronan and give the Power stone to them to keep safe, we hadn’t heard anything about them being attacked.’
‘Alright Ross send over all the information you have we’ll review it on the way over,’ he says, standing up.
‘I might not,’ Tony huffs, ‘but Steve should. If not we’ll raid someone else’s wardrobe. Now get in here so we can find you something and I actually have time to get ready myself.’
‘Not exactly, not the way it is in the story at any rate. We’d been sent to do some task for Odin and it ended up being a trap. As we were attempting to escape Sif’s hair, which at the time was long and braided like the majority of Asgardian women, got trapped; there was no time to try and free it as our enemies were closing down on us so I simply used a dagger to cut it free and we left. She was not amused and suffered many weeks of teasing from the other warriors at the state of her hair, but at least she was alive. Thor at least came and thanked me for the quick thinking that saved her life, but Sif was too proud to say it herself. Although for a time she was a little less hostile towards me, so I suppose that was thanks enough in itself.’
‘I’ve only just got him to stop keeping a gun under the pillow,’ Peter adds. ‘His hand print is in the system. He’s cut off his hand, ripped his shirt to form a rope, slipped the severed hand through the window and swung it until it hits the sensor and it’s opened the door.’
Tony soaks in every second of the car ride as he drives Peter to school ready for his trip to Europe. They talk about the different places the group are going to visit, and he suggests some places that Peter and his friends should check out if they get chance.
‘You’re older than me, you idiot,’ Steve retorts, against the laughter from the class. ‘Now we drop down, and make sure you’re out of the way of each other. It’s not fun when someone lands on you, especially when they weigh a ton like a certain James Buchanan Barnes.’ Steve jumps down and looks up at Peter and holds his hands up, gesturing he’ll catch him.
‘How’s the support group going?’ she asks, and they spend the majority of the run bouncing around ideas for his support group and how he might be able to expand it. Sam’s often wondered why Natasha doesn’t come and run some of the sessions with him, or even start her own group, but she always waves off the suggestion whenever he brings it up; he supposes she has such a good understanding of people because, in her profession, she has to know how their minds work, and it provides valuable insights for him. He often wonders if it’s a lack of confidence in herself that stops her from doing more.
‘You want me to do what?’ he blinks at Steve, trying to work out how long he’ll be spending in the medical wing after this.
Waving goodbye to Ned as Mr Stark climbs into the driver’s seat, Peter makes his way to the other side of the car and climbs in the passenger seat, pushing his bags through the gap into the back. Without caring about the large numbers of people around them Mr Stark speeds off, Peter only just able to secure his seatbelt by the time they reach the end of the road.
‘Make sure everyone in the grounded one is out of the fight,’ he tells him. ‘I’ve got this covered.’
‘Aww, Natasha said something nice about me!’ Tony’s voice comes through from where he’s sat back at the Wakandan Embassy in Vienna.
He sighs and lays on his back, one arm behind his head and the other drumming a beat on the reactor with his fingers. ‘I guess, with everything that happened before, I was worried how some of the team would react.’
Thank you so much to everyone who has been leaving comments and kudos. Please do let me know what you think of the story so far.
be good enough for you in my book, he’s as close as you’re going to get. Besides,’ he shrugs and releases Peter’s shoulders, a small smile at the boy’s shocked expression, ‘if his first instinct to protect you from
,’ he groans as they fight their way through the crowds in the corridor to the entrance. ‘Can we not do this at school?’
‘How about I make us banana splits?’ he suggests. ‘Then we can find a way to put hair dye in Bucky’s shampoo so it dyes his hair orange.’
And then Thanos catches Thor with his sword and sends him spiralling into the ground, knocking the god senseless. Steve tries to go to his friend’s help but Thanos’ sword turns on him, he brings up the shield to stop the attack and has a heart-stopping moment when the sword pierces the vibranium with ease, stopping just short of his face. He’s so shocked that it takes a few moments of Thanos pounding on the shield, leaving it split in half, before he’s able to scramble out of the way.
‘Kid where are you getting your energy from?’ Sam asks. ‘Oh no, no hot chocolate for you!’ He swipes the mug out of the teenager’s reach.
‘I’ll have someone here within the hour. You,’ Wong turns to Strange, ‘are to look after yourself for once. Do you understand me?’
He manages to pay attention just in time to see the ball come hurtling towards his face, this time directed from Natasha’s kick. He sends a repulsor blast at it and it goes flying to the right; Bucky quickly takes off in pursuit, Sam close on his heels. The metal-armed man is the first one to reach it, but it goes sailing into the air again, courtesy of Wanda, and makes its way back towards the rest of the field.
‘How nice of you to bring a friend,’ she continues, gesturing to Strange. ‘Or is he a sacrificial offering to get back on my good side? I mean he’s powerful enough for me to forgive you. For now.’
The leader shrugs. ‘Well if he really doesn’t mean anything, then he’s not of any use to me,’ he holds the gun a little straighter and turns to Peter. ‘Any last words, kid?’
‘So have you if you understood it,’ Sam counters. ‘What is it with you? Why won’t you try? You didn’t properly try with Tony, otherwise there’s every chance he
‘He makes a very sound argument,’ Strange points out, ‘why not start it after midnight? That way everyone can join in the rest of the party before. It’s only a few hours.’
‘It’s not about being productive,’ Peter’s head appears above them, and Tony’s heart does a little lurch in fright before his brain catches up and reminds him the kid can stick to ceilings and will not fall. ‘It’s about taking time to appreciate those around you and making time for family and friends that you wouldn’t normally see during the year.’
The children nod and climb back under their covers; Tony runs his fingers through Peter’s hair soothingly, and Steve does the same for Morgan. ‘Are there monsters in it?’ she asks.
‘He punched the guy’s face in,’ Ned’s voice is shaky, and the acrid smell of vomit reaches Peter’s nose. ‘Dude that’s messed up.’
‘Wong is staying at the Sanctum whilst I am gone,’ Strange ignores Sam’s comment. ‘If there is anything you need he shall be there to assist. How happy he shall be about it remains to be seen. Are those of you who wish to go to Norway ready to accompany me?’
‘It helps us to see where the scar tissue is and what can be repaired and what cannot,’ Vision explains. ‘When we tested it with Tony we were able to see which parts of his psyche could be healed and which were damaged beyond repair.’
‘I wouldn’t be surprised if she still doesn’t,’ Tony laughs, ‘plus we need to work out how we’re going to decorate that monstrosity Bucky won.’
‘And why he’d need protection,’ Natasha adds. At a few questioning glances she elaborates. ‘Who else do you think could have picked him up if not us?’
‘Wall crawling abilities,’ the teen responds as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. ‘So can someone like try and take this thing down? I mean I’ve got it distracted so it’s not going to go through the army. Man where’s Wade when you actually
There’s a ring of agreement from the children and, as they steadily make their way through their meal, the children ask Loki for more and more elaborate ice shapes. Eventually Wanda and Strange each help  him with shaping the ice and making the shapes come to life so that, by the end of the meal, there’s a veritable zoo running between plates and serving dishes.
‘You never cease to amaze me you know that?’ the love in his blue eyes makes Tony a little dizzy, so he just kisses him in response. ‘Now I think it’s time for your present,’ Steve grins, sitting up again and reaching over to his bedside table to pull a box from his drawer.
Loki gives him a small smile. ‘Perhaps it has indeed,’ he agrees. ‘Nevertheless I shall be here when you return.’
‘Yeah, we’re all here Nat. Me, Bruce, Tony and Rhodey. How’s everyone this side?’ his tone is still soft, as if speaking to a frightened animal. She gives herself a shake and, taking a deep breath, pulls herself together.
‘Good morning, Sergeant Barnes, how are you feeling this morning?’ The nurse is far too cheerful and it makes Bucky grind his teeth to bite back on his annoyance; he knows she’s only doing her job but it’s the exceptionally cheery tone that he can’t stand.
‘I am the monster that we used to get told stories of as children,’ the red eyes are challenging as they look back at him, ‘so forgive me for not believing you.’
‘Loki?’ her voice is small and he can feel tears trailing down from his eyes to stop at her fingertips.
‘So this is mine,’ Peter points to the door as they walk past, ‘and Ned and MJ are usually in these two.’
Peter winks at Wade then downs the bottle; the mercenary’s eyes go wide. When he finishes he wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and shrugs. ‘Never specified which half.’
‘You want us to just bring back your decapitated head?’ Natasha asks deadpanned, one eyebrow raised. Then she shrugs. ‘Suppose it’s not the most outlandish thing anyone’s ever asked me to do.’
Ross’ voice continues the sequence that Tony is surprised hasn’t made its way into his own nightmares yet. He hears a grunt of pain from Bucky through the link.
If anyone needed proof that Tony Stark has a heart, he could have given them both halves with those words. Knowing he’s probably going to be in big trouble with May for doing it, he knocks on the door briefly then steps into the room without waiting for an invitation. He sees the kid sitting on the bed with May’s arm around his shoulders.
‘It felt like Stane all over again,’ Sam nods in understanding. ‘Tony, how did you even manage to contemplate bringing him back? And helping Bucky?’
‘Wade Wilson,’ Bucky is the first to catch sight of them and Peter feels his stomach plummeting to his feet. ‘Long time no see. Last I saw you was in Brazil if I remember correctly. Nearly cost me my other arm.’
‘Heads up Valkyrie!’ Sam shouts, a bottle of beer arcing over the top of their heads to be catch by the woman’s lightning reflexes. She twists the cap off and raises it in a toast before downing it in nearly one.
‘Wait!’ Deadpool grabs hold of his arm before he can shoot one. He hurriedly lets go and stands back, hands up. ‘Just hear me out before you run off.’
‘You stole my line!’ the captain whines at Tony, then takes off down the field. Again scarlet light curls around the ball and Sam finds it back at his feet ready to fire it in past Tony.
Loki brings his own knife up to block Bucky’s, grabbing hold of the other wrist to hold him at bay. ‘I am Loki, son of Odin,’ he responds, ‘I am King of Jotunheim, and a prince of Asgard. You know me, for you have seen into my mind.’
He leaves her to think over his words as he joins the others, a couple of tears threatening to fall.
Rhodes laughs. ‘I can imagine trying to do that with a younger Tony, as entertaining as it would be it’d also be one hell of a headache.’
‘That and Howard would have killed you if you’d left an illegitimate child running around,’ Rhodes adds.
She laughs and waves him off. ‘Just doing my job. I’ll return to my patient for now and assign two of our most discreet nurses to him.’
Peter enters the restaurant and looks around the few occupants. At the back he sees a very familiar looking profile, hunched over with a hood drawn up. Trying his best to ignore the butterflies currently taking residence in his stomach, Peter makes his way to the back and takes a seat opposite, smiling at the tacos on the table top.
‘Let’s go get our friend, shall we? We’ll leave Wilson here to think about what he’s done,’ Francis cackles.
‘Too busy thinking of what story to make up about what the Avengers had you doing next were you?’ Flash sneers.
‘Fury’s been told,’ Natasha responds, ‘he’s on his way to the facility now. And you’re right we do need to work out who’s coming and who’s staying. Someone needs to be here to stay in contact with Wanda and Vision, be ready for when Wade gets back and to make sure we can deal with Ross if needed.’
‘And another one down and another one down, another one bites the dust!’ Wade rushes past them both, singing and firing as he goes.
‘Technically I won it, I didn’t buy it,’ he shouts after the boy’s retreating form. ‘Tony can you control your kid please?’
‘Stop it,’ Natasha nudges him, ‘can’t you see he’s already turning green? Don’t make him more nervous than he already is.’ She smiles at Steve. ‘Don’t worry I’ve read the speech. You’ll be fine.’
‘Who watches the twenty four hour news channel out of choice?’ he asks, flopping onto the sofa next to Natasha.
‘As soon as you’re ready,’ is the answer. ‘Is there anything you’d like to discuss about today Mr Stark?’
Unfortunately he doesn’t notice the person sneaking up behind him. ‘Work can wait, Tony’ Sam says from just behind him.
‘Don’t let Pete catch you calling him a baby genius,’ Tony laughs. ‘Steve?’ his voice sounds a little tentative.
‘You wanted to speak to me, Tony?’ Peter says, knocking on the door to the bedroom and easing it open.
left to go pick him and Hope up from the facility,’ Natasha replies, ‘you know there’s no way he’ll be back yet.’
‘Yeah, promise. I’ll tell you if anything does start getting serious,’ the teen is nodding so furiously that Tony’s worried his head might fly off. ‘Although I did have to ask you something kind of related to dating, but not
They sit down on some of the chairs to make it easier for Tony to unwrap his gift, and he pulls out a small box; when he finally reaches the contents he laughs and looks over at Natasha. ‘This can only be from her.’
‘Hey,’ Steve gathers their adopted daughter into his arms, pulling her onto his lap, ‘those monsters are never going to come and get you again, you hear me? You don’t have to worry about them.’
‘And if he’s got access to EDITH,’ Bruce adds, ‘he could make the illusions even more elaborate. Not to mention deadly.’
‘I don’t blame you for any of it, Steve,’ he tells him, voice quiet but steady. ‘Not any more. When you first left I was angry and hurt, but now I just want the team back to how it was.’
‘What makes you think I actually enjoyed any of them? I assume this question has come from you overhearing my discussion with Wanda, Vision and Peter at the table. I see not all of your spying abilities have deserted you.’
Thor opens his mouths to argue with his second in command but shuts it again at the withering look Valkyrie gives him. ‘I just don’t want you to feel that I’m abandoning-’
What it has done, though, is keep them up dancing which they haven’t really done before on New Year, and even Rhodey has let FRIDAY take over as DJ and joined everyone on the dance floor.
‘Sergeant Barnes!’ Belinda scolds him. ‘Mr Stark I am so sorry for his rudeness I’m afraid it’s due to the-’
Wade groans in frustration. ‘I know, Cap, I know it’s just…if I’m wrong I’ll have just been a paranoid bastard about it and made a fuss over nothing.’
Ross lets out a sound that’s somewhere between a snarl and a scream. ‘One day, Stark. One day I’ll wipe that smug look off of your face.’
‘Maybe Steve could go back to doing shows,’ Bucky suggests, laughing as the blond throws a cushion at his head.
‘You want to give the King of Wakanda a knitted sweater you be my guest. I reserve the right to film the interaction,’ Tony smirks.
‘Sorry I’m taking the elevator down,’ he says, flipping backwards out of the window and sending a web up to catch himself as he swings in to send one of the men flying, and knocks the gun out of the other man’s hand. ‘Come on, move it!’ he says to the students, ushering them forwards. ‘I’ll cover you, but you need to get off the school grounds.’
is putting him off during this presentation. He’s already nervous as hell and doesn’t need any of you making it worse.’
‘They’ll probably need as much cleaning as this room, but there’ll be somewhere we can crash for tonight. We’ll set to work on sorting out something more lasting in the morning,’ he replies. ‘Come on I’ll show you all where to go.’
‘Maybe,’ he sighs and looks down, ‘or maybe HYDRA did more to me than any of us are willing to accept. I just…I wanted him to stop saying those things and I ended up turning into the thing I was trying to argue I wasn’t.’
‘Clear,’ Steve steps into the room, continuing to cast his gaze around as he heads towards the desk covered in equipment on the far side. ‘Nat you might want to make your way in here?’
‘Comforting,’ Tony rolls his eyes, ‘good thing you were a brain surgeon and not a shrink or you’d have been shit at your job.’ He sighs. ‘Avengers? We need to collect the stones. I’ve got the Mind Stone on my gauntlet. Anyone else got eyes on a stone?’
having this discussion,’ comes the firm reply. ‘I’m not letting Tony anywhere near something resembling work until he is out of the hospital wing, is that understood?’
‘Look Nat is good at reading people, alright. And I’ve spent way too long with you to not be able to read you too. Whether you like or not you are one of my best mates on this team. I just want to know why you don’t think you deserve to be as happy as the others.’
Tony smirks. ‘I’ve never trusted you, Ross. I made sure the others were always covered any time they left the facility so you couldn’t try and pull anything on them. Trust issues a mile wide, that’s one of my failings I’m afraid. So every time I step outside the facility I’ve had FRIDAY record every second of it. Including today.’
‘Pretty sure I took that off after we beat, Thanos,’ Tony muses. ‘FRIDAY? Why have Strange’s calls not been getting through?’
Peter tries to speak around his mouthful of sandwich, but it doesn’t even make sense to him. He swallows and repeats. ‘Didn’t get chance to eat anything before I came down and I’m starving.’
The teenager launches himself at the man and gives him a hug. ‘Thank you so much. I won’t let you down I promise.’
‘Oh shut it,’ he shoves her through the door, a small smile betraying him. The bar is busy but Peter still recognises some of the faces from the last time he was here; he directs Wanda to the bar and gives Weasel a small smile as the man raises an eyebrow at him.
‘Of course,’ the chirpy voice says and Steve suspects the AI is happy someone is making Tony look after himself.
Sharon Carter arrives at the facility and there's a revelation in the relationship between Tony and Peggy Carter.
The nurse sniffs, not looking up from her computer screen. ‘Sergeant Barnes got taken up to one of the private suites.’
‘Yeah Tony was having kittens,’ Natasha says, a small smile on her lips. ‘He was halfway to the suit before we heard the situation was resolved; then Steve had to forcibly remove his phone to stop him from calling you and giving you the Spanish Inquisition over what happened. Rhodey threatened to knock him out if he didn’t sit down. We’ve been teasing him about it ever since.’
That’s probably why he misses the foot in the small of his back that sends him sprawling to the ground. Reacting on instinct yet again he springs from his hands and flips over into a crouch, waiting for his opponent to make their next move.
Steve nods and takes off out of sight. By the time they catch up with them in the foyer Peter has Wanda locked in a tight hug, and Tony is slightly worried the girl’s bones are going to snap.
‘Oh don’t worry I’m pretty sure Mr Stark had FRIDAY record it,’ Peter grumbles, earning himself a hair ruffle from his mentor.
Wanda laughs as she lets go of him. ‘I didn’t get to say thank you for saving my life last time we met,’ she explains.
Wanda lifts her hand, wiggling her fingers with a smile as red light dances around her finger tips. ‘Leave that to me.’
‘Ok so why don’t we get all your people settled into rooms?’ Tony suggests to Thor. ‘Wanda, Vis? Can you two get them all settled into rooms on the guest level? Keep them all in the east wing of the compound, it attracts the least amount of attention. We’ll meet you in the common area when you’re done. Have FRIDAY get some food ordered in and delivered to the guest common area and they can eat and drink while we work out what the hell is going on.’
‘No my father was American and I was brought up there, but when he died my mother returned to our tribe where I have lived ever since. On her death I was appointed leader,’ Ororo replies. ‘If I hadn’t inherited her powers I would not have been given it, and I’ve had a lot of work to earn the trust of some of the older members of the tribe.’
Taking that as good enough for now he stands and stretches, taking his empty glass to the sink. ‘Well that’s enough serious talk for one night. For one
‘Tony,’ the quiet voice of Vision next to him has him turn around. The humanoid simply shakes his head and Tony pauses, feeling some of the red haze falling from his mind.
‘But why can’t I use the suit’s interface? That’s what I’d do if I got caught someone pitch black. And I can see in near-perfect darkness anyway.’
‘No, May,’ Peter sighs, ‘I was sober again within a few hours, and my headache went around lunchtime. If I feel unwell at any point I shall call you. Now go enjoy yourself!’
Nebula shoots her a glare and she thinks the other woman is not going to answer her question and instead stab her with her fork. Thankfully she just blinks and then turns thoughtful. ‘I had not…I had not really thought about it. I suppose that
Bucky nods and relays the message, then smirks. ‘He says try not to turn into a Capsicle again before we get out of here.’ Steve rolls his eyes, but feels some of his panic ease at the knowledge that Tony’s humour is still intact so he’s most likely alright. ‘He says he’s looked up the maps that were sent over by Magnusson and we should be able to follow the two tunnels and meet up eventually. They haven’t seen any sign of the Jotuns so we’re hoping they’re buried under the ice. Might take a while before we meet up but we should manage it. There’s another chamber further along, we’ll aim to meet there. This is all fairly unknown though, aside from the basic outline. They apparently mapped out the system and then have gone back to the front and started excavating from there.’
‘I swear you start apologising and I’m banning you from touching any and every bottle of alcohol in this facility.
‘He’s not your patient. As of now Sergeant Barnes is being transferred to the side room that is usually set aside for my use, and he will be treated by my personal physician. His care is no longer your concern. Now get the hell out.’
Steve bursts out laughing and pulls him down into a hug. ‘Don’t worry, babe your secret is safe with me. I was looking for a good hiding place for your Christmas present and found them.’
Tony notices Peter’s made sure he’s sat next to Rhodes, someone he’s already familiar with, and Bucky has sat himself on the kid’s other side by dragging a chair over.
Tony stops fiddling as he ponders the question. It’s something Pepper had asked him before. Well screamed at him during their last big fight before they agreed to stop trying to make something work that was obviously never going to happen. He puts the pieces down and subconsciously rubs at his chest where the reactor once sat.
‘Touché,’ he chuckles. ‘I promise these are only filled with a new harmless powder. I made it after our last mishap so that it’s easy to see the effectiveness whilst we test them.’
The three of them walk along the tarmac to join Vision and then they make their way to the car. Rhodes and Bucky sit in the back, while Vision rides shotgun with Tony. As he turns the key in the ignition he looks in the rear view mirror. ‘For the love of all things holy, Rhodey, get those damn things off of him.’
‘Not a lot,’ he decides to admit the truth, ‘Steve’s been having nightmares and I don’t want him sneaking off to deal on his own.’
‘That is what I intend to find out,’ Tony’s expression is hard, ‘though I have my suspicions it’s around trying to get my focus back on weapons development, and if I still argue, to get me locked out and someone else take over the running of the company.’
So although the training room isn’t Tony’s favourite part of the facility, it’s not his least favourite either. That’s definitely the medical wing.
Bucky can feel the trickster nudging at the barriers in his mind so, with a sigh, he lets them fall enough for the other to push through. It’s a strange sensation, knowing there is no barrier between what he is thinking and feeling and Loki, but the same is also true of the other.
‘Fine,’ Bucky rolls his eyes, ‘like we would anyway. Not when it’s something this important to him.’
‘We’re supposed to do what now?’ Wade asks, looking at the block of clay that’s just been thrust into his hands.
‘Tony are you alright?’ Peter frowns as he watches the inventor walk to the kitchenette. ‘You’re walking funny.’
So Steve explains the invitation to the party, and sneaking over there whilst the rest of the team were inside, and meeting Tony outside. ‘He said he was just Tony from R&D. Why?’
Tony groans as the channel lands on a daytime chat show, the title at the bottom reads: ‘Does Tony Stark have a long lost son?’ The entire team turning up to watch Peter’s presentation has sparked a myriad of theories, ranging from the one he is currently watching, to people thinking he’s grooming the boy to become the next Iron Man.
‘Well it’s rather simple really. Everyone has to catch everyone else under the mistletoe at least once over the holiday,’ the old woman says, cackling a little at some of the wide-eyed expressions she receives.
‘Because some of us have learnt restraint,’ Natasha rolls her eyes and pops another sushi roll into her mouth.
Loki sighs and nods. ‘It…I honestly can’t remember what started it. The three of us were talking normally and then a comment was made by someone that I let a stray thought about slip through the link. Barnes then responded to it and before I knew what was happening we were trading insults through the link and,’ he pauses and looks down at the glass in his hands, ‘we weren’t being as careful as we should have been and were picking up on hints through the link on what could hurt the other. I…I made some references to his time with HYDRA and he…he made some references to my past as well.’
‘Which means you’ve thought about it,’ Bruce sighs in a way that is as long-suffering as any sigh Pepper ever gave him.
‘I can be a quick study when I choose,’ Loki answers, still looking through the scans. Eventually he sighs and minimises the scans. ‘I am afraid I do not have the ability to fully heal you, Doctor, however I believe I will be able to do enough to strengthen your hands enough for you to do some more activities and remove some of the pain. You are in constant pain from them I believe?’
‘Wouldn’t dream of it,’ is his soft reply, and he stretches out his arm along the back of the seat, his fingers just brushing the hair at the top of Tony’s neck. The other man says nothing, simply leans his head back and closes his eyes.
say a word. Got it?’ Peter hesitates and the man adds, ‘one wrong move and I‘ll set that vest off taking Tony Stark with you.’
hating himself for his self-imposed no-touch rule in their budding relationship. When play passes back to him he passes closer to Peter than necessary and growls. ‘Want to explain what the
‘Oh shit-’ Bucky curses looking up at the alien standing over him. He doesn’t have time to react, no time to move since he’s winded.
‘Great! I’ll arrange for a car to pick you up,’ Peter grins, ‘and I’ll send you all the information on text.’
expression, the one usually reserved for Peter these days. ‘I’ve noticed the way you look at Peter. You care about him as more than a friend.’
When they’re settling down for the movie later Peter finds himself taking the seat next to Natasha instead of his usual spot on the floor next to Tony. Bucky just settles down on the floor next to Sam without a word and Peter can’t help but curl up against the red-haired assassin. After his outburst earlier he kind of misses when he and May would curl up to watch films, usually when he was missing his parents when they were on one of their business trips and Uncle Ben was out working.
The god lets his book fall into this lap and looks around the room as if he still doesn’t believe him; once he’s satisfied they are in fact the only people here he turns back to him and leans back in the chair, one hand resting against his mouth. ‘Very well, proceed with your request Winter Warrior, though don’t expect me to say yes.’
‘Well first off I’m Canadian, so no I’m not from America,’ Wade smirks. ‘And yes I’m from Earth but I’m not from
As soon as he’s out of the room Steve turns to Wanda. ‘Ok tell us everything you know about this girl Peter is seeing.’
‘Nothing I can see, Cap. And considering there’s a whole lot of open farmland here, that means there’s nothing to see.’
‘Apparently so. Or at least tonight they are,’ Peter sighs. ‘Even Karen can only pick up domestic call outs on the police scanners, and my spidey senses are saying everything is boring.’
Peter tries to push down the nervous feeling in his gut, gripping Wade’s hand tightly, as they climb out of the car and head inside. They’re greeted as soon as they walk through the door and shown up three flights of stairs to where the team has, apparently, taken residence on the entire floor. The Wakandan salutes and smiles before leaving them outside of the door.
‘Yeah but you love them,’ he laughs, gesturing at the four tickets he’d bought, renting out a racetrack for the day. ‘And you know this is
‘They grow on you eventually,’ she explains to Nebula, who is watching the interaction with interest, ‘but it drives you insane along the way.’
‘I can’t die, Tin Can. This…this is killing you already. Give me the gauntlet with the stones, let me do it. Don’t be a fucking glory seeking, self-sacrificing asshat.’
‘Oh yeah, damn trash panda is getting turned into a hat by the time I’m done with him,’ Quill grumbles, then yelps as he falls to the ground, landing in a heap at Steve’s feet. ‘Don’t mind my head, it’s fine.’
So douchebag that writes this stuff is saying she wants to take a break from this series for a little bit and wants to do something different. I know right? Stopping me and my Baby Boy being together, it’s fucking sacrilege! And I don’t care if she says there’ll be more it won’t the same and- HEY! WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU’RE-
‘So every one of you bastards has one of those things on then?’ Tony asks, relieved when he spots tendrils of red light creeping around the straps on the front of Peter’s vest. ‘And the others are supposed to set theirs off if yours goes off am I right?’
Peter looks out towards the giant Christmas tree Bucky had won a couple of weeks ago, leaning half on the rail and half into Wade’s warmth. ‘I’m just… I’m just surprised that you’d want me I guess. I mean I’m still a kid, and apart from getting bitten by a radioactive spider there’s nothing that special about me. Even that was special in a whole different way; like stupid kind of special. I’m just the geeky kid that gets picked on at school, then spends my evenings swinging around the city pretending to be a superhero.’
‘It looks like one of the husky breeds,’ Tony adds, ‘they’re used to pull sleds in places like Alaska. They’re one of the hardier breeds.’
‘Uh, yeah sure,’ Steve says, turning and leaving the kitchen. His mind is racing, and he’s trying to work out just what it is that’s causing it. It’s only after he’s passed Rhodes and Sam talking on their way to the kitchen and Wanda tells him she’ll get Vision that he realises how domestic the whole situation is.
‘Unbelievable,’ Peter mutters, dropping the shopping bags he’s carrying onto the floor. Loki follows suit and not long later Matt comes back out in his Daredevil costume.
Strangely enough that doesn’t make him feel better; as they walk out the front of the facility Peter catches sight of a suited Wade and waves goodbye to Dopinder as he drives off.
‘Well, well, nice of you two to finally show your faces,’ Brock grumbles when they enter the room and find the rest of the squad there. ‘Now you’ve been free from hospital for two weeks it’s like we see you even less, Barnes.’
Steve fidgets in his tux, feeling like this is possibly the worst night of his life. He’s already stood and greeted more people than he’s possibly ever met in his life, and now they’re waiting around for the speeches and the charity dance.
‘Does he ever stop?’ Scott asks Tony, getting a laugh from the three men as Peter goes bright red and mumbles an apology.
There’s a pause on the other end. ‘They’ve already been agreed?’ Tony hates the suspicion in the other’s voice.
‘Come on,’ Steve moves his hand down to take hold of Tony’s, ‘we need to get you washed or you could end up worse than you already are.’
Tony holds Sam’s eye, seeing if he can get any clues from the other man’s expression. ‘What makes you say that?’
‘I’ll warn you, Steve,’ Pepper sighs as he walks towards Tony’s office, ‘he’s in a particularly difficult mood today.’
‘Just… you’ll see,’ Steve says, not very good at lying. ‘Now go on, hurry up or dinner’ll be cold by the time you’re done.’
this kid is Spiderman, he’d be very worried. Just right now though he looks like a kid whose been taken hostage and is still trying to process everything. And again, if Tony didn’t know this kid is Spiderman and what he’s been through in the past, he’d assume that’s all it is.
He barely has the energy to struggle against the immovable grip at his neck. He sees Wanda, watching the fight impassively.
‘Neither,’ he responds to his assistant. ‘Ajax can continue with his studies for now, he has already done well to bring an additional ally or two from alternate realities, despite this latest setback; I’m hoping he will provide us with better results if we allow him some time and space. By the end of this next stage of our plan, he will need to produce better results, or else I shall be visiting him personally.’
‘Please remember to breathe,’ Strange interrupts with a raised eyebrow, ‘I dread to think what the Black Widow would do to me should you run out of air and collapse in my library.’
‘He’s the reason we’re alive,’ the scientist explains, ‘please, we need to help him. If for no other reason than he knows our enemy better than any of us.’
‘Oh?’ Tony’s eyebrows raise into his hair. ‘Failed to mention that before. I’m guessing you’re bi then seeing as you took that girl to Homecoming.’
Tony grumbles as the ringing cuts through his dream, and rolls over to see who would be calling at some ungodly hour of the night, and then throw the phone across the room.
‘Yeah he has that amazing ability to either make everyone shout at him or stun them into silence,’ Peter laughs, unclenching his fists and sitting back down on the floor to return to his unfinished model.
‘Agreed,’ Fury says, ‘and I don’t think it would be a good idea for it to be with the Power stone either.’
‘Rise, my people,’ Loki says out loud, cutting off the chatter amongst the team. ‘I am aware I am not the king you would have chosen, however I am prepared to strive to be a king you deserve, if you will allow me to.’
‘Who’s that?’ the warrior asks as he takes a seat on the bed next to him, pointing at the ice figure in his hand.
He’s pretty sure his AI just sighed, but he can’t be certain. He enters the warehouse, seeing it open straight into a large space. At its centre are a group of people, Wanda being one of them. It seems that she’s reporting back to her handlers.
‘Nice to see you again, Captain,’ Zemo says, climbing over the rubble behind Bucky. ‘I see you found my father’s old farmhouse. It served its purpose. Much like your friend here.’
‘Merry Christmas, Steve. Merry Christmas Tony!’ Peter says again, bouncing on the bottom of the bed. ‘Come on get up! Wanda and Vision are already up making hot drinks for everyone. They sent me off to get everyone up.’
The next few days is a flurry of activity and Sam is positive he’s never known the team this busy outside of a world ending crisis. Strange had been over a couple of times but has been called to Kamar-Taj to help with a situation, and Sam is surprised to say that they were actually disappointed the doctor couldn’t join them for more of the preparations; he has promised to be back in time for Yule, however, and to bring Wong with him. Despite himself Sam is looking forwards to seeing the stoic man again.
to. You’re one of my best friends, Tony, and I’d like to think I know you pretty well too. But that means we also know how to push each other’s buttons, so when we start having a small disagreement it just spirals.’
‘Your protégé and apparently adopted son has started ghosting me, Stark, right at the start of a potentially volatile situation I need his help in. Any comment to make?’ Fury demands.
Peter shrugs. ‘I’m used to having to do it at school so it’s not so hard. It’s harder here because I don’t have to worry usually, so I’m freaking even more that I’m going to slip up.’
‘Tony!’ Steve shouts as he drops the faceplate and launches himself along the corridors towards the office door.
The look Ned gives him tells him exactly how much he believes that. ‘Yeah completely one sided. Which is why you’re sticking up for him this much.’
‘We’ve got a situation,’ Tony replies. ‘Kid stay here and tell the others to wait here for briefing. Cap? Come with me, we’ll go get the situation from Ross. Bucky, Nat? Go round up the others.’
‘You still with me, Tony? Afghanistan was ten years ago, now. Do you remember making Yinsinium? Changing the arc reactor?’ At those words he panics, looking down at his chest and trying to get his arms free from Steve. Natasha takes his face in her hands again and gets him to look into her green eyes. ‘Tony the arc reactor’s gone. You healed yourself remember? It’s not in your chest anymore, you don’t need it. You’re safe. You’re with us, at the facility.’
‘It’s the man in the big red suit,’ comes an irritated voice from the other side. ‘I’m here about our mutual friend, Deadpool.’
Wanda looks terrified at the two of them. ‘Wanda I’ll get you there,’ Tony says, going to take hold of the girl.
‘Why not? Come on Steve don’t leave me with the old grannies all by myself,’ he says, grabbing a towel from the side and trying to clean up his hands.
‘Not for long enough apparently,’ there’s a small answering smile on the soldier’s lips as he leans back down.
‘You seem to think it likely someone will be able to get you to fight each other,’ Frau Leibner comments. ‘What makes you so sure this is going to happen?’
Tony leads Strange to the kitchenette where they can sit on the stools and work on their batch of decorations, Sam joins them while Steve goes to keep an eye on Bucky and Peter.
he chuckles to himself and begins to survey the surrounding group, already planning how he is going to catch each one.
‘Alright kids I need you to get out of here. Find a classroom, barricade the door and hide under some desks until the situation is under control, alright?’ Deadpool says, coming up and kneeling down to check on the man. ‘He’ll be fine, he’s just injured.’
‘I’m sure there are a number of things you would rather be doing than sitting in my lesson, however-’
‘It appears you have,’ Vision responds, eyeing the god’s dark blue skin tone and gleaming red eyes. ‘Are you prepared to experiment with your powers?’
‘Of course, sir,’ the assistant makes sure to note down his exact words. ‘And our friends in the East? Shall I send them any message?’
‘I wonder why,’ an eye roll this time. ‘Yes that’s all of them. Unless someone wants to invite someone they haven’t mentioned yet.’
Thank you to those of you who have already commented I hope you enjoy this chapter as well and I will get around to replying to your comments soon I promise. Do let me know what you think about where this story is heading! Do you think they can pull it all off? I'll give you a clue: not everything will be resolved by the end of this story, this is going to take some of the series to get through.
Rumlow looks the most smug Steve has ever seen him. ‘It would be our pleasure, Mister Stark. What exactly would you need us to do?’
‘It starts at seven,’ Sam tells him, putting a piece of paper on his desk as he stands up to leave, ‘this is the address. I’ll try and keep Brock as busy as possible. Good luck.’
‘I love it,’ he says, ‘thank you.’ She squeezes him back and when he pulls away he can see unshed tears in her eyes. Wanda gives him another smile and then leaves him in the hands of Aunt May.
‘It’s just Sam,’ the man chuckles, ‘I assume you’re the infamous Ned that Peter keeps talking about?’
‘Tony gave it me after we had a heart to heart and made me promise to come down and talk to him rather than considering other options,’ he whispers back as they approach the motionless form of the inventor.
‘Yes Cap… yes Steve?’ Steve smiles at the teen, who is still desperately trying to remember the first names rule.
‘Just…try to keep the noise levels down,’ Bruce sighs. ‘And don’t get him too worked up, he’s in pretty bad shape, Steve.’
Peter is in a bad mood all day. He can’t focus properly in lessons and gets pulled up by the teachers a couple of times each lesson, meaning he’s on the edge of getting a detention. He’s short with his friends, and by the end of the day even Ned isn’t trying to engage him in conversation. They say goodbye on the steps with MJ telling him to ‘lighten up’ before tomorrow or she’ll kick his ass.
Tony chuckles, and Steve can’t help the answering smile. ‘I’ve never known two people get so excited about Christmas. I also didn’t realise how many Christmas films there actually were now, and not all of them are good.’
Especially when you train with one Tony Stark. Sam’s long learned that if he needs training to help him feel better then to grab Tony, they definitely don’t get as much useful training done as the others but they’ll both be doubled over in laughter by the end of half an hour. Rhodey’s a good partner to train with, though they tend to stick to boxing due to the other’s injuries; it’s a much more reflective training session, but no less fun.
‘Well…’ Peter waits until they’ve left the apartment before answering. ‘That may not be a good idea.’
‘Of course not,’ Sam grins, shaking his head. ‘We do seem to be picking up all kinds of waifs and strays as a team don’t we?’
‘Genuinely didn’t get to say anything before he took off,’ she laughs. ‘Come on, we need to get all of these boxes over to the common area.’
Tony feels his breath catch. The man has gone straight to the thing that’s causing him the most turmoil; even though the reactor has been changed to one of his own inventions, free of palladium and powered by Yinsinium, he still feels he’s being pumped full of poison. To have Steve touching it like it was something precious, especially since he’d had a nightmare last night of the shield sticking out of it, is confusing. ‘Proof that Tony Stark used to have a heart?’
‘Fifteen minutes. You and me in a room with him. I just want to ask him some questions of my own,’ he tries to reason with her. ‘I think I’m on to something here, I just need him to confirm it for me. The only person he might admit it to is
Peter’s jaw has fallen open, his eyes impossibly wide and he looks between Bucky and Tony. ‘How did you know about that?’
‘Hey Loki? Am I doing this right?’ Peter asks from the stove where he’s been put in charge of watching the syrup, it needs constant stirring and Loki has done more than his fair share of watching the syrup in the past.
‘Oh quit being a baby,’ Natasha laughs, ruffling Peter’s hair. ‘He’s not that bad when I train him. You just need to keep him focussed.’
‘Steve,’ Bucky turns serious again and puts a hand on his shoulder, ‘Tony is absolutely crazy about you; anyone with eyes can see that. The tension between the two of you is ridiculous, I’m surprised you’ve just been releasing it through arguments. I’d have got to the ripping the clothes off stage ages ago, but that’s just me.’
‘Oh, I love Led Zepplin!’ he hears himself say. Then Tony presses pause, looking at him with an expectant eyebrow.
‘Hands off my kid, Hammer,’ a metallic voice says from above them, and Peter feels himself relax slightly. Everyone has stopped around them to watch what’s happening.
Peter sits at the table, listening to the sounds of Natasha moving around the kitchen, Steve’s offered to help and is taking orders pretty well considering he’s more used to giving them.
‘Maybe you should have more faith in our mini genius over here,’ Steve laughs, ruffling Peter’s hair.
‘I find people talk better without weapons involved,’ he shrugs, walking past the adults to the fridge. ‘Anyone want a Coke?’
‘This is true. But my point still stands. All of this that happened? This is not because you are a terrible person, Tony, it’s because of other people’s greed.’
‘His phone is on the countertop,’ the female AI responds. All heads swivel to Natasha, who picks up the abandoned phone with a frown.
‘-it’s about knowing you can still be looking out for them if anything does happen to you,’ she puts a comforting hand on his knee. ‘I know, Tony. But you are eventually going to have to tell Peter, even if it’s just so he can prepare himself to take over SI. You know I’ll do everything to support him I can, but if it comes as a shock to both him
‘Alright, alright. Fucking hell you got your panties in a twist. Need some help getting the spandex out of that tight arse?’
‘The what protocol?’ he finishes making his coffee and leans back against the counter. This is possibly the longest conversation he’s had with this iteration of Tony’s AI, he’s only just gotten used to the fact that it’s not JARVIS anymore.
‘I think if we draft a good enough letter we’ll keep them on our side, but we’ll have to be careful not to shout too loud or they’ll start pulling on the leash.’
‘-hey don’t go all doubting on me now, Steve,’ he cuts him off. ‘Like you just said: we’re going to beat this son-of-a-bitch.’
Peter lets go of the breath he’s been holding and smiles at the older man. He pulls the books back towards them and turns to face his mentor. Over Tony’s shoulder he notices Steve’s soft smile before the man enters the kitchen again to help Natasha, and Peter’s attention is taken up with Tony’s explanations.
‘Yeah she did,’ Steve admits, looking a little sheepish. ‘But I thought trying to get you back to doing normal things would do more good than having a bored Tony Stark; and hopefully you can stop terrorising the doctors and nurses. Besides,’ he grins at Tony as he hands the tablet over, ‘I thought if anyone could hide a tablet from some nurses it’d be our resident genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.’
‘Probably,’ Sam laughs, ‘and she wouldn’t have done it if you hadn’t been boasting about your sniper skills.’
Wade tries to reassure Peter, and Steve and Bucky take the school out to one of the obstacle courses.
want to go back there when we’ve finished here, and got everyone else and now we’re here to help you guys fight Thanos and there are a
‘I was young and stupid,’ Thor mumbles, face red, ‘and I was jealous that mother had given you magic and said I didn’t have the patience for it.’
Quill lets out a sigh. ‘Alright yeah, it’s a lot to take in and process. It’s weird because I don’t have that many memories of Christmas as such, and I’m wondering if this is anything like what I used to do or not. Plus there’s kind of a bit of pressure on with the rest of the Guardians here and I’d be saying about how great Christmas is…’
is to wrap his own body around you, I think he can keep you safe when you’re fighting the bad guys together. Anyone who’s willing to protect you with their own life is good in my book.’
‘What’s the point in being a hero if you can’t save people?’ Peter asks, looking down at his hands again. This time Tony lets him.
‘There’s only one memory left to see before we’ve seen all my kills,’ Bucky mutters as he takes his seat in the chair. ‘Do you think it’s going to be enough to get rid of the mind control?’ he asks Vision as the humanoid comes to stand on his left.
Bruce gets down from the chair then frowns as he remembers Peter’s response. ‘Kid, what do you mean about Ultron?’
Clint grins at her. ‘You know I’m starting to think retirement doesn’t suit me. Think if I get the team to help do the porch Laura will let me come back?’
‘Valkyrie should be able to keep one stone safe for the time being,’ Thor says, ‘we should not need it to be for too long. Soon we shall reclaim our friends and vanquish our enemies, and enjoy revels to celebrate our victory once again.’
Someone lands between us, crouching down as they land, one arm extended behind them. Superhero landing!
Tony opens his mouth, obviously to tell the AI not to answer, but her voice cuts him off. ‘The boss has gone to bed three nights in the past week, Colonel.’
Steve has to admit it does smell good and he’s wondering why Rhodes is making such a fuss. The group finds out as he delights in telling them the story of Tony setting fire to the entire MIT accommodation block trying to cook omelettes.
He hears Ned being pulled away and tries to move to help his friend, but his limbs don’t want to work. There’s a pair of hands gripping him roughly at the shoulders and starting to drag him along. His body is still sluggish but it’s getting easier to move his limbs.
, but Steve can’t help his eyes keep flicking over to the inventor opposite him. For the first time in a while he looks relaxed and happy. Looking around at the rest of the team, he realises they all do. Vision has his arm around Wanda; Natasha has her feet under Bucky’s legs to keep them warm; Rhodey’s sat in the chair between their sofa and Tony’s; and Sam’s taken a seat next to Peter on the floor, a bowl of popcorn between them.
‘And I’m used to cleaning up the messes left by idiots,’ she adds as she joins the two of them, slinging an arm over Wade’s shoulders. ‘I promise to bring him back in one piece.’
‘Trust me Clint,’ Natasha laughs from the floor where she’s playing with Nathaniel and Lila, ‘he’d wipe the floor with you.’
‘Have we put anything out looking for Francis?’ Wade asks. ‘We know he’s linked with HYDRA too, so it might be worth trying that avenue as well.’
The soldier doesn’t look at Peter as he straightens up and sighs. ‘The other Winter Soldiers,’ he replies. ‘They used me to train them and assess their progress. They’d all been given different versions of the serum which meant they were stronger than me.’
‘He tried convincing me the Star Wars prequels were not a travesty to mankind. Get him out of the room.’
Bucky just grunts but does as the other man says. When they reach the car, he shoves the bags into the trunk and then pushes Ned to the passenger’s door. ‘You ride shotgun, kid. You got to direct Sam.’
‘I’m fine really,’ Peter tries to reassure them, feeling his cheeks burning in embarrassment. ‘I could do that all day.’
‘You are Bucky!’ she screeches in his ear as he tries to throw her off. ‘You are! You taught me to do this! You’re the one who stays up with me when I can’t sleep and Peter’s not at the facility. You’re the one that refuses to wake me up anymore after I threw an alarm clock at you one morning.
‘Yeah I ain’t getting on that thing either,’ Rocket nods his agreement, looking at the ice rink as if it would open a portal to another dimension and swallow him.
Peter just stares at him as Wade continues to knit away as they talk. ‘That really doesn’t answer the question.’
May’s face falls and she nods, her crossed arms now hugging herself. ‘I just don’t know how to keep him safe when he’s Spiderman.’
‘Come on Big Green,’ Tony’s hovering in front of him, and trying to dodge flying debris, ‘we never said you couldn’t join in, we just didn’t know if you’d want to come out or not.’
It’s a kick this time, meant to knock him off balance. Instead he jumps up, using Steve as a springboard to flip over the top of him, landing and spinning a kick into the small of his back.
you can, I’ve seen you in action. Hell I’ve stared at your spandex-clad arse when you’re in action. Doesn’t mean I’m not going to worry about you. I’m sorry I flipped out.’
‘He’s not my kid, and you deserved it,’ Tony responds from where he’s leaning against Steve’s side on the sofa, fiddling with a project on the tablet. ‘If you’re nice maybe he’ll take the webs off before they dissolve.’
‘Yeah, yeah, I know. And I won’t climb on any roofs whilst drunk again either,’ he rolls his eyes, but gives her a hug. ‘Missed you guys.’
‘Hey I’ve been waiting for you to get hitched for a hundred years,’ Bucky protests. ‘Do you know how long I’ve been writing this best man speech?’
‘Shit,’ Steve hisses a curse as he misjudges it and tips the platform. Before they can go sliding too far, Peter jumps back, misjudging it and nearly falling off the edge into the mud.
he couldn’t quite make himself beg - with the Secretary General and the rest of the appointed UN Council, slowly getting changes.
Tony follows the rest of the team inside, noticing that everyone is a little more subdued than normal. It seems Thor and Valkyrie’s departure has driven home just how soon they may be facing Thanos.
‘Just how are you managing to fit in designing stuff for SI when you’re working on all our stuff, as well as all these meetings?’ Sam demands.
‘Mr Stark,’ the Japanese representative, Mr Aizama, interjects, ‘you cannot honestly expect us to readily agree to allow all of the renegade Avengers to return?’
‘Shit who turned on the fucking lights?’ I groan as someone moves something above me, letting light hit me straight in the eyes.
Next up from me though, is the next instalment in my main series 'Restoration' and it's my take on Infinity War and End Game.
-Listen to me, Winter Warrior- he shouts through the link. Bucky’s punch goes wide and he blinks in surprise.
‘Do not feel that you have to stay,’ Loki says to the three of them, ‘I can imagine it will be tedious to have to watch me stare at a lot of carvings on a rock wall, and I am aware not everyone is comfortable in a cold environment.’
‘Safehouse,’ Tony grins at him, relieved to see the echo of one back as he parrots the archer’s words to him from when they faced Ultron. ‘One I haven’t thought about in years, so even Wanda wouldn’t know of it.’
‘I could murder a couple of chimichangas.’ He can see the answering grin through the mask as the man stands up to go and order.  Just as he’s settling back against the chair his phone rings. It’s a number he doesn’t recognise. ‘Hello?’
A/N: Hello everyone! I hope you've all had a good week and you enjoy this chapter. Thank you so much for all the support for the story so far, please do let me know what you think of it and if there's anything you'd like to see in the future. I'm going to be catching up with replies tomorrow as I've lost track of what I've responded to and what I haven't and I'm so sorry for that!
Peter leaps onto the ceiling, crawling along a couple more feet before he shoots a web and snags the power source, pulling it up and placing it in safely in a storage section of his suit. Then he jumps down, landing gracefully on his feet. ‘Got it!’
‘Tony,’ Pepper shakes her head, ‘stay out of my relationship. For the sake of Happy’s stress levels and my headaches. Now,’ she says before he can finish opening his mouth, ‘I need you to have a look through these.’ She dumbs the pile of paperwork on his lap. ‘All of these are projects that SI has funded in the past and that are up for renewal. I know you like to still have a hand in what we fund so I thought I’d let you take a look through and tell me what you think and then we can go from there.’
someone there with him,’ she adds, ‘to make sure he kept focussed on the goal of shutting down the lab and not just on taking out an individual.’
‘Maybe, that would explain why he was so wary about giving you information. If you thought he was just doing it as a way to get revenge on an individual would you have let him go?’
Steve isn’t sure how long they hold out. Everything is lost to ducking and weaving and lashing out with the shield. It all starts going so well.
‘Thanks,’ he nods, ‘that makes sense. I’m just…worried about people getting suspicious if I keep running off, I guess.’
Strange huffs in frustration. ‘This is against my better judgment, and I imagine I’ll regret it, but fine. Once more. But then no more until you have answered my questions.’
A/N: Merry Christmas everyone! I hope you had a lovely day yesterday.  I'm posting the first of the Christmas Eve chapters because I want you to vote: which team should win Capture the Flag? I'll start writing the next chapter or two, and you guys let me know who you want to win: Wanda or Strange?
He hears the other man chuckle. ‘No harm done. How about we get through the check on your mind first and then I shall let you peruse the library to your heart’s content? As long as you check with me before reading a book. I should hate for you to open the wrong one and end up in the wrong dimension.’
Tony shrugs. ‘I don’t need that much sleep, Sam. I never have. So I tend to have more hours to cram stuff into than most people.’
‘Yeah,’ he nods, then lowers his voice, ‘when I’m sure you’ll reach the bars I’ll let go so it looks like I couldn’t hold on to the bars. Please don’t let go of me.’
‘So Steve is my next babysitter? Poor you, Rogers,’ he snarks as the Captain walks into his hospital room.
Bucky shrugs. ‘Well we never had one as kids because you couldn’t afford to waste food. Was only ever something you saw in the movies, so you just used to talk with your mates about growing up and being rich enough to afford enough food that you
‘Of course I want to go home,’ Steve replies, not looking at either of them and staring out over the forest below them. ‘I’m just not sure how I feel about Tony being the one to get us all there.’
‘Probably something to do with freedom and righteousness,’ Tony teases, helmet not yet raised to cover his face.
‘This is awesome!’ the voice comes from inside. ‘What made you even think to put this in? I never would have thought about it until I was frozen up.’
Strange bends down to pick up another sheet and goes to stand with them. ‘O come let us adore him, o come let us adore him. O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord.’
They play a couple of games, and Peter notices the woman starting to relax the more she’s around the mercenaries; she’s learning, just as quickly as he did it seems, that the group is fairly harmless unless it’s towards each other.
Wanda growls in frustration, brushing a stray piece of hair out of her eyes and glaring into the blast containment chamber.
‘Well, well, who knew Captain America could be so demanding?’ he teases, voice breathless as Steve starts placing kisses against his throat, the blond’s hands going under his shirt to lift it over his head and throw it to the floor.
‘The only problem,’ Bucky adds quietly. ‘Is if that happens its unlikely Ross will allow any of the rest of you to return.’
A/N: Merry Christmas Eve everyone! I hope you enjoy the penultimate chapter of this special. There's one more chapter 'New Year's Eve' still to come, which I'll post on Friday. I hope you're still enjoying this story, if you have been enjoying it and haven't read 'Restoration' why not give it a go?
‘Nah I reckon it’s Rocket with his traps, Clint with his arrows and Tony with his tech,’ Quill replies.
‘The only reason I’m still in the bed is because you’re subconsciously sticking yourself to me,’ Wade cuts him off.
‘You don’t exactly have the best track record when it comes to looking after your own health,’ Vision points out. After a pause he adds, ‘What? It’s true.’
‘That is something we need to work on later,’ Nick interrupts again. ‘For now let’s take a vote on Tony’s role.’ When the vote is unanimous Tony opens his mouth to argue. ‘No one is expecting you to be an expert in everything,’ the one-eyed man tells him, ‘get someone to help you with the magic and dimensional side of things who’ll be sticking around.’
‘Yeah she’d definitely be helpful, but I think we’ve got enough help so far,’ she gestures to where Tony is already hovering in his boots, a box of icicles in one hand. ‘You want to put the star on the top?’
‘Not as much as I love that cute little butt of yours,’ Wade laughs and runs off before Peter can respond. He does send a set of tweezers flying after the cackling mercenary though.
‘Because I want you to have a normal life before giving it over entirely to being an Avenger, or any kind of superhero,’ he explains. ‘Because once you start doing this shit full time you can’t just give it up and go back to a normal life, especially if everyone knows who you are. Pete you’re only sixteen, that’s too young to give up everything to help other people all the time; too young to put your life on the line for them. I know,’ he raises a hand for Peter to stay quiet as he pulls away, frowning and opening his mouth to protest. ‘I know you can’t sit back and do nothing, which is why I gave you back the suit, why you come up here every other weekend. Why I don’t stop you from being Spider-Man. But you still need to be Peter Parker as well. You need to have the chance to go through school, get drunk under-age at parties-’
He drinks some of his coffee as he takes a stool at the breakfast bar next to her. ‘Nat you know I’m crap at this, but…’ he trails off, and a brief glance at her from the corner of his eye shows she’s patiently waiting for him to speak. ‘I can’t do this alone anymore, I need help.’
‘I know he was talking to his sister,’ the AI responds from the screen in front of him so the others can’t overhear, ‘from information I have I can deduce they were discussing their family business.’
‘No, and even if I did I wouldn’t tell you because I imagine you’d send him off on some stupid task just to annoy him,’ Steve replies.
‘All I ask,’ Tony responds, then goes to give Peter a hug goodbye before waving to the two of them as they follow Natasha to the waiting car. ‘You two off?’ he asks Clint and Scott.
‘Sometimes I swear he’s less mature than Peter despite being like four times his age,’ Wanda sighs. Strange chuckles.
Loki is reintroduced to the team, Peter's relationship with Wade comes to light, and the team discover who Tony has been talking to
‘Hey Doc!’ Peter waves from the sofa, Strange gives a smile and wave back just as Loki enters, his arms full of materials and Rhodes coming in behind him.
The day before Yule dawns and Loki blinks awake as FRIDAY lets daylight filter through his blinds. He always holds a bit of dread for this day, the one where they remember those that were lost during the past year; and this year in particular there are many to remember.
‘I bet it felt a bit like we didn’t really care about you wanting to keep Spider-Man a secret right?’ Sam offers from the breakfast bar. ‘And we’re sorry about that, kid, we didn’t mean for it to come across like that. We genuinely thought that you’d find it easier to do that with people you knew, and we should have realised that it’d actually make it more difficult.’
‘I know I’ve spoken a lot, and most of this is stuff that people have already heard, but I hope you have learned something new from this presentation. Although none of the information itself may be different, I had to do a lot of re-evaluation of what I’d been taught in school when I spoke to members of the team about it, and I hope you’ve been able to do the same from this presentation. I’m sure there’s a lot of questions and I will do my best to answer them, but no promises.’
