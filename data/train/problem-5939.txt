in person, but Pepper had made it to his wedding after all. And Happy, too, but Pepper...Pepper had made it, and that's what mattered.
"Hmm… You know, if we're going to do this whole 'leave' thing," he said as he watched Steve get changed, "I may have to institute mandatory shirtlessness."
"Not exactly," Steve said with a shrug. "Maybe she didn't mean for you to…"
He sneered a little and turned away from the stove, and even though he'd already known it, it actually hit him that Thor was there.
Steve just pulled him into his arms and kissed the crown of his head. "Thank you," he murmured.
Steve frowned, that deep furrow forming between his brows. "Tony, you shouldn't cry—"
"'re you OK?" he asked, the words coming out a little bit sleep-slurred.
He just hummed some and nestled back into the pillows. "That didn't quite work out the way I'd planned it."
Tony blinked at him. "We do?"
slow about getting his dick inside of Tony, and Tony made to reach behind him and grab the appropriate member to do it himself. Steve, the bastard, slapped his hand away.
Tony made a face of disbelief. "You really think Steve would lose it because of me?"
"It is," Steve said with a sagely nod.
"How?"
Pepper closed her mouth and nodded. He didn't expect her to quite understand that — Iron Man had been a point of contention in their relationship from the time it had started until the moment it had ended — but thankfully she didn't say anything to it and just seemingly nodded her understanding to Tony's quandary.
"If that's what you want."
She shrugged again and turned back to Thor. "Any reason in particular for summoning me? I do have quite the schedule to keep. So many poor, lost souls in need of help."
She was a girl, Tony figured, blonde hair pulled into a ponytail, wearing a pair of blue jeans with colorful flowers etched onto the pockets, and as Tony came around to get a look at her, Bruce joining him at his side, he saw her screen-printed purple t-shirt featured what looked to be cartoon versions of the Avengers (OK, the stylized 'Avengers' at the bottom of the picture kind of gave it away). The child groaned a bit, and Tony heard what sounded like a high-pitched whine emanating from her — like she was ready to burst into tears.
He took several deep breaths. In. Out. In. Out again. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to block out the thought, but all he could see was some Hydra goon advancing on him, taking advantage of his somewhat vulnerable position, grabbing him, taking him to some lair where he'd be subjected to various experiments and tortures—
"It's fine, Steve," he said in an attempt to put him at ease. "Nothing
"Nope. Not a thing. Told you. Trying to fix the TV. Got stuck on that stupid station."
He'd been thinking about this for a while, if he was being honest with himself.
Tony snorted a laugh. "You don't say."
like she was supposed to be…"
"It's not too late for you?" he added, not sure if he meant the late hour or the seven years that had gone past.
"I should make you go and find that yourself. It's a matter of public record. But April. Do I remember the date? No, of course not. That's why I got married. Steve remembers that stuff, not me." He pointed to one in the middle toward the far wall. "You."
Steve's sappiness must have been catching because Tony wasn't sure — especially after last night — that there was anything better than that.
Steve still hadn't come upstairs by the time he finished, and he sat on the bed and towel-dried his hair. He tried to listen in for Steve and Sam's conversation, but he couldn't hear anything — not even the general noise that Steve could somehow make just lounging around and reading stuff on his tablet — and so he got up and went over to the door and thought maybe being closer to the living room would help him.
. My life is tied into the life of a parasite that's growing inside of me, and I could very well
"Uh, thanks," Bruce said, perplexed, like he wasn't sure whether to be insulted or not. "It's… I mean, is there some sort of polymer that maybe you could work out? Something that would grow and shrink as needed—"
"Anyway, I'm just saying we should think about it," Barton continued. "You all know I'm right."
"I woke up and you weren't there, and
"I'm sorry, you saw the picture of that wall, right? The one with all the arrows stuck in it? He's lucky I don't toss him off the roof and see if bird-brain can actually fly."
He put his head in his hands and ran them back through his hair, grabbing on like the pain would somehow give him the answers or make everything better.
"Well, I know how skittish you are about it. I don't want to offend your delicate sensibilities." "Give birth, Steve," he said and rolled his eyes. "The moment I give birth to your rather sizeable child. Seriously, if this kid isn't, at the least, ten pounds, I will be shocked."
Other Tony shut up and stared at Tony, tilting his head a little in slight confusion.
Tony just stroked his hair a few more quiet moments, and the clouds that had been hanging over the city all day — hey, he'd listened to the weather report JARVIS had given him earlier! — finally opened to a torrent of rainfall, droplets hitting against the windows and cascading down in rivulets that made the lights of the city look fractured and blurry.
"Yeah, I love him," Jim said, "but he was not always the best judge of that sort of thing. Seems to have wised up in the last five years or so."
"Steve, why—"
Not a minute later, Olivia came barreling into the workshop, face tearstained, and she ran over to him and latched on, and Tony, in a move that he would never fully understand how he even knew what to do, scooped her up into his arms and held her tight against his chest.
that he wanted to keep this quiet, and what had he gone and done? Made a snap decision and told a reporter —
Steve just continued to stare at him, his look going from pointed to flat.
"No! It— I mean, it wasn't like that. It was…"
Steve frowned until he realized Tony had taken that as some awful innuendo, and he rolled his eyes and said, "No, your height. You, uh…"
"What is it?" he practically purred.
"Well, that's convenient," Tony muttered. "How long are we talking here?"
listen to you. I
"Just the two," Bruce replied.
"I wish you wouldn't say it like that. And I know you, and I know you weren't about to ask Bruce if you could help it."
"No, but you might have misheard."
doesn't work here, too, does he?"
Oh, that's how.
"Not if it's going to make them start leaking weird stuff."
seems to like to get rowdy whenever I want to relax."
Tony tilted his head in slight bemusement. "I'm sorry. Do you not
"But—"
"Is it a boy or a girl?"
Barnes shot him a pointed look. "You look more like a 'Tony' than a 'Natasha.'"
"You literally call me 'old man.'"
"Isn't it?" He surprised even himself with the amount of venom in his voice, and he seemed to surprise Tony, too, judging by the latter's painful wince.
"That's all muscle weight, right, J? Also, five-
"Sorry," he said as he crossed into the lab and moved over to the desk. "Clint and Sam wanted hot wings or whatever the hell they're called. I know how much the smell bothers you."
Bruce threw a glance back at Tony and said, "You've got two years to prepare."
Olivia was babbling in his arms, and Tony, his back to them, said, "I know, baby. In a minute. Papa's trying to get everything together so we can go have breakfast and open our presents in the living room like the ridiculously domesticated creatures we are."
"It's not…" He shook his head.
So, he tried to think about what would come after the war, but every time he began to wonder what might happen once the war was over (he was certain the war would be over next year at this time), a nerve-wracking jolt of guilt flooded his veins. Even if Steve lived to see another Christmas, Bucky never would, and Bucky had only been where he'd been because Steve had asked…
Steve coughed and said, "Yeah, well, uh, it
"All right, guys," Steve said, inserting himself into their pissing match. "Come on. It's Christmas Eve. Leave the hometown pride for another day."
Steve just made a face and nodded at the cake. "Come on," he said and broke off his own small portion. "Let's do this so they leave us alone."
"That's nice."
," he begged. "Steve, please. I need it. I need you."
"Uh… What happened here?" Tony asked and motioned to the mess of pots and pans and dishes and… Was that
She left, and Tony looked to Bruce for explanation, but Bruce just shrugged and went back to inspecting the other things he'd brought down with him along with the gurney — did one look like a box of extra-large maxi-pads or something? — and so he turned to Barnes and said, "I take it you know what that's about."
She checked her phone. "So far, so good." She turned to them and said, "Why don't you go back upstairs and let us deal with this?"
"Does that mean you won't?"
He'd be lying if he said he hadn't intentionally chosen this route just for the chance to catch a glimpse of Tony again.
"I think they know each other," Steve said with a slight nod. "I mean beyond him shooting her."
"Trace,
She groaned and rolled her eyes. "How many times must we go over this?" she muttered. "Yes," she said and turned her full attention back to him. "I provided him with a body that could conceive a child. You, my Captain, are the one that knocked him up."
Tony nodded. "Duly noted. Fix hair when it gets messy."
"Don't think she really has a choice," Steve said.
keeps his bed warm!"
"No, you don't understand," he said, and Steve set the tablet on the nightstand and folded his hands behind his head to gaze up at Tony. "I… For a long time, I was a bringer of death. I made weapons that killed people. I thought I was doing it for the right reasons. I was a military contractor. I built things that I thought were protecting our guys out there doing the fighting — fighting I couldn't be bothered with. I thought it was someone else's responsibility. But I thought I was doing the right thing. I didn't realize… I saw men and women killed by the very weapons I had designed to protect them. I have so much blood on my hands, and I thought…if I got out of the weapons business, it would be enough. Then I thought if I went out as Iron Man for a while, it would be enough. Then I thought if I was an Avenger, it would be enough. I'm never going to make up for all that blood. Nothing I do can ever bring those people back to life."
Christ! Really? Really,
"I'm sorry, are you accusing me of being a blanket hog?"
"That sounds like Tony," he murmured as JARVIS sounded out, "
Or, at least, that version of Tony and Pepper were OK. No telling whether or not this version would be. If they were even different versions, anyway.
"Trial?" Steve asked and looked back at him.
He wasn't sure that he could do this without him.
Tony yawned, exhaustion suddenly hitting him like a ton of bricks, but he brushed it off and said, "Uh, don't you have a company to run?"
going to run off to 'find himself,' isn't he?"
"This is a pointless question," she said, and she couldn't have sounded any more annoyed with them if she'd tried, "but does either one of you have ID?"
as everyone else seemed to, but he could admit that he had powers above and beyond what he knew the average — or even above-average — human to possess. He wasn't sure
Steve shook his head and rested his arms atop the seat, leaning his weight against it. "Doesn't matter what the public thinks—"
Tony blinked. "Oh," was all he could manage at that revelation.
Incidentally, Tony was pretty well healed up by now, so, yeah, definitely time to start doing at least
"What do you mean you didn't have a
She bit her lip and looked like she was about to cry, and she took off out of the room, leaving him to groan and chase after her again.
Barnes sighed and shook his head.
"Whoever took out the grid knew what they were doing," Natasha explained. "The entire east coast is dark."
"Well, don't you look nice all gussied up?" Barton said as Natasha strolled through the penthouse living room one evening a few weeks later.
She pulled her hands away. "And now it's weird." She shook her head and laughed a little to herself before she said, "How are
I didn't— How else could you have found out about—"
He shut his door and walked around the back of the car to meet up with Tony and said, "Need some help?"
"You know, I think you left the fridge door open."
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. "
He found a dressing room, and he was about to step into the dress to try it on when the door opened and Natasha barged right in without even bothering to knock, evidently not caring that Tony was standing there in his underwear. She held a white satin and lace bustier out to him and said, "Here, try this on under it."
He shook his head and turned away from the mirror. He grabbed his pajamas and slid into them, leaving the bra on because he was finding it more comfortable to sleep with it on than not. He looked down at Steve's barren side of the bed, one that would remain empty until sometime tomorrow, and he burrowed into his side of the bed. JARVIS put down the lights as he settled into the pillows, and without thinking, he reached down and began to stroke his abdomen once again, gently, protectively, and it wasn't until he had been lying there staring off into the darkness for a few minutes that he even realized what he was doing. He glanced down at the small swell hidden by the blankets and said, "You are nothing but trouble."
"Hmm?"
"It would explain Tony Stark's disappearance, for one. It would also explain how you happen to have all of his information. What it doesn't explain is why you wouldn't have had
Bruce chose that exact moment to enter the lab, ashen-faced and anguished. Natasha and Tony turned to him at the same time, and he met Tony's gaze and said a plaintive, "Tony, I'm so sorry."
Tony didn't say a word.
Steve nodded. "Pretty sure that's what you call all that stuff. You didn't notice?"
"There's a life in here, Steve, an actual living, breathing — well, maybe not yet, technically — but an actual living
He swallowed the lump of emotion that had bubbled up into his throat and said a gravelly and unsteady, "Yeah, sure."
, either, but it was worth it. Steve was so worth it.
cradle." He looked down at the baby in his arm. "Which is kind of weird terminology to use considering the circumstances."
Tony just stared up at him, smiling, like he could not honestly believe what he was hearing.
"What?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, my god, Steve! No! I'm just taking you up on that offer for sex!"
"Because it's the truth. You are
"I'm going to fist you tonight," she purred, her tone like smooth, liquid gold. "Would you like that, baby? Would you like me to fist you? You've been after me to do it for a while now."
"Hmm?" Tony asked without looking up from his phone. He took another bite of his platter, swallowed, and said, still not looking up, "Oh, he got some stupid idea in his head that he wasn't good enough for me, so he broke it off. Didn't see him for years after that. Not sure what he's doing now."
She shrugged. "OK."
But Sam shook his head and said, "Nah, man, it's time. We gotta tell him."
Jesus, how could he even possibly begin to explain— Wait. How in the hell would she—
"Nat did say you were a natural at it."
He swallowed, touched by the sincerity of Thor's words. It was stupid to get hung up on things like whether or not he was
Tony hummed once again, and he nestled his face against Steve's palm, eyes closed and mouth formed into a small, delicate smile. Steve smiled in return at that, and he brushed the pad of his thumb against Tony's lips and said, "I'm going to take that as a 'yes.'"
"What?"
Tony snorted a laugh and grabbed what he presumed was a pot of coffee from the counter appliance. "Avenger-shit is insanely popular. I think we're up there with Star Wars and Frozen."
thought that ensemble was fit for public consumption? He and Captain America were turned
"You know," Rhodey said, digging into his slice of chocolate heaven, "would it kill you to say 'thank you for looking out for me' once in your life?"
Rhodey put a hand out to silence them like this was his final word on the matter. "Look, I'm very happy for you. I think you're good for each other, and I think you make each other really happy. I think Steve's the best thing that's ever happened to you, and I think you're crazy lucky to have found each other. But I do
Tony was staring at him, frowning, concern growing by the minute, and Steve unfolded his arms and reached down to take hold of him, pulling him slowly and gently to his feet. Tony continued to stare at him, warily now, dark eyes narrowing as he skirted his gaze all over Steve's face — those dark eyes lined with those gorgeous dark, curly lashes — his lips thinned in something like a pout. He went to ask something, but Steve just smiled at him, and he ran gentle hands down Tony's arms from his shoulders to his wrists and said, "I'm...perfect."
, JARVIS!” he said as Steve sighed and pulled his hand out of his pants but didn’t let go of Tony’s chin.
"It's still kind of a symbolic thing," Bruce said. "Like if he got married in his suit, he might see that as you marrying Captain America instead of Steve Rogers."
Steve shot him a pointed look. "You make it sound as though it was my fault the last time."
"Think the magazine and the movie studio."
"Tony, not tha—"
"It really is a shame to do this. I love looking at your eyes, and the makeup looks fantastic." He felt Steve kiss his shoulder. "But I only want you feeling. I don't want you seeing, and I don't want you anticipating, understand?"
Steve nodded and put his finger beneath Tony's chin to tilt his head up toward him. He brought his mouth down and met Tony's lips with his own, all warm and tender and gentle and caring, and in the periphery, he heard Barton say, "Well, if there's one good thing about them getting married it's that marriage usually kills the romance, so at least they'll stop making us suffer through this shit."
And who in the hell wore and off-the-rack suit-and-sweater combo to a several-thousand-dollar-a- plate gala fundraiser? Bruce didn't count. He wasn't wearing a sweater.
, Steve! I am
He'd forgotten his earlier oath not to look at himself in the mirror, but with the door ajar and the vent having circulated out most of the steam once again, the moment Tony finished toweling off his wet hair, he was able to grudgingly come face-to-face with himself in the large, broad vanity mirror ahead of him.
He took a sip of champagne, and Steve said, "Yeah, not because it has anything to do with being horribly sexist or derogatory."
The man continued to stare at the thing in his hand. "Or you're not even bothering to pay attention to me because you're more excited about today than the spoiled brat across the hall." He pushed something on the side of the rectangle, and the light went out. He hummed a bit and said, "The things I do for you," then leaned in and pressed a quick, chaste kiss against Steve's slightly-opened mouth. "Yeah, we should probably brush our teeth before we go beyond that."
"So was his."
childhood that had seemed to elude both of them in some way.
"Not sure you should do that," he said and closed his eyes as he tucked his head into the crook of Steve's neck. "I mean, if you burn the universe, where would we live?"
But, in thinking about the way Barnes had looked so reluctant over Steve's suggestion to join the Avengers, there was something about Barnes' attitude toward Steve that pinged something in his memory — something Steve had said to him just a few days before —
"They knew who they were selling to," Tony said and fought through the cluster of Avengers trying to get food and drinks and plates and mugs. He made it to a box and snagged two of the jelly-filled, one powdered and one frosted, shoving the powdered one halfway into his mouth and taking a large and savory bite, the jelly squirting out over the sides of his mouth. He turned to face Steve, who was now standing at his elbow, and he grinned and chewed the bite, jelly slathered over his face and clumps of powdered sugar covering the front of his shirt.
She wiggled her eyebrows at Bruce, and Bruce laughed and said, "Should I be insulted you invited me to the preview and not the opening?"
Steve sighed out a breath. "Tony, I think you could go out for something like—"
where you went?"
After Barnes had departed for destination unknown, Tony went down to the basement garage and grabbed the Audi, and he drove down to the Village through what was not exactly heavy traffic for an early Saturday afternoon, finding a space close to the agreed-upon coffee shop. It was a tight squeeze, but he managed it (
Pepper led him over to the elevators, Natasha right behind them and Steve and Rhodey bringing up the rear. Tony did a headcount then looked at Pepper and said, "Where's your best guy?"
Steve shrugged. If Tony didn't know better, he'd say the move came off as sheepish. "Just a little…reading up on pregnancy."
Steve shrugged. "Well, you seem so convinced that I'm going to drop you like a hot potato when you don't turn back to your old self the moment you, uh…"
was desirable.
"Tony, listen—"
wore rings?
"Well, that's old-timey," he muttered then said to her, "Well, why shouldn't I call you 'baby girl'?" She shrugged. "I dunno."
. God, he wasn't reading RPF about
Steve tightened his arms a little bit. "Not my decision to make. It's yours. We'll do it however you want."
job Steve had done with the suitcases. Jesus Christ, didn't anyone ever teach this man not to just ball clothes up and shove them in something?
Bruce frowned at him. "
it's a girl, I owe you fifteen thousand."
"I mean, in general, you're— Uh, I used to be an art student, and you've got— Um, your physique is, uh—"
He ended up scrambling himself some eggs with a couple slices of toast on the side, and he pulled open the fridge and looked for anything to wash it down with. He saw the nearly-empty carton of orange juice from this morning, and he thought long and hard about just pouring the damned thing down the drain, but he left it to fester and instead pulled out what looked like a small bottle of apple juice. Not the tiny bottles that had sat in his fridge for the longest time because there was a small part of him that was convinced that someone would be back to drink them, and she would be
Tony rolled his eyes but made his way over the slightly overgrown slate path toward what he figured was supposed to be the back door to the place. "Hey, yeah, next question: How are we supposed to get in?"
Now, the way he'd appeared at their wedding, on the other hand…
Tony toyed with the stylus in his hand. "Just, I guess as a hypothetical, say you were ever at some point in your life to have a daughter, what would you name her?"
good. She's a very healthy and happy little baby. Whatever you're doing with her, keep doing it."
Some more really, really, really bad porn in this one. No, I mean it. It's really bad. My previous attempts were eloquent works of poetry compared to this. It's also gets into a bit of the Dom/sub stuff, though nothing as hardcore as I've seen in some other fics.
He stopped dead in his train of thought and said, "Wonder what Steve would look like with a beard?"
He looked between them, and there was something almost predatory about his gaze as he said, "Should I not? Stranger things have happened as of late, and Lady Liberty here—" he nodded at Tony at that, "—was, from what I understand, very insistent on what she was saying being the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
"Because people feel sorry for you because of how lame it is," Tony muttered and went back to the list. "
"Romantic? Yeah, maybe in some other time and place it would have been."
"You're off the team."
Steve wouldn't look at him as he murmured, "Wouldn't be the first person to prefer Buck to me."
Tony turned to glare at him. "Oh, I'm sorry. Did you really think anyone was asking for your expert input?"
Steve caught him looking at himself, but before Steve could say anything, he cut him off and said, "Think I'm gonna go grab a quick shower, yeah?"
As Bucky explained...something...to Sam, Steve reached down and scooped Olivia out of his arms. He held her against his chest, the baby having reached the age where she could hold up some of her own weight so she wasn't settling into his embrace the way he wanted her to, but he held her tight and brushed his lips against her forehead and rocked her ever so slightly — like how he used to do when she was a fussy newborn he was trying to get settled back to sleep.
Son-of-a-
"Olivia, you probably shouldn't do that," he said, a warning tone in his voice, and she pouted a little and shrank down but stopped bouncing as she ate her sandwich.
"Oh, come on!" Tony said with a scoff. "That doesn't mean anything! What did you wish for?"
That…was not a half-bad idea.
"I'm rich and easy, J. S'all there is to it."
"Look, I'm not really in the mood to talk about it right now. I don't really give a shit whether she shares any biological signatures with me or not, I still have to figure out a way of getting her home."
"So," Barton said as he came down the open loading hatch because evidently in the time Steve and Tony had been in the inferno, the others had finished whatever it was they were doing. "Another fruitless search?"
. I think he thinks people are a little too casual with the fucking now. Calling it 'making love,' I think to him, makes it mean more. It's not just sex, it's more than that. Yeah, we do some pretty…dirty stuff, I'll be honest here. But it's not just sex for him. It's something more than that. It's…"
"Look, the public knows the original six of us," Tony said. "When this was designed and put into production, you were probably still blissfully running around the Mall or wherever the hell you were when Steve picked you up off the street like a stray fucking kitten without a care in the world."
But the guy just let his gaze run up and down Tony's body a couple times, almost like he was trying to see if he was telling the truth or not, and he swallowed and opened and closed his mouth a couple times then scratched the back of his head and said, "Yeah, you know what? I just realized. I got an early day tomorrow. Got a big project I gotta work on, so you know what? Why don't I, uh… Why don't we… Yeah, I'll see you around."
"What's nothing?"
"Seriously?"
"You probably will— And you
Bucky and Jim rolled their eyes, but Steve nodded and said, "I agree."
"He does that sometimes," Natasha murmured like she was thinking of something in particular but didn't elaborate on it.
it was a dream." He scratched his arm. "I don't know. I guess maybe— I thought maybe—" He shook his head. "I had a —
Romanoff was as lost as he was, but Barton just walked around to the head of the bed and braced himself over Tony like he was trying to match his line of sight to Tony's. "Stark, you and Cap… you, uh, you experimented back when you got turned into a woman a couple months ago, didn't you?"
"You know what a BFF is?"
He didn't like the look on Tony's face, so he turned his attention back to the 'cellphone' in his hand. "But what does it do?"
He pulled the carton away from his mouth. "Thirsty," he said and went back to drinking.
"I didn't get
He shrugged and moved his hand over the swell of Tony's abdomen, Tony's hand resting atop his. "Yeah, but…I was an only kid. It got lonely. I always wanted at least two if I ever had any of my own. To be honest, I think I'd sorta kinda like a half-a-dozen."
"You said that before — that this 'Barton' says I spoil you. Why? I mean why does he say it?"
" JARVIS responded, and the little girl gasped and said, "Vision!"
Tony just hummed and shrugged, secure in the knowledge that he
He served himself some of the delicious foods Steve had brought home and even deigned to take some of the salad as well, which — of course — did not go unnoticed by Steve, who just gave him a knowing smirk as he watched Tony shove a bite of salad in his mouth.
quick."
"Anything bothering you? Anything you need me to tweak?"
Tony sucked in a breath. He knew he'd be confronted with that eventually, but he was kind of hoping to put it off a little while longer. If only because he hadn't figured out a good explanation for it yet.
, right? You know, something like, "
Steve had a pinched look on his face. "Tony, I just think maybe—"
"Tony, that's not—"
Steve chuckled a little but put his arm around Tony's waist and led him out of the bedroom. He helped him down the stairs, and Tony was about to head in the direction of the elevator to take them to the communal floor when he heard light talking coming from the kitchen, and he and Steve stopped in the middle of the living area. Steve grinned and nodded at the kitchen and said, "Family kitchen."
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. "What are they even doing 'training' at this time of the morning?"
" but said nothing otherwise.
But here— Here was one that did not just have the potential for Steve's strength but Tony's intelligence. OK, not that Steve was an idiot, but with Tony's genes in the mix, there was an even greater potential for a little super-human super-genius for Hydra to get their hands on, to train, to soldier for them and design weapons the world could not possibly yet imagine.
"Or maybe you people are just a bunch freeloading moochers?"
Tony decided to get himself something to eat once he was done feeding the baby, and he went back into the kitchen and set her in her highchair then set about scrounging through the cabinets for something to chow down on. He wasn't sure what he was really in the mood for, and, sadly, Steve was probably not going to come back from wherever he still was with a bag of bagels or a box of doughnuts. He grumbled and found himself wishing, if only for a moment, that the others had made themselves at home there this morning so he could mooch off of their breakfasts. He blamed Hydra for altering his daily routine so, and it was but another strike against them and just one more thing to add to the growing list of grievances he had with them.
"What's your question, Tony?"
"No, subway to a bus."
"And be disappointed."
Bruce looked like he was honestly trying to fight the smile that was fighting to stretch over his lips. "Actually, no."
Pepper was silent a moment before she said, "
"Well," Tony said with a shrug. "Rome wasn't built in a day. Now—" he turned to his band of hungry little avengers, "—who wants what?"
"I thought you said 'together,' Steve? You and me, together? You said that's how we would deal with this. You promised, Steve."
He noticed that Steve had flushed a little like he was embarrassed, his lips thinning and his eyes looking everywhere but at Tony, and he finally said, "Just…thinking."
"Yeah."
Even though Barnes had said he was gone to meet Hill, he honestly expected Hill to put in an appearance right after Barnes left, and he sat there for several quiet minutes and waited for her to barge into his penthouse like the others had, but she never showed. No one did. Midday sun had given way to clouds, and so he sat there in his living room, the gloomy, late afternoon showing through the broad floor-to-ceiling windows surrounding him. As the last of the adrenaline — and sedative — began to leave his system, a darker and sadder feeling began to overtake him, one that actively worked to counteract all the goodness and positivity he'd been able to convince himself of from the moment Bruce had walked into his lab looking baleful and ashen-faced.
"Wouldn't have thought it, would you?"
There was silence from inside the bathroom before Tony heard the turn of the latch, and Steve appeared looking flushed, somewhat abashed, and so hard it probably hurt. Tony looked him over then said, "You started anything yet?"
"Not sure," Hill said as she ended her call. "As far as we can tell, it's a blackout, but no one seems to be able to pinpoint where it started."
He came unannounced, emptying his spend into Tony, pumping through the aftershocks, and teasing out the last of his orgasm, the squelch of lube and come sounding downright depraved to his ear. He hovered above Tony a moment, and he was about to collapse on top of him when he realized Tony hadn't come yet, his cock still hard and curving against his belly. He swallowed and tried to see through the stars in his eyes, and he reached down and grasped hold of Tony's cock, and Tony grunted at the friction, but it didn't take him long to come to his own orgasm, and Steve worked him through it as Tony shot come all over his own chest and belly, and after they'd calmed, and after they'd both come back to their heads, Tony looked down at himself and said, "I forgot how messy you are."
"You spend enough time staring at Steve's mouth," Bruce said with a sly smile. "You'd think a few words would register every now and then."
"No wonder it seemed so fucking rehearsed," he muttered then said, "Yeah huh, so, you clearly knew about all of this and, instead of informing me of it, you thought it would be a good idea to go along with it?"
"Pepper and Maria said they'd handle it," Steve said and hit the button for the elevator then reached up and began to work Tony's shoulders.
Wait, do you mean
"What?" Steve asked.
Everyone nodded their understanding and filed out of the room save for Tony, who sat stuffing the last of his bagel in his mouth, and Barnes, who sat looking a little nervous and unsure about what he was supposed to be doing. Steve just glanced over something on the tablet again, shook his head in disgust, and tossed it onto the table. He turned to Tony, and his features softened as he said, "I'm sorry—"
Tony pulled away from him. "J, cut the music!"
"I think you've already proven that not to be the case," Hill said as she kicked her feet up onto the table.
"Pepper, I don't know what you want me to say. Do you want me to go out and have a press conference and tell the world what happened? Do you really think that's wise?"
On one occasion when he was standing in the bathroom looking over his body one evening before bed, hands cupping weighty breasts before he slid them down to his abdomen, he caught Steve watching him, lips slightly parted, gaze raking over his body, and when he went to call out to tease him about being a voyeur, Steve just turned and left the bathroom. If he didn't know better, he'd say Steve was embarrassed at getting caught. He followed him out and watched as Steve climbed under the covers and pulled them up to his shoulder.
Bruce dropped his head a little. "And we're back to Cap."
" he reiterated, practically spitting the words for emphasis. "I— She— I didn't have much of a
"All right," he said, "you have to explain that."
Again, she shrugged.
Its natural,
"Any idea what we tell her?"
Rhodey just shook his head at them in disappointment before he went back to cooing at the baby, and Bruce didn't even bother to make some lame excuse before he was departing for whereabouts unknown. Steve, meanwhile, had gone back to reading over the specs printed on the highchair's box, and Tony, the trinket still weighty in his hand, eyed it over once more before he reached out and carefully set it on the coffee table. He caught Pepper making her way over in the periphery, and he looked up and smiled at her, and he called out, "So, you're a traitor like all the rest of them."
Steve, surprisingly, did not wake from his slumber just to argue with him.
"What? You and me? Yeah, I've kind of come to that realization, too."
"Tony, I'm so sorry. I never meant for anything like this to happen. I'd take it back if I could. I'd endure this for you if I could. You know I would."
"It's fine, Tony," he said and reached for the seat belt.
Steve's heart thudded hard against his breastbone, but he was able to get control over himself and scowl at Natasha. "Don't say it like that."
"We're not making a sex tape."
"Sorry," Steve said but looked anything but. "Didn't mean to disillusion you."
He shook his head and yawned a little. "No," he said, "think I'll head down to the lab and work on some stuff. Have a list about a mile long of stuff I'm supposed to do for everybody."
"I'm sorry, Tony," Steve said, voice wrecked. "I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry."
"I would," Steve said, cutting into his thoughts, "but Nat's got some intel on a possible Hydra cell. She and Sam are heading out to do recon. I said I'd keep in contact. Figured you wouldn't want to be disturbed with my chatter, so I've got the tablet synced up with their comms. I'll handle it upstairs so you two don't have to listen to it."
"What?" he asked, not sure that he wanted to know what this 'grumpy cat' was.
"Hmm, yeah, I suppose— Hey, how do you even know these people?"
Steve rubbed his hands lightly over Tony's hips and thighs, kneading the tips of his fingers into the lace-covered flesh. "You can't just keep asking JARVIS to run scans for you, and you can't keep bothering Bruce. You need to go to someone that has experience with this sort of thing."
But sometimes, it was nice to be just a regular meat-and-potatoes kind-of-guy, which Steve was overwhelmingly.
Now, and speaking of those barnacles, why the hell weren't they making themselves at home in his penthouse like they did every other hour of the day? Oh, right. Because it was going for eight o'clock on a Friday night, and they all had lives.
Maybe they were.
It hadn't been an easy decision to make. He'd suffered through it, labored through it, run through the pros and cons of it in his head. The only 'pro' he could see to it was that Tony would get the life he deserved, not what little Steve could give him. It was odd that Howard didn't seem bothered by him in the least. Maybe he figured Tony was just going through an experimental period and Steve was but one in a long line of 'phases' he had to suffer through. Not to say Howard had
"Incidentally, another thing we do not tell Steve about. I mean, he knows, but let's not remind him."
"Now or never," he said. "Baby's sleeping. No one here to bother us—"
Steve frowned at him. "But I won the coin toss."
" Tony shouted at him, his voice going slightly screechy, and he groaned and rolled his eyes at the affront to humanity.
"Your girlfriend?" Barnes cut in. "Oh, I thought she was just 'a friend.' I didn't know you two were 'dating.'"
"Yeah, I'd like to see you deal with a dick this easily," he muttered. "Are they always so tender?"
"I don't either," Steve said in reply. "Can you stand? Your leg isn't broken or anything, is it?"
a matter of life and death for you. Look, I've known Doctor Ganford a long time. I trust her. She's very discreet, and she's very good. If I didn't know anyone that I trusted, yeah, I would bullshit my way through with you and hope for the best, but I trust her, Tony. She'll be good for you. She'll make sure everything's the way it should be and she won't run to the press with it."
"One cup isn't going to be the death of me, Steve!"
Tony turned to him and preened a little. "I made it."
"Is this me?" he asked, and Olivia nodded then pulled out another picture she'd done of Iron Man and War Machine. "These are nice. Can I keep them?"
The woman frowned in pity and disgust. "Ugh, the worst of the summer months! My oldest was a summer baby, too, and let me tell you! They didn't have air conditioning back then. It's not fun being sticky and sweaty and your belly out to here—" she held her hand several inches in front of her, "—so big you can't even see your feet!" She patted his arm. "You're lucky. You girls today have things we couldn't have dreamed of back in the day! You probably already know what you're having, don't you?"
was there — his Steve, his Steve back from the dead (where he never really had been) there with him and hold him and watch him tend to their newborn daughter and…
"I definitely feel the love," Bruce said then shoved a spoonful of muesli in his mouth. Hopefully, he hadn't noticed that there was some missing. Tony hadn't left any bits lying around, had he?
"I'm so sorry," Steve said and looked straight at Tony, the words coming out without a thought, though that didn't mean he didn't mean them. He was. He really was. He had no idea what had come over him, but he'd been so, so desperate to be inside of Tony, to fill him up, to pump him...
, Nat and Pepper and Hill put up with this shit on a regular basis. I have, like, one night of it, and I'm ready to lead a rally or join the cause. I honest-to-god— I mean, it's really got me reevaluating
Tony hedged for a brief moment, a slightly scared and selfish part of him not caring in the least about what Hydra was up to and wanting Steve to stay right at his side from that exact moment until well after this was all over and done with. The hell with the rest of the world.
But there was a strange look in Steve's eye, hungry and desperate, and he met Tony's gaze and said in a dark and low voice, "Touch yourself."
Steve had lessened his hold on Tony's hand, and by the time Steve was stepping onto the roadway, he'd completely lost his grip of Tony's hand. Tony just stood and watched as his husband took several more steps toward the friend that was taking several slow, cautious steps toward him, and like something out of some goddamned movie or fucking romantic comedy, they met square in the middle of the road, each standing on either side of the double yellow line.
Steve when it came to their relationship.
JARVIS replied.
they were supposed to stop this nutcase. He wasn't even sure
"The worst fucking traitor of all," the agent continued. "She definitely has a world of pain coming to her."
"I think he does."
"Future you doesn't seem to have that same opinion."
— how Steve actually felt about him.
Granted, that was what Steve wanted to hear and probably needed to hear, but never one to leave well-enough alone, he instead frowned at Tony and said, "Are you sure? Tony, I— I took a lot of —"
He continued to rub her back and shush her, and he didn't miss Rhodey's pointed look at him.
"Why is that always everyone's question?" Tony muttered as he turned back to the crowd. "Look, they both have their pluses and their minuses, all right? I don't— I can't say for absolute certain which one is better than the other because they both have their merits, OK? I mean, clearly, they're
"Put those on," Tony continued as though Steve wasn't lost in his own thoughts. "They want to see pictures of this? We're going to put them in a diabetic coma. Put that ribbon back on your head. That's the icing on the cake."
"Don't worry,
Cap just blinked at the whiplash-inducing change of subject. "Uh…" he said and reached up to scratch at the back of his head. "Yeah, I mean, it worked out well, I think. We work well as a team. Not sure how often we'll be needed—"
"You sold us out," Barnes said, sounding almost brokenhearted, the hard lines of his face going soft in his hurt — or his pretend hurt, at any rate.
Tony stifled a groan and rolled his eyes as he took a plate offered to him by Bruce. "What juice?"
"You and me both," Tony muttered in reply and then stepped aside of some personnel pushing another loaded gurney down the hall, accidentally bumping into someone in the process.
Oh, he damn well knew what he said. Dodger Stadium. To a guy that had spent his summers hanging out at that ballpark that, in Brooklyn, was called Ebbets Field. But he knew Steve couldn't even get the words out, the very idea of the Dodgers in California disgusting him so, and he watched as Steve squirmed and scowled and pursed his mouth and flexed his hands as he fought through his frustration of 'those bums' having the audacity to ditch Flatbush for greener pastures.
He shrugged again.
He talked about damned near everything but Tony.
"Hey, I'll have you know our shift has the best safety rating going three years in a row," Bucky said. "And no, Clint's working for some other security firm."
"And I believe her friend, Darcy, would very much wish to attend as well."
"Is it in the ceiling?" Barnes asked and pointed, and Tony just shook his head a little and turned his attention to Steve.
"Yeah," he said and yawned, fighting to keep his eyes open. "You guys are needed more elsewhere. I'll be fine. JARVIS can monitor my vitals — you know, in case I stroke out or start to hemorrhage or something."
Steve just shook his head, and he closed up the book and shoved it at Tony. "Here."
Tony pushed close to him. "I have to
"JARVIS is going to help me?" he asked doubtfully.
He shifted a little to allow for Natasha to work at a particularly tensed knot in his back, and she followed, her fingers digging in and massaging at the right pressure.
" he was eventually able to gasp out through his laughter after he was able to catch his breath a moment. "
Tony met his eye, and he smiled a little and said with only the smallest amount of emotion mucking up his voice, "Are you even real?"
Tony just grumbled again about, "You and that goddamned phone," and began to clean up the mess again while Olivia got up and toddled over to Steve, dragging the toy telephone with her — not by the lead but by the receiver. She held her arms out to him, and he reached down and scooped her up then plopped her onto the cushion beside him.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut again and bit down hard on his lip.
cool," Rhodey assured him, and Tony couldn't help telling the gang, "You might even say he
Rhodey just blinked at her, and he looked between her, then Steve and Tony, then Jane and Thor, then back to an innocent-looking Darcy before he shook his head and said, "I'm out," and walked away, leaving Darcy to beam like an undefeated champion in his wake.
"Wait, let me get this straight." He pointed to Tony. "He gets to stuff his face with gelato while I have to look for Baron von Evil-Doer—"
can do better?" Olivia, cute though she may have been, wasn't exactly fighting it, but she wasn't making it easy for him, either, struggling to get to her toys the entire time, and Tony finally grumbled out, "
Tony went to respond, but he spotted an innocent-looking Barton standing just behind Bruce, still twirling that small, wrapped box in his hands, and realization dawned as he turned back to Bruce.
"Uh, no, honey, she's not mad at you."
Bruce stood back a moment and folded his arms. "How? How do you know that?"
"In general or as a son-in-law?"
, and I'll bet you anything it's his."
"It still counts," she said and took hold of his hands before she went up on her toes and kissed his cheek. "Thank you so much for coming. It means the world to me to have Bruce and his friends here."
"Imply that I, an obviously pregnant woman, am really Tony Stark —
"So, when are the others set to make their triumphant return?"
Almost as soon as they arrived home, Steve had to turn right back around and head out with the team to take down what turned out to be another Hydra cell, and as Steve went to apologize and remind Tony that, no, he didn't feel comfortable having him out there, Tony just grinned and said, "You know, after my freak-out, I suddenly realized I don't
Tony just sighed a little, and he leaned against Steve, resting his cheek against Steve's arm just below his shoulder. "This is a mess, isn't it? This whole thing. God, I should have just stayed holed up in the tower for nine months until this all blew over."
"See?" he said and turned back to Steve. "She intended for this to happen. We didn't have a choice in the matter. So, stop fucking blaming yourself for this. I'm the one that has to actually has to let this happen to me unless I want to
…never would.)
"Don't worry, doll-baby. Daddy's fine," he said, pulling her hands away from his bloodied and bruised face. Tony only noticed then that his uniform was more disheveled than he'd seen on first glance, torn and bloodied in a few places — and was his shield magnetized to his back or something?
"I didn't order out. I cooked it myself—" He looked to the four-year-old shoving the last bite of toast into her mouth. "Isn't that right, kiddo?"
"And we used to have lots of hot, sweaty sex where you used to ride my—"
"I think it's kind of fitting," Steve said with a blasé shrug.
"Yeah," he said, snapping out the word with more annoyance than he meant, "because that's all I am, right? Just a lab experiment that has to spend the rest of my life paying back all the time and effort and money that was invested in me."

imply that Steve's disposition left much to be desired.
" She shrugged and shook her head some, as though that would suffice for an answer. Tony shook his head some to match her befuddlement before she added, "He
at that stuff!" he offered as a defense.
"I know what you said, Bruce! Jesus Christ, is that—" He looked at the monitor, and he squinted his eyes, and if he…if he looked at it the right way, if he purposely looked for what he thought he was seeing…
But Olivia didn't answer, and Tony figured it was because she had fallen asleep on him, his daughter, his baby girl.
"Is that a good thing?" he asked because he honestly didn't know if it was or not, and Tony just shrugged.
She grinned at him, toothy and smarmy. "What makes you think we haven't already?"
"Yeah? Well, clearly she's not happy with me — if she even recognizes me, which, let's face it, she doesn't because I haven't looked or sounded like this since long before she was born."
He just swallowed and said with a bit of a bitter laugh, "I really fucked up this time, didn't I?"
Tony sighed and sat up a little, struggling to get there, but getting there eventually. "I just assumed we were. I know what I initially said about not being able to be a parent, but I— I'm willing to try. I want to try."
"Just you 'n me 'n Daddy 'n Maddie. We all live in th' big apartment. And then it d'pends. Anna Tasha and Unca Bucky stay sometimes, and Wanda 'n Vision are here sometimes, 'n Unca Bruce is here a lot, 'n Unca Hawky stays here sometimes, 'n Unca Sam is here a lot, 'n Unca Rhodey stays sometimes, 'n Unca Thor stays a lot." She shrugged. "Lotsa 'vengers stay here."
"Return?" Barton said and looked up at him. "Where the hell'd you go? You were just here a couple hours ago."
"No," Bruce said with a curt shake of his head. "There's no discussion here. Until that drug gets mostly metabolized by your body, I don't want you feeding her."
"I am."
He turned to his plate and dug into his food, and Tony just pulled the sixth waffle off the iron and said, "We'll find a way."
"So, if you're an alien, where's your ray gun?" he'd asked him one time.
Thor settled onto the couch, taking the seat closest to where Steve sat, and he leaned forward some like he was aiming to conspire with Steve and said, "Might we have a word later alone? There is something I wish to discuss with you."
The doors closed, and after a moment, Natasha added, "I mean, I think you really gave Steve a punch in the gut, but the other guys are OK."
imply?
" And then, determined and resolute, "
"All right, kiddo. Time to—"
Steve just shot him a pitiful and abashed look, but Tony turned to the assembled crowd and said from out of nowhere, "Hey, what name do you think 'Maddie' is short for?"
"Look, it's no big deal! We'll go out, we'll have dinner, we'll laugh and we'll chat, and if anyone says boo about it, we'll turn on them for daring to parrot the bullshit that men and women can't just be friends with each other. They always have to be having sex."
Steve just shrugged again as a cheery voice called out, "Knock, knock!" and they both turned to see the woman they could only presume was the doctor enter the room. "Hi," she said, all bright smiles as she extended her hand to shake, "I'm Doctor Ganford. You must be
"I'm sorry, Steve. I didn't know my eyebrows offended you so much. Oh, and my moustache, too. Funny, you seem to be OK with facial hair when I have a cock. But now that I don't, suddenly, you're completely offended by my imperfections."
"Mine," Steve said, brown and blue locking in together. "Always."
Truth be told, the pelvic exam wasn't the most offensive thing ever to be done to him. It didn't hurt, and it was over pretty quickly, and the doctor assured him everything was as it should be.
"Yeah, well," Tony said as he pulled away. "Was starting to think you were trying to get yourself a Tony pancake there."
"Do you have anything?"
"So, when do you want to put in for our usual Christmas feast?"
He shot them both annoyed and perplexing looks before he muttered, "Whatever, fine, I'll get it. Is this it?"
Tony sighed again and glanced away. "Right," he said, more to himself than to Steve, "you thought this was all Hydra's doing."
"Whatever," he muttered and sat back in the chair some. "So, are you calling me 'fat' or not?"
"Look, it's either this or a lunch date, and I'll make you take me to one of those really fancy, high- end places where the entire entrée fits on a teaspoon."
He squirted a few dollops of ketchup on to the eggs, and she went about doing the rest, grabbing her fork and mixing it in so it looked like some sort of horrendous orange concoction that was a massive offense to anyone with taste buds. Or sight.
Tony pulled the freshly-baked cookies out of the oven and set the hot sheet on top of the stove, and he looked at Steve and made a face and said, "What's gotten into you?"
He turned back around.
" Tony just closed his eyes and settled back down against Steve, his head pillowed against Steve's broad, muscled pecs, and he exhaled a breath and snuggled closer to Steve, putting his arm over Steve's waist as Steve felt him drift off again.
"Look, could we maybe not tell my mom I'm an Avenger yet? And, what— I still do counseling, all right? I just—"
Wait a second.
"All things considered?" he said (she said?) and sighed a little. "I suppose I've been worse."
"Clint."
that. "You just…shouldn't waste it. It's not like there's a— It's not like there's an infinite supply."
," Steve muttered like Tony was exaggerating the point. "Yeah, well, that's what I have you for."
"Not the worst thing I've seen you do," Tony said as Steve burned red with humiliation. "Not the worst thing you've seen me do, either."
"Jesus, I can't do this."
There was a funny charge of something in the air after that. Something was up, and Tony knew something was up, even if Bruce denied it and Wilson shrugged and said, "No idea, man," and Rhodey shook his head and said he didn't know what he was talking about. Thor just looked puzzled and looked up at the ceiling when Tony made the mistake of literally asking him, "What's up?" He was certain Thor was being deliberately obtuse at that, though he was tempted to tell the guy that 'gullible' was written on the ceiling and see what came of that.
"Uh, yeah," Tony said, stepping out of the shadows. Both Barnes and the Hydra agent looked over to him. "I think in order to be a 'traitor,' you have to have been a willing participant in the organization to begin with. Don't think brainwashing counts."
"Sure," Cap said, "well, uh, take care, I guess. Sorry, again."
"Oh," Bruce said, crossing the distance between them as Natasha stepped on the elevator and left for parts unknown. "You are up."
, Steve. Besides, I
"No," Barton said after a moment. "Just saying."
She nodded and reached into her small clutch, pulling out what looked like a keycard of some kind. She held it out to him and said, a hint of a smile on her lips, "Key to your room, Mr. Roth."
it, Papa."
He jumped up, joints cracking, and scurried into the kitchen before Olivia could say anything that would really get him into trouble. He trusted Rhodey to keep her in the living room until he could return. "So, uh, what do you need?" he asked when he got to sanctuary. "I take it you didn't call just to exchange some pithy and sexually-charged banter."
Did she… Did she just call him
date!"
"All right," Barton said with a sigh and leaned over Tony to fiddle with the releases. The suit opened up, and Tony sat up, breathing in fresh air and suddenly realizing that he'd kind of been short on oxygen.
Natasha considered this, tilting her head as she looked him over, and she reached out and touched the dark tendrils of hair that fell over his shoulders and said, "You already are pretty. You need a little touching up here and there, but to be honest, Stark, you really do make for a good-looking woman."
Steve took a step closer but didn't touch him. "That's not true."
"Son-of-a-bitch," he said and opened his eyes more fully to take in the results.
have been talking about you?" Sam asked. "Is it a reference to anything you two had talked about?"
"Hmm...in how your kind defines it, yes, I suppose so."
Steve pointed over his ensemble. "That cute little top you've got there with the little bow on the side and, uh — what are they called? — Capri pants?"
body… He wrote '1.'
Steve tried to picture what Tony was explaining to him, but he was having a hard time with it, and so Tony pushed at the surface like he was typing something out. After a moment, he turned the cellphone to Steve, and Steve saw himself in full color, that shorter haircut, and dressed in ridiculously casual clothes, especially considering that he appeared to be sitting for an interview with some woman that was asking him questions about his personal life. He watched as this identical stranger smiled at the woman — and he recognized that smile as his 'polite' smile that he gave when he really wanted to pick a fight — and explained in answer to the question of 'Is Captain America gay?'—
too old for you."
"Are you done?" Steve asked, throaty and thick with desire.
"Happy?" Tony asked, and Steve exhaled a breath of relief. "Yeah. Thanks."
As Tony crunched on his cracker, Rhodey opened his mouth to say something, but Steve cut in before he could.
," he murmured again, the apples of his cheeks tingeing pink.
"Clean up."
"But you wanted to suck brain, too."
"Am I that predictable?" Steve asked, sheepish, like he'd already been formulating his speech in his head.
He shrugged. "We know something bad is going to happen? We do what we can to prevent it."
"You sounded
"Yeah, but, whatever it is—" He let go of Tony's hands to reach up and cup Tony's face, and he brought his mouth down to Tony's in a sweet, tender, and slightly heated kiss, running the tip of his tongue over the length of Tony's bottom lip to get him to part his mouth and offer entrance.
Tony shrugged, and Steve frowned a little as he considered this.
Tony hadn't gotten that from it. The sweet, yes, but not vanilla. "So, not terrible?" he said, and Steve shook his head.
not a bad innuendo of some kind and had actually, literally happened once before. Tony had actually thought it was kind of funny and deserved; Steve had been the killjoy to level Thor with his Stare of Disapproval and guilt him into removing the hammer.
Natasha took the seat next to Barton while Bruce took the seat on Barton's other side. That left two seats on either side of Tony, one of which was Steve's and the other, if he was remembering Pepper's instructions the right way, was for Rhodey.
Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw Bruce close his eyes and mutter an

Barton nodded his agreement, and Barnes looked between them and said, "
His daughter. His fucking daughter. Not that he'd ever believed — all right not since he was a kid — in a god (OK,
"I don't know. Open to a page and pick a name at random."
He wasn't sure how long ago that had happened. It felt like hours; it was probably one at the most. Natasha and Barnes were still down there with him. Bruce evidently didn't think JARVIS and DUM-E were enough support for him. It was the only reason why he could figure Natasha, at the least, was down there with him and not in the madhouse where she could be of better use.
"You think bottles of Heinz grow on trees?" Tony asked as Wilson shoved the eggs into his mouth.
sheepish. "Well, I mean, you
Tony shrugged. "Fits the profile."
But he'd actually, not long before they'd started dating, asked Steve about his relationship with him and how he really felt for the guy, and he'd seen no reason for Steve to lie about it. They hadn't been dating then. There'd been nothing for him to lose. Steve had said Barnes was his best pal and the guy that had pulled him out of the fire more times than he could count. He'd said he'd owed that same courtesy to Barnes in return, but the one time Barnes had needed him to save him, he hadn't been able to. He'd failed his friend in a way that his friend had never failed him. And he knew that that was what drove Steve now to search out his friend. He needed to put right what had gone wrong. He couldn't hold that against the guy. He was certain if he was in Steve's position, he would have felt the same.
, boo-boo?"
"Tony—"
"Or see us," Steve cut in.

The party began to disperse once the fireworks were all said and done — a
"Uh, I don't remember this."
attesting to it!" he yelled, and Steve reached out and put a hand on his arm to calm him. "Look, do you want to know what's really going on?"
"Hey," he whispered in an attempt to push those thoughts far from his mind. "How're you doing? Are you OK?"
Bruce paused his motions and shot a look at Tony.
"We're going to let this happen. It's not going to be easy, but we're going to figure it out. We're not even going to talk about the alternative. We're going to do this, and we're going to figure it out."
She folded her arms on the granite top and leaned her weight onto her elbows. "You remember who I work for, right?"
He left that blank.
, and that… would have been a little difficult to explain to the attendees. Or it
Steve glanced down at his belly, and he just hummed a little before he leaned in and gave Tony a gentle kiss on the mouth. "You look beautiful to me," he said, his voice just above a whisper.
"Yeah, bullshit," Barton said and yelled out, "Hey, Cap! Wanna grab me a bottle of water on your way back?"
"Nuts," Steve replied and snapped his fingers, a bit of a smirk on his face as the elevator doors opened for him. "Shoulda been unfrozen sooner."
"Oh, I'm going to be sick," Bruce moaned from the back seat.
Bucky continued to complain about his slight, but Steve stopped listening beyond the 'gonna be around forever' bit. He stole a glance over at Thor, who conveniently was watching whatever corny little stop-animation thing was on the TV and thus wouldn't or couldn't make eye contact with him, and he thought about what Thor had said — about outliving his family, watching his loved ones grow old and wither, the offer to live out his days on Asgard — and he suddenly began to feel very...cold.
"Too late. It's that's our official and legal name now, though you're right. That
His heart raced so fast and beat so hard Steve thought it was about to burst right out of his chest, and he swallowed and took slow, measured steps to grab his chocolate bar and get the hell out of there without his companion noticing.
Oh. Right. Cabin. Finger Lakes. Accidentally told some reporter he was pregnant with Captain America's kid.
"Well, he
there was no excuse for it. There was no reason in the world for this to be as god-awfully painful as it was, and he understood now why some reactionary sorts implied pregnancy and childbirth was a woman's punishment for daring to have sex.
Steve looked away from Tony at that but said nothing to it.
. Again, twenty-first century, and sometimes, your own hand is your best friend."
"What was it?"
Steve just nodded like he'd fully expected Tony to say that.
period. Fucking selfless act that was going to bite him in the ass in some way.
JARVIS didn't say anything, and Steve directed Olivia's attention to the rain droplets splattered on the window for only a moment before he felt her tense up in his arms a little, and he looked down at her and said, "Really?"
Evidently not.
Tony was busy puttering around, humming to himself as he set up a plate of bagels and some small containers that, well, Steve didn't know what they were. As Tony turned and reached into a cabinet, Steve craned his neck to check out the goods and saw something about 'cream cheese' printed over the foil cover of the container. He shrugged as Tony turned back around, two mugs in hand, and said, "Can never have enough coffee," then set them on the counter and went over to another counter where some apparatus was…brewing coffee, maybe? It didn't look like a vacuum pot nor one of those French press things he'd seen, but the scent was unmistakable.
Rhodey turned immediately, almost like he was readying up for a fight of some kind, and he stuttered out a few non-responses before he turned back to whatever dumb shit Barton and Bruce were discussing.
, if that's what you're worried about. Mostly about how stubborn you are."
"Don' ev'n star'!" Tony said through a mouthful of breaded chicken drenched in red sauce. He chewed a few more times then swallowed the bite and said, "I swear to god, Steve, if you knocked me up again—"
Steve just stared at him some more, and he smiled and clasped his hands to his chest, the gesture, he was hoping, coming off humble and slightly submissive.
, and even though there was something about something tearing, and even though he was pretty sure all sorts of disgusting things had passed out of him already, and even though he felt like he couldn't do it anymore, he just gave one last push, and before he knew it, through a literal amalgam of blood, sweat, and tears, there was the unmistakable cry of new life.
certain things, but he was green with that sort of shit, and I get the feeling that agent wasn't. I don't mean to call her character into question. She was—" He whistled. "Steve knew how to pick 'em." He then added knowingly to Tony, "I guess he still does."
And gotten knocked up.
, he hadn't
"Yours, too," Pepper murmured. "Captain America
"OK," he said with a nod. "OK. Come on. Let's get out of the dirt."
Steve shut the tablet off and set it on the nightstand again, and he reached out and snagged an arm around Tony's waist to pull him against him. Tony went with it, cuddling up against Steve, and Steve brushed light fingertips over his body as he said, "Please. Just…go to an obstetrician? I've been talking about it with Bruce, and he agrees with me—"
he'd said it that way on purpose so they would take it that way.
"I know," he said, finding to his surprise that the words stung just a little bit. He'd wanted to be done with the pretending and the charades, but now that the end had dawned for good, he found he maybe wasn't
Steve nodded, swallowing, and he moved his hands from Tony's shoulders and reached up to cup his face. Holding Tony there gently, carefully, like Tony was the most precious thing ever to exist for him, he leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead, and he brushed either of his thumbs over Tony's cheeks and said, "I really mean it. I'm so proud of you. You're just…amazing…about this whole thing, and it could have been… I don't know anyone else that could have done it as well as you did."
"Honey, I'm not sure that's such a good—"
"Did he say that to you?" Bruce asked again.
…but I can still feel him. I can still— He's alive. I know he's alive. I can still feel that he's alive. I don't— I can't explain it, but I just
He went over and turned the water on, and he pulled the stopper on the faucet to redirect the water to the showerhead. He pulled the curtain to close up the shower then sat down on the edge of the tub and waited a moment before he let out a soft and quiet moan.
"Esmeralda, enough!" Thor yelled, more annoyed than angry, and Steve just stood beside Tony, arms folded and jaw set.
"Well, don't say it too loudly or she'll be back to wreak havoc on our lives once again. I think one of us getting ourselves in trouble is more than enough."
"Maybe he just didn't meet the right one yet," Tony said with a shrug only to receive a very flat look from Steve. "I'm just saying. We started out by taking pot-shots at each other on a Helicarrier. Now look at us: old and married and set in our ways."
" Barton said before Steve could say anything in reply. "What about us? We don't want to see that crap any more than she does."
"You know I'm not saying this as 'Captain America,' right? This is one hundred percent Steve Rogers talking."
"I'm saying I just need you and me and a nice evening in," he replied around the bite, and Tony nodded and parsed the words for what he could make out from them. He hadn't denied that he
Tony grumbled and snatched the box from him, and he ripped the paper off and tossed it to the floor. He examined the small, plain, white box, turning it over in his hands, before he opened it from the top and slid out the protective Styrofoam insert, handing the empty box to Steve, who just set it on the coffee table. He pulled at the tape to unbind the two pieces of Styrofoam then separated them to reveal a small and delicate little keepsake Elsa from
"Uh…you know anyone else that calls you that?"
"Uh, actually, I was just about to see about lunch," he replied. When he'd just come out of the ice, he might have put off his wants to spend time with Thor — afraid of saying no and not really having anything better to do. But he'd worked off some of his excess energy, and it was time to go see his family again, and even Captain America wasn't crazy about working in any way on Christmas Eve.
Natasha just nodded at this then said, "Can you promise me something?"
It had taken him a long time after Afghanistan to even be able to tolerate water to any large degree. Showers were definitely easier than baths to deal with, though. Being under a spray wasn't quite as bad as the possibility of being held under a tub of water — not that anything of the like had happened to him since then, but it was hard to shut off that way of thinking once it had formed under duress no matter how little water he filled the tub with or how many times he checked and double-checked to make sure there were no threats in the vicinity. Things had definitely gotten better or easier for him, but he wasn't sure there would ever be a time that he wouldn't have some niggling fear at the back of his mind, some little thought that played over those horrible memories time and again.
Tony blew out a breath. "Oh. Well, I was kind of banking on him
that Steve was still alive when everyone was telling him he was dead didn't count. Because he hadn't
"I, uh, didn't want to give this to you downstairs. Especially now that I see we're friends with a bunch of assholes that think speedos with a shield right over the crotch are an appropriate birthday gift."
"Clearly, you never saw the way Howard used to treat me."
"What?" Steve asked as Tony took a gulp of his beverage.
For ten years now, he had shared the bedchamber of the King, even though he had been given his own quarters in the castle. He was far and away the King's closest confidant, and the Council had only themselves to blame. Had they gotten rid of the Earl as soon as the new King had been crowned, they could have saved themselves all this trouble—
"OK," he said as Steve sat away from him and went back to poking at his dinner, "those are the two unsexiest words you have ever spoken. Barton is never right about anything."
"I, uh, may not have told
He sighed out a breath of relief as the doors closed, but JARVIS cut in, "
Steve couldn't help but snort a laugh. "Team Stony?"
"So?"
"How?" he asked before he could help himself. "We wore disguises."
"They're probably just being nice," he said with an easy shrug.
"You called it 'highway robbery,' and you bitched about the entire menu. You made them
," she said, nodding and drawing out the word like she understood completely.
"Punching you in the junk?" he muttered as he rubbed his shin, but clearly he wasn't loud enough because the guy just said, "Give me five minutes on the floor. I'll rock your world."
"Snow tires, babe." He glanced over just in time to see Steve's confusion. "Oh," he said with a laugh, "you've probably never heard of all-season radials, either."
"Yeah, but Stark-Rogers
But that was a concern for another time because he had other things to deal with — parties to plan and presents to get and friendships to help mend, which all kind of came crashing into each other at one point. It was as he was putting on the finishing touches to his decorating scheme one morning about a week before when Barnes showed up in his lab, confusion written all over his face.
"It is as I said: you are life, you are creation. You have always been, and you forever will be."
"Wait, seriously?"
Steve went back to the table, and Tony followed the instructions to prep the bottle, and after he capped it, he went to start shaking it to mix, but he figured Steve needed to do his good parenting deed of the day, and so he shoved the bottle at Steve and said, "Here, shake this."
She put her hand on his forearm and gave it a gentle squeeze. "You knew what he was like when you started this."
Tony shrugged at him and picked up his glass of water. "It is tradition," he said and took a sip.
stuck like this the rest of my life, it makes sense how we also got Maddie."
"Think we're good, Jolly Green," Tony said. "If someone wants to collect our injured leader, however, and take him on back to the 'jet for Banner to patch up, though, I'd appreciate it."
Steve looked around, and when he couldn't give Tony the answer straightaway, Tony huffed and shoved his bag at him and said, "Whatever. Watch my stuff. I'll be right back."
Tony shot a bemused look at him, and Bruce just shrugged but didn't take back what he'd said. "Whatever," he said and turned to leave.
with!" he said quickly, lest Tony suspect anything tawdry or untoward about what he'd done in the past. "But you're not the first fella I ever…
Welch sat back a little. "Why, Captain! How unbefitting of your rank and standing."
"Yeah, well, hopefully they don't dry-rot before we get to use all of them."
"Stop trying to make it sound cooler than it is!"
Tony glanced over, cutlery still on Steve's plate, and said, "Why? You don't like it?"
He sat up a little, halfway through building a sandwich with the eggs, toast, and bacon, and he watched some images flash on the screen from previous gala events that he'd attended with the other Avengers.
"If anything ever happens, and you revert back to the way you were before the war, I'll totally revise that to short, scrawny, and ornery."
"No," Tony said and stepped closer, now resolute, the coffee left forgotten on the counter behind him. "Why would you think that? What made you think I wanted you to break up with me?"
"Oh, well, pat yourself on the back," Tony muttered, but Steve heard something in that that Tony didn't, and he stared at Welch and said, "You have heard things then."
Tony sniffed in annoyance and went over toward the elevator, bypassing the scattered pile of drawings on the coffee table.
like Bruce?"
Tony arched an eyebrow. "I'm getting the feeling you're going to say 'but' here."
She just smiled at him, gummily and happily, then shoved a hand in her mouth and began to gnaw on her fingers. Steve watched a moment before he turned back to the cupboards and muttered, "I guess I should feed you," narrowing his eyes and pursing his lips as he opened doors in search of the formula.
He quirked his head a little in bemusement, and when he went over to look at Rhodey's phone, he was greeted with the grinning faces of Pepper and Happy, both smooshed into the frame and what he took to be some part of Pepper's office just barely visible in what little could be seen of the background.
He watched as Steve set the card down on the small table in the vestibule then went into the adjacent living room, also already burning lights. As Tony followed him into the living room, Steve unbuttoned his tux jacket and tossed it over the back of one of the chairs then turned back to him and said, "Said you needed to pee, right?"
, you know I—"
"It's not. It's purely selfish. But still, it's not such a bad idea. I suddenly have a new appreciation for all the shit people like Natasha and Hill and Pepper go through on a daily basis. I feel like I should do something about it. What's Gloria Steinem doing these days?"
"I'm never going to get used to that."
"That was painless," Natasha said, and Tony shrugged.
Tony just grinned at him, smirking as though to say,
"You mean you really believed me?"
Once the table was cleared, the wait staff brought out plates and forks and the rejected wedding cake Hill had bought for them the day before, and Steve once again reminded them that they
"Not sold on the 'Abby Normal' one, huh?" Tony asked as he went with it, slotting himself into that perfect space that had been carved into Steve's frame just for him.
Tony was right. It didn't take two-and-a-half hours. Between getting him back into the bedroom to put some underwear on, drying his hair, styling his hair, doing his makeup, and getting him into the dress and situated so that the tie sat just under his left breast like so (because of course that's the way all of these dresses worked — evidently it looked 'cute' or something) and the rest of the material draped over his belly the way it should have, it took exactly two hours and seventeen minutes.
"Well?" Natasha asked, and Tony turned to her, a little in awe, and said, "I think it'll work."
But Steve continued to rub his belly, and he said, "I think I remember something about something we were going to do when we got back to the cabin before? Sorry it didn't work out but, uh, if you're up to it later on maybe? I'd very much like to watch."
Bruce grimaced. "Why do I think I don't want to know what you guys are talking about?"
. He still stole more glances at men than women — glances he immediately erased from memory — and he still dreamt more about lithe, lean, muscular bodies than soft, supple, curvy ones. If going purely by looks alone, he was more inclined to give Howard Stark a generous look-over than Peggy, though while he liked and trusted Stark, he operated on such a completely different wavelength than the rest of the world that Steve didn't think he'd ever have a chance of getting through to him about anything more personal than the paint scheme for his shield.
Thanks, everyone, that's left comments so far. I thoroughly appreciate them, and I'm humbled by how many people seem to actually remember this story, lol! I promise to get to them in the coming days or weeks, but being An Adult™ and also contracting some sort of killer cold are eating up most of my time at the moment.
Though she just continued to tug it around that way, anyway.
Natasha pursed her lips at Bucky, her eyes flat, and Steve knew that wasn't the end of the conversation, but she turned back to Sam and continued, "Anyway, Pepper's looking for wedding venues, and I was telling her about this one. She was intrigued, so I told her to stop by and I'd show her around."
Tony just snorted a laugh. "Yeah, let's have this conversation again after you've been woken up by her at all hours of the morning or been upchucked on by her or have lost years off your life worrying because she went tumbling head-first into Dummy's chassis."
Tony shared a look with Steve before he turned back to Bruce. "Wait, you think this is flirting?"
weight on."
I'm sorry was
"Because they —
"You want me to help you play dress-up?" she asked as he took the napkin but didn't do anything with it.
He shut Steve up by grabbing him by his shirt front and hauling him in for a kiss.
"Isn't it?" she asked but wasn't looking at him.
"Make love," Tony finished for him with a knowing arch of his eyebrow.
This seemed to pique Steve's interest or concern, and he frowned a little before he said, "JARVIS, mute the TV," and turned his full attention on Tony, the sound on the TV cutting off as he did so. He raked his gaze all over Tony's face before he said, "You want to stay like this?"
Steve shifted his gaze back to Tony and watched as the program mapped out the contours of his body, Steve's own artist's eye soaking in each and every dip and curve of Tony's new figure and itching to draw what he found — from the jut of his chin to the peak of an erect nipple to the soft curve of his abdomen to the small mound of hair — and nothing else — between his legs.
and Steve reached up and took the little article of clothing out of his hands and said, "Nat's right. She's our daughter. She could easily do both if she wanted. There's no question she'll be smart enough and talented enough to."
The guy just laughed, using his strength against Tony as he just pushed right back, holding him against the wall by his hips. "Not an exhibitionist, huh?"
He looked over the room, the presents beneath the tree and the stockings on the mantle and the bows and garlands and lights and tried to catalogue it all. He didn't know where he'd be tomorrow morning, but just in case—
"This the sort of shit you learn flipping houses?"
"Would it— Would you— Could we— Would it be possible—"
Tony would have face-palmed if he didn't have a mug of coffee in his hand that he was afraid of spilling due to the sheer force of the shockwave that would ensue from his forehead meeting his palm.
"No. Not— Just— Just for this. Only if I put this collar on. Otherwise, you're still Tony — you're still
her 'Papa' and not just some piss-poor alternate universe substitute.
"What? No, no, nothing like that. No, just the placenta…"
Pepper put her own window down, but Tony motioned them away again, and Pepper said, "Are you sure?"
He swallowed and moved to sit down, hot, burning interest stirring within him again, and he blew out a breath and tore his gaze away from Tony, doing his best to think of the most abominable things imaginable in order to stave off the sudden hardening of his errant cock.
"Well, it's not…
She went over and began to show the assistant what
Too wonderful to be bothered by Pepper's admittedly understandable ire with his life choices. It maybe hadn't been his smartest idea, and maybe Steve shouldn't have gone along with it, but what was done was done and there was nothing they could do to change it. Pepper would smooth it over with the board. That was why she got paid the big bucks, and Tony didn't doubt her abilities to ply them with believable excuses for a minute.
"I agree," Steve replied. "I've been on my own since I was eighteen. Yeah, I've still got Bucky in my life, but not a day goes by I don't wish I could I could see my ma one more time. I wish she could have met you. I wish she could have seen the baby — and she's going to have at least one of us to drive her nuts until well into her middle age whether she likes it or not."
And then Natasha's hands were on his face, stroking, and she murmured something in Russian at him then said, "Tony, do you really want me to get him? He could be gone and back before anything even happens."
"Whatever," he muttered and sat back against the chair. "Order up some bras in the right size. It does feel a little…unprotected without one."
"Tony, listen—"
He'd already stopped believing this was some nefarious Hydra plot, but if he hadn't, he was pretty sure that would have done the trick. He didn't know this Tony from Adam — not really — and yet he could tell that Tony meant everything he'd said with every fiber of his being. Like he knew his name, rank, and serial number, he knew that Tony, well,
"So," he said when he was able to get control of himself once more, "does Uncle Hawky have a bow and arrow?"
Thankfully, not busy at all.
"He always did have the attention span of a flea," Bucky said, and Steve rolled his eyes and crawled out from under the desk again. "Seriously, pal," he added as Steve sat down in his chair again. "Way to throw yourself on a grenade. You're an inspiration to everyone everywhere."
She weighed her response then said, "Not…" She blinked and smiled at him and then patted his hand once again. "Makes me feel better about certain…conclusions about things I've come to as well."
it. And maybe that sounded like the ravings of a mad person in complete denial over what he'd just been told, but for some reason, that felt important to him. He didn't
"You—" he swallowed, "—you can do that?"
Esmeralda? He should probably watch what he said about her just in case.
"You better hope nothing like this ever happens to you because I will not be nearly as kind," he said and then
a caveman then padded back out of the bathroom and into the lab.
Tony blinked at him. "Uh, what?"
He went to reply that it was because it hadn't been anyone's business prior to this, but before he could, Steve said with a bit of wonder and realization, "That wasn't a TV in the background."
"About what?"
"Pym?" Tony asked, startled. "Where the hell would she even have heard that name?"
"Oh," Steve said and scoffed, "baloney. You never don't have at least
"Hmm..."
"No! No, nothing like that!" Tony said, lest Steve think he was hemorrhaging or something equally awful. "Just… You said you wanted a boy. Are you disappointed?"
"Hmm...yes, but you have since made me promise that I cannot do anything to him without first seeking his permission. If you wish to be that selfish, Captain, I think it would be best to ensure that your bonded wishes to live out the ages with you before you make that decision for him."
"Oh, god, Tony, no, no, don't cry. Honey, it's OK. We'll get Steve. It'll be OK."
fucking idiots."
Olivia nodded. "Yeah, they're good, Papa. Be better if they were Daddy's shield."
Jesus Christ, he'd been pregnant from the word 'go,' hadn't he?
This Tony also had some generator of some kind powering his heart. Product of an ordeal he'd undergone several years ago as the prisoner of some band of mercenaries. He didn't really have all the details on that, though at the least he could say that from what he understood, it was the kind of experience one usually learned from — the kind of experience that would get a man to turn over a new leaf. He didn't know what this Tony had gotten out of that experience, but it certainly didn't appear to be anything other than a weaponized metal suit he taunted the government with and used to 'privatize' peace, whatever that meant.
"And we're both still alive and in perfect health," Tony said and took a gulp of his black liquid god. The coffee went down OK, but that bacon. He glanced over to where Steve stood tending to the sizzling strips of pork product. Ugh.
you keep the Cap around here?"
having the advantage now. I like being the bigger one. It's… It's nice."
She moved her hand a little so that she could trail a finger down his cheek — almost like she was caressing him — and he jerked his chin away with as much fight as he had left in him and said, struggling to get the words out as things began to go a little blurry and woozy, "Isn't that…sw— uh, swee— sweet? The family…legacy." The more he tried to fight it, the more he felt as though he was caught in a fog — a jellied fog, if such a thing existed, his legs wobbly and his arms just not cooperating with what he wanted to do.
"Well, he is the mother of his child," Wilson said with a shrug. "It's gotta count for something."
Steve just shot him a pointed look.
He jerked his thumb at Welch at that, but Steve was just staring at the man, confusion reigning before he sat a little straighter and squared his ridiculously broad shoulders and said, "I've never laid one hand on you."
Tony snatched it off him. "You may stay."
needed Steve, damn it! He had more claim to him than any of those other sons-of-bitches, and he needed Steve to stay there and get him through this insanity.
"Yeah," he muttered, "it did seem that way, didn't it?"
"You went walking around Brooklyn again, didn't you?"
He shrugged. "Just an ache. Comes and goes. No big deal."
it. He liked how he looked, and he liked how he felt — pregnancy and post-pregnancy aches aside. He was comfortable and accepting of who he was, and he was anticipating really taking this body for a ride especially once his nursing days were over and he was safely on a birth control pill that would work with his and Steve's serum-altered body chemistries. Not only that, but he was looking forward to getting back to a 'figure' of sorts and playing dress-up to entice the public, to entice Steve, and, most importantly, to entice himself.
here, JARVIS."
It wasn't that he was scared to be left alone with Barnes — OK, maybe the idea put him a little on edge — but he didn't know him, well, at all, and he would have felt a little better maybe to have Steve there to somehow keep the peace between them. Tony was good at running his mouth, but he really did hate small talk — any kind, awkward or not — and he wasn't looking forward to making small talk with his husband's oldest friend that, up until almost a year ago, had been a brainwashed  assassin.
She pursed her lips and nodded, putting a finger to her mouth as she tilted her head in thought. "Yeah," she said.
Tony stared at her. "Why would you even think that?"
Steve sighed out a breath, and he reached out and put his hands on Tony's shoulders, the other four helping themselves to a tour of the room. "Tony," he said, "I appreciate it, and this really was thoughtful of you—"
She frowned but didn't let go of his hand. "Again?"
He stood up from his seat and reached over the table to grab the phone away from Wilson, who gave it up freely and easily for him. Steve sat back with a huff and looked over whatever Wilson had up on his screen. Evidently, he hadn't been lying (and Tony already knew he hadn't been lying because he'd read that bio cover-to-cover several times over back in his younger days) because Steve just frowned and said, "I really don't think it's necessary to say that my eyes crinkle a little at the corners when I smile."
Barnes shrugged a little, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Fuck's sake, I said sit still."
Steve was rather nonplussed by it as well. As first the leader of the Commandos during the war and now the leader of the Avengers, Steve was accustomed to ghastly sights. Plus, he grew up in the nascent days of modern medicine. Watching an actual childbirth was probably no more horrifying a sight than what he'd undergone as a kid in the naïve but well-intentioned attempt to cure him of what ailed him.
"So, in general she'd like me then?"
Tony just nodded, but as Steve reached out to help him up from where he sat, dogged determination drawn over his face, Tony could only think of one thing.
"Oh, great," Darcy murmured under her breath as she glanced away innocently. "The hall monitor's here."
Bruce let out a heavy sigh and said, "Steve's the kind of guy that likes to look directly at the person he's addressing."
. For making friends period, it sucked, and he couldn't even imagine how much more fucked up he would have been had he not been able to tuck himself under Rhodey's wing.
She padded around the living area and moved through the kitchen with ease. As Rhodey set the pies down on the island that doubled as an eating area, she went over the fridge and began to look over the contents before she said, "Papa, where's my juice?"
He maybe hadn't thought about it at the time, but looking back, he was pretty sure his mother had had a suspicion that he didn't just like girls. He did like girls. He'd always liked girls. It was just... he liked fellas, too. But it was easier to hide that and tamp those feelings down because he liked girls and he was just as happy to go out on a date with a girl (however...little...that happened). But he was pretty sure his mother knew that he'd looked at fellas, too (he maybe had left a tablet of sketches out in the open one time, and he was pretty sure that she'd found it — and this was before art school, so he couldn't even play it off as that), and so he was pretty sure she wouldn't be entirely surprised by the fact that Steve had taken up with a fella. Maybe a little disappointed, but not surprised. He was sure she'd like Tony, though — sure she'd like that Tony was sweet and kind and had a good head on his shoulders. And more than that, he was sure she'd like that Tony didn't take any of his shit and gave back as good as Steve gave him.
"Mmm… But you wanted a boy."
Barnes shrugged and reached out to grab another slice of bacon. "'Cause I'm not telling people to watch their language like some old grandma." He sat back and bit halfway into the slice, and he crunched on it before he pointed what was left of it at Steve and said, "You know, there really is a time and a place for that."
Natasha's lips twitched just the slightest. "He has plans for it. Says he's thinking about investing it."
Steve next shot a look at Pepper. "How much did her son donate?"
"I suppose I could have gone with 'Happy 98th Birthday, Aunt Millie.'"
"I'm sorry,
"Nat might have been," Steve said, but Bruce hedged some and said, "Yeah, but I think she got roped into refereeing the push-up competition."
Not that he couldn't do this without him. He could. Look, he may have had tits and a vagina and a super soldier spawn about ready to fall out of him (god, get
"Sorry, Tony," Bruce said and, just like the literature had said, set the baby down on his abdomen, "I know you and Steve were set on a boy, but it's a girl."
Tony made a 'whoop-de-do' motion with his hand, but Steve sucked in an audible breath. "What's that mean for us?" he asked, all business as always.
to do (though he was 99.99% sure he never would have chosen it or wanted it if presented with the opportunity), but being forced into it, being coerced into it, well, that was… He supposed there were words for that, but he really,
"She's four, Bruce. She's probably not aware of what's really going on."
Steve squeezed his hand a little, either in reassurance or relief. Tony couldn't be sure which. "Yeah?" he asked, and Bruce nodded.
"I mean, I didn't know it was
Rhodey just shook his head at him, more out of disappointment than anything else, and Barton cleared his throat to draw the attention back to him and said, "Yeah,
He pulled open the door and held it open for Tony, goofy, assured grin on his stupid face, and Tony scowled at him and stepped into the waiting room.
"You don't know that—"
"The fuck it does!" He motioned to Steve. "He's not even sure if it counts."
"Ah, it is part of the hex," Thor said.
Tony stopped abruptly and stared at him. "Uh, what?"
"Nah," Steve said but directed his gaze back at the baby feeding in his arms. "It'll work out for us until the end."
I asked him if he wanted to see."
He hadn't wanted to say anything, but he'd noticed some odd changes as of late. His face had softened just the slightest, and he was pretty sure his beard wasn't growing in as regularly as it once had. There was a tenderness to his pectorals, something he'd thought had been nothing more than dead nerves finally coming back online after his reactor surgery. His pants were slightly tighter, almost like his hips had spread just the slightest amount. It was all stuff that, separate, he wouldn't have given much thought to. But together? Oh, god, together…
"By you or by medical professionals?"
"In a young girl's heart? How the music can free her whenever it starts?"
Steve had thought he'd cleaned up the place well enough, but Tony had methodically gone through and picked up every scrap of paper then arranged the gifts under the tree in the least cluttered way possible. When Steve had told him to leave it — who was Tony trying to impress? — Tony just said, "Yeah, well, not all of us enjoy living in our own filth. And I thought you hail from that generation that's all about pride and keeping up appearances?"
"We both did," Steve said, his gaze still locked with Tony's and a small, knowing smile on his face. Try as he might, Tony couldn't help but return it in kind.
In response, Tony twisted the cap off the bottle and took a sip.
"Look, all you gotta do is dress up real nice, show up for five minutes, shake hands, get your picture taken, mingle a little, have a drink, couple hors d'oeuvres—"
"Stupidly told everyone you were Iron Man."
of another man in that way.
By the time he got back to the penthouse, half the team was sitting in the living room, chomping on cookies and watching some animated-type Christmas special on TV. Jim, who had arrived in the interim, and Thor had settled themselves into armchairs while Sam, Buck, and Natasha shared space on the couch, Sam with Olivia cradled in his arms and Bucky with a glowering look on his face.
"Yeah," Barnes said, "and I'm older than you, so…"
He shook his head.
There was another crash, then a thump, then the sounds of something dragging, and DUM-E beeped in delight as he produced his bouncy ball, and he zoomed back over to Steve with it and dropped it in Steve's outstretched hands, and Steve smiled faintly at him and said, "I think that's enough excitement for the time being, don't you?"
) or a botched mission with the Avengers (actually…not entirely unlikely). But seeing as none existed, none could be found, and the media was left with nothing but to either speculate on that (which they still did, though with less ferocity as they once had) or drop it all together and focus solely on the Tony-Stark-was-turned-into-a-woman-and-is- now-pregnant-with-Captain-America's-child (which was increasingly the angle because, as it turned out, it allowed them to
' before Bruce had finally let it drop.
Wilson just stared at Barnes a moment before he said, "You know, I think I might actually fucking hate you."
"I never said they didn't," Steve replied and stole one of the freshly-baked cookies. He bit into it and added through the bite, "I just said it was expensive and unnecessary."
He went to deny the charge but then decided it wasn't worth it to argue with him, and together, he and Steve cut into the cake that had been intended for someone else, the others 'aww'ing at the gesture and snapping pictures.
Steve ran his hands over Tony's thighs then up and over his hips and to his waist and belly. He tripped his fingertips over where the slight bulge from Tony's incident was showing then moved his hands up to cup Tony's breasts through the fabric of the bustier, squeezing ever so gently almost like he was trying to map and figure out every part of Tony's body, very similar to what he'd done back when they'd slept together for the first time.
, and you fucking chose… Fucking hell, it's
And he turned on his heel and made his way over to the door, his face burning in mortification, and just as he was about to cross through, Tony called out, "What about a coffee?"
"Where else is she going to stay? Where do you get furniture for kids? Her sleeping in my bed will be OK for a couple days, but after that—"
Steve figured asking what a galactic cosmonaut was would be a bad move. Somehow, he knew laughing and brushing off Tony's concern would be the right one.
"You're not calling now, are you?"
Because it hurt. It hurt so much. He thought he could trust Steve. He thought Steve would be different. Steve would love him and Steve would take care of him. Steve wasn't just with him to kill some time. And he'd believed it. JARVIS was right in that Steve wasn't so great with the vocalizing how he felt, but he liked to show it, and Tony had thought he'd shown it quite well over the past couple years. Because Tony had believed him when Steve had kissed him and Steve had made love to him and Steve had nagged at him to eat or to get some rest or to not pull so many stupid maneuvers in the field — which was the height of hypocrisy for Steve, whose stupid maneuvers outnumbered the rest of the team's put together.
Bruce shrugged. "It's one of two things: she's either from the future or she's from another dimension."
Olivia just made some overtures at him like she was hungry, and he sighed and said, "Yeah, OK, fine," and went into the living room, Olivia against his hip and the coffee in his other hand. He settled onto the couch and set the coffee down on the table beside him then cradled the baby against his chest and began to nurse her, meeting her gaze as she looked up at him and smiling at her as he did so.
Tony shrugged, and Steve let out another breath and nodded like that wasn't the answer he'd wanted.
As it turned out, Doctor Ganford wasn't able to lend Bruce an ultrasound machine — well, not one she was willing to have transported back to the Tower.
"Hmm?" Tony said, seeming to consider his chest area before he looked up at Steve. "Oh!" he said like he was suddenly remembering something. "Now we have some fun with this."
OK, so probably computer games. He was sure… Tony probably had
"Assemble," Natasha supplied.
body. I feel like me."
Steve met his gaze, and Tony held it, boring into him almost like he was trying to force his will on Steve, until Steve finally relented and said, "Yeah, OK."
They again drove in silence, Steve focusing on the passing scenery, the radio still playing what he assumed were supposed to be Christmas songs. He curled his toes and really wished he'd thought to grab shoes before running out of the house, and almost as though reading his mind, Tony said quietly, "There's a pair of socks and your boots in the back seat if you're interested."
Tony faked a gasp. "Steven! Such a spurious accusation to level upon the mother of your chi—"
Barnes heaved out another sigh. "You know he didn't meant it like that."
"Not at first. But when I realized who she was, yeah, maybe I'd eavesdrop on her conversations that featured her idiot friend, Steve. I thought you'd be married by now. I was surprised you weren't."
Steve just smiled, and he reached out and clapped Barnes by the shoulder and gave it a squeeze, and when Barnes nodded at him, Steve let go and turned back to Tony. He leaned down one more time and kissed him hard, hands with a gentle grasp of his shoulders, fingers kneading the joints in equal parts gentleness and possessiveness, and when he broke the kiss, he smiled at Tony then looked down at Tony's belly. He touched a gentle, loving hand to the swell and said, "Behave while I'm gone, you hear me?"
"Are you sure?"
to save me — he could have let me die — and why shouldn't he have? Yeah, I was a fucking genius, but was I really worth saving?"
"Yeah, maybe order me up a couple bras?"
He also told her to just set the pot of coffee down on their table, but she assured him she only had the one carafe for regular and needed that for the scant few other customers that were milling about, and this started a five-minute tirade on the abject stupidity of 'decaf coffee.'
"Uh, did she just say…?" Bruce murmured, but Tony didn't have a chance to respond or question the little monster as Pepper —
Steve chuckled. "Rhodey and Natasha are helping, too. Think they'd all prefer something more practical."
," Steve muttered like it offended him to even hear the word associated with her. But Tony groaned and said, "She's not making a return trip, is she?"
Tony grinned at him and sat down at the seat adjacent to him. "Oh!" he said, drawing the word out. "You like this one, don't you?"
Maybe she
"And who does she take after?"
It was easy talking to Tony. He'd never found it so easy to talk to anyone. And Tony didn't know him, so there was no pressure to be anything but himself. Not like with his friends that expected certain things of him—
, and Tony fumbled for Steve's hand. "
"Look, I just had one the other day," he said, and Steve murmured a quiet and embarrassed, "
"Who, Hill? Yeah, I think she'd be kind of insulted if she knew we were calling her the Avengers' babysitter."
didn't seem like something he'd been in the middle of doing just twenty minutes before. He'd given birth. Because he was pregnant. Because his childhood hero — Captain America himself — had knocked him up. Because he was physically a woman.
." He shook his head a little and reached up to put a tight but somehow gentle hand to Tony's arm. "I can't lose you, Tony. I can't, and it scares me—"
"You're fine. Trust me," Bruce replied. "OK, all done."
"Tony, stop," Steve said and rolled his eyes again.
Bruce shrugged. "The usual," he replied, and Tony figured he'd ask Natasha later what 'the usual' was because she probably knew better than any of them.
"Are you trying to imply that I want this?"
Steve's blood ran cold. Oh, god, had it been him?
"Oh," he said and sat back down at the table opposite Bruce. He grabbed a stylus again and began toying with it. "Guess it would have been beneficial to pay attention to what Cap or the Spy Twins were saying."
"Not like that you're not."
He shuffled over to the staircase, tears stinging his eyes as he bit his lip at the agonizingly dull ache throbbing in his nether regions, and he looked at the steps and whined, but knowing he could not sit this one out no matter how much his body screamed at him to, he took another breath and began to walk up, slowly, one step at a time, clutching the railing with one hand and using it to help pull him up the steps, trying not to jostle the baby or aggravate himself any more than he already was.
Bruce looked around the group, none of whom seemed to offer anything more supportive than a shrug to him, and he let out a somewhat annoyed breath and said to Tony, "Maybe. I don't know. You said you didn't want to know."
"I don't recall saying that."
"Yeah, it's a complete mystery to me," he said before he swiped to answer the call and said, "Yeah?" as he put the phone to his ear.
And then, before the guy could retaliate in any way, he ducked away and made his way through the crowd.

"All right, normally, I'm all for snooping, but that's usually on shady government agencies and
that thing had felt inside of him, and Steve hedged a little and said, "Tony, I don't know if that's such a good—"
"Can I ask you something? And you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I'm just curious. 'cause you know the extent of
"And whose fault is that?"
Olivia just gurgled at her and slapped her hands happily on the highchair tray, and as Steve watched Tony reach over and pick Olivia out of her highchair to settle her on his lap, a dark part of him thought that maybe it wasn't even a problem any longer that he was practically immortal. The way things were going, some Hydra goon would find those Infinity gems or whatever Thor had called him and attempt to lay them all to waste before Olivia was even out of diapers.
The others voiced their agreement, even Thor getting in on the action, though Tony suspected he was saying it just to fit in with the others, and Natasha motioned to Wilson and Barnes and said, "Surprisingly enough, as it turns out, they make a pretty good tag-team."
Sam just leveled him with a

"Yeah?"
"Nope! No, man, I got it. Trust me."
"You are doing a
"No," he said with a shrug. "Not your fault. You didn't do anything. Not your fault Steve's dead."
But it was different being that it was he himself that was going through this. He'd been in denial about it for so long and had hoped and wished it away so much that he kind of forgot that there was an end point and there would come a time that this would come to its natural conclusion.
It wasn't until he'd begun to prune that he decided it he'd spent enough time in there and shut the water off. He let some of the excess water drip off before he stepped out and actually jumped at the figure that stared back at him from the broad and defogged mirror directly across from him — at his paunch and wrinkles and graying hair. Fucking air-circulating vent fan keeping the condensation from building up. He averted his gaze, like he was afraid of catching something he didn't want to see, and he had just gained the courage to be able to look at himself in the mirror again when the already-ajar door pushed open some more, and Steve stuck his head in and said, "Tony? I'm taking Livvy downstairs for her bottle."
Tony arched an eyebrow. "And crazy space fertility goddesses that can transform you into a completely different sex so your sexy super soldier lover can knock you up
alternate universe," Bruce added, barely able to cover up his disbelief.
But Steve was not about to back down, and meeting Tony sharp-gaze-for-sharp-gaze, he nodded ever so slightly and said, "Yeah, I was. Once."
"Sarah Maria."
"Yeah," Sam said as both he and Bucky stared at Jim in part-bemusement and part-horror, "someday I gotta hear those stories."
tell you, not if I don't want to fuck things up for both of us, and being that I think we're both pretty fucking happy with where things are with us right now, I really don't want to fuck things up for us, and my Steve would kill both of us if we allowed that to happen.
"Relax!" she said and waved off Jane's concern. "I'm not gonna say anything. It's a lot more fun being in-the-know. It's like I'm an honorary Avenger."
"I know that. It's not because, at the moment, you're a woman—"
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes, pulling his hands away from Pepper's grasp. "Are you kidding me? How? Why?"
Age at first intercourse. Had he ever been sexually abused? Is he having any sexual problems?
," Bruce murmured, but Tony scowled at him.
" Tony asked, apparently flummoxed like he couldn't even fathom the concept of it.
"It was hard to get excited over anything when all I could think was, 'Yep, my parents died a year ago today,' or 'Wow, Christmas already? Hey, fifth anniversary of my parents' death.'"
Natasha bit into her slice of jellied toast and shot him a pointed look, and Tony looked amongst all four of them before he dropped his own slice of toast on his plate and said, "So, I take it Steve isn't wearing his Captain America uniform then?"
about things, but Wilson… He's the only one treating me like I'm not something that needs to be fixed." He choked out a laugh and added, "I know I… I know I got stuff in my head that I might never be able to get rid of, but it's nice to not feel broken."
from the forties," Bruce said and rolled his eyes. "Are we going to talk science, or are we going to talk Steve?"
Jim just stared down at him a moment then pointed to the tray on the coffee table. "These the cookies you made?"
"Tony, she can't stay here."
"Or maybe the way you went all googly-eyed when he pulled away," Bruce added.
