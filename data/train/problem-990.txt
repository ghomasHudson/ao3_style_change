"Something about a body being found, somewhere in Trevone. That's over in-"
"John, I don't believe-"
"I don't do sentiment for other people." Sherlock corrected. He looked solemnly into John's eyes. "And, who's to say what sexuality I am?" He smirked. He was so out of character, so un-Sherlock like that John had to focus carefully to make sure he wasn't acting, to make sure he wasn't just tricking him, or trying to get a certain response out of him.
"Sherlock, I've just admitted to one of the largest faults in my life. I believe I should leave."
"John, It's all fine. Alright?" Sherlock said, trying to move out from underneath him. John took the hint and sat up, allowing Sherlock to sit up as well. He noticed that he was practically sitting in Sherlock's lap. John nodded his head in understanding. Sherlock looked down between them, a light blush forming on his cheeks. John noticed, eyes widening in horror. He nearly jumped away from Sherlock, as if the man himself had burnt him.
John waited for him to continue, ears becoming red with anger. "I wanted to see the sunrise." Sherlock confessed nonchalantly. John leaned backwards.
"Yes, didn't I already say that?" Sherlock asked snarkily. He rose from the ground, stretching his sore muscles.
"You.. utter.." He trailed off, turning his back on Sherlock to pace around in the sand. "You had me worried half to death!" He yelled, pointing an antagonizing finger at Sherlock. "I thought you were dead for hours!"
"No, not a thing, I'm afraid." Lestrade answered. John heard him shifting on the other end, before it went silent again.
"Well, luckily I am a child." He said, looking up at Mycroft. "A seven year old is still a child." He faced the horizon again. "Besides, watching the sun rise isn't childish. Why are you here, anyway?"
Once his tea was brewed and properly steeped to his liking, He picked up the cup, walking over to his favoured armchair. Sitting down, sipping his tea, he stared into nothingness, enjoying the calm environment around him. Something which he rarely did. Enjoy something so calm, something that he would most definitely deem as boring. The night was still upon him, which meant, he had a small chance of catching the sun as it rose. Not that he'd be able to see it rise, living in central London. He stole a glance at his watch, three fourty-two. He still had time to see the sun rise if he left quick enough.
"And?"
"Not yet. The body is still on the beach." Sherlock let out a small chuckle.
"Yeah, I guess I did." John whispered. He rubbed the back of his neck anxiously. He just ruined their friendship, he ruined Sherlock completely. The man doesn't like to feel emotions, surely he'd hate John for bringing them upon him? He decided it was time to leave. He stood up, bowing his head. He had found Sherlock. He could leave him now, rent out a different flat, somewhere way far away from 221B. God, would Sherlock even allow him to take his stuff out? Maybe John could move out to Manchester, that was a good enough distance. Or, maybe he'd leave the country in general, so Sherlock wouldn't happen upon him accidently during one of his cases. Maybe move to Greece, perhaps further Nepal. Or even over to Canada. Maybe he'd change his name, colour his hair.
"John, stop-" He paused. "Wait. Did.. did you just say you loved me?" He spoke quietly now, looking at John with wide eyes. John froze. Did he just say that outloud? He backed away, a nervous sweat starting to form. He said it outloud, outloud to him. No, no, no, no.
"Oh really? How?" Mycroft sighed again. "Please, just try to figure out where he is." He hung up before Mycroft could reply. He rubbed his face with his hand, sighing. Where is he? He only hoped he was okay. It were times like these when he worried, really worried, about the consulting detective. Because it was only a short amount of time before someone who hated Sherlock, who wanted revenge for sending them to prison, or ruining there lives in some other god forsaken way, to find him and kill him. Or torture him, or assault him.. He couldn't let his mind travel in that direction. He had to be strong, not weak. Not for Sherlock, who for all he knew, could be in grave danger. He had to make sure the man he loved was- no, he didn't love him. He didn't.
"That would make sense, but he isn't answering his phone. And he always answers, no matter what."
"John."
10% of battery remaining
"Oh please. Do you really think I'd be that careless? You needn't worry about me, John. Didn't Graham and Mycroft tell you that already today?" John was practically fuming. He clenched and unclenched his fists, fighting the strong urge to place his hands on his friends throat. He was glaring daggers at Sherlock, that bit was obvious. But Sherlock didn't so much as flinch. Sherlock Holmes didn't do that, he didn't need to.
"Please, Myc. Can we just stay and watch it?" His brother shook his head.
Sherlock took a moment to stare down at the offered hand. He lifted the corner of his mouth and took his brother’s hand and shook it once.
Greg laughed as Mycroft closed the screen between the backseat and the driver. He leaned over and kissed Greg. Savoring the taste of coffee and sweet Danish on the man’s tongue. Mycroft leaned back as Greg smiled.
John ignored the voices that seemed far too close. He just kept his eyes closed, wishing himself back to sleep, as he heard the sound of pounding feet on the stairs.
James struggled to free himself. The two men fought but couldn’t break the ropes. His eyes locked onto John’s. It brought the war back to both of them. They had survived battle together but were they going to survive this?
“James is a sick bastard. He would enjoy it.” Moran turned and looked out the window. “It won’t be a good location for us. We need to get him isolated and away from any chance of snipers.”
The schooner hugged the coast around Ireland when it saw the ghostly appearance of the Appledore anchored off the southern most isle. Whisps of morning fog were slow to burn off and the Appledore appeared like a specter coming out of the mist.
Neither one acknowledged the intrusion. The door suddenly swung open and Greg Lestrade was standing in the door way. Two uniformed police officers were behind the detective.
John came inside James’ body while his hand was wrapped around James’ length. The warm release spread across his fingers. The two men stayed still on the single cot for a few more moments. Spooned together on the narrow bed. Cocooned within their own world. It felt wonderful for James. Everything he had wanted. Everything he had fantasized.
“Margery, the blond from microbiology lab and Norma, Sandy’s friend.”
“I looked ridiculous in that robe. It was too short.” Sherlock snapped.
John slowly opened his eyes and looked up at Sherlock. “Don’t.”
Sherlock rushed around the front of the B&B. The fire brigade were already there. Hoses were spraying water on the building. Fire was licking out of every windows on the first floor. Flames were bursting through the roof. The noise was deafening. The roar of the fire, and creaking of wooden frames breaking. The shouts of the firemen and guests as well as the wail of the sirens.
There was knock on his office door. “Come in.” Mycroft said as his hand slipped to the grip of the gun secreted in the knee hole of the desk. It was pointed directly at the door.
“Just what I fuck’n needed.”
John had made the same promise to Sherlock.
Dimmock smiled and pocketed the money. He looked both Sherlock and John up and down.
Mycroft didn’t argue with him. He dismissed Lestrade’s comment as one would about someone commenting on the weather.
“I’ve been fighting with myself to stay away.”
“That’s Moran.” John whispered. He moved around Sherlock and started towards the living room.
Lestrade kept staring at the soldier as he brought his coffee mug up to lips and took another sip. He set it down on the table and used a serviette to wipe his mouth.
“What? You don’t want a tearful goodbye with your captain?” Magnussen teased.
he thought. He rushed up the last few steps and into the room.
“No, I admire you.” Sherlock said with certainty.
The two men started down the stairs and crossed the deck towards the stern of the ship. Henry Barr was standing near the rail. He was stripped naked. A bucket of water at his feet. Barr was scrubbing himself with hard soap  then dipping a rag into the water. He wiped the soap and sweat away with the rag. The water dripping off his ebony skin.
John glanced at his watch and noted the time of day. Then he consulted a book in the box that held the sextant.
John blinked rapidly. He glanced around at the various police cars then back to the unusual omega. Tempted as he was to continue what had started in the hallway earlier in the evening, John thought it would be best to avoid the man.
“Talk, damn it!”
He had survived the trials of his past and he would survive this too. James Sholto would leave and John would keep going on. Because that was the only option he had. To just keep going on. He knew he would miss James, but he would get over it. He always did.
“Roof top to the left.” Blackwood said. The he rolled over onto his left shoulder and fired his rifle over the top of the wall.
The girth of the alpha cock was almost too much for Sherlock. Even after the preparation and his slick easing the way, John’s member stretched the omega to his limits. The burn grew then blossomed into warm pleasure. A wave of hedonism moved through Sherlock’s body. He moaned and pushed back to take more of the alpha in. He could feel the swelling knot and instead of fearing it, he craved the greater stretch.
“How soon?” asked Sherlock.
“But you’re going to bond with him?” John was confused.
Sherlock didn’t keep his promise. As soon as John had left the room, he rushed out of the flat and over to Frankie’s Backdoor. It was still an hour before the doors would officially open. Sherlock walked into the empty bar as if he owned the place. Frankie was sitting at the bar going over the invoices when he saw the younger man. Frankie shook his head and placed a hand over his face.
John studied Mike’s face for a few moments. He could see the man was being completely honest with him. Why wouldn’t Mike be honest with him? Sherlock was in love with Victor and it really wasn’t any of John’s business even if Victor didn’t deserve it.
John looked back up at Sherlock’s face. Nothing seemed different, then he noticed something along Sherlock’s neck. John reached up and gently pushed Sherlock’s hair out of the way. Four oblong bruises marred the young man’s skin. Four bruises like someone’s hand had gripped Sherlock’s neck and held him down.
John knew Sherlock wasn’t his type at all. John liked blonds with soft curves and round hips. He liked omegas who were petite and demur. Neither words would describe Sherlock. But there was something about this strange omega that had John’s interest. He couldn’t explain it.
He suddenly pushed backwards, knocking John off his feet. Moran twisted and held Moriarty in front of him as the sniper fired. The bullet went through James’ back, just left of his spine. Piercing his heart and traveling out and into Moran’s chest.
“It was? I don’t understand.” John said as he watched Sherlock.
The overweight beta glanced at Moran then quickly walked away. Moran stared for a moment at the door. For a brief moment he thought about kicking it in and rushing in to find John, but then he decide to wait. To wait and be more subtle about finding John and taking him away from the dark haired alpha.
“Because of the baby.” Sherlock’s eyes switched back to the fungus he was studying.
“Why would be looking for you?”
“This won’t go away, you know.” Dimmit threatened.
“But you will. You know on some subconscious level I’m correct. You will cause Sherlock pain. That is the reason your relationship hasn’t become more – physical,” Mycroft said.
John turned and smiled but he saw the intensity in Sherlock’s face. John’s smile disappeared. He turned back to his crew.
“So your brother thinks that you are already in the hands of this Magnussen and he is telling your brother what to tell the king and queen?” John’s voice became angrier.
John saluted and turned on his heel. He marched out of the officer’s presence and back into the heat of the Afghan desert.
“What are you talking about?”
He glanced around and Magnussen was gone. Missing. Baskerville wondered briefly if the man had been killed.
John glanced up and down the street. A cab came into view and he waved his hand. The driver pulled over and John got in.
“Just after I left for the army. It was you who sold him his first hit, wasn’t it?”
“If Wilderbrant doesn’t file charges, what difference does it make.” John said.
“I think it’s time we start to get some answers.” John said.
Sherlock stumbled over her and pushed himself pass the other naked revelers. He saw a door and tried to get to it. Just before he reached the doorknob, a hand came out and wrapped around his wrist.
“No, sir.” John said remaining at attention.
She glanced up from her conversation with Judy and smiled at John. Her smiles covered her whole face. All the way up into her curly dark hair. John smiled back, lifting his beer bottle at her in a toast. Jeannette seemed to notice the bottle for the first time and frowned. She said something to Judy and then walked across the crowded room towards John.
Greg glanced back at Sherlock. “So what. He was still there at Moriarty’s behest. If it wasn’t to help torture that omega, what was he there for? Why did Moriarty put him in that room?”
“It is a shame it was all for naught.” Sherlock replied casually.
“I’m not lusting. I don’t want to snog him. And we aren’t shagging. He’s just my friend.” John tried to explain. He had never mentioned that he and Sherlock had already kissed.
2010       Sherlock walked into the flat on Baker Street. John was in the kitchen whistling. Sherlock could smell the risotto John was cooking. The smell of garlic and butter as well as the nutty scent of the pasta. The flat smelled warm and inviting but Sherlock wanted to throw up. He had left Mycroft’s office and walked slowly through the city till he had no other choice but to return to the flat and to John.
“What?!”
“It’s fun.”
“Bollocks!”
He decided the dream had more to do with the agreed meeting in the morgue than anything else. He decided he would do what Mike had done and ignore the man as best he could. John would take his Pathobiology book to the morgue that night. He was positive reading about infectious diseases would take his mind off of Sherlock Holmes.
“Finally! Glad to see you made it. I was concerned,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock gently pushed John’s hands away. “I’m fine. Don’t worry.”
Sherlock can't handle John leaving.
“I wrote the test. Who else would grade it?”
Sherlock stepped closer and looked closely at John’s hand. A spark leapt across to Sherlock’s face. It snap at his lips. A quick discharge then the light was gone. Sherlock gasped at the shock – he felt a slight burning sensation to his lips. Then he felt John’s fingers smoothing over them. Gently, and softly. Dispelling the slight discomfort of the shock.
“Maybe.” John shrugged. “I can’t believe I’m telling you all this.”
“What happened to you?” Lestrade demanded.
James Sholto had been in the communication room when the call came in from Bravo squad that they were under attack. Sholto radioed back asking about the whereabouts of Captain Watson and the reply was ‘unknown’. Twenty minutes later the radio call came in that squad had pushed the enemy back and were returning to the camp. The only casualty was Captain Watson. Sholto almost screamed.
“You forgot to mention the drugs.” Sherlock almost whispered.
The Mary Morstan sailed into the glowing west. The ocean blazing in shades of gold and red as the sun set. The winds had picked up and the ship was sailing silently towards Jamaica.
“The roof. If we can get him up there with John, then we are protected on one side. There aren’t any buildings on the east side that have a direct line of sight for a sniper.”
“Don’t worry about it. I don’t.” John said as he turned back to Sherlock. His professional persona pulled back in place. “Alright who wants to explain to me what happened?”
“Is this what you thought about walking home?” Sherlock whispered.
John worried about his coaches finding out. He lied to them about where he worked. And it worked until one of them came in with a male date. The coach and John saw each other, then walked away as if they didn’t know each other. The next day at practice, the coach asked John to keep quiet about it. John learned his scholarship was safe.
“Hurry up, John.” He said through the closed door.
John could feel the wave coming. The drawing out of his breath and the crashing of pleasure. Sherlock kept at him. Pushing him onward until John couldn’t hold back anymore.
Greg was rewarded with a slight blush to the other man’s cheeks.
“I don’t have an alpha.” Sherlock said calmly as he glanced down at the suitcase, studying the locks.
John glared at the man but didn’t response to his comment. Sherlock shrugged and turned back to the computer and the open file.
John pulled Sherlock against one of the buildings as frightened civilians ran passed them. John’s eyes scanned the crowds for anyone who looked like the enemy. His hand on Sherlock’s chest as he pressed the younger man against the wall and shielded him with his own body.
Sherlock stopped suddenly and the teacup rattled in its saucer. “Me? Why would I be nervous?”
John stumbled back and collapsed into his chair. “Beneficial? How?”
The two men got up and went over to the bar. Frankie climbed up onto one of the barstools. The wood squeaking as he sat down. John walked around to the back of the bar. He grabbed a pint glass and gave it a slight twirl in the air.
The rhythmic drumming of a helicopter rose as James turned to see the John with a rifle still at his shoulder move around the wrecked truck and out towards the field. Several men followed him. The helicopter landed and the men set up a defensive perimeter around it. The doors opened and three soldiers rushed over to James and the other injured man.
The pain Sherlock felt was worse than when John left the first time. His greatest fears had been realized. His John went to the army and never returned.
“Hey, colonel . . . look ahead.” The driver of the lead truck, young beta soldier, said.
“He is safe for the time being. Well, when I say safe, he is not being . . . overtly harmed. I’m sure the men he is with are entertaining him. I found out he was very popular when he was in the army. Did you know that? He did love being fucked by a man in a uniform.”
“You’re not in bed . . .”
“Nothing against you, my dear.” John started as he pulled his cotton shirt over his head. “You’re a sailor’s dream. But I’ve got to go and find my friend. It’s important.”
A young boy came in carrying a bucket or water and a pile of clothes. “Here, mister. Capt’n said’ bring these to you.”
“Then go and marry one of the other men.”
“Embarrassment is a waste of time and effort. If you are ashamed of your behavior then you shouldn’t have even considered the action.” The voice was thick with a Scandinavian accent.
“I don’t need a surgeon here.” The colonel said folding the orders back into the envelope and handing it back to John. “Did you request to be stationed in a forward base?”
“He’s not breathing.” James said.
“Shall we begin? The endocrine system is the group of glands that secrete three different types of biochemical compounds collectively known as hormones into the blood stream.”
John glanced back and forth between the picture and Sherlock. He recognized the name of Sherlock’s supplier from years before. How many nights had he wished the man dead? How often was he jealous of someone he never met? After all these years, Moriarty was back and connected to another man in John’s life. He gave his head one sideways jerking shake then said.
“How could I do that? I’m just a fuck’n barkeep.” Frankie took another sip of scotch while his eyes were fixed on Sherlock’s.
“Mind if I get that.” Moriarty said unstressed.
John looked confused as Sherlock stepped closer to him. He placed a hand on John’s shoulder.
“But John . . .”
“And the ship that picked him up?” Mycroft asked.
“Neither do I.”
“This is not over, Magnussen.” Moriarty growled.
The driver hadn’t even stopped the car before John had the door open. He shoved a twenty pound note through the money slot for a seventeen pound ride and leaped out onto the tarmac. John glanced at the two buildings then rushed over to the one on the right. The door was unlocked and John thanked his luck he had picked the correct building.
“What have you been saying to my fiancé?” Victor asked, glaring at John.
“I have received news today that Mycroft Holmes will be asked to step down from his position at Whitehall. He is presently banned from MI5 and MI6. We can start to increase the import of drugs through Dover and York from Afghanistan and Cambodia.”
She hesitantly reached for the box and cautiously picked it up. She held it out in front of her at arms’ length.
“Damn it all,” he cursed under his breath. “Cullen, steer towards the Speckled Band. McMath!?”
Violet pouted and sighed. “My dear husband died ten years ago. It was quite sudden.”
John looked carefully into Sherlock’s eyes. They were contracted to pinpoints and his pulse rate was rapid. Sherlock’s head lulled back and the man fell unconscious in John’s arms. John could smell the sour scent on Sherlock’s breath. An indication of drug use; smoking cocaine.
“Then let’s go ask Smith where he is.”
“I don’t know about that.” Sherlock smiled. He quickly came back over and handed Greg a picture of a man in a Russian Army officer’s uniform. “Meet General Yuri Litkin. The Butcher of Atyrau.”
“Trust me.” McMath whispered.
He saw the man dancing in the middle of a crowd. Several of the dancers were shirtless and moving together to brush up against each other. Hands were moving over flesh as the lights changed colors adding to the heathenistic scene.
“Again, not as bad as I was afraid.” John tipped his head back and kissed Sherlock’s mouth. It was an awkward angle but it was still pleasant. “So, now what?”
John fought the inclination to both grab Sherlock and wrap him in his arms, begging for forgiveness and wanting to punch the man. John stared at Sherlock, then huffed out a breath. “Well, that’s a first. Sherlock Holmes doesn’t know something.”
“No.” John said. “It happens sometimes. Especially if there is a thunderstorm in the area.”
“I promise you that I will do everything in my power to keep you alive, John.” Sherlock smiled. “Everything.”
John sat on the edge of the bench shifting Sherlock up on his hip as John wiped his belly.
“And you’re an alpha, but I won’t hold that against you.”
“No, it’s fine. I’ll be fine here.”
Moran and Sherlock stepped out on to the roof. They walked slowly around the domed roof till they heard Moriarty’s mobile. Sherlock touched Moran’s arm and motioned for him to hold back. Sherlock slowly continued and rounded the corner till he could see John and Moriarty standing by the low parapet.
“Let go of me!” John demanded.
“Why?”
“John . . . what happened between the two of you?” she cried as John wrapped his arms around her to console her.
“This letter?”
Mycroft allowed himself a sight curve to his lips as he glanced away from the policeman sitting next to him.
“I got the cook to give me the giblets from a turkey and a goose. I’m comparing the anatomical differences in the two species.”
“Calm down John . . . I’m going to let you rest. In a while you will feel better. Sleep now.”
John finally caught onto the string of the conversation. “Wait a minute. Are you saying we would be working for your brother as what? Spies?”
“That’s true.” Sherlock said. “Victor was never there when John visited.”
“I’M NOT YOUR BONDMATE! I REFUSE! I NEVER WILL BE!” Sherlock was shaking with fear and anger.
“Look, I want to know where you are taking me.” John said. He tried to sound demanding and in control, but it came out more like a plea.
“I will as soon as Sherlock agrees to leave this . . .” Mycroft paused when he noticed John glaring at him. “Flat and come home with me.”
Sherlock chastised himself.
“Where is your flatmate?” John’s voice rumbled.
John rolled up into a crouch on the grass. His clothes were smoking. His hair was singed. John’s face was blackened with soot. His right hand was blistered.
Sherlock’s thumb smeared over the slit of John’s dick. Dragging the precum in a circle around the head of the gland. John tossed his head back hard. Hitting the wall behind him and sending a sharp stabbing pain through John’s skull. For a brief second John’s thoughts cleared and he wanted to tell Sherlock to stop, but then the man’s fingers wrapped tightly around John’s length and pulled it up with a smooth fluid tug. Then another and another.
“You don’t know what I was asking.” The corner of John’s mouth curled up.
“Why didn’t you just kill him years ago?” Sherlock asked watching the flames dance.
Before John could say something else, Roberta came up to the table. She had two cups of coffee in her hand and the menus.
The Morstan cannons fired again. McMath’s aim was deadly. Sherlock watched and the gun ports on the Vengeance exploded. The starboard side of the ship had a gaping hole at mid-deck. The ship didn’t return fire but kept sailing right into the side of the Morstan.
Sherlock laid back down as he watched William stop suckling and quickly fall off to sleep. No more tears, no more cries, no more sadness. John carefully rose and placed the child in the basinet then he came back and laid down next to Sherlock in the narrow hospital bed. He wrapped his arms around the alpha.
“Kisses! There was more than one?”
John wondered about that for a moment.
“Here is the report you requested on Dr. John Watson.” Anthea held out a file for Mycroft.
Sherlock turned to look at the man holding his wrist. He was shorter than Sherlock, but not by much. He was attractive with dark hair and pale skin. His face was round and lean. He had the body of swimmer, tight and proportioned. The man was wearing clothes too, white shirt and dark trousers. Sherlock’s eyes traveled up and down the man’s body.
“I will see you at eight. Please do not be late.” Mycroft rose and walked out of the room.
“Why what? Why are you here? Why do I not want you to go to the army? Why are you so fucking boring?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “You’re here because no one else wants your sorry arse around. Even though I am beginning to be repulsed, I don’t want to see you killed. And as for why you are so boring . . . I’ll just let you surmise the reasons.”
“You will do as you are told. And so will the Holmes bitch. If I say jump, you won’t even wait to find out how high. If I say your bondmate will suck off every alpha in the room, then you will hold his leash while he does it.” Moriarty growled.
~221~
“Yeah, I guess so.” Greg looked concerned.
“Take him – suspend him!” the man shouted.
“You’re joking!”
“You’re coming with me, John. That’s final. I’m not letting you go!” Moran reached out to grab John’s arm.
“We’ll see.” Sholto frowned. “You will be with my squad.”
John paused and looked up at Sherlock. “No,” he whispered.
So now Moran was here to make sure the message got out.
“He wouldn’t use that word, but yeah. He took off too. All alone now.”
He didn’t know why he was deployed to Sangin either, but here he was and here he would fight.
“No, a woman in her thirties . . . worked as a book agent. She died after leaving a birthday party thrown for her. And a Lord. Late forties. Same drug. Each one found in places they shouldn’t have had access to and no hint of depression or suicide prior to finding them dead.” James said.
“For now. I’ve been waiting for you.”
He leaned against the dirt wall that protected this side of the base from a river approach. As he looked out over the swirling mud he thought of John. Of the omega doctor who didn’t act like any omega he ever met. John was perfect. He was everything the alpha wanted in a mate. John was self-reliant and determined. He was intelligent and strong. He was fearless and brave. John would never question Moran’s choices; he would gladly follow Moran where ever the soldier was sent on deployment. He would be a comrade as well as a mate.
Sherlock clapped his hands together and rushed over to the desk. He started rummaging through the papers and books crowded on top of it.
“I don’t understand. He should have put down his mother, or father or even boyfriend.”
“Sorry, mate.” John muttered as he kept walking. His head down, his eyes fixed ahead of himself.
Frankie leaned back in his chair but didn’t say anything. John continued.
“Not your father, but there is someone who has a connection to Victor, Sholto, Moriarty and you. We’re going to talk to him.” Sherlock said as he read another text on his mobile.
“You expect me to ride behind you on a motorcycle?” Mycroft looked affronted.
John grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and then began to push the younger man out the window. The sole of Sherlock’s foot was cut on the broken glass still in the window frame, but the adrenaline rushing through Sherlock’s bloodstream stopped him from feeling it. Carefully, John guided Sherlock out of the room and dangled him from the first floor window. John leaned forward. The same glass that cut Sherlock was now slicing the side of John’s waist.
William turned and marched towards his private rooms. Several advisors scurried after him. Mary stepped closer to Mycroft and lightly touched him on his arm.
“Sherlock, I know that you have teased me about sleeping together, but I’m not going to move in here as your . . . I don’t know.”
The description made Sherlock’s stomach twist. He felt sick. Memories of Magnussen’s assault rushed back into Sherlock’s mind.
“A normal rehabilitation takes four weeks, but I believe we can both agree you do not fall within the spectrum of normal. Four months of therapy and re-education and pattern alteration or you will never leave here.”
Several of the streets were paved with cobblestones but most were still hard packed earth. The buildings that lined either side of the streets were a combination of brick and stucco. Some had thatched roofs while others had wooden shingles. There were no pavements or sidewalks. Pedestrians dodged carts and horses as well as other pedestrians.
“Oh, yes most indeed. It would be a shame if he succumb to his injuries.” Smith said. He set the Champagne flute down and stood up. He walked over and took the tablet form Moriarty’s hands. “I wanted to ask him about his ancestors. I’ve been wondering if the Holmes family is related to my hero.”
“Is this because I took the job at the club? I don’t understand why it would matter so much to you, but I’ll quit. Just don’t do something stupid like this again.”
“So, you have a photo of the two of us in a car. Are you asking if we saw anything that day? You’ll have to tell me which day it was. I don’t recall witnessing any robbery since I returned to London.” John said as impassively as he could.
Even after having three fingers in him, Sherlock’s entrance was tight. John nudged slightly over and over again until the head of his cock slipped inside the omega. Sherlock gasped slightly and tensed.
John leaned forward and kissed Sherlock’s mouth. “I’m more interested in what is going to happen in the next few minutes.”
“No, I don’t, but I can’t stay here.” John said. “I don’t have a job and can’t afford to live in London on my own.”
“Officer, I demand you remove this man and his guards immediately!” the doctor shouted.
“We’ll take him to his cabin. Stay with him. Watch him. If he starts to become feverish, come get me.”
“I’m sorry but there is no one by that name working here.” She said quickly.
John wondered why she was being so shy. Everyone at the party knew they were a couple. They knew that John and Jeannette were sleeping together.
“Doctor Sarah is already working on the ‘GSW’ to the chest. I have a child with the mumps and a stab wound.”
A little smut towards the end of this chapter. Please skip the second to the last portion if not your cup of tea.
“I don’t know what you mean.” John’s voice was steady but at odds with the emotions now surging through him.
Frankie took a step backwards, fearful Sherlock would attack him again. “Well, you can’t stay here any longer. Someone will tell your nosy brother and I don’t want no trouble.”
“I met up with John after class and we walked until we arrived here late. We stayed in.”
The needy sound went immediately to John’s groin. He wrapped his right hand under Sherlock’s back and placed the omega flat onto the couch as he crawled on top of him. Sherlock’s hands wrapped around the curve of John’s butt and squeezed. Causing the alpha to growl and nip at Sherlock’s jaw; John rutted against Sherlock’s groin.
“Detective Inspector, trust me when I tell you that Culverton Smith just confessed to murdering Lady Elizabeth Smallwood and being present when my mother was murdered by Jim Moriarty.” Mycroft said as he sat up straighter in the bed.
“Look, I’m sorry,” John said as the same time Sherlock said, “It was my fault about . . .”
“Jim Moriarty and Sebastian Moran – who are they?” Lestrade sighed as he stared at the two men.
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock mewed softly as John’s right hand slowly smoothed down Sherlock’s left side. Long sweeping strokes as if he was petting a reclining cat. They sat together for a long time. Simply comforting each other with their presence. John softly scratched at the back of Sherlock’s neck and the omega pheromones slowly filled the room. Relaxing and reassuring.
“And five years ago, what were you doing the day Victor Trevor was murdered?”
“The monetary benefits are great for the right type of alpha.”
“Not all things.”
~^+^~
“I don’t care. You should have been mine.” Moran took another step closer.
“I’ve told you to leave my belongings alone. You have only yourself to blame for any embarrassment.” Sherlock said as he slammed the door. He slouched on the seat like a petulant teenager.
"You love me?"
Eight minutes. Now he began to worry. He checked the time, it was seven thirty in the morning. Sherlock never left John without replying. Was he in danger? He pulled up his contacts list, clicking on the detective's name. It went straight to his voicemail.
"Sherlock!" He yelled, hoping to get the man's attention, hoping that he was alive. He ran over to the detective, bending down at his side. "Sherlock. Sherlock!" He shook the man's shoulder, startling him awake. He blinked before looking up at John, confused. Why was he here? "Oh, god! Are you alright? Why are you here? What happened?" He fired off questions rapidly, before throwing himself onto Sherlock. Sherlock made a tiny noise of surprise, taken aback by the sudden tight embrace he was in. John squeezed him tightly, burying his face into Sherlock's soft curls, holding him close. Sherlock all but laid still, clearing his throat to gain John's attention. He suddenly let go, moving away from Sherlock, a dark red creeping up his neck and his cheeks. "Sorry." He whispered. "Are you okay?" John asked, slowly, this time. Sherlock nodded, sitting up straight.
Sherlock, answer me, goddammit. - JW
"-sorry, it's just that I love you and I don't know what happened, I'm sorry-"
Where did you go? Did Lestrade call you for a new case? Surely not the one in Trevone, that's too far away. - JW
"You left without telling me, made no issue to try to contact me, leaving me to worry that you were taken, and otherwise dead!"
"No. There wasn't."
He turned to face the voice of his brother, whose breath was laboured. He was carrying a torch, flashing the bright beam in his brother's eyes. Sherlock closed them tightly, blinking rapidly once the light left his face. He looked up at his brother, who stood sternly. Sherlock stood in front of him, reaching his full height, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Or maybe he was taken! Has that occurred to you?" John yelled, running his hand through his hair again. He heard a low sigh from Sherlock's brother.
Please, don't be dead, Sherlock. Please. - JW
"You wanted to see the bloody sunrise." John said, through gritted teeth.
"Why are you still here, with me? I just told you that I love you, doesn't that ruin your entire personality, our friendship?" John asked, looking down. He didn't want their friendship to end. He wanted to stay as Sherlock's friend, perhaps let it grow into something more. Why was he still here?
"Yeah, hey. Listen, Sherlock's gone missing." John went straight to the point, not leaving any time to waste. He heard a little chuckle from the other end.
"And what?" John asked, looking down at Sherlock. His eyes popped open, staring somewhere past John's face. He lowered his hands, leaving them to rest upon his stomach.
Sherlock opened his eyes. He had relived that memory from over twenty five years ago. He sighed, remembering Mycroft's little rant that he gave himself during the walk back. Mycroft promised to keep the whole debacle from Mummy, but only as a favour. He was almost out of favours, now.
"Well, it was something I've wanted to do ever since I was a child, but I never got the chance."
“You have a weakness, Sherlock. One that I was more than willing to exploit.”
“No.”
John snorted into his tea as Mycroft drew a face.
“I admit it looks just like my handwriting but I didn’t write this. I didn’t reserve any rooms . . .”
John pushed Sherlock off his chest. He placed his hand over Sherlock’s mouth and shook him awake.
“Uhm, not a doctor yet.” John said as he placed the bin down outside the door of the flat. “What can I do for you?”
John growled and took a step closer. Sherlock ducked his head again.
Moran’s face shifted from the relaxed expression of a bartender to the hardened face of a killer.
John shouted at the man on the deck as the rowboat approached. By the time they got beside the vessel, a rope ladder had been dropped over the side. John rapidly climbed the ladder and started shouting.
“John, tell me what he said.” Seb asked.
“Did you?”
James felt the punch to his soul. “There is nothing you should apologize for.”
“Oh . . . good.” Sherlock said distractedly.
Sherlock looked down at the pile of rope at Barr’s feet. He grabbed one and tied a loop in the end. Next, he slipped another loop through the first loop twisted it and repeated the loop. Then he stepped into the two new loops of the harness.
“I need your phone.”
“And just so you know. Your brother, Sherlock, won’t be forgotten either. Jim has a plan for him too. I believe he is planning on having him sent away to work the rest of his miserable life in a brothel. Isn’t that a nice thought to have as you are dying?”
Sherlock glanced around the room again. There were no pictures on the walls or anything to indicate who actually slept in this room. Other than the books there was nothing personal. Sherlock thought John Watson would be the sentimental type. There should be keepsakes and letters from lovers. Sherlock moved behind the desk and opened the drawers.
“What’s happened?!” John asked.
His hands quit shaking as Sherlock stared at the photo. He’s seen that scar before. He thought. Memories of people and places flashed rapidly through his mind. People and places. Where Sholto was murdered. Sholto at the Enclave. The Enclave and Frankie. Frankie and the stranger. Jim. Jim and his bodyguard. The blond man with the scar on his face.
John thought for a moment then nodded his head. “Yeah, I told Wilderbrant that Trevor was a bastard, but I didn’t throw the first punch.”
“You sick fuck, Moriarty!” John shouted.
“I’m sure Anderson and Donavan will file another complaint about our behavior.” Sherlock smiled back at John.
He stretched his body and felt his sore muscles tighten in complaint. He reached and cupped his stomach. It was soft and not as firm as it had been. Yes, his son had been born. He was a father. John smiled and stretched again.
“I enjoy a good fuck after the conclusion of successful transaction.”
“Here,” he said as he handed the clothing to Wilderbrant.
John looked up into Seb’s slate grey eyes. They took on a lighter color. Like the sky before a storm hits in the winter. John looked at the strong jawline and the military cut blonde hair. The tan skin tight over the lines of Seb’s face. The thin white line of a healed scar across the left side of his face, from jaw to ear. Seb looked nothing like Sherlock. Seb was physical while Sherlock was intellectual. Seb was everything John missed about the army. The strength and power. He should be everything John would want.
“Jenifer Wilson’s. The victim.”
Sherlock hesitated once, then took off hobbling. With the ankle chains it was difficult to leap up on to the railing. Instead he hooked his hip on the railing then ungracefully tipped over and fell into the water.
John meets Moriarty
~221~
He thought back to the brief encounters when he was younger.
“Yes, after the girl’s death. He’s been delaying the transfer hoping you’d change your mind?”
“Oh, Johnny Boy, when has it not been about Sherlock?”
“What the devil are you doing here?” Greg asked Sherlock.
“Yeah, it’s me.”
Greg smiled. “Thank you, Sherlock. You got me started and I really owe you a lot.”
“I thought we weren’t going to bring up that night.” John said looking sideways at John.
The voice was unfamiliar. It was older and more authoritative. John’s heart began to beat harder.
“JOHN!” Sherlock shouted. Then he raised the pistol in his hand and fired. The flash from the black powder was blinding. The report loud. Sherlock felt a sting to his face.
Moran wrapped his arms around the omega’s waist and picked him up. He heaved the smaller man to the bed. James bounced once before the alpha was on top of him. The sound of ripping fabric announce the destruction of Moriarty’s white shirt. Moran attacked James’ bare chest with his teeth and lips. Nipping and marking the pale flesh and he moved from the man’s neck to his waistband. Moriarty moaned and twisted under Moran. Not resisting the alpha’s advances nor relenting to them. Moriarty scratched and clawed at the alpha, while he pulled the blonde hair.
Sherlock rose from his seat with his arrogant expression in place.
“Okay.” John knew if anything was going to get Sherlock angry it was the idea of John wearing the bartender’s uniform of Frankie’s. A t-shirt cut off at the mid-drift and short shorts. More ass-cheeks showing the better.
Pulling himself up to his feet, he looked down and saw the package of heroin still clasped in his hand. He wanted to throw it away. He hated it. But he couldn’t. He stumbled forward and pressed the button for the lift. He knew where he could get a syringe.
“John, you’re a doctor who was also a soldier. You live for excitement and you want to be the hero. You have a need to be needed. An addiction.”
Mycroft was dumbstruck.
“Com’ along doc. He wants to see you.” Ryan said not looking in John’s direction. Instead his eyes were scanning the crowds to make sure they were not noticed.
John tried to act affronted but he couldn’t keep the smile from forming on his face and the twinkle in his eye.
“So bold and intuitive.” He stepped closer to Sherlock. The younger man felt trapped in the small cabin with the man there. “Tell me . . . did Watson take you willingly or did you scream?”
“John?” Sherlock’s voice carried an amount of concern.
John looked at his friend. “React to what?”
“No.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He veered between the stacks of cargo and doubled back on himself. He moved quickly around the large stack of crates to see that he was being followed by two men he’d never seen before. The men had lost Sherlock in the piles of cargo. They were moving quickly through the tall piles looking for him. Sherlock glanced around and tried to find an escape when he heard one of men shout.
“Deleted?”
“But you don’t have a leader like Moran. Someone they will listen to. Someone they will fear.” Sherlock said. His eyes fixed on Jim and pointedly ignoring John standing behind him in stolen hospital scrubs.
“You’re assuming he believes I’m still alive.” Moran said as he looked up at the driver to see if they were being listened too.
“Missed my shift last night. Probably fired.” John mumbled the words but Sherlock understood them and smiled.
“Yes, quite obvious those are boots. Why did you bring them in here?” Sherlock’s voice cut through John’s astonishment.
“I think . . . I . . . my mind has stop working.” Sherlock moaned. “It’s silent.”
“He will blame me if anything happens to you here. I don’t know if it would be worth it to get another bartender.” Frankie said, but John could already tell that he probably had the job. “Show me how you pull a pint.”
“We had an agreement.” Moriarty’s voice was barely above a whisper but the inflection was sharper than a razor.
John was knocked backwards and into the wall. He hit it hard and slid partially down it before he caught himself. Slowly, he pushed himself back up, glaring at Moran as he did so.
Neither man noticed the door open behind them or the frightened woman emerge from the ground floor flat.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and sat down in a chair near the lit fireplace. He crossed his long legs and glared patronizingly at his brother.
The ache grew in his chest. It was so much more painful than before because he had prophesized John’s future. John was a hero, the bravest man Sherlock knew. And John had been hurt, not just by Sherlock but by the world. Sherlock had sacrificed so much and it didn’t stop John from being shot. His plans didn’t save John Watson. It would have been better for the man if Sherlock had never met him in that bathroom in the first place. If they had never kissed. If he had never pursued John.
“What do you mean?”
“And that would be my job to determine.” Greg Lestrade said as he held out his warrant card for the doctor and the orderlies to see.
2008 John is shot
“I do not wish to be considered ordinary and dull.”
John was leaving class and heading over to open the bar for the late afternoon crowd. He was in a good mood for once and he was enjoying it. The last test he took in chemistry had been his highest grade to date. With Sherlock sharing the expenses of the flat, John was finally able to put some money away in the bank. His rugby team won their last two games. And he had a gorgeous dark-haired boyfriend, who looked like an angel but kissed like a demon.
“First you will need to stop your suppressants.”
“Sherlock, please . . . before it’s too late.”
“No, not between them. Barr was sailor. And Babcock – Martin Babcock was a midshipman. The Maywand was his first ship. He wasn’t more than fifteen.” John said. “Jasper Underwood was the captain of the Maywand.”
He rested his hand over his small baby bump as he wandered down the hall and was shown into the reception room. He paused at the door to see his bond mate quietly sitting on the settee with a white sheet wrapped around his long frame. Without a word the omega sat down beside Sherlock, glancing curiously around the ornate room. He glanced at his bond mate.
“Remember, military training here. Book codes are common methods of relaying information. And look here.” James pointed to one of the photos. “Some of the symbols have been translated.”
“He’s alive.” Mike said as his only answer.
As soon as he said it, John realized he said too much. His heart couldn’t take being crushed by Sherlock’s ‘no’.
“Why?” the doctor shouted back as he read another file.
Lestrade stepped closer and looked at injured man. John was bare chested but his shoulder was bandaged. His skin was flushed and a skim of sweat was visible across it. He was breathing shallow and slowly. At times it looked as if he was already dead.
“The agreement was after he was convicted in court.”
The younger man stepped forward. The light creeping in from under door was casting odd shadows across the two young men’s faces but Sherlock could see the boy was younger than himself. He was at least six inches shorter and had military cut blonde hair. His face was round and smooth with a small pug nose.
“Real or imagined harm? A few dozen to . . . who knows how many. We must operate on the presumption that whoever this is, they are sincere in their threat. For John’s own good, you must break with him, Sherlock. You must send him away.”
“No, I came for Sherlock.” John said. He wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s torso and pulled the omega closer.
Sarah shook her head. “I’ll let you have two weeks from when you call in. If you need me, though, call me . . . anytime. You know we won’t be more than coworkers but I do care about you John.”
John blocked the knife with the barrel of the gun, but the shoulder-strap limited movement with the gun. John also was at a disadvantage crouching down on his heels. The man towered over John and could use his weight to push the knife pass the waving gun. The man grabbed the end of the barrel with his free hand and yanked it up and out of way. He plunged forward again, aiming the knife for John’s chest.
Sherlock pulled back and leaned up on to his elbow. His silver blue eyes looked down into John’s.
“I’m pretty good at it. And I can work most nights. And I already know most of the guys who work here.”
“No it is not safe. King James is on the continent. There are groups working to return him back to the throne. Lists of targets for assassination have been made.”
“What?!” The professor sputtered.
John cleaned the wound again with betadine, then poured a clotting agent into the wound. He carefully stitched the wound close again. Then gave the child an injection of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. As John wrapped the child’s leg in bandaged he spoke to Henn who translated for him.
“You could have gone to the club on campus, or I’m sure there are several others that you are familiar with that don’t specialize in gay clientele.” Sherlock said studying John’s reactions.
Moriarty’s eyes flicked over at Moran once more. The blond soldier couldn’t stop himself - he smiled.
Start of the third part of the story.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John think. If Mycroft has access to every CCTV camera in London, don’t you think he would have access to cameras that are not visible or legal.”
Sherlock stared at John for a moment then dropped his coat on the back of a chair. “How?”
Sherlock held his ground as he stared at John. “You have no idea what I went through with your departure. I told you I loved you. I wasn’t lying to you.”
He drove out of the compound as various soldiers tried to wave him down. He would not stop. It was only eighty-two miles from Camp Bastion to Kandahar. The helicopter would be there in less than twenty-five minutes, Moran was going to have to go off road to avoid the check points; it would take him over two hours. He drove the Humvee over the rough terrain kicking up a curtain of dust behind him.
Sherlock stared wide eyed at the water in front of him. John loved him. John Hamish Watson loved him. He tried processing it. Over and over, until it seemed fake enough for him to not believe it. But John had said it, hadn't he? He had said it, and he had left. Wait, he left? He turned his head. He could see John walking away. No, he can't leave. Don't let him leave.
"Oh." Sherlock fished his phone out of his pocket. "Phone died." John frowned. Slowly, he was becoming angry, again.
The sun had risen further in the sky, and Sherlock basked in the now warm air surrounding him. He sat there for a few more hours, until the day had now started, and people were beginning to leave their houses. He checked his watch, it was now eleven thirty. He hadn't moved from his position, and he realized that his arms and legs were aching from remaining in a tight position for hours. He removed his arms, stretching out his legs until his feet hit the sand. He didn't know what he'd do with the rest of the day. Would he return home, back to Baker Street, or would he stay here, get a hotel room, and leave in the morning? He'd leave tomorrow, he decided. But, maybe he'd just stay near the water for a bit longer.
John nearly collapsed in relief.
The car ride was silent. John was less worried, now that they knew where the detective was, but they didn't know what state he was in. Which, still helped peak is worry. He received a few text messages from Mycroft about their progress, and something that was totally un-Mycroft like, it almost scared John. He was sending him reassuring words.
Sherlock, please, just text me back, tell me where you are. - JW
He turned off his phone, leaving it at 4% when they arrived. He left the vehicle, paid the cabbie, telling him to keep the extra two pounds he had given him. He headed toward the park, taking the trail toward the water. The sky was a bit brighter now, but he still had just under an hour until the sun itself rose from below the horizon. He wanted to take a picture, so he could possibly show John, but he was sure John would have found it childish. Still yet, he pulled out his phone to capture the dark sky that was becoming brighter with each minute. He had 3% when he turned it off. He'd capture a few more photos before it died.
“Where is he?” John asked looking around the room.
“But I am dead according to your own reports.” Sherlock said.
“No.” The guard smiled down at the two young men. His teeth were discolored and his gums were swollen. “Get out of ‘ere.”
“RETURN FIRE!” John instinctively shouted.
“Hamish?” Sherlock asked.
“It was two minutes.” John said. “The longest two minutes of my life.” He looked up at Greg. “Sorry about sneaking in here but we need your help.”
Sherlock, are you ok? Please text me back. - JW
Leaving his half finished tea on the side table, he rose, grabbing his belstaff off the hook on the back of the door. He was still in his clothing from the day before, so he needn't worry about changing. Grabbing his navy scarf as well, he tied it around his neck before heading out their flat door. He pulled his phone out of his pocket as he headed down the stairs,and he pulled up the train schedule. Perfect. His train left in nine minutes, and given the five minute walk to the station, he knew he had enough time. He walked out the door of 221B, heading across the road for the short walk to Euston Station.
"Yes, I bloody love you, Sherlock Holmes." He said outloud. Once, twice, three times,
"You are right, John. I don't want to be your friend." Sherlock replied. John looked up at him, wide eyes. Then he looked back down. He ruined it. Ruined everything. He knew it now, Sherlock would despise him. Hate him, every morsel of his being. He wouldn't want to be friends with someone who loves him, truly loves him. He'd hate John, and he ruined it all, just by a simple phrase of three words. He could feel the tears brimming in his eyes. He'd never see Sherlock again, never see the beautiful man again. "Stop thinking so loud, John." He raised his hand, tilting John's chin up. John fought for control over his own emotions. "Perhaps, I'd like something.. More than being friends." He gave John one of his rare, soft smiles. John froze again. Sherlock was.. Interested?
John retuned the smile. “I think I have the night off. Let’s go.”
“He just came in. He just – what are you insinuating?”
“Positive. As soon as the facial recognition identified the man whom had gone into the pub with John as ex-Colonel Sebastian Moran. I sent a car to retrieve the good doctor. Why was he out without you? Especially given his condition?”
John turned and quickly rushed towards the train. Doors were being slammed shut and the whistle blew to announce it was about to leave.
John watched the merchant ship swerve away from them and into the shallows of Hassel Island. The ship would be out of the way of any cannon balls from the Lone Star but it might aground in the shallow water. But the British naval ship shifted to sail closer to them. Putting itself into the line of fire. At the heading they were both traveling, the two ships would collide. John turned the wheel again to port. His ship rocked as McMath fired again at the Lone Star.
John took Sherlock’s hand and collapsed back down on the edge of the bed. He set his pistol down on the nightstand and bowed his head.
“And Moriarty didn’t try for a head shot.” Sherlock smiled.
Flashes of memories played across Sherlock’s closed eyelids. Moments and people. He sighed as he thought about Victor and how angry he was when they had gotten home from Sherlock’s tutoring session with John. Sherlock’s wrist still hurt from where Victor had twisted it up behind his back before he shoved him down across the table and pulled his trousers down. Victor had been brutal. Claiming Sherlock as his own. Ignoring the other man’s pleas. But Sherlock knew the heroin would take the pain away and Sherlock would endure anything as long as Victor would stay and not leave him.
The flat side of John’s sword slapped down hard on Lestrade’s wrist. The man dropped his sword – it rattled on the deck when it landed.
“It’s alright, John. So your alpha is . . . cheating on you?” He was going to kill Holmes.
“After the trial.” Mycroft held his hand out to his brother. “I promise.”
Mycroft coughed silently. She smiled again.
“Please, Lord Holmes. Don’t make me . . . tell you. Please!”
Mycroft stared at John’s open expression. He felt a stab of guilt run through him. How different his brother’s life could have been if John Watson had stayed with him seven years ago. What kind of man would Sherlock be now?
John ran up the stairs two at a time.
“Preliminary examination states that.” Dimmit sneered at the omega.
“You trust my decisions?”
“Yes.”
~^+^~
John took another step forward. His hands clenched. His shoulders rounded for attack.
“What?” John gasped for breath. He hadn’t run that hard since leaving the Helmand district.
The heroin finally reached all of Sherlock’s receptors. His body sagged and slid further down the wall. He laid naked on the floor of the bathroom as the drug took away his anguish, both physical and emotional. He was floating away on a blue sea. The same shade of blue as John’s eyes.
"John, I can assure you that he is fine."
"Well, It's quite childish, really. I'm not-"
"That wasn't answering my question, Sherlock. What are you doing up here at five in the morning?" Mycroft asked, giving him a you-better-answer type of look. Sherlock rolled his eyes before plopping back down on the grass.
"Yeah, yeah." But John wasn't convinced. When Sherlock went silent, it wasn't because he wanted to.
Sherlock Holmes was a strange man, though anyone could tell just by the fact alone that he wears a coat and scarf in the middle of August. He knew it aswell. He was different, in a way that he wished for all humans he'd ever encountered to be. Those who were boring stayed boring, those who were too predictable stayed too predictable. But for a man like him to travel across England just to watch the sunrise, he wondered where exactly he stood. Surely he was the same, because doesn't everyone need a sense of calming in their lives? He knew that his sense would be the rising and setting of the sun, strange though that may be for a man of his standard. Yet, he didn't care for those who thought of him weirdly just because he liked to watch the sun upon the horizon. He was sure others found that pleasure as well, it surely wasn't just him. Although, the thought of having a found pleasure of something so strange and common with other people made him frown. Maybe he was too emotional, too normal, just as his brother used to say.
“You’re lying.”
