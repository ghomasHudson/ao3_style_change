“For how much? ‘Cause we could spend way more than whatever they’re offering buying shit we don’t need and will NEVER use again.”
Charlie shrugs. “So keep doing what you’re doing. I checked with a pining sickness specialist and they said as long as you’ve got something to scent when you’re not together, you’ll be fine. So maybe just exchange clothes whenever you’re there for his rut and you should be alright between appointments.”
“Why would we never use it again, Dean? I don’t understand. Halloween takes place every year on 31st October, does it not? Surely, we would use them again next year, and maybe the year after that?”
Dean lurched slightly before gaining his balance and yelling down the phone at Sam, “You let Gabriel into the Bunker? Really, Sam”
Castiel flushes, rubbing the back of his neck. “Let me help you, I should put a bandage on your shoulder.”
“Yes, I got that feeling from her as well,” Cas murmurs, hand stroking low over Dean’s belly. It’s a little weird but it feels damn good, so Dean’s not about to draw attention to it and make Cas stop. Besides, he’s well aware that the alpha has a breeding kink, maybe this is just part of it. A tiny part of Dean’s brain dares to hope that it’s something akin to mating hormones, but he shoves that back into the box it leaped out of. It’s far too early for that kind of thinking, especially when Castiel is still technically a client.
“Oh,” Castiel says eloquently, frowning. “What do you need me to do? I’ll help with anything I can.”
He snorts. “No, Luke is still very much in charge of the company. Rowena McLeod has given us the opportunity to do an episode of
dates with clients. Whatever you two do in the comfort of your own apartments is none of my business,” she says suggestively, raising an eyebrow as if to ask if Dean understands her meaning. He smiles gratefully at her, nodding.
“C’mon, alpha, want you,” Dean pants, groaning as Novak leans down to kiss him. The alpha doesn’t waste a moment sliding two fingers into Dean’s slick-filled hole, moaning as he’s met with evidence of Dean’s arousal.
Cas pulls him onto the couch and snuggles against his side as he flips through the folder. He gets to the plane tickets and his eyes widen as he turns to look at Dean. “Rome? You got us a trip to Italy?”
Normally stealing food from Dean’s plate would be a massive red flag. This morning, Cas could have at it.
Castiel frowns, thumb idly brushing the bandage. “Still not an excuse. I could have accidentally mated you, Dean, why aren’t you more concerned?”
Castiel’s eyes flash at that, but he forces himself farther away. “I need a proper answer, Dean. I won’t take advantage of you just because you’re in heat. Do you want to stay here? I’d be happy to share your heat with you.”
Castiel chuckles, fingers carding lazily through Dean’s hair. “My mother was one of six and my father was one of five, we were pretty much destined to be a large family.”
Castiel raises an eyebrow, downing half of the glass before responding, “Why, because you’re an omega?”
“Look, just because he may or may not be coming here for me doesn’t mean it’s because he’s interested. Maybe he just enjoys my sparkling personality.”
Cas perks up when he realizes Dean isn’t joking, a soft smile on his lips. “I’d suspected it, mostly because of what Dr. Nally said a few episodes ago. I sort of wrote it off, though, because really, who would’ve believed that?”
, the highest-grossing HGTV show on the planet. It’s a force to be reckoned with and it’s launched the careers of more than a few contractors and house-flipping enterprises. Their company, Angelic Houses, has even hired a few people from the show. It pits two teams against each other and it takes the teams and the audience through the entire process—picking the house they’re going to flip, the process of actually designing the house and constructing the design in the real world, and getting it on the market and sold. It’s the exact process Castiel wants to be a part of, given the opportunity, so he flips through the documents in the folder. It would pit him against Luke, which was rather obvious, given the circumstances. He’d have to find his own team since it would technically be him against Angelic Houses, which is moderately worrying. The only contractors he knows are the ones that work for the company, he’s not even sure where he would begin trying to find a team he could trust enough to execute his eventual design, not to mention go against all the talented contractors employed by Angelic Houses.
“I’m sure I’ll be more than happy with whatever you make,” Castiel says softly, grinning at the shy smile that makes itself at home on Dean’s face.
Dean tenses, clearing his throat. He’s not used to his alpha clients being so affectionate and it’s throwing him off. Not that he
Dean throws a pleading look toward all of his friends, but none of them pay him any mind. Instead, they lay down the filthiest cards they possibly can on the first card and Dean wants to crawl under a rock and die. To his surprise, the filthiest and funniest of the bunch turns out to be Castiel’s. Huh. Maybe this won’t be so bad after all.
Castiel hums, carding a hand through Dean’s hair. It drags a purr from low in Dean’s chest, rumbling in the empty space between them as Dean leans into the touch. “I’m sure she’d find something for you. She spoke very highly of you when I met with her.”
could probably fall for that guy. I just need to know if I can approve you for his rut this month or not.”
Dean hums and bags the cupcake with Cas’s muffin, sliding the bag across the counter. “We’ve got this courtyard out back with a big wall that we can project movies on. We’re gonna start doing movie nights in the summer on Saturdays. This week’s the first Lord of the Rings if you’re interested in seeing it?”
Castiel blinks at him and glances at the popcorn machine. It only seems to dawn on him then that he looks like he’s trying to buy food. “Oh! No, apologies. I was going to ask if you’d like to join me since Meg appears to have found herself a date, but since you’re busy—”
Dean hums. “I’ve always wanted a big family. It was just me and Sammy growing up, woulda been nice to have some other kids to play with.”
How Gabriel had managed to record him and Dean while they were having sex, Castiel didn’t even want to contemplate yet. All he knew was that his brother was perched on top of his station, legs crossed and a shit-eating grin on his face and Castiel wanted to tear it off of him.
The room fell into awkward silence again, until Gabriel stood up, stalked across the room, grabbed Dean by his face and laid a loud, smacking kiss on him. It was basically Gabriel’s stamp of approval, which Dean knew he already had, but he appreciated the trickster being open about it here. Dean let the obnoxious kiss happen, only rolling his eyes when Gabriel pulled away.
He paused another moment, hoping Cas would come up with the rest on his own but was once again disappointed in the angel’s blank stare. He rolled his eyes and continued.
Charlie sighed in relief. “You’re a lifesaver. We haven’t really done much to the place since we moved back in after the fire.  I didn’t have a chance to clean, and Jo’s been working double shifts to save up and things have been so-“
They were almost through with lunch when it happened. It was innocent, completely harmless and probably occurred daily. It was undoubtedly something Dean had heard countless times before while sitting in that cafeteria, possibly even in that very seat. But this time, when it happened, Dean thought he might die.
He took a few settling breaths before opening the door, where he found the same handsome man he had met three years prior. His hair was shorter and his clothes nicer, but he looked pretty much the same. Castiel however, had changed his style significantly over the last three years. Trading in his Converse’s for Steve Madden’s and his earbuds for an approachable smile.
Dean rolled his eyes and let his pouting expression pull into one of acceptance. “Fine,” Dean replied, “Be that way.” He picked up his keys from the coffee table and put them in his pocket. “Come, eat my food, then leave me all alone,” Dean started walking towards the front door but turned back abruptly, pointing at the doctor with a superficially stern expression on his face. “But don’t expect me to put out. I’m not that kind of girl.”
Castiel grinned at his brother for a moment, and then his smile fell. “Did it get better or worse after we left?”
“Everything we need,” Dean finishes. He closes his eyes and shakes away the phrase. It’s not right. It’s not true. Except it obviously is because he’s in Heaven and he just needs to get in Baby and drive. That’s all he needs. Him and Sammy will get in the car and just drive until—
“Well, yeah, man. You just show up here and…” Dean doesn’t know what he wants to say because he doesn’t know why he’s bothered. The scratchy feeling that used to ebb and flow is now suffocating him. He can feel it clawing its way under his skin.
“Nothing specific.” Meg replied. “Just that you seemed distracted lately. Asked if I knew if there was something wrong.”
Sam nods. “Yeah… I… I don’t know how to describe it but… I mean, I’m happy. This is Heaven. It’s perfect and we have—”
“I wonder if we’ll have to wait in line,” Dean said softly, groaning when Castiel’s tongue dipped out of his mouth to lap at the little spot where his jaw met his neck.
Castiel’s entire body began to shake. He shouldn’t be reacting this way, this was probably just another day on the job for Dean, but Castiel had built a very strong wall between knowing what Dean did for a living and
Dean couldn’t help himself, he stood up and tried to walk over to Michael, but Castiel caught his hand. He pulled him back, but stood up with him. “Dean, why don’t we go get settled. We can join my siblings again in a little while.”
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how fucked up it was that I thought of myself that way. Not that I was willing to sacrifice myself for my friends, because, that’s just the human being in me, but the part of me that sacrificed just for the sake of sacrifice. Ever since my mom, it's like... If I do this, maybe…”
“No!” Dean says quickly, hand up to stop Castiel from completing an incredibly stupid sentence. He walks slowly around the car to stand in front of him. “No, I—that was for Chuck.”
“Come on,” he said quietly. “If you come with us, I’ll get you something disgustingly greasy and fried before we head back to the hospital.”
“Well, you already know Jimmy and Gabe. And they aren’t like that. They’ll be good buffers. It’s going to be fine. Trust me, man. Things are never as bad as you think they’ll be.”
Their shower was shared, silent, and screaming. Dean held him, kissed his neck and hummed into the slide of Castiel’s hands across his back, but they said nothing. Once clean, they fell into bed, damp bodies dragging uncomfortably against sheets and skin. They were touching, but the distance was suffocating.
“Oh hush,” Charlie shook her head. “Just put those up on the walls around the living room and hallway. The DJ will be here to set up soon so I want to have the decorations set up before then. I don’t want to get in his way.”
He swallowed again as he pursed his lips, looking to his brother’s anxious stare before bringing his attention back to the angel before him.
“Taking in a sixteen year old is quite a big step, Dean,” Castiel said. He looked down at the table between them, and the back up to Dean. “You realize what you’re saying, don’t you?”
“Inias?” Castiel repeated. His face had morphed from concern to something more fearful. “What about him?”
Dean coughed awkwardly at the strange method of questioning, but nodded. “Uh, yeah. I have a younger brother. He’s a lawyer. Married with a son. Twins on the way. Both my parents have passed.”
Dean couldn't help but flash through the various things he wanted to do with Cas in this moment. They were inches away from his bed and Dean couldn't stop thinking about what it would feel like to take his thumb and smooth out the confused wrinkles forming over Cas’ forehead.
Dean nodded. He watched Castiel head toward his dead lover on the east side of the cemetery, but refused to stare after his boyfriend like a kicked puppy.
“Actually, according to Collette, you're wrong Sam.” Cas shifted his gaze to the outline of Deans’ body in the car. He could almost see the lines of tension radiating off of him. “The story of Cain and how he killed his brother, Collette, and Abaddon- Collette made the parallels to our own situation very clear.”
Castiel moved slowly further into the house. He found an empty sitting room, aside from piles of jackets, and school pictures of Dean and his little brother along the wall. He took a moment to admire those, before moving further into the house.
“Raj,” Castiel replied. “No last name, though, and I am assuming Raj is short for something longer.”
“You’re right,” Charlie agreed with a smile. She leaned in to kiss her cheek. “Your mom is awesome. I’m glad you have her.”
Dean refrained from letting another joke slip through his lips, instead focusing his attention on the left over pumpkins that needed to be put up. He’d start working on the orange fairy lights next. Dick pulled his equipment into the apartment a few moments later and began setting up his station in the corner. He worked quietly, but Dean could tell the man was looking at him from time to time.
Just as Castiel reached for him, his red cheeks somehow even more attractive than the genuine smile he was managing, the bedroom door opened. Gabriel walked in wearing a Pilgrim’s hat.
Castiel narrowed his eyes slightly, obviously confused as to where the conversation was going. “All right…”
“Actually, you’re not too off the mark there.” Dean said, pullin g out of the gas station and heading back towards the highway. “Lisa said she didn’t want to be number three or four in my life. She said, she was okay with being number two, but not if number one was selling air fresheners online.”
“Let’s get out of here.” Castiel said blankly, still unsure of anything but knowing he needed to run.
When Castiel got to Dean, he wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and Dean pulled his arms around Castiel’s waist, just as Castiel had instructed him to do.
Castiel noted the ash on the floor under the oven as well as the several large splotches of brown juice on the counter and floor near the sink. It looked as if the meat had been dropped several times. Castiel caught Dean watching him and planted on a smile. The firefighter saw through it immediately and groaned. “It’s awful. I ruined everything.”
He’s wearing his cheekiest grin as he pulls out his keys and moves toward the car. His feet feel heavy until they don’t. As he reaches for the door handle, his hand shakes until it doesn’t. He frowns as he settles in his seat and Sam slides in beside him. The seat feels off, scratchy despite the denim divide, but by the time the key is in the ignition, he’s smiling again.
He’s just through the first wave of his heat when he hears the apartment door opening and keys being tossed on the glass table right next to it. “Dean?”
“Alpha, breathe,” Dean says with a chuckle, placing a hand over Castiel’s. “I would love to go on an actual date with you. It doesn’t have to be fancy, though. I don’t care about that stuff. Just a burger and maybe a good movie is fine.”
“I want to,” Dean assures him with a shy smile, returning the kiss Castiel gives him. “‘Sides, as long as I’ve got you there, I’ll make it through the flight.” He grimaces. “Probably.”
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Dean mutters petulantly, grabbing a bag and getting Benny’s cookies for him.
,” Dean whines, clenching around his fingers. “Need your cock, alpha, c’mon, fuck me right against your counter, breed me good.”
They step back outside, and Cas takes a cautious sip, nose wrinkling as he does so. Dean chuckles quietly to himself, heart clenching at the allure of the angel before him.
Novak smiles, sitting on the bed and typing quietly on his phone. Dean sits in the armchair and sighs as he sinks into it. It’s just as comfortable as he’d expected. He smirks to himself, taking a moment to observe the alpha in front of him.
“Kinda, yeah. Few kids, maybe. Always wanted a dog.” Castiel tilts his head at that, so Dean explains, “My apartment doesn’t allow pets and we couldn’t really afford one growing up.”
Cas huffed. “But that is not what Halloween is really all about, is it? It is about the souls of the dead, the…veil being between this world and the other being thinnest.  Did I get that correct?”
Novak rubs his eyes, inhaling deeply. “Uh, depends. The first two days, usually a couple of hours. Last few days are normally six hours between spikes.”
Castiel blinks up at him, eyes clouded with sleep. Slowly, he smiles and sits up, rubbing his eyes. “Thank you. You don’t have to do that, you know. I’m fully capable of taking care of myself.”
Dean frowns, stepping out from behind the counter and wrapping his boyfriend in a tight hug. Cas burrows into the embrace, arms winding their way around Dean’s waist. “That’s awful, Cas, I’m so sorry.”
Dean smiles and shrugs. “Yeah. I thought I needed a better opportunity but now seemed like as good a time as any.”
“Well if it isn’t my favorite customer,” Dean says with a grin, already gathering things for Cas’s afternoon tea. Castiel leans against the counter with a smile, though it doesn’t reach his eyes, so Dean abandons the tea and heads for the counter. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
“I used to be like that.” Castiel hums, shrugging. “The last few years, I’ve been nesting during my ruts, which is… odd, to say the least. I don’t exactly have time to find a mate, much less have pups. I suppose this is my alpha’s way of showing his displeasure that we have no one to care for,” he says with a wry smile, head tilted to the side as he watches Dean. There’s a glint of something in his eyes, though Dean can’t exactly put his finger on what it is.
“You should have told me about your heat, though. You haven’t had a heat since you started suppressants, did you go to your doctor?”
Cas sounded so excited that Dean couldn’t bring himself to disappoint him. Well, not until he’d drunk at least two cups of coffee and eaten some bacon drenched in maple syrup. So, he nodded his assent and went back to get that all essential first cup.
It doesn’t last for long. Only a moment later, Novak’s fingers grab at the hem of Dean’s shirt and tug at it, trying to get it over Dean’s head without breaking the kiss. It’s oddly adorable, but Dean knows the longer they drag this out, the worse the spike will be for the alpha, so he steps away and quickly disrobes. The alpha lets his robe fall to the floor before tugging Dean to the bed, nuzzling his scent gland.
Dean huffs, crossing his arms over his chest. Frankly, he could probably benefit from some therapy, but there’s no way he’s admitting that to Missouri, she’d march him right into the therapist’s office herself. “He’s probably not even my true mate anyway. Aren’t those, like, super rare?”
you to go. Do you want to go? I won’t keep you here, omega, but I’d love to help you through your heat if you’ll let me.”
“If Sam says so, it must be true,” Dean muttered leaning back in his chair. “So, what exactly is it we win for the best-dressed house?” Maybe there’d be an epic prize that would make pretending that he didn’t know the truth worth it. Doubtful, but a guy could dream of getting free food and booze, couldn’t he?
Luke heaves another sigh. “I don’t think I can let you take on a full project in good conscience, Castiel. You’ve never been through the process.”
“You got your angel boyfriend, and I have my angel bestie. Give us a few minutes to check the lore and see what damage you could do…um, hold on a sec…why? Why do you need to know this hypothetical question?”
Cas visibly deflates, shoulders sagged with relief,.. and grins at Dean, bringing his hand to his mouth and kissing Dean’s knuckles gently. “That sounds perfect.
Charlie nods, leaning across the table to place her hand over Dean’s. “As long as you’re okay, I don’t care if it happens again. I get you think it was unprofessional, but we didn’t receive a complaint from Castiel and you did all the right things, based on what you told me. You offered to leave, you left it up to him and he
“Dean? Are you okay?” Charlie’s voice bounces off the tile walls in the bathroom, making Dean’s head ring.
“So, where do you want to start?” Dean asked, hands bunched up in his pockets to keep them from getting cold.
Dean almost drops the cupcakes he’s rearranging, spinning around to find Castiel leaning against the makeshift concession counter. “Oh, uh, kinda. I’m watching from back here. Charlie’s been… otherwise occupied, so I’m in charge of snacks.” He pauses and wipes some stray icing off his hand, clearing his throat. “Did you… want something?”
“You’re adorable when you’re flustered,” Castiel says with a cheeky grin, taking a sip of his coffee as Dean scoffs at him. “I’d love to attend. You’re sure Charlie won’t object?”
“For the love of…because, we aren’t staying here in Sioux Falls. What part of we’re here until Sam has sorted things out back at the bunker, then you and I are going back to Kansas don’t you understand.”
“Pining sickness, Dean. I think you have pining sickness. You need to go see your doctor. I’ll decline Lisa for you.”
Dean blinks at the paper, chuckling softly. If Castiel’s been carrying this around, he’s either in the habit of carrying around papers with his phone number on them
Dean nods quickly, wetting his bottom lip as he gazes up at the alpha. “Please, Mr. Novak, want that big alpha cock fucking me open.”
Castiel’s brows furrow in what looks like confusion, though that doesn’t make much sense to Dean. Why would he be confused?
“I suppose,” Cas said quietly and so obviously not agreeing with Dean. “While I can see the logic in them, given the nature of your, er, job…wouldn’t having them be somewhat of a…what is the phrase…aha…’bus man’s holiday’?” Cas had to do the air quotes. Luckily no-one was looking.
Castiel smiles a real smile, the first one he remembers having in a long time. “That’s all I’m asking for, Luke. Just the opportunity to learn.”
Castiel pressed a button on his camera and then ran over to the rock ledge to join Dean. He kept his hand over himself, which meant Dean still didn’t get a good look.
The hand in his hair stalled, frozen for a moment in time before it traveled down to Dean’s face and cupped his chin. Castiel gently lifted Dean’s face upwards so that their eyes met.
“Sam, tell me something.” Dean said, poorly attempting to keep his tone light. “What could have possibly possessed you to put that big ass nose of yours into my business?”
As Castiel led Dean through a labyrinth of hallways to reach his parent’s sitting room, he recounted the last time he’d been in there. He was fifteen, his father had just returned from a twenty-seven hour brain surgery, and was dead on his feet. Naomi was reading in her large floral chair, her hair pulled tightly back, her skirt suit grey and cold.
They stood next to his car, preparing to say goodbye, but Dean hadn’t a clue what to say. He had so many different thoughts racing through his head, he didn’t know which one to focus one. One of those thoughts was that Dean might have cheated on Lisa last night, which definitely wasn’t okay if that’s what he did. She had said break, but the tone was definitely more of  break-up.
Sam walked into Dean’s room slowly, unsure of what he should expect from his brother. He could see the strain of Dean’s tendons in his neck and wondered if he should anticipate a fight from his older brother. It was obvious Dean was struggling with a variety of emotions in the moment and Sam wasn't sure how best to help his brother. He watched as Dean cautiously brought his eyes up to meet Sam’s.
Sometimes when Dean was on a call, he would flip a switch in his brain. Buried deep within his supramarginal gyrus where his brain processed empathy, the switch enabled Dean to do his job more effectively. He never turned it off completely, but dimmed it, like the lights in a movie theatre. When he turned down that switch, Dean was relieved of feeling the things that had the potential to paralyze him on the job.  Assisting a birth on the side of the road? Textbook. The smell of burning flesh? Unpleasant sensory experience. Car accident victims screaming in agony? Noise pollution. However, there were some days when Dean couldn’t dim the switch no matter how hard he tried. He’d be on a scene and something would trigger him to search for that switch and it wouldn’t even be there. What he was seeing would be too hard to push through, too terrible to pretend he wasn’t affected by the sight of it.
“He didn’t love me anymore.” Castiel shrugged and began eating again. “If he ever did, I don't know. Said he was tired of watching me waste my time on frivolous hobbies.”
There was a picture of Castiel’s profile as he smoked a cigarette. He was obviously in the middle of talking, because his hands were up and he was gesturing, but Dean had taken the picture without him knowing. Castiel hadn’t smoked in over four years now, but the stress of his feelings over seeing those pictures was making him want to start again.
He imagined calling off the wedding and running away with Dean. Things like that don’t actually happen though, not in real life. Luke wasn’t some loser that Castiel could just discard, he was a good guy. A good guy, who loved him and wanted to commit to him for the rest of his life.
Dean was too stunned to react at first. He just stared at Castiel, who looked like he was standing at the edge of a cliff—terrified and ready to run. He knew he couldn’t let that happen, so the first thing Dean did was clutch tighter to Castiel’s hands. He didn’t know if there was something he should say, because something like this deserved a response, but he couldn’t think of anything good enough.
“I don't know Cas.” Dean said softly. He dipped his head down slightly, turning it slightly so that their mouths were almost aligned. Dean whispered, “I just want to see...” against Cas’ lips before gently pressing them together.
He was unwillingly grateful that the conversation with Gabriel had helped squash his nerves, however momentarily, but now they roared back to life. Castiel didn’t know how he was going to confront Dean about whatever it was that happened the other night, but he felt it was his duty. Not only as Dean’s boyfriend but as a doctor, to be sure that Dean was alright. What he witnessed was very similar to other PTSD episodes he had seen and there was no way he could just let that go. Things like that didn’t go away on their own and if Dean was going through something, Castiel wanted to be there for him. The doctor didn’t have a clue as to what had triggered Dean’s current mental health battle, but there had been other signs that the doctor could no longer ignore. Jumping at loud sounds, holding his breath at odd times, frantic searching for something…
Dean looked at Castiel again, his fingers stumbling over the chords that he had just barely learned. He gave him his most charming smile, before belting out the next part of the song.
Dean dipped his head back down to press his lips back to Cas’. He kissed him slowly and deeply. Cas responded by dragging his hand up to Deans hair and running his fingers around the back of his head.
“Like hell.” Dean retorted, turning his body to face Cas. They were standing so close Dean’s crossed arms were almost brushing against Cas’ chest. “I’m coming Cas. Aint shit you can do about it.”
Three minutes later, he tried again, this time leaving a very strangled sounding voicemail where he hoped he at least mentioned his name.
Once coated, Dean took his hand and wrapped it around both of their dicks. He used their precum to slicken them even more, and Castiel’s head dropped back at the amazing feeling of not only Dean’s hand but Dean’s dick as well, rubbing together and making Castiel’s eyes roll back in his head.
“I’m sorry.” Dean finally said quietly. “I’m just not ready.” He shook his head slightly. “For any of it.”
The man eyed Dean cautiously but seemed to like what he saw because his expression softened a moment later.
“I don’t know,” Castiel said with a smirk, emboldened by his boyfriend’s return to life. “I seem to remember some ass play just the other night…”
He was tall, not as tall as Dean, but tall for sure. He had on black skinny jeans and a blue and white plaid button down. He wore converse on his feet and earbuds in his ears. Dean couldn’t help but notice the way the jeans clung to all the right places on the stranger’s perfectly grabbable ass.
“You can go back to Earth. Live a life you choose. Or you can go to the real Heaven and rest eternally. It’s your choice.”
He watched as Charlie took pictures from her chair stationed in the surf. She insisted it was the best place to read, the waves crashing around your feet and nothing but the ocean straight ahead. She wasnt doing much reading at the moment though as she was craning her body around to take pictures of Sam and Clarence. She laughed as Sam finally managed to get the Frisbee away from the dog, insisting Clarence had taken it easy on him.
“Never met the man in my life,” She replied simply. “I live a few floors up and heard there was a party here tonight. Thought I’d get my free booze on.”
“Alright, I’m calling this shit show.” Meg announced, baby on her hip. “Just burn it down and collect the insurance.”
going on in the kitchen.” Dean made to argue but ended up just shrugging and throwing a thumbs up to Ben before following his brother into the kitchen.
“And nutritious,” Dean added with a corny smile. Castiel wrapped his hands around Dean’ s waist and put his chin on the firefighter’s shoulders.
When he turned around to head back in the other direction, there was a picture in the art gallery’s window that caught his eye.
“You don't get it Sam.” He paused a moment before bringing his eyes up to meet his brothers. “Maybe what she said about Cain was right, maybe that's how i feel about myself too...but that doesn't matter.” His voice changed then and came out harsher. “This is the way it is Sam. I am who I am and nothing is going to change that. Everything Collette said- all of it- it doesn't matter because it doesn't change a damn thing about our situation.”
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean said instead, because this time of year was all about giving thanks, and Dean was sure he didn’t’ thank his brother enough.
“Sammy.” Dean said in greeting, his head nodding slightly to his brother as he made his way to the fridge to grab a beer.
Dean and Castiel walked on eggshells as they packed up their individual lives and moved into a new one together. They retiled bathrooms and painted walls; installed ceiling fans and dimmer switches. They decorated their new home for Christmas, giggling over childhood ornaments and kissing under mistletoe. It was like a dream… but dreams only last so long.
He sat up quickly, the dream still fresh in his mind. He felt like he could still taste Cas in his mouth as he called out.
Dean met Charlie and Jo for lunch one week before he was to leave with Castiel to head east for Thanksgiving.
,” Dean moaned. He clung to the already disheveled sheets. Another cry escaped him as Castiel sucked him down. He vaguely heard the click of the lube top, concentrating only on the way Castiel’s tongue lapped at his tip, the way the doctor teased him, the way Castiel swallowed around him when he sunk down further.
He had to remember that what had happened in his dream with Cas, that wasn't real. What’s real is what is happening with the mark and getting close to Cas will only put him in more danger. Besides, Dean couldn't imagine Cas actually acting like he had in the dream anyway. There was no way the angel could reciprocate the kind of feelings that were coarsing through Dean at the moment.
Just like when he rebuilt his baby, Dean loved doing that. He was creating something there, he wasn’t just maintaining it. Making classic  cars not only work, but beautiful again?
Dean sank into the bench he was directed toward and stared down at the screen until the words made sense. He hated this feeling. He stopped smoking weed because he hated the way his brain would just cloud over until he couldn’t even think. He blinked several times and rubbed his hand over his eyes.
“My teacher says the Native Americans helped the Pilgrims with food and shelter, and that Thanksgiving is about recognizing that generosity.”
The hospital lights were giving him a headache. He had his head angled back as the doctor stitched up a nasty cut under his chin, and the damn lights were like firecrackers.
Dean had made that impossible anyway, of course, with his refusal to speak at all until Castiel answered his question about his breakup, which Castiel was even more uninterested in doing.
By the time the sun was setting, they had filled three rolls of film, one of which Castiel pocketed when he thought Dean wasn’t watching. It was probably the best day Dean had ever had with someone other than his brother, and he regretted having to say goodbye soon.
After a few moments, Dean couldn’t help but cough obnoxiously, forcing the girls to separate. He was surprised to find a blush running across Jo’s cheeks. He smirked at her.
Dean grimaced and shrugged helplessly. “I don’t know, Charlie. Death? Dying? Saving people? It depends.”
“Okay,” Dean replied, smiling. They leaned into one another and kissed again. This kiss lingered, overwhelming Dean with the love they had for one another. When Castiel pulled back, he brought the hand not holding Dean’s up to Dean’s face and stroked his thumb along Dean’s cheek.
“Anytime.” Castiel smirked and Dean had to kiss it. As their tongues pushed together, Dean opened the bottle and slicked up their cocks. He ground back down and slid them together and both men moaned in pleasure. Castiel began to scissor Dean open in earnest, working his fingers back and forth as Dean rolled his hips against him. They kissed so deeply they lost their breath and were forced to part for air.
They took their time getting undressed, but it wasn’t long before their T-shirts and pajama pants were on the floor. Their bodies moved slowly together, rippling with pleasure, kissing all the way through. Dean didn’t know if he could stand not kissing Castiel in that moment, and by the way Castiel clutched at his neck and wrapped his leg around Dean’s waist, he didn’t think Castiel could stand it either.
“What’s that supposed to be?” Cas asks, head tilted to the side in an adorably puppy-like fashion. He’s staring at the cupcakes Dean had painstakingly been decorating all morning.
“Hey,” Cas starts, fiddling with his keys. “I watch Doctor Sexy as it airs, I thought maybe you’d like to join me?”
Dinner is awesome. Everything is cooked perfectly and Cas even surprises him with a heart-shaped cherry pie he’d spent weeks learning how to make with Charlie. Dean feels kind of bad that he hadn’t spent that much time on his gift to Cas, so when he finally excuses himself after their pie to go collect his gift, he’s more than a little nervous. He returns to their living room with the folder in hand, nervously clearing his throat as he hands it to Castiel.
Dean raises an eyebrow, chuckling softly. “Well, as hot as you find it, we should clean up so we can actually use your kitchen while I’m here.”
Dean opens his mouth to reply but he’s hit with the thick scent of arousal in the air, and judging by the way Novak is looking at him, their time between spikes is up. Dean smirks, raising an eyebrow at the alpha. “Guess we should get started, then.”
The boy—Alfie, according to the nametag on the right side of his chest—nods, holding out the receipt. “Yeah, it’s all paid for. I need his signature, though, do you think you could…?” Alfie trails off, grabbing a pen from his pocket and holding it out to Dean.
“Charlie was pretty clear about company policy,” Dean says idly, deciding this is the best way to broach the topic. He’s betting Charlie gave Castiel the same speech she gave Dean. At least, he’s hoping she did.
Dean shoots a glare at his brother as Rowena snickers. “You both suck. Just… behave. Please? I actually like this guy, I don’t want you scaring him off.”
It dawns on Dean then that he wants to be one of those things for Castiel. He wants Cas enthralled with him, he wants to hear himself spoken about the way Cas speaks about things he loves. They’ve never actually said that to each other and the overwhelming urge to tell Castiel nearly overpowers him, but he keeps his mouth tightly shut. He wants it to be a special moment, not just lounging on Castiel’s couch one Thursday night.
Castiel grins, finishing his granola bar in silence. Once he’s finished, he shuffles closer to Dean and begins scenting his neck, sighing happily. “You smell incredible, Dean. Like… sandalwood and lavender. It’s perfect.”
“They’re these houses that some of the characters in Lord of the Rings live in. They’re basically little houses that are super nature-oriented. They make surprisingly cute cupcakes.”
Castiel growls, roughly tugging Dean’s jeans and underwear down his legs. He can hear the alpha’s knees hit the floor and then there’s a tongue prodding his hole, making him grab the counter as he grinds back onto Cas’s tongue. Two fingers join soon after, stretching him wide as Castiel tongue fucks him until he’s shaking.
Surprisingly enough, it didn’t take all that much convincing. Cas did make him promise to play some spooky music in honor of the holiday, which Dean readily agreed to. He had a playlist of all of his favorite scary movie songs, he would throw in a few rock songs here and there and everything would be perfect.
Cas doesn’t waste a moment drawing Dean close and nudging the head of his cock against Dean’s already slick hole. Dean tries to roll over and present but Cas stops him almost immediately. “I want to see you when I mate you,” he explains, smiling when it makes Dean flush.
He thinks about ignoring her advice, he really does. The only problem is, he doesn’t really want to. Sighing, he heads for the pharmacy near his apartment.
The last group of kids left around eleven that night. Castiel’s superhuman hearing couldn’t make out anyone else approaching the house, so they turned off the lights, unplugged the pile of skulls and the smoke machine, then lugged both into the house before locking themselves in for the night. Castiel agreed to a movie night, so Dean picked out his favorite scary movie and threw a bag of popcorn into the microwave. Castiel grabbed the beers while Dean dumped the freshly popped corn into a bowl, and then they both settle into the couch, pressed close from shoulder to thigh.
“It seems like a reasonable offer. It’d be good exposure for the company and you’d get your shot to flip a house on your own.”
Castiel breaks their kiss, nibbling his way down Dean’s neck as he opens the omega up on his fingers. “Smell so good omega, can’t wait to knot you, breed you full of my pups. You’d look so pretty swollen with our young, can already see you barefoot and pregnant making yourself at home in my apartment,” Castiel mutters against Dean’s scent gland, working a third finger into Dean. “Gonna knot you so good, omega, make you want that too.”
He can feel Castiel smirk against his neck as his hand slips down to palm Dean’s cock through his jeans. “You don’t have to act like you want me that bad, Dean.”
Dean nods, risking a glance up at Charlie. She really doesn’t look angry, just concerned. He smiles softly and flips his hand over to give hers a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll be okay.”
Castiel’s face is bright red so Dean straightens until his back is pressed to the alpha’s front and pulls him into a kiss. The bitter taste of blood is still in his mouth, mixed with the faint lavender of his own slick. Castiel sighs, slipping his arms around Dean’s waist as he returns the kiss, relaxing against him.
Dean puts his face in his hands, nodding. He runs his fingers through his hair, staring down at his lap for a moment before chancing a look at Charlie. She doesn't look mad, hell she doesn’t even look
“Knot me and then mate me, alpha,” Dean murmurs against his neck, lips curling in a smirk when his alpha shivers.
Dean’s not entirely sure how to take that, but he doesn’t want to be defensive and drive a wedge between a very important client and his company, so he straightens up and nods. “I am. Is that okay? I’m sure the company can find someone more suitable if you’d rather—”
Dean takes a sip of his coffee, nodding. “Yeah, she said my body had become accustomed to the suppressants so she switched the brand. Sometimes a heat slips through and it’s nothing to be concerned about unless it becomes chronic. Shouldn’t happen again.”
Castiel smirks. It’s a great look on him and Dean can’t help but stare for a moment. “His kids always give him hell. But yes, the approaching break from school exacerbates the issue.”
Castiel stabs a piece of sausage angrily. “Just because you perceive me as a child doesn’t mean I’m entirely worthless, Luke. I’ve been designing houses for this company—
“She’s right, brother.” Dean turns to find Benny leaning against the counter, smirking. Dean rolls his eyes and tosses the towel on the counter between them, huffing.
Castiel raises his eyebrows. Dean can’t decide whether it’s surprise or whether the alpha is waiting for him to continue.
He takes his time examining the alpha’s apartment. He figures Castiel could use the rest; a little more time away from the alpha while he sleeps certainly couldn’t hurt. Besides, he’s curious.
, and Dean’s not really sure how to feel about that. Had she been expecting him to fall for a client this entire time? He thought he’d been a model employee, always treating his alpha clients well and catering to their every need during their ruts, no matter how strange.
Next thing he knows, Castiel is carrying him into his bedroom and laying him in the center of the huge bed, flipping the lights off and climbing into bed next to him. Dean immediately snuggles against the alpha, smiling when he hears the soft, content purr Castiel lets out.
“As far as you’re concerned, I’m good to go. Charlie gave me a peek at your file and there was nothing in there that should be a problem for either of us.”
Just as the judges rounded the corner, Castiel popped out from his hiding place. Dean fixed his eyes on the judges for their reaction. One, an older woman, looked positively scandalized, her hand fixed over her heart and a stern glare fixed directly on Castiel. The other judge, a college-age frat boy type, screamed so loud and high-pitched that it made Dean wince, before collapsing back onto the ground with a hand out to seemingly protect himself from the ax. Dean can’t help but cackle from his hiding spot, though it’s hidden by the music for the most part.
They spend the next couple of hours chatting, mostly about inconsequential things—Dean’s favorite movie, Castiel’s favorite book, the play going on at the local theater that Castiel wants to go see. It’s light and fun and heartbreakingly domestic, like Cas is his mate and they’re just talking about their days.
Dean drew in a deep breath. The things he did to keep Cas happy would worry him if he wasn’t so damn happy about them finally being ‘together’ together.
Once his knot goes down, he gingerly pulls out of Dean, groaning as he watches a mix of slick and cum drip onto the floor below them. “Fuck, I didn’t think that could ever be hot.”
Despite Charlie’s reassurances, the minute Castiel walks through the door—with Meg, nonetheless—all his nerves return full force and it nearly knocks him to his knees. Still, Charlie’s right, he doesn’t have anything to worry about. With that thought in mind, Dean plasters a grin on his face and hands two tickets to Castiel. “Glad you could make it, man.”
Dean can feel his face growing warm with a blush. “Yeah, Cas. Look, I just… I don’t want him to get the wrong idea. I’m definitely not anywhere near ready to mate or quit my job, but… I like him.”
Dean trails off as he sees the alpha’s eyes flash red, no doubt warning of a spike of his rut. It’s accompanied by the heavenly smell of fresh apples and… clean laundry? Dean’s never smelled anything so delicious in his life and it instantly has him gushing slick. Novak’s eyes darken at the smell and he quickly grabs the front of Dean’s shirt and yanks him into the swanky apartment. He can’t see much of it at the moment, with it being dark already, but from what he can see, it’s expensive. Hell, the living room alone looks like it’s larger than Dean’s entire apartment. “Can I scent you?”
Dean smiles and brings Cas’s hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. “It’s fine, angel. He’s sober now, and it pushed me to get out of there, it pushed
Castiel frowns and reaches across the table to rest his hand over Dean’s, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Novak blinks at him, his flush growing darker. “Right, of course, I’m sorry. I’m not quite myself at the moment. This way.”
Cas keeps his eyebrow raised, looking thoroughly unconvinced, but eventually, he lets it go and returns his attention to the finale. Dean’s missed most of it at this point, but that’s fine. He’ll watch it later on his own, he’d much rather enjoy his time with Cas anyway.
The light from the lamp glints off Castiel’s fangs, which really shouldn’t be as hot as it is, especially in a situation like this. The fact that Cas has any control over himself at all right now is impressive. “Omega, if you don’t leave now, I won’t be able to stop myself.”
Luke hums, flashing a charming smile at the waiter as he takes the billfold and tucks his credit card into it. “Let me shuffle some things around and I’ll see who’s available for observation.”
“I want to go to Earth,” Dean says in a rush. “I want a chance to live a life for me. I want…” Cas, he thinks. I want Cas.
“Understandable,” Charlie supplied. “I mean, she lost her parents and… well, you know. She’s not exactly out of the woods herself. She has to be so scared.”
“Even so,” Dean argued. “I’d have brought you to them afterwards too.” Dean reached across the table and placed his hand over Cas’. “I’d have wanted to show you off pretty much immediately.”
Just as Sam was rounding the corner Dean felt himself being pulled by his shirt forwards. Cas’ lips were on his own before he even had a chance to close his mouth. He wasn't really all that surprised though, this was the routine lately. As soon as Sam left the room, their tongues would be down each others throats so fast they would literally drop whatever they were doing.
“So when did you do it?” Dean finally broke the silence, picking his french fries apart and tossing them back to this plate.
kind of night—one Castiel wouldn’t give up for the world—which is why he had no desire to pose an ultimatum and force Dean to pick between him and his job. Castiel would never do anything to risk losing Dean, and he would never try to control him.
Two chapters back-to-back? Well, I couldn't leave you hanging like that. That would be mean and we've collectively had enough of that in this fandom!
Just as Castiel was being reduced to a gibberish mess, Dean came for the second time that night. He felt Castiel’s release inside of him just as the doctor moaned out his pleasure above him. Dean’s stomach was a mess now, but that didn’t stop Castiel from collapsing on top of him. With the hand not covered in come, Dean stroked Castiel’s back moving up to his hair when the doctor let out little moans.
Dean could feel what could only be described as a growl throbbing at the base of his throat and he swallowed hard to suppress it.
It may be a little weird to make out while sitting at your parents' graves, but Dean was pretty sure his parents would understand.
The angel was frozen under Dean’s lips for a long moment before Dean felt hands slide up his arms, grasping his biceps. Cas pressed himself into the kiss as he let out a sound that made Dean shiver and wrap the arm not currently cradling Cas’ face around his waist.
Unbeknownst to Dean, Sam would catch his brother staring into the backseat and shift uncomfortably in his seat to snap Dean out of his gaze and remind him to watch the road. Dean would plaster on his coldest expression and continue to drive the men to Oliver Pryce’s house.
“Oh, come on.” Castiel replied, turning so that they were walking into the park. “What do you care what my mother thinks of you?”
This morning though, Dean would much rather stay warm in bed. He has been busting his ass on a particularly difficult restoration at his garage, and he was up extremely late last night researching the ‘66 Mustang that was giving him trouble.
Dean smiled back at him, was ready to keep this banter going, but then the GPS chimed and instructed Castiel to turn down a street that Dean knew would lead to Alex’s house. His sullen mood returned as he stared out the window.
Dean did his best to relax into the memory foam that now supported his body. He was thinking over the nights events in the privacy of his bedroom, trying his best to work out the details of what had happened.
“Fine Sammy. Whatever.” Dean got up from the table and went to the fridge. He saw the beer on the top shelf but resisted the urge and went for a bottle of water instead.
“Hey! I’m listening man, but all I’m hearing is that you want to basically kill yourself so that I can be the waste of space I was before. Well guess what buddy? I’m not going to let you do that. I’m not going to let you cripple yourself into something you don't want to be, just for me. Not again man, I cant do this to you again.” Dean turned around and moved closer to the wall again. The mark was burning into his skin, screaming terrible things and fueling the rage that was begging to be released.
beautiful. The muscles in his abdomen flexed with every stroke as he bit down on his lower lip. Castiel’s other arm was angled behind his head as if he were a Playboy pinup and Dean’s bedroom was the set for Mr. November. There was a sparkle of mischief in the doctor’s eye and it drew Dean further into the room.
Castiel took a deep breath, steeled himself for the meeting to come, and squeezed Dean’s hand. “Are you ready for this?”
The smile on Castiel’s lips fell into a frown. “Just another minute and then I’ll take care of you. You do have burn ointment, yes? And bandages?”
…sure, crinkle. Dean didn’t know. He’s just putting one foot in front of the other and occasionally looking over to Castiel, who was already on his phone checking his messages as he led them to baggage claim. He had the cutest wrinkle in his brow, a sign that not everything was kosher in doctor land, but Dean was too foggy to really digest that. So he looked down at his phone and tapped aimlessly until the airplane icon was gone. He managed not to trip over himself or anyone else’s luggage, which was a feat considering how crowded the airport was. Sure, it’s Kansas, but it’s also Thanksgiving weekend so the whole world seemed to be coming and going.
He’s still not looking at Dean and Dean can’t stand it. It’s not right, this place is suddenly not even mediocre Heaven. It’s absolute hell and Dean’s too good for that. He knows that now. He’s better than this place and he deserves better than what he got. Frustrated, Dean reaches out and places a gentle hand across Castiel’s jaw, turning his face so that Dean can finally look into his eyes.
was there a lot to say—but they both seemed to know it wasn’t a good idea in that moment. The hug lasted longer than most hugs had any right to, but that was okay. He knew Castiel was mad, but he also knew that Castiel didn’t know how mad
“Hey Dean,” Sam replied, obviously cheerful over whatever he’s called Dean about. “We just got some of the babies’ tests back. Things are looking really good so far.”
His heart jumped in his chest as he saw their local hotel on the screen, flames roaring in every direction. The reporter was too far away from the scene for him to make anything out except for the flames that licked the sky and several fire trucks blocking the view from the ground. Castiel scrambled for the remote and turned up the volume.
Sam shuffled his feet uncomfortably for a moment. He stuffed his hands into his front pockets as he rocked on his heels, trying to find the best way to broach the topic that had them both so rattled.
“Oh geez.” Oliver dipped his head in his hands and shook it for a moment before bringing it back up and blinking furiously, like he was adjusting to the brightest light he had ever seen.
Dean raises his hand to knock on the dark oak door in front of him, nervous beyond belief. This isn’t normally something his company does since alphas in rut can be particular about who they have with them, but the regular escort that tends to this particular client is away with a different client. Everything normally would have been fine, but this client’s rut had come a week early. Meg usually has the time blocked out of her work schedule to accommodate this client’s rut, but with it being a week early, the company had no choice but to send another available omega. They already had his preference—or rather, nonexistent preference—for male and female omegas on file, so that won’t be a problem. As long as Dean passes the scent test Mr. Novak will undoubtedly administer, everything should be fine. Meg’s rates are a bit below Dean’s since he has seniority, but he’s willing to take the pay cut to help out a friend.
They spend the night snacking on popcorn and homemade cookies, watching the season finale of Dr. Sexy. It’s the happiest Dean’s been in a long time if he’s being honest with himself, and he’s ridiculously pleased that Castiel is the reason for it. He’s everything Dean’s been looking for—kind, smart, funny, and so adorably enthusiastic when it comes to things he loves.
As expected, Cas was standing forlornly by Baby’s passenger door waiting for him. “You’re late. That means we won’t be there when the store opens, Dean. I wanted to be there then, so we don’t miss anything. I want to win this competition.”
The things that the angel focused on so he could blend in with humans more continued to fascinate Dean. It would be the odd mannerisms and the lack of understanding of human idioms of speech or pop culture references that marked Cas out as ‘different’ not whether he was wearing a watch. In all honesty, Dean thought that if Cas was about to suggest they went shopping for Halloween decorations with Cas dressed in his suit and trench-coat on a Saturday morning, nothing would stop Cas from looking out of place.
Missouri shoots him an exasperated look. “He triggered pining sickness in you. Tell me, you’ve been through how many alphas in your years of doing this job? How many of them have triggered pining sickness?” Dean doesn’t answer, so Missouri huffs. “If that doesn’t at least make him a candidate for true mate, I don’t know what does.”
“Hey, don’t listen to her. She’s probably only doing this because someone asked her, and she couldn’t say no. She probably hates Halloween. Alright? We did a good job, and the kids are gonna love it.” Dean smiled, squeezing Cas’s waist lightly. “Maybe lose the ax though, hm? It may be a bit overboard. I’ll get you a metal pipe or something.”
Castiel smiles, lifting himself up to sit on the counter, crossing his ankles. “Sounds delightful. What are you going to make?”
“I can’t come in for a couple’a cookies? ‘Cause I’m sidin’ with Charlie in teasin’ you about your boyfriend?”
Castiel laughs, though this one is more of a rumble than the previous one. Dean can feel it against his back and it makes him shiver. “Well I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself, but I’m serious. You’ve earned the rest and I’m planning to head to bed anyway.”
Dean hands the receipt and pen back to Alfie, dragging the grocery bags into the apartment. He sets them on the island in the center of the kitchen, humming quietly to himself as he puts everything away. Thanks to Castiel’s ridiculously organized kitchen, he doesn’t have a problem finding a place for everything he’d ordered. He’s already got a few ideas for dinner that he’s excited to make.
Castiel sighs. “I know, but this is the least amount of help I can figure out. I don’t have time to find a contractor on my own and I know the people who apply are at least the cream of the crop. Usually.”
“I’m gonna take you right here, little omega. Make sure every surface of my apartment smells like you before you leave next week.”
Smiling, Castiel leans his head back against the arm of the couch and closes his eyes. “Sounds like you enjoy your job.”
Cas glares at her as he takes the seat next to Dean. Dean raises his eyebrows with a grin. “You watch Doctor Sexy?”
Castiel pulled the mask off and apologized profusely, helping the kid to his feet. The kid waved him off with a nervous chuckle, shuffling closer to the other judge.
Missouri Moseley is a kind but stern beta who’s been Dean’s doctor since he started working for Charlie. She’s intimately familiar with the things Dean does in his job and she’s never judged him before, which is why her outburst startles him.
Dean’s owned his own bakery for the last three years and, much to his relief, it’s been incredibly successful. He and Charlie had created an entire menu of geeky pastries and drinks, including some recreations of geeky foods. They’d assumed it would be a niche audience, but they have regulars that aren’t into anything geeky.
Dean scoffs. “I’m not head over heels for him, Charlie. He’s just… hot. Not my fault I have eyeballs and am susceptible to the wiles of hot men.”
Dean hums, waving a hand in front of himself as an indication for Castiel to lead the way. Castiel leads the way to his en suite, grabbing a bandage from the cabinet as Dean cleans the mix of slick and cum from his thighs. Dean leans over the counter and lets Cas clean the wound and then bandage it, smiling when Castiel presses a kiss to the bandage.
sweaty alpha. His hair is matted to his forehead, he’s got at least two days worth of stubble, and he’s wearing an old, fluffy gray robe that leaves exactly nothing to the imagination since he hasn’t bothered to tie it shut. It hangs open around jutting hip bones and a flushed, sweaty chest that’s currently inflating as Novak scents the air. Everything about the sight in front of him has Dean’s mouth watering.
Every Saturday at lunchtime, Torchwood Treats holds an open D&D campaign. It’s how he and Charlie met most of their friend group in the area. They haven’t had anyone new in a long time, so it’s surprising when the bell on the door chimes after everyone’s already arrived. Dean looks up and he can feel the grin forming on his own face when he sees Castiel. He looks nervous, which shouldn’t be as adorable as it is, frankly.
Smiling softly, Dean shakes his head and rests his forearms on the counter in front of him. “No, man, I’m just not really used to alphas being so affectionate while they’re in rut. They usually don’t want anything to do with me unless they need a hole to knot.”
He tries not to think about Castiel again, but he finds his mind wandering back at every opportunity. By the time he starts the movie and adjusts the projector until the picture is perfect, Castiel is all he can think about. He tries to pick him out in the dark crowd to no avail, so he tucks tail and heads for the concession stand.
Luke’s office door is closed when Castiel arrives, which isn’t entirely out of the ordinary. Lilith, his secretary, points Cas toward the plush chairs next to her desk to wait, so he settles into one and sighs softly. There’s no telling how long he may be waiting for Luke. It could be anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours. If something pressing within the company has come up, he may not even get to see Luke today.
Charlie leans back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest. “Well, I probably shouldn’t be telling you this, but Castiel’s got it too. He wasn’t sure if that was a problem for the company or not. I’ll tell you the same thing I told him—it’s not a problem for me as long as you two work out something you’re comfortable with. I know you don’t particularly want to mate after…” she trails off but Dean already knows exactly what she’s talking about.
The living room looks ridiculously cozy.  He rustles around the kitchen as quietly as he can manage, impressed with what he finds. It’s impeccably organized. The cabinet over the stove has almost every single spice and seasoning Dean can think of, which makes him incredibly excited to cook for the alpha later. He finds a box of granola bars in the pantry, so he grabs a couple and fills a glass with water, heading back to Castiel’s bedroom.
“Good god, he even knows how you take your tea? You two were practically made for each other,” Meg says with a shake of her head. Charlie and Benny snicker while Cas immediately turns bright red, focusing intensely on his tea.
Castiel blinks up at him and Dean realizes he’s never actually gone in-depth about his childhood. It’s probably time, and it’d make Cas feel a bit better. Decision made, he presses a kiss to his boyfriend’s forehead and lets him go. “Let me get your tea and I’ll get Charlie to take over for me and we can talk, okay?”
Meg plops into the chair next to Charlie. “Hang on, can we pivot back to the ‘no geeky stuff’ thing? You’re the geekiest person I know when it comes to Doctor Sexy.”
That’s a problem for another day. The rest of the information packet is pretty straight-forward. Each team would bring forward three houses along with their designs and budgets for each of them. They’d then be able to choose whichever house they wanted, given that the budget was approved by the higher-ups at the show. The show would purchase the houses for them and put in all the renovation money so neither Cas nor Angelic Houses would be liable for anything. Three impartial judges, who weren’t part of the process, would then come in to judge how everything was done, from the house that was chosen to the overall design down to how it was staged for sale. It’d undoubtedly be a grueling process, but the more Cas reads, the more he wants to participate.
Cas’s face seems to fall, though it’s smoothed out before Dean can figure out why. Meg clears her throat and steps away from Castiel.
“Look,” Dean starts, idly cleaning off the counter while they have a spare moment to breathe. “He’s just a customer, okay? Even if I do like him, it doesn’t matter. He’s nice to everyone, it’s not like he singles me out or anything.”
“I’ll think about it,” Luke finally acquiesces, nodding. “It’d be on an internship basis, you wouldn’t be able to touch anything within the process, just observe.”
“Not badly abusive, no. My dad wasn’t the greatest parent for most of my childhood—he was drunk more often than not, he could hardly hold a job down, and he tended to take his anger out by yelling at me and Sammy. I took the worst of it, I tried to keep Sam out of it as much as I could.” He sips his coffee, shrugging. “That kinda shit messes with your brain, so the minute I turned 18, I signed up for culinary school and got the hell out of there. Sam ended up staying with family friends for his four years of high school, thank God.”
“Oh, and then there’s the whole thing where my parents are dead. I’m completely alone.” She paused, tears springing to her eyes. “But don’t worry. That one’s on me, not you.” Dean decided not to comment on the beginning part of her outburst and just concentrate on the last bit. He did make a mental note to tell her nurse about the issue with her catheter, though.
Sam let out an exasperated breath before opening his mouth to speak the words he could no longer hold back.
“Yeah,” Dean panted. He reached between them and wrapped his hand around his own cock. “Me too, Cas. Me too.” His cock was still slick. His hand slid up and down easily as Dean stroked himself at a brutal pace. Castiel angled his thrusts so that he was hitting just the right spot every time he pushed into Dean. “Yes, right…
Of course, when Dean got to the subway station at the airport, Mr. TDB was there, leaning against the wall and smoking a cigarette.
Gabriel raised both hands and grinned. “Wouldn’t dream of it. I’ll just wait for you two in my room. When you’re through we can dish like school girls.” He headed towards Castiel’s bedroom door and flicked his fringe off of his face. He did his best valley girl impression when he told them, “Like, don’t forget the vodka,” and then he was gone.
“You know what you’re doing,” Dean said, pointing at his brother with his full fork. “You’re already picking out wedding china or some shit and that just ain’t it. We’re just living together. So cool it.”
Dean growled. He just wanted to fuck the doctor’s beautiful mouth, but Castiel insisted on pulling off and teasing him every other second. Dean loved it.
Dean was an excellent dancer, swinging Castiel around the floor brilliantly and moving in rhythm to the music. When a slow song came on, he pulled Castiel in expertly too, and swayed easily with Castiel in his arms.
Charlie just started at him. Dean occupied his hands by bringing the burger to his face, but as it inched closer he realized he might throw up if he ate at that moment. He put it back down and sipped at his water instead.
Dean ignored Castiel’s new information and made his way to the attic access. A string hung down from the ceiling and it seemed to be swaying slightly. Dean smiled.
The sight of it, with his dick in Castiel’s mouth as Castiel stroked himself, made Dean ache with pleasure. The doctor’s tongue worked wonders around the tip, lapping up the sensitive area and then taking Dean all the way down again. He repeated the pattern a couple times, always letting get to the edge before changing up the rhythm again. It was maddening, but Dean loved that too.
Dean was by his side a moment later, just as Castiel was trying to stand up. Dean’s hands were under his arms and helping him up before Castiel could protest.
“Hmm?” Castiel replied; already back to Dean’s neck and kissing it softly. It was enough to distract Dean from what he thought he heard and get back to his man. He rubbed his hands up Castiel’s arms and then began to back away towards the bathroom.
“Cas’ parents will constantly compare me to Inias. His sister will point out all my flaws. His convict of a brother will video call in and threaten to kill me. Gabe will team up with some distant cousin and trick me into releasing a sex tape. And Cas…”
Dean’s eyes shot open at the command, but Castiel was already turning away and walking down the hall, leaving his discarded shirt in his wake. He was lucky enough to get a glimpse of the doctor’s ass before Castiel disappeared from view. The feeling had returned to Dean’s legs, but he didn’t know if he could get going as quickly as his mind wanted him to. Dean knew that when he walked into the bedroom he was going to get fucked good and proper. He thrilled at the thought of it. It’d been a few weeks since he’d bottomed. The last few times they’d had sex there hadn’t been time for prep and before that Dean had spent an entire evening devoted to the doctor’s backside. He loved teasing Castiel, rimming him to near completion then pulling back just to bring him to the edge again. He loved the sounds the doctor made. That night Dean had tortured Castiel (and himself) for an hour before he finally slicked himself up and slid inside the doctor. Of course, they both came embarrassingly fast. Extended foreplay can do that to a guy.
“Alright, Alright,” Dean groaned. He opened the door with a sigh. Jo stood there with her arms crossed. “You couldn’t wait another minute?”
’ like it was some sort of curse. He guessed the doctor didn’t feel the time frame was long enough. “You’re ruining my serenity here, Cas.”
“You think she’d want me living in her father’s home? My brother and I did not get on,” she says with a laugh. “If he knew I was sleeping in his bed, down the hall from his daughter, he’d die all over again.”
“Dean, I’m not asking you for anything.” Cas said quietly. “I simply would like to relay my own thoughts on our relationship,” He paused for a moment before adding, “And then perhaps when you are ready you can do the same.”
Sam is quiet. He talks a little about his wife and son, tells Dean some stories that make him laugh until he cries, but mostly the ride is quiet. They just drive and drive and… drive. The road doesn’t change, doesn’t curve. Dean wonders if he even needs to steer. He keeps his hands on the wheel because he loves driving Baby. It’s all he’s ever really wanted to do. He thinks. He thinks maybe he used to want to do other things, but this is better. This is—
Dean felt at a loss for how he should feel. All of his emotions were tugging him in various directions that led to all different places. He couldn't be proud of himself for not being strong, and pushing Cas away in the way Dean knew he should have. Dean also couldn't suppress the guilt he felt for letting Cas in just enough to hurt him. And of course, he wouldn't allow himself to feel the hope that threatened to spread through him at the thought of Cas returning the affection Dean had been so desperate to hide.
When he came, Castiel cried out Dean’s name, and enjoyed the feeling of Dean’s come mixing with his own when it fell onto his stomach.
He felt his heart begin to beat more quickly, his blood rushing through his veins at speed that made his skin vibrate. It was the first time he had seen Cas since he had his little church epiphany and now that he was accepting his feelings for him, he felt incredibly nervous to be around him. That combined with his constant impulse to inflict an incredible amount of violence on anything that was remotely difficult, Dean was on the edge of a cliff. He was preparing to fall but hoped that something could pull him back before it was too late.
Castiel smiled over his yogurt and muffin, but it fell a moment later. “I feel awful that you’re spending your Thanksgiving in a hotel room.”
Dean pulled himself out of the Impala later the next day, stretching out his back and grimacing. The station bunk beds were terrible. Mentally complaining about the downside to his full-time working status, Dean rounded the back of his baby and took his overnight bag out of his trunk.
The day had been long and hard and full of meetings and he really wasn't in the mood for this party, but he was going to plant a smile on his face because thats what good, supportive boyfriends did.
Dean let out a soft groan as he lifted his hips to meet the roll of Castiel’s. “Oh yeah, what’s that?”
So this is it! It may have taken me an absurd amount of time, but I finally finished the second part of this series. I have plans for more in the future, but I don't plan to start posting any other stories in this series unless I've already finished them in order to save people from the dreaded WIP!
“Uh- well I’ll let you two...talk.” Sam said carefully. He walked towards the exit, taking a quick look back to Cas who was almost cowering into the far corner of the room. He was concerned for his friend and wanted desperately to threaten Dean into being kind to the angel. Sam turned back towards the doorway and locked eyes with Dean. He didn't say anything but made sure his feelings were clear through the hard, unrelenting stare he gave his brother.
“Yeah me too,” Dean said under his breath as he moved aside to let the man in. He coughed again to hide his little joke. “Well, uh, Charlie said you could set up over there. You need help with your equipment?”
“I wanted to be closer to you,” Dean said quietly. “What you and Inias had…” Dean trailed off. He wasn’t ready to finish that thought. “I know how much you love him, and, I don’t know, I wanted to tell him that I was going to take care of you. I wanted him to know that you were loved and that you’re okay.”
The lines of confusion across Cas’ forehead were back, and Dean once again found himself moving before his mind had a chance to catch up. He reached his thumb up to Cas’ forehead and slowly rubbed across the lines, coaxing Cas to relax, as a small smile graced the side of Dean’s mouth.
Dean liked the sound of that. If they took this dilapidated house and turned it into something beautiful for them to share, Dean felt sure he could get out from under Inias’ shadow.
“Fine. Just get over here.” Dean said, feeling self conscious as he stood naked and alone on the rock ledge.
“Well, that’s comforting,” he said with a smile, leaning close to Dean and putting his arm around him. Dean laid his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean felt his face get hot, seeing his own naked body displayed like this for anyone to see. They didn’t
“You see a two minute exchange between strangers and you think you have insight into who they are?” The man said, eyes hard on Dean.
“Yes.” Castiel flicked his tongue over Dean’s Adam’s apple and enjoyed the shiver it elicited. He rolled his hips against Dean’s and enjoyed that reaction even more. “You know, there is another part of our first night together that I think we’ll end up re-creating.”
Dean spent the rest of the day with Castiel, walking around New York and taking pictures. He took more pictures of Castiel than the blue eyed man probably realized, but took a lot of the city for Sam too. At some point, Castiel put in a new roll of film and took over the camera. He set up some pretty incredible shots of the Brooklyn Bridge, as well as taking candids of Dean.
Forever is filling in the absent space neither knew how to name or care for. It’s in the silence and in the noise, the broken and the healing. Forever is a choice, one made continuously and together. Forever is acknowledging the unknowable future, accepting the unnamed loss; forever is the trust that they won’t have to do any of it alone.
As an unspoken celebration of taking the next step in their relationship, Dean and Castiel fixed an elaborate breakfast the next morning. Eggs Benedict from scratch, fruit salad, sausage links, and freshly squeezed orange juice.
The way Dean understood fate, was that if you were destined to do something or meet someone, fate would make it so. Was that what was happening with him and Castiel? Were they destined for one another?
“What if it takes twenty years?” Castiel asked, taking his shot too. “What if it takes twenty years to get your ducks sorted. Is that how long you’ll wait until you let yourself settle down with someone?”
“It’s a shitty thing for her to do.” Dean said as Castiel passed him the bottle of wine. “Not what friends are supposed to do. Exes are off limits.”
Dean had started back full-time almost four months ago, but today’s shift was the first Dean was going to be allowed back into his role as Captain. Bobby wanted to ease him back into work, where as Dean just wanted to get back out there as soon as possible. Kevin was ranking Captain when Dean was gone and he did a good job, but Dean was anxious to be back in charge. It wasn’t as if Kevin didn’t know what he was doing, it was just that Dean already felt responsible for everyone in his company and he didn’t like the idea of not actually being the one to call the shots. He had been out on several calls since he returned, but Dean hadn’t really felt like he was truly back to work. He wanted back in the driver’s seat, so to speak. The driving was actually Ash’s job.
“Yes.” Dean nodded. “But she knew going in what it would be like. Lisa started her own business a couple years ago, so she knows what its like at the beginning. It takes a few years for things to get settled down and stable.”
“Alright, alright,” Dean groaned. “I know. Burgers bad, grass and twigs good. Got it. Can we move on to the whole moving in together thing now?”
Cas let a pained look spread over his face before shaking it away. “Its our only plan Dean.” He turned to face his friend. “And I think its apparent that the mark continues to affect your behavior, so i think we should try everything we can.”
When he finally pulled the car door open, the men tumbled inside. Dean situated himself between Cas’ legs. Castiel arched his back into the contact.
The next day, Dean went to the hospital to check on Alex and have lunch with Charlie and Jo before his shift that night. The nurse standing at the nurse’s station near Alex’s room was reading over a chart and jotting down a few notes when he approached him.
Dean was stunned for all of ten seconds before he let out a laugh of his own. “Man, Cas, you’re on a role, aren’t ya?”
“Dean,” Castiel started, walking towards him and reaching for his hand. “It’s alright. I’ll call in for food now, and we can play something else. Let me see your hand.”
They found a hotel several miles down the road that had three rooms available. Jimmy and his family took the largest one, while Gabriel took the room adjoining Jimmy’s. Dean and Castiel shuffled themselves into a room two doors down from Gabriel’s, and collapsed on the king size bed.
He married Dean two years after Castiel crashed Sam’s wedding. It was a small ceremony, with just family and a few close friends. The wedding was held at the National Park they had pulled over at, the night they took the picture under the full moon.
“Six months,” she echoed. She looked over at Castiel’s father, who was watching the exchange quietly. “And you’ve brought him here?”
Dean thought about what he would want if he were here. If he had woken up and found out both of his parents were dead; if his arm was just barely attached to his body. If he were fifteen and surely and the world definitely seemed to be out to get him. He struggled with his thoughts for a long time. Alex eventually grew restless with the silence and let out a frustrated groan.
“Yeah, strangely, that ain’t exactly helping, Sammy,” Dean grumbled. He ran his hand down his face. “But yeah. I know Cas loves me. It’ll be fine. Even if it’s not, me and Cas will be fine.”
Dean sent another punch down to Cas’ face, delighting in the sound of Cas’ flesh tearing under his knuckles.
“You know,” Dean replied in a much deeper voice than he had used seconds before. “There are other ways of thanking me.”
Dean sipped his beer leisurely, watching Castiel dance with Charlie and Jo to a song he had never heard before but would now play on repeat anytime he masturbated to thoughts of Castiel. His eyes didn’t leave the doctor as Castiel swayed and rolled his hips, taking in the long lines of tight, black spandex. The mask covered one of Dean’s favorite parts of Castiel’s face, the little lines around his eyes, but he had a good view of the doctor’s smile.
“You know, it’s not like I even want him back or anything.” Castiel continued on his rant. “We were all wrong for each other, I know that now.”
“You know something, Dean?” She said after a moment, once she had gone back to her lunch. “I kinda love you.”
“Cas,” he whispered again and propped himself up enough to look down at the man beneath him. Castiel’s eyes were hooded in a post-sex glaze, but they cleared when Dean looked at him. He kept his eyes open as he leaned back down to press a gentle kiss against Castiel’s lips again. Castiel smiled beneath his kiss, and Dean had never felt such pure unadulterated joy before.
“And i don't know what exactly is going on with you...and how you feel...but i think if you don't let yourself feel it, you are only making things that much worse for yourself.”
Growing up, he felt like a foreigner in his own home. Even before his sexuality was revealed, Castiel had always been different. Gabriel was obviously similarly affected by the oppressive air that clung to every surface of the Novak home, but he was good at letting it slide right off. Castiel wasn’t so lucky.
“I’m just going to glide past most of that, and concentrate on the part where I’m not technically family,” Dean replied, rolling his eyes at Gabriel’s wicked grin.
“Oh shall we discuss criminal justice reform?” Michael suggested from the chair. “That should be a lively topic of conversation.”
They weren't exactly hiding their relationship from Sam, they had been caught a few times making out in various places around the bunker. But there was something about going in for a kiss in that moment that made his relationship with Cas that much more real. Another step Dean wasn't sure he was ready for.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I ain't going to become that thing again just so you have a playmate Crowley.”
This was their fourth trip since the mark had left his arm. They went every year. They also went skiing last winter, and took a few day trips to some nearby caverns.
“How does it look?” Castiel asked, wiping a tear as it pushed its way over his lashes and slid down his cheek.
Castiel hadn’t realized what he said until he saw Dean’s body tense slightly. At first, he thought Dean’s sudden change in demeanor was the firefighter’s stubbornness at wanting to get Gabriel back, but then Castiel realized what he had just implied.
“Fair,” Dean conceded, shrugging as he continued to eat his club sandwich. “But, dude, you have to admit, it’s going to be a shit-ton of work.”
Dean tried not to let that deter the reason he was there. He was going to lay it all out for him, he was going to put himself out there because not only did Castiel deserve the best, Dean had to know he tried. He didn’t want to look back in ten years and wonder what would have been if he had just
Dean looked at him through the dark like he wanted to devour Castiel, and Castiel absolutely loved that someone was looking at him that way, but he refused to be the one to act first this time. Dean was leaving, which pretty much sucked, but they had tonight and if they were going to use their time wisely, Castiel wanted the memory of Dean making the first move.
The alpha motions for them to sit, so Dean takes a seat next to him on the couch, shuffling a bit so they can face each other. Cas clears his throat, eyes locked on his hands that are resting in his lap. “I, um… I was wondering if you’d like to go out with me? On a real date, a nice restaurant or something?”
, alpha! Knot me, make sure everyone knows I’m yours,” Dean whimpers, knuckles white as he grips the arm of the couch, grinding back onto Castiel’s cock.
“Perfect,” the alpha murmurs, leaning back to meet Dean’s eyes. “I haven’t got long before my rut spikes again, so we should get everything out of the way now. How much will I owe you?”
Castiel scents his neck, not-so-subtly scent-marking Dean’s jaw. “Thank you for coming again. I know you were… apprehensive about returning last time you were here.”
Cas’s brow furrowed for a second before he snatched the plate off the table, scraped the contents into the trash can and dumped the plate in the sink. He looked at his watch, a cheap drug store one he’d taken to wearing because people who wore suits, also wore watches.
Dean nods, keeping his eyes on his plate as he finishes his pie. Charlie’s not only his boss, but she’s also one of his best friends and he doesn’t want to disappoint her. “I’ll do it. I can separate personal feelings from work ones, I’ll be fine.”  He sets his plate to the side and holds the warm coffee between his hands, frowning.
His alpha smiles and idly brushes his fingers along Dean’s side. “What’s your dream life, then? Classic American dream? Three kids, dog, house with a white picket fence?”
Castiel shoots him an exasperated look, though the corner of his mouth is tilted up into a smile. It’s an adorable look on the alpha and Dean kind of hates him for it. It’s really not fair that an alpha as attractive and nice as Castiel is allowed to exist, much less pay Dean for sex for a week and then never see him again. Still, Dean’s a professional, so he shoves those feelings into a box and hides that box in the deepest recesses of his mind. He doesn’t have time to fall in love with a client, especially a client who isn’t even his.
Dean follows the alpha down the hallway into a cozy bedroom with a huge four-poster king-sized bed in the center of one wall, like something you might find in a castle. There’s a pile of pillows against the headboard and an enormous blanket nest in the center of the bed, which is strange, to say the least. Alphas using a service usually don’t want to settle down, so they don’t usually nest during ruts. It’s not really his place to bring that up, though, so Dean examines the room as he sets his bag down. On one side of the bed is a comfy-looking sitting area with a black lounger sofa. There’s a couple of different game consoles plugged in beneath the TV and an honest to gods record player hooked up to speakers. Sure enough, he finds a bookshelf filled to the brim with records, everything from old classics like Beethoven all the way to Ed Sheeran’s latest album. The other side of the bed gives way to another bookshelf stacked with books and a comfy, red leather armchair with a couple of pillows on it. This is basically Dean’s ideal bedroom, should he ever be rich. Shaking that thought away, he turns to Novak and smiles. “How long do you typically have between spikes?”
Dean darted behind a display of scythes and broomsticks. He wasn’t out of angelic hearing range, but it was better than nothing. “I was hoping I could chalk some on the front windows, door and the signs on the gate along with some bio-hazard tape or something?”
hits him as soon as he pushes the bedroom door open, which is more than a little concerning. Castiel’s a client, nothing more. Shaking off those thoughts, he crosses to the bed and shakes Castiel gently.
Dean clears his throat, blinking a few times in an effort to avoid giving Novak another once-over. “Mr. Novak, my name’s Dean Winchester. I’m a colleague of Meg’s. She’s away with another client at the moment and won’t be able to make it back anytime soon. I’m here to fill in for her if you’re amenable.”
Missouri seems to get the hint, scoffing. “First of all, your job doesn’t define who you are and it ain’t something to be ashamed of. Heats and ruts are far simpler to endure with a partner, you should know that by now. Do I actually need to send you to a therapist?”
Castiel’s next rut is right on schedule. Dean shows up at his apartment on a Thursday night with several bags of groceries in hand and a duffle bag packed with a few changes of clothes and his grooming items. Castiel’s already in the throes of it, clearly. His button-up is unbuttoned and hanging loosely around his flushed body and there’s a noticeable bulge in his dress pants. Dean smirks, slipping past the alpha and dropping everything in the kitchen before allowing himself to be swept into Castiel’s arms. Castiel immediately goes for his neck, scenting him as Dean slips a hand down to cup his cock. Dean can already feel his knot swelling, so he starts to lead Castiel toward the bedroom. Instead, Castiel grabs his hips and bends him over the counter roughly, smirking as he nibbles Dean’s ear.
“Um,” Dean stalled, not entirely sure how he was going to answer yet. “I don’t know, Cas. What are you thinking?”
She lifted her cup. “I am grateful for my healthy daughter, my loving husband, and my friends at church.”
“Nah,” Dick replied. “I got a thing.” He took one look at where Dean was pointing then headed back out into the hall where his equipment was already loaded onto a dolly.
“Cas!” Dean cried as he fell to his knees next to him. “Why?” He felt tears falling from his face as he added his own hand on top of Cas’ to help stop the bleeding. “I’m not worth it! I’m not worth it!”
“I’m fine.” Dean replied back, scrubbing at his pants. He continued to scrub and blot, replacing the napkins as they disintegrated, for a few more minutes until another knock echoed into the tiny bathroom.
The library was larger than Dean’s entire apartment, filled from ceiling to floor with bookcases. The windows were large and bookended by thick and heavy curtains, the color of blood. A fire roared in a large brick fireplace. There was a desk, several leather chairs and two couches. Sitting on the couch, with her legs pulled up beside her, was a young red-haired woman.
Castiel rubbed his hand along Dean’s ankle again, and then lifted Dean’s legs so he could get out from under them. Dean started to get worried, what with Castiel’s silence and the sudden change in position, but when Castiel looked back down at him, Dean noticed that the doctor looked more nervous than anything else.
Castiel only shrugged again, but then, noticing the discomfort in Dean’s voice, reached over and placed his hand in Dean’s. “I’m sorry if this makes you uncomfortable. I promise, though. I’m on your side. Whatever happens this weekend, it won’t change us.”
Dean’s eyes travelled up through the windshield to take in all of the massive colonial’s glory. Boasting large pillars and a front porch the size of Sam’s backyard, Castiel’s family home was impressive. The doctor just shrugged.
“You’re more than that,” Castiel told him and pulled him even tighter against his body. “Your life matters, Dean.”
It was hard and crushing, but it was a kiss that would fuel every fantasy Castiel would dream up from that day on.
His heart was a steady beat of terror and pleasure as he brought his fist up quickly to Cas’ jaw. Cas took the blow full on, even though he could have defended himself easily from the assault. He whipped his head back up, staggering slightly backwards.
“Absolutely.” Castiel pulled Dean into a tight hug, kissing up his cheek, down his neck, and across his shoulder. “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life.”
“I’m sorry to have woken you Dean.” Cas’ raspy voice came from the doorway as he entered Dean’s bedroom. “There is something though, that i feel we need to discuss.”
“I don’t know any of those people,” she replied. “At least, not anymore.” She looked down at her lap where the stuffed elephant lied.
Blue balls aside, Dean had to admit it felt nice taking things pretty slow with Castiel. Typically his hook-ups with guys were usually quick and messy and he was out the door before the guy could clean himself up. It wasn't that Dean didn't enjoy the sex, or that he didn't make sure his partner enjoyed it too, it was more that he didn't see a reason to hang around. Having sex with a man was one thing, but having feelings for him was a completely different thing. With Cas, Dean had developed feelings for him long before they got physical and he really didn't want to screw anything up.
Castiel seemed to understand this, because the next time Dean opened his eyes, the water was draining and Castiel was leaning over the tub, lightly kissing Dean’s cheek and whispering,
“All I need is that knife in your chest Crowley.” Dean spat back, struggling again for a moment against the hands of his captures before going still again. He searched the warehouse and found Sam untying Charlie in the corner of the room. Relief washed over him seeing his friend unharmed but tensed as he watched Sam fight off another demon.
His mother would reach for his hand and tell him to follow his heart. He couldn’t be sure of this, but it seemed like a very Mary Winchester thing to say. She would want him to be happy. She would want him to
“I’m not okay,” She said, her voice strained. “My arm is so fucked up they aren’t even sure if I’ll get to keep it. I’ve got a tube up my pee hole that burns like a bitch. There’s a bucket under my bed that I’m supposed to shit in with some asshole staring at me while I do it. My back is killing me and it feels like someone poured icy hot in my gut. And you, what? Expect me to thank you? Oh, thank you, Mr. Firefighter man. Thank you for saving my life so I could live on to experience this hell on earth.”
“Does that answer your question?” Castiel whispered against his lips. Dean just nodded and leaned back in.
Castiel pulls away, leaning against the counter next to Dean instead. “I’m sorry, am I making you uncomfortable?”
The alpha is on him in less than a second, yanking Dean into the apartment and shoving him up against the door, immediately scenting him.
Charlie and Jo exchange a look and Kevin rolls his eyes. None of those are exactly out of the ordinary, but it’s kind of a weird time for it. Dean shrugs it off and grabs his notebook, glancing around the table. “Alright, we ready to continue?”
Dean can’t shake what they’ve said for the rest of the week. Every time he sees Cas now, the little voice in the back of his mind gets louder. It’s been there for a couple of months now, whispering
Instead of digging himself into an anxious hole trying to find a contractor, he decides to go over the information packet from Rowena again. He tugs at the knot of his tie, loosening it and unbuttoning the top button of his shirt as he spreads the papers out across his desk. He reads through the draft contract first. There’s nothing spectacular in there, though he does note that both he and Luke would be paid for their appearances, along with their crews. The rest of the packet is ridiculously thick, but it lays out the areas they’re considering filming in, so he digs his laptop out from the mess of papers on his desk and starts to look at some of the houses for sale in the area. He wants to see what renovated houses are selling for, in addition to any houses that seem good for a flip. He finds about twenty houses that could be good candidates, so he jots their addresses down to revisit once he has a contractor and knows what area they’ll be working in.
Dean whines softly, clutching at the alpha and pulling him closer. “Cas, please, wanna stay, want you so bad,” he whines, relief flooding through his body as Castiel leans down to kiss him.
It was the most comfortable Dean had been in a damn long time. Castiel was in a great mood after spending the night learning Halloween traditions and passing out candy. They rarely got to do anything fun like this. Sure, they had movie nights at the Bunker, but they were alone here. Dean was tentatively hopeful there would be some making out, and maybe even a little bit more, as the movie played forgotten in the background. For now, though, he was content to wrap an arm around Cas’s shoulders and press a kiss to his temple, a heavy, happy sigh escaping his lips.
He’s gorgeous, anyone with eyes could see that. Dean knows him, of course, almost everyone on the planet does. He’s one of the most eligible bachelors in the country, one every omega is clawing for. He’s been a client for a few years now, though he’s been with Meg that entire time. Nothing ever came of it, though half of the company expected Meg to come back mated one day. Dean knew that wouldn’t happen—Meg is far too professional for that, and she adores this job. No-strings-attached sex with some of the richest and hottest alphas in the world, no way she’d throw that away for a single one. Dean always understood why but standing in the room with Novak’s enticing scent wrapped around him, he suddenly doesn’t get it. For all intents and purposes, Novak is perfect. He’s rich as hell, more than enough to take care of whatever omega he decides to mate. Dean’s seen pictures of the guy at a bunch of charity events, and the media makes a point of telling the entire world that Novak spends a ridiculous amount of his personal income on charity. His scent is incredible, and his
Dean flips through the file absentmindedly, skimming through the background check and application before flipping to the picture. She’s pretty, he won’t deny that. He samples her scent and immediately wrinkles his nose, sliding out of the booth and rushing for the bathroom. He empties the contents of his stomach into the toilet—which, admittedly, isn’t much—and gives himself a moment to breathe. He’s never reacted to an alpha’s scent like that before. Sure, there have been scents that have been unappealing, but actually vomiting because of them? No way.
Dean snorts. “I bet. Have a good day, Cas.” He passes his change across the counter, smiling as Castiel waves over his shoulder as he leaves.
Charlie’s office door is closed when he gets there, which is… odd. He’s worked here for six years and he’s never actually seen her office door closed. Frowning, he waves at her secretary, a young beta named Krissy. “Charlie busy?”
“It doesn’t have to be such a big deal, y’know. If he says no, he says no, and if he says yes, awesome. Just… don’t get your hopes up, you may be wrong about him liking me.”
The line is silent for longer than Cas is comfortable with. “You… you do realize I am the head of the HR department, right? Me helping you would technically be the company helping you.”
Dean swallows past the lump in his throat, giving himself a moment to decide even though that decision is basically made. He’s not going anywhere. He’s on birth control in addition to the suppressants, so he doesn’t need to worry about Cas getting him pregnant. It’s his first heat in a decade, it’d be nice to have an alpha to get him through it.
Luke sits back in his chair and sighs, tossing his napkin on the table. “Why do you want this so badly? I thought you were content designing houses for the company. When you were with April, you seemed to—”
“Goodnight, Dean,” Castiel murmurs, wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Dean whimpers, fisting the sheets as he grinds back onto Castiel’s cock. The alpha’s knot is already starting to swell, tugging at Dean’s rim every time he thrusts. It’s overwhelming in the best way and Dean can feel another orgasm starting to build already. After only a few more thrusts, Cas forces his knot into Dean one last time and comes with a howl, narrowly avoiding biting Dean’s neck as his fangs descend, instead ripping into a nearby pillow. Dean comes hard, milking Castiel’s knot. The alpha moans, turning to scent Dean’s neck gently.
“Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if you had a mix of sigils on a place some of which were drawn correctly and others that were slightly botched so only someone with the knowledge of them would recognise that they’re wrong?”
After Castiel wrings an orgasm from him, he slides into Dean in one long, fluid motion, grunting as he bottoms out. His grip on Dean’s hips is tight, almost bruising, but Dean likes his alphas a little rough anyway.
“I’ve been on suppressants and birth control for years, there’s no need. I’m tested every two months and I’ve been clear since I started the job.”
Dean snuggles against his side, shaking his head. “Nah, birth control isn’t affected by pining sickness, thankfully. And I’m on the shot, so I don’t have to worry about missing pills or not taking them at the exact same time every night or whatever.” He winces, slipping an arm around Castiel’s middle. “Sorry, you probably don’t want to hear about all that.”
Dean laces their fingers, chuckling as he lets Cas lead the way. “Yeah, I can smell it.” He’s about to ask where the food’s from when he sees their dining room table completely decked out with a fancy tablecloth, flickering candles, and two plates of what Dean can only describe as his dream dinner—a steak that looks absolutely perfect, a generous serving of mashed potatoes, and sauteed vegetables that don’t look even slightly burnt. “You… did all this?” he asks, trying to keep the astonishment from his voice. He doesn’t really think it works if Cas’s shy smile is anything to go by.
“Ah, I love this game,” Cas says with a grin, shuffling through the cards he’s dealt. “I always play this with my brother and a few of our friends.”
. I just get paid to let alphas use me during their ruts, no way is he...” He can’t bring himself to say the words
He leaves Castiel’s whiskey on the counter, too self-conscious about the price to actually open it. He’s loading up on snacks to bring while the others settle into the living room when Jo corners him, reeking of protectiveness. “So that’s Castiel, huh? The one Sam says you’ve been gushing about?”
Castiel’s answering grin is blindingly bright and it’s the cutest thing Dean’s ever seen in the world. He could die happy right now knowing that he caused that smile. “I’d love to.”
Castiel snorts, leaning back against the arm of the couch and propping his legs up on Dean’s lap. “Perhaps not. Tragic backstory, huh?”
Dean frowns, nodding. He didn’t want to accept Lisa’s offer anyway, but he dreads going to see Missouri. Charlie rolls her eyes.
“Alright, why don’t you two go get a damn room? We’ve got a campaign to play,” Benny snarks with a roll of his eyes.
“Like I said earlier, the whole thing is a bit too close to reality for me. Buying so much candy that there’re buckets of it left over after the trick or treaters have finished? That, I can get behind. So, don’t forget the stop at Hy-Vee for candy in the planning, alright?”
“By my estimation, you have precisely 10 minutes and twenty-five seconds in which to shower and change. It will take us another half hour to drive to the store. We can be there when it opens at 10.30.”
They’re snapped out of the moment by another knock on the door. Dean turns to see Sam and Rowena giggling in the kitchen. They’re clearly not going to be of any help, so Dean smiles and takes the bottle from Castiel, tugging the door open once again. Charlie, Benny, Kevin, and Jo file inside, like they’d all arrived in the same car or something. Dean knows they didn’t. He doesn’t even need to ask, he
. Thank gods Castiel is going back to Meg after this rut, no way he could be around this alpha without falling for him hard.
over and over in the back of Dean’s mind. It’s annoying and it only makes Dean more upset than he already is.
. What an absolute nightmare. Cas is gonna be exposed to his friends’ filthiest humor and he’ll never speak to Dean again.
Dean nods, smiling softly. “You’ve been talking about how much you want to go, and with me hiring more people to help me at the bakery, I’ll actually be able to take a vacation, so I figured why not?”
… Dean can’t wait to get his hands on it. He can’t imagine how he got this lucky, but he ain’t gonna look a gift horse in the mouth.
“Whoa, Castiel, relax. I told you nothing in your file was a problem for me, knotting was in your file. Don’t worry about it.”
He’s been around Charlie long enough to know that the look she’s giving him means he’s just said something monumentally stupid. “Dude, are you kidding me? On the days you’re not here, it’s like he’s moping around. I hate to break it to you, but he comes here for you, not for your muffins.”
Dean pushes himself from his seat when Charlie crooks a finger at him, following her into her office as Castiel makes himself comfortable in the same seat Dean had vacated. She closes the door behind them, gesturing for Dean to take a seat. “Pining sickness, right?”
“Well, it’s definitely the scariest house we’ve seen all night, so good job on that,” the kid said breathlessly, nodding toward the woman. “What do you think? They for sure went all-out, they even dressed up.”
They don’t pack up until around midnight. Charlie’s passed out on the couch, Jo and Benny are basically holding each other up, and Sam and Rowena are putting the last of the snacks away. Dean heaves himself off the floor to say goodnight to his friends, closing the door behind them. It leaves just him and Cas there, alone, and Dean barely has the energy to smile at Cas, much less do anything else with him, no matter how much he wants to. The alpha smiles at him, wringing his hands. That’s… weird. He’s never seen Cas do that before. Is he… nervous?
They spend the duration of Castiel’s rut making good on his promise. By the time Dean leaves, he’s pretty sure they’ve fucked on every surface of the apartment except for the spare bedroom, including the floor-to-ceiling window that spans the length of Castiel’s living room. Castiel had pressed him up against it and fucked him from behind, purring about how anyone below them would be able to see Dean like this, being bred by his alpha. It was the hardest Dean came in a long time and he’s eager to repeat it during Castiel’s next rut if he can entice the alpha to do so.
“Fuck, little omega, you smell incredible,” Castiel scents his neck, purring against his scent gland. “Smells like home, Dean,” he breathes, digging his fingernails into Dean’s hips as he begins to fuck him in earnest. Dean shivers, baring his neck for his alpha—no, no,
“Whatever the most anti-Halloween character is — you are it, Dean. I’ll get you your answer, but Cas’s way sounds way better. Go help him choose some FUN stuff.”
“You look… wow,” Dean finally gets out, letting his eyes skate the length of the alpha’s body once more before he meets the smirk on his face.
do something about it. What could it hurt, right? Worst case scenario, Cas says no and Dean reigns in his emotions to keep it professional. So, when Charlie comes back from her break, Dean clears his throat and slips his hands in his pockets. “So what if, theoretically, I was actually considering asking Cas out? Would it be weird to do it at the movie?”
