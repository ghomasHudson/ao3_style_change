"On that point, I have a gift for you."  Holmes took a book from his dresser and handed it to me.  "I acquired it from the library of the house Lestrade and I raided tonight.  After all, the owner can hardly complain that it has gone missing."
It was beautiful to watch.  He started to cough, strangled it back, and then began choking instead.  He did manage to cover his mouth with his napkin before the drink sprayed out noisily, while I thumped helpfully between his shoulderblades.  We were soon surrounded by no less than three waiters and the maitre d', all solicitously offering glasses of water, apologies, and other assistance, while seeking reassurance that the great detective was not going to expire on their premises.
"It is not something that I would do lightly, or without fair warning.  You need not fear that any small mistake would attract such a penalty.  But if you will not play by the rules I set, then that will be the final result."
"Hold still."  Not the most encouraging words.  And I moved anyway, in reflex, as something very hot and damp fell across me.  It seemed to be a piece of towelling, soaked in hot water and wrung out, such as a barber might use.
I was suddenly alarmed to think what else he may have perceived already about what I found arousing, and silently cursed his abilities when he laughed.  "Put your hands on top of your head," he ordered.  A small change in posture, surely, but it made me feel ridiculously vulnerable.  His hands stroked across my abdomen, and I flinched.
"Not now, " he whispered close into my ear.  "Not now, but soon."  And with that he pulled back, and I stifled a most unmanly whimper of disappointment.  "Now!"  he cried, voice louder and more cheery.  "Now, Watson, I believe you deserve a little solicitude on my part, so if you will allow me to escort you to your own room, I should like to make sure that you are comfortable for the night.  Unless you would prefer to stop for supper first?  As I recall we skipped that part of the evening.  My apologies, but I was quite distracted by the sight of you kneeling on the floor."
"I see no point in lying to you, nor will I be anything other than direct.  I find you attractive, and wish you to consider an intimate relationship."  I paused at this point.  My language sounded so cold, but I could hardly go down on one knee and offer him flowers.
Lestrade laughed cheerfully, not in the least offended, and wished us a good night.  We stood and I saw him to the door, waiting while he settled his hat and coat.  One last exchange of courtesies, and he was gone.
good, John."  One hand caressed me along the line of my jaw.  "I always knew you were a quick learner.  Now we shall have a proper test of your ability.  Please me."
I felt only mild surprise when I recognised the man emerging from the carriage that had just arrived at our door.  I certainly had no idea of exactly what the very personal consequences to me were going to be.  Not that I minded, truly, aside from the fact that it is always more fun to win a bet than to lose one.
!  Now remove your tie, and your collar.  You can pass them to me if you like, I will put them out of the way."
I could see only the boards in front of my nose, but I heard the slightest swish of cloth as Holmes moved to where I knelt, his own bare feet silent on the floor.  He said nothing.  I trembled a little and hoped desperately that I had done the right thing.  Then I felt the sole of his foot, placed gently on the back of my neck, and knew that he had accepted my surrender.
"You liked that?"  But I had already seen the twitch I had not seen earlier.   "Go over there, and put your hands on the seat of the chair.  Keep your legs straight."
He glanced at the clock, and pushed his chair away from the table.  "Your fifteen minutes is up.  Are you coming with me to the telegraph office?"
"And you are getting soppy in your old age."  I grumbled, but turned my head to catch his eye and let him see my smile.
This I had done before, if only once.  Surely this time I could do it better.  I had never thought of removing my clothes with an audience, but with Holmes openly watching I tried to move steadily, without hurry or hesitation.  I folded each item as I went, placing them in a neat stack out of the way.  I was ready this time for the idea of being completely naked, and managed to continue my rhythm as I pulled off the last of my underclothes and put them with the rest.
"Not much later, I hope." he replied, releasing me with some reluctance.  "Also, we just turned into Baker Street."  He swiftly did up my buttons for me, and we checked each other's appearance for seemliness as the cab halted outside our door.
He was all solicitation afterwards, helping me to my feet and collecting my crumpled towel from the floor.  "You haven't got too cold, have you?  I would hate for you to fall ill on my account."  I almost laughed at the contrast to his usual cavalier dismissal of my needs, except that the difference was a pleasant one, at least in small doses.  I had no real wish for him to change.
I did not continue for too long, simply for the reason that the more I did, the greater my chances of making a major mistake.  Besides, given his history Holmes would be more used to minimum foreplay rather than anything elaborate.
Starting at my shoulders, he spread his hands wide and ran them slowly down my back.  I would have thought they would feel cool on my skin, flushed from the bath, but they were warm and where they passed it felt like fire.  There was no hesitation when he reached my buttocks, fingers bending to fit the curves as his thumbs dipped in between, where I had never been touched before.  I shivered at the feel of it, and then he was past and moving down my legs.
John worried her lip and eyed the flat door before she spoke. “You understand this is far beyond the friend boundary?”
“Right, let’s keep going, we’re still on the clock.” Ms Hawkins called back to order, “On to the date night, please.”
John looked out the window, letting himself process the story. It seemed like Sherlock had almost gone insane because of an artifact. But didn’t he say it didn’t have any side effects? Could it have been caused by what had happened to his partner? She did say they had started chasing it as a team and then... then what?
Stamford gladly took the offered drink and drank it in one gulp. He took a deep breath and opened his eyes, seeing Watson looking at him with a worried frown. “Just tell me something good. How is the rewrite going?”
“What? But I’ve been hearing it since the pawn shop.” John added but Sherlock had stopped short, his eyes squinted as he loomed over John.
“Was he always this psychotic, Manning?” Sherlock asked him, irritated at being the only one in the room who wasn’t aware of what had happened to said previous team.
Sherlock stared at John and her new hair. She was stunning, obviously. She always was naturally beautiful, but the effect of the shiny even colour from root to tip gave her a more polished look. Sort of like the, what did John call them again? Bond girls? Sherlock still preferred the natural version, but given the circumstances, even she was surprised by the result.
He was trying, he really was trying to sound like this was not ok and that the situation is serious, but Sherlock kept looking at him with that damn smile that shouldn’t be as sexy as it was and terribly distracting and John really shouldn’t be struggling not to flirt while there’s a dead body
Jake gives Sherlock an angry glare. Sherlock rolls his eyes. Amy sits the teenager down on the chair next to her desk.
Most of the crew had already left when they came out of Holmes’s dressing room. They would continue filming in the same set the next day, so there hadn’t been much to wrap up. Lestrade was halfway through his round to close the set, which meant he was on the opposite side of the studio when Holmes and Watson saw Small come out of the infirmary.
“I don’t think you’re getting my point.” John whispered over Sherlock’s shoulder, her breath lightly brushing the shell of her ear.
“This is what we call a poser. He isn’t part of the lifestyle, he’s using it as a hunting ground to lure subs and kill them.”
“Fat nose has a bum left knee; the other has an undiagnosed heart condition.” Sherlock whispered to John quickly.
How was John managing to stay so calm and composed while looking at Sherlock as if he were his next meal?
Sherlock’s eyes slowly moved to stare down at the shorter man, making a point of emphasising their height difference. “Are you already forgetting that you encountered your deceased teammate? We can’t risk killing them if there is any possibility of someone bringing them back to life. What do you think is going to happen then? The only way to prevent whatever they were trying to do from happening again is to keep them in the Warehouse.”
Barnabas answered with a nervous chuckle. “This club is, uh, merely a hobby. I am, by vocation, shall we say, a procurer of rare and valuable artifacts.”
“Bloody hell.” John groaned and downed as much of his tea as he could. “Next time, make sure you win the stupid auction.” The soldier complained as he put his cup in the sink, grabbed his jacket and followed his partner out of the flat.
Sherlock, not having noticed John’s growing smile, continued his search. “Thank God it was never published.”
They turned to one another and looked away immediately. Watson stepped back and limped over to the pharmacy to get what he needed to clean and stitch up the wound.
Holmes paused before answering. “Well, I was planning on heading back to London but, well it seems this town has grown on me.”
“Obviously,” Ms Rosie replied as she pulled a little metal case from her pocket and took out a little square paper with a star on it, the size of the tip of her finger. “We need a lab rat.”
Even though he didn’t have the mace anymore, he was reverting to anger as a fuel to keep going, keep running even though his lungs were burning, keep moving even though he knew what he was most likely to find. He had no idea how he was supposed to help him once he got there. His chest tightened at the thought, making his breaths even shorter. He’ll figure it out, somehow. He’s still alive. They’re still alive, John told himself. He was gone less than five minutes, he should be ok.
Everyone held their breath; this was unchartered territory, having the two biggest stars on set face off.
“Wanker.” He certainly wasn’t going to admit he almost did the first time. “So how long am I supposed to hold this thing anyway?” He asked, waving the makeshift GPS at Sherlock.
John was staring at Sherlock. His concern was so clear, so present that John went into a bit of shock himself, quickly followed by his insides twisting. It was sort of a relief, knowing that as detached as Sherlock acted, he did care, even if it was in his own way. John could feel the warmth of his hands seeping through the fabric of his clothes, making him focus on something else then the pain in his chest from the blast. John was still so surprised by Sherlock’s distress that he wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s on his knee and squeezed lightly. They didn’t look at each other, simply stared at their joint hands a moment as they calmed down. Slowly, Sherlock twisted his hand in John’s grip and squeezed back.
“Yes,” Ms Adler replied. “Three more movies. Writing and directing. With Ms Hooper as your assistant, assuming you still want to work with her.”
“John? John! Can you hear me?” Sherlock asked, his hand grabbing his forearm and shaking it. It should work since the other part had already been neutralized. He hoped it wasn’t too late to reverse the effects.
“I know he can be a handful sometimes.” John raised an eyebrow at her choice of words. “Ok, most of the time. But you know what? The Warehouse isn’t the only thing that’s changed since you’re here. In all the years I’ve known Sherlock, I’ve never seen him like this.”
After a loud intake of breath, John moaned loudly, bucking into Sherlock’s hand, pushing the finger in as far as she indirectly could. “Yesss. Yes, yes, yes, oh my god, please, don’t stop, don’t you dare stop, Sherlock, fuck, yes.”
Please note that I have taken some liberties with the artifact’s powers in reference with the Warehouse 13 descriptions and will continue to do so throughout the series.
Watson sipped his drink, reread the notes, and let Holmes’s words mix with his memories of today’s audition. It had been wonderful to see his characters come to life, not just individually, but together. Their playfulness, their banter, their tempers, how it all merged together… Watson closed his eyes and saw the movie play out in his head. The characters looked like Holmes and Adler, but they were Jane and Edward, now that he knew not just who they were, but how they talked, moved, acted and reacted.
John looked at the title page with a mix of joy and sorrow. This author had brought him so much happiness as a young teenager, delving into the dark universe, experiencing danger and mystery with the main character. John had never wanted to become a detective himself, but he couldn’t deny that these stories had been where he had started to develop his taste for danger, for the thrill of the chase. Knowing that this book had driven the author to his death...
Paying the cab driver, Watson stepped out and looked up at his building. Fishing his keys out of his pocket, he sighed before letting himself in. He walked up the stairs to his small empty flat. He had been gone 8 months; the place must smell of dust. The entrance led directly into the living room where he had a small desk, a sitting chair and his bed. It was separated from the kitchen only by the floor that went from hard wood to ceramic and the independent ceiling lights. The bathroom was on the opposite on the entrance.
“You were hanging off a cliff.” Mycroft said a bit louder. Sherlock’s head popped back into the door frame.
The sight of the couple tangled together in a state of advanced arousal was such a shock for Molly that it took a moment for her to notice where Sherlock’s hands were. She had one arm wrapped around John’s waist to hold her in place, or up, if the strain in Sherlock’s shoulders was anything to go by. The other had slipped it’s way under John’s skirt, the fabric stretched around her arm, the dark blue contrasting with her pale skin, accentuating the slow and steady rhythm of her movements.
“Once you’re inside, we only have radio contact, I can’t hack into the camera feed or I get detected, I can only loop what’s appearing on the guards screen. Keep me posted on what’s happening. Rogers, you and Jones lead the way to the target. Watson and Neeson, you cover them. The target should be on sub level 2. The place is heavily guarded, so if you want any chance of getting out of there, you have to eliminate the target before someone calls for back up. This is an in and out job, it should go smoothly. We’ll have a chopper waiting for our signal to come in for a quick extraction. I’m taking care of the van. And remember, this mission is off the record. We were never here.” Talley finished.
“Not as much as I’d hoped. So either they’ve been taken out of the city, or these people knew what they were really buying.” Sherlock answered, resigned.
Her lips were over Sherlock’s clitoris and her chin was creating a pressure over Sherlock’s labia. She held her in place with one arm around her thigh as the other caressed her breast. It was incredible, yet Sherlock was starting to panic. She had never been this stimulated before, it was too much, too much. But John’s tongue never waivered, never paused, kept the rhythm and pressure steady. Sherlock opened her eyes and was awestruck by the sight of John eagerly eating her out, her skin flushed and a bit sweaty from the two orgasms she had given her. It had been so long since she had come with someone else in the room, much less someone touching her, much less John, that It was too much.
Sherlock stares at Amy a moment, then blinks rapidly. He opens his mouth to speak, then closes it. He takes a sip of his coffee, grabs his phone and stands.
Watson came in, his eyes widening a bit at the sight of a half-dressed Holmes. “Sorry, I can come back.”
John watched Sherlock’s mouth form a small o as his hands released his weapon. His arms slowly fell to his sides in an uneven arc as he stumbled back into a stack of wooden crates, sliding down and leaving a streak of blood across the pale wood.
“Mm. I know the riding crop got really popular with all the 50 Shades stuff, but I wouldn’t recommend that for beginners. If I may?” The clerk pulled the crop from Sherlock’s hands gently. He put it back in its place and reached for a black leather paddle. “Instead, I’d suggest something like this. It’s made to be similar to a hand.” He placed his hand on the oval part of the paddle, confirming it had practically the same shape and size.
“No. You’re not putting me aside. I’m going to find Manning and stop him if it’s the last thing I do.”
Watson looked up and realised the opening he had accidentally created. He tried to hide his trepidation at finally being alone with Holmes. “Not at all.”
Sherlock had no idea how long the repeated strikes lasted, but it felt like too much and not enough. All of a sudden John let go of Sherlock’s hair, and the room rang loudly with silence. Sherlock let his head hang between his shoulders. The back rub resumed, but Sherlock barely felt it against the his burning arse.
“Yesterday, at his office. I tried calling him and went there this afternoon but he was gone and I don’t know where else to look.”
“Throw me your earpiece. Now! Trust me.” Watson demanded his voice steady. Neeson looked at him gravely, knowing that he had always had a good reason to trust the man but this was odd, even for Watson.
John could tell Sherlock was trying to take back control of the conversation and decided it wasn’t going to happen. “Well for starters, if you don’t care about my life-”
“It would seem suspicious. And I have plans with Ms Adler.” Holmes plastered on his Sigerson smile. “Now if you’ll excuse me.” He said with his American accent.
“Was he ever going to talk to Jane? Tell her about it? Let her choose for herself?” Holmes stood behind Ms Adler, arms crossed like her.
At every step she took, the sound of the sole pressing off the concrete, the friction from the shift in weight from one foot to the other and the slide as the foot lifted once more, was amplified for Holmes. He had never heard it in such detail, the sound so clear he didn’t even need the image.
A little too seriously? Sergeant Jeffords I am disappointed by your attitude. You once claimed to love love. Where is that love now? Do you not want them to be happy? You don’t think they deserve their  chance at love? The same love you share with your family?
“Of course I’ve thought about it, unlike you, I can’t just turn it off. My brain is like an engine that never stops; all of the information around me, facts, evidence. it’s all constantly being analysed and classified.”
Even though John’s voice had been steady, Sherlock neither missed his pupils dilate, nor the slight hitch in his breathing. He frowned, surprised by his body’s reaction to John’s obvious attraction. Sherlock was even more disconcerted when he felt himself swaying forward when John nervously licked his lips, struggling with the urge to pursue his tongue with his own.
As Sherlock held his stare, secretly intrigued by his new partner, he noted the electrical surges that started to appear in the shelves they we’re passing.
“About time.” He attempted to take control of the fight to move them back towards the hose, but the armour wasn’t letting him. It was the disadvantage of fighting an artifact; they never tire. Even though Sherlock’s sabre was giving him increased power; it was also feeding off his energy, slowly draining him.
“If you bothered to read fiction once in a while between one of your textbooks you’d know I’m just playing the part. And I thought you’d appreciate my efficiency.” John concluded with a smirk.
Stamford puffed out his chest. “How dare you break into my set? Who do you think you are? Explain yourself!”
Watson was torn between screaming at him for his recklessness or bursting out laughing. He had to admit the plan was good, even if it was risky. “You’re a madman.”
Sherlock pulled out his mobile and quickly stood so John wouldn’t notice his hands were shaking. He still couldn’t believe John was collaborating.
“I want you to lead with your left wrist and forehead.” John continued, deadpan. “Say it like you’re a hungry horse and she’s a bale of hay.”
“The novelty has worn off for me, but I used to love watching them.” Watson looked around the room, smiling to himself.
John pursed his lips to hide his amused smirk. He didn’t want to encourage the bastard. “You’re a dick, you know that?”
“Hello, sir. We’re looking for Mrs. Adams.” Sherlock told the man with a friendly smile. John’s eyebrow lifted at the smile, even though he couldn’t hear what he was saying.
Watson gathered the empty plates. “So no plans for a second date?” And headed to the sink to start the washing up.
“Good. Well, have a good night then, Sherlock.” John said awkwardly before turning and walking up the stairs.
To Sherlock’s relief, they rode in silence the rest of the way to Plymouth. It wasn’t that he didn’t care about the man who had tried to blow them up, but Sherlock knew that Manning was only the messenger. John was right, the agent did have his suspicions, but until he had more information, he preferred not to consider things too closely. He didn’t like where the facts where leading him at the moment. He didn’t like Mycroft putting his nose into cases, but this one... Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed slowly through his nose. The violin, he told himself; no time to think about something that wasn’t his problem at the moment, he had a case to focus on.
Holmes shook his head, but he had a look in his eye, as if he was thinking about something else. By the way he licked his lips, Watson guessed what it could be.
“Yes, I can and I do.” Sherlock had had enough of the recruits constant nagging. “There is absolutely no way to touch it, even with an object. Unless there happens to be a bomb in that tool box, there is nothing life threatening here. Stay if you want, but I’m going back to the Warehouse.” He concluded, his tone final as he stared down at his partner.
Molly had a brief moment of panic as Sherlock started moving, but then she uncurled herself to stretch over John, kissing her way up her belly, between her breasts, her lips catching on the tip of Molly’s fingers, but continued up John’s neck. As Sherlock’s lips found John’s, they were so close to Molly’s that she could have just turned her head and joined the kiss. It was over before she found the courage to do so, and noticed instead that Sherlock had pulled out her phone.
Why was that endearing? Sherlock wondered as he took a step closer to John. It shouldn’t be endearing, it’s normal for a doctor to worry about his patients. “We don’t need to go to the hospital because we have everything we need here.”
John cut him off again, knowing this was most likely another rehearsed bit. “I get why you didn’t want to speculate about Manning, but why not talk to me about the GPS? Is it because it involves... Irene Adler?”
“I was not.” Sherlock protested quickly, proving John’s point as he started fibbing. ”She bid at the last second, fair strategy in online auctions.”
“Last night they kidnapped Holmes, and when Watson found Holmes, he was with James Moriarty aka Jimmy Morgan, and…” Jones looked down at his notes. “Ms Mary Rosie, which might be a fake name-”
“Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that we have in our company tonight the cast and crew from Stamford Production’s upcoming movie: The Dancing Bachelor.” He paused for applause. “I’d like to invite Mr Stamford to come and say a few words.”
Holmes rolled his eyes. “Well that doesn’t come across at all. It looks like he’s doing it for love.”
“I’m happy you decided to come and speak with me Captain Watson. I wouldn’t want you to think of your suspension as a punishment. Your presence here isn’t a reaction to what happened in Qatar.” The man said as he served them tea.
They pushed Lennox away, making him sprawl on the floor as they each turned towards their opponents, their backs brushing one another as they prepared for the onslaught.
. But Sherlock never lost her train of thought and swept out of the lab as soon as she had the results she needed for their ongoing case.
“Right, yes, thank you Ms Hooper.” Watson cleared his throat and straightened his shoulders. “Good morning everyone.” He found himself falling back into his old army ways, the captain talking to his troops. “I want you all to know that I will not suddenly become an egomaniac because I’m the director. Things will be different, hopefully for the better. But I will need you all to be patient with me. After all, it is my first time as a director. But I’m still going to do my best, just as you. Which means I am open to ideas. If there’s something you’d like to try, talk to me about it.” Stamford’s eyes went wide a bit. “I know time and money is always an issue,” Watson reassured. “But we’re all here to make a good movie. So if we have the time and the resources, I don’t see why we can’t try it out, right?”
Wiggins just stared at him, hands on his hips he caught his breath. “Where the hell did you come from?”
Stamford wiped his forehead with his handkerchief. “I wanted you to be the first to know there will be some big changes at Stamford Productions.”
Sherlock cried out, his body going rigid in John’s embrace. Teeth dug deep into his muscle, just on the edge of tearing the skin. Surgical precision that sent delicious shivers through his body. John’s teeth disappeared, replaced by suction, making the pain even more vivid. Sherlock hissed and writhed in John’s arms, his cock was so hard he could burst.
“I’ve had to come here so many times with Stamford and I still feel out of place,” she murmured to Watson.
To which John burst out laughing again, his arms holding his waist, head thrown back. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at the sight. He wasn’t sure what was so funny, but it didn’t stop a pleased sensation from blooming inside of him like their evening at Angelo’s, knowing he was the cause of this brief joyful moment.
An official Jeep was waiting for him outside of headquarters to take him to the airport and back home. The whole time he replayed the events in his head. It infuriated him. And who was that man? He still couldn’t get over the fact that he had escaped.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, straightened and crossed his arms and waited as John knocked heavily on the door.
Thankfully, Sherlock managed to get himself together during his cab ride to Bart’s, to get the promised bag of body parts from Molly.
She leaned forward in her chair and held his gaze. “Because I want you to understand that even though he’s hard to work with, I haven’t seen Sherlock this happy in years. Now stop second guessing yourself and do what you do best. I know you two will get that artifact.” She stood and smoothed her skirt. “But just in case, I’m going to call my sister tomorrow. I’ll leave you to your book. Sleep well, dear.” She said, squeezing his hand lightly before heading out.
“Of course we have an OR. Can you imagine explaining to the hospital staff that I need surgery after you undo your wish? We’d get thrown in the psych ward.”
This video had 0$ budget, 3 months of pre-production, 3 hours of rehearsal on site and 3 hours of filming (and very little sleep).
“It most likely is, but we still need to investigate.” At his older brother’s words, Sherlock turned slowly to him with a deadly stare.
The sight of his partner conscious was a relief as much as it was a concern. “Don’t move. You’ll be fine.” He was saying it as much for Sherlock as for himself as he felt the blood on the floor slowly being soaked up by his trousers. John took out his phone to call an ambulance, but he couldn’t get a signal. That darn blocker. He tried with his Farnsworth, but the only other person he could call was Mycroft. Putting aside his misplaced anger towards the Caretaker, John rang him.
He looked up again and his attention was caught by the Warehouse GPS screen that was seemingly trying to locate the GPS artifact.
“Captain Watson, what are you doing?” He heard Talley ask in his commanding voice. The soldier ran to catch up, turning to the right at the corner and almost missing the closing door on his left. “Captain Watson, get back to the mission, that’s an order.” Watson lunged for it and managed to get through, barely taking notice of the “Restricted Area. Authorized Personnel only.” sign.
Amy’s closes her mouth. Sherlock takes a deep breath and settles in his seat. The silence lasts about three seconds.
Stamford stood, nodded to Ms Hooper and signalled Wiggins to come closer. All three spoke together in a hushed tone before making their way onto the sound stage.
It was about noon when he had gotten the call. His platoon, including Major Sholto, had gotten ambushed the day before. There were no survivors. Everyone Watson had been with before getting discharged, they were all gone. All at once.
“And you still need to come up with your pseudonym.” Stamford added, ignoring Holmes. “Have you watched any Morgan films?”
Neeson opened the door and in went Watson and Rogers, clearing left and right. Then Jones moved passed them and checked the first right corner. He pulled back quickly, seeing a guard at the next checkpoint, exactly where they were heading. Jones signalled the others silently.
“The downside, John. Now look at me, just keep your eyes on me.” Sherlock said as he backed away from John towards the end of the aisle.
Sighing loudly, he sat in his chair to read a hardboiled crime novel by his favorite author, Anthony Bishop. He’d read it before, but it didn’t matter. It was either that or the whiskey bottle under the sink. He longed for the drink, but a hangover would just make it harder to deal with Sherlock, especially if they were about to try and catch an uncatchable artifact for the second time.
“Why did you run?” Watson asked, keeping his head angled away as Small struggled, attempting to punch him.
“Well, I’m still sceptical of the idea of someone abandoning everything for love, especially if it’s a new relationship, it’s so foolish. But,” Holmes shrugged, “I did find myself… pleased when they kissed at the end.”
Holmes looked at Stamford as if he were dimwitted. “It is not a ridiculous idea, it’s a theory based on facts.”
The agent knew there was no point in arguing any further or he would end up manhandled into the desk chair. So he rolled his eyes and sat, back straight as an arrow.
“A month ago, you were firing my gun at the wall. Then it was the fermentation farm in the cupboard that gave me food poisoning, not to mention that chemical burn I’m still nursing. And now I have red hair. At this rate, I might not survive another year of living with you.”
“Rather that than having to split them up at 20 000 feet.” Neeson told Rogers who snorted a laugh. Neeson had always been amazed at how the team worked together. In the field they worked fine, had for years. But anywhere else and it was like any other dysfunctional family. He looked at Watson, silently asking if he was ok. Watson smiled and waved him to move along, not to worry about him. One after the other they jumped.
There was just so much crap crammed in there. It was like a bad game of spot the differences. He waited until the owner was busy talking to customers to get a better look.
“Fine, fine.” Watson pushed past Holmes. “If it means you will finally shut up about it and film the scene.”
Watson smile and licked his lips. “The point is, thanks to you, The Dancing Bachelor might actually be good now.”
Slowly, the pain started to overtake him. Every input was tuned down, drowned out by the slow building burn on his arse. The pain was growing, yet Sherlock felt himself relax, letting everything wash away. Everything except John.
Immediately Ms Adler and Morgan turned, both their faces twisted in worry before they ran to Holmes.
Holmes was grateful for her warning, but still had to fight very hard not to let surprise replace the seductive look on his face. Either Small had spilled the beans about what had happened yesterday, or they were seen.
So why had Watson left? Holmes had spent the night trying to figure it out and he had come up empty handed. When he heard a knock on his door at seven thirty in the morning, he ran to open it, expecting Watson and an explanation.
“Fascinating life, really,” he said as if thinking aloud. Holmes smiled to himself and looked over to the musicians on the small stage. The singer reminded him of Watson a bit.
“I’ve seen civilians in the middle of live fire before. Some are brave, but you can see in their eyes that they’re scared. He wasn’t.”
“Sherlock, can you hear me?” He asked as his fingers slid across the pale throat, searching for a pulse.
If only Sherlock had the mental capacity to say just how he felt waking up in John’s arms after a spanking and a spectacular orgasm.
“Oh goodness it’s great, really,” Holmes replied immediately, then turned to Morgan, blushing a bit. “I’ve always loved his work, so getting to be a part of this project, along with Ms Adler, well, gosh, it’s like a dream come true. I still sometimes feel like I should pinch myself.”
“Does Mycroft often take cases of his own?” John insisted. Sherlock kept his eyes closed but lifted an eyebrow.
Watson smiled to Holmes. “Yep, that works. Keep the jump. Now start from the top and improvise the song, do what feels in character, have fun with it. After we’ll see what we keep and where we integrate dancing.”
Slowly, John relaxed against him, his body sinking deeper against Sherlock’s. Their bodies fit perfectly together. It was bliss.
Ms Adler shook her head. “No, the band won’t know those songs and it will be too complicated if to send Dimmock and the band up there with you. A known song. One that means something to you.”
John woke up the next morning by turning onto his back and hitting his head on the soon to be empty whiskey bottle lying next to him. He was still dressed in yesterday’s clothes, lying on top of his sheets.
“How could you possibly know about that?” He asked, his voice on the edge of threatening. The man smiled benevolently.
“Fuck!” John exclaimed as he stood up, wanting to run after him, but when he took one look at Sherlock he knew something was terribly wrong. “Sherlock, what was that thing he put on you? Are you ok?” Still holding the riding crop, he moved to Sherlock’s side.
“I’m the detective, not him.” Sherlock said this offhandedly, all the while surprised by his urge to get up and slam the door in the woman’s face.
Molly saw rather than heard Sherlock’s name slipped past John’s lips. She was overwhelmed by how strongly she needed to hear it. So much so that she didn’t notice she had pushed the door open until she was halfway through.
This collaboration was proving to be much more fruitful than anticipated, even if Sherlock was struggling with his attraction to John. The important thing was that they now had a lead.
There was a murmur amongst the crew as they begrudgingly handed money to a smiling Bill Murray, the lighting designer. But as soon as Stamford looked at them, the crew dispersed. Stamford looked at his pocket watch and sighed.  He waived to Morgan’s assistant, Ms Hawkins.
Ms Hawkins watched them from the corner of her eye as she took note of the situation on her clipboard. She was about to continue her round, when the studio door opened, and Anderson walked into the studio. Even from the other end of the studio Ms Hawkins thought he looked unusually sweaty, which was explained when Wiggins pushed through the door, looking like he was biting his tongue. He went directly for the coffee and pastries, while Anderson shut himself in his dressing room.
Even though he was exhausted from revising all night, Watson kept tossing and turning in his bed. He tried slowing his breathing, stretching, made tea. When he finally reached for the whiskey bottle, he decided to stop ignoring what was keeping him awake.
“And he just stopped chasing it? Like that? He doesn’t seem like the type to let things go so easily.”
“Are you the manager?” Sherlock asked the man behind the counter. He was shorter than John, late fifties, bit of a comb over going on.
He winked and with a little shimmy, lifted his chin, whipped his scarf around his neck and walked to the centre of the stage. The crew quieted once they saw Morgan.
John coughed and gave his partner a stern look before turning too Ms. Abbott. “What’s the name of your friend?”
“My name is Mycroft Holmes.” The man finally introduced himself as he turned to face Watson. Still stunned from what lay before him, it took him a moment to realise what was happening.
There it was. The same look of panic on John’s face as in the office when he figured out they had to finish the story and when he opened the portal.
“Probably not.” She answered with an unconvincing smile, her hand patting his forearm lightly before she took a knife off the shelf and started sharpening it. John stared at her a moment before asking the obvious.
“Six? Not if you count the days to prepare for my audition. No wait, if we started rehearsal on Saturday then…” Holmes seemed to be counting on his fingers. “Eight.” Holmes’s eyes widened as he turned to Stamford. “Wait, I learned the movie in eight days?”
“Nope,” John closed his eyes. “I can’t look at you right now.” He blew out a breath as he looked up at the ceiling instead.
“The fate of the world, huh? I’m getting shot at because of a nutter who fancies himself a magician. I’m definitely getting suspended when this is over.” Watson rubbed his face with his hand. Well, if he was already in trouble, might as well humour him, even if he was crazy. “And how do I know you’re not, as you say, the wrong hands? What are you going to do with it?” Watson asked, even though most of his attention was on the guards. He knew that they were very close now.
“John, you would have left earlier if this opportunity didn’t interest you.” Mycroft answered smugly.
Rebecca Carson growled in anger and took another shot, hitting the pillar behind Sherlock who had ducked, his body covering John’s. When he looked back, Rebecca had run away, lost in the fog. He kneeled and checked John’s pulse again; his own heart rate doubling when couldn’t find one.
Judging by the way the bathroom door opened and slammed shut again, followed by pounding steps through the corridor and up the stairs, Sherlock didn’t need to open her eyes to know John’s hair was still red.
Ms Hooper appeared by Stamford’s side during Morgan’s monologue, making him jump when she spoke. “Mr Stamford, sir?”
“Mrs. Carson’s going to kill Lilly Abbott in the shoot off as revenge before running off to hide in a generic tropical destination.”
“The Philadelphia experiment. An attempt to make US naval ships invisible to the enemy by using high power magnets. It kind of worked. The ship did disappear from the radar for 47 seconds.” John considered the answer. It didn’t really explain how the artefact was created, or why, but with what he had heard today, the explanation might not come in his lifetime. Might as well move on to the next question.
It took John a moment to realise his partner was staring. He was making sure the man was still breathing and got distracted by the different stages of bruising in gray tones. When he did notice, he dropped his hands to either side of him. “What?”
When he had finally managed to read it, he'd gone through the manuscript like he was in a dream. It was like reading something familiar, even though he didn't know what was about to happen. He finished reading and started crying.
Watson bit back his smile and licked his lips. “Could they just… act it out? And keep the dancing for the instrumental part?”
All at once, this whole venture seemed completely insane. What had he done? He’d never needed help before. He was perfectly capable of solving this case on his own. How had he convinced himself that including John was a good idea?
As he finished his sentence, they watched the ball roll onto a fallen book, making a ramp that took it up to the first shelf, bumping into a white porcelain tea set in a metal tray, shattering them and simultaneously making the shelf shake, causing several artifacts to move to the ledge and fall off one after the other, including a leather bound case. It had a metal flip lock that opened as it fell, revealing Walt Disney’s paintbrush that floated out. It bounced off the floor, flipped in the air a few times before the tip hit a shoe box. It slowly changed color, making it appear cartoonish. Suddenly, the box’s lid popped opened and out came large cartoon shoes that started walking around, eventually heading to a large displayed armor and kicking it.
“Or, maybe you prefer the couch? It will only take a few minutes. I just need to wash my hands first, you just sit wherever you feel more comfortable.”
Walking down the stairs, he could see Sherlock through the open door of the living room, standing in front of the window, looking out onto the world as he played. As John set foot inside, Sherlock turned and stopped.
“I’ll tell you what you can do with your suits.” Ms Riley mumbled as she made her way to the table, dropped her script, grabbed her purse and left, the studio door slamming loudly behind her.
The crop whistled through the air and landed in the center of his right cheek this time, the pain blooming into an intense burn.
Sherlock should stop expecting John to act like most people. Most people aren’t calm during a murder investigation, not as a suspect and especially not while tackling a serial killer. Then again, John chose to be a medic in a warzone. It should have been obvious from the start that he was not like most people.
Usually, when Sherlock was working on something, John had learned by now that it was better to just sit close by in case he needed anything; mostly a sounding board or throwing him a pen.
“I don’t know, because Ms Adler rejected you or some bullshit.” Moriarty said with a bored tone. “I don’t CARE what the press comes up with, as long as it looks like you killed yourself.”
“Yeah, and I already have ideas for the choreography,” Wiggins added and pointed to Holmes and Ms Adler. “You’ll want to change.”
Holmes opened the passenger door for Ms Adler, and as soon as she stepped out the fans started screaming. She was dressed in an emerald green dress, complete with a black fur boa to cover her shoulders. A perfect look for a star on the red carpet.
Holmes looked up with a mix of emotions in his eyes. His muscles and tendons flexing against Watson’s grip on his wrists as Holmes managed to raise his head off the floor, bringing it dangerously close to Watson’s face. He stopped, close enough to look down at Watson’s lips before staring up into his eyes.
The camera swings back to the bridge and two men can be seen, one throwing his dark jacket, shirt and tie hastily to the other as he vaults up onto the rails. The man holding his cloths, points to something in the water and the other nods, and breathes with obviously exaggerated distress in preparation for the cold water below.
"It isn't that simple, John. Yes he did read me…and I read him too. He was ready to make his departure. He lived for his game and he wanted it all to end. You were not there. You didn't see his eyes."
Movement both above and below him made him swear under his breath. Sherlock was about twenty stories above him, using the same shaft he'd chosen as a conduit for escape. Below, the elevator began to rise at an alarming speed. John scrambled for a safe perch and shouted a warning upwards.
His respiration is failing to deliver enough oxygen to his brain and his heart rate went from accelerated to terminal. A realization that he has no clear memory of calculating his last dosage stops his continued lurching forward. He surprisingly felt a jolt of adrenaline and feels more clear and rational then he had for several hours. He switches off his torch as he withdraws his phone from his pocket and begins typing.
“I didn’t mean to do that to you. Didn’t cross my mind that it would bother you. I do understand. I was sick for a long time.” John admitted.
John stood as she left the flat and watched from the window as her cab disappeared into the London night.  He followed a while later after a long hot shower and a large breakfast, taking the tube and enjoying the feel of average lives with boring little problems waxing and waning in his proximity. “What do normal people have in their normal daily lives?” John asked himself, echoing Sherlock’s words the night they became friends. John realized he no longer had any idea what normal was.
“He told me ‘Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.’ and he said the game is never over,” he said with a smirk.
Behind the glass, a man in his twenties with a patched eye and a scar down his cheek asked softly,"What's he doing?"
"I realize that my brother relied on you, but this is more to protect you than one might conclude. I don't wish it to be necessary for you to allow strangers into the building in search of tenants at this time. They may have another agenda besides seeking accommodations and I will need more time to find all of Sherlock's hidden compartments. Wouldn't want someone inadvertently injured from accidentally discovering something he felt needed to be kept undisclosed." Mycroft explains as if he is indulging her.
People seemed fooled by his self-hatred, misinterpreted by the wishers of wellness and the stiff upper lip proponents. They concluded, that his new and very pleasing frame, must indeed speak of his sexuality. He had always been well groomed, but in London, in the medical field, that could not ever be counted on as a sole indicator of lifestyle. Doctors had to be perfectly groomed. Who wanted a shaggy slob explaining grandmother's cancer treatment to them?
A few hours later, he found the need to call on his perpetual acquaintance. He shot, once. He murdered as coolly as if he had never heard the words, do no harm. He gave no thought to the consequences as he raised the pistol and did what needed to be done to save the life that mattered. He knew his own was probably ruined in that flash and scent of powder. But, one life needed existence among the three of them. His acquaintance could not have Sherlock.
“You are completely insane. You have lost your bloody mind,” John whispered, staring at her with his mouth hanging open.
“Nothing. Time it, keep him from hurting himself. Don’t restrain him. If it lasts more than five minutes then do call an ambulance, but I will be back in less than an hour.”  John said.
“No. But Magnussen did, before I knocked him out. He had it on auto dial, so I knew I had to get out quickly. I imagine he called it for himself, hoping they’d save him. I counted on you being too busy saving your friend, for you to chase me.”
Oh God. “Sherlock.  This could kill you! You could die!” John stated the obvious just as his own heart sputtered and threatened to stop all together.
Sherlock sits for a moment, waiting for John to understand that he is not at all amused. With a typically petulant sigh, that John has to work not to smile about, Sherlock finally stands over him. He leans in and sniffs. "You…uhem, the victim, is severely underweight, he may have overdosed, but he didn't. He is not in the condition of a junkie, he has showered, groomed himself, dressed carefully, formally even, and is smirking, yet the crap telly is off and he decided to kill himself despite how successful he is. The room has also been cleaned which indicates this was not a random moment of crisis, he planned this action. There is no accumulated mail; he was not behind or in financial crisis. Therefore his action is motivated by some other situation. He is in a chair, not his bed, which probably indicates he wanted his last vision to be of something that mattered to him. He would have been looking at… a chair facing him, and the violin propped beside it. He doesn't play the violin, because his fingertips are soft, so it mattered that he see it for another reason. It belonged to his flat-mate. He wears no jewelry of any kind, though his ring finger has a pale line indicating this is a recent occurrence. There are no pictures of his wife, nor does he have one on his person. That says she was not the instigator of his demise."
Molly felt like she was under water, her reactions were mumbled and not her own. She didn't protest against Sherlock's mouth consuming her. John is dead. Their John is dead. In the darkness, Molly felt safe and nothing else felt quite tangible to her. His lips were the only reality and everything else is distant. In her mind, even time has stopped. She met his hunger and wilted to sensation.
His therapist told him to write about his life. There was nothing worth writing about. He was getting behind on bills and had two weeks left before he would be evicted, homeless. That would be a popular post, money issues, health issues, mental issues. John couldn't wait to share his day to day events of dull useless wallowing in his life being effectively over. That would make him all better for certain. He was pretty certain his therapist had gotten her license at some internet paper mill abroad. That could explain her insistence on a blog as her preferred treatment plan.
John swallows and takes a deep breath. "Yeah. Well, been planning a lead dinner for a year now, and I'm a bit hungry."
Yes the clue is obvious but John took into account a bit of emotional clog in the mind palace. Please review?
On the steps of Appledore, on a perfect Christmas day, Sherlock changed the world for the better in cold blood. “Christ, Sherlock. Oh Christ…” was all John knew to say. He didn’t move to assist the still vibrating and spasming body as it sped through the process of death. All he could see were red lights dancing on Sherlock and tried to figure out how to keep his friend alive.
He finds Mycroft’s umbrella pointed at him and looks up to see pure death on his face.  John mouths the words ‘trust me’ to him and bends to Sherlock’s ear and dramatically cocks the gun.  He says in a low, dangerous voice, “Uhhhem. Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend, I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.”
She had long ago figured out that as much as she felt his recreational drug use would lead him to ruin at some point, that it brought out a more open side of him she wished she could find when he was completely sober. Sometimes, she caught glimpses of him, but until he'd had to depend on her, or again wanted something, Sherlock was usually too distant and oblique to acknowledge more than a perfunctory acquaintance between them.
John stopped and smiled at Sherlock. Sherlock stopped and turned. "Did I say something wrong? You don't want to shower?"
The possibility had certainly never stopped them from dashing into danger. One of them or both of them could die. It was understood. But, not on purpose. Not like that. Not Sherlock.
“He said to give you his love and to tell you that you are safe now. I thought they were going to shoot him any second and I think he thought that as well. He never said another word, but he cried all the way to hell, or whatever euphemism they use for that place. Never said another word.” John repeated, glad the room was dark and she couldn’t see his own eyes leaking freely.
*I will do anything you ask.  Please.  Don't take her from me too.  She is all I have of you.  Please.-SH*
*  Though if it coincides with the vanishing project, I shall keep your kind proposal in mind.  Tempting. M*
When it didn't work, he decided to destroy them both, like a scorned woman. Love is the most vicious motivator in the world. Could it be unrequited love that destroyed Jim?
"Sherlock. Wait. Please. Sherlock!" she screamed as he turned his back and walked out the door. It closed with a slam of finality.
They carefully skirted the important question and Sherlock was right about what had attracted John to her.
John nodded in terminal despair at how his indescribably beautiful Sherlock would be remembered. His eyes locked to Lestrade. "That's it. I have something I can do for him. I can.. Oh my god. I can prove that I love him, and keep it a secret too. I can clear his name. I can make him be seen for who he was. I can give him a place besides the star of the circus. I can put his star back in the sky, where it belongs. Oh my God, what have I been thinking? I have been letting them say all those things. Greg, you're a genius."
"You still intend to forgive me." Sherlock said with a secretive flash of his eyes and a curl at the corner of his lips.
"Did I not? This is my truth. I am nothing close to human now. I am trapped in this hateful transport and I will burn the world until I avenge what he did to me. To us. It led here, John. It all led us to this truth. You hated me so much, you left me. I was wrong. I know it. I wish I had said yes, but I didn't and I can't change that. I can't change what you did. You sentenced me to this punishment. My only reward will be when I can finally seek you again. Perhaps, by that point you…will have forgiven me."
The announcement triggers a barrage of scientific research that very quickly convinces everyone -- Monsieur Blondlot being the notable exception -- that N-rays do not exist. To this day, Blondlot remains a poster boy for double-checking your work
Mrs. Hudson hushes them all, cocking her ear upward. "Well, sounds like they are about finished. You all better push along before he makes one of his comments and upsets me. I'll ring you later."
" My temper has to be managed better.  My father...was like that.  I am terrified that...if I can't keep it together for you...then at some point...I will turn into him and...our little sweet Rosie will have every right to hate me for it.  I would rather be dead.  I seriously considered giving her up when Mary died....when I went too far...the day in the morgue.  I was there again the other day...it was right there.  But I got out in time and this next bit isn't just on me.  My fear of hurting you is in constant war with my fear of losing you...see?  There will be times I have to take a step back...get some air...leave the situation and regroup.  If we are going to try this...whatever this is...on.  I have to know that I can have that without you literally stirring up a nest of bees in my absence.  I have to know you will still be there when...I come back.  Because I will always come back.   I have tried to cut you out of my life.  Tried...and yet...everything I do...it is embarrassing a bit ...but it always leads me back here.  With you.  So I will stop being angry all the time...but for the love of God...will you stop trying to die every time you are out of my sight?"
Sherlock was near the site that he and John had once investigated the murder of a night watchman. His mind didn't note he was falling until he was face down. The cold rocks felt like buzzing unfriendly glass under his body. The stench of the muck from the river and the distant sounds of the city played vivid symphony to his blotching brain. He used the last of his will-power to type as he felt his own chest betray him with waves of pain. It was imprudent to inject an untested batch from a dodgy source.
Moriarty put his hands in his pockets and smirked. “I see it as helping people, people who have problems they need help solving. Sort of like you, Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.”
“Oh, that.” He started, his mind frustratingly not providing proper vocabulary to explain the evening’s events. “Well, no, we didn’t, uh, get a chance to, um,” He wanted to say ‘work things out’ but he knew the chances of that happening in a single conversation were bleak. “talk, because we had a visitor.”
“How do you do.” Holmes shook hands with both while Ms Adler eyed Lestrade heading back to his table near theirs.
Pushing down his excitement, Holmes lead the way, the dark blue ornamented carpet muffled the sound of their footsteps. As if on cue, the crowd on the dance floor parted and let them slide in among them. Once they were in the centre, they started dancing as if it had all been choreographed.
“Don’t worry about me, get him!” John retorted, not believing Sherlock was being a prick in the middle of a chase. And he shouldn’t be finding it funny. Nevertheless, his attitude was reminding him of Jones.
“If you consider spending the evening having dinner followed by sex a date, it’s essentially identical to the other night, save for the fact we didn’t do any breaking and entering tonight.”
“Let’s go.” Sherlock said as he opened the door and walked inside, not waiting to see if John was following. The door led them into a corridor. On their left was the washroom and what seemed to be a maintenance closet. The right opened into the same room as the picture they saw at the Warehouse. It was larger than what the picture suggested, but it was still very cramped. There was dust everywhere, and the desk was a mess of papers.
Mycroft’s voice helped John snap out of the hypnotising effect of the drone and turn to the innocent looking GPS sitting on a large wooden crate. “Alright, we got the message, you don’t like it here, you can go now.”
“You can’t die, not here, not like this. John. John!” He smashed his fist against his sternum and felt his own heart skip a beat as John woke, gasping for air.
“Well, yes, but...” John didn’t know where to start, didn’t know how to explain in a way for Sherlock to understand that giving John the lead and not voicing his opinions didn’t make them a team.
“Sometimes I do, but it… It takes a toll on you; the long hours, always dealing with criminals, murderers.”
They were a couple of hundred yards away from the main entrance and John finished buttoning his shirt and coat as they walked briskly away from the station. He saw Sherlock take a look behind them, smiling slyly as he flipped his coat collar up and tucked away the artifact.
John brushed a sweaty curl off Sherlock’s forehead before leaning in for a soft kiss. “Very very good. Stay here, I’ll clean us up.”
Holmes closed his eyes and focused on keeping his heart rate down so he could think through the LSD. “What about Ms Adler?”
Watson narrowed his eyes at her. They definitely weren’t talking about the script. Watson shook his head and chose his words carefully. “Well, Edward didn’t just hide his time in prison from Jane, he’s hiding it from everyone. It’s the entire reason he had to start fresh in a new town. He had to leave where he was because someone found out and he lost his job and couldn’t get a new one. So he lied not just to Jane, but to everyone.” Watson glanced at Holmes. “Because that’s what he’s learned he needed to do to survive.”
Even a blind person could tell you two are dancing around each other. You probably regretted not saying something when you thought he was dead, because I sure did. I should have run off with him. Eloped in the Caribbean. You got a second chance. Don’t waste it by playing it safe.
“Yes, precisely.” Stamford smiled to Wiggins before turning to the rest of the table. “I know I’m asking a lot, but we have to reshoot the entire movie, we can’t afford to lose any more filming days.”
There it was again, the trepidation, waiting to see if John would take the pictures. Would accept working with Sherlock.
Sherlock ignored his partner and continued his investigation of the surroundings as they neared the entrance of an alley. The only light source was the lamp post across the street, casting a long shadow in front of them as they walked along the brick walls on either side. From what they could tell in the fog, they were alone.
“I couldn’t save her in the real world, but I will in here. So back off.” Bishop kept punctuating his words by waving the gun around. It just made him seem comical rather than threatening and yet John couldn’t let go of his anger. With ease, he disarmed Bishop, pieces of the gun falling to the ground as he spoke. “Stop waving that around. You’re a writer, not a killer.”
She really should look away, not peer through the wired glass and watch Sherlock kiss her way along John’s jaw and trap her ear lobe with her teeth.
“What about us? Don’t you need to decontaminate us or something? What is it? SRASM? Polio?” The teacher asked, her worry furrowing her brow.
Amy turns with a high pitched squeal of surprise before slapping a hand over her mouth to silence herself. Sherlock is standing there with his hands behind his back, looking haunting, with John by his side, arms crossed, looking unimpressed.
Watson bit his lip, took another step and continued before he lost his nerve. “Did you mean it? What you sang last night?”
“Well he’s been doing it alone for years.” John leaned back in his chair, repeating the irritating words his partner kept telling him.
“So,” Barnabas started, clearing his throat. “Private detective, that’s quite an interesting profession.” Barnabas started with his joyous voice in an attempt to lighten the mood.
Ms Adler giggled, low pitched. It seemed to have quite an effect on the man. “Meet my new co-star, Sigerson Holmes. Holmes, this is Gary Williams. He’s an agent.”
Out of spite, Sherlock took a huge bite and chewed it while staring at John. Quite frankly, the sight was hilarious, but John was afraid that if he started laughing Sherlock would spit it out and refuse to eat any further. So he fought the impulse and stared back at the man until he swallowed. They then sat in silence and stared straight ahead for the rest of their meal.
Sherlock shakes his head. Jake eyes John, who is looking at Gina, who is now taking pictures of Holt’s office. We get a closer shot of Holt's office where we can see Lestrade inside, talking with RAYMOND HOLT.
Watson tilted his head to the side as he thought about it and nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, all right, call the police. But they have to be careful, we can’t afford to mess up the investigation.”
“Edward is supposed to walk with you!” Morgan’s shout wasn’t that loud, but the intensity in his delivery made Ms Adler take a step back and Holmes take a step forward.
“Agent Watson.” John returned the nod. “Agent Holmes.” Mycroft said tightly before turning and walking out the office door.
Is this another one of those delightful ‘it came with the apartment’ items you keep thinking is a good thing?
Holmes clenched his jaw and nodded once before Watson squeezed his hand one last time before letting go.
“Because we can locate it.” Mycroft cut in, looking insistently at his brother until he moved to sit at the computer.
“For God’s sake.” Holmes fought the urge to stomp out of the room and leave without looking back. He pinched the bridge of his nose and breathed slowly. He was expecting Ms Hawkins to say something, but when he looked up, she was watching him patiently.
It was the first time that the studio couldn’t afford to go out. Instead, he had consulted with Ms Hooper and after a long conversation and going over the budget, they consulted Angelo.
Stamford stood and smoothed his waist coat. “Holmes, this restaurant, this date with Ms Adler, it’s almost more important than the Press Conference. This evening is meant for you to get a good word out about the movie, and people will only do that if they like you. And the people that will be there, they’re directors, producers, actors, agents, casting directors. They are the who’s who of Hollywood. They are the ones that will make you or break you. And same goes for the movie. If you and Ms Adler do this right, this movie will be the talk of the town.” He paused. “Only in a good way, not in a cursed way. Thankfully, you will have the best partner in Hollywood to navigate you around the sharks.” He finished, doing his best to sound hopeful and supportive.
“Yes. You do.” Mycroft answered with an amused smile before turning to Watson. “And so do you. You’re a Warehouse agent now.”
He wasn’t sure if it was the direct insult to his aptitudes as an agent or if he was just done with Sherlock’s endless game of keeping him in the dark, but John snapped.
“Holmes was made aware of my arrangement with Moriarty, that I would be the new producer after the take-over and suggested the idea to Stamford.” Ms Adler explained.
Like before, Holmes turned, Ms Riley dropped her imaginary supplies, and Holmes dropped the imaginary bread and caught her in his arms before she fell, ending in a romantic dip.
“And what is your type?” Holmes wasn’t particularly interested, but he knew the information could be useful to the case.
Jake and Amy follow Chester down the boardwalk. He turns left towards the museum. Amy and Jake hide behind a museum sign. Amy flips up her collar. Jake frowns.
Their only point of contact was John’s hand around her wrist, but she was close enough that Sherlock could feel the warmth of John’s body behind her. Knowing she was naked was making it somehow-
“How-?” John started to ask but he was at a loss for words and he didn’t want them to know how agitated he really felt.
Whatever was affecting John disappeared as he watched Sherlock’s body impact the concrete floor. Without a second thought, he ran to Sherlock and grabbed his shoulders to slide him to safety.
He wasn’t expecting to see Sherlock stunned, blinking a few times, then frowning and tilting his head. Feeling a bit guilty for letting his temper get the best of him, John cleared his throat, bringing Sherlock back into the moment. He straightened, opened his mouth, only to close it and stare at John. He could tell Sherlock wasn’t really looking at him. As odd as his behavior was, John decided to blame it on the fact that the man had a lot of history with this artifact, so he gave him the time he needed to provide an explanation.
Holmes kept his eyes down while Watson gently cleaned the blood off the side of his face. The cloth he was using was rough, but Watson was somehow using it in a way that didn’t irritate the skin. The process was almost soothing, tempting Holmes to close his eyes.
Ms Hooper checked in on him around lunch time, bearing a sandwich and a cup of tea. She found him with his hair askew and crumpled balls of paper on the floor. Watson thanked her and picked at his plate as he continued working. When he took a sip of his tea and discovered it had gone cold, he decided he needed a walk.
Despite Sherlock’s bloody face, they managed to get a cab. It took a while, but Sherlock didn’t mind, not if it meant staying in John’s arms.
Watson was also keeping an eye on Murray. He’d always like Murray, always trying to get a laugh out of everyone, keeping the mood on set fun.
The room was silent as they all looked at one another. Most of the people around the table seemed touched by Stamford’s words, except Dimmock, who still looked worried, and Ms Hawkins, who still looked like she thought Stamford had lost it. Watson, the only other person besides Ms Hooper who knew the real reason behind Holmes’s hire, mostly agreed with Ms Hawkins, but had to admit Stamford had given a good motivational speech.
“And you’ll transfer me back without any protests, restore my reputation and never bother me again?” John looked intently at Mycroft who kept his enigmatic look.
How he continued to run, continued to follow that voice was beyond him, but John kept pushing, even though he felt it all getting louder and harder and heavier.
“You won’t,” Sherlock reassured. “In fact, this afternoon was the most fun I’ve had since this whole thing started.”
Calm down John, he told himself, he’s just trying to get things going so we can get this GPS thing over with.
Jake how dare you call yourself a detective and not know who Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are. You should be ashamed. Shame upon you and your family. Shaaaame.
The polished metal plated door led them into the foyer where a speechless hostess was blinking at the sight of what had just walked into the door. With a heavy sigh, Lennox smoothed his coat and spoke tightly to her.
I have read every blog post, article and gossip about you. I actively participated in your fan club after you, uh, temporarily passed away. And you’re right, even with all that, there wasn’t sufficient evidence to speculate that your relationship with Dr Watson went beyond roommates, colleagues, and friends. But now that I’ve had a chance to meet you, to see you interact with each other, well, it’s kind of obvious.
The doors opened and out walked an aged man in a three piece suit. Watson took the opportunity to step inside. At which point he felt extremely underdressed.
When Watson didn’t respond, Holmes tightened his grip on his wrist, making Watson hiss and turn his head to press his forehead against the hardwood floor. Holmes’s forearm flexed as he leaned closer, his chest pressing against Watson’s trapped arm. The movement changed the angle of his hips, causing the length of Holmes’s half hard cock to press against Watson’s arse.
“Good evening everyone, thank you for having us. Sorry for the wait, I had to um, needed help picking a song on such short notice.” Holmes paused to let the crowd laugh. “Mr Stamford, I cannot thank you enough for this opportunity. It’s my honour and pleasure to work and celebrate with you all tonight. But really Stamford, just a little warning next time? It’s not like I would have said no.” The crowd laughed once more. “Now, I don’t want to spoil the movie, so I won’t sing any of those songs.” The crowd booed. “I know, I know, but our new director insisted. Or was it the screenwriter talking?”
“Things can get intense, especially when it comes to pain play. I don’t want you fainting in the middle of our scene.”
Lestrade stepped closer to Holmes. “Stamford’s right, this is the perfect cover: you’ll have free access to everything and everyone, no one will question what you’re doing since you can always say it’s research for your character or some bullshit like that. You’re the lead, so everyone will do anything to be in your good graces, which means getting them to open up to you easily. Oh, and you can be as bossy as you please, everyone is paid to deal with your moods. They’ll put up with a lot of bullshit, as long as you’re punctual and deliver a good performance on camera.”
Holmes wanted to scream. This was completely ridiculous. Is this really what actors go through? Is this what they need to do to be able to act like a person realistically? Is it that difficult for people to reproduce basic emotions while reciting lines? Or is it a way for them to drop their personal mannerisms to be able to find their characters?
Watson stirred the sauce for his pasta dinner, thinking about writing down a few notes for his new story, when there was a knock at the door. Given the events of the evening, Watson was suddenly worried who could be behind that door. He slowly walked over to the door, and silently cursed when the floor creaked.
that seemed like it came right out of the original star wars trilogy. A calculator screen framed in gray with a white keypad and a matching antenna. John’s head turned towards his partner, understanding why Mrs. Hudson couldn’t help but laugh. This thing was so harmless, it’s was ridiculous that it had driven Sherlock mad.
Holmes downed his whiskey, holding the empty glass in his hands as he breathed through the burning sensation. Worry grew in Watson as he watched Holmes fill his glass and empty it again. Had he stumbled across something deeply personal? Watson was about to tell him he didn’t need to answer when Holmes looked up through his eyelashes, the piercing stare stunning him silent.
“Glad I could be of service.” Holmes sipped his drink. “Honestly, if it weren’t for your presence on set, I would have left after the first day of filming.”
“Yes, but I thought the file was destroyed after it was entered into the Warehouse Database.” John explained, which made Sherlock shake his head.
“Nothing made me.” With a twist of his wrist, the monitors sprung back to life. “I made me.” Sherlock concluded, as much to himself as to John.
After three days and eight failed attempts, Sherlock admitted to herself it was easier said than done. Unless she was barging into John’s room while she was getting dressed or during her shower, there weren’t many occasions to accidentally see John completely naked. So, on day six, when a new piece of paper with a new phone number appeared on the desk, Sherlock decided to create circumstances.
John went from concerned to resolute with a shake of his head. “Sherlock, I’m going to ignore the fact that you look happy that someone’s been murdered and remind you that if we don’t catch whoever is behind this, we’re most likely stuck in this story forever.”
Sherlock knew right then and there that he wanted this. With John. To chase criminals together and laugh at concussions and go home and-
“There was only one copy and it was destroyed when the lab exploded, which would also coincide with the first sightings of the GPS. No, I looked up bank statements, the rest was logical.”
John needed to stop getting closer. Especially while Sherlock’s brain was enthusiastically providing other suggestions.
Watson followed but looked over his shoulder toward the road. “Moran is going to be back any minute now.”
“Here you go dear.” Mrs. Hudson said as she handed John his tea. Instantly John noticed she hadn’t asked how he took it, but he was certain it was exactly to his liking.
“Why did he say it was your fault they died?” Mycroft inquired. John stopped pacing and looked out the office windows into the Warehouse.
Writing and filming this was a crazy ride, and I still can’t quite believe it really happened and that it’s posted after over a year of work (SO MUCH WORK).
“Kind of like the GPS, they’re mischievous. I could tell you stories, but this isn’t really the best time.”
“Love makes people miserable. Drives to self-harm, or to hurt those they love. I’ve solv… read about enough murders in the papers that were motivated by love to know that-”
“I’d say so yeah.” He answered, doing his best to ignore the feeling. He instead concentrated on standing up. “You ok?” John asked as he dusted himself off and offered his hand to Sherlock.
John scrabbled around disoriented and groggy. He leapt to his feet when he saw the violin case was gone. He flung open the door and screamed, "Sherlock? Sherlock?" He took off into the rain and ran less than a block before he realized he has no hope of finding him. He stands there at the end of the mews, looking up and down the street, and his shoulders slumped. The picture of dejection, John doesn't know what to do with himself. He just stood there in the rain and closed his eyes.
John removes his sweat soaked vest and wads it up before tossing it at the sun-glass wearing lanky form occupying the best deck chair on the balcony like a buttered lobster. "You are burning again. I have told you that you are never going to bronze. You are going to go from bleached whale belly straight to skin cancer. You are popping freckles faster than Mycroft pops jelly babies."
Sherlock quickly put another piece of chocolate in his mouth without prompting and chewed in slow motion as if he was forgetting what he was doing. He finally seemed to notice the silence and John’s patient smile and he nodded slowly, one time.
Sherlock's mouth slowly opened, "No, he wasn't." Then his eyes locked on John, questioning, probing, finally understanding.
John existed in fog and half-lit fantasy of his own demise. He drank. He even took up smoking. He ate only when forced. His first few months of sleeping obsessively gave way to sleeping little, unless he was sleeping it off. Strangely, he looked healthier now. He had lost some of his budge around the middle. His features grew angular and his physique took on the tone of the soldier's workouts he forced himself to do just to exhaust himself enough for sleep. He often wore Sherlock's clothing. It was not tailored for him so it always looked a bit like wealth unkempt, or as if he was shopping at one of the second hand places pretending he still had money as could be seen around London often by those who observed such things about other people, but it made him feel close to peaceful to be held in something Sherlock had worn.
Mary stood and put her arm around him. “We’ll see to him.  It is just a seizure.  Looks worse than it probably is.  You have the stewardess get us some more blankets and something…well…he may vomit.  Save the carpet?”
“Bring more chocolates.” Sherlock ordered and popped another in his mouth whole. His cheeks crinkled all the way from eyes to chin as he beamed at John.
John fussed singularly without interruption over Sherlock's head wound. Sherlock had protested the shaving, but had stoically silenced himself after John narrowed his eyes and dared him to continue. "Then we will call for an ambulance and the bobby brigade and I will identify you as an intruder and as they drag your unbearable carcass off, I will declare that I have never laid eyes on you. While you and your beloved brother are occupied sorting out those humorous details I swear on my soul you will never hear a whisper of me again. I will vanish in such a manner that you and Mycroft will discover something amazing. You will always wonder and yet I will show you the impossible, this time. Now shut up, unless you would like to begin delighting me with your, no doubt brilliant, plan of destroying your only friend for your sick version of entertainment."
Greg returned with two cups of tea and pressed one into her hands. Molly sipped it, looking out the window and watching the rain, worried about him being out in this, alone. It is silly of course, he won't care at this point, but the thought still tugs at her heart. Her eyes close and she remembered how just a few hours ago he was on his knees, warm and almost happy, and how she had ruined it all. "He asked me. And I told him yes, but that he would change his mind. He promised. The last memory had to be spectacular. It was. It was lovely. Not how I expected. Still. It was. If I had known…" she sips her tea.
Tiger would never pretermit a target to show off, but he was a patient man and he had an uncanny ability to hit a man and spin him with the impact so that he could take his redundant second shot before the body hit the ground. Killing had long ago lost the challenge. That second signature shot, was what kept the job entertaining for Seb.
"Oh, you know Mycroft, he does it his way. All I know is he better not leave a mess. of it. I already had my share when we lost Sherlock. The bits of…people… I found just lolling around in plain sight," she made a tsk noise and widened her eyes for emphasis, "would have made your insides quiver."
Sherlock, skull exposed and topped for examination, his curls folded forward and his face pulled into the gruesome distortion of the autopsies procedure. Molly, face hard with grief, and streaked with tears as she had sewn up the examinations damage with more care than he himself could have managed. A picture of his flat-mates Y-incision, sewn back together with thousands of tiny delicate stitches and not the ugly black quick-stitches most people received.
"Okay, good. That's good. I'm..dead then? Officially?" John asks, ignoring how many shades of tits up and gutted he is discovering as his thoughts jump first to Molly and how she must feel right now. Mrs. Hudson would cry and he deserved to hurt this bad for making that dear woman cry. Greg would get drunk, probably tell everyone what a stupid git John Hamish Watson was, then get weepy and maudlin. That's what he'd done when Sherlock died. Strangely, when he imagines what Sherlock must be thinking, he smirks with satisfaction.
Rat had never made this information easy, but he hadn’t covered his trail with such impenetrable force that his son could not follow the compass and adjust to true north.  On the day that Sherlock had made his international headlines and Rat had been in cover far too deep to impose upon his own resources to determine the merit of Sherlock’s demise, Rat had experienced such profound grief that he’d blown his operation.
He kissed Sherlock softly, sweetly and almost with reverence, on the lips. He pulls back then looks him sincerely in the eye. His voice was calm and measured, not giving away the fear that sparkled in his eyes, "I love you. I love you. Please don't. Just. Don't. I have to go. No matter what you say, I can't do this anymore. I have to go with you. It is my job to keep you safe. It's my job, Sherlock. My only job. Don't take that from me. I won't complain. I won't demand another thing from you. Just let me…please…let me be by your side. I'd go anywhere with you. I love you."
Take a walk first. It is a beautiful day. Pay attention. His guest replied. One last moment in the world and then we shall see to your appointment.
Mycroft looked at her in perplexed astonishment. “Never mind that, my dear. Nothing I have not contemplated myself on a regular basis since he attained the ripe age of seven. I am thankful he gave up on the career choice of piracy, though his delusions that he's a dragon slayer lead to never-ending discommodious position.   He’s a rubbish little brother, you know.” His smile was placid but his eyes danced merrily.
Mycroft cleared his throat and attempted polite observation, “Your treatments are going well.  I was quite certain his devotion to you was pointless. Feared how this would all turn out.  Yet here we are and most importantly…here you are.” His eyes danced with amused wonder.  “Welcome back.”
It was a Sunday special edition, that brought John both pure triumph and abject pain. His Sherlock was in the news again.
Mycroft carefully read the file. Molly Hooper was the subject. It seems Sherlock had trusted a sleeper. Before him was proof that Moriarty had not so much created his web, as consolidated it into what it is now. He was a mythical Arthur, uniting an underworld. Molly was a lost princess, a grail maid, and he objectively found it very unlikely that she was unaware of her ties and duties.
His only option was to not move, because any movement might cause them to fire and there was nothing he could do except resolve to go with him if they did. The thought made him sick with regret for Mary and his child but John knew if they fired, he would jump in the way and try to shield Sherlock at all costs. His mind was already preparing for this outcome as every happy moment with Sherlock flash through his brain on fast forward. He was so thankful that he’d made his peace with Mary.
They had been tucked under a cushion, half finished, never to be fulfilled. John had stopped eating by then. He held the partial compositions in his lap and smeared them with tears.
If Sherlock were just using her, he could have stopped speaking to her at this point. Oh there was no doubt he did use her, but that wasn't the whole story. It had never been the whole story.
John swallowed, trying to think. “So. I waited. Said that when you got back, I would tell you. I would look you right in the eye and tell you that nobody has ever meant more to me than you. Tell you that I love you. I imagined the look of shock or disgust or amusement. I didn’t care what it was. Sometimes I imagined things that, well, went a bit …south…ward?” John scrunched his nose in humiliation.
"Noted, but I am not wrong. That is your problem, isn't it? Me?  You are so afraid of what is right in front of you that you will use any excuse...especially--"
He had kept them a secret for the last three months. Well, Mrs. Hudson had been aware because he had to get her permission to build the terrace in the first place.  He had worked on this project for the last 8 months.  John had not noticed.
Greg said that John had returned to the flat and made tea and that he had left a note on Waterloo Bridge. She had read his note, or most of it. She hoped. She was clinging to this last tiny optimism that John somehow was safe and he and Sherlock were just unable to make her aware that this was a ruse. It may be days before they had the ability to make contact with her, and that faith was all she was clinging to right this minute. If she went up to his room and the bag is there, she could no longer believe in that scenario. Her ability to tell herself that scenario won't exist. A missing bag might not constitute proof, but its presence would be a definitive argument that John is dead.
“It's called Pepper's Ghost. 'A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person. That’s all I am now. You see?  A living breathing ghost. A trick. Just a magic trick.”
Pale skin and livid eyes. The magnificent one, here already. Sherlock nodded, pleased response only flashing in his eyes and the curl of his lip for a second.
“And he made Sherlock fake his death.  Sherlock had the code.  He had Moriarty’s worthless code.”  John groaned and his hands rose to rub his temples.
John looks at it and his face goes dark. His eyes glassed over as he looked at his friend and realized what he was saying. "There it is, more nightmares," John said as his eyes roll upward, leaving only the whites visible.
John stood up and growled, “Shut up? I mean it. Not another word.” He looked up shaking his head and laughing at the absurdity of the situation. “Yeah, I am going for a walk. Janine, it’s always an education seeing you. Hope you and he—Whatever!”
“How’s your friend?” John asked with a slurred voice, as his eyes tried to focus and he stretched a crick in his neck, which exacerbated his throbbing head.
"So, seriously Sherlock, to what miracle of design do I owe the honor of your company? You haven't reappeared at this moment simply by chance. It can't be some case of sentiment or misplaced foreknowledge of your intent to reveal yourself in the nick of time? You would have never left me like that in the first place if you honestly had any trickles of concern for my obliteration. You must have only come, out of some guilty whim that my demise would render me of no use to whatever sudden need you have retained for my bumbling valueless company. Do enlighten me, my good man? How may your dog serve you this time?"
She shakes her head, grins like he's telling her a joke, sees his face isn't displaying any mirth and then looks down to see he has taken her hand in his. "Is he hurt? What hospital?" Her mind at once fills in that Sherlock probably got John injured already. Greg is here to take her to him. He's like a kindly big brother, with a touch of overprotective father.
He’d managed to follow much of his son’s activities.  It had kept his attention far from thoughts of a certain broken doctor.  His controllers unsurprisingly were sending him on missions at odds with Sherlock’s purposes, but he’d still managed to keep an eye on both of his son’s.  He knew Mycroft was heavily involved in the mess with Moriarty and conveniently the strands of that web were so vast that he could skew the covert assessments of individuals entangled enough to justify his involvement.
Sherlock's brow furrows and he takes a few steps toward John. "You have not died. I am alive and I insist you put that down and remain so as well."
"Wrong Way" Corrigan (1938): On 17 July, pioneer aviator Douglas Corrigan takes off from an airfield in Brooklyn, New York, headed for California. He lands in Ireland.
"Wait, no. I want to see you. You're not him. Don't do that to me." She pressed her fingers to his chest backing up her words.
Sherlock reached into the bag and opened the crisps before speaking. "You would share your lunch with a serial killer? I look like a serial killer to you?"
The detective knew he was in trouble by the time he righted the toppled hive.  He tried to remain calm, but he was breathing hard and beginning to sweat and his mind could not stop his instinct to swat at the painful sticks of venom.
"Sherlock. Oh God, don't go crazy in the… the dark." She grasp for the button that will again light up the phone screen. Molly can't seem to find the correct button and worries that it is dead.
Sherlock rolled over and searched his room.  New John stood at the window and Sherlock noted that his opacity was incomplete from his jumper down.  “John, you are fading.  Is everything alright?”
"Well, my married ones have their little domestics but they aren't as volatile as your boys were. You were just too soft on them. I said it from day one. Should have taken them in hand and you have always let your lines blur between mothering them a bit and being their mother," Mrs. Turner said with conviction.
Mary bit her lip. “Trust us?  This is what we do, Mycroft.  Well, when we aren’t running after our favorite hobby?  Actual daylight, grown up jobs?”
“You didn’t see him. He was shattered. Utterly lost and I can honestly say, if the man ever had something that functioned as a heart, I watched it die on the helicopter ride. He got old right before my eyes.” John told her quietly.
Sherlock had just closed his eyes and reclined to his thinking pose when the footsteps of several strangers and a distinct set of heels announced that he had visitors. He wrapped his dressing gown tightly around himself and quickly pulled an afghan over himself.
John felt something shift inside.  He had been hammering nails to keep this feeling at bay and one moment he was adrift in the doldrums and the next his soul filled with zephyrs and he could breathe deeply and feel the world around him again.
Sherlock smirked, “The treason for the season may be a bit dicey, but it’s fine. You can sit this one out and play scrabble with Mummy and hear all about how hard it was to keep track of their kit during their travels. Sip some punch and sing carols. John and I will improvise as best we can.”
Molly cleared her throat, "He was so happy. He wanted to go. It would have been better. Why didn't you just take him with you? What happened between you?"
Greg nods. "Yeah, I guess so, sweetheart. That's the jist of his note. You sit here and I'm going to make that tea."
"You shan't go. That is final. I'm sorry." Sherlock said sitting cross-legged and leaning up against the tiny bed, still made, in this hourly rental room.
“Me too. Obviously,” Sherlock said as Mrs. Hudson patted John’s back with encouraging little strokes.
Sherlock took a step back towards the man and rubbed his hands together as if about to sit down at a feast. "You wouldn't be tempted by…shall we say an arrangement…would you? Place is only dangerous to those who are willing for it to be a place of corruption. It depends on what you want, of course, but money, fame, torture of enemies are all pretty standard. Sherlock Holmes, perhaps you've heard of me? First day on the job and I'd love to make a sale. My boss is rather a tyrant about our first sales." Sherlock smiled broadly, knowing the expression didn't fit his face in a pleasant way.
“ It's why we came here. I need to know. That is how I get back. I need to!” Sherlock tries to take the pills back from John.
John had been utterly still, face down with a boot at his neck, a knee between his shoulder blades and his eyes were wide open and glimmering with fear and a dreadful resolve. As the first had knelt unceremoniously between his legs, the gruff teen told John of the lessons he intended to enact to expunge his sisters disparaged virtue.
worried about my feelings? That is a load of rubbish and you know it," John said, using his finger to gesture at Sherlock.
His body responded enthusiastically toward Rat’s blatant advances and innuendo.  His mind refused them in no uncertain terms.
