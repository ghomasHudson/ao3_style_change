Steve liked to claim he was some ninety-five-year-old man, but he was a ninety-five-year-old man that only had about twenty-nine years' worth of experience to draw on. That meant that instead of driving like the ninety-five-year-old grandpa he claimed he was, he drove like the asshole twenty- nine-year old he
Tony went to tell him to 'fuck off,' but he remembered at the last second that there were impressionable young ears listening, and he bit his tongue then turned his attention back to the kid.
He grabbed some clothes from the drawer and went into the bathroom to freshen up, showering off the remnants of last night's activities in full, noting the bruises on his thighs, bruises that looked a lot like fingerprints. He touched his fingers to the purplish marks and remembered the way Steve had gripped his thighs as he pushed him apart and licked his slit, fondling with his tongue and making Tony writhe in pleasure. He shivered at the memory, his abdominals lurching, and before he knew it, his hand had trailed up to those extremities in question, and though still sore from last night's fucking, he began to work himself with his fingers, bracing against the shower wall and remembering the way Steve had taken him, had forced pleasure through him, had given him the most mind-blowing orgasm he'd ever experienced. He rubbed his clit, thought about the way Steve had growled at him to touch himself, the way Steve had found some magical spot buried within him and forced him to take it, to writhe with it, to breathe Steve's name out like he was his own personal god and Steve had just given him salvation.
," Steve said, louder and more determined than previous, "and they all agree it's good to, you know, talk to the baby while it's, you know, still in the womb. So he gets to know our voices."
"What? No, I totally get that this is happening to me. I understand it. I know it. I spent forty-three years as a man, met the wrong screwball from space, got turned into a woman, and got knocked up by an antique they pulled out of an iceberg, and there's a little caveat about having to carry the whole thing to term because otherwise I'll die. Yes, I totally get that."
He stood from his seat, the other two following suit, and it was not until they were at the door that the witch spoke again.
Because he was Steve's, and Steve was his. They were together. They were one. Nothing and no one was going to take that away from them. No one was going to force him to do anything he didn't want. He was Steve's. This was Steve's. This belonged to Steve, and Steve belonged to him.
He put the mug to his lips and downed a soothing gulp of the drink, and Steve leaned over and kissed his forehead then sat back and began to pick at his bagel. "So, what are you thinking?"
He tried to take a bite of the cookie in her hands, but she made a noise of protest and pulled her hands away from him. Tony's mouth twitched before he glanced up at Steve.
Steve swallowed, and the apples of his cheeks tinged a little pink as he averted his gaze. "Nothing. Never mind."
Tony remembered what had happened to Steve before he'd fallen from the sky, and he frowned at Barton and said, "Is he OK?"
"What's going on?" Steve asked, still looking a little resigned but clearly trying to steer the conversation back on the right track. "The scepter?"
He climbed the steps to the second floor and went into the bedroom. The lights came up on entry, and Tony closed the door behind him and let out a heavy breath. He went over to the dresser and grabbed the pajamas he'd neatly folded and put away that morning (Steve's pajama bottoms were still bunched at the foot of the bed), and he stripped off that day's ensemble. He set it on the chair beside the dresser then stood in front of the mirror, looking at his body in nothing but a bra and a pair of underwear. He was getting used to the shapely woman that stared back at him, but — he reached down and put a flat palm against the ever-growing swell of his lower abdomen — he wasn't sure he'd ever really get used to
He quirked his lips into slight amusement and crowded Tony just the slightest bit. He was probably as tall as Steve, but not as broad. Or attractive. "You cannot tell me a gorgeous creature like you hasn't been hit on before," he said, and Tony presumed he was trying for 'suave' but he was more coming off 'smarmy.' "You're probably fighting 'em off with a stick."
Tony chewed the bite of pancake then pulled the platter of eggs and toast closer and dug into that. "I can't believe out of everything last night, the two of us standing in front of the elevators is what gets everybody into an uproar."
"Aren't you supposed to be on your own floor?" he muttered in response and sat down on the couch. "Where'd the other two go?"
The others were silent a moment before Barton said, "Ah, lies and secrecy. Always the foundation for a good relationship."
had shown up, and suddenly, all Steve wanted to do was get back to the fucking war and get a do-over.
"If this ever— If we ever have another— If something like this happens again, I don't care what crisis is going on in the world, you tell me if you're going into labor. I don't care if I have to talk you through it over a comm line, you tell me you're in labor."
"Because I know how and when exactly it happened, and there were only two of us in the room at the time, and she wasn't the other one."
“I’m pretty sure this isn’t an approved disciplinary action as set forth in the Avengers Initiative manual that I never bothered reading.”
"Very true," Barnes said quickly. Natasha lifted a hand from Tony's back and reached out to swat at him, but it was a friendly and playful kind of swat, and Tony didn't care what line they were parroting at everyone else — there was definitely more going on there between those two than met the eye. Maybe they were both just taking it slow and wanted to make sure it would work out before they went and announced to everyone they were an item. He couldn't blame him, he supposed, if that were the case. After all, there was a
"I just—" He heaved out a sigh and pushed at the fries on his plate with his fork. "Maybe telling the truth wouldn't be the worst thing in the world? It might freak some people out, and some people wouldn't believe it anyway, but maybe… Look, it's not a path I'm crazy about taking, but given the alternative, maybe this is what we have to do? I know it would make us even more vulnerable than we already are, and I'll
As he closed the door, Tony took the slip of paper between his fingers, pinching it there to hold it as the door closed, the paper coming away from the polished steel and remaining between his fingers. He held it up to Steve and said, "Brucie's none-too-subtle way of telling the rest of the derelicts what the sex is."
Steve just sighed and shook his head but said nothing to counter, though Tony knew him well enough to know he wasn't agreeing with Tony so much as trying to get him to drop an argument that he had no chance of winning.
"Well, to be fair," Steve said and continued to stroke Tony's hair, "you still have a habit of employing questionable innuendo. But it's harmless and I think it's kind of cute because I can tell you're trying very hard."
"Might be handier than you think," he replied, and Tony rolled his eyes and turned to see Steve paging through the book, jaw set and brow furrowed in utmost seriousness.
“OK, first of all, you don’t want me using your title when we 'do that'—” he used finger quotes on the words, “—maybe we don’t play pissed-off-captain-fucks-his-cocky-teammate-into- submission.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. "Then maybe we shouldn't have a private conversation in a public restaurant."
Tony just snuffled and adjusted the hold he had on Olivia, cradling her closer and brushing his lips over her tiny head. He'd been crying at the drop of a hat since yesterday afternoon — and over the stupidest shit at that. Fucking hormones.
"Oh," Thor replied, though he looked confused as to why Hill was calling the woman 'aunt' when she wasn't even related.
"Ty Stone?" Steve — darling, wonderful Steve — said, sounding a little confused. "Isn't he the guy that owns all that media…stuff?"
Again, it wasn't like there was ever a chance of it happening. It couldn't happen, could it? Wait… much as he loved her, 'Olivia' was an old-lady name, right? So, chances were that the Cap had picked out that name for their little chatterbox sprog, right?
He should have felt guilty. He should have felt so, so guilty. He should have been hating himself for this, should have been lighting candles or saying prayers or doing penance for those that were lost and those that would never come back. There had been a war on when he'd gone to sleep, one he'd been itching to join from the start and had eventually found himself neck-deep in. He'd killed men, and he'd watched his best friend fall to his death.
"In the car. When you're driving and she's in her car seat. She likes to kick the back of the seat."
The rest offered varying nods of reluctant agreement, and Tony pulled away from Steve and went over to get himself one of the bagels that remained.
"Doesn't matter," Steve said with a curt shake of his head. Something popped up on his tablet, and he turned his attention away from the folder and swiped at the screen to read it. Tony just went back to slathering the other half of his bagel with cream cheese, and Steve clicked his tongue in disgust and said, "Where did this expression 'baby mama' come from?"
"Steve, don't—don't do anything stupid, all right? Don't do anything… Just be careful. Those fuckers play dirty."
"Hey, you have to admit the Sexiest Avenger Couple has that exotic Russian-spy thing going for them. You two've got the whole dad-thing going on. I mean, isn't that a diaper bag on your shoulder?" He motioned to Tony's right side.
"Because he does," Natasha said, but there was no judgment behind the words. Just truth. "Because he spoils you."
"No? No, what? Honey, I know sex ed in the dark ages was non-existent, but trust me, that pearly-white shit you squirt out of your dick when your balls tighten up and you feel so good you can't do anything but—"
"Oh, also?" Tony said and turned back to the others. "When I get back, I firmly expect two of you to have retired to either your own floors or the communal floor. This is mine and Steve's. I'm not sure why the rest of you spend so much of your time here."
"Ignore them," Tony said breezily and picked his drink back up again. "They're just jealous because they're alone and unloved."
your 'Papa,' so stop acting like I give a shit about your existence beyond figuring out how the fuck soon I can get you back to where you belong."
"Possible? Like I said, I know this all seems kind of far-fetched for you even with all the crazy shit the Red Skull and Hydra got up to during the war, but trust me, there will come a time when this won't even be a drop in the weirdness bucket for you. You will not even blink at leading a group of ill-matched idiots comprised at various times of a god; a giant, green rage-monster; a couple of spies; an ex-assassin; a couple airmen — who are, no questions asked, the most normal of the group; a witch; an android; and an egotistical mechanic, among others. I know it sounds crazy, but trust me, if anyone can handle it, you can. I know people consider me the smart one and you the cute one, but to be perfectly honest, I don't think I could have done what you had to do and still have my wits about me."
"Hmm... yeah, you wanna try translating that from 'asshole' for me?" Tony asked as he opened the fridge and pulled out a carton of eggs.
"Ugh," he said and let Steve pull him back into an embrace. "Sounds so… Sounds like the kind of name you grow up hating because your parents were assholes and didn't think about the logistics of naming a kid 'Antonia.'"
"I don't know," Rhodey said. "Maybe the way your knees practically gave out on you when he laid one smack on you."
Steve stared at Tony a moment before he nodded once more. He exhaled a groan and shook his head a little before he gave Tony a lopsided and slightly bitter smile and said, "Every time I think I'm done being surprised about the future…"
"Look, I know this all seems odd to you, and it's odd to me that it's odd to you because this is our life, and with the things life has in store for you, eventually, this won't even rate on your weirdness scale. You'll think it was all a dream, and you'll tell me about it on a snowy Christmas Eve — seriously, how fucking cliché; we even get a 'white Christmas' — as we pile our spoiled brat daughter's presents under the tree, and you grumble about Barton and his BFF Buc—er, the One- Armed-Man putting all those holes in the drywall because they were having a pissing contest over which one has the better aim. Spoiler alert: they both suck after five glasses each of Grandma Barton's down-home homemade egg nog. I think you were honestly more upset that they weren't even bothering to give the impression that they were listening to you, though — let's be honest, babe — you are the last person that should give any of us grief about following orders because the only order you ever followed was to repeat your marriage vows when— Well, you'll find out."
"Mmm… Is this my hint to keep my grubby mitts off that payout you got from the government for leaving you in an iceberg for seventy years?"
He didn't wait for Steve to reply. He just went about making some tweaks to Barton's arrows, and after a few moments of silence, Steve said, "Tony, that wasn't… That wasn't what it seemed like."
He took hold of the zipper of Stark’s jeans and yanked it down with a sharp tug, Stark gasping beneath him. He reached into his jeans to palm a hand at what was clearly the beginnings of a painful and desperate erection, and he startled a little at the feel of silk hitting his hand.
semblance of a normal life after what had happened to him, and at the moment, the Avengers were probably the best-equipped to do that for him.
He closed his eyes and shook his head, and Tony must have sensed that Steve wasn't as happy- go-lucky as he'd been a moment before, as the next words out of his mouth came in the form of a very concerned, "Babe? You OK? You still with me?"
child, a child we made together — in my arms surrounded by all of our family and friends and a ton of crap they all bought for us for the care and wellbeing of our child. Does it look like I give a shit if, by some weird twist of fate, we're both technically too old for the other one? No. Clearly, this is the way it had to happen for us, and honestly, I'm totally OK with that. Now, undo that knot in your stomach that got all tied up the moment you started convincing yourself you're too old for me and go over and grab that nice, big box Pepper and Happy were so kind to bring with them — even if I have a feeling it's actually been sitting somewhere downstairs for the past two months — and bring it over here. I don't know why, but I have a feeling that might be the swing I picked out."
Steve glanced down at his belly, and he just hummed a little before he leaned in and gave Tony a gentle kiss on the mouth. "You look beautiful to me," he said, his voice just above a whisper.
Steve chuckled again, and he picked up Tony's hand and brought it to his mouth to give it a kiss. "Mmm… How much longer do we have?"
"But for reasons kind of out of our control, we weren't able to keep that just between us, and so here I am having this nice chat with all you fine folks."
Tony nodded his understanding and nestled against Steve's broad and inviting chest again, and Steve rocked him back and forth, putting gentle but firm arms around Tony and holding him close.
" He motioned around them. "This would have been months upon months of saving for me — maybe even years. Making deliveries didn't exactly pay a whole hell of a lot."
He finished toweling off, practically rubbing his skin raw with the effort, and he stomped back into the bedroom and, again, made sure to avoid looking at himself in the dresser mirror as he yanked open drawers for underwear and socks and whatever clothes he felt like putting on.
"…certain things happen," he said, glancing away. OK, he may have already admitted to the guy that he was knocked up, but no way in hell was he going to tell him that he had to carry this thing to term under pain of death.
Steve looked down, and he thought very briefly about defending himself, but he realized that was wasting precious time, and he shook his head and made his way over to the bathroom, stripping off the rest of his uniform along the way.
And that baby was going to know it was loved and wanted and appreciated. Whatever happened with Steve — God, he didn't even want to think about that son-of-a-bitch at the moment — this child was only ever going to know love and security. This baby would know he loved him as much as he knew his own mother had loved him. There would never be any doubt in his mind.
Tony sat there a moment, frowning, and the sultry, peppy standard coming from the bandstand finally wafted through the dour fog of the last several minutes. "Well," he finally said as he watched the couples swaying — couples like Thor and Jane and Pepper and Happy and what even looked like Bruce and Natasha. "This just sucked up the night."
"No, I just— First of all, way too much, uh… And second, there's some things I don't need my mom finding out about, all right?"
to look when he's addressing JARVIS, so I guess the ceiling makes the most sense to him," Bruce added. "Stop trying to pick him apart. You're not doing yourself any favors."
"Oh, I'm sorry." He looked down at himself. "Do I or do I not have a super soldier spawn growing inside of me? I am allowed to say whatever the fuck I want."
He grabbed a glass from a cabinet and poured out half the mixture into it. Rhodey hadn't moved from the table, and he could hear the joyful shrieks of a child playing with her robot buddy and one of her 'Uncles,' but he ignored them all and poured half the drink down his throat.
And Tony? Tony was crying. Not sobbing. Not wailing. But crying, lightly, for the first time in forever. Crying against Steve's chest and pressing his face into the solid and secure muscle he felt there, wetting his t-shirt and wrapping tight arms around Steve's narrow waist. He didn't know where the emotion came from, but loathe to let his guard down even that much, he snuffled some and said, "I'm crying, Steve. I'm fucking crying here! Look at what I've been reduced to!"
"Pretty settled on the boy's name, from what I hear. And the girl's you can't agree on because you both want your mother's name first."
"You know, if he just joined us permanently, he wouldn't even have to worry about getting a leave. In the real world, they're called 'vacation days.' Or 'sick days'—" he stopped rubbing Steve's shoulders for a moment to use finger quotes on the phrase, "—which, for whatever reason, always seem to happen on the nicest summer days."
But the humor vanished from Steve's face and was replaced by something that looked a little like understanding. "Does it bother you?"
He pulled a knife out of the drawer and cut the sandwich into quarters, and Olivia happily picked up a quarter and bit into it, humming again as she bounced in the chair.
"I remember very plainly stating my case to the manager that the prices they were charging for their hors d'oeuvres were a bit exorbitant."
at them this time. She gave Steve what could be described only as an appreciative look-over before she turned to Tony, and her eyes lit up with delight.
It was just as he'd left it. The tree still glowed in the corner; beautifully-wrapped presents were stacked underneath it; that strange television-type thing on the wall was airing some sort of… image; two coffee mugs sat on the coffee table where Tony had set them when he'd tried to talk to Steve about what was happening to him.
Tony looked down at the sleeping bundle in his arms, at her feathery lashes and the soft wisps of hair atop her head and the way her tiny little mouth was parted as she lay so peacefully in his arms. He noted the way her tiny little fingers curled themselves into fists, her body clothed in a pastel-colored sleeper patterned with little gray kittens that had been a belated gift from Sharon, and he swallowed and tried to imagine what it would be like — what his life would be like — without this little baby in his arms, this little ball of love and affection and late-night frustration when she just wouldn't go to sleep. It had been an awful,
Not that they in Avengers Tower noticed this. The Tower had been off the power grid since Tony had set it up to run on arc reactor technology just before everything with Loki and the Chitauri had gone down a couple years earlier. For them, there was nothing amiss that sunny, warm, late- August morning except that Tony
Tony knew he meant about the adoption thing, but he exhaled a breath and said, "Oh, thank god! I thought you were serious about that birthing class."
Bruce took the photo from Barton, and he inspected it just like he had the other two and again gave his assessment.
Not one man that attended that meeting with the witch believed her powers extended to granting man the ability to conceive a child, and there was much discussion with the other members of Council whether attempting such a feat was even worth it. It would not cost much in terms of time or effort to follow the instructions she had supplied them with. A few drops in a cup of wine each night for seven nights. A pinch of the proffered herbs on the meal plate of the Chancellor and three on the plate of the King. What was supposed to happen after that was up to God himself, and so the Councilors did as they were instructed. Two drops of the amber liquid were put into the King's wine glass at supper. If the King noticed a change in the taste of the beverage, he said nothing. For seven nights, they followed this. On the seventh night, they sprinkled one pinch of herbs over the meal presented to the High Chancellor. Three pinches went over the meal presented to the King. For all they knew, they were slowly poisoning their God-anointed monarch, and for that, they would face not only the law of man but the judgment of God Himself, but the King seemed to be in exceedingly good spirits that night, laughing and talking and gazing even more lovingly than usual at his high chancellor. The King and the Chancellor retired at their usual hour, heading in separate directions as always, though only an idiot would think they weren't intending to meet up. Once most of the staff had retired for the night, the Councilors quietly made their way to the chapel, lit candles, and prayed for understanding and penance from God, whose very law they may have just questioned.
with Steve. He felt protected and assured and knew that if he were to fall, Steve would be right there to catch him. And now, that feeling extended to the hungry little newborn in his arms. He just
about it because he's sick of you going to him about this stuff and he thinks you need to go to an actual obstetrician about it."
Steve's hand was lax on his back, and so Tony pulled away and wandered around the gallery, the gazes of either friends or clients of the owner settling on him as he moved past, brows knitting together like they were trying to figure out where they'd seen him before. There was also a man with a camera wandering around as well, though Tony couldn't tell if he was paid or was just a friend of the gallery owner with an annoying hobby. He'd spotted Tony and poised his camera a couple times as though to take a picture of him but had thought the better of it at the last second, confusion etched over his face as he presumably tried to figure out just who exactly Tony was.
Other Tony laughed. "I'm not. Honest. Look, I don't know what to tell you about David's comment to Captain America at a party where he probably wasn't on his first drink. The guy's a paranoid, reactionary, conservative asshole. Maybe he did too many drugs in the '60s. I don't know. He was a left-winger when my mom knew him. Did a hard one-eighty when Reagan got elected—"
"OK," Barton said, "but you gotta make sure to get them all out in one breath, otherwise your wish won't come true."
But then he remembered that these photos were probably going to end up splashed all over websites and television programs, and he heaved out a breath and continued on his way.
He felt Steve brush his lips over the crown of his head. "I know, but I mean it. Anything for you. Always."
Her fingers faltered only a moment before she was back to massaging in a gentle and soothing rhythm.
And that Steve and his Steve were pretty similar in how they kissed, now that he thought about it, but that kind of followed, didn't it? They were just alternate universe versions of each other.
"Not in public, you're not," Tony muttered then stood back some and bit his lip as Steve tore the paper off the box and cracked it open. He pushed away the tissue paper and frowned, clearly assuming the box contained something very different.
"I can't believe you two." He turned to Steve. "And now I'm pissed at you for a totally different reason."
But the words seemed to pique Steve's interest and he looked between them like was analyzing something and said, "Seriously?"
He went into the living room and, as JARVIS had said, Steve's tablet was on the coffee table. He picked it up and took it back into the kitchen, and he went over and stood behind Steve and held the tablet in front of him so they could both look at it at the same time.
Barton scoffed. "What's to rat-out? He knows what you're doing. He's humoring you. He's against it, but he's humoring you. And
"Uh, what for?" Tony asked, genuinely confused. "Not only did we agree on 'boy,' but Brucie already inadvertently spilled the beans on it actually
"Look, I'll take the bed tonight," he said and made his way back over to Tony, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Hey, for all you know, she'll vanish and disappear during the night and go back to wherever she comes from. We'll talk, OK? Even if she's still here and still bouncing around like a lunatic, we'll talk."
"Nah," she said and shook her head. "An' Pepper usually takes me out, and we go for lunch, and we get our hairs done, and sometimes she lets me sit at her desk and pretend I'm important."
He wanted it gone. He wanted it out. Forget what he'd said to Steve earlier. That was before Bruce had driven home the horror of what he was risking. That was before Thor had oh-so- casually informed him of what the entire purpose of the hex was. He wanted it out of his body. He wanted his body exactly the way it had been before that crazy little diviner had worked her magic on him and turned him into an internet meme. Yeah, sure, at the time it had been fun, even titillating. How many men got to find out what it was like to live as a woman? To fuck as a woman? To be fucked as a woman by a gorgeous super soldier? Look, it wasn't like he and Steve hadn't taken full advantage of it, and yeah, there was a part of him that feared toward the end of it that Steve preferred him as a woman, and as much fun as that week had been, he wasn't certain he would be willing to stay a woman the rest of his life.
"How long have you two been together now," Bruce said as he leaned his chin into his palm, "and I still want to tell you two to get a room?"
After wobbling wandering around in goddamned stilettos for another five minutes, he finally came upon the table, and he settled down onto his chair and said, "Did you guys move or something?"
Clint left a message on your machine. You know you're the only person under eighty with a landline, right?"
Natasha just arched an eyebrow and took a sip of her champagne while Bruce looked at the card in his hand and said, "I don't know. Are you Table 1?"
"Hey! You can't blame this on the future. This is all those assclowns at Hydra. Take it up with them."
He probably went up six or seven times, loading his plate up each time, and Tony did nothing but smile at him and laugh each time he said, "OK, one more plate."
"Say what?" Tony asked, gripping onto Steve's arms as though that could somehow keep anything bad from happening to him, the old wool of the uniform rough but somehow comforting under his hands because it was
wonder if the bastard wouldn't know it if it bit him in the ass. I think he's afraid to be happy or feel happy or let himself relax. He doesn't think he deserves it. Thinks he's still got something to prove to somebody. I don't know who. You stare at him with those big doe-eyes of yours like you see your entire world in him, and I don't think he… I don't think he gets that. I don't think he sees it. I don't think he lets himself see it. I don't know why. I mean, there must be a part of him that's firing on all cylinders because he was smart enough to marry you, and Steve was never the type of guy to just settle. Steve wanted the perfect partner. He didn't want to waste his time with anyone else."
"We weren't. We were kidding ourselves. We're better off as friends, and who in their right mind would want to get saddled with me the rest of their life, anyway?"
"Haven't really had time, jellybean. Been sorta…babysitting alternate universe me's kid and trying not to break her. Seem to be doing OK so far."
"No," Tony said. "Just…thinking." He shook his head again to clear his thoughts then said a firm, "Maria."
"Oh, yeah, Brooklyn is so much cooler. You know it's filled with douchey white-boys wearing fedoras and beards and drinkin' ten-dollar lattes, now, right?"
was more than enough for him. It was Steve, so he'd do anything for him, but still. Dredging the depths of the Potomac was not exactly something to be crossed off his bucket list.
Still, it was Obadiah Stane that had set him on edge, had always looked at him with equal parts distrust and disgust. When Howard was alive, it was no big deal. Howard still owned and ran the company, and Stane had no power or authority over him. When Howard died and Stane stepped in as intermediary, suddenly Steve noticed a change. He even noticed it about Tony — the contemplative looks Tony would sometimes give him like he was trying to figure him out, and Steve could only wonder if Stane, who was the other real father-figure in Tony's life, was filling his head with stupid notions that he was only with Tony for his money.
Tony shot a pointed look at Bruce. "That's the mindset of our great Sentinel of Liberty. A twelve- year-old boy."
Steve snatched up a package that hadn't been touched yet, and he looked at the tag attached to it. He shot a look at Tony and said, "Santa's handwriting looks awful familiar to me."
He tried to play with the specs for the suit, he tried to upgrade Natasha's Widow's bites, he tried to come up with some new ideas for arrows for Barton, he tried to make a few tweaks to Wilson's wings, but like he'd found the past couple months, he just couldn't concentrate. Abandoned and unfinished projects littered his desk and the floor — sure, OK, he used actual paper for some of them and chasing it around at least gave DUM-E something to do outside of hovering over him like some nervous old hen — and he was just attempting to work out the formula for the proper magnetic relay for Steve's shield when Natasha walked into the lab, Barnes right behind her. He glanced up from where he sat at his computer terminal and nodded 'hello' at them then went back to staring at the formula on his screen.
Tony exhaled a sigh. "Not going to give up, are you, old man?" he muttered then said, "She's been ours from the start."
"Always lead with the more important one," Natasha said then set Tony's leg aside and added, "Come on. We'll go over to the table. I'll make your fingernails as pretty as your toes."
He grimaced a bit. "Yeah, here's the thing, I got turned into a woman for like a week, and then I went back to being me only not
was he saying this? Why he was he going this route? Why? What had possessed him to take up Tony's offer after all? That's what he was doing, wasn't it? Taking up Tony on his offer? Asking Tony to teach him how to dance? Asking Tony to hold him in his arms and sway with him and—
He turned to Tony, and it was like a light clicked on over his head. His lips parted as realization dawned, and Tony shivered as he saw a little hardness come into Steve's eyes, like he suddenly realized
"Uh…sure?" he said as she bounded into the bed and curled up on the side of the bed that…had once been Pepper's.
Thor shrugged. "I am not certain there is anything to do," he said. "This was a gift bestowed upon you, a way to strengthen and solidify your bond. It is meant to be a joyous moment, as there are many across the galaxy that would give their most prized possessions to be where you are right now."
Steve stared at him a moment before he moved to set his plate and his tablet aside, and as Tony went to ask what he was doing, Steve turned back to him—
"Yeah, at least when he was pocket-sized, I could just grab him and hoist him out of trouble. Kind of hard to do now that he's bigger than I am."
Tony licked the remnants of peanut butter and chocolate off his spoon. "The one we were having earlier. About if you were attracted to me."
She then took the stethoscope and began to listen to his heart, over the chest, then over the back and telling him to take deep breaths, and when he'd passed that test, she said, "OK, now I just need you to lie back. I'm going to do a breast exam."
Well, except Tony. Who'd gone and not just bought him another TV but had bought one of those expensive flat-screens. Clint, upon seeing the brand-new TV set up in the shitty apartment Steve shared with Sam and Bucky, had just squeezed Steve's shoulders and said, "
"Hey, I'm not anyone's elder statesman or anything. Don't come looking to me for sage advice or anything."
Tony sighed out a breath. "I don't know," he muttered. "I don't know what to call myself anymore. I look like this, but I
"Nothing bad. I mean, I might have thought about putting some questionable stuff, but it's pretty boring and generic. I mean, it's hard to answer truthfully when I'm
Natasha, however, hadn't moved her gaze from where she stood there and stared at Bruce, the stare being more 'glare' than anything, and Bruce seemed to realize this, wincing some as he looked between them and said to Natasha, "Don't tell me he didn't know."
"Hmm? Oh. How the fuck did you not go crazy during the war? I mean, I see the way you are now, and I'm guessing that's not a side effect of that seventy-year ice bath you took. I can only assume you had that beforehand, so… Seriously, how did you deal with it?
"Good. Don't need Captain America charged with assault and battery of some fucking paparazzo that deserves whatever shit he gets."
"Well, I'm just trying to speak 'old man' for you so you understand. Wouldn't want you confused by something the under-nineties can appreciate."
"No, it's 'cause he usually has JARVIS telling him where to go," Pepper said and took a sip of her cocktail, and Tony looked upon her in insult.
"OK, sweetums, then you're not six-two because there's only five inches difference between us, and five inches on that would be—"
"Tony," he said, his voice soft and gentle to avoid spooking him, "we're not… We're not trying to force you to do something you don't want to do."
"Yep, you're definitely not a father yet." He turned his attention to Olivia. "Daddy's not hungry right now. How 'bout you let Papa have it?"
"Look, man," he continued, not unkindly but with a firmness to his words that said he didn't entirely sympathize with Steve, "you broke his heart. Now, I don't know what he was like when you actually said the magical words—"
"No," he said with a sigh. "You don't have to kick his ass." He twitched a bitter smile and added, "I'll put the fucking Iron Man suit on and do it my goddamned self."
He led Tony back into the bedroom, and he lay him down on the bed, and he gazed down at him for a moment, almost as though to assure himself that everything was as it should be before he stripped himself of what little clothing he wore and climbed into the bed with him. He braced himself over Tony, covering Tony's body with his own, and as he bent his head to capture Tony's lips with his own, he nudged his knee in between Tony's legs to part them.
Bucky grinned licentiously then sobered as he turned back to Steve. "Seriously, that was an abusive relationship waiting to happen. Severed body parts stuffed into garbage bags and strewn along the highway. Head in the freezer. Pretty sure that's how that relationship would have ended. Your body parts, not his."
"Jeez, Tones," Rhodey mused beside him, "you're…really going all out with this, aren't you?" Tony just ran the color stick over his bottom lip and then his top before he pressed his lips together to even out the color.
us. It's how we bond with you. We make fun of each other." He motioned to Bruce. "Dirty hippy." He motioned to Steve. "Old man." He motioned to Tony. "Spoiled, whiny brat."
He stared at him a few more moments, and as Natasha exited the garage and pulled the car onto the street, he figured it wasn't worth arguing the matter and simply said , "Well, I suppose one of us had to wear the white dress, and Steve's just too fucking pale to wear white and get away with it."
"Tony, you're a fella. There's no place for this to—" he made a squeamish face and an odd hand gesture, "—come out of. It's not going to— We need Thor. We'll get in touch with Thor. Bruce said he's been spending time with Dr. Foster. We'll contact her and see if she can put us in touch with—"
"Sarah," Cap said before he could finish his thought. "After my mother. Always liked to think, if I ever had a daughter, I'd name her after my mother."
Steve rolled his eyes and slathered a god awful amount of cream cheese on his second bagel. "Tony, no, you're not a slave, but you're a—"
"OK, that's bullshit, and everyone knows it. And you, my generously-endowed love, can afford to be, well, magnanimous about it. This fucking putz can't. So, anyway, he's fucking grinding against my thigh, and I finally get him to a point where I think he's nice and interested and, yeah, definitely turned on, and I lean up to him and say, 'I used to be a guy.' He didn't quite hear me at first and asked me to say it again, so I said, 'I used to be a dude.' He, charming fellow that he is, said, 'Not with a rack like that.'"
He went to protest this, but Olivia chose at that moment to pipe up, "Papa, c'n I have another piece?"
"What the hell?" Tony cried out at them while Steve said, "Thor, put me down," grinding out the words like he was chewing gravel.
"Thank you," he said and bent down to kiss him again. He stood back up, and he shot a look at Barnes, and if Tony didn't know better, he'd say there was a silent warning issued there. Again, it felt like he was intruding on a private moment, and so he looked away, but he was pretty sure he understood what Steve had telegraphed to Barnes:
"Fine," Tony muttered again and went into the bedroom. Steve waited a moment before he went over to Olivia's bedroom and set her down in her crib, making sure she was free of anything she could accidentally suffocate on. He pressed a kiss to his fingertips then pressed his fingertips to her forehead before he turned and went back to his own bedroom.
Steve did not hesitate in the least in pulling him onto the elevator and hitting the button for their floor.
She patted her lap and said, "OK, bring your leg up," which he did, and for the next twenty minutes or so, she worked in relative silence as she went about giving him a pedicure — not just polishing his nails but trimming and shaping them as well. It was as she was blowing on his toes and waving her hand over them to get the first coat to set faster that Tony broke the silence and said, "You know, I think we've just crossed a new boundary in our relationship."
"Eh," he said with a shrug and scratched at the back of his head. "You know, she was a kid. I mean, it's hard to
Tony nodded. "Exactly." He gave him another leer. "And you are indeed the best-looking ninety- seven -year-old I've ever had the pleasure of setting eyes on."
been stroking him when she'd had her hand between his legs. At first he'd thought it was because that was just a boundary he wasn't comfortable crossing with her. Now…
"I guess," Steve said with a sigh and glanced up to the TV again. He frowned, his gaze squinting, and said, "Didn't you have dealings with Justin Hammer?"
He did mean it. There was a certain comfort, to an extent, to going back to that body, and he had missed it and everything that went with it.
Tony again kept his focus on the road ahead of them but said nothing to that, and instead of finding it suspicious, Steve instead found it a little disheartening, and something ferociously protective awakened deep within his soul. Tony was able to take care of himself; he knew that. But he sensed vulnerability in Tony — a deep, dark emotional vulnerability, and a painful pang hit his heart at that thought. From out of nowhere, he wished to pull Tony into his arms and shield him from all the ills of the world. He wanted to protect Tony, defend him from those that would perpetrate harm against him. The bravado and the cockiness were a mask. Deep down, Tony was vulnerable and insecure, and more than anything, Steve wanted to banish those wretched thoughts to the netherworld where they deserved to reside. Tony was beautiful and charming and brilliant and handsome, but Steve knew he didn't genuinely believe it about himself. Something or someone, somewhere, had caused him grief. Something had made him doubt himself. Something had made him fight to prove himself. He was a little like Steve in that regard, he supposed.
conception she 'blesses,' and the wonderful and special father of my child refuses to chance anything because of that."
After all, of the four people in that room, he was the only one literally in the middle of pushing an entire human being out of him, so he was sure that counted for something, and it was probably about four more pushes after that that Bruce said something about crowning. Oh, dear fuck,
baby and not some sneaky decoy. He gently set her on the cushion beside him and undid the top few snaps of her little pink sleeper then ever-so-carefully pulled the collar down just so to check for the faint birthmark he'd previously spied on the back of her left shoulder. Not even bothering to hide his exhaled relief when he saw it — his baby, this was his baby — he tucked her back into her sleeper and snapped it back up, Natasha smirking at him the entire time.
And then, it was like all the pieces of the puzzle were sliding together, and a picture that he had never wanted to see but had known was there all the time had formed and could not be erased.
…that you two act around each other, and I can tell you right now, Tony, neither one of you is a good enough actor to fake that kind of thing to a kid that takes its very existence in her life for granted. Or what about the sister she claims to have? That she's never going to see again?"
"Steve, what are you—" he tried to ask but was silenced by Steve's mouth on his, and when he opened his mouth in a gasp, he was rewarded by—
In the past, he'd been the type to try and fill those kinds of voids. If people weren't talking, then clearly something was wrong, he'd always felt. Plus, silence, he'd found, was uncomfortable.
, and even though there was something about something tearing, and even though he was pretty sure all sorts of disgusting things had passed out of him already, and even though he felt like he couldn't do it anymore, he just gave one last push, and before he knew it, through a literal amalgam of blood, sweat, and tears, there was the unmistakable cry of new life.
Steve tried oh-so-hard not to smile, but it was hard, especially as he choked on a laugh at Tony's haughty attitude toward being caught out, and as Tony huffed and combed his hair, Steve gave him another glance-over and said, "There's a point where they stop being 'lifts' and start being 'heels.'"
Cap paused a moment and grimaced, like he'd suddenly thought better of what he'd wanted to ask. "Nah," he said and rubbed the back of his neck, "maybe I don't want to know."
"So?" she replied and frowned. She looked between Steve and Tony and said, "Is this…not what you wanted? All bonded couples wish to create life from their bond."
Steve set the remaining parts on the floor then pointed to the box. "Says right here for newborns to age three."
happen, I am not letting you or Olivia or the Avengers go without a fight. I am going to do my damnedest to keep us all together and in one piece and happy. I am going to do everything I can to make this world a better place. I am going to do everything I can to make sure nothing is ever taken away from me without my consent. I am going to do whatever I can to make sure you and I spend our golden years sitting in matching rocking chairs and spoiling our grandchildren and boring them to tears with stories about the good old days. I love you, you idiot, and the hell I am letting you go for anything."
She popped open the kit to reveal a bevy of nail polishes in varied and vibrant colors and what looked like the implements to give a proper manicure or pedicure.
"Wait, they think I'm…and that you… Didn't anybody think to, I don't know, check the county clerk's office? They saw us down there. The one on file is for Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, not Natasha Carbonell."
Tony just turned his bemused confusion on Steve, and Steve reached over and set the onesie aside with the other outfits she'd gotten from her aunts and uncles.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Whatever. Look, I'm not saying we should stock up on a full wardrobe and an entire toy room, and I'm not saying we even have to do it
The Cap just balled up the paper wrapper his fourth burger had come in and tossed it into the pile with the others. "It's… It's coming," he said with a somewhat uneasy shrug.
But Steve was irate, pacing, running a hand through his cinder-strewn hair, and he turned back to Tony and said, "I had him! I fucking had him!"
"Hmm?" Wilson said. "Oh, we came to see how things are going. Making sure Stark's not crying into a tub of gelato or something."
"I'm sorry," Steve said and reached up to rub his back then gave him a little shove in the direction of the seating area.
Tony hummed and said, "No, that's sweet, babe. That's really sweet. You know there's such a thing as sudden infant death syndrome, right?"
Tony frowned and watched as Bruce then tended to someone asking instructions for where to put someone that was on a respirator, and when he'd finished, Tony said, "I could be ready to…
He moved away from the window, stepping around the large, lighted evergreen and the massive pile of presents underneath it. He made headway into the kitchen, Tony's earnest attempt at making cookies greeting him in arrival. He was at the island counter, flour and cookie sheets and other implements of destruction spread around him, and Steve called out a cheerful, "Need any help?"
Tony looked over his assembled friends and said, "Wait. Are you people seriously grossed out by it?"
But none of her unease had let up. "I'm serious, Tony. Steve…leans on you." Tony scoffed, but she continued, "You're what grounds him. He's got the rest of us, and he's got the hunt for his old pal, but those are distractions. You… You made the future safe for him. You made it OK for him. Things aren't as scary for him as they could be because he's got you leading the way for him. He knows you're not going to let him fall any more than he's going to let you fall."
The hunt for Hydra cells took them to somewhere in the former Soviet bloc, which produced three things: a formerly safeguarded remnant of Chitauri tech, a bunch of Hydra lackeys that were left to take the fall while the big-guns got away—
"My friends," he said as he set Mjolnir on the table, "I am afraid I return the bearer of bad news."
But he made some sly comments about asking Tony if he 'needed help' with the squirming toddler and did Tony 'even know what he was doing,' which, after the 'heels' comment, did not impress Tony, who just motioned to the child and said, "You think
"Pepper and Happy," Sam said, something funny — maybe something bordering on jealousy? — coloring the tone of his voice.
He wasn't, his friend having fallen asleep on the couch, and Tony thought about waking him up, but he decided not to disturb him. He shot a glance back at the steps and thought about going back to bed, but every time he closed his eyes, he saw that fucking mothership exploding in flames, and not wanting to chance another nightmare that would wake up Olivia again, he stumbled his way over to the elevator and went down to his workshop.
Barnes nodded slightly and let himself be led away, and Tony frowned as he watched them go, wondering what he'd said to make Barnes close in on himself like that. Was it the question about what more he wanted? He'd only meant it as a joke.
She shrugged. "Papa says your floor's your private sanct'ary where you gots herbs and spices t' help y' calm down 'cuz you get real angry real eas'ly. I don't go there a lot."
"You're gonna call us that until the day we die, aren't you?" Tony asked, throwing a glance at Thor before he went back to the presents, and Steve saw he was dividing them into piles.
He got up and cleaned himself up, drying himself off and changing his shirt, and he picked Olivia up from her bassinette and sat down in the rocking chair with her and began to nurse her.
. Contrary to popular belief, I am not the horrible brute I make myself out to be. He may just be…traumatized…by what he saw."
And evidently one that he needed to wonder about no longer. He didn't doubt for an instant that Olivia had been conceived that first time he and Tony had done it after Tony had been turned into a woman. Unless there was something that space kook Esmeralda wasn't telling them and Olivia was really just a clone of some kind of Tony, then he knew for a fact he was her father. More than that, Tony was most definitely under the impression that Steve was the father, and if there were ever a shred of doubt in Tony's mind about that, then he would so vehemently argue for it whenever the occasion called for it. But Tony was not under the impression that anyone but Steve was the father of his baby girl, and he would go to his grave telling anyone and everyone that would listen that Steve had 'knocked him up,' and not a single one of their friend or acquaintances even doubted it.
He never gave Steve a chance to answer 'yes' or 'no.' He just dragged him out, away from his friends, away from the party, and out onto the streets at eleven-thirty at night where they strolled in the muggy early fall darkness and talked about everything under the sun. He found out Pretty Eyes's real name was 'Tony.' He was studying engineering. He liked to build robots and listen to old-school rock. He had a weakness for jelly doughnuts. He didn't have a good relationship with his father. Steve, in turn, told Tony about himself. He told him his name, that he was studying art, that he was struggling with whether or not to join the military, that he was an orphan that was going to school on scholarships and loans that were just being added to the medical bills left over from his mother's treatments (that clearly hadn't worked).
But Tony just gave him an empathetic look and said, "Neither did I before this one came along," then lifted a hand from the steering wheel and jerked a thumb at the backseat. "Been a learning experience for us both, but I think we're doing OK."
"I don't blame you. I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it. I was just…pissed at you. I know it almost makes it sound like you raped me or something, but that's not… You never did anything to me that I didn't want. This isn't your fault. It's that witch's fault. It's both our faults for being idiots and thinking we're above silly things like basic human biology — which, I guess in your case, is a fair argument. I just… Saying that I can't be Iron Man anymore? Grounding me? It's just one more thing that makes me realize I have no control over my own life now, and I don't deal well with not being in control — not of myself, at least. I get that you're scared, and I get that you're afraid you'll be too concerned with my whereabouts to concentrate on what you need to do, but from my angle, it's…"
Wilson snorted a laugh, and Tony tilted his head in thought at Barnes and said, "I don't know if I really like you hanging out with Barton."
Steve stopped cutting. He glanced up, his line of sight focused ahead of him like he was contemplating something rather than actually looking at something, and he took a breath and cleared his throat.
No, not thinking that. Not going down that route again. Not now. Not ever. Son-of-a-bitch wasn't worth it. He wasn't worth the tears, not like...
Tony snorted a laugh. "You think that's impressive, babe, wait until you see the internet." He groaned as a bell of some kind 'dinged.' "Yeah, I know. Steve, put your seat belt on."
"I don't think it's Hammer," Rhodey said with a sigh. "I think she's just tired and overworked and disappointed that she can't be at your wedding. Wouldn't you be disappointed if it was the other way around and you couldn't go to her wedding?"
But Steve… Steve didn't even want to touch him. Didn't even want to think about him like that. Just told him to go take a long, hot shower and he would have everything here waiting for him when he got out.
Bruce just winced back a little, probably because Tony had all but shoved the box in his face. "Uh… Why are you being so…"
He made his way back over to the table, and he saw Steve sitting there hunched over and staring at something in his hands. He knew without a doubt it was the sonogram photo, and he twitched a smile and muttered, "Fucking sap," then went over and slid back into his chair.
He smiled a little at that, and against his better judgment, Steve found himself cracking a smile in response. He didn't know why. Something about Tony brought it out of him.
. Holy fuck, does it hurt! I mean, just try to imagine shoving a goddamned light bulb through your nostril."
— well, it stood to reason that he wouldn't want to face the man any longer than he absolutely had to. And it wasn't as though he could explain
"He's not dead," was Barton's reply, and with the knowledge that Thor would be there to grab the suit momentarily, he took off toward the 'jet, Barton yelling, "Stark! Stark, wait!" behind him. He passed Thor on the way back to the jet, and he ran up the ramp and up to the table where Steve lay sprawled out, stripped down to the waist, Bruce tending to his wounds.
"What? Making myself look good?" he asked as he capped the lipstick. "Honestly, these stringently-delineated gender roles society forces on us are such a fucking pain in the ass. I actually
Steve wanted to believe the best in people and in things. That belief had been tested, especially in the reveal that SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra pretty much from the start, but he knew deep down that Steve still trusted. He still saw good in the world. Tony was beginning to sense that Steve was starting to limit his belief in that 'good' to himself and his teammates, but he still saw some amount of good, and he still possessed some amount of optimism. Hydra would not get them because Steve would not let them. Because Steve trusted that he wouldn't let Hydra get them.
"Well," Steve said and rubbed his hand up and down Tony's thigh, "so long as he didn't recognize either of you, I guess that's all I can ask for. What would you have done if he'd said he wanted to see it?"
Steve just kissed him again and rubbed his belly some. He rested his hand a moment then said a quiet and awed, "He's moving."
And why had it taken so long for Steve to live his dream? Surely, he didn't wait seventy years. What about Peggy? Didn't he marry her after the war?
It wasn't until he met her clear green eyes that he realized he'd been getting a little worked up, and he put his hand atop the one she'd placed over his chest where the arc reactor had once sat and tried to breathe with her. In. Out. In. And out again. His pulse was racing, and he knew his blood pressure was elevated, and he gasped out a few breaths and closed his eyes. He was reminded of how similar the reaction to this was to the panic attacks and the nightmares he'd had about the portal after the Battle of New York, but he pushed those thoughts aside as best as he could and just concentrated on the horribleness of the here and now.
"Science," he corrected. "I don't actually have to be in the suit to control it. You losers are currently readying for takeoff while I get to sit here in my lab and stuff my face full of ice cream and cheeseburgers."
"Tony," Steve said to quiet his babbling, and Tony miraculously shut up for a second, "yes," he stressed. "I agree. I completely agree."
"I think it's a reasonable reaction," Tony said after a moment of watching the computer run through the test. "I mean, my pal Rhodey and me? I was straight and he wasn't and he said he didn't think I was fuckable? Yeah, I'd be a little insulted. Like, what's wrong with me? Why aren't I good enough? Am I unattractive? Am I hideous? Why am I not fuckable?"
"Look, you're not from around here," Tony said and didn't lessen the hold he had on Steve's hand. "I think you might be a little confused as to what the word 'blessed' really means."
Tony sighed and sat up a little, struggling to get there, but getting there eventually. "I just assumed we were. I know what I initially said about not being able to be a parent, but I— I'm willing to try. I want to try."
"Hmm?" he asked again as the first few notes of the next song wafted through the air. "Nothing. Just…"
He snorted a laugh. "What? You believe that little tattletale about me and Cap? Is that what this is about? You think this is the culmination of some teenaged wet dream for me?"
Steve thought he heard Tony grumble something about 'living with Oscar fucking Madison,' but he ignored it and instead helped himself to more cookies.
Tony took several breaths and closed his eyes, letting himself be soothed by the calming strokes of Steve's thumbs against his cheeks.
"I am so confident in his wrongness that I've put up fifteen thousand dollars of my own money as collateral."
"A little while ago," he replied, unable to hide the slight strain in his voice or, now that Tony looked a little closer, the concern in his eyes. His heart sunk a little.
Not that he would tell Esmeralda this. The hell she could ever know just what exactly she'd done to him.
"Yeah," he said and exhaled a breath. He exchanged a look with Tony, and Tony smiled a little at him and said, "You can go if you need to. You know that."
"It doesn't," he replied, his voice sounding feeble even to his own ear, and Tony held out a couple towels to him.
Steve was already up and out of the bed — Tony assumed him to be the one making the noise in the kitchen — so he couldn't use Steve's strong and solid form for leverage. Not that he
Tony Stark — is on life support after he tried to kill himself because Captain America was cheating on him with Jabba the Slut."
Tony swallowed down acid just thinking about it. "J, you know curry isn't agreeing with me at the moment."
Steve just furrowed his brow in confusion, and Tony hummed and said, "I see your reading only went so far as the actual birth and nothing after that."
He wasn't trapped on the other side of the portal. He wasn't stranded. He was home. On Earth. In New York. He was in his own bed. He was safe. He was OK. Nothing bad was going to happen to him.
"Yeah?" he said and turned the screen off then stuck the phone back in his bag. "Well, when this happens to you, we'll see how hyperbolic you think it is to have to pee all the fucking time. Don't even get me started about how fucking weird it is to have something moving around inside of you."
the pain I want you in. I want you dripping and desperate for me to let you come, understand? Say 'Yes, Sir,' if you do."
"For all intents and purposes, you just started, Tony," he called back, not bothering to turn around. "It won't be coming for a long time. Google some suggestions for what do to — maybe even read up on what the hell's going on with you. Steve isn't here to ask at the moment."
Steve went to lead them across the street, but Tony held steady and still, and Steve frowned and said, "What's wrong?"
Steve thought about this a moment then nodded. "Yeah. The finger quotes. Do you think I could pull that off? I saw Bucky do it once. I mean, if he can do it, I should be able to do it, right?"
