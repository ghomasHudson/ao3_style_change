Albion calmed down very quickly when we stepped into the warm water. John had squirted that water with some of the lavender baby bath fluid that we used.
He hates work because everyone is so nice to him because they think of him as a disabled war hero and treat him like someone with a terminal illness. Except for Shona, who these days pretends he doesn't exist.
“Inspector,” Ms Powers said quickly.  “Sue Powers, Social Services.” Her arms were outstretched and she nearly had my baby.
It spills out in an agitated stream. “Because. I haven’t had much experience with relationships and I thought that maybe I should try. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m not the most alluring of men. I repel people and I can’t always see why. My gift for repelling people wreaked havoc on my attempts to have relationships when I was young. I don’t see why I should miss out. Why do you date women? Because you enjoy the company, right? You don’t have a patent on loneliness, John.”
The next day, when John wakes up in their bed, he finds a wide smooth place where Sherlock has slept and a poem pinned to the pillow:
Godzilla doesn’t disappoint. It’s her favourite game. Her she comes now, twenty-seven inches of baby girl in a pink onesie and a blonde topknot, Bonnie Jean Sherlock Holmes Watson, storming through the coloured blocks, squealing at her brother and father and straight into my arms.
Tummy time is best undertaken on the floor, and I’d laid a yellow blanket and some towels in front of the couch. I reasoned that Albion should be seeing more colours on the spectrum wheel now and that yellow would be a nice contrast to the more subdued colours of the flat, and that he might be interested longer if I had some different texture cloths to lay on.
Sherlock wants to explain that he has the perfect substitute for lube but when he opens his mouth, John is tenderly kissing the awkward little spaces around his Adam’s apple and no words come. He’s never had his throat kissed, nor had any reason to stop and imagine how wonderful it would be.
Gentle readers: The British parenting laws are complex and best left in the hands of far more astute people than me and when I say astute I mean lawyers. The Acts and regulations to which I make reference in this chapter are enacted a little differently to how they are described here. I had to weigh up whether it would be preferable to adhere to the last syllable of the law or prevent you all from slipping into a legal coma, which can of course be fatal.
Sherlock doesn’t turn around. Obviously, naturally, of course I am – all these things sit in a queue on his tongue. “Yes,” is all he says.
John, who topped his final year in pathology, obstetrics and an elective unit in trauma surgery, has no idea who is speaking to him. Perhaps it's some woman from Accounts. Sally? Selina? John can't remember.
Molly handed me the huge box. It was a baby trapeze thingy, a sort of plastic pyramid that you lay the baby under so they can grab little toys that are dangling from the frame.
"Yes. Categorically. I can't compete with that. I actually don't want to compete with that. Why do you have a human head in the fridge? Is it someone you know?"
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asks as John gently lifts one wet foot from the tub. And then he realises – his pretty toes are being erased. He concentrates on masking his disappointment while working out the many interesting things he could do with nail polish remover.
“Of course I’m right. And obviously, I’ve always known you’re Machiavellian. I wouldn’t be marrying you otherwise.” He lifts his gaze to John’s reflection and smiles with a tiny crinkling of his nose.
“So now you only have to read 145,” he tells John. He turns to Greg. “Incidentally,  Detective Inspector, you may wish to speak with the Uncle in this matter if he’s still alive, and” – he hands Greg the second file - “This child was clearly abducted by another patron in the shoe store. There’s three interviewed in the file. Maybe you should track them down.”
While John surveys the few boxes in the empty room that make up his all his worldly possessions, Sherlock is in the shower, standing on one leg with water beating down on his shoulders as he tries once again to fit all his toes in the tap. It bothers him enormously that not all of them fit properly. He makes a post it note about a tap with a bigger spout and whacks it on a low wall in the mind palace.
“He is indeed,” Sherlock confirms with a practiced smile. “Please come up.” Her thin high heels make sharp little taps as they climb the old stairs.
After the breakthrough bath, I balanced my harpoon on two chairs and watched the clutch reflex of his feet. He was tired, yawning (and if there is anything prettier than a yawning baby, I haven’t seen it) but quite happy to stand on the metal pole as I held him carefully. His feet curled around it beautifully, just like the apes from which we descend. (We lose that reflex at about six weeks and are fit only for flat horizontal surfaces forever.)
“This very easy,” I assured him as I laid him, on his tummy, on the big blanket. “You’ve got to strengthen the muscles in your neck and shoulders so that you can hold your head up. Once you can hold your head up you can look at things when ever you want, and once you can do this, you can sit up.”
The following morning Sherlock was examining weakness in tooth enamel on teeth he was plucking from a disembodied jaw. No argument could be made to prove he didn't get maximum benefit from his severed head.
That afternoon Sherlock sat in his chair with closed eyes and his chin rested on an apex of fingers while he calculated, against his better judgment, the kinds of things he would like in a friend.
I was smelling his hair, and cataloguing the feeling of the roots against my lips and nose. (Finer than a dog, more coarse than a Himalayan goat.)
It was very interesting. He drank nearly twenty millilitres without even bothering to open his eyes. Then he yelled at me for giving him wind, and the nurse came back and showed me how to burp him.
“Consulting?” little Sherlock asks his brother. “How does he mean ‘consulting’? Aren’t all doctors consulted?”
Greasy sniffed. “I mean no disrespect ma’am, but this little girl has managed to close off her feelings from a very young age.  You’ve already admitted that you had very little contact with her in her early months –“
Papa tries to persuade the little boy to come inside but Sherlock won’t leave. Eurus won’t either – she sits besides her brother, puts her arm around his hunched shoulders and rests her head on his shoulder.
There are two noted exceptions to the packing - his computer (which will fit on top of the smaller box) and the Sig, which obviously he will need on Saturday night.
"You'd need to obstruct your breathing, darling. Pooling alone won't knock you out unless you have secondary respiratory issues. You're still too healthy. If you need to be unconscious, why don't you just get someone to knock you out?"
Sherlock takes a moment to needlessly arrange the feathers one last time before trudging up to John’s room. Ordinarily he would use this opportunity to paw through all of John’s belongings and secrets, but such an activity held no charm anymore. Instead he opened John’s sock drawer and stared with great misery at the fourteen pairs of socks, each one rolled into a neat ball with its brother. One by one Sherlock takes a pair, unfolds it, holds each sock to his face before rolling the pair together again and laying it gently in the drawer. He recites all the colours of the socks in his head and, as he holds each pair, recalls each outfit that John wears with specific socks.
She was wearing a navy blue suit (Valentino, I’m certain) and expensive Sergio Rossi boots. Her hair was cut neatly and styled softly over her face and was filled with caramel highlights. I wondered if perhaps she had been to Saks and made use of the stylists they have there.
And a beautiful yellow light shines over the whole problem. He gives his now gleaming phone a wild smile and punches a rapid text to Lestrade.
John plonks his groceries on the table and tears the envelope open quickly. He’s terrified Sherlock has gone off and harmed himself, or scaled the Hindu Kush, joined the merchant navy or done any number of disastrous, distant things that John hasn’t imagined yet.
John Watson had been walking the earth and (I hoped) overcoming his sickness of everything for nearly nine months when Adrienne showed up at my flat. I am still completely ignorant as to how she got my address, although I suppose I could have told her, along with my banking details and shirt size for all I know, while we were off our nuts in the crack house.
“Lovely. What a lucky boy. Now can you tell me, what kinds of things do you do with Albion? Mr Holmes?”
We were plagued by unexpected levels of fear. We didn’t know how to start kissing one another. I was uncertain if it was permissible to start unbuttoning his shirt. We both worried that we would wake the baby so we retired the couch, which was too small, and we ended up rolling onto the floor, which was too hard.
“I’ve seen her photos of Albuquerque six times and they never change,” I told Albion. That seemed to interest him and he went quiet, obviously hoping to hear more. “Albuquerque is a large town in New Mexico, which is one of the fifty states of the United States, a large land mass in the Northern Hemisphere. The other states are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia – “
John has to get to the nursery to collect Rosie, so he doesn’t start on his files until the next day. When he arrives at 221b the next morning, he finds Sherlock already up, showered and suited, and knee deep in files.
"No, just going to pick up a couple of text books." Recently he has been musing on finding a part time job in a clinic or maybe in an E&A room. He needs to brush up on a couple of areas of pain management and more recent x ray diagnostics.
Eurus arrives with Papa and Mummy to find Sherlock sitting down on the shore, sobbing. Mycroft explains to his parents what has transpired.
I tried to then work out what Adrienne needed. She had come to my place with just her phone and a packet of cigarettes, so she was clearly domiciled elsewhere, perhaps with her sister as she claimed. Did she want to live with us? I would have to buy more sheets if she did.
John turns his face calmly and nods. "I'll have you in and out of there in 75 minutes." And he smiles. The stranger stares.
Sherlock is crouched on his haunches, staring quite intently at a deep puddle of coagulated arterial blood. Detective Inspector Lestrade is standing above him holding a large ready lamp that casts a wide yellow light over the most recent murder scene.
Sherlock nods as he considers this. He likes the sound of consulting. It sounds imperative, but not necessarily emotionally involved. It has class.
The boy takes a deep breath and steels himself. “I’ve read all your blog. It’s awesome. I’m trying to memorise the 243 kinds of ash.”
John is silent. Sherlock can sense he's a little embarrassed so he tries a different approach. "I told you'd be an asset at a crime scene."
When he was fractious I would talk to him about weather. I explained high pressure systems, low pressure systems, how thunder and lightening are formed and what scientists currently surmise is the rate of global warming.
"I don't know. I doubt he'd care. They're living together so I'd imagine WatSON knows exactly what his like."
He kills four young people, all drug users, all tattooed with a phone number. Where are we with the phone intercepts, incidentally?"
That bothered me enormously. What should get better? Did he want me to wear a nurse’s uniform? Should I make more noise?
John is wandering around Marylebone Street, trying to put some shape to these revelations. It’s a waste of time, because the cause of his unhappiness is not Sherlock’s new identity, but that he, John, was not a factor in his discovery of that.
John, with both strong arms wrapped firmly around my son, gave me his beautiful smile . “Thank you. It’s so good to be back.”
I turned around to face a tall, unwashed man carrying a baseball bat in one hand and a sawn off shotgun in the other. He looked vaguely familiar.
After the police officers left, Sherlock wondered through the strange old fake graves and made his way back to the shore, where he sat alone and wept again.
In the second month, she took four days to learn the violin. In mere weeks she was playing Bach, and with no errors. Ludwig took copious notes as he watched Eurus teach the instrument to her brother Sherlock. She then suggested to Ludwig that she was ready to learn the cello (which she would later teach Mycroft).
“I wasn’t expecting all this,” Sherlock says afterwards, still in John’s arms, measuring the volume of his lungs and memorizing his heartbeat.
It started on the first night. She had made up her bed, and was really looking forward to a good night’s sleep after the exhausting move. Peanut was curled up near her feet.
“John, this has been agonizing. You know how I hate surprises. Just let me read it and I promise I won’t change a syllable. Unless it’s wrong.”
"It's not good for team morale when I do that. In any case I have to keep my powder dry for when I really need them to stop doing something stupid."
John tapped the purple fish again and we watched it swinging aimlessly. “After they took Ollie away and told me all about her, I realised she saw a broken down man who was in mourning,  some bloke who was just desperate for any kind of comfort. She needed someone broken to dupe. I was exactly the kind of sap she was looking for.”
"I'm alright," the stranger says, but he steadies himself against John and is a little wobbly on his feet for a second or two.
“Sherlock, you’ve just told me about plans to check a site for a body. I have to inform the Homicide and the Cold Case squads, and they are going to want to be present. “
(All except for one from Buenos Aires, which included a small note that read, “You’d be surprised how much penguins remind me of you.”)
"Oh.” Billy has to think about that for a few seconds before he realises Sherlock is more quaint that he thought. “Oh! Well, it's always the ones you least expect. I figured you were quite the bedwarmer but now I think about it, you're not the one for flirting and groping."
John crouches down before Sherlock, who still holds Rosie, a little dozy now after the long ride and boring conversation.
“Oh, yes. He liked him enormously. He thought he was brave and smart and unlike anyone he had ever met, and he wanted to be friends with the Woodsman forever. Anyway, the Prince solved the green paint murder and was then chasing a serial killer who tried to poison him, and the Woodsman killed him with a single shot over 100 metres through two windows.”
John, who inherited his gun from a fellow soldier who hanged himself, is not getting any better. He arrives home on Thursday night to find a hastily scrawled note taped to his door.
“I know I called you a machine once and I’m sorry.  I was wrong. You’re not a machine. But I want you to be like the machine in the story and keep giving me poems as long as I live.”
Albion stopped crying for a few seconds and stared at us both briefly, correctly assumed we were both idiots who were going to disappoint him and started crying again.
I don’t ever carry a bag so it was disconcerting to be starting at this late age.  I couldn’t see how I would end up using all of the equipment in the bag but figured it was probably better to lug the stuff all over London than to risk word getting back to the Mothers’ website. They frightened me enormously and I’m not frightened of anyone.
Bob is drinking peppermint tea and being very circumspect in his responses to Sherlock's careful questions.
Later that afternoon, when Albion was yelling at me for being an idiot for not being  able to settle him down, Mrs Hudson, apparently home from Albuquerque, knocked on my door.
The old man rubs the soft silky flannel of Sherlock's dressing gown and his eyes brighten like crystals that catch the sun.
Which caused me great excitement because Anya had left two home cooked casseroles in the fridge a couple of days ago and that meant for the first time ever,  I was going to be able to offer John a home cooked meal.
He stares down each boy for a few satisfying seconds, lets his steel gaze fall on the ringleader and watches the boy’s reaction before he lets him have it.
The Triage nurse is at the end of his shift. The bleeding man with chest pains will probably be his last patient tonight.
Sherlock reads the cards carefully. Captain. Doctor. Blood group A. Roman Catholic. 15 May 1972. He feels the small leather wallets they're kept in, runs his thumb over the stitching, smells the smooth worn backs.
I was changing his nappy, which sometimes meant I had to all but hose him down (what was going on in that tiny little gut that he produced so much wind and excreta?) and then I’d polish him off with a baby wet wipe thingy.
Sherlock provides this scenario simply expand a theory, but realises that it resonates with John deeply. John looks down for some moments, the thought that any action of his might bring harm to Rosie too much bear. Sherlock parses the statement and has the same conclusion. It is intolerable, insupportable that she might be taken from their lives so suddenly and permanently.
Friends. Oh, for a friend. It's a lovely thing to hear and John sinks back down on the pillows Sherlock has wedged behind him.
That statement, coming from my father, is akin to any emotionally healthy person writing you a sonnet.
As Sherlock stands, the Detective Inspector raises the lamp so Sherlock can follow, in reverse, the track of blood loss.
That evening, Sherlock and John cook a special dinner. No reason, they tell each other, just because.
"She's sixteen or seventeen, not a local, travelled here with a friend. She lives in outer London but doesn't come this close in often. She's been working tonight and had some hot chips before she got here. She still lives at home, probably with one parent, probably with some younger siblings. She's using the drug herself, she's not been doing it for very long though, so she may have been introduced to the trade recently, possibly through a friend. The murderer's stolen her purse. Has
Sherlock walks all over London for hours, thinking about nothing and everything. He ends up staying at Mycroft’s, who assumes John has kicked him out, perhaps after a fight of some kind. Mycroft’s every endeavour to learn more is met with a sour face and mild abuse and he gives up after the eighth try.
“You should have told me I gave you straight boy pain. I could have told you that this is not one sided. It’s mutual. There’s no pain.”
People come and go, all of them with something to teach him. He’s interested to see how many young women are wearing corduroy this season, how many people in general are dying their hair and how many people under thirty can walk quite safely while looking at their phones.
The taxi approached a large modern warehouse, identical to every other large modern warehouse in Western Europe.
“John, rest assured that there is always a room for you here. Consider yourself my flatmate starting now.”
Something was wrong. I had a painful sickness that stretched from my gullet to my pubic bone. My skin was hot and damp, my hands shook, the lining of my mouth was dry as paper. It would be hours before I realised that for the first time in my life, I had been literally scared rigid.
The old gauze lifts easily to reveal the stitches, their little black tails of thread bent in different directions. John carefully presses the wound with his fingertip; it comes away dry and the skin appear to be fusing nicely.
“The definition of bisexuality has been corroded in popular usage to be synonymous with promiscuity and unfaithfulness, but that is ignorant and preposterous. I can’t fathom why people assume that choosing from a mixed pool of potential partners automatically causes infidelity when bisexual people are no less committed to lasting relationships than heterosexual or homosexual people.”
He stood there next to me in the hospital foyer where he had just watched me being discharged. I had been hospitalized because John Watson’s wife shot me again, just before she was arrested.
They woke in the morning to Rosie calling to her dada from the side of the bed, and announcing with great pride that she had made it down the stairs by herself.
Billy’s delighted laugh is coated with phlegm from deep in his throat. He loves to help. “That’s my Sherlock! Always gets his man.”)
The notion made me bilious. “I can’t eat stew for breakfast. It goes against the grain of my cultural identity.”
John grimaces. “No,” he groans, “No kid ever wants to know about their parents’ sex life. If she asks how we got together, we’ll just tell her we kissed for the first time under a beautiful tree in the Kew gardens.”
Sherlock celebrates solving the case with a bowl of long life noodles at a nice Chinese restaurant nearby that he knows stays open late. He finishes with three fortune cookies which he always enjoys because of how they contradict one another, then goes home and sits in the dark and ponders blood clots.
Personally I couldn’t see what all the fuss about but Lestrade was growing more distressed. He wanted to call social services.
Not surprisingly, Albion was a very important factor in the kind of couple John and I were to become.
“If you have called me to try yet again to extract information about John’s speech, you’re wasting your time,” Mycroft sniffs.
John makes his happy, high-pitched giggle. “I love this relationship so much already!” He combs some of Sherlock’s curls behind his ear and tenderly fits his mouth over the entire ear.
“I will write you lots and lots and lots of letters! You have to write me lots and lots too, so I got you some writing pads.”
He hates getting out of bed in the morning because he is exhausted from patchy sleep and he has to leave the house, and that means he has to walk past Charlotte and her warlock and it's likely they'll be at it like rabbits.
That’s the thing about drugs. Adrienne wouldn’t even notice me if we sat opposite each other on the tube, but a few puffs of heroin and here we are, apparently about to have a baby.
Michelle is on time and, John thinks, surprisingly pretty in a pink jumper. She's always neat, Michelle, neat and tidy and blemish free. She looks a little unreal to John. Her hair shines naturally, her skin is clear, her smile is wide and shows straight rows of even teeth, but there's no quirk, and therefore no challenge. John likes her a lot because she doesn't attract him one iota.
A little later she curls up in an immobile circle on the lounge room floor, which makes it very easy for John to sneak up and lift her gently into the cage. She's instantly furious and her loud, frightened miaows snag his heart. Captain! What the jiggering fuck! Why am I in a cage, Captain? Get me out of here now! That's an order!
“Of course he did. And he loved the baby too. And the Prince could not have been happier. And all he wanted was the Woodsman to be as happy, so one night, he gathered the Woodsman up close and said, if you want to have a baby, we could find the fairy and engage her services to make you a baby too. Not to replace Ollie, but to make up a little for pain of losing her.”
On his way home John stopped for some groceries and added a few sweet things to his basket. Soft sweeties like caramels had, during previous depressions, helped lever Sherlock out of his black holes of misery.
They all listen carefully as Jeremy explains taking screen caps from movies and designing his own cast from the stills.
"Explain what?" Sherlock is about to launch in to a tirade of petulance but the Detective Inspector is immobile.
“Poets can be idiots. We had one who came to our school when I was fourteen and he was a complete idiot. Kept reading us poetry.”
I deduced early on that he is thorough like this because he was a soldier and in that capacity spent an inordinate amount of time studying the lay of the land.
Molly put my blood in the same bag as Albion’s. I took a photo on my phone of our blood side by side and have made it my wallpaper.
“If you mean with chemicals and bricks, no, not really. But if you want to experiment with me in there” – John leans his head towards Sherlock’s bedroom – “the answer is yes. Yes.” He holds Sherlock’s eyes and his face softens as he adds an important clause. “Except it’s not an experiment, is it? It would be love making.”
Molly bought me a book about the periodic table, which brought me much comfort. I read it in bed that night. It had pictures. (You might like to read it. It is called The Elements, by Theodore Gray and is written for people who don’t like chemistry but wished that they did. If you’re missing the periodic chart, like I was, I daresay you’ll find it very comforting too.)
Because I want to kill them with my bare hands. I want to burn down their house and smash all the windows of their car.
“They had a house and had chores and went to the park and had messes but lived happily ever after,” he smiled. “Like us.”
Sherlock talks only to Jeremy in a surprisingly kind voice. “Straight Boy Pain. When a gay man falls in love with a straight man and the straight man doesn’t realise that every straight thing he does makes it worse for the gay man, because he thinks they’re only friends.”
The first time Mycroft saved me I had just turned two. We were visiting some terminally dull relatives in Greece and who owned an unnecessarily big house outfitted with a tennis court, orange trees and a pool. I still can’t fathom what they needed those things for. They lived on a part of the the coast that looked over an impossibly beautiful expanse of ocean. That should have been enough.
My boy was making progress in other areas. He would now reach for something if I held it out for him (or put it within his reach) and he smiled at John as readily as he smiled at me. John had become as familiar to him as I was.
“And Doctor Watson, you understand that if I grant this order, you will be, in the eyes of the law, Albion’s legal parent?”
The picture on the postcard was of a nondescript building that was apparently a pub in the centre of Melbourne. It appears Dr Watson enjoyed the local beer there. I studied the pen strokes carefully but there was still no sign that he was coming home.
“Well, they talked to the postman, and one of the police reports said the neighbours didn’t see anything.” John is flicking back and forth through the yellowed pages, looking for anything that might help them now. “We need to talk to the mother. How do you find these people anyway?” John thinks they should go to the original address, at 17 Beecher St in Enfield.
To make that happen, Sherlock had no choice but to risk everything again and take a different terrifying leap. It would sacrifice all his dignity and quite possibly their friendship, but it would set John free. That, Sherlock knew, was the best he could do for his best friend.
He smiled! He had no teeth and his hair wouldn’t sit down no matter how much I smoothed it and he smelt funny and it was still the most glorious thing I could have imagined.
That night at dinner, Sherlock waxes lyrical about his sister to his parents. He tells the story of the daring girl pirate who allowed he and Redbeard to join her fantastic boat, and how Mycroft was made walk the plank three times before she decided to spare him.
Lestrade looks impressed, Sherlock is delighted. A conductor of light with a gun! He's about to say something when a blast of chiming music echoes from the end of the house.
That’s not right, John thought as he rushed out the door. Sherlock should have objected. No matter, he reasoned as he raced down to Soho, where he and Fiona would start at a pub and move on to a mediocre Chinese restaurant. He’s bound to bombard me with texts all night. He’ll probably call me within the hour and insist I come home to find his phone charger.
John stands tall and confident, staring straight into Sherlock’s eyes as he lays his hands on his shoulders. “Thank you. I know what you mean. I don’t like it either. I want it to be like it was, and it seems like we can’t do that.”
Sherlock studies the business card as he walks slowly in the other direction, wondering what a miracle might feel like.
He's making it more pleasant for me to kiss him. He asked Renzo for the beer especially. He planned this back at the restaurant. He planned for this. I'm not a impulse purchase. He planned to go down on me. He planned to be with me and to taste nice for me.
Soon we will walk in the sparkling air, down the scrappy little paths towards the minor cliffs where the colours change every minute. They will hold hands or link arms and complain that I that I can’t keep up because I had no breakfast – you should have taken more!
Sherlock, gently scraping small pieces of gum from a tile of glass, hears this and listens more closely despite himself.
Ademar tips his handsome head slightly to the left and Sherlock sees a small whisper of pity in his eyes. “No, not completely. But I can I help you work with it, and I can help you manage it so you don’t risk ruining your friendship with your flatmate. Do you feel comfortable telling me his name?”
"Lie down," Sherlock says and his voice is beautiful, liquid and warm like butter and sugar when they meet over heat and turn to caramel. John settles in the soft fabrics, his lips parted slightly, closing his eyes at the thought of Sherlock's good hand setting him to rights.
Annette, part showgirl, part temptress and fulltime microbiologist, sparkles like cut crystal. Sherlock finds himself looking at the largely uncovered expanse of her breasts, wondering where the scars are.
“Yes. But in his defence, he was reading Camus while his pubescent schoolmates were marveling over their pubic hair. Shut up. Now the Prince followed the grad student” -
“Sherlock!” she said in her strangely uninvolved way. “Look at you in hospital! You look like you’ve been eating!”
Tummy time was one of the first educational activities Albion and I enjoyed together. I had been looking forward to it for some weeks, starting with a few minutes here and there of laying him on his back. Today we were going to work towards sitting up.
I had a completely different life. I had Albion, and we had John, smiling down at us, waiting with a bottle to ward off any threats.
“No!” The thought is appalling. “No, but thanks for the thoughtfulness. Doctor Watson and I are just good friends.”
She made a few cursory marks on the file, and then looked up to record her decision. “I am granting a parental order to Doctor John Watson, who will, from this moment, be recognised as Albion’s parent in accordance with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Parental Orders) Regulations 2010. Adrienne, this means you are recognised as Albion’s biological mother but you can have no say in his upbringing and are unlikely to be recognised in a court of law in Great Britain as having rights of a parent unless some aspect of Albion’s care is in jeopardy. To have this order overturned is extremely difficult. Do you understand?”
There I could get high as much as I liked, and to what ever extent I liked. I took full advantage of those exciting opportunities.
Rosie sees a small dog who looks at the men and growls slightly. She cuddles closer to her father, and watches it carefully.
Albion listened with a mixture of bewilderment and satisfaction. When I finished he sucked his fist, blinked twice and made that flat little wail he uses to let me know he’s going to start crying in earnest if one of us didn’t pick him up quickly.
Privately they both wait to learn that their rash co-habitation has been an awful mistake but to their surprise that never eventuates. They are dissimilar in many way and near identical in others. They agree on a lot of important things and come close to blow on other topics. They enjoy unpacking their sex life and learn a lot from the other under (and on top) the sheets and assorted furniture.
“Yes, of course there’s National Bee Unit. Bees are an intrinsically important part of the food chain and ecology. The Bee Unit did an enormous amount of research centred around insecticides so the Prince did some very basic analysis work.”
She shook her head, eyes on the prize the whole time. “Babies need constant attention, and they’re totally unpredictable. You’re at your best when you have your attention engaged constantly. A baby is the perfect foil for you.”
John and Shona crept clumsily through her dark house, past the shut door of her flat mate's room, past the half opened door of her other flat mate who must have stayed somewhere else tonight, into Shona's room where, when she switched on the light, John wished he was anywhere but.
John spends the night wondering why he proposed marriage again. The first time was a disaster. He tries to imagine every thing that could go wrong in this marriage and foresees years of crimes, fear, danger, violent criminals, odd smells from unidentified chemicals, poetry taped to the front door, genetically modified rabbits, more criminals, fires, lots of laughter, hot sweaty sex, more danger and endless cups of tea.
“Hello Sherlock! Molly tells me you had a baby. Noisy little buggers, aren’t they? Funny I should you see you today. I‘ve just got a postcard from our friend Dr Watson. Would you like to have a look?”
“Every one did, especially the idiot Prince. The evil Prince heard the knocking in the idiot Prince’s chest and worked out what it was.”
But no one came. Had I not been so mesmerised by my son, I would have worked out almost immediately what was going on.
Rudy observes the faces of each child – Sherlock is red eyed but trying hard to be supportive, Eurus is thrilled, and Mycroft is politely bored. The good uncle, who has thus helped avoid more disasters than anyone could imagine, is satisfied. He smiles at the children. “I understand they have a marvellous gift store that provides all their products.”
Late that night, after Rosie has eaten a good dinner, enjoyed a bath with her two plastic boats, heard four stories, and enjoyed some interesting conversation with John and Sherlock as she dropped off to sleep,  they set to work examining the plans.
Sherlock pointedly would not reveal anything to Mycroft about his relationship with Dr Watson. John would only ever say that he really wasn't sure. Still, Mycroft wished them well and hoped for Sherlock's sake that the Doctor was as loyal and sensible as he appeared. He had no illusions that John entered into their financial agreements wholly sponsored by Sherlock; he kept the payments up for three months to help them establish a little nest egg and enjoy a few treats.
“Ms Bannister, I must apologise for my rudeness when you called the other day. I am sorry to have disregarded your inquiry. Please forgive me.”
I’d hope Lestrade’s failure to keep up would mark the end of the day’s lunacy, but I’m never so lucky. On the plus side, I noted John Watson was brimming with baby confidence.
On the day of their six-month anniversary, Billy Kinkaid, who had exhausted the elasticity of the British legal system and was facing a thirty year stretch, blagged his way into the prison infirmary.
“What kind of things do you do together?” our Doctor asked. He seemed to be asking for himself and I was thrilled to be able to fill him in.
The next day, John carries his poem in his breast pocket. He reads it once on the tube and twice at his desk in between patients. He’s not a man for gushing, romantic gestures any more than Sherlock, and he’d never had cause to wonder what it might be like to be the topic of a verse.
I loved how my baby felt on my shoulder, a tiny soft parcel that weighed about the same as three apples.
Sherlock would never admit it, but he was actually looking forward to the Rugby, mostly because he could watch John in an environment he had never seen him, but also because there would be hot chips, which were for Sherlock, who had eaten a surprising variety of hot greasy food all over the world, the greatest form of nourishment available to mankind.
The house is like the others Sherlock had visited. It's abandoned and clearly served as shelter for lots of groups of disaffected people. John can see graffiti sprayed over graffiti, empty fast food packaging, various dirt encrusted spoons and syringes, the occasional shoe, a couple of grubby unidentifiable garments, random pieces of newspaper and there, at the end of what had once been a hall, a tallish man with kind dark eyes wearing a disposable suit and holding a lamp.
“Did what? Put my phone here? I did, I suppose, unless you’ve taken it upon yourself to putting it in obvious places. If you did, thank you.” Sherlock held his phone up and smiled merrily, only to stop short when he saw John’s face. “What? What have I done now?”
It wasn't that she told him that brainy was the new sexy because he'd known that for years and in every case had cause to capitalise on that very fact to varying extents of appreciation.
We had a brief, wordless tussle as we looked for our pants, inadvertently put on each other’s pants  and crept out to the kitchen where Mrs Watson
It’s marvelous, just like John would do for him. Before Sherlock can structure his fantasy his pelvis is pushing outwards, his eyes jammed shut when he feels his balls being cupped and very lightly rolled while Ademar sucks him with perfect rhythm.
Sherlock walks around the victim while he snaps latex gloves over his hands, stopping at the victim’s head to carefully lift it from a heavy pool of congealed blood. John crouches down next to him.
“Well,” my brother asked with just a touch of impatience that only I could deduce, “Are you angry? Terrified? Agitated because taking a six month old infant to a crime scene was frankly a moronic idea?”
He struggles to come up with something that will sustain his interest, any image or thought that might assist in making this unlikely congress satisfying. He gets pictures from random porn he has watched, a clear image of the girl in accounts with the yellow dress that is a little loose around the waist, a zap of faces with wet mouths and fake tans from other porn films and then unexpected shot of lightning when he sees Paul the courier in his navy blue shirt smiling and the lines of his biceps and the soft sandpaper glint of the parts of his face where his beard has been scraped clear with a razor and God, oh God –
“They might have done shit investigations, but the coppers certainly win some points for staying in touch,” he remarks.
Since that night of special deductions, Sherlock decided he only had to exercise his remarkable self control and one day John would come to him, spinning around to point with an outstretched arm to proclaim it was always him, Sherlock Holmes.
He is confident in his stride but a tiny bit anxious. He wants John to see him at his best but knows he has few allies here.
Albion stretched his arms out so I’d lift him up to rest under my chin. I was his number one choice for cuddles, entertainment and personal hygiene. He took that care and protection as read and I’d been unable to provide it. John Watson, though, had been able to step for me without hesitation.
“You’re a strong little bloke, aren’t you? I’m just going to have a quick feel here, under your chin.”  He took Albion’s pulse and nodded as he carefully ran his fingers over the unblemished surface of his arms.
In all, Albion had six Watson fingertips of plums. It’s possible he might have eaten more if his idiot father had thought to use the baby bowl and spoon he’d bought months before.
Sherlock, meanwhile, desperate for a case, takes refuge on the Internet where he reads an article on a true crime website and finds an anomaly no one has considered. He then spends hours tangled in a myriad of hostile conversations with Mike Stamford, Detective Inspector Lestrade and the long suffering Mycroft.
Mr and Mrs Holmes’ painful, passive aggressive disapproval melted before Albion. My mother clasped her hands together and my father took him off me immediately.
The boxes look untidy. "It doesn't matter," he tells himself but deep down it does, because no soldier's boxes should look untidy. John unpacks the lot and re-packs, pushing and folding different items until every thing is neat, every thing fits.
"Ah, good," says John, and folds it into a long thick pad that will have to do until they can get some proper gauze. He presses it carefully along the cut, takes the stranger's hand and positions it carefully to hold it in place.
They sit on the bed like chastised children. John reaches out and strokes a few wandering curls from Sherlock’s forehead, watches the strands settle softly into place and then trails his hand along Sherlock’s face, moving in to kiss him, drawing his lips down to his own.
“I have no idea. I like some men, and I like some women, and occasionally find myself attracted to a small percentage of both.”
Lestrade holds the lamp high and spotlights a young woman in a pool of blood. John looks away with a heavy heart.
John is endlessly grateful to Sherlock everything that happens to them every day - for his unrelenting pursuit of danger, his phenomenal mind, his ferocious intelligence and the delectable little streaks of tenderness that make themselves known when John least expects it.
John looked up when I walked in and Anya, obviously a brilliant military tactician, took her chance and flopped his arm flat against the table.
His nightmares embarrass him. It’s the only time he is out of control and genuinely frightened. In a strange way I feel very privileged that he trusts me to witness this weakness.
The curtain swings back and it's the nurse, pushing a trolley filled with an assortment of gauzes, tapes, canulas and fearsome steel implements. John gives her a bright smile. "Thanks for that!"
“So the Woodsman killed the boar and cut out its heart which would have involved a sternectomy – you know, when you actually saw open the breastbone – and then he would have had to cut though the arteries to release the heart. It would have taken him fifteen minutes, at least. Twenty if it was dark.
Sherlock pretends to think for a moment. “No,” he says with dramatic emphasis, and Molly and Greg exchange amused glances.  John watches briefly, wondering what they would be like as a couple. Sherlock breaks his reverie.
When the kiss eases he lets his lips linger a millimeter from John’s, helpless as the breathtaking landscape of their proposed intimacy starts to open to him.
The hospital recorded me as the baby’s father, and Adrienne Portelli (whoever she was) as his mother.
John watches his bare backside, not quite covered by his shirt, with a mix of quiet admiration and rough lust.
Sherlock, meanwhile, is trying to weigh the disembodied head Molly found for him. It's not as easy as he thought.
“Do you still wet the bed? Because you did for a long time, didn’t you, two or three years after your parents were divorced. But you have a new stepfather now – and a new sibling! No, actually, TWO new siblings! Must be pretty crowded for you at home. Mmm. Hard to get mum’s attention, and your stepfather would naturally prefer the new additions to the family. And of course don’t see your biological father anymore. Otherwise why would you spend so much time and energy tormenting a bright boy who has a father who clearly dotes on him?”
“I might,” although it was as plain as the noses on our faces that John Watson was desperate to talk military things with Anya. “Does she come today?”
I made a mental note to include the Detective Inspector on my Christmas card list, if I ever actually write one or indeed decide to send any cards.
“It’s called Branwen’s Feather,” John tells Sherlock as he applies the varnish in careful strokes.  “And it’s English. You can’t be wearing any of that suspect French stuff.”
John smiles as Sherlock prattles on about the difficulty encountered by urban birds in harvesting good quality mud. Once again he is reminded of the endless facets of Sherlock’s remarkable mind, and the thousands of colours that shine from it with his every thought.
“Her sister says she’s an addict who stayed with her while she was pregnant, disappeared for four days,  and then returned home not pregnant three weeks ago, claiming to have sold the baby to a dentist and his wife in Brighton. Then she disappeared again.”
Easy for me to say. Albion was not enjoying tummy time yet, and started some low grade grizzling to persuade me to lay him back in the comfortable position.
They were interrupted by a tall man in very loose jeans and an especially vibrant lime coloured shirt who extended his long bony hand to John. It was not pleasant to touch.
John and Sherlock, neither of whom have ever had anyone in their life quite like the other, don't keep track of how long they have been in a relationship. After a couple of months each finds it hard to remember when they weren't a couple.
"Well, sort of, but mostly people who you have to represent have really bad energy. I mean, I just couldn't handle all these people who just deliberately break the law."
“See how loved you were? We all adored you from the very start. And you were so smart! We knew almost immediately how clever you were.” Mummy takes a deep breath. “But I didn’t know that you were unnaturally smart and so emotionally cogniscent. There is no way I could have known, but if I did, I wouldn’t never had left your side. I am sorry that I didn’t know, but I know now, and I want you to know that I love you very, very much, that you are my best girl, and that I will always be your biggest advocate, and most devoted supporter. Do you understand that?”
John breathes deeply and relaxes. The slow strokes continue while Sherlock nuzzles his face, gently bites his earlobe, rubs his lips over the gold bristles on John's cheek.
He waits for Lestrade to leave before grabbing John ecstatically. "What a day! Mummy visits, brings cake, doesn't invite Mycroft and then there's an unsolved quadruple homicide with the evidence all preserved in a wall! It's things like this that remind me how much I love you! Grab your coat."
Albion was determined not to be left out of this important decision and squawked loudly at both of us.
"I only have a sister and I haven't seen her since I got back." John snicks the tail on the fourth stitch and leans back to inspect his handiwork. "Probably another three. How am I doing for time?"
She hears only the correct statement, puts her other bags on the floor and crouches down next to them. "Here, get out the way, both of you, let me have a go."
We shared a meaningful look until it became a little weird and then he slapped me gently on the left buttock to change the subject. “I’ve got to go and see Harry tomorrow.”
(“You’ve upset the baby” become a running joke for us, and was privately celebrated by me because we had never had a running joke before. This one was especially good because we got to use it in a dozen different contexts every day, because it seemed Albion was upset by just about anything.)
Lestrade sniggers as he eats his sandwich (roast lamb and salad on thick white bread, no butter but lots of mustard) and continues.
Angelo’s was their place. It’s where they went after the hardest cases, or the most frustrating cases, or when they felt like a hot meal and some pieces of the best garlic bread in London.
John was excited. I could feel it. “But hang on,” he said, “ Wouldn’t I have to sign as the person  - you know, the new parent?”
I could feel John’s intense curiosity about the whole crack house affair rising in him like a tide. I didn’t want it to take on any artificial importance.
They’re both very relieved when Mrs Hudson shows Detective Inspector Lestrade in into the flat. She stops short when she sees the flashes of dark blue.
But it isn't. His misery seems to be rising, a horrible cold current of ill will and black skies and a promise that nothing will ever be good again.
While they wash up, John asks some clumsy questions, trying to confirm that Sherlock has deleted Ademar Sterling. Sherlock deliberately antagonizes John by talking at cross purposes. It might have ended in a raging fight for other couples; John and Sherlock end up laughing so hard they are, for a few moments, unable to speak at all.
Sherlock is relieved when John announces, without looking at him, that he will go to his flat and collect some clothes for him and Rosie so they can stay a few days.
I waited until Saturday morning, when I had Albion to myself. I dressed him in one of his John Watson outfits because it was a special occasion, and also because he looked delightful in a striped t-shirt. I enjoyed  putting a t-shirt on him and fastening the tiny snaps on his shoulders. His little arms are like dough when I thread them through the sleeves.
“You’d know better than anyone that sociopaths have no capacity to fall in love,” Eddie said gently.
The first guest came in and nodded at Ms Briggs. I’m not sure I have ever been so glad to see anyone.
John looks up and smiles. "Can you talk while I'm doing this? I need to get this patient stitched quickly."
"If I had any idea I wouldn't be here drinking this coffee-stained milk drink." He reaches over and tosses the cup into the large bin. "Good to see you again, Bob. Give my love to your family."
It made more sense not to deal with either. I waited until I could walk with relative ease and made my way to an especially intriguing house in Haggerston.
Albion was looking at Doctor Watson very carefully. He’d never seen a man with a beard before. “Ooo a,” he said to the doctor, and then to me, “Ooo a oo,” which I’m pretty sure was a firm appreciation of John Watson’s personal style.
Mrs Hudson, who has lived a much more wild, and much more unpredictable life than even Sherlock can guess, is neither surprised or curious. She is happy there is another lodger in the house, and happy that Sherlock has company. That they make a bit of noise sometimes, or come and go noisily at all hours of the day and night, holds little interest for her.
But one disappointment can be the harbinger for some excellent fortune, and Lestrade passes the glazier on the stairs.
I only saw her during the day; I have no idea what she did outside seven hours she spent with us. That said, I note that she grew quite chummy with Mrs Hudson, and often heard peals of laughter wafting up from Mrs Hudson’s flat in the evening. Their shared hilarity was curious. I wondered what entertained them, because Anya and I were not able to make each other laugh.
To alleviate the stress, John creates scenarios where he treats the wounds himself. He imagines making a poultice, cleaning the grit from each stripe of shattered skin, preparing bandages and devising a plan for pain management so that the wounds would heal quickly and with minimum discomfort.
I knelt down before the doctor, navigating a place for myself amongst the nappy bag, the creams and a small pile of unwashed baby clothes.
“I see you’ve met Annette!” John is wearing a dark suit and Sherlock can see the tiny soft ridges in his fair hair where the comb has been. Once again he smells of the Serge Luten cologne and Sherlock fancies that the rich scent shimmers in the low light of the flat.
"Sit still," he tells the head for the fourth time as it rolls across the table. The half closed eyes are cloudy and downward cast and its heavy lips are gaping slightly. The tongue is pushed back well behind the teeth; Sherlock wonders if Molly perhaps pinned it in place. He stops and thinks about that for a few seconds, forgets the scales and starts fossicking in the cold mouth with careful fingers.
The adrenalin is subsiding and the stranger can feel the first streaks of pain as the cold air hits the open wound and everywhere else - he's scraped his hand, knocked his elbow a little and bumped his knee. He lets John hold his face with careful fingers and look closely at the cut.
Sherlock puts the phone on speaker and the three of them huddle around. The person who answers has a voice webbed with contempt and phlegm.
This struck Anya as highly suspicious and she didn’t answer. She and John shared some low grade semi-hostile staring out.
“Well, we’ve got an archive of the investigation briefs. I don’t know how substantial they all are, but there’s no reason you can’t see them, if you think you can close one. Remind me about it  when his Lordship’s finished outsmarting us all and I’ll give you the number.”
I wondered if John liked the idea of re-attempting fatherhood, but he can be very prickly about topics close to his heart. We were getting on so nicely I decided to let it pass.
The first time Mycroft didn’t save me was when the drug house in Haggerson was raided and I was arrested. Certainly he came to bail me out, but he was too late because the wound was infected and I had collapsed in the cell.
"I've had them rushed through. The electronics boffin compiling them said he have the first two victims completed by tomorrow."
“What? I wouldn’t really ask you to do that. I’m just trying to encourage him to … do what ever Molly wants him to do.”
Sherlock launches back in to the preposterous character he becomes when he's passing himself off as Lestrade.
The men move out of the way and look at each other with half smirks that dissipate very quickly when the phone slides out in seconds.
He made his way to the couch and sat with us. Albion stopped crying momentarily to see if John might do something interesting.
We are, despite my indignant protestations, not dissimilar to every other young family in London. We juggle out family with our jobs. The chaos of lost socks and breakfast and sibling spats is soothed only by John’s common sense and Anya’s unerring service as a splendid nanny. John and I still take cases; he still works at the hospital three days a week, and we both work hard to ensure that our weekends are our time with each other and with our children.
When he gets to work at 9am, Lestrade reads the emails and reopens the file on Mariah Best. He then puts a call through to Police Liaison, and asks that they contact the child’s mother now, and tell her police will a visit this afternoon.
Not long after Mariah’s funeral, Dad and Sherlock went to see Mrs Best, and explained Sherlock’s deductions, and gave her the gift  of acceptance, or at least led her closer to it. That I remember well, because there were photos everywhere of the little girl. She was pretty.
She started work at about 9am every morning, after Albion and I had discussed the day’s plans over breakfast. While he slept she did whatever housework needed doing, and I would let her go at 4pm every day. I didn’t want to be one of those bosses you read about in the Daily Mail who treat their staff badly.
“I know he wasn’t,” she says immediately. “Robert was many things, but he would not, did not, hurt Mariah.”
“I’m not happy about leaving you alone while you’re like this,” John said the next morning before he left for work.
John shakes his head. “No. I’m just – you astonish me sometimes.” He wipes one eye with the back of his hand.
When Molly saws open the skull, they can see a blood mass there still, powdery and brown, but perfectly preserved against shrivelled brain matter.
The few seconds that pass are confused; Sherlock hopes against hope that John will acquiesce. Then I can fix it. I can make it better for him too. For a moment he fears that John will storm back down the corridor and back to the street where Sherlock may never see him again but when John lifts his face, it appears he lets the pain anesthetise him. His eyes and voice are flat.
“No, “ she answers. “She knew not to do that. The police think that she was grabbed, which is why she lost her shoe.” Her voice creaks slightly, for  it is at that point that the stiff structure becomes dark and hard to see.
After I’d looked at the crime scene (the man they wanted had been a customer before, needed money urgently (probably a bad debt), was acquainted with the victim and did not mean to kill her), I was approached by a number of police officers I knew by sight, all of whom wanted to see pictures of my baby.
“How could I miss a fake pregnancy? Why did I choose her? Why did you have to jump in the first place?” he asked repeatedly.
“No. He has an excellent appetite and seems very amenable to try new foods. I hesitate to give him commercial foods because I’m not sure what’s in them. I’ll analyze them first and if I’m satisfied that there are no colours or synthetic flavours, then he can eat those occasionally.”
Up until now, all four suspects had been under close surveillance but no one – not even Sherlock – had guessed where they were squirreling the money they were stealing. Now, early morning and one man dead, every aspect of everything Sherlock knows about this crime is folding rapidly through his mind. He is very excited.
Albion slept soundly, but thinking about happily ever after actually kept me awake until the next feed.
It arrived the day before Mummy left. Ludwig watched it, and thought it would be very beneficial for Eurus to have access to this material.
He takes a deep breath. “I wouldn’t ask ordinarily, but I’m desperate, John. I need your help at Bart’s.”
I got to wear scrubs, which reminded me of John. He once showed me a picture of himself wearing scrubs and I was reminded again that I was an idiot not to steal it.
John Watson has a special smile he uses when he is about to maim or kill you. It looks like an ordinary closed lipped smile, and can be mistaken as quite friendly until you see his eyes, which will be filled with mayhem and lethal conviction.
It actually doesn’t matter. I just love him, and it turns out I have for years,  but Three (soon to be six) Continents Watson has no capacity to deal with my love.
“As far as I’m aware, it was his idea, initially. Until he got concerned that she was getting too involved with me, and that I was becoming too attached”  – John’s voice split a little here – “too attached to Ollie. He asked her to leave me and run away with him again, but she refused. They had a huge fight about it. Then he blew the whistle on her.”
I took notes about the way he reacted to burping and how long it took him to get to sleep. Then I took notes about how frequently he moved in his sleep. (He moved his little fists a lot, which I am certain he gets from me, because I gesticulate frequently, especially when I am explaining things.)
“I couldn’t say for certain, but based on the evidence available to me, yes, I think he must be. Or at least he thinks he must be. It’s so hard to tell.” Sherlock is looking at Ademar’s bookcase. It’s been dusted and the books are in a different order. He casually goes through the list of scenarios that might have led to the bookcases being cleaned and re-stacked. He deduces it must have tipped over in the throes of some especially energetic client service.
Jeremy has just turned 16. He appears, to John, to be all bones, a tall spare lad with straight brown hair and sad blue eyes. He is clean, neatly dressed and very nervous of the police and especially of Sherlock.
This was, of course, Albion’s first experiment with human food, and the result couldn’t have been better than if I’d rigged it. After his first ever experience of real flavour, my baby bounced up and down and waved his little cocktail frankfurt arms in complete joy.
John considered this. It seemed implausible, but, he decided, bound to happen sometimes. “Right. See you in the morning.”
He has spent the last couple of weeks trawling internet sites, looking for a place where he might live in relative contentment with people he doesn't want to kill.
It is a source of grief to me that Molly harbours hopes that I may some day turn out to be normal and court her in an appropriate fashion. Of course I am more likely to grow sentimental before that happens but I don’t know how to tell her that so I kept the visit focused largely on the indolent Toby.
Standing in the boat is Eurus, pointing her own plastic cutlass to the horizon, and yelling various threats at Mycroft as he drags the boat.
It was clear that Mrs Hudson and Anya had been sharing a number of secrets because they both smirked when they met in our lounge room. Mycroft was setting Albion in his pram, John was being ridiculous with his staring and Lestrade looked like he had been locked in a monkey’s cage.
The tension in his body is fascinating. Sherlock strokes it, feels it clamping all John's muscles, weaving tight lines across the powerful muscles on his shoulder, forming a hard wall on his stomach, flickering through his hand as a tremor.
One case dated back to 1970 – a thirty eight year old man  found in his bedsit with a bludgeoned head. They’d never recovered the weapon; forensic reports seemed to indicated a cricket bat. The crime scene photos showed him fully dressed, laying face down beside his miserable single bed that was neatly made. The witness statements were scarce, just a couple of colleagues who were able to provide scant details – that he worked at the post office and liked to go to the cinema.
“I saw them this morning. Where did you get them all?” John has an endearing vision of Sherlock charming feathers from the pigeons in St James Park.
“Certainly. It is as your brother has told me. I have been instructed to ignore everything you say regarding my employment here. Now I will gather the washing and restore straightness to the apartment.”
He wants to answer I don't, I was just on my way to commit suicide and he got hit by a scooter in front of me, but instead John shrugs his shoulders. The world's changed a lot in the last couple of hours and he's still surging with adrenaline.
“No Sherlock, it’s not. What is fun for you is getting it right –because you no doubt have deduced what I want - after you have harassed me with an endless array of international dishes that I would never eat in a thousand years. ”
I had Albion to myself for three blissful days. He was the smartest baby I have ever met. I made pages of notes.
Sherlock closes that file in his mind palace. A few others lay scattered around the floor and snag his attention.
John holds out one hand to placate his friend or maybe to just steady himself. “No, I didn’t – Sherlock, no. No. I’m not judging you. Not at all. I’m just curious to hear – well, you’ve never displayed any interest in relationships at all. Now you’ve got painted toenails and straight boy pain. And who is this Ademar exactly? What is he telling you?”
“You’re right, as usual, my love. Now I want to tell you about what some of the doctors have said, and I want to show you something.”
I explained the Adrienne situation to the best of my knowledge. “Lestrade will be tracking her down as I speak. He thinks I stole him.”
“Detective Inspector. Lovely to see you. Mrs Hudson, thank you again for assisting guests’ passage to my rooms. Mycroft, your country needs you. Anya, have a lovely walk. Albion, I adore you. Behave yourself on your walk, don’t swear at policemen and be prepared to tell me everything you see in the park when you return. John, you won this morning’s eyeballing contest. Now. Lestrade. Tell me why you’re here.”
Back home, John is slumped over the table, nursing a cup of tea and staring at twenty eight feathers lined up from shortest to longest. Just trying to work out why Sherlock needed twenty eight feathers fills him with love. Every senseless thing about Sherlock makes him feel this way.
And by the end of the month, John Watson had been interviewed for the role of Clinical Lecturer (Level 3, Part Time, position Number Kx77493022).
Sherlock is well aware that Billy has had a number of special friends of his own over the years. That Billy might make that assumption is not unexpected.
I set about filling the kettle and making tea while wondering if John would like me to yell while we sexed. I’d seen that once on the internet – a man whose criminal activities I had been investigating posted videos of himself and his expensively reconstructed partner having sex. They both yelled, like one might if they were trying to carry on a conversation with the other in a room on the other side of the house. It was interesting and preposterous.
John would remember the next few minutes for the rest of his life, the first time he saw Sherlock Holmes in action, as if someone clicked on him and downloaded an entire file that by rights should have taken weeks to compile.
"Just finished here, doctor," the nurse says as she hands John a thin file. "Patient has been hit by a scooter, has a bad cut on his head and says he has chest pains."
“No. That was the start of the Prince understanding how woeful the police are at gathering evidence and solving crimes. But it was the start of the Prince learning how to be a consulting detective.”
John thinks for a second. "Yes." and then he remembers something that all partners do when their mate is in trouble. "Is he going to be alright?"
“Is that for my benefit or for his?” I asked as I drew my knees up and rested Albion against them. He had calmed down now we were home and was looking at me, smiling and cooing.
“He used to check on you first thing every morning. Hs said you were so beautiful that you might sprout butterfly wings and fly away, so he’d come in every morning to see you were still here.”
Apparently John Watson walked to the volcano there the day before. I longed to be at the heaving smoke-belching stoma with him.
“Did you like the bloke next door?” I’m ashamed to say I felt a temporary pang of jealousy of the Watsons’ neighbour and possibly the junior Watson’s cat.
“Yes. He’s ice cold and not moving and all brain activity seems to have ceased. That’s a fair assessment.”
Adrienne shook her head. “I’m stupid. I can’t do anything. I was stupid at school and I was rubbish at Superdrug. And then I had a baby and he was so happy. Look at them.” She jerked her head at John at me. “I saw this thing in Glamour about this girl who had a baby for her cousin, and I thought, I may as well see if I can do it for other people, and then I saw this thing on Craigslist so I went to New York. And, well, I just want to have babies for people who can’t. I may as well. And it’s good, you know? I don’t want a baby but the New York people sent me to one of them gynothingies and he said I was fertile and real healthy and could have a dozen babies. So I’m going to.” She looked around the room, as if there was no one there. “It’s good, you know? I’ve never done anything important.”
Hugging John Watson was different. He hugs very well. I didn’t want it to stop. He smells like fresh things you find outdoors, and his scent intensifies around his hairline and, I was certain, under his shirt, when I could raise the necessary nerve to open it.
“What kinds of things were thinking?” I asked her. Albion’s diet was of enormous interest to me - I’d prepared a spreadsheet in anticipation of this happy day. It had been my initial plan to feed my son bland dairy foods first, and then introduce foods to him according to their colours.
He started loosening her blouse anyway and she responded by pulling at his shirt, but they were both so drunk that it ended up being easier to undress themselves which they did with a sort of bravado that gradually built to an increasing shyness and eventually a thwarted shame. She reached over to flick off the light but he filled with the shapeless terror and said as calmly as he could, no, no need, let's leave it on.
"I'm sorry your excellent stitches prevent my from returning the pleasure you gave me, but I hope this is just as good." John watches with cautious eyes as Sherlock pours the lubricant over his fingers and glazes his cock with it. It hits home hard, John sucks in his breath and his pelvis bucks instinctively.
The judge looked at his both like we were crazy people. I made up my mind then to come back with Albion when he was reading Moliere in a couple of years’ time and illustrate the value of my plan.
“What? I’ve only just got started. What? Why are you all glaring at me? If he’s old enough to wander around a football stadium abusing people, he’s old enough to be deduced. So are you,” he says to the two friends who are looking nervously around them, trying to find the quickest escape route.
Then John, apparently a simple man but in truth full of surprises and common sense, takes one of the beers and cracks it open sharply before taking a good swig.
Mostly though, if I am honest,  the main reason I stayed was because I missed John horribly, and I thought that if I could convince everyone I was well enough, I could pack up and walk around the world and try and catch up with him.
Our views were not dissimilar. I wanted Albion to try as broad a range of foods of possible, and was certain that if I could puree it, Albion could eat it. My spreadsheet reflected this.
Lestrade turns up when the autopsy is finished, and Molly is sewing the incisions shut. Sherlock and John have left not ten minutes ago.
"A kilo of snow. Tonight. I'll be waiting for you in at 114 Bridge Road in Shepherd's Bush. You know it?"
“Because his mother and father went there and he was too bigger idiot to break out on his own. So he went to Cambridge and continued the patterns he had established as child – no friends and being an insufferable swot who got all his assignments in on time. No wonder all the kids hated him.”
John keeps writing, and looks up when she pauses. Jenny closes her eyes, then says quietly, “I had a dream.”
Then I took out my magnifying glass and went over his entire little face and committed it all to memory.
“The only thing she’s in is a crack house. She’s an addict, Mycroft. She knows where I am and she knows I have Albion here. She saw me buying furniture for him. She can come back whenever she likes.”
He kisses him again, and Sherlock, a little more focused now, concentrates on all the clues and surprises in the Doctor's mouth. Sherlock has theories about mouths and their flavours, having tasted so many people who have for one reason or another turned out to be very bad ideas indeed. There have been men with sour mouths whose genitals tasted of cheese, women with bitter mouths who tasted of slightly over ripe fruit, men and women who tasted metallic and set his teeth on edge. No one tasted right but John does. He tastes warm and his flavour fills Sherlock, the same way chlorophyll saturates your palette when you snap a sapling.
"So what's he doing with anyone at all? Has anyone told Watkins or whatever his name is what Holmes is actually like?"
John's not certain what he was expecting from Sherlock's flat but once inside it was impossible to imagine him living anywhere else. It's been so long since John has been anywhere welcoming and comfortable. He looks around at the coloured wallpaper, the fireplace, the skull on the mantelpiece and the comfortable chairs and feels real covertness in his heart. It's a lovely place to live, charming and rustic but eminently practical, dependable and eccentric like a proper English gentleman's home should be.
Minutes later Lestrade and Donovan burst into the room as if the future of the free world is threatened. Sherlock rolls his eyes and is about to leave them to it but there is a clatter of furniture and the dull thud of a lifeless weight hitting the floor.
It is fruitless. There is nothing, just the tedium of an ugly building in between purposes. The homicide detectives stand and talk, the dog sits at their feet, Greg and Sherlock start to concede quietly that this was all in vain, and John – well, John circles the pagoda.
“Sherlock! It’s been so long!” Angelo called to me as we walked into his restaurant. “And John! And oh my God, who’s this?”
Mycroft obviously wrote the brochure for that one. Meanwhile Mrs Hudson had a slightly different view.
This was discovered after she was tracked down by Interpol, who sought her arrest for twenty four murders on behalf of three separate governments.
Small warm ripples run over the bed; he feels Sherlock’s arms winding around his shoulders. Before Sherlock can say anything, John closes his eyes and speaks softly.
“Does that still happen? Are couriers still a thing?” John asked the receptionist when she brought the letter to his office.
It’s not good enough. “John, are you heterosexual and experimenting, bisexual and describing it in mawkish terms, homosexual and prevaricating or some form of inadequately-researched sexuality that finds it self drawn to me?”
"I like cats." Which, strictly, was true,. He didn't wish them any harm and they didn't make him sneeze.
“Yes. Not with a boat mind, but he worked out that he was able to pillage all the information he wanted from behind the counter. He watched people who came into the shop and took notes about everything. He opened every brand of cigarette and taught himself the difference between the different types of ashes.
He sits next to a man wearing loose jeans, floral sneakers, a white shirt and a very heavy orange jumper that needs some serious laundry. Sherlock knows him as Bob. He doesn't like Bob much, mostly because Bob has some insight into Sherlock that very few people achieve. Still, he is generous with his services, keeps a wide range of interesting merchandise and offers excellent credit options.
The lights in John’s eyes dimmed. “He’s alive. He doesn’t know how lucky he is. I don’t know. I think he turned informant so he could stay with the children.”
"He saved my brother, you know. He was facing a murder charge and Sherlock proved he didn't do it, saved him from a huge prison sentence."
"Under the fridge." He waggles his fingers until Lestrade hands it over, still not looking up. He flicks to the photo of the most recent deceased at the front of the file, looks at the arm and punches a number into the phone, then waits with the phone pressed to his ear.
“I want my family around me tonight.” John made a secure little bridge with two large chairs and rested the basket there.  We curled up together with our son asleep nearby.
“Of course you can discount it,” Sherlock says as he looks around the vast warehouse. “I have solved hundreds of crimes and not one was informed by a ghost.”
He reads each one again as he clips the poems in place, stopping occasionally to hover over a favourite line. It is an extraordinary thrill, to read about yourself from another person’s perspective. John can’t wait for the next one.
"Oh, it's good. It's very good. But much as I like it, you really shouldn't be considering reciprocating while you have those very neat stitches. Especially while they're still fresh."
“You did not.” This new intelligence caused some inward relief. I wasn’t interested to hear anything else, but John Watson, I believe, was a tad obsessed.
It was all unsatisfactory so he sucked up two fat lines and sent small bolts of fire back and forth along his synapses, stayed up all night and early the next morning on the second caseless day went out in his pyjamas for some milk. When he got home he realised there wasn't any tea so he went out again. There were more people out this time and more people stared at him which annoyed him slightly. There is no way to stop people looking at you but they shouldn't. It's bad manners.
“I’m looking forward to the day when we can bring him down here and watch him run to the swings,” John said as we walked through the park.
John pretends to ignore him as he unlocks their door but once inside he walks Sherlock down the hall, loosening his coat and smiling. “I’m Sherlock’s poof,” he says lustily.
“Okay. Dealer’s choice for you too. You get to choose not only how I get you off, but what I’ll call you when you come.”
Sherlock’s heart is heaving. He is excited and nervous and wide eyed at the prospect of some thing completely new, his mouth watering in preparation for their first kiss.
Greg does this, and then comes back to see the little girl. Her skin is dark and leathery, clinging to bones but her hair is still in tact, powdery and dark, combed into dry bunches that are tied with coloured wool. Greg remembers those hair ties.
True to form, Amarita baffled everyone when, in 1968, she eloped with the man least likely, a stern, wild haired young philosophy don whose intellectual gifts were so onerous he walked in a perpetual stoop, apparently weighed down by the heavy burden of his great mind.
“Yes. I truly am. I am the cross you must bear. Now tell me again: What kind of poof are yer?” Sherlock mimics the gruff father perfectly.
Clearly there were many things I didn’t quite grasp about Dr Watson’s marriage. We had a very pleasant spell of staring into one another’s eyes, neither of us quite brave enough to move beyond that.
Rigid in the revelation of John’s apparent heterosexuality, Sherlock feels drained, drained in the same way he has seen an embalmer empty a corpse of blood before filling the frail veins with formaldehyde. He wanders down to his own room, takes off all his clothes, turns off all the lights and slips under the duvet so he can lay in the dark and calculate where he had deduced wrongly and, more importantly, what he should do now.
“She sounds particularly troubled to me, Sherlock, and I want to be certain that she is not in any danger, or in need of medical assistance.”
It changes the energy they have generated. John is reminded of victims of torture he has seen and indeed treated, Sherlock is reminded of an awful time when John was so far from him in many ways.
John smiles. "You really are amazing. Yes and yes. At least, I have a website. I've never written anything on it."
Mycroft read the formula tin while rocking Albion gently. He hated that and yelled at Mycroft for being useless at rocking and at me for providing an idiot uncle.
But not as badly as your hatred of me. Not as badly as having Mary come between us to broker a resolution.
Oh, though Sherlock with hot sticky glee, there’s lots of points. Dozens of them. Enough points to make it pointier than a jousting match.
John and Sherlock are silent, each surveying the street from which Mariah was snatched, looking at the single clue that a random stranger seems to have sheared from her.
John grabs his coat, a little dazed, because it's the first time Sherlock has stated his feelings so clearly.
(Eddie told me that I should become more sentimental. I told him there was more chance that I would produce a Constable in occupational therapy.)
Once the sleeping arrangements had been settled, John and I got down on the yellow rug and had some tummy time of our own. We lay opposite each other with Albion, now on his back, staring at the purple fish.
“Ah, Sherlock,” he said very softly as we started to rock our bodies  gently against one another. I slipped off his shirt, he tugged at my trousers, I slipped my hand down his pants to the perfect gluteus muscles and the secret warmth at the crease, he spread his fingers over my balls and I thought the weight of my heart would crack my chest.
Social services had come to John’s home unannounced and taken his daughter from him. Many of the details of Mrs Watson’s vast deception were relayed to John at that time, including proof that the child was not a Watson. Mrs Watson wasn’t there at the time.
“I can’t use empirical evidence to know what is stupid and what isn’t,”  says Eurus. “Stupid is a matter of opinion.” She examines her finished drawing, puts it aside and takes another piece of paper. “You need to just burn someone to death in a fire,” she adds, and reaches for a scarlet pencil.
Ah, Antonio. Sherlock is still for a moment as he rides a few lovely waves of the Summer, the first piece he was able to play through without error. When it passes, he drums his fingers impatiently on the armrests and wonders if Ademar can squeeze him in tonight. Figuratively and literally.
John and Sherlock are waiting in their seats, and John extends his hand to usher the client in to the empty chair before them.
“They weren’t discernible until recently. In any case, you’re a doctor. You should have been checking.”
"I thought we could go and get your things, " Sherlock says as they sit on the floor together, sipping.
Ms Powers and I stood in my bedroom,  watching while John Watson very carefully lay Albion on my bed and lifted off his little t-shirt.
“It’s important data. You never know when we might be trapped in a dark basement and the only method available to me to identify you will be to measure your ear with my mouth.”
I would have gone looking for her but babies straight off the production line are incredibly time consuming. Apart from actually having to operate his body for him, I wanted to tell Albion as much as I possibly could about everything.  Most of the early childhood specialists agree that we take the most information, that which will form half of what we learn in a lifetime, by the age of two.
Finally there were some noises in her flat and finally she opened the door. She looked at Albion with mild curiousity.
Sherlock watches John’s reflection in the window and sees that beautiful smile superimposed against the bleary shades of London, John’s understanding blooming slowly, first in his eyes, then through all the delicate muscles of his face., shy at first and then stretched out across his face, the illumination that he provides for Sherlock lighting up the space between them.
“It makes a lot of difference if you’re decorating.” John has been married and he knows about decorating. It was, for a few weeks in his life, one of the chief topics of conversations he had with his fiancé.
He had a series of faces to relay different emotions and requirements. A tiny, pouting lip meant he was genuinely sad and wanted me to hold him while simultaneously pacing the floor and telling him something interesting. A small frown met he was about to wail because he wanted his pants changed immediately. Raising his little fists meant he was frustrated and about to cry because I wasn’t holding him and providing him with comforting body warmth. Closed eyes and a still face meant he had just drunk another two hundred millilitres of formula and wanted to sleep, preferably in my arms while I reclined.
“What business are we discussing, my dear brother?” (I was in phenomenal mood, or at least would be for another two minutes, until Mycroft ruined it.) “Be quick, Anya will be here any moment.”
It’s my belief that sex is subversive because you temporarily abandon all your allegiances for a few futile moments of unchallenged pleasure. It was John Watson though who taught me that the real act of rebellion is love making, touching and pleasuring someone only because you love them and to not do that is denying your lover something glorious that you can’t bear them to be denied.
"The rent's a 150 pounds a week and we buy our own groceries. We split the housework, and if you take the room, you've got your own bathroom that you have to keep clean. The last woman here was a slob and it really ruined the energy of the house. "
“William Kinkaid,” John reads aloud from the file in front of him. It’s important he remains neutral with patients until he can assess their illness and whether or not they are a danger to him or themselves. “Take a seat.”
John nods. He was a little indifferent to psoriasis - there are other more compelling cutaneous diseases in his opinion - but by the time they've reached St Barts, Sherlock has more or less converted him.
Lestrade has long given up trying to second guess anything Sherlock does. He assumes John is his partner because it seems unlikely any person would stay with Sherlock casually on a voluntary basis. And sometimes, he sees the way Sherlock will look up at John when he made an especially brilliant deduction. He'll see John smile, genuinely impressed, and he'll see Sherlock swell a little, as if he was actually able to ruffle a spray of feathers.
Then I took a good breath and put my dignity on the line. “Or you can sleep in my room with me and Albion.”
John restores his trousers just enough to guide Sherlock to the couch. He holds his eyes, loosening the expensive clothes while he watches his face.
But the thing I enjoyed most was sending music to John. Mycroft had very kindly delivered my violin after I had been incarcerated for a month and was reported to be progressing.
"Oh you," says a tall beaky looking man with nasty little eyes who's standing at the main doorway. "Should have guessed you'd be here."
John was still trying to smooth Albion’s soft little tufts. They sprung up like dandelions . “You know that one of the other junkies filmed it on their phone.”
More recently, as Mummy continues to travel and the boys can visit less frequently, the family worried that the limited social interaction would cause Papa to atrophy and be unable to say any words at all. Then Mycroft or Sherlock (it depends who you ask) hit on the brilliant idea on getting Papa a text buddy. Thus he spends hours every day involved engrossing conversations on a Galaxy II with a person whose primary job is to keep Papa chatting and preventing his magnificent, inaccessible brain from collapsing in on itself.
He’s all kinds of marine colours, John Watson. His eyes are like the sea at Antibes,  his skin is the colour of the sand in the archipelagos of Malaysia, and his body hair is like stones you might find on the beaches in South Africa. The softer creases in his armpits and, I learnt a little later, his groin, are two shades darker, like the very fine pale dirt around the trees on Sabu, and as warm.
“Yes. It really does. I actually thought that I could never  - you know, I didn’t want any more children after I had to let her go, but this is fantastic.”
She's in a slightly different position than the other four; it seems she hasn't collapsed as quickly as the others had. Her body is twisted; one hand clutches at the ground and the other is flung out behind her as if she tried to turn around and look up at something.
John, Albion and I faced her, and John extended his hand. “Thank you. For everything. I wish you all the best with – well, with the next babies.”
Sherlock feels the pain immediately. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be so graphic.  The thought of anyone hurting her makes me feel exactly the same.”
John holds his gaze for several long seconds. He wants to ask about the violin because it's such a wonderful thing to learn about a person this strange, but it's not what comes out.
John shrugs his shoulders as he  leans over one of the boxes, searching through the files which will be the 25th, 26th and 27th that he will read.
When he gets back to the living room. Sherlock is ordering some takeaway food, and the kettle is whistling in the background.
I flopped over to lie on my stomach as I unwound and he lay close, still whispering. His rage had gone, and the room filled with the sibilance of his tender words while the heat of his body kept me warm.
They lean a little into each other’s space and between them can smell skin, sandalwood, tannin, freshly laundered cotton, the metallic salt of London air and coconut oil. “Well,” John smiles, “since you’re so eager, why don’t you show me what Ambling Sidebar taught you?”
While I catalogued the Watson colour spectrum, he raised his hand so that my chin fitted perfectly in the cup of his palm. He used his thumb to still my lips and then leaned in to kiss me.
Sherlock’s unable to eliminate the impossible and therefore cannot deduce what probable thing made John suddenly reluctant to go on his date.
He has brought a file with scraps of a brief supporting the investigation of the Broken Beer Bottle Killer. It provides some information about an especially unlikable person who stabs people in the throat with a broken beer bottle in abandoned houses. Each of the four victims has bled to death slowly and in horrible choking pain.
Ludwig was a man of second bests. He came second to the dux of his high school in their final year, he was his mother’s second favourite child, he was the second most popular psychiatrist in Zurich. Psychiatry is not his first love – he longed to practice as a surgeon – but fell into psychiatry when, as a student,  he followed a lovely young woman from subject to subject. He found himself sitting next to her in an undergraduate unit of psychiatry, and came second in that course overall.
John steps carefully, noiselessly through one of the main areas and comes to a wide corridor that leads to the back of the building, which apparently faces onto a car park. The lights out there enable to John to see his target.
