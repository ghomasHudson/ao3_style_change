“You will continue to forge your chains, chains worse than your father’s,” Mary finished, before both faded into nothing, leaving Dean alone in a dark room.
Rolling out of his friend’s bed he found his waist to be hurting, which spiked his fears some more, however dear reader let me remind you of his attempts to climb the drain pipe the knight before, and let me remind you that falling can in fact hurt. Getting dressed was a mission, his clothes were tangled up in the blankets, and his socks were seemingly gone for good. Just as he was about to open the door it opened up and smacked him right in the face. Karma perhaps, Dean decided as he rubbed his now sore face. “Dean, you’re up!” Castiel sounded surprised, and Dean looked at him with sheepish eyes. The other man held up a glass of water and some Panadol, and Dean, with a polite grimace, accepted it.
Castiel only freaked them out a few times, flicking lights on and off when they were installed, but only out of idle curiosity… he stopped when they talked about getting an exorcist.
“I’ll drag you with me so you can feed me,” I smirked, stealing a piece of cucumber off of the chopping board.
“Fucking hell this is painful to watch,” I cried, jumping off of Gabe onto the floor and heading towards the stairs.
“Then I will be your friend too Dean,” Castiel laughed, watching the little boy bounce up and call for his mother.
“I do but I would rather it was after a date or something a little more romantic!” I complained, not even noticing as we moved closer to Dean who watched the line with an indecipherable look.
Some decisions, by nature, are exceedingly dumb. And at the ripe old age of twenty-one, Dean Winchester had made more dumb decisions than he would care to admit, but on the 19
“My dear Cassy, he’s asleep and I am your twin, admit it. You. Have. Fallen. In. love. With. Your. Slave.” Gabriel jeered, lighting the fire at last.
“Yeah but I mummy says I’m not allowed to bring Cas,” Dean told the older man seriously, making Castiel laugh.
Silently Dean sobbed. Until he felt the movement of the carriage that brought him there stop. That’s probably about the time that he began to figuratively shit himself, until his box was opened and he passed out from heat exhaustion.
“Like him.” Dean’s simple answer stopped Castiel in his tracks, his mouth falling open ever so slightly. Breath hitching in his chest like a love stuck school girl seeing her third crush of the week push his hair back in just the right way.
“I’ll be watching you when you get home, and as soon as your father is announced dead grab your brother and meet me outside the castle,” Castiel told his pet, his heart pumping blood a little too fast.
“The later,” Castiel agreed, watching Dean strip with hungry eyes, “although you can’t hear me now can you?” his answer was Dean climbing into bed without a response.
“G-go pack some stuff baby brother, and get Adam to too!” Dean told his younger brother; gasping as Castiel nuzzled his neck making Sam raise an eyebrow
“Cas died because of me,” Dean sobbed, dropping his head into his hands and sucking in a rugged breath.
“You offered!” Castiel defended himself, pouting none the less. So mean, he thought, deciding to punish Dean… but if he’s being offered sex… maybe another time.
Just over a year later the house was beautiful once more. Castiel spent most of the time in the library his father had originally built for Castiel and Anna. John and Mary had repaired it and stocked it with as many books as they could find. Castiel’s bedroom had become a nursery for the son Mary fell pregnant with nine months ago. Castiel new enough about pregnancy to know when they rushed out of the house two days and eight hours ago that the child was on the way. So he found himself pacing impatiently as he waited for the young family to return.
“Yes,” he whispered, lighting up Dean’s face who kissed him again softly before Castiel nudged him away, “I really do need to get ready Dean, I'm singing a solo tonight. And I’m telling the history of Christmas.”
“I’m okay with it, as long as when you flee the city, take Adam… he’s only ten... he needs to be protected,” Sam told the twins, blushing under Gabriel’s intense gaze.
“R-right… s-sorry…” Cas apologised before leaning over and sucking the section of skin he had bitten. After a moment he pulled away and pouted, “are you lying to me? Because there’s no mark here…”
When they got in Dean looked around, expecting Castiel to have been there, but stopped in his tracks when he heard the door lock. “Tea or coffee Dean?” Benny asked the heavily breathing boy.
“We’re saving Sam,” Castiel grinned, watching as Dean’s face lifted as his excitement bubbled within him. “But it comes with a catch…” Cas added, noticing Dean’s sudden change in mood.
“Why would he think that? Is he not aware that I am married with a son?” Crowley asked just as Sam and Gabe entered the room, both making gagging noises at the scene in front of them.
“I’m glad you liked it, I’m glad your first was better than mine,” Dean murmured darkly. Cas, rather than letting his friend be sad, kissed the green eyed boy in front of him.
“And miss the chance to see you?” Dean laughed, biting his lip, “sorry that came out wrong, I did want to see you, but to apologise… for hurting you…”
“Me?” Dean asks, tumbling off his chair and scrambling over to the camera. Our eyes lock, he gulps. “O-okay.”
And that is why Castiel was hiding in a corner the attic, fearing for his… existence. They worked their way through the rooms and Castiel could hear them as they finished the last room on the second floor. Dean was the first one to come up the ladder to the attic. Castiel whimpered loudly, not aware that Dean could hear him. “Who’s there?” Dean asked, shining a torch in Castiel’s direction. The torch illuminated Castiel who looked up at Dean in fear.
“I'm still hard brat, if you want I can finish what I started,” Castiel growled, his free hand scratching down Dean’s side, drawing a hiss of pain from the younger. Castiel whipped his leg over so he was laying on one side of the boy, still keeping his legs wrapped around so the kid couldn’t escape as his and grabbed Dean’s cock, which twitched causing Dean to realize, although he was scared and being molested, he was enjoying it more then he liked. “Your little prick seems to think I should continue.” Castiel smirked, causing Dean to look at his face, his breath hitched as he began to freak out.
“And wouldn’t you give anything for your first kiss to be with such a beautiful man?” Charlie pointed out, nodding to where Dean was kissing a grumpy thirteen year old girl on the cheek. Probably said something to her along the lines of “maybe when you’re older” to her.
“I-I'm not!” I defended myself, “either way I’m not helping make the sandwiches, I don’t need to learn to cook.”
“I wanted to invite you to the Christmas party Im having tomorrow,” Sam cheered jumping off the couch and bouncing like an excited puppy, “Gabriel has been cooking all day and I’m sure my house probably smells like the gingerbread cookies he has undoubtedly made too many of.”
“I was,” Dean promised, digging into his pocket with his free hand and pulling out the little velvet box, “for this.”
“We’ve all but won Dean, can I have a little victory sex?” Castiel asked when they got into… their room.
“Goodnight!” I suddenly chirped, falling asleep faster than Dean could reply, but hearing whisper an ‘I love you’ to me… which I think I replied… I hope I replied. Fuck…
But instead of phasing through the door he smacked straight into it. “Curious,” Castiel muttered to himself, looking down at his body to find himself completely naked. “Curiouser and curiouser.” He muttered again, slightly alarmed. Several scenarios burst through his brain, but if the one that seemed the least logical was right… well he wouldn’t mind ducking into Dean’s wardrobe first.
“Seeing as you don’t seem to remember, I’m going to be direct as ask as plainly as possible,” Castiel sounded nervous, which made Dean nervous. Dean tried to wrack his memory as quickly as he could, but turning up nothing and making his brain hurt even more, “you said you like me, is-is that true?”
“Scatter! The younger brother human thing is coming!” Rascal cried suddenly, picking up Chesh in his mouth and placing her on a discarded pillow before lying down next to her. I felt a pull at my neck as Bee picked me up by the scruff. He jumped onto my bed and dropped me on the pillow I normally slept on, before jumping onto the window ledge to lay in the sun. I curled up as the door opened and my younger brother stampeded into my room like he did every morning.
“Well I think you just scared my baby brother for life…” Dean sighed, wriggling out of Castiel’s arms and standing up, making the older man pout. “there’s someone else I want to save…” Dean fidgeted, looking anywhere but Castiel.
“Why are you guys doing this, you can’t be giving me back… a-are you bored of me?” Dean asked, stopping in his tracks.
“Typical Cas,” she grinned, taking his arm in hers, “I guessed you’d be here, come on you won’t believe who is working the kissing booth with the male!” the dragging didn’t stop until they came to two lines of people, leading up to two archways with mistletoe hanging from the top.
“Okay gorgeous we’re done for the day,” a sleazy voice informed me, letting me stand up from the uncomfortable position I was in.
“Guilty,” Cas said, smiling into Dean’s neck, his smile turning into a Cheshire cat esque grin when Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist, pulling him flush against Dean. Neither seemed to mind waking up sticky as they fell asleep.
“Castiel,” Michael sighed, “you realize that boy can’t give you children, you’ll have to marry soon anyway, so why are you so attached to him?”
“Life, I was focused on my job – working for you actually,” the older Dean explained, watching as his past self-kissed Cas again – both excited and happy to finally have gotten over their fear of rejection.
Yawn. Roll over. Fall off the bed. That’s how my mornings usually start. Today however. I just rolled over onto more bed… and that woke me up more than falling off the bed ever would. My eyes snapped open and I looked around the room to find everything was bigger… weird. But that’s not what freaked me out… it was the fact that I was surrounded by my cats… all four of them. And they were all bigger than me! Cookie, the eldest, came up to me first; she was a black and white cat with sock like markings and a white mask across her eyes. She sniffed me, only to give me a ‘that’s weird’ face and sit down, watching me as I looked at the next of my cats to come up to me. His name was Rascal; he was a rescue cat, and a bit of a fighter. He was a ginger kitty with a chunk of his ear and his fur didn’t grow in certain places because of scars. But my normally violent kitty just nuzzled me, I wasn’t surprised by the nuzzle, I was surprised by the fact that when he nuzzled me I saw I had paws. Jumping off my bed, I ran to the full sized mirror to find myself staring at a black kitten. With blue eyes. Copying everything I did. “What the fuck!” I yelled, tapping the glass with my ha-paw.
“Come on Sammy its Christmas!” a child’s voice cheered, making Dean swivel his head to look towards the stairs, all but tumbling down came a seven year old Dean, quickly followed by a three year old who almost tripped trying to copy his big brother.
“Ulterior motives Cas? I am ashamed of you,” the young man purred, getting a whack on the arm from Cas.
Dean himself would not get home until a little after midnight, and it wasn’t much of a home. It was constantly cold and dark, a mere place to go to sleep and nothing more – despite the many rooms. He ate a plain slice of bread in his mostly unused kitchen before waddling up to his bedroom. Inside his own room was not much brighter or warmer than the rest of the house. Dean stripped out of his suit, stretching out any kinks in his muscles before putting on a pair of sweat pants and climbing into his plush bed.
The two boys wandered around the fair on their way to the food stalls which were on the way to where the cake contest was being held, Dean insisting that it would be safest to hold hands as they did so. For fear of losing one another. The walked around, not really wasting the tokens on anything, but at one point Castiel did notice a small white reindeer toy with golden antlers and a red nose, its eyes were green and its hooves matched its antlers. Castiel pointed it out to Dean, who offered to win it for him. Dean waisted all his tokens on the toy meaning he had nothing to spend on food, but he did get the toy making Castiel blush when he gave it to him.
“Coffee sounds amazing.” Dean agreed, stepping through the door and blushing as their hands brushed against each other.
“B-but you told me he raped my son, why would my baby boy fall for such a horrible man?” the queen asked, looking at the two young men who stood before her.
“Was he talking?” Jo asked, clearly not wanting to say my name as Dean bent over and picked me up, his bruised eye swollen and bloodshot.
“Y-you need to suck the right spot… and for longer,” Dean told him, not trusting his voice to go over a whisper.  He watched as Cas once again bended over his arm and sucked it, but this time he sucked at a different part of Dean’s arm. When he pulled away there was a dark red mark.
“Because I am Castiel and I wouldn’t have had sex with him without his consent because I'm in lo-“ Castiel began to tell her but slapped his hand over his mouth and looking sheepishly at Gabriel who merely dropped his face into his hand and shook his head.
“Oh god,” Dean heaved, crouching to the ground and tugging at his hair with his hands, “p-please show me something good that comes by my decisions? Is there anything? Is Cas okay? Sam?”
Castiel sat on the grand piano that John had salvaged when they were rebuilding the house and watched Dean interact with his extended family after he was forced to give Sam back to Mary who sat next to her parents and Bobby’s wife Ellen who were all cooing over Sam. “So Dean you ready to handle all the responsibilities of being a big brother?” Bobby asked the little boy who was sitting on the floor hugging a teddy bear that was roughly the size of him. Castiel smiled at the little boy and nodded to Dean when he looked at him before Dean turned back to Bobby and replied.
“Leave me alone, you have no right to ridicule my life John Winchester, I am just like you!” Dean hissed, throwing the covers over his body and snuggling down.
“Please stop,” Dean whimpered as the man’s hands spread his butt cheeks apart before kneeling behind the frightened young man and roughly shoving his meat stick into Dean’s arse.
“R-right yeah, sorry Cas,” he laughed, ‘sneakily looking down my body, only succeeding at making me raise an eyebrow.
“I’m secretly an international spy and it would blow my cover as a giant dork?” he jokes, his eyes dipping to what only I would assume was my lips.
Dean and his ghostly companion moved into the hallway with full view of the people mingling and if any surprise guests arrived Dean would see them the moment they entered. And after what felt like an eternity the doorbell rang once more, startling the peaceful friends out of listening to Gabriel who huffed indignantly at the interruption before prancing over to the door, winking at Dean when none of the others could see his face. “He knows I’m here?” Dean asked the other Gabriel who shrugged.
“I lost count, I was over one hundred before you were born though, and that’s excluding years when I was alive,” Castiel admitted.
“You were totally smitten with this boy weren’t you,” Crowley teased, making the older version of Dean blush as Cas formulated his sentence.
Castiel came in an hour later to find Dean pacing, dressed in rugged, torn clothes from the south. Castiel had, unusually also changed his clothes, into a button down shirt, black trousers, a blue and white striped tie left untied around his neck, a black vest and a black penguin coat thrown over his arm. Dean however, was only in a pair of slacks that were missing the button of which were tied up with a piece of rope and an open button up shirt that was missing a few buttons, he shifted uncomfortably as Castiel licked his lips and motioned for the younger to come closer. Gulping audibly Dean slowly walked over to his owner, hanging his head so they didn’t make eye contact, before stopping just before the entrance of the room. “S-so why are you nicely dressed and I look like something out of a bad play?” Dean asked as Castiel buttoned up the few buttons that were still there before getting on his knees and grabbing the bottom of Deans left leg and tearing the knee down off before tearing a slit up to the middle of the thigh and standing up to look Dean over.
Castiel’s mother forced them to try her favourite, which was a red velvet cake with green cream cheese icing. She didn’t even mention the boys were holding hands, but the smile on her face told them she worked it out pretty quickly. Dean’s mother however made a big scene, fangirling over her son’s relationship and mentioning that if she doesn’t get grandchildren from any of her sons she will be cutting their balls off and having the sperm given to a sperm bank. Dean merely pulled a disturbed Castiel away from his evilly grinning mother. “I'm sorry Cas, she can be a bit crazy at times…” Dean winced, looking at the blue eyed male with a blush.
Castiel followed Mary around and smiled as she explored the building, her husband dawdling behind them with an amused grin. When they got upstairs they went into the master bedroom and she opened the door to the wardrobe and let out an undignified shriek, but judging by her never ending grin it was a happy shriek. “The wardrobe is the size of my parent’s house!” she exclaimed, Castiel furrowed his eyebrows in confusion,
“Whenever your free, call or text me,” he says, handing me a card. My heart stops and I feel my face heat up. Crowley huffs angrily.
“T-that’s irrelevant!” Dean said, wrapping his arm around Castiel’s neck and pulling him down for a kiss only to flip them over and straddle the bigger man, leaning over to kiss him properly.
“The prince who got Dean as his slave whilst Dean was in the East…” Gabriel told the queen, looking at his brother who was affectionately watching the sleeping Prince.
“Sam we’re taking you too, whether we have to force you or not,” Castiel said, shifting Dean so that the sixteen year old was sitting directly in his crack.
“Please,” Dean managed to choke out, making the man climb onto the bed and pull the sobbing young man into a hug.
“Let’s get you some food little guy,” Dean smiled, picking me up and carrying me downstairs and placing me on the table. “We don’t have any cat food… we do have some tuna though… that’s safe for cats to eat right…?” I sat down and watched a very confused Dean shuffle through the kitchen before picking up the phone and calling someone. “Mum… are you bringing cat food… yeah he did… I’m naming it Castiel… no… mum I’m not in love with Cas… what do you mean missing… I’m sure he’s fine… I know… if he’s still missing tomorrow I’ll look in our old secret places, tell Michael that… I love you too… calm down… mum I'm hanging up now.”
I don’t remember the last time I ate! I don’t remember the last time I slept for a reasonable amount of time.
“I suppose not… but I’m not sharing a bed,” Dean laughed, drawing my attention to his face. To his beautiful face. I began to try and count each of the freckles on his face. I always only got to twenty before he moved.
“I’m mostly calm!” I said, sitting down and allowing my two nuzzley babies to nuzzle me like mummy cats… even though they are both male.
“This little twit nearly got molested by a nobleman and I was a guard at the party who just happened to have been walking by, so it really wasn’t a big deal,” Benny told the confused teenager whose mouth opened as though he wanted to say something, but closed as his face heated up. Castiel looked at Dean, curious as to why he didn’t mention the fact that he had molested the blonde.
“So no breakfast, well let me go tell your dad he can eat all the pancakes,” Mary sighed, a grin still on her face.
Stealing a pair of Dean’s track pants and a tee shirt he put them on – drawing the draw string as tight as possible because they were too loose on him, before he ran downstairs, just in time to collide with Dean. “Dean!” Castiel cried, his eyes giving away his confusion and excitement.
“You’re exaggerating love,” John laughed, wrapping his arm around her shoulder and leading her out of the closet. They searched the other four bedrooms before they entered Castiel’s bedroom next and she sat on the fainting couch and smiled.
When they made it out of the city they chose to camp in a different spot to where they camped last. They didn’t light a fire. Lisa curled up with her baby boy. Sam curled up in a protective huddle around Adam. And Castiel in a protective huddle around Dean. Gabriel stayed up as guard, only to wake them when the sun rose, having collected the two horses from where they had left them. They packed the horses with the four extra bags and headed back to the east. Letting Sam and Adam ride one horse and Lisa and Ben ride the other. It took longer to get back to the east, then it had to get to the south. But when they did they changed into more appropriate clothes for the weather, and met in a quiet unused chamber of the castle. “So Dean, going to introduce me to your boyfriend?” Lisa asked five minutes into the silence.
“Cas…” Dean tried to warn, gasping as Castiel swivelled his tongue around Dean’s nipple, bitting it when it began to perk up.
“Well if there is a ghost, want to do me a favour and give me a blow job?” Dean joked, making Castiel flare up. Unsure if Dean was joking or not, Castiel didn’t move, instead watching Dean as he tossed and turned in bed. “Fine, I’ll get myself off.” Castiel left the room before he could see any more, but he couldn’t stop imagining what the view would have been like if he had stayed.
Dean raised an eyebrow, pulling his wallet out of his back pocket and giving Cas the credit card. "Okay. I'm intrigued. But remember, we're leaving after you come back."
Cas loved when Dean talked to him like this. It turned him on so much knowing he was doing as Dean said, pleasing the alpha. The omega got off knowing Dean was enjoying himself as much he was. He needed to hear those deep moans and breathy curses Dean made. They fueled him.
"Do you have anyone who can come pick you up?" The nurse asked, looking at Cas with concern. "Parents? Siblings?"
The light from the rising sun came through the window curtains, shining into Cas' eyes. The clock read 7:28 a.m. Cas grumbled, turning to bury his face in Dean's chest, but realizing Dean wasn't there.
Already, Cas knew Dean was going to be such a great father. He loved the way the alpha looked at their daughter, with such love and care. Cas could smell the change in Dean's scent. Dean was happy, content, and just a little nervous.
"No. I mean it. I want you to go. You don't have to stay in with me just because I'm pregnant. I'm not that clingy," Cas joked.
Cas smiled widely, looking at Dean. The alpha grabbed the knife, Cas grabbing at it too. They both pushed down on the knife, cutting into the cake. When they pulled a piece out, they both gasped when they saw the pink inside. Everyone started congratulating them, so excited for the couple.
Dean smiled back at her, putting his hand on her waist. Cas slammed his locker closed and started walking to first period. He sat at the same seat next to Dean's desk, pulling out a book to read to get his mind off what he just saw. He thought Dean liked him. Was Gabriel right? Was he just trying to sleep with him?
"It will," Cas insisted. "Besides, as long as I get to marry my alpha, I don't care how the wedding turns out."
Cas rolled his eyes, smiling fondly. He continued to make breakfast while Dean drank his coffee in the living room, watching the news.
Castiel changed into an old shirt Inias left him and a pair of pajama pants before laying back into bed.
"You know, I was thinking about cleaning the guest bedroom and get it ready for the pup," Dean says, rubbing circles on Cas' hip.
Later after school, Cas made his way towards Dean's car. He noticed the alpha was talking and laughing with a few of his friends. Cas slowed down, not wanting to interrupt. He knew what a lot of the seniors thought about his and Dean's relationship. Not that they would say anything to Dean's face, but Cas hears the rumors and gossip.
"I won't have to if you just have sex with me. One time," Dick smirked. "Just let me knot you. It's not like you're going to get pregnant."
Cas' brain couldn't even function when he was still being fucked within an inch of his life, whimpering from over-stimulation. Dean could feel his knot starting to swell. Before he came, he wanted Cas to come at least once more, so he thrusted at that sweet spot inside of the omega, continuously hitting it over and over.
I'm going to be ending this story soon. I'm thinking one more chapter will do, but I really want to try and make it into a series. What do you guys think?
Cas sat on Dean's bed, biting his nails while Dean finished taping up the last box filled with the alpha's things
"Um, well, the kid was nice. We didn't talk very much. Lisa was talking to me pretty much the whole time," Dean answered.
Once the coffee started, he heard the squeak of their bed and footsteps coming his way. Cas made a cup of coffee for Dean, just like he likes it, setting it down on the kitchen island.
The beta took note of the bitterness in Dean's voice. She got up and sat in Dean's desk chair beside him. "Look, I don't want to embarrass you or be too blunt about this, but do you like Cas?"
The omega helped Claire change into a Little Mermaid sleeping gown and got her in bed. He sat on the edge, tucking her in. He took the medicine out of the bag and opened them.
"Is there anything that could've caused the contractions? Maybe like stress?" Naomi queried, side-eyeing Dean.
"At least I'm putting a roof over your son's head," Dean countered. "Given that you were going to let him live on the streets after throwing him out."
"I only want the affections of one alpha," the omega said, pushing Dick's arm away. "And you are not that alpha. You never will be."
Then, the alpha struck that bundle of nerves that made Cas' toes curl and his heels dig into Dean's back. Dean continued hitting that spot making loud moans spill out of the omega's mouth.
"Shit," Cas cursed as he stepped in a crack in the sidewalk, breaking his heel. "I liked these shoes!"
"No need to get upset," Benny said, putting his hand in defense. "I was just being polite to your little omega here."
"What are you? Mobsters?" Cas snapped at his brothers, walking over as Gabe finished his threat. "I told you I was going to handle this on my own."
After a couple of hours, Cas came home, with bags in hand, to Dean walking to the living in just a towel.
Dean watched as Cas opened the door to greet his alpha date. He held back a growl that was ready to come out. He took gis camera from around his neck and put it on his desk before settling on his bed.
Dean sat over at the window, taking a drag from a newly lit cigarette. Cas sat in front of the older Winchester, pulling his legs to his chest, toying at the sweater he had on.
"I.... I don't know. I just got flustered and I couldn't process what happened. He's a sweet guy and I felt bad for him. He even bought me a flower. I don't know what was wrong with me. I just couldn't let him down, but I have no interest in him whatsoever. I promise. I love you and only you."
"Gross, Dean," Sam chided, pushing Eileen towards the door. "Don't forget we're supposed to help mom with prepping for Christmas."
"Of course, baby," Dean answered. "You mean so much to me and I love you no matter what. Especially now that you're carrying my pup."
"I'm just angry," the omega muttered. "I hate him so much. He's always coming on to me and touching me. Now, he knows I'm pregnant. He threatened to tell everyone if I didn't sleep with him. He's disgusting."
"Cas, you haven't been in a relationship since high school. Why don't you try to let someone in? Maybe one of the guys that asks you out could be the one," Charlie said.
Cas smiled softly, nodding. He grabbed Dean's hand as the alpha led him to the dancefloor. Dean held Cas' waist while Cas wrapped his arms around the alpha's neck as they swayed along to the music.
The alpha ran to get the first aid kit from the bathroom. Cas tried not to focus on the pain. Dean rushed back, picking Cas up with ease to sit him on the counter. And that just turned him on more.
Dean thrusted up for emphasis, hitting Cas' prostate straight on. Cas made a sound that was halfway between a gasp and a moan. The omega needed more, so he started bouncing and grinding faster. Dean's cock continued to brush against that bundle of nerves.
"Just tell him to take Claire to the park. Then we can have the place to ourselves," Dean offered, pressing his crotch into Cas' ass.
The kitchen was a mess. Cas had went all out to make these pies as perfect as he can make them. He wanted to make them as good as Dean's mom. Cas heard the jingling of keys before he heard the front door open and close. Dean walked in, looking for Cas, finding him in the kitchen.
Dean scoffed. "I was surrounded betas and alphas for over a year. You really think I didn't have sex?" He winked at Sam as he walked past him.
"I know, gorgeous," Dean grunted, pulling Cas' hair back to expose his long, tan neck. "But you're gonna cum when I tell you to cum."
"Yeah, but it's your graduation tomorrow. We can't bring her or to the after party your friend is throwing," Dean pointed out.
Dean smiled. "I'm feeling great. My fiancé just gave birth to our beautiful daughter. I'm amazingly happy."
The two alphas dragged him under the bleachers where no one can find them. Dick pushed Cas onto his knees before unbuttoning his slacks, pulling out his cock, pushing it to the omega's lips.
While Cas wasn't paying much attention, Dean walked in, a towel around his waist, water dripping down his torso.
Dean still felt out of place at the party filled with no one over 19, but he wanted to make his boyfriend happy by coming along.
"Seriously?" Cas laughed. "You won't have to eat snails. They have a lot of other food I'm sure you'll like."
When Dean came home, Cas didn't even notice. The alpha walked in with a pink box, finding his fiancé on the couch, his focus on his phone. Dean quietly walked to the living room and kissed the top of Cas' head, scaring the omega's phone out of his hand.
"I hate to bail on you, but I was gonna go to the gym and sign up for the football tryouts before the bell rings," Dean explained.
Cas once again, came with a silent cry, clenching and tipping Dean over the edge, his knot locked in his omega, coming over and over inside. The omega slumped into Dean's arms as he carefully walked them back to their bed.
"I'm so sorry, Cas," Dean finally spoke. "I didn't mean to be that harsh. I almost made you cry. I'm so fucking sorry. I shouldn't have had you hold in your orgasm for that long."
"Hi," the nurse greeted, walking in, holding some papers. "You're free to go. I just need you to sign a couple of documents for me."
When the couple arrived at the house, the music was thumping throughout the big house and teens dressed in various costumes were drinking and dancing. Cas entered first, Dean right behind, holding on to the omega's hips.
Finally, a nurse turned her attention to the couple, handing him a clipboard with paperwork. "If you can just take a seat and fill these out. We'll be right with you."
"You're not part of that toxic family. You were always helping me and protecting me," Cas replied, smiling at his big brother. "You, Hannah, and Samandriel can visit us anytime."
"How would you? You fucking left me and your baby! Do you know how I was treated at school? All the alphas kept harassing me because they figured I was easy and since I was already pregnant they could knot me whenever they pleased."
The alpha grabbed Cas by the waist, pulling him against him, kissing him passionately. Cas immediately kissed back, holding Dean's face. Everyone cheered and clapped, some wiping tears.
Cas let Dean dominate the kiss while he just grabbed onto Dean's shirt with one hand while the other was holding the back of Dean's neck.
"Hell yeah. With fishnet stockings," Dean said, imagining Cas in the costume. "Fuck, you need to get that."
Dean sighed, zipping the back of the outfit. "I'm gonna feel like an old man at a kindergarten party."
The omega hugged Claire, calming down. The 16 month old could smell her papa in distress. She started whining, picking up on Cas' mood.
By the evening, all the Novak siblings were gone. Dean decided to cook dinner, letting Cas relax on the sofa with his feet up. While the pasta was cooking, Dean went to check on Cas. He found the omega humming happily, working on a sketch.
Gilda stirred awake, hearing the crying. Dean put a hand on her shoulder, reassuring her. She understood and cuddled back up to Charlie, slowly drifting back to sleep. Dean started upstairs with Cas. They went to the nursery to find Luke awake and crying. Dean looked back at Cas, not knowing what to do. Cas pushed him a bit towards the wailing newborn. Dean took the hint and went to pick up the pup, craddling him before rocking him gently. Cas smiled softly watching Dean with the baby.
"Not here. My mom would kill me if we ruined her couch," Dean said, getting up from the couch. He grabbed Cas' hand and led them upstairs to his bedroom.
That was the moment Cas fell for Dean. He never imagined that gorgeous, popular, junior would ever look his way, but here he was standing in front of the wonderful alpha.
They got to their door and Dean unlocked it with one hand, still carrying Cas then walked inside. Cas smiled and kissed Dean softly.
"Your mom is right. It would definitely benefit us. We're really going to need stuff for the pup," Cas agreed.
"I'm sorry," Dean said, voice soft and sympathetic. "If you don't mind me asking, why did you break up?"
Dean went to the passenger side to help Cas out of the car. The alpha then started grabbing stuff out of the trunk of the impala. First, he got the tent out to start assembling it.
I want to thank all of you for the lovely comments and all the kudos. I really appreciate it. It makes me want to continue writing. I hope you continue to read as I add on to this story. I also hope y'all are staying safe and healthy. Don't forget to think about others around you. Keep staying positive. I love you all. Until next time. <3
"Okay, everybody. I think it's time," Mary said, putting the cake down on the table in front of Cas and Dean.
Cas shrugged. "I told Gabe I was going to meet him at the bar by our apartment, but I really don't want to."
"I'd love to, but I should actually be leaving. My brother wants everyone home for a family meeting." Cas grabbed his backpack and binder from the living room. "Thank you for the snacks, Mrs. Winchester."
"Sweetheart, listen to me," Dean said, grabbing both of Cas' hands. "Your family can disown you, hate you, hate me, but we'll still have each other, okay? It's you and me now. That's all that matters. And what matters even more is that little pup growing inside you," he put both of their hands on the omega's stomach.
The omega grabbed at Dean's cock from behind, sitting on the hard length. Before Cas could get any pleasure, Dean flipped them back over so he was hovering over Cas.
Once in his room, Dean pulled Cas close by the waist. He could already smell the nervousness coming from Cas.
After getting to the hospital, Dean basically carried Cas to the front desk, slamming his hand down trying to get someone's attention. All the nurses were buzzing around tending to other things.
All day, everywhere Cas went, the whispering and staring started. But, it didn't bother him. He kept his head held high. He wasn't going to let Dick or the rest of the kids bother him anymore. He was almost done with school anyway.
Cas watched Dean walk out, only to see him walk right back in holding a bottle of ginger ale and a box of crackers.
"She would like us to go over and have dinner with them on Sunday," Cas added. Dean opened his mouth to say something, but Cas cut him off. "Both of us."
"Come on, baby," Dean breathed. "I want this whole neighborhood to know how loud you are, how much you like getting fucked hard."
"Dean," Cas sighed, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck. "I thought we were going to forget this ever happened. I don't want you to be upset anymore. Please."
"As of March 12th, 9:37 a.m., the city of Lawerence is now under quarantine. We urge people to stay in their homes until further notice," the governor advised.
"Wow, that's a lot of trophies and medals," Dean said in awe, grabbing a trophy to examine it closer.
Cas nodded, taking a seat next to the beta, putting his backpack and books next to the chair. The omega groaned, feeling the vomit coming back up again. He grabbed the small trash bin next to him and emptied his stomach once again.
Dean pulled away after a few seconds. "I'm sorry, Cas. I should've known that you weren't like other omegas. That's the main reason I fell in love with you."
"I'm actually feeling really great," Cas responded. "Other than the back pain and the fatigue, I'm good."
"No, no, no, no. Baby, it's nothing. I don't want her. I told her to fuck off. I don't have any feelings towards her," Dean quickly explained.
It didn't take very long for Dean to finger Cas open. He was slick with anticipation, just ready for Dean's cock. The alpha lined up with Cas' hole, pushing in antagonizingly slow. Cas whimpered, trying to push back to hurry Dean along, but Dean wanted to savor the night of sex even if he has to torture himself as well.
"I told her I would take her ice skating after she feels better. Maybe you would like to come? Meet her as my friend?"
"I'm going to take a shower," Cas told Dean, heading towards the door. Before he walked out he turned back to his roommate. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner with you. It was nice getting to know you better."
Cas gave a quick approval and the beta walked in. Gabe froze, looking his brother over. There was something different about him. The omega's eyes widened when he noticed Gabriel scanning and scenting the air.
"Well, thanks. I'm just glad coach finally put me in. I thought I was going to be on that bench forever," Dean commented.
"Gabriel dropped me off not too long ago. I wanted to get settled in before I came to see you." Castiel pulled away, smiling. "How was your summer, Charlie?"
The alpha looked over at Cas and smiled, watching Cas stare at his ring. That smile is what Dean wanted to see, even if he has to pick up extra shifts to afford it. The ring wasn't all sparkling diamonds, but Dean got the next best thing and he was so happy to know Cas loved it.
"Fuck you," Cas spat. "You know damn well you're not the father. I've never even had sex with you, you egotistical asshole."
The owner nodded, turning to go get another type of cake. Cas got up and followed to tell her about a surprise he was hoping the owner could do. The alpha owner smiled and nodded at Cas' request.
With that one sentence, blood rushed right to Dean's crotch. "I'm sorry, what?" The alpha stuttered out.
Everyone laughed. Cas blushed, and laughed a little. Dean, on the other hand, was pouting with his arms crossed, half embarrassed, half ashamed he never figured out Cas' crush on him.
When they finished eating, they noticed how late it was. There was one or two other people in the cafeteria besides them.
"You know why I think of your parents that way. Cas, I know what they're trying to do to us. You don't seem to notice how they treat me."
Later that night, Dean got home, tired and dirty from working all day. The last thing he thought he'd come home to was a sour, bitter scent lingering in the apartment. Dishes and silverware clinked loudly. The noise and scent coming from the kitchen.
"Fuck yes," the alpha breathed out, staring at his boyfriend's body. "I mean, yes, you do need an exam. Lay back on the bed."
"That's fine," Dean said, grabbing a piece of muffin from Cas' hands. "Are you excited to graduate?"
The Winchester knew how to flirt. That was his specialty. He could talk any guy or girl into doing stuff with him. But with Cas, it was harder. Dean knew Cas liked him, and to be honest, Dean felt bad for stringing Cas along.
A smile tugged on the alpha's lips, hands still possessively over Cas' belly. "You're beautiful. Round and full with our pup."
The front door closed behind Dean when he left. Cas decided to go to their bedroom and put on something sexier. He put a pair of light blue laced underwear on with a matching blue laced chemise, which was a bit tight, before wrapping himself up in the blanket. He went back to the living room and sat on the couch, waiting for Dean.
When Cas got off the phone, the couple said their goodbyes to Dean's family before grabbing their coats and walking next door to the Novak house.
They stayed there, breathing heavy before Dean pulled out and laid next to Cas. The omega rolled over to drape himself on Dean. The Winchester tipped Cas' chin up to kiss him softly. Cas responded, deepening the kiss.
"We can change that," the alpha insisted, grabbing a handful of Cas' ass. "I'll put that dirty mouth to use."
"Oh, I know all about that," Mary chuckled. "Dean was attached to my hip. I couldn't leave him for a second. He would throw a fit until I picked him up."
Dean coated his thick, hard length in his omega's slick before pushing into his perky ass. The moan Cas made was one of satisfaction and indescribable pleasure of finally being filled with his alpha's cock. The alpha thrusted shallowly before picking up the pace, feeling his boyfriend's ass envelope his throbbing cock, loving the way they move together.
"I am," the young beta said, amused. "But I can read lips. It helps a lot for people who don't know sign language very well."
"I am thinking of her," Cas raised his voice a bit. "She deserves to know who her father is. She deserves a family. I want to give that to her."
"Shit," Dean cursed, putting out the cigarette, waving his hand around to get rid of the smoke. "I'm out here, baby."
"I've been good," Lisa nodded, looking down, rubbing her stomach. "Just waiting for this little guy to arrive."
"Oh, we're doing backstories," Dean said amusingly. "Okay, well, I could pretty much go to any college I wanted because of my athletic history. But I chose to go to the state university and stay close to home, but since I decided to go into photography instead of pursuing wrestling, I had to start paying out of pocket."
"Daddy, how much longer until we get to Uncle Gabriel's?" The six year old asked, kicking her feet anxiously.
After the prayer, everyone started passing around plates and bowls like a pristine routine. Each of them was in sync. Cas wasn't sure how to bring his situation up. No one really talked during dinner. It was just the usual small talk here and there.
Both of them laid there, breathing heavily, holding each other close. Dean picked Cas up enough to move him to lay his head on the pillow. He brought the duvet over them, pulling Cas closer to his chest.
"That's why I was calling," Gabe paused, sighing, "mom and dad wanted you to come home for Thanksgiving."
"Not on the couch," Cas said, pulling away from the kiss. "I don't want to have to explain come stains to guests."
Cas complied quickly, his ass in the air, panties soaked with his slick. Dean licked his lips and started kneading Cas' ass. He pulled down the omega's panties to expose his pretty pink hole, needing to be filled by an alpha knot.
"I'm inside all day. I'll be fine. Like Ms. Mosley said, you shouldn't be getting sick when you're pregnant," Dean told him, driving them out of the parking lot towards the high school.
Cas chuckled at the fumbling alpha. Dean held out his arm for Cas to take, leading him to his sleek, black car. The two high schoolers drove off to start their date.
"Your phone woke me up," Cas explained, holding up the alpha's phone. "I answered it. It was someone named Benny."
Cas quickly went to the living room, still in view of the front door, but where Dean couldn't see him. Gabriel opened the door with an angry, protective-older-brother look.
"It seems like we're ready to move into our apartment," Dean said, wrapping his arm around his omega and kissing his temple.
The alpha looked down at Lisa's stomach. He didn't even noticed her enlarged belly. "Oh, wow. You're pregnant."
Once he got dressed and took time to finger himself open to push the plug inside of him, Meg was here to pick him up for school.
"Damnit, mom," Cas exclaimed, slamming his hand on the kitchen island. "I've had it with this shit. I'm so tired of you trying to break me and Dean up. I love him. I'm going to marry him whether you like it or not. He's the father of your grandchild. And he is going to be in our lives till the day one of us dies."
The room was silent. Both parents did not say a word. The tension was so thick, you could cut it with a butter knife.
The alpha pulled Cas into him, resting his hands on the omega's waist. "This is the beginning for us."
Later on when class started, Dean took a seat in the back of the class as everyone shuffled in to their seats. That's when he saw the same guy he saw earlier walk in. The boy looked around, trying to find an empty seat, before seeing a free seat by Dean.
Ever since Cas invited Dean to get dinner with them one day, the alpha has been socializing with them, considering he doesn't know many people at school.
"I...," the alpha drifted off. "I don't know. I mean, I can always pull out. I have a degree in automotives. I can work with my dad and Uncle Bobby."
Dean called the tree seller and told him which tree they picked. The man and Dean carried the tree to the car, strapping it on the roof. Cas looked on, smiling. It was going to be their first Christmas tree together. He was ecstatic. He couldn't wait to go home and decorate it.
His mom wanted him to spend the weekend with them since his Uncle Bobby, Aunt Ellen, and cousin Jo were coming over.
"I was thinking, since it's Friday, we can go apartment hunting," the alpha suggested as he pulled out of the school parking lot, the engine roaring just the way Cas loves.
Dean celebrated a bit before kissing the omega roughly, holding the back of his neck. Cas moaned into the kiss, letting Dean dominate him.
Dean looked at Cas up and down, trying to figure him out. They've only known each other for a couple of weeks, but Dean still wants to know more about the omega. Not that he has a crush. He doesn't. He just thinks it's polite to know more about your roommate.
The cafeteria was almost empty. Not a lot of people eat dinner at the school unless they're low on cash.
"I miss you guys too. But mom and dad wanted me out. They couldn't accept my pup and my boyfriend. Until they're fine with everything, I'm not going back," Cas retorted.
Dean chuckled, shaking his head. "Your hair has a mind of its own. It's always going to make you look like you just got fucked."
"Sorry I took so long, baby," the alpha said, sitting next to Cas, wrapping his arm around him. "You should of went back to bed."
"The best," Cas said with his mouth full. He swallowed and spoke. "Why did you buy these? I'm on a diet."
The principal stopped and smiled warmly at Cas. "Of course, Mr. Novak. Do you want to come by my office?"
"Fair enough," Cas snorted. "So, now that our daughter is fast asleep, where is my reprimanding I was supposed to get?"
"I... I don't- Ow!" Cas yelled, holding his stomach, folding in on himself. "Dean, something's wrong."
Cas waited at the picnic table for Dean. When Dean finally came out, he was wearing green and blue swimming trunks with no shirt. Cas bit his lip, looking the alpha up and down.
The Novak family lost their mom a year ago, devastating the entire family, especially Cas, the baby of the family. Their father, Chuck, made the decision to move and give his children a fresh beginning.
Gabriel clapped his hands together to get everyone's attention. "Let's play another game. 'Never have I ever.' I'll pour the shots."
“Presents! Presents! Presents!” Sammy cried, bouncing up and down, one of his hands still gripping their mother’s leg.
“Fuck me please C- Master,” Dean begged, Castiel’s eyes widened at the name Dean called him before rocking his hips and thrusting into the blonde’s arse.
Dean, being a complete and utter moron, proceeded to choke on his own tongue. A feat few can truly master. After a rather severe coughing fit, Dean stared at his friend, heart hammering in time with his head, both hurting simultaneously. “I-I’m sorry, I know you’re gay, and that doesn’t mean you have to like me back, I really never intended to admit it to you honestly. People do stupid things when drunk, say stupid things. I should just go; I have to make sure I’m ready to go home tomorrow. I hope you have a lovely Christmas, and that you get exactly what you wished for. I’m going. Bye.” Before Dean could escape Castiel’s room however, Castiel caught his wrist in a gentle but firm grip, making Dean’s dumb bitch brain splutter, and his heart flutter, and his legs feel like melting butter, and all the other appropriate rhymes.
He knelt in front of it, not entirely sure who to expect, and yet fearful of what he might find. But a nagging voice in the back of his mind told him he had already figured it out. And if that was the name on the tombstone he felt as though his heart would give out. Or throw up. Or throw up then have his heart give out.
“Dean, I am a virgin,” Cas stated, his voice breathless, “But there’s nobody I’d rather lose it to then you.” He admitted before Dean could pull away.
“What are you idjits doing here, dinner is ready,” Dean’s uncle said, appearing from the kitchen with a bear in his hand for Dean, which he nearly dropped when he saw Dean’s black eye, “Mary I hope you have an uncooked stake or some peas!” he called out making Dean’s mum burst into the room and drop the cutlery she was holding.
“So there are two options here,” Charlie continued for him, catching onto why Kevin was smiling and joining in, “either you bought yourself a present.”
“Ba Humbug,” Dean hissed, stepping over to his personal Whiskey and pouring himself a glass which he drowned instantly before pouring another.
“Dean I knew you had no intention of marrying me, Ben was a pleasant mistake, I'm glad he was born, but I don’t intend to force you to marry me for our son’s sake, just as long as you agree to be in is life,” Lisa smiled sadly, smiling at her little boy who was currently sitting in Dean’s arms asleep.
“I did it!” Cas cheered, looking up into Dean’s eyes, making the blush Dean was already supporting darken. Dean’s breath hitched as he looked into Cas’ eyes, the pupils in both pairs of eyes blown wide with arousal. Cas’ eyes suddenly dropped to Dean’s exposed collar bone and swallowing.
“I was hoping you had a red headed doll, it’s for my baby sister,” Castiel replied, going closer to the counter where the shop boy was. “Do you know if there’s one I could have?”
“I-I,” Dean spluttered, losing focus and cutting his finger with the knife. “Shit.” Without even thinking I reached over the bench and grabbed his hand, before putting his finger in my mouth and sucking it. Cleaning the wound of any bacteria that would have been on the knife. As soon as I was done, I pulled away and looked at it, checking whether it was deep enough to need stitches.
“What the fuck,” Dean asked as Castiel picked him up and threw him over his shoulder, slapping his butt and earning a moan from Dean.
Men and women both perve on me as I walk over to the set in the skimpy underwear. Who would ever buy these?
“Two reasons, I didn’t think I would be allowed into heaven,” Castiel admitted, “the other being I wanted to protect Anna.”
Five years later and Dean still talked to Castiel non-stop, Castiel also helped him with homework to the best of his abilities. but one day when Dean was sitting in his room doing homework, his father came in. “Dean! What are you up to?” he asked, crouching down so he could look over his shoulder at Dean’s homework, “ah homework!”
Dean got off not long after, meeting us at the oversized pine tree that had been lavishly decorated. Apparently some other son of one of the Ladies of the Church was forced to take his spot. “Charlie! Cas!” Dean called to us as he appeared, the crowd parting for him like he was Moses.
“Bollocks.” He cursed, sending a jet of green sparkles towards me… sparkles that made me feel weird.
“Yeah, but you can have it now, no strings attached – it was made specifically for you anyway. Seems kinda stupid for me to keep it,” Dean told him, “I mean really I only came to this party to give it to you… and to say Im sorry for being an arsehole.”
Crowley was furious. Dean was stunned. And they just kept fighting over me. Over the fact that I am just property. Just a tool to make Crowley richer.
“No hey Gabe?” Gabriel pouted, pushing himself off the ground to throw his arm around the tall red head’s shoulders.
“It was closed down,” the ghost told him, “your friend Benny paid for pretty much everything out of his own pocket, and when he quit his job with you…”
“We’re making it seem like you escaped, your dad will be more likely to accept you back,” Castiel explained as he grabbed his lover’s hand and dragging him out of the bedroom, closing the door behind him.
“Be my boyfriend?” He begged, making my heart beat speed up, but in a good way as he closed the distance between our faces, kissing me but not to any more than he had any of the girls in line, well apart from the fact that it was obviously more passionate then their kisses had been. He pulled away sooner than I had liked, his face stained with red as he looked at me with my stunned face. I vaguely felt a hand reach into my pocket and pull out one of the tokens.
“How come she gets the Winchester original doll, you’re not her legal guardian!” Claire pouted, looking a little more than jealous.
“You, our son, will be visited by three spirits,” Mary continued for him, her voice strained and cracking as though she wanted to cry, making Dean wonder if ghosts could cry.
“Well I’ll walk you over then,” Dean said with a pout, his hand squeezing Castiel’s as he pulled him towards the stage, Castiel knew that Dean could see the blush and honestly he didn’t care.
“Do you know what will happen to her?” Dean asked, watching the cute little girl hungrily devour the soup, eyeing off any older men who dare come near her food.
The box itself was simple and sweet, with a velvet material that still felt soft to the touch. He opened it up, looking inside it, making his heart clench a little more, the inside was a simple red satin, and in the centre of the bottom, embedded into a small groove was a simple ring. A simple white gold band with a fingerprint – Dean’s fingerprint – engraved into the top. Dean plucked it out of the box, cradling it in the palm of his hand, and reading the engraving on the bottom of the inside, ‘my beloved Angel’.  A simple ring that Dean had intended to be an engagement ring.
“Why is Sammy working?” Dean asked quietly, “he loves Christmas, and Gabriel would never let him work on Christmas.”
He comes over and feels me up. If I react poorly I’m out of a job, I’m ruined. I don’t react at all.
Dean started school in the autumn of the next year. And within the first day he had made friends with two boys. Benny and Gabriel. Of course Castiel didn’t go to school with him, but he did hear all about Dean’s new friends when he got home from school. He told Castiel all about the first day, then the second, third and every day. Castiel didn’t mind he found it adorable that the child could be so excited about something that in this time period seemed to be so trivial.
“Fucking hell,” Crowley curses from the front seat. I look up at him to see him growling at the traffic that bloomed up in front of us.
“Yes!” Dean shouted, “go away! I don’t need you anymore!” Castiel just nodded and let himself evaporate, floating up into the attic where they had stored the fainting couch and forgotten about it.
“Dean,” Castiel sighed as he entered the room, lying next to Dean and staring at him, “what do you want to do now?” Castiel asked, getting a confused look from Dean.
“W-what?” I asked, my eyes dropping to his lips. I was faintly aware of the voices of the girls in line telling us to hurry up.
“Y-you don’t remember?” Castiel frowned, walking over to Dean and touching his arm, however unlike every other time he tried to make contact – his hand didn’t go through.
“You’re in love with my son?” the queen finished for the shying brother who nodded at her before taking a long look at his slave. Dean shuffled in the bed, murmuring mostly incoherent nonsense but occasionally begging for Castiel to come closer. “Well if you intend to woo my son you might as well call me Mary, or mother when you’re not around my husband, he might take it the wrong way… and even if he does take it the correct way, he thinks the love between two men is unnatural… can’t say I really blame him.”
“Punishment! Forged by his cruelty! And if you don’t mend your ways you will end up the same!” Mary sobbed, “please, just listen.”
When it finally stopped he found himself sitting on his lounge room floor, his back against a wall. But this time he was not alone. “Do you understand Dean?” Death asked his voice slightly rougher than it had been.
“N-no.” Kissing down Dean’s body Castiel stopped at his clothed bottom half, seeing the erection already straining underneath the tight slacks he wore. In a swift movement he was biting it hard enough to draw a moan from Dean, but soft enough to not badly hurt him… which for Dean was really hard.
“I know,” Castiel said as he began to lose himself in his euphoria. “Fuck Dean.” He panted, thrusting into his lover then moving them so that Dean was lying on his back. Thrusting in a more erratic and rough manner, but still managing to get Dean’s prostate each time.
“N-no, a w-woman s-shoved me i-in h-here…” Dean stuttered, pressing his back against the wall as a figure rose from the bed and walked over to him before grabbing his wrist and dragging Dean to the bed which the figure then threw him on and climbed on top of him.
"Well, I'm sure you're going to make...another omega or beta very happy," Cas said, forcing the words out.
Right before the bell rang, Dean waltzed right in, sitting next to Cas, giving him a charming smile.
"Baby, what's wrong? Is it the pup? Are you okay?" Dean questioned, sitting next to Cas, wiping his tears.
"I can't believe this is happening to me," Cas cried, pulling away from Sam before he got the alpha's shirt wet. "Everyone is going to be laughing and talking behind my back for the rest of the school year."
"I told you I didn't trust that dude. I'm sure that was all he wanted from you," Gabriel complained.
Dean tossed his phone on the bedside table. He can't take all the messages. He dug around in his old drawers, finding an open pack of cigarettes and a lighter.
Dean pushed the plug in and out of Cas, watching his hole stretch around it, making the omega moan. Dean finally took it out, admiring the slick running down Cas' thighs. After what felt like hours to Cas, Dean started pushing into his boyfriend slowly. A breath caught in Cas' mouth, feeling the girth of his alpha's cock. Dean started thrusting slowly, just feeling the heat and tightness of Cas. He grabbed the omega's hips, rotating his own hips, pressed close to Cas.
"I never fucked the most beautiful omega," Dean started, walking towards the bathroom. "I definitely loved that."
"Like Balth said yesterday, we're juniors in college. A lot of people are already mated. Some with kids on the way. Maybe you should try getting out there. Inias isn't your one and only," Charlie said.
"Wow. So, you'll tend to a kid that's not even yours, but won't bother to tend to your kid," Gabriel retorted.
"You need to make an appointment with your doctor. It's really important," the teacher explained. She smiled softly, putting his hand on Cas' shoulder. "Why don't you get your stuff and go to the nurse's office?"
It didn't take long until all of the furniture and boxes were put in the couple's new apartment. Cas was so grateful for Dean's loving family helping them move.
Cas threw a banana peel back which Dean hit straight on making the alpha curse and lose his place, going back down to 7th place.
"What the fuck do you mean you didn't get a chance to?" Dean raised his voice again. "You had the whole godamn school day, Castiel!"
He smoked a few cigarettes to calm down. Was it right for him to get as mad as he did? Cas didn't technically cheat or anything. Plus, he did admit to what happened. Although, it wasn't until they got home that he finally came out and said it. Then again, maybe he didn't want to ruin their date. Dean's head was swimming.
Drinks were passed around as the stripper danced on each guest, but mainly on Cas. Everybody was laughing and having a great time.
Cas stared at Dean with disbelief. "Why....why didn't you just tell me that? You could've called me or texted me. I mean....I hated you for 6 years when I should've been hating your dad."
Cas smiled and started putting his boots on before going to the vanity to mess with his hair while Dean continued to get dressed.
The alpha was about to protest, but decided against it. He can try and have fun with his new friends, even if it involves dancing at a club.
Cas couldn't help but blush from Dean's dirty talk. He loved how talkative Dean was during sex. It was one of those things Cas could never get use to, but in a good way. It made him feel good. It made him feel like he was making
The omega nudged Sam playfully, both of them laughing. Dean walked over, Cas and his jackets in hand.
The alpha kept kissing as he was pulling down his sweatpants and underwear. Cas pulled away and took his shirt off. He started to kiss down Dean's bare chest to his erection, taking Dean's cock in his mouth.
"Do not tell Gabriel about this. I'm seeing him tomorrow and I will tell him then," the omega demanded, looking straight at Charlie.
"Thank you for cleaning the kitchen. And getting the pie out of the oven," Cas told him, kissing Dean softly.
"I'm really happy for you, Sammy," Dean admitted, trying to hide that small piece of sadness. "You two are going to be amazing parents."
Dean opened and closed his mouth a couple of times before saying, "Um, I mean, i guess. If that's what you really want to do."
At the end of the night, Cas and Dean went to pick their daughter up at Gabriel and Michael's apartment. Michael answered the door and let the couple in. Gabriel was playing with Claire on the floor in the living room. Cas smiled as he watched his older brother pretend to help Claire dance.
"Now, Dean, place the ring on Castiel’s finger and repeat after me: Castiel, I give you this ring..."
Ever since Cas got pregnant, they noticed the omega was a lot more sensitive to Dean's touches, giving Cas intense orgasms everytime the couple had sex.
Slick was basically spilling out from the anticipation. Dean happily licked it up, making lewd slurping noises that were drowned out by Cas' moans and curses. The alpha started pushing his tongue in Cas' hole, adding a couple of fingers to stretch him open.
Cas pulled off, giving a swirl of the tongue to the slit of the alpha's dick one last time. He looked up at Dean. "Please, alpha."
The smell of pies baking filled the couple's apartment. Cas was covered in flour. He just pulled a pie out of the oven and put the next one in. His feet were hurting him, but he wanted to finish so he could go lay down and relax a bit before Dean comes home from work.
Cas was stunned. He got the courage to pick his books up and go sit at the empty seat. Cas was used to being called that, but he didn't expect it this early from bullies. He shook the word out of his head, focusing on his notes.
"How many times do I have to tell you, you need to stop getting into fights with those boys. It's not worth getting beaten up," the nurse told the beta, blotting the wound around his eye with a cotton ball soaked in something.
Cas snuggled into Dean's neck, smelling the calm, happy scent. "I'm excited. My heart's pumping just thinking about it."
Cas opened his mouth to say something, but the lead singer of the wedding band cleared her throat to get everyone's attention after they finished their song.
Charlie snickered. "I'm sorry, but he texted me telling me to keep an eye on you. He really doesn't like the idea of you bunking with an alpha."
Cas nodded, chewing on another bite of the baked good. "I'm just happy I got accepted into the university 25 minutes away."
"Are you going to keep growing your facial hair?" Cas questioned, feeling the rough hair on Dean's cheek.
"Yes, baby." The alpha gave Cas a chaste kiss. "I promise. We'll have our own place and we'll do all this together." He wiped the tears from the omega's eyes.
Cas was desperate for Dean's warm skin to touch his own. He started to quickly unbutton Dean's plaid shirt, pushing it off his shoulders. His even broader, more muscled shoulders, actually. The alpha pulled Cas' sweater up, breaking the kiss just long enough to pull it over his head. Dean be damned if Cas didn't become more beautiful than he already was.
The omega looked up from his book, eyeing his roommate. "Oh, uh," he stuttered out, his cheeks tinting pink. "I was focused on my studies. I didn't notice you walk in."
Dean and Sam carried the queen sized mattress to one of the bedrooms, passing the omega. The alpha gave a wink to the young omega as he watched Dean lustfully. Cas couldn't help but get turned on by Dean sweating, his muscles bulging as he helped carry boxes and furniture.
"Don't even," Cas said, pushing Dean away. "How can you still be sexually attracted to me while I'm this big."
A couple walked in and sat in the table next to Cas and Dean. The red headed beta helped her pregnant, brunette, omega into the chair. The beta looked over at them and smiled.
"He threatened to, and I quote, 'take what I want,'" Cas argued. "You and I both know what he means."
The pregnant omega raised his left hand, showing off the ring. Everyone gasped. Mary shouted in excitement. Cas smiled at how happy Dean's family was.
"I don't know," Lisa shrugged, looking down. "I'd rather have you come back home with us. We can be a happy family. We'll have a house and we'll have more kids running around and I'll make you forget about that teenage whore." She put her hand on Dean's leg, rubbing up and down.
She ran and grabbed them, handing Mary and Dean each a gift. Dean gave them a confused look. Sam pulled out his phone to start recording their reactions.
"How've you been?" Dean queried, patting Cas' shoulder. "I haven't seen you since you were," he paused, looking at Cas up and down, taking in the omega's long legs, thick thighs, decently fit body, up to his blue eyes that are as bright as ever and his dishevelled hair. "Younger," Dean finally breathed out.
Cas relaxed in Dean's arms, burying his face in his chest, basking in the alpha's calming scent. He explained what happened at school with Dick and with the principal. Soon, Dean was contributing to the angry scent in the apartment.
“Cas,” Dean choked, reaching out and trying to touch the other man, feeling a ping of disappointment when his hand went through him, “I know you can’t hear me but I still love you too, and whatever I did, I’m so fucking sorry.”
Dean continued to stare in horror at the stone, until he heard a crunching in the snow. Looking up he was unsettled to find Gabriel looking much like his brother had with a scraggly beard and lengthened hair. However, his hair was clearly dirty and he had deeper bags under his eyes. “Fuck Cas,” Gabriel gasped, falling to his knees in front of the stone. Dean couldn’t see his face, but he assumed he was crying, “this is all that fucking Winchester’s fault! You’re dead and Im broken. And fuck I’m about to do something stupid Cas. Im going to take his brother from him like he did mine. And then I’m going to get rid of him. You won’t ever have to see him either because he’ll be in hell.” Dean wouldn’t get to hear the rest as the world began to swirl and turn.
“It didn’t look like lipstick Dean…” Cas grumbled making Dean chuckle again. Dean sat up and beckoned Cas over. Sliding over and leaning against the wall so there was room for Cas to sit.
“We can move on, go to the next plane of existence or we can watch over your brother until he dies of hopefully old age,” Castiel explained, taking Dean’s hand.
Nervously I watched and waited for Dean to come back in. Preferably without the bloodsucker. I nearly jumped off the couch when I heard Dean yell something at Benny. A profanity to be exact. Yelling from both sides caused Jo to storm over to the door, fuming as she opened the door to find Dean with a black eye. I jumped off the couch and ran over to Dean the second I saw him, meowing as Benny talked again “fine you fucking twit, see if I care! I hope your girlfriend never comes back, I hope he threw himself off suicide bridge.” He spat, walking off leaving a shell shocked Dean behind him.
“Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!” the smaller boy cheered joining his brother at the bottom of the flight of stairs.
“Shut up,” Castiel breathed, “you know you love chick flicks.” And with the last syllable their lips touched for a moment of pure bliss. Which was then ruined by Castiel finally noticing Dean’s horrendous breath. “You need a toothbrush and some coffee.” Dean laughed. Castiel stepped towards the door and leant against the doorframe with a smug grin.
“I should get you home before it’s too late,” Dean told the girl, standing up and dusting his pants off and helping the now confused girl to stand up.
“P-please let me see something good?” Dean asked weakly, his eyes glistening with tears, “I don’t want to think about that man.”
“But you’re also one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and I get my Christmas wish coming true every second I spend with you.”
“Don’t count on it,” Benny smirked, winking at Dean who just rolled his eyes and shooed the older boy. He placed me down and proceeded to put on some tight sweats.
“Fucking hell Cas,” Dean gasped, sitting up and drawing Castiel’s face up for a kiss. Castiel grinned into the kiss, his hands pulling the horny teenager onto his lap and kissing him back, massaging the boy’s hardened prick with his right hand, and his butt with his left.
“Oops…” a beautiful red headed woman said, coming through the door, wincing at the death glare Gabriel was giving her. A death glare that really could kill.
“Why does he want me when there are beautiful women all through the castle, ones like Meg and Hannah and Hael! I’m just a sixteen year old boy…” Dean muttered, still watching the sleeping adult.
“Why are  you miserable Gabe?” Sam asked his best friend, looking at him curiously. Gabe blushed before attempting to escape, but unfortunately for him Sam was a giant so he caught up quickly.
“Please, let me draw you a bath, hot water will help the pain,” the man said, picking Dean up bridal style and placing him gently on the bed before putting his own pants back on and walking over to the bath to draw water.
Okay in my defence… I stopped complaining when I got into Dean’s arms because… holy fuck I had dreamed about it since I was fourteen and realized I was as straight as a squiggle. Dean was the star athlete of my school years. He started off being just my best friend… then as we drifted apart in high school, I realised that I was pretty much in love with him. But the day I meant to confess to him I saw him kissing… Benny Lafitte, his current boyfriend. Dean isn’t completely gay like me. He’s bisexual. And man did he use that to his advantage when we were sixteen. Hell he accidentally knocked up a girl in our year named… Lisa… I think. So naturally I nuzzled into his shirtless glory. He had a nice chiselled body from working in his dad’s shop since graduation. And the best part? He was only in boxers…. Drool! Dean carried me to his room and nudged the door open… to reveal Benny laying on his bed… a blanket covering his crotch… but not well… “Benny… looks what Gabe just left me!” Dean laughed, stroking my head. Good boy I thought. Purring and nuzzling into Dean.
Once again everything began to fade into oblivion. And once again, Dean refused to look away from Cas until he too faded away from Dean’s view and Dean found himself alone in his wardrobe, sitting in the middle of it. It took him almost ten minutes to stand up, but when he finally gained the strength he wandered out of his room and into his lounge room where he sat on the couch with his feet tucked under him.
Over one hundred years ago, a truce was struck between the four kingdoms. However, the current king of the kingdom of the west, Lucifer who was only king through marriage, began to fight with his brother, who was at the current king of the kingdom of the East. So the north sided with the east and the south with the west. And so, a bloody war began, dragging innocents to death and those who were once considered criminals were treated as heroes. The south was ruled by the Winchesters, John Winchester to be, and the favourites of the old kingdom which was ruled by King Chuck over one hundred and twenty years ago. The North was ruled by Queen Linda Tran… she was small but terrifying. The East was ruled by Michael and his younger brothers, and the West by Michael’s twin brother and his wife Lilith. But who cares about them, I want to tell you about Dean Winchester.
“What you said when you came here when you were looking for me…” I elaborated, looking him in the eye. Dean stood up quickly, heading towards the door, his face flaring up.
“Go to hell,” Sam told him, sticking his tongue out and flipping the channel to one of cartoon channels.
Dean Winchester was probably the best doll maker in America; he wasn’t ashamed of that fact either. Although when he started making them his father flipped. John is cool with it now.
He was greeted with the sight of a young couple, not too much older than he was when he passed, the man was tall and handsome. With dark hair and light eyes, he had a gorgeous smile which he wore as he looked down at his female companion adoringly. The woman however was fair haired and had a giant grin on her face as she looked around the entry, she had a simple but beautiful ring on her ring finger signifying they were married. “John it’s perfect!” she laughed, walking over towards where Castiel stood on the staircase, watching the oblivious couple.
“I made it up as a kid, well actually my imaginary friend taught it to me,” Dean told the girl, furrowing his brow and looking up at the girl who looked amused, “god I haven’t thought about my imaginary friend since I was ten.”
“Am I not allowed to feel empathy for my best friend!” Gabe tried, making my eyes widen. Dean’s teasing of them being a couple must have made Gabe very happy then.
“If you want to leave my room naked I'm not protecting you from rapists!” Castiel called after him, making Dean stop dead in his tracks and look down at his naked body. Gabriel was snickering from his place in the doorway whilst he let his eyes rummage over Dean’s body. “Gabe out!” Castiel told his brother, his voice raspier than usual; when he noticed the way his brother was looking at the youngest in the room.
“So who is it?” Cas groaned, not really caring too much. Probably one of the class manwhores, who came out as bisexual the moment their balls dropped.
“Nobody! I-if you want to finish yourself up, I-I’ll look away,” Cas stammered, his face draining of colour completely as a voice outside yelled out ‘where’s that fag, I have a stick to shove up his poof arse!’
“Get lost and go home Benny, before I change my mind and make you work tomorrow,” Dean told the southerner, making him chuckle.
“Dean come.” Castiel told the blushing boy, unbuttoning his pants and pulling out his straining cock, Dean sat on his knees in front of Castiel, licking his lips at the sight of the pre-cum dribbling down Castiel’s cock, “You want to suck it? Drink your fill, I probably won’t be able to give you any for a few days, so suck.” Dean didn’t need to be told twice, getting on his hands and knees and licking the trail of pre-cum. Castiel watched the teen’s green eyes as they filled more and more with lust before his head bobbed down and he swallowed Castiel’s cock as much as he possibly could. And that was a lot despite the cock being larger than average. His mouth watering as he heard Castiel gasp and grasp roughly at Deans hair. “g-good boy.” He pushed out, encouraging the green eyed teen. Swallowing the saliva in his mouth, the amateur cock sucker pushed his mouth  further and further onto the grinning man’s cock, until it hit the back of his throat, causing him to gag but not release the cock. Lightly scraping Castiel’s twitching prick as he slowly pulled it out until the tip came out with a pop. 	Dean licked up the side of the brunette’s erection. The breath in his chest caught as he smelt the musky sent that still hung around Castiel’s phallus from the pre-cum. “Dean?” Castiel asked, concerned about the sudden stop. Dean lunched up into Castiel’s arms kissing him with as much force as he could muster. Wrapping his arms around the teenager’s back,  Castiel pulled the younger onto his lap, deepening the kiss in the process. In very awkward, almost breaking themselves, they removed Dean’s pants, not breaking the kiss once. Lining the smaller over his throbbing erection, Castiel finally broke the kiss to look at the panting blonde who looked at him, his eyes begging for his nice little arse to be filled up. “Who do you belong to?” Castiel growled, making Dean’s eyes widen. Castiel’s hands trailed down Dean’s sides, stopping when they got to his butt to grope it and spread his cheeks, sliding his cock through the gap of the cheeks but not penetrating the begging boy’s arse. “Who do you belong to Dean?” Castiel asked, biting Dean’s collar bone and drawing blood.
When Dean came out of his room he was surprised to find his giant of a little brother standing outside. “Sammy?” he croaked, looking at the shaggy haired teenage boy.
Castiel was cursing, more than usual.  Gabriel had watched as he had all but killed Benny. Gabriel had stood silently, watching as Castiel had refused to hand the passed out boy to the guards and took the feeble looking kid to his room. Dean was five foot and eleven inches, but in Castiel’s arms he seemed like a child. Gabriel had only intervened to tell the Queen what had happened, how they had been friends with Benny who sent them to save the prince. Lies. But he was scared his baby brother would slip up and admit who they were. Gabriel laughed when the Queen told them she wasn’t an idiot. She was glad they had come. She wanted her husband dead although she didn’t know they were the Princes of the East. Castiel had been shocked when the boy had moaned his name in his sleep. But not as shocked as the queen. And definitely not as amused as Gabriel. “Dean is in love with… Castiel?” the queen asked, looking at the brothers, obviously confused.
“Would you say yes?” Castiel asked, leading him over to the bed and pushing him down, pulling the oil out of the draw and setting it on the table.
“It’s not too bad, you won’t need stitches, maybe just a Band-Aid and to keep it clean,” I told him, looking up at his face to find him blushing. “Dean?”
Dean loved his car more than he did Sam. It was a 1967 Chevrolet Impala in black. His father had bought it intending to fix her up, but instead Dean had begun to repair it when we were fourteen until it was ready to go when we were seventeen. He loved it. But he rarely let animals in her. So letting me in was already a surprise… I was just hoping he would just let me sleep on his bed whilst he was out. Climbing into the car he placed me on the passenger seat and roared the car to life. The rumbles of the car sent chills down my spine as I curled up in Dean’s discarded jacket.
Dean, Castiel, Sam and a very sleepy Adam hid in a small alcove of a hall, awaiting Gabriel’s return. The king had been slipped poison that would be beginning to take effect, hopefully meaning that they would believe he died of his sickness in his sleep. Gabriel had snuck off to find the queen and ask her to come with them, after all, she would be the first suspected. Especially if the kids were gone. Castiel was beginning to get nervous, gripping the eldest Winchester’s hand was the only thing keeping him calm. “Cas?” Dean asked, wincing as the grip on his hand began to hurt.
“Cas didn’t you say you were a virgin, you would have told me if you weren’t right?” Dean said his normally deep voice husky from the kissing.
“As you wish,” Gabriel told him, glancing sadly at Dean before he opened his mouth to say something but thought better of it.
“Call me Cas, please,” I gasped, pulling my coat closer to my body with a blush getting a raised eyebrow from Charlie and Dean.
“Cool, can I hold it?” he asked, standing up and slipping into his boxers and walking over to Dean. But when he went to pick me up? I hissed and jumped out of Deans arms, running to the other side of his room and jumping onto his bed, curling up in the bit of bed Dean would have been in.
The first of the children to have a play date was Benny, he thankfully couldn’t see Castiel. But he seemed like a sweet kid, his parents had decided to move to Kansas before Benny started school.  Gabriel came two weeks later, with a bag that was full of candy, Castiel watched as he and Dean ate themselves into food comas before dinner only to get a stern, but amused, lecture from Mary before she made them go to bed. Dean however didn’t fall asleep, so Castiel sat at the end of his bed and sang him the lullaby that he used to sing him when Dean was a baby until Dean fell asleep.
“Cas!!!” Dean screamed, hoping that somehow his master would hear him. Instead he was slapped on the arse causing him to cry out. Thrashing and screaming, Dean tried to escape Benny’s clutches but the man seemingly had super human strength. Dean was a sobbing mess, screaming at the top of his lungs as Benny began to thrust in and out of the teenager. Benny’s nails dug into the sides of the blonde as his thrusts became more and more erratic, hurting the boy more and more until he came inside of the mess that once was Dean.
“So what… you died during the civil war? Is that how you know so much about it?” Dean asked, but Castiel shook his head.
“Stop with your cheesy lines,” Dean groaned, rolling off Castiel onto his back, only to have Castiel throw a leg over his body and straddle his waist.
“I heard his mother is making him do it, she is in charge of the fair after all,” Charlie grinned as they stepped forward.
Castiel Novak died at the age of twenty one in the year 1870. He had been a sickly child, and probably would have died sooner during the civil war if it had not been for him being to sickly to join the fighting. As a ghost he watched his family grieve and then watched as they moved on with their lives. Castiel was the only son of a rich merchant during the 1800s, and his sister Anna ended inheriting everything. But Anna’s family was cut short with her three sons who died during the first world war. So their home fell into disrepair and Castiel wandered the halls alone as it was forgotten. That is until the home was bought by a young family. And that is where the story begins.
“I-I don’t know, I mean only I can see you… and I can’t touch you,” Dean muttered. Castiel sighed, and closed his eyes.
The alternate ending which is a little less sad and a lot more confusing because I am officially sleep deprived.
“Can we just go before I say something stupid?” Dean blushed, grabbing Castiel’s hand and dragging him out the door and to his car.
“Cute little kitten… where did it come from?” Sam asked, picking me up off Dean’s stomach and holding me up to look at my face.
“Makes it sound- Cas it is a dirty thing man!” Dean cried, “I thought you would have gotten that by now!” Dean went to shove Cas away, suddenly feeling disgusted with himself. But before he could do anything about it Cas’ hand was softly placed on his crotch, making him gasp. “C-Cas stop!” Dean croaked, succeeding in pushing Cas away. “What are you doing?”
“Can I just go home now,” Dean asked, not taking his eyes of Cas as Cas ate one of Gabriel’s cookies, grinning at his little brother who managed to look insulted by the act. Dean continued to stare even as the world around him went dark, he continued to watch Cas, his heart skipping a beat when Cas looked up, unknowingly locking eyes with him before fading away too.
“Why? I didn’t know you were lactose intolerant.” Castiel smirked, shedding his shirt and beginning to unbutton Dean’s.
“Get your girlfriend to leave and I will explain,” Castiel begged, “please, I’m scared.” Castiel wasn’t lying, but the look of regret that dawned on Dean’s face was not an expression Castiel ever wanted to cause Dean.
“Lil’ Cas?” Lucifer asked, raising an eyebrow at Dean who blushed awkwardly under the watch of the room full of people.
“Gabe stop,” Sam warned, looking unamused, “I told you all I invited my brother, Cas was just being polite bringing him a gift so that Dean isn’t left out.”
The first thing he did that day was go to the soup kitchen to see Benny, it was early in the morning and few people were nearby, but Benny was already in the kitchen stirring away at whatever he  had made for the people that day. “Benny?” he asked timidly, watching as a shocked Benny almost dropped his spoon into the boiling hot soup.
“So,” Dean began after chugging the water, he elongated the o, trying to figure out where to begin in his quest for redemption, hoping to find the right words to not completely end his friendship. “What exactly… what exactly happened last night? I mean I can guess some things, my waist fucking kills and I don’t even want to begin to question where my socks are…”
“H-how?” Mary asked, rushing over and looking at Castiel, “you even look like he did in the portraits I saw!”
“He thought I was having an affair with you,” Dean bit, his eyes watering again, but he wouldn’t shed a tear.
“I-I,” the girl stammered, before all but lunging herself at Dean. They sat there making out for a few moments before he slid his hand up to her midsection and pulling her closer. His mouth and tongue easily dominating the less experienced girl. Carefully pushing her down into a lying position, Dean kept himself from crushing her as his moved his mouth down her neck, leaving a trail of hickeys down her neck and chest until he reached her low cut top before returning to her mouth and leaving her breathless. He only pulled away to ask her if it was alright. “I lied about having a boyfriend, I'm a virgin,” she admitted quickly, not looking sure about what they were about to do. Dean felt himself go white before he pulled himself away from the flustered girl.
“Well you’ve definitely grown at least a foot! Your old man would be proud!” Benny told the blushing boy before looking up at Castiel and walking over to him, holding out his hand to shake the other man’s hand. “Nice to see you Castiel, what’s it been… ten years?”
“Gabe, is this about the other Winchester boy? I know you remember spending time with him when he was little, but you really can’t get too attached to the enemy,” Michael told him, looking at the territory map.
“And stare at it so adoringly,” Samandriel pipped up, instantly shrinking back when Cas glared at him.
“First you wish to be a cat because Dean doesn’t notice you. Now you want to be turned back?” a frustrated voice asked. Drawing my attention to a man who was at the door. I say man but he couldn’t have been bigger than me. And had a pair of bat wings protruding from his back.
“Y-you’re Castiel, fuck, just my luck I get sold to a man who likes to rape virgins!” Dean spat angrily. Castiel, hearing the younger man’s bitter words stopped the water and walked back over to the bed, climbing on top of Dean and straddling his waist, his still painfully hard member brushing against Dean’s skin, causing the latter to freak out and attempt to hit the other man who just grabbed his hands and held them in place with one hand, keeping one free.
“R-right,” Cas hastily agreed, quietly sitting on the empty love seat and staring at his hands quietly. Dean walked over to him, watching as he wrung his hands together nervously.
“I would too, but… luckily for you I’ll never get bored of fucking you.” Castiel laughed, kissing Dean who kissed him back happily.
“But you know I'm a whore when it comes to your cock,” Dean breathed, lifting himself up to fuck himself with Castiel’s cock, only to have Castiel thrust in at full force as he dropped himself down, making the impact on his prostate strong enough to make him cry out.
“T-this was the last Christmas before mum…” Dean whispered his voice cracking before he could finish the sentence so rather than finishing it he chose to follow the brothers as they ran into the living room and gaped at the tree and all the presents underneath.
“Either way you got to your little brother,” the ghost muttered, “of course they were having problems anyway, but you just gave Sam bad advice and your little brother listened.”
“Nah, I literally just got into bed,” Dean admitted, lying back down, “seriously though… what did you wanna ask me man?”
“I love you by the way,” Castiel told his husband, rolling onto his side to look at him. Dean copied his brunet, raising an eyebrow.
“Seriously this is not a day I’d like to remember!” Dean yelled, staring at the door in horror. The world around him seemed frozen as the door opened, revealing the school’s headmaster Alistair as he entered the room, a sleazy grin on his face. Crowley snapped his fingers, making the scene fizzle into darkness, his face full of uncharacteristic concern.
As the world around Dean began to spin this time he squeezed his eyes shut, begging any deity he could think of that this was all just a dream. “Dean.” At the sound of the spirit’s voice, Dean opened his eyes to find himself in Sam and Gabriel’s apartment, however unlike at the Christmas he had witnessed earlier this time the apartment was dark and cold, the only life was Sam sitting in the corner which had been turned into a little office. He was hunched over papers upon papers, his brows furrowed together in frustration. He looked dishevelled, his facial hair thick but not too long, and his hair barely touching his shoulder.
“According to a very amused Gabriel you were attempting to climb the drainage pipe and kept falling, Gabriel also mentioned offering to let you in.” Dean turned beet red, a vague, blurry image of Gabriel at the kitchen window appearing in his mind.
Dean was beginning to freak out when a woman in a white and blue gown, similar to the ones he found in his home walked up to him through the crowd of women in bras and panties with the mysterious thin fabric attached to have some level of modesty. “Dean Winchester, come with me,” the woman told him, grabbing him by the wrist and dragging him through the doors of that room. She was mumbling something to herself that Dean was unable to catch anything but ‘incompetent’, ‘personal’ and ‘fuck’ from. The woman was shorter than the teenager, he was just over six foot, and had a bit more growing to do, but this woman was clearly past her growth time, being mid to late twenties at least. She had curly reddish-brown hair that fell to her shoulders and her skin was freckled from the sun.
“Fucking Gabr-Gabe…” Dean said, almost saying the name of the prince who accompanied him and Castiel there.
“Suck it,” the man growled shoving it into the whimpering boy’s face. Dean shook his head, he only wanted Castiel’s dick. Wait.
“I saw him take it out after we got here… wasn’t meant to, he wants to keep you all to himself, can’t say I blame him to be completely honest…”
Even though Castiel had come to terms that he was a homosexual a long time ago, a very long time ago, when he realized he had a crush on his father’s coachman when he was sixteen. He had not had another one of those… impure thoughts since he had died. He had hoped those perversions had died along with his body. “Dean,” the girl called out, sitting on the piano then laying across it in an attempt to be sexy.
“Fucking hell Dean,” I cried, pulling him closer to me and kissing him. “Fuck me, I don’t care how. I don’t care if I'm top or bottom. I just want you.”
Staring in awe Dean wandered closer to the kitchen, watching Benny was surrounded by pots and pans, doing what he did best – cooking. “Mr cooking person?” a young, female voice asked making Dean stop in his tracks and look at the young girl who was holding an empty bowl.
“Either way he won’t want to kiss a guy!” I tried, not sure if I was trying to get out of it for me or him. I’ll admit I have had a crush on Dean for the past five years. He was talented, he was intelligent, he was religious (not as much as my parents), and he was absolutely undeniably beautiful. He was in reality my perfect man. minus the fact that he was straighter then… whatever the straightest thing in the world is.
Flash. I’m engulfed in darkness. Blinking, I find no - there’s no darkness they just turned off those god forsaken lights. God I had a headache.
This time when the spinning world came to a halt, Dean was surprised to find himself outside of his and Benny’s restaurant. Only it was open and filled with people. “This place seems busy,” Dean gasped, “I guess firing Benny was a good move?”
“Dean!” the imaginary voice in Dean’s head called, closing his eyes Dean was wishing that it was Castiel’s dick choking him. Tears slipped out of his eyes as he heard the voice getting further away as Benny face fucked him.
