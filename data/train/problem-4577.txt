"How do I look mom?" Was the first thing he asked. Mary came forward and touched his face which was cold.
"Hey it's me." Dean said as he hugged the other boy.
"How did you find me?"
"Don't you fucking dare mess with me or my Cas."
"Oh stop it. Stop daydreaming about those Chinese men."
"Yes, he's my best friend and I like him," Castiel says.
Dean didn't recognize the man before him but he seemed to know him.
"To my friend's daughter of course. We talked about it."
"Hey you okay there?" Dean asked Cas who was fidgeting the phone in his hands not sure whether he should text them first or should give them more time.
"It's j-just my f-family."
"Yeah." Cas chuckled. Cas didn't know why Dean asked about her because as Dean was a vampire, he would have to choose a mate.
Jody had an unreadable expression as if she wasn't expecting that Dean liked an angel.
"Hey!! Did you miss me?" A girl's voice came from behind. It was his best friend Lisa.
"I promised that I would never leave you, didn't I?" Cas nodded. Dean hugged the crying boy.
: Is it what I think it is dad?
They waited and waited.
Dean talked to a guy named Garth, a blonde girl named Emily and Charlie's room mate Rowena.
"I hate today. I didn't have time to even breathe."
"Sure. But how'd you know where I was placed?" Dean asked. Lisa being too near, was dangerous. Even though he was drinking blood, the blood from the vein was more delicious. Dean felt thirsty, thirsty for Lisa's blood. He drank the rest of the bottle in one go and wiped his mouth so there won't be any remains.
"Who the hell are you?" Sam asked.
Castiel sighed and let Dean talk to the girls.
Cas looked up confused.
"Thank you." Sam replied and went in, Dean behind him.
"You know you can't pull that look off well right?" Cas asked with a smile playing on his lips. Dean nodded.
Dean decided to buy a gift for his boyfriend and so he did.
"What are you talking about?"
But how had this happened? The last time was because he had Leviathans inside him. What was the reason now?
"Fuck." Castiel cursed and cupped Dean's face, healing on a molecular level. He felt something foreign while healing him. It was as if Dean had been drinking too much. Like too much. Castiel always watched Dean. He made sure Dean didn't drink that much. How had this happened?
: Oh ya right. Thanks Winchester. Be there in 30 mins.
Dean was about to say something while the whisper spoke again.
"Then....will you tell him?"
"Castiel. Castiel Novak."
Dean looked down and blinked off some tears and looked back up. Castiel was still standing there. Dean extended his arm and touched Cas's face, and this time no one faded away.
As Cas was walking, someone grabbed his hand and pulled him into an abandoned classroom. It was dark with only the light from the windows and Cas couldn't identify who the person was until they spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was Lisa.
"When you challenged the highest mafia group, me being the leader should be here, shouldn't I?" Cas asked as he smirked.
"I came out to my family. My dad didn't take it well. Even Nick and Michael came out and that only made my father even angrier. I don't know what to do."
"It's me. Meet me after classes at 4.30pm."
Charlie was majoring in art and she only concentrated on it so she would be successful in the future and earn. So she had completely different classes except art which she shared with Dean.
"You stupid dumbass. How didn't you not notice that I fucking like you?" Cas poked Dean's head. Dean rubbed the spot.
Don't ness with your brother's boyfriend especially when he is an angel.
"Hey, do you want to go on a date with me?" He asked nervously.
"Good." Cas said as went to unpack his things.
"We were under the bright blue sky, pointing out different shapes of the clouds and you said I left you when you told me who you were and before you could complete the sentence, everything changed. A woman with white hair stood and she told me to take care of you and never to hurt you. She told me you are precious to her and I got up and saw that you weren't there. I thought someone took you away."
"I don't know."
Come say hi to me @castielmyheaven on Tumblr. I would love to talk to you guys üñ§
"Arrange a meeting with the phoenix as early as possible."
. He/she was related to the mother of all. That's all I got to know."
Dean looked up and turned to Sam for an answer. Sam felt uncomfortable. All the three were looking at him.
"Now I have art class. Take care of yourself alright? If something happens just call me yeah?" Dean said as he kissed Cas on the forehead. Cas blushed and nodded.
life with his baby angel and now it just got more complicated.
Charlie and her roommate Rowena were helping each other and they even did a group study with Lisa in the library.
"Sorry guys, the line was too long." Dena said as he gave them the drinks.
"You said you can feel him right? Is he.." Sam trailed off. It wasn't the right thing to ask if Dean was okay. He surely wasn't.
: FiNe.
Happy reading üíú
"How are you feeling Dean?" Castiel asked.
Dean thought for a moment thinking about what the whisper told him and answered. "I'm not sure. What do you think?"
Cas couldn't stop crying, he left so bad and dirty. Justin's words were repeating in his head again and again and again.
"Wait!! I know something we could do. Come on." Charlie pulled Cas with him knowing Dean would find them.
"Oh hey, Garth. This is Jody and this is Clarie. Girls, this is Garth and Bess." Sam introduce them. They shook hands.
"What's up?" Dean replied as cooly as he could.
There was no whooshing, no flutter of wings, no response. Dean was getting frustrated now.
It was almost a year, and Sam knew Dean prayed to Cas every night as he heard Dean talking and ending up crying.
"It's sooo good to see the Winchesters. Sam you grew tall. I'm just happy to see ya both. Come meet the special guys." Garth said excitedly and led them to where the two babies were there.
"You know, I always wanted to talk to you back at school. ¬†But I just couldn't. I was too scared.." Castiel confessed.
"Do you want to talk about what happened?"
"Good night, little angel."
"It's okay Sam. Can you do me a favor?" Castiel asked. "Anything, just name it," Sam said with determination. Castiel smiled.
"You like him don't ya?" Sam asked Castiel who looked like he was interested in the book he was reading but gave off the vibes that he hated reading the book.
Dean and Cas turned around to see the girl running towards them. She stopped infront of them and was panting, catching her breath.
"Uh... nowhere. Just was exploring town instead of sitting here." Sam replied and everyone brought the lie.
"Did you call me 'baby Vampire' ?" Dean asked, giggling. Cas blushed.
"That's right Charlie. We're officially best buddies now." Dean winked at Cas who blushed.
Dean slowly approached the duo.
"I understand, Cas. But I'm coming with you."
Dean looked around and saw there were no empty seats. He was thinking where else to sit.
Dean pushed Castiel on the bed and climbed beside him and just cuddled with him for a while.
"On one condition." Cas had given up, he didn't like to argue with his father. His father nodded telling him to say what it was.
"Look at my face and tell me if I'm joking."
"Okay."
"No one walked in Winchester. We were listening to the sweet talk of you three. Since we have better ears. We thought of killing the guy who was insisting on coming first no one did. And then you guys barged in." As soon as Dean heard this he cut off the head of the vampire.
Cas was shocked and so was Dean, inside the car.¬† What? Dean's accident was made by his OWN mother? So heartless.
"Okay go ahead. But don't remind me of you dying again or I will kill you." Dean threatened him. Castiel laughed loudly for the first time in a long time. Dean loved seeing Castiel laugh. He was. glad he made him laugh.
"H-How did you know?" Dean asked ,taking deep breathes as his father had taught him. It was helping.
Dean started to complete his homeworks while Cas was using his moblie phone.
"It's okay. But yeah my mom says that I had stopped eating for a few days but eventually with my brother's cheering me up, I got over and here I am." Castiel sighed. Dean thought it was because he remembered his sister's death.
Dean didn't know what to say but just hugged the boy back.
"Oh you're not well. We should go back." Cas exclaimed. Dean stopped him.
"Hey Dean. I understand why you left me..... But can we at least be friends?" Lisa asked. Castiel just walked away to Charlie not wanting to interfere with their talks.
Dean nodded. "It's perfect. It's huge though."
"Are you joking? We went to same school remember? ¬†And you were the famous one. Who wouldn't know you?" Castiel replied and goes towards the unoccupied bed.
: oh you'll know soon. üòè
: General Knowledge. This was compulsory for all and they had to write it no matter what. Dean didn't understand the need to write that in college but he didn't have a choice now did he?
"Dean!! Open up."
"I don't want to worry you but I hate not telling you." Dean said. He didn't want Cas to know that Dean was feeling that someone was watching them or him. But he just couldn't hide it from Cas.
"So, when did you get your inheritance?" Charlie asked when she saw that they were the only two and no one was lingering near them.
"I'm sorry. And take care of yourself, yeah? My flight's in half an hour."
"Yeah. Can you tell me what happened? I mean you said you don't remember anything of before ." Sam asked.
"Hey, Dean. Looks like Jody and Clarie are here." Sam yelled to him.
"Justin."
"So, you have no problem of me being a vampire?"
"Whatever."
"Umm yeah I think so."
"He doesn't love you, who loves a nerd like you. You're just his pass time. He will leave you after he's used you."
"Do you really want me to?" Dean asked.
Follow me on Tumblr @castielmyheaven and do say hi. I will be the most happiest. üñ§
"Yeah sorry."
"But...B-But why?" Castiel saw tears rolling down her face. He remembered how supportive she was when she posted their pictures on social media and helped them in school when haters were always picking on them.
"Hey, Sam. I found a case here and uh....well since I became a dad a few days back I am in no shape to go hunting. Can you guys help me this once?" Sam heard desperation and pleading in his voice. Going there would be a change for Dean. Even if doesn't want to kill anything.
"Oh....I- uh...good luck I guess." Dean stuttered which Castiel thought was cute and adorable. Dean left the kitchen as fast as possible after drinking the coffee.
"You'll still love me right? You won't leave me?"
Cas shrugged.
"What?"
"Oh so you are the boss?" Mary asked and laughed as she saw a short man getting out of the car.
Dean pulled Cas onto his lap. He ignored the looks of others who had arrived at the cafeteria.
"Hey, Jody! Sam waved.
"I know it's none of my business but please, we need to unpack and get settled. Come back later." Castiel said still with the same cold voice, no trace of anger or annoyance.
"Sure. I would love to know me. My shift ends in an hour. We'll meet at the cafe out there?" Steve says pointing to the coffee shop on the opposite side of the road.
"About the information.....the Winchesters are the phoenix? How? Dean doesn't seem to know about it."
"Where are they going?" Dean heard Lisa ask but he didn't care answering her.
"Hey um..don't you wanna drink..?" Cas trailed off indicating blood. Dean realised he was famished and the thought of blood made him crazy. Before he could do anything to Cas, he opened his bag and took out another bottle of red juice and drank it slowly, enjoying every drop.
"Tell me the truth. Now."¬† Cas took out his phone and dialed Meg's number.
"Happy Birthday!" Claire wished and hugged him too.
Hope you liked the story. Leave a kudos and let me know in the comments if you like it. It is much appreciated from you guys. Thank you for reading. Much love. üñ§
: Oh my god, I'm so happy. Dad, I was correct. Damn it no one believed me. I'm so happy.
"Hey sshh. Don't cry, my baby vampire. I'm not leaving you, do you understand?"
"Is he your son?" Dean asked.
And it worked. Dean chuckled. "You do that."
"Enlighten me, Demon." Cas growled in much more anger.
They were still there talking to each other and making jokes when Lisa joined them, panting for breath.
"Hey, it's me." Sam assured.
and in some years Before Christ there was someone who went by the name
Dean did the same.
Hope you enjoy this, please do leave comments and kudos, it's very much appreciated.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Sam woke up early in the morning to see Cas just sitting with a cup of coffee in his hand sipping it carefully one sip at a time. Sam smirked and walked over to him.
"I didn't know I could do that until I tried."
Four of them sat at their usual table and Dean and Castiel took the same dinner as before. Charlie got an ice-cream. God knows why there was ice cream for dinner. Lisa took a burger.
Dean came out of his thoughts as baby came to a halt.
"It's not. My father kicked me out Dean."
"My name's Justin. Do you want to go out with me sometime? For a coffee or something?" The boy asked shifting from one leg to the other frequently. Cas didn't understand. Go out for a coffee? With a person he didn't know? No.
‚≠êOkay so I just wanted to tell you guys that I'm posting the same story on Wattpad too so if you're interested or like to read it there, you can
Dean told Cas to take a shower as he could smell werewolf scent on him. Cas didn't question.
The cold wind hit him, the Cresent moon shining brightly with its twinkling stars beside him.
"Dominant one my ass. I can be dominant too." Cas pouted. Dean loved the sight. He leaned forward and bit Cas' lower lip causing him to gasp which soon turned out to be a makeout session.
"Her college was taking them on a trip and this girl here didn't go and instead found a case here and I'm assuming you're here for that too."Jody said still not okay with Clarie being here.
"Please tell me, this isn't gonna be every morning?" Dean groaned as the little puppy barked in its cute little voice which wasn't so scary.Castiel laughed. Then they heard Sam scream and they rushed outside.
Happy reading and sorry if there are any errors. üíúüíú
The next morning, Dean took a long hot shower. He felt light and got dressed and ran down to the living room where his parents and his brothers were eagerly waiting for him. He still had two hours until he had to pack his bags and leave for college.
During their lunch break, they both took their lunch and headed to sit down and thankfully some seats were still empty. Dean choose the last corner seat. Cas had no objection.
And no one disturbed them the whole day.
And the four of them decided to get some snacks. Since it wasn't dinner time yet, there were only chocolates, chips, cool drinks, milk etc.
"Hey, Cas. Glad you agreed to talk to me. Hope I did not disturbed you from your schedules." Sam said as he sat down infront of Cas.
"Where's Dean?"
My Tumblr : @castielmyheaven
"Today was just an introductory class. We just got to know the others and were made partners." Dean said shrugging.
"We've got a case and our friend needs help. I agreed because it will be a change for you as you've not gotten out of this bunker since...."
"I was asking if you'd want to get a drink ?" Dean asked and Castiel nodded.
"No, why would I be?"
"I'm sorry."
"Look, you may be a badass angel but let us go this time," Dean says and Sam stays neutral. He enjoyed seeing his brother and best friend arguing. It was cute.
"Dean! Don't listen to him. He's a demon and they lie. I hate to say this but we didn't see Cas's body right? Don't give up hope. Look at me, Dean." Dean heard Sam say and he thought. Demons lie, yes. He didn't have a place for his hope of miracle anymore. His angel was dead according to the assumed demon. Wait. Why was Sam so desperately telling Dean not to assume anything? Did he know something about Castiel that he didn't?
The rest of the day went pleasantly, Dean saw Lisa in two of his classes she looked sad but he knew she was a strong girl and would get through this.
"Can't I come see my boyfriend?" She laughed.
Sam and Castiel studied in the library about the different new creatures and discussed some spells from Rowena's book of spells. Sam was really glad that Rowena hadn't died and was ruling hell like a badass queen.
Dean ended up buying three more rounds of them for Cas and two more for him and Lisa.
"Don't leave me again."
"I'm leaving."
"I-I am Sam. Sam Winchester." Sam said and cleared his throat.
"I'm sorry angel but I thought someone took you away from me." Dean hugged him tighter.
"Um...no. why?"
"Hey Ca-"¬† She was cut off by Cas speaking.
One hour passed slowly for Sam. He was getting impatient and eager to talk to Cas. Dean will get back to normal.
Cas looked at Charlie. He couldn't say it. That would only make him believe that.
"He's broken Cas. You disappeared suddenly. I'll take you to meet him tomorrow okay? See if you can remember anything else beforehand but don't strain yourself." Sam said and Castiel nodded.
"Cas..." She muttered but Dean could hear her clearly.
"I thought.....I thought we were gonna complete college together and marry one day. Have kids. What changed Dean? Did I do something?" Lisa asked controlling herself from crying.
"What did you do to him?" Dean asked growling with anger.
"Promise?"
Lisa's eyes widened. "Was that you Dean?" She asked. Dean nodded.
"I think something's wrong," Sam said as Castiel hadn't come back out yet.
"Nrghh...." Cas was trying to unzip his pants. Dean had to help him because he didn't know what was going on with Cas.
Sam didn't know what to think of this but this was surely Castiel. Sam breathed a relieved sigh. The voice was Dean. He heard Dean. He still can feel him. Sam was beyond happy.
"What? I didn't bite you?"
"I'm sorry Cas." Sam's voice broke. This was never his intention. He felt like killing himself for doing this to his only brother who cared about him.
"Oh okay. Then next week?"
"It's Garth's house. Don't you remember?" Sam asked with a small smile plastered on his face.
"Okay."
Dean looked at Charlie to say something when her eyes widened. Dean looked back in that direction to see Cas, he saw Cas was crying. Dean stood up and Cas ran to him and hugged him.
Just when Dean was about to snap, Castiel looked at Dean and opened a small box. Castiel came forward and rested his forehead with Dean's. He gave the box to Dean who opened it and gasped looking at the contents in it.
Cas and Charlie were singing along and were dancing slightly.
: Alright we'll be there. Can I bring Charlie? Or can we even tell the girls?
"Old man my ass. I'm 18."
His parents were scared whether they could see their son open his eyes.
"How did you get this?"
"Don't worry Dad. I'll take care of myself. If something happens I'll tell you guys and Sammy can beat them for me. Ain't that right Sammy?" Dean asked smiling widely.
"What do you want?"
"Um..." Dean looked around and got the paper on which his classes were printed.
The others came to the room as well.
Cas instantly noticed something off with Dean.
By 5 in the evening, both the boys were done organising thier things. Dean was not the "organising type" but since Cas asked him, he did it. Cas did it for him actually.
"A slice of cherry pie." Dean said looking lovingly at the pie. Cas laughed at his reaction and ordered the slice of pie and two veg Sandwiches for himself.
The day went in a blur. He could smell the sweet blood of his brother. It took everything in him to not go and just suck out all the blood. Dean was exhausted by the time night came.
"Ooops, I forgot he was also your boy toy. Pity. I bet you would've loved to see him scream when I tortured him. They were just blissful. I took my sweet time and killed him piece by piece. I think you'd deserve this as your boy toy took away someone I dearly cared for." The demon laughed and Sam shot multiple bullets at him. But nothing happened.
Castiel nodded. "Yes, I died. And was brought back. I don't by who. Maybe God. I didn't remember anything except for the lingering foreign sadness and hurt. I used to hear whispers every night. Now I know it was you." Castiel stooped to look at his beautiful freckle-faced boyfriend. Dean blushed remembering how badly he wanted Cas back. Dean leaned forward and kissed Castiel softly.
The boys drove on towards the Lemp Mansion after a food pit stop at a cheap burger joint. Dean scoffed a double cheeseburger faster than you could say "Poughkeepsie" as Cass awkwardly watched the hunter eat. Once Dean had got some well needed cholesterol into his system, the pair got back on the road.
"You happy now?" The demon raised his hands in the air and changed his yellow peepers
'Purgatory courthouse', it read clear as day. According to that sign they were in fact in a purgatory, just not the one the were familiar with who would have thought?
"Um can I ask a question I'm not sure I want answered" Dean turned to the unsolved boys.
"Come on, I'll take you fellas there" Doc told the boys to follow him.
"Everyone is trying
"Did I not say I had a problem on my hands fellas... I guess I shouldn't have spoke of the Devil's now should I" The barman smiled weakly at Cass and Dean as he came out from behind the counter, to face the gang of brutes in the middle of the bar. "Is that correct sir?" He said calmly. "Well what if I say that bone will be remaining unpicked, what then huh?" They said squaring up to the stocky man. The largest of the men emitted a freakish guttural noise from his throat in response to the barkeeps unwavering attitude.
Just then Lucifer realised the presence of the matching gold bands on the hunter and the Seraph's fingers. Oh this day keeps getting better and better he thought to himself.
Heaven is a place
Cass scanned the snow covered area the had been transported to, looking for a place to gather their bearings. Dean followed him towards a collection of buildings down a main road that seemed to be in the centre of whatever place they were in. As they got closer to the largest building in the street the Angel noticed something interesting written above the landmark.
"Oh Shanes just grabbing our bags out of the car. He'll be up in a second. Sorry do you mind telling me where the restroom is? I've had a very long car ride over here" Ryan looked relieved as Dean pointed to a door at the end of the hallway and hurried off to relieve himself.
"Jesus Christ, you said that's what you were most afraid of in life in an episode" Ryan was piecing the narrative together allowed.
"What are you doing here?" Cass shouted with venom in his tone.
"Oh you guys are a couple, sorry I didn't realise" Ryan apologised.
"I didn't say that Shane" The smaller man shuffled awkwardly, not wanting to admit that was exactly the thing he had been thinking to himself. That proved how well Shane knew him and it stung.
"I'm Shane" He stated tiredly.
"Of course, night Sammy" He added.
"And you're the very picture of a normally functioning man then?" Cass snipped at Dean, whose only reply to this was simply a hurt sounding "dude!".
[Ryan] Dude, I'm (chuckles nervously) I'm so nervous.
"Sorry man driver picks the music shotgun shuts his cakehole, thems the rules" Dean smirked to himself.
"So no ones figured out your not human yet?" Castiel pondered aloud.
"Doesn't matter what you call the sons of bitches you still can take em out the same way, isn't that right Cass" Dean used this statement to get a read on whether Cass understood his earlier foot kicking signal to which Cass nodded in agreement. (You know I can read your mind right? Cass told Dean to which Dean thought dude that's creepy don't be all up in my fortress of Dean-itude it's bad vibes man! But.. While your up in my business I don't think this guy is talking in metaphors for all its worth.) Cass nodded in agreement with Dean's inner dialogue deduction.
"BEEZ" The spirt box began to say Shane's true name.
"How are you gonna do that?" Ryan queryied.
Castiel slipped out his phone and checked his balance online.
"He's the Captain of the Starship Minestrone in the hotdoga, commissioned by Ryan Steven Bergara" Shane stated.
"I still can't totally wrap my head around it all. So Lucifer was an angel but he was bad so bad Angels are a thing so it should make sense that good demons exist too but it sounds ridiculous even saying it." Ryan admitted.
"I hate to agree but yeah he's got a point. My brother Sam's the same height as him" Dean told them.
"Wow, he never shows this kind of enthusiasm during investigations. What did you guys do to him" Ryan joked unaware of the little bust up the boys had while he was fiddling with camera equipment upstairs.
"Ryan?" Dean turned to the smaller man.
Shane looked shooked about the ambush, but with little effort he forced the ghost of William Jr off of him and leap to his feet.
"In 1975, the old mansion was purchased by Dick Pointer and his family. Immediately they began to renovate the building, turning it into a restaurant and inn. Workers within the house often told stories of apparitions, strange sounds, vanishing tools, and a feeling of being watched. Frightened by the hauntings, many would leave the job site never to return. The property is said to be haunted by several members of the Lemp family. The area of the property with the most activity is what the staff refers to as, 'The Gates of Hell' in the basement. It is this area of the basement that used to be the entrance to the caves running below the mansion and the brewery" Cass recited the Wikipedia pages entry for the Mansion from memory.
"There's something wrong here" Cass stated ominously.
"Much obliged, I am that unfortunate age" Doc rolled his eyes to the heavens. "I did not perish like it was so reported. I suffered a worse fate you could say, trapped in a well for years with no end in sight."
"So you guys are real life ghostbusters?" Ryan looked dazzled at the thought.
"Hey" Ryan mumbled tiredly, as he opened the door to Shane. Something in his head chirped up "You know what kind of person opens doors they know a demon is on the other side of? A LUNATIC". They tried to ignore this inner voice however and continued what they were doing despite its sound reasoning.
"I suppose your right" he admitted, it's very hard to disagree with the man you hauled out of hell no matter how hard you wanted to.
Fuck he's right, Dean thought to himself. He wanted to smack that arrogant dick in the face. He stared them down.
"Nothing, they did nothing now come on you fucking scaredy cat. We've got ghosts to bust" Shane motioned for Ryan to sit down in front of the camera in the front room to film their introduction for the episode.
"Cass doesn't really care about Chucks approval and honestly I second that" Dean explained to Shane.
Dean put on a friendly smile.
"Um Cass buddy, what are you doing?" Dean said through gritted teeth, starting to worry that they'll get jailed for assault.
Ryan looked pale. "A D-demon" he stammerd"
"Well yeah, I saw how the guy died it wasn't a fun ocassion for anyone involved" The demon stated.
"Wait so purgatory is actually a real thing too?" Ryan's eyes grew wide as he tried to conceptualise this fact.
"You know what I mean Dean. We have to be on our guard...I don't trust them" Cass shot the demon a glance.
"So who are you then" Ryan squinted at his co-host.
"Fair enough" Shane nodded acceptingly "Where then?" He said.
"Do something" Dean shouted at the demon, as Elsa Lemp's ghost ugly cried into his face.
Castiel and Dean nodded. "Yes we knew" Castiel told him.
"And how are you doing that exactly" The Winchester asked skeptically.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm doing research!" He beamed back at Dean "and I think I've found us a new case"
"Goodnight Ryan" Shane waved to his buddy.
"Thank you" he sighed.
'What kind of evil do you gotta do to get kicked out of hell?" Dean asked, skin crawling at the thought of what fucked up crap you'd need to do for that to happen.
"Fine you wanna play dirty? Lets go billy!" Shanes real eyes flickered into view, as he banished the spirt from the room by using his demonic powers.
"Yeah family business alright, but no he's too young for all this. My brothers baby sitting tonight. We don't live on the premise, we live a good drive away actually" Dean remembered that tedious eight hour drive from Lebanon. Then it hit him, oh boy. They were gonna have to do it all over again to get back home.
"I need to see it right away, I'll ask him to send me a picture now" Cass took out his phone and messaged Jack instructing him to send a photo of their new pet at once.
'I didn't imagine it Shane! Okay fine forget about the toothpaste bag, what was poking me in the face then if it wasn't a ghost hmm?" Shane stared back at Ryan, with no witty comeback leaving his lips for once.
"Oh my god Shane it doesn't sound like Lizzo" Ryan argued tiredly.
"The opposite actually. I wasn't being bad enough and my siblings kinda covered up my existence, you know the bad apple metaphor. Well, I guess this is a good Apple metaphor. Call the English majors about that one." Shane shrugged.
"Exactly, you won't even miss out on anything it's gonna be a snooze fest trust me" Dean assured him.
The room fell silent as the group regained their collective breath after getting roughed up by the Lemp family ghosts.
"He's not just any man he's Doc freaking holiday Cass!" Dean's inner fanboy was running wild "How are you still alive? You'd be what 169 by now and if you don't mind me saying but you don't look a day over forty-four" Dean complimented the moustachioed man.
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
"Having a pet is a lot of responsibility Jack you understand that right?" Dean really didn't know how much responsibility that entailed since he never had a pet growing up. Holy shit, he realised this was his first family let at forty. Damn he was getting old.
The boys finished their beers and started actually filming content for the episode of unsolved.
"That it has babe. How long has it been since we had some quality uninterrupted alone time hmm? Dean rubbed his partners arm fondly
"I'll be fine, I can get a sundae. That has some fruit in it at least" Sam smiled weakly. What's so wrong with being healthy around here he mused to himself. Jack runs on sugar and Dean on cholesterol and Cass well it's Cass. He doesn't need food to survive. In comparison to the rest of the bunker boys diets, he was a health nut.
"Huh?" Dean shook himself back to the present moment.
"Oh yes right. Demon Hell right okay, that's gonna take a while to get used to. Oh boy" The ghost hunter was trying his best to keep somewhat composed.
"Wait how can you be a demon? Shane we got excorcisms together for fuck sake" Ryan
"I on the other hand think it's a brilliant design choice, keep out the tall freaks" Ryan laughed.
"Okay I'm not saying you're wrong but, statistically speaking it's gonna be the guy who doesn't show their face on camera right" Sam insisted, totally saying that Dean was wrong but doing it nicely.
"I am Doc Holliday" They insisted with Dean.
"I don't know Dean, it's not very likely" Cass said skeptically.
"Lemp's extra pale" Cass read the label of the bottle before he sampled the contents. Castiel had become a social drinker due to living with Sam and Dean for so long, but he didn't enjoy the flavour of any alcoholic beverage. Frankly any food stuff tasted like molecules to him, and for him to get any bit intoxicated he needed to drink at least a liquor store worth of booze. Still, he enjoyed spending time with Dean in the bunker's kitchen after a hunt, talking and having a few beers together. He also enjoyed doing some other things after the beers with Dean, but that was neither here nor there.
"Laugh all you want now big guy, but don't come crying to me when you need my holy water gun" Ryan sneered grabbing his pistol and pointing it like James Bond down the lense of Dean's camera.
"So what do we do?" Jack questioned.
"Well I heard that feathers here was quite the spanner in the works during the whole 'let's throw an apocalypse' thing and of course everyone and their mother knows that Dean Winchester spent some time as a demon. Happens to the best of us pal, trust me" Beezelbub shot finger guns at the hunter and Dean looked as if he was going to hit the roof.
"I'm still not happy that Jack used my credit card without permission" Cass responded in annoyance, actively ignoring Dean's ongoing antics in favour of discussing more domestic and pressing matters than how adorable the hunter would have looked carrying a firearm around town in his new tote.
"In my defence I'm legally dead so how do you suppose I get a steady paycheque sweetheart?" Dean asked his partner for any bright ideas, to overcome that glaring obstacle to their plan to get him out into the workforce.
Since my last update we have been blessed by two new unsolved episodes and they were the shit what a time to be a ghouligan. Also roll on October tenth I miss team free will.
"What? Was I supposed to let that ghost blow my cover" Shane cried, getting frustrated.
"Finally! A case with alcohol on site. It took awhile but we got one!" Dean said as he and Cass slid out of the car.
As much as he had just teased him, Cass wouldn't enjoy if Dean had a day job as he'd be left in the bunker awaiting his return impatiently with only Sam's mini Ted talks about the difference between one variety of Kale and another and Jack's innocent questions such as "Cass why am I growing a beard under my arms?" He loved both his adoptive son and his longtime friend of course, but time spent with Dean truly made his days so much brighter. Besides it was quite difficult to try and make conversation about green vegetables and the concept of armpit hair for more than a few moments before going a little bit crazy.
"Yeah so does everything, doesn't make it continental does it?" The hunter huffed. "I'm digging this tote bag though. Perfect for my shotgun babe right?" Dean posed with the bag swung over his left shoulder, giving Cass his best blue steel all the while.
"Well yeah and a ghost and a vampire. Look It's complicated alright but I'm human now okay?" Dean assured him.
"No, your real eyes. Or do we have to call your friend down here?" The Angel threatened.
"Um Cass, Sam told me to check your bank account" Dean informed his partner cautiously.
"How about..." Shane looked at Ryan knowing there was no point in lying to him any longer. "Oh boy. Alright okay, Ryan you got me. I-I'm" He sighed "Ryan I'm a demon" He admitted to him.
"Holy shit" Ryan spluttered, backing up against a wall to steady himself.
Dean and Cass discover what exactly Shane Madej is...
"Dean 2, Castiel 2, Sam 2, Jack 2. Poor kid doesn't know too many people to name a pet after so I suggested he pick someone from the show, kids addicted to it" Sam told him.
Ryan swung his legs out over the side of the bed and strolled to the door. He hesitated to open it for a moment before he sighed and did so regardless of his instincts telling him not to follow through.
"Huh? Oh yeah I did" Shane lied.
Another case, another day of saving people hunting things, the family business.
"Woah dude take it easy" Shane raised his hands up, shielding his bloody face from Ryan's anger.
"Ryan. He be dead if I wasn't body guarding his scared ass" Shane stated proudly.
"Hey buddy you doing okay you look like you're going into labour over there" Dean said concerned with the angel's wellbeing.
"Number one gross and number two what happened to the Brent guy?" Dean wasn't sure he wanted to hear the answer but he had to ask regardless.
To Dean and Shanes delight, Ryan had in fact chosen to cover the brewery portion of the mansion next in their investigation.
Cas dug into his pocket and produced a black cassette tape which read "Deans top 13 Zepp Traxx". It was hard to tell if the choice to spell the word "tracks" with two x's was Deans subtle way of showing affection for the Angel or if they were cool edgy x's to reinforce how macho Dean thought he was.
"No, well not anymore at least. I'm human and Castiel's an angel" Dean explained.
"Yeah I think Henry would be rolling in his grave if he knew what we've done with the place already. Anyway, back to the case. Dean, I think I know who's been pulling all the crap on the show" Sam said.
‚ÄúWhen did you move back?‚Äù
Castiel gave Gabe a concerned look. ‚ÄúWhat are you so upset about? Weren‚Äôt you and Charlie the one‚Äôs pressing me to get a date in the first place?‚Äù
Dean and Castiel were slowly but surely returning to good terms. Charlie was ecstatic because it had been so long since she‚Äôd seen the sparkle in Castiel‚Äôs eyes. Gabe was more than displeased with the situation, but he wasn‚Äôt going to push Castiel to cut Dean out if he didn‚Äôt want to.
Eventually the lunch bell rang and they broke off to go to their classes. Castiel and Charlie both had English next, so they walked together. When they got to the classroom, they chose two seats close to the back. As people filed into the class, the boy with dirty blond hair and green eyes walked in. Charlie slapped Castiel on the arm.
Dean turned around and tried his best to focus on the lecture at hand, but by the time the bell rang and Castiel had burst out of the classroom, he was sure he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to focus on anything else today. He was thankful that they shared their next class together too, so he could try to keep a better eye on him. He didn‚Äôt like anything about what was going on.
‚ÄúNot so over him now, are you?‚Äù she teased.
Sam only stuck out his tongue in response.
Charlie was rapidly approaching the table. Dean pulled his hands away and scrambled back towards his lunch, face reddening from embarrassment.
His heart ached.
‚ÄúHey. You feeling better, man?‚Äù
He was glad that Dean had found a prom date that wasn‚Äôt batshit crazy, though. They‚Äôd seemed to be so engrossed in their conversation at lunch that they both had jumped when the bell rang. When Dean walked in, his face looked so blissful. He looked so at peace.
Jo giggled and shook her head. ‚ÄúYou danced to the stupid pop music I like with me, you let me pick the music in the car, you‚Äôve been such a gentleman these past few weeks‚Ä¶ I really couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better prom date, Dean.‚Äù
With that, Castiel closed his locker gently, and headed towards his class. It wasn‚Äôt until he made it there that he realized Dean didn‚Äôt have his number to text him in the first place. It was no matter. He was sure even if he did have it, he wouldn‚Äôt text him first. Didn‚Äôt seem to be his style. He sat down next to Charlie and tried to keep his mouth shut. He was worried if he opened it too much he would puke.
Charlie sat down with a thud into the seat across the table. She reached out and grabbed Castiel‚Äôs hands.
, but Castiel doesn‚Äôt swing that way. This whole
Dean tried so hard to be present, but the thoughts wouldn‚Äôt stop coming.
against his own. It was safe to say that Dean was even prettier than any girl Castiel had ever met.
His mother stood up and walked over to him, pulling him into a hug. He looked up at his father across the table, who gave him a soft smile. He immediately thought of Dean. He probably never knew what it felt like to have two parents who loved you and cared for you more than anything. He only knew the pain that his father had caused himself, his brother, and his mother. But Miss Mary had always been a tough lady, and he knew that she had plenty of love to give to Sam and Dean.
They spend the next few hours bouncing story synopses and sentence components back and forth. Eventually, Castiel‚Äôs mother knocked on the door, letting Dean know that his mom was fine with him having dinner with the Novaks that evening as long as he was home by 9.
about going anywhere with a girl?
‚ÄúShut it,‚Äù Hannah demanded, her arms on either side of Castiel‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve got the hots for Winchester, but you‚Äôre dating me now, got it? I don‚Äôt want to see you so much as look in his direction, or you‚Äôre going to regret it.‚Äù
Dean dug around in his bag for a scrap of paper and a pencil to scribble down his mother‚Äôs phone number, and Castiel took the opportunity to make his way upstairs. His parents would have no reason to hold Dean hostage if he wasn‚Äôt also present. At least, he hoped so.
Dean wasn‚Äôt sure about how to respond.
Prom night is here! Oh man I don't miss high school prom drama, I'll tell you that rn.
just got him a date with
‚Ä¶ he thought to himself. It was just like when he and Castiel were kids. Hanging out all day, playing video games
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Cas‚Ä¶ you deserve so much better than me.‚Äù
Thank you all so much. Being able to write things that are enjoyable for both myself and for others makes me so happy.
Hannah looked up at him with threatening eyes that only he could see.
he broke up with Jo, was he really a whole fucking idiot?
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me mom,‚Äù Castiel responded.
‚ÄúWhat are you going to do when you‚Äôre an adult and still don‚Äôt know how to clean dishes, Sammy?‚Äù Dean teased, leaning against the entryway.
As soon as he‚Äôd gotten home, he‚Äôd sat down and talked to his mom for a few minutes before heading up to bed. Sam was fast asleep in
Gabe rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt you ever heard of getting let out early?‚Äù he asked, clearly not as afraid of her as Dean was at this point.
He was only met with anger. Deep, deep anger.
‚ÄúDean, honey? Is that you?‚Äù his mother called, walking towards the door. Her eyes lit up when she saw the boy standing next to him.
Charlie beamed as she watched the two of them across the table. Dean averted his eyes, and Gabe looked like he was ready to kill her if she kept touching him. Castiel sucked in a deep breath and released it, trying to steady his heartbeat. ‚ÄúJesus, Hannah, you scared me.‚Äù
"Sam, I know trust me" His brother confirmed, not wanting to divulge that his source of information that the cameraman wasn't a demon was a fricking prince of hell.
"I'm not just a pretty face ya know" Dean winked to them. "Come on let's pick the towns people's brains so we can get home and fix our another apocalyptic mess we're stuck in" The hunter ushered for Castiel to follow them.
"Fairly simple job, you just have to go to where the bodies are and do a bit of torching" He whipped out his cell to find out where the Lemp's were buried.
"No rest for the Winchesters" Dean mumbled to himself as he clambered into the drivers seat of baby, but Cass heard him plain as day. How could he not with his impeccable angelic senses?
"What-no and I solely agreed to let you share my vessel to spare Sam. I certainly didn't consent to you wreaking havoc in my personal affairs Lucifer and it's none of your business frankly" Castiel sneered at the Devil.
"Hear what" Dean asked him.
"Okay I'm trying to keep this shit show together okay? Spirts, are you there? My names Ryan and that's my pal Shane can you say our names back for us" Ryan said.
"Hey Cass, you kinda sounded like Ryan when he does his little narrator voice for the show" Shane chuckled.
"Ah, well now it is" Castiel said.
"Yeah but she ain't my type no offence. Number one older than the planet and also she's my husbands aunt it's not a turn on at all!" Dean assured them, gesturing to Cass at the word 'husband'.
Cass balled his hands into fists at his sides.
"Dean be careful" Castiel grabbed the hunters arm and gazed at him worriedly.
"Is he okay?" Genuine concern painted the demons face.
Just then the doors slammed open all of a sudden. "HOLLIDAY" a stocky man bellows, four more men waking behind him saunter into Shorty's. "I gotta bone to pick with you Doc" the leader of the group of intruders calls out towards the barman.
The boys finally have their brewskies and a long kept secret is revealed that could end the future of the ghoul boy's friendship.
"What you didn't think I knew who you two were! You're guys are practically famous, are you doing autographs by the way? That would go for big bucks on eBay" Shane told them excitedly.
Shane strode over to him "I said if your Mom never died, you would have never met Castiel. No Azzael means no hunter winchesters, which means no need for you to have got rescued from hell by your seraph in shining armour now would it" Shane concluded.
"What are you doing" Cass said groggily, hazing in and out of consciousness whist trapped in his own mind.
"What about him?" Dean replied defensively, ready to argue with the smarmy demon if he insulted his partner in any way.
Dean chuckled at Castiel's remark about him becoming a male escort, but choose to instead steer the conservative elsewhere before it went down any R rated avenues.
Fuck he thought that could have been it what else do these stupid humans do then? "Dean what is wrong, what did I forget?" Lucifer asked the hunter as they began to wonder could he nominate himself for an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Castiel, which was still fooling his human pet so successfully.
"He means woke guys" Dean explained.
Shane clapped his hands together grabbing the groups attention.
"Sorry isn't gonna cut it Sunshine. I sat in the restaurant for an hour and the guy at the bar thought I got stood up and gave me a free beer. Well I guess I did  actually get stood up. Getting stood up is bad enough but at that restaurant, we waited weeks for the reservation and now I can't ever go back there man I'm humiliated" Dean huffed, clearly very upset with the Angel.
"Those fucking cheap skates. Wait the FBI wanted to speak with him? Dude's harmless." Shane said to Ryan.
"Alright this is Castiel, he's an angel" Dean informed the curious Doc.
"You're such a jerk, I was getting real communication from spirts but your skeptical ass can't handle being wrong can you?" Ryan looked done.
"Look I know you think I'm just like the other demons but I despite that I actually have a conscious unfortunately, so yeah I emphasise with your messed up life" Shane admitted to them.
"Dean you know this man?" Cass asked the hunter, completely ignoring What Doc was telling the pair about how he's still alive.
Dean wanted to smack the demon in the face and wipe that smirk off his face but he was too damn tired to start a fight.
"Hey kid you seem happy" Dean declared glad to see Jack so joyful. He hadn't seen the boy so smiley in a long time.
The demon stared at the floor. "No" He swallowed.
Neither hunter nor angel aware of what was waiting for them when they finally reached their destination of St. Louis. If they only knew, they would have turned the car right back around as fast as they could.
"Right and rolling. We're now in the Elsa Lemp suite which is supposedly the most haunted of the bedrooms in the house. It was originally used as servants quarters, so maybe we might get to communicate with Elsa or the Lemp's staff" Ryan began.
"What can I say? I grew attracted to the little guy so I kept tabs on him. He started working for Buzzfeed so I said what the hay, we could be colleagues. Pulls some strings got a job there in the same department as Ryan. Then he started his unsolved show with Brent and I knew I had to hop on that gig! I mean a show about providing the existence of the Supernatural with one of the hosts themselves being a supernatural being? The irony of me saying I'm a skeptic too! It's just a huge joke" Shane chuckled to himself.
"Please can we check out the brewery, I really need a drink" Shane sighed.
"Get in the damn car already, don't make me ask twice!" Dean pinched the top of his nose, annoyed with their shenanigans already. Since when were demons such motorheads anyway he wondered silently.
"How do you know that for sure though?" Sam queryied.
Dean sighed "Cass show him" Castiel nodded and unfurled his impressive dark wings to convince the ghost hunter.
Castiel and Dean finally make it to the Lemp mansion where they meet with the ghoul boys, Ryan and Shane...
"You're one to talk, cradle snatching victim" The demon coughed back at Dean.
"Then why are you here? Who are you guys?" Ryan squinted towards Cass and Dean.
"The more the merrier right big guy?" Ryan said gladly to his co-host, as he had two boogaras on his side.
The Angel and the Hunter were confused as to who this watcher was. It couldn't be that bad if they had never heard of them right?
"So he's like Han Solo but soup?" The Winchester concluded.
Sam rolled his eyes at Dean, thinking "Great why am I always left to baby sit" when in all honesty he was glad he'll have some time to rest up.
Dean shot him his "you sure look" then to be nodded at by Cass to confirm his statement. Having an angel on your team really has its perks at times, he thought to himself as he wrapped the hand not holding the glass of whiskey around his firearm within his jacket. "Show time" He whispered to Cass, taking his glass of whiskey with him in his attempt to defuse the situation.
It had only been a few days since Castiel had said the big 'yes' to Lucifer to make the devil spare the Winchesters but for the seraph it had felt more like decades. This stupid selfless sacrifice was tried and true Winchester brand of stupid behaviour and it really signalled that the Angel was truly part of the family now.
"I thought there was only boogaras and shaniacs" Dean was getting more and more confused by the ins and outs of the whole unsolved universe.
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya" Shane continued laughing away to himself.
"Jack many of these paranormal shows are based on fabrications to get their ratings up, I don't think this is a case" Castiel tried to explain to his son.
"Sure thing, be right back" He shot a finger gun towards to the other host and sauntered off back up the stairs.
Dean and Cass exchanged a confused glance with each other.
"Dean get the holy water" Cass instructed his partner.
"Dean you let him drive the impala and drink beer, but you're suddenly concerned about the shows he watches" Sam called his brother out on his bullshit.
"They do come from a continent I suppose" Castiel disputed in a monotone manner.
"New contacts?" The demon tried again.
"So they were good demons?" Ryan was feeling lost trying to grasp all this.
"Well your wrong. I'll admit it I'm still freaked out, but you're still the same idiot who I drag to these shoots" Ryan admitted.
Castiel's eyes began to glow bright blue and he unfurled his ebony wings as a warning.
"Generally yes. It's supposed to be a paranormal hotspot, those aren't the most welcoming of locations" Cass remarked, as they walked in step with each other up to the mansions entrance.
"Wait he's actually still alive?" The demon sounded honestly surprised.
"So what now you're Lord of the windows movie maker?" Dean chuckled at his own joke like the dork he was.
"Now wait a minute. I wouldn't be spending my honey moon in a lame Victorian B&B with a demon and a youtuber. We're on a case okay!" Dean made the situation clear to them.
"Yeah so were we, look at us now" Dean gave Cass a little pat on the ass and winked at him.
"It's just a phrase... never mind. I'm going to go turn in too, I'm pooped. If you need me I'll be in my room" He headed up the staircase towards the Elsa Lemp suite, hoping he wouldn't be needed. He was still trying to decide how he felt about his friend not being who he thought they were this whole time. On the one hand he had been provided with definitive proof of the existence of the supernatural, something all people in his line of work would quite literally kill for but it didn't feel like he had imagined it would. It felt sour and sad. His pal wasn't a sardonic skeptic, he was a fucking demon, one of the things that go bump in the night that should scare the pants off of people like Ryan yet he was still the same guy he goofed around with and made a stupid hotdog themed space opera and occasionally looked like Shaggy from Scooby Doo. How can both of those realities exist simultaneously? His head was practically spinning.
"Shane" Ryan looked at the ground "You're not being fair man. I need time to process all this alright. I can't do this right now and I know we usually bunk together during investigations but I'm not sleeping in the same room as you tonight, I'm sorry I just can't knowing what I know now" Ryan couldn't look them in the eyes from embarrassment, so his gaze instead fixed upon their shoes.
Jack turned the laptop around to show Sam, Dean and Castiel his discovery.
"There's something very powerful in this area, but I'm not sure what it is" Cass said as he looked out the window of the impala, like a big sign would appear out of nowhere saying "danger this way".
Dean opened his mouth the speak but was interpreted by Shane replying for him.
"Where's the other one?" Cass motioned to Ryan suddenly.
"That's the spirt kid!" Dean patted Jack on the back and smiled down at him.
"No that's fine. It doesn't matter as long as this scary fucking place is the same right" Ryan shifted around, he was visibly uncomfortable to be in the mansion.
"Chuck?" The demon was visibly confused.
"He didn't mean it like that Jack, of course you're helpful. Look me and Dean will meet these Ryan and Shane people and tell them how to avoid being gruesomely killed and then come home right away isn't that right Dean?" Castiel shot Dean the "just agree with me" look.
They sussed the place out before entering through a side door with a key they had aquired from the owner of the building, Matt at the burger joint. Sam had got in touch with him back at the bunker. He had made up a fake story and then wired them a handsome sum of money to for use of the location for their own made up paranormal investigation show.
Dean stared at him for a moment.
"It's a bedroom dude, how is that eerie?" Shane shot back at him in a mocking tone.
"Buzzfeed unsolved: supernatural?" Sam read the title of the series allowed.
"What's so funny about that?" Dean asked hurt.
"Don't make me say it again dummy" Ryan rolled his eyes.
Dean breathed heavily "Phew that was a close one. Those demons sure we're funny when they called you Doc cause you look just like Doc Holliday with that moustache" Dean chuckled softly.
The name of the bar
"Okay sure the whole knowing the truth thing is tough. I can empathise, but nothing has really changed between us man, I'm still your pal" Shane tried his best to smile "You're my friend" They chocked out.
"Jokes on you I don't actually need to sleep. Now I don't need to keep up my Oscar award winning sleep performances every time we stay over one of these joints" Shane smiled, clearly pleased with himself and his convincing acting chops.
"No need for the apology, some people still aren't awake" Castiel stated blankly.
"Unless the kid was like I don't know, the antichrist? Then a haunted house would be the perfect place to raise a boy like that hypothetically" Shane suggested, winking at Dean and Cass.
Trevor kept learning more facts about Cas‚Äô friend over the months, only semi-against his will. He lived twenty miles from here. He liked driving. He liked movies. He thought Sprite was garbage - Trevor pushed back on that, and made Cas get a large Sprite and drink it all and by the end Cas had to admit that his friend was wrong on that one. Major victory. As far as Trevor could tell, this guy thought his friend was right about everything.
"Yes. How did you know?"
It was, and Trevor wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Dean‚Äôs attitude. So he apologized insincerely and suggested Cas get the nuggets meal - Cas liked those, liked the variety of dipping sauces. They‚Äôd talked about it for like three consecutive visits. A safe bet. ‚ÄúIs that all for here or to go?‚Äù Trevor asked once that was rung in.
But that idea seemed to be a surprise to Cas. He held his bag and stood there. ‚ÄúHumanity never ceases to confound me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes. He prefers Burger King, although I‚Äôve tried to tell him it is largely the same physical material. So I come here.‚Äù
‚ÄúLike you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
And then Cas stopped coming at all. New regulars became a thing, like the guy who pulled obvious garbage out of the trash cans and tried to get refunds, or the woman who was four feet tall and got four large black coffees, or that rando on drive through who always got eight small free waters and backed up the whole fucking line.
Cas wasn‚Äôt back for three weeks. Until he saw him again, Trevor worried he‚Äôd gone too far. Well, worry wasn‚Äôt the right word. It was work. If he quit, he‚Äôd never think about this place ever again, Cas included. But his closing shifts were a little more boring without the weird dude in the trenchcoat. He was glad to see him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it gonna be tonight?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúI did not. It‚Äôs not that bad if you wait for fresh fries. You‚Äôve gotta try it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI highly doubt it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt seem to know what to do with that information.
‚ÄúDo you want to wait?‚Äù Trevor prompted.
‚ÄúI will.‚Äù Cas nodded decisively, and then looked at the clock again. Trevor followed his eyes. It was ten exactly. ‚ÄúThank you for listening,‚Äù Cas said, and left.
‚ÄúSays the guy with that order.‚Äù Trevor gestured at the bag.
‚ÄúYou said it three times.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo idea.‚Äù
‚ÄúI would like a Big Mac with extra mac sauce but with spicy crispy chicken instead of beef, please.‚Äù
Cas came back once or twice. He didn‚Äôt mention his friend Dean. Trevor didn‚Äôt ask. It wasn‚Äôt totally his business. Plus, it wasn‚Äôt like he knew them that well. If Cas thought his friend wouldn‚Äôt talk to him, he was probably right about that. It was his possibly clandestine life.
‚ÄúThink you already did, pal.‚Äù Dean cleared his throat. ‚ÄúJust wanted to say thanks.‚Äù
‚ÄúWeird,‚Äù Cheyenne said definitively, and picked up the quarter pounder as he slid it down to the end.
‚ÄúThe hell you don‚Äôt. Cas was coming here for what, a year? Talking your ear off on the clock.‚Äù
‚ÄúNope. Thanks.‚Äù
Trevor also thought about suggesting Cas talk to another friend for these kinds of things, and not random people making minimum wage. But he didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and he definitely liked the fifteen minutes guaranteed of doing no work while he Served His Customer by listening and half-heartedly restocking cups and bags and whatever so he never brought it up.
‚ÄúSome weirdo just tried to give me sixty bucks.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you close in four minutes?‚Äù
Then the whole evening grill shift quit to go work at the pita place around the corner, so Trevor got put on table and didn‚Äôt take counter for a while. But he saw the guy anyways sometimes, over the shoulder of someone bagging up food. Seemed like trenchcoat was working through the menu one item at a time. Always late at night, always just one thing. Always extra sauce or dressing. The exact kind of weird that was easy to remember.
‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt take my word for it. I‚Äôm just saying.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be after you tell him what you decided to order today,‚Äù Trevor said, instead of something nice. It just slipped out, he didn‚Äôt mean it. Before he handed Cas the bag, he said the nice thing. ‚ÄúCongrats.‚Äù
Weird name. Seemed fitting. Trevor popped an apple pie into the smallest bag, and handed it over. ‚ÄúNinety-nine cents.‚Äù
Extra mayo would probably not make Trevor like a McChicken more, but he just nodded, rang it in. This time the guy paid with a five. As Trevor made the change, the guy spoke again. "I'm in love with him, of course."
While Cas was pulling out his wallet, he spoke again. ‚ÄúMy friend loves apple pie. Well, all kinds of pie.‚Äù
While he did, Cas spoke again. ‚ÄúI think fate is conspiring against me again. The odds of him wanting to come here specifically were astronomically low.‚Äù
Cas had completely frozen in place. Kind of a dick move to freak him out, Trevor regretted that. But he didn‚Äôt regret it for a second when he saw how this Dean guy reacted. He glared at Trevor, snatched their cups from the counter and semi-shoved Cas away towards the drinks. They had a conversation in low voices over there, and Trevor was extremely busy making the milkshake and putting down new fries so he didn‚Äôt hear any of it. Didn‚Äôt even want to.
Cas didn‚Äôt say anything. He paid, and he waited, and when Trevor handed over his bag, he said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just like that a lot.‚Äù
Trevor glanced at the clock. ‚ÄúYeah. But if you want it, you could wait outside. We‚Äôd bring it out.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood point.‚Äù Trevor didn‚Äôt want to talk about the wedding any more.
It was late, skeleton crew on a dead Thursday night. Everybody was breaking down their stations early, trying to get out of here fast. Trevor had just made a trip back to the sink with empty trays when he spotted him at the counter again. Trenchcoat guy, waiting patiently. He raised his hand again, gave the same awkward wave, and then Trevor couldn‚Äôt
‚ÄúUm.‚Äù Cas hadn‚Äôt been paralyzed by the menu for months, but today was like the first couple times he came in here. He stared at it. ‚ÄúWhat do people normally get?‚Äù he asked Trevor. The question had layers, for sure.
Cas was back a few days later. ‚ÄúSo my friend Dean,‚Äù he said, while Trevor tried to ring in the latest cursed combination. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre aware of my feelings for him, obviously.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Cas said, and then squinted at nothing. ‚ÄúI think you should get a raise.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell. Now he is too.‚Äù
‚ÄúI want to try totally fresh food,‚Äù Cas said. He looked like a dad, but he sounded like a kid. A large toddler in a suit. With a beard.
Dean‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he immediately exclaimed, hardly able to convince himself that he was telling the truth. He knew Jo saw right through him based on the look she was giving him.
It had only been two weeks since they‚Äôd officially come out saying they were a couple, and Hannah had already sucked the life out of him.
, but nothing came to him. He didn‚Äôt know what to say.
Castiel didn‚Äôt realize he was holding his breath until he let it out in a deep sigh. The conversation wasn‚Äôt moving on its own. Why did he want to keep it going so bad?
As if through prayer, the conversation changed with the music. Jo tugged on Dean‚Äôs sleeve excitedly, and Dean was met with her beaming smile. It was hard to not feel relaxed in her presence. ‚ÄúOh, Dean, I love this song! Can we go dance! Please?‚Äù
Charlie is the ultimate wing-woman
‚ÄúNot goodbye, Cas. Just... see you later.‚Äù
She shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you or anything. I don‚Äôt think I ever could. But‚Ä¶ this sucks, Dean.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh my god, Dean Winchester just
Without warning, Gabriel stood up and walked over to where Castiel sat. He leaned down and pulled him into one of the tightest hugs they‚Äôd ever shared. Unsure of what else to do, Castiel simply hugged onto one of Gabriel‚Äôs arms.
Castiel felt his face burst into a fierce blush. ‚ÄúTh-thanks. I‚Äôm flattered.‚Äù
Castiel couldn‚Äôt help his snort of laughter. He hadn‚Äôt realized how much he‚Äôd missed his friends. He couldn‚Äôt believe how distant he‚Äôd been forced to be from all of them, especially Dean. He‚Äôd seen them every day, but now it felt like it was the first time he‚Äôd seen them in months.
Time moved in slow motion. Dean wrapped his other hand around Jo‚Äôs waist before pulling her into a kiss. It was soft, chaste, but still brilliant and breath-taking. They broke away after only a moment, heat flushed in both of their cheeks. Hand in hand, the two of them made their way back to Dean‚Äôs car, and Dean drove Jo home.
Dean shook his head with disbelief, but he laughed too. ‚ÄúWell, I suppose I could use some studying. But I‚Äôll have to go back to my place to grab some stuff first.‚Äù
The first thing Castiel did was call Dean‚Äôs cell phone. It went to voicemail. Castiel opened his mouth to leave a message, but one of Castiel‚Äôs friends ripped the phone from his hands. Castiel sobbed as the end button was pressed. His friends pulled him into their arms and told him that everything was going to be okay.
Castiel shook his head. ‚ÄúI know, but‚Ä¶ all those years, I was so depressed. I had friends and my family. I shouldn‚Äôt have been so‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶‚Äù
The dinner portion of the date went well. They laughed and talked like they always had before. But Dean had this unsettling weight in the pit of his stomach, threatening to overcome him.
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you happy with me, Cassie? Tell them that it isn‚Äôt true, that they made that up!‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ are you sure they wouldn‚Äôt hate me?‚Äù
‚ÄúJust know, Winchester. If you do
That did nothing to ease the worry across Castiel‚Äôs face, but he didn‚Äôt push it further. ‚ÄúDo what makes you comfortable, dude. But just so you know‚Ä¶ you can tell me anything, Dean. I‚Äôll never think ill of you.‚Äù
Hannah flashed the rest of his table a bright smile before practically dragging Castiel away from them. Dean‚Äôs eyes followed the two of them walked across the cafeteria, his face twisted with concern. Castiel turned around and shot his friends one last look before he disappeared into the hallway outside with Hannah.
Dean scrambled off of him and moved to sit in the other corner of the bed, coughing out a quick apology. Castiel slowly pushed himself up into a sitting position. ‚ÄúNo worries,‚Äù Castiel said dumbly, before the room fell into a semi-awkward silence. Castiel‚Äôs eyes were focused on the computer next to him, tilted haphazardly near the edge of the bed. Dean‚Äôs face was still flushed, as he watched Castiel across the bed from him.
‚ÄúJo, I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù
Dean blushed. ‚ÄúYeah. She‚Äôs really cool. I‚Äôm glad Charlie forced me to talk to her that first time.‚Äù
Without thinking, Dean‚Äôs hands fell to Castiel‚Äôs, lightly grabbing them. Dean watched as Castiel‚Äôs face lit up with a blush, but he made no motion to move away. He looked up, eyes curious. Dean simply smiled back at him. That‚Äôs it, just a smile. But Castiel felt his breath hitch and his heart stop.
‚ÄúMan, do I have to do
‚ÄúNah, I don‚Äôt mind walking. I‚Äôll see you at school tomorrow, Cassie.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, mom.‚Äù
Charlie decided to drop it and they sat quietly throughout the rest of the class.
Castiel absolutely rejoiced in being surrounded by all of his favorite people in the world. It made the fact that starting tomorrow he wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to Dean‚Äôs house anymore only‚Ä¶ slightly less painful. But eventually, the time came, and the Winchesters had to get ready to go. Castiel had begged and begged both Dean‚Äôs parents and his own to let Dean spend the night one more time, but the Winchesters had to leave very early in the morning. Dean turned to Castiel and gave him a sad look.
Dean gets up in his feelingsTM and Castiel is probably not totally straight.
Around 4 in the afternoon, Castiel was the first one to give up studying, dumping his notebooks to the floor as he collapsed onto his pillows. He let out an annoyed sigh, throwing an arm over his eyes. Dean tried to ignore the small sliver of skin that was peeking out from underneath Castiel‚Äôs shirt, burning his gaze into the passage he‚Äôd been re-reading.
Dean shrugged. ‚ÄúYou deserve it, you know? You‚Äôre so awesome and I‚Äôve gotta repay you somehow.‚Äù
Castiel threw his hands in front of him, waving them around frantically. ‚ÄúNo, no, it was all me. My bad.‚Äù
Finally Castiel let out a small giggle. Dean laughed with him. They sat for a few more minutes, until they heard Dean‚Äôs mother calling his name.
straight
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go into the second grade without you, Dean. If I get bullied, you won‚Äôt be there to protect me anymore...‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúThere is something‚Ä¶ something that I‚Äôve been meaning to tell you for a long time. Like, a
But the end of the day rolled around, and Dean approached him again.
‚ÄúCome on Dean,‚Äù Castiel groaned. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been studying for
I was honestly relieved to see this is only... two months since my last update.
Dean took a shaky breath and let his head fall back against the wall, the phone resting in his hand. Silence. Silent tears fell down his face, staining his cheeks. ‚ÄúYou really do deserve better than me, Jo. I‚Äôm really sorry about tonight. I wanted you to have a good time, and I ruined it by trying to jump into the middle of something I know I shouldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ Will you let me make it up to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúJo, please! Please stop. Please, let me at least drive you home? Then I promise you‚Äôll never have to look at me again.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúSure thing, handsome,‚Äù Trevor said, which was the stupidest thing he‚Äôd done in a while. If Katherine overheard it from the window she‚Äôd never let him live it down.
"Yes. It's unfortunate."
Trevor shrugged. "You're the extra sauce guy."
‚ÄúThen come sometime when you can wait, and they‚Äôll make it for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait, do you want something else? Big Mac? Or like, we‚Äôve got a few apple pies, cookies-‚Äú Trevor wasn‚Äôt sure why he was listing these things. The guy just seemed sad. And not the annoying customer kind of sad either. Also, Trevor really didn‚Äôt want to finish breaking down table.
‚ÄúMy name is Cas.‚Äù
Trevor did think about it, off and on. He‚Äôd have to be pretty in love with somebody to eat shitty fast food for them when they weren‚Äôt even around. Tragic.
‚ÄúYou know him?‚Äù Cheyenne asked, when the guy was half out the door and definitely not out of earshot.
Trevor looked up. ‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúHonestly, dude, I don‚Äôt give a shit. Burger King is really better,‚Äù Trevor said, and Dean actually laughed. Cheyenne slid a milkshake across the table towards the window. ‚ÄúThis yours?‚Äù Trevor asked Dean, and Dean nodded. ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù
And suddenly, Dean was fighting of a kind of smile. ‚ÄúIs this the part where I‚Äôm supposed to say I‚Äôm coming around on McDonald‚Äôs?‚Äù he asked gruffly.
‚ÄúA deluxe crispy chicken sandwich, please.‚Äù
When he could keep a straight face, Trevor turned back around. Cas was standing in front of the register, silent panic on his face. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said, his tone even more stiff and formal than usual. ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù
‚ÄúFor here,‚Äù Dean said. He paid with a card that said Kilgore Vonnegut. Trevor wasn‚Äôt making enough to ask any questions, but again, more evidence for the hitman theory. That was looking pretty robust.
‚ÄúExtra mayo?‚Äù
‚ÄúI wish. Heather would flip if she checked the tapes and saw that. And I‚Äôm not about to get fired with three weeks until my wedding.‚Äù
‚ÄúI never said that.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a piece of work, y‚Äôknow that?‚Äù Dean said, a whole annoyed thing getting ready to go.
The guy was smiling for once. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I get extra sauce?‚Äù Cas said suddenly.
"Ah," the guy said. "Yes. I'm not accustomed to fast food. But my friend likes it. So I'm making an effort."
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù the friend said, frowning. He wasn‚Äôt a big guy but he was tall, and he looked like he did probably something along the lines construction for a living. Totally a mafia thing, Trevor was sure.
Hold on, Trevor said to himself, suddenly and unfortunately invested. Had Cas been trying all of this shit and not mentioning it to anybody? It had been a year, almost. Cas had gotten three quarters of the menu and was starting to freestyle. All his inventions were cursed. Extremely strange of him to be keeping that secret.
Trevor nodded. ‚ÄúBurger King is better.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Trevor frowned, but she just shrugged and went for the ice cream machine. So he went over and opened the window and found that Dean guy, in a spotless classic car. ‚ÄúCan I help you with something?‚Äù
This friend was extremely good at his job, whatever it was - fellow assassin, Trevor presumed - and he was devastatingly handsome, and then sometimes Cas would say truly odd shit. Like he‚Äôd say that the guy changed the trajectory of humanity, and Trevor would be like, okay sure he did. And in his head he‚Äôd tell Cas to calm down, maybe play it a little cooler, because saying stuff like that was the number one way for the guy to find out. And that was definitely something Cas still did not want. Cas mentioned that just as often as he talked about how much he loved this dude.
Cas kept coming back. Always in that long tan coat, sometimes spotted with stuff that was probably blood. Trevor had assumed he was just some accountant. Now he was thinking accountant was just a cover for hitman. Wasn‚Äôt there a whole mafia thing around here a couple years ago? That would track. But Cas didn‚Äôt act like a hitman. He was a nice weird dude. Quiet, never a pain in the ass when they were busy. Just incapable of shutting up about his friend. That put him near the top of the list, as far as their regulars went, so Trevor listened.
‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt know. He was putting money in the little box thing and asked how we split tips and I said that wasn‚Äôt tips, it was for charity or whatever, and he was like well how do I tip you and I was like that isn‚Äôt really a thing here. So he tried to just give me money.‚Äù
Trevor rang all that in methodically, definitely not noticing anything about this guy that Cas brought with him. Like, it was definitely the friend, right? That was why Cas looked like he wanted to melt into the floor. He got two apple pies, and Cas had said he loved pie. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Trevor said, and looked at Cas. ‚ÄúAnything for you?‚Äù
Cas looked down, like he‚Äôd forgotten. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYes. Well.‚Äù He looked a little pitiful, even for a dad-accountant-hitman.
‚ÄúI know it is, because some random guy in a moisture-wicking polo shirt calling you handsome made him jealous.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he want?‚Äù Cheyenne asked as they switched back.
‚ÄúIt was a joke, Dean,‚Äù Cas said, with a hand on Dean‚Äôs arm.
When Trevor got pulled into the back office the next day, Ricky told him he‚Äôd be getting fifteen bucks an hour. Ricky didn‚Äôt know why, just that the order came from higher up and was not optional. Which, that was obviously amazing. But what was even more amazing was confirmation that Trevor had totally been right. Mafia thing for sure.
Cheyenne was on counter, for once. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, leaning over the pile of McMuffins for drive through. ‚ÄúTrev.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Trevor said, but he was sort of smiling as he closed the window. All this for some dude in a trenchcoat who was probably a dad and also an assassin for the mafia. Or an alien. Trevor didn‚Äôt totally understand the appeal, but whatever. Good for them.
‚ÄúWell, then he‚Äôs jealous a lot.‚Äù Obviously.
It was five minutes before the dining room closed. They were dead. Marissa was supposed to be on counter but she was in the back smoking, and the guy came in again. So Trevor squeezed out from the grill area and peeled his gloves off to take the order.
It was a Monday night and Cas walked in. He stopped in the doorway and made immediate, intense eye contact with Trevor. Strange. And then he turned back and spoke to someone coming through the doors behind him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an alternative,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLike Wendy‚Äôs.‚Äù
Eventually her mind was allowed to clear when they entered the lunch room. They scattered their separate ways to get their food before meeting at their table. Castiel approached the table with a very apprehensive Dean behind him.
I couldn‚Äôt use glitches to my advantage!‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs thumb hovered over the send button. He had gotten Castiel‚Äôs number a few days ago. He still had yet to send him anything. He was absolutely terrified. Castiel had given him nothing but the cold shoulder since they‚Äôd talked again that first time. And, he was totally right to do so. Dean blamed nobody but himself for the way things were between them now.
He turned and looked at Jo, who was eyeing him with concern again. She sat up on the picnic table they‚Äôd laid on, looking down at him.
Thank you so much for reading always!
As nervous as Dean was to be eating dinner with Castiel‚Äôs parents, it actually went very well. Apparently Castiel‚Äôs mother had done a
‚ÄúHello, boys!‚Äù said that chipper voice that was going to haunt Dean‚Äôs nightmares for the next 5 years. At least.
‚ÄúPlease, Dean. If there‚Äôs something wrong, please tell me. I want to be able to help you.‚Äù
He figured it would be a few minutes before she texted back since his reply was so late, so he turned his attention to his math homework. He made it through four problems before his phone buzzed next to him.
Dean was pulled out of his thoughts by his mom, who was looking at him with concern. ‚ÄúHoney, is everything alright? You look so sad.‚Äù
Dean opened his mouth to reply, but Castiel shoved past him and made a beeline for the parking lot. Gabe was waiting by his car. When he saw Castiel, his face immediately filled with concern.
Dean‚Äôs vision went red with rage, and at the same time he felt his heart cracking all over again and the old scars ripping open. He wanted nothing more than to wipe that disgusting, vile smirk off of that girl‚Äôs face. But a soft hand landed on his shoulder. He turned to see Gabe next to him, softly shaking his head.
Dean rolled his eyes as Castiel chuckled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd have every right to if they did.‚Äù
Castiel was surprised at the question. ‚ÄúDean? I haven‚Äôt seen him in ages, I have no idea what he looks like now.‚Äù Castiel gave her a strange look. ‚ÄúWhy are you asking?‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs heart thumped. He‚Äôd never seen the words out in the open like that before.
,‚Äù Charlie said matter-of-factly, punctuating her point with a slap to the table top.
Jo snickered. ‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôm letting an old geezer take me to the dance? You‚Äôll be ready to leave before we even get there!‚Äù
‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I wanted to protect him. For once. Instead of being the piece of shit friend I am. But instead, he‚Äôs hurting worse than ever, and I ruined your night.‚Äù
‚ÄúGo have fun. Be safe. Have my girl home by midnight, Deannie.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, come on!‚Äù Charlie cried, shooting him a wounded look. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a white girl, I can‚Äôt help it that I dance like this!‚Äù
Dean laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a work in progress. I used to be a real piece of shit.‚Äù
Dean sighed. ‚ÄúDamn, if he won‚Äôt tell Gabe about it, he‚Äôs not gonna tell anyone‚Ä¶‚Äù
The buzz of excitement in the halls was tangible as the formal was rapidly approaching. Hannah and other members of student council were constantly tabling in the hallways, selling tickets to the event and encouraging students to cast their votes for the dance royalty. She often had Castiel by her side, almost like she was keeping a leash on him.
Dean hesitated. ‚ÄúDo they even know I‚Äôm back?‚Äù
‚ÄúAll I know is that I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs a nightmare. But nobody‚Äôs ever seen her physically hurt a fly, and she smiles like the sun is shining out of her ass, so of course nobody believes a word that any of her exes say.‚Äù
Castiel hugged back, and he couldn‚Äôt help his smile. ‚ÄúShut up. I think its your fault, all your gay rubbed off on me.‚Äù
He squeezes Jo‚Äôs hand in his ever so slightly, trying to pull himself back into the moment.
He felt like he was suffocating... like he was about to puke up the little bit of lunch he‚Äôd just eaten before she came and dragged him away. He needed to get out‚Ä¶ but out of what? The stall? The school? The relationship? Which relationship even‚Ä¶the one with Hannah or the one with Dean? His body shook with sobs and he just wrapped his arms around himself and let himself cry for the next five minutes.
Gabe laughed. ‚ÄúCoral. I‚Äôm feeling
please forgive me for what I've done,,,,,,
maybe being jealous about him being with someone else. The thought of Castiel maybe disliking the idea of Dean going on a date with someone that wasn‚Äôt him. The thought of Castiel maybe wanting something more than friendship with his childhood best friend.
‚ÄúStill couldn‚Äôt
Dean froze up. ‚ÄúY-yeah, haha.‚Äù If Jo had noticed his sudden bought of nerves, she made no indication of it, because she didn‚Äôt press him on it any further.
The girl he‚Äôd had a crush on since elementary school turned out to be an absolute nightmare just like you said she would, and I have no idea how to get myself out of this situation?
Sam rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt
‚ÄúHey, Cas, what did Dean look like?‚Äù
Charlie smirked. ‚Äú
His next class was pre-calculus, so he was technically a few years ahead of his peers. And sure enough, Winchester was apparently smart too. So, he was the
Dean shot her a stupid grin. ‚ÄúI never pictured you being the classically trained type of musician. That‚Äôs super cute.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo questions, get in the car,‚Äù he pleaded. He threw his bag into the back before throwing himself into the driver‚Äôs seat. He slammed his door closed and locked it. He took a deep breath and let his head fall back against the head rest. Gabe was quiet for a few minutes, but he eventually broke the silence.
around here?‚Äù she asked before standing up. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go around the table and introduce everyone. I‚Äôll start. My name‚Äôs Charlie, I‚Äôm gay as hell, and I use vine references in my every day speech.‚Äù
Dean shook his head and tried to clear the thoughts, but he couldn‚Äôt fight off the sinking feeling in his gut. Hannah was the class vice president. She wouldn‚Äôt do anything that stupid. Her reputation would be destroyed in an instant if people knew that she abused her significant other.
Gabe laughed. ‚ÄúWell then, I can at least get my parents to make a new ‚Äòno Winchesters allowed‚Äô rule for the bakery.‚Äù
Castiel couldn‚Äôt help but smile.
‚ÄúDean? Are you okay?‚Äù Jo asked again, reaching out to grab one of Dean‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been really distant tonight. Do we need to reschedule again?‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs typing‚Ä¶
‚ÄúDinner is soon! Mom said get ready!‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs gaze hardened. He wasn‚Äôt going to let her take him down with her words again. That‚Äôs all they were‚Ä¶ just words. She couldn‚Äôt do anything to him now. Not that everyone knew what a monster she truly was. He knows he and Jo weren‚Äôt the only ones who saw that. ‚ÄúSo is that how you justify all this?‚Äù he asked, gesturing towards a still shaken Castiel with a reddening cheek. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not as horrible as me? You don‚Äôt think someone like Castiel Novak is worth of the utmost love and affection?‚Äù
And, I am GOING to finish this fic if it kills me. No matter how long it takes, it is going to be done. I'm so sorry to those of you who have been waiting for so long. And such a huge thank you to people who are still here even though I've been MIA for literal years. Please be patient with me, but I am going to try to keep regular updates from now on. Feel free to follow me on twitter @tardis_noise because I do post there a lot about happenings, if you're interested.
But, life. Was fucking. Cruel.
Dean gave Jo a sheepish grin. ‚ÄúWell, if nothing else, you deserve to be treated like a princess tonight.‚Äù
away from my boyfriend.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, come on, Cas! You have to go. And Gabe and I already going as each other‚Äôs not-dates, so you have to at least
Dean stuttered. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ uh, well, I told my mom I‚Äôd be home for dinner‚Ä¶‚Äù
Dean didn‚Äôt have time to flinch at that because in a moment Charlie had him pinned against the locker. ‚ÄúSo God help you if you fuck this up a second time, Winchester.‚Äù
Dean scoffed. ‚ÄúUh, it‚Äôs a game, in video format. Therefore, it is a
Castiel continued digging through his locker. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù he asked, unphased.
Dean‚Äôs face fell immediately, and Hannah‚Äôs villainous smirk the only thing he could see.
Please follow me on twitter @cxspxn or on tumblr at cxs-pxn for story updates so you know when to expect following updates!!! Thanks so much for reading <3
And he knew that once his mother knew that Dean had moved back, she would welcome him into their home with open arms and he and Sam would always be welcome to be a part of our family again.
‚ÄúCome on, Cas, we can play later. I‚Äôm busy right now.‚Äù
Sam only stuck out his tongue in response. Dean shook his head, unable to shake the smile from his face as he turned to head upstairs to his room so he could drop off his bag. He kicked off his shoes and flopped on his bed, staring up at the ceiling.
The breath caught in Dean‚Äôs throat, and he‚Äôd never felt so much pain course through him with just a set of words from someone‚Äôs mouth. He searched Castiel‚Äôs eyes for something,
Over the next few weeks, Dean and Castiel spent more and more time together. They would break off from Charlie and Gabe to have lunch by themselves, laughing together and working on schoolwork together. They also took turns hanging out at each other‚Äôs houses, and Dean had never felt so warm and content with his life.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs also a lesbian dancing with a disaster bisexual, so she really didn‚Äôt get the luck of the draw today,‚Äù Gabe added. Charlie threw an arm over his shoulders, doubling over in laughter.
‚ÄúH-how could you tell?‚Äù
They both stood up, and looked at each other for the first time since they had gotten to the tree.
Dean shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ Hannah.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy are you so obsessed with me dating someone? If you just want me to bring someone, I could just bring Dean as my not-date.‚Äù Castiel insisted. He really didn‚Äôt want to go to this dance at all. But he felt like between Gabe and Charlie, he wasn‚Äôt going to have a choice.
Mrs. Novak‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ well, if she wouldn‚Äôt mind us stealing you away for an evening, we‚Äôd love to have you!‚Äù
With that she pulled away and got out of the car, the door slamming behind her, leaving Dean with his own deafening thoughts. Dean took a shaky breath and waited to make sure Jo got safely inside before he pulled out of the driveway and headed home himself. Luckily his mom and Sam were passed out on the couch when he got home, some animated movie playing on the tv. He crept up to his room and closed the door before shedding his clothes and falling into bed. He pulled out his phone. He had several missed texts. All from Castiel.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying so hard to‚Ä¶ to
(See the end of the chapter for
He jumped as someone snuck up behind him and threw their hands over his eyes.
And she could see just how much Dean loved Castiel. He looked at him like he was the light at the end of a darkness that felt like it had lasted an eternity. When Castiel granted him the ability to reach out to Cas, she saw the hope in his eyes; the passion, the desire. The possibility that things could go back to the way they were before they‚Äôd been separated. She wanted nothing more than both of her closest friends to be happy, but it looked like Castiel‚Äôs happiness was going to come at the expense of Gabe‚Äôs. And she had no idea what to do.
‚ÄúMe too, Cassie. We should do this more often.‚Äù
‚Ä¶Could it?
With that, she turned and sauntered away, leaving Castiel flushed out of embarrassment. He turned and walked towards his class as quickly as he could. Just one more meeting before he went home from school and he‚Äôd be free of her for the day. Physically, anyway. He‚Äôd have to text her as much as usual though, or she‚Äôd get mad.
‚ÄúGet up here, idiot.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just nervous, she should cut him some slack,‚Äù Dean snapped back, still eyeing the pair of them as Hannah continued dragging Castiel away from them.
around you, you know? You make me feel warm, and safe, and‚Ä¶ and happy. So, so happy‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt keep holding it in like the feeligns weren‚Äôt there. I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù
little games. You get up and you leave when a better offer comes along. That‚Äôs where daddy went, right?‚Äù She folded her arms as a satisfied smirk crossed her face as Dean‚Äôs own expression fell, his resolve crumbling faster than he could try to restore it. ‚ÄúMom and kids weren‚Äôt so great as they used to be, so he found his next dime piece.‚Äù
She brought a hand over her chest, the shock ebbing ever so slightly. ‚ÄúWell, honey, since you seem to enjoy the game so much‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll consider letting you play it as long as Dean is supervising you.‚Äù
He turned and looked at her. Charlie was wearing her signature ‚ÄòI-told-you-so‚Äô smirk.
The dance had passed with no incident and it was nearing 11:30, which meant that Dean had to bring Jo home soon. Dean almost mentally patted himself on the back for not getting involved with Castiel and Hannah. That was, until out of the corner of his eye, he watched as Hannah shoved Castiel into the wall of a darker corner in the venue; he could just barely make out her figure jabbing a threatening finger into Castiel‚Äôs chest before she brought a firm slap across his face. From the gasp next to him, he could tell that Jo had seen it too. His blood boiled, and he couldn‚Äôt stop himself from storming over to them, Jo close on his heel. Charlie and Gabe were quick to follow as soon as they‚Äôd seen that Dean was on the move.
Thanks, as always, for reading! I promise, our precious boy Cas is going to be freed soon. He will be happy again, and everything is gonna be good!
‚ÄúYou know what. I‚Äôm sorry for‚Ä¶ for all the things Hannah must have done to you, to keep you away from me. I was scared, but‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt clueless. I know she approached you on more than one occasion and did horrible things to you.‚Äù
yet. I meant it when I said that I always get what I want.‚Äù
His heart‚Ä¶ fluttered‚Ä¶ what did he want to say that he didn‚Äôt finish? Was it just a typo or was he going to say something else?
‚ÄúListen, Gabe. I know how you feel about me. I‚Äôm a piece of shit, and I know that I‚Äôm not going to change your mind, but‚Ä¶‚Äù
In a moment, Charlie‚Äôs arms were wrapped around Dean and she was ushering him from the cafeteria, Gabe close behind them. Dean fell into Charlie‚Äôs embrace and sobbed, telling her about how Hannah has threatened him with Castiel‚Äôs safety and his own.
Jo blushed again and relaxed into her seat. ‚ÄúI never would have taken you for such a charmer, Winchester.‚Äù
Was that‚Ä¶ was that what it was supposed to feel like? When you liked kissing someone? He‚Äôd never felt his heart hammer in his chest like that when Hannah kissed him. But‚Ä¶ it was borderline uncomfortable the way his heart was racing. He was sure he was about to pass out. That couldn‚Äôt be right‚Ä¶
Castiel shook his head. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt
They eventually made it to the end of the day. Castiel had never been at his locker so fast in his life. He swung it open, grabbed out all the books he needed, and slammed the locker shut. He didn‚Äôt even attempt to put the books in his bag; he just hauled ass to the parking lot so he could meet up with Gabe and they could get the hell out of there.
‚ÄúSorry, I couldn‚Äôt find the damn book I was looking for.‚Äù Castiel was getting concerned about how easily he was able to lie about his feelings. ‚ÄúReady to go to work?‚Äù
Castiel‚Äôs arms loosened ever so slightly as he thought. He and Hannah had kissed several times. They‚Äôd never really gone much further than that, thankfully. Castiel never
‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Dean laughed. ‚ÄúNo fair, that‚Äôs cheating!‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is the first time we‚Äôve talked since we started sixth grade,‚Äù Castiel said softly, deep in his thoughts. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôve initiated conversation since the third‚Ä¶‚Äù
Dean started where he sat, pausing where he‚Äôd been flipping through pages in his textbook. He looked up at Castiel, and Castiel could have sworn a light blush was painting the other‚Äôs cheeks.
‚ÄúWe can call off work if you aren‚Äôt feeling it. My dad will understand. You look like the last thing you need is to deal with people right now.‚Äù
Jo shook her head, smiling. ‚ÄúYou have nothing to make up for, Winchester. You were trying to protect your friend, and I think that‚Äôs really noble of you. And like I‚Äôve already told you, I still had a lot of fun.‚Äù Jo smiled sweetly, then paused, thinking for a moment. ‚Äú‚Ä¶but if you want to take me out on a second date, I might be inclined to say yes. Hopefully we won‚Äôt have to swoop in and save Castiel next time around.‚Äù
In about 10 minutes his response was the soft crunching of leaves as Dean approached him. They exchanged no words, and instead pulled each other into a crushing embrace. It had been so long since they‚Äôd hugged each other under this tree for the last time 8 years ago. They held each other for a long time, quietly crying into the shoulder of the other.
He mustered the sincerest smile he could when he met Hannah‚Äôs gaze as she walked out of her class. He watched as her eyes narrowed as she watched Dean Winchester leave the classroom and make his way towards his next class. Castiel turned and saw that Dean was returning a look of similar intensity. For just a moment, his eyes flicked up to meet Castiel‚Äôs, and he saw the concern immediately flood his eyes. Before Castiel could do anything, Hannah grabbed either side of his face and pulled him back towards her, crashing her lips against his.
He eventually wiped the tears from his eyes and sniffed back the ones that still wanted to fall. He‚Äôd regained some of his composure; enough to get him through class, anyway. Eventually the bell rang, and he was able to blend into the rush leaving the lunch room and make his way back to his classroom. His friends were great, so he knew that Charlie would be sitting in English and he knew that she would have grabbed his things for him from the cafeteria.
Castiel sucked in a quick breath as he looked up to meet Charlie‚Äôs expectant gaze.
As always, thank you for reading! Let me know what you guys are thinking.
‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù she said thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWell, you may not be interested in my
That would get him out of whatever funk he was in thinking about Castiel.
Again, Dean shook his head to clear the thoughts there. Castiel had both hands on either of Dean‚Äôs shoulders; he must have been trying to shake him out of his stupor.
Dean smiled. ‚ÄúNo please necessary, sweetheart. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù
‚ÄúI should have stepped up, I shouldn‚Äôt have let her‚Äî.‚Äù
This time it was Hannah who blushed. She pulled out a pen and ripped off the corner of one of the posters. She hastily scribbled down her phone number and handed it to Castiel. ‚ÄúText me sometime, Novak.‚Äù
Charlie smirked and elbowed him in the ribs.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all right, Winchester,‚Äù he said, clapping him on the shoulder. With that, Gabe shoved his hands in his pockets and made his way down the hall to his own class. Dean couldn‚Äôt help his small smile as he opened the door and tried to avoid the prying eyes that burned through him as he walked back to his seat.
Castiel followed him downstairs and they each shared one more smile before he left. Once outside, Gabe let out a deep breath.
‚ÄúWhat on earth is going on in here?‚Äù he asked, trying and failing to keep the laughter out of his voice.
‚ÄúOh, yeah. Sorry to keep you. I‚Äôll text you later?‚Äù
‚ÄúI guess I should have guessed. Everyone sees the way you look at him.‚Äù
