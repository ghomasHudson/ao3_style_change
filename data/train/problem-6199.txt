Clint cried – so, he’d stolen the phone off of Natasha then. “And I swear to God Stark if my balls freeze off because of-”
“Relax babe,” Tony said, still feeling giddy. “You hadn’t even made it down the stairs yet.”
mind. You’re not the only variable in this, Tony is as well.”
“FRI,” Tony said, his voice low, “where’s the nearest ATM machine?”
Tony was about to respond when Steve returned, a bottle of juice in one hand, and a bag of flour in another. “Joan has started selling flour Tony!” He said, his eyes glittering in excitement. “We literally have everything you need.”
Tony was a sap, that’s what he was. He couldn’t wait for the others to get back, that’d help him reel his emotions back a bit. The only thing Tony was missing was a big, glaring, neon sign shouting ‘I love you, Steve!’, that’s how obvious he was being.
"That's still too far away," Natasha said.
Tony wasn’t sure how he felt, but the idea that Steve saw him as a man who didn’t gallantly scream he was a genius, but actually backed it up with – frankly, incredible work that spoke for itself, the knowledge that Steve recognised that in him; it was rather touching. It was also strange, and not something Tony wanted to analyse too closely, but he found he liked it.
“I – I don’t know what you want me to say.”
righted those wrongs. Steve doesn’t care about this bullshit looking glass you’ve thrust yourself onto, he cares about how
Natasha audibly gasped as they left the cave.  The mouth of the cave lead the group into a sunny, secluded valley. Around them stretched a never ending sea of gold and marble, with designs etched in that were reminiscent towards 1930’s art deco. Natasha ran her hands along the stone, marvelling at how smooth it felt under her fingers. In front of her, long columns towered into an archway, with vines with white flowers wrapped around them. They were planted in white pots at the base of the columns, with little intricate golden leaves grooved onto the hem of the pots.
Tony swallowed.
, he wished the 21
A man who had invited Tony on the motorbike he had devoted all his spare time and energy too.
Good.
he needed, “a shower too, J. Get it ready for me so I can be fast?”
And he still wasn’t sure if this time was different.
Steve looked down at the floor, trying to breathe. It wouldn’t do any good to get into a screaming match, quite frankly Steve didn’t have the energy. His arms were crossed – when did that happen? Steve decided he quite liked it, it made him feel safer, as if there were a barrier protecting him from the evolving shame and anger that had settled around his racing heart.
Then he felt Steve relax against him, most likely falling back to sleep.
He jogged to the garage, hoping to beat Steve there and take hold of one of his cars. If Tony was there first, there wouldn’t be any awkward ‘oh but let me drive’ conversations, and Tony really didn’t want to have to deal with that.
Emine smiled at him, the same warm smile from earlier. “No, you’re not. You know, you’re the first person I’ve ever seen Steve bring to the markets, you must have a special relationship with each other.”
. Like something they should have always been doing, like them making pancakes, doing something simple and domestic, something that required teamwork for the sake of teamwork and food, should always have been part of their existence.
“Is it about the bet?”
Tony lowered his glasses and took a moment to revel as the recognition grew on her face. “Yeah, I kinda can imagine it.”
Steve after all. “That sounds great.”
. All he wanted were some goddamn pancakes, and this was turning into a Tolkein like quest.
sees you, which is kind, generous, and really fucking stupid.
And Tony was crying too, and so lifted a shaking hand and running it through Steve’s hair. There was a rawness to Tony's tears, like he too, had been containing something awful he had to let out.
“Ah,” FRIDAY grinned, “so Ms. Romanov has a weakness.”
Not that Tony was thinking about that.
“Yeah." Tony put on a surprisingly accurate Bill Clinton imitation. “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”
going on, and Tony loved it.
He was beautiful.
Thor rolled his eyes before unwrapping a muffin. “We have a bet on which girl will receive the white rose on the bachelor. Natasha thinks it will happen next week.”
Steve nodded and dutifully took the bowl, whisking away, his tongue sticking out of his mouth in just that wonderful adorable way that made Tony’s heart melt. Oh.
So yes, they knew Tony loved flowers.
Steve scrunched up his face as he crouched down in front of the hearth, and Tony told himself it wasn’t adorable. “Of course I wasn’t going to make you wait, the fire isn’t more important than you.”
Tony shook his head, sliding into one of the counter chairs. “I went out to get some – but the corner store is only taking cash, of which I have zilch.”
“Or flour.” He whispered, his brain at an absolute loss. How on Earth did he exist in a place that didn’t have the basic ingredients for pancakes? Tony frowned into the darkness. What could he do, how could he get his pancakes?
Tony Stark.”
“There’s no damage to control captain, so… no. The animal we saw was incredible, and now we’re home.”
Tony froze.
A man who looked at Tony like he was the only thing worth looking at, who smiled like all was right in the world when Tony showed the slightest indication that he was happy.
“That’s all you care about?” Natasha asked coyly.
The bell clattered as he opened the door, the cold air billowing in behind his as he entered the warm store. A tired head perked up at the counter. “Hey there! What can I do for you?”
His stomach growled.
Not that Tony would think about that
Tony loved it.
Steve pulled them into a bay right beside the entrance of the marketplace, and switched the engine off. “This is why I wanted to take the bike, parking’s terrible here.”
But that was beside the point –
. Seriously, I recommend you don’t know.”
“Aw, et tu Brucie-bear?”
“Here’s an idea,” Natasha said, “why don’t you just tell him this?”
to heal; and don’t let it heal whilst you’ve still got dirt and grime trapped under all this shredded skin. That’s just idiotic.”
Steve swallowed, then smiled tentatively at Tony. “Good, that’s, that’s good.”
. Steve’s hair hung over his face, his sweat gluing it to his skin. He was panting, his chest heaving as breathed haggard, ignored breaths. The wrappings around his hands had fallen to the ground, bloody and in tatters; no doubt Steve was in there stripping the flesh from his knuckles with each hit, using the rough skin of the punching bag as a violent sandpaper.
Steve was positive that no matter how long it took, Tony
“I’d hope not,” Steve said. “Because you’ve worked so hard to improve your understanding of your tech, and improve the quality of your work, I wouldn’t want that to be cheapened by the idea that someone just handed that to you. You work hard Tony, it’s amazing.”
“Eh, I’ve seen photo’s,” Tony said, he wandered over to one of his car’s, at this moment he didn’t really care which one he drove, he just wanted to be the one driving. “So barring my exceptional style,” he patted the hood of his Maserati. “We ready to go?”
Steve didn’t know what he would do if Tony didn’t make it.
“First time for everything,” Tony said, adjusting it counter clockwise until it was free of the clutch release. “Are there any other brackets keeping it in place?”
contributed. Each one had something they could give Tony, something to lull him back to the land of the living. Then there was Steve, sitting there, fretting.
“So let me tell you this, Tony. When I say that man has not brought a person here before, that, that man has not shared this part of his life with another person, that is important. I don’t know what your relationship with his is like after the accords, or after the atrocity that was The Dusting, but you
Tony had decided to dump the disguise, and cleaned up his appearance. He ditched his beloved hoodie for a t-shirt Peter had gotten him from Wall-Mart (it had a cool design on it, and Peter had gotten it for him, so of course he loved it), and threw on a blazer and trousers. He even shaved, and styled his hair.
Well technically, Tony literally had done that, earlier, with the markets.
of disliking it because it was the start of the workweek. No, Natasha didn’t like Monday’s because they were the most unpredictable day of the week. Something unusual would
“If you too are too busy eating each-other’s faces off, are you going to eat these burnt pancakes or can I have them?” Sam asked, who had apparently just come inside.
Bruce grinned. “That's $10 my way then.”
. Bruce won the bet.

Tony stuck his hand out to shake hers, grateful for a moment that Steve was holding his left hand instead of his right. “Tony, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“And I expect another $50 from each of you.”
She placed the flower behind her ear and they continued onward, Tony with Steve’s hand clutched into his, winding through the mass of crowds again. Natasha smirked, nudging Clint as they hurried after the superidiots. Clint winked triumphantly, grabbing her hand so they could keep up. Those two hadn’t let go of one another yet, she wondered if they had realised.
“Yeah,” FRIDAY said, “the Boss left a couple of hours ago, he went straight to the roof. The Captain found him about thirty minutes or so ago.” She notably didn’t answer Thor’s question.
“Yes,” Tony said, suddenly, because he did, didn’t he? Even after everything, Tony would always trust Steve, because Steve trusted him. Taking a deep breath, Tony took Steve’s hand. “I trust you.”
Tonight’s Korma curry was evidence of that.
Steve face fell a fraction, before he twisted it into what Tony supposed Steve
“Dammit,” Tony cried, wheeling himself over. “I’ll take apart your motor functions and donate you to a public college, don’t you think I won’t.”
Steve blinked dramatically, as if he was just acknowledging the outside world. He pulled back suddenly, leaving Tony to mourn the loss of his warmth immediately. “Right, of course.”
Dum-E ignored him.
“But my mum has always cut my hair,” The girl said. “So Peter called me to ask and then Kamala called-”
be nervous.
“Eggs,” Tony said abruptly, jerking back awkwardly. “We need eggs, for pancakes.”
“You know for a genius, you’re an idiot.” Steve mused, one of his hands moving to cup Tony’s cheek, forcing him to look at Steve. “I love you too.”
“Oh my god,” the girl said. “You’re
“Thank you Nurse Palmer, we’ll talk about it.” Natasha said.
Which Tony
“I’m still confused,” Steve said as he grabbed his jacket. “Why do we need to go down to the corner store again?”
“Of course I did,” Steve said. He shrugged. “Besides, they took the key, and I didn’t want your balls following Clint’s fate of-”
“Jarvis,” Tony asked. “where are the others?”
Clint said, “
“Not to my knowledge Boss, I believe the last time you had cash was when you hoped the girl scouts would come with some cookies.”
A man who had noticed and acknowledged Tony’s relationship with kids, that he was worthy and good enough to be a mentor.
“Hello friends!” Thor’s boisterous voice boomed through the speakers. “I trust all is going well in the cabin!” Ha, Tony was right, it was a cabin.
“You’re not going to tell us what they’re doing, are you?” Natasha said.
kind of deal, that kind of warranted a favour.
From the depth to his eyes, to the gentleness in his expressions, to the kindness in his voice. He was breathtaking in his generous touch, to the intensity of his sincere honesty, to the way he held Tony, as though there was nothing in the world Steve would rather hold, would rather protect. Perhaps this is what people meant when they said Steve was chivalrous, that he was a gentleman. Not one of trite politeness, obligation, or duty, but of one with an incredible soul.
“Look, I can access any data in the world and have a 24/7 view of the house, but I can’t read minds,” FRIDAY said, “one moment he was fine, then after breakfast he wasn’t. I’m curious!”
He hadn’t thought there was anything better than flying in the armour, the freedom of being in the skies, the ability to go anywhere, as fast as he wanted, but this, this rivalled it. There was a visceral difference between driving a car, comfortable inside it, and being propelled upon a motorbike, holding on while it goes about its own existence, carrying you forward.

, Steve had almost lost him, and Steve had been
And that had always been part of the problem, hadn’t it.
"The emergency services are on the other side of Manhattan, what other options are there?" Clint asked.
Tony wheezed, almost like a laugh. “Stark? I must be in trouble.”
“Always.”
“Although Natasha’s right,” Tony said, because he was not admitting that Clint was. “It
Thor poked one of the roast chickens with his fork – there were three, they had to feed super-soldiers and a god, after all. “What could be taking them so long?”
“Why the hell do you think that?” Tony asked.
“You can do that?” Natasha asked.
Jarvis had always like Pepper more than him.
The grip on Steve’s hand tightened. “Hmm, it’s bright.” He mumbled.
Tony couldn’t help the grin that grew on his face. He had said it, and he could say it again. “I love you Steve Rogers, I love you.”
“I guess.”
Tony wasn’t surprised by that at all.
Tony spluttered. “What? I just told you, my track record, my past, my-”
Tony rolled his eyes, but his grin betrayed him.
Steve perked up. “You didn’t.”
“Oh…” Tony breathed, because he didn’t know what to say, he didn’t have anything to say, but he knew he needed to say something.
Emine locked eyes with Tony, her grin softening into a warm, genuine smile. “Somehow, I doubt that.”
Tony took a shallow breath, suddenly peculiarly conscious of the way he was wrapped in his big, strong arms, which seemed very protective, secure. Tony felt surprisingly at ease in them.
"Can you even fly it?" Clint asked, coming towards them. He bit his lip, looking over at Tony with a wince.
“Yeah, they have the best eggs. Emine, the woman who sells them, sometimes she gives me a half price discount if I’m charming enough, it’s actually rather sweet.”
He rubbed over the phantom pain where his heart surgery had occurred all those years ago, willing the ache of loss to subside. Sometimes he wished there was something permanent there besides the scar, something to explain away his emotions so he wouldn’t have to acknowledge them.
“I missed the dinosaurs!” Thor bemoaned, “I’m thousands of years old and I
“Actually,” Steve said. “Since we’ve gone to all this trouble to make pancakes, I was hoping I could have some too, and help make them?”
“That’s too risky,” Natasha said. “You’d be going too fast and he doesn’t have protection, he wouldn’t stay stable.”
his mind supplied. Making him feel safer in water because humanities amphibian ancestors used water to stay safe. It was soothing.
If she subtly watched them throughout the night, that was her business.
his teeth grind against each other as he clenched his jaw and – ah, that was why it hurt.
It was almost as if the rest of the world had melted away.
Which was a feat, because it truly was amazing.
Natasha ignored him, focusing on the clack of her nails against the wooden grain. When they had told him about this dinner, Steve had taken it upon himself to cook everything earlier that day. What could be taking him so long to actually show up?
Riri ducked her head behind her hair. She seemed to hiss something back at him which Tony couldn’t hear, but was evidently funny if Steve’s reaction was anything to go by. Which reminded Tony…
After all, Clint’s deadline was today.
Bruce would take the eating tray and use it as a make shift desk, doing some sort of theoretical science and ‘bouncing ideas off of Tony’, as he put it.
Although…
Steve nodded, swallowing. “Okay, thanks Natasha.”
Tony’s face fell slack, his eye’s going almost comically wide. “Really?” He asked, his voice so full of fear it broke Steve heart.
FRIDAY chuckled. “Touché Ms. Romanov, touché.”
“Or just give me five less next week.”
The corner store was unique for Manhattan, it was similar to the bodega’s out in Washington Heights than the kind of stores around this part of town, but Tony had always been grateful for this place. It had been here for as long as Tony had remembered, and lovely Jewish man who owned it had set up the perfect snack aisle for a small four year old to get lost inside of.
Tony nodded dumbly, not trusting himself to speak. It was moments like this that he couldn’t believe Steve was even real. The man would just, put Tony’s bag in his bedroom, without a second thought.
“Well sir,” Jarvis said. “I seemed to have learnt it from the master.”
She gestured around her booth, where dozens upon dozens of egg cartons sat. “Well, it’s not like you’re not spoiled for choice here.”
“But it doesn’t. Thor would only be able to hold Tony with one hand, I can use both. I can hold him to my chest and run for it.”
They weaved their way through the hustle and bustle of the crowd, bumping into people, and stepping on toes. Tony tried to apologise to people as they passed, but they were always gone, or Steve and Tony had moved to far away before Tony had realised. Shopkeepers screamed out offers at the top of their voices, others were scribbling on chalkboard signs with haste, and in the centre were three rickety picnic tables that were filled with parents each trying to rally their children in.
The door opened and Tony stumbled in rubbing the back of his neck. “Sorry I’m late, I got a bit… side tracked.”
Steve glanced down at Tony, grinning wider when he caught Tony looking. “Come on,” he said, and before Tony could respond, Steve had taken Tony’s hand in his.
her grandmother would have made it. Natasha didn’t have a lot of memories from her childhood, before the red room anyway…
Natasha pinched his wrist. Steve winced. “It improves my skill, but that’s beside the point. My question stands and
Steve almost laughed at how
At the ring of the bell, Kamala paused, and met his gaze, her eyes almost comically popping out of her skull. “Omg.”
“Steve,” Natasha said, “stop being a coward and woo your boy already.”
“There’s a spare key in the water dish for the third plant to the right of the door,” Tony hurried, trying to erase the mental image Clint had oh-so-helpfully planted into Tony’s brain. “Use that to get in.”
Steve had been right though, the curry was so mild, he was surprised there was any chili at all. But they had cooked it together, all grossly domestic.
Steve rummaged through one of them, pulling up a cloth holder that was similar to Pepper’s travel makeup case. Tony had never been so meticulous with his tools, often just throwing what he needed into a box and hoping for the best. “What do you need?”
And the shirt was
, interjected.
“Look, you don’t want to hurt him, you want him to know that you’re not going to hurt him,
Riri furrowed her brow. “Yeah, I am.”
Kamala shrugged like it was nothing, taking three bags out and packing them with ease. “Alright, so with tax, your total’s $19.90.”
Steve groaned. “Why have they locked us in Tony’s family winter mansion?”
Was he really
He had pretended that he wasn’t disappointed, and Natasha had bought him a couple of boxes of cinnamon cookies – how she remembered those were his favourite, he didn’t want to ask, but, it wasn’t what he’d been excited about in the first place.
people who realise they’re in love with someone, often start the process of wooing them – not going out of their way to indirectly beat themselves up.”
Well, Tony’s law.
, that wasn’t the reaction he was aiming for. “It was a joke. Sorry, I didn’t mean to overstep.”
He also loved Steve, who had just so happened to give him a flower.
“…And you chose… I want to say office casual?”
with the prospect of asking for a favour.
Well really, it was only to fix some minor bugs that about ten people had complained about – apparently the browser app was too slow too respond. But still.
Scribbling on the paper hat quickly, Tony stood, before marching over to Dum-E.
“It’s only good because the people make it good.”
getting hotter right – or was that just him?
“I’ve got your drugs!” Kamala cried as she emerged from the back of the store. “Well – the Advil, not illegal stuff, we don’t do that, I don’t either. Don’t do illegal stuff.”
be in love with him, he’s my best friend! He’s – he’s Tony. He’s
Which was why it was the absolute worst time for a spontaneous phone call. “Jarvis?” Tony asked over the ring tone. “Who the hell is calling me at…” Tony checked his watch, huh, it was midday. “Never mind, just… who’s calling?”
Natasha blinked. She hadn’t, she was thinking of Pepper. She raised an eyebrow. “Really, you’re asking me that?”
“You realised you’re in love with Tony. Right.” Natasha said pragmatically, because that was obvious. “However, it doesn’t explain how you’ve interpreted that towards bloodying up Tony’s supply of punching bags that
Tony was immediately intrigued, he loved meeting these kids who didn’t just have the potential to change the future, but already were. Harley, Peter, Shuri, these kids were the way towards the future, and Tony could only gawk and watch as they built from the ground up, doing things Tony could only dream of. Tony just felt blessed that he got to watch, that he got to say that somehow, he had
Steve laughed, handing her a 20 before Tony could even realise a transaction was taking place. “Of course not, you know that you’re my favourite person here, Emine.”
And as much as he had cared about Steve, Tony had known that his life wouldn’t include the other man again.
been in the workshop for well over 15 hours.”
It all felt rather silly now, Steve supposed. The workshop was Tony’s own personal sketchbook and yet, Steve had been welcomed here with open arms. Yet… It did not ease the sting Steve felt.
Steve glanced the table, as if trying to work out if anyone else had noticed. When his gaze rested on Natasha, she winked.
Tony wasn’t sure if this was a good plan, or an insane one. He wasn’t sure he Steve would react, he didn’t want Steve putting up his walls, going all Captain America on Kamala. Whilst she’d probably enjoy it at first, she seemed like the kind of girl who would notice it was fake, and she deserved something better than that. At the same time, what if Kamala was overly…
Because Tony loved Steve, and was so willing to give Steve his hear, knowing that Steve would keep his heart safe.
Tony winked. “It’s a surprise, obviously,” he gestured to the door. “C’mon we got places to be.”
"You get some sort of weird joy out making us all jump, don’t you?”
you’re my protector now,” Tony joked, trying to get back into the swing of things.
“I take offence to that,” Steve said with mirth. “I do seem to remember that just this morning I told you that Natasha dressed me,
” (4)
When they had left, Tony had three more numbers, and a promise that he would watch out for Riri in MIT, and see the suit in person.
“Which side of the bed would you like?” Tony asked.
Steve realised he was in love with Tony on Saturday.
Tony gripped Steve’s hand tight. “Oh Winghead, I didn’t go anywhere.”
“Right,” Tony said, grabbing his wallet and sunglasses by his bedside table. “Let’s make some pancakes.”
“He made me Bruschetta, Nat.
Century.”
casual.”
Kamala gapped at Peter. “You
“Would Steve show if Tony wasn’t here?” Bruce asked.
Natasha pulled herself up from the linoleum floor. “Yeah of course.”
“He’s so special. He’s so good, and kind, loyal, and too generous for his own good. He – he runs a company, his own business, he mentors kids and he’s leading the fight for green energy! He’s throws himself into everything he does, he’s incredible!
Steve coughed, almost like he was self-conscious, and gestured to the garage door where a –
Tony screwed up his nose like there was a bad smell. Whilst Tony and Steve, like the rest of them, loved the mind numbing trivialities of a good reality TV Show, Tony couldn’t stand The Bachelor, and without Tony there, Steve wouldn’t watch it. It was a good excuse, and easily explained why there was a bet that the their superhero parents weren’t involved in. Natasha would have to make more muffins for Thor, he was good at getting them out of a jam.
“Huh”. Clint said.
“Yeah Riri is amazing Tony,” Peter said grinning, and Tony loved that about Peter. He was so unconditionally supportive of the people he cared about. “I’ve seen some of the stuff she’s made, it’s awesome.”
Natasha dumped her bag by the door and stalked towards him, cracking her knuckles. Steve ignored her – or rather, he hadn’t noticed her enter in the first place. The sharp trace of iron hit Natasha like a sharp punch to the gut. It was one she was unfortunately, intimately familiar with. She grimaced as its presence mingled with the tangy odour of sweat from the gym.   Steve didn’t seem to notice
That was the difference between this, and his armour. Tony, in the armour, had full control, from the way it turned, moved, flew, and existed. Steve’s motorbike, on the other hand, was almost like it was a beast of its own, allowing them upon it out of it’s own goodwill. Tony was a passenger, completely at the will of Steve and his bike.
Clint wasn’t winning the bet.
It was naïve, to believe they had ever stood a chance.
“Not to do with you or your tech,” Thor amended, “but with me. It didn’t seem to recognise my hands… I couldn’t use it.”
Clint groaned. “Steve, man, why couldn’t you have made the first move!”
“He’s done that?” Natasha asked.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Don’t get me wrong, the guy is funny. But straight people can be dumb as all hell.” She said. “Steve, it has meaning, it will have meaning to Tony. You were just going about your day, and you saw something that reminded you of Tony, that you bought
anything that mattered? Tony was going to –
“Tony,” Bruce said, “don’t encourage it.”
Natasha refused to take no for an answer, and tugged Steve’s arm slightly before walking off. She listened for Steve’s begrudging footsteps before sliding into the side room where the first aid kit was. “Sit.” She ordered when he had entered.
“Yes, thank you, that’d be good.”
too nice for that.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “I happen to be a pretty decent chef FRI, besides, making pancakes is a
Steve’s gaze fell onto Tony’s clothes for a moment. “Do you often wear this to the markets?” He asked. In any other circumstance Tony would be affronted – he dressed well thank you, but Steve sounded genuinely curious, not accusatory.
How had Tony not known earlier, how had he not realised it. He stood there dumbfounded as Steve whisked the pancake batter, barely taking stock of it as he stared at this dorky, frustrating, incredible man.
“Of course, Ms. Romanov.”
Natasha nudged Bruce with her head, she was sitting on the floor in front of him and Thor, buried in a bean bag. “We should’ve moved movie night to Valentine’s Day.”
Tony couldn’t tell who leapt off of the sofa first as they raced to the door. How could he have been so stupid. They had let hours pass them by. What if they’d gotten lost, or been attacked. If they’d been attacked… Something would have to be strong enough to keep them away for hours, and that meant that they could be hurt.
Clint looked pointedly towards her hand, her nails clicking aggressively on the table, then back at her. “Right.”
“I love you.” Tony blurted out, before realising what he had even said.
Awkward silence lingered in the air for a moment.
” Natasha breathed, standing from the table. (12)
Tony’s heart swooped, and for a moment, he couldn’t be happier.
, but it’s the same thing that Mother Gothel used to hide the tower in Tangled, so I figured, why not.”
Steve’s eyes reminded him of the Waitomo Caves in New Zealand. Blue, and exciting, and so vibrant they could light up the deepest crevices of a cave. His eyes sparkled in front of Tony, which should have been impossible in this weather, but yet they glittered in the overcast sky. Tony was entranced, awestruck. He had never seen the caves in person, but looking at Steve’s eyes, he didn’t think he needed to.
Splayed out like a starfish on his bed, he rolled over to check the time; 7am, heaps of time. He couldn’t remember when he’d collapsed into bed. He figured it was early to have ended up here. How long had he spent in the lab? It didn’t matter, he was in bed now and-
Natasha raised an eyebrow at him, then patted the space beside her. "Come on."  Tony shuffled down next to her, rubbing his hands together. Natasha reached over and covered his hands with her own, stopping him. "First of all," she said, "you're a self-deprecating fool. Second, has it ever occurred to you that the only reason your bullshit ‘I’m an evil war profiteer’ excuse exists is because
sketchbook. Tony swallowed loudly – or maybe not, Steve couldn’t really tell if it was loud or if the serum just helped him pick it up over the growing ringing in his ears.
Tony was, quite frankly, incredibly proud of Steve. Over time, Steve had taken to the whole the-future-is-now-my-present thing in his stride, and had branched out his knowledge of the world through food and cooking.
Tony whispered something in Steve’s ear and the pair walked off, saying how they would be back soon and only take a moment.
“But thank you for fanning my ego,” she said. “I left something in the back for you.”
He was absolutely perfect.
Bruce waved a hand. “It’s fairly innocent.”
“Yes Tony, it’s
Thor bit his lip, and spoke in the softest voice Natasha had ever heard from the man. “That I love them.”
Steve, with his bruised lips and blissed out smile, stroked Tony’s face reverently, as if he was the most precious thing Steve had ever held. “You love me?”
) decked out in awful Christmas clothing, from an ugly,
And the phone hung up.
Kamala giggled. “Riri is building something pretty incredible, Sam’s helping.”
Thor turned to Steve as they walked down, the path, stopping sporadically to marvel at the president – or the statue. “Who was president whilst you fought in your great war?”
No, no.
“Oh yeah of course,” Tony snarked good naturedly. “Hydra’s most evil property is it’s fashion.”
“The shower's free.” Tony said at the same time Steve said. “I’m going to go shower now.”
Tony heart in his ribcage. Tony would be completely exposed, there would be nothing separating the pair except the leather jacket that Steve was slipping into.
“I just need your typical ingredients for pancakes,” Tony said. Kamala smiled but it was forced, her heartrate elevated –
He dropped the bag next to his. “Thank you again Tony, for all of this,” he gestured around the space. “What you’re doing for the team, it’s pretty amazing.”
“Bruce bet 50, you’re fine Clint.” Natasha said.
Or worse.
happened before, ever, in their entire lives, in their entire time knowing each other, Tony and Steve had never spent time together like this before. Sure, they would watch movies, or play board games, but that was always in group settings.
was about, but he was sure that it meant something significant between Happy and Tony, so he was sure Tony would appreciate it.
Clint’s mouth formed an ‘o’ shape, but his eyes were sparkling. Natasha walked over and took his hand, he looked like he was about to cry. “That’s, that’s really awesome Tony.”
The cave was dark and small, Natasha could barely see a thing beyond the heads of her friends, but she didn’t feel trapped here, or claustrophobic. Natasha didn’t want to admit it, and she easily had the ability to lie to herself, but, she knew she deserved better than that. Natasha felt safe here,

Natasha crouched beside Steve, taking the hand that Steve hadn’t taken. Her voice was uncharacteristically strained as she took in the armour. “I swear to god Stark, if you’re thinking of dying now-”
“No, I’m testing a strain of HIV, it’ll eat into the day, I won’t be able to get out of the lab.”
That wasn’t important.
be one of those. He knows where we stand with one another, I know where we stand with one another, and I won’t take advantage of that – or him.”
“You totally will.” Tony said with a grin, burying himself under multiple blankets and throwing them over Steve as well.
People were excited to see what he had done.
They had never allowed themselves to grow comfortable around each other, not to an extent that actually mattered. They got to know each other on a surface level, and never gave each other the opportunity to understand each other, make mistakes and amend them, and give them another go.
Clint whistled. “That’s the perfect meme.”
And he was gone.
He ran his hand along his chest, trailing the various scarring from all the different events that had gone through in the last ten or so years. The sharp nicks from the shrapnel, the raised angry network of veins from the palladium poisoning, and the jagged curve of Steve’s shield.
Steve hadn’t realised he was angry until Tony had said it again, Tony’s large eyes boring into Steve like a dear caught in headlights. Steve scoffed humourlessly, his stomach constricting as bile rose up his throat. “Oh it doesn’t?” Steve snapped, “go on, humour me with some sort of elaborate lie, what the hell does this look like then?”
Tony could feel the friction of the bitumen road 5 inches below his foot. It was so blurry he couldn’t focus on it, yet it was
“Ah yeah, Afghanistan.” Tony said by ways of explanation, scurrying over to his bag.
Tony had forgotten just how
He pulled himself out of bed as FRIDAY continued. “Boss, I don’t believe we have eggs.”
Which was mostly a good thing, considering the Avengers now lived with him in his childhood home on Fifth Avenue.
“Could we – maybe, take a selfie? Please?” Kamala asked.
“Wait,” Tony breathed, excitement bubbling. “You’re Riri Williams?”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “It’s Sunday, Steve. On Sundays you always have over easy eggs on toast at 7:30 in the morning, and it’s 7:20 now.”
A man who – a man who Tony loved.
to see Steve do that.
Tony lit up whenever he was surrounded by anything to do with florals. Be it actual flowers, clothing, the myriad of artworks Steve did (although, he probably loved those because Steve made them too), or the design of the take away coffee cup from that cart he and Natasha went to the other day.
“I’m showering!” Tony said at the same time as Steve.
“So… apparently we’re trapped here,” Steve said, swallowing before smiling softly “wanna play cards?”
“But who made the first move?” Thor asked.
“U!” He called out, gesticulating quickly. “C’mere, grab me that marker over there.”
“What?” Tony asked, “why do you care?”
out of trust.
“Oh, right,” Steve said. “Of course, the scars…”
It was the perfect plan.
Tony smiled at Steve, which was easy, it
“Yeah,” Tony said, his voice small, “it spreads everywhere too, all over the country. The grey ones are introduced, but the purple ones are native. They often mix together though like a flowers version of a circus.”
“Eggs,” Tony said, marvelling at how steadfast this woman was. If he aged half as gracefully as she has, he’d be damn grateful. “I’m making pancakes.”
She took the antiseptic, her voice taking a softer edge. “This will hurt.”
With a wicked smirk, Emine turned and snuck round the back of the curtain f her stall, before pulling out a small take out container.
Bruce snorted, juice coming out of his nose. In a rush he was clutching it, moaning whilst Clint cackled beside him, his spoon clattering to the floor. Natasha put a hand to her mouth, chuckling and trying not to snort in the process. Beside her, Thor howled, shaking the table as he lay on it, laughing mercilessly.
FRIDAY dropped some golden lights around the table. “Congrats Ms. Romanov.” She winked.
All of it.
“No,” Clint defended, “of course I care about Tony, don’t be dumb. All I’m saying is, you need to admit when you’re wrong.”
And he’d gotten the idea from some
Tony waved a hand in the air, his arm dangling above him like a tree. “No, no, I won’t support a company that takes advantage of their employees like that,” with a groan, he sat up, blinking at the darkness in his room. “I’ll just make some then.”
Just like Pepper, but he didn’t mention
“Actually, speaking of eggs, I have a favour to ask…” Tony said, biting the bullet and just spitting it out.
The kid sitting on the shopping counter waved. “Sam, hi.”
miserable. Tony had the urge to do something, to comfort Steve, to comfort himself. “I love you too,” his voice wavered, finally cracking under the emotional and almost exhilarating tension between them.
“How do I do that?”
Steve’s gaze was glued to tightening the chain, his brow furrowed in concentration and his tongue poking out slightly. Tony felt himself smile, his cheeks rise in delight as he watched Steve at work. It was
“I would have broken that door if you’d been any slower.” Steve said mid-sentence, before resuming his quiet narration.
“Oh my God.” Bruce breathed, his eyes almost budging out of his skull.
Tony paused, squinting as he tracked his movements in his mind.
“Or flour, Boss.”
Clint, of all people, worked out the best way to deal with her. Apparently she acted like a knockoff Poison Ivy – some anti-hero in the comics he liked, and so he shot her down a peg or two.
Tony laughed, letting his head fall into Steve’s chest.
Tony shrugged. “It’s just
He wasn’t sure how he hadn’t noticed it before, but Steve’s eyes were just
FRIDAY raised her hands in a placating gesture. “Of course not,” she shrugged, “besides, if it’s any consolation, you can only tell that you react if you’re looking for it. Clint stumbled into a window the other day when I appeared.”
Thor bit the inside of his cheek. “Do humans have a worse word for idiot, because that’s what they are. But yes, I’ve got it in my dinosaur coin bank on my dinosaur shelf.”
Steve grinned at Tony like that was the best news he had ever heard, and it warmed things inside Tony he had once told himself he’d never let Steve effect again. “What do you need?”
“Go, Steve”, Thor said, and for a moment, Steve was guilty he hadn’t noticed Thor return earlier. “We can wait.”
Natasha put the antiseptic down and looked at Steve. She reached up and tapped his temple. “What’s going on in here? Why are you so rattled?”
“Closest to the door,
“I’m not forfeiting. I’m waiting until the day is over.”
“That’s incredibly sweet.”
“Getting ingredients for pancakes,” Steve said, placing the buttermilk in front of Tony. “Ready to crack these eggs and crack out these pancakes?”
“FRIDAY?” Bruce asked.
“And I was baby-sitting Miles – it’s a favour for a friend, person – thing” Peter said and Tony smiled over how he stumbled over his words, Tony was definitely going to be investigating this friend/person/thing later. “And he asked me to cut Miles hair, and I don’t know the first thing about cutting hair-”
“Oh.” Tony said, because of course that would happen.
“For months?”
Bruce shrugged. “Trying is the key word. It’s a virus that attacks the immune system and the bloods antibodies, so it’s a bit impossible to do so, since the white antibodies are what’s needed to fight the disease.”
is a worse word for idiot.” She said, “And you need to watch one of the Jurassic movies Thor.”(2)
Natasha placed her slice of toast onto her plate. “Tony,” she asked, “how long would it take you to repair a phone screen?” She asked.
“Tony, this was the first time you’ve been on a motorbike.. right?” Steve asked, leaving out the fairly obvious
“Woah Brucie, are you trying to make a vaccine for it?” Clint asked, pausing lining up the popcorn kernels in a row beside him, to stare at Bruce in awe.
Tony scoffed. “Oh c’mon Nat, you knew.”
Natasha stuck her tongue out at Clint, the day wasn’t over yet.
“I put it into the report so you wouldn’t be made a full avenger on purpose. I know how you feel about authority figures, especially Fury. Would you really have wanted Fury to have full control over you and the Iron Man armour? Being a consultant, in the long run, gave you leverage to control yourself and your tech, even if it was a pain in the ass.”
“Are you asking me to go to the markets with you?”
That’s when it happened.
“To be fair, you
Tony crouched down, plucking one off the plant. “
“One of the others probably unlocked their room,” Tony said. “So I’ll just…”
Emine cocked her head to the side, her eyes roving over Tony as though she was assessing him. “I must say Mr. Stark, I did not take you as a man who would come to the farmers markets.”
“We don’t have to Tony, it was only an idea-”
Steve caught the wrench before it clattered to the ground and passed it back to Tony with a smile, before returning to the chain – and that was
dating. “What do you do already for him? What do you love to do when you’re alone with him?”
Natasha patted his hand, which was already healing well. “It will, I promise you it will. Just think of what he would like. I can’t tell you that or it won’t be genuine, and it
Tony shrugged. “Nah, not really. You’ve been putting up with Clint as long as I have,” – Steve snorted. “We all need a bit of a break.”
Steve’s motorbike.
Tony looked up at him in shock. “Something wrong?”
“He’s not that big on extravagant gifts… he gives them but he doesn’t like to receive them.”
“Tony?” He croaked, his voice was coarse from a lack of use, he placed another hand on top of Tony’s leaning forward.
Right?
FRIDAY materialised beside her, causing Natasha to flinch. “Oh,” FRIDAY said as Tchaikovsky wavered off, because you could never
Steve paled, instantly realising what Tony had. “It’s been hours.”
Steve snorted. “Oh FRIDAY, you haven’t seen Tony without pancakes before and it shows.”
Tony woke with a soft smile, his body cocooned in so much warmth that left Tony feeling nothing but safe. The sun warmed his face, but didn’t shine in his eyes, so he let them stay closed. Tony was content, he was at ease, and utterly…
The stalls themselves were selling a variety of goods that Tony hadn’t seen outside of the dreary supermarkets that were cool with indifference. Stalls with fresh fruit sat alongside stalls piled with fresh honey. The scent of fresh baked goods and unfamiliar spices filled the air, and Tony even spotted a corner stall that sold sausages, and only sausages. The gravel crunched under his shoes, and the wind that they were headfirst in earlier was blocked by the stalls, creating a nice, warm atmosphere.
Steve nodded. “He was very charismatic.”
“I’ve never done this on the side of the road before,” Steve commented absentmindedly.
Natasha smirked. “It was Tony, he answered first.”
Walking into the gardens was like being transported into a haven. Bird calls, cicada’s, and the distant noise of running water were the soundtrack against the dark towering oak trees. Their leaves wove above their heads, shielding them from the harsh sun as they wandered through the crowd. Iridescent blues, greens, yellows, and pinks painted the sides of the large cobblestone road, which wound through various plants and onto flattened dirt pathways. A cool breeze blew through Natasha’s hair, and made a rustling noise with the leaves and branches, another instrument to the gardens band. When Natasha breathed in, she could feel the tranquillity of the plants, the easiness of the lives of the animals –  the squirrels burrowing into trees, the frogs hopping on the ground, and felt a sense of kinship with them.
Because that’s how it worked, that was how it always worked with Steve.
Tony bit his lip, crossing his arms over his front., growing awkward immediately. Natasha wanted to groan,
Tony shrugged. “Well yeah, this is squashing the issue before it becomes one.”
“And you must be Peter then?” Steve asked, and Peter ran a hand through his hair, his face flushed. It made sense to Tony, this was
“Well I really only came for the superheros.” The boy, Sam
“Obama,” Tony gestured, “you should remember him.”
Tony nodded. “There’s – there’s no harm in trying though, right?”
“Yep.” – “Oh definitely.” – “Of course.” The others chorused.  “Can we start the movie now?” Thor asked, “Please? There are
said, that makes you think he doesn’t love you back?”
Now, Tony was dying, and his colour was fading.
Tony's hand twitched.
and I'm," He sighed, rubbing his nose, "I'm just some old weapons profiteer. I have far too much blood on my hands to deserve redemption, yet alone happiness."
“How long have you been here for?”
Clint snorted, back on task. “God no, these are for Tony.”  “What about Tuesday?” Thor suggested.
, “did I make you jump?”
the one who fixates and obsesses over it. Never mind the fact that no one else see’s you that way, none of us would care.
Steve came in and slid into his seat in a poor attempt to stagger his entrance in after Tony. He scanned the table in curiosity before landing on Tony’s neck. “Oh.”
“No, no you didn’t,” Tony said with a soft smile. “Thank you.”
“They're

“Wait, son,” he said, looking at the boy on the table, and Tony almost rolled his eyes because ‘son’,
The farmers markets were unlike anything Tony had experienced before. The overcast sky did nothing to deter people from trekking out here, with throngs of people lining the pathways and gathered around stalls. Tony could see lovers wandering hand in hand, casually browsing, whilst others gossiped in huddles, clutching coffees around worn fingers.
Tony collapsed at the kitchen island beside Natasha, who looked down slightly at Tony, then back at her StarkPad. “Where were you both?”
Bruce nodded. “That’s fine, add it.”
mistakes.
And they sat there, looking at each other, and Steve knew, everything would be okay.
“It’s a bet,” Clint said. “And you better make sure I fucking win, Stark! I got like… 10 dollars riding on this.”
“This is so cool.” Sam said, elbowing Riri.
After all, there was a reason Steve was always sketching in the workshop.
“Which I agree with, but obviously I wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to cannibalise the eftpos machine.” The other girl, Riri, Tony assumed, said.

It had been three hours and Steve still hadn’t come to find her. Natasha was worried.  “FRIDAY,” she called out, folding herself over the barre, “can you turn my music off?”
Well –  almost into the ground.
Again, Tony had always loved this place.
“I’ve got to try,” Steve said. He turned to Thor. “Help me get him off the ground.”
“Dum-E, no,” Tony said flailing as he pushed himself into the wall – one of the wheels was stuck, he’d have to look into that, “you have three seconds to stop fighting the blender. I don’t need more oil and a screwdriver pretending to be an actual, edible smoothie.”
“If you would like Boss, I could look through Uber’s archives and database,” she said, bringing up a hologram list in front of Tony. “I could find places that serve pancakes, and have a partnership with Uber Eats.”
Clint shrugged. “You haven’t won the bet, Nat.”
Natasha nodded towards the next bust. “Nixon. Watergate. Google it, it was devastating news at the time. Now… not so much. He also started the War on Drugs and was president during the moon landing.”
And Steve was magnificent.
“If you’re not used to sitting for too long, your legs can get a bit wobbly, I should have warned you,” Steve said, his voice soft. He was
Tony heard a scuffle as Natasha snatched the phone back. “Thanks Tony. When will we see you?”
If an AI could huff, FRIDAY just did. “If I’m honest Boss, I wasn’t sure your cravings for pancakes were this extreme.”
Clint shrugged. “Whatever man, I don’t care who makes the first move as long as it happens today.”
Tony smiled softly, he knew FRIDAY added that fact just to soften the blow. “Good, good. Education is important.”
“Yeah, Ray Romano. And he said that the roses at the lights were a dud gift, that don’t have any value or something because your partner knows you didn’t put any effort into getting them.”
Steve lifted Tony off of his seat and pulled him in a blinding kiss. Tony was frozen for a moment, limp in Steve’s arms, before responding with the same fervour, latching himself against Steve like he was about to turn to dust. It was messy and hardly romantic, with Steve’s nose pushed awkwardly against Tony’s, their teeth clashing against each other as they tried to gain some headway, and their faces at an uncomfortable angle. Tony pulled away suddenly, shifting the angle before diving in – and yes, that was right. The world fell away as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, clinging to his back as Tony wound his fingers into Steve’s hair. Someone moaned but for the life of him Steve couldn’t tell who, nor did he really care. For all the times Steve had spent with Tony, talking with him, laughing with him, Steve hadn’t thought there was anything more to learn about Tony’s lips, but as they pressed against his, soft, and warm, and safe in a way words never could be, Steve found himself addicted.
When he had decided he wanted pancakes this morning, Tony had to admit, he didn’t see himself here, with Steve.
No, it couldn’t be hope, that would be ridiculous.
Natasha perked her head. “So the problem is…”
“Huh.” Steve said, slightly defeated. “Wait, how did you know I was looking for eggs?”
so much, for
Riri leapt out of her seat, planting a hand on Sam’s mouth. “No!” She jerked it away suddenly, a look of utter revulsion on her face. “Did you seriously just lick my hand?”
Steve walked into the dance studio during Natasha’s warm up. “Hey, Nat, can I talk to you quickly – if you’re free, that is.”
to not let people hold you back.”
“It didn’t seem like the wisest thing to do, I’ll agree.” Thor said.
“I’d- I’m sorry Tony. I just, I’ve messed everything up and I know you want me gone and-”
” Natasha said. “We’re all huddled around the front door, and, quite frankly, it’s
God, Steve had probably come here when he was his most lonely, his most outcasted, his most depressed – which Tony had certainly never helped with. The markets were wonderful, the sights, the smells, the vibrancy, one could forget the reason they came here in the first place, Tony certainly had, and he wasn’t even trying to forget.
Bruce laughed. “Which one?”
“We’ll get through it.”
Kamala scanned the items. “Would you like a bag for these?”
Tony hadn’t asked for a personal favour since, well, since the whole accords mess. Which hadn’t turned out so great, if the scarring in his chest was any indication.

As the sun crept into the horizon, Steve felt lost. One the one hand, he was grateful that Tony had this group of people who inherently cared about Tony above all else, but on the other, he didn’t know what
“Hilary Clintons husband?” Thor asked.
And that just wouldn’t do.
“I’ll take the left,” Steve said and if it had been anyone else, Tony would have groaned.
There was no colour here.
“Tony,” Steve said again. “You help millions of people every day, and only 11 people have this issue. Most people – most companies, would wait until a few thousand people have an issue but you… you’re tackling it immediately. No person is too small for you to help. It’s… it’s amazing.”
Tony frowned. The first person? “Well that couldn’t really mean anything.”
“You have to google it,” Natasha said to Thor and Steve, who had looked more confused than amused.
But they also all needed to be unlocked, which Tony had forgotten.
Kamala beamed. “Which is hard at times, but we’re all getting through it.”
Tony scoffed. “Hey now, I don’t remember this snark being part of your original coding.”
“Then you have nothing to lose. Everything stopping you, everything you have been overthinking and over analysing for three hours – is all in
“Well, it’s not like I can help it. It
On Sunday night the team got together for their weekly movie night. Steve and Tony were late.
“You-.” Tony was at a loss for words. “You’re sixteen and you’re reverse engineering my armour. That’s astonishing!”
Tony looked up in confusion. “You think?”
Tony gave a tentative smile back. What did she mean, that Tony was Steve’s favourite? In what context? Should Tony care?
Tony clapped his hands together, breaking the moment. “So, are we ready to go on this historic world changing Steve-Rogers-Is-Introducing-Tony-Stark-To-Something-New-In-The-21
Tony almost smacked his forehead with his hand. The winter cabin! He’d almost forgotten. “Is that right now?”
“That sounds like a lot of fun,” Thor said, piling another muffin onto his plate from the kitchen. He had arrived late today for family breakfast, as was the norm with him. Natasha glanced at his hands, they were clean – for once. Perhaps he was finally setting up the phone Tony had given him.
“Why?” Clint asked, stifling a laugh.
Tony breathed in, and then out. “I’m in love with Steve.”
Steve swallowed, then marched towards Tony. Before Tony could react Steve’s lips were on his in a blinding kiss. Tony was frozen for a moment, limp in Steve’s arms, and then the world around them fell away, and Tony responded with haste. Tony wound his arms around Steve neck, pulling Steve against him, as though Steve would disappear at a moment’s notice. Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony’s torso, tethering him to the Earth, keeping Tony grounded, keeping Tony safe. Tony’s mind was nothing but static white noise, with no purpose but to get as close to Steve as he could, to share everything of himself with Steve, and take everything of Steve in return. Everything Steve was willing to give Tony would take with fervour, and Steve was the same. Tony was addicted,
FRIDAY poked her head to Natasha’s side. “What has made the Captain so upset, anyway?”
Steve buried his head into the crisp sheets, sobbing into Tony's side, his hands clutching Tony’s. The pain and stress that had consumed him these past few weeks was leaching through him in waves, each wave threatening to flood Steve’s mind. He had been drowning without Tony, and now Tony was
Steve let out a sigh, and met Tony’s gaze. “I think I’m just about done, you?”
between us that I couldn’t possibly break down. I would lose him, bit by tiny, inconspicuous bit, until he would be just a face I see in my dreams, or in the hallways.
“Maybe we should just face it,” Bruce said, “I don’t think you’ve won the bet Nat.”
Tony rolled his eyes to hide his soft smile. His AI always had to go mother-hen on him.
How his eyes sparkled, up for an adventure, ready to straddle the motorbike and never let go. How he acted, the loyalty he invoked in the people around him, how Tony wanted to stand by Steve’s side always. How Steve’s very soul seemed to excite Tony, and how Tony had forgotten to wear his mask around Steve, had forgotten they existed at all.
“Meet the Avengers,” Natasha said with a wry grin, “saviours of the world –
Tony looked up to where Clint was looking and smiled. “
She was-
Tony bit his lip with a sigh. “Yeah, it was.”
of all things? That would put them incredibly close together. Tony would be putting his life into Steve’s hands, with no metal around him in case they crashed. There would be nothing to protect him but a blue cashmere blazer and a Wall-Mart shirt.
“Look, if you’re smarter than Bruce and Thor think you are, then you’ll work it out pretty soon yourself, but right now we’re watching this so…”
“Oh come on Nat, you use the same reinforced punching bags I use.”
“The Markets?” Tony asked.
Clint snorted. “Sound's obnoxious.”
Steve must have realised that Tony had been staring, because he finished spooning the pancake batter in the heated pan, put the bowl down, and turned to face Tony, concern paramount in every muscle of Steve’s face. “Tony, are you okay?”
Natasha cleared her throat obnoxiously. Steve didn’t respond.
And he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Tony wheeled over to Dum-E, who was battling the blender with such ferocity, Tony was sure that this time, the thing might actually cark it. The blender. Not Dum-E.
“No.” Natasha said. “Don’t think about your absurd insecurities. What has
it was the flower.”
Which was –
Steve bit his lip. “I suppose…”
“You didn’t tell us that made you on a first name basis with the best Avenger.” The boy said.
Kamala almost stumbled on her feet, coming up to take Steve’s hand, before thinking better of it and supporting Miles on her back. “I’m Kamala.”
Tony dried and got changed, flopping onto the bed dramatically. How had everything gotten so
“For now," she added sympathetically, and Steve tensed. "It was a difficult surgery, his wrist alone needed 20 stitches. We’re keeping him in Intensive Care but,” she smiled, the kind of smile that dragged Steve's worries out of him by force, that set him at ease. “I don’t think some optimism would be amiss here.”
Tony was greeted with an unusual sight when entered the store, tripping over the ledge slightly. A boy with wild black hair sat on the counter, holding various electronic parts. A girl with a chaotic halo of tight curls was fiddling with the bigger machine those electronic parts were separated from. She was sporadically sipping from a juice box that was almost the size of her head. Kamala was giving a small boy a piggy back whilst another boy – with his back turned, was doing some sort of intricate coding on the decades old computer.
It wasn’t a far walk to Steve’s room – their rooms were right next to each other after all, and Steve let them in with ease. Tony had almost forgotten that he’d given Steve the nicest room. This had been his room as a kid (he tried not to think too hard about that) so Tony knew that in the morning, the sun would shine through the window in
“Definitely,” Tony said.
Steve flushed slightly, which was…
They’re all I want to see in my life.”
Ana had been integral in Tony’s ability to cook, without her, he doubted he’d be able to even use a toaster effectively. Sure, cooking was basically just edible chemistry, but Ana had taught him the tricks that came with it, how to turn something good, into something incredible. She had, had no children of her own, so Tony had inherited her wisdom, and he had always been grateful for that. He ran a thumb over his cheek bone, the way she had done so often all those years ago. Tony missed her, he missed all the Jarvis’s.
Tony nodded. “Huh, okay. This went far better than I thought it would.”
“Oh, well that’s easy,” Sam said, “Riri’s building-”
There. He was presentable to the public now.
Probably not.
Steve’s face morphed into something akin to a deer caught in headlights. “I… Because I, I took advantage of you, I-I, I told you that I…”
“Oh hardy-har,” Tony said, a small grin tugging on his lips, it was almost surreal to be bantering like this, but Tony found he rather enjoyed it, it was almost like old times. “At least this old man wasn’t taught how to use tech.”
“Which is why I felt it pertinent to take her call.” Jarvis said. “Sir.”
“Yeah, yes. I am – sir.”
wake up. Even the doctor - who was obnoxious, Clint had called it, was optimistic in a way that seemed genuine. In a way though, the doctor reminded Steve of Tony, he was very-
“I missed you.” Steve said, his thumb ghosting Tony’s face.
Thor nodded resolutely. “That seems like a fair and just plan.”
“Depends,” Tony said, not looking up from Steve, who was still reading softly in his ear. “Who bet Steve would say it first but I’d make the first move.”
, how could a human be so oblivious. The other half wanted to wrap a blanket around him and kiss his forehead. She decided on a middle ground. “Put that into something tangible. The best kind of gifts, the best kind of
Then, alone in the hallway, Tony captured Steve’s lips with his own, and the world fell away. Tony’s brain lit on fire and warmth spread through his body. He clutched Steve’s wrist with one hand, and gripped his shoulder with another, grounding him as Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony, securing him, keeping him safe. Tony had thought that after all this time spent with Steve watching him laugh, frown, and talk, that he knew everything about Steve’s lips. Yet Tony was completely unprepared, but at the same time it was completely expected Tony was dizzy from his head to his toes, magic surrounding him. A kiss like this was a beginning, a promise of something incredible.
“Oh relax,” Natasha said. “Let’s finally have a family Christmas already.”
“They’re on the roof, actually.”
Steve shook his head. “There’s nothing to talk about.”
Tony nodded before scurrying to the bathroom. He needed time to think.

He always let Tony build a Snowman to guard the house before they even stepped foot inside.
“But you forget one thing!” Thor said.
winter cabin we’re all crashing in.”
“Steve,” Natasha said. “That would have the same problem as Thor flying him.”
Tony didn’t bother drying himself, there wasn’t any point when he’d just have to dry himself again before putting on clothes. Instead, he wrapped the towel around his waist and stepped out.
“They’re a rather amusing toy for children.” Thor said, not mentioning the ravens at all.
“You didn’t!” Steve exclaimed, a grin firmly rooted on his face.
Tony almost scoffed as U chirped happily, whizzing over to his brother. Let them gang up on him, he didn’t care. It’s not like Tony had better things to do anyway.
Steve winced slightly, but it was barely perceptible unless you could recognise it, which Tony could.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “I seem to recall that you dress in the exact same way when disguised, or did you and Nat not traverse through a shopping centre in 2014?”
He pulled up from the tree he’d been leaning against. “Here, let me take a look.”
Because he wasn’t.
Tony shook his head, his heart sinking. God he was terrible with kids, of course she assumed he was going to steal it. “Nah, I’ll leave my wallet here, it’s not like I can leave without it.”
“Can we back up and talk about the fact that you
Normally, when a team member was hurt, they’d have gotten news by now, but whenever a nurse passed them, they gave them nothing but furtive glances, filled with pity.
Dammit.
“How did you think of that?” Bruce asked, awe lacing his voice.
Thor looked up at her, his expression falling. “How did you know?”
“Th– they’re rather good,” Tony said softly, “you got me right in my element.”
Tony slid the bowl to Steve. “Alright solider, put that serum to use and whisk that up.”
Natasha hummed. “Good idea, we’re
So, last month had been devastating. The city was still recovering from Villainous Eve’s damage, but the gardens were repaired, a large part due to Tony’s donations and personal scouting for replacement plants.
Well, that wasn’t really likely, she was just making an
Tony sat dumbfounded, watching Steve work. He had long taken his jacket off and had rolled up his sleeves, exposing his taut, strong arms. He crouched beside the wheel, his jeans tight around his calves, leaving very little to the imagination. Tony couldn’t look away.
Steve was the first to pull away, resting his forehead on Tony and taking heavy, ragged breaths.  Tony could feel Steve’s heartbeat, a crazy erratic thrumming that matched Tony’s own. Steve, with his bruised lips and flushed face, stared at Tony like he was the only thing in the universe that he would ever care about existing. “I love you too, Tony, always.”
Peters eyes went wide, nodding along. “Fr-from the workshop, I meant. I wanted to see why Spiderman would try it.”
“Kissing,” Thor said. “We classified it as kissing.”
Tony felt…
Clint groaned, whether that was a reaction towards what FRIDAY had said, or because he was picking out un-popped kernels of popcorn, Natasha didn’t care. “So that’s two out.”
Thor was miffed, they were supposed to be watching Jurassic Park right now. “Yes, but never on
“So,” Natasha said, “the basic terms were this; we all betted on when our resident superidiots realise they’re in love with each other, and stumble into a relationship together. Do we all agree?”
Steve gave him a look that suddenly weighted the room, added weight to the words Tony had just spoken, suddenly, it didn’t seem like there were talking about movies anymore. “We will?”
“No,” Natasha said, “
On the table in front of them, a blue hologram emerged, showing a table listing each of their names, their price, and their terms.
“Those times were in the tower were some of my best memories.”
“Ms. Romanov?” Tony spluttered. “Why are you letting Natasha of all people call me? You know she only does so to yell at me.”
“Oh,” Tony paused, letting the pan dangle in the air between us. Making pancakes. With Steve.
Tony was frail, the hand Steve held was paper thin. He lay in the hospital bed, the thinning sheets scratching at his skin. Disinfectant hung permanently in the air, making the room stuffy with undertones of bleach and sickness. The limp curtains hung by the window, they looked like they had been washed hundreds of times, and so had lost all the life they once had, and blank white walls seemed to consume Tony, making him look small and lifeless.
Natasha shrugged. “Alright, it’s your loss.”
“He just did it because he wanted to make me happy.” Tony said. “I wasn’t even in a bad mood or having a bad day, he just wanted to make it better just because he could!”
“Oh,” the girl said. “Kamala called me in because the eftpos machine was broken, and Sam has been acting as my apprentice this weekend so I dragged him along.”
Steve was leaning against a bench, his eyes glued to his phone. Huh, that wasn’t a sight Tony had ever expected. “Who knew old men could get a handle on decent technology,” Tony quipped as he walked in, swallowing his nerves.
, and you – you decided that I was a good enough subject to use that on.”
Clint hadn’t made a comment when Tony had taken Steve’s hand again. He had been quieter since they’d seen Tony’s private garden earlier. Tony said it would be opening for the public tomorrow, but he had wanted them to see it first alone. It was beyond sweet, and Natasha could understand why her best friend was quiet. A lot of emotions were running through her core too. Tony seemed to have sensed this, because he had taken them to a smaller cobble stone path. Tall trees were littered along the pathway on both sides, sheltering a myriad of statue busts that sat along the pathway.
– he’d never thought he would get to have this."Right now, all I want is you."
Making Pancakes With Steve.
Thor landed beside them. “I could fly him to the nearest hospital.”
“Tony!” Steve said. “You’re okay.”
. It was something Tony never wanted to cease to see.
Tony grinned as he arrived to the counter. “Noted.”
“And stop saying you’re not good enough for people, I’ve never heard anything more ridiculous in my life.”
“I really want to make pancakes but we’re out of pretty much everything we need to make them, but I don’t have cash and FRIDAY said you carried some on you…”
“And then she introduced us to him.” Sam said. “Ned’s awesome man.”
, whatever he’ll give me I’ll take, and, if for a moment, it feels like something more… I can live with that, it can help me live with this.”
A collective wave of relief rose through them, Steve immediately brightened. Good, Tony would be alright.
“Please never go Skynet,” Clint said, “I… don’t think any of us would survive that.”
And Steve waited.
“And who are you to judge my clothing choices, Mr. I-Only-Own-The-Same-Three-T-Shirts-And-They’re-All-Two-Sizes-Too-Small?”
Tony placed his wallet on the table. “Okay, I’ll put these back so it doesn’t hassle you, then I’ll go to an ATM.”
so quickly? They had been fine just before, just well and dandy and now…
“But then it’s nothing but winding country roads,” Steve said, handing Tony a helmet. “And there’s no thrill like that.”
Steve grinned. “There’s baklava after too.”
“He’s my best friend, Nat!” Steve breathed out. Natasha nodded, taking the pressure wrap from the kit, willing him to continue as she worked. “I mean, obviously I knew I loved him, but I always thought it was like how I love you, or the rest of the team, you know?”
to know what that’s about?”
They went down to the fire place, where Steve had already set everything up. “Huh, all you needed to do was light it. I could’ve waited outside whilst you finished up.”
Your mind is probably one of the most brilliant things in this world, but all you’re doing is making up absurd situations and scenario’s and it’s driving you mad. If you keep making assumptions about Steve and
“I don’t know why.” Tony said, “Because I know
“Sorry, I didn’t mean, not like that, it’s-”
Tony heard a squeak, and actual, legitimate
They arrived at his statue. It was decent, but hardly anything remarkable. But – Natasha supposed, she felt that way about all the bronze statues. She didn’t really see anything to admire about in any of the presidents.
Bruce gave Natasha a puzzled look, poking his head towards Steve and Tony. Natasha shrugged and turned back to the TV. She didn’t know what was going on, she only knew what she hoped was developing.
Steve had caught him.
Tony was no longer concerned about the shower, and it seemed their new predicament seemed to dawn on them at the same time.
“Yeah,” Tony deadpanned. “Nat dressing you does not support your argument.”
Clint groaned. “Can I get my wallet after we eat, I’m starving."
“We all knew.” Clint corrected.
Natasha breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank God. It’s for Tony then?”
They snuggled into the small one seater sofa’s around the fire, waiting for the others to return. Tony was on his Starkpad, pulling up the finishing touches of the code for the Starkphone update, whilst Steve read.
They had been taken to a private waiting room. Natasha sat curled on one of the sofa’s, leaning into Clint who looked straight ahead at seemingly nothing. Bruce was wrapped in Natasha’s green blanket on the sofa next to Steve, his post-hulk-out tea cold by his side as he stared at the small television in the corner, his eyes glassed over. Thor was out scouting, looking for something to punch – a threat, he’d said. They all knew there wasn’t anything out there, but none of them could blame him. Steve would have joined Thor, if he could bear being farther away from Tony.
He weaved them through the crowd, pausing to point out various flowers that he loved. “
Steve detached himself from the situation, he needed to think. The rescue services were too far away, Bruce was too far away, and Tony was in too perilous a state to move somewhere too rapidly.
Tony was, well shocked was an understatement. “How old are you?”
This wasn’t something Tony was supposed to do, something he was ever supposed to consider. Tony had asked once, if he could look inside and Steve had told him clearly that he wasn’t comfortable, that Tony wasn’t welcome to pry.
“And it just hit me!” he said, “I realised that – well, and I
A man who had eyes that reminded Tony of the sun, who made Tony believe he had seen and travelled to every important place in the universe, for he could see it all in his eyes.
“I’m not sharing my popcorn.” Clint said, throwing another piece into his mouth.
Thor nodded. “You suggested that I should, so I did.”
"Tasha, no, you don't get it. Steve and I - we're incompatible. He's - well, he's
“Good.” Tony said.
“Oh I really don’t need to know shit like that.” Clint said.
“I wasn’t talking about the punching bag, I was talking about the rough-housing with a certain Nordic warrior with a hammer – but that applies too.”
Steve laughed, then brought his voice down to a whisper. “I didn’t even know I could,” he said softly. “But I’m so glad it happened.”
“You did say to call ‘them’, sir,” Jarvis said, and Tony rolled his eyes. Trust his AI to be a smartass. Clint’s signature snigger was all the confirmation Tony needed.
“$10 then,” Bruce said.
“Oh no,” Steve scrambled, “this isn’t for you – I’m sorry.”
Tony rolled eyes. “You know what I mean.”
Tony bounded into the kitchen with the fervour of a toddler. Tony
–  this
“Please Steve, that shirt is so small that I’m sure it could have originally been mine.”
“And I’m Riri.” The girl said with a grin.
“We can still do another movie night on Thursday too.” Bruce said.
After a while, Steve spoke up. “What’re you working on that you couldn’t take a break for anyway?”
Steve spluttered. “No, you don’t need a protector, that’s not what I meant, I just-”
There were hedges that lined the garden. Cut into them were different Nordic runes that Natasha could recognise, but couldn’t translate or explain. Thor gravitated to them, and ran his hands along the golden metal that held it all in place.  The entire garden held a sense of grandeur of scale with antique simplicity. Triangle and curved lined patterns were carved onto almost every surface, but often petered out into the blank slate of the stone. Gold was woven into various surfaces, it was beautiful in its subtlety. Tony’s garden was the perfect meshing of Asgardian design, American Art Deco, and Russian Neoclassicalism.
That was fine too, it’s not like he’d never seen Rhodey without a shirt on in a non-battle situation. This was completely normal.
“Because someone,” he said out loud so she would be sure to hear. “Neglected to mention that we didn’t have buttermilk, a key ingredient in the pancake making process.”
close. Tony could smell the mint from his breath, could feel Steve’s words on his skin.
on Netflix in the common room.”
“JFK,” Tony said, pointing towards President Kennedy, “apparently he and dad were friends. Decent progressive guy, bit corrupt, cheated on his wife, and was shot by the CIA.”
It was sweet and endearing and everything Tony loved about Steve.
“And he’d be so kind about it, I would confess and he would let me down gently, promise we would be friends. But then it would be there, weighing on the both of us, and it wouldn’t be the same.
“Oh yeah, you don’t get any opinions mister,” Tony said, storming back to the main room. “And we’re calling them right now.”
Natasha shrugged. For her it was obvious that they should be dating, because they already acted like they
“I love you.” Tony said, more sure of himself. There was no point backing away.
Which was, wow. Tony had often heard the term ‘breathless’ get thrown around, and he could apply it to some stages in his life. When Yinsen did the surgery on him, when Stane ripped the arc reactor from his chest, and when he finally replaced the Palladium, just to name a few – never, however, had he used the phrase to describe his own emotions. But there was no phrase that could better describe Tony in that moment. It was like something had crashed into Tony’s gut, physically knocking the wind out of him. For a moment, he had forgotten to breathe, startled out of it by Steve’s words.
Tony whooped, excitement tingling down his arms and adrenaline pumping through his heart. He could hear Steve laugh in front of him as they cut through the country side, screaming down the road. Tony breathed in deeply, letting the winds bite his face and pierce his skin. Steve smelt of vanilla, motor oil, and the country air around them. He could feel Steve’s heart hammering in his chest, and was sure his own heart was the same.
And then he realised what he had said.
Tony swallowed, absorbing the praise. “It’s, it’s not really as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be. Because – well, for every one person who actually makes a complaint, another hundred people are experiencing it as well. So that’s at least 1200 people who can’t open their damn browser. It’s getting to the issue now, before it become an epidemic.”
Something Tony wasn’t going to be paying attention to, no siree, not at all.
He swallowed, what he was thinking was dangerous. He couldn’t think of Steve like that, he couldn’t let himself believe Steve thought of
“Totally, this is exactly the kind of thing every one should wear to the markets, Wall-Mart t-shirts are great. I’m starting a trend.”
They carefully balanced over some mismatched rocks that were clumped together between the waterfall and another stone wall face with dangling vines.
Steve looked rightfully puzzled, Tony had never actually
“Besides,” Steve said, a small grin on his face at Tony’s reaction. “We can just put this in my room until the others get back with the key – i-if you’re okay with that, that is.”
It was unlike anything Tony had ever experienced before. He had never felt more alert, more alive. He was so acutely attuned to the environment around him, it was as though FRIDAY had entered his consciousness. The sights, the sounds, the smells,
Natasha rolled her eyes, packing her things into her bag. She wasn’t even surprised. “Sparring or using the punching bag?”
“He would, but he’d be mopey as shit.” Clint said.
“Oh you were right Steve,” Tony said. “Emine’s eggs are perfect.”
like that. It was too risky, their past to wrecked by pain. Steve was putting the eggs in a bag that just seemed to appear out of nowhere, oblivious to the interaction.
Steve gave Tony an odd look that Tony couldn’t quite decipher. “Yeah,” he said softly, “I normally do.”
Tony shrugged. “Dad went away a lot, when he was gone she was more comfortable around me. Sometimes she would give JARVIS the day off, and we would hole up in the kitchen together. We always ended up making Bruschetta – every time."
Steve stood frozen at the edge of the stairs, one hand on the railing. At least he wasn’t moving.
They were at the table for their Family Valentine’s Dinner. Clint said the only reason he had shown up was so he could subtly mock Natasha when she lost the bet. She rolled her eyes and purposely hadn’t pointed out how he had stacked a collection of physical DVD’s from home for them to watch after – all with Taylor Swift in them, obviously, even though FRIDAY had them all on file already.
Steve stopped abruptly, he might as well have just confessed his feeling out loud with the way he was going. The air grew sweltering hot as Steve stood there, it
The five of them – minus Tony, were sitting together, sharing another family breakfast. Natasha had made cream of wheat, using semolina instead of oats, just like she had, had as a child. She had made it just like her grandmother had – at least, how she
“Exactly Tony,” Steve said, “that pumpkin is going to rot, and then you’ll have wasted a perfectly fruit on a man who has less use
“We’ve called it
He “-gave the money to Margaret for the fundraiser,” FRIDAY said, “It was more than enough to pay for their trip to France.”
“Oh, then you can paint it the Russian colours!” Bruce added.
Then Tony felt a shift and before he knew it, Steve woke up. Tony though, ever the coward, kept his eyes closed, breathing deeply and pretending to be asleep. He felt Steve freeze, his body stiffening as he seemed to become aware of the potion they were sleeping in.
“Although,” Tony said, walking up to Steve. “We’re driving out from Manhattan, that’s a lot of congestion.”
century had gotten onto flying cars, they could beat through all the traffic.
Kamala frowned further. “You could just… walk out of the store though…”
Tony chuckled. “Seems like it.”
“I’m not worried about losing him suddenly or dramatically, I’m not worried about confessing my feelings and him turning away in revulsion, he’s better than that, it’s part of the reason why I love him. I’m worried – no, I’m
“Not because they’re me,” Tony continued, and for a moment Steve wondered if he had spoken aloud, “and fuck that’s another thing all together, it’s just – you managed to capture so much emotion, so much depth and I’m so… flattered isn’t the right word, awed – that’s better. I’m awed by it because you have so much talent, so much
She rolled her eyes in good humour. “Now boy, I’ve been on this Earth for 94 years, I don’t have time for pleasantries anymore. What’s Steve brought you out here for?”
“You want to drive home without a clutch?” Tony asked, incredulous.
“Huh,” Kamala said, before smiling. “Well, thanks then! You could just leave it to the side, it’d be faster for you when you get back.”
It was terrifying.
“When do we put the tomatoes and spinach in?”
“So do it.” Natasha said. “That’s how all the guys got their fella’s back in the day right?” She asked coyly.
“Unfortunately Boss, there are no specific restaurants in New York that delivers pancakes at this hour on a Sunday morning. I believe ‘Mighty Cakes’ may be the only place to do so.”
She shrugged. “It wasn’t hard to guess.”
Steve froze, had he imagined it? He had to have. There was nothing else happening, no change in any of the beeping machines, and no other movement.
“Not really, you still fell for a friend, and you still had to work through that. My point is, don’t sell Steve short,
