“Damn right, ‘Oh’! And where to you get off going and invading my privacy? Just because we’ve slept together, that doesn’t give you the right to go through my things!” John was fuming now. It was hard to believe that not that long ago he had been laying in bed, content to just be in Sherlock’s presence, content to just look at him. Now he could barely look at the man.
“Exactly! Why are you wearing clothes?” Sherlock both looked and sounded horrified. “When you got up to go into the bathroom, I thought you were just going to wash up from your wake-up call, not to get dressed!”
John turned from looking out the window to face Sherlock. “Hmm?”
“John, you can stop.” Sherlock huffed out an exasperated laugh and tried to swat John’s hand away. “I’m fine, just a few scraps. And really, my leg is great. It’s a little sore, but there’s barely even a cramp. It’ll be fine in no time.”
Sherlock nodded. “We did, but you know how I think, how I process things far quicker than everyone else. You know I do
“At the moment, I don’t care how simple or obvious it is, it’s a case! You can fill us in when we get there.”
There was a knock at the door, and John turned just in time to see Lestrade – his eyes closed – stick his head in the room. “You decent in here?” he asked.
doesn't
“Whoever you are, go away.” He yelled, wincing at the pain as it shot through his chest. It hurt to breathe, let alone yell.
*******
“Well you told me to rotate my palm towards your hand! How else am I supposed to rotate my palm if not with my wrist!?”
Sherlock felt himself blush for the umpteenth time. He didn’t think he’d ever tire of John’s praise. “Remind me again what all I said.” He knew exactly what he’d deduced.
“I’m sorry… what? Punch you?”
“Funny. You’re a funny one.” John said, giving Sherlock a shove. “I’m short, yeah, but I can still reach that swan’s neck of yours!”
“Oh, you mean the
“Well, give me the names of the guys doing this, and I’ll get them to leave you alone.”
“I am? I do?” John mumbled.
John wasn’t even going to ask her how she knew that, she was Sherlock’s mum after all, that family had ways of knowing things he would never understand.
As a treat, here's a mini-teaser for next time: John's daily visits continue, and he may or may not meet a mysterious someone (because you all TOTALLY can't figure out who that could possibly be)
“Then it’s a date.” John beamed. “Now don’t keep those mold cultures waiting! I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Everybody has a gift of sorts, an innate ability that manifests sometime in childhood or adolescence. There are psychics, getting glimpses of the future or reading peoples thoughts, John is always careful around the latter. Some people have heightened senses, John never met someone with eyesight and hearing like his mother. Then there were the kids who discovered they were telekinetic, pretending to be Jedi or wizards, not that John was ever jealous. And then there is John, John has the gift of healing. But it wasn’t the exciting kind of healing, the Wolverine kind of healing. No, John simply knows just how treat illness and injury, he can diagnose almost by just looking at a person, and can utilize almost anything to treat the sick or injured. Being such a healer is certainly valued, but there are others like him, especially here in medical school. So no, John Watson has never felt particularly special, but that’s always been okay with him, he’s never felt the need to stand out.
The snog lasted only a minute or so, because Sherlock quickly tore his lips from John’s, and started kissing down John’s neck and chest, evidently giving John’s front the same treatment he gave his back.
“It is John’s handwriting, but he didn’t write this.” Sherlock said to his father, then looked up at PC Butler. “This is a forgery.”
Sherlock snorted, as if John could stop him from doing anything he wanted to do. “If I wanted to dismantle a criminal enterprise, I wouldn’t need to sneak off, I’d just do it.” He smirked. “But this is excellent. With you along, this lessens the chances of Mycroft trying to ‘check in on my well-being.’”
“Now like I said, I’m the big sister, but for any of you who know us, or know our relationship, you would think John’s the older one. And I don’t just mean because of my flawless skin.” Harry joked. “No, it’s because John has always looked out for me, defended me, and yes, even protected me. We may not have always seen eye to eye, John and me, I’ve probably taken him for granted, and not been as grateful for him as I should, but that never stopped John from caring. No matter how crappy a sister I was, no matter how many times I messed up, John never gave up on me, never lost hope. Because of that, because of John, I didn’t give up on myself.”
*******
“I’ve imagined it a lot, too, you know.” John said, slowly carding his fingers through the head of dark, silky waves resting on his chest.
As they were wont to do, they eventually slipped into silence, neither knowing quite what to say, but neither really feeling the need to fill the empty space with idle conversation. It was their quiet, companionable silence, at least it was until Sherlock’s stomach decided to growl.
“If I were to hazard a guess,” and Sherlock never guessed, “I’d say our driver has orders to take me home. I can have him drop you off at your place, if you like.” He offered, and oh how he hoped she’d take him up on it.
“I have a phone. If you wanted to talk, you could have simply phoned me, on my phone. Clearly you could have found the number.”
John smiled, huffing out a small laugh. “Of course you did.”
“Yes, I guess it is rather nice.” Sherlock shrugged. “What are your plans for the holiday?”
John didn’t hurry; he took his time undoing Sherlock’s flies, and slowly inching Sherlock’s tight jeans down his long legs, kissing every new bit of exposed skin. God! Sherlock was on fire. Finally, after what felt like ages, John had freed him of all his clothes, leaving Sherlock harder than he’d ever been in his life, and sat back on his heels to admire his work.
“Why are you doing this?” John asks, feeling tears form in his eyes. “I know you love me, you know I love you, that I’m in love with you. I know we’ve never talked about it, but we’ve both said it, we’ve both heard it.” John finally looking at Sherlock again. “Stop pushing me away, it’s not going to change that I’m joining the Army. But it’s not forever, I’ll have leave, and eventually I won’t re-enlist, and we can be together for good.” His arms moving to hold Sherlock.
“Ok.” John said with a kiss, running one hand through Sherlock’s hair, the other along his back. “Alright.”
A wave of horror washed over Sherlock. “I – I did? What, uh, what else did I say?” He asked, imagining himself spilling all his inner most thoughts to or about John. Not good, really not good.
He wasn’t lying. Well, in that case…
“I won’t want to take it back.” John whispered. Sherlock could feel him rubbing his nose along his cheek.
“At least once… I need you close tonight… at least this once.” John was babbling, kissing Sherlock the entire time.
“Well you’re not leaving this room, and I’m not leaving you, so it’s the best we can do.” Mrs. Holmes added, giving Sherlock a stern look.
“It’s the cross I bear.” Sherlock smiled. “It’s fine, you don’t have to tell me. I was just… curious.”
“Well we did give him a plus one, and I’m pretty sure he’d cease to function without his most loyal minion on hand.” Sherlock shrugged. “Though I’m starting to suspect she’s just as much the British Government as he is.”
“I don’t know what you –” Sherlock started, but Mrs. Hudson cut him off.
“Yeah, no, there was no window.” John shook his head with a groan. “Some guys from his residence hall have it out for him, they did this to him.”
Fluff! Pure, unapologetic, two idiots in love, afterglow and morning after fluff!! I even added about 600 more words of fluff (and a dash of smut) while editing today!
“Quite good? I’m honored.”John yawned, settling back into the bed, feeling the all too familiar siren call of sleep. At thirty-five, multiple orgasms took a lot out of a man.
Well, if I've brought dishonor on myself, on my family, or on my cow, let me know with some comments and/or corrections!
It was worth it. Going to see Mycroft, the three hour drive, sitting amongst his ‘peers’ who were high on school spirit; it was all worth it just to see John play. Sherlock had seen him play many times before, but this game was different. Maybe because it was the ‘championship’, but it was like John could do no wrong. Every move John made was the exact right one – Sherlock may have read up on the intricacies of football with a special focus on the defensive midfield position – and his skills seemed to infect the rest of the players, everyone was playing  better. The game was, quite simply, perfect.  And when they won, and John looked to the bleachers – to Sherlock – with a grin that could rival the sun, it took every ounce of control for Sherlock to stop himself from rushing the pitch along with the rest of the fans. It was so worth it.
Dr. Wallers,
Taking a few moments to recover, John hails a cab. Unable to get rid of the huge grin plastered across his face even if he wanted to, John replays the date, and the best kiss he’s had in over ten years. The best kiss since…Well, he’s not going to think about
“Of course… So… you love me, huh?” John smirked. “You’re not just ‘exceedingly fond’?”
“Are you John Watson?” John looked up to see a man in a lab coat and scrubs – Sherlock’s doctor most likely – standing before him.
– Oh Sherlock – Oh
“Your brother-in-law thought it was necessary, and Dr. Cook agreed.”
The footage from around West Barlow Road had already been reviewed; His father assured Sherlock he sat next to the tech and watched the footage himself. According to Mr. Holmes, John was seen getting home a little after 11 pm, and no one was seen coming or leaving until Mr. Watson left for work the next morning at 7:30 am. All foot and vehicle traffic in the immediate area, were cleared as well. No suspicious stops or delays. But of course the captors weren’t seen, who did they think they were dealing with? John could never have been taken by amateurs.
“The photo on her desk shows the victim, her husband and another woman sitting in a living room. The other women clearly resembles the husband, so his sister.” Says Sherlock, positively beaming. “You can see from the background, the flat was most likely decorated by a woman, but clearly not by our victim, if the décor of this office is any indication. There are some masculine elements to the flat, so it’s shared by the brother and sister. There, also, if you look carefully at the sister-in-law, she has an ID tag clipped to her jeans with the logo of Biolab Medical, meaning she as access to cyanide. The victim has rental ads bookmarked on her desktop, but the flats are more fitting of a single individual as opposed to a couple. Clearly they’re for the sister-in-law. And finally,” now Sherlock is practically vibrating with excitement, John’s actually worried he may injure himself. “There is a shopping list in the victims bag, on which are several lactose free items, including almond milk, but looking in her desk drawer there are dairy based creamers. The sister-in-law is most likely lactose intolerant, and our victim wouldn't question her giving her coffee with almond milk instead of actual milk.”
“Don’t be. It was extraordinary. Invasive, yeah, but extraordinary. What was it that gave it all away?”
“So you’re telling me that was actually him?!” John gasp, leaning so far out of his chair Sherlock thought he was in very real danger of falling off. “Shit, if I had known that, I’d have tackled him when he ran past me!”
They kissed, and kissed, and kissed. They kissed until John’s lungs burned for oxygen, and his lips began to tingle. And even then, their parting was reluctant, their mouths still close enough that John could feel Sherlock’s breath ghosting over his lips as they both gasped for air.
“Did you take it?”
“You could…” John cleared his throat, struggling to find his voice again. “You could definitely say that.”
“Oh, you…you go first.”
“They tell me to shut up, and then sometimes, usually, they push me.”
“Where is it?” He demanded, glowering down at John. He had been unwavering in his attempts to get Sherlock to talk to him, even when Sherlock deduced him, he didn’t stop. But if John Watson thought this pathetic move was going to work, he had another thing coming.
“Step-daughter?” Mrs. Rachlin looked confused. “I don’t have a step-daughter.”
John nearly toppled over as he instinctively tried to follow Sherlock. Dear lord, he had survived a war zone, He was not going to let some gorgeous posh thing get the better of him in a night club in London.
“Now that I think about it, I think I may have heard this song before.”
John leaned forward run his nose along Sherlock’s cheekbone. “And you want to find out, do you?” he hummed, his breath warm against Sherlock’s skin. It felt amazing.
“Alright, I’ll give you that, but what about the rest of the stuff? My family stuff.”
“You’re damn right!” Sherlock barked. “I’m never stepping foot in another rehabilitation center. Not as long as I have any say in the matter!”
No, no of course John wasn’t asking him on a date. It was just dinner. They’d gone out to eat plenty of times, this was no different. And friends often marked special occasions together. No, this wasn’t a date, it was just two friends going out, sharing a meal, and enjoying each other’s company. Besides, if John was looking for a date, he certainly wouldn’t look to Sherlock. He’d seen the way people looked at John. John had no trouble attracting possible dates, possible partners. He need only say the word, and he’d have his pick of any number of attractive men and women. He wouldn’t be interested in abrasive former addicts who wouldn’t know a romantic gesture to save their life. No, definitely not a date.
“Not all doctors. You’re a good man, Dr. Watson. A good man.” Lestrade hummed.
“As you can see, the note is highly suggestive that he left on his own. The handwriting matches John’s, does it not?” Butler said as he watched father and son. He wasn’t wrong, the handwriting did look very much like John’s, but it was still wrong.
“Hungry are you?” John chuckled.
“… Alright.” John was a bit taken aback. He wasn’t expecting much, but some civility would have been nice. “Someone’s different in the light of day.” He mumbled
! Sherlock I expect to act with the emotional capacity of a two year old, but
"Oh my, Mr. Watson they're lovely, thank you."
"Are you clean? Not sick, or have any communicable diseases, or gotten a tattoo in the past year?"
Of all the times for Anderson to decide to be observant... John had been struck too speechless by Anderson's sudden hostile confrontation to get a word in edgewise, and really, what could he say? Especially since the man was right. He had never been one for lying or deceptions, in fact the men in his unit had often called him 'Honest John', both as a nickname and as a military joke on how dangerous he could be even though he didn't look the type.
“That we weren't armed?” John murmured, thinking the same thing and realizing just how badly that could have turned out.
Anthony Jones was obviously a body builder and very physical athlete, most likely rugby, possibly wrestling, too bulked for football, and he'd need more data before he could determine if he was just a vain showman who was compensating or if he actually had a spine to go along with those muscles. The lack of a fake or excessive tan or any signs of enhancers was promising. And even if he wasn't in the same league as the others he would have made a competent beta or gamma enforcer in this particular situation.
pumpkin pie cheesecake. A seasonal favorite! Thick freshly made pumpkin pie cheesecake on a cinnamon graham cracker crust with gingerbread crumbles on top.
“That was thorough.” Sherlock mumbled, looking as though the wind had been knocked out of his sails. “Hold on. You’ve figured out my whole class situation, but what do you suggest I do all day? My brain will rot!”
Oh excellent! There were still a few hours until the physical therapist was due, that was more than enough time for the two of them to get into Scotland Yard’s system and see what was going on with the Lambeth Bomber case. After he destroyed the bugs Mycroft no doubt planted. Maybe they could look up some new cases too.
right. He’s right for me, and I’m ready for this.” It was true, it
“Oh your test, of course! If you just take a few minutes to actually talk to me, tell me what’s going on with you, I’ll be happy to hand it over.”
“And me being bi-sexual? Which, by the way, you’re lucky I’m already out, or you’d have a serious problem on your hands.” John adds.
Isn't Mrs. H the best?
“What’s wrong?” John breaths, the panic starting to return
“I’ve already cancelled all my classes for tomorrow. First thing in the morning, we’ll go down to the Yard and we’ll speak with her.”
“Oh…” Sherlock cleared his throat, looking to Paul. “Well in that case, I guess I am he.”
“Dinner sounds fantastic. The case was just a suggestion, just to let you know that I’m up for anything, as long as we go out and do it together.”
Well, he was just going to have to ensure that his newly discovered feelings weren’t going to be an issue. He was going to force himself to get some sleep, and in the morning, he’d play off the kiss as nothing, that it had no effect on him what so ever. He could do this, he’d developed feelings for people who were off limits before, and his feelings for Sherlock, like those, would pass with time. He could do this.
“You seem to be forgetting how remarkably dim-witted and gullible the average human being is, John.” Sherlock sighed. “And it would be generous to even call Wilson average.”
Grinning, John leaned forward, cutting off Sherlock’s sentence with a kiss. It was soft, slow, and so very innocent compared to the kisses they shared the night before, but dear God was it exponentially better. The feel of Sherlock’s lips under his, Sherlock’s hand moving to cover his, while his other arm snaked around his back, pulling John even closer; they should have been doing this all day.
“If only I could.” Sherlock sneered, wishing he could wipe that cloying look off Mycroft’s face.
Well, have a good weekend and I'll see you again on Sunday. Oh, and if you're trying to think of something to do to pass the time, you could, I don't know, maybe leave me some of those lovely comments and/or corrections. Totally your call, I don't care, whatever *cool guy finger guns*
“It’s nothing, just my brother letting me know he started proceedings.”
“But what?”
“Simple,” Sherlock said as he peered through the small window in the door, “we wait until the hallway is empty, and then calmly make our way towards the lifts, and proceed to the lobby.”
“What can I say, I just want you to be as blissfully happy as I am.”
“Nothing.”
John had never been more grateful for Mike’s friendship than he was in that moment, he could have kissed him. He knew he talked about Sherlock ad nauseum, and more embarrassingly, he knew he was not always as quiet as he may have wished at night. While John never actually confided in Mike his feelings for Sherlock, Mike wasn’t an idiot, he could put two and two together.
It took several long, wonderful minutes for John to come down, and for his senses to return. If he hadn’t know better he would have thought he were dreaming, but he knew his mind could never come up with something as astonishing as what had just happened. It was like nothing he’d ever experienced, and not just because it was his first time engaging in ‘full sex’ with another man. John had always cared about his previous partners – a grand total of three to be exact – but this was the first time he shared a deeper connection with a partner, a meaningful connection. This was the first time he didn’t just like his partner, he wasn’t just attracted to him; with Sherlock he was with a partner who meant the world to him, with Sherlock he was with a partner who he was… And then the things Sherlock had said, the things they’d both said. It was a dream. It was better than a dream.
“Don’t… Please don’t leave me for Mycroft.”
“A towel should take care of the mats. They’re going to be cleaned tomorrow anyway, so that shouldn’t be a problem.”
“Excellent. I’d like to speak with Mrs. Rachlin now.” John knew that look, he knew that tone. Sherlock was on to something.
What Sherlock needed was a case. He didn’t care how simple, how obvious, how boring, Sherlock needed anything to get his focus pointed elsewhere. Lestrade replied promptly to Sherlock’s series of texts, telling him that he had absolutely nothing for him. The storm had kept any interesting criminals inside, and everything currently on Lestrade’s plate was open and shut, an overworked detective inspector’s dream caseload. He did promise to let Sherlock know the second something came up, but all the promises in the world weren’t going to help Sherlock’s current predicament.
“Oh him, he doesn’t matter.” Sherlock said, waving his hand. He was a bit surprised he’d waited that long to show up. “Did he offer you money to spy on me?”
“I didn’t know, I noticed.” John continued to stare questioningly, so Sherlock continued. “It’s your shoes.”
John wasn’t sure he’d seen Sherlock laugh so hard, his whole body shook and the deep rumbles of his laughter filled their room. It was infectious and soon John was laughing too, laughing so hard he felt a stitch form in his side.
“Thirteen or not… So what was it that convinced you it was murder?” John asked, an excited fire in his eyes that seemed to ignite a foreign – though not wholly unwelcome – pressure in Sherlock’s chest. Alright, where has John Watson been in general?
“Hyphenate? You mean our –”
“Yes we do, but you were caught breaking and entering. I think it’s necessary.” The tired officer sighed.
“That.” Lestrade said, waving his hand towards the two of them. “Someone ordering Sherlock around, and him actually listening.”
And suddenly Sherlock’s heart was beating again, and he could breathe, he hadn’t even realized either had stopped. But then again, John had the tendency of bringing Sherlock back to life, he’d been doing it consistently for the past six years.
Just entering his flat after a full day of classes, about a week after Molly’s party, John feels his phone buzz. Fishing is out of his pocket, he finds a text message with just an address about two miles away and,
“Oh right, a friend. Because my mates and I look at each other and act the way you two do all the time.”
“I don’t know.” John shrugged. “But I have to figure out something.”
“That I have the better partner.” Sherlock moaned, nipping at John’s jaw; he just looked so damn good. “After that, after what you just did to me, you can hardly argue that I didn’t get the better end of the deal.”
“You said I don’t need to ask permission anymore.” He whispered, his lips millimeters from John’s.
And so we've reached the end. They of course lived happily ever after, solving crime, being ridiculous, and most importantly, being in love!
“I’m fine for now, but maybe later. At the moment, I think I’d like to change. I’d rather not be wearing a suit right now.” Sherlock said, using his crutches to lift himself up.
“Well we were stuck together in the flat; we couldn’t very well stay silent.” Sherlock knew that was a lie, he could remain silent for days if he so wished.  By the look on Mrs. Hudson’s face, she knew he was lying as well.
“Well damn.”
Sherlock kicked the gun through the door as a precaution. “We did it!” he beamed, lifting his head to finally look at John, and the world came to a screeching halt. John stood a few paces away, face slack in shock; clutching his left shoulder, a wet, red stain soaking through his ratty t-shirt. “Sherlock.” He whimpered, and crumpled to the ground.
John nearly cried as Sherlock ground against him. “Want you –
“Oh by all means, please don’t let us keep you.” John laughed, waving his hand to shoo Theo away. “I’m sure you should be scampering back to work anyway. With the drugs habit to maintain, and if that shoddy suit is the best you have, you clearly can’t afford to be getting on Daddy’s bad side. He might cut you off, and we can’t have that!”
“My phone? Why?” What did his phone have to do with whether or not John still wanted to see him? Still, Sherlock punched in his pass code – 5646 – and handed over the phone.
“Really? Because it sounded pretty offensive to me.”
“Yeah? And you loved every second of it,” Sherlock grinned, “the blood pumping through your veins, the adrenaline, the potential of just the two of us against the rest of the world!”
Sherlock is spot on with his predictions, and is progressing beautifully through his recovery, but could something else be progressing as well?
“I’m sorry, John can do what?!” John interjected, stepping forward to join the conversation. Sherlock had insisted he stay when Mycroft showed up, but up until that point, he’d stayed quiet and let the brothers talk.
That was probably for the best, John thought, he couldn’t have Sherlock getting the wrong idea and complicating things.
“You know, I’m actually dreading having to put my clothes back on.” He laughed, stepping back into Sherlock’s room. “I’ve been wearing them since Friday, and now I’m all clean… What is it? What’s wrong?” He finally caught sight of Sherlock sitting on the bed, staring stony-eyed back at him.
“And is this everything, brother mine?” Mycroft asked, thumbing through Dr. Drier’s report for the twelfth time.
Bill was a good man and saved his life, so John bit his tongue to keep from insulting the man and his idea of fun.
At that, the man started to laugh, and funnily enough, Sherlock found himself joining in.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. Yes that!”
Sherlock could not stop pacing, he shouldn’t be so nervous, he had no reason to be so nervous, he had no reason to be nervous at all. The most important question had already been asked and answered – their left hands both bore the thin metal tokens to prove it – and by comparison, this was nothing. He went over his argument once more in his head. It was logical, it made sense, John would surely see that and agree. Sherlock was just getting himself worked up over nothing; he couldn’t let doubt creep in. He was fine. It was fine. It was going to be fine. John would be home in thirteen minutes and then everything would be fine.
Comments, corrections, and criticisms are always welcome!
(Also if you notice a misspelling or mistake, tell me that too!)
“You think you’re funny, but you’re really not.” Sherlock grumbled, completely oblivious to the what had just been going on in John’s head.

Thrusting a leg between Sherlock’s, John ground hard against his husband. “Maybe.” He smirked.
John sat on the edge of the bed for a few minutes, just watching as Sherlock slept. He was almost afraid of leaving him, afraid that if he let him out of his sight, he would just slip away. It was ridiculous, Dr. Drier said Sherlock was going to be fine. His ribs would heal, his bruises would fade, he was going to be fine. But still, as he looked down at the black and blue marks that marred Sherlock’s normally alabaster skin, John felt his heart clench.
“Yes, and I can change into more ‘comfortable’ pajamas once we get home,” Sherlock added. “But for now, I want to leave this place looking and feeling like myself again.”
“I,” Sherlock took a deep breath, but kept his head down. He could do this, “I want to hyphenate.”
Sherlock didn’t hesitate for a single second, quickly rolling on the condom – Christ, he forgot how much he hated the feel of condoms – and slicking himself up before pushing into Jack. Jack was… oh god, Sherlock forgot how to breathe. Jack was tight, so tight. Jack was obviously a top, but the way he accepted Sherlock, the way he moaned and thrust back against Sherlock, clearly he wasn’t unfamiliar with bottoming. A top who was into occasional switching, so why… why was he bottoming for Sherlock? What was special about…
John and Sherlock end up spending time together outside of lessons, leading John to have a strange encounter.
“Like what?”
“Good.” John beamed, glancing down at their hands. “I’m actually really glad we did this, got the rings here. It gives them even more meaning, they’re like a permanent tie to this place, a permanent reminder of this fantastic weekend.”
John Watson, third year studying medicine, serial monogamist, part-time employee of the Chemistry and Biological Sciences department, and the starting defensive midfielder for the school’s football team. In short, John Watson was a veritable golden boy.
*******
“You can’t deny that Sherlock. You can’t deny what we have, so stop trying. Please don’t do this to us,” John whispers.
Sherlock grew quiet again, a small crease forming as he furrowed his brow. John didn’t want to move, didn’t want to say anything to disturb him, so he sat and waited and watched. He watched Sherlock think, as his words and arguments pinballed around Sherlock’s brain along whatever pathway in whatever patterns thoughts took in his funny, amazing head.  Sherlock would do the right thing, John knew it – knew Sherlock – and John would be there beside him every step of the way. No matter what, no matter how long, John would be there.
he groaned as John thrust against him again. “Oh John – I want –”
“Your recovery is going to be a three-stage process. The first stage is going to be while you’re here in hospital. We’ll be doing some pretty simple leg exercises; mostly just to get them moving to prevent any possible atrophy, and make sure to maintain proper circulation.” Meredith continued, unaware of Sherlock’s dwindling faith in her abilities. “We’ll also get you standing up, and hopefully get you taking a few steps. I also see that you of some minor burns, so we’ll have to be mindful of those.”
As if reading John’s mind – John still wasn’t convinced he couldn’t – Sherlock’s eyes snapped open, locking onto John’s. Then, without warning, John found himself being grabbed by the waist, and pulled almost flush against Sherlock.
“You wouldn’t dare!” Sherlock growled.
“She did, yeah.”
“I did, but I didn’t know it would awaken the Tolkinian scholar in you.”
There was no doubt in his mind that John had been taken against his will, but Sherlock had to make certain, and to do that, he had to check every place John could go, and ever had gone, to escape. Hurrying to the park at the end of his street, Sherlock had to consciously remind himself to breath as he looked at the little patch of grass, surrounded by trees and bushes.  Just twenty-four hours ago, Sherlock lay in that very spot, entangled with John, kissing, holding, feeling him, and now it was empty, no sign of John. The all encompassing joy he felt before, replaced by crushing fear, Sherlock had to keep moving or else he’d collapse under the weight of his worry.
“How so?”
“No, absolutely not. You should come.”
“It’s handmade jewelry.”
“Wait!” Sherlock’s hand shot out; stopping John as he was about to head for the door. “There’s enough room for two, you can stay.”
“It’s my middle name.”
As John’s arms tightened around him, Sherlock began to slowly roll his hips, and the kiss took on a life of its own. Hand wandered, lips parted, teeth nipped, tongues met, and breathing grew heavy. Sherlock felt a familiar tightness start to stir, but just as he was about to push John flat on the bed, divest him of his clothing, and indulge in what he’d been thinking about since they got on the train, another part of Sherlock’s anatomy made its presence known.
The footsteps above them were heavy, the voices muffled but strong, they didn’t belong to Moriarty or Seb – Sherlock knew what they sounded like – this was someone else, well multiple someone eleses, there had to be at least ten of them. This could be just the distraction he and John needed.
Feeling ridiculously brave, Sherlock chanced a look at John and saw him grinning at him. The other kids last year had made fun of his name, calling it freaky and weird just like Sherlock himself, but not John. John was being honest.
Unable to wait a moment more, Sherlock starts searching.
“May I?” Jack asked, looking up at Sherlock through golden eyelashes, his breath ghosting across Sherlock’s already hardening prick. Those eyes… so blue, so intense, and behind them, something so wickedly filthy.
Excellent, he had been looking forward to those two days, and just because Dr. Anthony ‘I’ve seen worse’ Monroe, that went straight to hell. Well, it wasn’t Sarah’s fault after all, no point taking it out on her.
“Ok, you get your butt in the shower, immediately” John calls over his shoulder as he trudges into the sitting room of 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock could feel John’s hand brush against his cheek, he could feel John’s heart thumbing as he placed his hand on John’s chest, his own heart pounded as if trying to escape his ribs. Their lips were a mere hairsbreadth away when…
The day after everything falls apart, John returns from class, just because his personal life is in shambles doesn’t mean John’s going to let his school work suffer, to find his flat as been cleared of everything Sherlock ever left. Clearly Sherlock stopped by when he was out, and sure enough the key John gave him is sitting on his desk. He’ll have to figure out a way of returning his key to Sherlock’s place, but he doesn't want to think about that now.
“Well yeah, you skipped a grade, obviously you’re smart. Even I could figure that out.”
“I did, but it’s always best to get confirmation from a reliable source.”
Was Sherlock actually in a sulk over thinking Harry was a he? John would have laughed, but he actually seemed genuinely upset. The man could read people lives at a glance, and he was upset about getting one little thing wrong. Definitely ridiculous.
“I don’t care how you do, just as long as you do.” John said. He was absolutely insufferable when he thought he’d won. “Oh, and grab some clothes and anything you might need for school. Actually, I’ll do it, you shouldn’t be bending or lifting anything right now.”
“If you need any help –”
“Oh, it was excellent!” Sherlock beamed, ecstatic to finally talk about a case with someone who wanted to hear it. “It started off as a simple suspected stalking. The police got nowhere, so they directed the girl to me…”
“All of the above.”
“Of course I want you number, it’s a lot more convenient than trying to catch you around campus. Hey… is something wrong?” John asked, finally noticing how tense Sherlock was, turning his head to try and see what Sherlock was looking for.
“Yes,” he nodded. “I want you to try and punch me… in the face. Was I not speaking clear enough?” he added with a smirk.
“Excellent! Mrs. Holmes,” John said, turning to Sherlock’s mum who was watching the exchange with a wry smile, “would you care to join? It’ll still be my treat.”
Sherlock? What did Sherlock have to do with anything? God, what was Sherlock involved in?
This, this would definitely kill him; all he wanted to do was take Sherlock by the hips and force him down so that he could feel Sherlock’s tight heat around himself. But bitting his lip, John regained control.
*SINGS 'AT LAST' BY ETTA JAMES*
“You’re very loyal, very quickly.”
Was John… But his
“John.” Sherlock breathed, rushing to John side and dropping to his knees. “HELP!” He shouted, praying whoever was upstairs heard the gun shot, and could hear him.
“You need more equipment than what you already have? The table is essentially covered as it is; we’ve no place to eat!”
“Gorgeous.” He breathed, and wrapped his arms around John’s waist, pulling him in to a long, languid kiss. If Sherlock spent the rest of his life in bed, wrapped around John, trading touches and kisses, it would have been a life well lived; everything else be damned. He knew he was being foolish, that it was all too soon, and he was getting carried away, but Sherlock didn’t care. He’d never felt like this before, and he was going to bask in the new, confusing, and amazing emotions John inspired for as long as humanly possible.
*******
“So are you just going to head back to campus now?” John asked. They were nearing a bus stop he could take back to his flat, and he could see some cabs on the road up head, but, well…
*******
“You’re actually going?” Harry huffed with a roll of her eyes.
Four days later, they sit on the edge of John’s bed while John examines Sherlock’s arm. It’s healing nicely, and John suspects it may not even leave a scar. But to be on the safe side, he decides to kiss each suture. You can never be too careful, after all. Once the cut is seen to, John continues and kisses every inch of Sherlock’s body, removing his clothing as he goes. John pays particular attention to a small freckle on Sherlock’s right hip, triggering an intoxicating mixture of moans and heady laughter from Sherlock. John then moves from Sherlock’s hips, to take Sherlock into his mouth, slowly running his tongue up and down the shaft, and lapping at the leaking head. Just before John can bring him to completion, Sherlock stops him. He then divests John of his clothes, before pulling John into his lap and takes them both in hand. They fall over the edge together, John panting ‘I love you’ over and over into Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock felt his stomach give the now all too familiar jolt. “Pardon?”
The need flooded Sherlock’s system, short circuiting every sound thought in his head. “You –
“Fine, fine.” John really didn’t want to deal with Mycroft’s meddling, at the moment he was more concerned with Sherlock. “How’s Sherlock? Is he okay? Did anything happen while I was asleep? How long was I asleep?” He asked, only just then realizing it had gone dark outside.
“There’s absolutely nothing wrong with wearing suits.” Sherlock said, sounding defensive.
“No, Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock and I aren’t –” John started to explain, but Mrs. Hudson cut him off.
“I’m her TA.” John smiled. “I’m John, John Watson.” He offered his hand, but Sherlock just stared at it before glancing up to look at John, a small frown furrowing his brow.
John could tell when he was getting the brush off, and Sherlock – opening one of his books and staring defiantly at his laptop – was definitely giving him the brush off. He was just trying to be nice, John thought as he left feeling annoyed. Sherlock was clearly in some sort of trouble, so why wouldn’t he accept help when help was offered? Well, John would just have to keep an eye out for him from now on.
he found in the kitchen. When Sherlock was set up at the kitchen table, John would find himself reading in his arm chair, listen to the clinking of glassware and Sherlock’s humming as he took notes. John would watch telly in the evenings, while Sherlock retreated to his ‘Mind Palace’. Or at least he claimed to go to his ‘Mind Palace’, but more than once, John had caught him reacting to what was just on the screen. And then there were times when they’d both be quietly on their computers, Sherlock spread out on the couch, and John at the desk, one of them would make a random passing comment, and thus spark an entire equally random conversation. John didn’t quite understand it, he had never really hung around the house with any of his friends with whom he’d previously flat-shared, but with Sherlock, they seemed to gravitate towards the same place, gravitate towards each other. Maybe it was just a symptom of age. Whatever it was, it was new, it was definitely different, and John found it oddly comforting.
“Her skin does have a red-ish tint to it. That could be a result of the heater running; it is rather stuffy in here. Or it could indicate…”
between him and Sherlock, and now he thinks he has finally found what he’s meant to do with his life. So when John arrives at the pub for lunch with Greg to catch up, the smile on his face and spring in his step is hard to miss.
“Nope, my mind is set. I’m sorry, but you’re stuck with me.” John grinned, and tightened is arms around Sherlock’s waist. “Not even an act of Parliament or Royal decree could keep me away from you.”
“Hey Love, it’s me. Can you buzz me in?”
What he wouldn’t have given to have Sherlock’s focus directed at him, or even just a percentage of it. Sure Sherlock had asked him a bit about his life – whatever he couldn’t deduce for himself – but anyone can feign interest, he was probably just trying to be polite. Sherlock didn’t strike him as the ‘being polite because that’s what you do’ type of man, but as John had to keep reminding himself, he only knew the man one day. But Christ did he want to get a chance to know him better. For the first time in years – even since before his disaster of an engagement – John felt
“And that’s why you’re looking into work as a GP, the decrease in your fine motor skills.” It wasn’t a question.
“My clothes?” he answered slowly, feeling unsure.
When John had met Sherlock outside the library for Sherlock’s birthday celebration, he had not imagined the evening would end with him crouched down next to the infuriating birthday boy, hiding behind a door in New Scotland Yard. He hadn’t been sure exactly what Sherlock has ‘always wanted to do’; minor vandalism to Mycroft’s flat? Sure.  Breaking into St. Bart’s to play with some of their more high-tech lab equipment? That was definitely something Sherlock would do. But this, breaking in to police headquarters to install a patch on the computers of all homicide DIs? They were so getting arrested.
Sherlock continued to shout for help, he continued to apologize, the tears continued to fall, and John remained unconscious.
“Hey Sherlock, do you remember my friend Peter from uni?”
Fucking Malcolm couldn’t leave well enough alone. “Well now you know, and now you can leave. I’ll be fine.”
“I’m John, John Watson.”
“And it just so happens to coincide with you having temporary medical issues?”
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel… uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.”
“Don't you see, Sherlock, don't you see? You're not what he wants.” Moriarty hissed. “He will never want you, not really.”
“That wasn’t just me, and going to war is nothing compared to propositioning the world’s only consulting detective!”
“He’s getting desperate.” Sherlock said one evening in their cell.
“Hundreds of people pass through every day, it’d be virtually impossible to ID and interview everyone.” Mrs. Holmes said
“Sister?” That wasn’t right. “No, you have a brother.” Sherlock frowned.
“I give you my personal assurances no harm will come from letting us examine the note.” Added Mr. Holmes.
doesn't
“Why would you be in the way?” Sherlock frowned. If anything, he wanted John closer.
“Oh, John. You’re far more than that. I wouldn’t keep you around if you were
“You’re the one…” Lestrade just stared at John for a few seconds before suddenly grabbing the offered hand in both of his. “Oh, well thank God you were there! Really, you probably saved his life, who knows what would have happened had you not been there. Ah, sorry, I didn’t hurt you, did I?” He added, just registering the bandages.
Feeling the conversation stray in to territory far too emotionally dangerous, John changes the topic to Sherlock’s work with the Yard, and him coming back to London.
“Is everything ok?” Molly asked, her voice breaking through the fog.
“Well you have one.” John’s voice was once again calm, but left no room for arguments. “Now I’m taking you to hospital, and you’re going to be checked out by a real doctor if I have to throw you over my shoulder and carry you there myself.”
“Are you sure? I’ve never… not with a man. I want this, but I don’t know how good I’ll be. I want this to be good for you. This has to be good for you. We can just keep using hands if you want… or, or mouths.”
“Tell me, Greg, please just tell me. He’s not… is he…” John was shaking now, he felt cold, he felt weak, it was like Bart’s all over again. All that time wasted, why did he walk out? Why did he leave? He should have been there; his place was with Sherlock, always.
“No. No more women. Not anymore.”
“Dr. Flat-Face said he was going to get you, but I wasn’t sure if he was telling me the truth.”
“I could have, yeah, but this way you have a reminder. We can’t risk you getting caught up in some case file or experiment, and forgetting.”
“Hmm?”
John wasn’t going to let it bother him that Sherlock turned him down for dinner. He didn’t have to be a genius to figure out that Sherlock was uncomfortable in social situations, and perhaps an entire day together wore him out. He wasn’t going to let it bother him, but that didn’t stop him from feeling a bit disappointed. Listening to Sherlock’s stories was nothing short of, well, amazing – god, he was really starting to overuse that word. Sherlock’s mind worked like nothing John had ever seen before. The way he saw thing, knew things, figured everything out with what to anyone else would be next to nothing… Amazing. And the way he got lost in his stories, his hands flying every which way, his eyes bright and excited, the smile that lit up his face when John managed to get something right, well that didn’t really hurt matters.
“Oh god, we can’t have that.” John grinned. “No, no matter what day we practice, you’ll always be Mr. Thursday Night to me.”
“Same time tomorrow?” Sherlock asked when John got up, looking hopeful. It was almost hard to believe that three days ago, John had no idea who Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes was, it felt like they’d known each other for years, that Sherlock had always been part of his life.
When they reached Scotland Yard, Lestrade and Sherlock headed back up to the seventh floor, while Evans dropped off the evidence. Walking into the incident room, or ‘the command center’ as Whately called it, Sherlock found his mother speaking with Greg, Greg jotting down notes, and Whately hunched over a desk, speaking to a curly haired woman Sherlock had never seen before.
“Then don’t you think, John, that it’s high time we head back to our room?”
“Yeah, here. What were you doing?”
For the next half hour, Sherlock tried – and failed – to get back into the proper headspace to continue his experiment. It was useless, he couldn’t get the image of John and the faceless future Mrs. Watson out of his head.  Them sitting side by side on the train ride, his arm around her, her head resting on his shoulder. Them walking hand in hand as they explored the town, before heading to the party to drink and dance, and be surrounded by other happy couples. Them locked away in their shared room, in their shared bed. Sherlock needed out of the flat, he needed air.
“I’m not sure spending the night pressed together on the couch is the best idea for your leg, or for my shoulder.”
“I told her you’d let her know if you needed anything. Said she’s ready to help in any way she can.” Sherlock just nodded. Dependable Molly, just one more person for whom to be grateful.
February meant head colds, the seasonal flu, and sore throats, along with the year-round earaches, rashes, and asthma flare-ups. And while John was kept busy tending to London’s sick and aching, the work was not as mentally taxing as he wished, and his thoughts inevitably floated back to dark curls, pale skin, and a razor sharp mind that couldn’t leave well enough alone.
“No! I don’t need anyone fighting my battles for me” Who the hell did John think he was? Sherlock didn’t need a hero.
“They do make quite a formidable team.”
“Funny, you don’t seem very afraid,” the man said, tilting his head. John fought off the chill running down his spine. He was being sized up, he was being evaluated.
“You’re damn right there’s not going to be a next time. We’re going to report them!”
It takes them several minutes of aftershocks to come down from their highs. Lying on his side, John pulls Sherlock against him, not caring about the stickiness of their bodies. Sherlock kisses him sloppily, fingers digging into John’s back, John’s hands running along Sherlock’s and up into his now sex messed curls. The kisses and hands begin to slow as John feels the potent combination of alcohol and exhaustion start to set in, and eventually sleep pulls him under, Sherlock still wrapped in his arms.
“He’s going to be just fine. It looks a lot worse than it really is.” Dr. Drier explained, his voice remaining calm and level. “There was a lot of bruising to his face and torso. His right wrist is sprained, and there’s a lot of swelling to his left knee and ankle, but that should go down with some ice. The worst of it are his ribs. Like I said, there’s a lot of bruising to his torso, and he does have hairline fractures to the sixth and seventh ribs on the left side. They’re very minor breaks, and as long as they stay bound, they’ll heal perfectly.”
“That’s the carton we found John’s phone in, and she just threw it in the bin!” Sherlock was moving like a whirlwind, zooming in on the woman’s face, he had to identify her, he needed to speak with her immediately.
“Well excuse me.” Lestrade sighed. “Molly, do you mind if I borrow a pen?”
“Thursdays and Sundays are probably my best nights. We have games Friday so the team likes taking the night off before, and we never plan anything for Sundays since a lot of the guys on the team are hung over from the night before.” John explained
name, John’s name. John had done this to him, it was a high he didn’t know he was worthy of, to be the one to drive Sherlock Holmes to the point of such disorder and delirium.
“Aren’t you supposed to be in class?” Sherlock asked, refusing to give John the satisfaction of seeing his surprise.
“To my physical therapy. I find you… I find your presence there indispensable.” Sherlock’s eyes were wide, he looked worried, he thought of John, John’s presence, as indispensable. John felt his chest tighten a fraction. That was not helping matters.
*******
So much for no insults at John’s first crime scene.
“You worrying that we’d never have met if we hadn’t been put in the same class. Of course we would have met. Of course we’d be right here,” murmured John, his hold on Sherlock’s waist momentarily tightening, “dancing to this song you wrote for us, that you wrote for our wedding.”
Sherlock beamed. John was… well he wasn’t a genius, but he was pretty damn smart. Sherlock could count on one hand the number of people he met in the entirety of his thirty-three years that he could describe as ‘pretty damn smart.’ John wasn’t just smart, though, he also seemed to inspire genius in others, in Sherlock. In the past few months, with just the cold cases, he had the tendency to say something, or notice something, and it would be just the spark Sherlock needed to finally see the whole picture and put everything together. Obviously Sherlock would have seen it and solve it anyway, but John’s presence seemed to speed up the process. John made Sherlock faster, better, they wasted less time.  And Lestrade wondered why Sherlock brought John along. Lestrade really was an idiot.
and I finished interviewing you all. And we wrote notes here in our little... little do-hickey.” (he wiggled the notebook in his hands) “And we're done now. We are finished. Fiiiiinito. And I, the great and handsome DI William Scott, do hereby release you from your duty to the law! Thank you, thank you very much,” Sherlock did an odd Elvis impression that made a few people giggle and then he bowed flamboyantly. “Now, if we could all just cheer up a bit and forget about this dreadful murder business, that would be good. The night is young! Let us toast! To life! To love! And to sweet delicious Alcohol to rid us of our sorrows!”
“Wonderful, wonderful!” Angelo beams and gestures them through to the table by the window that he and Sherlock had sat at the first time they had met. Angelo removes the sign that says ‘reserved’ and helps Sherlock to adjust the high chair that has been placed at the table for Rosie.
Harry gave John a sad look then but still managed to shout at him, “
Josh’s smile grows into something more reassuring and he says, “Nah, little lover’s spat, that’s all.”
“I don't need his approval, Anthea, I just need yours. I'm telling you, it's a great idea.”
Sherlock doesn’t see Eurus before his song is finished. A case comes up the next day and he sends Mycroft along with a gift for her. He sends her some of her favourite biscuits and a letter saying he’s sorry he can’t come. As an extra treat he’s written her a few notes from his song so far. Mycroft texts to say she had been pleased.
So that was it.
“There he is!” Grag shouts, pointing somewhere ahead of them.
“So it is,” John smiles tenderly at her and sits on the couch to watch with her. Rosie sits perfectly still in her playpen, mesmerized by the narrator speaking to the big fat onscreen dog on a rocking horse. John’s mind begins to wander as he sits, barely paying any mind to what’s happening.
“Mrs. Hudson is on vacation — .” Molly starts.
“I've lost count, honestly” Mary laughed, a sweet sound that rang through the small office “How you remember that is beyond me.”
Sherlock raises a brow, “Don’t encourage her, John,” then turning to Rosie he continues, “Watson, if you’re going to frame someone, at least make sure they’re animate. It’ll make your argument much more believable.”
“Alright, fine! What about the piece I wanted to do on the trends in suicides after singles attended weddings? That was an incredibly interesting piece!”
Of course for destiny, it’s too much for Sherlock to ask for a good thing to last. His tender moment is broken with the speakers suddenly blaring his ringtone. Irene answers the phone quickly just as Sherlock stops waltzing about the room with Rosie.
watch this! Just let me say one thing!
He asks himself mentally. He feels suddenly foolish for dressing himself up. He hadn’t planned on it at first but he hadn’t been able to help it. After he’d finally gotten to shower (Rosie had been napping on a blanket in her playpen in his bedroom) he’d found himself seeking out his shaving kit, his cologne and his most flattering outfit. He’d even put a bit of product in his hair.
“Upstairs, now.” Sherlock growls, finally detaching himself.
long did you finally concede to meeting me? Normally I'd say it was my devastating good looks but... well, you seem to be immune to those, considering how long you've been saying no... and then suddenly, out of no where... why?” He removed a long dark Belstaff coat and a powder blue scarf from around his neck and placed them behind the chair as he joined John at the bar.
“We are not hydroplaning, I've got everything under control!” John yelled as he attempted to steer the car with only his right hand.
to see this!” She’s practically vibrating as she passes him the phone, taking his coffee so he can hold the machine in his hand.
_______________________
’! And while Sherlock abhors that particular word as a descriptor, he absolutely loves the idea of
surprised Irene. The boy hadn’t pestered Sherlock once. Instead, he’d sat by Irene, which she’d found odd because she was sure the boy hated her and saw her as competition for Sherlock’s affection. He’d smiled at her and had engaged her in an amicable conversation. Irene is shrewd, however, and she had soon figured out why the boy was bothering her instead of Sherlock.
As they made their way up the road, Sherlock tried to think of a way out of this. He only hoped that by the time John noticed Sherlock was missing it would be too late, and if he did notice early, then sherlock hoped he wouldn't do anything stupid. He doubted he would, with the way he seemed to dislike Sherlock, even if he
Mary shrugged, “Alright...” She said, leaving.
Sherlock sniffs, clearly annoyed at Lestrade’s rebellion then extends his arm towards Molly. “Shall we?”
“This is so much fun!” Harry squealed.
“What? No, it's an olive green, it's very stylish. It fits really well, I'm telling you.” John insisted.
became partner to a world-famous detective, didn’t you? People really are quite versatile aren’t they?”
Holy rusted metal Batman! What a fuckin’ doozy of a chapter. It ended up being super long and I really just had to cut it off here so you guys could read it sooner. For some reason whenever I write a case it gets annoyingly long and complicated because I always start off without a plot and then I add all these stupid details that I later have to go back and address because I forget about them, and then I have to avoid all the inevitable plot-holes (I always miss something though).
“What?!” John asked, completely anxious “No, it's not weird. She's my boss, I don't care, why would it be weird?”
“And that's just her CV. She is an unbelievable boss. Everybody loves her, everybody. And she loves the service dogs she trains more than anyone else. She doesn't eat meat, which is pretty sweet of her, and she would rather spend all her time helping people than anything else.” John continued, smiling wistfully.
“She always knows how to keep me entertained. She even promised to help me start my own cleaning business.” Archie smiled and gave Harry a thumbs up, but then saw an odd expression of shock on her face, and realized what he'd said. “Oh... right... I wasn't supposed to tell you, Mary,” The look Mary gave Harry was not pleasant, as the little boy continued, “but I'm actually quite excited,” (Harry gave a weak worried open-mouthed smile in response to Mary's look of disappointment), “I'm only doing Harry and Mary's place right now, but if anyone's in the market for a really good cleaning service, you can speak to me in the lobby.” Archie finished, smiling pleasantly, “Thank you”
It had taken three of them to hold Sherlock down on the bed he'd been fighting so hard when they had taken John. He realized now that it wasn't frustration at his brother he had been seeing, the detective had been furiously terrified until Will had knocked him out with a rag of chloroform. Sherlock had figured it out even back then, he knew what was going to happen. Fuck, John didn't want that to be the last image of Sherlock he'd ever see, he tried to focus back to before that, pinned under Sherlock on the living room floor, desperate and needy and that intense gaze that missed absolutely nothing and stored it in that brilliant eidetic memory of his. He'd seen Sherlock steal his hairbrush before for some nefarious purpose, and return it as clean as when it was new, so Sherlock probably even had his DNA matrix memorized if he went looking for it in his mind palace. If he ever found so much as a fingernail, he'd know it was John's, and somehow that was comforting.
It felt like a whole stone slammed into Anderson's stomach. Everyone had noticed that Sherlock's behavior had changed drastically after John arrived. So many people were relieved about it, swore up, down, and sideways that it was so much better this way, begging John to keep it up because it made their jobs and lives a bit easier. Begging him to... oh gods.
No. Anderson didn't want to believe it. He LIKED John, the man had a noble streak a mile wide and was so damned kind and helpful, and he managed to rein in Sherlock...
"A peaceful bit of Heaven in a chaotic and hectic world. Thank you John."
'Damage Control' he'd said, and Sherlock had remembered too late the one time that had included another person, a young woman named Shelly when he'd been in Uni, she'd been his supplier, and had been slightly less tedious than the rest of the droning chattel there so he didn't object to her giving him a discount if he let her stay so they could get high together.
"Yes, of course you have, 'The only one who would notice or care if you disappeared', 'makes a fine cup of tea', 'Enjoys the violin,' 'nerves of steel', 'valuable informant on a number of subjects I have long since deleted', and dozens of others. Considering how you usually describe people as nothing more than 'boring', 'tedious', 'obvious', and 'predictable', that is high praise indeed."
John’s gut feeling proved correct. Once Sherlock found the pattern in other cases it was easy to track down the original victims associates, and his motives. The mass murderer turned out to be Devin Longsworth, age 21. He was an insulin dependent diabetic man whose looks had deteriorated vastly and rapidly in his very early teenage years due to the sudden onset of the disease in an episode which nearly killed him when he was 13. Afterwards, his inability and unwillingness to manage it properly led to depression, extreme weight gain, permanently discolored his skin to a dark reddish purple at the cheeks, wrists, hands, and lower legs, going blind in one eye, and him needing to have some of his fingers and toes amputated. And to top it all off the hormones of puberty gave him severe acne which scarred him with deep pock marks. He had gone from being a popular kid having a promising career in modeling, to being the child who was excessively bullied in school in less than a year.
And just a heads up, things are
“I’m Dr. Drier, Sherlock’s doctor.” Dr. Drier said, shaking John’s hand. “I’ve heard good things about you.” He added with a light chuckle.
“I did. It was. It is.” John sputtered, his eyes wide. “The adrenaline rush was… ah… was an added bonus.” He finished, looking a bit sheepish.
Sherlock’s pacing comes to an abrupt stop. “Scared? Why would I be scared? I’m not the weak-minded moron charging head first into a war zone, trying to act out some misguided hero fantasy.”
“You know I will always try to look out for you, baby brother.” Mycroft’s smile lacked some of its usual condescending edge. “Though I must say, I believe my job has been usurped. And loathe as I am to admit it, I’m rather glad John Watson refused my offer of money for information. He’s been a good influence on you.”
