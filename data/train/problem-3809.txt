Dean gave him a reassuring smile while he nodded. Cas returned the smile but it was more apologetic before he relaxed into the memory foam bed. Dean watched him for a second more, enjoying a view he never thought he would ever see before he got under the blanket and turned to face Cas’s awaiting stare.
"I-I don't." Cas looked away from Dean as he took a step away from him while he matter of factly said, "I'm not suicidal."
Dean’s eyes wandered up as he felt the voice to be a little familiar. He looked up to see a tall handsome man with his phone balancing between his shoulder and his ears as he made his way to a free table. Dropping the shopping bags on the chair across from him and then falling into a chair himself.
“Promise.”
Dean was locked up in a room full of hot-headed Novak siblings while they read Chuck's last testimony out loud. Lucky for Dean, Cas doesn't mind being used as a pillow. Unlucky for Dean, Cas's siblings are assholes.
“Are you mad at me?” Dean looked at the empty kitchen as Cas stood between his legs, but his arms stayed limp on his sides.
Cas made his way to Jack’s side, dropping the bag on the nightstand while he watched Jack sleep for a few seconds.
“Hey.” Dean wiped his eyes with the back of his hand as he tried to smile down at his angel. “You dumb son of a bitch. You scared the shit out of me.”
It was Cas turn to introduce his three people, he can ask Cas about that later but right now he had names to learn.
Cas couldn't help the smile as he thinks that that was pretty cute. This bad boy is turning out to be such a softy that Cas couldn't help the giggle that escaped his lips. He covered his mouth and tries to hold in his laugh.
Made him carry the baggage of a torn-apart family.
“No. I’m giving him a gift.” She stared at him with a confused look and pout on the lips.
"Forgot how you guys just pop out of nowhere," Dean comments and then noticed it was a familiar face. "Jim, right?"
What color heart do you think Dean sent Cas?
“He was a stripper, Dean. You paid for him to give me a lap dance.”
Maybe that was it.
“Will you two hen’s stop clucking and get on with it before Cas humps my leg to death.”
He dropped the pan in the sink and ran over to see his kid standing on a chair with the phone in his hand while talking in his most serious voice — it was cute with his little concentration face — before he made eye contact with Dean.
Dean just nodded and jogged towards the room and then took a deep breath before he entered the room that decorated with a huge circular couch, coffee table in the middle, and there was a bar behind the cameras. At least Dean knew where he was heading as soon as this was over.
"It's a discussion."
It wasn’t until Cas and Dean were in bed again that Dean talked again; pink noise filling in the silence, a night light by Cas’s side of the bed reflecting stars into the ceiling, lavender mist sprayed over their pillowcases, and a weighted blanket waiting by their feet. He was curled up to Cas’s side, head resting on his boyfriend’s bare shoulder that smelled like clean soap from the shower while relaxing to Cas’s fingers playing with his drying hair.
“He’s so desperate for your approval.” She walks over to him until they were standing mere inches apart. The pull that he once felt towards her was long gone, and while she may still say that he was important to her. Dean has now become second place in her heart. “He was willing to become
“Stop making excuses for him!”
“Kid…” Dean sighed, head scrambling for words.
“Ah.” Cas nodded, another smile. This one was softer and warmer. A smile that felt reserved for just Dean. Cas’s cheeks were even rosy from the cold wind piercing through their many layers. “Understood. I’ll take the cart back and you start the car then.”
“I don’t do that.”
Dean came back downstairs clean and with the Christmas sweater he has found in the closet on. He followed the scent of bacon and found Cas making breakfast in the kitchen. Dean was sure it was his Cas when he heard him singing roughly to the jingle bell rock. Maybe Cas will know what’s happening.
“Dean!” Sam said patting his back but then he feels a hand gently placed on his cheek making him feel better, the grace inside him making him feel alive.
His smile was small and it so soft that it made Dean’s heart race for just realizing, no, he knew this a long time ago but now he’s really admitting to himself how beautiful Cas was.
Dean was looking at the camera through the mirror as he smiled, “Awesome.” And he spits.
"But Ellen!" Sam wined as he turns to look at her. "Jess hasn't gotten here yet."
Sam was smoothing Jack’s back while giving Dean a nod before motioning to the other unconscious body. He smiled reassuringly at him before giving his attention back to Jack.
Then he felt the man’s hand grip at his throat, fingers digging into his skin and blocking his airway. That’s where the peaceful death he longed for was replaced by fear.

“So, are you gonna tell me why you’re mad?”
What the hell did he sign up for?
“Dean?”
Cas smiled at him, warm and filled with so much love that Dean just wanted to be someone who deserved to be looked at like that before he left the room—leaving Mia and Dean alone again. They retook their seats while Dean watched as she opened her notebook before clicking her pen back to life.
“While Gabe is coming with Sam.” Cas finishes.
Las cadenas del maldito miedo that held him back from even
It has only been a few hours of Amara, but Dean could see Cas tense up with every second, his eyes never looking over at where Amara was talking and mostly humming in response.
to you after you kept calling him your
“Oh yeah? What are you going to say to her?”
“It’s still me, Dean. I promise.” Jack said between squished lips and tried to smile, comfort him, while Dean nodded at his words.
Those words make him stare up at her and watch as she holds a glowing vial that matched Cas’s own. He reaches to take it with shaky hands, staring at it while a lump filled his throat.
He didn’t feel like drowning today, but he would like to take a long hot shower and then soak in a hot bath. He would like to feel the burn of the water instead of the burn of skin against his own.
But here Jack was now, an actual-looking four-year-old that barely reached his hips and loved to hug Dean’s leg as they traveled from room to room in the bunker. He looked happier than he has ever seen him, and —while he still sometimes talks like the old Jack and holds his memories — he was free to act his age.
Life is a little overwhelming for Dean at the moment but at least he is sure about one thing. He really loves Cas.
They decided it was probably for the best to wait for Rowena to heal Cas before they went out for a witch hunt. They barely got out of there when it was the three of them and she still had the home advantage. Probably the reason why she wasn’t leaving her house any time soon. Maybe with Cas back and Rowena by their side they could leave this town before dinner. It’s going to be an awkward 10-hour drive back home.
He should have tried more. He should have worked harder to talk to Cas. To make him talk about his damn emotions and trauma so Dean could understand. Could see that Cas was overwhelmed with it all and…and….
“Then what’s wrong? You have been acting a little off lately. Sam only laughs and walks away when I ask him about it. Jack tends to copy Sam and excuses himself. Ever since the last case with that man-”
Cas never responded to texts, calls, or emails. After a few months, Dean stopped trying.
He felt a warm hand run circles down his back, and he didn’t have to look up because, of course, he would lean down until they were eye to eye. Until they were equal.
Dean was still getting used to the sleeping arrangements they had to continually adjust for Cas’s comfort, to have a full night’s sleep, hopefully. Still, they have tried oils, pillow sprays, weighted blankets, white noise machines, night lights, and a stricter bedtime schedule for everyone with no success.
“I guess so.” Jack smiled at him, glowing in curiosity. “I didn’t know there was a name for what I have! Is it normal?”
He didn’t look up until he heard the door click close. When he was alone, he stood up and started to pace the room while he bit at his nails, something he hasn’t done for a long time. He noticed that since some of the hero mojo left him, more of his old habits started to come back. Comforting him in knowing that these were all his actual nervous ticks, that he had nervous ticks in general. A new one that appeared was putting Cas’s grace necklace against his mouth, feeling the warm buzz tickle his lips.
“Fuck off and just fix him.” Dean says as he pulls away only for Cas to nuzzle himself into his neck. Dean swore he was going to have a hickey if Cas kept sucking on his skin like that, a last parting gift before Rowena took this Cas away for good.
was working on it. Just cause he saved the world, and everything was calm for now doesn’t mean he was now filled with the ability to communicate. He was trying, damn it, but it just isn’t always so easy to ask for forgiveness when he wholeheartedly doesn’t believe he deserved it.
“How much?”
Dean didn’t answer. Instead, he leaned forward to capture Cas’s lips again. Kissing him until he was dizzy because kissing Cas was the best change in his life. Having him. Loving him. He can do this for as long as forever.
“Well, yeah. But he’s three. He doesn’t understand everything just yet.”
“Come on, you two. We still need to go and buy Jack some new clothes, remember?” Cas called out to them.
Dean cooked them a quick breakfast of just some bacon mixed with eggs, coffee, toast, and a side of some microwave pancakes. John came down to join them as soon as the food was done and it was a silent breakfast until Dean tells Sam to go shower next, he can use whatever was left of the hot water since Dean is used to the cold. A cold shower would do him some good.
, Dean felt like a teenager having his first kiss all over again.
“Okay, pues, have fun! Bring her home to say hi.” Bobby practically pushed him out the door with Sam happily towering behind him with the same annoying grin.
It’s been a week since Cas and Jack came back from the big empty and it’s been…awkward.
“Back off, asshole, and just tell me what Rowena said.”
A week into their relationship and nightmares haunt their bed.
simply rolled his eyes at him. “Okay, you stay here. Talk to your son, and I’ll go talk to the other kid.”
“I’ll be back soon.” Dean has told him this already, but it was reassuring, even to himself, to say it again. “I’ll get you some new food you can try.”
“Hey,” Dean grabbed his face in between his hands and made Cas look at him. His blue eyes looked strained and the flicker of red was starting to grow as he fought the curse. “I’m fine, Cas. Probably fine is an understatement but I’m good. Seriously, Cas, I don’t mind. Plus, the alternative is you kind of humping yourself to death and I’m not gonna let you go out like that.”
“Because it’s just…It’s not me! I know what I’ve done. I know what happened to me. I know my life was fucked up! So what will Mia help me with if I know I’m fucked up!”
"I know but I'm already happy, Sammy. Really."
“You made him into a bomb!”
“Can you make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead?”
Cas shook his head, more like at himself than Dean, as he whispered. "I can't. It's... embarrassing. I'm an angel. I shouldn't be feeling so much. Or at all."
may not be your Dad, but he loves you like a daughter. Sometimes—yeah, a lot of the time actually—he makes stupid decisions, but it’s cause he is trying his best. And he cares. That
“You’re holding hands!” Jack pointed at their joined hands and then covered his mouth. “Oops. Sam said not to point it out.”
Dean felt a kiss on top of his head that made him realize how cold he was because as soon as he felt those lips in his hair, he warmed right up. As if he came back to life.
Dean drove to Cas’s house, waiting outside a few minutes before seven. He wasn’t sure what he should do. Does he honk the horn, or is that too rude? Should he park and get out of the car to knock? That seemed too much like a date thing. And he still wasn’t sure if this was a date or two not-strangers hanging out.
Dean ignored Charlie as he looked around the crowded place. “Cas!”
She rolled her eyes, once again the gesture was familiar, before slamming the shake on the hood and sliding off the car. She crossed her arms over her chest, looking so small as she kicked a pebble on the floor.
"Yeah. I just wished you had somebody you can grow old with. I read Aro people can date too."
Dean didn’t argue. It was nice not to be alone during the holiday season but at the same time, he hoped Cas didn’t stay behind just for him. Dean would have done what he always did for Christmas. Go to a bar full of lonely people and find someone, or someone’s, to have some fun holiday party on a motel bed.
Sorry, the chapter is so late! My fever kinda spiked today than the days before so I slept in a little and moving the screen was making me dizzy lol but I finished writing! Now I'm hoping it made sense but if it didn't then let me know...I will reread it and fix it haha
"Who says I don't have someone like that?"
He pulled away and as quickly as he appeared in Dean’s room he disappeared.
Three people. That's enough for Cas to feel much better about this decision he is making. But once again he decided to ask if he was making some sort of mistake.
Dean’s favorite time is when they would sit on the couch and read after a long day. They would get into each other personal space and just read in silence for an hour or two and it wouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Dean didn’t even mind that they haven’t even had sex by the third month as long as he got to spend some time with Cas.
“I know it’s stupid and-and I’m acting like a child, but…” She quickly sniffled again before running her hand through her hair nervously. Looking up to stare into the darkening sky, acting like everything was okay. “He’s not my Dad, but he’s the closest thing I have, and I just thought—I just thought that maybe he felt the same way.”
“Just the raspado today.” Dean still loved when Cas said it, trying not to laugh even though he loved Cas’s embarrassed blushing. Cas reaches into his pocket, but Dean reaches to touch his shoulder to stop him.
“Yes. Our’s.” Dean feels Cas’s arms slide up his back. “Are you okay?”
and knowing it’s not
“Yeah.” Cas sighed, shoulders slumping as he reached to run his hand through his hair—that probably explains the bed head—before smiling back at Dean with a deep breath. “Yeah. I’m fine.”
Dean wasn’t so good at his words, a surprise to nobody, but he tried to smile. He nodded once as he let those words sink into him again before he turned his head to kiss Cas’s palm.
Thank you again for the comments on my last chapter! It means a lot to me! I hope you guys enjoy this story as much I'm enjoying writing it.
“You want to talk about it?” Dean moved so he can hold on to Cas better. His hand reaching to gently smooth his hair down.
"Well, I do have someone in mind actually." Sam stared down at his glass. "I'm just worried about you."
“But Cas-” Dean pushed himself off the table, but Cas shook his head again.
Now he was sitting awkwardly in Jody’s living room watching
They both knew it wasn’t going to last long, the separation, because as soon as the night drags on they always find themselves in each other’s space.
Cas hugged her to his chest and hid his face into her fur as she happily wagged her tail. “You don’t want me to kiss someone with gross beef jerky breath, right princess?”
“Victor,” Dean called his friend over again. “No le digas a nadie que estaba aquí. Okay? Or I’m gonna steal all your customers otra vez.”
“Dude, are you listening?” Sam looked behind him at Cas before looking back at Dean, a grin growing as he raised his eyebrows. “What? Boyfriend didn’t want to hold your hand?”
“No, it’s not, Dean. I’m just forcing myself on you and you don’t want this.” Cas made a pained noise. “I’m sorry. I’ll do my best to behave myself.”
Sometimes they just need a hug. They deserve all the hugs.
"What's so funny?" Dean whispered back to him and stood on his elbow to look down at Cas. He had a smile and Cas smiled back as he removed his hand to stare up at Dean. Luckily it wasn't so dark under the sheets and Cas could see Dean's freckled face. He really likes those freckles.
“He won’t be home for a while so just let me - Just tell me what you need, and I’ll help.”
“Of course.” Dean laughed before shaking the hair at the back of Cas’s head. He hasn’t cut his hair or anyone’s hair with scissors in a while, but he remembers doing it to Sam when they were little. He left Cas’s hair still a little long, loving the way Cas wakes up with all of it sticking up, but cut it short enough that it wouldn’t touch Cas’s neck or go over his ears anymore.
Dean couldn’t find it in himself to answer back to him but his actions always spoke for him before, Cas knew that, so before he could overthink and psych himself out, he leaned down to press a soft kiss to Cas’s chapped lips.
Dean kicked off the blankets and put on his slippers as he made his way out of the bedroom. On nights like this, Dean always found Cas either in the bathroom or the kitchen. If he was in the bathroom Dean hoped he’d find his boyfriend pass out in the tub again and not hunched over a toilet. Though Dean wishes to find him in the kitchen instead because that meant Cas just needed a cup of tea to calm himself down and whatever carb they had laying around.
“I don’t look four.”
Cas shrugged. “You can make it up to me later. Now take it.”
Before Cas can say anything, Dean sat up on his elbow to look down at Cas, seeing his concerned face light up by the dim blue light. This relationship felt like it’s been going on for years, but it still felt so new, touching Cas. Having Cas hands on him just for comfort and knowing that if Dean leaned down to bring their mouths together, Cas wouldn’t push away. And being in love wasn’t new, but this…with Cas was much more.
"What are you eating, Sam?" Cas then asked and Dean dropped a cup that luckily didn't break. "Are those my cookies?"
A few years ago he wouldn’t have thought it was romantic - there was no kissing or grunting in this scene what so ever- but the soft touches is what he craves now. He was already so close to Cas as it is. Feeling the warmth radiate off his best friend while his blanket was now over both their laps, he doesn’t even remember when that happened.
Cas is nothing but a customer that Dean has been crushing on—it was a small, slow, and scary realization. The only reason they’re on a first-name basis now is because Cas once left his name tag on, and Dean asked what it meant.
“Claire, of course-”
“Dean,” Dean doesn’t look up as he hears Cas call out to him.
“Morning, Sunshine.”
“Sit down. I’ll make you some food.”
“Whatever, dude, just come here and keep me company while I read.”
Claire teased with a little smirk. She definitely learned this from Dean or Jody. “Whatever you say, old man.”
"Fine, son. Just dandy." He gulped down and reached to pull his tie off but then he thought it threw and didn't touch it. John’s hands were shaking along with his jumping leg but that's all the signs that Dean can read. Of course, this isn't easy on him and Dean understood that and that's why he was thankful that John was willing to stop drinking for the day.
“Don’t worry, bud.” Dean watched Jack’s eyes that showed how much he has experienced, how much he understood. “He’ll be fine.”
“Cas,” Dean dropped Cas’s hands and reached to cradle his face gently. “Talk to me, please. Let me help. Tell me how to help you.”
“Cas, not like this.”
“Mmm,” She hummed as she wrote. “Sounds normal enough.”
"Hello." Dean heard a deep velvet voice come out of this man's lips and Dean might as well be drooling.
“I don’t know-”
arms. She clicked her tongue before turning back to the door. “I’m leaving.”
“Wow. It’s like I just learned a cheat code or something!” Dean smiles a little excited. “What else do you do?”
“Llámame mañana!”
He started to stand up, but then a knee went flying to his face, knocking him back when he felt his nose crunch in the process. Blood was slipping in between his lips as he blinked up at the night sky that still comforted him.
“I’m sorry.” Dean looked down to try and smile at him. “I’m fine. No need for a big speech.”
They did, and Dean’s breath catches in his throat before he works on chicharrones, lots of limon, and a little bit of chile.
When they finally landed and Dean, who woke up with three hours left of the plane ride, helped Cas with his bags to their next car ride to the hotel.
Su Tio, though, cared a lot. Dean has to constantly remind him that Dean didn’t cheat on her, and he just broke it off cause Cassie was too smart for him.
Cas didn’t answer for what felt like a minute before he mumbled, “I don’t want to be.”
“Where are you going?”
Their shoulders brushed as they walked, and fingers twitched to hold him again, but Dean ignored it, had enough practice with that to successfully do so.
“And what’s that?”
Cas looked down at his clothes and opened his trench coat more to show Dean the dark green flower-patterned button-down shirt he was wearing underneath.
“He protected me. He—he saved me.”
He let his forehead fall against Cas’s shoulder. “
“She’s gay, dude.” Dean tells him and then calls back to Charlie over his shoulder. “If Bobby calls, tell him I went home with a headache!”
Cas quickly got up and started following Dean out the door. “I thought your girlfriend said you had to go to work.”
“Prove it, damn it! Prove that I mean more-oof!”
Looking at Dean he was sure this was all a joke or a huge mistake. Dean was...he was beyond what he can ever imagine. He was beautiful and handsome any word that would be a synonym for drop-dead gorgeous that's what this man was.
Her voice was quiet. Almost like she didn’t want to admit it out loud.
They sat on the hood of the impala, eating and talking, as the sounds of the waves crashing to the shore mixed with la musica norteña coming from inside the car. Dean soon finds out that Cas doesn’t know how to dance, so he puts on one of his favorite mixtapes, and cumbia plays loudly through the speaker.
After that, Jack stayed in Cas’s arms for a while until Dean convinced him to climb some rocks with him. Jack quickly wiggled himself free to follow him while Cas yelled at them to be careful.
“Oh.” Cas looked down at Dean’s lips as he talked. “I can-I can do that.”
Something in the way her eyes went cold and far away made his fight drain out. He didn’t know what else he could do or say, but he opened his arms just in time to have her fall against him. His face mushed into her curls while he hugged her tight into his chest.
“Ah, reminds me of that whoopee cushion prank you did on me.” Cas noted as he took a sip of beer.
“But now?” Cas was sitting across from Jack, eyes never leaving his son while his hand reached over to take his hand. “You don’t think you’re needed at this age anymore?”
“Jack gifted me the shirt.” Cas shrugged and then walked to stand by Dean to look down at the map. “Now where do you believe the nest is?”
“It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, Dean, I-” Cas was interrupted when Dean pulled him from his shirt collar and kissed him. Cas tasted like peppermint. His lips were warm and chapped. Dean has never knew anything more real than Cas.
Dean turned towards the voice and saw Jack sitting up, looking at him with round warm eyes. A small smile playing tugging at his lips.
“I didn't know you meant it like...like that.”
“Whatever. I’m not making you pancakes anymore, Miracle.”
Dean crashed their lips together, unable to help it as he stepped forward to make the space between them disappear. His hands on either side of Cas’s face hold him in place until he felt Cas’s hands on his waist and kissed him back. Lips gliding together softly at first before Cas pulled back to look at him, confusion mixed with the stars in his eyes,
Dean looked in the review mirror to see Jack and Cas both looking out their windows, both developing the nervous tick of playing with their necklaces absentmindedly while they both looked like they were ready to pass out any second now. Cas nightmares have been getting worse, but he still wasn’t talking about them. Sometimes he won’t even have a chance to fully wake up before he had Cas’s whole weight on him, clinging to him as if he was scared Dean was about to disappear. While Jack has been feeling drained. He hasn’t really talked much since waking up human, but Dean could hear the kid walking around the bunker in the middle of the night. Sometimes Dean would find Jack passed out on the kitchen table with a bowl of cereal by his head.
“Ay, mi Angelito, he didn’t say it in a mean way. It’s just the way we talk to each other. He’s my friend.”
A cameraman sat in the back seat of his car and Dean warned him to not leave a scratch on her. He was alone in the car so that's when the cameraman started to ask him how he was and to speak to the camera so Dean did just that. He spoke looking down mostly and shrugging his shoulders a lot as he even scratched the back of his neck talking about the nerves he has but that he was excited.
Dean just shrugged picking up the empty milk cups and going over to the sink to wash them. "I don't know. I thought it was obvious."
"You don't get it, Dean."
The tightness in Dean’s chest returns as he looks back at his kid.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas felt his body go cold as his arms sagged to his side. His eyes dropped as tears mixed with the blood on his face.
Husband.
They smiled against each other’s lips as they started to kiss again. Slow and soft.
Cas’s eyes dropped closed for a second, his head turning into Dean’s palm, and relaxing into it. Dean let out a shaky sob as a result of witnessing something he never thought he would see but here they were. Alive. Together.
Cas grinned, a small laugh shook his body and Dean felt every shake that was in his arms. “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
Everyone else came in next along with his best friends Charlie and Benny. They all excitedly got ready and looked pretty for the cameras that Dean keeps forgetting are there. He was jumpy and pacing the room most of the time as he drank some cold water to keep him from burning up in this damn suit.
Cas couldn't take his eyes off him and he tried his best to control himself and just pay attention to what the minister was saying but all he can think about is how those green eyes may look in the sun. He couldn't believe this man actually is marrying him right now. This must be some dream.
made a face at that, not answering quickly enough before he said, “Just bring her home.”
He looked at his wall for a full minute before he convinced himself to sleep in Cas’s space. To use his boyfriend as a pillow and hold him until he could lull himself back to sleep. When he slowly turned around, careful not to wake him, he found Cas’s side of the bed empty.
“Because I bought you that shirt! I should be the one taking it off!” Dean said a little too loud and the dinner got quiet. Dean quickly takes out his wallet and puts more than enough money to pay for their food before walking out. Cas quickly follows behind him, carrying his trench coat in his arm and looking so human.
“Dean,” Cas says again but his voice went deeper than usual, more stern.
"You sure?" Dean asked once again and Cas nodded, happy to get rid of his family's name. "Then that settles that. Wow. We are good at this marriage thing already."
Cas leaned into him a little more, untucking his feet from underneath him so he could lay them flat on the ground. Dean noticed every fidget of Cas’s fingers and he wondered if Cas was uncomfortable with the closeness but then in a sudden move Cas had an arm around Dean’s shoulders. Cas cleared his throat as he squeezed Dean’s shoulder closer to him - trying to act like this was a normal thing for them- while Dean stared at him with wide eyes.
She repeated it, “Dude, where’s
Cas and Dean’s shared a worried glance just as Miracle started to cry at Jack’s feet.
She barked again before whining, understanding more of Dean’s tone, but sometimes he did wonder if she did understand his words.
Dean stood where he was griping at the vile in his hand. Easily he can break it in his grip and force the grace back into Jack.
You’re mine. Was what Dean wanted to say but instead, let Cas pull him back into a kiss. It was softer this time and not as desperate so Dean melted into it.
“Okay. I won’t give you a big speech, but I will say,” Dean sighed, and Cas tugged at his hips to get his attention again. “I
Dean was in the middle of emailing Garth back some pictures of Jack and Cas so he can make the IDs with the same last name and maybe have the same story when he heard a knock on his bedroom door.
He has a list of stuff he doesn’t enjoy, while the list has for things he does enjoy is currently blank. He can’t speak of his discomfort out loud; he also learned that pretty quickly because people won’t pay him, and he needed the money for food. Or at least enough for a night at a motel where he can just sleep in a bed all alone. Not to be woken up by a stranger telling him he had to leave or wanted something else from him when all Cas wanted was to be dead to the world. To dream of a life where he had a home. Had a family. Had somebody.
“Okay, enough of that.” Cas said walking Dean to a chair and sitting him down. “It’s time for breakfast since Sam won’t be here till this afternoon to open presents.”
Four years later and they are still married. Dean had surprised Cas with a big wedding after their one year anniversary. It was beautiful and in some fancy country club that Dean had to pretty much beg to get the date. On their third wedding anniversary, Dean and Cas announce they are adopting a child to keep the cat they have at home company.
“Please.”
“You do?”
“You know more than me.”
“Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. Let’s just finish this so I can go back to my homework.”
Dean nodded before he ran his nose up the side of Cas’s face until his lips were once again on Cas’s own. Tasting the saltiness of their tears mixed in with every kiss.
But is that what Dean actually wanted?
Cas didn’t say anything as his face scrunched up in a way he did to hold back his tears.
Thanks again for reading!
He should be scared. Esto no es algo que debería hacer con
Dean and Cas shared a look before Cas shook his head. “Dean was referencing a movie, Jack, but you feeling wrong in your body is a sort of human thing. Right, Dean?”
Dean forgot about his phobia about flying until he was in the airport and was shaking like a leaf. Cas reassured him, after they changed into more comfortable clothes in the airport’s bathroom, that everything was going to be fine since it was just a short flight to Hawaii.
date, Dean?”
It was only supposed to be a quick peck but Cas chased after him, sitting up as he let his hands reach to rest at the base of Dean’s neck. Kissing him again and again until they were both on their knees tugging at each other to get closer. Desperate for the touch they have been craving and holding back for so long.
“Jack thought it suited me.”
Cas’s smile grew, and his tired eyes lit up, “I would like that, Dean.”
He was about to take it as a rejection, and he had a speech ready if this did happen, but then Cas firmly ordered, “Put it on me.”
“Dude, just kiss him. Rowena said the pain was just gonna get worse until we figured out-” Cas loud groan as he hunched over in the back seat distracted them but then Sam finished. “Until we figured out the cure for the spell the witch put on him. A spell that should have hit you if Cas didn’t push you out of the way.”
Dean tried to sound as sincere as possible, talking soft and slowly so Jack could feel comfortable with him because all he wants is for the kid to look at him again with a real smile. Look at him without the fear that reflected Dean’s childhood self. He wants to try and be…good.
From the rearview mirror, he saw Jack crack a smile into his palm, and whoever can make his kid smile right now was getting a free dinner from Dean.
“And what is the first step?” Dean can hear Cas taking careful steps towards him.
Cas nodded as he placed a hand on the back of Dean's neck to pull him down for a kiss, hoping morning breath won't bother him like it wouldn't bother Cas. "Yes. Adorable."
Dean couldn’t find the words. He wanted to say some dumb joke or push Cas off but he stopped himself. Instead, he relaxed under the touch and leaned into it.
“Believe it or not, I was an asshole way before that.”
He watched as Cas pulled him into a tight hug before leaving a small kiss on his cheek, it was sweet, but Dean could still see Cas was hurting.
It’s been 11 days since Cas came back from the big empty.
“You are not
Sam was in the kitchen sharing a beer with Gabriel who just needed to answer little Cassie’s prayers.
“Cas.”
They somehow moved closer on the couch with every little comment Cas made. From the mention of yellow eyes. To ask what was put in Ralph’s mouth after he said fudge.
“You told him he was not
Dean holds his hand out to stop Cas from talking, feeling embarrassed with every word. “Para. You don’t have to explain. No me debes-you don’t owe me anything.”
He took deep breaths, not wanting to be angry or raise his voice, but these are things he kept pushing so deep into himself that acknowledging it will only make the levee of his stow-away crap spill. And he can’t have that. He had to stand strong. He had people that depended on him. He can’t be doing this. He can’t be sulking and drowning in his guilt when he should be focusing on Cas. On his new human son. On his brother. On Eileen. And he hasn’t even checked in with Donna or Jody this week.
“These are great, Cas.” Dean laughed looking down at his gifts. “Looks like you already planned our next date night.”
Thank you so much for reading and leaving such awesome comments!! I got way too many AU's - you can thank hyperfixation for that one - so I'll keep bothering you guys with my stories :)
“We think you opened this box and it had some sort of curse to take away your life slowly. Do you remember opening the box?” Cas asked as he lays Dean into bed.
“You could have hurt yourself! You know nobody here could have healed you, and Sam isn’t even home to treat you for your burn if you were to-oof!”
“Cause it wasn’t really you. It wasn’t really my life. Our lives fucking sucks but it will be annoying as fuck if we lived a perfect life all the time. I rather have these little moments.”
Dean shakes his head to stop him from arguing any further. He jumped back on his bike and looked back at Cas as he said, “You can get me something later. Is seven okay?”
Dean enjoyed the happiness and content look on his boyfriend’s face, considering he just came down from a panic attack because the hair clippers made a triggering noise for him, and he kept leaning down to kiss his face whenever he could. Loving the way Cas leaned into it and sometimes made such a happy sigh that Dean’s stomach did a flip.
“No!” Dean let his thumbs circle at Cas’s cheeks while he smiled fondly at the one person that grounded him and yet made him feel like he was floating. “I just…I missed you.”
"You think he may see you walking around and leave like in blind dates?" She teased and Sam laughed while he can even hear John laughing behind him.
They all got out of the car as soon as it was parked and started making their way through the parking lot. Dean talked to Sam about the food Eileen wanted when he reached behind him without thinking to ask for Cas’s hand. Well, ask isn’t right the right word if he just held his hand out, hoping Cas would understand.
“Oh, you guys made it!” Sam teased while Jack was practically beaming at them.
It was a beautiful afternoon, and even though they were constantly in each other’s spaces at home, Dean recommended a nice family walk with some fresh air. Leaving the bunker, even just for a few minutes, always brightened everyone’s mood, so he brought a football along and even packed a few snacks so they could stay at the park as long as possible.
“As a gift?”
And right now, that was enough for Dean. They’ll work on this. Just like they are working on everything else. And for the first time in a long time, Dean feels like this work may actually be worth it.
Dean turned his head so his cheek was resting on his arm while Cas’s fingers slowly hovered over his cheek and down the bridge of his nose. He sniffled just a little before he repeated Cas’s words back to him. “I wish I could heal you.”
Cas stayed stiff under Dean’s arm as they ordered and waited for their food. Eventually, Dean couldn’t help himself; the street light and the neon sign were the only things keeping this place lit, but it was still pretty dark, so he turned his face to press his nose against Cas’s temple.
He hid his face in her curls, not knowing how to face another kid
Cas laughed, deep and warm, as he hugged Jack back. “Fine. Fine. You are forgiven, Jack.”
“Dean.” Cas pouted as he scratched Miracle behind her ears. “Apologize. You made her sad.”
"You told me you hated snickerdoodles!" Cas smacked Dean on the shoulder.
“His present is coming tomorrow.” Claire said holding up her phone to show she was tracking the package.
“It feels…awesome.” Cas tested the word and Dean laughed before he pulled Cas in for a fresh clean mouth kiss. Cas is getting used to this, used to Dean, fairly quickly. He really liked it and he was really scared.
“No, I was just-” Cas started but then Dean grabs a hold of Cas’s bags. “Dean?”
It wasn't until the camera appeared in front of them that he remembers once again that he was being recorded but he tried his best to ignore it as he turns to look at Cas when they are alone.
When they got to their room, it was a huge one-bed honeymoon suite filled with candles, flowers, a bathtub with rose peddles around it, and a view of the ocean on the balcony, and the first thing Dean does, after the bellman leaves their luggage in the room, was to turn to the cameraman who walks in the room with them.
A scraped knee later, from Dean, they were heading back home. They detoured for a quick burger and nuggets, but Jack was already falling asleep halfway through his meal. So Dean ate the rest of his food with a sleeping kid on his lap, one free hand to eat his burger and eat the rest of Jack’s nuggets while Cas smiled at him.
“Stop it.” Cas sounded annoyed by the teasing.
Even if they were the wrong people to talk about liking yourself. Pretty sure Eileen — fuck, maybe even Sammy — was the most okay person in the head in this room. Though, Miracle beat them all by a long run.
“Dean.” Dean was fluffing his pillow when he looked up to meet Cas’s eyes, he was already laying on his side of the bed, because he has that now, while quietly watching him with soft eyes. “Remember to keep the lamp on.”
Before Dean can open his mouth to apologize — because, of course, he didn’t mean it — Miracle whined again before running from Cas’s reach.
“Dean,” They heard Jack call out, and they both turned towards the voice. “Can I also get a haircut?”
“Take it.” Dean dropped Cas’s arm and took the few steps forward to grab Cas’s face in between his hands to press a hard stiff peck against his lips. This was still so new, his heart-stopping for just a panic-filled second, but when he pulled away to look at Cas, eyes closed with such a content expression, Dean felt like he was brought back to life. Again.
A chill ran up Dean’s back when he finally pulled away, and Cas’s heavy breath tickled his lips.
"Two years! Why didn't I ever know?"
Dean didn't know if the picked a guy or a girl for him since he wrote in the application that he is bisexual. He may have also stayed in the shower longer since he could hear the camera crew starting to show up and Bobby was already yelling about how crowded the house was getting.
Since coming back,
He eventually got him back to bed, but he only slept for another few hours before he got up again, saying he was hungry now. Dean couldn’t go back to sleep, so he was up at 6 a.m. making breakfast for his sleep-deprived —they haven’t talked titles yet, but boyfriend seems fitting even if feels like he was already married to the guy— boyfriend.
When Dean calls for Jack, he expects to look up and see his 20-ish looking kid, but instead, he hears squeaking yellow crocs before he hears a little voice respond with, “Did you call me, Dean?” And Dean looks down, reminded once again that the Jack they knew was gone, and Dean was left shuffling on his feet knowing damn well that he wasn’t going to ask this little four-year-old for help with research.
Cas turned to look at him again and his eyes were watery, taking Dean back to that sudden goodbye. And like before he was smiling.
“Oh, yeah. Um—Jack. You meet him too.”
“So what?” Dean sat down on the chair at the end of the table to be between them, be close, while he put the cups in front of them. “You feel like you have some kind of Benjamin Button disease?”
“Dean.”
Is it a date? Does Dean want it to be a date? Fuck. He really does.
“Don’t worry about it. Just bring the drinks.”
Sam held back a laugh, tried hiding it in a cough but Dean saw right through his dumb grin. “Wow, you know if you need a break I could always step in.”
It was hour five of watching an unconscious Cas and he rolled over once but didn’t make any other indication that he was waking up soon. Not until now and he groaned while he started to push himself up so he could sit. He held his head in between his hands for a second, muttering to himself something in Enochian, before looking around the room. His eyes wandered to the sleeping Sam and then fell into Dean.
“But why?”
Cas cleared his throat. “Was that my Christmas gift?”
"Night Cas."
“I wanted to ask earlier, but I think we will both be more comfortable in private.” Cas dropped his hand so he could slide his hand up to Dean’s arm before he took hold of his shoulder. “I never knew how…
“Dean! You scared me!” Cas said as he put the spatula down and turns down the fire before turning to Dean with a grin he has never seen on his Cas. Dean loved it and couldn’t help but reach to lay a hand on Cas cheek. “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
changed his phone background pic to one of Claire spinning Jack around in the living room.
“Didn’t know you care so much about me, Cassie.”
It wouldn’t be the first time that Castiel was left for dead–shit, it wouldn’t be the first time Castiel wished someone would actually finish the damn job and kill him already–but this time, he woke up inside a dumpster wrapped in a bloody bedsheet. It was a new one for him, but his first thought was his duffle bag.
Cas opened his arms, and Dean hesitated for a second before taking Cas’s offer and fell into him. Knocking them both back into the bed as they stayed watching the cement ceiling reflect stars from Cas’s night light.
“Okay, well, you better get your Christmas sweater on before Dad gets all fussy about it.” Claire said with a smile as she started to walk away but then she ran back towards Dean and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “Merry Christmas by the way.”
“I’m sorry.” Dean knew those words did nothing to comfort, but he couldn’t help but say them. “I’m so sorry, Claire.”
Luckily Rowena called again after Dean got out of the bathroom, not to mention Cas jumped him as soon as the door swung open. “It’s an easy curse to lift, lucky for you boys. So I’ll be there in a few hours. Don’t have too much fun without me.”
“I did.” Her tone didn’t change, not giving anything away about what Cas could have possibly talked to her about in his hour with her. “Who else lives with you?”
“Jack, no.” Cas sounded so sad that Dean barked out a laugh as Cas turned to pout at Jack.
Pero Dean always had one customer that always came running out whenever Dean came around, and he was worth the extra minutes he had to petal in the hot sun.
Cas was too tense as he demanded Amara to leave his son’s body and thought an angel blade was enough to convince her to listen, but she held her hands up to show she meant no harm. Explaining that she wanted out as much as they wanted her out but cared too much about Jack to see him suffer in the process, so she’s currently helping Sam and Eileen with research.
“Anytime, buddy.” Dean pressed a kiss to Cas’s hair before he squeezed him once and pulled away to look at him. He reached over to cradle Cas’s face, watching the soft smile on his boyfriend’s lips before meeting his gaze. “Now, after my session today, maybe you and I can take Jack somewhere? Maybe we can rent a boat and go fishing for the afternoon.”
Dean grabbed a chair and sat down in front of his Dad and took his shaking hands. "You okay, Dad?"
“Then that’s what matters. That you are changing, you are breaking this…this damn cycle, and you
A family. Yeah.
Cas was confused by that and without thinking, he said, "Why don't you sleep with me?"
There was a quiet pause again before he heard Gabriel.
He really didn’t want to see that but it looked like Cas only kept his eyes on him. Even with Sam holding his shoulder down, Cas kept his glare on him. That is until Rowena said some spell that made Cas’s eyes roll to the back of his head and then collapse.
Dean petals a little bit faster until he breaks in front of the pretty face he sees at least three times a week.
Tonight was one of those nights.
Cas finally pushed Dean's hands off him and went to sit down on the bed of the motel they were staying in. Cas put his face in his hands as he let his shoulder drop, he couldn't even look at Dean as he admitted to himself what he was feeling.
Cas only looked at him for a few seconds, giving him one of those sad smiles, before his eyes rolled to the back of his head, and he was falling.
“You dreamed about monsters?”
had a yelling match in the privacy of the backyard. Well, Claire was yelling while
“Cas?” He called out to him again as he stepped into the doorway.
They haven't really talked much and he wanted to talk to Dean on the plane but he rather not have Dean continue panicking. He knew the camera was on him but he tried to ignore the cameraman as much as he can but then he started to ask questions.
Dean starts walking again, and Cas quickly catches up.
Then as soon as those words were out of his mouth, Cas decided to fill Dean’s mouth with his tongue. A moan giving Dean chills as Cas’s hands working on undressing him.
Cas looked back at him and his face seemed to relax. “You do?”
Maybe he could start with his own guilt.
Dean goes to therapy and he hates it.
If Jack wasn’t ready to hear his shit apologizes and excuses, then Dean wasn’t going to pressure him on it. He wanted to give the kid some space, too, but he also didn’t want to give him the impression that he was keeping his distance from him or didn’t want him around. Fuck, this was all giving him a headache now.
“So does this mean you two are staying married?” The host lady, Dean should have really learned her name but he doesn’t care enough to do so. Instead, he nodded.
with; he wants to remain useful. To you. Specifically.”
“Yeah. Yeah, Cas.”
“I wasn’t—I wasn’t the nicest to the poor kid. I was more like my old man than I ever wanted to be. Maybe even worse.” Fuck, Dean never thought he would say those words out loud. His guilt being front and center while Mia only stared at him, eyes curious and waiting. He sighed as he dragged his hand down his face again, letting his fingers comb through his beard. “He’s Cas’s kid, and I—I love him like he was my own. I’ll die for him, but I fucked up with already. I did unforgivable things.”
Claire’s angry fist collided with his chest. He flinched at every hit but didn’t back away as her punches became sporadic but still filled with grief. Maybe even guilt.
“S’okay.” Dean breathlessly responded as his fingers found their way to Cas’s hair.
They were a real family.
“I’ll  always come back to you, Cas.” Dean promised as he reached grab Cas hand and give it a small squeeze. Cas smiled as he looked at there hands before holding tightly to Dean’s hand.
“No, Sam is just being an idiot,” Dean informs Jack, who frowns, and Dean’s heart aches at the sight. “But we can have a game night tonight if you want.”
Jack didn’t say anything as he twirled his necklace in between his fingers. He hasn’t looked at Dean since they took Cas away, groaning in pain, an improvement to the screams they heard when he woke up in the car.
Alfie and him have been friends since they been seven and he only just got used to Cas strange ways. Gabriel and Balthazar have always been protective of him since Cas had always liked staying at their house when they were kids instead of his own and they were the first people he told when he finally decided to ‘come out of the closet’ as they say. Gabriel quickly jumped at the chance to set him up with someone he knew while Balthazar said he will join him at a gay club but if there are no good drinks than he's leaving.
“But he did.” Her voice sounded so far away.
“Oh, yes. I forgot.”
“Mmm.” Bobby hummed in reply, going back to turn off the beans once they looked how he wanted it. “Llévate a tu hermano.”
He stayed in the middle of the street, unsure of what to do until finally, the front door opened, and Cas stepped out with a jacked hanging on his arm. He stood outside and squinted at the car before tilting his body down to check if that was Dean.
“Fine!” Sam turned around in his seat but Dean shoved him away from a groaning Cas. “What? You said to-”
“Is that a bad thing?” Dean does grabby hands to Jack, who quickly unhooks himself from Cas to go into Dean’s arms again. “I’m happy.”
He has been a little out of it since separating from Amara and losing his mojo, but nothing some good family time couldn’t fix. Or a good dog cuddle from Miracle who followed Jack around like a…well like sad little puppy. Jack was hesitant to leave her behind, but she wasn’t going to be allowed in the grocery store.
“I know Jack never ratted me out on how much of a dick I was when you…before you came back. When Jack was born, I mean, but if I have to admit this to someone, then I think it should be you.”
“I’ll, um, I’ll just - let me pick another one.” Dean reached for the remote and picked a random movie in the Christmas category and pressed play. Then he leaned back into the couch again and Cas’s arm was around him again.
Amara and Dean have a talk about Jack.
Those are the words Dean wanted to say to Cas, but if he didn’t believe them, how can he even say them. Instead, Dean stood behind Cas, a hand stretched out to lay on top of Cas’s shoulder in solidarity while they watch Sam and Rowena perform an ancient and risky spell. Eileen was standing along the sidelines with them as Jack stood in the middle of the library’s floor.
“Yes, I saw that,” Cas said and then Dean felt the familiar tingle of grace flowing through him. Dean looked down at his clothes to notice they were both cleaned up.
Dean's eyes widen with fear as he thought maybe Castiel would leave now but luckily he didn't move instead told the minister to continue. "Unless you want to-?"
Jack frowned, looking down at the ground with knitted eyebrows, before looking back at Dean with tired eyes and a half-ass smile. “No.”
They all stared at the giant green box on the floor with the lid holding a giant red bow that looked professionally wrapped.
“Dad?” Dean hears from behind him and looks up the staircase to see Claire wearing a Christmas sweater and drying her hair with a towel. “What are you doing?”
Dean drives Cas back home. While the old feelings just sink deeper into him.
Sam was right he did not give a single damn about anything right now cause all he wanted was more of whatever the hell was going on. Cas pulled Dean on top of him, straddling the angel as Cas hands pinned his waist down. Their lips and breaths becoming more desperate as Cas muttered, “More. Dean. I need more.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We like married life.” Cas finished for Dean.
So Cas gives him the exact change to the quarter and smiles sadly before he waves goodbye. Dean waves back as he gets on his bike to pedal out of this neighborhood and into a more comfortable one. He didn't ring the bell until he was out of there.
So Dean folded his arms over Cas’s chest and looked down at him. He could feel the dumb smile on his mouth. “Merry Christmas, Cas.”
“I get why you’re mad, Claire. Trust me, I do, but he’s back now.”
“Dean.” Cas rolled his eyes as he took Dean’s hand off his cheek and glared at him. “This is serious. You promised you would give this a shot.”
“I’ll be right back.”
“Why? He’ll be out most of the night. Might as well do this now before he wakes up. Come on now.”
“Sam charmed it, so it’ll keep you safe from demons since we haven’t gotten you or the kid inked up yet. Um, Jack got one of my old bracelets, but I figured you’d want something to twirl around your neck.”
"He seems very nice and easy-going. I hope we do get along but, no, he isn't someone I thought I would marry. Or well to say it correctly he wasn't someone I thought would marry me." Cas said as he looked down at his sleeping husband. He knew Dean could do better and it won't take long for him to figure it out just like Cas has.
“It’s okay. We can take care of him together now. As a family.”
He was not ready. No, he wasn’t ready to cross that line with Cas just yet. He loves the man, and whenever the rare instance happens when they kiss, he feels like he’s about to combust out of pure joy, but he can’t - he doesn’t know how…He’s not ready.
That morning was a bit rough, considering they all had their appointment with Mia via skype. So Dean just wanted some peaceful R&R before tomorrow when they will be helping Sam with a few cases and the hunting network he is creating with Garth.
“I love you.” Dean leaned in and pressed a kiss to Cas’s cheek, hearing the shocking breath he took, before turning to really look at Dean. He took a fistful of Dean’s shirt, pulling him closer, as his squinty eyes looked him over, looking for something before he relaxed. Finding it.
“Well, you are my older brother. So, of course, I do. Even if you insist on calling me that.”
“I am.” He shoved the man’s hands off of him. “My apologies, but I must go.”
On the drive back,
“Probably admitting to everything.” He shrugged, but he thought about it a little more. “I make too many damn excuses for John. For myself. He was going fucking crazy when he lost Mary, and I was…I was maybe going a little crazy when I lost you. So we took it out on the closest thing to them.” Dean looked up to meet Cas’s eyes. “To you.”
“Get off me, boy, you're choking me.” Bobby was muffled by Dean’s arm and Dean lets go of them to look at them. Bobby huffed and fixes his shirt before patting Dean’s shoulder, “Merry Christmas, son.”
followed behind her, watching as she walked straight past the living room and towards the front door. “Claire. Claire, where are you going?”
Dean leaned in a pressed a soft kiss on Cas’s lips. His heart racing while thinking of them being in the middle of the grocery store, but when he pulls away to see Cas blink his eyes open, them so bright and sparkling with soft love, all that initial panic melts away.
Sam came in fifteen minutes later with Jess in one hand and sodas in the other but since Jess is here that means Ellen is here and that meant Dean won't be able to drink that Mountain Dew Sam's holding.
Castiel hated when gravel dug into his skin. He always insisted on doing whatever they wanted somewhere private, but this person wanted it outside while promising to pay twice as much, so he didn’t say no. Fighting the disgust he felt inside at being out in the open. The full moon finally out to shine a light on his hideous act.
“So what if he kisses me. I’m fine with it. It’s not like it means anything.” Sam shrugs as he sits on one of the chairs and opens his laptop. His huge hand trying to cover the dumb smile on his face while Dean glares at him.
me to be. This is how I needed to look so I could help. I understood that.”
Dean played with his name on his lips and grinned as he said, "Nice to meet you Castiel."
“Then what do you want to talk about?”
Jack looked between them, trying to focus, and when he opened his mouth to answer, no sound came out. Instead, Jack’s eyes watered before he threw himself at his Dad, almost knocking him down before he cried into Cas’s shoulder.
“Sure, buddy,” Sam smiled and turned in his seat once again.
“I didn’t even get you anything, Cas.” Dean started saying, hesitant to get the present.
Maybe he should have cooled it with the cumbia, making it too obvious that Dean was in a good mood because as soon as he was heading out the door—smelling great, he may add—su Tio called him over to the kitchen.
“They even have you against me, princess?” Dean complained when his fifth attempt to kiss his boyfriend was a failure, but Cas did let out a beautiful deep laugh that shook his whole body. It made him look brighter. Angelic, even but he will
Cas blinked at him a few times before he fell back against Dean, his arms crossed over his chest. “Well, I don’t like it.”
Dean’s leg has been shaking nonstop since sitting down on the couch. He never thought he would be back to visit Mia, let alone come back to have an actual therapy session. It all started as a suggestion for Cas, who was doing better, sleeping a little longer, but was still dealing with phantom pain on his arms. Nightmares still woke them up at different times of the night, and one night Cas had even snapped at Dean, who was trying to help him back to bed.
Jack ended up sleeping with his head on Dean’s shoulder, Dean’s jacket laying on top of him like a blanket, while Dean talked to Sam and Eileen when they arrived. Luckily, his little brother took care of everything while Dean sat and waited for news on his boyfriend.
"You didn't even know what I was gonna say."
“Oh.” Was the only response he got from the angel.
Dean pulls out the amulet necklace that Sam gave him as a kid. He knows that maybe the chain doesn’t mean much to Cas— he probably hates it considering Chuck and all that shit—but it was all Dean could get his hands on last minute.
Porfa, to excuse my bad spanish again. I am not getting a beta for this fic since I am dumb so perdon. Pero, gracias de leer <3
“I don’t know, but like you said before. Two fuck
“Amara.” His voice didn’t sound as threatening as he wanted it to sounds. No, he sounded like he was ready to beg.
Cas looked up at Dean as he answered and by the third week Dean kind of knew that he may have started to fall for Cas and his strange ways but they never said anything about it. Just the fact that they are still together now is enough for Dean. The fact that Cas understands that Dean has to work for the money that is really needed and that Sunday family dinners are mandatory is what Dean looked for in a person and luckily that person was Cas. Luckily Cas even liked going to those things and spending his breaks in the Roadhouse or in the garage watching Dean work. Cas pretty much works from home but he sometimes has to show up at the office for meetings or whatever but besides that, they would spend each free second together.
“No,” Dean says, trying again to push himself up, using a different arm this time. He gets into a crouching position and then falls over, too dizzy to be entirely upright. Dean leans back against the curb and pulls one knee up, leaning his elbow on it and putting his head on his hand. Immediately, he pulls his hand away due to feeling something wet and sticky. When he looks, he sees bright red blood on his palm and leans over to throw up.
“Do you plan on telling him? About you—us?”
Sam nods. “And then—”
When he was a kid, Sam hadn’t even considered the possibility that he might go so long without seeing his brother. Even when he was at Stanford, he figured that they’d been through so much together, there was no choice but to keep in touch. He figured Dean would put in an effort. But in the end, Sam stormed out and didn’t look back. And Dean didn’t fight him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looks at him blankly. “I’m not doing this.”
“Why did you tell her we’re a couple?”
“Dean.”
“Sorry, why’d you bring Barry to school today?”
Cas gives Dean a look but Dean just shrugs his shoulders.
“Wow.”
“The hell are we doing here?” Dean asks as he climbs out of the driver’s side. He shuts the door with a little more force than necessary.
If it weren’t for them… Well, if it weren’t for them, Dean would still be in Hell and Sam probably would have followed not long after.
Dean’s grin only grows. “This is my brother Sammy. Sammy, this is Charlie,” he points to the woman with red hair, “and Dorothy, her girlfriend.”
“Really? What do you write about?”
Jack skips into the kitchen behind everyone and Sam follows, more nervous about meeting new people than what is probably acceptable.
“Night, Cas.”
“Oh, right, how could I forget you locking yourself in the closet.”
“I don’t believe you,” Sam says honestly.
“Come on… You two need to talk. Sam, you want him to be your best man. You should probably ask him about that sooner rather than later.”
“You don’t know Dean.” Sam replies with a wry laugh.
“I--uh, I hit you with my car,” the man says.
At first, all Dean can hear is a ringing in his ears. He’s not used to this kind of hangover and, hell, he doesn’t even remember drinking. In fact, he has no idea what the fuck is going on and he can’t see anything other than blobs of people above him.
“Wow, that’s impressive.” Dean felt his stomach flutter.
“When did you get married?”
When Sam is gone, Cas finally turns his head so that his cheek is resting on the pillow and h’s looking up at Dean. “I’m sorry,” Cas says.
“Only when I piss cas off,” Dean says, and he doesn’t look the least bit ashamed of himself.
“That’s awesome, Dean!” Sam grins. “I’m happy for you.”
“What’s so funny?” Dean asks with a smirk, angling his head so they’re looking at each other.
the weight,
“Get some sleep,” Dean says, sitting up. He looks down at Cas, whose eyes are already fluttering shut. “I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“You can sleep on the pull out couch,” Dean says when it’s just the two of them again. “It’s pretty comfortable, if I do say so myself.”
“That’s… that’s not all, actually. So my friends Kevin, Garth, and Andy are going to be the groomsmen but I didn’t want to… You can say no, obviously, but would you be my best man, Dean?”
Cas stays with Dean the entire day, through multiple tests and the gruesome setting of a broken bone in his wrist. It’s dark outside when everything is finally done and Cas helps walk Dean out to the parking lot.
Sam and Sarah are talking to Jo. Dean and Cas join them and Dean sees that his brother’s eyes are red, showing that he’s been crying too. Sam looks like he wants to say something, but he doesn’t. If he did, Dean would probably just brush it off and make a joke. Instead, they make small talk and smile fake smiles.
Cas pulls up in a rental pickup truck that makes Dean cringe as he’s being bitten by the hundredth mosquito of the night.
“It was okay. Awkward. He’s engaged to a real pretty lady.”
“I mean, Cas and I… we need each other. We’re dating. We’ve been dating for about two years  and I don’t know how you feel about that but if it’s a problem for some reason, take it out on me. Not him.” Sam just stares past his brother, waiting as the pieces in his head fit together. He’s taken back to the day he met Cas and the flirty waitress. And how clueless Dean seemed about her.
She slaps him in the chest, pretending to be mad. “I’d better get behind the counter or I’ll get in trouble, but it’s been nice seeing you both.” She says with a smile.
The little blue house on the corner of the street looks intimidating from where Sam stands on the sidewalk. Scary mysterious, something he has absolutely no idea how to face. He shakes his hands, flailing his wrists from side to side as if it will somehow make the rest of him stop trembling with nerves. In his entire twenty-four years of life, Sam has never encountered as much pain and grief as he has in the last few weeks. He knows he’s entitled to feel the way he does, but it doesn’t stop him from thinking he should be able to pull himself together.
So Sam waits, and he tries to prepare himself for something to say if Dean is the next one to come to the door. Will he send Sam away? Or sock him in the jaw? Or just slam the door in his face? He’s left for a few minutes, imagining and stressing all of the possible scenarios when the door finally opens back up and he’s face to face with Dean for the first time in years.
“Dude--”
“It’s a nice town.” Cas says, wiping a smudge of coffee away from his lip.
“So, Cas,” Dean says when he approaches. “I don’t know if you’re interested, or single, but I was wondering if you’d like to maybe grab coffee sometime?” He looks nervous--not we’re on a plane and ohmygod we’re going to die nervous--but nervous nonetheless.
“Hey, do you want a ride home? I’d be happy to drive you.”
“Cas knows shit about cars, so one day he brought his piece of crap continental into the shop I was working at. Turned out the engine was about ten miles from catching fire, so it’s a good thing he finally decided to get it taken care of.”
The room is silent for a few moments. The only visible light is coming from the lamp post outside, shining through the dingy curtain.
“If by ‘nice’ you mean having to make sure none of my siblings murdered each other at the dinner table, then yes. I suppose it was ‘nice’”
He hadn’t expected it all to be this bad.
“Oh, thank God you’re alright,” the guy above him says. He has dark hair and strong features and Dean wonders what the hell got him into this position.
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asks when they pull apart.
Cas rolls his eyes and simply flicks Dean in the temple, like it’s no bother.
Dean was trying. He was honest-to-God trying to focus but there was an annoyed clicking noise coming from the cute guy next to him and he couldn’t ignore it. He’d glanced over--more than once--trying to see what exactly it was that the guy was doing.
“Do you… do you take your hamster to school every day?”
“You’re a lot friendlier than the woman we sat next to on the last flight. She complained about me to one of the flight attendants and got her seat moved.” Cas snorts and Dean glares at him, but there’s no malice behind it.
Did he pass out? Shit, Sam is always getting on his case about his bad eating habits, maybe the last bacon-cheeseburger he ate was one too many. Apparently, you’re never too young to go into cardiac arrest.
“I’ll be back ASAP,” she says with a wink in Dean’s direction, but he’s already turned away.
Cas doesn’t hate flying. In fact, he loves it. He doesn’t do it often--doesn’t have any need--but when he does, he’s absolutely thrilled. So now, he should be buzzing with excitement, right? Except, not, because he’s flying back to Lawrence from his family Christmas in California. Not an ideal plane ride after a less than ideal Christmas.
“You didn’t bring a pie,” Dean says. “I asked you to bring a pie,” he frowns, pretending to be hurt.
“Well, Mary seems to be having the time of her life, so at least something’s going right.” Charlie said. She pointed to Mary who had gotten in the pool. It seemed as though she was trying to drown Ben, a boy who lived down the street. Cas chuckled as he watched Sam desperately try to get Mary off of the boy.
Sam is still holding out his gun in the way they were taught as children, looking around corners and inside closets for any sign of something wrong. When he sees Dean, he lowes his gun, though he doesn’t put it away completely. “Nothing?” Sam asks, mistaking whatever look was on Dean’s face as concern instead of complete and utter shock.
“We’ll just start with water, we’re waiting for people.” The perky waitress nods with a smile and leaves
“Maybe it was because I hated your car.” Dean answers, beginning to close his eyes again. Then the car stops, and the next thing he’s aware of is Cas leaning over him, already standing outside next to the passenger door.
Imagine the shock Cas got when he received a phone call early one spring evening from a man he didn’t know, telling him that Dean had been MIA for over a week and his whereabouts were unknown. Cas had fallen to the floor. Unsure of how to react at first, he stared blankly at his feet, hoping to wake up from the nightmare he had to have been having.
Sam was suddenly standing in front of Cas at the kitchen sink, forehead wrinkled in concern. “Cas?” He said, gripping Cas’s shoulders tightly. “Cas, talk to me, man.”
The flight attendant comes by then, asking if they want anything. While Cas settles with some water, Dean asks for some whiskey for himself. He winks at her and she blushes before handing over the scotch and pushing her cart forward. Yeah, definitely straight. And hopefully he’s not married, though Cas isn’t going to judge--flirting with a flight attendant isn’t the worst crime.
“John Winchester left no will, therefor you two, as his next of kin, are to decide how the funeral process will be handled.”
Suddenly intrigued by Dean, Cas has the urge to continue conversation with him. “So where are you headed?”
my tumblr: http://molls-winchester.tumblr.com/
Dean sighs, not really sure what the answer is. “I don’t know. I mean, I want him to know… but I don’t know how he’s going to take it. In New York, I was never really in the closet in the first place. I mean--”
They were supposed to be taking a test and normally, Dean was great at Calculus. Not today. No, today, the black-haired boy next to him was tormenting him, somehow. Dean was just about ready to fake a sickness to get out of the room when he watched the guy trying to discreetly move his hand down toward his backpack.
It’s virtually the same question Cas asked earlier, so the words “I didn’t want to be alone,” come easily.
“I know.” Dean says. He kisses Cas’s neck and then turns them around so that they’re facing each other. “What do you want to do today?”
“Yeah, it’s gonna be a thing. Don’t know what it’s going to be called, yet. It’s not a big--”
They carry on with conversation for a while longer before Dean drifts off again and Cas turns back to his book. Emma has ceased coloring and is laying her head on her dad’s shoulder, thumb in her mouth and eyes closed. Cas is genuinely impressed with her behavior.
“You have a family, Dean.”
“Then what is it? We’re on a time crunch, man. You know, missing kids and all.”
“Hey, Jo.” He says, returning the hug.
“How ya doin’, Cas?” Charlie asked.
“Mary,” he said.
“So you wanna go get some coffee? I told Jo we’d stop by and visit her at work.”
However, when Cas sits down and waits for the flight to take off, he soon realizes that the child isn’t going to be the one cause the problem. No, instead, it’s going to be the grown man sitting by the window. The child, Cas now realizes, is a roughly two-year-old girl, and she’s trying to calm down her dad who happens to be flipping out.
“Sort of,” he responds. “I mean, yes, in a sense. I’m an art teacher.”
Dean brings him the sheets and Sam makes himself a bed. He doesn’t bother checking his phone before going to sleep, knowing that there’s no one he needs to keep in touch with.
Cas hums in response but doesn’t say anything else, for which Sam is grateful. Any more conversation like this might prompt him to break down on the spot and that’s probably not the best way to impress his newfound brother-in-law.
Some people laugh, and when Sam glances back at Dean, they both do their best to act like they’re not crying. Cas doesn’t hold back though.
The kitchen is chaotic. There’s food everywhere and three tall, grown men skirting around one another. Sam loves it, and he finds himself laughing more than he has in a long time.
Dean takes to wiping the counter. “Jack decided he didn’t like his yogurt today,” he says. “Cas got him to eat it, but not before a tantrum, it looks like.”
“You ready to order now?” the same waitress from earlier asks, surprising Sam as he had not seen her approach.
“They were really cool,” Sarah says.
“Good job,” he tells her, when she takes his advice on not pushing so hard. She hands him another crayon without saying anything, and Cas takes it as an invitation to color along with her. The only familiarity he has with children as small as her is his nieces and nephews, most of which he’s not around very often.
“A snowball fight? Really?”
“You got soft,” Sam says matter-of-factly.
“I’m glad you sent this,” he says, flicking the postcard that’s still in his hand.
“So Dean, what do you do?” Sarah questions. For a moment, Sam wishes she hadn’t, thinking that maybe Dean is still running credit card scams and doing small odd jobs when the former doesn’t bring in enough money.
At the first sight of his brother, Dean whips one of his snowballs through the air. To his surprise, Sammy is more coordinated than he remembers because at the last second, the tall man drops to the ground and dodges the bullet.
Dean and Grace are, undeniably, winning the game. Of course, that doesn’t mean he isn’t freezing his ass of. His wrists are beginning to burn within the small area between where the gloves end and the jacket starts that leaves his skin bare. His face is drying out and he wishes he hadn’t passed the opportunity to get some proper snow gear like Grace or the other kids.
“Me and Cas.” The cool night air gives Sam a sense of Serenity and he looks out at the setting sun.
“Keep your lips for that angel of yours. I’ve got meetings to set up, plans to make, so enjoy your little vacation squirrel.” The other line goes dead before Dean can remind Crowley that he’s not on vacation, he’s here for his father’s funeral, but he doesn’t care.
“My mom used to tell me stories of angels when I was little.” Cas nods.
God, what was he going to tell her? A six year old should never have to fear that their father might be dead. What was he going to tell Sam? What was he going to tell his friends? How could he not get to say goodbye?
When he gets to Cas’s room, the urge to leave it be and walk away is strong. He shakes his head, takes a breath, and slowly pushes open the door.
“He’s coming home,” Cas whispered to no one in particular.
So about 30 minutes pass by and the entire family is going insane. There are no friends, only enemies. Sam and Jess have turned against each other, Ellen has destroyed the kids’ snow fort with a menacing grin on her face all the while, and Charlie has had to carry Jo, her pregnant wife, back to the porch multiple times thanks to how desperate the blonde is to fight.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about, I’m just here for some coffee.” He jokes, but it’s in good nature.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dean mutters.
The worst part had been Mary talking about her daddy like he was coming home any day now. She’d been like that since the beginning. This was the first tour where Mary had understood what was going on.
“Well, they’re about these two brothers who kind of fight monsters… I know it sounds cheesy when it’s put like that but it’s a lot creepier and… well, emotional than they seem… or so I’m told.”
“That’s so cool! I had no idea you were into film.” Sarah says, and honestly, neither did Sam. But it really does make sense. Growing up, Dean loved watching movies but it was more than that. He liked to learn about the actors, the directors, the sets and their purposes. He always was fascinated with the subject. “What are they like?”
Something about that, something about Cas thinking he’s expendable, really pisses Dean off. “Are you kidding?” he asks. He grabs Cas’s hands, using them as leverage so he can put his wait over Cas without actually straining himself. He gets closer and closer until his face is only an inch away from Cas’s. “You’re not going anywhere. Don’t you ever do something like that again, you hear me?”
Two months later, while the two are studying their calculus homework in Cas’s room, Dean is thrilled that his boyfriend brought that annoying hamster to class.
“Yeah, but you love me anyway,” Dean says, pulling the other man close.
“Charlie works with Cas,” Dean says. Sam nods, realizing he doesn’t know what Cas’s job is. Or Dean’s, for that matter.
Cas keeps saying things that make Dean chuckle, even though it isn’t his intention. “No, Emma’s mom, my wife, died during childbirth. And I’m not straight, I’m bisexual.”
“Cas did. I drove. Left as soon as I could so I wouldn’t have to fly on the plane.”
“I--yes, that would be nice.”
“Since you won’t let me call you an ambulance, I’m taking you to the hospital myself.” He closes the passenger door and moments later climbs into the driver’s side.
“I’m Dean,” the man says. “And this is Emma.”
“Right, sorry kiddo.”
Cas looks at him sadly. If John hadn’t moved them all over America due to his paranoia and obsession with finding whoever set the fire that killed Mary, they’d have stayed in Lawrence. And Dean would have grown up in a regular school doing regular teenage things. Cas is about to say something when Dean’s phone rings. It’s sitting on the table, facing up, and the screen is flashing “Mr. Crowley”
“Sam stop.”
Dean pushes himself up. “I’ll join you in a bit,” he says. He snakes his arms around Cas’s midsection. Sam tries to look away, but watching Dean like this, happy, it’s surreal.
Dean gets wind of a case near Akron; the place sounds familiar, so Sam looks into it and he just knows.
“Well I’m planning on teaching art, probably to high schoolers, so a little bit of both. I know a lot about famous art, though, because my dad’s an art dealer.”
He smiles.
“I didn’t either. But a lot has changed since the last time we were together, man.”
“We have another on the way.” Sam raises his eyebrows, pleading with Dean to elaborate without him having to outright ask. Dean gets a faint smile on his face. He probably doesn’t even know he’s doing it. “We found a surrogate. She’s pregnant. The baby should be here in January.”
When they say goodbye, it’s still awkward and Sam can feel that they need to resolve the tension between the two of them. He turns on his phone and scrolls through his contacts looking for Dean. He can’t find it at first, but then his eye catches on the word “jerk”. Sam smiles at that, chuckling quietly.
Before Cas can say anything, Chaplin Lafitte continues. “Sir, your husband was injured in a firearms explosion. He was taken to a medical center miles away from base, where he was in a coma. He was a regular John Doe until he woke last week and was able to give his name. We had assumed he was dead but had no grounds to declare him as such.”
John’s being lowered into the ground and Pastor Jim is asking everyone to pray with him when Dean decides he can’t take it anymore. He walks away and leans against a tree that’s far enough away so that he can’t hear what’s being said.
When the episode ends and the credits roll out, Dean excuses himself to go to the bathroom. Cas stays, because he likes seeing his boyfriend’s name printed in white font as the very last thing someone sees of the show: Created by Dean Winchester.
Cas sees him, notices his smile, and matches it with one of his own.“I’m so proud of you!” Cas whispers, pulling Dean in for a kiss as soon as they’re close enough.
“He’s asleep. Human. You were—God, you were right, Sammy.”
“He does.”
When Sam stands up to make his speech, however, Dean is ready for whatever sappy thing his brother has planned. And rightfully so.
When Sam looks back to his brother, he sees Dean watching Jack with fond eyes as he dances to the music. Cas, on the other hand, is watching Dean with the same kind of look.
“Do you have someone to take care of you while you’re still concussed? Perhaps a partner?”
Dean looks to Cas and rolls his eyes. “My films… Um, they’re being turned into a TV show.”
Cas closes his eyes and his lips turn upwards, reminding Dean so much of how he looked after he’d said goodbye. Dean has to look away.
“We’re looking for a Mr. Castiel Winchester,” the taller of the pair said. Cas didn’t move--he couldn’t move.
“Happy Christmas Eve, Dean.”
Sam can’t help the laugh that escapes his mouth. “This is great, Dean. I mean, seeing you like this, it’s—I’m happy for you.” Dean snorts a little, but he doesn’t deflect. He just keeps smiling.
Sighing, Dean relents and turns his head slowly so as to not upset his stomach in order to really look at the man. He’s built and strong-looking and Dean’s content with staying awake if he gets to keep looking at him. His lips are full, though they look chapped, and cheekbones are high. He’s frowning, but Dean can’t help but find that the creased lines on his forehead make him more attractive.
“I don’t know what to do, Cas. I just… I didn’t expect to cry. I thought I was fine, that I wasn’t going to care, but I care so much”.
It isn’t that Sam ignored the card. He’d more or less just forgotten about it. Or maybe he wanted to pretend it hadn’t shown up in the first place. It’s been years since Sam has spoken to his brother, even longer since they’ve actually seen each other. At some point, they just stopped making an effort.
“I’m a doctor,” the man says.
Slowly, he begins remembering things. His name, his history, his family. He remembers his confession and then empty taking him and the pure bliss he had felt for the first time in his existence. He’s never experienced anything like it before. Then again, he’s never loved anyone like he loves Dean Winchester before.
Dean beams at his husband as they enter the kitchen. He pulls Cas into another brief yet passionate kiss and then leans his forehead against the other man’s.
Dean is about to turn, to say something, he doesn’t know what, when a second thought occurs to him—in the entire time Miracle has been living with thim, Dean hasn’t been able to leave the dog alone for more than five minutes without him whining like a baby, but the bunker is dead silent. He says as much to Sam who was apparently thinking the same thing because he’s already pulling out his gun.
“I’m aware.”
And just like that, the guy ignored him for the rest of the period. Dean finally figured out the clicking was coming from the hamster, Barry, chewing on his grape.
“I didn't want to get in trouble.”
“Science Fiction… It’s--uh--slightly strange.”
“Squirrel, great to hear your voice.” The obnoxious man on the other line says.
But now he’s here, and Sam realizes this is what he wants. A family of his own, friends who will love him and his family, people to spend holidays with in absolute chaos. What he wants most, is his brother.
Dean pours water into one of the biggest glasses in the cupboards and follows Sam back to Cas’s room. He’s still there, sleeping soundly with Miracle at his side.
Just as Dean was about to say something like “whatever the hell it is you’re doing, you’d better fucking stop it”, he saw a tiny nose peek out of the guy’s pocket. The guy lightly tapped it and shooed whatever creature is in his pocket back into hiding.
After that, someone new is at the door nearly every five minutes.
“Wait, so I actually got hit by a car? I’m not just hungover?”
They wait for what feels like centuries when finally, finally, Dean hears his name muttered quietly and almost incoherent from where Cas is lying on the bed. He spins around so quickly he could have fallen if he weren’t so set on seeing Cas.
At first, it looks like a messy bed with piles of blankets and pillows. Then his eyes adjust to the light and he starts to make out the shape of a body, Cas’s body, lifeless under a heaping comforter.
“What do you do, Dean?”
Dean gets lost in the warmth of Cas’s lips which have yet to start freezing. This kiss is chaste--close-mouthed an innocent, but Dean finds that he never tires of kissing his husband no matter how sweet and romantic and chick-flicky it makes him feel. Dean grabs the lapels of Cas’s trench coat and pulls him closer, smiling into their kiss...
What if they were fighting? What if John was drinking? Who's making dinner? Who's going to help Bobby with the shop in the morning? Who's watching his baby? What if Ellen needs help in the kitchen? What if Jo needs help with the assholes who ride into town? What if-?
“Cool.”
She screamed in frustration until her punches weakened, and he was holding her. Then, finally, she fell against him, her face hidden in his chest as her grip tightened on his shirt.
“Exactly.” Cas winked at him.
“Dean?” He looked up to see Cas was focusing on him again, maybe a little far away still, but he was focusing on him. Eyes filled with tears but wide, almost like he was begging him. “Dean. Make it go away.
He leaned down to capture Cas’s lips again. A soft peck.
“I love you.” Cas said into his neck as the tears kept falling, he sniffled as he let out another broken. “I love you, Dean.”
Cas is married and his husband is not only a good kisser but he doesn't snore. Cas could see by the change of clothes that Dean was the bad boy type that everyone wants but he was kind, from what Cas has seen. He liked that Dean always ask permission to first kiss him and he always seems to ask Cas how he feels about things before they do it. He even carried all of Cas bags for him and explained the camera people to strangers by saying, "We just got married. I'm a lucky son of a bitch right?"
“He didn’t ask you to kiss him. Don’t be a perv, man.” Dean scrunched up his face in annoyance but that’s when Cas sat up again. “How about we find you a nice girl to kiss, Cas. How does that sound?”
“Tough shit. We could have had this conversation five years ago but you decided to drop me from your life.”
“Oh.” Cas stood up straight as he ran a hand through his overgrown hair; his clothes looked neat again, though. “I didn’t mean to make you think-”
"Mmm." Dean said as he tucked his face into Cas shoulder.
"Yeah, but who says I want to! Huh, Cas? Who says I want to go a single day without you? I need you, man!" Dean shook Cas when he looked away again. Cas didn't even bother using his strength to push Dean off, which he can easily do. "Talk to me, Cas!"
“Dean! I don’t know what that means!” Cas calls out to him.
He was already pedaling away when he heard someone call out to him. He hits the breaks half haphazardly, and the gallons shake on his cart, threatening to fall out. He was about to turn around, but then he realizes he hears footsteps running closer, and then he hears heavy breathing by his ear.
“Ew, Dads!” They heard Claire say and they pulled away to look at her trying to hide a smile. “Aren’t you two too old to make out like that?”
“Yeah,” Dean says looking up at Cas. “I thought you left it outside my door since it had a huge bow on it. I opened it and like a flash of purple smoke came at me and that’s the last thing I remembered.”
"Cas, looks great. Don't be an ass and get to know him okay?" Sam says as he hugs him goodbye.
"Sam, if you are gonna keep staring at us with that creepy-ass grin then get the fuck out," Dean said hitting Sam in the face with a dishtowel.
It’s probably not a good thing that Dean can’t remember the drive at all.
Hand holding is a big step. Especially when your boyfriend can’t pick up on cues.
Dean took a deep breath, ignoring the tightness that came with that action before he was walking toward the body. Towards the familiar trench coat. Towards the familiar pull that used to scare him but right now he was so happy to feel it again. He was running before he knew it and when he tripped, he only kept crawling. Desperate to finally have him in his arms again.
“You did something to her I just know it!” Cas mumbled but Dean ignored him. Even if it was true.
Cas just shrugged and put his hands up to the heater. “Thank you for waiting for me.”
“More.” Cas moaned against Dean’s lips as he took a hold of Dean’s collar and easily started to pull him into the back seat with him. “More. I need more.”
Dean doesn’t know how to answer that.
“Yes,” She sat back in her chair again. “But you can’t talk to Sam about these things, now, can you?”
"How are you feeling now that you’re married?" The man asked and Cas fought the urge to shrug and instead looked up to look at the camera.
“You aren’t coming with,” Dean mutters to him before begging Bobby again. “Tio, I’ll take Sammy with me tomorrow! Nomas hoy no.”
"We can talk about who takes whose name later." Dean tells Cas as the minister had asked how they wanted to be called but Cas shook his head.
“Invite her to dinner then.”
“You sure you want me to? I mean he looks pretty damn happy to me. Don’t you think, Samuel?” She nudged Sam who grinned back at her.
“What? I’m not gonna wait outside, Dean.”
“I didn’t know you were back. I didn’t know any of you-”
"Relax, Cassie." He heard Balthazar whisper to him. "You look great. Stop fidgeting with the damn tie."
Jack stood up in the cart, looking like he was ready to start surfing while grinning up at him. A wide toothy smile made his chest ache because he missed his son’s older smile, but also, it ached with the love he still had for him. This small child was
It was already late when Dean called Cas over to watch the movie. He was going to go with
, eyes wide filled with tears, but she still looked at him with a pained grimace. “Did you even think of me? When you were out there being a damn hero. Did you-Did you think of
Dean drove them home while Cas turned on the radio. Tapping his fingers on his knee to the beat of the music. Dean wondered how Cas would react if he just reached over and twined their hands together but instead he gripped the steering wheel tighter.
"And this is Sam and his munchkin girlfriend Jess. Don't let the smile fool you, she's evil." Dean warns Cas and that got him a punch on the shoulder from Jess and a bigger smile from Cas. His smile seems to grow after every introduction and when he got to his Dad he stiffened up. "Relax Cas."
“She doesn’t.” He assures his boyfriend with a little smile, but
“That’s why I’m asking now.” Cas looked back at him before he sucked in a shaky breath when his eyes fell into Dean’s lips. “As you say, I saw the chance, and I wanna take it.”
Dean can feel warmth tickle up his chest as he swallowed hard while he watched that twitch of a smile again. Cas retook a step towards him, baby blues never leaving his face as if to read every micro-expression on Dean’s face.
Dean comes back from the long drive with Cas in need of some comfort. Sam is there to finally get him to talk out his feelings and admit to things he has been pushing down.
It has been a little tense around the bunker because they still have not found a successful way to separate Jack from Amara, from the whole God power, without hurting him in the process or worse. Their last attempt ended with Amara taking the driver seat of Jack’s body to stop them from doing something that would have killed their kid.
Cas started to turn to walk away, but Dean grabbed his arm to keep him from leaving. “Dude, what is it?”
It was only the first few minutes when Ralph walked in with a full cowboy getup that Cas laughed and when he met Dean’s curious eyes, enjoying every second of that rare laugh. Cas pointed at Ralph and then him. “Dean that’s you.” He laughed harder as soon as the words left his mouth and Dean hit him with a pillow.
“I’ll go get you some water.” Sam walked out and leaving Cas and him alone.
Dean reaches to kiss Cas again but this time Cas ducked his head.
“Estas siego, viejo!” Dean walked over to the small mirror that hung on the wall. You can barely see yourself in it because of the Jesus painting on it, but it still worked. “I’m just going out with some friends.”
“Yeah. Yeah. Just let me handle this. You trust me, right?”
So, please tell me what you guys think? I would love to hear it! I love reading all your predictions too! Some of you are real close and it's exciting. While others made me wish I would have written that instead lol
“Yeah.” Dean gripped the table.
“I was dreaming. I think. Like what a djinn does. I been through this before but before I dreamed my Mom was alive and Sam was at school with Jess. Everything was normal. No monsters.”
“Dean, please.” Cas walked over to him and took his face in his hands. Dean noticed that Cas looked brighter, a little lighter, as he leaned forward to press a single peck on Dean’s lips. “Talk later. Leave now.”
“Yeah, Jack, as a family.” He tried to smile back as best he could, and before he knew it, he had Jack wrap his arms around him. Holding him in a tight hug. Comforting him.
He hasn’t thought of Cas in so long, forced those memories down, and shoved them away in the closet with the rest of him. Well until recently where he was happily dating men. Well, he wouldn’t say dating.
“Shh,” He felt Cas hands wrap around him. “It’s okay, Dean. Just ignore it and everything will be fine. Everything will be perfect.”
Dean heard a little whine, and he looked down to see Miracle looking up at him, nudging his leg with her nose until his hands reached down to pet her.
"We just got to get what you guys would do right now." The camera guy answers and Cas looks over at Dean who sighs with annoyance and turns to look at Cas.
“Dean, are you listening?” Cas waves a hand in front of Dean’s face. They were sitting at a booth at an old dinner, sitting across from each other with cold food on their plates. “You are the one that called me over.”
Dean finally looked up to see Cas’s red-rimmed and glazed-over eyes. He looked so lost that it made Dean want to pull him in to hold him but right now was not the time.
“Yeah, um, how about when I’m done with this,” Dean motions to the scattered books around him before smiling back at the preschooler. “We get some ice cream and head to the park?”
A few heartbeats later, Dean finally sighs, “I just want him to be okay.”
Mira. No se. I just know I needed to post this cause I had it for a while so I can motivate myself to finish cause the fandom has been a lot lately aka j2 breaking up and the spn revival. Gonna finish the next and maybe last part this weekend so yay! Hold me to it!
Dean’s stomach drops. That’s worse.
“Dean, your food!”
"Of course. He is very handsome." Cas smiled and the cameraman smiled back as he gives him a thumbs up.
, his childhood Christmas movie he watched with Dad, but Dean had a feeling that Cas wanted a movie where it was actually about Christmas. So he picked his other childhood Christmas movie.
“Quick kiss?” Cas asked, he sounded in pain and it hurt Dean to see him with a pained smile.
Jo laughs as he hugs him back. “Back at you, old man.”
“Dean!” Dean heard Charlie call out to him and then she was by his side, pushing a warm brownie into his arms. “I got you the corner piece like you like. Now you should hurry back to work before Bobby comes in here looking for you.”
She didn’t stay after that.
"And you, Dean."
“I love my Mom.” Dean marches to her this time. Looking her over to make sure she was listening to his words. “And I hate her so much, but I love her. And now, because of you, I lost her twice. I lost the Mom I thought I had all over again. And I lost Mary.”
He flipped the phone open, and the light of the cell hurt his eyes but he blinked a couple of times until he could read the screen. He had eight missed calls and ten text messages waiting for him.
It was dark out already so Dean was now worrying about the sleeping arrangements.
Cas pulled away but before he was too far away he left a small kiss at the corner of Dean’s lips. Sharing a small smile, apologetic and reserved, with Dean before helping him off the metal bed.
Well, that’s what he would like to think he would have done, heck maybe a long time ago he would have done just that, but now it’s different. He hasn’t gone to a bar looking to hook up with anyone in years and he wasn’t going to start now. After throwing excuse after excuse at himself about why his libido just went into a downward spiral, fighting God and all that shit really wasn’t a good excuse for him apparently, it all came down to one angel. Well, person now.
“If I could still, maybe every once in a while, ask for a kiss? From you.”
“Sure, Angelito. Anything you don’t like?”
Dean stopped pacing and turned to look behind him to see Cas standing at the doorway. His blue eyes were still red-rimmed from his earlier session, and Dean quickly rushed to him.
Cas didn’t say anything for a few seconds, and Dean wondered if he said the wrong thing again, but then Cas clicked his tongue before turning to Dean. “I don’t know what…um, that word you said means. Que..que-?”
Dean was heading out with Eileen to fix her car that broke down along the way while Cas and Sam stayed back to test out another theory to separate Jack from Amara again. He wasn’t going to be gone longer than an hour, he was also going to pick up dinner with Eileen, but it would be the longest he would be separated from Cas since he came back. They both knew it, but Cas couldn’t leave Jack right now, and Sam was the only witch in the family who can properly do the spell, so Dean had to leave.
"Time to get this show on the road," Dean said as he drove out of the driveway and towards to hotel where he would be getting married to a stranger.
“It’s going to be okay. I get it.” Jack stood up, and without looking back at Dean, he muttered. “I need some air.” And began to walk away.
Hello! I did promise a second part and now I will promise you a third because apparently, I am writing chapter fics now. I didn't plan it but here I am.
Sam turned to Dean with a carrot sticking out of his mouth a smile stretching over his lips. "Thanks again for helping me out again, Dean."
“Hi.” Cas looked a little shaken up, and Dean just wanted to lean closer to leave a kiss on his cheek, but he restrained. No necesita mas chisme circling around about him. “I’m Cas.”
“Just come here already.” Dean pulled at Cas’s hand, and without using his words - because how can he possibly ask Cas to cuddle with him - he maneuvered Cas to sit between his legs. Cas kicked off his shoes as his back gently fell against Dean’s chest.
Dean thought while a smile spread across his face.
“Dad? Dean?” They heard the quiet voice and then felt the familiar brush of Miracle knocking against their feet. “Is everything okay?”
"Shut up, Sam, you know this a big deal for me."
“Nope!” He heard Sam say as Dean easily lets himself be pulled into the backseat with the angel. “I’ll wait in the..you don’t care.”
“No.” Cas made a disgusted face but then groaned. “Sam, if you are willing to kiss me can you please?”
Jack explains to his family that he feels uncomfortable in his body.
“Cas, it was an old ugly green colored Datsun.” Dean turned to look at him and Cas didn’t say anything and instead looked back at the host. Dean did the same.
"Are you at least attracted to him?" The man asked and Cas nodded as he looked up.
“I know. I know, Dean, but I just couldn’t handle your rejection.”
Maybe he should call them.
Dean reaches to press his palm on his boyfriend’s cheek, and that grabs his attention. Cas raises his head just enough to look back at him, the small smile was heartbreaking, but Dean had to use his words. He had to find the right ones so Cas can know exactly how he feels. How scared, lost, and alone he felt without Cas.
“I’m done talking to you!” Claire slid the glass door open and stormed through the living room.

Dean couldn’t finish his sentence while looking from Amara to Jack, watching as she looked herself over and then slowly lifted her hand, ready to snap. He flinched at the sight, and her eyes landed on him before her fingers…The echo of her snap felt hallow in his chest, but everything still looked normal. The lights turned back on in the bunker, and Dean could finally see the ashy remains around Cas’s eyes.
“Then why did you-?”
“Damn right I do!”
Dean laughed knowing that his little brother did, and probably still doing, a lot of research about aromantics since Dean came out to him. Sam probably knew more than him.
“Jess took her back to the house when you weren’t opening the door, what the hell happened?”
“You smell like cigarettes,” Cas states once they’re in the musky one-bed-bedroom.
“Nope. It might never come.”
“Maybe you should ask him about it, make sure he’s okay?” Sarah suggests.
“Admit what?”
Charlie’s head whips around so fast to face Sam, he’s half surprised her neck doesn’t crack. She gasps, loudly, and beams. “Sam!” she shouts. With that, she hurries toward him and pulls him into a hug similar to the one she gave Cas. “I’ve heard so much about you,” she says. Then she looks at Dorothy, arms still wrapped around Sam.. “I can’t believe I’m finally meeting the famous Sam Winchester,” she whispers, loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.
“Well, I guess I can probably work my busy schedule around this business. It might take some persuading, though…”
“So is there a way for us to see your movies?” Sarah asks, mouth full of food. Dean looks to Sam and smirks, no doubt thinking about the times Sam yelled at Dean for doing the same.--talking with his mouth full.
They sit there like that, exploring this thing that had always been there between them, for what feels like hours. Sam doesn’t come back so Dean makes a mental note to thank him later.
“Why wouldn’t I be alright? What the hell happened?”
“Did you have a nice time?” Dean asks. Cas laughs.
“So is Dean, though he refuses to admit as such.” Cas deadpans. He takes a sip from his drink and then continues. “He often forces me to have Star Wars marathons, regardless of having seen them multiple times”.
“Drink this,” Sam says, holding it out for Cas. Cas obeys, downing the whole thing in one go.
“I think this means you lost, baby,” Cas says, a faux face of sympathy strewn on his face.
He groans, trying to sit up, when someone’s hand lands on his shoulder. Dean has to focus, hard, but he sees a man standing above him, concern lacing all corners of his face. Dean struggles, trying again to push himself up. He can’t, though, because something is wrong with his right wrist and it hurts when he pushes on it.
“Cas, what--” Sam began wearily.
Sam finally drops his defensive stance and tucks his gun into the back of his pants. His fae is suddenly the of the hopeful little kid Dean once knew. “What?”
Dean exhales with a dramatic sigh. Cas stands with his hands gripping Dean’s shoulders, the pair underneath a buzzing light outside the motel room. It’s dark since it’s nearly ten-thirty at night, but Dean’s not tired. He’s about to tell Cas he’s fine, to lie about it, but he remembers that it’s Cas. He can’t lie to Cas.
The rest of the fighting ceases and Dean has to hold his breath as the man approaches the battleground. Dean slowly backs away from the other man’s glare until he’s standing behind his daughter, who will hopefully understand the unspoken command and stand guard for her fellow soldier.
“I’ve missed you, man,” Sam says.
The woman laughs at loud, and Dean finds it in him to somehow be offended.
“Do you see this?” the man looks at Cas, exasperated. “She thinks it’s funny.”
“That’s not what this is,” Sam says, thumbing through the pages of the book. He’d found it in the bunker on one of the many nights Dean had passed out with a beer in one hand and his bloody jacket in the other. Sam isn’t supposed to know about that. He isn’t supposed to know that Dean is miserable.
Sam opens Sarah’s door and then walks around the car to the driver’s side. The drive to the restaurant is quiet aside from Sam’s shaking leg knocking against the car door.
Sam sees Dean first. His brother’s back is to the door, so Sam sees the face of the lawyer who is facing him. They’re sitting at a table, talking about something regarding the gas prices as Sam and Sarah approach.
“I also want the damn keys to your car! I shouldn’t be walking around in this damn cold.”
His phone fell to the ground but he could still hear screaming from the other end. Cas quickly picked it up and hung up since Gabriel kept screaming Dean’s name.
(See the end of the chapter for
As he walked through the door the first thing he noticed was how empty the other side of the room was. He figured his side would be small but the other side only had three people filling up seats out front. He then smiled at everyone in his family and gave them a wink before he finally turned to look at the -oh holy shit he's hot- man he was going to marry.
Cas looks at Dean in shock. He was doing this for Cas. He was doing this to make Cas much more comfortable, was he that obvious he didn't like the cameras on him? Cas gave Dean a warm smile before he reached over to kiss Dean's cheek. "That was very kind of you to try, Dean, but I will rather not have my husband arrested on the first day."
"Bullshit." Dean walked forwards and grabbed Cas's collar in his fist so he would have no choice but to look at him. "You can take out four vamps by yourself, you could easily handle one. So why do you keep trying to kill yourself?"
“Cas!” Dean ran over to kneel beside him as Rowena reassured him that he was fine. He’ll wake up soon enough back to his old self.
When he opened the door he was already being filmed but ignored the cameras and walked to his room to change. He figured his tux will already be there; laid out on his bed because Ellen was there. And he grinned as he opened his bedroom door and his tux and shoes laid out for him.
When Cas pulled away to take a breath, he felt his hair tugged so he could look up at the man who made him feel small. It made him realize that his once great self was long gone, and this is all that’s left. He hated it. Hated this man. Hated himself. Hated the whole damn world.
He feels sick. Not from excitement but from the nerves because what if they pair him up with someone who doesn't like green eyes. Or what if they hate the way he walks or talks. Maybe they will hate him at first sight and then run back up the aisle.
"Captain America? Nice." Dean winked at him as he brushed his teeth over one of the sinks and Cas went to stand in front of the other.
Sam rarely comes with Dean to get all these things since he was always busy with school, but today he came along on the day that Dean ran out of maiz azul. It just meant more trabajo para los dos.
Dean and Cas get some alone time at last. What's more perfect than a movie night in the back of the car with your best bud? By bud, I mean boyfriend.
“I want a shake.” She sniffled, and Dean did his best to ignore her red blotchy eyes for her sake.
Cas walked in, his blanket already in tow, and took a seat on one end of the couch. Dean sat on the other with the nachos tray right in between them. Cas sat with his legs crossed and tucked into a corner, almost facing Dean, while he reached into the food before the movie even began to play.
Dean helped Cas with his bed before sitting beside his boyfriend, who already had the necklace in his blistering red fingers. Dean watched his face for a reaction, but Cas only looked like he was studying it between his swelling fingers before he held it out for Dean to take.
“Dude, how am I supposed to know?”
Dean could feel the relief wash over him as he heard those words. Maybe old habits are hard to break but adding new ones was surprisingly getting easier.
any of this.
. Dean could turn his head and his nose could be buried in Cas’s hair, the smell of nature still follows Cas around, and he could hold him. Hold him like he has always wanted to hold Cas, with no immediate danger or death hanging over them. He just wanted to hold Cas because he
“Dean, nobody but me ever comes out here.”
… he loves you. He-he loves you like you were his own.” She didn’t look at him, but he could see her face scrunch up, ready to argue. “He worries about you constantly, and Jack knows all about you because he won’t shut up about how awesome you are.”
Everyone else then left giving him good luck wishes and kisses on the cheeks or the way Jo gave him a punch on the arm and told him not to mess it up while Benny took his face in his hands and pressed a kiss to his lips telling him the same thing.
“Dude, what are you doing? Get back in bed.”
Dean didn't pay attention to much of what the host was saying as he fought the urge to reach over to hold Cas hand. He knew by now they would be showing videos of their marriage and Dean didn't want to listen.
It was silent while Dean made raspado, but he couldn’t wait for their fingers to graze again when he handed the cup over to Cas.
Dean cleared his throat before holding his hand out, not looking at Cas as he does so. Once again, Cas does not take it, so Dean wiggles his fingers hoping maybe that would get Cas’s attention, but when he turns around, he notices Cas has been staring at his face.
Dean sees a distressed Cas and he can't help himself.
Cas fluttered his baby blues at him before he gripped Dean’s arm. “I wish I asked for these a long time ago.”
“Ask Eileen if she needs anything.” Dean hit his brother’s arm from where he sat in the Impala's passenger seat while Dean drove them. “We can drop it off at her place on the way back.”
Dean cracked a smile even if his heart was racing hard against his ribs. “You haven’t left my side since you’ve been back, so goodbye kisses are kinda hard for us.”
“You forget a word there, buddy?” Dean chuckled while he took the leather chain to drape over his boyfriend’s head until it fell against his chest.
“Seriously, dude! Who fucking kisses someone and then drops them like that? I mean...I thought I meant more to you than that.”
“Yeah. Apparently, John really fucked me up because he is the subject of the next session too.” He tried not to make it sound like a big deal. Cas knew everything that John ever did; the whole rebuilding of him kinda made Dean an open book to Cas. “Mary too. Bobby. You know…parents.”
“I’m a four-year-old.”
“I don’t understand your fascination with my clothes,” Cas said as he opened the passenger side door and sat down. Dean followed and turned the car on. “You never cared before.”
Cas held him for a second, comforting Dean when it should be the other way around before Mia knocked at the open door, asking if he was ready to continue their session. Dean didn’t hesitate when he told her that he was.
Dean ignored her scary and oddly familiar glare as he pushed the seat back so his legs could fit. “Oh, come on. My treat.”
“I never wanted…” Dean shook his head as his eyes tightly shut for a second. “Does he want to be human because of me?”
“But Dean,”
They close their eyes hoping they can get a few hours of dreamless sleep.
"I want to apologize for invading your space like this." Dean whispered as he moves away just a little. "Sam always made fun of me cuddling whatever warm body was sleeping next to me."
“What?” Dean asked with a low chuckle. Seeing the same concerned look from practically the same face was a little funny. “You two look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“How’s your family taking it, Castiel?” The host lady said and Dean could feel Cas stiffen up beside him.
“In your head, you’re four,” Cas confirms while Jack nods in agreement; it was stiff and a little sad. Almost like he was regretting talking about this to them. “And it’s not the body you see yourself in.”
"No. I'm good. Let's get married!" Dean reassured Castiel and he smiled before they both turned towards the minister. Dean already had a plan forming that he would get a real smile out of Castiel by the end of the night.
He felt panic rise in his chest as he unwrapped himself and ignored the pain on the back of his head. That’s where the lamp struck him, but his vision was fine; he can do without the piercing ringing in his ears, so he’s taking that as a sign to not go to the hospital.
‘Dean!’ Dean looks up thinking someone called for him but everyone was watching Bobby struggle to open a present Gabriel has got him. ‘Dean, wake up!’
Dean thought as his arms hung loosely at his sides.
“Not telling you. About
“Maybe I should check if the doors are all locked again.” Cas got up from the kitchen table, ready to jiggle doorknobs, for the third time that morning. Dean quickly closed the fridge door to run over and stop him.
“I’ll go get my coat!” Sam rinsed off his sticky hands and started to walk out of the kitchen, but Dean grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and pulled him in close. Pinning him down against his chest, which was difficult considering the kid is a damn giant.
Then he has his brother and Eileen. He loves them both so much, and they need their space; he gets that, he wishes Cas and him will get to - Wow! Hold your horse, Winchester!
"But you and Cas...I just. I never see you guys act like anything besides friends."
Cas looked at him from above the car with narrowed eyes and that small head tilt. “Are we not going home?”
Sam laughed and pulled away so the rest of his family can hug him. As soon as they said there goodbye and Cas was by his side again they left in the car that was waiting for them.
He answers, it was an automatic response that he tried not to have it sound as tired as he felt, and then he is being kissed. He hated being kissed the most and carefully moved in a way to not offend the rough lips that only start kissing down his throat. Hands start roaming his borrowed body–he has yet to accept that this is all that’s left of his once-great and powerful self. That this is
Dean wondered how disappointed they would be if they found out he was going out with a guy instead.
When Sam came he was talking about work and about how not so bad it is to work with Gabriel as a partner in their law firm. He mentioned how he was dating again and that he was adopting another dog. He was happy and didn’t look so tired and old from late nights of hunting or trials. When it was time to open presents he sat with Cas on the couch, both of them so close together they might as well be sitting on top of each other, watching as Claire opened present after present. He liked turning his head and kissing Cas on the cheek or lips, even for those few seconds. He liked the idea of going to bed tonight with Cas even though he has been doing it for so long.
Dean still can’t believe this happy little boy is his kid.
Feeling Cas wrap his arms around Dean’s neck to hold him as their grins were so close together made Dean’s heart leap. Eventually, Cas’s forehead fell against Dean’s, and the dancing slowed to a nice sway even though the beat was only getting quicker.
Cas gave Dean a confused look but his family must have found it funny so Cas decided on giving him a small smile.
“Well, I like it!” Jack wrapped his arms around Dean to give him a big hug. “You should be happy more often.”
“We’re going to have to figure out who left that box there.” Cas tells him as he plays with Dean’s hand. “And what it was doing to you.”
But Dean couldn’t get a damn word out cause Cas also staggered in wearing just pajama bottoms and Dean’s dead-man robe left wide open so Dean could enjoy the view of his chest. Especially his tattoo that Dean liked to gawk at whenever he got the opportunity. Because underneath that ratty old trench coat and a suit that left everything to the imagination, Cas was…Right now wasn’t the best time.
Also, the next chapter is sort of a surprise and will be posted soon!
I promise. It's a happy ending fic.
Dean looked over his body again just to make sure there was no blood and when he looked back at his face he was meet with hazy blue eyes staring back at him.
So instead of answering, Dean just nodded, and then John gave him a quick hug before they heard that darn wedding song start. He felt like an idiot doing this, Sam is definitely going to make fun of him for this, but he couldn't care enough right now. He was about to see the face of whoever he was about to marry.
Just as a heads up! This is all in Cas's POV so you will read some Cas/Mick stuff but don't worry it's still the happy ending we all wanted.
Dean looks away, packing the ice into the cup before reaching to pour the vainilla as he talks. “Yeah, I know you can, pero; I just wanted to let you know that you don’t have to.”
time…this time he won’t come back to me.”
Cas hummed as his eyes fluttered closed for a few seconds, a little drugged out, before looking up a Dean with a half glare. There was no fire behind those eyes—just a worried stare. “I thought I told you to go home. Get proper rest.”
No, that’s not the right word. Hesitant was more like it.
“Hey, Jack. We should talk.”
Cas was quickly scooped into Dean’s arms as they hugged. Dean hugged him around his middle while Cas’s arms wrapped around Dean’s neck, hiding his face into the crook of his best friend’s neck. They didn’t say anything but Cas cried as he felt Dean's hands’ smooth circles on his back.
Dean reached to touch the warm grace around his neck. He took it off from Cas just if the hospital lost or broke it, but now it was the only thing keeping him from having his own nervous breakdown.
He knew it wasn’t going to be easy for any of them to move on, even for Sam, who was debating moving in with Eileen when she asked, but he freaked out with the big step he hasn’t taken since Jess. Luckily, Eileen understood and has been staying over at the bunker more often. Making this her home with no hesitation, and Dean liked her more for it. Especially for being so understanding about their fucked up family relationships.
He can have this. Can have Cas and it was a damn Christmas miracle that Cas was dumb enough to want Dean the same way. And fuck his stubble did feel great against his skin.
“He’s my family now. And I
"I'm getting married today." Cas whispers in slow horror.
“Cas!” He heard the familiar voice soothe him. “What the hell, man? Why haven’t you answered my calls? You okay?”
“The houses are nice to look at. One day, Sammy!” Sam was already groaning at Dean’s words that sounded more like an old man’s recurring ‘when I was your age’ stories. “One day, I’ll get us a house like that! One where we can each have our own room. And bathroom.”
“It’s okay,” Dean said out loud for himself and Jack. “Cas is going to be fine.”
Jack says it with no room to argue. He’s not wrong, but if someone else heard it, they would think some vamps gave him a concussion. Especially when Jack starts touching his face like he now doubted his words.
Big thanks to Sam again for reading this and helping me out <3
“Sure, kid.”
He also has Jack. Human also, but he was just a kid. A toddler stuck in the body of a teenager when he can’t even write the word teenager. He has dealt with so much in his short life and took the Winchester habit of ignoring his problem to make the ones around you comfortable. It’s something they will all have to address sooner or later. Maybe later. Yeah, later seems like a safe bet.
