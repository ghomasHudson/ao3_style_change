"Damned, how did you kno…" These are the only sounds  escaped from his lips as a hoarse sigh and  then he just moves with his lips without saying a word and an unbearable fear is swashing in his eyes.
"It’s a dead end. Nonsense,"  she is speaking in a weak voice,  close to whisper, "because this is Sherlock."
"Do you know him? – asks John with a great interest. He is watching closely for Victor and the guy with the smartphone.
"It’s not true," squeals the fatty reviving himself and he is coming back, back, back from the crowd, which is parting to let him out.
This moment a tall  man with grey temples (obviously he’s a policeman) is going to John’s and the rest of idlers place.
They are rude in their caress and movements but a little pain make them feel better. The come  at  the same time just having their cocks rubbed together. And then in   unconscious bliss and comfort they completely take their clothes off and touch each other making careful and close study of each other. The fall asleep on the floor having their hands and legs  interlaced. Sherlock’s head is on John’s shoulder and even in his dream John hugs Sherlock as if trying to protect him. They are close  and happy as they haven’t ever been.
“I have some fails in inorganic chemistry,”- he answers. “And  I must hand the works in till Monday. Or I’ll be given into expulsion  list.”
“Oh, we will  thank my brother, surely, “ Sherlock assures John,” He is a great asshole  but  sometimes he can be kind.”
“Your brother?” John jerks up his head “I thought he…” And John decides  not to reveal his suggestions.
And it seems to John that  everyone in the queue looks at him with blame and agrees that he is a real thief. And the worst point is that Sherlock is present and he  hears all the insults John is given.
John  turns back to give his last glance to Sherlock and  watches him nervously looking around as if he is looking for something. He might have not found all the evidences yet, - thinks John bitterly and he is annoyed. He covers his head with  the hood and runs out of park having his heart bleeding from offense and disappointment.
“If you overdose, the psychedelic stimulators can  provoke a disturbance of the psyche with insomnia, anxiety, delirium and hallucinations. If you use them constantly you will have the whole nervous breakdown, depression, mental oppression,”  Sherlock enumerates the symptoms in a  nonchalant, indifferent voice but at the end he adds with a little regret, “ and I haven’t mentioned the addiction. I’m a former bangster, I know what I’m talking about. Though you can’t be “former” when we talk about drug-addiction.” he nods his head and John tries to persuade himself that  he  doesn’t feel the bitter taste of Sherlock’s last words.
John makes a little swallow of the very hot coffee and tastes the most amazing croissant  in his life.  John give the packet to Sherlock and  says: “So must you.”
-It really doesn’t mean that I can’t cope myself, - tries John one more time, -But  you help is also necessary If you were serious speaking about it. I’m John and have introduced myself, haven’t I? – and he is foolishly smiling and looking at this black back with a great hope. – I know, you’re Sherlock. And what about inorganic…
"You gave me..." repeats John patiently but the fatty doesn’t listen to him and continues his show. The queue begins to trouble and some   people are getting close being attracted by the hot atmosphere of scandal.
“This is my assistant,” says Sherlock to the arrogant policewoman and pull John by  his sleeve to the corpse. “What do think, John?” and he turns to his lover  to see his answer and John smiles. Sherlock still doesn’t like any  aids that’s why he tries  to have John in view. And John touches Sherlock’s shoulder if he wants to say something.  They cooperate and interact ideally,  take each other’s hint s or looks and seem to be a pair. They don’t kiss  or hug each other in public, don’t shock anybody .
“Yeah, Mycroft is my elder brother “ Sherlock’s explanation is very necessary. “That time he visited the café to get acquainted with you as he said that there too much your presence in my life.” Sherlock smiles and adds: “He liked you.” And John smiles at the answer.
Without saying a word Sherlock bends his head and his nose buries right into John’s belly. That causes butterflies John’s stomach and he hopes that they will not causes a great noise and Sherlock will not hear  them and will not guess about John’s state. He smells Sherlock perfume with notes of sweat and blood, licks his lips and  carefully moves the hair on the back of the head apart and watching the ear and its little lobe he wants to bite. And John sighs concentrating on the wound. But actually its not so bad cause he was waiting to see something more frightening. Thanks God, whatever it was used by Victor to hit Sherlock, he didn’t kill him.  John  gingerly pours the wound with  hydrogen peroxide, rinsing it and stopping the blood, and watching the transparent  liquid  trickling down the long neck to the white shirt collar stained with blood red dry spots. John dries the neck  cleaning the hideous scab then he takes the wad of cotton wool and a sterile bandage and tenderly dresses Sherlock’s head. For some seconds he is slow in finishing and taking his hands away from alluring  hair but then he sets the bandage straight and pushes Sherlock away to say he has finished. Sherlock is staring at him, licking his dry lips and keeps silence.
John is shocked  and amazed by Sherlock’s perspicuity cause the usual reaction he could count on after the changing of the habits was a question or request to give some explanations. John nod to Molly and takes Sherlock’s words into consideration. But Molly doesn’t leave him and it would be silly to hope for this.
The next day Sherlock doesn’t come to the café and John is despaired. Sherlock doesn’t appear for three days and it’s enough to John’s world to go hell. He doesn’t sleep well, can’t concentrate during the lectures, losses  his temper with Molly  and answers back to Victor. He is quite ready to fight with patient Mike or gets completely drunk as he understands that Sherlock doesn’t’ come to café because he has lost any interest to John, no matter what kind of interest it was. John is eager to play a role of guinea pig  if only  one curly head can be found somewhere near him. But the miracle happens only on the fourth day , when having lost any hope to see Sherlock John notices the familiar silhouette dressed in swinging  black coat at the doors of the café.
He touches him gently, pours the scratches, bends and blows to reduce the pain and his cheek is close Sherlock’s one and puts a plaster on. Sherlock seems not to breath at all and John blushes as he  thinks that Sherlock could guess about the emotional storm in his heart and soul and fears it a lot.
For a moment John hides in the utility room, takes off his uniform apron takes his things out of his service locker and runs out from the private entrance. Ye doesn’t notice the gangling Sherlock’s figure until he runs into him.
And after this statement  they have enough forces to continue their living . They don’t discuss past  or future, Sherlock is busy with his strange and mysterious  affairs with the police  and John studies hard to become a good doctor and saves his sister but now they have a silent agreement. Certainly, John wished to have more but he can’t ask about it and tries to be satisfied with this fragile happiness . What about Sherlock – his thoughts are a big puzzle, but he looks and behaves as if everything is all right. And who is John to demand more? Especially to demand something he can be turned down? He will not overcome  this situation. His silly heart will be completely broken if Sherlock  banishes him from his sight. That’s why John lives only in the present, makes coffee for Sherlock and feeds him up with doughnuts.
John screws up his eyes as the light  at the landing is a little bit bright for him/ Sherlock helps him but John understands that he has more than two  rib broken. They  go up the  off his high stairs and find themselves in a little loving room with a fireplace. John take off his dirty Jacket and places it in the corner not to  stain anything. He looks around and sees the mess  and desolation in the room as if a tornado played in it. John supposes that  he exactly  knows the name of that tornado.
“You are a fool< John! Such a great fool! O my God, I love you too! I felt in love with you at the moment I saw you for the first time. I saw  you at the window of the café when I was passing by. I couldn’t  move and I had been standing for half an hour before I dared to come into. I was watching you,  admiring you, enjoying you… Gosh, I went crazy about you. How could you suppose that I hate you?... What a load of bull! I just….” Sherlock  fitfully breathes and hugs  him stronger. John’s heart  is melting with joy as  he is so happy to listen to all these words. And Sherlock doesn’t want to  stop his monologue and he continues his whispering:
"OK, I’m going to take his phone number, " John has a pause in his work and follows his eyes  after Victor. He watches Victor coming to the tall dark-haired guy, who is sitting at the table near the window . But the guy doesn’t see Victor as he is enthusiastically  typing in his smartphone. Molly sighs behind John.
On Friday John takes some days off, though his job gives him some earnings, ignores Harry’s  phone calls and has a good sleep. Looking in the mirror  John examines  his reflection and notices the circles under his eyes and  burst capillaries. He is hungry but his amounts of money has run over. John finds a dry bun and reads his textbook, eating it greedily. But later  he feels he  is bored  and abandoned  with sitting within these four walls. Mike Stamford has gone to the cinema with his girlfriend and it is only John, who must solve the stupid problems and tasks. Having his head taking a pause in thinking, John puts  his summaries, textbooks and notebooks into his bag, finds the lost change in his pockets and goes to the park. London is nice due to the  absence  of damned fog and the bright weather. And John feels much better out-of-doors. He even  devours three themes,  easy goes to the heart of given examples explained be the  teacher and copied with the nice and neat Mike’s handwriting. Several  labs are done easily with some kind of inspiration. That’s why he spends next moments lying on the bench and enjoying himself. He allows his brain some moments of rest. Then he counts the coins in his pocket and buys one more bun. John goes to watch ducks, which don’t want to leave the pond  for warmer  countries and switch  over for a while. It is there he sees a crowd of idlers, a yellow police tape fencing in the crime place, some of the staff of Scotland Yard and (oh, it impossible)  a lanky Sherlock’s figure dressed in invariable black coat. John’s heart loses its rhythm and John  comes closer as if  he is magnetic. Standing near the tape, he observes Sherlock  eagerly. He is  studies the crime place, talks quietly with the policemen, squats and examines the corpse carefully. His movements are scanty and perfect, maybe  a little bit theatrical, and sexual. John is crazy about touching his mat skin, wrings his thin and nervous fingers – he hasn’t ever felt and have   such weird wishes in café and surely it is fresh air to be blame.  It’s high time to leave the place and the idlers are disappearing one by one but John is standing and looking at Sherlock and his  heart is never
John smiles  because it is really good information for him. He is always afraid of  putting his foot in it again or to tell about his feelings. It can’t be said that John didn’t speak about them but he announced that to the world but it can’t be taken  seriously as Sherlock didn’t hear him . This situation is similar to a false start and John isn’t against to  start again.
And John realizes that he can be searched  immediately and he doesn’t remember his cash. It really  may be a twenty pound banknote somewhere in his pockets."	I…" and he turns pale,  and he feels sick. He is fed up with this cruel farce,
"I doubt whether,"   the stranger grins, " I doubt whether," and he leaves the café  - so elegant, fit and neat,  supernatural.
“I’m flying against  the wind, John,” sings Harry, “I’m flying and I’m free… We’ve  said good bye… at last… It’s so nice , this wonderful feeling of freedom…” In the background  John hears  noise  of the engine, tinkling of the glass as if the bottle that harry has in here hands (oh, John can imagine this exactly) falls down. “O, Johnny, moment. I’ll be here in a moment,” he hears a noise  and rustling. John supposes that Harry has dropped her phone too.
And John, who usually is calm and passionless, loses his temper:"Shut up, you, idiot!"  and he turns red because he has revealed his feelings in front of this oaf.
But Sherlock stays and watches  John with some demands John can’t understand. All he can do us to return to finish  the making of Viennese coffee. There are too many difficulties and puzzles in his life that’s why he thinks that making some coffee is the best occupation under the present circumstances. But later his thoughts returns to the stranger and he can’t  stop the storm of ideas and suggestions which are jumping widely in his head. What links and relationships can connect such resembling and simultaneously  not resembling people. Falling asleep at dawn John prefers the variant  “lovers”,  refused ‘acquaintances” or “friends”. Certainly, there are such variants as “relatives” or “colleagues” but John finds them unbelievable doesn’t  take them into consideration. In the morning he is sure he will not see Sherlock again, but he bursts into the café with wind and fog entangled in his curls. Can’t hold his happy and foolish , John makes him coffee and adds some caramel.
This unbelievable discovery impresses John  and makes him muse for some minutes when Sherlock successfully returns to his drowsy state. John has to jump up, finds Mike’s juice and gives it to Sherlock in his mug/ While Sherlock is drinking John is looking for the clothes in his wardrobe. He finds the clean T-shirt and training trousers, timidly to Sherlock offers them and tries to explain that he wants him to stay: “Of course, you can leave right now, but a cab won’t come soon… and you’re too weak. You can spend this night here, my neighbor is on duty so nobody will be in the way…”
"Jerk!" John spits it out being ready to have a fight but it is impossible due to another client coming to the bar. John slaps the false grin on  and says:"Can I take your order?"
The first time of Sherlock’s appearance in the café concurs with the first day of John’s work. According to Molly’s words, he drank his coffee somewhere else if really drank it at all. And John suggests that Sherlock likes him.  And they quickly return to their previous  variant of conversation but they have done a great step forward. And now Sherlock writes  a lot of messages, from the simplest  “Good morning” to “What time will it take from an experienced surgeon to  disbud a kidney at home?” In his turn, John is glad to remind Sherlock to have breakfast , tries not to be shocked  with these strange and doubtful questions  and  he isn’t lazy to look through some books to find  the  necessary information. Sherlock visits the café. Sometimes he is absent for some days due to  his  detective affairs. But  now he always warns John sending him a message. And John is very grateful as he would go mad   if he was left  uncertain about his Sherlock .But they enjoy the  time which they spend together in the café: they  are together and even can touch  each other. Sometimes they  have funny discussions about the clients as Sherlock amuses John by telling the true  things which are open for him. After the end of John’s work they go to the John’s dormitory and Sometimes Sherlock visits him to have a cup of tea. It is really just hot tea which John  makes and brews  in a little Chinese teapot. Due to Sherlock’s intuition he comes only the days when Mike Stamford is on his night duties as he works as a nurse boy in the hospital. Sherlock often tells John about his crime detections and John listens him with astonishment, hanging on every Sherlock’s word. Sometimes they just keep silence sitting nearby on John’s bed and John often drops  off to sleep on Sherlock’s shoulder. In the morning Sherlock is always away but a cup of coffee, hot and tasty, and a bun are near. Sometimes John makes guesses about his role in Sherlock’s life .The answer  about his attitude to Sherlock was decided long ago – John realizes that this is love. It seems to John  that  Sherlock is not indifferent for him as all this care and time spent together demonstrate a deep feeling but  doubts are always present in John’s heart. He is so ordinary and plain, His appearance isn’t  attractive, he isn’t wit, he is just  average John Watson. Then he asks himself about the reasons of Sherlock’s behavior. Why is it so if it is not a sympathy? And answers are  fantastic and wild from a mystic bet with him as a goal to a unknown experiment where he plays a role of a little guinea pig. And he remembers a strange and powerful man with an umbrella and his relation to Sherlock. It is enough to kill John . He feels disturbed and uneasy. But he can’t think bad things about Sherlock. He is not able to think bad about him. And he moves all his doubts and jealousy  away and loses his head near Sherlock. He doesn’t ask anything more. But he can’t stop dreaming about it.
They just  circling each other like a planet and a satellite in a difficult scheme of reciprocal function. Sometimes John is afraid of his heaven  near Sherlock. He wakes up at nights and just listens his   breathing and makes his heart  stop being so scared to lose this  shaggy-haired long-legged and genius happiness. And the sweetest moment is to see the same fear in Sherlock’s eyes. This fear has a sinking sensation in the pit of the stomach. And John completely agree to have this fear for all his life as surely he will never meet a better person than his Sherlock. Sherlock is a phenomenon , a natural disaster and cataclysm  and John admires him . And  feasts his eyes upon him. And enjoys.
“Deduction!”  John is inspired. “But you couldn’t know about  the  twenty pounds note? When the fatty was speaking you were sitting  at your table. How was it possible?”
“Oh, it were you there, in the park!” exclaims Sherlock and slaps his  head,” You were there, and it wasn’t my imagination.” John is surprised a lot.
In the dim  light of a street lamp John with great horror recognizes Sherlock and Victor,  enmeshed  with each other. Sherlock is kept to the brick wall with Victor’s hulk. Sherlock  is trying to release himself from this unpleasant embrace but Victor has a firm grip and he is a strong guy though he is obviously  zooming now. Victor is leaning with all his weigh upon Sherlock’s back and succeeded to undo  his jeans and now he is trying to fix Sherlock’s hips and to move his legs apart. He is puffing, one his hand is fixing Sherlock’s hands over his head and the other is rummaging about his body looking for a fly. Victor’s is mumbling  and he is full of saliva and lust:
"He hardly looks at me at all," argues John. The glance at the entrance and a glance when Sherlock tastes coffee can’t be taken as an action in Continuous tense.
John wants. He is eager to feel  Sherlock’s shoulder nearby, smells his odor,  has his unruffled calm and strength. John  wants  Sherlock to  take the part of  his damned problem as he’s so tired to carry them alone.
John takes him and thinks the possible ways: take Sherlock to the hospital or to the students’ hostel. John’s hostel is closer than the hospital and in decides everything. John chooses his room. At last, he always can call the ambulance. John with his arm round Sherlock’s waist, putting Sherlock’s arm on his shoulder takes him to the university town,. It’s rather good that Mike Stamford is on duty today and he will avoid the unnecessary questioners about this unasked and unwilling visitor.  All his way to the hostel Sherlock keeps silence, but sometimes his kissing through his teeth and groans. John supposes that he has blacked out for some times but there is no time to ask about details. John reminds the content of his first-aid fit and is very glad that he used money when he filled it. They have no problems to enter the dormitory. John takes Sherlock into his room and lays him on his bad as if Sherlock is a doll. Though the situation is really crazy John is  happy to take care of Sherlock.
He take’s John’s hand and they went out into the street and this touch makes the rest of self-reliance in John’s heart believe that everything will be all right. The cab is here and John says goodbye gazing at Sherlock and trying to remember him so  well-organized, calm and confident. John really  doesn’t know, what happened, or if Harry is alive a but  a glance on Sherlock’s  passionless face makes him calmer. If he goes off into hysterics it will not help Harry anyway.  John tells the address, which said Harry,  to the cabbie and  watches Sherlock until his silhouette disappears in London’s twilights.
"Amazing, " whispers John and  watches him  adorable. Sherlock keeps silence and doesn’t show any attitudes to the accident.
John hardly  avoids  jumping up due to the unexpectedness, turns round and meets  examining eyes of the man with umbrella. And Sherlock watches them carefully sitting at his table.  Without understanding anything in the mise-en-scène all of them are taking part in, John smiles politely:"Visit us again, please."
“Jo-o-o-o-hn,” drawls she, “my little brother! I am afraid of living….” Cries she. “It is so horrible to live and not to be able to believe anyone!...”
defense is broken and now he is unprotected and opened for Sherlock and his love. John feels that Sherlock needs him a lot and tries to explain that he needs  him too and maybe even more.  He tries to demonstrate it with the language of his body and Sherlock kisses him and whispers as if he is in a fever : “Mine… Mine..  Mine… At last you are mine… Forever…” And John can’t say a word as his tongue doesn’t obey him at all as usual and  lays himself open to Sherlock’s endearments and  bending  to meet his touching. This is their first time together but they don’t control themselves and are in a hurry  as they want to assert their rights to each other marking  their bodies with kisses and love bites.
Going home John can’t help thinking about Sherlock and his deed. John wants to think about it. Yes, he called the fatty’s bluff, came to unmask  him for John, not for just justice or fairness, not for fun or sporting interest. And he lives  with this idea for some time.  But later his doubts are present again and, going to bed, John is sure that Sherlock  didn’t stand up for him but just did that what he always does – expose liars and law-breaker.  Mike Stamford is snoring  silently  and murmurs  something in his sleep. And John  tosses and turns. He reminds Sherlock’s  eyes – he was mistaken thinking they are grey. He is sure they are blue. Transparent blue.
“What?” John amazingly looks at Sherlock  who  has come to the bar counter and Victor aggressively moves at him. Sherlock doesn’t pay any attention to Victor’s  bulling  and threats but he stares at John for an endless long time before he talks again.
Sherlock appears in three days after Victor’s self-discharge. He is  still thin and emaciated but looks like a person being recovered  after a a grave illness. He hesitates to come into the café  and stops near the entrance  his eyes looking for John. They look at each other as two plotters and instead of going to his booth Sherlock goes  straight to the bar counter.
" Are you in habit to short-change honest citizens," the fatty man spouts insults to  John, " maybe you’re don’t have enough for the dose? And you make hay here! You’re a petty thief! Look at him! Return my money, you, milksop!"
But the idea that Sherlock, this unbelievable   and aristocratic Sherlock will get acquainted with Harry who is drunk, is horrible and unbearable.
“you don’t hear without aid, do you?” clarifies John when Sherlock turns his head to him and  Sherlock nods.
The fatty moves back, tring to close his pocket with his all five fingers. His cheeks are covered with cowardly sweat, his eyes are goggling at Sherlock with an animal fear, his lips are quivering.
Having a lot of problems with Harry John is close enough  to be late to his work. There is no Victor behind the counter and  Molly, who is too nervous, says only that he has left this work.
Baker street is rather far away from John’s dormitory and there is no money for cab (as usual). To tell the truth, he doesn’t have enough to the tube and he runs to the centre of London as if it is the most important marathon in his life. He has a trace line in his head to show him the shortest way to Sherlock’s home and John follows it strictly  without any deviation. He  runs throughout the crowds like a shell. Some people give him  a way, others  say something  to his back but nobody stops him. John really isn’t able to think about different  trivia like the culture in the  street, because he is sure that something bad has happened with Sherlock and he is afraid to be late.  It can’t be just jealousy, says John to himself, as he explained everything right there, in the café. The real reason is that Sherlock has got into a pretty mess. And his wild imagination presents him a lot of horrible pictures:  from a ripper maniac to common heart attack. John is in a hurry, he whispers to himself something like:”Hold on, Sherlock, I’ll come soon!” and people  dash aside him.
“No, I didn’t.” Sherlock grins,” I don’t like them. I can lip read and I don’t need to hear to get the situation. My deduction came into existence because of my hatred to the aids.”
And it is high time for John’s blood to boil: “Stop lying me, Sherlock. You heard that I cried to you. You just ran away. The whole street heard me. The whole damned street knew that it was Clara , Harry’s girl-friend and she was a lesbian. That  I…” and John interrupted himself as he is not able to feel this come-down one more time. He is tired and asks one more time: “I will repeat my question: why were you angry?”
“Can’t recommend you to do it! Besides a short-time improving of your cognitive functions, which can be taken as an improvement of memory and attention, you will have  an asthenia followed by headaches,  tiredness and degradation.”
John smiles and cant’ stand to get closer to Sherlock to have some more hugs and Sherlock  is as  enthusiastic as if he was starving and John were some bread. They fall on each other clutching clothes and trying to  be as close as possible. Insatiable hands  touching their bodies, lips find lips to become one in a kiss and   find themselves on the old and shabby Persian carpet which is full of different chemicals spots. All John’s
“I… Me…Yeah….” Sherlock swallows loudly. “I’m not sure… Don’t know.  May be my head…” And he is not able to finish and tumbles down straight onto John.
“You can hear, can’t you? You wasn’t looking at me when I was speaking about my feelings…” He doesn’t want to slug it out or to bring Sherlock to light. He   just  wants to clarify everything.
While he is making Viennese coffee, he hears a  voice behind him saying:"Thank you, John. I was glad to meet you."
Molly’s cheeks  are glowing  but she just nods with agreement. The talk between  Victor and Sherlock(it is so easy  for John to change the neutral “guy”  into his proper name) is turning into drama. Victor   lost his dominating position looming  over him and  took a step back. His face is  ravaging with red spots, he is chewing  his lips and his hands are trembling. Sherlock is telling something to him just scanning his strained figure. At last Victor drops something in the answer, turns around and runs away. He even doesn’t give any glance at shocked and surprised Molly and John, hides in a storeroom and John has another client. Before taking an order, John gives Sherlock  one more quick glace and shudders after catching his  look. It is a strange look. Sherlock is staring at him in a strange way, as if he scanning or studying him. And it can’t be understood easily. John must feel uncomfortable under this piercing  eyes but he just smiles in reply – he doesn’t like Victor at all. When John gives  the latte to the client and looks up to see Sherlock he can see only the cup with unfinished coffee standing on the edge of  the free table.
For the three days of Harry’s coma John loses his sense of time,   mixes day and night, he doesn’t remember his last meal and how is it to sleep at night. He’d like to do something but he has no money, no relations, and nobody to ask any help. The doctors can’t say anything and their prognoses are different, the nurses visit Harry for a moment to make all necessary  treatment and go to another patients. John can’t demand anything as he understands that   there are a lot of patients like Harry here but he realizes that if the situation doesn’t change  he won’t last long. John feels awful when he decides  to go out. It’s high time. The nurse is getting Harry on a usual grip and promises John to sit some time nearby. John goes to the porch of the hospital and screws up his eyes as the sun shines too bright. It seems to him that all the world has run   far away and it is only he to stay near the broken car. He inhale a full breast of this wet warm London air and sits down the stairs. He feels giddy and his hand are trembling. John closes his eye and tries to imagine that he is very far from hear. And when he opens his eyes he sees Sherlock. Sherlock is standing in front of him giving him a big plastic glass of water and a packet with something that smells like fresh fancy cakes.
"He is a chemist, I have seen him some times at the uni," Molly’s voice is pacing and trembling. It’s very suspicious." He doesn’t have any relationships. He is too..." She takes a pause as if she can’t find the necessary words.
“Why was it broken?” John continues his  examination. He knows that he must clear something to himself even if Sherlock doesn’t want to open his heart. If it is left without any explanation, John will go mad/ Sherlock is good at making John crazy.
John is sick and he is sorry that he  refused Sherlock’s help. Sherlock seems to be easygoing with  different police officers. But John  gets himself in hand, and  demonstrates his unbelievable persistence to know about the  injured person. Fortunately, she is alone. One of the policeman explained John where his sister was taken and takes his contacts to obtain evidences though nobody will need them.
That’s why his heart changes its pulse and he is often melancholic. It’s high time to stop this comedy but John isn’t able to cut this….how it could be called… maybe , under -relationship.But there is a big chance that there is even nothing to cut and everything was created only with his great imagination.
The fat man turns round and id preparing to argue and John wishes the earth could swallow him up. It is not the situation he dreamt to speak to Sherlock for the first time.
Due to Molly’s dreamy look  and air of reverie John realizes that Sherlock has come. John doesn’t look there by himself pretending being very busy with a honey raf  and when Molly says the cherished words “black, two sugars” , he gives the order to Victor. Molly looks at him angrily but John ignores her with might and main. Victor hems and says some scabrousness  about Sherlock and John squirms – even in this condition he can’t hear any bad and rough words about Sherlock. Unfortunately there are no clients at all and John raises his eyes and meets lost Sherlock’s look full of desperation. Coffee made by Victor stands in front of him but he hasn’t even touched the cup yet. Smartphone is gripped in his hand and the under lip is bitten with even white teeth. Sherlock is staring at John, scanning him, prying in his thoughts, trying to understand him and John is angry with him and his offence raises in his heart like a dirty soap foam.
He offers the pill to John and a mad hope visits him that maybe it is a real solution for all his problems.
Sherlock is quiet and John blushes of his embarrassment And whispers to Sherlock’s chest and he doesn’t try to get free from Sherlock’s hugs.
“Oh, no, it’s much better,”  Victor looks like a conspirator. “If you take this remedy, you will be brisk and strong as a bee for a day. You’ll be able to read this damned textbook from cover to cover and begin the next one. Organic chemistry, for example. You don’t need any rest at all.” He takes a white pill out  his pocket  and demonstrates it proudly. “It’s a panacea, miracle cure from all your problems. Daddy Victor is  able to help all suffering students!”
" Frankly speaking, I’ve heard something,"  says Molly, "that he needs the only look to tell everything about a person . And sometimes he helps the police. It doesn’t mean I was very interested to spy him."  Molly’s face is hot and she stops speaking.
He is awaken by a  strong blow  in the back which makes him to fall down the porch  and plumps his bottom right into the mud mess. The light from the opened door shows the well known  lanky figure in the coat. John blinks and tries to understand what is happening. It is  far into the night –he has slept for a long time on Sherlock’s porch and now Sherlock , who is completely dressed , is standing at the door  and is looking at  John prostrating in front of the porch.  John groans and summon his strength and Sherlock runs down the stairs and kneels near John, takes his chin, scans with his unbelievable eyes.
"Hey, chap, "the fatty is looking for something in his purse, " you’ve mistaken with my change, haven’t you? I gave you a twenty, and what? Where is my money? What a small change is it!"
Sherlock looks up at him and he looks hurt, then he licks his lips and says; “You were kissing a girl.”
"Your macchiato, please, " says he to a fat man in the plaid shirt and a west, says the price and gives the change. And he gives his duty smile to  the next client: "Ready for your order."
John stands still for a moment and he is ready to ask a question but then he understands that is what he’s wearing a badge for and nods in confusion. He makes coffee with diligence, being careful not to miss anything or do something wrong., feeling the studying look at his back. John is nervous but the coffee is perfect and he, greatly relieved, puts the cup before the man. While the man is paying, John tries to look aside but he can’t stop following him with his eyes when he leaves.  John’s face changes when the owner of umbrella sits at Sherlock’s table and they begin to talk quietly. John doesn’t hear their conversation and rare gestures don’t allow him to guess the theme. Clients divert John attention  but from time to time he looks in trouble to Sherlock and his companion and they also look at him. Definitely he is spoken about. Or not?  John is embarrassed, upset and suppose himself to have a paranoia. For some reason the conversation between the two seems to be  very important.
."You are delirious, "  John purses his lips and takes order for two cups of latte/ macchiato," as he doesn’t even look at me."
Certainly, maybe Sherlock’s attempt to get the first-year student involved in the work on crime detection will fail, but John concentrates and tries to remember everything he has learned. It seems to him they  will have a lot of corpses to examine in future. And Sherlock’s shining eyes  just prove his  guess.
“Idiot,” says John watching Sherlock’s nervous hands rushing about the coffee table, ”You are  a genius fool, Sherlock. And I am an idiot too. And I’ll never forgive myself. You see, I love you. I don’t care what do you think about yourself. You can hate me but I won’t allow you to  do foolish things. No drugs. You will have three meals a day and a walk in the evening, I promise...” John stops as he feels he can’t stand from crying.  Unwilling tears welled up in his eyes and he dries  the tears. While Sherlock isn’t glancing at him he takes the box and thinking about the ways to get rid of it. Get rid of it forever. Sherlock gives no reactions about John’s actions with the box and finishes to arrange all the jars and ointments on the table. He returns to John and carefully helps him to sit down in the  armchair. Then he takes his face and turns it left and right to examine the  injuries left after the skinheads.
He hasn’t ever  given John such an open smile and John doubts that he has ever given such a  smile to  anybody. John is surprised and doesn’t understand anything but Sherlock hugs him and whispers  somewhere to his  crown:
“Show me your hands,”  Sherlock orders and his voice doesn’t allow John to say anything against. His sleepiness and tiredness has fallen into the background. John demonstrates his hands and notices his hurt bones and  scratches.  He didn’t notice them when he washed his hands. And now its Sherlock’s turn to pour his scratches, blow on them, spread the necessary ointment and put a plaster on.
tired of looking at him. For a  moment Sherlock stays alone  and stands without any movement under the raised wind. Taken by the wind his curly hair seems to be  alive and having  their own independent life and John  is biting his lips and dreaming let Sherlock’s hair  run through  his fingers and fell its softness and tenderness. It’s not a good idea for John but his legs moves him to Sherlock and he can’t make them behave. John makes a step over the yellow tape and stands in two steps behind from his obsession. He doubles his hands into fists and hides them in the pockets of his windcheater. For a moment John closes his eyes tight as if he’s going to jump off the diving board.
“Harry, Harry,  where are  you?” John is making ristretto, Sherlock forgets about his phone and suspiciously looks at him . John hopes that it is jealousy but Sherlock’s emotions are still closed and incomprehensible  for him.
The situation becomes worse when he John finds himself in a crowd  of skinheads. There a lot of guys and they are rather aggressive but John is also very purposeful and aggressive. He is very patient and  outwardly restrained person but nobody knows what kind of temperament  is hidden under this composure and calm. Sometimes John is afraid  of this part of himself because if he lose control, he will not be able to stop. Victor is a good example and some other cases from his fighting youth. But this is not a situation to behave himself properly. He  hurries to Sherlock and his  armour made of his patient is  broken into the tiniest pieces. His target is Sherlock and he has an obstacle. So John’s task is to put the obstacle away as quickly as he can and continue his way. That’s why he doesn’t apply the brake  and begins fighting momentally. Skinheads are very  glad to have such an object for battle but they obviously underestimate  furious John. The mess, provoked by John looks like
-With no doubts it’s a murder, inspector, - answers Sherlock. –If only Anderson weren’t such a great idiot, he would give you the same answer. Look at the position of the corpse’s hands and nails…Most likely she went here willingly with her murder – a middle-aged man with asthma. He wears and old mac   and he has his  boots  just being repaired –he has new tips on his solves. May he is a taxi-driver or just often drives….
John watches a figure in black and finds that Molly makes a mistake. It is obvious there is no Sherlock’s interest   there, especially the way they want to convince him. If there is any interest it is close to interest of the researcher. And John again thinks that he is a little guinea pig whose heart is ready to burst  out of his chest  when he sees his personally vivisectionist. Has John thought about love? Oh, are you kidding?  Surely  not. It is just  admiration, adoring an art masterpiece . John tries to calm himself  with these false explanations and images but somewhere  deep in his heart, in the background, he  knows that he is in love… Head over heels.
Sherlock  twitches as if John pushed him and he keeps silence, glancing at John. The talk is surrealistic as they are still in the street, John is sitting in the pavement  and Sherlock  is in kneeling position on the lowest  step of the porch. They are surrounded with night and something like snow is falling down. John is surprised as he understands that Christmas is near.
“Nonsense,” sighs John. “Only  a deaf man wouldn’t be able to hear me. I was close to brake your door off.”
John Stretches his hand to his dirty jacket which is lying in the corner like a ugly pile and feels Sherlock’s hands on his shoulders. They get him to stand still and then turn him round. They faces are  impermissibly close to each other and John gets that Sherlock eyes  have the colour of sea water. Sherlock is looking at John and smiling widely and he looks like mischievous boy.
"He’s really very strange,"  Molly sighs one more time and come up to the table with a tray and a broomstick. She’s a waitress and this is her work. John shrugs his shoulders one more time. He wonders how was it possible for their universes to run across or bumped into  each other in such an ordinary students’ café.. He is quite sure that Sherlock will never come here again. He doesn’t belong to this place as diamonds are funny as a cleaning lady decoration. Sherlock is some kind of a foreign body and no mixing or dissolution is supposed.
John doesn’t want to stop but on the other  hand he doesn’t want to disappoint Sherlock. That’s why he gives Victor his last hit straight into the blood paste where was his cheeck face and takes a step back. His fists covered with blood and don’t want to obey John as he has got a cramp. He can’t relax or stretch them and Sherlock has to hit his fingers for some times to make them alive.
“And there in café? Did you have your aids? You remember that story with a fatty . And with Victor’s pill. You worn them, didn’t you?”
a slaughter. John escapes from the crowd leaving some lying anomies behind. He doesn’t want to  crush them off as he can’t waste any time- Sherlock needs him. But now John scares the passes-by not only with his purposefulness but with his appearance too. In passing he feels that his lips have salty taste (they get bleed), something heavy under his eyes (hematoma), a pain on his cheekbones  (a lot of  scratches and may be  a cut), and a boring pain in his chest (as it not the same hurt which he felt during the first quarrel with Sherlock, maybe he has two lungs broken). Surely, John is very vivid and may be Sherlock will not appreciate his exterior view but it doesn’t matter. He wants to be sure that everything is all right.   The rest of the way is  free from accidents. John finds the door under the number 221D and stairs up the porch and rings the bell. He doesn’t hear anything and that’s why he begins to knock with his fist and then he begins to kick it.  But the door stands still and John, to his regret,  understands that there is nobody in. The windows  on the second floor are dark  and closed and it is a bad sigh. John wants to run somewhere else, to do something more,  but he  doesn’t know where he must run and what he should do. Baker street is the only place connected with Holms besides the café. But he is not in the café or Molly would ring  John. And John will wait for Sherlock here. One day he will return home and they will have a talk. John  slips down on the porch and  leans against the door. It is cold and it is unpleasant drizzling rain but John doesn’t care. He is concentrated on  his thoughts about Sherlock. John closes his eyes and tries to pray waiting for Sherlock but he soon falls asleep.
As John is making coffee, Sherlock is observing him. John catches his look when he diverts his attention from coffee for a tiny moment and he answers with  timid and uncertain smile. John adds a doughnut from himself as he thinks that Sherlock must  gain some weight to be normal. Sherlock raises his eyebrows surprisingly but John frowns and shows that he insists . Sherlock sighs  heavily and takes the plate closer to him. Having paid for the order, he doesn’t leave John to take his usual place but stays at the counter and occupies the nearest stool and it is co delightful. Now John is able to look at Sherlock any time he wants  and have his attentive look as the answer. John is  jealous of  Sherlock’s smartphone as if they have found some kind of parity or balance – both of them are pretending to have Sherlock’s attention and the both  of them take the existence of each other as a given fact.
“John, John, stop it, please. It’s enough…” John hardly hears Sherlock’s words through the blood booming in his head. But Sherlock is trying to catch  his hand and drag away from Victor.
_What can you say?- asks he and shelter the flame of the lighter from the wind. – Is it a murder or a suicide?
“Because you have  blacked out several times and I didn’t know where you live, and it was faster than take you to the hospital...” John suggests some harmless half-truth ideas.
“I was in love and I thought it was mutually. But my deafness.. That man… He abandoned me. I understood that I’m defective. Nobody needs me.  That’s why I was afraid to show you that I love you. I didn’t want you to alienate me. It seemed to me that even friendship should be enough to be happy. I am such an idiot.” Sherlock admits his mistakes. “And forgive me. Forgive my jealousy. I love you, John. I also love you.’
John is at a loss, he creates the weirdest  suggestions, he is jealous to the dude with  the umbrella though he didn’t see him more and misses their looks and glances in the café, which became some kind of a ritual at the entrance and after John makes coffee.
Sherlock keeps silence and John makes the first , then hardest step to the door. His heart is breaking into pieces but  the second step is a little bit easier. He will have a possibility to cry later, alone. And the falling snow hides his tears and  cold his flashing cheeks.
Sherlock is sitting on John’s bed and watching John taking his first-aid-kit and laying out wads of cotton wool , hydrogen peroxide, plaster…
Sherlock looks down as if he is guilty and then he  jerks up his head and look at John with a strange  challenge: “You’re right, John. I am deaf. I was born deaf. I can speak, I can lip read easily and I don’t like wearing any deaf aids as I have an awful headache after. I don’t need you sorrow. I can manage with my problem. I even can play a violin,” says he proudly. “Have I  satisfied your curiosity?”
Though he is still knelling in front of John, he looks ideal and  unapproachable, aristocratic and cold (but it is a puzzle how he is able to do it in such position).  And John is completely surprised with this information and he can’t stand amazing. Certainly he understands that this problem  is  loathsome for Sherlock but his admiration is connected with Sherlock overcoming it.
John comes to his senses and turns to Sherlock: “How are you? Sick? Dizzying?”  The ‘regime of security’ is off and the ‘regime of doctor” is on in a moment. “Do you need my help?”
"Black, two sugars," John can barely hear Molly’s words but he nods and takes jezve. He measures some coffee with a spoon, pours water, he moves automatically. John tries to convince himself that it is just one more coffee for a just one more client but suddenly he drops two leaves of mint  before giving Molly the  cup. “It doesn’t really mean anything, it has not any  influence for the taste of the coffee, it is just an expression of his favour,” all these thoughts must assures himself but his heart beating takes a pause when Molly puts the order on the table and leaves Sherlock  quickly. John sees Sherlock turns round surprisingly and his eyes are looking for John and then he takes his cup and  his lips taste the drink. For a moment they stare  each other and then a client comes to John and after his leaving with another cup of conpanno  John watches Sherlock is busy with his smartphone. But at least he didn’t protest or wasn’t offended and didn’t run away far from John’s attention. John feels good and  he sings the Beatles’ song about the walrus till they call it the end..When  Sherlock leaves, the wind rushes into the café one more time to play with the laps of his coat and it adds some infernality to all his image. John looks at Sherlock’s back and smiles. He smiles foolishly and lovingly. But certainly, it doesn’t mean anything.
Victor shows him an indecent gesture in answer under the bar stand and John becomes red. John is angry.
And in the evening a nice nurse named Clara sent by the social service   and a doctor comes to inform, that the necessary medicine was found in the  special stock of the hospital.  John is deeply surprised by Sherlock’s acquaintance abilities and , being sure that Harry gets on with Clara, he returns home.  He supposes that during his absence he lost his work, his place in the university and  his place in the room. But instead of scandal Mike demonstrates his  sympathy and asks about Harry. With a great fear John asks his questions about the university and Mike answers that  everything is OK, John’s absence was covered by Mike and lections can be easily  caught up as, frankly speaking,  John hasn’t lost a lot.  When John asks why Mike  knew about his problems with Harry, Mike answers that  it was John’s friend from Chemistry Faculty who came to him in the day of the crash and warned him about the situation. John is shocked with  the revealed   circumstances  and fins his charge. His phone is alive and John sees an endless number of missed calls and messages from Molly. John opens the last one and reads that  he was given a short vacation for the time of being with Harry  and he is welcome to return to his work anytime it is possible for him. Surely John guessed about  the reason but he calls Molly and she also says that Sherlock warned them about Harry and her hospitalization. John is angry and pleased at the same time.
“Are you driving?” John starts and hardly keeps the ristretto in his hands. He quickly gives the change to the client and looks for Ted. John’s eyes asks Ted to  help and replace him. John feels Sherlock’s  glance with all the surface of his skin.
“Your face. Now.” John thinks he looks like a maniac but he can’t cope with it and examines the scratch on the left  Sherlock’s cheekbone with great expectancy.
“What?” Johns bleed lips stretches in a  light smile.”I t happened  en route to your home. They weren’t lucky…”
John is embarrassed and  breathes out loud. Sherlock puts all his medicines back and John understands that it is high time to leave . But he doesn’t want to leave Sherlock and this cozy, in spite of the mess, living room. The second armchair is so attractive but who John Watson is to  be a burden. He doesn’t have any reason to stay at the flat in baker Street. And even his ribs are calm and demonstrate that they aren’t broken at all.  Sherlock stops making himself  busy with the kit  and glances at John and John can’t understand his emotions.  John makes himself to stand up and says with the most false smile he can  put on his face:
John feels his tongue frozen but he hears the tones in his phone as nobody is waiting for his gratitude.
"Oh, you’re mistaken," answers John in a low voice as he tries not to get attention of other  customers,  "you gave me.."
“Hello.  I’m sorry I disturb you… But I need your help… I don’t know what to say…. Just… please, I worry about him….” Murmurs John and understands that he talk rot.
“Of course not,”  grins Victor. There are no clients in the café and he is lounging on the chair and  is playing the oracle. “ I can give you  a magic tablet.”
“I… Me…” murmurs John, trying to go him round and he really doesn’t know what to say but Sherlock  doesn’t let him go and needs no words to understand.
The shift in the café passes too slow. The text book of anatomy seems to be written in Martian  language and John can’t concentrate and can’t understand a word. Victor isn’t very adequate today, maybe he has taken something, thinks John, observing his hurried breath,  disposition to sweating, very suspicious feverish shining of his eyes, and miotic pupils.
Next morning Harry comes to consciousness. Doctors are sure that it is a miracle. John is just happy. His sister cries and heaps unprintable words in turn. But the problems don’t want to disappear.  They need some expensive medicines and an orderly approved nurse. And Harry needs a rehabilitation clinic . John gives way to despair and understands he has no way except Sherlock’s cars. Being  embarrassed and having his cheeks red he takes the card but there is only a phone number there. Without any name. John  feels foolish and can’t imagine how to begin his talk. But after the second dial tone he hears the male voice. It is the voice he heard in the café. It was the strange man with umbrella. John can’t say a word. He wants to hang the phone up but the strange man with the umbrella  doesn’t give him any chance:
It doesn’t mean John has any practice of his profession but he has a good experience of living in a bad district .
Molly nods her head and returns to watching Sherlock. At last she says: "He doesn’t look at you as the queen of Britain."
A stranger visitor come to the café like a prima to the stage of Covent Garden , resting his umbrella-cane he  stops at the door for a moment. Maybe, he’s waiting for applause. An expensive suit, ideal shining shoes (in spite of this wind and weather, notes John), his like look like he has just left the barber-shop – everything shows that he is a prosperous and successful man and he is completely the other-world alien for their little students’ café. The man looks around the cage and his eyes stops at John and a minute  later he is openly examining him with a great interest.. Then he nods to himself as if  he has taken a decision and moves to the bar . John gives him a look of inquiry having great doubts such man can decide to have a cup of coffee here but he says in a powerful studied voice:
“Oh, he came and he was completely  beaten, his face was just one large bruise,” whispers she, “  He has lost some frontal teeth. Have you any ideas who can be blame? I think that there were his drug addicted pals. Do you know that he spread this muck.” John nods when it is necessary but he is too busy thinking if Sherlock comes here today. Surely and unboubtful  that there is not any reason for Sherlock to come here today but his silly heart has a big hope for meeting. Certainly, Sherlock is absent. Moreover, when John returns to his bedroom, he finds  his bed free. There is no food or  the note on the bedside table, the trousers are  put on the table. It seems to John that Sherlock has borrowed his T-shirt as his  clothes can’t be worn now.  And there is not any  other sigh that Sherlock was here. John sighs  bitterly and  gives Mike the juice which was bought instead of taken back. Mike doesn’t understand anything. Johns goes to bed without changing the bed sheet  and pillow slip . Even if is only an illusion that the bed keeps Sherlock’s  smell, John  absolutely doesn’t want to lose it.
Sherlock’s  keeping silence and John makes a step back realizing one more time that he’s imagined a lot of nonsense  and trifles which can’t ever be true.
"If I were you I wouldn’t insist on it, " the calm and a little bit muffled voice is heard over the crowd.
John didn’t count to have any explanations but having heard them he takes a chocolate doughnut with some chocolate  icing  from the glass case and gives it to Sherlock. Sherlock shakes his head but john feels his  rightness and strength, says strictly:
“Yes,” answers John and he is astonished that there is one person except Sherlock with such great brain, but surely they are six of one and half a dozen of the other  unlike stupid John. “Could you tell me his address?” For all  this time John hasn’t ever visited Sherlock as Sherlock didn’t invite him and John was too timid to ask himself – he thought he was happy as it was.
“it is not a charity,” says Sherlock quietly  and looks at him carefully, “ As everything is paid by British Government. You can’t really imagine the amount of things we can have according to the laws.”
“Fine,” nods John. “Under other conditions I could recommend you to take a shower but it’s really better to go to bed now as you are devilishly tired. I’ll give you some juice.” John is sure that Mike has a packet of orange juice. “Lie down,” this is a place to take a little pause as John is afraid of Sherlock’s  objection and  intention to leave this place quickly.
“you have fought,’ says Sherlock in accusatory tone  and  his thumb  tender cleans the running blood .
His vile manners has returned  after that memorable case and he is rude with clients and mocks at his colleagues John gazes around surprisingly but the only thing he sees is the curly head bended over the smart phone.
“Harry, please, just stop the car and tell me where you are. I’ll be there in a moment,” he sais firmly and hopes Harry can hear him. Ok, she has heard him  and she laughs
“I would come  in any case ,” whispers he, “I am very gratitude  to that man with the umbrella (you gave me his business card after the accident with Harry, do you remember?) and he said me your address.”
" Well, the Queen of England allows us to  admire with her, she can even stops and gives a pat on the cheek to a schoolboy who is deeply in love with her but she is always far and inaccessible."
John wants to give him a smack but he holds himself in check as he doesn’t want to lose the job. Sherlock make the first swallow and it seems to John that Sherlock  smiles looking at him. This moving of the corner of his lips can be called smile, can’t it? John decides to take it this way and he begins to make a classificatory of Sherlock’s smiles. Doing this he tries to do his best not to feel like a schoolgirl in love.
The reality can’t be worse. Reached the place, John finds some policemen and Harry’s crashed car. He can’t see Harry but there is a big puddle  of blood, covered with a thin layer of broken glass.
"Why is that? " the fatty is surprised. He turned to the voice and now he is looking at Sherlock  who is two heads taller.
“I’ve got to dash,” he says to nobody and forgets about Sherlock though it’s  Sherlock who is the main sense and determining factor of his life and all his thought and deeds are oriented and devoted to him. “Molly, I’ve got to dash.”
Oh, John would like to tell him a lot: that he shouldn’t  neglect his health, he mustn’t   take any crimes detections without thinking, he can’t follow the criminals alone, he’s not allowed to… But John’s acting like a careful mother with her good-for-nothing and naughty child: he is keeping silence and watching Sherlock eating the doughnut and having some coffee, and his checks are flushing red eyes are closing. Sherlock is weak, but he looks better. John thinks that he must have a good rest, sleep well, have a good meal – some broth and, of course, to have a cup of tea, but John doesn’t say a word as he remembers to keep the distance. Sherlock opens his eyes as if he was roughly woken up.
“Oh, no. No,” Sherlock says  quickly, hastily, taking the box away and putting the first aid on the table. “I haven’t slipped down. I was close…” he corrects himself. “I was very close. I didn’t hear you ringing. I was going to buy a doze and found you. I  felt…bad.. awful. I thought  you had some relations with that girl. I was going mad. I had to forget….” Sherlock isn’t able to speak this phrase till the end but John understand who is he speaking about. “and I was ready to return to my past…”  And he frowns and turns around. Sherlock takes his coat off and drops it on the floor, and his hands – they are so nervous and he is trying to keep them busy preparing some cotton and bandages and he doesn’t look at John. And it is nice because John has a lot of tender words not to be heard but to open his heart.
It doesn’t mean anything though John can’t stop dreaming about Holmes during his lectures, he can’t stop envisaging his face and looking  forward   for meeting  him.  John makes guesses about  Sherlock’s coming during the lecture on  inorganic chemistry , and draws a men in a long coat with a shock of black hair  instead of pediculas humanius during histology. John doesn’t like his drawing and , with a great unpleasure, he returns to the microscope. Mike Stemford has a look into  John’s notebook and nods his head surprisingly. John hardly cuts it fine to finish his task till the end of the  lecture and he runs to his work without saying goodbye. He can’t be late as he need this money badly. He lives  from hand to mouth, his scholarship isn’t worth speaking about and sometimes he has to give some money to Harry as she is in low water . Her jobhunting doesn’t give any results. He doesn’t have enough for himself but it goes without saying that his sister has  priority in this question.. John often dreams to have one more job but it means that he will not be able to study and he can’t allow himself to lose the uni. He is just a boy from an unhappy and disadvantaged family and he can’t lose the only chance to change his future  and achieve something. At work John tries to stop his obsessional  thoughts about Sherlock. He automatically  pours the coffee, and gives Molly his smiles, and successfully  ignores Victor’s grumbling.
An evil and unpleasant incident  happens on Wednesday. John head is going round due to an endless number of clients. The lines of cappuccino, latte and espresso are made in some kind of trance, without any thoughts or words. He is working on automatic pilot.
-If you have any problems with inorganic chemistry, I could explain some themes, just tell me, - adds Sherlock and John is puzzled what it is all about. John is thinking and Sherlock is looking at him attentively. John is eager to say “Yes, help me, please!” but his tongue doesn’t obey him  and  he can’t say a word. They are staring at each other for a long time then Sherlock winces  and bites his lip, then he turns round and is going to the exit. John desperately  looks at his back   and speaks as if a good fairy has removed the spell back and murmurs:
John nod’s as he hasn’t any forces to argue with Victor. Staying at the café alone he is still stupidly looking at the door, closed after Sherlock, mechanically washes the cup and  brushes the crumbs off. It’s high time to close the café. He must  clean the café up but John is worried. Sherlock is rather weak and John thinks that it was a bad idea let him leave alone. If John’s company is not good for Sherlock,  he had to take a cab for him. John takes off his apron, throws the towel away. He runs around the café: switches off the lights,  closes the blinds, takes off his key, calls to the security,  sets on the alarm and rushes out into the street through the private entrance and watches around for sometimes. The trouble in his heart is growing and it doesn’t give any place to John’s pain. He doesn’t know why is he so scared  and  troubled. But it seems that he follows the third force and he passes the rubbish bins and runs towards the dark lane, the place where students like to have a quick sex and junkies  have their dozes.  He hears  strange noises and scuffle. Full of the worst  forebodings,  John darts off , running to the strange sounds.
" Between us? " John astonishment is sincere and bitter at the same time. – Molly, there can’t be any “us”. It’s a wrong word. There is an interest and  admiration from my side and a cold condescension of  the British queen to her vassals from his side. Nothing more.
John hardly turns aside  and smiles at Victor  laughing demonstratively loudly at his words about a football match. To tell the truth John doesn’t like football, but for some reason he listens  to Victor attentively and nods, nods, nods. The wind, rushing into the café and the empty table near the window with the forgotten cup of  the coffee, which wasn’t even tasted demonstrates, that Sherlock has gone.  Molly purses her lips and John feels that he is tired badly.  Nothing  goes right  till the end of his work-shift. He makes his excuses to Molly for the cancelled going to the cinema and    escapes from his work as if it is  a prison. The whole evening he is walking about the district and he is beating  the rain without any capuche on and dreaming to catch a cold to death. And it is Sherlock’s face that he constantly has in his eyes , who watching John as if he betrayed  him. John knows that he has done everything in a right way but the heavy pain that lived in his heart, is slithering and poisoning all his chest. That moment John is the unhappiest man all over the world. And only having his face wet  because of rain,  allows himself to cry trying not to notice the tears under the rain drops. But his chest is shaken with sobs and he sensed that he is a miserable loser.
“Mine. You’ll be mine. Bitch. Move your legs and you will like it. As daddy Victor has a big tool, it will be enough for your asshole…”
John turns to look at Molly. He is sad as he understands that this client is a sample of people, who will prove his right with froth at the mouth. They will never excuse even if it is proved that they are wrong.
John quickly tells about the medicine and the nurse but doesn’t say about the click. Eventually, the doctors didn’t persist on it.
Drunken Harry has kissed with a street lamp and if the speed hadn’t been so high,  everything would have passed without any problems. But now John isn’t told anything in the hospital, where Harry was take, and he has to listen just duty phrases that the operation is in process. John is sitting between a guy with a broken hand who is  as pale  as a sheet (he was given an analgesic but his hand wasn’t  treated yet) and a fat woman who is always snuffling. She has something wrong with her face and John is trying not to stare but reminds all  skin diseases he has learned. The  preoccupied and anxious doctors are passing by without any word and John feels his heart dying of trouble – he supposes they don’t tell him something important. It might have been the small hours of the morning when a tired doctor calls his and Harry’s surname. John runs to him and watches carefully every miming of his face (he is copying Sherlock but doesn’t understand it) and doesn’t listen his  words trying to imagine her condition due to the doctor’s face air. But  it’s high time to pull himself together and he has to ask to repeat. The doctor willingly begins his explanation one more time and doesn’t show any  negative or surprised emotions to the some kind of stupidity of his patient’s relative.  Harry’s condition can’t be named fine. She has a  cerebral injury and she is in coma now and nobody can give any guarantees that this will end well. The doctor asked if there are any her  instructions for this case but John  dashes aside. He is not ready to sentence Harry to anything without any fight. John is allowed to come into her box. Having all her hair covered with a bandage, Harry looks like a sleeping child. John sighs with relief as he is sure that this the problem Harry will be able to manage with. She has a noise and stormy youth and her head was beaten a lot of times. It’s rather  hard and strong. But in the morning he is  depressed as nothing changes and Harry is still lying without any movement.  The equipment of life support are working and sometimes a comes to get Harry on a drip. Nobody tells John to leave the box and he can’t find any force to go out. He is speaking to his sister, reminding her different funny stories from their childhood and even doesn’t  allow himself to go to the loo as it is a risk to  miss a moment of her returning to conscious. His phone is out of charge and he has forgotten his charge at home. He ought to call to the café and let them know he will not come today and say something calm to Mike Stamford who surely is in trouble about him. But John doesn’t do anything  but he is sitting near Harry, having her hand in his hands and praying, praying, praying. They are alone in this life. She is his only relative.
"He is from another world, "  concludes John. He notes the expensive clothes  and the proud posture. "He is not for us, isn’t he?"  He turns to Molly to be sure that it was exactly that she tried to say.
“Yes, I was offended, I am sorry,” John mutters under his breath  and tries to avoid Sherlock’s eyes. “I saw you at the place of the crime. I was walking in the park… Occasionally passing by… I stopped to have a word with you but you even  didn’t turn your head,” John sighs as he suffers  this come- down  one more time  and then he adds, “Now I know that you just hadn’t heard me, but  that time it  was really hurt. Forgive me, please.”
Their father died when they were too little to remember him. And their mother had a wanton lifestyle changing her boyfriends like they were toys. It  doesn’t mean  that all of them were bad: blond Bill taught John to fight, left-handed Paul (It  close to Paul McCartney laughed they) taught him to play the guitar, Sam, his was as bold as an egg, told and demonstrated the first aid. But the last was a  real monster. He beat their mother and  pinned Harry in  corners  John supposes that these sexual harassment was the real cause of Harry’s   lesbianism) and  looked at John in a strange way. These looks made John to be outside as long as he could as he clearly understood that one day he would hit this  pile of shit and wouldn’t be able to stop until his death. That was the measure of John’s hate. The same rage was given to Victor.
“You don’t have  enough time for everything, do you?” Victor asks  in a kind voice. “ What do you do at nights?”
“No, Sherlock, it’s not your fault, “ he tries to reassure Sherlock. “it was just a pure accident, you know.”
John can’t believe him:”I cried as an elephant  in rut/ Only a deaf man  couldn’t  hear me.” His voice is full of  distrust and  resentment.
Frankly speaking, nothing has changed: Sherlock types something in his phone and John makes coffee but sometimes their eyes find each other and there is no aggression in their mute dialogue  but only friendship and supporting. As if one of them asks: “Are you here?” And the other answers:”Yes, I am. I am here.”
The last boyfriend destroyed their family as he beat their mother to death, was close to  rape Harry and only John’s absence save him from the jail as he would  killed the  stinker without any doubts. Certainly, the rat was caught and landed in  prison, but it didn’t help neither  their dead mother nor them. It was a kind woman, their neighbor, who  saved  them from the orphan asylum.  John and Harry lost everything except each other. And It was harry to be John’s constant in all this damned world until Sherlock came. John couldn’t leave her alone, couldn’t let her die.
“He?”  John’s cheeks are flushing.  He hesitates but stretches his hand to the cup of drink he made a moment ago, returned by Molly. His eyes find Sherlock’s eyes  and John winks being shocked with Sherlock’s frowned brows and angry look. John  knocks the hot coffee back and tastes nothing but takes a slice of lemon and eats it with peel. Molly sighs with sympathy and maybe it is the first time in John’s life he sees Victor trying  to be friendly:
Sherlock hasn’t visited  the café for three  days. And it if enough time for John to have all his nervous gone for pieces and imagine the most awful and unbelievable things.  A red and kind gay named Ted is hired to café instead of Victor. Ted studies philology. Ted likes Molly from the first sight and she blushes and embarrasses nicely.  John has a private talk with Ted and warns him , as if Molly was his sister,  that  “if you hurt her feelings, you will have big problems with me”. Surely such talks didn’t give any results with Harry’s girl-friends but Ted is rather impressed and swears that he is really serious about Molly. Molly smiles, watching them returning after “having a smoke” (as they don’t smoke both)  and John is happy – if Molly stops giving Sherlock here adoring sights, he will have one rival less. Sherlock! John can’t say that he is sure he will return back some day but he hopes to see him. It was something special between them, wasn’t it? Sherlock spent a night in John’s bed and he even has some proofs as his sheet and pillow are still keeping his smell.
“I must examine you,” says John gently as if he asks a permission and Sherlock nods in agreement. John checks the ribs with light touches. “Thanks God, they aren’t damaged,” his smile slightly appears on his lips.
But Sherlock leaves without turning back and all his figure demonstrates that he will not offer his help twice and he wants everyone to react his words immediately. If you are so foolish that you can’t make your own tongue to obey, you can stay alone. John is ready to burst into tears but another client helps to return back into the world full of latte and cappuccino. The information about  the drugs addiction in Sherlock’s anamnesis doesn’t disturb John at all.
He returns to the café, makes excuses to Clara and send a message to Sherlock: “We must have a talk.” Then he writes the next one: “You‘ve taken everything in a wrong way.” And the third:”This is Clara. She’s Harry’s girlfriend. She is a lesbian.” But the third SMS isn’t received as Sherlock has switched off his phone. John is in despair. But he doesn’t know what to do. Where can he find Sherlock as he doesn’t’ want to be found? He has to wait. Only wait.  He has been waiting for two days and it is too much for him. He forgets about his study and takes additional work in the café in order to catch Sherlock. Bu he is absent. John is wires. He troubles about Sherlock. He is ready to run about the whole city but it is better to begin with Sherlock’s home.  The only tiny problem is that John doesn’t know his address.  And John makes a step he would never do if could think soundly and sensible. He takes the card and phones too the man with an umbrella.
“You should change the clothes and get warm, “ he says resolutely and takes John’s hand and pushes him up. John stands up and follows him and he doesn’t have any thoughts  if it good or not.
“Maybe  I’m the wrong man to all  these feelings and emotions. I have no ideas how to show my interest to anyone.  Emotions, relationships… I ‘m always getting lost in these  spheres. And beside this I had a very unpleasant experience.” Sherlock speaks fast as he  doesn’t want to forget to say something important.
"It’s clear, "  John understands nothing but he doesn’t want to be named stalker and stops his little research..
At the café John is effusively polite with the clients, discuss the weather with Molly and the repertoire of the cinemas. Molly is so surprised with his invitation to the cinema that agreed and now they are making their film selection. John beats the band trying not to look at the entrance. He isn’t waiting for Sherlock but he is obviously nervous. Molly casually tells him that there was no Sherlock there without John. John is trying to demonstrate an indifference , shrugs his shoulders and suggests an art house movie produced by Darren Aronofsky. Before saying yes Molly fixedly and intently stares at John but he just shrugs his shoulders  and  cites an anecdote. Molly turns aside.
Sherlock wants to say something but he just nods instead and he is scanning John with his  opaque and painful glance.
Sherlock  is standing up to him but he doesn’t have enough forces. And Victor  has beaned him with something as John can see some blood on Sherlock’s thin white neck which seems to be black in the damned dim light of the street lamp. The following  looks like a dream. John furiously attacks Victor and beats him with primitively  ancient cruelty. He beats  him till he bleeds, till crackle in joints. He can’t stop, can’t stop at all. Sherlock is free and he is sitting on the ground, his hands are on his head. And Victor looks like a puppet, his teeth are chattering, the blood drops are flying around him,  he has forgotten about any resistance just he is trying to protect  his head  and whining. But John can’t stop beating, revising all his life  in  disadvantaged district of London. Harry and he would get into scrapes when they could rely only on their fists and feet. Surely it is another situation now. But John ought to punish this bustard who dared to attempt on Sherlock’s life and honour.
John wakes up and he is rather cheerful and vigorous. But Sherlock is still sleeping and it seems that he didn’t move at all. It seems to John that he doesn’t breath but some moments later he hears  Sherlock’s puffing. John spends some time watching Sleeping Sherlock but then he calls himself to order as he thinks it is not right to stare at somebody who is unconscious. The point that it was exactly that he was planning to do at night doesn’t mean anything for John and he feels no embarrassment at all.  He prepares for his lectures:  takes a shower, shaves (not very carefully), get dressed, takes his note-books and manuals. Before leaving he writes a note for Sherlock to inform him that he can stay in his room and sleep as long as he wants  and  wrestles with himself as he is eager to touch Sherlock’s cheek. John warns Mike about Sherlock  during  histology  and spends  all anatomy lecture dreaming about him, tries to guess what  Sherlock is doing during physiology and misses all physics  - just tosses it off. He has to collect his thoughts during inorganic chemistry – recently  many bad memories and emotions were connected with it. John decides to cut Latin classes and runs home. By the way he goes to the canteen and buys three doughnuts and a  coffee for Sherlock. John hopes he is still there and hasn’t leave his room .O, yeah, Sherlock  is sleeping and this situation touches John a lot. He put the food  on the nearest bedside table, tears the unnecessary note and  answers Harry’s phone call. It’s not a pleasant talk as Harry is heavily drunk and she sobs and complains about her girl-friend in a tipsy voice. John understands that he has no possibility to  be in his personal heaven near sleeping Sherlock and writes one  more note for him. Than he leaves home to look for Harry  and to drag her out from the bar.
John has so many variants to answer: “cause I love you”, “cause you’re handsome and I want you to be my only one”, “because I wake up with your name”, “because all my dreams are about you”, “because  you are what I think about when I masturbate in the shower…”
He sees Victor’s  gloating grin  and Molly’s pitying look. The clients begin to talk to each other discussing the situation and the fatty adds in quick temper:
Sherlock listens to him with a strange air and nods in agreement but his face clearly demonstrates  his doubts as if he asked about other things. Then he just looks another way and clasp the given  clothes to his breast. John wants to stay and help him with changing, to do something more but he goes to the shower instead. After having a cold shower John returns and see Sherlock sleeping dressed in his T-shirt and trousers, with his hands under his cheek and his knees pulled to his chest. Surely John’s trousers are too short for him and the T-shirt has ridden up and John cat see a couple of bruise left by Victor’s fists. John thinks that he will keep awake for all night long guarding Sherlock but his eyes immediately close and he falls asleep without any dreams.
“You ‘ve a large mirror behind you, John,”  he says and smiles warm and tenderly, ”You are very unobservant!” And while John is  digesting his words Sherlock asks, “May I ask you something as we are doing with some blank spots in our relationships?” John nods as he is  still shaken  and Sherlock takes this as an agreement: “What were you so offended with when you refused to make coffee for me?  Am right that you were offended?”
Oh, I've finished. This is my favourite chapter which made to begin all this work. I hope you will like it as much as me. Enjoy)
John sighs and returns to the manual on human’s anatomy which he tries to read  when there is no clients in the café. But his not able to concentrate as his thoughts are gathered around Sherlock.
John’s heartbeat is twice faster as it must be (because strong coffee  is not good for the weak from not getting enough sleep and overworked body) John doesn’t answer back to Victor but nods at the textbook.
"Yeah, " confirms Molly, "he has free schedule or distant education, I don’t know exactly. Sometimes he goes to the university but he doesn’t attends any lectures. He doesn’t need them," she makes a vague  gesture to  demonstrate the superlative level of Sherlock’s knowledge.
“I really don’t listen without my aids. But when I was going out to buy a dose I had to put them on. I’m sorry.”
-Hi, I’m John from the café,-  he says in a hoarse due to joy and trouble  voice , -do you remember me? – Sherlock doesn’t turn round and keep silence. You have offered  me to help a little with inorganic chemistry,- John takes a pause  and hopes to see any reaction for his words but Sherlock is standing still looking somewhere in front of him.
“Let’s go. I’ve called a cab,’ says Sherlock and attentively stares at John.”Would you like me to go with you?”
“So, John, what do you think?” Sherlock repeats his question and returns John’s attention to the dead body on the floor.
Last time Harry often quarrels with her girl-friend and spends all her free time in bars, being drunk to death. And she  meddles in   John’s student life as he must look after her in different clubs, sits near until she falls asleep and not let her choke in her own vomit. John is a good brother and he can’t  tell her to go elsewhere. He tries to influence her  but Harry  never pays any attention to opinions of other people and she mangles her life and brother’s one. John neglects inorganic chemistry: a lot of missing lections and  failed lab works.  Somehow or other, he copes  with other subjects (due to his good schooling) but the problems with inorganic chemistry  means only the possibility of sending down.  John doesn’t sleep for three nights in a row, falls asleep during Latin and is drowsy at his job. There is a note-book with tasks and nibbled pen in front of him among the napkins, coffeepot and cezves.  John hardly makes him return to the  data of  the example but  his brain is indifferent and disregard – all it needs is  dreaming. John  rubs his eyes and misses Sherlock’s appearance. Being in a fog of exhaustion he makes coffee and  lays some lemon slices on the saucer. Molly takes the order and John feels he is falling asleep.
