In the morning, Rumlow picked Steve up at the SHIELD HQ. They started towards New York with just the two of them in the car, since Lowell and Madden would join them there. Rumlow’s rundown of their task included a lot of unnecessary commentary and was delivered in the most derisive tone possible. No matter what, Steve seemed to be unable to get on the man’s good side, and something within him was relieved about that.
Still, at the same time, Steve had expected Tony to be better, to get the results, have the solutions, to make the stuff happen that no one else could. Why? Because history showed that Tony could just do the impossible, and he made it look easy. But now Steve was starting to understand how much fight had gone into creating and keeping up that image.
“I need to be on the right missions.” The idea of working for Hydra left a bad taste in his mouth but they needed information, and currently, Steve was doing jackshit to get it. “I’m sure I’m on the right team — Rumlow is, or will be, Hydra soon, but they are not taking me along to the Hydra missions.”
Steve simply sat there for a moment, trying to get the gears in his head turning again. “What about Lowell?” he asked, even though he knew that he should just decline.
An image of ivory skin criss-crossed artfully by a wide multi-thread dark rope appeared before Tony's eyes. It was a stunningly beautiful picture up until a split second later when Tony realized that it was not Stevens whom he'd imagined at all. The ever-present ache in Tony’s chest twinged. The perfect likeness between the two men had to be imaginary though. Aside from the obvious body type, Tony didn't even know how Steve would look naked, not all the way. Besides, he didn't want there to be any likeness in the first place.
“Am I interrupting a date or something?” He smirked back at Steve. “You forgot the candles, Stevens.”
Yes to everything, it seemed. Even Lowell hadn’t said no to him often. Was that some kind of a warning sign? No. Tony didn’t think so; not in this case. Andrew Stevens seemed to be enthusiastic and perhaps somewhat naive, so Tony would just need to be careful. It was just sex after all. They’d fuck it out and move on.
Tony grinned. “I like the sound of that.” He did. Either the man wasn't in pain or he was enjoying it. Tony was good with either. “God, you look fine. Feel fine too. Will soon be stretched on me like a glove. Pretty thing, aren’t you?”
Steve had said that, and he was regretting it now, terribly. He wished he could just tell Rumlow to return to his post.
He reached the hemline of the dress and his thoughts flashed back to this morning and the day that had followed. “For all your nonchalance about the leaked nudes and sex-videos and paid interviews with one-nightstands, you can’t ask for this directly. Can you? You only can tease and make bawdy innuendos and be as offensive as possible.” He only brushed up against the lace and then trailed his fingers down the stockings again. “But one touch and you wilt like a flower.” When he reached the foot, he let a nail flick over the sole before changing sides. “You’re so hungry for it.” The feeling of nylon on those smooth thighs surprised Steve for the second time today. Back at the hem again, he stopped. There was no breathing, no moans and no sighs, of course. But Steve knew that all that Tony wanted was for him to move his fingers under that skirt like he had done earlier that day.
Feeling utterly defeated, getting to his workshop at the other side of Manhattan seemed like an insurmountable task, but when Tony thought of all the people in the future who were turned into mindless automatons and the last of the resistance he’d left behind, he managed to get to his feet. In the hall, he reached out to take the car keys, but a wave of nausea made him sway on his feet.
This was a security detail, and Steve was supposed to be too stupid for most of it, right. “It just seemed like a thing we should do,” he tried to hedge.
Tony was skipping two steps at a time as he covered the last flight. He felt like a school boy sniggering about giving his teacher the slip, so grinning, he pushed the door to the car park level—
Some heads turned when they came back to the main hall, but no one seemed interested enough to keep staring. They made it out of the mansion and into the car, and Steve was glad that Rumlow was driving because somehow the world kept on skipping tracks. Despite having scrutinized them both at first, now Rumlow didn’t even have a lame joke to offer. Steve almost wanted him to say something. Maybe the world would start making sense again if he still felt like punching Rumlow for anything he articulated.
“Two weeks, okay?” Tony tried for an upbeat tone. “I’m almost finished. Two weeks and, I swear, the designs are going to be on your desk."
Although his lips smiled back, Obie’s gaze remained cold. “That. And the rifles. And about you avoiding me.”
The next eight hours passed with Steve reading a book and Anthony behind the screen, working. Steve knew because this was Tony's thinking face. The face he'd not seen in years. To prevent himself from staring, he had to turn his back to Anthony.
“Popsicle.” It was the first thing that came to mind, and Steve tried to not think of the version of him that was still lost and frozen.
Back at the apartment, Steve thought about preparing dinner. He wasn’t sure if the incident earlier today would make Anthony refuse that bit of care from Stevens, though. In a gamble, he ordered spaghetti alle vongole from La Bocca, and when it arrived, Steve set the food on the plates and went to put one down in front of Tony.
Did Obie (or was it someone else?) really think Tony would fall in love with her if they kept inventing potentially dangerous situations for him to cower behind her figurative skirts? Maybe this time they would even send somebody in for Lowell to dispose of? Could be fun.
The familiar stab of helpless anger is followed by intense longing. He rubbed his sternum as if it were just a phantom pain from the surgery after he removed his arc reactor, not the fractured emptiness in his very being. The image of the last time he ever saw Steve flared before his mind’s eye, and he clenched his jaw.
Captain America.” The stare that Tony earned for that was more that of a hurt—and therefore feral—animal. “I guess there’s some history there, but I’m not complaining about your Black Widow either.”
Well, it would be better for his dick if the hole was somewhat lubricated, he reasoned with himself. He added lube, pushed the finger back in and then up to another knuckle. Then he moved it back and forth, side to side, and in and out to loosen it a bit more. Andrew’s breath was unsteady and maybe it sounded more like pain than pleasure, but he didn’t tell Tony to stop, so he didn’t.
And as if to prove Tony’s point, Steve’s breathing does get heavier. He skates his hand up and down Tony’s sides, watching him like he can’t get enough of it. Tony rolls his hips. Steve has literally the keys to his sexual gratification, but Tony knows everything about Steve’s pressure points too. They are on the home stretch; not long and Tony will have his tally up to a hundred and Steve will unlock him, and he doesn’t know if he will be conscious for what comes after, but at least he’ll be done with it.
Surprised by being addressed after being completely ignored for the last ten minutes, Steve blurted out the first thing that came to his mind, “You have an office here?”
"Nah, all's good," Madden replied. "Egg’s not bothered me. No visitors, no phone calls. Been sitting in his bedroom since we arrived two hours ago."
The design was drawing itself. Tony could breathe and his mind was at peace. For once, so was his cock. St—
Tony blinked. There was food at his elbow. Why was there a plate of risotto on his desk? An untouched plate and still warm?
The wrapper tasted of nothing. There was nothing bad about the placement in itself, but the feeling in Steve's stomach from meekly allowing Tony to do whatever he wished was potent.
The moment they entered the apartment, he dropped his duffel and pressed Stevens against the door, their mouths fused together. Tony’s hands probed at his sides, gripped his hips and hair, pinched his nipples, got under Stevens’s clothes and for a little bit he could imagine that it was—
Steve figured it out right away. Stark trying to talk around him in circles hadn’t worked one bit. Of course, it hadn’t. But Stark didn’t stop it, not when Tony had told him to, not the first time and not the second. Almost as if he had more interests than to just distract them.
It was just a stupid threat — no way would Tony leave anyone tied up and unsupervised, but when Andrew turned over, his gaze was as full of pure adoration as if Tony was the sun and the moon and all that crap. Swallowing, Tony had to force himself to look away from the man.
“I’m going to do some work now,” Tony said. “You can get up or stay in bed, but I’d prefer for you to get dressed and entertain me with your presence in the living room.” He got up and started dressing. “If you do come, though, don’t expect me to pay you much attention. Alternatively, if you stay here, I might be tempted to tie your hands to the headboard because no way are you touching yourself before I allow it, is that understood?”
The box was still sealed, which didn’t hinder Steve from prying it open and tipping its contents onto the tabletop. Steve could not avoid looking at that horrible piece of plastic any longer.
While Tony’s cock strains against the cage, his body is melting into Steve’s embrace. The contradiction makes tears run over his face, hot against the skin, while he listens to his own heartbeat quiet down to the rhythm of Steve’s breathing.
People had told Steve that there was nothing they wouldn’t believe if he said it with his Captain America voice. This wasn’t that voice. It wasn’t coming from a place of conviction, of knowing. It was closer to a prayer, hoping for it to be true.
Rumlow said something sharp and Steve's look-a-like opened his mouth, closed it, and bowed his head in apparent deference.
Tony assumed she’d be looking for him on the upper levels where the SI management offices were located, so he ran up two floors and while whistling, walked calmly past the receptionist and out of the building. God bless his young body for doing all that without any significant strain.
Tony wandered towards the exit of the armory, deciding he needed another swipe from his backup flask before this all was going down. When he reached the door, he called back over his shoulder, “Steve will figure that charade out in no time. You'd better work fast.”
After twenty minutes, Tony resurfaced, his hair still wet and curling in all directions, sweats pulled on, the shirt clinging to his body. For a moment, he froze, staring at the mug that was already waiting for him in the living room, and then rounded on Steve. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Obie sighed and shook his head like one did while telling a child that they shouldn't eat so much candy.
Rumlow turned his head and examined Steve from head to toe. Steve knew he was on very thin ice and did his best to look genuinely confused and not worried. Or on the brink of fuming rage.
“We are here to impress the big guy. Not the fucking professional offspring that was lucky enough to not OD before his parents croaked.”
WARNING: In this chapter we are going explicit! YAY! But on the other hand: some of you might care that when Steve and Tony have sex for the first few times, Tony is not very nice. Not a dubcon, but unnegotiated kink for sure. Also muddled feelings. There are many reasons for why Tony is as he is, but keep in mind that it’s also Steve’s POV, so he might not see everything.
And it could have been  worse — he could have overshot and landed in his 17-year-old self or even earlier. He grimaced and rubbed at his sternum absently.
Decisively, Tony nodded to himself. He could do it. He had two stun-guns fixed to his wrists, he would have to put aside some time for MMA training or something… He could take a couple of thugs. “But I get to veto any of them,” he told his CFO. “If I don’t like them, they’re gone, you hear me?”
“Have you talked to the DOD?” Nonchalantly, Anthony swirled to the side, not looking at anyone in the room. “Do you really think they will
He came to a halt right in front of Steve. The feeling was foreign and familiar as if something were there and not there at the same time. Steve could only react by trying to relax his muscles that had coiled up into tense readiness. There was nothing dangerous here, only T— Anthony being spitting mad, but they would get through that.
Steve’s gaze snapped back to him, and he couldn’t keep his own eyes going wide with the feeling of getting caught.
“What the hell!” Reflexively, Tony slapped both of Andrew’s ass cheeks. “I said no touching, didn’t I?” he almost growled. He grabbed at Andrew’s hair with one hand, gripped his hip with the other and pushed in as hard as he could. “You come on my cock or not at all, got it?”
When Rumlow left, and Steve was positioned in front of Tony’s SI lab, he couldn’t stop fidgeting. The whole afternoon of doing nothing had put him on edge even worse than usual. Thinking only the major part of three seconds about it, he carefully knocked on the door, and pulled on the handle. Surprisingly, it was unlocked, and Steve peeked in.
He hadn’t been taking care of Anthony at all over the last few days, getting so much into his own head and his guilt that he'd forgotten everything else. Had Tony even eaten today? Steve had made a decision to take care of Anthony, and now he’d absolutely dropped the ball.
“Sorry, sir.” It still didn’t come easy, but he had gotten used to it over the recent years. “I needed your input on the weapon requisition for Mission Pegasus.”
“I’m ready. You ready?” Without looking at the man, Tony nodded as if he’d received a reply. “Good. Let’s go.”
“Not so big on arguing now, huh? Maybe the dress has taught you a lesson. Do you want to apologize? Make it up to me?” There was no answer. Steve didn’t expect one. “Maybe I’m done spending so much time and energy on you.”
Tony had left the gala early, despite the fact that he had needed to talk to more people, network. So that was an opportunity lost, but Tony was still just thinking about… Stupid. Excited like a kid with his first crush.
Tony had wanted to play with Andrew a fair bit before he indulged himself but he really couldn’t wait any longer, pulled his other thumb out too, quickly donned the condom and pushed his cock in as fast as he dared, as slow as he had to. The groan that filled his ears was his own but Andrew was pushing back and, with his eyes closed, Tony grabbed the hips and started moving.
“And if it does anyway, I will be here to shoot it. Otherwise I’ll be very quietly sitting over there.”
He debated with himself all the way down to the other apartment. It had only been a joke, a punchline with nothing behind it. So shortly after the death of his parents, Tony obviously had different things on his mind than alcohol, girls, and parties. Right? He was working almost all of his waking hours at the SI offices, the lab, and surprisingly, he was also working out a couple of times a week. He was actually so different from what the media and Tony himself had made Steve believe that he wasn’t sure what to think anymore. Maybe that was a stage of grief, and the partying would come later? Tony seemed to be extremely focused and driven as far as Steve could tell. And lost, an unbidden voice in the back of Steve’s head suggested.
“I know about how you punched Daniels because of some bimbo. And Stark is said to have a mouth on him.”
“Did you secure the room beforehand?” This was just a security detail for a twenty-one-year-old industry heir, nothing else. This was a reasonable question for Steve to ask.
Also, on this chapter I had really old comments from a D**sy which I suspect might be a real name and I am so, so sorry to have no idea now who you are! If anyone recognises themselves, you have me on Discord as WritingSesh - DM me!!
It was getting out of hand. Stevens was treating him like a child. The only reason Tony was tolerating it was… The food was good. That was all. And he needed to eat anyway.
His coping mechanisms had always been more varied than Steve's. Punching bags were not for him. He shouldn’t be thinking of that right now. He’d always preferred to escape mentally into his workshop, or fucking, or later, he had also liked eradicating the enemy one repulsor blast at a time. Drinking —
As long as it had to. Indefinitely. “Trying something new,” he replied shortly. “Now. Did you actually need to discuss something or can I get back to work?” Being blunt had always either worked with Stane best or backfired spectacularly. At least being subtle rarely helped, so Tony didn’t see the point in trying.
That wasn’t even a lie. He had only heard an exchange rapidly growing louder but just as he was able to make out the words “Stark Industries,” they had obviously remembered their surroundings and lowered their voices. So Steve’d had to come up with something immediately. The only plan he’d been able to think of was barreling in.
Steve knew he couldn’t just break Pierce's neck here and now. It would end his mission, maybe even get him killed, and the Chitauri would win. Again. But he still indulged in the thought. So much that he missed the next bit of the conversation.
Still, they had won the time they needed to figure out the last piece of data they needed. Then they hit the breaking point of their arrangement.
Tony turned back to his design. “Yes, thank you, Andrew.” He shuffled with the papers. “You can kneel here,” he added as if in an afterthought.
Numb with shock, Tony pulled his left arm out from under his body and propped himself into a slightly more upright position.
He pulled the covers up and rolled to his left to face it head-on. After another moment of hesitation, he reached out his right. His hand hovered over the small form and there was the thought of just pushing down pressing it further into the pillow with ever more force. Instead, he put his finger down at the base of its neck, feeling the white lace collar ruffle.
were the one to invite me here?” Peggy sounded amused. “But enough with the pleasantries. We don’t have much time.”
Steve tried to bend the doll’s arms, but there was no way to make it shrug. The face wouldn’t have fit the expression anyway.
Agent Lowell threw her bag into one of the bedrooms and Rumlow told Steve to take the ‘fucking bed near the door’ in the second bedroom because he had no need to be woken up every time Steve took a piss. Which meant that he trusted Madden more than Steve, but right at this moment, he didn’t care. He was still dreading and looking forward to meeting… Anthony.
“And there is the designated driver,” Lowell said. “If you want to continue your nanny routine maybe drive him around the block a few times to lull him to sleep. I heard it works very well for some toddlers, and I’m pretty sure he hasn’t slept again for forty-eight hours.”
His breath hitched, but he made himself finish the thought. Steve would want him to eat. So Tony would eat. And if the success of the plan depended on Tony making nice for now, then that’s what Tony would do. And if he was too frustrated for work, he would need to go to the gym.
Tony was silent for a moment, sipping at his coffee. Then he put the mug down. “Whatever. I’ll keep a professional distance from Lowell. She knows it’s over too.” He shrugged. “But that means no more posturing like what happened tonight because— Actually...” He turned to Steve inquisitively. “What did happen tonight?”
The way Tony kept looking at him had Steve’s blood rush in his ears. The smile was open, adoring, telling him to do whatever as long as he didn’t take his attention away from Tony. Steve laid his fingers on the tiny cock, teasing it with the barest touch possible.
Also I'll give bulletpoints of emotional development at the beginning of ch 6. So you can skip that last scene if you want.
After a little while, Tony leaned onto the counter, and without turning around, said, “This thing that we’ve been doing. It can’t happen again.”
I am sorry this took so long! Chapter 2 was unexpectedly difficult, but the third one should come along a lot quicker. Let's keep our fingers crossed!!
He opened the drawer on his desk. There were pens and papers and a hole-punch and god knows what else. He dug it all out. He was sure he had put it there. He pulled out the next one, shoveled everything onto the table but still nothing. The third one he drew out completely and up-ended it on the floor next to the chair that still lay as he had left it hours ago. Nothing.
“Go away!” Tony rasped, trying to stop his spiralling thoughts, but the snowball had been pushed downhill and —
Steve had to concede the point. Those rooms were nothing like this. The only thing that this office was probably good for was doing paperwork and even that might have looked out of place on the giant desk.
Tony looked at a few other journals, then finished his research without printing anything and they headed to SI.
Seconds passed while they looked at each other. Steve considered that smile and decided it was genuine. “You do look beautiful that way. No! You still can’t move your hands. Let me look at you.”
Steve snapped out of berating himself and looked up to where there was a small commotion. A grey-haired man had his hand on the upper arm of a middle-aged woman, almost dragging her towards the door. People around them were murmuring and looking around if someone else was going to do something.
“It was the brakes, you’ve seen the report, right?” Obadiah said more quietly, in a comforting manner. “And you did all you could to redesign them, didn’t you?”
Startled, Tony whirled around on his desk chair only to see the big hulking figure of his least favorite bodyguard.
Tony blinked. The bitter disappointment broke him in half and he folded, almost slipping down the wall he was leaning on. He didn’t look like Steve. He did, but he didn’t. Even if his bearing was pitch-perfect, it couldn’t be Steve.
The derision of the statement trickled through Steve’s intestines like hot caramel, burning but also addictively sweet. He stuck out his tongue, not expecting for Tony to place the still packed condom on it. “Hold that.”
“Better security, Tony. And I don’t mean hidden cameras to tell the police what your assailants looked like when it’s already too late. I mean real-life bodyguards that are actually nearby in case something happens.”
“How about I drive you home and you can catch up on some beauty sleep?” Steve suggested. Before Anthony could also start complaining, he added, “Like Mr. Stane suggested.”
Right. So he would have to be careful, but prolonging the wait would not benefit anyone. It was time to move the plan along. Soon he’d need to show his plans to his R&D people and start on production. A number of key components he would still have to order in various other overseas companies, though.
Then again, whatever he was working on, it would be among the weapons the next wars would be fought with, and Anthony undoubtedly knew it. Steve’s heart ached when he thought about how that fact would hurt Tony later. He’d once told Steve that if he could change one thing about his past, that would be stopping manufacturing weapons the moment he’d started out.
“I love how you need all your restraint to keep from writhing.” He mostly kept changing the pressure on Tony’s cock with his left while stroking himself with his right. “You don’t even know if it will bring you release in the end and you still do it. Because that’s its own reward, right? Seeing how you give me pleasure instead of chasing your own?” This was going too fast but Steve didn’t see how he could slow down anymore. He got Tony exactly where he wanted him, how he wanted him. He sped up his right.
“There are.” Steve was more or less done with his shower, so he was just standing there, letting the water run down his back. “I’ve seen the covert looks, and it’s not just the conversations I’ve been excluded from. Not all the team members are rotated equally. There are some missions that only a select group goes to, and me and a few other guys are always left out.”
That last part, at least, made Steve feel idiotically happy. Still, it felt out of character, so Steve couldn’t stop himself from asking him about it one night right when Anthony wanted to disappear into his bedroom again.
Mentally nodding to himself, Steve casually walked from the living room to the kitchen and back. The apartment was secure, he knew that. He strolled past Anthony’s bedroom door and stared at it. He stepped out to the balcony, then pulled the curtains back, closed and shut the door. Walked into the kitchen. His stomach grumbling reminded him that he hadn’t eaten since breakfast, so he pulled some stuff out of the fridge and started to fill up on calories. Anthony was safe, and Steve was okay.
Sighing, Tony opened another email, read it quickly and replied with only half his mind on it. Paperwork in his actual office at SI was even less inspiring than it used to be. Perhaps because there wasn't actually anything important that he could do. Not yet. One day, when Obie was booted out, SI would be his entirely and he would make changes. He would… take assistants for this routine correspondence and spend his time more meaningfully. He would hire Pepper. In two more years.
Tony’s business partner was waiting in a private room as expected, but it had two doors on opposite sides and a simple window. Steve entered, and Tony didn’t even try to argue, being swept into conversation with the older man.
Steve had no idea where the thought came from, but it seemed so much easier to accept at the moment than the fact that this was Tony. The boy was looking at Agent Lowell now, and the smile, twisting one side of the boy’s face up, felt like a gut punch. It was the smile that Tony used either to flirt or when he was challenging Steve. That was Tony; no denial at all possible.
The pain slammed into him, and Tony closed his eyes again. The feeling was familiar: a split second of wakefulness with a vague sensation of heaviness in his chest and then the sledgehammer of certainty that Steve was gone. Steve had been gone for almost a year now, and he was never coming back. It was okay. It would have to be — there was no alternative. Steve would want him to go on. To fight. To win. To live.
Instinctively, Steve opened his mouth again, raising his eyes to Tony’s, who stopped talking, squinting.
Steve did until the rigid slacks they had rented for the evening were spread painfully taut over his erection. His hands were in fists at his sides, unmoving as if tied there. Tony nodded, stepped forward, and slid his dick into Steve’s still waiting mouth. One hand came to rest in his hair at the back of his head. It was only a slight pressure, no real force but in Steve’s head there was nothing that Tony didn’t have control over.
“I apologize for my security detail. If the gentleman is alright, I would like to pay for a dinner at a restaurant of your choice for the both of you to make up for the ruined evening. I will have a talk with the brute here right away.” Simply nodding at the couple’s acceptance of the offer, he barked at Steve, “Follow me.”
He should cut that off at the legs. Just stand up and go to the kitchen, leaving Andrew to sit on his haunches. What would Andrew do? Would he protest? Or accept it in his serene state? Or maybe he’d get distressed and Tony would have to deal with a subdrop?
So he removed the jacket, the cummerbund and was glad to see that the button line on the dress shirt was fake, and it had a thin velcro closure behind. Shoes and slacks were gone just as fast.
And there it was. In the pages upon pages of accessories for the growing range of celebrity dolls, Steve found a french maid uniform. It was perfect.
“I don’t know.” Stark sounded dejected. He poked at some of the keys, entering new parameters. “He must have gotten lost when our universes collided.”
---> Bae, ASchmidts, and VTHX (who added the angst bit to the glove thing - this is a fantastic addition - TY!!).
“Why don’t you send Agent Stevens here with Rumlow on that special assignment?" Pierce's eyes turned contemplative. "See how he fares with something a little different from what your team usually does?”
“I told you it was just for physical relief; you consented.” Tony cringed internally at his own douchery. “I’m not sure what you want from me. I can’t take you on a date because you’re assigned to me and offering you gifts outright seems cheap… What else can I offer? And don’t pretend your feelings are engaged. I won’t believe it.”
Biting back another wave of nausea, he checked the tasers under his sleeves. Then, steeling himself, Tony looked into the peephole. The security detail. Serious, professional, non-confrontational.
Back in bed, Steve was staring at the ceiling. He’d crossed about every line he had ever drawn for this mission. His last mission. There was no one he would need to look in the eye afterwards and say, “I did this, and I would do it again.” If he wanted this world to have a fighting chance, that was his job. And here he was. This was where it had led him. As if God were testing his resolve.
For one, Rumlow was one of the people they knew for sure was a part of Hydra. The Avengers had found out as much when the Chitauri had revealed themselves, when Hydra had taken over the world. They had a few collaborators who went public with them and many more that stayed hidden. And with the shapeshifting, it was hard to tell who was Chitauri and who human. Not that it mattered because people who didn’t become collaborators didn’t usually live long enough to be proud of it. A few were exceptions, but only the ones who had the means to hide or could fight. But even Steve had to check out in the end. And by now, probably Tony and the rest of the team he’d left behind too.
It was too tight. This was wrong. This wasn’t what it was supposed to be. And Steve liked it. It was too good, too hot, too tight. The intensity crashed over him and he was going to drown, and Tony was watching him. Judging him.
Tony made a sound as if he had swallowed his tongue and then started coughing. Steve sprinted to his side and carefully rapped on his back until he could breathe freely again.
Steve managed to morph the gloating into a, hopefully, excited-looking smile. “I will not disappoint, sir.”
“Breakfast?" Anthony brightened. He strode past Steve without a glance, and grabbed the bag out of Lowell's hands. "Nice!”
“Ah, yes. Stevens, of course.” Stane put one of his unsettlingly big palms on Steve’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze. “So, how is our boy doing tonight?”
“Hey, you sure can take stuff from the fridge but cooking yourself breakfast is a bit bold, don’t you think?”
“Tony, Tony, Tony.” Deliberately, Obie walked over the living room floor and sat down on the armchair in Tony’s direct line of sight. Obadiah Stane had never liked to be ignored. “You going to tell me what happened, son?”
“But you aren’t Tony Stark, are you? Not here, not now. You’re my doll. And that means I can do what I want to you.” Steve tightened his hold until he could feel the plastic give a little and instantly let it go again. “And I can take care of you as I want.” He lifted his fingers to rub around the chop of dark hair but the feel was all wrong. Instead, he trailed his finger over the pleats of the dress again. “Because that whole ‘Playboy, Genius, Billionaire’ bit? It’s not good for you either.”
Why did Steve feel so empty then? He was a fool, wasn’t he? He was supposed to become Agent Stevens. Being his undercover identity all the time, or at least, as much as possible, was what made it easy to maintain. Natasha had drilled that into his head over and over again. And Agent Stevens didn’t have any relation to Anthony, but however strongly he denied it to himself, Steve Rogers had one to Tony Stark, so he either needed to stop thinking like Steve Rogers or… become friends with Anthony. As Andrew Stevens. That couldn’t be that hard. Steve and Tony had been friend...ly.
Steve heard Tony’s satisfaction but couldn’t see him, belatedly realizing that he had closed his eyes, unable to open them again. Tony was stroking him through his orgasm and this time there was no admonishment for not looking at him. Steve felt like he had jumped out of a plane without a chute and plunged into the ocean unharmed.
“All clear, sir. You can go up now,” he said, calm as you please as if he fully expected Tony to be there.
Steve sprang into motion as if on auto-pilot. He reached the two before he had any time to consider what he was doing and removed the man’s hand unceremoniously. The man sputtered angry bits of what might have been insults if they had been at all coherent. Steve should say something, explain that the man’s behavior was unacceptable. Instead he was holding on to the man’s arm. He realized he was waiting. Every muscle in his back was already going taut, preparing for a fight, but the man’s swearing was just growing louder, and not making sense. Steve’s other side got repeatedly hit as he was belatedly noticing. It hadn’t registered as anything but slight pressure before. He turned his head to see the lady whom he’d tried to help swinging her handbag at him. “Release my Harold, you brutish lug. This is an outrage! I will make sure you’ll get fired for this.”
Thank fuck that by now, Lowell knew better than to disturb him while he was working, but despite this, some things he needed to do behind closed doors. He waited until she was out of the bathroom and off to the living room before he retrieved his briefcase. He frowned at the data disc he took out. His security measures sucked. Right now, it was just keeping the encrypted discs in his locked briefcase that he kept near his own person at all times. The only saving grace was that no one knew that there was anything actually valuable in there.
While they have sex, Tony decides to start using Stevens's first name, but only manages to do so in his head. Tony dominates
“Hey, no.” Tony’s brow quirked in amused consternation. “You stay level-headed for this discussion. I’m done with flying this thing blind. You’ll tell me what you want out of this and what you definitely don’t want. I probably can mark humiliation down and underline it twice, but apart from that. What are your hard limits?”
Tony looked down at the readings on the detector. They were getting somewhere. That other Stark who had an annoying amount of hair left hummed pensively from his section of the analytic machinery they had assembled. “It follows the predictions from Banner’s model to a T, but we haven’t tried the more extreme ends of the spectrum yet.”
No. That wouldn’t change anything either. He needed to concentrate on his mission. Charm the crowd, tell them about the new satellite and the better coverage, the phones one could carry in their pockets… Get the people’s imagination going… Then invite a smaller group back to his place; party in the lounge…
He didn’t have time for it, damn it. He didn’t have the time nor energy to pretend to be… whatever he needed Obie to think he was. He needed to finish his arc reactor and the second gauntlet. He needed to charm all the board members and then he needed to figure out what his next step was going to be. Oh god, he needed to make sure Stevens’s custom care and cooking was not all a front for some sort of twisted form of revenge. But whether it was or wasn’t, he needed to keep himself from making another pass at Stevens.
Andrew whined, cut the noise off and squirmed. In satisfaction, Tony grunted in response and picked up the tube from the duvet near his knee.
“Are you really that naive?” he asked. “Of course, she was ‘sent.’ Just as that chiselled jaw beefcake Rumlow was. He’s a honeypot too.” Tony straddled Steve’s thighs and leaned in. “Just as you are,” he whispered and smashed their lips together.
Maybe, just maybe the man wasn't yet so rotten as he would grow to be over the next fifteen years. Maybe.
The ride wasn’t particularly long, but wanting to stare at someone’s back of the head the whole time could make every damn minute unbearable. Stevens’s shoulders were wide, his hands big, and his fingers looked —
Nobody answered him, but on the bright side, there was no shooting either, and after a tense couple of minutes of driving and listening to his heart almost beat out of his chest, the car slowed.
“About those weapons though — what about the missiles you promised to have finished in a few months? You’re still finishing those, aren’t you?”
“With you goons in tow?” he said, raising his eyebrow. “Obie will hopefully forget about these stupid threats soon enough, and then I'll 'party.’ Don’t you worry your pretty head about it.”
Andrew’s grunt-huff was not really an answer, but Tony set a punishing rhythm that was almost on the side of too painful even for him. He must’ve been also hitting the man’s prostate at least half the time though, because he held himself still, with his back arched in pleasure; just taking it.
He got on the bed, dropped the tube and the foil packets, got behind the perfect, smooth globes of a butt he was planning to plunder in the very near future. Savouring the sight, he stilled and, for a second, just looked his fill.
Tony had grown up surrounded by people just waiting for an opportunity to use him for their own gain. And Stevens was SHIELD, and therefore had clandestine motives for sure. If anything, Anthony’s reaction was healthy. Even the intensity of his reactions was absolutely warranted with everything going on in his life. He would grow up to be always in control of himself, having to be. Now, after his parents had just died and he was suddenly responsible for the whole Stark Industries empire, he should absolutely get to be emotional. Steve could take it.
After that, they went to a diner and ate in silence between Rumlow’s sniping over being treated so unprofessionally.
When, an hour later, Steve was sitting in the car with Anthony and Rumlow, he wouldn’t have been able to tell that the boy was anything other than well-rested. Steve was not stupid enough to actually ask him about it in front of Rumlow, though.
Trying to even out his breathing, Tony turned back to his work, but his heart was still racing and the urge to follow Andrew into the kitchen was nearly unstoppable. But no. He’d told Andrew to get him a coffee and that was what was going to happen. He would drink coffee and work and Andrew was going to kneel at his feet, perhaps with his head on Tony’s thigh even…
Steve splays a hand over his ass, touching all that belongs to him, finally trailing a finger over the point where they are connected. “How does it feel?”
And here Steve was — ready to kiss Rumlow’s ass, sleeping with young Anthony and no closer to the solution than he was five years ago. The only ‘accomplishments’ Steve had to show for his years undercover were punching people he wasn’t supposed to punch, going running for hours on end, and now he was apparently patrolling seedy parts of town hoping to find trouble, all without achieving even a shred of what he’d set out to do. Tony would’ve—
When they returned to the apartment building, the super was waiting with the keys to the second smaller apartment that Stane had rented for them to stay at while on security detail. It was one floor down from Tony.
He tugged at his jumper. Checked again that the tasers weren’t visible. Good enough. He opened the door, nodded at Rumlow and stood aside to allow them in. He didn’t look at… the impostor.
“Rumlow will tell you everything you need to know. You’ll find yourself with more time on your hands than you know what to do with. Be ready at seven a.m. tomorrow. The assignment is indefinite, so pack accordingly.”
Instead, he worked at making himself useful as a CEO (without openly stepping on Stane’s toes), developing computers so that they were a little better but not outrageously so, building defence equipment for the troops, and additionally, working on the tools he’d need to build nanotech gauntlets. Everything was going according to plan.
This was Peggy getting down to business, and Steve did miss that part of her in his everyday life as much as her lighter tones. Flirting was out of the question these days, of course, no matter what the situation was.
As far as building that particular satellite, Tony had worked the public and the investors really well. It was too late for SI to turn back now without losing face and Obie knew that, so he had to tolerate Tony tinkering with the fine tuning of the amplitude modulation for the new additional forward error correction signal and wait until Tony declared it finished. It wasn’t the error correction that Tony was tinkering with, of course, he just needed the new unit to control the other satellites as part of the pulse emitting satellite constellation.
He ignored any patronizing, made nice with the genuine well-wishers, cracked an appropriate joke here and there, and proceeded to listen to the reports avidly, read through all the documents that others only glanced at (had probably skimmed earlier), and cleared his throat when the chairman started to close.
So not only had he been supplying terrorists, but he’d also been supplying Hydra and the Chitauri all this time. He’d known that. Of course, he’d known that from the moment the Chitauri had come out into the open, but he’d never let himself think of it in any detail. There simply hadn’t been any time for falling apart. They'd had to mobilize and do it fast. There had been a war that needed to be fought; the next battle needed winning. And then the next. But the next win had been something they always struggled to achieve and soon winning had meant getting as much of the civilian population to safety as they could, and then just getting away to fight another day, only to hear that the other settlement had been wiped off the face of the Earth while they had been elsewhere.
When enough anticipation had built up, he put his hand back at those legs and determinedly caressed them, slowly making his way upwards. The feeling and tension made him want to rut into the mattress. He wondered what it would be doing to Tony. This time he didn’t stop when he reached the skirt. He made sure his fingers were following the outer side of Doll-Tony’s thighs so there was no chance of touching his cock yet. He could swear there was an almost tremble of excitement.
“Well, let’s get it over with.” He stepped into the foyer, followed by Steve and Rumlow, where a butler asked for his umbrella.
Tony’s frustration breaks through in a loud sobbing noise that he hardly can believe is coming from him.
Swallowing, he averted his eyes from the easy jog Stevens was taking on a treadmill and went on pounding the bag.
"It’s for your own good. I need to check if your apartment is clear,” Stevens said, stopped the car two blocks further and got out.
“You hung around every morning this week and disappeared as soon as the mail was delivered,” Stark said it with an air of knowing that it was Steve’s private matter and blithely ignoring that fact at the same time.
“Uncle Obie,” Tony raised his voice to be heard in the cavernous space and walked jauntily to greet him. “What a surprise!”
His fingers stopping, Tony's heart rate picked up and unable to deny himself, he listened to whether he could hear Andrew's voice.
Still lying on the weirdly comfortable bed, Tony drew in a slow breath and let it out. Steve was gone but the fight was still ongoing...
“I would ask you to beg, but I know you won’t.” Steve pulled his hand away and rolled onto his front and forbade his own moan at his semi pressing into the mattress. He put his head down on his pillow and turned Tony’s tiny head to look at him. The smile was still there.
“Hands behind your back.” Leaning up, he maneuvered the doll’s arms back, arranging them in the least awkward manner possible, which still looked somewhat unnatural. Or just uncomfortable. He licked at his lips. “Spread your legs.” The joints allowed for a surprisingly wide split.
Even back then, Tony put the world first, and Steve had respect for that. Tony had always commanded Steve’s respect in everything that happened after, but not his trust. When Ross had been at their doors, Steve took off because he didn’t trust Tony with Wanda’s safety. When Ultron had happened, Steve hadn’t trusted him either. He simply hadn’t believed that Tony could learn from what had happened. And when the Chitauri went public, he hadn’t trusted him to find a solution in time.
“Don’t think I will be fooled by you staying still for five minutes because I told you so. If I would roll you over, I know that stupid smile would be still on your face.” He gave the head the smallest shove.
Raising his head and squaring his shoulders was instinctual, and feeling Andrew’s body stiffening up next to him felt like closing ranks. His hindbrain had apparently decided that Andrew Stevens was on Tony’s side as if him being a potential Hydra agent was an impossibility. He shut it down and, throwing a quick glance at the man, stepped away. For all he knew the man was there to subdue him.
and 'Andrew' very obviously enjoys it. Tony imagines doing stuff to him but gets angry that he keeps imagining Steve.
He would definitely need to build Iron Man. Especially if he kept Rumlow. Besides, he would need it to survive the Chitauri.
Tony did see. He also wondered how in his youth, he'd never noticed this terribly patronizing behavior. Tony had been such an idiot; right up until his mid-thirties he'd been grateful to Obie for even putting up with him. He’d never realized that everything he did was a deliberate manipulation and gaslighting with the sole purpose of undermining Tony's self-confidence and influence.
What happened then was a regular night at the apartment, only with Agent Doe Eyes looking over his shoulder, expressing her amazement at everything that she thought he could find flattering. Frankly, Tony felt insulted. The woman wasn't subtle, not at all. It was as if she expected him to be an emotionally inexperienced horny teen. Had he really been this easy at twenty-one?
It started slow as it always did, he made the rounds, was courteous, made bucketsful of compliments and made people laugh, and as the evening slowly turned into a livelier event than it started out, Tony realized that he was enjoying himself.
Anthony was working on one of the benches, soldering something. When he noticed Steve, he jumped as if trying to hide the part he’d been soldering. His expression wasn’t even his trademark scowl that should have been adorable but made Steve's gut tighten in a weird way he couldn't place. Instead, Anthony seemed confused and weary.
He tells himself that he's imagining the likeness, and he wouldn't like there to be any likeness anyway. He manages to have sex so that he wouldn't see 'Andrew's' face.
As there was nothing else to do, Steve lay down on the bed and tried to at least take a nap because the other option would’ve been climbing up the walls.
Tony nodded against the man’s large chest, but unable to hug him back, he just stood there, his back ramrod straight and cold sweat on his skin.
Stane didn’t actually have any trouble keeping up with Anthony, but he also couldn’t pretend that it was anything other than a chase at Anthony’s whim. Especially when they reached the elevator, and Tony walked right past it towards the stairs.
The next days were mostly eventless with Steve now able to sleep through Lowell’s shift, and Anthony still ignoring him as best he could during Rumlow’s. They also built up a surprisingly solid routine with Tony working at home during Lowell’s shift, going to SI during Rumlow’s. During the fourth shift Steve had to spend in the security room, Rumlow stopped pretending that he was at all interested in taking this assignment seriously.
A gulp of air filled Steve’s lungs without his permission. This was all Tony. He was moving his ass in small circles, leaning all of his weight on Steve’s chest. It was almost nothing.
What was that? Lowell was going to stay alone with him all night? For some reason, the idea didn't sit well with him. It wasn't jealousy, Steve told himself. At least not only that.
“Good boy." Tony nodded, and resumed undressing. "You are going to do as I say, yeah?” He stepped out of the jeans and put his hands on his hips, his thumbs pointing out the outline of his cock. It was clear even through the boxers how hard he was. “
Andrew’s breath kept hitching, and very soon, he started moving in tandem with Tony's prodding. Grinning triumphantly to himself, Tony pulled out.
Also, Lowell had initially tried to see his schematics and documents that Obie didn’t have access to; in a different way, Stevens had also shown an interest. Was that why he kept bringing the food when Tony had lost himself in his work and refused to leave him alone at the data room at the library? Well. Tony was very careful with what he left lying around and no pair of blue eyes—
Lowell, fine. She was clearly experienced and beautiful and coming onto him rather hard. So Tony hadn’t been very nice to her, but she had known what she was getting into; definitely not her first time working a honeypot scheme. Lowell wanted information and was willing to pay for it with her body, despite the risk of not getting anything in return. So Tony had thought it only fair to also hope that she’d let something slip herself.
me) and then disappointment, as he realized that it had never been something Tony had especially called Steve; it was probably a reference to something that he used to refer to people he perceived as objectively attractive. He wasn’t Captain Handsome
Belatedly, Tony realized that ‘soldier’ wasn’t the word to use here, but Stevens was an ex-military too, wasn’t he? Also, something about the man had relaxed at hearing the word too. His mouth looked softer, maybe it was even a flicker of a smile that Tony saw? He wasn’t sure, but it made his insides quiver and he didn't like it. He didn't like it at all.
So here Tony was, pounding at the punching bag with zero focus on his technique. He was sure that anyone knowing anything about the sport saw that emotions were driving him, but he didn’t care what anyone might think.
With the condom gone and his clothes straightened, Tony handed him his jacket. “This time we’ll talk.” Steve answered with a nod. They absolutely needed to. “But first, we need to get this evening over with.”
that he was now trying to get from Anthony what he had never managed to have with Tony, because Steve always had been too angry, too short-sighted, too much of a coward? And now, for a brief time, he got the lifeless copy of what could have been, whereas Anthony was only a party to it because he didn’t hate him yet.
Steve breathed in through his nose. The word burned in his bones but it was the best he had felt since the last time Tony’d fucked him. The hand reached for Steve’s shirt collar and roughly pulled apart his bow tie, along with the top three buttons.
He turned away from the other two agents and pointed his thumb behind his back, moving away as if dismissing them.
His footwork had never been stellar while boxing, but his left hook was starting to become something that might even be helpful in a real altercation. He straightened himself and, frustration bubbling just under the surface of his (hopefully) calm demeanor, sternly told himself to not dip into the cookie jar; Stevens was off limits.
Steve didn’t point out that Rumlow wasn’t sleeping either and walked into the kitchen, to ostensibly look into the fridge. After pouring himself some juice, he started putting himself a sandwich together.
But the fourth time it happened, Stevens brought him a deep-dish pizza. Tony wrinkled his nose. Well, he supposed that after he had commended the man for having an excellent taste, it was bound to happen that he stumbled over something Tony disliked.
As he swept his eyes back to the traffic light, he noticed that Rumlow’s head was turned to him. “Everything alright, Agent Stevens?”
Anthony needed protein. He was training two to three times a week, a set time with a… basically an MMA trainer (just that they weren’t called that yet) and the other times he was working out at a high end gym three blocks away. He insisted on running there too.
Jerking back in surprise, Tony kept staring at him for a long moment before he finally nodded. He turned back to the counter and took two mugs out of the cupboard.
They were in Stane’s large office; the door was closed, and even though there were several meters between them, the ghost sensation of his lungs being constricted and the memory of his muscles turning numb and unresponsive were making his heart rate pick up.
A fond smile wanted to break out on Steve’s face, but just like always during the past several years, he didn’t let it.
“Wherever your thoughts are, they are not here. Stop it.” One of Tony’s hands was wrapping around Steve’s chin. Steve’s whole body felt like it was on fire but Tony’s touches were like a balm. “Just like so. Open up.”
The clock on the wall indicated it was twenty-three eighteen when Steve pushed into the locker room, and without any decorum, got naked and headed to the showers. He started the water and went through the motions of getting clean. When, not even thirty seconds later, he heard the door open, he didn’t turn around.
Tony removed himself from Steve’s mouth and his hands from his hair. Steve hadn’t realized how much of his weight had rested on Tony and he fell to his hands with a grunt. From the corner of his eye he could see Tony make an aborted motion, and before it turned even more awkward, he gathered himself to stand up.
They’d had this discussion often enough, and Steve had told Tony time and time again in no unclear terms that there was no alternative to doing the right thing. Now Steve was a hypocrite a thousand times over, but he would do right by Tony.
Obie sighed. "I can understand that, I can. But it's not really about not coming to the office, Tony. Surely you can see that, right?"
“No need to hurry, Stevens. I won’t reconsider,” Tony said, still undoing the button on his jeans, as Stevens — Andrew (Tony figured he should start using the man’s first name at some point) was already naked.
Steve didn’t want to believe that it meant Anthony now relaxed in his presence more than with others, but there was some progress: before, he’d locked himself in his bedroom whenever it was Stevens’s shift, and now he just kept on working.
Any hint of a smile had vanished from the man's face and the vise that had started to coil around Tony's temples disappeared. Instead, the apparent excited obedience that Andrew's entire form encapsulated sent a frisson of pleasure up Tony’s spine.
With no hesitation, Andrew pulled the tube out of the drawer and squirted some on his fingers. Blushing, he widened his stance and moved his hand behind himself—
Steve put the chair in a corner where he would be unable to look over Anthony’s shoulder. It was very obvious that he was trying to keep them from seeing any of his developments. He tended to forget when immersed into work, but Steve didn’t get a glimpse at his screens that often. Not surprising, as the military or SHIELD could use any snippet of information on what Anthony was developing, but Steve was astounded at how keenly aware of it Anthony already was at such a young age.
“You are not going to move. Keep still for me and I might just let you come.” There was no movement, and Steve bit his lip to not moan out loud. Tony had still a little way to go before Steve would allow him to see how much he managed to arouse Steve. He pressed his finger down and rubbed over the raised plastic. The feel wasn’t the same, of course, but it was hard which was enough right now.
AN: I’m sorry if anyone needed the sex scene summary in the end-notes of the previous chapter and it wasn’t there! I swear it was added, but for some reason, it wasn’t showing up? I just saw it now (4th of July), removed the end notes and added them again and now they are visible. I hope no one stopped reading because of it. :(
He set the correct weight level for the chest press machine and sat down. Working out gave Tony something to do at least. Rumlow was sitting in the corner, working lazily with dumbbells while keeping an eye on the whole room, and Tony was pretending that the man wasn’t there.
“Then let us discuss it, but it’s still a good idea to talk to the Kramer Group Ltd too. They’re willing to invest large sums—”
“And you like it too,” Tony continued in a tone that was a mix of mockery and admiration. “You were hard as nails before I even got my dick into you. After you had opened that stupid mouth of yours twice on the slightest implication that I might want to use it. I’m not even sure it would be fun to make you beg for it. You’re just too goddamn easy.”
“Why can’t you just shut up for once?” It sounded less angry than Steve had expected. “Why do you always need to drive me up the wall? Is that stupid giant genius brain of yours not satisfied if it doesn’t know? Doesn’t know how far you can go?”
Purposefully, Tony relaxed his jaw and, trying to appear contrite, straightened to look the other man in the eye. “I’m sorry, Uncle Obie. I just…” He looked for a flimsy enough excuse, but in the end, the best lie always had a kernel of truth in it. “I just suddenly felt so fed-up with it all.” He shrugged and sat down behind his desk, trying to look foolishly cocky. “And what’s the harm anyway? So I skipped one day at the office, so what? I’m sure they managed quite fine without me.” He smiled disarmingly. “Besides, I knew you were there, Uncle Obie.”
Guessing why Rumlow was commended for a job well done made Steve’s blood boil. Their security measures were mostly laughable. Getting past Lowell or Madden would not be a problem to anyone who knew what they were doing. It hit him like a brick between the eyes right then: they weren’t there to protect Tony at all. They were there to invade his life as intimately as possible. At Pierce’s request. Which meant at Hydra’s request. And Steve was standing by, letting it happen.
They got out of the alley without incident. Tony sat up and wondered if Rumlow being behind the wheel meant it was actually some kind of a trap, but then remembered that if anything he’d been giving an air of deep disinterest to his assignment. He kept pushing off his responsibilities on Stevens or Madden whenever he wanted. And for a bodyguard to actually leave his client in a potentially dangerous situation? If it had been a trap, something would’ve definitely happened in that alley. Despite this, Stevens, like a paranoid nutcase, was driving around changing lanes and taking sharp turns without signalling. Other drivers honked at them, but so far, no attacks nor, as far as Tony could see, any pursuers.
To himself, Tony didn’t even pretend not to know why he did that. Although the expressions on the face were different — one might say, indifferent even — and Tony knew intellectually that the shade of the blue in his eyes had to be different, or the shape of the eyes or the nose... Because even if he was Cap’s thrice removed grandson or something, there had to be at least some differences. Despite this, a part of Tony’s brain still kept insisting that it was the same man. It couldn’t be and it wasn’t, and every time Tony had to look at him it hurt. So, in the end, he just said thank you and ate his veggies like a good boy.
“Mr. Stark,” Pierce held his hand out, smiling in the way politicians did during elections: friendly and on the intimate side of polite, as if they were sharing a secret.
This time Steve looked his fill of the white stripes bordering painted-on curly black hair and the tiny plastic penis.
Tony got the feeling it wouldn’t be the first time he was on the other end of a manhunt. He knew too what it was like to be in the crosshairs, but that wasn’t the issue. “He won’t come. He will send a team.”
Yes. Probably half a year altogether. Up to a year. Hydra couldn’t accomplish anything spectacular during a year, could they?
Tony rubbed Andrew's chest, went over his nipples several times, sucked the skin under his ear into his mouth. Andrew's breath hitched; his body went taut as if he was holding himself back and when Tony stepped away, he stayed as if Tony's voice was the only thing that could propel him into moving.
Not fazed by the unusual request at all, Stevens glanced at the empty ring, then passingly at Tony as if he weren’t even an important variable in this equation. Did it really happen so often for him to be challenged to a fight by young twinks for no good reason? Tony was just about to say something nasty when Stevens nodded.
Steve frowned. Anthony looked a little bit more rumpled and had a manic glint in his eyes. Steve was just about to ask why he hadn't slept, but at that moment the door opened, and, of course, there Lowell was, with a paper bag from a cafeteria nearby.
Most probably, Stevens was going to get himself reassigned. Or file a harassment suit. One of the two. In any case, there would be no more concerned blue gaze watching him as he ate, that was for sure. Tony closed his eyes and started counting his reps in primes.
Tony wasn’t actually staring at him now, but he remembered and the need to check if he... The need to find old footage to check if he remembered Steve correctly was overwhelming. It was an obsession; that’s what it was. No use in thinking about it.
Andrew’s breath visibly caught; he shivered and in a controlled movement folded down onto his knees without taking his hands out from behind his back.
This was getting out of control. Imagining other people during sex was nothing new nor did Tony feel especially guilty for it — it didn’t hurt anyone if there was no emotional intimacy and he managed to still provide pleasure. Even imagining some young buffoon in the heat of the moment was nothing that hadn’t happened before, but that his brain confused him with Steve…
Unable to move, Steve looked down at him. The picture of a deer in a truck’s headlights came to mind but his brain didn’t impart him with the knowledge of how he was supposed to align that metaphor with Anthony and himself.
He locked his case again and took it with him into the living room. “I’m going to SI,” Tony threw at Lowell in passing and went to his dressing room. “Get the driver.”
By the time the bodyguards arrived that morning, Tony had first sculpted and then shaved off the beginnings of his goatee. He did it with regret, but it just looked as if he was trying too hard; he didn’t need people at SI snickering behind his back. He was what he was: an old man in a twenty-one-year-old body that looked barely eighteen, so he'd have to work with what he had.
A hand rested on Tony's shoulder just for a moment, and Tony’s heart constricted. He took a deep breath, sat up straight, took the glass, and drank.
Where there was supposed to be underwear, the doll instead had a replica of what according to Stark was as close as one could get to ‘the real thing’. Some toy company had decided that making money off children wasn’t enough, and instead, they would produce what they called ‘collectibles’: Doll likelinesses of celebrities and the big draw was that instead of the typical, smooth groin usual toys had, these ones would also replicate their model’s genitalia. It was abominable.
The computer on the desk made him want to weep, but then he imagined that it was some other poor sap’s device and stocked up on patience. Thank god Obie had made sure he had a daily planner with all the relevant phone numbers in his briefcase. A paper calendar that was more efficient than whatever was currently the most modern calendar application.
ironmongers, Tony. Your father was one and that is still what we do best! This is what we’re known for: we build weapons and we sell them. Communications are well and good, but you don’t win a war with a walkie-talkie, do you?”
Their shift changes were getting more and more sloppy. No one seemed to actually expect any attacks but Steve had a hard time getting rid of the feeling that Tony would get hurt as soon as he turned his back.
There was a polite laugh, and Tony said some closing words. One director wanted to know what he’d meant by changes, and Tony shared his aspirations in communications and the computer industry. Then the chairman closed the meeting.
The expression was all wrong. A lot less strung out, more lax. It lacked the sharp edge of determination, the softness of compassion, and the grimness of the later years. It just looked...  more blank. The brow seemed lower, the line at the mouth… defeated. His eyes? Somehow lighter than Tony remembered. Emptier.
Tony laughed cruelly. “Of course, SHIELD — or Obie, whatever — told her to seduce me! It’s called a honeypot, sweetcheeks.”
“We’ve always had other business partners besides the military and you know that. Anything else would be too high a risk.”
Initially (in another lifetime), he’d been very supportive, because the only outcome of such musings had been talk and more talk, but this time, Tony was refusing to spend any time inventing what Obie needed, so it was becoming a problem. By now, his…
Tony struggled to stay up and look over the shoulder even as the car was drifting to the right. He thought he saw a large garbage truck standing in the middle of the crossing just where they were supposed to have driven through.
“You can beg me to let you orgasm any time you want.” Steve’s erection was by now hurting from being confined between his body and the bed. He wondered if it had been long enough, but if Tony needed a reminder they could always do this again. He let go of Tony’s cock. “Whining won’t bring it back faster.” Although it might make Steve even harder.
He had started with the blow jobs. Maybe that had been his tactical error. After two, Steve said that he was done with oral for the day. It hadn’t demotivated Tony then, but right now, he was questioning his decisions.
Tony was about to make eye contact with Steve. The rushing stopped and all of Steve’s senses switched back online with an intensity that was barely tolerable.
“Good boy,” Tony praised him very quietly. It was more a breath than a sound, an intimate uttering that made something uncomfortably icy start forming under his sternum. “Go, get on the bed,” he added a little louder to purposefully shatter the moment.
He still sounded soft, but Andrew shivered, so Tony hadn't fucked it up. Andrew only stayed a moment more and without saying a word, complied. Mouth dry, hands still on his hips, Tony watched him go. Then sauntering as if he had all the time in the world, Tony followed.
There was a distinct lack of an honorific now and for some inexplicable reason, for a second, it made Tony feel better until he saw Stevens’s almost mulish expression. That was… too close to what he wanted to see, so he dropped his gaze, pulled the plate closer to himself and said, “Thank you.”
The car kept going and Tony tried to raise his head to see what was happening, but Stevens’s large body was practically on top of him now.
Was he really waiting for some miserable bastard to attack him? Some kid that had no idea what he was getting into, probably? And then what? One hit, one grab or hold, all carefully, carefully executed. That was all that Steve could do without drawing attention that he really couldn’t afford.
When Andrew finally drove him home, Tony felt wiped out. His feet dragged him over the threshold and straight over to the liquor cabinet in the living room. Automatically, Tony opened the door and froze. The cabinet was empty, of course, but the fact that he was even standing here like this, was alarming. His fingers gripping the door; Tony stared into the cabinet and breathed.
“Move it in and out,” he instructed intently, unable to think of anything but what he was seeing for once. “Again. Yes. Stop.” He took a deep breath, circled his shaft with his fingers and tugged in rhythm of Andrew’s movements. “Now tug it out almost all the way, yes, stop. Insert a second finger. Slowly. Yes.” He suppressed a groan at seeing Andrew’s shiver. “Good. Fuck, yeah. Can you do a third— No, don’t. Pull them out.”
Watching how the considerably larger man was wrapping his hands, made Tony feel ridiculous and ridiculously thrilled: he was so clearly outmatched not only by size but probably also by ability and skill. Would that finally kill Tony's libido?
“Anywhere you need to be today apart from SI, Mr. Stark?” Rumlow asked at the beginning of their day shift.
For a little while, time almost lost its meaning, but since he failed to set his rhythm, he tired of kicking sooner than he would have hoped. Back to regular punches it was. When he looked back towards the treadmill, Stevens was gone, and instead, there was a random guy in a terrible neon yellow singlet on it.
He had done his morning run, or rather post-sleep run. It was something that had seemed to fit nowhere when they started the security detail, but by now he had got a sort of routine where he managed to sleep, run, and be around often enough to know what was going on upstairs.
“It’s probably not a thing the talking heads look for but definitely something that is very much needed. If someone can do it, it’s probably you.”
“What are you researching?” Steve asked into space that was only filled with the occasional clicking of the machine.
Steve opened the door to the meeting room. Two heads swayed in his direction, the silence deafening in a way that said there had been a heated discussion just seconds ago.
"I'm sorry, Director." Tony put on his miserable 'I want to be persuaded but I'm afraid' mask. "I understand your position, but ever since my parents…” He couldn’t make his facial muscles cooperate, so he just looked away and paused for a moment. “It’s just not been the same.” He halted and then, internally cringing, continued more quietly. “I don’t think I’m made of the same stuff as my father.”
“I can do it,” Steve said bullheadedly despite already having fucked up in the past. “No one knows that I know, and I will keep it that way.” He was determined to succeed. He mostly played dumb these days. He couldn't hide his physical abilities entirely, but he could try to seem like a regular capable agent that was only slightly stronger and faster than average. He could be all brawn and no brains for everyone who cared to look.
Suddenly the shoe on his dick and the hand on his throat were gone. Both of Tony’s hands were around his head now, moving him in the same rhythm as Tony’s thrusts, picking up the punishing speed from before. His nose was pressed into Tony’s pubes at the end of each thrust, and Steve struggled to develop a breathing rhythm to get air into his lungs in between.
“What? In your world, everything is always sunshine and rainbows, and you always are on the same side?”
— to five and breathe again and calm down, because it’s not real, Steve never hit him, he was Tony’s friend, and Steve… This man is
“What are you doing?” Stevens hissed, back to alert mode in a nanosecond; knuckles white around the gun and looking around frantically.
“I hear there’s been some progress on your current mission, Agent Rumlow," Steve heard Pierce saying. "Agent Garett has been singing your praises.”
“Oh, Tony!” Stane exhaled loudly, as if in sympathy. “I’m so sorry you feel this way! You are hurting, it’s understandable. You’re young, freshly orphaned, lost your mother. Of course, that’s got to be playing on your mind, but may I make a suggestion?” He paused just enough to pretend that he needed Tony’s input and went on without actually giving him an opportunity to answer. “Finish the missiles and see how you feel then. Alright? Because you know what, Tony? In the end, having the bigger stick is what saves the lives of our boys overseas, doesn’t it? Your weapons are saving lives, Tony! Not taking them! Just think about that and no rash decisions, alright?”
His fingers felt their way along the straps to the garter belt. As broad as his fingertip was, it inevitably touched the doll’s cock. “And if you’re a good boy…”
Steve tried, but couldn’t keep his eyes from the mirror this time. His eyes met with Tony’s and for a split second, it looked like a shadow was distorting his features from his usual cultivated haughty and otherwise disinterested demeanor, to something painfully open and tired. Tony looked away almost instantly and the impression was gone.
Andrew stopped, swallowed and turned. Lowering his head as if in embarrassment, he put his fingers between his cheeks.
It hadn’t lined up with Steve’s shifts so far, or he would have offered to help Anthony with training, maybe even show him some jiu jitsu or judo. Well, the time would come as it was just a question of probability. He would also try to nudge Tony to go out on his next shift. It was good for him to get out of the house more.
“Mr. Stark...” he started, but everything else was lost to Steve as the rushing in his ears became overwhelming.
“That’s a part of her mission,” Rumlow went on matter-of-factly. “Just be glad it’s her and not you.” He smirked. “You jealous that he's getting some and you are stuck here? Eyes on the prize, sucker. Chase pussy on your off time.” Rumlow paused, then huffed, as if surprised. “This is the first time I actually think you’re acting like a normal dude.” He stroked his chin with his thumb a few times. “You know what? The Egg’s going to some fancy charity thing next week. I hear all the heiresses there are just ready to get dirty. If you manage to get under one of those skirts, I’m going to cover for you.”
He started to work Steve with a lot of pressure and no patience. Steve felt that he could come then and there, but, at the same time, the way that Tony was unabashedly staring made him squirm, making his physical urges a little less immediate than his muddled emotions. This was Tony. Young, shameless, and careless. Did he even care that he wasn’t Lowell?
Maybe he would say that Doll-Tony knew to do what one told him (her? No, him. Definitely him). That Stark should take an example in him. Steve moved the doll’s arms up.
It looked quite complete already. Steve didn’t need to add the garter belt and stockings and shoes. The effect was quite nice, and it got the message across.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said. “I just wanted to let you know about the shift change, and that I’m here if you need anything.” The scowl slowly crept back on Anthony’s face and Steve prepared for a strategic withdrawal. “I’ll leave you to your jet engine geometry then.”
“You’re a tool and you need to be used like one. On your own you just get yourself in trouble.” Tony stopped for a moment and his expression became thoughtful before it dissolved into a smirk. “I will need to get condoms from somewhere or everyone will know how you apologized for being an idiot out there. You stay here—”
“What is this?” Tony asked, trying not to react in any way before having thought it through. The mere presence of Obadiah Stane always put him on edge and now he was showing him these… “This is bullshit,” he blurted angrily.
Steve expected to be met by Stane again, but instead, a comparatively short brunet boy opened the door.
Tony let go of him and reached for Steve’s jacket as if his things were Tony’s, as if Steve had no right to privacy or possessions. Steve sank down onto his haunches, unable to keep himself up without Tony’s hand directing him, correcting him. His breathing was evening out as he watched how Tony found the condom strip and tore one off, dropping the other one on top of his jacket.
Before leaving, the delivery came for the kitchen, and Steve put all the food items away into their designated cupboards. Steve ordered steaks, because it was one of the few things he knew how not to ruin, and a ton of healthy snacks he could put around the apartment in an attempt to remind the kid that he needed food several times a day.
Tony looked at how the slight roundness tapered off into the strong muscles coiling at the flanks and on the planes of the back, divided into two perfect pointed triangles. How the muscles under his armpits made the flaring of his impossibly large waist to shoulder ratio even more obvious, and how the tension in Andrew’s still body was cranking up and up and Tony had to smile at the very obvious effort the man was making at keeping absolutely still. He was either getting anxious or excited, and perversely, Tony wasn’t sure which notion was making him more aroused. It was very satisfying to observe how Andrew was dealing with the zero feedback or instruction from his dominant sex partner.
'Well, can’t have that, can we?' Tony thought, and instead of raining more smacks on the man’s bottom, he caressed the reddened skin and pinched the other cheek, then soothed that one, too.
The second time it happened, Steve had definitely known what was coming, and he still hadn’t put a stop to it. He’d known... had hoped as soon as he saw the look in Tony’s eyes. Had known it was wrong and still let it happen.
There was no question of how much active participation was required of Steve here. Tony was taking what he wanted and Steve was there as an accessory to what he desired. At this angle, eye contact was impossible, and Steve wasn’t sure if it would’ve changed anything. The pace was brutal, there was no regard for Steve needing time to adjust or to breathe or the fact that he was drooling more than ever before. It was running down his chin, uncontrolled, as he had no time to close his mouth around Tony and no desire to. It was dripping down, probably leaving marks on his shirt and slacks. It would be obvious what Steve had been doing as soon as Tony was done with him.
It was driving him spare. He wanted to tell Obie to fire him, but then he’d get another wild card he knew nothing about and Stevens at least looked harmless for the most part. Still, during his shifts, Tony started locking himself into his bedrooms when he didn’t need a computer. Stevens started knocking and Tony learned to tune it out.
With observant eyes, Obie watched Tony stepping back in a seemingly uncoordinated manner and dropping an oily rag on the reactor on the floor. Stane’s cold gaze sharpened.
The animal in Tony was still struck mute. He should at least nod, he thought, but the urge to just grab the man standing next to him and back him to the couch and do
Yes. Yes, he had been. Damn it, the knowledge was humiliating. It was so humiliating that Tony decided to call her out.
Steve went to the bathroom to wash his face. He knew that he had only just showered, but it felt sticky and filthy, and he just wanted to leave all that behind. He tugged off his shirt, pants, and socks and threw them in the hamper. He scrubbed his teeth and used mouthwash as one is supposed to, and then there was nothing more he could peel back, and he went back out.
He sounded twice as old as the body it was coming from, and Steve’s heart constricted. Jarring as the idea was, it made sense. It sounded… reasonable? They shouldn’t keep sleeping together. It was what Steve had been thinking even if he hadn’t been able to follow through. So this… the fact that Tony agreed was good.
Whatever the reaction, this was what a relationships were for, not this, whatever they had between them.
“...can you stop for a minute, Tony? I know you love all those new ideas you have, but we also need to finance all these little hobbies somehow.”
With a start, Steve realized that yes, none of the spaces Tony regularly occupied had alcohol in them, but wasn’t young Tony supposed to be a heavy drinker already? Or would that come later? Steve hadn’t noticed because his frame of reference was the older Tony, but did it actually make sense for Anthony? Stane’s words were certainly implying that this was a new development.
Clint had stopped eating and was eyeing them both alternately. Tony was silent now but still looked at Steve as if waiting for something. A part of Steve felt seconds away from ripping. He shouldered his way through Stark, not looking back to see if he had done any damage, and was out of there.
Tony was not stopping. The high was turning into the unpleasant friction of too much sensation, and Steve’s eyes snapped back open.
Struggling to think of an excuse to drag Anthony away from Pierce, Steve missed the rest of the short conversation, but now Tony was slowly doing his rounds, and to Steve's absolute horror, Rumlow had left his post and was now conversing with Pierce. Openly.
“Oh,” he said stupidly. Then, still drunk on endorphins, he grinned. “You don’t mind waiting for the second go, boy, do you?” Phrasing it as a non-question, he held his breath as he waited for a reaction. For a beat, Andrew seemed to just shudder and fight himself, then—
The man’s eyes narrowed. “Whatever you are trying to hide from me, Tony, I’ll find out eventually, you do realize that, don’t you?”
Steve couldn’t care less if Anthony was ready to hear that or not. Even if he wasn’t, the words would still hopefully be there in his memory once he got there, when Steve would be long gone.
‘He’s going with a hug,’ Tony thought hysterically. ‘He wants to hug me.’ Numbly, standing to flee, Tony nodded. No, he thought as the large body of Obadiah Stane enveloped his rigid form in a bear hug.
As pleased as Tony was with it, Stevens dodged it easily, sidestepped him and retaliated. A part of Tony was surprised to find that he was disappointed at how simple it was to notice where the punch was planned to land and to easily execute a perfect dodge.
“Stark…” The low growl was calculated. Aggression was so far the only thing that had any chance of making the man back off. And heaven knew Steve had tried about every other trick in the book. It was obvious that Tony loved to wind Steve up and see how far he could go. Steve was honest enough with himself that he could admit that this would probably end badly in the near future.
For a second, Tony glanced at the man driving the car. Stevens. What even was his first name? Roger? Tony snorted.
Steve felt his face heating. He should have had an umbrella for Anthony. He had been so worried about not thinking about him that he had also forgotten to make sure that he was okay and not getting wet before facing possible investors. At least that was what all other functions had been about, according to the other agents.
In his twenty-one-year-old body, adrenaline kicked in, blood rushed to his face and his hands started sweating a lot more easily. On the other hand, his acting ability and the confidence in his bluffing had also improved over the years.
When Anthony reappeared a short while later, they didn’t talk. The drive was equally quiet and when Steve insisted on following him into the room with the reader, Anthony appeared rather irritated.
When Stane let him go, he took Tony by the shoulders and squeezed them. “It’s gonna be okay, son. It’s okay, you don’t have to change your life just because of the accident. I know it must have been a shock, but it was nobody’s fault and whatever you do now won’t change what happened, you do realize that, don’t you, Tony?”
Tony still had no idea. Maybe when the fight was over? He didn't have the time nor the resources right now anyway.
The memory of determination on Steve’s face as his features disintegrated like a pixelated image from a screen; the glint of that damn alien gun in the Chitauri’s hand just a moment before, and Steve’s eyes widening as he realized what was going to happen. The resolve to not defend himself so that the rest of the team would have time to evacuate as many people as possible before the bridge's collapse into the water; the knowledge and acceptance of a certain death in his gaze while his muscles were still straining under the weight of the crumbling structure.
He sat down with his secretary's folder of social invitations and carefully chose several events that would have his board members and potential investors for the new satellite present. He would need to make nice with them.
Tony shook his head to get his thoughts back on track, but something about the parade rest the blond had assumed was bothering him. When Obie said something, the blond man turned slightly and stepped fully into his sight.
He didn't wait for confirmation, just grabbed his jacket and was out of there. Steve was pretty sure that he wouldn't stay with building security for long.
Stilled. Then started moving in rhythm and now they were both moaning. Tony was going fairly slow at first, stroking Andrew’s hips, squeezing and pinching his skin, but the channel was hot and tight and then Andrew started moving with him and soon their moans ceased, replaced by heavy panting and the sound of skin slapping on skin. Wet, dry, quick.
It was better than whatever he had been thinking of before. Steve turned around, ignoring how his neck muscles tightened up on their own accord. There was no better result to expect from any conversation with Stark. It was just wasted energy, and he was smarter for letting him blab at the wall instead of Steve.
“Figured it out, huh?” Rumlow drawled as he turned back to his food. “Not that dumb, after all, Stevens?” He smirked. “She is doing a good job of keeping him easy to handle, isn’t she?”
Steve couldn’t keep Anthony from doing what he did, but he could try to at least make a difference. Getting Tony to eat breakfast worked the same way it always had. If it was ready and close enough to the coffee, there was a good chance he would pick it up.
Yes. This was the reason Tony hadn’t wanted to see the man’s face. He was nobody. Or rather — just a body.
Tony stepped up to the bedside table and fished the lube and a condom out. Hovering over the open drawer just for a moment longer, he noticed that Stevens was resolutely staring right ahead of himself even though he surely had noticed Tony appearing in his field of vision. A renewed pleasure started uncoiling itself in his gut.
“Don’t be like that, darling. Don’t tell me you had any doubts I would be back.” Tony grinned at him and he was damned if he didn’t see Steve’s eyes soften and his mouth twitch.
“Well, he does have other things to do during my shift,” Lowell gave back, and Steve carefully put down the towel, very aware of the danger of ripping it to shreds. He still wasn’t a fan of what Lowell did with Anthony, but he had no reason and no right to put a stop to it. He had made his peace with that as well as he was able to, but the way Lowell talked about it was designed to piss Steve off.
The weight of Tony was suddenly gone from Steve’s legs, and with a few seconds lag, he registered that he was opening a drawer and pulling out something. Steve stood up. He wasn’t exactly sure why. His pants were awkwardly tented and he had a vague idea that it was inappropriate and that he should be ashamed. This was Anthony. Tiny, young, freshly-orphaned Anthony. Steve was barely able to keep from slapping himself.
“Yeah, of course.” Maybe Steve was so good at playing the idiot because he secretly was one. “But you never use it.”
The way that Tony was closing in had nothing of the scared youth that Steve had tried to protect at the restaurant.
Tony had no idea how Steve’s body would have felt under his hands, how Steve’s skin smelled or how he would kiss. Tony would never know.
What had it even looked like to Anthony? That Stevens was fed up with him after he got all he wanted? That he had used him and let him drop like a hot potato? Steve was making everything worse and worse. If he wanted to be a better man, he'd better start now. He almost missed them moving on into a room where a number of guests were already gathered. Several servers were making the rounds with drinks and food.
It didn’t matter. Not right now, not yet. Nothing of what was happening now would ever matter to the present Steve in this new, changed timeline. Tony cut that train of thought off.
And there it was, a flat parcel as broad as Steve’s palm and around eight inches long. It was light, of course it was, which made Steve hold on to it that much tighter.
Tony cut him off before that became a problem. “Zip it! I don’t want to hear what the fuck you were thinking.” He moved closer, and Steve stepped back, swallowing. “Take off the jacket.” Tony sounded dangerously calm now. Steve knew that tone, he knew what was happening. This time, there would be no pleading temporary insanity or telling himself that he had no idea where it was going to lead.
“‘That so?” Stane stood up straight and took out a cigar case. “You could’ve said. Because I’ve already taken steps… Not sure if they can be retracted."
Steve nodded in answer as if it was normal that Madden was being forced on a double shift simply because Rumlow was a lazy ass.
Steve hums. He bites into the cord at the side of Tony’s neck and pushes at his rim hard at the same time. Tony yowls. For a moment he thinks, Steve’s about to finger him while his cock is still inside Tony. But then he lets up.
Nostrils flaring in rage, Tony tried again all the buttons, levers and handles, but nothing opened. They must have modified the car after he’d ditched it the last time. Why was he even surprised? It’s not as if anyone would care if he died of heat like a stupid puppy left in a car in the mall parking lot.
“Tony,” he said, his tone full of sadness-laced disappointment. “You know that your father would not see it this way, don’t you? You are not just disregarding his wishes and dishonouring his memory with your childishness, you are tearing down everything your father and I built. And what would your mother say to that, Tony? Have you thought about that?”
Steve managed to swallow his automatic snort. The idea of Tony Stark ever wanting to be protected was hilarious enough that he could easily ignore the rest of the tasteless comment. Neither of the other two agents reacted to the words either, apparently refusing to pander to Rumlow’s sensibilities, but Steve was quite sure that Lowell was secretly annoyed. The woman’s face was placid, but something in her unmovable demeanour was too still. Steve himself, however, was much more irritated by Rumlow than usual. He would have to watch that.
Pierce's eyes lit up at the answer. “Garett, why don’t you send Agent…” he left the blank for Steve to fill in.
“Okay, soldier, you’re up,” he said casually, almost sneering, and squirted lube directly onto the hole. He started circling it with his thumb, and he wasn't doing it gently either. But gentleness apparently wasn’t needed because the man was already panting and, it seemed, was barely keeping himself from thrusting back.
of trying to touch yourself, I will know, and I’ll tie you up, use you and leave you hanging, you got it?”
“Yeah, but I couldn’t stay away any longer. I promise I’ll make it up to you. But now we need to act fast.”
Swallowing heavily, Andrew was standing in front of him, muscles coiled as if wanting to move, but holding himself back. His cock was at full-mast and straining, ready to go. Tony hummed appreciatively and slowly, pulled down his own zipper. Andrew’s gaze was single-mindedly staring at his progress but that only made Tony move at an even more sedate pace. With deep satisfaction, he started lowering his jeans.
“Agent Lowell is one of our best assets, and she will be your protective detail from now until 7 a.m. today. Agent Madden is on back-up and Stevens and I will cover the day shift.”
His body was not yet addicted. Not really. He could… He could drink and he'd be able to stop. Just tonight. Or just only for this. This mission.
“The DOD might ask for a discount or even another contract in return,” Stan continued, “but I’m sure they’ll not be opposed. You do know that the Kramer Group is not the first overseas company we are selling to? Maybe they’ll even want some of that fancy communication equipment you have everyone up in arms about? That make you feel better?”
“We are glad to have you here,” Stane said with a sharp smile. “The loss of Howard and Maria was already more than any of us could take, but see, I’m also Tony’s godfather. I have made a promise to his parents to keep him safe.”
There is no Steve, there is no Steve, Tony tells himself. Steve is gone, and he knew that already, damnit, why would he —
Rumlow was in a tux as required. Good. At least Tony had managed to ditch Lowell for this event. Even if he had to put up with Stevens on top of Rumlow, at least neither would try to hang off of his arm and he could concentrate on doing what he’d set out to do. The thought of buttering up a bunch of rowdy party-goers while sober was unappealing, though.
“I’m going to lift your skirt up again now, and you will be pleasant and patient.” He did exactly that. Doll-Tony still smiled that enamored smile.
Not today. If he fell off the wagon, it was not going to be today. Tony nodded decisively, stood up and thought of all the stray bottles around the apartment. In the kitchen, his bedside table, and even the bathroom. He carried all the bottles to the sink and poured them out, one by one. There. That hadn’t been so bad, had it?
The decision was already made, but Steve still paused for a moment. There would be no stopping after this. It was the admission that they would be doing it over and over and over again. If Tony let him. Because there was no way of denying that Tony was holding the leash here. If Tony wanted him, he would be on his knees every time.
Steve’s head swam with the implications. Useful. Whatever would come after this, he didn’t want to be anywhere else.
There was a sound from his living room, and with a pang Tony remembered that he had a stranger in his apartment right at this moment. A stranger. An impostor.
“He sure is keeping busy,” Steve said, wrestled his face into a generic smile and reminded himself to keep breathing through his nose. “I guess you’re here to see him?” He didn’t wait for an answer, instead turning around to knock on the door. Stane had the habit of rushing into wherever Tony was without knocking, absolutely used to having complete access to him at any given time.
He shook his head, meaning ‘leave me alone’, but that didn’t translate well, so he nodded. Nausea rolled over him and he ran. In the bathroom, he threw up.
Tony was the one line Steve would not cross. What was saving the world worth if he let Tony be… used like that?
He can ignore his aching thighs and the burning in his ass. Steve Rogers might be stubborn, but Tony gets what he wants.
Tony stared at the man. Of course. Suddenly, it all became too clear. First, the letters were most definitely fake, the whole situation Obie orchestrated in order to get his men to watch Tony. But on the other hand, he didn't want a security detail handpicked by the man who was currently his most dangerous adversary.
There was a beat of silence during which Tony naively thought that he’d somehow got through to Obie, that maybe, miraculously, he’d managed to change the course of history, that painting dollar signs in front of the man’s eyes had helped. But then, Obie’s gaze hardened and he shook his head in parental-looking disapproval, which at this point looked simply patronising and manipulative to Tony.
“Keep it that way, Steve. I have grandkids, and a twenty-one-year-old godson in charge of a multimillion empire to worry about. I can’t have you blow your cover because the mere sight of a Hydra agent is too much of a temptation.”
“Not like this,” Tony barked again and relished seeing Andrew falter. “Get on your hands and knees. Yes, like this. Now push your ass out. Good.”
“Maybe Stevens wanted to show us his old stomping grounds. Although I had figured him to be more of a Brooklyn boy,” Tony huffed.
Besides Obie in the armchair, his living room was filled with four people. All of them in civvies, but their bearing was very obviously militaristic. A tall man, mid thirties maybe — dark hair, heavy-set build — was sitting in the other armchair. The woman on the sofa drew his gaze — was she a lawyer or something? But no, even though she was sitting in a more attention-seeking pose than a bodyguard should, and her bearing was that of a fighter. So that was the ‘skirt’ Obie had promised... On the other end of the sofa was a handsome, vaguely familiar dark-haired man with 80s-typical slightly longer locks, and another man standing by the window, almost out of Tony’s field of vision. A tall, blond, short-haired…
Tony’s eyes widened for a second. Steve had a brief moment where he wanted to take it back. It was too much, of course, he knew that.
had been his worst regret; not Stane’s betrayal, not being tortured in a cave, not being ostracized by his own team.
Tony rushed into his apartment and, without stopping anywhere, went straight for the bathroom, still not saying a word. A minute later, Steve heard the shower and decided to start a pot of coffee as Tony was probably going straight back to work.
Tony pushed past him, not saying a word, and that didn’t change for the entire ride home. Steve got the feeling he was still upset but that was only natural. It was a busted deal after all.
Putting his head in his left hand, he let his index and middle fingers wander over the dress, pressing the plastic arms together after trailing over them, rubbing at the spot on the ass he had hit before, then going back up putting index finger and thumb on each side of the doll’s neck. He let the fingertip roll along that indescribably fragile-looking part of Doll-Tony’s body.
“Oh, look. Take your fill.” If Steve’s finger had looked large juxtaposed to the doll, his dick was enormous. He gave it a firm stroke and allowed his breathing to become heavy. There was no chance of Tony bratting off so close to the finish line. “Yes, that is your doing.” Steve again placed a finger between the garter strips, this time his thumb.
Stevens flushed scarlet and Tony almost laughed out loud. If it were someone else, the continued silence might’ve been power play but inexplicably, Tony had a feeling that the other man was simply too flustered to do anything else. Excitement thrumming in his blood, Tony smirked.
He could tell Peggy. She would never let him do that. Not to Tony. She couldn’t. Steve had to believe that.
Anthony raised a mocking eyebrow at him and the sight was so familiar that Steve gasped for air. “If you are already up anyway…” Anthony said and opened Steve’s pants. They fell, and the air felt cool against his skin. He wasn’t— He shouldn’t— All those thoughts led nowhere and a sharp smack to his thigh directed Steve’s focus back to Tony.
“I’m glad you’ve come far enough to start thinking about the future, but this is not the way,” Stane went on, hopefully oblivious to Tony’s distress. “See how rattled some of the directors were? Next time run whatever you want to say by me first, yes?”
Tony pushes Steve on the couch, kisses him aggressively. Tony is very domly, dismissive, and Steve reacts by being passive, letting go of any resistance. He does want it, likes it, but he is emotionally conflicted about it. He feels it is wrong to have sex with young Tony but can’t say no anyway. For the first time, he starts thinking that maybe this was what he wanted from Tony all these years.
currently working in our factories. They are not all wealthy, Tony. I expected you’d understand that much.”
He thought of little Natasha somewhere in Russia being already trained to be a Red Room agent. And Clint and Bruce in their shitty situations wherever they were. He would help them. He would, but not yet. For now, eradicating Hydra had to take priority.
This was just an incredibly improbable coincidence. Just a tall strong man who looked like Captain America and liked working out.
Tony, who was sitting on the couch with the business news TV and some scientific journal in his hands, subjected Steve to a glare out of squinting eyes.
After swallowing a hopefully reasonable amount of Tylenol, he stumbled back to the bedroom for fresh clothes.
“Why do you think he only ever leaves the apartment for our shift?” he asked, trying to keep Rumlow’s profile in his view.
“I hope you make good progress on your projects today,” Steve told Anthony, but the only reaction he got was Lowell’s fake-looking grin.
“Day after tomorrow. Our tuxes are getting delivered. You have an appointment to check out the venue tomorrow.”
“If everything is alright, I’ll go down and check in with Lowell,” Rumlow said in a measured voice, “I’ll tell her we’re back early.”
Seeing Rumlow’s ugly youthful face in the doorway put his dick instantly down, thank Tesla for small mercies.
“I’ll leave you to your work then,” Stane said when Anthony remained silent, “but don’t overwork that beautiful head of yours.” He got up.
“Oh god, you are like a puppy that got whacked with the newspaper roll. Just because I don’t want you sitting in my lap while doing research, there is no reason for you to look like that.”
Steve could follow Tony taking the lube from the table from the corner of his eyes but he didn’t dare to look anywhere but at his face. When Tony straddled him, their eyes finally met, and Steve felt like he could breathe again. Tony smirked in response. He sank down on Steve’s dick without any other preparation or words.
Andrew visibly inhaled and bore down as he pushed the finger in with force, straight up to the second knuckle and all the breath left Tony’s lungs. Shit.
He needed to make sure Obie wouldn’t start lobbying against him, so he’d met with Obie’s shady business partners and made nice. He hadn’t promised them anything, just let himself be paraded before them like a prized pony and smiled. If Obie promised them anything behind his back, it was his problem.
“This is indeed a much better way of doing this.” Tony finally had his cock in hand and was stroking it slowly, with a mocking grin on his face.
“Here you are, sir,” Andrew said, almost smiling back. He put the plate and the coffee on the desk near Tony’s elbow and remained standing next to him in a parade rest.
Tony was coming closer, moving slowly and deliberately and Steve actually pulled himself up to his full height.
Tony suppressed his instinctual panic and, resisting looking at St— behind him, walked slowly to his car with purposeful strides. If Andrew was on their side, Tony was doomed, but in the end there was only one person who Tony needed to focus on.
Surprisingly strong hands guided him down on the couch and rolled a condom over his very enthusiastic erection. Tony snapped his fingers and Steve's attention darted upwards.
“You’re not sleeping either,” Tony couldn’t help but point out. “Isn’t it a little hypocritical of you?” He stepped further away from the desk, stretching and yawning obnoxiously, hoping to make Stane believe that what he was hiding wasn’t actually that important. “It’s one a.m. and here you are, in the lab, an hour away from your own bed.”
But however promiscuous Tony naturally was, none of it made it okay for Steve having done what he had. Tony was too young. The vow to make it up to Anthony was thrumming through Steve’s consciousness like an aching need. Steve would— Andrew. It was Andrew who would need to make it up to Tony. If only he would let him.
Steve was passing building after building, and for the last twenty minutes they’d all been unfamiliar. The few people that were still walking along the dark sidewalks got out of his way hastily or even changed to the other side of the street as soon as they could see his form in the distance. People kept saying that the neighborhood was unsafe after sundown, but Steve had never been lucky enough to have someone attempt at robbing him
Sitting down as instructed, Steve watched Tony busying himself with putting the coffee machine on. He had his back to Steve and was taking his time with pressing the buttons, as if trying to delay sitting down and actually looking at Steve.
Steve’s throat was hurting, and the taste of latex was everywhere; he could hear himself making sputtering sounds, trying to breathe and drooling even more in the process. His blood was rushing in his ears and he got only parts of what else Tony was saying. There was a constant stream of words now as if a dam had broken.
Tony was reading through some notes he carried in a locked briefcase that Steve was pretty sure sported something more than just your basic number lock. At a traffic light, Steve had time to peer into the rearview mirror for any additional signs of weariness, but found none.
In the elevator, Lowell tried making eye contact with Tony but he purposefully ignored her. She glanced at Steve and exited for their tiny, tiny apartment one floor below Tony’s with a smirk on her face. 'All yours' it seemed to say. Steve didn’t even blink at the irritation. She was not worth wasting his emotions on.
Steve wasn’t helping here, and he sure as hell wasn’t making any progress with infiltrating Hydra. He was becoming chummy with Rumlow, and if he asked for Steve to join him in some atrocity tomorrow, he might just need to do it. It was the only way to get where he needed to be. But if he did it, if he joined in with whatever heinous acts Rumlow and his Hydra pals were doing, he wouldn’t even deserve the chance of helping Tony.
When Stane disappeared behind a door that must’ve led to the bedroom, Rumlow sneered. “Precious little corporate prince! He is lucky that Pierce wants his daddy’s tech so much. Otherwise, no one would give a damn if his body washed up on the shore somewhere.”
Everything seemed fine and when he entered the building, the elevator doors opened, revealing Stevens.
A hundred times. That’s what Steve had told him after locking him up over a month ago. He would only get unlocked after Steve had come into his mouth or his ass one hundred times. Steve would take good care of him of course, unlock him regularly to clean him and milk him to make sure that there were no bad consequences, but Tony has not even had a hard on in 34 days. Not for lack of trying on his cock’s behalf. It was maddening, made him horny like he probably hadn’t ever been in his life.
Andrew had been slowly trailing his fingers up and down between his ass cheeks, probing gently as if teasing himself or maybe he was waiting for something.
Tony leaned on the shower wall and let the water sluice down his side. Yes. He should just fuck Andrew as soon as he arrived and then Tony could finally concentrate on his work. Turning the water off, he stepped out of the shower and dried himself.
“You love being my whore.” It’s not a question. Steve’s voice is warm, telling how much he likes it too.
“Something new? Hasn’t it been long enough already?” Stane said, with an edge of derision in his voice. “What’s going on with you, son?”
A/N: Discard what you know about MCU CW movie. Bucky really died in WW2, so the CW happened differently.
“These are Agents Madden and Stevens,” Rumlow said equally indifferently. “You won’t see much of them. Agent Lowell is one of our best assets, and she will be your protective detail from now until 7 a.m. Agent Madden is on back-up, and Stevens and I will cover the day shift."
“Does it matter?" Tony asked. "It’s outside normal operating parameters anyway. It doesn’t have to be perfect, just workable."
“Go on then; take those off.” Tony motioned at Steve’s pants and underwear pooling around his ankles. Automatically, Steve did as he was told and he couldn’t keep up the distinction anymore. Anthony was Tony. Would be but also already was anyway.
Another eight hours went by before they drove Anthony back to the apartment. And then, unexpectedly, the rest of the team were called off on a short mission making Steve pull another shift alone with him. This was concerning. It was clearly a Hydra mission, but on the other hand — would Steve want to leave Anthony alone or leave the job to an unknown agent? No.
Tony got to work on opening his button and then slowly, slowly his zipper. Drool was starting to pool behind Steve’s teeth and it wouldn’t take much longer before flowing over and dropping down his chin.
Steve thought he might have believed it. Maybe even Stane himself still believed it. They talked a bit more, introducing each agent and discussing schedules, and Steve couldn’t help but be distracted by trying to listen to the sounds in the apartment. Where was T— Anthony?
