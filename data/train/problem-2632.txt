Scrambling to slide his phone into his pocket, Castiel nearly face planted into the door as he squinted into the peephole. Confirmed; six feet of freckles and sandy hair stood in his hallway, staring down at his feet and leaving a precious voicemail—
The woman nodded, her curls bouncing, and her beaded earrings jingling. “I’ve never met an angel, but in our psychic circles, angels have been known to communicate. Some argued they aren’t angels at all, but just powerful, positive spirits. Obviously, as we found out yesterday, that’s untrue.”
Anna shut her eyes and leaned forward, sliding down his shaft, squeezing her muscles around his cock. She carried on fucking him, but Dean felt entirely filled with memories he didn’t understand.
With Ashley not in the building, they had to find another way of speaking to her. That other way, it seemed, required Dean to flirt heavily with the receptionist, while Castiel tried to ignore the blood rushing in his ears and the horrible feeling in his chest. He watched the receptionist giggle at Dean and decided he didn't like her at all. Her name was Rhonda. What a stupid name.
Pamela walked into the room with a pile of books in her arms and shrugged at Bobby. “These ones are okay. We lost a few of the encyclopedias, a copy of the Bible, and almost the entirety of your Agatha Christie collection, Bobby,” Pamela said, wincing over the top of her books. “Sorry, baby.”
The plastic plate Cas had pulled down from the cupboard was Cars-themed, but the grinning face of the red car was blocked as Cas arranged cubes of cheddar cheese on it, pulling them from the containers.
Dean exchanged looks with Charlie, then he nodded. “She and Daniel butt heads at first. She wants him to serve his purpose in this grand scheme, but he doesn’t understand why he has to do anything for Heaven, who hadn’t done anything for him in his life.”
“I…” Jamie looked lost, looking between the brothers and wincing. “I remember a fight? But just, like, bits and pieces. As Cas got desperate near the end, they told me they’d have to eject themselves to escape. I don’t think they were winning the fight.”
“We’re sorry, Dean,” Kevin murmured. “It’s terrible, what you two are going through, but, I mean...we all warned you.”
Many thanks to the greatest people you'll ever meet and my two betas for this chapter: MalMuses & son_of_a_bitch_spn_family
An hour later, three sets of dance numbers, and one large final performance that involved Castiel doing very elegant and athletic aerial tricks on a suspended sash of baby blush silk, the club was dark. Most lights came from candles on the tables, or deliberately pointed spotlights on platforms, topped with dancing angels, or from the bars. Loud, jazzy music wafted through the air, urging the hips of angels and their patrons, encouraging flirting, and pulling money from the pockets of those seeking erotic services. Every few minutes, angels came and went from the service rooms, pulling in paying customers behind them, swinging their joined hands or stumbling into the darkness, connected by their lips. Partners—or groups—disappeared and came back out looking satisfied, clothing disheveled.
The trenchcoat slipped away from the back of Dean’s hands, hitting the floor with the sound of rustling fabric, puddling around their shoes, and Cas pulled away from their kiss to stare at Dean, his brows knitted but eyes on fire.
When he blinked the bursting fireworks from behind his eyes, giving his head a shake, he saw Cas turned to the side, holding his fist to his chest, his face scrunched up.
And he broke the tension by sitting up and wrapping his arm around her, tugging her close to him and onto his lap. Their breath puffed across each other’s lips as they stared at each other, only inches away from kissing again.
Feeling much better, Dean walked around the room as he explained his vision for the scene. “...and then, Zyon
Sam | 11:25am (Sunday,  September 19, 2019): this is not funny. You know i worry about you already with dad and like you know. Other stuff. AND THEN you’re joking about putting yourself in really bad situations. How am i supposed to feel okay about being so far away when youre doing this kind of shit
“But now, we’re like forty minutes past my check-in time, and we still gotta bring the Impala back to Sam, because he wanted to drive out to some beach that I have no freakin’ interest in going to. Sand gets in really weird places and—” Dean waved a hand, licking his upper lip with the tip of his tongue, dismissing himself. “Anyway, we got other hunter-related stuff to do now, and Sam’s gonna want a de-brief, and just...I guess the fucking like wild animals thing can wait.”
“Please stop,” he begged, feeling raw, feeling exhausted. His stomach hurt, he felt nauseous, and the orgasms were horrible. They hurt, they were clearly urged on by something unnatural because his body was fighting it. His abs, pelvis, and thighs were spasming, squeezing painfully, almost uncontrollably. The very thought of having another orgasm in this short period of time was making him want to hurl.
“If you’re really lookin’ to help me and save me some driving time,” Bobby growled, “then maybe kick your own ungrateful ass so I don’t gotta!”
The fox-like grin and wink he threw her in the mirror did little to dissuade her, but she didn’t seem to lose some tension in her shoulders.
Dean leaned back and smirked, though it was a facade because his stomach was twisted into knots at the thought of being alone with that angel. “Just the two of us, huh?”
Dean’s hands slid from Cas’ face as their head turned and tilted, their noses bumping and then settling against each other’s cheeks. Dean’s palms pressed against Cas’ chest, feeling desperately for that strong heartbeat. Dean found it, and discovered that it was thumping fast, if a bit wildly.
Dean stepped towards her, dragging his teeth over his bottom lip. With piercing, concentrated eyes, he stared at her and reached out, hands cupping either side of her face.
The next day, Dean paced up and down the library table, a stack of pages in his hand. Sam flapped at a throw piece of paper, waving it away from his face. Dean read a second page and flung that one too, muttering under his breath.
Nearly a quarter of an hour later, sitting up and grabbing a beer from the beside, Dean asked nervously, "Your vessel... You said she’d be cool with sex. I gotta know how that came up."
It couldn’t be helped. Dean released a bark of laughter, which he quickly tried to stifle when her other brow raised to match the first one. “Sorry,” he chuckled, gesturing to the air with his beer. “It’s just, I mean, who hurt you?”
"I don't know," Cas' panted, looking down at her hand, coated in blood. She flicked it in disgust and repeated, raising her eyes to Dean, "I don't have an explanation."
“She has doubts about who she is,” Castiel said slowly, shaking her head, her brown waves bouncing around her face. “She begins to question everything she’s ever known, she begins to feel emotions she didn’t think she knew how to. Forbidden things. Human things. Fear, passion, longing—”
“Good point,” Dean said, nodding. He turned to look at Bobby in the rear-view mirror. “What do we know about angels, Bobby?”
Ruby stood up straighter and smirked. “I,” she tipped her chin back, “got ‘em chasing the prophet. They should be on their way to Chuck as we speak.”
“I was always told to have faith,” Castiel breathed, pushing a concentrated exhale through her lips. “And I always did, I think. Curious as it is now, how now I lack faith for the things I should trust, and have an abundance of it for the one thing I’m told I shouldn’t. “
The look of disgust her face was instant and hilarious. Dean laughed behind his hand and said, “ Wow, jeeze, Cas. Sorry for asking?”
The swipe badge in Hannah’s hand had stopped working. They all hovered around a door, Dean and Cas shifting together nervously at the back, as Hannah growled and swiped again. The door made an angry sound, and the keypad flashed red.
“Don’t bother,” Balthazar murmured. “I’ll cancel rehearsal for today. Castiel is furious, I know her, she won’t come out of her room for the next few days. There...is really no point if she’s not there. We’ll pick up again during the week.”
Beside him, Sam jumped when his phone went off in his pocket. Chuck looked like he had a heart attack, clutching at his chest. With a worried look on his face, Sam flipped open the phone and pressed it to his ear.
With delicious mystery meat steaming in front of his lips, Castiel asked, “That’s quite the battle. Who won?”
“Do I look like a ditchable prom date to you?” Uriel yelled, the typical slow gravel of his tone sounding odd with his voice raised. He turned on Castiel, putting his hands at his sides. It was odd to see him wearing work clothes in-person—black suit, crisp white dress shirt open at the top buttons, and thankfully, actual pants and not boxer shorts like Castiel always imagined.
Behind him, in the doorway to the nursery, Dean heard Cas growl and then he was shoving past him, leaving Dean unable to help as his daughter squirmed in his arms. “Cas, no!”
"I can't—Don't. I—" Dean choked out, speaking for the first time about Cas. He'd been able to contribute to the plan, to strategize with them when they realised they could use Jack to trap God in the Empty and finish things. He'd be able to call their friends, Jody, Donna, even Becky, to ensure they were alive. Those words had come easily, they’d been a script.
“It ain’t an angel blade, but it’s just as important,” Dean said, his wet lips breaking into a grin.
The glass separating Hannah and Naomi in the hallway from the babies in the nursery shattered as Castiel fired a series of warning shots.
It was like Castiel hadn’t heard. He continued to stare at his dead child, his fingers brushing brown hair from his lifeless blue eyes. Dean wondered how Castiel hadn’t caught on earlier; the blue was uncanny.
Castiel felt ridiculously lost as he put on some casual blue khakis and a black sweater, wondering if he was appropriately dressed. Dean had seen him in t-shirts and jeans, both times sweaty and probably extremely unappealing, so Castiel dug around in his dresser and pulled out a pair of pants he hadn’t worn since Naomi’s work gala a few years ago. She’d bought him clothing, not thinking him trustworthy enough to dress himself, especially since she’d wanted him to
“If it makes you feel any better,” Dean said quietly, still smiling, although with a strange wince to his eyes, “the first time I came out to anyone, it was through some drunk as fuck bawling.”
“Because,” Dean said angrily, lifting his head and fixing a furious gaze on Castiel, his green eyes simultaneously dark and incredibly bright. “Because it took near-death for Sam to finally drag his ass to the hospital. M-My...My dad asks about him
“I stole it from the infirmary,” Dean explained, straightening out the cord and leaning over the end of the bed to plug it into an outlet high on the wall, that looked like it might have at one time been for a lamp meant to sit on the desk below. “It took like all day of forcing myself to throw up so that they’d keep me there. I wanted to be out sooner, but they kept a pretty good eye on me. I waited until the guard went for a washroom break, then shoved a finger down my throat and puked all over the nurse. It was like the only time they left me alone, but I managed to grab it from one of their drawers and hide it under the sheets until they let me go. While I was changing, I wrapped it around my waist. They didn’t suspect a thing, the idiots.”
With a little crooked smile, Dean snorted softly, accepting the black lid and resting his hip on the front bumper of the Mustang as he screwed on the top. “Sorry. Head in the clouds.”
! First, I told you she’s not the relationship type, she doesn’t do love and all that stuff. If you fall for her, you’ll get hurt!” Charlie settled back into her chair, snapping up her drink with an angry flourish of her hand. “And second, if the duke finds out, you put all of Heaven in jeopardy.”
Dean scowled. “Why are you friends with her? She seemed, I dunno, upset with you too. She hardly seemed happy to be your understudy.”
Dean pulled his head up from her shoulder and stared at her, their breath mingling hotly in the inch between their lips. “I don’t get it,” he admitted.
“Oh my God!” Sam burst out, cringing with his entire body like if Dean didn’t leave, he’d start swinging. “Just get out! Fucking walk home for all I care, just get out, I can’t even look at you.”
“It’s not funny!” he snapped, and as Dean walked around him, jingling the keys in his hand, Sam held out his arms and exclaimed, “Is there really some still left on my face? Hey, turn around and tell me! All I can smell is spleen.”
They both laughed, Castiel bowing his head to chuckle damply into his hand, a tear dribbling over his fingers.
They were left alone for an hour, but then a buzzer went off and their cell doors opened. Castiel was alarmed at the sound, jolted up from his bed. His roommate got up with a sigh, easing himself down to the floor from his bunk and nodding out into the hallway.
“Of course,” the Duke replied, his voice rough. “I cannot deny there is certainly a spark between us. I was hoping to explore that a bit more tonight, actually…”
“Dean’s escaped,” she said bluntly, pulling her hand out of her pocket to gesture vaguely behind her. “He’s gone. How did that happen?”
Behind Dean, Sam looked up at Castiel’s face, then down to the cupid. “What happened? D-Did he attack you?”
Her thirty-five year old ass did not appreciate being referred to a little-anything, and she was pretty sure her GED and the one-year office administration community college course did not qualify her to do anything in IT. She was pretty sure a blind monkey would know how to copy and paste, but such thoughts were better left in her head.
“You should really read it,” Cas’ voice was quiet as it floated from Dean’s room. “It’s...intriguing.”
“I’m so tired,” Cas went on, exhaling heavily, shaking his head against Dean’s face, their cheeks brushing. “I’ve grown tired of this
Not waiting for approval, Jamie pushed open the door of the Impala. Conscious of putting one foot in front of the other and not tripping on these stupid heels while Dean, Sam, and Chuck were watching, she forced herself to approach the house. When she got to the steps, each tap of her shoes against the white-painted wood nearly made her puke. Her cheeks tingled as blood rushed to them.
Dean swallowed, his throat feeling rough. Hoarsely, he replied, “Go for it, Cas. I’m not gonna spy on you.”
But nervous or not, he was fucking pretty, so Castiel drank his beer and nodded occasionally, listening intently to how stupid Dean found fidget spinners until curiosity got the better of them and they began to explore.
Dean set down his fork and picked up his glass quickly, needing something to do before tears got the better of him. His chest was a mess of anxiety since the morning, and his hands were on the brink of shaking. Being separated from Cas was the first straw to break the camel’s back, but the idea that Cas would be taken from The Facility completely and be dismembered like Inias… That was a nightmare to top all nightmares. Dean felt sick.
Exhaustion tugged Castiel to sleep, and Dean followed him from his worried thoughts into his dreams.
Beside them, Sam was twirling Hannah, who laughed with her head tilted back, the beer bottle in her hand forgotten as her skirt twirled around her legs, the beads in her dress flashing erratically, reflecting the colorful lights that flashed from the stage. Dean turned to Cas, who bounced a bit in his arms, her curls jumping around her shoulders and down her back. She looked happy and amused, watching Hannah.
Forgetting about Dean, Sam, and Kevin all ran towards the tower, their feet splashing in puddles that grew as the mist turned to fully formed drops of rain. Dean gripped onto the key in his first, determined not to lose it among the other jingling keys. As he ran up the steps, his breath puffing out of his lungs in a panic, he regretted every word he said to Cas, and regretted every making her feel like anything other than the extraordinary woman she was. He’d spend forever trying to make it up to her.
Cas’ breath came out in a hitched exhale—Dean might’ve thought it was a sob if he wasn’t smiling, an overjoyed breathy laugh falling from his lips. “I never thought I’d have this.”
It was probably his imagination, but he felt the hands of an angel card through his hair and pull him forward. His body felt weightless as it was pulled into her arms and his face pressed into fabric. The smell of cinnamon and lemon was all he could register before the world went completely black, and Dean Winchester died.
Dean’s face split into a grin and his eyes pinched at the corners in amusement. “Depends. Are you saying you’d come with me?”
“You think you will?” Dean asked, and she saw a flicker of fear that he tried to hide. In his own hands, the Dorito bag was forgotten. “Do...you think Cas will come back?”
” Uriel warned, raising a hand to stop him from speaking. “That was part of our orders. We were ordered to listen to you, to do as you wished. It was a trial to analyze how you would do in...battlefield conditions.”
“Yeah, well, can’t be letting you down on date night, right?” Dean said matter of factly, walking quickly out of his row and yanking his jacket off his shoulders. He briefly fought with his jacket when he got an arm stuck in it, but he won eventually and flung it across the church, barely missing the vigil of candles and a painted picture of the virgin Mary.
He smelled like cigars and leather. She inhaled deeply. Her fingers dug into the wood of the door behind her back.
They both seemed to realise what Dean had said at the same time. Dean’s stare dipped away and he cleared his throat, sliding his hand back out of Castiel’s hair. Castiel could feel his panic, the gay panic Castiel was just starting to realise had been there for most of their relationship, sitting at the core of Dean’s insecurities. They’d been written plain as day on his face and Castiel had misconstrued those moments as regret, but—
Leave me a comment and let me know your thoughts about the story so far or this chapter is particular! <3 I love hearing from y'all, it's such a great motivator.
Entirely overtaken by the energy, Dean cried out, and then a bright, hot golden light burst from the center of his palm. The energy illuminated the entire room like a bomb had gone off, and as a hot, power-filled blast of wind blew around hair and clothing and flapped the worn, dusty curtains like the giant wings of a bat, Dean saw Alastair throw out his arms and scream for the last time.
Cas looked up at Dean. Uncrossing her legs, she dug her stilettos into the sand, stopping her swing. She sat still in the seat, just as Dean was. They stared at each other around the chains that held up the swings for a few beats, then she admitted, “I have doubts, Dean. I do...
He couldn’t focus on the prospect of cleaning up the body, or cleaning himself up—not when he was crushed under the realization that the pain hadn’t gone away.
A tear dropped over her lashes and dragged down her smooth face, leaving a pale trail through makeup. The moment it dripped down off her chin, Dean rushed forward and placed his hands on her face, pulling her in close, his forehead pressing against hers.
One man tried to ask what was happening, where they were, what they were expected to do, but everyone quickly realised that asking questions wasn’t an option.
“Dean!” Pam repeated, stepping into the room. “You’re alive! You’re back… Oh,” she said again, this time, her words dissolving into a pitying
Those were the nights that Dean began to dread, as he knew he’d have to watch the Duke drool over Castiel more than usual. With Thursdays being her night, when she was the main act, when she wore the least amount of clothing, and easily looked the most like a real angel, beautiful and ethereal, it was easily the way the Duke liked her the most. Dean figured the Duke walked around with a perpetual boner in his pants at just the thought in Cas under the limelight, her body sparkling, her eyes dark and sultry under heavy lashes and smoked out eye kohl.
“Well, you sound like a big idiot, so there,” Dean replied mockingly, hitting Sam in the stomach with his rolled-up script.
Frantic, Castiel fumbled for his back pocket, yanking his list out and opening the highlighted schedule, his eyes scanning it in a panic. “I thought they were tomorrow—oh
Dean smirked, his tongue darting out to swipe a green olive that was sliding down his bun into his mouth. “You
Dean stared at her, his mouth opening and closing a few times. For a moment, he was sure he’d misheard. “What?”
She stepped towards him, her feet squelching as the blood that ran down her legs soaked the carpet. “Blood was running down his arm from his hand and you drank it like it was in your nature,” she hissed, sounding disgusted. Her face, which he dreamed about but only remembered being loving, was twisted in hatred. “You drank, and drank, and then he said, ‘I knew I’d come to the right place’, and he turned to Sam. He turned to Sam and he dripped blood into my baby’s mouth.”
Dean was no longer scrubbing blood from the rug. Rather, Sam found him throwing on his jacket and turning around to follow the sound of the door opening.
Dean’s lip twitched up in the corner and he reached back, shuffling the chair away from the table. He held up one finger to silence him.
Castiel stared at herself in the mirror, then she said, “I got eighteen lashes. One for ‘every year I spent growing up to be an ungrateful little fool’, as Naomi put it.”
“Yes, I was hoping I could get some information from you. See, I have some follow up questions for your nanny. Stevie, was it?”
“—went to sleep, like I told you not to,” Anna scolded, but Sam didn’t miss the way Anna’s arm tightened around her sister.
“Um, well, less naughty and more romantic, really,” he suggested, shrugging. When her eyebrows shot up and she looked thrown for a moment, Dean prattled on. “I have lots of ideas. Y’know, from dreams. I’ll tell you all about them.”
“Who’s the chick?” Dean asked later, hidden in the darkness of the unlit room when Sam had returned.
Dean jolted into a stride around the bed, snatching the stack from Ash. “That’s my writing! It’s private!”
. It coulda been Sam or Charlie or Jody that got her sick. We’ve had a bunch of people come over to help us out. Stop—”
“Tread lightly,” Castiel interrupted, her eyes narrowing. “It does no good to sow the seed of suspicion with our allies. Confer with the Host. They can bend time and space, and they can view what happened, should we alert them to malpractice.”
He only lived on the fourth floor, so the elevator ride was quick, but Dean managed to tell him all about why his toilet had been replaced. It was “old as shit”, and Castiel spent at least twenty seconds straight-faced, trying to determine if that was a poop pun and trying to decide if he should be laughing. By the time he decided he should have laughed, it was too late. So, instead, he stood stiffly against the elevator railing and stared at himself in the mirrored wall, trying to figure out why this gorgeous man wanted to come back to his place to ‘talk’ when Castiel looked so gross. Sweaty and flushed, his hair a mess and still kind of damp at his temples. He wondered if he should jump in the shower first, just in case—
Soon, his face was slick with spit, his mouth sweet with the musky, fresh taste of Cas’ body wash, and Cas’ thighs trembled under his stroking hand. Blindly, Dean was massaging the tip of Cas’ cock, spreading pre-come over the head and jerking him off with saliva he’d spit into his hand. It wasn’t romantic and candle-lit love making, but it was very
Regardless, Castiel turned off the coffee machine and snatched the note off the front, scrunching it up in his one hand while the other poured the sharp, dark coffee into the sink. He watched it swirl down the drain with distaste.
Dean pressed his palm against his head, like the picture was burned into the flesh of his hand. “—of what my life was supposed to look like. As soon as I took over the store, he was obsessed with recreating the thing he had with mom. I had to find a nice girl, someone who was nice and fun and chill like mom, who could give him grandkids and run the store with me. S-Someone who had a nice smile and liked classic rock. And now he’s
Cas noticed him staring at it and she swallowed visibly, the noise alerting him to something he hadn’t thought her capable of; shyness. Immediately, she reached down to try and tug the white shirt back on, but Dean stopped her with a raised hand.
Well, that wasn’t as smooth or romantic as Castiel had meant the moment to be. “Uh, sure” was certainly not the reply he’d envisioned, and he immediately regretted asking, but Dean moved back onto the bed.
“I gotta go to her service rooms to pitch the play,” Dean said with a groan. “I don’t even know where that is.”
The angels all nodded to each other and turned to return to the street where the original chaos had begun. Fire from the exploded cars still roared, ripping the air at the end of the alley.
That had been a day ago. Or more? Who knew. The only thing Dean knew was that with his stomach and veins pumped full of demon blood, the iron door, pentagram spinning above his head, and salt-ingrained walls, he felt sick to his stomach. At first, it had been mild nausea and a general feeling of malady. Hours later, he was sweating and shaking, his skin switching from tight goosebumps to intense, enraging itching.
“Yes, we lied to the demon. She did not know of the plan to conjure Michael. As far as she was concerned, we wanted Lucifer to set the planet ablaze, to see him rise as she did. We created a story of wanting Heaven and Hell to come together, to serve under Lucifer. Something, something, something, armies combined, something, something, Lucifer understands both our teams, etcetera.”
It never came alone. It was always egged on by anger or sadness. Often guilt. This time? With his stomach sated by demon blood, he felt shame follow a deep, overwhelming satisfaction. He was so fucking full, like he’d eaten a meaty steak dinner. The absence of hunger had him feeling so relaxed and powerful that he couldn’t help but feel intense shame. He should want to stick his fingers down his throat and empty himself of this abominable sickness inside him, but he’d tried, alone in the bathroom with the shower running. He’d tried to force himself to be sick, but it hadn’t worked. His body refused to reject it, like the blood was home, where it belonged.
The water running distracted Castiel, pulling him away from the hand kneading his balls and the teeth dragging down his neck. It was nearly everything he’d imagined, but sudden nerves got the better of him. Could he really do this? He’d been human for a drop in the bucket of time; he didn’t have the experience Dean had. Could he really go through with this?
Dean threw that idea out the window—literally. Down in the street under his balcony, the ball of paper no doubt bounced off the head of an unfortunate bystander, a victim to Dean’s writer block.
Everyone exchanged looks. Sam seemed hesitant, swallowing and pursing his lips, shuffling away every so slightly, his fingers rubbing his palms at his side.
The hospital released him the following morning, but after paperwork and filing prescription drugs, and Sam ensuring Dean got his greasy lunch to wash down the horrible hospital food, it was check out at the motel. While Sam went in to check out, Dean sat in the Impala, trying not to vomit. Not because of the sketchy fries, but because Cas had said no. Once again, he was leaving her. It felt horrendous and he wished he knew what he could’ve said additionally or better than what he’d come up with to make her stay. To put the cherry on top of the cake, now he was leaving Leia too.
holding hands, Castiel felt a flutter of panic in his stomach anyway at the idea that he wasn’t allowed to have a relationship lest the government punish him. It, like many other things in this place, didn’t seem like something that should be governed by anyone other than the individual.
The way he felt about Cas had nothing to do with heats or pheromones or the smell before the rain. None of that existed in their universe and it hardly needed to, not when Dean already wanted to have Cas near, and he’d already been inside of Cas, their sweaty skin pressed together and their lips brushing in Dean’s sweetest dreams and most private thoughts.
“Castiel,” Amelia said softly, reaching over and sliding her hand over Dean’s—when had he put that there? Leaning on the surface heavily, for balance.
As if on cue, a few piano notes twinkled through the air and Norah Jones’ soothing, romantic voice wafted through the air like summer-time lilac.
“If you’re curious about panties, Cas, you should read Undercover Angel,” Sam suggested. He waved his hand over to Dean’s mirror and sink. “I think most of it is hanging around in that corner. Or I could send you the link--”
"Esper and Malacai will take you your cell.  Put on the clothing, eat, and rest. The nephil needs nutrients, and you'll need your strength for the birth. If you're anything like your counterpart, your births will be painful. Bloody."
"I've been put on a probationary demotion. Uriel will lead the garrison until my superiors feel I've...understood my role, and strengthened my resolve in regards to the mission. They," she lifted her gaze, and Dean was surprised to see the ghost of tears in her eyes, "believe I may rebel. They believe that by allowing myself to feel emotions, I've stepped through the doorway to doubt. I'm not useful that way."
Dean had no idea where she was going to get more because he was fresh out of plotlines. He ran his hands over his face and let them slide off. Irritated now, just wanting to get out of here, Dean waved his hands, trying to gesture to her that he had nothing left to offer.
“Yes, about that,” Zachariah said, gesturing towards the blade, his brows raised. “That toothpick isn’t going to do anything to kill her. She’s Lucifer’s first demon. She’s not a small fry, Dean. She’s one of the strongest demons you’ll ever face. To kill her, you’ll have to be better, be stronger.”
Again, the name did a number of terrible, horrible, amazing things to his knees and stomach. The butterflies went insane, flapping and throwing themselves around like they wanted to burst from inside him and fly free. The name made him feel special. It almost made it seem like they were friends.
Today's chapter is a bit of a shortie, but a goodie! You'll know why I cut it off once you get to the end... (It's because I'm evil.)
Sam pressed send with gusto and reopened the website again, settling back in his chair. He tossed back the rest of his smoothie and placed it down with a cheery tap on the table top. Putting his feet up, he rested the laptop on his legs, thrumming with excitement.
Hester shook out the last dregs of milk from the blue carton and sighed, setting it aside. “It seems Hannah was the only one privvy to the location. She’ll be leading us out as soon as the flames fade to embers at And…” Hester’s voice cracked for a moment and she didn’t bother trying to finish her sentence. Her blue eyes gazed out painfully through the window over the sink, staring out into the back field. “He was very young, you know. For an angel.”
“That’s all for us!” Sam interrupted, clapping his hand down onto the table as a warning to Dean. “Thank you so much, Patty.”
“I’m glad you like it,” Dean whispered, no longer able to back up or lean away, not when she had essentially expressed interest in the play idea. It’s all he’d promised Charlie. Castiel seemed to be in with the story, and frankly, she seemed to have returned to the idea of having sex and Dean wasn’t about to deny the girl what she wanted if she was going to convince Balthazar and the investor to go through with his story.
He showed up and ate with the others, but he was entirely aware of the worried glances shot his way in between awkward attempts at regular conversation.
She stood on the far side of the room while he stayed near the window, and they stared at each other. A real tension, a feeling of welcome anticipation hung heavily in the air between them, following the understanding that she’d come here for an experience he’d advertised to her.
It was the priest, a man in his late thirties with a bit of greying hair at his temples, and a tan that looked worn. He appeared to be the type of man who’d spent a few years teaching surfing on a beach to college kids before finding Jesus and committing himself to the life. He looked—
Dean stayed buried in Cas’ neck for a few extra seconds. They both breathed hard and under his face, Cas shook. With effort, he pulled himself up and watched as Cas curled onto her side, grabbed the second blade, and yanked it out of her own hand with a strangled yell. When it clattered to the ground, she fumbled to push herself onto her knees, her injured hands held out to her side like they were an annoyance.
“I’m clean,” she said, and she held out her arms. “And clothed. Your t-shirt is loose on me, but that’s all right?”
!?” Naomi shrieked, her voice cracking in ways Castiel hadn’t ever heard before. Her fists curled at her sides were glowing still, power crackling from them, flickering like flares of lightning.
Sam stared at Chuck for a minute, then shook his head. He raised his brows and looked pointedly at Dean. “Wanna try Cas again then? Prophecy happened, and now we’re just waiting for the bridge to be fixed. I think she’d be safe to help us out now.”
Dean cried out. Hannah and Sam jumped at his outburst, his voice carrying over the open field. “You… You just said he’s been up there for weeks, and it’s only been a day here. If we don’t leave today, it’ll be another fucking coupla weeks, Castiel!”
John exhaled in a rattle and coughed. After a struggle to catch his breath—Dean raised himself out of his seat to help him slide an oxygen mask over his mouth—he raised his eyebrows and wheezed, “You have fun at the festival, son?”
Just like when he’d arrived on Castiel’s property, he was lost on what to say, where to start first.
, yes. ‘She’ was one of my best. She was fast, swift, strong. Castiel was my second in command, and for good reason. She thinks almost exclusively in strategy. She’s clever, faithful. She’s entirely in awe of humanity, as God wished.” Anna paused and said wistfully, “And she’s terribly loyal.”
Hannah shot him a strange look but then disappeared with Cas and the nurse behind a curtain. He heard Cas start sobbing again, his inhales sounding like desperate wheezes and stuttered hiccups. He started blubbering something about a heart attack again, claiming to feel dizzy and numbness. The nurse hissed something to Hannah about keeping him still if he was going to get an examination.
“You gonna bring that over here so I can use the soap, or you just gonna stand there and look pretty?”
She ignored him, licking the candy again. “My vessel does seem to enjoy it, though. She’s telling me she used to eat these—”
The blue in Castiel’s eyes was so brilliant and bright, despite his pupils blown out and dilated, that the ocean in Paradise over his shoulder looked pale in comparison. “I don’t want to be on the floor anymore, to start.”
He needed to find out where they were, and then he needed to find a phone. Thankfully, the office lacked a lot of things—personality, feeling, any kind of personal pictures on the desks—but it did not lack phones.
“‘Fraid not,” her caller sighed. “He’s got twelve groupies and a few prostitutes who he hangs out with fairly regularly.”
At the back of the group, Dean and Castiel grinned at each other. With his arms slung around her shoulders, Dean leaned down and whispered into her hair, “These peasants, so sloppy, huh?”
But Charlie reeled back, alarmed by his sass, and that put Sam on high alert. His forehead immediately tightened as he frowned and looked between the girls. “What are you up to?
Dean scowled and darted his eyes back to his three new acquaintances. “...but I suppose we have some time to help out new friends.”
Granted, he was still grossed out by imagining his brother having sex with anyone, so he skimmed those bits like he’d done in the Supernatural books. Dean was
“Hey,” Dean greeted, looking beautiful as always, even with red cheeks and pale skin and the dull shine of freshly wiped tears on his cheeks. “We’re all thinkin’ of hitting up that diner Missouri was talking about. You want to?”
She’d already crushed the blood packet in her hand by the time she opened her fingers and pretended to cut herself. It bled over her palm, her blade hovering half-an-inch above her actual skin.
But until then, he taught his dad a couple things. Shyly, at first. John Winchester knew his way around a car; he’d taught Dean everything he knew. Or rather, most of the things he knew. After a while of sun-burning their arms and cheeks under the hot afternoon sun, Dean had given John enough pointers that he figured they’d probably be able to build the car from the ground up if they wanted to.
“TELL ME!” Dean commanded, the light emanating from his palm growing. He was scared shitless, but Alastair looked a hundred times more frightened.
“Unlock that door for me. I’m gonna shoot, and while I’m shooting, you start swiping that card. Alfie, you start punching that number. We’re going to release people from the brig.”
Dean made a noise of frustration and climbed down from his bed. He grabbed his little bag of toiletries and disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. Castiel heard the tap running and the aggressive brushing of teeth. After a few minutes, Dean reamerged, but Castiel kept his eyes averted. He merely listened to Dean climb up onto his bunk and open up the dog-eared book he had under his pillow.
“If no one speaks up, there will be consequences!” Dumah barked, turning in her spot, her teeth gritted.
“This writer,” Charlie continued quickly, talking fast—too fast—and trying hard not to inform Castiel that Metatron did, in fact, smell like llamas. “This writer is for our play, the one we can pitch to the investor—”
Then he exhaled slowly, shifting in his sleep. His face was still smooth, still serene. In sleep, Cas seemed to feel no pain.
Ruby was backing away towards the door, but she still snapped out, “Don’t tell them, Sam. They’ll hurt Anna, they’ll—”
And when he pulled out, slowly, it was his undoing how his deep pink cock shined wetly with spit. Dean’s spit. Castiel even pulled all the way out just to watch the string of saliva connect him to the Greek god that,  for some reason, was worshiping him instead.
It took the entirety of his comedown for Dean to notice that Cas had begun to cry. He pulled away just enough to give Cas a little shake. His stomach dropped.
“Fuck,” Dean rasped hoarsely, too bewitched to question or care, and then he was coming, too. The orgasm hit him like a train, like a brick to the head. Like the heat that’d been ruminating inside him exploded.
To his surprise, he wasn’t greeted with a grunting, sweaty version of himself plowing into some man or woman (that looked suspiciously like Dean or Becky… Gross). The site that popped up was bright white with a burgundy banner and text. No cartoon or 3D aliens getting destroyed by a giant dick in the sidebar adverts. Actually, there was no advertising at all.
Charlie seemed to relax, though her bright eyes looked hurt. “He was drunk, he walked out in front of a car. They both did, he and Amelia. Got killed right on the street in front of Heaven,” Charlie rasped, pointing out towards the front gate, nearby where Cas was playing with Claire. “Cas was broken about it. She didn’t work for a month after, never left her rooms. She and I had been friends up until then, but she pulled away from everyone after. Naomi went to see her a few times, but something tells me those weren’t good visits of support.”
“I can,” she said proudly. “I discovered that staying alive as a mortal is much harder than I imagined, but I found out most things on my own, eventually.”
That hadn’t been so bad. It was humiliating and nothing felt right about it, but they hadn’t hurt him. For some reason, he thought they would try to hurt him.
Castiel’s heart sunk at the very bleak prospect of being stuck in the facility without Dean. Then his heart did a strange little backflip as Castiel realised Dean just admitted to being gay.
Anna caught his eye and they both chuckled. She nodded, raising her bottle of beer to her lips. “Very tacky.”
As he tucked himself away, buttoning his trousers and working on the buttons of his white shirt, Castiel busied herself in the mirror, scrubbing at her ruined lipstick and tried to fix her wavy mane of hair.
She leaned in a bit, her sweet breath on his lips. He ran his tongue over them, suddenly parched. Silkily, eyes searching his face, she whispered, “You only regret that you can’t afford me, Winchester. If you had enough coin to spend a night with me, you wouldn’t think twice about labelling me as nothing but a whore. You would be just as selfish as they are. You’re no better than those men who you are so quick to judge.”
Dean. He doesn’t know it’s you, but he knows I’m being distracted. I-I slipped up, I let my guard down. With Balthazar, with you. I should never have gone out with you. I should’ve have kissed you in front of your friends. Being with you, even in this arrangement we have, is toxic.”
Feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation, Dean typed in his code and raised the phone to his face.
“You haven’t really eaten, Cas,” Dean scolded. “And don’t think I don’t notice you tossing and turning, and walking around the bunker at butt crack o’clock—” Castiel paused to survey Dean, eyes narrowing, head tilting in confusion. “You can talk to me if you’re not doin’ all right, you know that, right? I mean,” Dean blinked awkwardly and gestured vaguely at nothing. “I’m no Sam with the feelings and the Oprah moments, but I got ears.”
“Yes,” Castiel whispered. He wasn’t sure why she was lowering the volume, but she glanced around him for a moment as if checking for someone. Then, her eyes, big and blue and clear, focused on him. She nodded again. “Yes, I do. I...am not a hammer, Dean. I have many thoughts that are my own, many I wouldn’t share with my fellow angels.” She licked her lips, pausing. He recognized that look; he’d seen it in the mirror; guilt, enough to take pause.
Cas reached over with one leg and kicked Dean hard in the ankle. He hissed and mouthed a few choice curse words at her. In response, Cas whispered, “Don’t goad her! She has our daughter, you idiot.”
Energized by a rumbling, dark energy and overcome with lust, Dean growled and pulled Cas close for only a moment before he pushed up using his thighs and twisted them both around, falling forward until Cas’ back hit the floor and Dean was on top of him, kneeled between Cas’ legs. He yanked his own shirt up over his head and threw it aside, wanting, yearning, desiring skin-to-skin contact.
Fifteen minutes later, the drink Dean was tipping back towards his lip was intersected by a flat hand that pushed the glass back down towards the bar.
Dean shrugged like he didn’t care, and he said gruffly, “Don’t apologize. Shots well aimed and well deserved, I guess.”
“This changes nothing between us,” Cas interrupted with a quiet, hoarse murmur, holding Dean closer.
...A casual secret fling? A fling with someone so embarrassing he didn’t want to tell anyone? It hadn’t gone unnoticed by Castiel that other than their hand-holding over the counter, Dean hadn’t displayed much affection in his store. No kiss, or even a hug. No greetings like they had at Castiel’s apartment door or in Sioux City or on a date in the parts of town where they didn’t know anyone.
The song finished, and the angels stayed posted at the end of the stage as the crowd cheered. The diamond necklace around Castiel’s neck shimmered almost excessively in the spotlight as her chest heaved. Castiel looked sultry, her eyes dark and hooded as she watched the crowd, but Dean’s stomach dropped as he realised she looked angry, her eyes glancing in his direction quickly.
“You could hear what it was saying?” Dean asked, perplexed, his eyes wide. “All I heard was this awful ringing. I thought my ear drums were gonna burst.”
As soon as it came out of his mouth, Dean realised what he’d implied and regretted it, glancing at her and expecting a glare, or for her to fly off in anger. But Cas was staring at him in curiosity, her eyes sweeping his face.
“Five minute walk,” Castiel said, swallowing his nerves before they leeched any more confidence from him. “It’s a five minute walk.”
“Ah, shit,” Sam murmured, dragging his finger wearily over the trackpad of his laptop, scowling as he swirled the final dregs of his green smoothie in his cup. “What porn has Becky sent me this time? Like how many porn-look-alikes do I freakin’ have…”
“He's more of the hookup type. Love ‘em and leave ‘em kinda deal.” Sam waved a hand in the air, then reached forward for his glass. “It's probably not a good idea for him to date anyone right now, anyway. He can’t even make good decisions about his hookups, much less someone to date.”
“Yeah, but I had plans tonight,” Dean grumbled, wiping his hands on his pants. “I wasn’t counting on encountering an impromptu case during our vacation.”
His hand was halfway to his face when a warm breeze blew his fringe up a bit, tickling his forehead. The sound of wings flapping caused Dean to turn around.
“Shut up, Ruby!” Dean growled. “You’re the one who came to us about Anna, and you’re the one whose been sharing secrets, and
Castiel’s mouth dropped open and she stared at him through wide eyes. “You were going to bring your brother?”
With that, Dean stood back up and turned around, nerves replacing the hangover in his limbs, making him feel alert, anxious… He had no idea what to expect, so he started walking.
gay like a unicorn but was very nice, if a bit quiet, and unfairly handsome. He had a strong brow with equally strong shoulders and was about an entire foot taller than almost everyone, giving him a gangly look that probably couldn’t be avoided. He and Dean had the same type of style; plaid button downs and jeans, though Castiel noticed that Sam wore a very old-looking black t-shirt under his mustard-coloured plaid that said WINCHESTER VINYL & ROCK EST. 1974 around a line-art record with a pentagram inside of it, surrounded by the rays of a sun.
Dean couldn’t move. The temperature dropped in his dreams, the sky darkened, and he felt sick to his stomach.
It was the thick, sludgy grass and sticky mud that he found the most offensive after a lifetime of heavy heat, dry ash, and the sharp lick of flames. He wasn’t used to cold. Cold was unwelcome, disturbing. With a strangled scream, a panicked bout of gasping for air, and a heart that rammed into his chest so fast he thought he was going to explode, Dean pulled himself out of his grave. He sputtered against the rain as it beat down on his head, and clawed at the slick mud around him.
The five men dispersed, moving to a station. He stayed close to his roommate who looked more and more furious as the seconds passed.
The physician whose name she couldn’t remember was fiddling with something, and then moved close, holding something under her nose. The sharp scent of ammonia sudden burned her nostrils and hit the back of her throat like tiny knives.
Inside him, he felt Dean’s cock pulse like a heartbeat, then Dean’s muscles tightened under his face. The thrusts turned shallow and Dean’s fingernails dug into Castiel’s back.
“Are you really going to argue with me about geology?” Cas asked, raising one brow. “After I saved you from eventually being gutted by Zchitri?”
“Maybe I won’t pick you up at the airport,” Dean murmured. “Maybe I’ll use next weekend to catch up on sleep. Go into full Yogi bear hibernation.”
She did a double take down onto the page and frowned. Then her intense gaze disappeared and she scowled. “‘
Dean nudged him with his elbow and Castiel forced himself to look up from his food, feeling humiliated.
Convincing enough. Sam had located a few missing persons reports submitted by Jimmy at the end of last year. The story certainly checked out.
Jimmy stared at her from the top of the steps. “Jamie… Castiel wasn’t ever anything to be frightened of. I don’t want you to think I was, like, scarred. The memory of Cas was always a comfort to me.”
Sam didn’t speak to Dean the entire way back to their motel. The emotions stirring inside him were confusing at best. He was worried, mostly, because what the hell was he supposed to do now? Dean was
“And I told you,” Dean whispered at the tail end of a giggle, “I told you they hadn’t gotten to you yet. You still got it, sunshine.”
In a gesture of affection, in a gesture that made Castiel’s heart skip a beat, Dean reached forward and ruffled his hair. It could’ve been interpreted as a brotherly gesture, but the way Dean’s hand dragged down the side of his head, and the way his thumb brushed the shell of his ear, was definitely not brotherly.
“Pretty sweet setup, if you ask me.” Dean chuckled, pulling the whiskey glass against his chest as he noticed Jack hop up a bit and press a paw to his knee. After doing a double take at the puppy, his lip twitching, Dean explained, “I own a music store on the other side of town and got a staff of like three, so, uh, I’m kinda there most of the time.”
When they entered the church, Dean paused, taken aback for a second. Bodies—demons—lined the walls along the floor. For a second, it looked like Hell. Dean was starkly reminded of running through caverns with Cas, their hands intertwined, her free hand held out in front of her as she smote the writhing, shrieking souls trying to stop them from escaping. They’d convulsed as their eyes were burnt out, and they’d collapse to the floor in a heap.
But Cas was lost in a time since passed, her eyes distant, her voice melancholy. “He died and Amelia died. Dean, she died minutes after I told her about the affair. She was my best friend.”
The muscle in Dean’s jaw was clenching and unclenching when Castiel looked over, and the butt-end of his hotdog was between his fingers now, uneaten.
Ash interrupted, smiling, his eyes beady. “She’s got her undies in a twist because she and Cas used to be besties.”
Dean frowned, but his stomach knew something he didn’t because it seemed to drop a few inches and squeeze. “Why would it follow my scent to
Dean gritted his teeth together and growled, “I turned Alastair down for thirty years, I said no, I told him I’d rather continue to have acid poured down my throat for thousands of years than to accept the offer he gave me every day.”
“You sure?” Sam asked, his lips turning down in one corner, and his heavy brow knitting together. “Like, I know she said that, but you know Cas is stubborn and you know she doesn’t like to ask for help, or seem like a burden to anyone.”
“Why wasn’t it one of them? Why throw away an ally when you had one?” Anna asked. Her tone sour, she added, “Although, clearly loyalty isn’t your strong suit.”
There was a moment of silence, and then Castiel spoke, not realising how hurt he was until he uttered the words, “And yet you held me down.”
Charlie swept down upon Dean, her wooly shawl fluttering behind her. With magenta and yellow paint smudged on her chin, she looked a bit deranged. Kevin crossed his arms and walked over to Dean, eyebrows raised.
She could hear his frown through the phone. “Because, Jamie,” he started, sounding like he was on the verge of a scolding, “it’s your niece’s eleventh birthday party tomorrow and she’s turning into pre-teen, like, so much faster than I’d anticipated. She was so cute last year, and now she’s all moody and keeps calling her mom a bitch.”
“Exactly,” she replied quickly, fingers tightening around her glass. A breeze blew some hair in her face.
His stomach turned as he heard a couple of the men slip in Garth’s blood, and for the first time since he got there, he felt like crying too.
With sharp shake of his head, Dean walked past Cas and back to the Impala, wondering what the fuck kind of Heaven this was when, in the end, he got all his lost family and friends back but lost the one friend he’d always yearned for.
to be stolen,” Castiel snarled, throwing the box in her hand aside, abandoning the drawer she’d been rifling through. She turned on Balthazar, her hair swinging around her shoulder, wild and frizzing.
The natural flush in Cas’ high cheekbones deepened as she grew more irritated. “I have an appointment with my doctor, and then I’m going to visit a friend—”
Understanding the feeling of longing and heartache fuelling irrational behaviour and destructive, piss-poor decision-making, Dean nodded. He understood.
The demon and her lackey’s filed into the bedroom, and the twins backed up against the broken bed frame.
The angels exchanged looks and then they laughed. Zachariah simperd and gestured out into the hallway towards the chapel. “After everything, after how far we’ve all come, you’re going to let it all go for one being? Six million lives, gone and destroyed because you’re too weak to say goodbye to one person. She chose this, Dean. She sacrificed herself and now she’s going to die for nothing because you’re not
Her meaning was expressly clear; no extra-curricular orgasms were to be had. Regardless to the fact that they were
“I will handle the demons,” Castiel rumbled, deep and monotone, his voice nothing like Jimmy’s. With a blink, Cas was gone, leaving Dean and Jamie alone in the room with a dead demon and Jimmy’s blood slicking the hardwood.
Heaven was closed. He was as good as trapped. Even in their own universe, it had been a challenge to break into Heaven when the gates kept moving locations. To break in when the gates were closed all together…
After watching his roommate put his feet on the markers and seeing his worker kneel down to clasp them closed, Castiel felt a jolt of panic in his stomach and he turned to his assigned worker.
“Stupid girl,” Naomi sneered, “the Duke came to see me almost as soon as your brainless boy toy broke into the tower and struck him. Zachariah knows about you and Jimmy’s bastard child, and he knows about your vile fling with that writer.”
With a small sob and a growl, Cas felt lost, searching Balthazar’s face. “Let me go, Balthazar. I don’t want to be here anymore. I choose Dean, I don’t choose Heaven anymore. I-I don’t care what happens here anymore. I’ve given my life to this place, I’ve given too much. I haven’t ever known anything else. Let me
this town will be a mercy,” Uriel explained, his tone decidedly more gentle when he was addressing Sam than when he was addressing Dean. His eyes softened as he slowly paced back towards them, his hand reaching out for Sam’s sleeve. “If Lucifer rises, six billion people will burn. With my methods, these thousand-or-so civilians will hardly feel a thing. I take their souls to Heaven myself.”
“Yeah, well…” Dean trailed off, dropping his gaze to somewhere on Castiel’s chest, eyeing his t-shirt (which was still on—Castiel made a mental note to take it off ASAP). “Dunno. We don’t
Although he wondered why the angels didn’t immediately know where Anna was, Dean blinked and stepped towards Cas. “You’re gonna kill this girl because she eavesdropped on some angel radio bullshit?”
The guards shifted on their feet and the nurse’s cool facade broke for a moment, sympathy, or maybe pity, crossing her features.
Despite not knowing what exactly happened between them other than a few squarely-landed punches, Pamela and Bobby exchanged looks and knew for a fact that Dean was lying.
The man behind her caught her as she turned into his arms, covering her face. Anna burst into tears, never having seen something so violent in her life. “What the h-hell is going on?” she sobbed into the man’s shirt, her fingers curling into leather.
“Yes,” she breathed, nodding slowly. “Before Claire’s birthday party last year, Castiel had come to me. I’d...thought it was a dream, but then you told me all about them. Remember? Twizzlers and—”
“You know you want to,” repeated at least a dozen other demons that suddenly appeared around Dean, standing tall, their eyes black, their wrists cut and bleeding heavily all over the floor. Their voices, dull and insync, all whispered, “Drink.”
“WELCOME TO CLUB HEAVEN, MY PARTY PEOPLE! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT FOR FUNKY FRIDAY NIGHT, LIVE TO AIR FROM KANSAS 139.2. TWO-DOLLAR SHOTS FROM ELEVEN TO ONE. GET ‘EM WHILE YOU CAN, AND IN THE MEANTIME, DROP IT LIKE IT’S HOT!”
Again, Castiel wasn’t sure how to tell Dean he didn’t need too much prep; he fucked himself on a dildo that was attached to his headboard every morning before work. Being filled wasn’t something he needed to get ready for, he was always ready to go. It was his natural state of being. It was just how it was when he clocked in too much overtime, and was forever single and horny.
“I serve Heaven,” Sam droned, tearing his eyes from Castiel to pinpoint at Dean. The hazel orbs flashed and darkened, his brows knitting together. “I’ll kill you before you get to take that from me,
“I don't care if I have to go through Castiel to cut you up and shove every inch of your flesh and every fibre of your flayed soul back into the pit,” Uriel said from behind Dean. He leaned in and added, “Because I will. And I will enjoy it. You may have been raised for a reason, but I don’t see it, boy.”
Castiel blinked, wondering if he’d been too distracted by the song to realise Dean had pulled something from his pocket. Distracted and flustered, Castiel blurted out, “Oh, yes. Of course—”
Dean begged internally, wanting an apology. When he didn’t get it, he lifted his hand and dragged the back of his wrist to rub under his eyes, where a tear tickled his skin in the cleft of his under-eye circles.
In his chest, he recalled the echoes of feeling, of memories where they held hands and ran towards freedom, where he’d burned his handprint into her shoulder and whispered ‘I love you’ to her before they burst from Hell. For the first time, he didn’t care about those memories.
Dean and Sam exchanged scowls when the man rolled his eyes and gestured vaguely out at his pharmacy. “Yes, of course, I do. Aisle four.” He jutted his pointy chin at Sam and asked, “Got caught in the crossfire between the militia and the angels?”
Castiel peered down at himself...herself...themselves? They peered back up and shook their three heads.
He’d spent too long thinking he’d be Hell’s bitch, that he’d go Darkside, that he had no escape or redemption from being Azazel’s psychic kid. To say he wasn’t somewhat relieved by being important to Heaven would be a lie. He just wished that Dean supported him more, and that Dean would stop being so damn bitter about it.
even know about love? You’re full of hatred, jealousy. Uriel told me you egged on the Duke, he told me he overheard you at rehearsal the other day. If anything bad happens to Dean, it’ll be on you, Meg."
Chuck looked up at him, in between searching his couch cushions for a light. His face looked peeved. “Duh, Dean. It was kinda a dead give away when I had some angel named Zachariah come to me and tell me I’m protected by archangels. I thought he was full of shit, but then someone tried to jump me a few months back. It was dark out, and there wasn’t anyone around. I-I had a new iPod—”
Meg closed her mouth with a click of her teeth and she nodded curtly, turning her eyes down and getting to work, snapping on gloves and grabbing her lube bottle with a snap.
Castiel watched the gears turn in Naomi’s head and he knew the idea of spending time one-on-one with Hannah, who was bright and bubbly and talked her way through any silence, was her idea of a nightmare. But...he also knew Naomi had been a young pre-teen when the Spice Girls had been at the peak of their fame—she’d be hard-pressed to turn down the offer.
Dean tilted the pan, sliding eggs and bacon onto a plate already stocked-full of eggs and bacon. “Give the girl a break. From what I understand, she probably hasn’t slept in a decent bed, well, ever.”
“Which one?” Sam asked, his eyes darting around to far dark stairwell leading up to the fly tower, and the other leading to the balcony where the actors smoked out back.
Castiel made a hoarse noise of disbelief, while Hannah tilted her head at his side, still holding tightly to his arm.
Dean stood in the doorway, arms crossed against his chest, and he took a second to gloat in the fact that they could just...never let her in again. He’d be Ruby-free for as long as they wanted to stay in the room. Hell, he could order a pizza and some beers and pull up a chair to the doorway just to watch her wait and wait and—
Jamie got ready to head to the office, shrugging her shoulders at her waves that weren’t Victoria’s Secret so much anymore as they were the secret Victoria never told anyone because the secret was limp and frizzy. Jamie combed through her hair with her fingers and refreshed her makeup into something more office-appropriate. The last thing she wanted Steve to pick up on was that she liked to wear dark lipstick in her spare time. He’d be calling her Little Miss Gothy for a year; she could feel it.
To his credit, Cas blushed, dragging his teeth over his bottom lip and looking anywhere but Dean. “She got ‘a pass’.”
“I’m scared we’ll go out together and I’ll turn into that guy,” Dean admitted tightly. “Or I’ll panic and disappear like I did with Lee. A-And mostly I’m scared of being gay in front of Sam or Charlie.”
‘D’. Not ‘love, D’. Just ‘D’, like even the scratchy capital letters were trying to hold him at an arms’ length.
And when he felt the beginning twinge of an orgasm build at the base of his cock, pulling his balls up close to his body, Castiel reached down and began jerking his fist over the tip of his cock, sliding foreskin over the top few inches, pulling and tugging at his orgasm, guiding it up, up, up—
Ezekiel lowered her rifle, Ishim clicked the safety off his gun, and Castiel grabbed Gadreel by the arm, wrenching him to his feet.
Again, Dean felt like clapping his hand to his forehead, but Castiel didn’t look offended. Rather, she actually smiled, and walked towards him, one brow raised. “Of all the things I’ve been tied up with before, a bell is certainly new.”
“Oh, nothing like that,” Dean said, reaching up to rub at his neck. He look a second to inhale deeply, buy himself some time, and enjoyed the waft of her flowery perfume. “I just, uh… So how long have you been working here?”
With anger, he stepped back into the room and pointed at her with a trembling finger. “I will never want you, Naomi. I will
“I’m sorry,” Dean immediately said, flashing her a smile and holding out a placating hand. “You’re just, uh, very light of foot. I didn’t expect you to be there. Someone should tie a bell on you.”
Dean nodded. With a clench of his jaw, he said roughly, “You will be. Sooner rather than later if I got anything to do with it, kid.”
And while Castiel tried to fight the negative feelings by trying to pull up those memories of vulnerability between him and Dean, Naomi’s voice rang clear in his mind; perhaps Dean had only been vulnerable to gain sympathy, to guarantee sexual favours.
Her brother turned around and picked up two flimsy paper plates that said “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” all across the bottom. “Yeah. Move fast. Grab what you’re gonna eat and let’s go before Lia tries to get me to do something else. I think channel 47 is playing Cops as we speak.”
Castiel dragged the brush over her lash line, pulling the black line up artfully into a wing. She dipped the brush in again.
“Just gimme four hours to sleep,” Dean said, his toothbrush hovering by his mouth. “Then we get right on the case, bright and early.”
Hannah grimaced and swept around the arm of the couch, plopping down beside Jack, who was warming Castiel’s feet. “I can stay, Cuz. Really, if you’d rather we spent more time together—”
Rolling his eyes, Dean tugged his t-shirt—a worn black WINCHESTER VINYL & ROCK EST. 1974 shirt, just like the one Sam’d worn yesterday—over his head, seemingly unashamed about baring his back and chest to the people around them. His skin—shoulders, back, tummy—were
Dean cleared his throat and stepped into the doorway, making it look like he’d just arrived. Balthazar slowed as he approached him, and with a little jolt of amusement, he noticed Balthazar’s eyes scan the features of his face.
Feeling shaken with anger, Dean pointed at Hannah with a finger uncurled from around the neck of his whiskey bottle. “Don’t fall for it, Sam. These angels? They have no feelings. She’ll leave you when she realizes you have nothing to offer her but yourself.”
The angels exploded into ethereal radiant white mist and Sam, Dean, and Jack craned their necks to watch them shoot up, up, up...and away.
“Dean, I...I’m so sorry. God, I’m so sorry. We didn’t know. We didn’t know you’d come back. If-If we knew, we wouldn’t have let you crawl out on your own. We woulda been there so you weren’t alone. God, Dean, I—”
“Love?” Zachariah sneered. “Between an angel and a mere human? Does that make sense? Should she not want power? Something Zyon and Heaven could give her—”
The little girl ran off and jumped into the pool with a splash, dousing her mom who was running around making sure everyone had sunscreen on.
Castiel turned her face slowly, eyes sweeping over Anna’s determined face. “Then,” Castiel said firmly, “we stop Uriel and Zachariah. We put an end to the apocalypse.”
Sam growled and kicked a half-finished woven pod, accidentally skidding in the goo. “I don’t get it. I was convinced I’d gotten the right cave. I saw--”
Dean paused in his exit, frowning for a second, then he turned back and leaned against the railing again, understanding that she hadn’t dismissed him yet. “Nah, acting isn’t really my thing.”
Dean leaned against the wall and lowered his pants. He shut his eyes and used his imagination instead, imagining Cassie, his ex. Or better yet, Cassie and Xander, the waiter from the local diner who served Dean and Benny breakfast every Sunday morning. He imagined Cassie and Xander together, around him, touching and licking. He recalled Brad’s big brown eyes, and gnawed on his lips, imaging Brad looking up at him, his lips rosy around his c—
Once in the shower, after the cleaning and the eyebrow wiggle, Dean said he was going to turn Castiel around, push him up against the tile, his cock in his hand. He was going to kiss down his back and drag his nails over his skin. Dean would find a home somewhere on the tile, his knees breaking streams of bubbles and soap as they curled over the tile, towards the drain. His tongue would bury itself in Cas’ ass, spreading him open, fucking him mercilessly with that eager, hot tongue—
Night had fallen and still, Castiel had not come to get him. Eleven hours had passed, and still, all Sam, Bobby, Chuck, and Pamela could do was sit on their hands and twiddle their thumbs.
They threw him into solitary afterwards, satisfied that he wasn’t part of some organization they were tracking.
his skin, but on the inside, he felt cold. Goosebumps raised like he was standing outside. He could not get warm, no matter how much he tried. He couldn’t shake the chill in his bones. The tips of his fingers almost felt numb, and inside his stomach felt like it was full of ice.
Chuck, standing in the middle of his living room in a dirty bathrobe—open, with old, worn-looking Looney Tunes boxers showing. He raised his hands and clapped them to his face. “Oh God,” he wheezed. “You’re Sam and Dean.”
The relief that was coursing through Castiel was almost as pleasurable as the light tremors passing through him, and the slow release of relaxation through his muscles as his post-orgasm haze settled.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “You’re probably right. Y’always are. So what, she’s gonna show up at the Roadhouse?”
The silence that followed was heavy, and Sam looked distracted, staring at a knob on the dashboard with intent.
“They might come back,” Sam said, his voice tight. Dean noticed he looked pale and the line between his eyes was deep. Dean wagered he probably didn’t look so hot himself.
There was an uncomfortable look that passed over Castiel’s face, her hand immediately moving down to rub at her wrist. Dean felt a pang of guilt for making her feel bad, it hadn’t been the intention. Rather, quite the opposite.
Sam shrugged, setting his boots neatly beside his bed before he began pulling off his jacket. His eyes flickered quickly up to Dean in an expression Dean knew all too well as guilt. “She didn’t have anyone else to go to, Dean. I was mad at first, like you are now. Not only was she a demon, but I was also angry because you’d died and I wrongfully blamed her. The thing is; what else could she have done? She didn’t
By the time dinner rolled around, after a two hour nap, Castiel felt significantly better. With more food in his stomach and the rest, he could actually walk somewhat comfortably and didn’t feel ruined from the drug hangover anymore.
Despite his heartache, Dean felt warm at that and couldn’t help but quirk his lip at his brother. He slid his hands into his pockets and turned away, walking through the crowd to the door.
“Hi, brother,” Dean whispered to Benny, sniffing sharply, trying to preserve some of his dignity as he blubbered onto Sam’s shoulder. “How—”
“Guys?” Sam called out, but was met with nothing. He scowled, then sighed and walked over to Dean’s bedroom door.
Opening her eyes, Cas blinked, and raised her gaze from her daughter. Her face, which had softened as she spoke, hardened again. “Never mind. I don’t want to burden you with my struggles. They’re not your concern. Give my daughter to me.”
Not for the first time, Dean felt like reminding Sam he shouldn’t roll his eyes so much, or they’d stay like that.
Dean jerked his head in a little nod and he averted his eyes to the floor. “Right. So we didn’t have a moment or connection or whatever, and you have no interest in letting me get to know you, and you definitely wouldn’t wonder what it would’ve been like to make love to me then?”
in the way Castiel thought it might be. As a matter of fact, Castiel wasn’t relieved the way he thought he might be if it had turned out Dean’s aversion to going out in public together turned out to really
The only things that were missing were one of the weapon bags that had hung empty on a hook by the door, a singular gun and ammo from the weapons locker and, as they would discover later that evening, Sam’s hairbrush, taken from his bag under the sink.
“Well, yeah.” He cleared his throat, his chin dipping down to his chest as he busied himself emptying a handful of angel blades from his bang. “Good for you.”
“Well,” Chuck replied slowly, his eyes darting around the cabin nervously, “I kinda knew Lilith would be in town. I-I saw us here, in the car, and I saw Dean with her later.”
Zachariah rolled his eyes and rose to his feet, propping on hand on his hip while the other waved at Castiel loosely. “My goodness does he ever talk, talk, talk, talk,
His voice had crackled and grown weak near the end. God, his heart couldn’t take any more bullshit, it couldn’t handle anymore ache and death and trauma.
Dean crawled under a table, noticing Alfie do the same. They headed towards the door, one forgotten hallway out, away from the riot. The two men reached the end of the tables and slid out, ducking a spray of gunfire from a guard. After they passed, their boots clomping down on spinach that’d been tossed onto the floor, Dean and Alfie got up.
Cas shrugged, looking weirdly small without his coat, and looking weirdly more exhausted than usual, especially with his top button undone and his tie hanging loosely off his neck. He dragged his hand across the table in short sweeps, creating a tiny pile of bread crumbs and salt grains.
“I love you,” Dean said softly, his eyes stinging. He pleaded with Cas not to walk away. “I’m in love with you.”
“You know?” Amelia asked, her voice cracking, her brows fighting to raise and furrow at the same time. “You don’t know shit, Jamie, but let me fill you in, all right? You left, and dumped all of your responsibilities on Jimmy’s shoulders, all the while leaving us with no explanation as to where you’d gone and when you’d come back, and we didn’t know if you were okay?” Amelia’s voice was starting to raise, too, her cheeks burning red. Amelia blinked and a tear slipped down the side of her nose, but she swiped a hand across it quickly, rubbing it against her hip. “You left Jimmy entirely broken, Jamie! He exhausted himself looking for you, and went on a leave at work because half the time he was too depressed to get out of bed. A-And Claire’s grades dropped, and we almost lost the house when Jimmy’s job threatened to let him go. I mean, how could you just do that? I...I was there for you when Brad died. I helped you with the funeral and dealing with his estate and I mean, at least Jimmy got a phone call, but me and Claire…?”
But Meg was busy staring hungrily after Jimmy. “Maybe I could convince him to put on a trench coat and growl at me just the way I like it, you know?” She paused, then winked. “
Castiel choked on nothing and thumped himself on the chest, aghast. “I-I… I have fun, Uriel! And…I can’t. My cousin Hannah is in town. I’m supposed to show her around the city and—”
“You are not going to be sick,” Castiel pointed out, a tiny smile tugging at the corner of her lips. She was sitting on the edge of the bed in front of Dean, her palms intact now, her coat and face devoid of blood. She was okay too.
Castiel felt his lips twist into a smile; the company logo reminded him of the tattoo inked into Dean’s skin above his heart.
“Nerds,” Dean muttered, and he smiled when Anna grinned at him. When he winked at her, she seemed to relax back against the pillows Pam had set up for her.
Bobby looked grumpy, as usual. "Decided to come home drunk off his gourd last night, broke my ma's ol' lamp and wore his shoes to bed. He's stayed home tonight to think about what he's done..."
Feeling the blood drain from his face, Castiel dropped back down quickly. His chest immediately felt tight and his throat closed up; this was it, Dean was going to break up with him. God, he felt so stupid. He’d let Naomi get into his head, he’d opened his stupid mouth to bring up his doubts to Dean. Now he was being dumped in his own home, sitting on the couch like a statue, mortified about the heartache about to hit him like a freight train. Maybe he should’ve just accepted their secret fling and shut up about it.
“Yeah, I know,” Sam said hushedly, pursing his lips and flipping a page from one of the library books he had stacked neatly by the salt and pepper shaker. “I know. I can see them. But
“Hey, Cas, you got your ears on?” Dean murmured, walking the perimeter of Bobby’s property, eyeing the treeline. He stared out into the field across the street from Bobby’s place, and then as he walked, gazed out at the tiny lights flickering from the house over on the next property. After a few minutes of prayer, he’d done a lap, and when he got to the edge of the property where he’d emerged from his grave, he saw someone was walking alongside him.
Sam shook his head, lowering his gaze, disappointment etched into every feature of his face. Beside him, Cas’ stoic stare flickered to Jamie. “Jamie,” the angel rasped, low voice rumbling in his throat. “Thank you for everything. I must take my leave. Rest assured, I will ensure this home is better protected. It will be better hidden, and you, your brother’s wife, and niece will be taken care of. In the interest of shielding their minds, their memories of this night will be removed.”
With a sharp breath, he turned around in his chair and saw Castiel leaning back against Bobby’s heavy mahogany desk, the most regal piece of furniture in the house. She had her ankles crossed and her hands in her trench coat pockets. She said nothing, but stared at him, a thoughtful, near-blank expression on her face.
Sam | 12:40am (October 21st, 2019): Cas? I didn’t even know you even remembered his name after the festival. You’re at Cas’s place? It’s like 1 in the morning
“C’mere,” Dean murmured, reaching a hand out. Castiel took it and was pulled up into a seated position, ass on the edge of the car hood, legs spread. He was held close, Dean’s arm coming up around his shoulders.
“He’s not Lucifer still, obviously,” Dean said through his teeth, wanting to warn them before Sam ended up with a few dozen bullets in his chest from jumpy graceless angels. “Sam went to Hell to save Earth, locked himself in the cage with Michael in Hell, and uh, then Cas got him out. That’s, uh, how our plots diverge—other than the fact that we’re not dead.”
Castiel stared down at Samandriel, his eyes wide and stunned. Suddenly uncaring about fighting, Castiel shoved past Uriel and dropped to his knees in the mud, pulling Andi out of it with a squelch. The boy’s entire front was thick with filth and blood; Castiel’s hand swiped over his young face, pulling muck away with his palm, his fingers brushing blood away from his lips. Dean heard Castiel release a rattling breath as the boys lifeless blue eyes stared up at him.
“How?” Dean hissed. “I can’t go around stabbing people with copper blades just ‘cause they gave me a fork and a snack! We gotta be sure.” Dean leaned out of the booth as well, watching the waitress-slash-monster tap her lips with a pen and then tap on the screen in front of her. “How do I tell if she’s a siren other than that?”
His long, slender finger uncurled from a white-knuckled fist. “And I had to watch those moments over and over again, Dean Winchester. I could’ve been plagued with anything else, anything of actual monumental value to Heaven or Earth, but instead
Suddenly Dean felt choked up, inexplicably so. He didn’t know where his response had come from, but it had been automatic, bubbling out of his mouth like vomit. And despite how angry he was at the angels, and how bitterly he spoke towards Castiel, and how jealous he was of Sam for being the pure one, he felt like he spoke the truth.
? Not only were you lying about your identity and barely qualified, but the nanny before you had a past undeserving of being around children. She had her own taken away. Jackie Dearest was a fan of the drink, and more...sensory injectables. She forgot to feed her own children for an entire week, left them with their seven year old cousin to care for them.”
“That nephil is all you have left of him, of Dean Winchester. If you comply with our wishes for you, if you voluntarily bear the children of Heaven. If you comply and give your womb to us willingly...then,” Naomi said, gesturing to the glass, to the beautiful small girl who had Dean’s chin and sandy hair, “she is yours entirely to raise as you please. You will face no interference from us, Castiel. We will never bother you except for implantation and births. Otherwise, you and your babe will never be left wanting for anything. We can give you a Heaven; we have millions. You choose yours and be left alone.”
. I-I think it’s why I don’t remember much. The only times I really remember are when I was drinking blood, when I felt powerful and myself. When I was hopped up on that shit, I felt unstoppable.”
“We’ll explain later, once the day shift is in bed and settled,” Hannah whispered to the girl, giving her shoulder a comforting pat.
“No! It’s simply too much,” she breathed, her chest heaving as her fingers tangled in her waves. “It makes me feel dirty, naughty, corrupt.”
“She,” Castiel repeated in a rumble, licking his lips and holding the neck of his beer in his fist against his stomach. “Yes, of course. My apologies.”
For those who skipped the non-con & birth scene, here are the relevant plot points: Castiel gives birth to a child which Naomi takes away, Gadreel is present and seems hesitant to participate, an angel Sophia is assigned by Uriel as the aggressor, and Castiel hears Dean praying to him, saying he loves him and is coming to rescue him which brings him comfort.
John’s bottom lip was bleeding a bit, his teeth gnawing a crack in his dry lips. He said nothing, though, staring through his sunglasses down to the ground, where the sun and their treading footprints had worn the grass a bit at the end of the drive where they’d parked the car.
“Back the fuck up,” Dean snapped, a jolt of something in his gut making him feel ansty. “Give him room.”
He would be lying if he didn’t feel a little thrill of excitement when her mouth dropped open and she choked out in disbelief.
Neither did Gadreel, who smirked down at his captives. Beside Hannah, Castiel was fuming, his nostrils flaring as he breathed hard, his face tinged with red against the cold, his fury etched into the lines of his face. In the rope binding his hands behind his back, his wrists twisted.
They shared an easy laugh when Dean pressed his fingers into his eyes and groaned. “Ugh, no offence, dude, but you’re a nerd.”
“Good,” John murmured, his breath fogging up the mask. Despite struggling to breathe properly—a side effect of his medication—John’s lips twitched into a smile and he recalled, “Went to a few of those with your mom back in the day. Even took you to one when you were ‘bout the size of a football. She s-strapped you to her chest, put some earmuffs on you and went to watch Led Zeppelin anyway.”
be about him. Rather, Castiel’s stomach twisted into knots, because he hadn’t meant to force this from Dean. He hadn’t meant to force him to bare all, or make him feel like he had to confess deep secrets. He hadn’t meant to strip away his defences. He’d always known, deep down, that Dean had troubles with his sexuality.
Jimmy’s gaze dropped to the ground, the lines around his eyes deepening as he winced, and behind him, Amelia’s eyes flashed. She stepped out onto the porch and took Claire by the hand, tugging her back.
“It doesn’t matter,” Castiel said, finally with a firm commanding undertone to it. With a little push, she was no longer leaning against the table. Instead, her pointed black high heels clicked sharply over the floor as she crossed the room, walking towards him slowly. “It doesn’t matter because you
She was a liar. A terrible, terrible liar. Castiel could sing all she wanted, try to dissuade all she wanted, but—
“Right, yeah. Sorry, I’ll—” was all he managed to say, turning towards the door, but then there were three sharp raps on it from the other side.
What he didn’t expect was for Dean to start laughing. Dean grinned at him in the semi-darkness, his face lined harshly by the orange light, but the twinkle in his eye made him look younger. “Cas,” Dean chuckled, “were you scared I’d be mad about this?”
Castiel turned her head a bit, peering at him over her shoulder before she returned her gaze to the view.
“I love you,” Cas said plainly, nodding matter of factly. “And I forgive you. I’d like to attempt a relationship again, and I’d like you to be around Leia as she grows up.”
Castiel’s eyes remained open, staring at Zachariah’s face as he relaxed and kissed her back. She held the kiss for only a few moments before pulling away, flashing her teeth in a crooked little side-smile. “Don’t think about it for too long,” she whispered. “I would so hate to wait to see you again.”
Dean felt himself become precariously on edge as nothing about Cas moved. She continued to stare into the light, the only indication that she wasn’t stone was the tiny movement of her mouth pursing together.
“So, like—” Dean mimed driving, his fists turning in front of him on an invisible wheel, “—you let her drive. And what do
“I couldn’t have you,” Cas replied immediately, stepping back again, his eyes searching the space around Dean’s feet, eyes searching frantically for some kind of logic to make this make sense. “I told you I knew I couldn’t have the one thing I wanted and you said
“Is this a fight? Are y’all in a fight?” Ash asked, eyes lighting up. “Shit’s been good up here, but it’s been like thirteen years since I seen a good bar fight.”
“I can’t imagine your confusion when I made those advances,” she said bitterly, eyes narrowing out at the cityscape.
“Charlie, hi,” Castiel said, stepping away from her group of angels and smiling softly, her lip twitching up in the corner. Charlie felt a happy flutter in her stomach as Cas surveyed her fondly, like when they had been best friends. “I have to go on in a minute, but I remember you wanted to speak to me about something. What did you want to talk about?”
Once the door shut behind her, the milkers all began taking down the prisoners. Dean looked over at Cas, hoping to catch his eye and exude some support, but Cas was staring after Naomi, his face set defiantly, but his eyes shining.
. He could’ve closed his eyes, and went to sleep, inhaling the soft, warm puff of mint air from Dean. It would’ve been almost romantic.
Dean paused in his visual puruse of the room and smirked at Castiel, a brow raised. “Yeah, I gathered that he’s a dog.”
A jab out of left field, but again, deserved. Dean crossed his arms over his heavy chest, and stared out the window, watching the river as they drove along side it, back to their motel. "You don’t think I know that? You don’t think I want to bring her back with us?”
Dean blinked, his hands bunched in his coat falling in front of him, the material feeling heavy in his curled fingers. “Cas, I just—”
His meals came in liquid form and were disgusting. It occurred to him after he choked down his third smoothie, which tasted disgustingly like roast beef, that they were blending the meals everyone else enjoyed in solid form and feeding it to him.
When Dean kept going, bringing her closer to another orgasm, she wrapped her hands under her knees, while he pushed at the back of her legs with his hands to guide the strong, tanned thighs up against her chest. Then he slid his hands under her ass and pulled her pussy up to his mouth, diving in with vigor, his chin and throat shining and wet.
“He’s not a pair of biceps on legs, Naomi,” Castiel insisted, feeling a jolt of indignation in his chest. “He’s a person, and he’s kind and funny—”
Dean, who was fucking starved for demon blood, having gone weeks without a hit, gritted his teeth and looked over at Sam. “No, I’m not
“Fine,” Castiel replied quickly, before gesturing into the kitchen with a thumb over his shoulder. “Would you like a drink? S-Something to eat?”
Dean’s head snapped up—he and Cas locked eyes as Sam’s voice travelled through the door, far away, like he’d just walked into the apartment.
Castiel nodded. “Well, Sam. Thank you. I’ve recovered quickly from the blood loss. I’m back to 1.2 gallons, just as before.”
“I think I know what’s up with Cas,” Sam said, and Dean noted that Sam had that nerdy look in his eye that he got when ‘the lore made sense.’
“MICHAEL!” Chuck shrieked, shooting up from his restless slumber, his face white as paper but shiny like wax. His eyes were bigger than usual and his lips trembled. “I’m gonna be sick,” he whimpered a moment later, blinking hard as he looked around the room, terrified. “Oh, fucking fuck-fuck, I’m going to be so fucking sick.”
“I only need a minute,” Charlie said, holding her hands up in a placating manner. “Okay, so hear me out. I have a writer here—a writer better than Metatron,” she added.
Sam left the shower feeling nauseous. He towel dried his hair and changed into fresh clothing before entering the motel room again. He heard the creaking of the kitchenette chairs and followed the noise, hoping to start a conversation with Dean. He was going to approach him calmly, he wouldn’t attack him, he would use ‘I’ statements and ask questions, he wouldn’t be accusing, he just wanted to underst—
Looking over his shoulder, he immediately saw Raphael step out from around the corner, looking after them. His dark eyes seemed to narrow in on him and Dean understood Castiel’s terror. In Raphael’s hand shone a shiny, brand new looking handgun. He smirked and raised it right at Dean—
The club looked sufficiently smokey and the angels were all dressed up, so Charlie and Ash were free to mingle. They sat near the bar, where Dean and Sam joined. Even Hannah joined them, counting cash that she tugged from her bodice.
Immediately, Dean was overtaken again by the feeling of familiarity; they’d done this before and now he remembered. The kiss they’d had in Hell, while extraordinary in itself, was shadowed by the vividness of this one. Cas kissing Dean against the hotel wall felt more real. Cas smelt like cinnamon and lemons, not hell smoke, and her hair was clean and soft. They weren’t covered in sweat, and dirt, and grime, or blood. There was a desperation, but not because they didn't think they weren’t gonna make it.
"Yes." Alastair nodded. "Thanks to you, my love, it is Apocalypse Now, and if all goes to plan, if we fed you good in Hell, and I taught you right: Satan is gonna wear you to his Inaugural Ball. Consider it your reward for jump-starting the end of days."
Everyone filed into a strange, cold looking mess hall with hard steel tables that had matching hard steel benches. Food was placed out already, plates piled high with richly coloured vegetables, nuts, and chicken.
“What?” he snapped. “Shouldn’t you be dancing or exposing your breasts to some adulterous drunk in a side room?”
Sam spun around and threw them a bitch face summoned from the depths of Hell. He grasped the door handle and spat, “Tag your fucking porn!
Gravel crunched under Castiel’s feet as she shuffled them. “I believe they thought they were helping; detoxifying, in some way. They were, of course, very wrong. Well-intentioned, but wrong.”
With eyes closed, he felt the thump and thrum up his legs and in his shoulders, and let his head curl forward a bit. Unsure of how much time passed, he let Sia’s ‘
“Move!” Balthazar barked, pushing his way through stagehands and angels. They parted for him, revealing Castiel sitting on an apple box backstage, her face slack and hands twitching in her lap. Hannah sat at her side, an arm around her, and Meg kneeling in front of her. Michael and Gadreel stood on either side of their star angel like two bodyguards, frowning with concern, eyes sweeping her face.
Dean didn’t require more encouragement. He closed the gap between them, although as Cas began tilting her head to open more of her cut throat to him, Dean caught her face and turned it towards him. With her face in his palms, Dean kissed her, relief flooding his system that she wasn’t angry with him. After her cold tone taken with him in the streets of Pontiac, Illinois, after the situation with Jamie, he thought she’d turned her back on him. He was just so happy to have her here.
was all that Cas managed, and Dean saw it in his face as Cas’ swollen, slick lips parted and his eyes pinched at the corners. The electric blue of his eyes were all-encompassing between wet, dark brown lashes, before in a blink, Dean watched Cas’ irises dilated completely like a lens contracting and opening, the blue nothing but a silver lining around blackness and then—
Beside him, he heard the material of Sam’s jacket shuffle; a shrug. “I wondered, but I wasn’t going to press it until—”
Cas pleaded roughly, “Let me just hold her one last time. L-Let me feed her, just...one last time. You understand.” Cas nodded towards Barbara and added softly, “From one mother to another, I
Sam was buying time, Dean knew. He saw the panicked look in his eye. Behind him, Pam struggled to shield Anna as the red-head side-stepped her and began to shuffle through her wall of bodyguards.
“Everyone is so—” Dean turned, following a gorgeous red-headed angel who walked past him so fluidly she looked like she was floating, her lavender satin dress fluttering behind her like it was a thin curtain in a summer breeze. “—pretty.”
Behind her, another angel, a blonde with floppy bangs and gangly limbs glanced between them and warned, “Sophia, aim to kill. This one is the mate, he’ll be aggressive—”
“Yeah, true, I guess,” he conceded. “Though I really think you need to get rid of that coat, James. It doesn’t fit you…” he paused, looking over at her, his eyes soft, though his tone was teasing. “And you know how much Brad hated it when you stole his clothing.”
The plan backfired; Castiel had turned around to avoid giving away the hardness in his jeans, but now he was all but rubbing his ass on the front of this guy’s jeans. His hands felt like they buzzed with worry that rushed back, and humiliation, ready for the guy to rush off or even worse,
With a grin, Sam shrugged and pointed out, “I’m getting flashbacks to like six months ago when you had crazy morning sickness. Are you sure you’re not pregnant?”
“Smashing,” Balthazar said, running his fingers through her hair and fixing one of her dress straps that had slipped off her shoulder. “Told him all about the meeting. He’ll be there after your set, I’ll make sure of it!”
He felt Castiel’s eyes close against his cheek as Cas leaned away from the table, pressing deeper into Dean’s palms, his mouth sliding open and kissing Dean deeper.
Her hand loosened on his face, and all Castiel could do was hold back a shudder as her cold hands dragged down his neck and the front of his black t-shirt before it settled on his stomach under his navel, pressing into the skin there.
“Car seat? Did...you two plan this? Am I being punked?” Dean asked, looking between Cas and Sam, who’d stood up and was walking around the car, disappearing to open the trunk.
Dean’s face fell for a moment, then he pressed a tight smile onto his lips, hands resuming their massage after pausing briefly.
“It takes place…in Kansas,” Dean went on, racking his brain for details. He began pacing around as ideas came to him. “It begins with two brothers who hunt monsters and demons.”
“‘Couldn’t do it, couldn’t deal, couldn’t answer questions. I just shut down, went into my room, locked the door, and got under the covers. And then I missed my pills the last few days and that was making me feel sick and—and—”
Dean felt like throwing up. The paper shook in his hand. “It’s a letter from CPS, warning Stevie Leitsac of a visit to her residence.” Dean turned over the paper and read from the scratchy lettering etched in pen on the back side. “
Dean went on, gesturing to the side of the street. “It’s pretty dead on Tuesdays, so this is a good time. You want to? Oh, you can park there. Right out front, it’s where I usually park the Impala.”
“Why do angels come down here? What do they want?” Dean felt like he didn’t want to know the answer, judging by the disgusted look on Castiel.
Cas had heard Dean’s prayers in Heaven. He’d heard Dean whisper that he loved him, and he knew, from the very existence of the tiny girl in Cas’ arms, that he loved him back.
The tops of Cas’ cheeks were red and his nostrils flared; a dead giveaway that he was pissed. “I let myself spend the first night of my humanity there, because I wanted to experience just for a moment what it would feel like to live in Dean Winchester’s home, like I was welcome, like I was
“I really like you, too,” Castiel replied easily, pleasantly surprised at the lack of absolute terror in his chest. He might’ve never admitted it if Dean hadn’t first, but now that he felt he had license to do so and knew the sentiment was returned, telling Dean how he felt was easy.
Dean buried his face into Cas’ neck, and inhaled his human scent, familiar despite his mortality. Still lightening, still rain, still vaguely like the scent of the Impala. Cas turned his face and rested his cheek on the curve of Dean’s neck.
“No kidding,” Dean said, leaning over to set his beer down. As he got up, a silly, fluttering feeling emerged in his chest and he grinned, sliding sideways until he was shoulder-to-shoulder with Cas, who glanced over at him inquisitively. “We just had sex,” Dean chuckled. “I just had sex with an angel.”
“Why would God care about me?” Sam exhaled carefully through his nose and ignored the strange, unwelcome stinging in his eyes that accompanied the little sense of importance in his chest, as he dared to hope that something wasn’t wrong with him, for once.
And now, Dean had left him alone to be Heaven’s living, warm incubator that pushed out wriggling fledglings from between its legs, and only existed solely to be refilled.
Under the blanket, Castiel let himself sniff wetly and allowed a tear to fall. It dribbled down the side of his face as the truth crashed down on him in the light of the crushing realization; Dean had used him. Dean got what he wanted by giving Castiel the illusion of being wanted and relied on. God, he felt so stupid. He should’ve just listened to Naomi from the start.
Sam got to his feet and made his way over to the prophet, same as Bobby and Pam, who crowded him with faces twisted into curiosity.
To her credit, Castiel did look ashamed. She licked her lips and diverted her eyes for a moment, stepping back. “My apologies.”
Sam smacked him in the arm, while Bobby glared, but Dean cracked a grin. Pamela looked over her shoulder and winked at the boys.
The silence was thick and tension-filled, but it wasn’t bad. As a matter of fact, the surprised, highly aroused, almost weak expression on Dean’s face was endlessly
“You…” Castiel paused, licking his lips. God, they were so dry, why were they so dry. “...want me to…”
Castiel walked past her as she leaned down to fiddle with the wheel of her cart that was stuck. He was fairly good about just stepping into the restraints now, not bothering to fight it. Resistance only caused trouble and—
Dean leaned forward, and with hands on her face, cupping her jaw, fingertips brushing over the soft curls that tumbled past her cheekbones, he kissed her lips. In that moment, he breathed her in, trading moans and hitched breaths, and swallowed her confession, drinking it in and holding it dearly, protecting her truth with everything that he had.
“Eh,” Dean waved his hand before shoving it into his pocket nervously. “Technically, Sam and I don’t either, so that just makes you one of us.”
Meg raised a brow coolly, and watched Kevin zoom by, changing his wardrobe frantically. Once he was gone and no one of import was listening, Meg turned her face up to the Duke and asked smoothly, “Shouldn’t we call the police too? Have ol’ Dean-o arrested for trespassing?”
Dean dumped his books unceremoniously on top of a rickety self and clapped his hands together with glee, hopping out onto the vast balcony which may have arguably been bigger than his entire apartment.
Castiel even didn’t know where to start; Naomi hitting on Sam, Sam being drunk enough to even talk to Naomi for longer than a minute, or the fact that
As Castiel followed, as he wiped the back of his hand across his dirty, ash-smudged face, his blue eyes glanced at Dean sharply and he nodded as if to say,
The pain of suppressing emotions was almost worse. It was sharp, it stung, and it was accompanied by guilt, and shame, and humiliation. The barricade would always fall and the emotions that rushed in came with a vengeance, angry that they’d been held back. They festered and built like a ball of angry and aggressive energy that both heightened his anxiety and zapped him of all emotional stamina until he felt sick, tired, numb.
Castiel looked around with amusement, gesturing vaguely at the trees—such a loose, human gesture. “We’re in Paradise, Dean. We have nothing but time.”
“Well—” Cas’ shoulders tensed and Dean saw his hands roll in his pockets. “It was nothing but terror and pain. I relived every regret I’ve ever had, watched my mistakes play out before my eyes like a television show. Nothing I could do stopped it. I screamed, closed my eyes, plugged my ears… Nothing worked. The Shadow found pleasure in its attempts to drive me mad.”
coming back, and I can’t fu-fucking—” A sharp breath. “I can’t do it. Maybe Sam needs to l-look at his face because he hardly fucking saw it the last few years, but I was
Between the beds, Sam made a choking noise and fell onto his hip, flailing out to catch himself on the bed. He was blinking hard, reaching up with a bloodied hand to rub at his eyes.
From the very back seat, Andi said “Uuuhhh…” eloquently, and Dean saw Hester exchange looks with Rachel, their brows raised.
Charlie mumbled to herself, then nodded and admitted, “Well, yes. I’m part-time prop master…for when they, y’know, actually need props. I mostly design the costumes for the dancers and build sets for when they need sets. Hence, why I have random wooden boards I can use to patch up your floor.”
Hannah stood at Sam’s door, looking up at him under heavy false lashes, her skin glittering, her lips right red. She was in full costume under a long navy coat. Her bustle was large under the coat, her corset covered in rhinestones glittering through the opening. She had feathers in her hair, and her sculpted curls formed flowers near her face.
“What can I help you with?” he asked, finally, after tearing himself out of his vacuum of paused time and space where Castiel was a galaxy in his dumb room. Ugh, he really was a pathetic writer.
“Cassie,” Balthazar warned, tilting his head, “I know you better than most. I know you’re lying. You are a good actress, but the puzzle piece doesn’t fit. You never go missing like this, Cas, not unless… Not unless you’re...”
Castiel turned her drink in her hand. Then, simply, “Yes. He’ll pay for the renovations, he’ll invest in the play, and in exchange, he gets a cut of our ticket sales, door fee, and he gets me.”
In the frantic, excited energy of the theatre, Dean sat quietly in his seat, staring up at the ceiling. It was brown paneling, and elegant. It was certainly nothing compared to the mural of heaven and hell painted on the domed ceiling of Heaven.
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam breathed as he opened his eyes, looking up and around at everyone. He let Cas help him to his feet, and when everyone made sure to have a weapon in their hands, Dean turned to his brother.
When Sam spotted Dean, he smiled big and waved. “Hey!” Then the smile faltered, and his brows knitted together. “Uh… you okay?”
“Call Sam,” Cas uttered shakily, nodding under Dean’s palms. “Whatever you’re planning, I’m in. We have to get out of here.”
The hands under the running water lifted for a second to pump more soap into their palms. Cas returned his hands under the stream.
He drove the rest of the way home with his dad, who drummed his fingers on the door frame to AC/DC and sang under his breath. And for the remainder of the ride, Dean didn’t let on that his stomach was in knots.
“Nothing like him,” she murmured, pulling away and surveying him coldly. For a long series of moments, no one spoke, but then Naomi explained, “We felt your arrival in this world the moment it happened. There hasn’t been an omega angel in over a decade. Your mere existence rippled through our grace, through the fibre of our very makeup. I imagine even the graceless angels felt you.”
Dean’s stomach was a bit turned though, and he felt hot indignation on her part. “Does she continue to threaten you with lashings?”
“Bless you,” Dean said, the corner of his lip twitching up. He knew what a concierge was, but it was more fun to make Sam laugh.
Having Hannah around was a blessing and a curse; she was a distraction from Castiel’s overthinking about why Dean wasn’t texting him anymore, but also, she was a distraction from Castiel’s overthinking about why Dean wasn’t texting him anymore.
He blinked, looking up, his vision clearing to see he was tied to a tall stone spike that stood tall from the floor of this cavern.
Dean stared at Castiel for a long time. Almost too long, and Castiel was tempted to tell him to “knock it off”, as Dean had so many times done to him. But then, after a long few moments, Dean’s eyes flashed a bit and he raised the hose.
And Castiel. He’d thought about her daily for a year now, his heart aching from the angel-shaped hole in it. The guilt, the shame for what he did to her, it ate at him. But what was worse was that he felt longing, a desperate yearning for her that he’d eventually learned to shove down, so deep in him that if he was drunk enough, he could almost pretend never existed.
Standing up straight, Castiel's eyes went wide and she stared at everyone over her shoulder. Her voice high and tight, she added, "I, uh, love all of you."
Unluckily for Cas, she’d formed a pretty profound bond with a Winchester, and Winchesters weren’t that good at taking orders.
“Move out?” Dean asked, his mouth dropping open, his brows knitting together. “Where would you live? Cas, you
“FUCK!” Dean heard Sam exclaim behind him, and suddenly all of Cas’ weight was on Dean as Sam went barrelling into their backs, stumbling.
Fuck, he wished he could’ve held Cas, too. But the thoughts of guilt and rumination about why he was undeserving haunted Dean all the way back to the motel. He crossed the parking lot, drowning in his own mind, and walked right past the Impala towards the room.
The three of them slid out onto the top floor landing, their shoes squeaking on the hardwood. Panting, they all huddled close.
“Just don’t tell Sam I’m brushing your hair,” Dean muttered in addition, pressing his hand to her head as he pulled the brush through a long section of hair. “He’d never let me live it down.”
Past the sound of Pamela crying out in a language he didn’t understand, and Bobby snarling insults at ghosts across the salt line, Dean made it up the stairs to the second floor and into his room before all the doors to his closet and bedroom slammed closed around him. Mary stood in the center of his room, her hands at her sides, her blood dripping audibly onto the worn, woven carpet.
The dog barked and hopped off the bed, running into the living room like he hadn’t just been given a direct request to act casual. Running back towards the door, trying to avoid Jack who suddenly had the zoomies—his nails
“—Right here,” she said through her teeth, her eyes intense, unblinking as she watched his face. Then those eyes slid closed when Dean nodded and pushed forward, sliding into her, into her swollen, slick pussy. He groaned when she whimpered, and he pressed her back against the door, his head falling to her shoulder and his hand reaching to his side, sliding under her thigh to hold her up.
“Shut UP!” Dean yelled, writhing up under Sam in attempts to buck him off, but Sam was too large now, too strong. All he did was buckle a bit and force Dean’s hands together over his head so he could hit him in the face again.
A nurse peeked his head around the corner of a foggy glass partition between the waiting room and a room that contained several curtained beds. Dean was all too familiar with one of those beds, where he’d spent his day making himself puke...and kinda genuinely sick, as the salt water he’d swallowed made him toss his cookies more than a couple times all over the sheets.
“I just need…” Dean trailed off for a moment, raising a hand to rub at his mouth. Once it dropped to his side and rolled into a fist, Dean said thinly, the dips under his eyes suddenly looking strained, “I just haven’t been able to stop thinking about what you brought up at the store.”
“So you remember who you are?” Castiel asked, raising an eyebrow. “We thought you’d expelled all memories of your family from your mind after you fell.”
“Yes,” was all Castiel could breathe, though he was easily drowned out by Reznor growling into the mic. He swallowed the urge to vomit and returned his gaze to the stage, trying to focus on the act, on remembering the words to ‘
In a moment of absolute fear, Uriel swung back his arm and drove his angel blade towards Dean, aiming for his head. “You! This is it! You’ve gone too—”
With her stomach feeling as if it was sinking inside her, settling somewhere behind her navel, she walked forward, ascending the stone steps of the church. She didn’t wish to have to wield her weapons either, but had a feeling, if what Anna suspected was true, that her relationship with Uriel and Zachariah was going to take a violent turn.
“I don’t want to be sent away,” Castiel whispered, his breath steaming up the window. He rested his forehead against his arm. “What would I do without you? Who would take care of your dad?”
“Make your semen deposit promptly,” the nurse said after he stepped into the room. “Knock when you’re done, we’ll be waiting outside.”
They’d ended up sleeping over after helping Uriel indoors and lying him onto his side in bed, too nervous to leave him alone until morning. Hannah fell asleep in the bed beside him a few feet away, while Castiel slept on the floor, his head propped up with a pillow he’d found on the couch in the living room. He’d stared at the ceiling fan of Uriel’s bedroom, wondering why the hell Dean hadn’t texted. He wondered if he was another bad decision made by Dean Winchester. Or worse, maybe he was a
Sufficiently encouraged, Dean chuckled and used one hand to lift her thigh up a bit more, keeping her thin, satin dress bunched in his hand and off to the side. He pulled back just for a moment to look at her wet, glistening pussy before he dove in again.
Excuses, Dean thought. He needed to come up with an excuse, but instead, he licked his lips despite his mouth feeling dry, and Dean replied honestly, “I brought stuff.”
Castiel turned to face Anna, who stood under a lit gazebo, her hands in the pockets of a dark coat, and her eyes shadowed under furrowed brows. The hard bottoms of her boots clicked over the stone steps and onto the cement sidewalk blocks lining the rail and overlooking the water. She was drawing closer.
When it was time to leave, as the crowd thinned and Kevin began whining about his feet hurting, the friends left the bar. Dean and Sam drunkenly hugged Bobby, who rolled his eyes at their sloppy embrace, but still returned the gesture whole-heartedly, offering them more peanuts and beer if they came to visit during the day where a catch-up was realistic.
The sarcasm in her voice was as clear as the diamonds hanging from her ears. Dean’s lips pursed further and he had to focus on not narrowing his eyes more. He was new here, it wouldn’t serve him to make enemies, even if this girl was treating him like a street rat.
“Hey. Psssst,” Dean hissed, his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, shaking him awake. “That’s enough beauty sleep, sunshine. Wake up.”
But Hannah piped up, looking past Dean to Castiel. Worriedly, she said, “I bugged Sam to come back over. Cas, are you all right?”
They crossed the road. Dean still wasn’t sure where they were going, but they’d crossed over to the side of the street that lined the marina. To his surprise, Castiel stopped, leaning on the railing that separated them from the water, and she sighed, resting her elbows on the metal, her fingers linking together.
While everyone around him broke out into murmurs, and even disbelieving barks of laughter, Dean and Alfie stared at Cas in shock. Cas’ face was hard, his eyes flashing.
A group of men walked by, howling with laughter at some joke or another, and Dean let his hand drop, turning back to the railing, licking at his lips and glancing between the group and Castiel’s face. “Yeah. Coupla years, maybe a bit less. You?”
Dean opened the door and stepped away, smirking. “Guess you’re not the only one with secrets. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Hannah followed anyway, linking her arm with her friend. “Let’s get changed, shall we? I’m about fed up with this corset. Maybe you can help me get it off?”
It happened so quickly, even Dean took a second to catch up. The hand Cas wasn’t using to hold Leia close shot out and grabbed the fist Barbara was using to wrap around the handle of her blade. Cas snarled as she yanked Barbara towards her and swung out her leg, clearing the Zchitri’s legs right out from under her. The creature shrieked and fell onto her side--just in range to be kicked in the face.
Ash laughed and winked at Ellen behind the bar, making a drinking gesture with his hand. “Drinky-drink, Ellen?” He then crossed his arms over his chest and grinned at Dean. “News travels lightning fast around here, hombre. Likely, Castiel told one of her friends, and her friends gossiped during the show at some point tonight. Honestly, it was probably Meg that told everyone. That girl relishes in drama.”
“Oh, fuck,” Dean breathed, his lids sliding closed, his brows furrowing deliciously. He licked his bottom lip as he froze, visibly trying to gather himself. In response, Castiel pushed back, taking Dean all the way in until his ass swallowed that cock whole and the tip of Dean’s thick length brushed his prostate, sending warm waves of arousal through his body.
The mark he left behind was red and angry, but he hadn’t broken skin, so to soothe the mark Dean ran the flat of his tongue over it, pleased when Cas’ shuddered under him and breathed out a soft
“Rachel, I slaved for two hours the other day sewing missing rhinestones back onto your corset, you best go take that off before I officially see you leaning against the splinter-ridden bar!” The woman cried out at a tall muscular blonde woman, while she balanced a wiggly little boy on her hip, who was trying to escape back to his mother. “
Dean’s heart nearly came to a stop and he did feel those wretched tears blur his vision for a second. “You were in Heaven?”
While he dissolved into pleased rumbling chuckles and Hannah squealed in gleeful shock, Naomi narrowed her eyes into slits and Castiel made an abrupt cutting motion at his throat at Uriel, trying to convey
On cue, as per their dress rehearsal, from the fly tower, Ash swept a bright light out towards the crowd—effectively blinding them for a moment. While the crowd winched and gasped, the trapdoor under Balthazar’s feet opened, and he dropped down into the bowels of the stage. When the light faded, there was nothing but wooden floor where Balthazar used to stand.
Castiel didn’t glare back. She simply stared at him, her stoic expression unyielding. “Yes. My superiors pass on the word of God, and I am now passing it on to you.”
“You’re right.” With a sigh, Dean set down his fork, giving up, and wiped at his mouth with his napkin, jerking a finger at the stack of books beside Sam. “What else do you got? I’ll help research, but give me something written by someone who is less of a dickbag.”
Under Dean’s hands, Sam’s rib cage expanded and contracted in a few shuddering breaths before Sam breathed with a tremor, “Hi.”
And the performers—the dancers, the glorified ladies of the night—Heaven’s ‘angels’ as Balthazar and his staff called them—were magnificent. A horrible little voice in his head that sounded like his father thought Balthazar might’ve been losing money because his roster of women and men were undesirable. But no one could ever say that about a single one of the angels. They stuck out from the crowd, each stunning and painted. They sparkled in one way or another, whether they had lipstick made of glitter or diamonds glued to their foreheads and faces in intricate patterns. Some wore dresses and costumes of rhinestones and satin, while others seemed to have cheekbones and collar bones made of glitter that sparkled in the wild sweeping lights of blue and white.
Pam leaned down close to Bobby’s face and murmured, “I could hear his stomach growling from the moment he climbed outta that grave. And I’ll start making you sandwiches when you start fixin’ my damn bike. The exhaust bolts rattled off like three weeks ago and I’m itching for a ride.”
“So when I say I don’t understand why Celeste would ever turn her back on Heaven, I say it from experience,” Castiel clipped. “Love only begs for pain and betrayal. No one comes out alive. It never ends well.”
“I sure tried. Whatever information I could get without outing myself, yes. I had to hold a lot back until the last minute. Naomi releases specific information to each of us in her inner circle, so she can keep us accountable if anything leaks. I had to make sure I wasn’t the only person to know stuff before I leaked it. It’s harder said than done—” she let them through another door, “—‘cause she’s on top of it most of the time. I couldn’t even tell Sam where you were until a few days ago.”
“We don’t have an hour!” Dean barked, tugging the plaid button up he’d thrown over the back of his couch earlier. “Damn it, Cas. Pick something closer next time.”
He strode back into the bedroom, his insides feeling like he was vibrating, lube in his hand, and a tent in his boxers. He dropped down behind Cas again, dragging his eyes up over the round curve of Cas’ ass through the black boxer-briefs, and admiring the dimples in his lower back and the angular, smooth curve of his spine, and—
“I’m warning you!” Dean growled, growing desperate as Cas wheezed, her legs swinging through the air fruitlessly. Her hair was flapping at her back as she tilted her head back, struggling for air.
He came to a hard stop when Castiel stared at him coolly and stepped back the second he drew too close. His hand, which had been outstretched for her, dropped to his side.
“...I mean, I see how she’d fall for you,” Ash continued on, sucking on the cigarette and blowing it out in a stream through his nose. “You got that rugged, handsome artist thing going—”
The second he was sure they’d be occupied for more than a few minutes, Dean jumped out of his chair and stood in front of the nurse’s office, his hand hovering over the doorknob. He shut his eyes, desperately hoped the door was unlocked, and then he wrapped his fingers around it. Silently as he could, he turned the knob painstakingly slowly, his heart pounding.
A flicker of anger fizzled in Dean’s chest. “God, huh? Did he tell you anything else? Like why he fucked off and left the world to shit—”
Gadreel was staring at Castiel’s knees pressed together, his cheeks red. Under his sharp jaw, Castiel saw his throat bobbing.
“So you’ve come up with a story then?” Sam asked, tucking a piece of long brown hair behind his ear as he peered down at a blasphemous exchange of bodily fluids happening just in the alley between their apartments.
Her gasps settled down and her breathing became more shallow. She let her hand drop away from his head and her thigh slid off his shoulder. Dean dragged his tongue one last time through her swollen, slick pussy before he sat back on his heels and let her dress tumble down her legs, the fabric swishing by her feet.
The slit in her dress made it easy for her to swing her knee up into his gut and Castiel snarled as she tore her hands away the second he let her go. Stumbling back, she panted, “Duke, please, Heaven is my home, a-and my daughter, Claire—”
“I love...our...time together,” the Duke breathed distractedly, and Dean seriously doubted that the man even knew what he was saying, with his hand on Castiel’s tit and her hand working magic over his cock.
“Hold on to my shoulders,” Dean ordered hoarsely, before kissing Cas so fiercely he thought they’d both drown.
“Thank you so much,” Castiel interrupted, pursing his lips in an apologetic smile as he passed over his menu as well, hoping the girl would infer ‘
Jamie launched herself at Roger, but he was bigger than her, and stronger. The demon rounded on her and grabbed Jamie by the hair, forcing her to her knees. She swung back with the fake iron, but alas—it was fake, and it did nothing but thump him on the arm and make the demon laugh.
“Get help!” Dean yelled, his face growing increasingly hot and his eyes stinging. In his arms, Cas buckled, her hand coming up to grip at Dean’s shirt. Hot blood dripped onto Dean’s pants, spreading over his thigh.
Dean sighed happily against her lips when her tongue slipped against his, slippery and warm, breaching his lips and sweeping into his mouth. Her lips were sticky, probably from that glossy makeup, and her eye-makeup was a bit smudged, but she looked beautiful. She smelt sharp and Dean realised she smelled of cologne.
“I guess the rumors are true,” Dean said, sounding deceptively calm, his voice tinged with amusement. “Look at those eyes and that full head of hair; that baby is definitely yours.”
“I pray,” Sam admitted, his judgy brow joined by his less-judgy brow. “I mean, not all the time. But sometimes.”
“I imagine it means you’re just human,” Castiel replied, sorta-maybe rubbing his cheek into Dean’s hair. It could use a wash, but it smelled like books and old wood. He probably smelled like the music store, Castiel reckoned, inhaling again.
Dean pause to take another drink, hoping to drown himself in booze before he could spill anymore of his darkest secret. But instead, his head simply spun, and his state of drunkenness escalated quickly. He wept a bit into his hand, trying to stay quiet. But Sam’s hand ran from his shoulder blade to his shoulder in calming circles and Dean just lost it.
Cas looked over at him, smiling. “You have your family back. All your friends. Your mother, your father.”
“WHY DIDN’T YOU SAVE US, BOBBY?!” A set of deep, reverberating voice straight from a horror movie roared from the other side of the door. A chorus of terror screamed, “WE’RE ALL DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU!”
However, Dean was sending extremely mixed messages, because his sloppy, slippery kisses trailed over Castiel’s neck and his hand reached down to wrench Cas’ t-shirt up around his collarbone. Dean’s body slithering down until his mouth was latched around a nipple, his tongue twirling around it delightfully, popping off with a gentle nip. His hands, dry and warm, slid over Cas’ side and then up again, dragging his nails softly over the bare skin of his lower abs, leaving soft trails behind over the soft trail of hair. His mouth soon followed, leaving shining patches where he licked and kissed. He was careful not to leave any marks.
“No,” Dean murmured. Desperate to change the subject, Dean nodded his chin at Ash. “So, what, Jack and Cas set Heaven up to be like...just like real life? Y’know, on Earth 1?”
Charlie had been right; how could he have missed Sam and Hannah falling in love all these months? They were radiating joy from their pores like the sun radiated heat in the summer.
They stayed quiet for a long time. Castiel didn’t think he could sleep, but Dean hadn’t said anything in a while. Minutes passed and he couldn’t stop his heart from pounding.
When her eyes opened, they were teary, and her nose and water-lines were red. She sniffed and whispered, “Guess that isn’t going to happen now.”
Chuck, turned out, was the only one to be honest. In a shaky voice, as he backed away from the door, he’d murmured, “They’re scared of you. Of...of the demon blood. It’s like poison and you know that....”
“My orders?” Sam appealed, blinking, staring at Uriel’s face pointedly as if he’d find an answer to his question there. “Why?”
Bobby walked out of his and Pam’s motel bathroom, rubbing a towel over his hair before he swept it around his middle, tucking the corner in by his hips to fasten it snuggly.
Dean clapped his hands together and tried to get back on track, though his brain was frazzled now, between the girl with no attention span wanting to fuck him and his brother and friends sneaking around to eavesdrop from the balcony.
Dean stared at Cas, noticing her eyes lowered and stiff shoulders. She didn’t meet his eye, nor contribute to the conversation any further. He made a note to press her about it later, but turned to Uriel, leaning on the front bench, his elbow by the headrest.
Dean poked himself in the chest. “You told me I do everything for love, and fuck, as usual, you’re freakin’ right, Cas. I did everything,
How could Dean look so casual in such a terrifying situation? One hand in the pocket of loose ripped jeans, his Iron Maiden t-shirt draping off his softly muscled shoulders, and his hair dark with sweat, and yet looking so calm… Castiel was annoyed at the easy, crooked smile on Dean’s face and the loose wave he made with his hand in greeting. Dean was sunburnt over his nose and the tops of his forearms, and his
“Because I need you to know that, um—I need you to know that Heaven would’ve been garbage if you hadn’t been here when I got here. Despite all my friends and family bein’ one call away, and despite a paradise with no supposed hunger, or pain, or suffering, I would’ve been the one to bend those rules, like I always do. I would've been fucking miserable here without you. I would’ve done anything to find a way back, so I could find a way back to you.”
With a roll of his eyes, Sam slid his arm around Hannah’s shoulders and steered her away towards the car. “I think I’ll manage, jerk.”
he groaned internally. He needed to get out of this room before he’d be stuck listening to Castiel bang the Duke on the bed not even a foot away. Who knew how long they’d take? Who knew what kind of freaky stuff this other man would be into? It could get messy and Dean wasn’t about to wait around to get splashed on.
As they watched the band come out and thank everyone for coming, Dean tugged one of the t-shirts off his shoulder and gifted one to Castiel.
Beside him, he felt Sam step up. “Dean’s right,” Sam said in realisation. “You’re going to need that grace to make this right.”
So he shut off his phone. For someone who didn’t think of himself as having many friends, the day Dean left, Castiel’s phone blew up. He got texts from Naomi—paragraphs he didn’t have the energy to read—and texts from Uriel. To Uriel’s credit, he’d tried calling first, and emailing from both his personal and work email, and texting him
“You just gonna believe that?” Dean asked bitterly, wiping at his mouth with his hand, welcoming the bitter taste of cheap beer over his tongue.
Castiel slid her hands off the table and ran a hand over her tie. Her gaze rested on Dean, a strange, wistful look in them.
Charlie tangled her fingers in her hair. “This is a disaster. We were in charge of coming up with a script for Balthazar to present to the investor and now we have
Feeling dizzy, Castiel shut his eyes and ignored the stinging in the corners. He pulled the jacket up closer to his face, over his mouth and nose. The smell of Dean was all that filled him in place of the grace he missed so much.
Castiel rested his hand on the top of the car, relieved for the feeling of something solid to ground him.
It took some clumsy maneuvering because he didn’t know the layout of Dean’s apartment, but eventually, Castiel steered a panicking Dean Winchester into the bathroom.
“He fought back, too, after we took his firstborn from him. It was blasphemous to witness, the complete ungratefulness… But Naomi protected you back then, too. She and others like Ishim and Anael and even Zachariah thought you and the omegas were to be honoured; bearers of the new generation. You know what I think?”
Halfway through a swallow—shit, the smoked salmon caviar whatever-the-fuck was delicious—Dean blinked up at everyone, sliding the fork out of his mouth. “What?”
“Charlie spoke to you about the play?” Castiel asked in surprise, that seductive tone disappearing again, replaced with a flatter expression of shock. “Is that why you were sitting with her at the table? I admit I was confused when I saw you two together earlier.” Castiel's confused expression turned concerned. “Sir, I sincerely hope she wasn’t pestering you about it. She’s just very passionate about—”
Lube, yes. Castiel knew about lube. Upon snooping in Sam’s toiletry bag under the bathroom sink one day, he’d discovered the “personal lubricant” and borrowed it. Of course, he’d never returned it and Sam hadn’t brought it up or tried looking for it…
That was his plan, but when Dean slid under the covers and shifted close to Castiel, he realised there was another way for them to share the heat.
Dean raised his hands and snorted. “Sorry, Sam. But everyone knows you have a thing about sleeping with monsters.”
. Dean pulled his legs towards his body, folding one in front of him. He gripped onto his ankle and sat up, shaking his head. “Ruby-Ruby? Are you… Are you serious? You make me feel like
“This is wrong,” Sam said. “This doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel...holy. Can’t you exercise forgiveness? Isn’t that what angels are supposed to do?”
“I don’t need help,” Cas replied, but her tone carried the same lack of conviction it’d held when she’d initially told him she didn’t need the items.
“Oh, God,” Dean whispered, suddenly completely aware he was in over his head. He was here to pitch a story, not have sex with Castiel. Damn, Charlie! Charlie had assured him he wouldn’t have the opportunity to sleep with Castiel, that the famed Angel of Thursday wouldn’t give him something for free that she charged others for…
Castiel held her gaze, a meaningful look passing between them, before she turned around and continued walking forward. “And,” she went on, “I imagine you’d rather sit with your boyfriend.”
“What’s the big deal, Cas? You fuck the duke, you come home to me, what’s the problem here? One day he’ll be gone, but I’ll still be here. Give me a chance, just let me—”
“Don’t—” Dean was breathing loud, one hand raised sharply from the mattress to hold up. “Don’t talk to me f-for a second.”
Hannah lowered her gun, spinning around to watch the last of the prisoners clear up the stairs. Fifteen feet away from her, guards lay unconscious, haloed in puddles of crimson. She wiped the sweat atop her lip with the back of her hand and scowled at Dean.
Dean nearly tripped and fell onto his face when Castiel laughed suddenly, the sound not only unfamiliar but unbelievably strange as it was bitter.
His heart gave a little twinge when he read that Cas was supposed to be the patron saint of orphans and the vulnerable. He recalled her holding him to her chest—at least in his hallucination, and felt inexplicably warm.
“It’s all right,” Cas said. When Dean looked up, Cas was smirking a bit, and then Dean realised she’d done it all on purpose. She’d been teasing him. She looked back at herself in the mirror, but then added with sincerity, “Human women are extraordinary. More so than I ever knew. The things their bodies can endure are awe-inspiring. Pain, joy. They can carry children and yet fight in battles as equals to all who fight with them. And, despite the social norms in place that are so damaging, they persevere.”
“Okay,” Castiel interrupted, waving Naomi towards the rock fields. “Let’s go before someone gets stabbed in the eye with one of those.”
“That’s my brother,” Dean breathed, his knees weak, his legs stumbling beside Hannah of their own accord. If he’d been in charge of his legs, they’d crumple under him.
“After twenty years together,” Castiel murmured, ignoring Uriel, “knowing he was to eventually play a role in our missions, I thought he should be pure. I had him almost completely weaned off the demon blood. I thought it had worked.”
Thank you so much for coming along on this journey with me. This was my first modern AU and I am eternally grateful to all of you who read it as I wrote it, commented on every chapter, encouraged me, recc'ed the fic, and was just generally very supportive of this story.
Charlie stopped in front of her and scratched the back of her neck. “We work together, Cas. We see each other all the time.”
His knees felt bruised as he pushed them onto the floor, compulsively reacting to the involuntary feeling of pushing. Days ago, he hadn’t even known he’d possessed this anatomy. Now, it was all he could feel. Arms, legs, his face, his skin, it all faded away and there as nothing but burning, pressure, and squeezing between his legs and in his lower back.
Sam blinked in confusion. “Uh, you were just pretty much salivating over that crap and now you’re not hungry?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, nodding and dragging his finger down the side of his glass through the condensation. “Got to be the lucky guinea pig.”
"What the fuck," Dean asked as he poured the holy oil given to him by the angels over the demon's body, making sure to get a good amount in his open abdomen, "are you talking about?"
Dean’s hands—sponge abandoned, sliding down the hood of the car towards the front bumper—slid down Cas’ thighs and hooked under his knees, lifting them up around his waist. He was leaning down, smirking, waiting.
He chuckled at his own joke, and to his surprise, the baby inhaled a series of shuddering breaths, but her eyes opened, the watery blue turning on him, looking curious through her misery, following his lips with her eyes as he spoke.
“You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.” Lilith twisted a strand of hair around her finger, her hooded eyes unblinking as she gazed at him. “Let’s cancel the apocalypse, Winchester. We can both be done with this stupid thing. The Heaven versus Hell crap will disappear, and we can both go back to the old days, when I snacked on a few babies here and there, and you fought ghosties with your brother.”
“It’s government mandated,” she’d explained, guarded on either side by two armed women, their helmets down, their gloved hands holding automatic rifles across their shielded chests. Castiel couldn’t even see their eyes, but he did notice the safety was off and their fingers were poised on the triggers if there was any resistance.
“You traitor, Duma,” Hester piped up, stepping into line with Sam and Castiel, her gun raised, her fury visible over the barrel of the gun. “You turned your back on your own people—”
Cas’ voice was muffled due to half of his face being squished against Dean’s leg. “I’ve never been on a date with a man before.”
Dean sucked in a breath and stopped his incessant tapping. With a sigh, he set the half-empty bottle on the bumper and bit the bullet. “I feel…” God, why was this so hard? “I feel like I’m dreading the moment when you leave for good. I’m feeling like I saved the world, and saved my brother, and I came out alive, and hell, even better than when I entered this mess, but I feel like shit because you’re gonna leave and so what’s the point of having saved the world if you’re not in it?”
As Cas got to his feet and took two steps towards Sam, dropping down beside him, Dean raised his eyebrows at Castiel and nodded.
Somewhere above him, Uriel was no doubt saying something crude, and on either side of his legs that’d stopped fighting, Sophia’s fingers dug into his hips.
The boys all exchanged looks. Kevin narrowed his eyes at her. “Dean came up here not even ten minutes ago and told me he was supposed to meet with Castiel at eleven.”
“How was Destiny’s Child?” Dean asked, pausing his beer bottle’s journey to his lips to chuckle. “Weirdo.”
Before anyone could do a single thing, or come up with a modicum of a plan, or even begin to speak, Cas was running.
On either side of her, her iridescent, translucent wings fluttered and stretched as she yawned. Her green eyes squinted at him as if to say, “I’d still be sleeping if you hadn’t been aggressively cuddling me.”
“You don’t know how to get into Heaven?” Dean asked tightly, anger bubbling up in him and sitting behind his teeth. “How the fuck are you going to help us, then? How the fuck are we supposed to save Cas from—”
Dean was having the same struggle with his overstuffed hotdog, alternating it between his hands. As he licked mustard off the bun, he said with his mouth full, “P.E. Sixth grade. Dodgeball. It was her versus me, last teens standing.”
“I expected you to knock,” Cas grunted, dumping a small pile of folded jeans on the top of the dresser and rummaging in another drawer.
“You’re a pain in my keister, that’s what!” Bobby snapped back, though Dean’s heart warmed. He missed this man.
It only took fifteen minutes of checking out the neighbour’s homes to realise the actual neighbours hadn’t been living in those houses for quite some time. They found sulphur in both homes, and discovered the door to Jimmy’s house entirely open to the street upon their return.
“Tried that already,” Uriel rumbled with a sigh. “All it did was make me sign every email with ‘Breast Regards’ and the hangover sucked. Worst Tuesday ever.”
came from the stereo loud enough to hear but not loud enjoy to piss off Castiel’s neighbours. With the light from the muted TV show flashing to his side, Dean did indeed look pretty, and Castiel was absolutely going to dance with him.
She turned to stare at him, her hands resting down at her sides. “I perceived that I’d upset you with my comments about consent and Avery. I just want to make it clear, Dean; I wanted to have sex with him.”
Bristling somewhat at the idea of Naomi and Dean sitting in the front seat, of having Dean sit beside someone who had indirectly done nothing but add more pain atop his plate already piled too high in shit, Castiel opened his mouth to say something, but Naomi beat him to it.
All hell broke loose as gunfire echoed around the clearing, blades clanged, and fists collided with flesh. Sam, Rachel, and Hester rushed Zachariah, who’d been flipped onto his back by a furious Anael that hadn’t taken kindly to her throat being nicked. Castiel threw Ishim a blade he’d had strapped to his leg just in time for the grey-haired angel to parry with Duma, blocking her strike as she tried to swing her blade down atop his skull.
“You think they serve deep dish pizza in there?” Dean asked, his brows flickering up on his forehead as he leaned over Sam to peer up at the sign.
Everyone was silent. Castiel closed his eyes as the car rumbled under him, Baby coming to life, ready to take them away.
Her unimpressed scowl twitched just a bit. The smile she was trying to hide made Dean throw his head back and laugh.
Cas had looked like this before in Dean’s most private dreams, ruined and broken as he’d fucked Dean. So many times Dean had looked at that face, the same bottom lip red and worried by shining white teeth as they’d had sex in every position his depraved mind could come up with while he slept.
Castiel wasn’t sure what to say again, so he just reached out and took Dean’s pinky finger between his two fingers, and he shook it a bit. The peculiar little touch had Dean blinking and finally turning his gaze to Castiel, his brows doing a little twitch of confusion.
“Whether or not we have an idea, I would still have to do those things, Charlie. It’s part of my job. It’s what I do.”
“You have faith,” Castiel replied. “You listen to Heaven as is expected of you by your lineage and your destiny. You serve Heaven, as I do, and I follow orders without question. I suggest you promise to do the same.”
Bobby nodded, reaching up to smooth back his hair. “Yup. It delivers the venom through suckin’ face, so keep an eye out for that.”
Sam looked to Castiel, his head reeling back a bit, his legs shifting as he turned towards her slightly. In a perplexed tone, he asked, “
He sat down on one of the uncomfortable chairs at a table adjacent to their kitchenette and accepted the bottle Dean put in front of him.
“I can take your coat, Hannah. We’re staying for a bit longer, I think. Um, you want a drink?” Sam said, quickly getting to his feet and rushing to take her coat from her.
“Corsets are tied up, not wound up,” Kevin corrected, hopping out of his seat and sliding his empty glass off the table, headed towards the bar.
But Hannah caught on to the tension between them and a furrow deepened between her eyebrows. “What do you mean ‘his plotline’?”
“No,” Castiel replied quickly, his eyes widening a bit. “N-No, I had a lot of fun. I, um, sincerely had quite a good time. The werewolf wearing sunglasses was quite the highlight.”
The church was a broken, disgusting-ass mess. Inside, through stained glass windows, he saw the flickering of candles. Someone was here already.
“That’s enough smart aleck remarks from you. Startin’ to sound like your brother…” Bobby paused in carting an armful of pots over to the sink. He looked around, his moustache tilting. “Where is the idjit, anyway?”
“One singular moment of funny business and I will slit your throat. I don’t care if your baby gets showered in your blood and your good for nothing sperm donor watches you bleed out. I will end you if you try anything fast. Understood?”
Castiel paced, her hands in her hair. “I just want to rip my clothes off and pleasure myself here in front of you. Just the thought of you inside me drives me mad.”
Dean turned to Cas and gripped his wet face, which was actually sweaty now, from the hyperventilating and fighting tooth-and-nail to get away from Hannah.
With that, Uriel flew away, disappearing into thin air with a small push off his heels and a flicker, like he had dissolved into static.
“I chose nothing,” the cupid whispered, his eyes glittering. “Angels are not meant to choose...but I fear my anger has twisted my powers. My mere presence turned the arrows to poison. I only meant to retrieve the arrows, the humans didn’t deserve them. But when I appeared, the arrows had tainted them. They fell, they died. Their blood, the elixir of life, it thickened with poison.”
With a wicked grin, he curled a hand behind one of her knees and lifted her leg, hooking and resting it on his stocky shoulder.
The last thing Dean wanted to know was that Castiel’s biological baby was cute. He was still working through the fact that his angel, his warrior of God, had fallen from Heaven, suffered homelessness, was kicked out from her family’s home, and then gotten pregnant like some runaway teen. Castiel was a single mom now and it made him dizzy just thinking about it. The hits just kept on coming for Cas, and Dean wondered how many of those hits were inflicted by him personally.
“Alone.” Sam threw Dean a bitch face and tossed a few t-shirts into his bed, turning back to pick up toiletries from his tipped-over bag. “I ended up finding blood leading out of the caves. I followed it for some time, even found some shoe prints along it, but the trail faded. I was going to look anyway, but I figured getting killed wouldn’t do us any good, and you wouldn’t know where to look if something happened to me. Other people would get killed.
“I got you. If...if you really want to do this, if you’re ready, then you don’t have to worry about not having been with a guy yet, Cas. I’ve done this before and, look, if you’ve had anal before then you know the drill—” Dean paused to snicker. “Pun intended.”
Meg, Kevin, Sam, and Dean all jolted out of place, striding towards the tower. Behind them, Balthazar finished his descent down the steps, taking three at a time.
