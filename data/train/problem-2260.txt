John struggled to remember the few words he knew of his grandmother’s language, “I am a rihtlæce, a doctor. I want to help you. Níedhelp, small one.”
The private scrambled desperately to his hands and knees and crawled as fast as he could into the darkness.   John watched him leave and then scanned the area for any other alphas who may have been hovering while their mate tried his luck. If there had been any, they were gone now, he noted grimly.  He turned into his tent once more, secured the door and, finding the omega had disappeared, went to his cot and squatted beside it. He called out softly, “Hey little one, I’d like you to come out now… the soldiers are gone, it’s just me here now and I won’t hurt you, I promise.”
Warning for graphic sexual violence and deadly violence
Once out of Graves’ office, John walked down the hall, his slight limp showing but hardly noticeable to those passing him. He found an empty briefing room not far away and sat down to review his target’s file.
John heard Mycroft hiss in irritation but since Sherlock was evidently refusing to say anything further, he left, closing the door behind him with a barely restrained click. He hadn't been gone a minute before John was further surprised to hear the sudden loud thump of Sherlock's fist hitting the table accompanied by a frustrated curse. Sherlock then rose and strode to the door; there was a momentary silence while he pulled his greatcoat from its hook before he left the flat, slamming the door behind him.
He locked both arms tightly around Sherlock and laid his cheek against Sherlock’s back and began to thrust into him. The sensation was bliss beyond anything John could have imagined! Even sexually experienced as he was, he had never felt the level of physical and emotional arousal that he felt now. Too late, he realized that he was utterly unprepared for it; a fierce instinct to dominate and subdue his Omega absolutely, was swamping him.  He tried to fight it but he was already lost, helpless against the powerful drive to claim Sherlock. He gritted his teeth with the effort to stop before he hurt Sherlock or frightened him, but his body disobeyed him and he continued to push into Sherlock, hardly withdrawing before surging against him again.
As John watched him, he saw the youth’s mouth tremble slightly and, although it was difficult to say for certain, what he thought were tears on his cheeks.  With a gentle hand, John cupped the omega’s chin and tipped his face up towards his own. “You must be a very special person to have survived such a traumatic event and traveled so far from your home,” he smiled and stroked a tear away with his thumb. “What is your name?”
John fell silent.
“I need an assistant,” responded Blackburn.
John started in confusion.  He cleared his throat.  “Yes, of course, yes, sorry, ah…I think a bath, not a shower, might be best.” He cleared his throat again and moistened his lips with his tongue. “Why don’t you sit on the toilet and hold onto the basin.” He gestured vaguely, “Just in case you become dizzy again.”
John said, “Nauseous too are you? I see you were fibbing when you told me you’d eaten dinner.” He chuckled, “Bet you didn’t expect to get found out about that, did you?”

“When you needed me?”  John stoked his silken curls.
“Bubbles, John?” questioned Sherlock, eyeing a mountain of white froth billowing up over the bath water, obscuring it completely.
“We’ll double your compensation.” The dark-haired man behind the desk studied his contractor.
"John." Sherlock surprised John by reaching out and taking his hand. "Given what you've just told me, would you be willing to consider that the things Harvey said about you−to you, were wrong? That they were not true?"
There was a tense silence for several long seconds more before Sherlock seemed finally to catch on to John’s plan. When he did, he lowered himself cautiously into a crouch in front of the boy, his coat draping both sides of his tall frame − just like the bat-cape noted John absently.
John moved closer, straining for contact.
"Harvey has been killed. I thought something like this might happen. You are in danger John, I'm certain of it now. We must be very care−"
Sherlock rolled his head to look at John across from him.  In a rare moment of stark honestly, he said, “I know it was wrong of her and my parents to do that to me, John, but what’s done is done.  I cannot undo it, no matter how much I may want to.”
Sherlock's voice and face were gentle again. "But John, what you told me was all I needed to know. Without your account, I would still be as much in the dark as before, we all would be. You are the one who helped solved the mystery, John."
It was at that moment that he heard something different, or imagined he did; a small sound of distress… a whimper or a gasp… Suddenly alert, he strained, listening for it again.  It had sounded child-like… which was impossible; there were no children for hundreds of miles in any direction. Had the sound been made by an animal then?
This time at the sound of John’s voice, Blackburn lurched partially upright to grip John’s arms and look up at him. His eyes tearful, he begged between short breaths, “See that Mycroft looks after her… Will you do this for me? Please…!”

"Yes, John. I'm sorry. If I could do anything to bring him back to you I would."
"I do, I need to, Sherlock."
Then he said earnestly, “Sherlock, here, for the first time in my life, I feel happy, like I’m home. With you I feel secure; I can be myself and flourish. So, I don’t want whatever you are talking about. I only want you. I want us.” He sighed, “And now, I’m just going to pretend that you didn’t say any of what you said earlier, except for the I-love-you-John part.”
Instantly alert, Sherlock closed the book and drew John to his chest; resting his chin on John’s head. “What is it?”
For the first time in a very long time, John laughed; a real laugh, a soft, warm chuckle that vibrated through his chest and caused the man he was holding to sag in relief.
He then grasped both of John’s hands in his and said, “John, I have something to ask you.  I don’t expect you to answer right away but it would make me very happy if you would consider it…”
Sherlock’s instincts were right, if John had been fully penetrating him when he orgasmed, Sherlock would be feeling much differently right now; not empty and unhappy but full, warm and loved… This could be easily addressed if they were to become mates but it wasn’t much help now…
John was back to the vehicle in seconds, holding the key he’d retrieved from under the potted geranium on the front step of the cottage.
John was convinced that Blackburn was not confusing him with the Mycroft he had referred to earlier. The man’s concern for John’s wellbeing appeared to be genuine enough that John was forced to believe it to be real. Nothing about Blackburn was adding up!
They left the flat on foot to make their way to St. Bart’s, not holding hands but each acutely aware of the other, although silent with their own thoughts.  The May day was brilliantly sunny and warm. The city’s parks were full of shrieking children and the pavements were crowded with cheerful people shopping, lunching and generally going about their business without a care in the world, or so it seemed.  The juxtaposition of cheer and promise outside to loss and grief inside was jarring; the sort of casual cruelty of which only nature is capable.
Sherlock turned, his mouth twisting bitterly, “Safe John?! What do you care about my safety?! You knew this would happen, didn’t you?! And you hid it from me! You let me think it was sunstroke! Didn’t you? Didn’t you?” and then, when John's mouth opened but no sound emerged, Sherlock demanded again, “Answer me!”
But he said nothing other than, “Right then. Well, the place is nice, or, could be nice, with a bit of tidying, so, ah, alright then. Let’s give it a try.”
It was a direct order.
The youth continued to stare up at him. He blinked rapidly trying to dispel the tears, but one or two escaped and slid down into his matted hair.  He sniffed and coughed weakly.
Nevertheless, when he bent to the couch it was with gentle hands that he checked the condition of a motionless Blackburn. He noted with satisfaction that Blackburn was sleeping soundly and comfortably.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock’s voice betrayed nothing.
“My lower abdomen,” he whispered, “Cramping pain, John.”
John said softly, “I’m saying emotions are in flux on occasions like what happened yesterday and I want you to feel free to sort through all of them before we decide to change anything about our relationship…”
He paused. “Possibly some of the complex linkages between brain, heart and body that make up human sexuality broke during what happened−your mind’s way of coping with the trauma inflicted on you. It would not be surprising at all if you’re suffering from some pretty crippling shame and fear around acting on sexual desire or even allowing yourself to feel sexual desire. That is what these extreme religious censures are intended to create in children and they have lasting effects. Being threatened with the devil, humiliated and subjected to what amounts to physical torture are traumatizing for anyone but especially for children. I’m not an expert in human sexuality by any means, though. There are specialists who work with people to great success on these kinds of psychological injuries...”
“John?”
“What is it? Are you hurt? What?” John questioned.
"What the hell Sherlock!? Jesus, mate! "
“Will you stay with me John, please?” Sherlock’s voice was ragged and his breathing shallow.
They were nearly finished their meal when Sherlock spoke up, "John?" John looked anxiously at him. "Would you say that −," he couldn't even force the man's name across his lips, "your ex-husband…that he is a man of good judgement?"
“You would hardly feature well in such a story yourself, Captain.”
Sherlock caught John looking at him uncertainly several times over the next few days, which encouraged him greatly. He decided to pursue his experiment further on an unsuspecting John. With careful timing, he emerged from the bathroom one morning, a towel draped precariously low on his hips, beads of water trailing down his strongly muscled chest, to ask John with innocent confusion if he would please lend him his shave balm, as he couldn’t, for the life of him, find where he had put his own.
"I'm sorry John, I'm sorry."
But he had to find Sherlock! Without evidence John was at a loss. If only he could call him! If they were mated it would be as natural as breathing to communicate by mind alone, but they weren’t, and Sherlock was young and inexperienced; he wouldn’t know of such things. He wouldn’t hear John calling to him…
Ten minutes later, they were sitting in the dark, resting their backs against an inside wall of the empty shed. They had made a slow circuit of the interior using Sherlock's mobile for light for they had decided it was too risky to use a torch. The back of the shed had been chosen as a resting spot because it was slightly less damp than everywhere else. John had produced a bar of chocolate and offered it to December who had gulped it down in seconds. Too hungry thought John, anger welling up in his chest once more. There was nothing for the child to drink which concerned him but he couldn't do anything about it for the moment. Sherlock had shed his coat and they had wrapped December in it and placed him between them.
He got up and made his way to the counter to ask for the café’s phone; Sherlock had said his mobile battery was now dead and John's own phone was still missing. He looked back at Sherlock whose rumpled dark head was bent easily toward the child, conversing with him about something, but whose broad shoulders were tense.
It would have to suffice because his observations of Blackburn told him that the man’s condition was continuing to worsen. Blackburn’s heartbeat was erratic, he was too drowsy and between shallow breaths he was starting to cough up phlegm. If his symptoms continued to worsen, John feared the man would not be alive by the time it was daylight.
Gaia Omega were rare, about one in 10,000 and becoming increasingly rare as biology and society evolved to a more egalitarian order. They were biologically different from other Omega, although these differences were not well understood by medical scientists. It was not just their unique ejaculate that set them apart, although this made them highly sexually desirable to Alphas (which Sherlock could now personally attest to.) They had the ability to induce pleasurable altered mental states in Alphas, sensations of peacefulness, happiness, optimism, by proximity alone. They were also unusually fertile and extraordinarily nurturing and protective as mates and parents.
“Yes, Sherlock, I absolutely believe you can and I’ll help you in any way you ask me to, of course!”

John swung around and left the washroom. Sherlock wasn’t far away; John was certain of it, his hiding place would be needed only for a short time, just long enough for him to pass beyond the reach of his tormentors before they found him.
"Danger, Mr. Holmes?" John's whisper was harsh. "There is no danger that matters to me now."
Sherlock nodded and watched John as he crossed the driveway beside the cottage and crouched behind Mike’s parked car. John had the front and rear plates off in seconds and disappeared with them into the garage. Minutes later he was pulling their car to a halt in front of the cottage where Sherlock met him obediently. John locked the door and returned the key to its hiding place under the geranium and ushered Sherlock to the car.
“I said, do it!”
“Yes, John, my love. I know, it’s alright.”
So Sherlock reached to stoke and touch, watching John’s neck and chest flush and feeling his rosy nipples harden under his exploring fingertips. He leaned forward to kiss John’s skin, tasting and breathing him in freely at last. Lost in sensation, he was slow to became aware of John tugging at his T-shirt with a frustrated, “Sherlock!”
John was silent, his breathing almost imperceptible, before he whispered, "I don't… know anything…and I saw…nothing. You can leave now."
John turned to search his face. Then he melted against Sherlock, closed his eyes with a sigh with a whispered, “Thank you. I love you. And all I want is to be with you too, Sherlock.”
“Then let’s work on it John! You won’t even try! You keep pushing me away and pretending there’s nothing between us!”
When he was satisfied that Sherlock’s physical condition was good, John seated himself beside him and drew him into his arms.  He felt Sherlock melt against him and lowered his head to Sherlock’s.  He dusted kisses to the spot on Sherlock’s neck where he’d pressed his teeth earlier, soothing the pinkish mark with his lips.  “Are you paying attention, leifling?” he questioned.
“Fótwærc… níedhelp?” John struggled for the words. Sherlock might not be fluent in modern English, but his knowledge of Old English was far superior to John’s.
Sherlock’s usual expression, the one John had been expecting to see, the one that conveyed, in equal measure, both mystification and barely repressed irritation at the extraordinary dullness of the masses, was nowhere to be seen. In its place was that rare, unconcealed sadness that occasionally crossed Sherlock’s face; heart stopping because it was the only pure and honest emotion that John had ever seen Sherlock display. Any other emotional display was acting; extraordinarily brilliant acting that fooled everyone − except John.
“John.” he breathed.
Even as he growled this order, John turned to the door and reached behind to pull the automatic pistol from his belt, from where he’d placed it the previous night upon learning some of the details of Sherlock’s circumstances. Glancing back to ensure Sherlock had obeyed him and was motionless and low on the couch cushions, John moved to position himself along one wall of the hallway leading to the door and called, “Hang on, hang on! I’m coming.” He then darted silently across the hall to wedge in adjacent to the handle side of the closed door. He reached carefully to turn the door handle; touching it with a slight rattle and as he did so, without notice, two gun shots were fired through the door, at man height, and it was shoved violently open.
John nodded, reaching for the wall for support as he swayed unsteadily. But before he could fall Sherlock lifted him easily, for John was a small man, and turned to carry him the rest of the way to the upstairs room. He was very light and Sherlock glanced down at him in concern. As he did so, his sensitive nose caught the unexpected scent of….what? Under the harsh hospital odor − there it was again…ever so faint. Something sweet and light…Was it clover? For a moment images of dew on grass and delicate spring leaves crossed Sherlock's vision, distracting him. It was several moments before he realized the scent must be that of John himself; John's unique signature, timid but persistent, emerging from under the suffocating odor of Harvey, the hospital, and all else had been smothering him. It tantalized Sherlock and he tried to catch it again, but it had vanished. He set John down on his feet and concentrated on guiding him to sit on the bed where he then removed his shoes for him.
Sherlock’s trousers were still on, but barely; inviting John’s eyes to continue their fascinated exploration of the hills and valleys of Sherlock’s magnificent physique… John drifted again…rectus sheath, pelvis-obliquus, abdominis externus… He followed the slopes and hollows as far as he could, to where they disappeared below Sherlock’s unfastened belt buckle and undone trouser buttons.
“Okay then.” He gave Sherlock another squeeze.  “Now, how about bed?  You seem tired.  A cup of tea and to sleep?”
He didn’t, as it turned out, have to wait long. Several evenings later in a quiet moment…
When Sherlock did not obey him, John lowered his head to growl quietly against Sherlock’s ear and nip his neck lightly in disapproval.  The reprimand was effective.  Sherlock, surprised, quieted immediately in his arms.  His eyes flew open and for the first time since his abduction he looked up at John with full awareness.
John no longer needed to ask questions: a wave of scent had caught up with the soldier and his catch, settling around them like mist in John’s tent.  John, a full blooded and un-bonded alpha was struck forcefully by the unmistakable, compelling scent of a young omega; an omega in heat, or very close to it and, John sniffed again, a virgin.  The second odor that struck him, as vile as the first was sweet, was the dark stench of aroused alphas, a number of them, of varying social status, eager to get to the young omega first and prepared to fight for the opportunity. John reacted instinctively; adopting a rigid stance, shoulders back and chest out, prepared to defend or attack, which ever was required first.
He wasn’t kidding, John realized incredulously. “Ah. Yes.  Very attractive Sherlock,” he said cautiously; Sherlock was definitely not ready to hear about just how attractive John thought he was or all the things he had imagined them doing together, at one time or another…
Then... silence.
As he stared down into Blackburn’s pale face, to John’s confusion, rather than relief, he was conscious of a sense of loss as the Blackburn's brilliant eyes shuttered closed.
The youth did not respond initially, afraid to do as John asked, but obeyed finally; opening his eyes and raising them to look into John's.
Startled, Sherlock answered, “No! No, you mistake me John, it’s…it’s fine. You saved my life…ah…thank you.”
geáreorden – to decide
The youth, watching him carefully, nodded.
“I did nothin’ with ’im! He’s in the room right where we put ‘im! Waitin’ for you while you get ready for ‘im, just like you said! I got the stuff ready for you, like always, but I didn’t go in there, I swear!”
John grinned back and rose from the edge of the sofa. Still holding Sherlock’s hands, he tugged him up and growled, “Then get! Into bed now!”
Sherlock’s arms tightened fiercely and he made a sound strangely like he was laughing and crying at the same time. “Yes, John. It’s more than alright. Thank you.”
John emerged from his room some time later. He came quietly down the stairs, glanced tentatively at Sherlock − who smiled reassuringly at him − and went to the kitchen. He appeared to be making tea. That was good thought Sherlock, feeling relieved; making tea was always a good sign.
John turned serious. “Sherlock, I suspect the cramping will begin again soon. I’m going to get you a muscle relaxant and a hot water bottle, alright?” Seeing Sherlock’s pleading expression, he reassured him gently, “I won’t be gone long, I promise. And I want you to let me help you into bed before I go upstairs. But first, were you trying to get to the loo?”
Sherlock would not face him; he turned his head only half-way back toward John and said roughly, “I’m sorry John. I…I don’t know why I feel…I mean…why I said what I did.” He sounded stricken. “I won’t ever do it again, of course. I understand that you may date whoever you choose to, I mean, I know it’s none of my business, none at all. I hope that you will forgive me, John. Please don’t be angry with me.” He then pulled his head back in the window and not looking at John, strode to the door, grabbed his coat and left the flat without looking back.
"My father made me and my brothers learn when we were boys. He expected that we would all be soldiers, like him. My brothers are all Alphas. Father was…surprised that I was…different. I…didn't like what they liked. I…I don't like to shoot things, Sherlock."
“Sherlock! If you don’t answer me I’m coming in.”
His intention stated, he turned Sherlock’s face to his with insistent fingers and sought his eyes.  “I want you as my mate.” And then, as it was a formal proposal, he bowed his head before Sherlock, as was proper under the circumstances, and recited the unity vow, “Ic gewedde þē, I pledge myself to you.” Then, overcome with emotion, he whispered, “Ic déore þē, myn déorling.” He looked down into Sherlock’s beautiful eyes and waited to let the seriousness of his proposal sink in.
“Yes, of course you do,” John had agreed easily as he propped his patient up into a position where he would find breathing easier.
John grinned and nodded and reached to ruffle Sherlock’s hair as he settled with his book beside him; then had to catch his breath when he found himself caught in the beam of Sherlock’s brilliant blue gaze.
He opened his eyes again to study Blackburn.  Even in slack repose there was something visible of the bold expression that John had taken for arrogance when he had seen Blackburn’s picture.  John had been mistaken of course, it wasn’t arrogance. It was something quite different; a raw brashness directed at…what? Life itself? John wasn’t certain.  And that brashness, the bold challenge in Blackburn’s expression was backed up by fierce courage. John had seen it in the man’s fight for his life and his decision to surrender its outcome to John, an abductor whom he had no reason to trust. Traitor or not, John knew he was in the presence of a remarkable man.
John looked afraid. "What?"
“I know, I know you are. But just look at me. Look Sherlock.”
Sherlock looked as though he was about to argue but thought better of it.  He nodded grudgingly and reclining his head to the back of the couch he closed his eyes once more.
But even as he sat up to grasp his rifle in preparation to investigate the door of his tent was pushed open and a filthy brute of a soldier filled the entrance.
"John, what is it!?"
He knew that tracking Sherlock wouldn’t be difficult; Sherlock's scent would be strong in the hot, still air of late afternoon in the city. John caught it immediately and began to follow it, moving quickly but preserving energy; Sherlock in his adrenaline fueled panic would be able to cover a long distance in a short amount of time and John must be able to follow him for at least a mile or perhaps farther.
dúnælf − mountain elves
He was gone only a short time but once back and climbing the stairs, about half way up, he was struck full force with a powerful physical hit; an Omega in heat. And afraid. And not just any Omega, his Omega. His beloved Sherlock was alone and in distress, desperately needing his Alpha; it was all there, all the information John needed was in the pungent air. He dropped the shopping on the stairs, unaware he was doing so, and bolted up to the flat’s door. He banged through it, following the scent straight to the loo. The door was locked, but he didn’t knock, he put his good shoulder against it and shoved. It splintered under the force of his thrust as he’s known it would. As it shattered, he heard a shrill scream of terror from Sherlock behind it, which only aroused him further.
John fell back as if stung. He put a hand to his mouth and his face burned with embarrassment. "Oh God, Sherlock, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. Please forgive me! I acted without thinking, I'm just so glad you aren't hurt or dead, that I…"
“It’s alright,” John soothed, “I told you I would not be gone long. You did not believe me, sweeting?” John drew back the folds of the bag to look at Sherlock.
“You sweetheart,” breathed John and kissed him again.  He dried and wrapped Sherlock in the other towel, blew out the candles and pulled him into his bedroom. There he urged Sherlock into bed, naked, and joined him after laying his new robe carefully over the back of a chair.  He cuddled Sherlock close and suggested, “A little lie-in then?”
John smiled for the second time that evening.
Seizing the moment with sudden inspiration, John said, "Yes, December, I just call him Sherlock sometimes, you're right, we should call him Batman. And he's here to help you."
No John, thought Sherlock grimly to himself in the silence. I don’t suppose it will. He felt sick at what he sensed was coming. But John seemed to want to talk about it so he gave him an encouraging hug and steeled himself to listen.
"No, John, it's fine. It's just that I have some information for you if you would like to hear it. I….I'm sometimes not good at timing though, so if this isn't a good time, just tell me, please. I don't want to upset you again…"
To John's concern, the boy shrank back into the corner once more and whispered anxiously, "You won't tell Joe will you?"
“He killed the old lady because she was about to describe him.” It was anxiously stated and this together with the other things Blackburn had said, pointed to a man very much concerned about the wellbeing of the people in his life. John puzzled over this as he retook Blackburn’s vital signs and blotted the perspiration from his face countless times over the course of the morning. It was impossible to ignore the incongruence of the man John was nursing back to life and the cold-hearted man whose profile John had studied so carefully on the previous day.
“Alright. I’m going to help you to under the shelter where I want you to stay while I get a bin-bag from the shop-front. Then, I’m sorry, but you must change your clothes. You smell fantastic, you really do, but we need to mask it as best we can right now. I will give you my pants and shirt but I want you to put on a pair of the dead men's trousers. I’m sorry. It’s the only way. Mine won’t fit you. It will be for just a short time, alright?”
John interrupted the silent communication between Sherlock and Lestrade. "I'll make tea for you both, if you like…" He glanced nervously at Sherlock.
Sherlock was indignant. “I do not snore−” he began, before adding “Oh, you’re teasing me again aren’t you, John?”
Mycroft ignored it. He said, “I am aware of the risk my brother faces from QAT. What is his level of risk with this, ah…” he consulted his notes, “Captain John H. Watson?”
John was a dead weight in Sherlock's arms, unconscious and barely breathing: the trauma of losing his pregnancy and the abandonment by his bonded partner were sending him into shock. He was even whiter than before with the ugly exception of the bond mark on his neck, highly visible where his head lolled against Sherlock's chest and now burning into a dark red, the colour of dried blood. As Sherlock watched in disbelief, it rapidly turned to black and began rising like a blister. He had never seen anything like it; without a doubt John was going to die if he didn't receive immediate medical intervention.
At this Sherlock’s expression shuttered closed.  He drew himself up with an indrawn breath before looking away and agreeing quietly, “Yes, of course.  I’m sure you’re right, John.”
“No, no, no, please no, please no, Sir please!” The man was now blubbering in fear.
“Good.  I am going to the next room, just for a few moments.  I will be right back.  You will still hear and see me, alright?”
“Next Thursday.  Will you come out with me?”
Glossery
"Chicken-shit," he said finally, in a small, obedient voice.
Ic déore þē - I adore you
John stepped over the body of the sergeant lying in its growing pool of blood and red splattered trousers.  Ignoring it, he looked around the room for doors and saw two. One, he discovered, led to a hallway and the other to a toilet.  He chose the latter, entering the room and scanning it; issuing a furious hiss when his gaze fell on loops of black strapping and hand cuffs dangling from a water pipe in the corner of the room.
“No!” John blurted out in the empty room. “No!”
Something in his tone caught at John’s emotions and he said impulsively, “You have had such difficult and frightening experiences youngling, ic i ámundae; let me care for you and keep you safe from now on. It gives me pleasure to do so.”
He returned to Sherlock, whose eyes had not left him, and reached out his hand. Sheltering him from CCTV view, John undressed him. First his shirt was removed and stuffed into the plastic bag, then John shed his own shirt and buttoned it onto Sherlock, rolling the cuffs back to disguise the too-short sleeves. Now in just his vest, John quickly stripped his own trousers and pants, replacing his trousers again but helping Sherlock gently out of his wet and stained clothes and into John’s pants and the replacement trousers. The belt was used to secure the too large waist around Sherlock.
But before she could say anything, John lifted his eyes from the still baby in his arms to look at Sherlock.  He smiled gently and reached a hand to Sherlock’s cheek.  “Come here,” he said.
"Yes?" he responded, flexing his sore shoulder and wondering absently if he was getting too old for this sort of activity. A whiskey and a good book before the fire would have been a pleasant way to spend Christmas Eve...
Nǣfre − never
They stood hand in hand before the tiny grave. Its white marble gravestone and swirling gold inscription of Robin Geoffrey Watson-Holmes reflected brilliantly in the May sunshine.  And the light was glorious now; the punishing glare of the morning was lost in the soft green of afternoon in the cemetery.
“Well, that’s easy. You already know you can say anything to me, talk to me about anything. I’m pretty open about sex and so on…”
John began to sob again. "I begged them to give him to me…but they wouldn't."
Sherlock set his violin aside and took John’s hands, guiding him to the sofa. And because he couldn’t not, he kissed him and smiled. “John, do you know that when you orgasm, you ejaculate?” Nothing like getting straight to the point.
Now that he knew the cause of Blackburn’s medical crisis, John gave him an injection of Flumazenil, the antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. It was risky, the drug sometimes induced seizures, but it offered Blackburn’s best chance for recovery from his current precarious state. His medical profile had shown nothing to counter-indicate the use of the drug.
John deliberately lowered his voice, "There's a child in the corner of the room, Sherlock."
Sherlock interrupted, beside himself with anger and fear, “You thought you could breed me and enslave me, didn’t you?! That’s why you didn't tell me!” He then turned and wrenched at the door handle, frantic to get away from John.
Gaia Omega were sensitive with greater needs for love and security in order to flourish and share their special gifts. Gaia characteristics emerged only when these unique Omega felt safe and valued. Sherlock had never seen one, but the bond mark of a secure and contented Gaia Omega was said to be very beautiful, similar to a gemstone in optical phenomenon; and a status symbol for their Alpha mate.
There was a thoughtful silence from December following this remark, before he said sadly, "I'm not lucky, I don't have any friends."
“No, it’s that I… can’t offer you a normal physical relationship.” He looked miserably away to the window. “I mean a full sexual relationship.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John, in full crisis mode, knelt on one knee in front of Sherlock, laid a hand on his shoulder and tried to get his attention.
He pulled a weapon and began to pick his way slowly into the structure. The bunker wasn’t empty as he’d thought it might be. Pallets of crates were stacked up toward its high, rounded roof, providing enough of a cover to hide the small sound John’s boot made when he caught a stone in the darkness. He crept forward and before long he could hear distinct voices up ahead; harsh and querulous.
"Yuk, sorry Sherlock, it must be the Indian food. I'm really sorry…"
The effort was too much for his failing system, Blackburn collapsed against the couch cushions. He struggled for breath, trying to speak to John, although the ability was leaving him, “Look at me! I’m afraid!” Blackburn’s pupils were the size of pinpoints as he stared at John. His lips were blue and his face white.
Doris, who really was a kind woman, as it turned out, if always short of time, quickly summed up the situation and nodded in agreement. There was an audible sigh of relief from John and Lestrade. Sherlock's shoulders relaxed slightly and the muffled sobbing inside the coat quieted.
“I don’t do extraordinary renditions.” The stocky blond man’s tone was emotionless, as was his expression.
Sherlock stiffened, “You can’t, John! You could be killed! You have to turn me over! There is no other way!”
As for Blackburn, although robbed of his reason and mastery over his own body, he knew enough to surrender to the man in whose hands he found himself.  Whether he would live or die, by unspoken agreement between the two of them, was now John’s to determine.
“What? Recognized what?” John was confused.
John smiled even wider.  Once he’d been set down again, he reached up to stroke Sherlock’s wet curls from his forehead and replied, “I love you too, Sherlock!”
But John was already moving, not toward the car, but back toward Sherlock; his hand involuntary reaching to grasp Sherlock’s lax one.  Powerful emotions chased themselves across his face in rapid succession; angst, confusion, protectiveness… love.
John was now stroking Sherlock's curls absently. "Hmmmm, yes and I'm glad I did. Otherwise I would never have said anything because I didn't think you wanted to bond with me."
before he had to escape back to the bathroom where he received the balm around the door with a mumbled, “Thank you”.
He made his way to the kitchen where he boiled the kettle for a cup of tea. Glowing with happiness he carried his mug to the sofa where he opened a book and sat down to wait for Sherlock to return. He did not wait for long. It was not half an hour later that Sherlock strode into the flat looking, to John's surprise, relaxed and pleased with himself. He had a bag of take-away Chinese under his arm and upon seeing John smiling at him from the sofa; shucked off his coat, tossed it vaguely in the direction of its hook on the back of the door and made straight for John.
John listened to the laboured breathing. The omega seemed to be trying to listen to him for it held its breath each time John spoke.
This is the scene that greeted Mycroft as he arrived in the doorway accompanied by Mrs. Hudson once again, who looked around the room, shaking her head and clicking her tongue in gentle disapproval.
John stopped, surprised and then grinned.  “I must take you with me, Ælfscíene? He chuckled as he saw Sherlock’s sober nod.  “Alright.”  Turning on the night-table light, he wrapped an arm around Sherlock in the sleeping bag and lifted him to carry him to the anteroom.  Here, with Sherlock still held firmly in one arm, he pulled a Hotpack of rations from his kit and returned to the bedroom.  He re-settled Sherlock, whose bright eyes had followed every movement and set the soup to heat.
“John, I…”
“Well, there’s another way to make sure you aren’t bothered by seeing any semen…”
Sherlock was anxious. "Are you sure John? Let me look at you. I have to know that you really want this for yourself and not for me." He held John's face gently in order to study him carefully. John knew better than to attempt to communicate anything other than the truth under the scrutiny of that all-seeing, ice-blue gaze. He bore it with equanimity for there was nothing to hide and everything to share.
John turned to look at Sherlock, puzzled amusement in his eyes.  “Yes, of course…why?”
And so Sherlock could drink his fill of John as he stroked and caressed, grateful that he could do this for John; fulfill his needs and give him pleasure. He firmly suppressed his own excruciating arousal and concentrated on pleasing John, learning what John liked and responded to most. He experimented, alternating light upward strokes and firm downward strokes and smooth thumb circles over the engorged head of John’s erection until abruptly, John writhed in his arms and arched against him with a choked off groan. He panted and shuddered once more before opening his eyes and reaching up with both arms to Sherlock. His face was full of amazed wonder as he kissed Sherlock and whispered into his ear. Sherlock answered with a soft growl of approval and kissed him back firmly.
"Hello, Harry," droned the group. "You just left not too long ago, though. What happened?" The group's leader asked, concerned.
"Seriously, though, John," he chuckled, "I have no idea what I would have done if you didn't step up like that," He said, giving John's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "You're a hero, John," John's eyes widened and he moved back from Jacob,
"John, come in,"
William was more active in the school again. He went to lectures more regularly and he even tried to eat sometimes. He was back to normal before John Watson entered his life. Of course, William still thought of the blonde boy often, he'd frequently try to block the memories from his head. One fall midday, William was walking from class to class, fag in hand, headset bocking his hearing out with Paul Inka's 'put your head on my shoulder,' humming along to it, moving his fingers to what position they'd need to be to play it on the violin. Unfortunately, William didn't hear all of the kids running through the halls in a panicked frenzy, screaming, but as soon as the second shot fired, William was bumped in the shoulder by a passerby, fleeing from the scene, knocking his headset from his left ear. The screams startled William. They were so loud. William turned around and was frozen in fear. His face was of pure hatred.
"Greg, I was just stopping the fight," John said, finally able to get out a single sentence. Greg's nose furrowed and he opened his mouth to speak, but Cart interjected.
"Wait, what?" Sherlock asked. He hadn't gone by that name since he was in college, os how does Mike know? Sherlock met Mike in the hospital after the shooting. Unless, "Are you joking," Sherlock asked, his face turning down in surprise, "John talked about me?" Sherlock asked. Mike nodded,
"Meet me in the courtyard later?" John suggested, looking up at him. Sherlock rolled his eyes, but relented anyway,
"His vitals are under control again, his seizures stopped earlier this morning, and he stopped throwing up slugs not too long after we brought him in, sir," John said as Flitwick climbed onto the chair to the left of Sherlock,
"What do you deduce, John!?" William asked loudly as he quickly stood up and threw the papers at John. Once John saw them, his head snapped up.
"How's school?" She asked. William's eyes looked a bit panicked at first as if he'd been found out or something.
"The police don't consult amateurs,"
After supper, when they were finishing up on saying their farewells to Mike, Murray confronted John about something.
"John, we're flatmates, best friends, and everything in between; what makes you think I don't know your NI number?" Sherlock gave a wry laugh, kind of like a scoff. There was the sound of a case shutting and being set to the wood floors, then rolling, slowing to a stop in front of the bathroom door, cracking it open an inch or two. "You should be careful where you put your pants, Dr Watson; wouldn't want you leaving the country without them,"
I have been informed of your medicinal triumphs here at Hogwarts, having saved the life of your friend, young Ravenclaw, William SS Holmes, twice, now. I award your house 150 points for your speedy and split-second instincts to help others. However, I also was informed that you snapped young Slytherin, James Moriarty's, wand and threatened him after giving him a few punches. I expect you two to meet me in the West Towers, my office, first thing after dinner to explain each of your sides and discuss a fair punishment. You may or may not get detention. I look forward to meeting with you both and learning about what has been going on.
"No, John! It's me," Sherlock said, pulling up his sleeve, revealing the faint yet still present scar on his right forearm.
"I don't...matter,"
"Not at all; you do you," John said, not thinking of looking over.
"Oh, John H. Watson Jr," He read out,
"This is Mary Morstan. She's a very gifted first-year transfigurer, and she'll make sure you pass this next exam, is that clear, John?" She asked. John immediately nodded.
"I'm fine," He said, "I'm perfectly fine," John didn't quite believe that, however, he knew to an extent how angry William can get when he's pushed to express himself, so John didn't want to cross an unnecessary line.
"What, no. Sebastian thinks of you as his younger brother, John. He cares a great deal about you. Why do you think he tries to keep me from you?" William asked, chuckling, "He thinks I'm dangerous," William said with a devious smirk as he turned to continue walking. John could have sworn he saw a wink in William's eyes, but as William said, he was high as a kite.
Sherlock left, off to find a phone box. Once he found one, Sherlock sat inside, looking through the book. "Watson," He whispered and let the pages flap amongst themselves, sorting out the different names, numbers, and addresses. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and skimmed along with the thin page that lay still in the book. "John H. Watson Sr?" Sherlock tore that page out and exited the booth.
As they walked up to the circulation desk, Sherlock carefully slid his father's copy ID across to the man behind the desk, who looked up with a cocked brow. "What'll it be today, Mr Holmes?"
He wasn't like William. He was more social, and probably one of the most Cassanova-like boy William had encountered in that school. 'Heh,' William thought as he let out a chuckle, 'figures, he's the only Cassanova I know, and I've inevitably fallen for him,' William climbed into a comfortable sleep-like state when he thought his last thought of the night, 'what will I do without him?'
"John," William repeated, leaning towards John further.
Sherlock scoffed and began texting as John opened the bathroom door, letting another cloud of condensation out of the room with him. The smell of John hit him almost instantly and he thought about how he wouldn't be able to sleep in the same room as him all throughout his case. God, he'd better solve it soon...!
"Hello, how may I help you?" She asked, smiling brightly as the job description required.
"He tell you that?" Sherlock quipped with a sharp chuckle, only but glancing up to see that Mary was doing the same.
"You don't want to know, sir," John said, looking down.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After Dumbledore gave an apology for the rocky start to a new year at Hogwarts, he gave his entrance ceremony speech, then allowed the supper to begin.
"Famous detective's in town," she heard and nodded with a smile. She knew what was going on by now,
"Hey, Scot!" One of the bullies called from down the hall. John sighed, rolling his eyes. He slowed to a stop in the middle of the hallway and turned, closing his charms book, which was the only thing, save for his wand, left from Hogwarts.
"What do you want, Dimmock?"
"We're bringing him into the Hospital wing, Madam," He said, waving his hand to tell John to pull, "You can follow and help us... W-what was it again, John,"
"Uh, well, I brought some things back this morning, afternoon, and before I came out, so there should be enough," William said.
"What are you doing here? Going to chase my roommate away again?" He asked, a mean look on his face.
John kneeled between William's knees and guided William's uninjured hand to his shoulder, and John held the boy's arm with a steady hand.
"Alright, but you owe me...!" he said with a sarcastic face of cringed anger.
"I beg of you," John said, spitting in Jim's direction. John felt a small tugging on the side of his shirt. He looked over to see Sherlock's eyes, half-lidded. He looked exhausted as his hand dropped again. Sherlock looked beyond John, towards the door. John turned back, expecting Jim to stand next to Dumbledore. Instead, there stood Mary, who looked at John's newly bruised fist. "Mary,"
He looked behind him, then leaned over the railings. He saw that the level below him was lined up perfectly, so he threw his bag down and climbed over said railing, then turned himself around and jumped. As he landed, the shifting of the staircase below his unsteady feet had him off balance. John fell, grabbing his bag strap as he tumbled down the turning staircase. Kids from the safer side of the stairs looked, surprised that a student was daring and brave enough to be case hopping. John looked up at Greg, who was staring down in disbelief at John. He stood and went down to the safe platform, then hopped down two more levels to the first floor with a roll as he landed.
"They didn't give you a choice, did they?" John asked, finally connecting the dots. "You had to do it; You were abused," John sighed out of disappointment in himself.
William was hooked. He used to cover the pain of John leaving him. John only knew of the hash, although he still considered that as a drug. After the holiday, it took John a few months to start smoking again, although he wouldn't leave when William smoked, he actually seemed to enjoy the second-hand smoke in his lungs.
Harry was glaring at John as if he'd just kicked a puppy and John knew why: He'd left them to deal with dad all this time. John's mum gently wrapped her arms around John's shoulders, pulling him in for a hug. "Usually we go home for holidays, not mid integration," John muttered as he didn't respond to the embrace, shouting the state of trust right there. "Uh, I have to go to breakfast," he said, gingerly pulling himself away from his mum, "Sorry," he tightened his lips.
"I'm fine; it's just a sore shoulder," William said, glaring at the table.
"I almost died for this one; you should be thanking me," Sherlock snarled as he hailed a taxi.
"Well, we're running you there ourselves, so I assume it is," The man said with a bitterly satisfied smile, "Lestrade will run the paperwork, and before you know it, you'll be out of the Yard and in a comfy bed in Rehab."  The man widened his smile as the intern stood up to run said paperwork.
John followed Sherlock to the Library. "Stay to the side, don't intervene unless things go sideways," Sherlock muttered as he opened the door.
John only took thirty Galleons, ten Sickles. He slid the bag back to Sherlock, who took a sideways glance.
'Don't miss your dentist, brother mine -SH 09.14'
"It's me, John, and I'm coming in," John warned as he opened the door slowly to find the room empty and a mess. Things were strewn and thrown around. Things were broken and John saw a faint droplet trail of a dark red substance on the floor.
And, they've done it. They actually broke the drug ring, mainly with Sherlock's help to point them in the right direction. The night they broke it was a rough one. Sherlock was calling Lestrade whilst running after the leader, James Hudson. He'd been popping into town to transport the American drugs to London. Sherlock recognised him from one of his fix searches. He'd gone undercover and infiltrated a den, where James was. He'd bought the dope from James, however, he must've known about London's cracking down so he'd almost forced Sherlock to take it on the spot. James took a shot near Sherlock's foot when the taller man pulled out his dagger. Sherlock hopped back about a foot, letting James escape. Sherlock pushed James' people out of his way and began to chase after the man. They'd gone through the streets and Lestrade finally picked up.
"Hello-?" John was cut off, however, by his sister's angry, balled-up fist to his face.
"What? Are you saying that I'm stupid or something!?" the bully shouted, making John chuckle.
They held staring contests, highest seat-jumper competition, and loudest humming sessions. None of them counted for anything because they were just bored.
"What's up with you, Will? You've been acting different ever since that man came for you that day." John asked, turning to reveal his angered and confused face.
"No," William said, walking over to the side of the elevated bleacher to hold his arms out, "You're just high," John laughed as he leaned towards William, letting the taller boy guide him to the ground. As they stumbled towards the dorm buildings, they shared jokes that became inside only to them, they laughed, and they chilled, saying nothing for a while.
"Oh," John let out. Did Sherlock trick me, or did he not know? John thought. John and Jacob made it back just as the last of the first years had filled up the wooden rowboats.
"And, what do you feel when you get your high, versus when you don't, Sherlock?" The man running the group asked, tilting his head a bit.
John didn't buy an owl. John's dad wasn't on to let him have a bird in the house, squawking it up in the middle of the bloody night. John's mum took a sweeter approach and told him to maybe focus on school and not so much on pets as this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for him. John certainly didn't want to disappoint his mum, so he agreed that he didn't need a pet to go with him to Hogwarts.
John abruptly switched the temperature as he found his thoughts turning down a darker, more satisfying turn that John didn't feel comfortable with. From hot to cold. He didn't want to think anymore. John quickly finished his shower and dried himself off without thinking of you-know-who, however, as John exited the bathroom, clad in only his pyjama trousers, still roughly towelling off his hair with one hand, holding his dirty clothes with the other, John found it more and more difficult to think of the boy, because he was standing at the door.
"Yes, I suppose. Since you're new, you're lucky, Holmes, I'll have to allow another week on your project." The man sighed as he gave a short, cold glare to William, then warmly smiled as he looked at John.
"You've got a bug, you know?" Sherlock said without looking at the blonde man, letting go of his hand as the cab had pulled up to the side of the road.
"It's gonna hurt like hell," John warned. William nodded as John looked back down at the injury. John began to stitch William up. William squeezed John's shoulder to help compensate the pain with grit, however, William's not so sure if it actually helped.
"Hello, Mike,"
Sherlock woke up in a cold sweat, springing up from the bed. His curls were matted to his head in the perspiration dripping from him like a shower. Sherlock pushed them from his eyes to no avail as they only swung heavily back down with gravity. He couldn't even remember what his dream was about, but it must've been bad if he woke up like that. Sherlock looked outside to see that the sun hadn't even risen yet. He sighed heavily and slowly eased himself from his bed.
"Hooper," Sherlock replied, slowly looking back to his book, "you don't have to be up here until noon," he said sharply, trying to figure out why she wasn't still in the dungeons where her house is. "Mary's already going to walk down to breakfast with John. I've got Victor, personally, so..."
Molly tried to flirt with him once more. Just as he was about to give in to her superficial banter and throw her a bone for once, Mike decided to hurl him a prehistoric fossil.
"So, you really don't have health insurance, then?" Sherlock asked, causing John to nearly freeze. Sherlock nodded to a big building with a sign,
On the walk back, which really was pretty brief, Jacob asked, "so, are you parents wizards, or...?"
"Uh, sure," John cracked a smile.
"But, as I sat down, just, now, I'm getting the distinct but very familiar smell of Cigarette smoke on your jacket, but not too potent for you to smoke."
"Huh, where?" came the muffled, distant response. Even more so in the space between them, Sherlock had responded with,
"It's fine, William," John said, ripping the fabric and quickly tying it around William's forearm. William winced as John pulled on the cloth. "Too tight?" John asked. William shook his head. "Okay, let me just," John said as he walked over to his coat, dug inside of the breast pocket, and walked back with a small sewing starter-kit. William sat up as he knew what was going to come next.
William sat up and sighed. "You wouldn't want to know," He said, "It'll ruin your image of me," He ran a hand through the mop of messy curls.
"There, just reassurance," William said, sounding satisfied with his work. "Now, something to do while John's in class,"
"This one's free of charge," The student said, pulling out something wrapped in cloth, "but when you need more -- and, trust me, you will need more -- you'll need to pay me,"
After the last stitch was pulled and John tied, then bit the string off, John ripped anther section off his shirt and tied it around the stitched up area.
"I hope you like transfiguration for first-years with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs," John said. The perfect stood, unfolding his arms and straightening himself out,
"Oh, my bloody hell, mum!!" He shouted in disgust, "Hell no!" He shrieked as he plopped himself to the bed once more, pulling a pillow over his face, "hsnmshn," He mumbled, hoping that nothing of harm would come from that, but his mum just lifted the pillow and asked him to repeat. William closed his eyes with a blush on his face. He took a deep breath and was finally ready to say it. "Okay, the person I like;" He started, but his bedroom door opened and they both looked to see William's father pop his head in.
"But," John said, a bit dumbfounded, "Doesn't the Nokia 9000 Communicator come out in August?" John asked. William only nodded, then turned the mobile around for his own eyes to bask in the glory of the advanced technology.
"Uh, you d-dropped ou pencil," John said. He made his limping way over to Sherlock and crouched down to pick it up with a groan. Sherlock immediately snapped his head to glare at Mike,
"Why are you here?" John asked.
William sat in the police station, waiting for someone to let him go after his list of drug charges had been served.
"We were making a point," he said as his Gryffindor friend joined him on the parted pavements.
"Hmm," an amused hum as he heard John's small grunt, "how much does your arse hurt right now?" He asked, chuckling quietly as the stirring of coffee could be heard.
"Oh, no. I was about to go back to my dorm anyway; You should go, John." William butt in as John looked at him with the same caring smile. John's smile faded.
"Very well," She said, seemingly satisfied with John's apology, "however, I'm assigning you a tutor," she said. John looked up at her, unsure of how to react. His frontal association area hadn't yet fully processed how to feel when Professor McGonagall called a name and the door gently opened. A blonde Ravenclaw girl stood there, looking at the ground with a timid feel to her.
"Hey, you can't just-" A boy shouted as Sherlock started up the stairs to their boys' dormitories. Sherlock barged into the room and looked to find that all of the beds had a trunk or cage underneath, except one. Sherlock felt his heart tighten and his eyes water. He was gone. John wasn't here anymore. Sherlock's leg gave out and he fell against the door post. He felt his stomach lurch and he didn't know what to do, now.
"Yeah," John said, then his face brightened up, "Tell me about it," He said,
"And, I know that all you want to do is shut people out and try to fix it, fix yourself, but I feel like what needs to be said right now is that you're absolutely not alone. A lot of people are going through or have gone through similar situations. And, it's okay," John said softly. Sherlock looked down. "I don't want to make this speech about me, but hell, when I got my letter, it was an absolute uproar at home, more than it usually is," John chuckled nervously.
"This is your dorm?" John asked as he walked in after William opened the door.
Sherlock decided to walk with his books and timetable to the front of the Ravenclaw tower, where Mary talked to a first-year Hufflepuff girl. They laughed and Sherlock sat slowly, sliding himself down to the cold floor, against the wall as he laid his crutches next to him and went through his rucksack to retrieve his book for Herbology, which he had after breakfast, to get refreshed from last week's class.
"Flippendo!" Was aggressively changed by multiple people and the sound of grunts and shouts of pain was hardly drowned out by the harsh chants. Then, half of the chanting voices switched to a different phrase, "Slugulus Eructo!" And the sounds of pain were then mixed with one of wretching, horrible wretching. Jacob looked between two trees to we a large group of Slytherins cast the spells on a single Ravenclaw. The influenced first-years were physically damaging him with punches and kicks. Some were switching rapidly between Lumos and Nox and it made John sick to his stomach when he saw, peeking out behind Jacob.
"I just need to pop in somewhere first," John said, reaching for the door. The perfect, held the door shut with his foot, his arms crossed again,
"Really, are you feeling ill?" John asked, his eyebrows furrowing.
"Get ready, guys," John said. John saw some movements, he saw the guns sticking up from the top of their trenches moving, too. John held up his gun, barrel pointed to the enemy, and he took aim, as he ran. John was surprised to realise that for one of the first times since he's been on the battlefield, his hands became steady, unlike when he was in JROTC in college, nor when he was in boot camp, doing different drills and rundowns of scenarios.
"Do I know him," Sherlock chuckled as he looked back to check if John had left. Once the coast was clear, Sherlock gave a big, bear hug to Mike, surprising the man whilst shouting, "HOW COULD I FORGET HIM!?" Once he let Mike go, Sherlock saw that his brows were furrowed in confusion.
Since then, Sherlock began to move in, however, since the world revolved around how much money one has, Sherlock either had to find a real job or get a flatmate to help with expenses.
"What? Already?" He asked, furrowing his eyebrows. John nodded as he yawned. William let out a pout. "Well, how long will it be?" William asked, closing John's notebook.
The next morning, Mycroft apologised to John whilst they were on lunch break. They both worked in the surgery, but Mycroft was security, not a doctor. He was too sheepish for all of the... contact,
"Way to go, twat!" The kids from his table said, some of the closer ones giving a smack to his arm. They forced him back down, but he still glared at the boy from across the vast room.
"With actual swords? Yes, It was bloody terrifying!" They chuckled some more as John helped him out of the chair and quickly folded it, "But, with our willies? Hell no!" They snickered once more, John carrying the chair with his right arm and keeping his left open in case Sherlock needed help.
The time said it was early enough for breakfast, so he decided to go. He sat down at the end of the table, where he would usually sit, but he tried to limit himself from eating like a pig as it would probably kill him. Sherlock pulled out a book and started to read when Victor sat next to him.
"You'll be assigned a therapist," The officer said.
Sherlock snapped his head around and growled lowly with an intense scowl on his face. John's eyes widened and Sherlock glanced down at John's hand, then back up at his face, then at his bottle of ink in dangerous warning. He turned back to face front to be looking directly at the deep grimace of one Severus Snape.
"Oh, no! Well, I guess I should totally stop my entire day's plans to go turn myself in for possession," William said sarcastically as he blew out the smoke into John's face.
As John read, his smile dropped quickly. They were taking him from Hogwarts?! It wasn't even Christmas yet. John felt his body often with anxiety and he really hoped it wasn't actually going to happen. Just because his mum was worried, doesn't mean she should subject him to even more worrisome conditions at home...! What about his classes, his grades? What Did she know that they were going to be indicted to Wizengamot in the spring? Did she even consult Dumbledore on this matter, and if so, he allowed it?! What about Sherlock!?
John wrote the rest of his insipid blog post, and people commented and came up with their mad, somehow half-correct accusations about John's sexuality. Honestly, John had no idea who he was. He loved William for half of his life, however, John's made himself quite convinced that he could learn to love this 'Sherlock,' fellow almost as much. If only the man swung that way, John thought. John looked at his mobile and saw the time. He figured that it was time to go to bed.
"I-I mean, yeah. She'll be okay in like, an hour, so..." John flashed a smile up at Sherlock, who offered to study with him later.
"I had absolutely no idea!" John shouted, his brain ceased to work, it seemed.
"Okay, I'm ready, but we can't stay long, I want to be there for the first day of hell week in Raider's," John said, smiling. Sebastian bid his roommate goodbye as he went to the back for a shower. "C'mon, let's go," John said, brushing past William as he exited his room.
"Because I like you," Victor admitted, making Sherlock go quiet, "and, I like being around you, so... Why not?"
The room fell silent. That wasn't supposed to happen. There was a slam on the table.
"The Case is solved; We now know why you treat everyone around you like dirt," John shouted.
"I look forward to the court case," Sherlock said as he let the police handcuff James from under his body weight. Sherlock stood up and walked over to Lestrade, who held out his hand. Sherlock gave a look to the officer as he sighed and hesitantly shook Lestrade's hand.
"Good to be back" And, so the lesson went on. Snape slipped back into his severe case of solipsism. Sherlock didn't have a notebook, but he could just copy John's notes later, if he'd let him, that was.
John had excused himself after they've exchanged pleasantries and wandered around, hopelessly in search of the mess hall. John had gotten lost quicker than expected. John found someone to ask for help from, however as the young lady was answering, John heard a scuffle behind him. John excused himself to go investigate. Around the corner was a group of students, not that massive, but not leaving any room, either, closing in on a student with pale skin and midnight mood, curly hair. It took John but a moment to register, and the only possibility that didn't seem as ludicrous as before was,
"What's wrong?" John asked, still sitting with his legs crossed. Harold sighed, making John sit forward.
His name was Victor and he was a second year, assigned to get Sherlock to and from all classes from then on. Sherlock looked over at the Gryffindor table, where John sat laughing with others as they shared loud anecdotes of their previous lives. Sherlock looked back at Victor and nodded, "Fine,"
"Don't make fun of me, okay?" Bill said, frowning at his friend, who turned back and motioned for Bill to put the fag in between his lips. John didn't lean in as close as Wiliam when he lit John's first one.
"Holmes," Snape droned in a low voice, "let's see if you're even smart enough to be in Ravenclaw," he said menacingly, looking over him, though he didn't show he was still very raw over what happened. Sherlock sat down in the rows and opened his book, dipping his quill in the ink bottle, preparing himself for whatever was to come.
"After moving here, it was very difficult for me to get started with a history like mine," The old woman said sweetly.
The two went to the office and John quickly copied at least half of the addresses down before Sherlock and he began to change back. John was happy to be back in his regular skin. He couldn't imagine having to live with breasts...! Especially ones as bi--
"Don't worry, Sherlock," Victor said with a smile warmer than anything Sherlock'd seen in a while as he placed his hand on Sherlock's, "I'll help you through this if you'd like. Y'know, support? Go, team!" Victor chuckled with Sherlock.
"Shit!" John cursed, sucking his teeth, "I need to go back for something," he breathed, looking up apologetically. Sherlock nodded,
"John, upon recent events which had been brought to my attention, I want you to come home," she said lightly as her face turned serious. This is it, John thought, if I have a chance, if any, to really stand up for myself, it had to be now...!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Wow, that's quite a name," John chuckled as his eyebrows went up in amusement.
"It's too dangerous to try and pick him up because we have no idea what the state of his neck is right now," John explained, tugging the shoulders of his shirt to slowly pull him onto the jacket. Sherlock wretched up another two slugs. "If we move him the wrong way, it might damage him more so; I only turned his head so he didn't choke on the thick slime of the slugs' discharge,"
"I don't know w-what to do," Sherlock timidly chuckled, feeling very bashful, "I mean, this is... A date, right?" He looked up, his face wouldn't stop flushing...!
"You want one?" William asked, nudging John's arm, "Nicotine free," William smiled as John looked over, confused. William took out a cigarette carton and opened it to pluck two hand-rolled cigarettes.
"Really?"
"Yeah, I sure got it handed to me after," John continued.
"Sherlock," The young man said, shaking the older man's hand, but he sat down, refusing to shake the other young man's hand. The other looked a bit cross about it. "Do forgive me. I don't shake with interns," Sherlock said with an amused smile.
"What're you gonna do, Capt'n?" She questioned sarcastically with a bitter scoff before she took another sip and muttered into the cup, "shoot me?"
"Alright, then," Sherlock managed as they calmed from their fit, "what would you pick, then?" he asked. Victor wiped a tear of joy from his eye.
"I believe you, John," Murray said with a convinced smile, "I just thought you should know, is all,"
Greg glared at John until he saw who he was sitting next to. "Isn't that that Holmes kid who talked shit on professor Snape to his face?" He asked. John nodded, putting his bag on the ground. John opened it and pulled out his Ukelele. He'd begun tuning it by ear and strumming lightly to test as Jacob questioned the nonchalance of John's response.
As Sherlock was walking out of Bart's, He saw Mike seeing John off. John walked away, waving once more. Sherlock quickly and quietly peered around the corner and loudly hissed Mike's name. The man turned around. Sherlock beckoned him whilst keeping his eyes on John.
Sherlock dragged his feet to charms class with professor Flitwick, the head of Ravenclaw, who saw Sherlock enter and smiled from atop a tall stack of books.
"Then, what's so complex about it?" Mr Holmes asked, smiling.
"Who was the first?"
"I'm John Watson,"
"Watson!" He heard someone shout. John turned around to catch a gun, which Mike tossed towards him.
"Hey, did you see the news?" He asked, sounding nervously excited. John shook his head as he hadn't gotten the chance to check the telly yet today. Nonetheless, Mike showed John his mobile and they watched some breaking news segment where some houses in central London had been destroyed by a violent dark entity. John's face paled. He didn't know exactly what it was, but he knew it wasn't something that the muggle public should see...! John had no magical recourses, so he couldn't exactly look up what this date force really was, but he had a feeling that it wasn't a good thing.
After a few moments, Victor pulled back and smirked widely at his friend. "Good night, Sherlock," Victor said as he took in a large breath.
Potions was first, which Victor walked Sherlock too. They hugged at the door. Strong yet gentle, that's how he'd describe it. Snape scoffed at the reappearance of Sherlock in his class, the class went fast and it was very boring.
"It's fine," He said, getting his heart rate under control, "It's fine, yeah," He repeated.
He barged into the first-years' dorm and plopped onto his bed, harshly drawing the blue and grey curtains around so he could have some kind of privacy. He'd read his book until it was time for supper.
A few days before the Christmas holiday and Sherlock was wondering what John would be doing for festivities. Sherlock would be staying at Hogwarts, mostly alone. Most of the Ravenclaw students were heading to their homes, but they weren't defying a hundred --or so-- year genetic legacy, so Sherlock had that rooting against him. Mycroft was going home, leaving hii brother to suffer i silence for mor thhan one reason.
"Came to return the car, silly," Sherlock said, uncharacteristically as he let out another brief laugh to himself. "That, and to see if brother mine was okay. Oh, and Greg was talking to me about the case," He explained, "Miss me already?" He flirted with a supposed wink from the other side.
John could hear the smirk in Sherlock's voice as he snatched his pair of red and white pants from the man's hand, which he squeezed in through the crack of the door. "Although, I'd love to see the flustered look on your face as you buy a pack of the five-pound brand from a store," Sherlock's low voice purred, sending shivers up John's spine.
"Becuase I know that you didn't mean it," William said, placing a hand on John's shoulder.
"Y-you're Jossy?" John quietly gasped, and suddenly he felt stupid. The girl turned around, eyebrows furrowed in slight confusion. Still, she gave a smile.
William and John were friends again, just not as close as they were when they first met. However, they'd learned to grow even stronger and closer within the past half a semester, smoking blunts in fag tubes and getting high under the bleachers as to celebrate on different occasions. Then, they'd just sit and talk as they'd snack on different food items they'd sneak from the cafe of the school. They had their setups and they knew how to do it right.
"You have textbooks; look ahead," Sherlock sharply quipped, "Second, your notes are rubbish," He flatly said, sighing as he himself flipped through the notes. He silently told Mary to wait with a hand to the air and magically summoned his own bag, filled with books and notes. Sherlock opened the bag and dug his arms through in search of his own Potions books. Once he found them, Sherlock pulled them up and laid them onto the coffee table in between the two.
"This isn't new!!" John yelled, growing more and more frustrated by the very second, "And, it sure as hell isn't preferred!" John abruptly stood up and stormed out of the office. He needed to destroy something and quick!
"Do you know where you are?" She asked. Sherlock nodded,
John practically collapsed onto his bed and fell asleep not too long after, but his dreams left his mind more than restless as it showed him images of what would've, could've happened if John hadn't gotten there when he had.
"Well, I'm certainly not trying to do that," William laughed as he hit again.
Sherlock woke up the next morning, ready to start the day off on the right foot. He'd go to breakfast, see if John had realised how stupid his question was, hang out with him, do some more questioning, and gather all the information they needed. However, things didn't really go as planned. Sherlock headed down to breakfast and was giddy with excitement as he thought of going to class with John, but John must've slept in because he wasn't in the Great Hall when Sherlock arrived fresh from his morning physical therapy session. Madam Pomfrey had declared Sherlock's legs were strong enough for only one crutch to be used, which was definite progress. Sherlock couldn't wait to tell John, who'd surely be proud of him for working so hard toward rehabilitation.
While William was sitting at the table, drinking with his father as his mum was cooking dinner, he was pulled from thinking about John by his father's chipper voice.
"Better than a pillow, eh, Harry?" Sherlock lowly hissed as he quietly snuck up behind the fourth-year Ravenclaw, who jumped, startled by the sudden noise. Sherlock pulled out a chair next to the older boy. Sherlock sat down and gazed at who the boy was staring at and sighed, sounding content, "Does his voice really sound as smooth and soft as the girls say?" Sherlock looked over at Harry with raised eyebrows. Harry furrowed his brows in feigned confusion.
"Then, I'm going, too," said John climbing to the same step Sherlock waited on. They stood side-by-side, John holding onto the railing, only occasionally glancing over at Sherlock.
"Shit..!" John shouted, facepalming. John had no idea if Sherlock was clean of STD's. He was a bloody drug addict, for Christ's sake; he could've taken a bad needle or slept with a bloody butter-face...! "Oh, God!" He repeated. John decided on wiping up the countertop with a paper towel, putting on his filthy trousers, and escaping, locking the door on the way out. Sherlock was gone in Mycroft's car. John sighed in relief. He would loathe to see him again so soon after... whatever the hell that was!
John zoned out, thinking of William as he was looking at his bloodied hands again.
"I didn't know, so don't bother with that impossibly predictable question." He dismissed, and he rolled his eyes as John opened his mouth, unable to speak as he was expecting death.
"Probably," John muttered. Jacob sighed. "John, I know you probably don't want the friend to get into trouble, but he's most likely in danger if he's in the Forbidden Forest." He said only making John's worry grow, "what is his name?"
"John," Sherlock said with a smile on his lips. He looked plenty more charming than before. Sherlock had the urge to run into the boy's arms. What a strange urge that was. John just stood and looked,
Upon arriving home, John quickly made for his room and practically locked himself in, reading and eating until he fell asleep, wrappers and crumbs on his bedspread as John's face cutely slept over top.
The next morning, Sherlock felt giddy with excitement. He woke up extra early and snuck himself to the common room with a few hundred Galleons and a bag of Flew powder. Sherlock climbed into the unlit hearth of the common room and called to his destination, "221b Baker Street!" Sherlock threw the powder down and erupted into a flame of blue.
"It doesn't matter what I think, John; It matters what you can prove in court," William said.
"Hold on, why can't Carter handle the infamous two?" Lionel questioned, clearly not wanting to have to do that much work for himself,
"Hello," She asked. "Oh, uh," John must've got the addresses mixed up, but the woman who stood at the door was plenty attractive,
When the holiday started, Sherlock was convinced that he'd be fine. It was better for him to be alone, anyway. He could actually get some studying done. Sherlock overheard Harry and John Reese talking in the back of the library on the first day of the holiday. He decided to approach them.
"Hey," John said softly, placing a gentle hand onto his shoulder. Sherlock looked over at John with a weak, forced smile. "It's okay, you know, to be a little different,"  John reassured with a smile as his eyebrow lifted some.
"Here," He heard above him.
"I didn't ask you what you call it; I'm asking what it actually is," John clarified, and William narrowed his eyes.
"Are you okay?" He asked, sitting down and placing the tray on the table in front of him.
"Holmes, you've been summoned to the Hospital wing," Snape said as he waved the note which was sent. Sherlock gathered his things and stood. John grabbed Sherlock's arm to stop him momentarily.
"How is he?" Flitwick asked,
"An hour and a half. Then, I'll need a shower when I get back, so make it about two hours." John said, pulling his shirt down to ensure he wasn't stomach-flashing William, once again feeling a bit insecure about his weight.
"I thought it was Irene's dorm! Honest-to-God, mate!" John shouted, He was set on campus arrest and was issued for a detention every day for the remainder of that week. John was put out of the Dean's office before he could figure out what happened to Irene.
"Excuses are the nails, sir," Sherlock sneered and stormed off it the halls without staying to hear that Snape had taken fifteen points from Ravenclaw, but only five from his own house, despite the source of the entire problem being an arrogant first-year,
"Uh, I sort of don't know how...?" John said. Irene quickly sat up.
'He's a stalker,' 'He's going to kill me,' and 'Did I know him in a past life, maybe?' His thoughts were going wild. So wild and fleeting, in fact, that he hadn't realised that the teenager had sat down across from him until he cleared his throat once more, pulling John from his panicking daze.
"How close are their rooms?" John asked, sighing. "I don't feel like running all across hotels to catch a possible perpetrator, and I know that you don't like doing my job," John smiled.
"I have with me," Sherlock groaned as he hopped down with a little bag, similar to John's musical coin pouch, and looked down at it as he sat on the seat heavily. He pulled out a paper and unfolded it to read the numbers. "A lot more than you at the moment, however, I'd wager seventy-five Galleons and eighty Sickles that you'll go into Hufflepuff,"
"Isn't that, like.... Forbidden?" He asked with an unsure chuckle.

"I didn't know they still existed," Sherlock's eyebrows furrowed. The two boys looked at Sherlock, obviously confused, glancing back at each other for a moment. "There were-are these creatures called Obscuruses," Sherlock began, "They're a dark entity that stirs in young Mud-bloods who are trying to avoid persecution. Too young to attend Hogwarts and sheltered by family, they build up this dark entity with their power until something triggers it, then they let it go. Most Obscurials don't even know it," Sherlock elaborated, leaning in for the boys to hear. "The last one recorded was in the '60s," Sherlock leaned back with a shrug, "And, the kids themselves don't tend to last long; the longest living Obscurial survived until they were 25 in 1946, only because The Nazi's were using him for his power, of course," he gave. Reese's eyebrow bounced up in almost astonishment.
"Doctor Jacobson's office?" Sherlock mused, letting his eyebrows arch on curiosity. "Thank you," he said, straightening himself up, "come, love," Sherlock gave a small smile to John, who joined him, arm-in-arm for the support as they walked down the hall. Sherlock leaned in to whisper in John's ear, "turn back and wink at him," he said, "that's what Mum does,"
"I still don't get it!" He groaned.
"I thought you were," William blinked, half-surprised, "Irene sexually abused you, right?" He asked.
"Alright, let's find you an empty cabin, then," He said. His voice was smooth and comforting, but also as if he could turn it into a commanding yell in only but a second. John didn't want that...! John was quiet as they walked down some cars' aisleways, peeking in to see if it were overcrowded or not. All of them so far were filled with kids who were somehow already acquainted with one another, making John anxiously assume he'd missed something before the beginning of the year.
"What are you talking about?" Bill asked, flicking an ash to the ground.
They walked and Jacob told the other perfects where he was going so he wouldn't be discounted for. It was infinitely quieter away from the crowd and Jacob stopped and gave a gentle elbow to John's side, telling him to pay attention.
"I said, 'Hmm?' What is so important?" John said, slightly irritated at William's constant attempts at gaining his attention.
"Is it bad that I miss John so much?" Sherlock asked as they left the tent and Victor used the cleaning spell to fold the blankets and pile them next to the door. Victor shrugged,
"You know, Sherlock. I've been doing research. It turns out it's not that hard to get ahold of a simple record," He said, dropping the book to the bed, holding the one thing that always held Sherlock back, "Multiple charges of possession of drugs, drug paraphernalia, public indecency under the influences, and what's this? A charge upon multiple occurrences of sexual abuse as a minor?" Sebastian teased, smirking as he waved it in Sherlock's face, which wore a face of terror.
"Speaking of, how is he?" John asked, smiling slightly with unrealistic anticipation of him being awake and sitting up, but as John pushed open the curtain, he saw that the boy was asleep. John tightened his lips. He supposed seizures did take a lot of energy out of a person. He'd need all the rest he could get. John sat down next to him and looked at his pale face. He was still sweating, meaning he probably still had a fever. John placed his hand on Sherlock's arm and watched the boy breathe. His eyebrows furrowed and his lips were slightly parted. John couldn't imagine the amount of pain he must've been in,
