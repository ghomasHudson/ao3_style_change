He must have been zoning out because he hadn’t noticed Toni place a now sleeping Peter on the opposite couch. He didn’t even notice her slip behind him to wrap her arms around him. Despite his inattention, Bruce didn’t flinch or tense at her touch. Poor girl could never appear threatening to him even if she tried.
Because of all this, they stayed. They stayed because Maria had no resources of her own anymore. Everything was in Howard’s name. She and her daughter had nowhere to go.
“I know.” He ducked his head down to kiss her hands anyway. His thumb swept over the back of hers in gentle arcs, subconsciously copying something his own mother had done for him so long ago. He wanted Toni to stay. Her and her boy. Bruce cared for Toni in a way he never cared for anyone else before. It was nothing as cheap as sexual attraction, nor as sentimental and foolish as romantic love. Maybe he saw too much of his mother in her. Or maybe Bruce wanted to protect that which he found truly beautiful.
“You’re not my Mom, Natasha.” The girl’s voice was harder, almost cold. “I don’t need you to take care of me.”
Maria pressed a kiss to the girl’s forehead. It was as much as gesture of comfort as it was an attempt to compose herself. Her daughter was too young to bear this weight, but if she was going to survive and more importantly, thrive, than she’d have to learn.
It had been a month. Maybe a few days over a month. Bruce wasn’t particularly counting. He tracked the days by Toni’s progress. Her bruises faded and she wasn’t limping anymore. Whatever baby weight she’d gained was gone, though given her size before the pregnancy, Bruce doubted she’d gained much at all. In fact, under his roof he’d been supervising a nutritional plan. Toni’s insistence on working out aside (and Bruce never liked thinking about the why behind her insistence), it was clear she wasn’t getting everything she needed at Steve’s.
Bruce waited, keeping an eye of Steve the entire time. The Captain made no move to stop them from leaving. As Bruce turned to go, he piped up.
“Maybe,” Bruce shrugged and adjusted his glasses. “But until you can do the bare minimum amount of care required, they won’t be staying with you.”
Toni didn’t sound good. In fact, she sounded exhausted. Her voice was raspy and weak. Without warning, Natasha opened the door and stepped into the room.
So if she was really sick, why didn’t Steve have Bruce at her side all hours of the day? Why hadn’t he pressed her to go to an actual, fully licensed doctor for a checkup to see if she was actually pregnant? Having a family currently (apparently) meant everything to him. A legacy, he called it. Steve took risks, but they were always calculated. He wasn’t an idiot.
Toni gnawed on her bottom lip in yet another bad habit Howard hated. “No Mama, I mean...can we leave...here? Go somewhere else? Without Daddy.” Her voiced dropped at the end to a near whisper.
Natasha hadn’t heard from Toni in days. When she asked Steve about her, he’d only said she was sick. It was the same excuse; Every. Single. Time. She had enough. Part of her began to think that Steve had finally snapped and killed the poor girl. But wouldn’t that be better in some ways? The child (because that’s what she was, and Natasha refused to let herself forget that) would finally be free of all this. If there was paradise beyond the mortal plane, Toni Rogers definitely deserved it.
Steve, however, didn’t seem to have the same concern. His face twisted into annoyance and confusion, “Nat, what the hell—?”
“You’re the strongest out of all of us.” Natasha truly believed that. “And you’re gonna outlast us all.”
Toni looked down, her fingers knotting together, fidgeting, Howard always called it. “Can...Can we leave?”
Bruce stood, then stomped on his ankle to shut him up. It worked well enough to wipe the smarmy look off his face.
The first door her came to on the second floor was the nursery. Toni and the Barton brothers had done a really nice job with the room. Steve had even pitched in, caught in a good mood one day and wanting to show his artistic side once more. Three of the four walls were a royal blue. The accent wall, which Peter’s bed was pressed against, had an outline of the city skyline in black against a deep red wall. Bruce had his doubts when Toni first told him the idea but the room did turn out nice. Especially after it was filled with the dark wood furniture.
Just as the nursery door clicked shut, the sound of shuffling caught his attention. His mouth opened to speak, but another sound gave him pause. A sound he knew all too well. That sound spurred him into long, purposeful stride toward the bedroom at the end of the hall. Without thought or warning Bruce threw open the door. What he saw made him snap.
If Tony hadn't known any better, it would've almost sounded as though Steve was giving up, but Tony knew he would never do that. Especially not against HYDRA.
Tony gave an almost imperceptible flinch, prompting Steve to squeeze his shoulder. "Thank you, Mr Stacy," he said in his Captain's voice. "We appreciate that very much."
"Go ahead and cancel Beck's computer codes too, J," said Tony. "And I also want a compiled file of every project he's had his nose in for the entire time he's been with Stark Industries."
"So then we have some time," Steve said. He pressed his lips to Tony's in a firm kiss, nipping gently at his lips as Tony let out a soft whimper. "C'mon, sweetheart. Come and take a shower with me, and…" He left the rest of his statement unsaid as he hoisted Tony into his arms, ignoring the throbbing pain in his knuckles as they headed for the elevator, but he knew Tony knew what he meant anyway.
"Really?" Peter exclaimed, his eyebrows shooting up so high that they disappeared under his hair. "Oh, that'd be awesome, Papa! I'll go pack up my stuff!"
Steve's heart lurched as T'Challa called out a command to his warriors, all of whom instantly stood at attention. Then he stepped forward three steps, planting his feet as Steve joined him, shield at the ready.
"It's all right," Steve said gently. He chugged down the rest of his water, attempting to wash down the taste of bile in the back of his throat. "Can you tell me what this is now?"
Painfully hoisting himself out of the water, Steve reaches for his towel, pointedly ignoring looking over at Shostakov as he preens for the crowd.  As he drapes the towel across his neck, he wishes he didn't have the reputation of being such a good sport.  That way he could have an excuse for simply walking past Shostakov and a whooping and yelling Bucky Barnes, and no one would think twice about it.
Strange practically sneered, only raising Tony's blood pressure more. "If we weren't moving at approximately two hundred times the speed of light, then yes, I could. But the amount of force required to connect the portal is too high to maintain it long enough to safely make it through."
"Oh Christ, Steve, you know that I do," he said instead, burrowing even further into Steve's embrace. "But you also know that you don't have to go through the whole literal song and dance to show me, right?"
Steve breathed in, shaking his head. Phillips had always granted him a bit of leeway since he'd been so close with Steve's father, and Steve knew better than to push too hard against that, but…
Which was just their way of saying that they had no interest in peace at all. Only undeniable victory.
"Captains Wilson and Barnes offered to drive me home, Captain," said Sharon. "I'll stop by in the morning to check on Peter before my shift at the hospital, okay?"
Reaching behind him to his bedside table, Tony grabbed one of the wintergreen mints he kept there, popping it into his mouth as he studied Steve's beautiful face. His sleep was a peaceful one, his forehead and eyes free of the worry lines that had marred them for so long, his jawline relaxed and supple, and his chest slowly rising and falling with evenly measured breaths. Leaning down, Tony pressed a soft kiss to each of his cheeks first, then to his forehead between his eyes, his nose, and finally his chin, dipping underneath to find that sweet spot just below Steve's jawline that never failed to make him shudder.
"Eh, I don't think so," Steve said as he nuzzled Tony's temple. "If you know, there's really no sense in waiting. Is there?"
"Mmm," Tony muttered under his breath. He bit back his retort that parts of New York were still trying to dig out from under all of the Chitauri junk, including some areas not too far from the Tower, but since the Triskelion was in D.C. it therefore had to have priority.
"Happy New Year to you, sir," answered JARVIS. "I do hope that you enjoyed the festivities? This area is quite well-known for its fireworks display."
"I'm sure JARVIS wouldn't bother us if it wasn't really important, sweetheart," Steve said as he pushed himself up to his knees, reaching for Tony's tablet resting on the bedside table.
“Oh, get off it, Obie!” Tony retorted.  “You know damn well that Pete’s not just any kid.  He’s the heir to this whole goddamn company, which means—”
from behind the truck caused Peter to jump, and he scrambled to open the door, practically diving into the backseat. He was tired enough now that even with his glasses and earplugs, his senses were quickly approaching overload.
hour, when he'd felt as though he had truly been abandoned by those he loved most, had been the point of rock-bottom. The point where not even he could dare to find even the slightest whisper of hope.
Which meant that they didn't lose. Not against the Chitauri, not against Obie and that mad hatter Aldrich Killian.
Because while Dad was probably right that they wouldn't kill Papa, Peter had no doubt that HYDRA was pissed off enough at him that they would do everything in their power to try and break him.
Without a second's hesitation, Thor grinned widely and raised his axe to the sky, summoning enough lightning to power the entire Compound for a month before channelling it directly into the nanite case. Tony stumbled as the billions of nanites that comprised his suit absorbed the intense electrical energy, the hair on the back of his neck standing on end as he struggled to stay upright.
"Woohoo!" Peter yelped. "We're gonna go skiing!" He threw his arms around Steve's neck, nearly knocking him backwards. "Thank you, Papa! This is gonna be so awesome!"
Peter thought, biting back his frustrated groan. He and Dad had just had an entire conversation about this very thing the night before, when Dad was tucking Peter into bed. Papa had asked him to sleep apart since it was the night before their wedding, apparently because it was some old tradition or something that Grandma had mentioned. And while Dad had agreed to it, Peter knew it had thrown him a bit more than he'd wanted to let on.
"And you are correct, the Air Corps hasn't yet developed any sort of rocket fuel. The propulsion system for the space flight engine is of a completely new design, and one that I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge at the moment."
"Oh yeah. Loads of people. We've got the same eyes, the same hair, the same nose and mouth." He held out his hands, inspecting his fingers. "We've even got the same hands. And Papa says that we make a lot of the same faces too."
Apparently Thor wasn't dead after all. Not unless dead Norse gods could still travel by light beams and catch axes almost as tall as Peter.
"I am unsure, sir. At best guess I would say the earliest would be in approximately twenty-four hours, perhaps more. I am of course working as fast as I can, but I don't believe I have to remind you that this has to be done very carefully if there is to be any data left that's worth examining."
Narrowing his eyes, Peter watched as Dr Strange clapped his forearms together, generating his sparkling golden shields. "I think you'll find our will equal to yours!"
And the distant voice of Peggy Carter, ensuring him that they would look for him, that they would find him.
"All right, J, looks like we're good to go," he said as he trailed his finger along the outline of Steve's dog tags through his shirt. At Steve's request, or more like down-on-his-knees begging, Tony had stopped wearing his nanite case on his chest while inside the house, resorting instead to carrying it around in his pocket. He supposed that wearing it to bed had maybe—
"Oh God," Tony rasped as he slumped against Steve, his hands fisting into Steve's shirt. "Honey, what—what're we doing? We gotta—we've gotta—"
"Well, Papa's a pretty smart guy, you know," Dad muttered. He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "Look, buddy, I'm sorry. I don't mean to get short with you, I'm just—"
"Okay, little guy," Steve murmured, hugging his son as tightly as he dared. "It's gonna be okay, I promise."
"So the plan is that you'll go home with Gwen and her father unless you hear otherwise from me, okay, bud?" Dad said as Peter unbuckled his seatbelt. "And then Papa and I will pick you up from their house as soon as we get back from upstate."
"Uh, the Colonel Uncle James," Peter said, cringing as the song changed to one with a particularly strong bass beat. He gritted his teeth, forcing himself to try and ignore it as Ned got the game board set up.
“You almost forgot this, buddy,” Tony said with a chuckle.  “Kinda hard to do your homework when your homework’s not at home, right?”
"I wish—I wish I could agree with you, Nat, but I just can't," Steve murmured. He dropped his head, blinking more fat tears from his eyes. "I just can't take the chance that we'd lose again. I've… I've already lost enough."
Tony didn't only love Steve with all of his heart and soul and everything else he had in him, he felt
look on his face that Tony might have laughed if he hadn't been so thoroughly spooked. But at the moment, the only thought racing through Tony's mind was now that he had determined that Steve was fine, he had to get to Peter.
"You've had that damn worry wrinkle of yours stuck between your eyebrows for almost the entire day, and yet—"
"Well, I think you might be a bit biased," Steve said, the dimple on his right cheek making an appearance as he smiled. Tony was such a sucker for that dimple. If he'd’ve been a poet he would've written sonnets for that dimple. "But I'll admit I wouldn't mind getting to see that art collection sometime."
"Shouldn't be so… what, anxious?" asked Sam. "Why not? You think you're the first person who's told me stuff like this?"
"And you didn't call or text me to bring them to you… why?" Papa gently asked. "You know I don't mind doing that stuff for you."
And it really could not have come at a better time. For as much as Steve's confidence had been padded by his teammates' optimism, he knew that what they would be facing as soon as they entered that quantum tunnel would be the most difficult challenge they had ever faced.
"I thought—I thought that I could stop them," he said softly, his eyes trained on his feet poking out of his blankets. "You guys have been so twitchy about everything lately with all the government stuff and everything else, and when I heard what was gonna happen, I just thought—" He paused, turning to look Tony straight in the eye. "I just wanted to be like you. Like you and Papa."
"Not that I know of," said Gwen. "I mean, I'm sure one could come through without people knowing, but don't we usually hear about it if they're expecting one?"
Dr Strange tilted his head, glaring at Dad so harshly that if looks could kill, he would've been splattered across the control panels.
"I do very much apologise for the very untimely interruption, sir," JARVIS suddenly cut in. "But there is a new memo coming in from the Department of Damage Control, and it is marked with extreme urgency."
“I've got you, honey, okay?  You're okay.  I’m here,” Tony added as he sent Steve’s tie flying to land on the jacket, quickly going to work on his shirt buttons.  “It’s okay, Steve.  It’s gonna be okay.  I
"Oh, Pete's a master tree climber," said Tony. "You might wanna be careful though. It's been so long since he's been able to play outside that we might have our hands full trying to get him back in the house at the end of the day. You have not seen Pete's puppy-dog eyes to the fullest extent of their
"Rogers is as good as they come, Tony," Phillips said once he'd calmed down enough to speak. "Congratulations."
"I know, but what if I want to?" Steve asked, rather cheekily. His chin came to rest in the dip of Tony's hipbone, his beautiful face flushed and eager. "What if I want to make my husband feel good? What if I want to show my husband that he's the most beautiful man in the entire world?"
"Well, if we're being petty now, then I don't like it when you refuse to admit what everyone already knows because you think it'll make you look weak."
Steve's voice was laced with guilt, so deep and heavy that Tony had to briefly look away. How in the hell could he possibly think that any of what had happened was his fault?
Tony shrugged, not meeting his son’s eyes.  “Eh, not too late.”  It technically wasn’t a lie.  Since he never even made it to bed and it was already after seven in the morning, that meant the term “late” no longer applied.
"Ah. And I'm guessing that one of those perks was someone who you were supposed to marry?" Peter asked. "Someone who your father considered proper?"
Steve smiled, flashing the dimple that never failed to get Tony weak in the knees. "Well, I have to admit that I'm a bit partial to it myself," he said, planting a kiss on Tony's temple before placing his hand on Peter's shoulder. "Hey, little guy. You feel like doing a quick fishing trip before dinner?"
It took Peter a moment for her statement to sink in. Peter was not at all used to hearing the top Langaran government official addressed by his first name.
"Um… could you please text Gwen in about ten minutes and tell her that I'm really sorry, but that my dads called and I had to leave early? And also arrange for Betty to give Ned a ride home? I'm pretty sure that she drove here herself, so it should be okay."
"At least their colours are better," Tony had grumbled, swiftly changing his tune when he returned to his office to find Rhodey sitting at his desk in front of a full plate of food—including two of the chocolate chip muffins that Tony loved—and not one but
He'd come by this foul mood honestly, and he was going to savor it. If Steve wanted to get him out of it, he was going to have to work for it.
"Hm? Oh, yeah, you might be right." He was definitely right. Steve didn't have anything to clean himself up with; he wiped his hand as best he could on his underwear and the inside hem of his shirt, but he didn't want to have to walk around like this for long.
It seemed like the wrong moment for anything resembling an emotional declaration, but maybe that would make it easier for Tony to ignore, if that was what he wanted.
Steve made himself take slow, deep breaths until he thought he could get his voice under control. "Selfish how?" He couldn't think of anything less selfish than Tony wanting to give Steve everything he wanted.
"At least I'm alive," Tony argued. "How many times have you been willing to risk almost certain death because it was the right thing to do? If you can't remember, I could probably make you a list."
The STRIKE team had heard what had happened--Rumlow claimed to have an alert set up for news about him, "because you never know, it might affect the team"--and Steve got more than the usual ribbing from them about the whole thing with Tony.
"No need. The driver texted all of us, and unlike you, they check their phones." He pushed his chair back from the table and stood up.
It was a good answer, and Steve felt like, if this had been a real relationship, it would have been a true one. Steve didn't like the thought of having a marriage that might not exist if a mission took them to the wrong state. Leaving the country would still always possibly be an issue, but at the very least, they should be able to trust that their marriage would be valid everywhere in the nation.
But Steve came from a time where--well, of course people talked about sex, but in Steve's experience, at least, that had mostly been jokes and boasting. He didn't know what to say, or how to say it. If Tony were here, Steve would have been able to show Tony how he felt without words, which he'd definitely prefer.
"That was what I was hoping," Steve admitted, "but I have to admit that I'm not sure what to say now."
The sheets on Steve's bed were softer than any he'd slept on in his life--except before the team had broken up, when they'd all lived in Avengers Mansion--but no matter how high the thread count, they were plain cotton: white, light blue, and one unfortunate lavender pillowcase from a week when Thor had drawn laundry duty.
"Glad you recognize that," Tony said. "And same here, but this isn't so bad either. Probably a good thing, considering how many times we're on opposite sides of the planet."
"Yeah," Tony said. "Just for the online version, I think. But, you know, pretty standard stuff. I told them the same thing we're telling everyone else: Steve and I broke up, it was a mutual decision, nobody did anything wrong, we just decided that it wasn't working for us." He smiled sharply again. "I might have added that it meant that I'm single and willing to let the right man, woman, or person of any other gender heal my broken heart."
"Yeah?" Steve wrapped his hand around his cock, stroking himself slowly until he was fully erect. "I like the thought of looking at you, too." Then, deciding he couldn't let Tony be the one to take
It didn't necessarily mean anything. Maybe he wanted to talk to Nat. Maybe he just got tired of sitting next to the same person.
"You know," Tony said, looking up with a smile, "if this crime-fighting thing doesn't work out for you, you're a natural at waiting tables."
That was fine; that was what Steve would have expected if he'd really been dating Tony. Sometimes--probably a lot of the time--work was going to take priority. Steve tended to do that too, so he couldn't complain.
Tony shrugged. "I don't know how. He came in, said he wanted to talk about last night, I apologized and told him that I'd appreciate it if we pretended it never happened, and..."
"My way involves a bed," Steve said, bending down so that he could speak directly into Tony's ear. "Probably your bed. I bet your sheets are nicer."
Steve looked down into Tony's eyes and blinked suddenly, before his mouth curved into a soft smile that Tony didn't think he'd ever seen directed at himself before. "
"It was intended for 'people,'" Tony agreed. "Not necessarily humans. We're not on Earth." At least not theirs. That portal could have sent them to another planet, but it could just as easily have sent them through to another dimension. "There's no saying the people here even need light to see. Or that they see at all."
felt like home. He always had, even when they'd been so angry at one another that they barely spoke.
If it were just a case of distracting him, Tony probably wouldn’t have wanted backup, but he’s also going to try to plant a bug on him, to find out who he calls when he discovers his stolen tech is gone, and that could get messy.
Tony recognized that attitude; he'd seen it in a lot of students over the years. That was "I actually have my license
"It is totally the biceps," he agreed, "and thanks for confirming that you're definitely not straight."
Steve didn't say anything at first, just set his coffee cup down on Tony's nightstand. Then he took a deep breath, and Tony braced himself for an inspiring lecture about personal accountability and responsible drinking.
She smiled warmly at him. "A lot has changed since I was a kid, even," she said. "And a lot more will change by the time the kids today are our age. But it's going to take a lot of work, and I'm glad you've decided to help us with it."
He couldn't see what it was doing. He didn't want to, any more than he wanted to look Tony in the eye.
Tony would make a few appearances with a gorgeous woman on his arm, Steve would make a few appearances alone, since the thought of finding his own gorgeous person to take to events wasn't all that appealing, and everyone would stop talking about them eventually.
It definitely couldn't hurt, Steve thought, because that was the first time he'd heard of that particular program. That could just be because he didn't know everything about Tony's company, but he suspected that grant didn't exist, though it would by tomorrow morning.
He was still having a little trouble adjusting to the idea that pictures winding up on the internet would be a good thing. He knew it was--this didn't work unless people were talking about them, after all--but he imagined it was weird for Tony, too, considering that he'd complained about the paparazzi when he and Pepper were together.
Given how much he was tempted to make a practical, hands-on demonstration of how he felt about Steve when he was sober, the thought of what he might have done when he was blackout drunk was honestly a little terrifying.
Of course, with Tony involved, there was always the chance that Tony would get distracted by something and go running off to his lab because he wouldn't be able to relax until he worked out this idea that he'd had. But Steve could follow him, and sketch him while he worked, and then convince Tony that science went better with the occasional break for something other than coffee.
Steve takes a couple of deep breaths and reminds himself that one, he’s not a jealous man; two, he doesn’t own Tony; and three, this is a mission, and this is why Tony is the one doing the distracting.
A bonus was that it was a formal event, and that meant that he got to see Tony in a tux. He liked Tony in business suits, and in the Iron Man armor, and in t-shirts and jeans. But Tony in a tux was something to be savored.
"Look at her tonight," Tony said, gesturing toward the other side of the room, where Natasha and Clint were talking to one of the kids who'd received a scholarship. Probably doing a little recruiting for SHIELD, he thought. They could be just making small talk, but Natasha rarely "just" did anything, especially chat with a high school kid.
"Your generation didn't invent them," Steve said. Granted, Steve's experience with them had been listening to some of the dirty stories the Howlies had swapped, and some older boys' extremely implausible boasting when he was a teenager. But he hadn't been raised in a monastery, and maybe it was time Tony realized that.
No, Steve thought, that was the problem. Steve wasn't the kind of guy who had the kitchen make him something that wasn't on the menu. Steve found places he was comfortable being in that served food he liked, and he went there, and he didn't have three different forks to deal with at one time.
“I love this mission,” he says, as he steers Tony toward the door, and even though he never wants to do this again, it’s still not a lie.
And it didn't seem like they were opposed to the idea of Steve intentionally upsetting people who reminded him, a lot, of the people he'd been fighting back in the forties. They just didn't like this particular plan, because they all thought it was going to end badly somehow.
"A toaster, then," Tony said. Despite the conversation he was holding with JARVIS, he hadn't lost sight of what he'd been doing to Steve; Steve groaned a little and pushed forward against Tony's hand. "No, what I want you to do is to clear my calendar for today. And tomorrow; I think I'm going to need to sleep in. Do the same for Captain Rogers."
"Honey, please!" Tony pleaded, his hand on Steve's shoulder, the only unblemished spot on his body that he could seem to find. "Don't try to move too much, okay? Helen and Bruce are on their way."
when Tony pulled one of his all-nighters, and the last thing Tony needed to see at the moment was the deep-seated disappointment in his son’s doe-brown eyes that he’d allowed Obie to bully him into submission yet again.
"I will, brother!" Steve heard her respond as he slammed his shield into another war dog's head, then immediately curled behind it as James opened fire above him, sending a burst of machine-gun fire pelting onto the ground. A second later Bruce landed next to him, his massive metal fists swinging wildly just as Bucky's rifle was slapped right out of his hands by another war dog, one that then jumped right on top of him.
"Yeah, okay, but I'm just trying to tell you that my father's not really like that," Gwen insisted. "He's just trying to do his job, and… I don't know, I guess he kinda felt threatened by you, is all."
"Well, I guess that's good news," said Clint. "Sure'd be nice if we didn't have to do it like this, though."
“I’m pretty sure you already know the answer to that question,” Fury replied with a severe frown.  “But, like I already said, it doesn't do a damn bit of good to dwell on it now.  We only need to focus on finding Rogers.”
"Goddamnit!" Tony growled as yet another simulation with his new HUD interface dissolved into a mess of pixels in front of his eyes. "JARVIS, we absolutely
"I know, honey," Tony said, as patiently as he could muster. He was actually a lot more rattled by the possibility of unauthorised people getting their hands on HYDRA tech than he was letting on, but Steve was anxious enough for the both of them at the moment and he really didn't feel like adding to it.
"Dad, it's okay. I understand," Peter said into the phone, even as he tried to blink back his tears. He should've guessed that Dad wouldn't've been able to get away early enough to see him before curfew. "It doesn't help anything to get so upset about it."
"You're dismissed for the moment, Scott," said Steve. "We usually all eat dinner together at 1900, so the rest of the day is yours."
Tony told himself over and over as he drove back to the base. Peter was the strongest person Tony had ever seen, and he'd already made it much longer than the doctors had ever imagined. There was no way he'd ever give up on himself now.
"And you know we're gonna have to take the suit away now, right?" Steve added. "We can't have you being tempted to go off by yourself like that again, Peter, we just can't."
Which was perfectly fine with him. He would much rather hold onto his papa's "I've got you" than the rest of the pure hell he and Dad had endured inside that cave, the first level of apparently many to come.
Twenty-eight years of complete control over the country's news outlets, television programming, and literature.
"Yeah, he's fine. Or as fine as he can be, I guess," Tony said with a shrug. "He also pretty much told me exactly what you said this morning, so…"
day, this regular Tuesday afternoon sitting in his physics class directly behind his girlfriend was a walk in the park. Peter shuddered as he recalled the throbbing pain in his head and the severe tightness in his chest that made it hard to breathe, all of which was magnified by the nearly crushing fear that Dad was going to die from some raging infection after his heart surgery.
Peter let out a squeak, his heart hammering against his ribcage as the images of him clinging to his father for dear life flooded his mind. He sucked in a deep, shaky breath, gripping Gwen's hand as tightly as he dared.
Unfortunately, it only took about fifteen minutes or so for most of the plates to empty. Steve's enhanced metabolism notwithstanding, hungry pilots never took very long to eat.
"Yeah, but that's kinda the point, ya know?" said Ned. "We go to Hawaii every summer so we can get out of the busy city. So we can lie around on the beach all day and swim in the ocean and watch the sunsets. But now when they come out here, we're gonna have to show them around and stuff."
"Of course, Captain," replied JARVIS. "Shall I also inform Mr Wilson that you will not be accompanying him for your usual run?"
Steve kept his eyes on Tony's palm as he breathed in and out, slowly and deeply, studying the lines and creases and calluses as he tried to keep a lid on his erupting emotions. His palms were sweating, his heart was thudding madly against his ribcage, and he could feel his panic demon attempting to punch and kick through the mental shields he had set up with Sam's help, trying desperately to break free.
"How can you say that it's no big deal when you can barely breathe and you've completely sweated through your clothes?" Steve asked. "Sweetheart, please, just let me get you checked out! There's no telling what the arc reactor might've done to your lungs, and—"
“You know, Ashes, maybe that building’s not so ugly after all,” Steve murmured into his cat’s fuzzy head, chuckling at the tired
The corners of Tony's lips curled into a smile. "Mmm, long as you don't expect me to just go to sleep."
Hurrying back to the elevator, Peter tapped his foot impatiently as he rode another five floors down to where the stockrooms were housed, waving his Stark Industries ID badge across the electronic lock. The computers were kept in the same area as the rest of the electronics, cell phones, and tablets, and while the regular stock laptops weren't quite as nice and didn't have as much memory as his own that was custom-made, he only needed to add a bit more processing speed to what he already had, so it would hopefully be enough.
"And there's a huge garage for you and Dad to work in, and I even asked Colonel Phillips to set up a mini art studio for us," said Steve. "With some real canvases and paints. How does that sound?"
"Yeah, yeah. Sorry." Tony buried his nose into Steve's neck, breathing in deeply. "Gods, honey, you just smell so damn good. Are you sure we still have to go to this meeting of yours?"
“Okay, buddy, okay.  I get it.  I’m going.”  Pushing himself up to his feet, Tony adjusted the pillows under Peter’s injured hand and patted him on the shoulder.  “I’ll be in the lab.  You let me know if you need anything else, yeah?”
Peter watched as Dad and Papa looked at each other, doing the goofy eyebrow-wiggling thing that they often did.
gonna do is fire off a quick response telling them that I've already started the re-vetting process, and then take another look at these numbers in the morning. And if it turns out that stuff has actually gone missing, then I suppose I'll have to see how the Armed Forces Committee wants to go about looking for it."
"Ohh," Peter whispered as he slid his arms into the hoodie and pulled it over his head, hugging his arms across his front once he was set. How could he have forgotten that he used to swipe these all the time when he was little, and especially whenever Dad was out of town?
Tony's belly gave a swoop as he looked over Peter's head at Steve, his worry wrinkle already on full display. They had avoided the news coverage on purpose while on their trip, but Tony had specifically asked JARVIS to inform them of anything that he presumed to be vital information, and he hadn't said a word about anything the entire week.
"I can sit with Петр, Стив," Bucky said as he entered the lab, followed by another of the security guards. "You just worry about your husband."
This place, this hidden African country, along with its king, just might help tip the odds back into the Avengers' favour.
"Rhodey, Sam, target just below the neck!" Tony called as he dodged yet another repulsor blast, screeching to a halt before launching another missile. "That's the only weak spot I've been able to find, so we gotta exploit it!"
you look like you're ready to take on the world, so… how ‘bout we go get this over with, hmm?  Then we can go grab Pete from school and take it easy the rest of the day.”
"Ready?" Steve asked as he stepped into the kitchen with his shield in hand, where Peter was still stuffing his face with one of the doughnuts Sam and Bucky had bought for him. Bucky's new cat, a pure white thing he'd named Alpine, was apparently a very picky eater, requiring a third trip out to the grocery store in as many days in an attempt to find a cat food that she didn't stick her nose up at. Tony had just about flipped his lid when he first saw Peter attempting to play with the grumpy feline, as he had always detested cats. But after being assured by Sam, Bucky, Peter, and Steve that the cat wouldn't be a problem, he had calmed down a little.
Steve's face fell, but he nodded anyway, knowing it was useless to argue. Instead, he shifted again so he could curl his arm around Tony's shoulders, tucking him against his chest and kissing the top of his head.
And even then, it took Steve three more months before he was finally able to extricate himself from Brock, who had managed to infiltrate every single aspect of Steve’s life over the course of their relationship.
"I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but there's two Safety Officers outside waiting to escort you to the Air Corps base."
be taking any pictures of our son!" Steve snapped, holding his hand over the photographer's camera lens. "Not without our permission, is that understood?"
Peter's eyes narrowed as he thought. This was not anything like what he'd ever learned in school about Langara's recent history.
"Yeah, okay," Steve murmured as he slid his pants off and laid down on the bed. He never wore underwear while sleeping, so laying there completely naked for almost an hour while Tony's glorious hands massaged the soothing cream into his sore skin and aching muscles was almost like the sweetest form of torture that he could imagine, but once Tony was finished and they were curled up in bed together, Steve couldn't deny that he felt about a hundred kilos lighter than he'd felt after his nightmare.
Tony shouted, pushing back against Steve's chest. "I'm not gonna let you do it, Steve, so you just get that out of your stubborn head right the hell now!"
“Well, I’m pretty sure you deserve it, honey,” Dad said.  He tipped his head back, glancing at Papa through his eyelashes.  “You still feeling okay?”
"C'mere," Tony murmured as he reached for his worried husband, curling his arms around Steve's trembling shoulders and pulling him close. Steve's breaths were coming in short, shallow gasps, and his heart was thundering in his chest like a galloping racehorse.
and she had definitely held herself to it. If anything, she was even harder and more demanding with him than she was with the rest of the team, almost as though she was trying to overcompensate, and Peter really didn't like it all that much.
A harsh, guttural groan sounded from Peter's chest, raising all the hair on the back of Steve's neck as Loki's sceptre was brought into the image. Peter was still conscious, but only barely.
"Well… like I said. It all just pretty much sucks." Sharon tilted her head, giving Steve a warm smile. "I'm sure he'll perk up once he sees you, though. He's a real sweetie but he's pretty down at the moment. The doctors don't think he'll be going home anytime soon."
"Gotcha." Squaring his shoulders, Tony looked down at the storage case, tucking his t-shirt into his sleep pants at the last minute. No need to be worrying about bunched-up fabric while testing out a new suit. "All right, here we go."
“I love you so much,” Steve said as he captured Tony’s lips, the kiss wet and sloppy as the pleasure spiked and his strokes began to falter.  He wasn’t going to last much longer.  “Fuck, Tony, I need—I need you to come with me!”
Peter blinked, feeling like he'd just been punched in the gut. "Um… you mean the Oxford that—that's in—?"
Tony's gasp lodged in his throat as he made the turn, breathing in deeply through his nose as he tried to calm himself. For how inexperienced Steve might've been when they first got together, in the months since he had already more than made up for it, quite literally blowing Tony's mind with his passion and attentiveness. Tony had always thought of himself as a generous lover, but Steve was on a whole other level. He not only told Tony that he loved him every single chance that he got, he also
Steve had feared his whole life that he would wind up alone, that he would never find someone who loved him, would never have a child he could call his own. That fear had thankfully,
Tony was so deep in thought that he didn't even realise how fast he was walking until he rounded the final corner towards his office and proceeded to slam directly into a solid wall, dropping him flat on his ass and sending his glasses skittering across the floor.
“I saw the way you looked at Mr Rogers today at the pool,” he says, far too smugly.  “You think he’s handsome.”
"It's okay, Tony," Steve assured him, even as his own belly swooped in fear. His eyes were trained on Thanos, his blood boiling at the triumphant smile plastered across the ugly purple brute's face as he drove his hand down into the ground, reaching for the stone.
"I'm gonna go speak with King T'Challa," Steve told Thor. "As soon as he gives the okay, I'll reveal the location of the Soul Stone. It's gonna be up to us to keep our eyes on it until Thanos gets it locked in the gauntlet, but as soon as that happens—"
A chorus of chuckles erupted from the guests, after which Colonel Phillips proceeded to give the kindest, most emotionally evocative speech that Steve had ever heard him give. For several minutes he spoke about Tony's incredible steadfastness in the face of almost insurmountable odds, and how his brilliant and innovative mind helped lead their entire world to where it was today. For Steve, he spoke about his unending drive and determination, at first simply to survive, and then to become the very best fighter pilot that the Air Corps had ever seen. A drive that led to him becoming the first Langaran to ever fly in space, and that also helped to keep him alive when the enemy threatened to strand him there.
"Mr Stark's current temperature is thirty-eight point two Celsius, his heart rate has decreased to one hundred and one, and his respiratory rate is twenty-one. All are still slightly elevated."
"So, if you do get to go to the party, would you count that as a date?" Ned asked once the police car had driven away.
"Tony, I swear I don't know what you're talking—!" Steve broke off as his eyes flicked over to the abandoned sketchbook. Almost instantly his shoulders sagged, his cheeks completely draining of colour as he squeezed his eyes closed, shaking his head.
"You didn't tell me this movie was gonna be so sad!" she whispered into his arm, flinching as yet another one of the Rebels was shot by an enemy Stormtrooper.
Steve shook his head. "No, but they were hosting a humanitarian delegation from Wakanda, one that included their king, T’Chaka."
Steve frowns, cocking his head towards the building.  There's definitely something there, a weird-sounding hum buried underneath all the other noises echoing throughout the forest.  But if JARVIS says it’s okay, Steve supposes he has no reason to doubt him.
"They won't kill him, Dad," Peter said, trying to offer them both at least a tiny bit of reassurance. "Papa's too well-loved by too many people for them to just kill him."
Dad breathed in, biting down hard on his bottom lip. Then he clapped his hand on Peter's shoulder, jerking his head in Quill's direction.
"As do I, Captain," Stacy said firmly. "Keep him safe, that is. As both a father and a law enforcement officer, it's very important to me that all of the people under my watch are kept as safe as possible, and that includes all of the occupants of that Tower of yours. Especially when two of them are right now in the company of my daughter."
“You know, I’ve never seen anyone who can sneak up on people as well as you can,” Steve says, chuckling as he reaches for his bottle of apple juice.  “You should’ve been a spy or something.”
"You got it, babe," Tony said as his helmet closed over his head. "JARVIS, our suite, if you don't mind."
Steve's words came out in a rush, so it took Tony a couple of seconds for them to filter through the fog in his head.
"Thanks for your time, gentlemen," Anthony said from his perch in the control room. "See ya in a few days."
A rustling noise behind him caused him to startle, and he turned to see Tony stepping off the jet, already wearing his armour and with a determined look on his face.
The three of them ended up cooking breakfast for dinner at the request of Auntie Nat, who made some of the best French toast that Peter had ever eaten in his life, and then even made him a cup of hot chocolate afterwards while he was working on his homework. It wasn't as good as Papa's hot chocolate, but it still tasted good.
"Why would you think that I'd say 'I told you so'?" Steve asked gently as he placed his palm on Tony's shoulder, giving it a light squeeze. "Tony, do you really believe I would do that?"
Slowly, Peter blinked his eyes open. It took him several heartbeats to focus them enough to even get a brief look at his surroundings, which he then regretted almost as soon as he succeeded. He was alone, sitting in what appeared to be a concrete cell with a single glass wall, with a constant, high-pitched piercing noise in the background that was at just the right tone to continually activate his Spider Sense. The constant bolts of ice racing down Peter's spine only served to add to his overall feeling of dread and shame, the two emotions locked in a constant duel for control inside his head.
"Oh, thank you!" Steve said in obvious relief. He cleared his throat, his eyes flicking briefly to the sketchbook before focusing in on Tony.
“Good afternoon, gentlemen,” a nice, blonde-haired lady says as Peter and Dad step inside.  “You must be the Starks?”
Tony laughed, his mischievous brown eyes sparkling in the late autumn sunlight reflecting off the lake. "Why,
Thankfully, Steve was right, and it was only about thirty seconds later that they reached the car, slamming the doors against the din of noise.
“I love you, Tony,” he whispers.  “I love you so much, and I’m so sorry it took me so long to say it.  So from now on, I’m gonna tell you and that little boy the same thing every single day for the rest of my life.  You have my word.”
anniversary. Yeah, I guess it's kinda important, isn't it?" Tony said, his attempt at humour thwarted by the trembling in his lower lip as he reached for Steve's left hand, and the ring that sat on his third finger. Unlike Tony's, which hadn't left his finger since Steve placed it there almost three—
"Oh wow, really?" Peter exclaimed, briefly drawing the attention of the students at a nearby table. "I mean, really? That would be so awesome if you did! Would you want me to talk to my dad about it, I'm sure that I could—"
"I understand perfectly, Captain," said T'Challa. "As someone who has recently been through a rather difficult time myself, please allow me to sympathise with you and your son, Mr Stark. Dare I say that you were both able to emerge from that terrible experience stronger than you were before?"
If Tony could manage to build something strong enough to fight his way out of a fully armoured cave in Afghanistan with a dying Peter in tow, then he could surely figure out how to fight his way off of a spaceship with a Peter that was just as powerful—or even more so—than Steve.
he thinks, internally chuckling at the absurdity of it.  He used to say that all the time back when he was skinny and sickly, blithely refusing offers of help after the death of his ma and insisting that he could take care of himself just fine.
"Good, 'cause I could use your help in the lab tonight, got a new upgrade I'm working on for Uncle James that I'd like your input on."
But if that was the case, why would those shipments include exploding bullets?  And why would anyone need bullets that explode in the first place?  Why not just use a bomb?
"My last name's Quill," Blaster Peter said, puffing out his chest. "I'm also known as Star-Lord, as you've probably heard."
He was cut off by Steve's fingers on his lips. "I don't need to think, Tony," he said in his Captain's voice. "Because it's an absolute fact, and that's all there is to it."
Peter's lips stretched into a smile as he opened his notebook, flipping his pencil around his thumb as he studied what he hoped were the final code fragments for JARVIS. Dad had told him he would be testing out his latest updates that afternoon, and as long as those were okay and once Dad got the last of his changes uploaded, then JARVIS would be ready to escort Steve and his two teammates out into space for their trial mission.
So instead, after stopping off in the kitchen for some coffee, Tony headed back to the lab.  Settling in at his workstation, Tony tapped his monitor to life and rested his chin on his hands, wondering how in the hell it had all come to this.
"Exactly," said Papa. He let out a sort of frustrated chuckle. "You would think that after almost half of the Senate and House were arrested for colluding with HYDRA that things might work their way through the channels a bit faster, but apparently that's not the case."
"Okay, well, Captain Rogers is correct," said Anthony. "The X-302 aircrafts are the first to use the new arc reactor propulsion systems, and judging from what I've seen and by your daily flight reports, they seem to be performing well."
"Well, that's the thing, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said. "Your dad seems to think that there was another program hiding down underneath JARVIS, or some such thing. And somehow, activating the tesseract caused it to… wake up and take him over."
you. It's not easy to see you like this, and I know it's been hard for Pete too. He loves you so much, honey, it's hard for him to see you struggling."
"We need to let Peter use the glasses, Tony," Steve said after a short pause. "We need to make sure that—"
And nor should they be. Steve had seen too many examples of countries trying to push their so-called "protections" onto others to wish for something like that now. Even given what they were potentially facing.
There were still so many uncertainties. Peter's symptoms, the alien army Tony saw out in space, and the strange blue gem housed on the end of Loki's staff just to name a few. But the one thing that Steve knew without a doubt was that he was in love with Tony Stark and his precious son, and that they loved him.
“Pete,” Dad said, cursing when he almost dropped his phone.  “Buddy, you know I’m slammed here at the moment, and—”
Steve gasped, causing him to choke on a mouthful of his superwater and prompting Bucky to pound on his back.
"Good. That’s... that’s good.” Steve squeezed his eyes closed, grunting against the pain as he sucked in a deep, shaky breath. His mind was still racing at MACH-2 as he tried to process what had just happened. The mission had seemed to have been a complete success. All three of the aircraft had functioned perfectly, he, Bucky, and Carol had all fallen into their orbits and deployed their satellites without incident, and JARVIS had made sure that Steve met his go/no-go point with no issues at all.
"No, I'll just go and find him," he said as he reached for the t-shirt sitting on his bedside table. He and Tony usually slept shirtless; Steve loved the feel of Tony's smooth olive skin pressed up against his, but he didn't feel it was appropriate for him to wander around the house that way because of Peter.
"Bucky!" Steve cried, twisting around just as another bubble of purple light burst from T'Challa's suit. Steve quickly jumped out of the way, his heart in his throat as he watched it take out at least a dozen of the war dogs before dissipating.
"I'm pretty sure you haven't bud," said Tony. In a war-torn society, art and music were never given much of a priority, and Tony was thrilled that Peter had Steve now to encourage and help develop his artistic talent.
And now, they were preparing to do so again. It wasn't exactly hyperbole to say that they were literally planning to move heaven and Earth to get Peter and the others back, putting themselves and the rest of their team in who-knows-how grave of a danger to undo the most horrible loss they ever could have imagined.
And as the team leader, it was his responsibility to make sure that the team was ready when that day came.
Steve gave a sheepish shrug, biting down hard on his lip. He'd never mentioned his hospital visits to anyone, but knowing Phillips, he probably already knew about them anyway.
And while that didn't bother him, or at least not too much, it was just another reminder that people saw him as some sort of a hero, and saw the Avengers as the Earth's protectors. All of which meant that Steve couldn't afford to let them down.
Which was pretty much the same thing the military government did when they took power. From what Grandpa had told Peter, the restrictions that they imposed on the civilian population were so severe that they were basically unsustainable, but that no one was able to push back against them because there was such an overwhelming sense of panic due to the horrific Battle of the Continents and the nationwide power outage. By the time the outage had been addressed—with the temporary fix that was still in place to that day—the time for concerted pushback had long passed, and anyone who dared to try and complain was quickly "taken care of".
In fact, if he had to guess, he would've said that they were waiting for just the right moment to strike. Kinda like how Dr Strange had been waiting for the right moment to bring them to Wakanda.
"You're damn right he will," said Dad. "Papa never backs down from a fight, you know that. And from what Bucky's told me, he's been that way since he was younger than you."
"Well, then, how 'bout you eat your breakfast and I'll come back once I'm done with my other patients, okay?" said Ms Sharon. "We'll see if we can find those handsome eyes of yours again, hmm?"
"I do agree with you there," Steve murmured. He dug the tips of his fingers into Tony's scalp so deliciously that Tony couldn't help but let out a soft moan, his eyes fluttering closed as Steve's lips brushed across his cheekbone over to his ear. "Can we go say goodnight to Peter now? I want some time alone with you before I have to leave."
Tony was quiet for several heartbeats. "Well, I guess we are. Isn't that part of the Avengers' mission? To take down HYDRA?"
But Peter only shook his head, his eyes narrowing even further as he grabbed Steve by the scruff of his ragged t-shirt, yanking him to his feet and slamming him up against the back wall. A sharp cry tore from Steve's jagged throat as he landed on his injured foot, and he bit down hard on his bottom lip as he struggled to meet his son's eyes.
He felt Steve's bandaged fingers under his chin, turning his head back to look into his eyes. "Tony, I'm telling you right now that we're going to do this," he said. "I know it may not seem like it, but there are a lot more of us who feel the way you do than you might think, and I know we can do it. I
"Oh, sure you wouldn't, until he just kills the both of you and takes the stone anyway," retorted Tony. "Or didn't you wizard-types think of that?"
Or at least, as peacefully as he could with the massive oxygen mask that covered most of his face. Peter wasn't quite to the point where he needed the extra boost during the daytime hours yet, but Tony knew it would only be a matter of time before he got there, and then—
"But that would go against the wizard's prediction, and I'm not sure we should do that," said Mantis, sounding absolutely horrified. "He made it very clear that there were only two ways we could possibly win, and—"
"Run, young Starkson!" Peter heard as lightning bolts burst out from inside the monster, merging with the electrical charge from Auntie Nat's Widow's Bites and Uncle Clint's arrows, which Peter just happened to notice were made from wood and fibreglass rather than metal.
“Are you kidding me?”  Tony took Steve’s face into his hands, pressing a hard kiss to his lips.  “Honey, of course it’s okay!  You know I’m not gonna push you, but—”
"Oh, sure! The fresh air'll probably help," Gwen said. "Or, at least as fresh as you can get in New York City. I'll go and get your stuff."
"No, Dad, she wasn't wrong, it was awesome having them with me!" said Peter. "Captain Wilson even taught me this really cool card game, and—"
Steve loved him, and he loved Steve. And while he hadn't exactly meant to blurt out that little factoid in the heat of the moment like he had, after Steve's earnest confession Tony just hadn't been able to contain it any longer. Somehow, in only a few short weeks, Steve had managed to tear down all of the iron walls that Tony had so carefully constructed around his heart in the years since Peter's birth. Tony had resigned himself to being alone ever since Peter's heart diagnosis, and for the most part he had been okay with it. He had been fine with pouring everything that he had into his son because he had to ensure that someday Peter would be able to get the operation that he so desperately needed.
"Tony," he began, tightening his grip on Tony's hands. "There's no way I could ever convey how much you mean to me in just a few short sentences, so let me simply say this. When I met you, I was a bitter, broken, shell of a man hiding behind a rank and a fancy flight helmet. I had believed for so long that if I could just achieve the next goal, and then the next one, and then the next one, that somehow I would just magically become happy."
"You haven't been a jerk," Gwen murmured. "Just a bit… broody. You're much cuter when you smile." Peter let out a chuckle, his smile widening when Gwen laughed. "There, you see? Isn't that better?"
Thor shouted as he began running across the plain engulfed in blinding-white lightning bolts, his words filling Steve with the very same awe that he'd felt on that day, when he'd believed that now that Thor had arrived, the Avengers' victory was assured.
"That's okay, I'll go and check on him now," Steve said. He patted Peter on the shoulder. "Did you remember to pack your snacks?"
Gwen frowned, tilting her head. "There's no need to get defensive with me, Peter, 'cause I already know all this. I'm just relaying information here, okay? I know the only real interaction you've had with my father was at that one dinner, but—"
And then, well… his occasional twenty-minute catnaps on the counter seemed to be working just fine for him lately, so…
"Remember when I told you that I'd met Tony's son?" Steve asked. "And how protective he was of him?"
He knew the answer, of course.  All he needed were the guts to take that final step.  He had told himself that he’d been waiting for the right time, when in reality, the right time had passed a long time ago.
Peter frowned. "What about him? I'm assuming he'll be there too. Why, you think he's gonna try and interrogate me or something?"
The tall, blond, and handsome guy he knew he loved with his entire heart and soul and everything in between.
Peter thought as he slid two slices of pizza onto a plate.  Because even though he trusted that Dad had blocked all the calls from the office, that didn't mean Obadiah didn't know how else to get to him.
"You're not in any danger though, are you?" asked Steve. "With your heart? It's not going to… undo itself or something someday, is it?"
"You really should eat something, hon," Steve suddenly heard from the fancy, futuristic medical table next to him, nearly causing him to drop the glass as Tony's eyes blinked open.
"Copy that," Steve said. He tapped his compass, his heart fluttering as his quantum helmet closed over his head. Then he picked up his shield, gripping it tightly as the rest of the team followed suit.
"Except they had no idea how powerful it would be," said Tony. "Because the only person who had any inkling of it was my father, and they never asked him."
And while knowing about JARVIS's existence and having the knowledge to actually manipulate him enough to mess with the aircraft were two completely different things, Peter was still very glad that he'd taken the initiative to create more layers of encryption to JARVIS's programming. If Project Phoenix hoped to have any chance of succeeding, Peter had to make sure that JARVIS was kept safe.
Steve huffed, frowning at his husband even as he knew he was right. Steve was a huge proponent of making sure that his teammates stayed as healthy as possible, and that included regular sessions with Sam Wilson, their resident counselor. But like Tony said, Steve often had plenty of excuses to not make or keep his own appointments with Sam. He usually tried to brush it off, saying that he and Sam's frequent morning runs together were good enough as they often discussed various things related to the team. But Steve also knew that if Tony tried to use a similar excuse on Steve, there'd be no way that Steve would let it fly.
"And you don't think I'll be safe at the home of a deputy police chief?" Peter demanded. "You think only superheroes with armour and shields and fancy security drones can keep me safe? You know I'm even stronger than Papa, but you still think I'm just some weak little kid who needs to be protected all the time! I could be a superhero too, if you'd just let me!"
Howard Stark, the world-famous scientist, inventor, and mastermind behind so much of the Langaran military's equipment that he even had a wing of the Air Corps base named after him, had been arrested for treason, a crime punishable by death.
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, sir," answered JARVIS. "All vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"Hey, Nat," Steve replied just as the viewscreen suddenly lit up behind him, displaying a scrolling list of names of the known deceased. A huge knot rose in Steve's throat as the names kept coming, and coming, and coming, seemingly without end, fighting the strong urge to scream at the unfairness of it all.
His second and third trips into the tunnel, where he witnessed himself and Peter spending Christmas in the hospital when Peter was six years old, and later answering some very difficult questions from an adolescent Peter about why Tony allowed Obadiah Stane to bully him, hadn't helped at all.
Besides, he'd been doing it for so long, ever since the Battle of New York, the team was more than used to it by now.
"Are ya hungry?" Tony asked once they broke apart. "Pretty sure Clint was planning on heating up some frozen pizzas for lunch."
With JARVIS's help, Steve had no problem doing the paperwork online the way SHIELD preferred. He didn't like to, though, so he printed the forms, completed them by hand, and then let JARVIS digitize and upload the results. It was a compromise that worked for everyone: Steve got to work the way he preferred, and Director Fury got his paperwork the way he wanted it.
If Tony were looking at him, Steve wasn't sure he'd be able to do this. Or at least, not like this--taking what he wanted from Tony, confident in the knowledge that Tony wanted it as much as Steve did.
Steve decided not to show him. He'd drawn Tony too often during the hours he spent in the lab, even though he'd also brought paperwork with him to keep himself occupied, and that wasn't a confession he felt like making.
Steve felt bad for a moment. Tony had never said, but some of the arguments between him and Pepper that nobody had been able to help overhearing had made it clear that Tony wasn't handling the aftermath of the Chitauri invasion as well as he liked to make it seem.
, the same place he'd given his first interview after his "relationship" with Tony had gone public, and Megan McLaren had brought up their recent appearances at marriage equality events.
, this incredibly awkward conversation has been leading up to me telling you that no matter how much we get on one another's nerves a lot of the time, I'm…" He hesitated. "Let's start with 'attracted to you,' and see where we go from there."
"Absolutely," Steve said. "I don't want there to be anyone with any doubts about us--about me--when people see me on TV next week."
Okay, that was the opposite of smooth, but he wasn't going to call it a date, not in the middle of this conversation-- "then why did he make breakfast for me this morning? Making sure I was safely in bed, last night, sure, that sounds like the kind of thing he'd do for anybody, even someone who'd just been an asshole at him. I mean, he was willing to help Doom."
And if Steve carried him upstairs last night, was it better or worse that Tony couldn't remember it?
And compared to what might be a lifetime trapped in a pocket dimension alone, Steve's fears of sounding stupid were nothing, so he said, "I don't need anything. I just missed you, that's all."
Tony abandoned the food immediately, reaching for the mug. The steam rising from it warned him to sip carefully, but if he hadn't been afraid of burning his throat, he'd have gulped it the way he had the water.
He took a tentative sip, and something must have showed on his face, because Tony frowned, setting down his own glass. "Is something wrong?"
Steve managed a slight smile. "It's very recent," he said. "I probably should have let the Avengers' publicist make a statement, but I was already scheduled to appear on your show, and I just couldn't pretend." Couldn't pretend
"I'd also start actively supporting a lot of causes they don't agree with," he continued. "Marriage equality, protections for kids at school, that kind of thing. Causes I've given some money to in the past, but now I'd want to start lending my personal support. It'll let me tell people what I think that real American values should be."
"Besides," he went on, "I need something to do with my hands while I talk to you. I'm not great at just sitting still."
It hadn't been Steve's plan. Steve had been thinking about how good it would be to spend some time alone, where no one expected him to be half of a couple.
Steve sometimes thought it was an unnecessary extravagance, but today he was grateful for it. He could pull out one of the prepared vegetable salads with an "XP" on the package (for "extra protein," marking the dishes they made to suit Steve and Thor's nutritional needs) and have something to eat that was both cold--exactly what Steve was craving, after a day in the heat--and required very little effort, which was also a consideration today.
Afterward, Steve gave everyone their notes about what they had done well and what they could do better, but today he did it without making eye contact with Tony. Even when he was specifically talking about how Tony needed to be more aware of where his team members were, he looked straight above the top of Tony's head.
So after one more kiss, even though Steve's hands were running over his back and he really wanted to feel the on his skin, Tony pulled away again.
But it wasn't seventy years ago, so Steve swallowed hard, past the tightness in his throat, and said, "I hear it's complicated. Not always worth it."
"Give us ten minutes," Bruce said. "We'll open up a portal to these coordinates then, big enough for you to come through."
The only difference was that he’d changed from the T-shirt and jeans he’d been working in into a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt that Steve assumed he wore as pajamas. His feet were bare; Steve didn’t know if sleepwalkers didn’t notice cold feet, or if Tony didn't own a pair of slippers. It wasn’t the kind of thing that came up in conversation.
"So drunk that I honestly don't remember anything after sitting at that table in the corner and talking to you for a while. So I'm not exactly sure what I did or said, but I need you to understand--" whether or not it was true-- "that I say, and do, a lot of things when I'm drunk that I wouldn't even think about saying otherwise. So whatever it was, I'm sorry, I'm not planning on drinking that much again so there won't be a repeat, so can we forget this ever happened?"
Shrugging, Gwen popped another apple into her mouth, chewing it slowly. "It's not that my dad doesn't like the company or anything. I mean, his own officers use a lot of Stark Industries equipment, and I know your father sells it to them at very reasonable prices, probably lower than he should, really. It's just…"
"Oh my God!" Peter cried as yet another massive icy wave shot down his spine, nearly bringing him to his knees as he heard Uncle Thor's booming voice come through the portal, his tone indicating that he was out for blood.
"Hey, sweetheart," he said as he stepped inside, avoiding a precariously leaning stack of papers as he made his way over to Tony. He glanced briefly at the computer screen, his eyes crinkling as he smiled.
And as always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Do you have any plans to expand the Avengers, Captain? Add new members? Perhaps this Spider-Man fellow that keeps popping up from time to time? And wasn't he at one point rumoured to be none other than Peter Stark, the very boy you saved out in the desert?"
"It's all right, Pep. Just have Happy bring 'em up sometime in the next couple of days and I'll take a look. It's not a problem."
"Yes, sir," Steve replied. "My name is Steven Grant Rogers, and my date of birth is July the fourth, nineteen hundred and eighteen."
Dad and Papa exchanged glances, their eyebrows quirking and dipping in that goofy, non-verbal communication thing that they'd had perfected since even before their first date.
"Bucky and I will be up in a couple hours or so to start on some dinner, 'kay, kiddo?" said Uncle Sam as they pulled into the Tower garage. "Don't want you and Tony going hungry."
They came within seconds of each other, their foreheads pressed together and panting shuddering breaths of air against each other's lips. As soon as Steve felt able to move again he pulled Tony down, ignoring the sticky mess on his belly as he tucked his beloved fella's head underneath his chin, careful to avoid pressing on the deep bruises littering the width of his upper back. The hot, throbbing aches in his foot and side were now gone, replaced by a wonderful warm, buzzing feeling.
"That's right," answered Steve. "Your associate, Valkyrie, was leading them. She was riding a Pegasus."
Peter shook his head, burrowing further into his blankets. "It's nothing JARVIS, just talking to myself."
Peter cried. "Where the hell are we going? And why didn't you wanna go anywhere when my dad was still here?"
“But not on purpose,” Tony insisted.  He leaned closer, placing his other hand on Steve’s back.  “All parents hurt their kids sometimes.  I once elbowed Pete in the head so hard that I knocked him down.  He was standing right there in my blind spot, and I turned too fast and—look, it just happens, honey.  It doesn't mean that you don't love him.  And Pete knows that.  He’s been so worried about you the whole weekend!”
"Really? That's so awesome!" Peter exclaimed. Gwen had told him that she'd sent in several applications for different summer internship programs for the following year, hoping that her experience working at Stark Industries over the previous summer would be a good stepping stone.
"Well… I'm sure if you asked 'em real nice, the nanites in your suit would display it for you. Kinda like an outsider's HUD," said Tony. "You could make it look like you're trying to protect it, when really you're—"
Well, maybe "dead" wasn't quite the right word, but Peter honestly didn't have the mindset to try and think of a more accurate description at the moment. All he could think was that after Thanos left Titan, he must've found the Soul Stone down in Wakanda, and then snapped his fingers.
By the time all the football games and chess matches were over and every single last crumb of pie had been eaten—and the refrigerator raided of leftovers no less than three times—Peter was so exhausted that Steve practically had to carry him to his room. After Tony helped him into his pyjamas and coached him through brushing his teeth, they tucked him into his bed, reminding him that he would be going Black Friday shopping with Natasha, Bucky, and Sam in the morning.
Which then led Steve to yet another question: was Anthony Stark working for the Air Corps on his own accord, or because the government decided that he needed to be punished for his father's sins even though Howard was found not guilty?
"Are you Howard Stark, sir?" said the larger of the two Safety Officers as he pulled his ID badge from his breast pocket.
"Yeah, that's a go," said Tony. He lowered his arms, a huge smile spreading across his lips as the holographic nanites absorbed back into their container. Finally, he seemed to have broken through the proverbial brick wall with this tech.
"All right, all right," Steve said. They could go round and round for hours detailing all of Mitchell and Sheppard's goofy exploits after they'd had a couple of beers, and while Steve was sure Tony would be amused, and likely contribute a few stories of his own, that wasn't exactly why they were there.
Phillips gave a single nod, jerking his head in Anthony's direction. "Good. Now, you will all turn your complete attention to Mr Stark while he runs through a few final details. Mr Stark?"
The very same golden light that had arrived to rescue Tony and the others when they were stranded in space, at almost the exact moment when he'd lost all hope.
Peter repeated. "She'd be stupid to turn down something like that, and Gwen is nowhere near stupid!"
Peter was so focused on his wallowing that he didn't even hear his door as it creaked open, or hear his father as he stepped over to the bed and leaned closer, trying to figure out what he was up to.
Finally, once Tony’s ears were ringing and Obie had exhausted himself, Tony spoke up, telling Obie that in no uncertain terms was his relationship with Steve anyone’s business but his and Steve’s, and that if Obie didn't like it, he could pack up his stuff and leave.
"They would need to negotiate a peace treaty before this even got started. Or at least a cease-fire, and—"
"Ow!" he groaned, rubbing at the burning pain as he squinted at the gibberish rolling across his screen. "What the—?"
"Shall I ensure that the suit's weapons are in test-mode, sir?" JARVIS asked. "Or do you wish to give DUM-E a workout this morning."
Steve thinks as he pumps his arms, his lungs burning from the dry, freezing air.  He used to love it.  Used to love having snowball fights and going sledding down the nearby hill on his ma’s trashbin lid during the Brooklyn winters growing up.
And, no matter how much Dad didn't want to hear it, Peter knew without a doubt that he had no right to stand in its way.
“I’ve got it done, Obie,” Tony interrupted.  He took advantage of Obie’s temporary shock to twist out of his grasp, sucking in a deep lungful of air.  He’d always
"Hey, I'm all for decompressing," Sam said as he clapped Steve on the shoulder. "See ya tomorrow morning, Cap?"
"Oh, and now you need your girl to stand up for you, little prince?" sneered Flash. "Didn't your papa teach you how to stand up for yourself?"
And while Peter supposed that excuse sounded plausible enough, he was still pretty surprised at how easily the country had bought it.
Stifling a yawn, Tony glanced over at Steve, sitting across from him with his nose buried in a book, some manual on war strategy that looked to be almost as old as he was. His normally pale skin was slightly tanned thanks to hours and hours spent on the beach, making his sun-bleached blond hair seem even lighter in contrast. He had missed one of his every-other-week haircuts while they were gone so the ends of his hair were curling slightly around his ears, and the overall effect was so unbelievably sexy that Tony had half a mind to try and pull him into one of the restrooms on the plane before it landed, to hell with Clint and his constant needling.
"Don't, Colonel," Tony warned. "Just… don't. Don't try and give me any unwarranted hope right now, all right? The only thing that matters is getting this new program through all of the thousands of miles of military red tape."
Steve felt his cheeks flushing for the umpteenth time.  “Thanks, little guy.  You were right, this is a lot of fun.”
Tony shook his head, tears welling in his exhausted eyes.  Yes, they needed to focus on finding Steve, and as soon as possible.  But there was a bit more to it than that.
"Nope, we're not starting that up again," Tony warned him. "Damnit, Steve, when the hell are you gonna believe me that none of this is your fault? I mean, for all we know what was going on here was going on at the same time as our house was being bombed, and at the same time as Project Insight! And you can't forget that HYDRA had their grimy hands on Loki's sceptre from the end of the Chitauri invasion until that battle down in Miami, and we still don't know exactly what that thing does, so there's really no telling what they could've been doing here."
A bright blue light flashed from his palm, indicating a direct and destructive hit. Immediately, Tony pivoted, aiming another shot towards the floor-to-ceiling windows lining one half of the lab.
Steve loved watching those two boys play together, like the sort of cousins that they were. Besides being just a very sweet, kind, and gentle young man, Pietro had been key in helping to break Steve, Peter, and the rest of the team out of the invisible HYDRA facility down in Georgia.
As it still should've been even now. Peter was only eleven, still a few months from his twelfth birthday and so still five whole years away from becoming a legal Langaran adult, and yet, he'd already won more unwinnable battles than the entire Air Corps complement of cocky flyboys combined.
"My son's name is Peter Stark-Rogers, sir," Steve said firmly. "And that video meant to implicate my son was sent to various press outlets as a deliberate attempt by an enemy of our family to not only discredit us, but to also put us in danger. And since then it has been completely and thoroughly debunked, as I'm sure you're aware."
"Oohh," Steve groaned as he stroked them together, the slick slide of Tony's cock against his sending sharp bursts of pleasure rocketing up his spine. "Tony, it feels so incredible, I'm not—I'm not gonna last long!"
Tony couldn't even bear to attempt to think about it objectively because there was just no way he could lose Peter and survive. No way at all. The fact that the country would also lose one of its top minds was a very, very distant second.
Tony says into Steve’s chest.  He lets out a hard shiver, burrowing further into Steve’s chest as his teeth start to chatter.  It takes Steve’s muddled mind a couple of minutes before he realises that as far as he could tell, Tony wasn’t shivering until he started holding him.  Which means, if Steve hadn’t said anything when he did, then—
"Oh, Papa, this is so yummy!" he said after he'd swallowed his first steaming spoonful. "Dad's gonna love it, it's so much better than the store-bought stuff!"
"Would you like my hand or my mouth, sweetheart?" Steve asked as he kissed down to Tony's neck, sucking gently on his pulse point as his hand slowly stroked Tony's cock, sending more bursts of heat across his body. Tony moaned at the sensation, gliding his hands down Steve's sides to his glorious ass as Steve pressed their foreheads together.
And it was even better once their penthouse was finally done, because then they only had to ride the elevator up to their home instead of driving back out to Grandpa's mansion in the suburbs. Even as a little kid Peter could tell that Dad was uncomfortable there, almost as though Grandpa's ghost was haunting him or something, which Peter always thought was a bit odd since their Malibu house had also originally belonged to Grandpa, but Dad didn't seem to mind it quite as much.
Being immobilised in ice and left to suffocate, it was one of Steve's absolute worst fears coming to life.
Two silver medals would only bring in about thirty thousand, but that would still be enough to cover the mortgage payments and make a decent-sized dent in Ma’s medical bills.  How they might pay for the rest, Steve would have to figure out later, but he’s hoping if they can show the hospital that they’re making an effort to pay, they might be able to work something out.
Picking up his pencil, Steve quickly became so engrossed in his work that he didn't even notice Peter entering the kitchen until he said, "Good morning," startling Steve so badly that he almost knocked over his chair.
"This is a bigger deal to me than going to space," Steve said, tossing a scowl in Bucky's direction. "And shouldn't you be taking notes or something?"
"I have completed three such diagnostics in the last six hours, sir," said JARVIS. "I am unsure as to what another would accomplish at this time."
, who was standing rather awkwardly next to Peter's chair, nervously eyeing DUM-E who was perched over in his usual corner
"Then I'm absolutely not gonna tell him," Peter murmured as he tried to get comfortable. He knew he still had to get up to pee and brush his teeth, but he also knew that the amount of pity he'd see in Ms Sharon's eyes would be positively smothering, so he thought he'd just wait a few minutes first.
"But not critical," Tony said with a frown. He drew in another raspy breath, clutching his abdomen as another coughing fit hit him. "Which means I'll be fine in a couple of days, just like I said."
"Yeah, okay," Steve said. He hurried over to Peter's side, planting a gentle kiss on his clammy forehead. "I love you, little guy. You sleep good, okay?"
"Okay, but, why isn't Uncle Bruce hulking out? And who're those guys with the glowy circle things on their hands?"
Silence fell across the table, punctuated only by the sound of shifting chairs and tapping fingertips.
He was cut off as a shiny grey rope suddenly appeared through the portal, one so familiar and beautiful that both Alt-Steve and Tony jumped back, their hands automatically clasping together as the entire battle seemed to pause, as if it was drawing in a deep breath.
"Welcome Captain Rogers, Mr Stark," the chairman said, clapping his hands to ask for silence. "We appreciate your presence in this chamber today."
"Yes," whispered Tony as he peeled Steve's t-shirt up his back with a light scrape of his fingernails, tossing it somewhere off to the side as their lips met and their legs intertwined, with Steve's already rock-hard erection pressing insistently into Tony's hip.
“Yeah, you can.”  Tony brushed his lips across Steve’s again, grinding his hips down so deliciously that Steve let out a moan.  “Tell me what you want, honey.  You know I’ll give you anything.”
Tony said on a gasp as Steve dipped his head to capture his lips. Steve let out a soft moan as his tongue found Tony's, not realising until that very second just how badly he needed him.
"All right, let's see what you bastards got," he murmured as he raced towards the invisible but deadly line of demarcation, his hands gripping the throttle and stick as he counted down in his head.
"You're scowling," answered Gwen. She handed Peter a set of silverware, the slight brush of her fingers against his sending another shock of warmth shooting up his arm. "You almost look like you're in pain or something. You didn't get hurt in gym class, did you? 'Cause I did some reading about the recovery period from mono, and the book I read said that one of the possible complications from it is an enlarged spleen, and that you're supposed to avoid any contact sports until it can be ruled out, so I'm actually really surprised that your dads are even letting you go to gym class, 'cause if it's enlarged the risk is pretty high of it rupturing if you get hit in the abdomen, and I'm pretty sure that would freak everyone out if it happened at school. Not to mention that it'd probably be really painful, too."
Tony slid his fingers over Steve's lips to silence him, rolling his hips up to meet Steve's and delighting in his husband's sharp intake of breath.
it contained first-edition printings of the other six novels as well.  All in hardback, and each with their original concept covers.
Peter sighed, rubbing his nose on Tony's shirt. "You make it sound like I'm still three years old. I'm fifteen now, Dad, I can handle more than you think, especially when it involves my family. I could even be an Avenger if you and Papa would let me. To hell with that Senator and that stupid tabloid newspaper, you've seen me in training with the rest of the team. You know what I can do."
"Yeah, I know. I guess I was just kinda hoping that it hadn't gotten to that point yet." If HYDRA was already trying to smear Papa in the news then that could only mean that they were starting to move to the next phase of their plan, which likely included total or almost total control of the media.
Again, Tony waited until Bucky gave a nod before grabbing his pressurised air container. "Pete, you wanna grab him a chair? And I'm gonna need you to help hold his arm steady, all right?"
The man smiled.  “Ah, yeah, that one is pretty rare.  I found it on a quick jaunt that I took over to Ireland about five years ago.”
"We gotta do something about that ship!" Tony stated as he did a quick check of his suit's parameters. If he could increase the power by about seventy-five percent, then firing three of his Jericho formations directly into the thing's power core would hopefully be enough to disable it.
"That tends to happen when you take someone's husband and son prisoner, Hammer!" Tony retorted. "Now, where the hell are they?"
Now, Tony had a partner. Someone who not only loved him passionately and unconditionally, but who also loved his son as if he were his very own flesh and blood.
In the back of Peter's mind he realised that he was probably being unreasonable, but he was so tired and frustrated that he didn't even care. His dads' paranoia had gotten so bad lately that it was seeping into nearly every aspect of their lives, and Peter was
"Christ, babe, you're such a sap," Dad suddenly mumbled from behind Peter. "Go to sleep before it rubs off on the kid, yeah?"
He started at Tony's neck, kissing and nibbling and caressing across his husband's beautiful olive-toned upper body, sucking marks into the skin below his collarbones and spending ample time on the kaleidoscope of scars marking the centre of Tony's chest, where the arc reactor had once been. Tony had never admitted to Steve that he was self-conscious of the arc reactor but Steve knew he was anyway, and had always taken special care to lavish attention to it, so grateful that it was able to keep the man that he loved alive.
" Steve rasped as Tony broke away from his lips to trail kisses down his cheek to his jaw, settling in on his pulse point. He sucked a small mark there, pulling back to glance at it before it disappeared.
Tony stood back as the pilots filtered out of the room, collecting his notes and trying very hard to not notice that Captain Rogers' standard-issue Air Corps plain white t-shirt did absolutely nothing to hide the rippling muscles across his back and shoulders.
He had already tried punching through the glass wall of his cell, badly bruising his knuckles in the process when the wall didn't budge in the slightest. It obviously wasn't glass, but as to what it could possibly be Peter had no idea. He only knew that he had to get out of there.
He and Tony had had periods of celibacy before. When they first began courting they had taken their physical relationship slow at Steve's request, finally spending their first night together on Christmas night. After that magical first time, it was a rare night where they weren't intimate in some form or another until the Malibu house was bombed, and Steve suffered the multiple gunshot wounds that led to a three-day stay in the hospital.
Seeing Tony ready and willing to help repair the ship seemed to breathe a bit of life back into Gamora. Straightening her shoulders, she gestured towards a utility shelf, on which sat several battered and worn tools, a few of which Tony could recognise from what he had used on Thor's ship.
Papa propped himself up on his elbow, smiling down at Peter. "Sure, little guy. What's on your mind?"
“Oh, yeah!” Peter says, a bit too quickly for Tony’s taste.  “I’ve been sayin’ that for forever now!”
Tony smiled as he kissed his way back up to Steve's mouth. "Then just lie back and enjoy yourself, okay? I'm gonna take good care of you."
"We do," Steve said, smiling widely. "Since it's Peter's birthday tomorrow, I specifically asked if we could move in right away."
do you mean you’ve lost contact with him?” Tony snapped, glaring bullets up at the visage of Nick Fury on his viewscreen.  “For fuck’s sake, Nick, it’s been almost four weeks!  Steve’s radio silence wasn’t supposed to last this long!”
Finally, drawing on his last vestiges of strength, Steve straightened his back, peeled his eyes open, and positioned his shield, forcing his feet to take one step, then another, securely planting his feet to avoid slipping on the now frost-covered path.  It was agonisingly slow, made even more so by the fact that while Steve could no longer detect the high-pitched buzzing noise, the darkness seemed to have invited a whole slew of others, noises that Steve’s frozen ears were having difficulty in identifying.  He could decipher a few different animals, carrion birds and some small, nocturnal predators that he knew wouldn’t bother him as long as he left them alone, but there was also another sound, one that as he paused again in an attempt to place, that seemed to be cutting right through the ambient noise of night.  Chills raced down Steve’s spine as the dull, groaning noise grew louder and more rumbling, almost as though it was being broadcast from speakers hidden somewhere within the dense evergreens.
"Uh huh. I'll be there." With very rare exceptions, Peter always helped Papa make dinner every night, and it was especially fun when he knew his uncles were coming.
Steve bit down hard on his bottom lip, studying the distant mountains for several heartbeats. "Who?" he finally asked. "Who would do it?"
"So… Steve shows up here out of the blue. Then the next day he goes to Dad's class on the X-302s and he obviously would've learned Dad's name, but I never told Steve my last name and Ms Sharon told me that they're not allowed to tell anyone who isn't family, and Dad's not allowed to talk about anything personal at work, so…" He tapped his chin, trying to force his tired mind to work.
"I really hate to do this," Steve said after he'd reluctantly checked his timepiece. "But I've gotta be up in a little over four hours, so—"
"Long as they have beer, I'm all for it," said Uncle Clint. He and Auntie Nat were sitting on one of the couches facing the huge viewscreen, cuddled up together with her legs over his lap.
Away from memory fragments that still haunted his dreams, and had transformed his papa from Captain America into a fragile, frightened shell of his former self.
"As soon as possible. Yes, sir, I heard you the first time," said JARVIS. "Are you wishing to replace all of the current units?"
"Goddamnit, Strange, I'm telling you that we need to get going now!" Dad said again, his fingers stroking through Peter's hair. Thanks to the battle—and being strangled—Peter's senses were going completely bonkers, making even Dad's normal conversational voice seem like he was screaming into a bullhorn.
Steve pressed his lips to Tony's palm, not at all surprised. Tony had always been impatient whenever he was sick or injured, often fighting tooth and nail against Steve and Peter's efforts to get him to take it easy so he could heal.
"Yeah, that's part of it, although the suits are a bit bulky for continuous reconnaissance so I'll have to come up with something else too, but they're at least a start. I got 'em out there right now, keeping an eye on things."
“Hmm.  But you might be now?” Natasha asks, in that sultry voice of hers that always sounds like she’s flirting.  “I mean, you know how to do it, don’t you?”
At the time, Steve had believed that he'd lost the love of his life. And yet, somehow, he had still managed to stamp down his grief long enough to rise to the task that had been laid out in front of him.
Steve was quiet for a moment, not quite sure how to respond. It didn't surprise Steve in the least that Peter had sensed the ship's presence before he saw it, as his Spider Sense had never let him down before. It didn't even surprise him that Gwen had begged Peter not to go. She loved Peter, of that Steve had no doubt, and would never want him to deliberately place himself in danger.
"JARVIS? Has Pete left for that field trip of his yet?" he asked, trying to sound casual, and failing miserably.
"You think this has anything to do with that drug Aminacin that Killian gave us?" he finally asked. "I know Bruce gave us both the antidote, but maybe some of it is still in our systems somewhere, just waiting to cause trouble."
Natasha didn’t understand why Toni wouldn’t face her. She’d seen this girl bloody and bruised, sobbing and literally retching. What could she be hiding?
And looking into those brown eyes, watery, wide, and innocent, Maria didn’t have an answer. She couldn’t tell Toni that her father was mixed in with the criminal underworld, and that, should they attempt to leave, there were many dangerous men who owed him enough favors to find them and take them out...or worse, bring them back. She didn’t know how to explain to Anotinia that staying here was the only way Maria would be able to protect her. That here, Maria could easily throw herself in front of Howard’s fists, whereas outside these walls the threats were nebulous. Maria knew Howard, she could read her husband.
“I can’t do it, Nat. I can’t give him a baby. I don’t want to, and what if he…what if he hurts it?” Toni asked tearfully.
That didn’t make Steve exempt from his wrath, even if it was only thanks to him that Bruce wasn’t in prison. So when he came upon the scene in the bedroom, Bruce lunged. He yelled wordlessly as he literally ripped Steve from on top of a softly sobbing Toni and threw him into the wall. The doctor didn’t even pause to look at Toni. He simply followed Steve and wrapped his hands around his boss’ throat.
“We’re going out to lunch, and then we’ll go to that cafe with the little chocolate cake you love so much.”
He creeped into the room. It was only illuminated by the window off to the right. Peering into the crib immediately made his worry ease…somewhat. For there lying on a sky-blue blanket was Peter James Rogers. His little chest rose and fell with soft breaths. Bruce reached out and held a finger near the boy’s nose to make sure he felt the passage of breath through his nostrils. The boy didn’t stir. That was one vulnerable down for a nap. Now on to find the other.
“Hey,” she approached the bed and perched on the edge. Her eyes took in Toni’s huddled figure, hoping to perhaps catch a glimpse of what might be wrong. This proved difficult because Toni didn’t turn to face her. The girl was huddled under the blankets, only the barest slip of a silk shoulder strap peeking through. “What’s wrong?”
Bruce arched a brow, clearly unimpressed, though he did watch Toni flinch into Barney’s side out of the corner of his eye. Steve could probably be bleeding out on the street and still appear threatening to the poor girl. Toni’s hands were shaking. Barney wrapped one arm around her and took over packing with the other. Barney’s love for Toni was obvious. Maybe he saw reflections of his own mother in the girl. Or maybe he just had standards. The Bartons never seemed like the type of men to derive enjoyment from the pain of others.
No reply. So, they weren’t on the first floor. The doctor hiked his bag up higher on his shoulder. With any luck, Toni was sleeping, and her baby was doing the same. He could wait for them to wake. Except Bruce couldn’t simply trust the silence. He couldn’t blindly put faith in the idea that they were sleeping. He had to check for himself, see for his own eyes that they were fine.
“Good girl.” Maria finally pulled Toni into her arms and kissed her head. “Never forget that women, no matter the circumstances, always fight smart.”
Bruce walks in on Steve about to rape Toni but stops it. Violence as usual. Mentions of hypothetical non-con.
When attempts to text failed, she turned toward the Bartons next. Barney was out of town on a run, so he was of no use. The redhead didn’t even consider contacting him, because when it came to Toni, Barney had a bit of a blind spot. He could forget the job and get distracted, or just up and come home. That wouldn’t be good for anyone.
Robert Bruce Banner was known for and feared far and wide for his temper. A psychologist once told him that his rage was rooted in the abuse he suffered from his father. He thought it was the act of watching his father beat his mother day after day until he killed her. It could have been the drugs his father used to inject into him in order to test his batches. Bruce had never been completely all there…had never really developed healthy coping mechanisms. He used to have pet mice that would keep having babies. Bruce would drown them, cut off their tails, snapped their necks…it’d given him a way to work out his frustration as a boy. Now, Steve and the group provided him with larger mice to play with.
This entire chapter is set in one room, where Maria Stark is covering up bruises Howard gave her, and doing the same to a child!Toni. I really wanted to start this series for scenes I think are important to the overall story of Toni, but may not fit in the main story line easily. This series will show how Toni came to be who she is, and I hope more insight to why she makes the decisions she does. Also, quick shoutout to my martial arts instructor who always told me I'd have to "fight smart", took a spin on his words for the story, though I think it holds true.
Natasha balled up her hand. In the next moment, her fist made contact with his nose. She fucking hoped she broke it. The blond hadn’t been expecting it and fell back into his leather chair. She yanked him back up by his stupid silk tie and held a blade to his throat.
His grip tightened. Steve’s face was looking blue. Bruce aimed for oxygen deprivation so Steve would suffer and be forced to listen to him. Cutting blood flow to the brain was much too quick.
“But what I do know, is that your baby, whatever he or she may be, is going to be good, and kind, because they have you for a mother. You won’t let them grow up any other way, regardless of who their father is.” Natasha was sure of that. “And you have me, OK? You have people in your corner who will help you any way they can.”
“Stay still, sweetheart,” Maria instructed. Once she received the nod from her daughter, she began to gently apply the yellow concealer to the tender bruise. Every now and then she’d brush across a particularly painful spot, and Toni would wince. Maria didn’t have it in her heart to reprimand her. Her baby shouldn’t even have these bruises. She should be a better mother; be better able to protect her daughter. Instead she’d been reduced to this.
It had been a week since Toni returned to the house. Bruce tried to visit every other day, with Natasha on the alternate days. The delivery had been difficult. Bedrest wasn’t a recommendation. It was a requirement. They were also looking out for signs of Post-Partum Depression. Given the circumstances, PPD seemed more like an inevitability. Bruce had warned Steve about the dangers of continuing with his…rough treatment of the girl. While the Captain had mostly lay off during the pregnancy, probably because he learned his lesson after the first one; there was no telling how long he would hold off. Honestly, that was the source of Bruce’s motivation for being at the mansion almost every day.
He could faintly hear Toni behind him calling his name, but Bruce wouldn’t stop. Not until Steve got it through his thick skull.
“Next time he does anything like that, you do whatever you can to get out and come get me. Do you understand?” Natasha asked firmly as she braided Toni’s hair. They were sitting on the front porch swing. Finally outside to get some fresh air just as she’d promised. The girl needed it after being held inside for so long.
Because Maria couldn’t get Toni out of this. She didn’t think she would ever really be able to pull off an escape, or effectively turn on Howard. But she could do this. She could bolster her little girl and give her the strength and support she needed to make it through this life.
“What the fuck did I tell you!?” Bruce shouted. He reared back and slammed Steve’s head into the wall. “Huh!? What the fuck did I tell you!?”
“We’ll pack for Peter, then meet you at the car,” Barney said as he began to steer a silent Toni out of the room.
Toni carefully climbed onto the vanity with Maria’s help. Her little legs swung through the air, as she waited for her Mama to get everything ready. She watched her mother take out the magic yellow cream that made all her dark bruises disappear.
Anger flared. After everything she’d done for this girl, that was her response? “You’re goddamn right I’m not,” Natasha snapped as she stood up. “So I don’t have to fucking coddle you. Get up. Now.”
The girl looked up at Bruce, then her husband, and nodded. Once she went off to do as instructed, Bruce crouched down to look Steve in the eye.
Silence hung in the air. Natasha could tell there was more Toni wanted to say, but she’d do it in her own time. The redhead went back to braiding.
Without thought, Natasha gripped the blankets. As soon as the action registered, Toni began to twist around, opened her mouth to protest—but by then it was too late. Natasha yanked the duvet off.
“You pull shit like this again, and you’re going to regret it. Do you understand me?” she whispered, which was much more terrifying than if she had shouted.
“I bet some fresh air would help,” Nat cajoled. Her hand twitched, but she resisted the urge to stroke the girl’s dark hair.
“This is different. You know it’s different,” Natasha returned, voice still firm, like the parent she swore she wasn’t. She turned Toni toward her gently, then lifted her chin just like she had all those years ago. “What’d I tell you about that, huh? Keep your chin up—”
Walking up the spiral stairs always made Bruce remember the time Steve had thrown Toni down them. Bruce could never remember what made Steve do it, or what perceived slight Toni had committed, but the image of the girl lying sprawled on the white tile of the foyer was burned into his mind’s eye. Her dark hair had been matted with blood as the pool slowly spread around her head. Natasha nearly killed Steve when she came upon the scene. Bruce could remember that when Toni had recovered, she had to scrub her own blood from the tiles and grout between.
Bruce noted that the place was quiet as he stepped into the house. It was always more likely than not that the baby would be crying. Steve would be talking or yelling on the phone, or the TV would be on. The silence should have been comforting, but Bruce had lived too long and through too much to trust it.
“If you wanted to fuck her, you could’ve asked.” Steve laughed breathlessly as he pushed himself painfully onto his feet.
“You have to,” she said simply. Lies wouldn’t help Toni now. “He’s going to keep trying until he does. Steve’s vain. You know that. He won’t hurt a baby that’s his. You see how he treats the younger recruits.” Well, was the short of it. Toni never seemed to qualify for the same treatment.
His Adam’s apple bobbed—the only indication that he was nervous…and she knew why. Because they both knew that what she said wasn’t technically true. Compared to them, she was a child. Toni Stark hadn’t gotten a chance to experience much of life before she was shackled to a gangster. She was a damn teenager. Steve was thinking with the wrong damn head—in Natasha’s not-so-humble opinion—and didn’t even notice.
As the blond wheezed on the ground, Bruce turned to Toni. “We’re leaving. Pack a bag for yourself and the baby.”
The little girl looked up and grinned at her mother. Maria loved the light inside her little girl, that bright, shining...almost innocence, that radiated from her smile and her eyes. It was something she hoped the girl would keep, in spite of what life had thrown at her...and what it still might.
Holding her breath, the woman awaited an answer. She could hear the shuffling of blankets, the slight creaking of the mattress, before finally…
Maria had to close her eyes against fresh tears. The question was plaintive, innocent, weak. The mother forced her tears away and continued on in a soft but firm voice. “Your father…” she stopped and tried again. “Antonia, we are surrounded by very powerful men. Some are stronger than us, some are bigger, others are able to control others and get them to do what they want…” she leaned down and stared right into her daughter’s eyes. “But do you know what they’re not, baby? They’re not you. And you, tesoro...You are smart. You will be smarter than any of us. I know it.” Maria believed Toni would surpass even her father.
Natasha frowned. That didn’t sound like Toni at all. Normally she wanted to get out of this room. “Come on. Nothing fancy. Just me and you. We can hang out on the porch. It’s really nice out.”
The doctor’s face collapsed into utter disgust. He barely glanced over his shoulder at the other man.
Hello all! I know it's been awhile.I hope you enjoy this second installment of what is now a series! Warnings for this chapter include referenced/implied child and spousal abuse. Specifics can be found in the notes at the end. Please read the end notes for an important message.
None of her makeup matched Toni’s skin. She’d inherited the warm tan skin from both sides of the family. Unfortunately, Maria was prepared for this situation. Opening a drawer in her vanity, she withdrew the properly colored foundation.
Natasha didn’t announce that she was coming. She didn’t knock on the door, simply stormed in. Why give Steve any warning? It wasn’t like he’d told her what was going on. He’d had the gall to lie to her. He’d lied to her for nearly a week, had taken Toni’s phone…
Bruce took his time shutting the nursery door so as not to rouse Peter. The boy sweet, lying there in his crib. Perhaps if he were a different man, he would be tempted to reach out and pet his little tufts of dark hair, or stroke a chubby cheek with his finger. He saw Toni do it enough times. Even Steve seemed to be enamored with the child. That was probably normal for new parents. The strange thing was catching the Bartons doing similar actions. The way Bruce heard it, Clint and Barney had been the second and third people to hold the kid. Steve was too caught up in a shootout to be there for the birth. Bruce knew that fact ate away at the Captain.
Let him go? Didn’t she understand? He could have torn her stitches, caused another hemorrhage with his careless abuse of her body. Bruce couldn’t sit by and do
?” she snapped, voice breaking on the last word. She could feel the grip she normally kept around her temper slipping. How
When he turned fully around, daring to show his back to Steve, he found Toni wearing a (relatively, for Steve’s tastes) modest sundress. Anything was better than that robe. Barney’s arm remained around her shoulders, almost shielding her from his sight…though perhaps that was due more to Toni’s size than Barney’s actual intent. He looked every bit like the big brother he was.
Then a smaller, more hesitant hand fell on his shoulder. His attention snapped to that gentle point of contact.
The pair sat in silence and watched the rise and fall of Peter’s chest as he slumbered on, oblivious to the world state of the world he’d been born into.
Maria sat at her vanity, carefully applying layers to cover up the newest bruise along her jawline. Toni was playing at her feet, carefully taking apart a remote-control car, sporting a bruise of her own. Her cheek was an ugly, mottled mix of purple and blue. The bruises along her arms had faded to a sickly yellow, and Maria knew she would have to insist on a sweater, despite the city’s dry heat.
“You could have killed her. You can’t keep your dick to yourself!?” He was still screaming, he knew that…he just didn’t care. Steve Rogers couldn’t keep his hands to himself, had to destroy and hurt someone like Toni Stark to feel good. Normally, Bruce would stand by and only help when absolutely necessary.
If he tightened his grip just enough to end Steve’s life, the entire outfit would devolve into chaos. She knew that. It was probably why she had yet to kill the man herself while he was sleeping.
must be stronger, tesoro. Like iron. And you must fight smart.” Maria held Toni’s face between her hands. “Because that is the only way you will beat them. And you, Toni, will be able to beat them. You are strong enough, in here,” she gently tapped the girl’s chest, just over the spot where her heart lay. “And you are smart enough here.” Another tap to her temple. “To survive, and eventually, beat them all, do you understand?”
Steve chains Toni to the bed after she tries to run away. He's trying to have a baby. Toni doesn't want one.
“You must promise me,tesoro. Promise me that no matter how bad things are, or how many men you must fight, you will not give up.”
Thank you so much for your support for this story. Eventually I'll get a regular uploading schedule, but in the meantime I'm very grateful you all keep coming back. Some of you have been very observant in the comments, and have pointed out things that are either on the right track or 100% correct. I'm also thinking about creating a tumblr in order to take requests for stories you guys want that I may not think of in this universe. Please tell me how you feel about that.
Been a long time, I know. One of these days I'll get a regular uploading schedule. I don't know how many of you are reading this anyway. A chapter of ABAP should follow this relatively soon. Warnings for the chapter at the bottom notes. There's a lot more to Natasha and Toni's relationship that will be revealed as we go, but I had this scene in mind and it didn't fit naturally anywhere, so here it is!
Clint told her he hadn’t been allowed to go upstairs, because Steve didn’t want him getting sick and spreading it through the outfit. Nat could tell the boy didn’t like that. If she had to guess, he hadn’t listened to the order. Thick as thieves, Toni and Clint. It would be cute if it wasn’t so dangerous. Clint was around the same age of Toni, even if he hadn’t realized it yet. Then again, maybe he knew more than he let on. Regardless, Clint wasn’t telling her anything.
The Barton brothers stepped through the bedroom door. Barney took in the scene with a calculated expression. Poor, young Clint looked shocked and wasn’t doing a very good job of hiding it. Barney looked to Toni; took in her red-rimmed eyes her state of (un)dress, the angry red blooming along her jawline, and simply prompted. “Bruce?”
"Fairy Dust Frappuccino," he said. "As much caffeine as a quad espresso, plus sugar. And it's purple."
Taking over Steve’s bed had been a little rude, but it wasn’t like Steve wasn’t used to Tony being a little rude.
Tony had kissed him before. It was part of the image they were trying to present, and Steve had done his best to think of it as acting. It didn't mean anything, any more than two characters kissing in the movies meant the actors felt anything for one another.
"There are a lot of people who see my uniform and my shield and think that means I stand for the same things they do," Steve said. "The lawyers stopped the worst of the groups using my image for their marketing, but that doesn't do anything about the ordinary people who think I agree with their hatred of anyone who isn't just like them."
"Last night," Tony said. He took a drink of coffee to give himself a chance to think of how to phrase this. "Was I--no, wait.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Me too." Then he shrugged. "But he agreed that whatever it was that I did--I'm guessing the worst of it was after he took me home--we could pretend that it never happened, so he'll probably get over it."
Steve suspected that once things advanced a little further, he wouldn't have a problem asking Tony for what he wanted. It still would have been easier if Tony were here in person, but he thought his self-consciousness would fade as he got caught up in the moment.
"I'm not sure there's that much difference," Tony said, his voice low enough that Steve wasn't sure he was supposed to have heard.
Steve nodded. "I grew up thinking I would never have anything like this," he said. "At least, not in public. The best I could hope for if I fell in love with a man was something in private, a circle of friends who would understand. And now..." He shook his head. "We're riding in a parade. Tony can hold my hand in public, and nothing happens. It's hard to take in sometime."
"How was I to know?" Tony picked up some electrical component from his worktable and started fiddling with it. "You're from a different time," he pointed out. "I'm no historian, but I know that back then, we'd have had no choice but to keep this a secret."
This had nothing to do with any of Steve's personal feelings except the ones about being used as right-wing propaganda.
But nobody had been watching, and Tony had kissed him. Steve couldn't even bring himself to ask why, because he was afraid that calling attention to it would make things awkward between him and Tony.
Tony wondered if there was something he could add to the reactor in his chest that would keep Steve at bay, along with the shrapnel.
"The door was locked," Tony reminded him. "It was only public because you broke in." He smiled at Steve, and Steve thought about sunlight glinting off ice, felt a chill like water closing in over his head.
"No, I haven't been using the reactor in your lab to make popcorn. That was years ago," Clint said. "If anyone's been doing that, it was probably Thor."
"Maybe not," Tony admitted. "All I feel up for right now is a nap. But it's late and you like to wake up at the crack of dawn, so you probably need sleep, too." Then his grin took on a distinctly wicked cast. "And if you're right there next to me, think about how convenient that's going to be once when we're awake and well-rested."
They were only bruises. He got worse during team training. And they were a tangible reminder that Steve had been there.
There was still no answer from inside the lab, so Steve reached out to open the door. It wasn't like people didn't walk in and out of the lab without knocking all the time.
He was close enough to see the moment Tony swallowed hard, to hear Tony's breathing speed up, just the slightest amount. "You," he said.
They were also going to be aware that Tony wasn't straight, and Steve still wasn't sure what Tony was going to do about that, since he'd never said that he wasn't straight. He'd implied it, obviously, because he was in a relationship with Steve, but he hadn't said as much.
"Leaned on his shoulder in the limo," Clint said. "Actually, leaned on him, period. I'm not sure how drunk you actually were, but you definitely took advantage of that." He smirked. "Though I'm sure that whatever you did, it wasn't anything like what you very obviously wanted to do. Not that I blame you. If I didn't have Natasha, I might be doing my share of pining over Cap."
Tony checked the time. Steve hadn't looked, but he knew it was getting late in the afternoon. "Enough fun that I'd rather get dinner before we go home," he said.
He looked like himself; Tony looked like himself as well, or at least like he had the last time Steve had seen him. It had been several weeks now; Tony's hair would be longer, and his beard would be growing out instead of being carefully trimmed. Steve considered the drawing and wondered whether he should make those changes to the drawing, or keep Tony looking like he did in Steve's mind's eye.
Of course he did. This was a lie, and he didn't even have the one advantage Steve did--that this was at least a chance to live out a lot of his fantasy.
It was a small kindness, but it felt so intimate that Tony found himself holding his breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
He kept his mind occupied that way until Steve came back, carrying one of the baskets from the storage shelves, not by the handle, but with both hands, carefully.
It was a fair question, but Steve didn't even try to answer it. He snaked a hand around Tony's hip instead, wrapping his fingers around Tony's cock and beginning to stroke it.
"Tony, please," Tony said. "You're letting me put a picture of your adorable kid on the internet, the least I can do is let you call me by my first name. And, if you'll let me, send you the picture, before I blur her face." Then he paused. "Actually--Steve, you want to take her again? Let's give Mandy's moms a nice picture for her bedroom wall."
"Of course it's good," Tony said. "Did you think I'd pick out a bad wine for us?" But his smile looked genuine, so Steve figured that he hadn't actually insulted Tony's taste.
McLaren was still looking at him doubtfully, and so Steve added, "Sometimes people just aren't compatible. Maybe you're perfect for one another on paper, but there's just not that spark." Or only one person feels it, and the other person...
"Good," Tony said. "I know I told you that it's not bad here, and it's not. Nothing's attacking me, I'm not in any actual danger. Ultron's completely neutralized."
"That seems pretty cold." Steve picked up the last of the apple slices and deposited it on the tray.
But if Steve made things awkward, then this new, closer friendship might not last, and getting an answer to his questions wasn't worth that risk.
"There are some candles here," Steve reported after fumbling around for a few minutes in the dark. "I don't have any matches, though."
Sometime during his speech, Tony had come to stand beside him and taken his hand. It felt right to raise their hands up in the air at the end of it, and then turn to Tony and kiss him, there on stage.
And he wouldn't be in love with Tony Stark--Steve felt himself grinning against Tony's mouth at the thought--if he couldn't accept Tony's occasional distractedness, his tendency to get obsessed with his work, and everything else that seemed to go along with Tony's genius.
He was glad he didn't. Tony would have laughed; it wouldn't have been a problem, but it would have broken the mood, and that would have meant that he wouldn't have been able to hear the changes in Tony's breathing, the quiet sounds that told Steve that Tony was still thinking about how it would feel to be inside Steve.
Tony was at his most charming, too, reaching across the table to keep his hand on Steve's while they waited for their starters, keeping the conversation light and flirty and his attention focused on Steve.
Tony's bed, Steve suspected, would not have white cotton sheets. He couldn't be sure what it would have, though, because Tony sent most his laundry out rather than trust Thor or Hulk with it. Satin? Silk? Black silk sheets were in Steve's head as the ultimate in hedonism, but then, Steve's mind's eye did some judicious editing: Tony sprawled naked on red satin, the color setting off both Tony's skin, lightly bronzed from the sun, or at least from sunlamps, and the black of his hair.
Two seconds later, the kid shrieked, "CAPPAN 'MERICA!" and launched a tackle-hug in Steve's direction. They misjudged distance, though, and only Steve reaching out to grab them prevented them from face-planting on the ground.
No, the three large glasses of water, though one of them was mostly empty, and the one small bottle of ginger ale.
That was fair, given that Tony had never recanted his "I am done with relationships forever" bullshit, even though nobody should ever listen to something that a recently-dumped, extremely drunk, person was saying about love.
But of course the conclusions Steve jumped to were the right ones, because the universe hated Tony sometimes, at least where Steve was concerned.
It was going to be hard to come up with a statement for PR, even knowing that one of their social media experts would take what Steve said and craft it into something a little more eloquent.
Because there would be another time, he realized. There would be other times for this, and then when they brought Tony home--and Steve refused to even consider that they wouldn't be able to get him back in time--they'd be able to do this, and so much more, in person. They hadn't wasted the time they had. Steve hadn't lost Tony before he could say anything.
But Tony looked so pleased, like he really did want nothing more than to go for a walk with Steve, and Steve couldn't help but nod. "That'll be perfect."
"I just wanted you to know that I don't--knowing that you're still affected by what happened, it doesn't make me think any less of you."
Maybe they could survive here, at least for a while. There was a reasonable level of technology based on this shelter; maybe he would get to continue at least some of his work.
Tony was apparently planning to stay a while, since not only did he have a mug of coffee for himself, but he'd also brought one for Steve.
Tony's head tipped back slightly, a soft groan escaping him, and Steve kissed his way down Tony's jaw to his exposed throat. Steve kept his kisses light, not wanting to leave any visible marks on Tony; they weren't a couple of kids making out in the back seat of Dad's car. The thought of marking Tony was tempting, though. He should bring that up later, when he had more access to skin that wouldn't show under Tony's clothes.
Steve thought about telling Tony he was beautiful, but that still wasn't a thing men did, Steve thought, even when they did this without being afraid of prison and being ostracized, and Steve didn't want to ruin the moment by making Tony explain yet another thing about the twenty-first century to him.
"Peter's already finished with his essay," Gwen said, smiling at Peter over the top of her water glass. "Course he kinda has an advantage, having a living legend for a father who actually lived through a lot of the stuff that he wrote about."
"Ah huh. That's a good thing." He pressed his palm to his chest, running his fingertip along the outline of Steve's dog tags under his shirt. "Um… go ahead and show me how it fits into the case."
Her lower lip shaking, Gwen finally nodded, pecking Peter's lips again. "I love you too," she whispered. "Please, be careful!"
Steve shot him a frown over the wall of his shower stall. "Well, that's comforting. Do you guys always sit around and talk about me when I'm not there?"
"Uncle Bucky!" Peter shrieked, jumping back as lava-like flames suddenly shot up through the cracks in the floor, twirling as they rose up higher and higher until they had formed what could only be described as some sort of horrible fire demon.
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, his expression softening as he looked over at Steve, bathed in the moonlight streaming in through Peter's bedroom windows, the faint beams highlighting the lighter blond strands in his hair and causing his blue eyes to seem even more striking than usual.
"I'll find a nice spot on the low ground," Bucky said, his expression so similar to how he had been during the war that Steve nearly did a double-take. "And I'll take 'em out, one by one."
It was guilt that drove Dad so hard, Peter knew that without a doubt.  For as long as he lived, Dad would never be able to let go of his guilt for “allowing” Obie to do what he did to Papa and his team, no matter what else happened or what Papa or Peter tried to tell him.  Kind of like how Papa’s memories of what happened to him and his team would always be tainted by his own guilt.
Peter shrugged.  “‘Cause when I was in there, I noticed that his hands were shaking a bit.  And whenever he moved, he did it really slowly, like it hurt him.  So I just thought—”
"Well, that's for damn sure," Bucky said, knocking Steve with his shoulder as they made their way across the vast hangar towards the locker room. All around him hung the pungent smells of aviation fuel mixed with sweat as the grounds crew guided in the rest of the aircraft from their patrol shift. It was still odd to Steve how quiet the new aircraft were compared to others that he had test-flown. In the past he and his teammates would've had to practically scream at each other to be heard over the roar of the aircraft engines, but not with the X-301s. And based on what Anthony Stark had said during their class earlier, aside from the rocket booster that would only be used if they went into space, the X-302s were even quieter.
Steve's heart gave a flutter as he stood back up. For all of Tony's constant compliments about Steve's physical appearance, he thought Tony was absolutely beautiful, and even more so right after being thoroughly kissed.
Steve breathed in deeply, allowing the glorious scent to permeate throughout his body before turning his face just enough to press his cheek against the top of Tony's head, tightening his arm where it was draped over Tony's trim waist. They were both still naked, too tired and sated after their last lovemaking session less than ninety minutes ago to do much more than pull the covers back up over themselves and spoon together.
The man chuckled, clasping his clipboard with both hands as he gave a slight bow.  “Ah, yes, Captain, it appears that I must apologise for my own manners,” he said.  “My name is Doctor List.”
Steve woke with a start, shivering and panting for breath as the dregs of yet another nightmare faded into the near pitch-blackness of the room. Instinctively, he reached his arm over to Tony's side, grunting in frustration that bordered on anguish when he found nothing except for the cool, bare sheets of the bed.
.”  Peter had thought the name was clever when he’d first noticed it, and it sounded even more so now.  “And it’s a used bookstore, so there’s probably some really cool stuff in there.”
of his external oxygen sending a shiver racing down Tony's spine. Aside from his irrational fear of the dark, that godawful, evil-sounding noise was the one thing that he hated most in the world.
As it was, by the time they arrived at the hospital and Ma ran in for the wheelchair, Steve was closer to death than he'd ever been before. He could only recall a few moments of consciousness over the next several days as the medical people worked around the clock to loosen the thick, rock-hard mucus that had become lodged deep down inside his small airways so they could feed his oxygen-starved lungs. Steve shuddered as he recalled the claustrophobic oxygen tent, the eerie
Still, Tony would pretend to try, if for nothing else than to help ease some of Steve's mother hen-ing a bit. Tony's capacity to say no to his husband's pleading blue eyes was already past the point of supersaturation, especially when that damn worry wrinkle came into play.
Complete silence met his words, with both women staring at him for several seconds until Nebula glanced at her sister.
"No," Peter said softly, swallowing hard. "They can't… I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna let them have me."
Scott gave a rapid nod. "Yeah. My—my lady—well… she was supposed to pull me out. But when she got—she got—"
And, most importantly: as much as Steve realised that the Phoenix mission was going to both end the war and save their planet, it was also going to save Peter's life, and Steve didn't want that responsibility to fall on anyone else's shoulders. He was Peter's papa; it was up to him to take care of his child.
"Yeah, I am," answered Tony, rather petulantly. "I made some new adjustments to the hand lasers and a few other things that'd been bugging me. I also played with the colour settings a bit, made the red a bit darker. And you're getting a new uniform too, by the way. I'm experimenting with a new type of Kevlar blend that would offer a lot more buoyancy than the stuff I'm using now, so if you ever wind up in the water again you hopefully won't just sink like a rock, and—"
"That's correct, Captain Rogers," said Anthony. "At the moment we're finding that each core can last for about five patrols before it needs to be replaced. But since a potential space mission would be longer than your average patrol the Air Corps can't afford to run the risk of a core burning out, so there's another element that we'll be using as the core for those missions that doesn't have the same risk of burnout."
As for how many moments there had been since then, well, Tony was certain that he'd lost count a long time ago. And while that realisation was a bit overwhelming—and even more than a bit, if Tony was honest with himself—it was also liberating. It was, in a word,
"I usually pay someone to come over and work on the landscaping, but the last kid I hired got accepted into the university and I haven't been able to find anyone else yet," Steve explained. He opened Tony's car door, holding out his hand towards him. "Ma tries to do it on her own sometimes too, but she's getting to the point now where she just can't."
"It is pretty interesting though," Gwen whispered about a minute later, as they watched Cindy give a rather respectable speech on the physics of spinning baseballs and curvatures, which while not exactly answering the question at least used enough big words to hopefully confuse the judges if she were to get a similar topic during the competition.
"Mmm. 'Cause he just had to wait for them outside again, didn't he?" Tony had been afraid that would happen since Steve had left a few minutes late to pick him up, trying to wait for Tony to finish his conference call. When it became clear that it wasn't going to happen, Steve had asked Thor to accompany him instead, something that Thor was only too happy to oblige, as he'd put it. Thor and Peter had been spending quite a bit of time together since Peter's recovery from the water monster attack, with Peter teaching him how to play chess and introducing him to hockey, a game Thor had already grown particularly fond of due to all of the in-game fights.
“Yeah, I know.  You’ve gotta go,” Peter said, his upper lip curling into a sneer.  And he thought he was whiny.
“Ah huh.  Have you got your glasses?  Contact case?  Snacks?  Calculator?  Pencils?  Phone?  Your head?” Tony asked.  It was a rare week where he didn't have to run something or other up to the school at least once, but he supposed it couldn’t hurt to ask.
"Well, then how 'bout you just start at the beginning, yeah?" Tony prompted, as if he'd completely read Steve's mind.
!" Tony shouted as he was slammed in the back by yet another missile, this one managing to dent his armour. "JARVIS, how many more of these fuckers are there?"
"Exactly," said Tony. "But here's the kicker. In order to keep the Meridians from trying to sabotage the system—which, once they find out that we even have this device in the first place they're gonna be
And finally, after Papa had looked his team up and down, made sure that they were all prepared to fight the strongest creature in at least three universes, he gave the order to attack as one, single word.
Sam huffed out a sharp breath, nodding. "All right. Clint, you and Nat should take off ASAP, but make a couple stops on the way, don't be too direct. I'll get in touch with Stacy and make sure he's still game, then we'll all converge in Savannah once you and Rhodey get there. You got that drone firing range extended yet?""
"And that's all very noble of you, Mr Stark," he said. "But it still doesn't answer my question. How can we be assured that this serum is what it needs to be for Peter?"
Doctor List laughed, a sound that while under different circumstances might’ve been innocuous enough, only served to reinforce the million-watt pain coursing through Steve’s body.  Against his will, he let out a groan, clenching his hands into such tight fists that a bolt of pain shot across both sets of knuckles.
"Phoenix Three is clear!" Carol called over the comm, nearly bringing Rhodey to his knees. "What the hell's going on down there?"
"Here, Steve," Bruce said, pointing to the monitor where the translated text was now displayed. "We've found another connection to those names that we uncovered at the Mongolian bunker."
While Tony wasn't usually one for hyperbole, it turned out that the king wasn't joking. Aside from the five-course meal, which was incredible, the team was also treated to a traditional African dance performance as well as a fireworks display that would've put New York City's best New Year's Eve show to shame. By the time they had said all of their goodnights and dragged a half-asleep Peter to bed, Tony could honestly feel a few tiny trickles of optimism attempting to break through the solid iron wall of fear that had been building up inside him ever since the first space attack back in October.
"No, it wasn't Pete's fault, or our fault, and also why Pete hasn't been anywhere near George Stacy since then," Tony said firmly. "But we've had the girl over here twice now and she hasn't been any trouble, so while I think her old man is a prick with a helluva lot of pent-up resentment and envy, from what I've been able to find I don't think he's a direct threat as long as Spider-Man doesn't show his face anywhere in public again."
"And now it's all over the floor." Now that Steve could make himself move, he bent down to get the tray at his feet, then started to collect sandwich triangles and apple slices from the tile.

They'd taken today off from appearing in public. Steve had planned to catch up on some SHIELD paperwork, get in a good workout with the heavy bag, and read a book. After that walk, that was. "I was about to take a walk when you came in," he said.
Which was how, instead of his weekly not-a-coffee-date with Steve, Tony found himself in line at Starbucks with Hawkeye.
"The producers called me yesterday," Tony said. "They wanted me to join you for the second half of your interview. Which, I have to admit, is going to be really fun now. I guess that's why they wanted me?"
“Well,” Tony said, looking down at his workbench, “this is definitely not even a little bit embarrassing.”
