But here he is, with a belly full of butterflies. Even just thinking about Dean, even when he’s mad at him. It’s wrong for so many reasons: they’re not in the same friend group, they don’t have any common interests. Dean can be brash, and rude; and Castiel oversensitive. And every day Cas falls harder for Dean is only making it more difficult when he has to pretend to be just his roommate.
make Castiel at all jealous to hear. It doesn’t. Though, after being the only parent in her life for so long, it does take a little bit of adjusting to get used to.
Mostly, it's the football players. And Dean can’t tell whether that’s ironic or just cruel fate. But he does his best to ignore it, to avoid drawing any further unnecessary attention to himself more than the New Kid label has.
Later that evening, when Dean was holding Castiel's sleeping body against him in his bed, just before he'd have to wake him up to send him home for the evening, he received another text message.
She holds up her bow and raise some her eyebrows in what Cas imagines is supposed to be some kind of threatening gesture. He laughs heartily. "Thank you, Charlie. I'll remember that." And then, as a way of transitioning away from the topic, he asks, "And what about you? Is your lady friend coming tonight?"
He releases his breathe, and at the same time he feels a stray tear slipping from his eye. He wishes that it wasn’t like this. He wishes that Dean’s homecoming could have fun and normal instead of whatever depressing display this is.
he wants to desperately to add,
“You’re not going to stay single forever," she snaps. She extracts the cork from her wine bottle with a loud pop and slams it onto the counter. "Neither is Dean. How are you going to feel when he brings a new boyfriend to Thanksgiving? A husband? Another kid?”
It’s Dean who ends up initiating. After too many long seconds of stagnant air, hope pulsing in the space between them, he takes several big strides and seats himself next to Castiel on the bed. Not too close-- he leaves a few inches of space between their legs. But they’re there now: sitting in the same space, together. One step closer to whatever comes next.
Castiel’s breathe freezes in his throat. He blinks once, slowly. “You mean that?” he whispers, quiet as can be.
The sound of her voice is like a balm. Dean leans back against the brick wall of a shop and lets his eyes drift shut. “No, this is… this is a really good time.”
“So, is that a yes?” Dean whispers.
“No way,” Jo declared in her firmest voice. “No, thank you. Nuh-uh.”
That's Cas voice, but Dean doesn't know why--
He trails off and looks to the ground again, before snapping his head up so fast it makes Castiel jump. “Cas, you’re the only person who even fucking gets me.”
"How the hell are you?" he manages to sound halfway convincing as he asks. He can feel the hair on the back of his neck itching. His fingers twitch to scratch it.
"Dean!" Someone called out from back on the field, and he turned around to see that the game was about to start. He turned back around and smiled at both Castiel and Charlie. "You'll stick around?"
A devilish smile Dean had already seen too many times crossed Castiel's face. He hoped that when they woke up together in Dean's bed tomorrow morning, all of Cas' memories would be back and he'd kiss Dean like he hadn't seen him in a week. But for tonight... well, tonight they could have a little fun.
He stands on the street corner for a minute, bouncing back and forth between going in or just turning back around and going back to the beach. Luckily, it's just then that his phone starts to ring in his pocket, and when Dean catches sight of the caller idea, he heaves a literal sigh of relief.
But he did try to take Castiel by the shoulders, lead him gently to the couch.
Dean turns his head suddenly when the guy lays a hand on his arm. There isn’t anything necessarily threatening in the gesture, but something in it puts him on edge. It’s like a sense memory, calling him back to the night by the bus station. Like his body is reminding him to be prepared for the worst.
There's a series of creaks and groans from the stairs as John Winchester descends slowly, aided by a cane. Mary rushes to his side. "John, you shouldn't be up."
He finds himself wrapped up into a tight hug and lifted some inches off the ground. When Sam places him gently on the ground again, he looks down at Cas softly. “Hey, buddy,” he greets, with the kindness that Castiel has come to expect from his former-brother-in-law.
? Do you think I am somehow failing her?”
"Why don't you come and sit with us?" Jo asks sweetly of Castiel. "We can pull over a chair."
He shifts down, so his lips rest on Castiel's exposed neck and his hands on his running shorts. He wants to move his hand. To press in closer. It feels dangerous, and he's terrified, but he wants it so, so bad.
Dean is staring at his boner.
It felt like a breath of air fresh after too long spent underwater. Like the light at the end of the tunnel. He went back to imaging their every day lives with a pleasant hum, just like he had before they were married.
Dean was all to happy to see Castiel standing beside him. He instantly reached down to slide his hand into Cas’ and leaned in to dot a quick kiss on his lips. “Hey, babe,” he greeted with a smile, “did you have fun?”
. As if he’s being overdramatic somehow. It has Castiel sending a heated glare in his direction as he leans in toward Dean and spits his next words like a monologue.
Especially because of what day it was. Specifically, it was the twenty-fourth cold and snowy morning in January, which meant that it was Dean’s birthday. HIs eighteenth. The opening ceremony into adulthood, and the first day of the rest of his life.
Cas is standing by one of the potted plants in his thin trench coat, shivering. Dean shuffles toward him.
The second he opens the door, he sees someone leap up from the couch. Dean is tense enough that it makes him up, and Castiel looks much more apologetic than Dean thinks necessary. Dean stands in the doorway, nearly frozen, unsure what to say or do. That's getting to be an annoyingly familiar experience for him.
. Did Castiel do that on purpose? Sneak it in all quick like that so that Dean would barely even notice? Or maybe it just felt natural to him. Maybe he's been thinking of Dean like that since the beginning and just hadn't said it out loud until now?
Sam lifted his hands in a gesture of surrender, and was surely right about to come up with some witty retort, when a cry of distress came from Dean’s bedroom. Sam moved toward the door, but Dean stood to block him. “No, no, I’ll take care of it. I’ve got her from here. You can head out.”
He knows that. Objectively, in a very third-party kind of way, he's aware that it's among his options. Hell, he's always been a vocal supporter of a pregnant person's right to choose.
Soap. Tea. Dry paper and sweat.
“As friends?” he finally asked in response to the invitation.
“I just mean… you’re her father.”
As he’s walking down the hallway to his room, Castiel stops suddenly, remembering the weird way Dean had been standing outside the doorway. Like he was… waiting, or something. Castiel fears that he’ll open up the door to find his roommate waiting again, ready to ambush him for… he doesn’t know what, really.
"You're one year less a pervert now, huh, Cassie?"
His lips don't move, his feet glued to where they stand. His father approaches slowly. He's been weakened by the accident, whatever it was that happened to him.
Then he turned his affections to Ruby, placed a big fat kiss on her head, at which she sent out another happy screech.
“Oh, easy," Dean scoffs. "I was at my desk, and you were at the reception desk.”
“I find it soothing. I like a hot beverage. And it doesn’t have the same negative effects as coffee.”
Dean’s hands loosen minutely and his face move in closer to Castiel’s. Something like understanding comes over his face. “I know that,” he whispers solemnly, “I know you’re a good boy.”
He knows what he has to do. He just doesn’t want to do it.
so freely with a group of people. He couldn’t believe that it was him sitting there with these nice, wonderful humans. Couldn’t believe the way that sitting next to Dean could make him feel so damn carefree.
His inner monologue trails off when he turns toward the fridge and notices a note hanging there, stuck under their novelty magnets that reads
When she pulls the paper back, Dean is gone. Castiel doesn't let himself linger on that, instead spending his time complimenting his daughter on her perfect autumnal color scheme.
Cas can only sit back and be taken along for the journey, and try not to make himself look too foolish along the way. He unfolds his napkin and lays it delicately over his lap, smoothing his fingers nervously over the smooth material.  He can’t remember the last time he’d done something quite like this, if ever. Most of his restaurant experience was in places with paper place mats, or food served in buckets.
Dean runs a hand over his face. He looks down at himself and realizes that he still has nothing on but his boxers. "Listen, I gotta go."
Castiel turns to face her so that she can fully see the drama with which he rolls his eyes. “He is
Dean bit out a dry laugh. “Heh. We’re, uh, we’re talking about it.”
“I told Lisa," he said at last. He could have said more. He tried to, but it didn't seem like there was anything else that needed to be said.
When they disembarked the bus, Dean immediately followed the rest of the team where they were herding onto the field, while Castiel stayed at the bus to help unload equipment and water bottles. He didn’t get another chance to talk to Dean before the athlete went out onto the field- not that he would initiate conversation anyway, he’d been letting Dean steer that boat the whole ride up here- but he was sending positive thoughts his way the whole time.
“Don’t go,” she said again, “Stay here with us.”
. Sometimes she’d look at him and he’d think, that’s it, she knows, I’m done.
"Dean," John scolds, as if he has the right, "there's no need for dramatics. Don't attack your mother. Nobody made your life hell. You're just... emotional."
“Maybe they do," answers Castiel, scooting just a bit closer to him on the sofa. "But I don’t.”
And then it’s Dean. All of Dean, every inch, filling him up. The weight of it feels so perfect inside him, like not a day has passed. Like a part of him that's been missing for so long has finally returned home, Castiel bites down on his lip to keep from screaming, but then Dean lips are on his again and it's Dean who's doing the biting and shit that's even better.
Maybe he ought to let him know. Have Charlie find him and tell him.
“She needs someone to help her. To help you help her.”
She toys with the strings, pulling them back in towards her. “I saw Dean.”
He finds himself thinking back to his lunch with Charlie and Dorothy, just the day before. He’d been so distressed, so ripped-up inside at the idea of one-sided affections. It makes him feel giddy to know when he looks at Dean, his eyes must have that same hazy glow of affection as he’d seen between the girls. And when Dean looks over at him across the pillows, Castiel thinks he sees it there, too.
This added dimension to his daily life weighs significantly further on "curse" end of the scale than the "blessing" one. At least at school. But the one thing Dean can say for it is that, well, it's pretty interesting to get a hint at what his friends smell like. He supposes he'd been wondering for a while, but when he actually catches a whiff, it's a different experience altogether.
later.") but only long enough to scold him for it ("
Castiel hems. He appears to be delicately trying not to say something. Finally, he offers, "Do you want to go to a hotel first? We can get a room?"
“See ya,” Castiel begins to say sullenly, but Dean is already walking away. He’s not sure what he exactly wanted from the interaction, but it seems like that didn’t really seem to work at all.
“Are you from the area?” Mother cuts in. “Does your family live here, that is?”
There’s always that latent threat when Alphas are involved. Even though Dean bets he could land a mean punch on this asshole's jaw if he needed to.
Cas listens. He bites down on his lip to stop the words from coming out, perhaps a bit too hard. Cautiously, Dean stretches over his hand and run his thumb over Castiel’s mouth, coaxing his teeth from the lower lip. Castiel blushes, embarassed that Dean’s seen so much of his self-doubt already this evening.
He holds Dean’s gaze for several seconds and it makes him feel both complete and shaking with fear.
And why not? That is, Ruby was never biologically his. He didn’t have any obligation. And, at the beginning, she hadn’t even been his kid. She’d been his boyfriend’s. So he’d been stuck on diaper duty and bottle service, with none of the benefits of getting to call her his own.
California
Cas bites off a moan. Even as angry as he is, he can’t deny that it feels amazing. Dean's hard length resting there on his leg-- and even more, the knowledge that his is him,
“I think you’d better ask your lover-- or, your fiancé about that himself,” she cuts him off, insistently, and pushes him out the door of the barn. He goes to turn his head around one more time, to beg her to clarify what she’s said-- but before he can, he’s back out in the road, and the door has been slammed in his face.
When he feels a finger slide inside of him, the world around him narrows down to a pinhead. His fingers grip tight around the fabric of Dean’s shirt, tighter than they should be but Dean only bites off more encouraging dirty words and god damn how does he still have so many muscles under there? Cas feels a momentary itch to run his tongue over those muscles, the taut feel of his flexed bicep--
"You're a real sweetheart," he mutters, barely acknowledging the beta before turning towards the desk where Castiel is working. "I was thinking of maybe going out somewhere. Do you... wanna come?"
There was nothing that had ever turned Dean on the way it did when the omega underneath him moaned him name and begged him please. Jesus, he’d never even thought of himself as the dominant type. It wasn’t like he was any stranger to dirty talk, but with Lisa it was never like this. Fuck, it had never been like this.
TBH could be better, sad we didn't see Dean at all, and overall I think it's a pretty short chapter, but I just wanted to get it out to you people and be done with it!
is here and he's standing over Michael and he's seething at the mouth and his fist is cocked up in the air and... What? Dean needs to breathe.
“Why do you want to marry me?”
Cas barely has time to register the words before Dean is gone, the sound of the door’s loud slam the only thing left behind him.
“Dean,” announced his very favorite baritone voice as it suddenly appeared beside him. “There you are. Finally, I’ve found you. This place is a labyrinth.”
"Alright," he said, sad to be walking away, "I’ll see you after. Wish me luck?"
Absently, he hears Balthazar order a few things: some are words Castiel has heard, and quite a few more are ones he has not. As soon as the waiter takes his leave, Balthazar  swivels in his chair and reaches smoothly for his wineglass. He raises it in cheers and Castiel follows his lead.
And, maybe, how abruptly it could all change back.
Castiel freezes. He averts his eyes immediately. “I-I’m terribly sorry, I didn’t… I thought…"
He doesn't actually have to pee, but he takes his time in the bathroom anyway. He's done all kinds of poking around in the bathroom between his bedroom and Castiel's, and the one at the end of the upstairs hall. It's not very good manners, but Dean had been hoping to stumble upon a pill bottle or something with a name, anything that could give him a better clue of the story behind this house.
and what have you. He thinks the slightest nudge from Dean and he might just turn into a crying mess.
If he wasn't doing all that stuff with Cas, who would he do it with? He can't think of any one else who seems half as appealing, not Gabe or Cassie or even Sammy--
It wasn’t nearly as fun, but it was still pretty alright in his book.
about what Cas has to say. When he reaches his phone to follow up on those leads, he feels a swell of satisfaction inside him. And he pointedly tries to ignore the grave way that Pamela glances at him every so often.
Dean looks at her. She's so earnest, it's almost hard to hold her gaze. "Yeah. Cas got me enrolled as soon as we got out there. It's good- I mean, it's school, so it's really just alright. But I have some friends there- Jo and Ash and Benny- and I like seeing them everyday."
(-----)
He spent a lot of long, lonely nights wondering why he ever left Ben and Lisa. Why he couldn't have just stuck it out, pretended to be happy. It'd be better than this useless existence. Better than shuffling from barstool to barstool, looking for something to make it all matter. To make anything matter.
It's at this moment that the front door opens wide and Dean has to make himself scarce to avoid being seen. He watches from down the road as the two women exit the house together. Their heads are bowed closely in to one another and Dean tries his best to catch the expressions they're wearing. Do they look hopeful? Depressed? Dubious? Evil?
He’s pregnant.
Dean raised his eyebrows and laughed. “You know, believe it or not, I’m actually a pretty good boyfriend.”
Plus, it has been a good long time since he’s been drunk, especially with Cas being such a stickler for the whole “legal drinking age” thing.
Dean rolls over and groans into the pillow, much like he had about the freckles. Castiel lays a hand on his back and tries to seem supportive. He has to say that he's finding Dean's answer even more confusing. Eventually, Dean pulls his face back from the fabric and speaks. “It’s just so embarrassing. And you’re gonna think I sound like a dick.”
upset. Like he’s the idiot to let himself be tricked by some unfeeling jock asshole for the hundredth time. God, what was he thinking? How could he have let himself believe…
Cas sighs to himself. This is how it’s been for the past week. On the surface, it doesn’t seem weird. In fact, Castiel isn’t even sure if Dean is acting any different than his usual aloof self.
"Back to the Future?"
Dean’s fingers paused on the keys and he pursed his lips thoughtfully.
"Is that okay?" he asks, his voice straining to be soft. Dean feels his heart settle in his chest when he hears the way it sounds. The panic fades, and in its place is a yearning to be as close to Cas as he can bare. He answers by grabbing his face and pulling it in for more very-good open mouthed kisses. Cas takes the lead, which is something Dean is not used to. He likes it. He likes it alot.
Annoyance builds in him. He scratches a hand absently at his arm and approaches the stove, where Dean’s pancakes sit in a neat little stack on a plate beside the pan. Castiel stares at them for several seconds. He’s hungry, but the thought of eating what was meant to be a romantic breakfast for two makes him want to puke.
He didn’t think his dad meant it that way, but the way he said it made Dean feel all kinds of emotional all over again, so he just went for it and dove it for a hug from his old man. He clasped him tight, real tight, until his dad’s hand repeatedly tapping his shoulder let him know that it was time to let go.
Anyway, everything had been great and perfect. Dean hadn’t made him dance (yet), and the food wasn’t nearly as bad as he’d feared. All in all, it was a Saturday evening that was-- shockingly-- actually an improvement over staying inside by himself.
"Thank you, Dean," he says quietly as he reaches over to take Dean's hand of the steering wheel and entwine the fingers around his own.
“Yeah,” Sam shrugged his loose commitment and leaned over Ruby to peer at her more closely. “The nose.”
“Dean?” he says with a certain wariness as he approaches. “How funny to run into your here.”
He wished his resolve was stronger. He wished that he’d stared at the phone for days, wrestled with himself, until he finally broke down. But that wasn’t the case. Instead, he’d texted Cas the next morning, after Lisa had kissed him goodbye and told him to have a good day at work. He couldn’t wait to see him, scent him, touch him.
"Shit, man," Pamela scoffs loudly, "I love my kid but sometimes I gotta do things just for me."
Most of his co-workers are other omegas, a lot of single moms. Which is cool when you think about it. He overhears them talking alot, about how hard it is to find work, how at their other jobs they get talked over or pushed down or, even worse, felt up by alpha creeps- and he’s glad that someone’s giving them a job where they don’t have to put up with that crap.
Dean moves in closer and pulls the covers up close to his chin, whispering, "Yeah."
"But," she says, and his ears perk up, "I can offer you a tincture that has been proven to lessen effects of heat and reduce scent output."
That felt nice. Cas calling him brave… that felt very nice. In a warm apple pie on a Sunday afternoon kind of way.
“Alright,” he relents after a moment’s thought, his voice timid and shy as he does, “If you say so.”
Dean had reached out a hand and raised his eyebrows, which Castiel had realized after a moment of slow processing was meant to ask,
“I don’t know!” he finally snaps, “Can you please sit down and finish your homework?”
“Cas?”
He shouldn’t be surprised that Anna’s cancelled, and maybe he isn’t; but he is disappointed. He’d really been looking forward to tonight. Hannah’s off at a sleepover at a friend’s house, which is lovely and great, and he’s happy that she’s having fun… but it’s not the same as when she’s just at Dean’s. As silly as it might be, he worries.
But Cas doesn’t mind. He’s had her all to himself for a long time now. Still, he can’t say he isn’t pleased to see that she wanted to talk to him so badly tonight.
This will be the fifth man who’s tried to win his hand in as many months, and not a single one has even so much as piqued his interest. He has no reason to believe that this “gentleman”, so he claims, will be any different.
“Thanks,” says Dean sarcastically with a roll of the eyes, “that’s really reassuring.”
But, it’s also strange. A very sudden, very major shift in the way their relationship, in the way Dean has always acted toward him. Here Cas is, saying things he’s always wanted to and doing things he’d long ago written off as impossible. He should just stop thinking about it, be grateful for this moment… but, somewhere in his stomach, floating around with all the butterflies and the bubbles-- there’s a sense of something else. An acknowledgement of the abruptness of it all.
The way Dean smiles at him when he pulls away, Castiel thinks he just might like it, too.
Of course not. He pulls the lid off of a pot and stabs a fork into it’s contents. “I’m trying to cook dinner.”
If he hadn’t want to discuss it this morning, when there was hope of a clean resolution, then Castiel has absolutely no interest in discussing the sordidness details of his firing with Dean now. He heaves a heavy sigh and shakes his head, directing his gaze across the parking lot instead of at the man across from him.
So, he keeps his thoughts on Gabe to himself.
But he'll still think about the letter.
"That you do." Cas nods and kicks his feet at Dean under the table. Dean kicks back and tucks into his stack of bacon, smiling around his fork. Unfortunately, it's only a few minutes later that Cas sighs and pushes back his chair, telling him, "We ought to go. You want to be on time this morning."
“No, that’s alright sir. That is why I’m here after all.” He clears his throat before he continues, locking his eyes right onto Castiel’s. “I don’t have much, but I feel what I do have is more than enough to provide you with a good life. I’ve got a blacksmith shop that’s been quite successful over the past few months, what with the stand at the market like you saw yesterday.”
“Well, my deepest condolences. She’s passed away.” And after waiting a single beat, Missouri commenced on, saying, “Now this little girl I’ve got next to me…”
“Did you know that Jo used to have feelings for you?”
While Dean pondered that for a moment, Castiel turned to the funny, red-headed girl and waved a hand between her and Dean. "Dean, this is Charlie, from my psychology class. Charlie, Dean, my boyfriend."
Dean was about to scoff out loud, like that title has somehow superseded ‘boyfriend’ on the marquis of his life. At that very moment though, a squeaking sound appears in the doorway to cut him off, and he turned around in his seat to see a six-foot-tall mess of balloons reading “Get Well Soon”. Dean sighed and leaned back in his chair, feeling deflated beyond words.
“I need to go to bed,” Cas cuts him off. Now he’s been rejected twice in one night and that’s more than enough for him. Even his back-up doesn’t want him. Fuck.
Cas is just about the toss the bracelet onto his desk and leave it there, when an engraving on the underside of it catches his eye.
“Um, duh," Dean retorts playfully, "You’re a great roommate. You’re clean and you shower regularly. Honestly, I kinda wanna spend all my time with you anyway, so… it’s just easier.”
“I’m thinking about…. next year," Castiel admitted in the middle of a sigh. The way all the air left his body in one fluid movement left him slumped over. He finally turned his head to look at Dean, and his expression was so distressed that it instantly threw Dean off his game. “We’ve broken up once before Dean, and though it may sound melodramatic, it was in fact the worst week of my life. I have no desire to repeat that feeling.”
He hadn’t even had a god damn conversation with the guy yet. He was afraid to. Afraid that they would get to know each other, and he’d be even more perfect than Dean was imagining, and then he’d be shit out of options, wouldn’t he?
She barely waits for Castiel to wave her in before she strolls in casually to the living room and plops herself firmly onto the couch. “So, spill,” she tells him with an attitude that says she's not here to mess around.
Castiel decides to believe him.
And it was fine. It was good. Just as good as any other date Dean’s ever been on. Not that they’re so numerous, because hey, he’s only sixteen so it’s not like he’s had all the time in the world to go scoring babes.
But, he's in the clear for now. With Jo focused on her own work, Dean feel comfortable enough to open his text thread with Castiel.
That’s fine with Castiel. He understands that Dean’s hurting. He needs time and space to come to term with the fact that he and Cas are really, truly not going to happen again.  Castiel is more than willing to give that to him. Better that tun Hannah see something pass between them and start asking questions. No, that would be no good at all.
Yes, Dean just does whatever he wants and expects everyone else to be happy with the results. Did he ask Castiel if he might want pancakes? No, of course not.
Okay. What to do not? At best, he probably has a few seconds before Cas sees him (or, more likely, smells him). Maybe he can switch seats with Jo so his back is to the door, and then text Cas begging him to go home, or oh! He can fake an emergency-
They pulled into the parking lot at nearly nine at night, and Castiel was surprised to see that he was actually feeling a little… disappointed. He’d enjoyed talking to Dean on this long bus ride and, since the other boy would be graduating soon, it wasn’t something he foresaw happening again. He was just about to say as much when Dean turned around and locked eyes with him, suddenly focused and rather awake. “How are you getting home?”
Castiel’s lips crack into a wide smile. He’s a family man. Sentimental. That’s a very attractive feature in a prospective husband…
Hell, even during the day it's harder. Dean catches himself all the time losing focus when Castiel is talking, his attention trailing off while his eyes trail down to one spot or another on the other man's anatomy. Not anything gross, obviously, but like.... his shoulders, or his chin, or his eyebrows. They're all so strong. There's something about it that Dean can't quite put words to... but, for whatever reason, he isn't quite as repelled as he was before.
Cas is gay. Of course he is. He told him that the very first day they met.
Actually, this might not be so bad, after all. Cas could use a little time to himself. Being a working parent is exhausting, and a single parent at that.
That much he knew. That much everyone knew. However, having had no romantic dealings himself during his tenure as a high school student, Castiel had neither the necessary experiences to compare upon nor the desire to understand.
Yes, Castiel surmised, that must have been it.
pictures of him and Cas together on there. He stood up next to the bed and leaned over to give Cas a good angle as he began to swipe.
"And do you know what exactly happened?"
Why is he like this? His boyfriend goes away for a week and he crumbles into this weak, sad little thing. He’d been doing so good lately. He shouldn’t…
mean in cash.”
Castiel leans down for the doorbell handle and feels his shoulders slump. “Let’s just get out of here and I’ll explain everything.” He waits patiently for several seconds, and then, “Dean?”
Then again, it might be more like his second favorite.
Though, that’s not exactly right. Because the way Charlie watches Dorothy: that the way Alfie watches him. Or, at least, he thinks it is. He’s seen those puppy-dog, lovelorn eyes before.
"Well, I just got off the phone with her and she said that it actually just reduces symptoms and lessens your scent output."
Actually, he recalls with a terrible suddenness, that’s not even true. He has a job interview tomorrow. It’s not a place he particularly wants to work- a grocery store chain that pays a whopping ten bucks an hour- but it’s something. It’s a start. And Dean’s pretty sick of sitting around of waiting for things to start.
He can’t say that Alfie is the best kisser he’s ever come across: he’s overeager with the tongue, Cas thinks, and he hasn’t quite figured out what to do with his hands. There’s also this strange, loud noise that he makes from time to time, which would probably just be a moan if it didn’t sound so much like a whimper.
She stops fawning over the newly-returned jewelry for a moment to look up at him.
Dean doesn't think Gabe is a bad guy. Probably not, at least. He seems even funny, sometimes, when he's not annoying the piss out of Dean. But the way he's staring at him right now... he looks like he's trying to melt Dean with his laser vision or some shit.
But now he’s here. A million miles away from where he'd pictured himself today.
Not that he had much time to ponder it, either way. He was so busy with Ruby, and Sam had exams that he was focusing on. And now Dean was returning to work, which meant that he had to find someone to watch Ruby in the daytime.
The warmth is spreading all over, now from his toes to his fingers. He spreads his fingers on the rough material of the bedspread, just to have something to do with them.
Ideally, he would have woken up with his boyfriend in his arms, and the smell of bacon grazing his nostrils, and he’d feel like a changed man. As it is, he’d just like ten more minutes underneath the covers.
His hands search for Castiel’s. When they find them, Dean began to stroke his fingers over Castiel’s knuckles. It feels so,
Cas does, at the end of the table across from Dean, as the other members of group go about introducing themselves. He smiles at them, nervously, ready for someone to make a snarky comment. No one does. The last one, Ash, does his southern-drawled self-introduction, and they all turn back toward each other and go back to discussing the score of some sports game from the previous night.
Amelia pauses for a second. She narrows her eyes in his direction. "You said you were sixteen?"
That's probably a good instinct.
Castiel only
A breathe of air leaves Castiel like he's been punched. A change of subject. That's nice and welcome. “Yes. We can play whatever you want.”
On a table beside him, his cell phone started playing the chorus
https://blueskies-and-applepies.tumblr.com
Cas closes his eyes, wills himself to fall asleep. He hopes that Dean will go. Leave the apartment, give him time to wallow a bit longer, try to make himself better.
It's only now that he realizes how completely wiped he is. It’s been a long week, physically and emotionally. He makes himself a bowl of cereal and watches exactly one hour of
Cas demurred at the attention. He was almost blushing if Dean could see correctly. A rare feat that made Dean rather enjoyed seeing, truthfully.
He chews on his lower lips, trying to sort everything in his brain into its right place. What's right and what's wrong; what's true and what's not.
Cas stops walking and pulls Dean in for another long, much-waited-for kiss.
Castiel sighs. He’s been thinking for days of the right way to phrase this. “I just think that I was… scared, when I woke up. I was hungover and I wasn’t thinking right. And then I got back to my room,” and saw how Dean was acting strange and maybe a little jealous, “and it just became clear to me that I was being silly.”
"Wait!" Sam comes running up behind them. "Don't go."
Another opportunity to take care of Dean. Cas is already standing up, moving to find his shoes and put them on his feet, when Dean grabs his arm and shouts, without preamble, “No!”
This Charlie girl was a little weird.
Dean smiled wide. He didn't have words for whatever feeling Castiel's words provoked in him.
Gabriel remains undiscouraged. “You two? Sure. I’m just accustomed to a certain amount of sexual tension in the house ever since you came in.” His eyes light up in that dangerously playful way. “Helps me get my fix now that Dr. Sexy’s on hiatus.”
coming with
Dean tries to cover up his surprise, but doesn’t do very well. Castiel can’t blame him. He himself wasn’t exactly expecting the make the offer, but, well here they were.
“No, sir.”
All his energy now was pretty much reserved for one guy. Dean figured, Cas had single-handedly turned him from a pathetic sad sack into somebody who actually
Dean furrows his brows in confusion. He's not really even sure what Cas means by that. Dean knows how he feels. Why would that change?
“Jolly.”
“Things are great,” he responds at last, hoping that the smile he offers isn’t too shaky, “I’m so happy at the
And Cas. Poor Cas had been scared shitless of that thing. Dean wanted to get him out of there, wanted to keep him safe and protected. He was so pissed at himself for agreeing to bring Cas there, for letting his big, blue eyes make Dean forget that people here thought he was normal and didn’t know anything about shit like this.
“You know,” Cas said, and there was an air of wistfulness about him as he turned to look Dean in the eye, “I almost want to ask you about her. I know that’s a terrible idea, but...”
Cas exhales out of his nose. "Yes, dear."
Hi hi hi! Sorry for the looooong delay. I've had some big changes in my life recently (wish me luck!) and haven't had a ton of time for writing. I've lost my motivation with this one a little bit, since in my head I finished it a long time ago and have since started on some other threads I'd like to spin. I'm not in love with how this chapter turned out, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on how it goes and what you think should happen next.
It’s true that the majority of students here are upper middle class in a way that makes Dean realize for the first time in his life how far in the lower end his family had been. They were always comfortable enough, sure- but these kids waved around their fancy gadgets and sporty cars the way Dean had shown off his Pokemon cards as a kid.
Secretly, Castiel had hoped that Dean would stop by their room before he made his way over to the hockey house, so that he could casually make it known that he would be there too with friends of his own. But, no such luck.
Dean tries not to be too flattered by the comparison. But it's hard.
"Tell me you want me," he says to his mate.
And he certainly won’t mention Balthazar.
He turns his head away and bites down on his lower lip. He’s starting to understand what Cas was saying about how excellent this will be, the three of the crashing together.  Maybe coming here was a bad idea. It wouldn’t be surprising, Dean’s pretty much batting .1000 when it comes to shit decision-making skills.
Drink in hand, he settles into the living room. Maybe he’ll pick out a movie to watch. He’s got a few good documentaries in his Netflix queue that he’s been meaning to get to. No better time than the present, especially since whenever Hannah is around there’s a strict Disney-movie-only rule (enforced by her, of course).
“Cas, that’s perfect. I mean, this weekend… It was so good. I want it to keep being that way. I just want everything to be exactly like that.” His eyes bug out when he seems to realize what he said, and he quickly goes to correct himself. “Except not just in the room, I mean. We can eat lunch together, and dinner. And I’ll take you to parties, except I know you don’t like parties, but maybe sometimes--”
“Dean, I’ve never-”
Cas seems to accept that. He takes his time to ask his next question. "And... how about... how you left things. When you... last time you saw them."
Man, how things can change. Now he all he wants is to keep his head down and get through this day without anyone taking special notice of him.
“At home in bed with mononucleosis.”
"Yeah."
“Do you… read?” he tried to ask, and wanted to slap himself in the face almost immediately for sounding so stupid.
It isn't a perfect love speech, but it's endearing enough. If Castiel had been listening, it surely would have given him butterflies despite the mild sexual content and the awkward fumbling of Dean's words.
“Are you sure?” he asks.
Here we go then. “I have a kid.”
"Listen, if it's Ash you're embarrassed of, that's complete fair," Jo tries to tell him as they cross to where the busses are parked.
The words registered in Dean’s brain, but they’re drowned out by all the thoughts of his own that are racing around like it’s the Indy 500 inside his head. He saw himself setting out of the road in this car, sunglasses on his face, good tunes on the radio. The wind coming in fast as he sped down the highway; one hand on the wheel and the other, on the bucket seat, gripping Castiel’s fingers where they curled around his.
“Oh!” Cas squeals, offended. He untangles himself from Dean and shoves the other boy down on to the mattress, but before he can make his escape, Dean’s hands come for him and pull him down as well. They laugh until it turns into something else, until their legs are tangled and their breath puffs out in little bursts and Castiel can feel a firmness pressing into his thigh that makes him emit a deep moan.
He turns away to take a bite of his sandwich while Dean eases back against the pillows.
”Are you sure your nose isn’t broken?”
Weeks later, on a sunny Thursday afternoon, Cas is lying in his bed again, and this time he’s not alone.  He’s got Alfie lying besides him, their bodies tangled together in a mess of elbows and knees.
A beat goes by while Castiel tries to ward off the tears from his eyes.
The girls are in Hannah’s room, together, hanging posters and Castiel in the kitchen going through the drawers, when the doorbell rings.
"You can't."
Well, not
“No," he spits out as soon as he finds his voice again, "Definitely fucking not.”
Listen. He’s not dumb enough not to notice exactly
And the most frustrating part is that Dean somehow can’t see that. He’s got these rose-colored glasses on, looking at the world like all you need is love, and it’s... stupid. It makes Castiel seems like the villain, like he's just got some stick up his ass and a vendetta against love, whereas Dean is the romantic foolhardy hero who's convinced that everything could work out just perfectly if only Castiel allow himself to feel.
Castiel dissolved into an extended coughing fit. The most dry, barking sound came from his chest. Dean quickly grabbed the cup of distilled water sitting on a table next to the bed and handed it over. Castiel took it without thought and proceeded to drain it in seconds.
But still, it wasn’t enough to make Castiel think that they wouldn’t make it through. Sometimes they shared a laugh or a look, and it warmed Castiel on the inside, felt like they were right back to their old ways. And the sex, those rare times when they did tumble into the sheets together, was still as good as ever. They might have had their problems, Lord knows they did, but sex between them was never anything but perfectly mind-blowing, as far as Castiel was concerned.
look convinced. He stares into the camera, a grimace on his face, jaw set on edge. Slowly, the look or horror starts to melt away.
Oh no.
And now he is. All alone.
The million words are gone more quickly than they appeared. Cas' head is empty now, working only in quick pictures and flashes of memories, and a building sense of fear that has his throat closing up to both air and sound.
Dean stares into his cup and doesn't talk to anybody for a while.
Time seems to have been doing something strange ever since Dean came to California. Or, maybe it's since he met Cas. He's not sure he can pinpoint exactly what it is, but he's pretty sure that the days are chugging along at double speed out here in Palo Alto.
“Go ahead, drink up.” Dean sat back down in his chair, but kept a hand on Cas’ leg. He didn’t like the idea of being too far away right now. “How you feelin’, bud? You in pain?”
“Hi, Alfie?” he says over the sounding of his pounding heart, and he can hear that he’s practically panting with excitement. “I was just thinking a lot on my walk back to my room, and I think I was being hasty before. I think a date sounds great.”
So he's not saying anything, and neither is Sam. Both of them are waiting for the other one to speak, Dean imagines. But Sam called him. He must have something he wants to say. An apology? Just checking in? Making sure he hasn't been kidnapped or killed?
Cas' face turns placid, smiling as the grip on Dean's knee tightens briefly. "I only meant to answer your question," he says, and withdraws his hand. He takes a breath. "I think one day you might know what I mean. I hope you do."
Yes, he does. Why does Dean know that? “Well, I wasn’t planning on it,” Cas answers casually, almost too casually, “but then Alfie convinced me to come out.”
She yelped as she flew upwards and Dean immediately had to shush her so as not to wake Roman. He was getting down much easier now, but still no reason to risk it.
It’s conflicting, the way he feels right now. His first instinct is to pull away, to make himself physically independent of Dean, the object of his sadness. And yet he’s so vulnerable, all he wants is to be curled in Dean’s arms.
His voice is tortured when he answers, "I don't know."
Cas rubs at his eyes once, certain that sleep has bled into reality, and that this is actually just a dream right now. To be certain, he coughs out, “Dean?”
He looks up to Charlie with a broken smile resting on his face. She’s got a smile as well, but hers looks real. Happy. “That sounds nice,” she says in a soft voice.
Something strange happens to Dean then. He looks momentarily like he’d been shocked, physically shocked. It’s gone as fast as it had come and then he says, “No, nothing. Probably just gonna go home and watch Netflix or something.”
Far behind her, Dean watches Cas get settled into a large comfy chair. He's still facing Dean. Which gives the omega opportunity to try and read his features a little more closely, just to make sure he's okay. No way he'd tell Dean if he wasn't.
Honestly, he needs much more comforting from that than from Sam's bombshell about his dad.
to my place, it’s not a command-- I just mean. If you want to, you’re free to come over to my apartment and charge your phone.” He throws in a smile that Dean finds begrudgingly… pleasing. “I have multiple wall sockets.”
Every time he rattled off something of interest, Dean would repeat it excitedly for Castiel’s benefit. “You hear that, Cas? They got their own nature preserve. That’s pretty cool, huh?”
Castiel jumps back, startled by the noise. “Fuck,” he mutters to himself; partially as a reaction to the fright, and partially out of annoyance. Beside him, Alfie has gone about as red as a firetruck.
“Hey, man?”
Dean leans back in his chair, seemingly relieved. “Okay… can I cook you some pasta?”
There’s a futon and a pillow, and he feels his shoes being remove from his body. Then it’s eyes closed and lights out, and even as he’s falling into the abyss of sleep, he wishes to himself that he never had to wake up.
And then one day he was at the gym, sweat pouring of him as he jogged a steady rate on the treadmill, when he caught this scent. It made him whip his head up so fast so that he lost all track of where he was and he almost fell flat on his face because of the belt moving underneath him. He darted his eyes all over the room to find it, seek it out, and there were suddenly all these thoughts at the front of his mind telling him things like
"Huh."
Cas' gaze is wavering, but he's trying to present a solid front. Dean wonders to himself how long the poor guy had been sitting here, practicing this speech. A while, he figures. Probably a long while. So, Dean lets his keep going, lets him talk without interrupting, even though his eyes go wide when Cas talks about their "bond" and their bones (and secretly he wonders is Cas isn't maybe less concerned with bones and more concerned with
“He’s my little brother.”
He’d be intrigued to know how he looks through those eyes.
Words are strangled inside Dean's tight throat, but he's trying his hardest to give her some level of comfort. "I was-"
Ruby suckled on the end of the bottle, and as she did her little body relaxed in Dean’s arms. Her eyes grew soft and sleepy, and after she’d drunk half of the formula he’d prepared, he put the bottle down and started walking around the apartment, bouncing her gently in his arms.
Cas leans in for a kiss. It brings Dean the exact comfort that he imagines was intended. He exhales a sigh of relief, filling nostrils with Castiel's scent. It's strong today, heady. The alpha is feeling protective.
He casts a glance back just once to make sure that Dean is following behind. He is, albeit with mismatched steps and a bewildered hunch in his shoulders.
At one point, when Charlie steps off to go make herself another lime green concoction, and Castiel is feeling particularly frisky, he tugs Alfie into him and dives in for a kiss that is equal parts sloppy and sweet.
.” He shudders when he repeats the name and it forces a laugh out of Castiel.
Cas could be funny about sex. He wasn’t like Dean, who was always down for it, any time, any where, any weather, whatever. Cas needed to be in the mood. Which Dean didn’t mind, not one little bit. But sometimes it could get confusing, when Dean thought the way to fix a problem is with a little fooling around, and he ended up being way, way off-base, and normally made things worse.
In any case, he wandered from stall to stall, perusing the many fine wares of local farmers and artisans. To Mr. Turner for his butter, and to Miss Moseley for the salves his father would be needing in the upcoming days after the harvest.
And it’s no accident that they are all meeting here, under these circumstances. Cas had chosen this spot for his render-vous with Alfie because he knew Dean picked up shifts when he needed money. He had wanted to sit in another server’s section, so that he could at least try and keep up the veneer of subtlety. But when they arrived, all of the other tables were full. Oh, well.
The sigh that comes from Castiel is one of the most relieved sounds Dean has ever heard. It borders on sounding happy, joyful, which Dean didn't know was possible for a sigh. “Well. I can’t say I’m not glad to hear that.”
I like about you?” Dean spits back with a smirk.
“Yeah, yeah," Dean waves him away, far more focused on his beverage, "whatever you want is fine.”
, don't make him barf.
And there we go. "Yeah, anyways," Dean barks out gruffly, "So you've met. Jo, let's leave Cas alone now."
He had a few people in mind; but that, of course, meant telling them about Ruby. He still wasn’t ready to drop the bombshell to everyone all at once. So he was working his way through the list one by one. Today, he’d invited Jody over to introduce them and see if she wouldn’t mind pulling some babysitting shifts.
But, come to think of it, he shouldn’t be surprised at Dean’s choice. He’d live in a shoebox if he could; one room with a bed and a TV and he’d be set. Back when they’d lived together, it had always been Castiel who was interested in decorating, in making a home out of the places they found.
Just as he enters, a pleasant smile sitting on his face as he notices the way the natural sunlight floods in through the windows, Anna turns to him with a look of annoyance painted on her face. “Cas, can you please explain to Gabriel why we don't eat quiche with our hands.”
This was supposed to serve as something of an apology for her behavior at the Thanksgiving dinner a few weeks ago. They were now past Christmas, of course, but things had been so busy between work and Hannah and everything else, he hadn’t gotten to have much one-on-one time with his sister since she’d essentially told him off on Thanksgiving.
He wishes he were better at using his words. He would tell Cas all of this, if he knew how. But he gets messed up. The meaning gets lost and confused and leave Dean altogether. So he prefers action.
"Yeah. See you at home."
“It’s a mess,” he says honestly, directing Dean toward the kitchen. “She’s got so much stuff, I don’t even know where to begin putting it all. It makes me wonder how it all fit into that shoebox I was living in before.”
They loaned him a car seat, and then Missouri buckled it in for him after watching him struggle too long to figure it out. Dean checked the straps, and then re-checked them, because he didn’t know how these things worked and babies seemed really fragile.
Dean didn’t even want to attempt an answer for that, so of course he deferred to his husband.
Jo gives the air a notable sniff just before they leave the counter. This earns her a look from Dean, so she admits, "I didn't think she was your Alpha, but I thought it was worth a check."
So it's somewhat bolstering to know that Sam had been, in a sense, Team Cas. But still, he feels guilty that Dean's seemed to be made out to be the bad guy in all this. Even though it was
The one thing keeping him from launching himself out the window is the peace of mind that his door can lock. At least he doesn't have to see another human before he's ready.
He didn’t know why he was asking. He was not going to leave here with a kid today. Whatever her deal was, wherever she ended up, he wished her a good life. But he had a good thing going in his own life for the first time in a long time and he was not about the throw a colossal wrench into all of that by bringing a fucking
Fuck.
“You know what, Cas?" Balthazar spits out suddenly, his eyes finding their way back up to Castiel's face, "I think it’s best that we cut our losses here.”
Cas scrunches his brows. “Weren’t….”
family."
“Dean?”
, he tells her with his eyes. She nods, as if to correct herself, and clears her throat.
It probably has nothing to do with him, actually. It's how they look at everyone, like if they can have it then they should have it, by right. How people so dumb could get such big fuckin' heads, he has no idea.
Two gentle knocks on the door. Dean panics, but realizes he must have had the good sense to lock it behind him. "Dean? I'm worried that you're mis-"
He stomps his feet over to the one box that seems most important in the moment, labeled FRAGILE in large letters. “Now,” he says, holding up two wine glasses in his hands. “Be a good sister and open that bottle of red I was saving.”
But then he’d think about Castiel and he’d psych himself out and put the phone down and it all went back to the same place.
His jacket is still on and has suddenly become the most annoying obstacle in the entire world. He pulls back to yank it off and toss it violently onto the floor. Tearing himself a way even for a second drives him wild and he turns back around fully intending to make it up to Cas. However, the look he finds on his partner's face is not one of unquestioning consent.
Dean had a stomach ache? "Drink some water. There are other beverages besides whiskey and coffee, you know."
He was looking Castiel up and down again, and Castiel was glad that it was dark since he felt a strange heat in his face that he would like to keep obscured. “You think so?”
Dean is commanding. He’s tall and all muscles and when he looks at you it feels like you’ve been chosen, like you have this special spotlight on you where the whole world drops away. Castiel knows all this from experience.
John stands in front of Dean, and it's clear from his posture that he's trying to make himself bigger. Sam's got to be edging him out terms of height, or at least getting close.
“I’m so glad you decided to change your mind, Cas.”
“Lit, lit, lit,” she taunts. “It’s fleek. Am I hip yet?”
That's bizarre.
The blush returns, much deeper his time. Lisa looks back down to her bracelet. “Um, no,” she mutters, obviously embarrassed. “You must be thinking of a different girl.”
What if he couldn't be bothered to stay anything at all, and just hung up?
Twenty-three seems very reasonable to Cas’ seventeen years. Older men have made younger brides, many times over.
“Jealous? Of what?”
When Dean was gone, Cas fell into a depression like he'd never experience before in his life. Typically, he was a pretty happy-go-lucky kid, his general outlook a pretty positive one. He tried so hard to enjoy his senior year of high school with the friends he knew he wouldn't get to see much of once they'd all left for college. But it wasn't easy for him. Every minute, every thing he did, he was wishing that Dean could be there to share it with him. He would have traded anything to have his boyfriend by his side. He would have worked two or three extra jobs to give him the money he needed, if that was an option.
"Hey," his gruff voice croaks out, and Dean does not shiver at the sound. "You're back."
Finally, after what feels like an eternity of not-waiting, Castiel sees Dean leaving his little friend group and making his way toward the living room area. Just as their paths are crossing, Castiel stumbles backward just enough to make Dean collide with his shoulder.
An instantaneous feeling of joy floods into Castiel. He grips his phone tight in one hand and smiles into the camera. “Well, hello, my little munchkin,” his voice sing-songs, “To what do I owe the pleasure of this phone call?”
Dean struggled to understand it. He himself was such a people person. He craved camaraderie, craved a group and a sense of community. He couldn't figure out how someone could be so able to survive without that net.
“Oh yeah, it’s great.”
And yeah, the whole thing made him feel kind of stressed out, too. He had no idea if the two of them would end up in the same school, or even the same state. He didn't know what it would be like if they were confined to texts and phone calls; didn't know how he'd get by without being able to hold Cas and hug him and kiss him whenever he wanted.
That feels like a personal dig, and Cas winces. He doesn’t know what he would give to hear Dean say these words. He imagines it for a moment and it makes his stomach go a little crazy.
Now it’s Castiel’s turn to turn bright red. God, he always finds a way to make himself look like a jackass somehow.
The way that Castiel said his name just then had butterflies fluttering in Dean’s tummy the whole time he was walking to the parking garage. It sounded sweet on his tongue, like he was just a little bit nervous to say it. It reminded Dean of their first date, the hours he’d spent rehearsing in front of the mirror.
Jealousy.
Dean rolls his eyes, but doesn’t take his gaze off of his computer screen. A few seconds pass, and Castiel thinks maybe the conversation is finished. Then Dean speaks up again.
” he replies with a tiny little smile peeking out from behind his mug.
Dean shoots him a look that is definitely meant to be glaring. "Excuse me, I practically could have died from all I drank last night."
He doesn’t know; and frankly, he doesn’t even want to start investigating for fear of what he might turn up.
He answered her in a shrug. “Maybe. ‘s possible.”
“You sure?”
“I’m twenty-three years old, sir,” answers Dean with the utmost respect. He jerks his eyes in Castiel’s direction, his shoulders hunched.
Cas laughs and rolls his eyes. “I think if I have to eat one more PB&J, I’m gonna barf.” He gives a light tug on Dean’s hand. “Come on, I want some real food.”
The waiter returns then, carrying platters of different sizes on which rest many delicate morsels of food. It takes them out of their discussion, Balthazar turning his attention to ordering dinner (a seared ahi tuna for him, and a duck confit he insists Castiel is going to adore). He orders another bottle of wine, which seems silly since they’ve only just opened this one, but Castiel doesn’t argue.
But Cas waves this off. He won't let Dean be made to feel embarrassed. "Oh, that's alright. I know how private Dean is."
“I’m an asshole,” Dean says it like a confession, wringing his hands. “And a dick, a
The bedroom door swings open, and Dean only pulls Cas tighter against him. Victor's head pokes in and sighs disparagingly. “Jesus Christ, you two. You know, you’d be so cute if you could manage to keep your hands off each other for five minutes.”
Den goes cold. He'd been feeling so good here, so comfortable in a way he hasn't really felt anywhere else in a while. He'd liked pretending that  "...what's he told you?"
He raises his eyes and finds her staring at him curiously, playing with some unidentifiable kitchen toy that he’d mostly likely bought and never used. Or that he’d gotten as a wedding present.
Thanks for sticking to the end with me! You've got an epilogue coming your way, fingers crossed that it will be out relatively soon!
This is good. Everything is fine. Castiel is repeating the words like a mantra in his head, but still somewhere in the back of his mind he feels an acute sense of dread. It’s just that this has been…. so easy. Just a quick morning-after conversation, and Dean is ready to throw everything else out the window? It sounds too good to be true.
“I can’t blame you,” he muttered, curling up into himself. “I felt the same. It’s… it’s not your fault.”
But there's hope, since Cas immediately backpedals as soon as he looks at Dean, and he even manages to get that kind of shy, embarrassed look about him that Dean swears he's never seen on an Alpha before in his life.
But God he wants him to.
want to marry me?”
He stays silent for a moment, attempting to conjure up the energy to have another one of these conversation. She’s getting so smart, it seems like there’s another difficult topic to cover every week.
He hurries to pick up the menu in front of him. He doesn’t hear what Alfie orders (too panicked) and he himself just chooses the first thing he sees: a bacon cheeseburger. This choice makes Dean quirk an eyebrow in his direction (something he wishes didn’t give him butterflies the way it does), but nevertheless he tells them that their food will be out soon and walks away.
Cas turns around, only mildly irked by the sound of Alistair’s grating voice. As far as insults go, that’s far from his worst, and Castiel’s got bigger things to worry about at the moment anyways. “Can you make this quick, Alistair? I’ve got a lot going on and I don’t have time for your toxic masculinity complex right now.”
Sleep evades him pretty much the whole night, which leaves him feeling more agitated that usual in the morning. There's no breakfast in the motel so they stop on the road, and Cas literally forces Dean to eat an apple in between his pastries, which makes him grind his teeth in annoyance. But he also orders Dean's coffee just how he likes, so he finds it in himself to be forgiving this morning.
Cas swings back into the living room from the hallway, pulling a jacket over his shoulder. He quirks a wry smile at Balthazar. "Are you ready?"
He turns away and opens the passenger's side door before Cas can say anything else. He slams it shut again and marches across the lawn, propelled by the fear that if he stops now he will never manage the courage to come back. He notices, some weird distant part of his brain remarks, how the front garden is more vibrant that he recalled.
"I'm Castiel," he says then, his chest puffed out just a bit, "I'm a friend of Dean's."
Hannah glowers in Dean’s direction and tells him in a low voice, “It’s
“Sorry,” she apologized as she pulled back from him, “I know I'm not allowed to baby you anymore.”
It’s so intimate that it makes Castiel shiver, but it doesn’t feel good. He wants to pull his hand away, yank it back-- but he knows how that would hurt Alfie. So instead he just leaves it, lets Alfie stroke his finger over the skin there even while it makes Castiel feel almost nauseous.
“Hey,” he whispers. “I’m taking off. Thanks for everything.”
They could move back home. They could get a little house in Pontiac, with more windows than their sad little off-base apartment, and enough room to talk about maybe having another baby. Cas talked to Hannah about the endless opportunities all day long; and of course she understood none of it, but it made him happy to tell her anyway. And it made him happy that he felt happy. It had been much too long since he'd been acquainted with the feeling.
When he looks up again, his guest is looking at him sort of like... well, sort of like he's crazy. Which is pretty fair. "Okay but... what about you?"
“In fact, I can’t think of a single thing anyone has that you don’t that I would want in a boyfriend.”
"It's fine," Dean tells her. It's not, and she knows it, but there's no use in making her feel worse.
The look on Dean’s face changes as he twists a bit under the sheets. He lowers his eyes and swallows audibly. “Lots of stuff,” he mutter, practically to himself. It’s obvious that he’s uncomfortable, but Cas pushes a little further.
Obviously, he wasn’t going to give himself away. The only thing worse than Dean finding him crying like a little baby would be Dean finding him crying like a little baby
The other boy rolls his eyes. “Of course I do. You’re smart, and you’re gorgeous. And you’re funny and shy, and you’re nice to me.” He smiles up at Castiel, and the bad feelings start to dissipate, just a little. “I don’t know how anyone could not want to date you.”
Suddenly, an arm is wrapping itself smoothly over Castiel’s shoulders, pulling him in towards Dean’s body. Cas allows himself to be maneuvered, until his head is resting on Dean’s shoulder and Dean’s hand is stroking lightly the exposed skin of his arm.
He wonders from the serene look on Sam’s face if maybe his former brother-in-law is thinking something along the same lines. Best to let the whole thing drop. No use lingering on the past.
Castiel hears a jingling sound and looks down to realize that he's shaking the keys nervously in in his hand. He gives a quick jerk to his head and turns around to lock the door once more. "Yes. I'm ready. Let's go."
have to eat at some point eventually.
A pleased smile sits on Dean's lips. "Huh. That sounds like some territorial peacocking, Mr. High and Mighty," he contends, barely containing his laughter.
"Mm," is the response.
Already Cas wants to stop him and interject, but he holds himself back. Best to let Dean finish on his own. Cas keeps his lips sealed tight and nods for him to continue.
An angry clattering sound came from another room and both Bobby and Dean straightened to attention. The older man regarded Dean again, his eyes softer at the edges. He tightened his grip on the gun in his hand. “You get your ass out o’ here and you run right back home.” He peered over Dean’s shoulder. “And you get that boy where he belongs.”
The air in the room has grown thick, even Cas’ breathing feels too loud. He hates himself. Hates himself for making Alfie feel this way, and especially for that stupid kiss last night. He knows firsthand that playing with feelings is a dangerous game, that people can really get hurt that way.
“Right now? I don’t really know.” It's true. He wouldn't even know how to start describe the mess inside his brain right now.
"Somewhere else," says Dean, unwilling to give her more than that.
For a minute, she pauses, and Castiel is left with brows furrowed, wondering. And then, in the most natural tone, she continues, “Because I really love pop corn. Maybe that’s why.”
Not that he'd know. The farthest he's gotten from Pontiac was to an army base in Texas, and then he'd just ended up right back here again.
Dean sits up and fixes him with a glare right back. A long stare-down ensues. Long and silent. The blood rushes is Castiel's ears as the seconds tick slowly by, the only other sound to be heard the far off bass of music bumping in a place where people are having a much better time than them.
Dean doesn’t even bother to tell him ‘okay’ or ‘whatever’ or ‘that’s none of my business because you’re just my roommate and I don’t give a rat’s ass where you spend your mornings’. He just takes the bottle from his hand and then walks away. Grabs a bowl and the first box of cereal he sees (which of course is some sugar-overdose crap thanks to Gabriel) and then goes to sit down at the kitchen Island.
So, the next morning they head to the San Jose airport. Cas had proposed driving back to Kansas, if that was what Dean wanted to do. But he couldn't stomach the idea of two entire days worth of anticipation. Flying, they'd be in Lawrence by the afternoon. The sooner they get there, the sooner the endless knot in his gut will start to untwist itself, hopefully.
Well. That wasn’t exactly a question Dean wasn’t expecting, but he had hoped to at least get a few more days to work on his answer. Who knew kids could be so observant? (He did. He knew that very well himself. In fact, if he’d learned anything from fatherhood, it was that his daughter picked up on every little tiny thing he did, and because of that he’d learned to be considerably more careful.)
His first instinct is to panic, but there's some sort of override trigger that stops him short. Panic isn't something he has the luxury to do. Panic is a self-indulgent action; he has to keep a level head, to figure out the best course of action for his family.
He wasn’t exaggerating. The chemistry between the two of them was
So it begins.
Dean absolutely could not wipe the smile off of his face. "You take him as much as you want," he assured her.
Dean slides a few steps to his right, waving Cas over. Castiel follows, and then they huddle in close so that Dean can whisper. Cas is so excited he can feel the blood rushing to his head, and the way his hands are shaking minutely.
He should have seen this coming from a mile away.
The wait between that admission and what comes next feels relatively normal to Cas, even though it can’t be. In reality, it can’t be more than two seconds before he hears the rumble of a low “oh, fuck no” and the metallic creak of the car door being opened and slammed once more. His heart leaps into his throat at this point, and his eyes open in a flash to see Dean storming rather determinedly back into the building.
Jesus Christ, this is some next-level bullshit. Dean is definitely going to have to sort whatever this out, and sooner rather than later.
And now here he was, buried balls deep in some man who he’d never seen before in his life.
A voice has popped up behind Castiel. He turns his head just in time to see his sister walk up beside him. She’s wearing a neutral expression on her face, but he knows her well enough to see that there’s something lurking beneath the surface of her cool facade.
She raises an inquisitive brow.
He thanks her, and promises to keep her filled in on the situation as it develops. Jesus, the thought of any other developments makes his head spin. He grabs at his sneakers and slips them back on, already missing the soothing chill of sand between his toes as he lifts himself up to start his trek back to the house.
He wants to say something snarky, a comback that’ll really make her think. “It’s cold outside,” is what comes out lamely, instead. Damn it.
So for right now he'll snuggle in a little closer and keep his hand on that muscular thigh.
It only takes a pause of maybe thirty seconds before Castiel speaks up again.
He remembers feeling this way before. When he was a teenager, when everything was still new and anxious and his future unsure.
He sighs again as he raises his head to meet Dean’s eye. Cas doesn’t want to lie to him. He doesn’t want to keep anything from him, either. Just as in their discussion the other night, he wants to start things off with a clean slate for them.
He tosses the phone onto the table beside him, ignoring the insistent
It occurs to Dean in that moment, in a horrible awful crash, that he never told Sam that he would be coming home. He didn't tell anyone.
It occurs to Castiel a few seconds later that he actually doesn’t know which “old times” Dean is referring to. Does he mean deployment, when Cas was calling as his husband? Or after, when he’d set up the camera for Hannah and then walk away, try to make it without actually having to see Dean’s face, if he could avoid it?
Benny's been on him a lot lately, asking for questions. Who is this alpha? Does he treat Dean well? Why is his smell almost... papery?
His cheeks had gone into a deep flush that he wished to high heaven he could have ridded himself of. He felt more foolish than he could say right then-- he’d never acted this way in front of a man before. Never met a man who compelled him to act this way before.
When they'd met, more than a year ago now, if Castiel had said those words Dean would have recoiled, run away, thrown up or punched his lights out. Possibly a combination of all four. Now it elicits a very different reaction. It's low burning and deep. Sure, it pleases Dean on his most basic molecular, evolutionary level that Castiel desires him. Of course. But there's a tenderness there. Something that makes his heart stir more than his loins.
Each time he did, he found that enticing man staring at him wherever he was; with a look in his eye like something Castiel didn’t know about, but
Dean is still hesitant sometimes, and Castiel maybe even more reserved. They go in for small touches, fingers looped around each other when they sit side by side, thighs grazing against each other in bed at night.
He opened his mouth to speak, at last, and the words came out as a sad, distant croak. “I… I can’t, Lisa. He’s my true mate.”
If the stakes weren't so high, he thinks, he wouldn't be so nervous. But they are. His whole life hangs in the balance here, and it makes him feel terrified to make a move.
"Okay, okay," Pamela withdraws her hand from him and pulls back into herself. "You don't have to decide right now."
Angers stings through his body at the lost opportunity. The fact of losing something he's worked so hard for, through no fault of his own. Or perhaps it is his fault, for being too trusting. For not listening to the warnings. Either way, he is where he is now. He's hardly the first person this has happened to, and he won't be the last. But the bitterness sits on his tongue as he stomps across the floor, only vaguely aware of the eyes that follow him as he goes.
"Sooo? What's your deal?" She leans in to him, increasingly curious. "You know, aside from the fact that you're-"

John nodded. “I’ve got to go eat up all that bacon your mother saved for you, anyway.”
When Balthazar’s voice cuts off suddenly, it takes him by surprise. He hones his eyes in on Balth's pupils, follows them down his own body, and for a panicked seconds he wonders if his boss is shamelessly ogling his crotch.
“I ended things, because…” Cas struggles, trying to find the right words for what had happened, “because I didn’t think it was fair to him.”
He did pay attention though when Dean made a crass joke about the some of the research centers they have on campus ("I'll show you some
They get hooked up with a sensible mid-sized sedan, which Dean is not allowed to drive even if he bats his eyes at Cas real nice, but whatever. After several moments wandering the parking lot with the key in hand, pressing on the "unlock" button and squinting at every pair of tail lights, Castiel finally locates their vehicle. He smiles triumphantly at Dean, who does his best to muster something that looks at least placid.
Dean had figured, when deciding what he should do in regards to bringing a boy he definitely had a crush on into a house he knew to be housing at least one angry phantom, that the idea wasn’t without its upsides. After all, if Cas got a little scared, he’d probably need someone to cling on to. Maybe he’d want to wrap around Dean’s arm, or even just to hold his hand would be pretty nice...
“There’s no reason to go throwing words like
"Duh. Hence the escort." She tugs him along with a surprising amount of strength, and Dean has no other option than to allow himself to be lead away. He has to admit to himself, though, that part of him likes something in this chick's attitude. There's an annoying persistence that reminds him a little of the way he used to be, before. "And just so you know. My name's Joanna Beth. But you'll be callin' me Jo by the end of the day. All my friends do."
When finally they get to the bakery section, Hannah turns to Castiel with bright, pleading eyes. “Go ahead,” he tells her softly with a nod and she detaches herself from Dean to run off
Dean smirks mischievously and keeps his hand exactly where it is.
Dean pursed his lips, considering this. “Mono. That sucks.”
Dean can feel his nostrils flare immediately, for at least ten different reasons, but he doesn’t know this guy and beside that he should probably at least try to be nice because that would make Castiel’s life easier on some level. But still, he doesn’t like being written off so easily, so he bares his teeth in his best effort to impersonate an alpha.
Dean sighed and leant back, looking very much relieved. “As friends,” he promised.
“Hi, guys, my name’s Dean I’m gonna be…. oh.”
Jo scoffs. "Yeah, I'll bet. You're a shit liar, Winchester."
Dean and Cas each got a few weeks off from work to get settled, but eventually Dean had to go back. Cas had decided to take an extended leave, to stay home with the kids and get settled into life with the new baby for a while longer. Neither of them liked the idea of a nanny, and it made things easier for Ruby after school, too.
Dean nods, that look of earnest dedication set in his jaw. “For you, I am a man of my word. Always.”
She perks up significantly at the idea. “Can we watch it in your bed?”
“I suspect he’s having more fun than I am,” Cas griped in a low voice, mostly to himself.
He’s doing just that-- pressing his thigh insistently into Alfie’s crotch, a soft moan just breathing past his lips-- when the door flies open in a sudden, wild fling.
Not that that's any of Gabe's business.
But all the while there was something that couldn’t quite let him enjoy the moment: two shadowy figures plaguing his vision, wrapped around his heart.
