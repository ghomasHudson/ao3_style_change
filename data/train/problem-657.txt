John was overwhelmed with thoughts of actually hurting someone, punching a nose and hearing cartilage break, kicking a torso and feeling ribs crack, pulling a trigger and forever stopping cruel hands from hurting Sherlock ever again. It flooded him with rage and he realised that he was gripping Sherlock’s shoulders too hard. He loosened his grip and smoothed his palms up and down, to remove whatever pain he had caused.
Ah. Fighting anger with passive aggressive levity. A classic Watson tactic. He’d best join in, then, Sherlock thought.
“Why? If you don’t mind me asking.” John finished his latte. He was still thirsty and the beers in the fridge looked very tempting. They were low-alcohol, so they wouldn’t count, would they?
Once they were done, Sherlock turned off the lamp in the window, picked Rosie up in his arms and stood back from the tree to let her take in the sight of the tree glistening in the dark.
“Dr Watson is currently out of the country with Sherlock. They have just solved the case, so I expect him to return to London soon. It would be best if there were no alcohol available at home when he arrived. Someone needs to go to his house and get rid of all alcoholic beverages for him and I think it would be best if you did it, since you know him so well.”
Sherlock turned around slowly and John’s hands fell awkwardly to his sides. Sherlock put down his empty whisky glass and stretched his arms out in front of him. There were thin, spidery marks around his wrists.
He hadn’t had that dream in a while. He hoped this unexpected recollection would not trigger it tonight.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “You’d better pour me a whisky then, John. Let’s see if the age old ritual of two men, a fire and two glasses of distilled, fermented grain mash can keep my facial muscles mobile.” He bent down to start the fire in the grate.
“Dr Watson is going to assist my brother on a case of a sensitive nature. They are going to have to attend a very formal dinner party and he will need a dress suit of impeccable fit. Sherlock has arranged for him to have it fitted at Ainsworth’s at twelve o’clock today, but I am afraid that Dr Watson’s innate
“Me too, John. I never would have expected to feel indebted to Mycroft for anything, but I will always be grateful that he made this possible for us.”
“No, don’t,” he said. “It will be nice for Rosie if she has another nightmare and wakes up. She’ll be able to see the lights from the top of the stairway if she comes looking for us.”
They looked at the Christmas tree for a little while longer. “When is Molly and Lestrade arriving tomorrow?” Sherlock finally asked.
“They will pick Mrs Hudson up at twelve so they should be here at half past. I’m not sure when Mycroft arrives with your parents, but the food will be here at a quarter to one.”

Sherlock closed his plush lips around the edge of the cake and took a delicate bite. His eyes still locked with John’s, he chewed and swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing slightly. Then, he opened his mouth for another bite.
It came over him, that he couldn’t stand another night sitting in his chair, watching Sherlock read or think or play without stopping for food or drink, worrying about when the man had eaten last, watching the the angles of his cheekbones grow sharper. Hands shaking, John snatched the kitchen drawer open and pulled out a knife. He cut a wedge of the moist, dark, sticky cake, grabbed it and walked back out into the living room. “Here. Eat.”
“Yes, if you would be so kind. A car will be waiting for you at 11:45 to take you to Ainsworth’s, and it will take you back to work afterwards. There will be lunch sandwich and a drink for you in the car.  If you wish, the driver can arrange for a coffee for the drive back. You will not be able to take coffee at the tailor’s, unfortunately. Mr Ainsworth is very particular about food and drink in his shop, but this dedication to precision and quality is what makes him such an excellent tailor.”
When Anthea knocked on the door ten minutes later, Mycroft had made a decision. The best way to keep Sherlock sober, was to keep John Watson sober.
John went to his chair again. He didn’t even remove his jacket. Had he forgotten, or was he not staying long enough to take it off? He was sitting absolutely still, staring at the whisky glass that he had left on the table earlier. It was still half full.
At this, they laughed so hard that one of them almost fell off the chair. Susy bent down to help her friend up, and as she did, she turned her head and caught sight of John. “Oh. John.”
A puff of warm breath brushed over John’s hand, tickling the small hairs on his fingers. Somehow, the tingle travelled all the way up to John’s neck and down his spine. He felt shaky, like his legs were unsteady and his head light. Maybe he did need his dinner.
“You’ve manipulated her into baking for us, and you didn’t even offer her a cup of tea in thanks. See, I can make deductions too.”
John was still able taste the cake on Sherlock’s lips, when Sherlock suddenly pulled back and drew a deep, shuddering breath. They couldn’t have been kissing for very long. Had Sherlock changed his mind already? John’s stomach swooped at the thought, but when Sherlock lunged at him again, the penny dropped and John started giggling into Sherlock’s mouth. “Did you forget to breathe?”
John stood up as well, hesitating in front of him. A flash of white silk underneath the red shirt surprised him. “You never wear undershirts?”
“Now you eat. Take a bite.” Sherlock’s face was neutral, but his voice had a tinge of both a challenge and a plea.
John walked over to Sherlock’s chair and did his best to loom over him. How did the man manage to be so tall even when sitting down? He thrust the cake towards Sherlock’s face. “Eat the cake.” The icing was starting to crumble under his fingers and small pieces of sugar and marzipan fell into Sherlock’s lap, dotting his blue silk dressing gown like white snow flakes.
Sherlock decided to try to ignore John and started uncorking one of the bottles. John really has a lot of anger these days, Sherlock thought to himself.
John reeled. He was being sent home, like a naughty child. “Alright. Well, thank you.” He cast around for something to say. “Train again?”
“I’m sorry she shot you Sherlock. I wish you would have told me, right then and there. I would have made sure that she never set eyes on you again.”
John’s fingers seemed to have a will of their own as well, because John watched with fascination as they pulled off a piece of dark brown cake, carefully pinching it to avoid dropping the icing. His fingers brought the piece to Sherlock’s mouth. For a moment he could feel the smooth, slick inside of Sherlock’s lips on the tips of his fingers as he closed his mouth around the cake.
As snow fell over Stockholm, they walked silently through the tiny alleys of the Old Town and then across a low bridge to the next island. Here, the charming old houses had been replaced with large boxy office buildings and multi-lane roads full of cars. John thought this was a fitting end. His fantastical adventure of glamorous parties, silk dress scandals and historical buildings was over and it was time to return to the ugly, functional reality. In a way, he was glad he was leaving Sherlock behind. He deserved to stay in the fairytale.
John didn’t know how to integrate the these rewritten memories of Mary with the idealised image of Rosie’s mother that he tried to instil in his daughter’s young mind. He had placed portraits of Mary at toddler height and tried to tell Rosie little stories over dinner about what an amazing mother she had been. Maybe this was one of the reasons he was finding it so difficult to keep up the pretence of being a good father. Good fathers didn’t go around blackening their memories of their late wives, did they?
“Fine. We’ll go to Barts.” John downed his whisky and turned on his heel, heading down the stairs towards the street.
After putting the cork back on the bottle, John took a deep breath and seemed to allow the anger back in. “Why on EARTH do you have nitric acid and hydrochloric acid IN THE KITCHEN?!”
The stairway creaked softly from John’s feet padding down the stairs. “Hi there,” he whispered from the doorway.
Living with John again this past week had given Sherlock a sense of freedom and purpose he never could have imagined. When he left for that ludicrous case in Stockholm, he had been convinced he was done with London for good. Leaving Baker Street had been hard, and staying behind in Stockholm when John went back home had been heartbreaking, but he had felt he had no other option. The image of himself that he had painted after his return from his years abroad being “dead”, had turned into a poisoned mask. Once he had ripped it off and stopped being Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street, he had known he could never put it on again.
A strange look came over Sherlock’s face and with the tiniest movement, he licked his mouth, just a millimetre of tongue darting out and then disappearing again.
“Oh, Lestrade and Molly are taking my luggage to the car. I’ll catch up with them in a moment,” John had said.
Well, that did not go as expected. Time for a tactical retreat. “Your protest has been duly noted, Detective Inspector. Thank you for your time.”
Not knowing what Sherlock was thinking was something he was quite used to, but it was also something he was very fed up with. Talking had never been John’s strong point, but if he was serious about making changes in his life, he supposed this was one more area where he needed to make an effort. He took down a second cup and poured more coffee, one more for himself and one for Sherlock. Then he walked over to the bedroom door and knocked, holding the cups precariously in one hand.
“He should be here at 12:46, then,” Sherlock said, which earned him another punch in the arm. He bent down to pull the plug on the Christmas lights, but John stopped him.
“So you are staying in Stockholm, then?” John ventured. This talking thing was as painful as pulling out teeth, but if this was the last day John got to spend with Sherlock, he couldn’t let everything remain unsaid, like he had so many times before.
These days, Sherlock played a very small part in her life. He would occasionaly visit the morgue to look at a corpse and she sometimes bumped into him when visiting Mrs Hudson. Her infatuation with him had long since faded away and she thought of him like a friend, or perhaps a relative that she cared for but had long since given up hope of truly understanding. But the nightmare stayed the same, and the dread it left behind felt as real as if Sherlock was still the love of her life and she was still guarding the secret of his survival.
He walked out into the kitchen, where a picture perfect Christmas cake was placed at the centre of the table. The icing was flawless, white and smooth. No frilly decorations had been placed on top, just a dark brown silk ribbon tied around the base. Mrs Hudson must have bought a new holiday food magazine.
Mycroft leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes and sighed. Sherlock’s drug habits were his constant nightmare. A blush crept up on Mycroft’s cheeks. Well, they were his waking nightmare. His real nightmares were much more humiliating.
Sherlock calling Mycroft instead of texting or simply ignoring him was so unusual that Mycroft felt momentarily at a loss for words.
Spending the day with Sherlock waiting for the night train was decidedly uncomfortable after that awkward conversation. John moped around, packing the silly dress suit and swearing over the flapping tails that wouldn’t fit in the garment bag. Sherlock stayed in the bedroom, hunched over his computer.
resistance to what he perceives as upper class attire will make him reluctant to give the tailor the time he needs to do the fitting properly. I was hoping that you could accompany him.”
Her hand shook as she finally drank her coffee. It didn’t matter that Mycroft hadn’t mentioned a single thing about Sherlock being in danger, she still felt the panic clawing at the fringes of her mind. She needed a distraction. Before she could change her mind, Molly pulled up Lestrade’s contact and pressed the call button.
“I tried to focus, you know, just get the job done so we could get to sleep? But the more he tried, the more I kept thinking about Christmas cake. In the end, I had to imagine eating one just so I could get off. Best orgasm of this relationship, let me tell you!”
Sherlock’s face turned soft. “You thinking that I was dead, and getting on with your life, was the best possible protection for all three of you. I didn’t realise that you would grieve, but the fact that you did provided extra protection.”
John dropped the cake on the side table and cupped Sherlock’s face as quickly as he could, before the man retreated irretrievably. “Thank you.” He looked into Sherlock’s eyes, searching for a yes.
“Yes. I’ll clean the flask there.” It was an absurd excuse for ending the conversation, but what could he do.
Sherlock realised to his dismay that he was starting to worry about what was being left unsaid, and was considering whether “thick enough to cut with a knife” would be an appropriate expression to describe the atmosphere. Great. He had now been reduced to contemplating idioms. He’d be babbling like an idiot next.
“I know, Sherlock. You already have changed.” John frowned and pinched his mouth shut for a moment before continuing. “I intend to change too, you know. I went back to Ella last week, and I’m starting an anger management program after New Year’s.”
A deep breath later, his anger turned over and made him sick to his stomach with worry. He wanted to turn the rage back on. Being angry had always suited him better, but if he were to let that beast loose, this tiny bubble of tentative closeness would pop and be gone forever. Instead, he leaned his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder blade and closed his eyes, breathing through the nausea.
“Shall I keep the jacket on when we get back?” Sherlock asked teasingly while they walked down the long hallway to the automatic door that would lead them outside.
It came back to the source then. He had a much smarter plan this time. Searching though all of his Shakespeare books? Stupid idea, really! There was his laptop, right under these three cat skulls. John arranged them carefully in the few free places of his desk before he settled back on the couch with the laptop on his knees.
Beneath them London fell to pieces. The helicopter wound it's way through pillars of smoke and ashes. Through the dust, John could see the dome of St.Pauls as it rapidly sank deeper into the ground. He felt as if the earth itself had come to life and was about to swallow up the entirety of human existence. Mrs. Hudson's voice was a constant murmur, accompanying the downfall of civilization like rain falling during a thunderstorm. Sherlock said nothing during the flight. Just like Mycroft, he watched silently as they overflew the river and, just like his brother, he didn't comment on the monstrous disturbance that moved against the waters drift. John felt numb to his core. Now and then he exchanged glances with Greg, both of them needing confirmation that this was actually happening. That they weren't drugged with nerve gas or trapped in a horrible boundless nightmare.
"Holmes?" Dr. Watson said before closing the door. The sitting room was a mess. Journals and books scattered all over the place as if someone threw them in a frenzy. "Sherlock? Love, are you around"
In Baker Street, Sherl and Lock had been rearranging the flat in their liking. Holmes had his hand on the perfume Claire de la Lune. V climbed from the fire escape and brought them a tiny camera.
Doctor Strange just shrugged and invited Joan for a tea while explaining his theory on what is happening.
"Only the very front section of the house remains. It’s just a façade. Remind you of anyone, Mary? A façade." On cue, Mary's headshot projected on the facade.
16-year-old William Sherlock Scott Holmes is observing his mother's garden for the future apiary he's planning. Lavender would be good.
Holmes was sulking because of Watson being away with his wife. Apparently, he had some time to catch Ms. Adler who must be carrying something dangerous. Before he reached for the door, a mysterious black, sucking hole pulled him in. Watson came in a few seconds after the thing closed.
Mostly, he marvelled at the way he had redeemed Mary. Making her a saint instead of a cold-blooded murderer was such an obvious display of self-loathing, it gave him the best therapy lesson of his life. And that without a paid helper.
They stood outside and waited for their eyes to adjust to the darkness. John was idly listening for the sounds of animals or steps in the dark.
Silently, Sherlock did what he was told. He threw his shirt to the side and leant forward, supporting his wait on the desk. John’s anger had dissipated gradually with every bite of toast but now it welled up again.
John Watson. Fighting criminals, shooting serial killers, nervous about showering with his flat mate. Sherlock smiles and pushes the shower curtain aside, just enough to slip in behind John.
Softly, the feather was dragged over is skin. Sherlock felt his muscles contract and his chest tightening.
John knew that the “conversation” he had was meant to be a secret, and he was more than proud of himself for having found a way to answer the stranger, whom he secretly called “The Pilgrim.” Surprisingly, he wasn’t worried about the fact that said stranger had broken into their flat, repeatedly. He was actually more worried about the fact that he called it
“Your parents are very fond of their grandson, aren’t they?” Sherlock asked conversationally. With wide eyes, the suspect nodded at him before averting his gaze.
“Deeper, John!” Sherlock demanded but John was already as deep as possible. Carefully, he pulled out and off of him and sat back. The Omega regarded him with a devastated look. John pushed his legs upwards, nearly folding Sherlock in half. He crept up until his cock was pressed against Sherlock’s entrance. He let his weight rest on Sherlock’s thighs, stretching him uncomfortably, but neither of them did mind it.
“Come out of there.” John tried to sound calm while he turned the shower off. Sherlock’s movements were lacking his usual gracefulness when he made to step out of the tub. John awaited him with a towel. Slowly, carefully he dried him off, rubbing the cloth soothingly over Sherlock’s back and up to his shoulders. He avoided Sherlock’s groin in order to not tease the suffering Omega. His own renewed erection wasn’t important when Sherlock was clearly struggling for composure. John had to stretch up to dry his hair with the towel but it seemed important that he did that for Sherlock.
“John. Will you let me? I want to feel you inside me. I’ve been wanting you in me for a long time. Please.” John barely manages a sharp nod and a grunt of approval. He is still nervous but he does what he always does. Trust Sherlock that he knows what to do.
“I am too tired to indulge in your explorations of not being gay.” Sherlock had already taken his usual position on the couch and closed his eyes. He didn’t move a muscle or even have the decency to look at John.
“What?” He asked, looking down at himself, expecting to find signs of mutation. Carefully, he touched his face scanning for changes but found none.
When the consulting detective came back into the parlor, his shirt open down to his belly button and a big smudge of lipstick on his cheek, John knew it.
“Oi, whatcha doin’?” He growled walking backwards and dragging the lifeless body with him. “Wait? Don’ I know you?” He asked from even further away.
Still, the man made no sound and even though they didn't know why, John and Sherlock remained silent as well.
John thrust hard and deep into him, pushing his knot against the rigid ring of muscles. He growled in frustration when he failed once again. His fingers already left bruises on Sherlock’s pale skin but John kept fucking into him, following his body’s demands.
“You put it there. Your initials in this suggestive area of my body. I liked the meaning. Even if it had none to you.” He admitted, forcing his voice not to waver.
“It’s actually kind of funny, Sherlock. Sometimes, I am even able to laugh about it. Surely, you wouldn’t see it that way but….It’s just…I don’t know.” He tilted his head, staring at his shoes and the earth beneath them.
Sherlock was slumped against a tree, hugging his legs tight. He had buried his face between knees and chest, sobbing quietly.
They were lying on the floor in the living room. (The bedroom had been too boring after two days and the little amount of sleep they needed allowed them to use every available surface in the flat. They considered the kitchen table the best, and John’s chair the worst place they had tried, but the floor was the one surface that was reserved for languid, loving sex.)
In the following weeks, Sherlock heard more and more about this Prince James, but it never gave adequate data on the matter. Only superficial information about wealth and fame, the new Prince was piling up. Those things did nothing to help Sherlock gathering data about his opponent.
“Do you really need to go out again tonight?” She asked in worry. “If there is nothing to be seen why would you need to see it at night?” Her sceptical expression reminded him of Sherlock's deduction face.
)when he heard their landlady. Sherlock on the other hand found it utterly unfathomable how John had managed to maintain any doubt about the detectives view on the matter. He’d been listening intently to catch one of John’s thoughts when he heard the noise. In his worry he miraculously managed to be out the door of their parlour before John had had any chance to react.
“Don’t worry, Dr Watson. Probably, it’s not a problem that turns up every time.” John rolled his eyes inwardly at the unintentional pun.
Sherlock knew how to persuade him. John wouldn't be able to work for another month and they both knew how much he hated wasting money and accepting help from strangers.
John's hands restlessly roamed the lean body, trying to prove again and again that this was,in fact, happening. Somewhen between Sherlock casually sitting down beside him and John being pushed into a horizontal position, their shirts had been unbuttoned to allow a pleasurable caress every now and then.
“Yes, John. Finally.” Sherlock breathed, wrapping his long legs around John. Their cocks were touching, just a small press of skin on skin but it made John whimper in desperation. With his hands under Sherlock’s arse, he lifted the Consulting Detective who wriggled over him until John’s cock was lined up with his slick entrance. Letting him sink down on his cock, John bit his lower lip in an attempt to stay quiet. Sherlock didn’t have his decency.
Pointing at Greg and Sean, he signalled for them to guard the door and the stairs leading downwards.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock! You're my friend. If you know what’s wrong you should tell me. You with your giant brain!” John spits the last words out with disgust and turns a deadly glare at Sherlock.
"John. Haven't I been an admirable example for self-control in the last months? Have I not been companionable and cheerful even though this whole situation should have made me the first one to actually get killed?" Sherlock asked confidently.
John was watching the crease of the Omega’s arse, observing how the wetness advanced with every thrust of his fingers. It had gradually gotten less while the heat subsided but John decided that there was still no need for lube.
John rushed forward and retrieved his gun knowing that Sherlock was right behind him. He wanted to avoid any of them finding out what the trap held for it's victims.
“Yes.” The doctor sighed, taking the towel from his hand and beginning to dry Sherlock’s hair with it. He had to strain his arms but somehow it gave him a sense of control. The detective’s face was impassive for the time it took John to dry his body completely but as soon as John was done Sherlock pushed him to the side and stepped from the room.
She wasn’t in haste as she went back to her chair and pulled a large bread knife out of her purse. For a short moment John was grateful that it wasn’t a gun but when he saw the purple and red stains on the blade he understood that she was in fact very dangerous.
After less than five minutes of walking down the desolated streets of London, the earth shook beneath their feet as a loud uproar from behind threatened to deafen them. Turning around in horror, they watched an almost black cloud of brickwork, dust and earth explode from the ground.
Sherlock looked disgruntled at the half empty plate on John’s side of the table. “I didn’t know you. And it is really not my area. This right here just serves to prove that.” He narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. “What would have been the right thing to say?”
“You convinced me that acting happy and normal was the same thing as being happy and normal. That it doesn't matter who I am.”
And Mike was very helpful, indeed. He had asked exactly the right questions leading up to one inevitable deduction. After they argued about it for almost three hours, John finally gave in and they proceeded to make a plan to prove their (Mike's) reasoning. When he now thought about the things this plan would require him to do, John began to worry about the outcome and blushed. It was a dangerous course of action he was about to take, and it didn’t surprise him at all that he was already giddy to start.
“I will be. Just give me a few minutes.” Her voice indicated differently but John was grateful for the answer.
“Hello. I have a medical problem that seems to be very rare and I thought it better to talk to someone that is specialized on this very topic.”
“Mine.”  He growled and spent himself into the exhausted Omega. Sherlock collapsed onto the floor while John was still kneeling above him.
“John? Could you..um...probably think a bit louder?” Sherlock asked with his hands folded in his lap, his head tilted to the side and a look of insecurity on his face.
“Not really, no.” The understatement was evident by the way he held very still under John’s touch while the tip of the tentacle wound itself around the doctor’s finger.
He’d never done that before. Had never even wanted to before John had entered his life. But the drawn out groan above him was a praise he enjoyed tremendously. He definitely wanted to achieve this again. Pressing his tongue hard against the underside of the hard flesh definitely worked in his favor. Amazed at his own body’s response, Sherlock struggled with the urge to touch himself.
“How would I even do that? I can’t remember doing anything like this and I certainly didn’t want to.”
as answer when he moved up to his room but he hadn’t time to think about it. He could already feel his trousers growing tighter.
“How did you imagine it?” John’s voice was deeper than usual and his eyes were intensely focused on Sherlock’s. The consulting detective straightened his back and held John’s gaze before bending forward,  closer to John’s ear. Sherlock’s words were a low rumble that were tickling John’s earlobe and sending shivers down his neck and arms.
Quietly, Sean began to laugh, digging his fingers hard into his thighs. His own weapon forgotten on the ground beside him.
Sherlock slung his arms around John’s neck and pressed up into the touch. Forcing his eyes to open, he watched the muscles in John’s arms tense as the doctor lowered almost completely onto him.
John grinned before he looked at the alarm clock beside his bed and started to feel annoyed. “Sherlock, it’s 7 am! Why did you wake me?” He emphasized his point with a huge yawn.
The trip to the Yard was a waste of time but Sherlock had expected that. He had actually just wanted to see how many people were calling in sick in spite of deeming their job important. By now, he mused, John probably already remembered the existence of TV and if he did he would be even more devastated. Sherlock had already checked all media in the morning and it was obvious that John wasn’t some kind of host for this disease. It wasn’t even a disease. Sherlock was fairly sure by now that it was an evolutionary step. In which direction he didn’t know. Clearly, John carried a catalyst and whatever ability came with his mutation. The catalyst had already made an appearance when they met Lestrade but Sherlock still hadn’t found out if John visited him in his dreams or if it was the other way around. Maybe even both.
“Sherlock….Please. That’s torture.” John tries very hard not to thrust against Sherlock’s face but only marginally succeeds. His hips move of their own accord and he finds himself grabbing the sheets tightly in his fists. He blinks his eyes open, looking down as Sherlock’s tongue scoots out to lick the tip of his cock, John’s head falls back on the bed and a loud groan forces its way out of his mouth.
Sherlock is blinking one eye open and trying to remember what that sound beside him means. Text, yeah text. Right. He searches for his phone with one hand, refusing to open his eyes fully to aid the quest.
Mrs. Hudson had needed some help climbing out of the crater that was their former front yard but she was doing pretty well, especially with the intense support Sean was willingly providing. With watchful eyes, Mycroft scanned their surroundings, his first trip to the surface apparently having made an impression.
“I think you are forgetting that I can’t know if you don’t. Oh, come on. Don’t look at me like that!” John got up and crossed the distance between them in three steps. Kneeling down, he put one hand on Sherlock’s knee and looked into the Consulting Detective’s frustrated face.
Swallowing hard, Sherlock shimmied lower and knelt gingerly down on John’s ankles before he focussed all of his attention on the obvious bulge in front of him. Almost dropping forward, he bend down low to nose at the desired flesh pressing against the fabric of John’s pyjama pants.
“About what, John? You, marking me? Or me, liking it?” Sherlock’s teasing was a seductive whisper. Seductive enough that John didn’t immediately notice the hand slipping into his pants and closing around his hardness. Giving in to the sensation, he let his forehead drop against a freckled collarbone.
When he had been “sick” and began to evolve, John had taken care of him and, at first Sherlock had mistaken John’s constant babble as a sign of worry and a way to break the silence. When he had seen an old man standing in his bedroom, holding an oak wand and staring at him, Sherlock had attributed it to his fever. Just like the choir he was constantly hearing that day.
Sherlock looked back at him with unmasked desire and when their eyes met everything fell into place.
Sherlock’s hands were running over his back, pressing them even closer together. As John felt his elation slowly turn into passion, he took a step back only to have Sherlock follow him.
John grinned to himself while deliberately walking a bit slower and checking out Sherlock's rear view in a most obvious way before he asked “I don't know. Why would you?”.
John had his eyes closed. The hand holding Sherlock's wrist clenched and unclenched in sync with the rhythm the soldier made the tentacle breach this entrance..
“I’ll be in my room. You are going to have questions. Please don’t bother me every time. Write them down and I’ll answer every single one when you are finished reading.” John didn’t fall for his false arrogance but he didn’t tease Sherlock for his nervousness either.
John thought, pointedly glancing at Greg’s hands on Mycroft’s hips as both men hurried smiling to their cosy self-made cave.
were the doctor!” The petulance came closer and closer, being carried up the stairs by a deliberately noisy Consulting Detective.
Sipping his tea, John realized that it was not about the tattoo. Not really. He had always wanted Sherlock. Had always quietly harboured a strong attraction to the madman who had given him back what he had lost somewhere in the afghan desert.
“I should have acted on that before it was too late.” He whispered bitterly, dragging his thumb over John’s lower lip and biting his own.
He watched as Mrs. Phillips was lead out of the door, muttering that she might have mental issues, that Sherlock might have been right with her having a breakdown and that it was for the better if they kept her locked away from others. An awkwardly walking Anderson smiled uncertainly back at John before he closed the door behind himself and they were suddenly alone again.
A mistake. Such a horrible mistake with which he had very likely destroyed the only thing that had kept him wanting to be alive for two consecutive years.
“Is there another one about Omegas?” He asked with forced casualty before he passed Sherlock the book.
He cast a look around only to find the living room looking as if nothing happened at all. Everything was back in it's place and Yorrick stared accusingly into the kitchen. Just as John started to doubt his memories, he saw two aspirin and a glass of water on the couch table, right beside a folded note with his name written on it. With trembling hands, he took the pain killers, spilling some water in the process. Cautiously, he eyed the note before lifting it to his eyes. His vision was still blurred by alcohol but the message was clear to him anyway.
“Howard is obsessive and often forgets the time when we have appointments but he would never leave me.” She said to Sherlock, her black hair hiding most of her face. John never understood why some women straightened their hair but on their client it made him reconsider the aesthetic behind the procedure.  When she realized what she’d just said, her full lips began to tremble.
Every single muscle in Sherlock’s body was aching, especially his shoulders and arms. The cuffs around his wrists had left angry marks and his neck hurt from the weight of his head hanging down. He had fallen asleep from exhaustion, still chained to the wall and standing upright. Well, hanging upright.
“Lestrade called and offered us a case. I think he just wanted to know how you were doing. Mycroft texted to annoy me.” He dug his fingers into the tight muscle between John's neck and shoulder. “Not much, really. I was either here or in hospital. There is only so much that can happen between two locations. Oh, an old man tried to steal my wallet!”
Sherlock was gently biting his way up John's neck, his hands roaming over the doctor's waist. John smelled leather and sweat as he leant his forehead against his lovers shoulder. With his eyes closed, he inhaled deeply and basked in the feeling of Sherlock's nimble fingers as they found their way beneath his jumper and pressed into the soft fleshy area just above his hip bones. Sherlock's breath was loud in his ear when he felt goose bumps spreading all over his neck and chest,
It was still two hours until Sherlock and him had planned to go out and there really weren't enough ways to flee this conversation.
As the Consulting Detective let himself sink down again, he felt John’s hard arousal against his pelvis. He groaned and made to take himself in hand again but John was quick to stop him. He knotted the fingers of both his hands through Sherlock’s thrusting lightly up between Sherlock’s cheeks. Two tentacles wound themselves around his calves and John’s thighs, binding them together. The tentacles coming out of the middle of his back slowly squirmed over his shoulders and looped through his armpits before they curled around his back and chest crossing each other. His position was strained now. His own limbs held him in place, his mobility limited to small movements of his arms and hips.
After he found out which source stood behind the latest quote, John was certain that the name of the poem held another hint for him. “The Passionate Pilgrim.” He smiled inwardly, despite the anxiety that still pulled at his guts whenever he thought about the possibility of being entirely wrong.
She left a few minutes ago, crying and furious. John is standing at the window staring out on Baker Street as if he would find answers out there.
“Oh, what now?” Theatrically, Moriarty stomped his foot like a stubborn child and nodded for the man to John’s right to go and end the noise.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open. He was sitting in his chair wearing his dressing gown and had his hands folded in his lap. Across from him, John smiled under his mustache.
When John finally considers the fact that a reflex doesn’t have to be based on true conviction, fortunately it's late enough to go to the pub.
Pressing his forehead against Sherlock’s collarbone, John let go. The only focus of his mind on the feeling around his cock and making sure to give Sherlock enough friction, as well. The lube that had already vanished to a degree now being replaced by their combined sweat.
“Naturally, I tried to figure out what it was. I managed to rule out STD’s or a simple wart but I am no urologist, so…”
John’s eyes had closed of their own accord. As he opened them he looked right into Sherlock’s worried face.
It was dark outside. The city lay loud and crowded just on the other side of their flat’s walls. Sherlock’s head rested on John’s chest right above his beating heart.
He nodded miserably and wiped the tears from his eyes before he got up and threw the bacon into the bin, not bothering with separating it from the plate first. “I think the parlour is more suitable for this, though.”
“What are you dreaming lately?” Sherlock asked, his tone implying that he knew all too well about the explicitness of John’s dreams.
John passed Tesco everyday for the next three days. Sometimes he went in, sometimes he didn’t. He knew that his behavior was odd, if not plainly obvious. It had a good effect on his fridge, either way.  John just couldn’t stop himself from searching for contact. He needed to know. He needed to know everything. But the girl didn’t show up again.
“You know what they say. God lives in every single one of us and, surprisingly, whoever said that was right. We are the Old Gods. At least, we turned into them.” Sherlock drawled, appearing as if he’d just explained the color of the sky to a four year old.
With great care, the three men got up and walked to the window overlooking the street. Surely enough, Bakerstreet was split in half, a huge crack running through it’s middle. Lestrade didn’t remark on the sight of his car hanging halfway down into a slope. He was sure that he had bigger problems at the moment. While they all stared outside, the silence was broken by the sound of Sherlock’s phone. Without looking at it, he picked up and raised it to his ear.
Sherlock furrows his brows about what exactly is happening and has to take the picture twice to make sure John can’t decipher his expression just by the wrinkles around his eyes. But he sends the picture. Naturally. He is already waiting for the next message.
“Nothing. We didn’t find him, did we?” Sherlock said standing up. He buttoned his jacket and walked over to the door, prompting their client to leave. John smiled to himself thinking how very close together empathy and rudeness occurred in Sherlock’s behavior.
“You didn’t do anything. At least, I think you didn’t intend to. I have made a mistake and I am going to face the consequences by moving out before it affects you and our friendship.”  Sherlock’s body betrayed his calm voice. There was a certain tension in his features. His hands were balled into fists and his eyes were locked on John’s.
“Will you stay with me?” John’s head shot up at that, eyes wide and mouth agape, before he looked away again, staring at the wall over Sherlock’s headboard.
“I think you actually did him a favor. From what I’ve gathered the mutations range from minor changes, like in Mrs. Hudson’s case, to people actually mutating into a heap of moving flesh. I even heard of cases of levitation. But I doubt it.”
“Right.”  Together, they pushed their furniture out of the way, clearing a two square meter circle when they the doorbell rang.
“I see.” Sherlock nodded to himself. “You probably need a few hours to yourself.” He said in a false attempt at empathy. John didn’t fall for it for a second.
“Deduce it!” John prompted amused before he pushed himself up using both hands on Sherlock’s knees. “I’ll be here if you need me.”
Sherlock considered the question. Both of them had issues with intimacy. Big, obvious issues. And even though they were close from the very beginning this was something else entirely.
Sherlock appeared at his side silent as a cat. John held the hanger into the torch light to make him understand what had happened without having to explain it. The Consulting Detective picked up a small piece of china that lay close to his feet and threw it unceremoniously against the creature. It bounced off with a wooden sound and rolled around before it disappeared into a gap between the floor boards.
The non-alcoholic beverage aisle of Tesco was deserted at 10 am but John still hurried to get everything Sherlock had sent him for. He already had six bottles of water and was now packing some bottles of Sprite into the caddy. (“At some point we will need the sugar, John.”)
John’s stiffening body and a heartfelt whimper above him were all it took for Sherlock to take the fall. His body clenched around John’s still throbbing cock, his right hand pressing bruises into wheat-colored skin as he spent himself between them.
Several seconds of silence had John imagining a stare off between the two until he heard Mrs. Hudson's barely suppressed shriek “Oh… Oh… I'm so happy for you two.” followed by a smooching sound that made John laugh as he imagined Sherlock's faked annoyance.
Sure motions circled up and down his legs for long moments before he felt a blanket covering him completely and long fingers brushing through his hair.
“God, yes!” Sherlock groaned. His entrance still loosened from the last time, John decided to add another finger. Instantly, Sherlock began to push down on his hand. It made John’s attempt on giving head almost impossible but the Alpha did his best to keep some kind of rhythm.
“Thank god! I was already worrying that your next limp might not be psychosomatic.” Sherlock teased him in obvious relief.
John stumbled into the hallway holding his ears to no avail. Passing him by, his lover had already given up on defensive gestures, having accepted that the sound was coming through his mind as much as through his ears.
Unsettling was not so much that the thing was flying in spite of not having wings or anything similar but that it’s color made John feel dizzy and his thoughts tangle in on themselves. Green-ish orange ranks with purple-ish yellow joints had hung loosely from the fat round and squirming body. It’s surface seemingly in endless motion, appearing as if every last part of the repulsive object was at war with it’s peers.
what Sherlock found odd but also freeing. He found it much harder to think when John was in the same room, nowadays.
“I choose you. Not because you pressured me, not because I need your half of the rent. I choose you because I want you. I want to do this the right way. Do you still want this…me?” He held Sherlock's hands tight, looking into his eyes.
“Isn’t there something you’d rather do?” The smirk in Sherlock’s voice was audible but John could only discern the short staggering breaths throughout.
He positioned himself, staring at Sherlock who had gotten up again and shimmied out of his trousers and underwear. It distracted John to the point where he almost fell off the other side of the bed during his attempt to get rid of his own trousers and jeans and had to stop himself from moving. Even though, Sherlock wasn’t fully erect he was able to imagine what that would look like. The freckles and scars on the pale skin where anything but perfect, the bones a testament to bad eating habits.
Slowly, John sat back on his heels his arms still stretched to the side’s, held there by the strong but apparently not very smart minions. He could probably overwhelm both of them but Moriarty had placed a sword in hand-reach that could turn his break out into a burial if he was unlucky.
Mentally preparing himself, he took a deep breath and tensed his muscles before he pushed forward again. His eyes stayed on Sherlock’s face, partly to observe possible signs of pain but more for his own sake. With his eyes closed the stimulation would have been impossible to handle.
"It'll probably start raining soon. Better get going." John pointed at a steep and sandy ascending slope ahead of them.
John filled the caddy in record time. The thought that Sherlock was alone at home, weakened and tense, made John agitated. He imagined a dozen scenarios in which Sherlock accidentally fell, had a sudden stroke because of his bodies state or even got attacked by another Alpha. John knew that all his visions were highly unlikely and comforted himself with the knowledge that it was only his Alpha-brain telling him to stay close to Sherlock and protect him.
When the door to 221b closed, Sherlock sent a text to Mycroft, telling him to let his stuff return to Baker Street.
“Fuck, John…” He muttered, feeling his climax build continuously. Sherlock tried to bring one hand to his throbbing prick, the urge to come rising viciously inside of him.
“You want to come up. See if John is doing O.K.. I assure you he is. We both are definitely O.K.. Now, go on watching that baking show.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “I see you haven’t had your dinner yet. You get grumpy when you don’t eat.”
John could feel his heartbeat wooshing in his head, compressing his skull and making his ears ring. “Don’t change the subject! You need to eat!”
Half an hour later, he was leaning against the window sill in the living room, smoking a cigarette and giving up. It was odd, it happening like this, on a cold December night without any real event causing his defeat. He was done. He had kept going in the same direction for as long as he could remember and now, suddenly, he had come to the end of this road and simply had to concede it was not possible to go one step further. London was no longer his playground, it was his prison. Baker Street was no longer his refuge, but a museum of his failures. The dust he wouldn’t let Mrs Hudson clean up had turned everything grey and stale.
Introducing Mary Morstan into John Watson’s life had been a bit of a gamble, but he had wanted to give Sherlock the opportunity to build a proper life for himself when he returned to London after his years abroad, not fall back in with Dr Watson and return to their ridiculous crime solving escapades. The plan had worked admirably — until Mary had gone rogue and shot Sherlock, that is. And managed to convince him, posthumously, to sink deeper into drugs than he had ever managed on his own.
Sherlock hesitated and looked John over quickly, as if he was deducing how John would react. At first, John thought Sherlock would refuse to reply, but then his mouth made a complicated motion. “I dream of Mary,” he said lightly and looked to the side.
Flailing for something to say, something to make his whirlpool of a brain catch up with what his body was doing, John looked down at the cake and said stupidly “It’s a very good cake.”
Mycroft smiled at Antheas efficiency. “I’ll try to be brief, Detective Inspector,” he said. “I need a favour. It regards our mutual friend Dr Watson.”
John held up his hand to stop him. “You didn’t realise that I would grieve?” he asked again. Even his voice sounded cold, as if that bucket of ice water had seeped into his very soul.
Out of habit, he scrolled through the messages from desperate family members, distraught business owners and bested collectors. Unexpectedly, a plea for help caught his eye. A person loosely associated with the Swedish royal court had stumbled upon evidence of a conspiracy to falsely implicate one high ranking literary figure in a scandal during this year’s Nobel Prize party on December 10. Due to some complicated and far reaching earlier scandal in the royal literary academy, which required far too many pages of explanations which Sherlock didn’t bother reading, the man did not dare bring forth his evidence to the authorities or to the lady in question. Apparently the situation was too volatile. He seemed to think Swedish society as a whole would collapse unless the entire business was kept completely under wraps. Therefore, he implored Sherlock to come to his aid and save not only the lady but the entire world of academia from irreparable damage.
Stunned, Mycroft wondered what more he didn’t know about Sherlock’s summers in France. He had always doubted the wisdom of staying in Cambridge to study over summer when Sherlock was at such an impressionable age, but he had been young and ambitious, and Sherlock had not yet shown his self-destructive tendencies.
John took another deep breath. This was so much worse than he had ever imagined. Sherlock really was a machine.
Lestrade laughed so hard that he dropped his phone. Molly felt a grin spread on her face and her shoulders drop back down into place. She would get through this day too.
“Alright,” Molly heard herself say. It did sound like a truly awkward way to spend a lunch hour, both for herself and for poor John Watson, but she couldn’t say no to the opportunity to reassure herself that John actually was going to meet Sherlock, that he truly was alright. Molly couldn’t shake the feeling of doom that had washed over her when she first heard Mycroft’s voice. The phone call was too similar to her dream conversations with him.
The metal tray clanged as it fell to the floor and the instruments she had been gathering skittered all over the mortuary floor. Sighing, Molly picked them up, put them on the desk and went in search of coffee. She needed caffeine if she was going to be able to do her job.
Time suddenly seemed to shrink and John wished he could do this afternoon all over again, this time staying with Sherlock and asking him every single question he could think of. “Okay. Let me get my bags,” he said.
The cake smelled divine: sweet, dark, heady and with a sharp scent of citrus. John’s mouth watered and he bit down into the soft, moist crumbs. Belatedly, he realised that he had put his mouth right where Sherlock’s had just been. It seemed impossible that he should be able to taste Sherlock in the cake, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he had.

Something in the flat started beeping and John felt his adrenaline spike as he looked around for danger. A moment later, he realised that it was the coffee machine. He padded back to the kitchen and poured a cup, drinking it at the counter while he waited for his hands to stop shaking. Just like that, all the contentment from the past few days of excitement and silliness and well deserved rest was gone, blown away by a few words from Sherlock and the beep of a household appliance. Stockholm suddenly felt very cold and very alien.
He had asked for results on a possible murder victim and she had replied that they were not ready yet. The subject was professional but the tone of the texts were decidedly flirtatious. Were they starting something here? Her thumb hovered over the screen
“His infatuation with Molly is making him so happy that he says yes to almost anything if it gives him an excuse to spend extra time with her. We should take advantage of that while it lasts.”

“We could take Rosie, when we get back to London.” Once the words were out of his mouth, he realised how many assumptions he had packed into that sentence without checking if Sherlock was okay with them. “Listen, Sherlock.” He sat up, leaning his back against the armrest. “I have been thinking. I need a change in my life and I really wish we could get back to some of the stuff we used to do,” he started. How he was going to work up the courage to ask Sherlock if they could find a way to share a flat again, he didn’t know.
He was reaching for his phone to check his messages when it rang. The name on the screen made his blood go cold. A phone call from Sherlock was never good news.
“On the roof of Barts, Moriarty told me that he had snipers ready to take you out. You, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade were dead, unless I killed myself.
He was just trying to open his eyes again when he realised that he was leaning his knees against the edge of Sherlock’s seat, boxing him in. John’s eyes flew open and he was about to right himself, when he felt Sherlock’s fingers curl against the back of his knee, pulling him in closer. Sherlock was staring at John’s mouth, seemingly unaware of what his fingers were doing.
“Yes, I know.” Sherlock looked up at him, eyes suddenly full of compassion. “That’s why I didn’t tell you. She was never going to let you be a father if you took my side. I had to try to make sure she stayed with you.”
“You want me to go with John to the tailor?” The request was so absurd that Molly was certain it must be some sort of code. She squeezed the coffee cup for warmth, but realised that she was crushing the thin plastic and put it down to avoid an accident.

“You’ve manipulated her into baking for us, and you didn’t even offer her a cup of tea in thanks. See, I can make deductions too.”
The scent of greasy Chinese wafted from Sherlock’s coat as he floated up the stairs in front of John. Day had turned to night and the darkness of the stairwell was playing tricks on John’s eyes, making him think that Sherlock was wavering, about to fall. Looking up at Sherlock from below was always a challenge, John thought, but as long as he was walking up stairs it was usually fine. It was actually worse to be behind Sherlock when he was going down the stairs. If he was wearing his coat, John couldn’t see if his feet were sure on the steps, or if he was about to stumble to his death.
Sherlock leaned back with a glint in his eye. “So you don’t want to give Sandra another go?” His tone was teasing, but his mouth looked vulnerable as he spoke.
Inside the train station, Sherlock looked up at the big display of departures and arrivals. “Your train leaves from platform ten. That’s right through there.”
He had been twenty minutes early and had gone to meet Susy in the pub outside her office. She’d mentioned she might go there for a drink with her co-workers before meeting him for dinner. As he walked in from the cold, there was a roar of laughter from the corner by the bar, and in midst of the noise, he had heard Susy’s bright voice.
“Right,” John chuckled. “That’s enough soppy talk for two blokes in the middle of the night. I’m going back to bed. You should get some sleep too. You’ll have to be awake
John clenched his fist on the armrest of the chair and took another sip of his drink. OK, Sherlock thought, there’s the rage back again.
He had been twenty minutes early and had gone to meet Susy in the pub outside her office. She’d mentioned she might go there for a drink with her co-workers before meeting him for dinner. As he walked in from the cold, there was a roar of laughter from the corner by the bar, and in midst of the noise, he had heard Susy’s bright voice.
A moment later, John realised that Sherlock hadn’t leaned forward. He was just sitting there, stubbornly waiting for John to feed him. John’s pulse went up again. Fine. He’d feed him. But as he moved the cake towards Sherlock’s mouth, a strange jitter of nerves came over him. What were they doing?
Sherlock ran up the stairs to the flat, hypersensitive to the sound of John’s feet behind him. Why was he here? Would he stay this time, or would he flit away as usual? Was he hoping for another case to keep the adrenaline going? Did he leave something behind that he wanted to pick up?
Molly yawned as she opened the door to the mortuary. It had been awhile since the nightmare disturbed her sleep, but last night she had woken up in the small hours of the night and had not been able to get back to sleep until after five. Her alarm clock rang at 6:15, so she was now both sleep deprived and stuck in the wrong part of a sleep cycle.
Sherlock’s shirt finally fell open and he shrugged it off his shoulders, slipping it off and throwing it over the armrest of his chair with false bravado. He quickly grabbed the bottom of his undershirt and pulled it over his head, but John couldn’t help noticing that Sherlock’s hands were shaking.
Flailing for something to say, something to make his whirlpool of a brain catch up with what his body was doing, John looked down at the cake and said stupidly “It’s a very good cake.”
“No, scratch that.” Sherlock studied him. “She was planning to break up with you, but you found out beforehand. In some embarrassing way.”
“What do you mean, weakness for alcohol?” Lestrade was suddenly belligerent. Interesting. This was a side of the man he had not seen before.
John seemed to sense his embarrassment and started walking down the stairs. “Let’s go look at that tree, then.”
“I don’t think life as a GP and a single parent is working very well for him. Maybe he would do better with a job with more flexible hours. And more — adrenaline.”
John punched him lightly in the arm. “We will do no such thing. We are very happy for them and will do our best to give them space to explore their new relationship.”
“I was wondering if I might impose on your working day. There is a delicate matter that I cannot handle myself. I would much appreciate if you were able to be of assistance during your lunch hour.”
Slowly, Sherlock put the bottles back in the cupboard, pulled off his gloves and goggles, put them back on the shelf and closed the door.
“Really?” The choir switched to a new song. John had no idea what they were singing, but it sounded angelic.”I wish we had this in London.”
John stomped up the stairs, shame still burning his cheeks. It was one thing to be dumped. That had happened too many times to count. Not being up to scratch in bed was worse, but well, not everyone were compatible sexually. He could live with that. Anyway, most of the girls mentioned Sherlock rather than his performance as the reason for the breakup and he couldn’t fault them. Cases with Sherlock was better than sex, there was no way around it. Even if he would never admit that aloud to anyone.
Sherlock put the bottles down next to the sink and opened the kitchen window. “I need to clean this flask. Residue is contaminating my experiment.”
A fine thread had been holding John’s temper back since he left the pub, and now he could feel it breaking in his chest. It felt good, in a way. Cathartic. “You have been exploiting Mrs Hudson’s kindness again, haven’t you?”
John stomped harder on the creaking steps to erase the image of their horrified faces from his mind. He had turned around and left, expecting Susy to come after him. As he had walked through the door, he had shot a glance over his shoulder. Susy hadn’t been running after him, apologising. She had been looking down, shaking with repressed laughter, trying to keep her face in control until he left the pub. He had let the door slam behind him. Another roar of laughter slipped through the crack before the door closed shut.
The Christmas cake was untouched, which made the anger claw in John’s chest again. “You haven’t even tasted the cake!” he roared.
Sherlock looked up, trying not to jostle Rosie. He kept on humming,  nodding meaningfully towards Rosie.
He was just trying to open his eyes again when he realised that he was leaning his knees against the edge of Sherlock’s seat, boxing him in. John’s eyes flew open and he was about to right himself, when he felt Sherlock’s fingers curl against the back of his knee, pulling him in closer. Sherlock was staring at John’s mouth, seemingly unaware of what his fingers were doing.
Sherlock stared at him and his pale eyes seemed to grow darker and fiercer by the second. When John thought he couldn’t take the tension any longer, Sherlock said slowly “Alright.” And just as slowly, he opened his mouth.
The Christmas tree glittered in the dark corner of the room. Sherlock turned around so that Rosie could see the tree over his shoulder. “Look, Rosie. A Christmas tree.”
He opened the door and was enveloped by warm air and the scent of Chinese food. He pushed off his shoes, hung up his jacket and walked into the kitchen. On the tiny table, Sherlock had set out plates and cutlery. On the counter, cartons of food were waiting.
“Lestrade wanted an early night?” Sherlock realised that it was the wrong thing to say as the words were coming out of his mouth.
“Well, that’s not really an accurate description,” Sherlock rumbled from the living room. “Fermented, distilled and then aged, I should say.”
“It’s a St Lucia procession. It’s a traditional part of the Swedish festivities leading up to Christmas. The Nobel Prize winners get their own private processions. Apparently, Lucia wakes them up in bed and brings them coffee.”
“If you cannot even imagine grief, the thought of us dying wouldn’t have bothered you. Why throw your entire life away and go to Serbia?”
The medical part of John’s mind had started whirring with questions and suggestions but tonight Sherlock needed a friend, not a doctor. To ground himself in the moment and to try to push the medicine away, he placed his other hand on Sherlock’s other shoulder. Sherlock tensed at first, but then relaxed again. It seemed to John that Sherlock was slowly melting into his touch, and he thought, irrationally, that they were becoming joined, that he could feel Sherlock’s emotions flowing through his hands.
That had finally made John start from the beginning, and get to the wonderful end. He wanted Sherlock to come live with him and Rosie. He wanted Sherlock to be there, every day. He didn’t want him for the adventure, or the adrenaline, or the danger. He wanted them to be friends, to be housemates, to be in each other’s lives always for no other reason than that they fit together like no two other people did. And he wanted him to be there for Rosie.
“I ordered it online and had it delivered to Molly’s house. Lestrade brought it over while you were putting Rosie to bed.”
Mycroft hung up and Molly was left staring at her phone. Did John know she was coming? Did Sherlock know that his brother was meddling? Probably not, but neither of them would be surprised.
