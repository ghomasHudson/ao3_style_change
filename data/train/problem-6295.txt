His eyelids felt like they were weighted down by some unending force. His vision blurring even more but he knew he had to hold out. Just a little bit longer. He coughed lightly with whatever he could manage, sending a light fraction of blood trailing down his cheek. Natasha sulked slightly while she wiped the liquid away from his face clean with the towel held on his forehead. "Thank you Natasha.." Steve let out slowly. She looked up at the super soldier and nod as if to say no problem whatsoever.
"I'm going to count to three ok?" Steve informed the other so he could brace himself. Tony clenched his eyes shut and involuntary reached for Bruce's pant leg, grabbing it tightly. The pain was already unbearable. He could barely stand getting his suit cut open with this thing sticking out of him. It's like now that there wasn't any resistance, he was steadily getting worst.
The shock wave was much greater than he's originally expected that as well as the blinding flash of light. 'Somebody must have been playing prank on us or something. That was hardly a threat, more of a nuisance really.' Tony thought to himself as bits and pieces of debris lightly pelted his armor. Nowhere near able to a dent in his suit, after all it was meant to deflect bullets and all other attacks.
"Wait what!? Tony which direction is it coming from!?" Steve said aloud as he stood from his seat. He walked over to the black haired genius who was punching numerous keys by the huge monitor. Jarvis minimized into nothing but a few voice bars in the corner of the screen the sky above Manhattan on full display.
The vehicle was backed up to the door making it easily accessible. The two paramedics slide out the padded stretcher and Steve carefully laid Tony on his back while Bruce elevated the head side. One of the paramedics gathered an oxygen tank and mask, placing it over his face. Tony had been gasping for air ever since Steve pulled the shard from his body. He was in need of precious oxygen, with only one of his lungs working to full capacity and the other with a gaping hole.
It wasn't like he could push him away, not like he wanted to in the first place, but he was in no shape to be in this position. He felt the only thing he could really do in this situation was wrap his arms back around him and support him the best he could. He felt so fragile underneath his strong arms. Almost like if he squeezed be little too hard he'd shatter underneath him. There was no way of knowing what was going on in that eccentric mind of his, why he would push himself this far when he couldn't even sit up a moment ago. Tony was a mystery to him why he does the things he does didn't add up but it seemed to work for him in a way. But this was out of character, well as far as he could see. From the tabloids and the file he read up on the younger Stark he wasn't much of the gushy type.
The sirens went off along with flashing lights as they sped off. Tony's body had calmed so much after receiving the initial shot. One of the paramedics held the mask on his face while the unraveled the makeshift bandage and cut off one of Tony's favorite but now ruined shirts. Steve watched them work for a second then looked back over to Tony. It wasn't a surprise to see the other staring back at him. Hopefully his nerves had calmed quite a deal since being skewered. He managed a weak smile as his chestnut eyes looked back into Steve's bright blue ones. He smiled back even bigger than he anticipated, not regretting a single uplifted facial muscle.
"How long have you been here?" Tony spoke up. He didn't even look over, he knew who was there. His voice was low and rasped from overuse; still it didn't strain him to speak. He'd almost forgotten how it felt. Steve hesitated, pulling up a chair.
It was that look on his face. In a way he could tell there was something he had been hiding from them. He seemed frightened which is understandable but through the entire ordeal he seemed hardly phased, yet he was afraid to get put under. The quicker he could reassure the other the quicker he could get some rest and see his in the morning with the lot of them.
He ran a hand down his tightly bandaged side. Even with all the drugs running though him he could still feel the dulling sensation as his finger tips caressed the cloth covering. He didn't even want to know what it looked like, might even throw him back into a state of unwelcomed panic. No thank you.
It wasn’t that long ago. Other clippings were attached it, Obadiah Stain former Stark industries representative conspiring and selling weapons to the same terrorist group. His attempted murder of Mr. Stark in order to seize assets still Iron man managed to put a stop to it. All of this was compiled neatly in his bedside table. It was a never ending nightmare wrapped up in a bundle.
"Tony how have you not keeled over from alcohol poisoning yet? I know most that expensive stuff has to be pretty potent." Bruce added sarcastically, knowing full well that it would take a lot more then drunk teasing for him to strike a nerve. Not to mention the other loved playing along. It was a test of whit's and Tony had pictured himself the comedian of the group when in fact it wasn't all that hard to make one smart ass remark after another. Especially for one with the mentality of a genius like himself even when pit against someone just as smart.
On the other side of the room Natasha stared at the glimmering metal shard coated in dark red blood; she studied it for a moment. That insignificant piece of mineral was able to drill straight threw the Iron Man armor as if it were tinfoil. She couldn't help but wonder just what exactly it was made of rather than who sent it. One thing before another right, they had to know what exactly they were going to be up against. She figured it couldn't hurt to run a few tests just to be sure of what exactly they were up against.
He lifted his head as the sound of a door shutting. Ultimately realizing that Bruce was already headed up the stairs and he was left alone. It was quiet and dark the last thing he wanted was to be left alone with his thoughts. He grabbed the handle and pulled the door that led to the stairs open. He paused for a moment and glanced back before walked in. A streetlight that stood out in front of the building cast a dull yellow light through the numerous windows. It reflected off of the dark liquid sprawled out on the floor. Somehow it made the dark gloomy room looked almost beautiful in a way. Kind of like a painting that had no title.
"Oh I got an idea. How about you and your fancy arrows fly right up there and detonate the missile yourself without blowing your body apart. Or I have an even better idea I could throw you over there and you can magically ride it into oblivion utterly saving us all." Tony said not even giving the man the satisfaction of looking into his eyes as he retorted. He just continued to suit up. After all he was the best drunk and better with sarcasm.
"Look down at his side. There's something stuck in him!" Clint quickly pointed out. The others looked down where he was pointing. There was a large shard of metal that seemingly sliced threw his high tech armor as if it was as thin as paper, piercing his left side.
Even though Loki had managed to separate the Avengers and seemingly knock them down a few pegs. I guess you could say that reindeer games had dashed their hopes of winning. All was at a loss. But with a last ditch effort they managed to pull off the impossible. Even use a nuclear missile to their advantage to take out the mother ship. At the end of the day the newly formed Avengers defended and saved everyone. Loki's motives were still unknown other than the fact that he was aiming for complete world domination.
His head spun and the world around him slowed. His pupils dilated as his pulse calmed, lulled by the chemicals coursing through his veins. He was facing the window and he could make out a familiar tuff of blond behind the men in scrubs. He blinked slowly seeing the worry in the other's eyes before he shifted his sight to a blank space. He concentrated only on breathing.
Of course that would have something to do with his success as an adult. He’d gotten over his selfishness towards his fathers. Although he still feels a bit hollow inside he understands.
Maybe he's still thinking about what happened to Coulson. It was unbelievable that the imp got the best of him. It's to think we'll never be able to hear his sarcastic remarks anymore; the man was a great agent and an even better man. He died with upmost honor. The world will just be a bit bleaker without him in it. His death however was in no way meaningless, it may have been the deciding factor that would finally bring a bunch of misfits together. They did after all, especially when the world needed them most and someone had to be avenged.
"There's no infection, its common to run a fever after serious trauma to the body, especially after a blood transfusion. Your bodies very weak, but the wound is clean and bound tight so long as you don't move around too much." He talked to Tony in a quite knowledgeable voice, explaining his condition on layman's terms meaning not to worry. He'd had enough to worry about what's one more on the pile. Tony starred at the doctor hearing every word but to his drug induced state it came delayed. He nodded slightly showing he understood.
He looked up for a moment before he finally answered. "Can you take us to the Stark Tower please; it's urgent." The driver glanced at Steve in his rearview mirror as he spoke, his eyes shifting and settling on the man next to his right. He remained quiet and almost over of place until he looked up for a brief second back at him in the little strip of reflective glass. He could see bright glowing green eyes peek out from underneath his dark curls, menacing and full of a mixture of hurt and confusion.
"No sedatives.." He managed through clenched teeth, wincing at what few words he could manage. The doctor only gave him a confused look. It didn't make any sense to him. It was obvious he was in a substantial amount of pain.
It was painful prying that man out of his suit. His deafening screams. But the moment they got him free when he pulled that shard from his body, the air felt heavy. The sight of his wound made him cringe. Shredded muscle and pulsation structures detached still trying to function with its severed counterpart. He noticed the collapsed lung; his breathing made it a dead giveaway.
Steve felt useless standing idly to the side while the professionals did their thing. He eyed his friend coping with his fate. He does manage to catch a glimpse of the arc reactor imbedded in his chest; although vague he could see the scar tissue coiled around it. Given the bulk of the device he couldn't imagine it sunk into someone's sternum. It was set deeper than he thought possible. From the other model it was of pretty considerate size and the fact that it was near flush with his chest spoke volumes.
“Here bring this to him; I’m sure Jarvis is worried sick. Also Pepper may try to call if he’d awake have him reassure her, she wishes she could be here.” Natasha handed over Tony’s specially made smart phone and watch he’d left on the bar in the common room during their get together, she was sure he would miss them. “I also have the charger; Tony has this monotonous dependency with technology but trust me he’ll praise you for bringing them.”
"Thor, you look like you're enjoying yourself quite a bit over there." Tony said with a smug grin painted on his face.
He tensed up again; he hated not knowing what was going to happen next. Stressed him out beyond belief, that was way worse than his anger, he could at least control that now. He didn't even have a clue on how to even begin to tackle the uneasiness of anxiety. Whatever elevated feeling that filled the small space, disappeared once more and was replaced with a gloomy once again. The driver glanced back at him again but this time increasing his speed.
Steve traced the blood back to its source, the elevator. It was smeared up against the metal door and coated the floor in front of it. He looked down at his hand once he noticed the bloody print that suck out from between the seam. It was his. At the time he'd been in such a hurry that being neat wasn't much of a priority at the time. He followed the trail, which seem to make time rewind. He could paint a mental picture in his head like he was watching himself disparately rush out the small space.
The thing fascinated Steve although he absolutely had no idea what it was for. It sure was pretty like some kind of special nightlight. He held it up closer spotting the ‘Proof Tony Stark has a Heart’ band loosely attached to the top. Now that he thought about it the thing powering Tony’s suit looked something like this.
“For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God
To be honest, if Steve had to describe this moment in his life, he would say that he felt like a doll. Or an action figure if you will. An action figure that was so well loved and that was being passed around and talked about and shown off, but never…given the time…to…get to know? Steve didn't have the right words for it. But he felt like this special thing and not a person. And he always felt like he was watching from above and not through his own eyes.
“Spoiled? You think I’m fucking spoiled because I like one thing about this time?! One! ONE GOOD THING and you want me to drop it. Fuck you, Nick, I don’t need you parenting me.”
He remembers one Christmas when Jarvis had gotten him a bike. He was nine and honestly, given the right tools, he would’ve built one himself, but this one was special. It was a baby bright blue street bike. Nothing amazing. Normal brakes and adjustable seat for when he grew. Pedaled normally and could get him from point A to point B when Jarvis wasn’t around to take him anywhere.
Fury stared back, searching his face as he drank his coffee and leaned further back against the kitchen counter.
Edwin Jarvis, the butler/war hero/full-time babysitter of Howard Stark and loving best friend insisted that they’d put their drunken minds together and think of a proper name for this proper child.
Steve watched the older man walk into the house. The same house that held the young lithe beautiful man.
“Well, then what DID you do?” She smirked. Steve still had his eyes shut tight. His body was trembling now from how tense he was. “Because you have done something. You can’t hide from me Steve”
Steve spent his days outside his apartment drawing on the little balcony of his apartment. He had already accumulated over one hundred sketchbooks and kept on requesting more. He also had a weird love of plants. They think it’s because New York these days didn’t have a lot of trees and it sucked the life out of you. Eventually, Nick ended up getting tired of all the requests Steve was making and forced Clint to teach Steve how to get up, walk to the store down the street and buy his own shit.
There had been some falls and fears once Steve tried, and he was hardly a natural like Tony said, but when he finally got the hang of it, man, it was fun.
Steve grew up attending church with his mother every Sunday. He sat in the fourth pew, 2 pews in front of Bucky and his large family. The priest would say over and over;
In fact, they lasted a week and actually gave them hope that maybe, with the right technology, they could save this one.
The tired eyes closed again and scrunched up, forcing something to stay inside, and finally, after an eternity, shook his head, no.
At just eighteen years old, Tony got himself out of a hostage situation, made an iron suit, and saved himself. Incredible right?
Steve was very, very tired. Which kind of sucks for someone who's supposed to be in their early twenties.
Steve did not put two and two together when he had officially met Yinsen and Tony. Nobody ever said the younger man's last name so he didn’t think it was obvious. He was also not around when all types of media were going crazy about him and posting “ THIS ONE MADE IT” as their headlines. (Tony has newspaper clippings of this one in many languages). No. When he got there, he assumed that these two were just caught in an unruly mess of things. Tony was Anthony still and Yinsen his proper guardian. They didn’t know about Captain America and things were fine.
It was later admitted to him that that’s what a certain person would’ve done. Off’d himself. All of his loved ones ...Gone?
Anthony Edward Stark was typed in bold letters at the top of the page. Below was his age, weight, blood type, ID number, social security number and parents names.
If he could, he’s sure that his own subconscious would’ve suppressed the memories of being in the dark cold solitude. Nobody asked him if he did remember though. Nobody could get a word out of him in the first couple of months he was awake, so there wasn’t really a time to ask. After he began speaking, it had already been enough time that it would’ve been considered incredibly rude and insensitive, so that curious person should just shut the fuck up and turn around.
“And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose”
That morning, Tony woke up first and watched Steve’s even breath. Let him sleep longer. And when Steve woke up with a fright, rambling about missing a morning run Tony shushed him and said he was twenty-two years old. And twenty-two year olds slept in on Saturdays still, no matter who they were.
That evening Steve spent it drawing everything he could remember from that outing. The next day he was out of his room, people watching again. He stepped outside and watched. He walked a few blocks away from their building and watched. He sat on a bench and watched.
They humped, she finally conquered and starting chuckling into her coffee mug. Steve’s head immediately shot down to look at her, his eyes ablaze.
When Maria was able to finally bring a child into the world, after countless miscarriages, it had apparently been born with so many difficulties that it never left the little box it was put into the moment they got out of the womb.
“It’s so pretty,” He said one evening. The sun was setting and they had gone out and grabbed some cokes from a diner. Tony liked that date. It was simple. And he had worn a nice baby blue tank top tucked into high waisted jeans and a bulky belt. He wore his platform combat boots too, so he wouldn’t have to tiptoe.
They were on the bench barefoot swinging back and forth. The sprinklers were off for the night. And the air was chilly.
Steve really hates that the first thing he willingly said to a person in the future was a croaky, watery
Unfortunately though, right before Tony’s third birthday, his parents were killed in a dreadful car accident. Leaving Tony with the butler.
Jarvis liked to say he would blame Tony’s antics on that fall if he could. Because it was such a hard hit and the bump was huge. But Tony was still weird before and after. And after the ice packs and dried tears and some glitter applied to his cheeks he got back on the bike and Jarvis had taught him how to balance.
Act as a bodyguard to both Yinsen and child (really young man). Make sure Yinsen and said young man are not killed while also investigating why they are being threatened in the first place. They claim to not have a reason, but there was always a reason. Always something fishy going on. Especially when SHEILD was concerned.
She eyed him under her long eyelashes as he walked in and out of SHIELDS kitchen. Just something about him seemed...
Steve would never say this out loud, but he never got his old Tony back. It’s not a good or bad thing. It’s just something he’s noticed as they aged. He left a part of himself in that cave. A huge part of his life changed when he got back. Things were different now. More different than before.
He had taken special care right before. Glued a star on the corner of his eyes and brushed the blue eyeshadow on his lids. Paired it with a nice pink pale shade for his lips. The eyeshadow and his shirt matched perfectly. He liked it.
Tony’s childhood was strange, yes, but still, if he has anything to say about it, was fairly normal.
Tony, being eighteen,  always tried really hard to show him what it was like to be a “young adult” these days. How people still went to parties and clubs and dates, everything was just louder and full of more color. And grabbing a coffee and reading books in a quiet space was still cool, you just wore different clothes.
His father made weapons for a living and had made just enough that they sold continuously and since Tony was heir to the company, the money went to him and Jarvis. Not to mention the money he earned from the large amount of work he sold to his own company under an anonymous alias since he was twelve.
They raised their voices a little both challenging each other because both men were blaming themselves for the situation that happened that night.
“I don’t care what I wear, I just wanted to know WHY?! Why is ANYTHING, ANYTHING JARVIS? No one ever tells me WHY.”
They weren’t as compatible on the field as they were in real life. Funny how that worked. They’re partnership and team took time and a lot of work, but eventually, with still a few hiccups, they got there.
Later in the years, after they’ve had the many huge blowouts, breaks, attempts, another break, and then officially finally get back together and stay together, they will both realize that throughout it all, they never really promised each other to stay friends. And they’re really happy they didn’t force that upon themselves in a weird way. That they didn’t give themselves that expectation.
Despite wanting to be there, wanted to be the one to lead the team for once in taking down this fucked up person, he was told no.
Tony had spoken about it once when they were both lying in bed shirtless gazing at some stars through the window. Steve remembers he was comfortable and wearing borrowed pajama pants and cuddling in the blankets, and Tony still had some glitter on his eyelids.
They drank their slushies and shared some Nerds candy outside. It was getting late. Tony should be getting home soon.
Yinsen was already gone, supposedly at a conference when Tony had gone missing three weeks before. At the time, there were no threats. No suspicious people. Not a sound. He was supposed to have a meeting with possible investors, and Tony almost being of age to take over the company, had joined Obadiah. He was in his suit and tie and wore no makeup. He wanted to look “like them” he had said. It didn’t stop him from tying his rollerskates up tight and skating to the nearest coffee shop where the meeting was being held. Steve remembers watching him go, black shoes dangling off of his backpack full of notes and supplies. He had been so excited to go too.
Steve had slouched further into his chair. He hated when Fury did this. He asked what was wrong in the weirdest way and Steve would answer after deciphering the danm question. And Fury always gave him the shittiest answers.
Steve opened one eye, then the other and stared. He stared for a long time. He never once took the clipping.
His life wasn’t terrible. Yeah, his parents died in a terrible death right before he turned four. And his father figure/butler/ guardian passed away from an awful cancer right before he graduated university at seventeen. But his life wasn’t terrible.
The young man, Anthony, jumped up and rushed in, but not before giving Steve an apologetic smile. Slipping through the front door, another older man rushed out.
Steve had ran into Yinsen right before they had left. He had to hand it to the man because he somehow could tell. He had personally asked Steve if he would give them some space tonight.
Tony turned four and asked Edwin Jarvis why there were pictures of him in both dresses and suits. What were his parents' intentions? Why did they want that? And Edwin Jarvis could not explain, as he did not know, but asked if he liked it or not. To that Tony crossed his arms and harrumphed, not liking that his question was deflected.
“Yeah, …it was good.” He mumbled. Then smiled bright. His head didn’t hang and his back was still straight. “I enjoyed it. And I think… I’m pretty sure he did too.”
“I..Look I know you still love me, and I know that you’re not gonna come with me because you hate me but because you know I should talk to Yin and plus Furn needs you, like I know but-” Tony covered his eyes with his hands and Steve, who had shoved his skates off, was standing in front of him in just his socks, nuzzling his head.
He reached his hand out and stretched his pinky towards Steve and kept his eyes on one of his posters on the wall. He started thinking about the green energy report Yinsen had been working on. The edits he still needed to make and the tech and blueprints that would be needed to get things done the right way. He was jolted out of his thoughts when another pinky wrapped itself around his.
“Steve?” Tony called again trying one last effort. He slowly scooted towards the other, eyeing him just in case he bolted.
Tony had teared up and listened to every word. Told him he missed his Mama too. Missed his butler and even missed his dad. Listened to Steve and held him close in his bed until Steve went to sleep.
Yeah, he was a genius and skipped half of elementary school and all of middle school and only spent two years in high school. And yeah, he wore “weird” things like dresses and skirts sometimes and makeup and had bizarre platform shoes and bought his bags from different countries and he was essentially just “weird” to the rest of his peers. But he still had it pretty good.
Steve hiccuped at her boldness and immediately turned red. Natasha knew deep down that he hadn’t had sex, she was just teasing. But the kid did do something different than what he usually got up to.
“If anything…where to not go right for us. Like ...If this love between us ended. Can you promise me, please, that’d you still be my friend? I know that’s a lot to ask. And you don’t even need to be my best friend. And you can go hiking in the desert if you need to be apart from me. But please promise me now that you’d still be my friend.”
Steve just stared up at Fury from where he was sitting. Eyes small, slouch heavy. Steve didn’t feel strong. He didn’t feel valuable. He didn’t feel alive.
All for the bundle right next to him, wrapped in a thick wool blanket attached to medical equipment. He tugged Tony tighter against him as he imagined what he would do to Obadiah Stane. That’s not what hero’s thought. But fuck this man.
It was hot and a lot. A lot of pent up tension and both had accidentally hurt the other not quite understanding the whole process. They claim that their third time in the beginning stage was the best. The twenty-eighth time in their early thirties was really really effing good. Their honeymoon sex sucked ass. And the sex they had right after Pepper’s wedding won amongst all past times. The competition was still continuing, it was just a bit hard having two kids.
Tony gasps at the intrusion, twisting in the sheets, his hands tugging at nothing, and his mouth drops open when Steve’s mouth angles over the head of his cock, swiping his tongue over the head.
James’ face cracks wide open in a brilliant smile, showing his pearly-white teeth. “You came,” he says, so rough with emotion.
“No,” Tony says, quickly, not wanting this to erupt into another argument. “But sweetheart, if I don’t show him these photos, he won’t believe you. Don’t you want him to believe you?”
“It has been pointed out to me that some people would look at my actions and perceive them as hinting at something more between Steve and I,” she says, a formal edge to her voice, like she’s presenting evidence before a Senate inquiry, “something more than friendship, at least.”
“Somehow, I doubt that you were focused on the investors,” Tony says, dryly, nodding his head at the group of scantily clad omegas chatting to one another.
Steve prepares him quickly and deftly, enough to make him gasp and pant and claw at the couch, until Steve’s naked body is settling between his legs, and Tony can reach down between their bodies to fist at his cock, adjusting himself so that the tip of Steve’s cock is nudging at his rim.
Tony looks over to see Wanda cracking a single eye open. Something cracks in his chest and floods out, and he reaches out, tangling his hand with the closest one of Wanda’s.
Tony watches as the familiar-looking Nazi spins and heads back toward the main camp, which is hidden from view by a rise.
But when the twins were three, he called the driver in front of him a fucking moron for not taking the turn, and the twins had piped up, repeating his words.
Tony folds his arms over his chest. “You came to my home,” he says, barely containing the urge to rage. “My children were there, you miserable bastard.”
Tony shrugs. “People have been talking about me as long as I can remember. Let them,” he says, belligerently. “I wanted to see you before tomorrow.” He pauses. “How are you feeling?”
“Yeah, I’m sure. She wanted Tony out of this place so she could sink her claws into you, and you fucking fell for it and turned on Tony like the cowardly piece of shit I always thought you were,” James says, disgust lining his voice.
Tony would pull him closer if he could use his hands, but it’s such a sudden rush of warmth that Tony abruptly feels like crying himself, feels like he could live in this moment forever – but that’s not an option.
He slides to his feet, sauntering over to their table, making sure to keep an extra swing to his steps that he knows all of the alphas track with their eyes. Just like he’d thought, the alpha recruits at Hodge’s table don’t take their eyes off him, including Hodge, which is why he’s able to smile and sidle up to him, hip pressed against the table, as he tilts to the side, giving him a coquettish look up through his lashes.
given a shit about me, and when my father demanded that you stop seeing me, you just stopped. You didn’t fight for me at all. You didn’t say a word. You just meekly accepted it, and I realized that the reason why you just meekly accepted it wasn’t because you were a coward – because you’re not Steve; you’re a lot of things but you’re not a fucking coward – it was because you didn’t care about me. You didn’t think you were losing something worthwhile, because you were just playing with me the whole time.”
James shakes his head. “He never said anything about staying away from you. He was just… worried about you, and he wanted me to be careful, so I told him that I would never dream of doing anything to hurt you-”
,” Tony protests. “I had to… I mean, I had to constantly put the moves on you, and you kept treating me like I was your cousin in fucking Victorian times or something, Steve.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, his voice thick and wet, like he wants to cry. “I’m sorry, fuck, I’m so sorry, Tony. I treated you… I treated you like worse than a fucking child. I shouldn’t have, I
“I could have done this while you were drunk,” Steve goes onto say, ignoring Stone. “But I have this thing where my victims should know who I am and why I’m killin’ them, just to twist the knife a little deeper. After all, I mean, you can see me, you know I’m hardly the bodybuilder-type, and that always fucks with people, the idea that a short stack like me is capable of killin’ them.”
“No, no, not since I got here,” he soothes. “They just asked about you, what you knew. That guy, Rumlow, he has a thing for me. I’ve been playing that along. Can we just get out of here?”
“Well, three days ago, I sucked your brains out of your dick, and you’re telling me that you have doubts that blowjobs and fingering and vibrators
Steve is the one that reaches for Tony’s hand, not the other way around, tangling their fingers together and squeezing until something loosens in Tony’s ribcage in relief. Tony lets his head tilt to the side, lets his head fall onto Steve’s shoulder. He feels Steve’s head turn to the side, his hair scratching against Tony’s brow, and Steve presses a kiss to the top of his head.
“So, we got the kids back, got them out of there, took them home. It’s…” he hesitates. “It’s been a long day, so they just crashed in the car. They’re in bed right now, with Steve and James watching over them.”
The man’s smile fades as quickly as it had ever been there, and there’s a new look in his eyes, one that promises violence. It makes something crumple in Tony’s chest, and he makes his way to the shelf of bottles behind him, reaching high for a bottle of whiskey. Unbeknownst to the others, there is a Baretta hiding in the same alcove, but Tony’s hand only withdraws the whiskey bottle, just as one of the Nazis walks towards him behind the bar.
Steve is still Captain America, because at the end of the day, what he was as Captain America was nothing physical, had nothing to do with the serum or his muscles or his ability to forty miles per hour – it has everything to do with what’s on the inside, all the things that Tony loves about him, his kindness and his goodness and his sense of justice and honesty and his persistence and determination, especially where those he loves are concerned.
“It wasn’t,” Steve says, roughly. “It wasn’t easy at all, Tony. It killed me every time I had to lie and tell you something else, to make up some fucking cover story to explain where I was going so you wouldn’t find out that I was a SHIELD agent and going out to take care of terrorists. And it hurts even more now that I know what you were thinking this whole time.”
“So, what’s your proof, Tony? Because I have literal pictures of you at his apartment, smiling at him, touching him. Now, I don’t have a tape of him fucking you, because you’re smart and you got rid of the bugs, didn’t you?”
“Ofttimes Ser James frightens me as well, my dear brother. He is meant to be fearsome,” Grant tells him, conspiratorially.
He replaces the gag and cups the back of Tony’s head with his broad palm, kissing him on the forehead before jumping up and hurrying out of the tent.
“Since, it is your intention to enter into the covenant of Holy Matrimony, join your right hands, and declare your consent before God and his Church.”
Tony swallows hard, dragging his fingers over the images drawn on the sheets in smooth, broken crayon.
“Yeah–” He clears his throat. “Yes, I will, of course, I will, I’d love to share your heat with you.”
“She did, actually,” Steve says, coldly, his eyes turning flinty. “She’s the one that gave me the pictures; she’s the one who was following your friend. She told me that you met him at a park that day, and apparently, you looked very cosy.”
Tony doesn’t ask him about the necklace; he doesn’t think he’s brave enough to have that conversation with Steve, the fact that Steve might actually think that the people that he fucks are a dime a dozen, and so, they should receive a dime a dozen gifts.
“You heard me,” Tony flings back. “It’s actually fucking ironic, you accusing me of having an affair behind your back, when that’s
“I got him that bracelet,” Tony explains, hurriedly. “I won it for him at one of those fairs they had in Cambridge.”
All of their hands are interlinked, and there’s a bright sun taking up most of the upper corner with a blue sky and clouds and a messy sketch of a house in the background and grass at the bottom with flowers.
? Are you angry that, maybe, just maybe, I’m not the great fucking househusband you were promised when we had those kids? Are you disappointed in me? Is that it?”
“He is young, only six and ten, but he has had his first heat. He is a green boy, so you will find him tight. He has all the education a trueborn omega can boast of; he will look after your keep with skill. You would not be able to find an omega with such distinctions in all of the lands.”
“The best one,” Tony agrees. He shakes his head. “You remember the episode in the first season, the one with Rose and her father.”
Tony grabs him, dragging Peter into his lap and tickling him mercilessly until Peter starts shrieking and trying to flee.
“Tony, I’m right here,” she rebukes, looking over her shoulder. “Why are you shouting? Oh, hello, Steve, how are you doing?” she says, sympathy soft in her voice.
He turns his head, and he blinks slow and wide, when he sees Steve on his knee in front of him, holding out a velvet-lined box with a ring propped up inside.
Steve takes to the microphone. “We all know this isn’t about having a swell afternoon. This is about winning the war.”
There’s a little girl who’s desperately waiting for these who hasn’t walked in two years, and he can’t wait to see her face light up, when he makes it to the hospital.
Once the burned-sweet smell in the air has started to fade, and the pot is full of water, Tony leaves the kitchen, returning to the staircase, where James and Steve had made a little nook for themselves against the wall, dry-humping each other happily.
“No, you’re making out with your almost grooms, and this isn’t the show that your guests were expecting. Now, stop it and come and explain what’s going to happen.” Pepper’s blue eyes flit to Steve and Bucky. “By the way, if you two ditch my best friend at the altar, Rhodey and I are going to hurt you,” she says, cheerfully.
“Okay, Tony!” she says, trying to jar Tony out of whatever stupor he’d found himself in. “Everything’s alright now! Tony!”
He braces himself for it and then, sets forward at a run, jumping over a channel of fire into what is now a tent that is also on fire. There are only dead bodies, dead, charred bodies, the air in the cavern that is sickly-sweet with the stench of death and burning meat.
Tony takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. Slowly, his breathing relaxes, and when he wakes up, he’s in a coffin.
Grant has the audacity to laugh at him. “Won’t I?” He leans in, so that Tony can see the dark, satisfied look in his eyes, still as pale as Steve’s. “I dare you to go outside and tell everyone what I’ve done to you. Do you really think they’ll believe you?”
Tony climbs into the bed, which has been changed with fresh, clean sheets – it almost seems like a dream, after everything that has happened, to fall asleep in this bed, as though not an hour or two ago, Grant had slid into his chambers and climbed on top of him only to get a knife in his throat for his efforts.
Steve purses his lips. “Forty-two. Okay, uh, why don’t we go to a pharmacy or something, get some No-Zoz, uppers, something.”
“I’m going to find them, okay? Steve and I are… we’re going to find them,” Tony reassures. “I just… I promise you, I’ve called the ambulance, they’re on the way. But I can’t stay.”
Tony turns in the direction of a familiar voice and watches, with a slowly furrowing brow, as a beautiful redhead on the arm of a handsome man approaches their table, the redhead’s face lighting up.
“I know plenty,” James replies, easy. “I know that she has over a hundred confirmed American kills. I know that she’s one of their best, at combat, at espionage, and she’s a fucking great honeypot.”
“I am afraid, sir, that the doors are as locked as they were five minutes ago,” JARVIS says, primly.
James understands what he’s about to say without him even saying it, and he nods, even if his displeasure shows clearly on his face.
“No, I’m just realising exactly how cruel you can be,” Tony barks, his voice snapping like a rubber band. “You think you’re losing me, and you’re trying to bind me to you. We already have kids, so what else is left for you except to prove that I’m a total slut for orgasms, but no, no, no, that would be too dangerous, right? If I was a slut for orgasms? No, that might mean I could go out and find someone else to give me my orgasms instead of you. That’s not good at all, is it?” he taunts. “No, you want me to be aware of the grand realisation that you are the best and only person to give me what I so desperately want, so I don’t any good ideas about walking out of this house and finding something that detracts away from my glorious purpose of being a fucking nursemaid and whore when you feel like showing up. I hope you feel better about yourself, Steve. I hope you’re satisfied. I genuinely hope you feel like you succeeded, even if there’s more to a marriage than great sex, because at least,
They’re the only ones in the room, not because Tony arranged it that way, even if he could have, but because it appears to be a slow day for the planetarium. He laughs every time Peter seizes his arm, his eyes going wide in his face, at another special effect.
Dr. Zola eyes Rumlow, and then, the chest containing the gem. He lowers the pistol, motions for the Nazis to take Tony out ahead of him. Tony finds himself being dragged backward, only stopping when Rumlow speaks.
The killer wheels around, locking eyes with Tony, who feels the blood rush out of his face. The man’s face in the light is horrible, awful, disgusting, and more than just the withered, burned skin and flesh that Tony can see is the hate in his dark, beady eyes.
“He does, when I’m making the same mistakes, committing the same sins that he is. I can’t stand on my fucking pedestal if I’m doing the same things that he is,” Tony snaps, like a building crumbling. “I just can’t do that. I love him, James, I really fucking love him, despite everything that he’s done to me. I don’t know how to stop loving him. And my kids… my kids asked me today whether I was getting a divorce, and I don’t know what to do with that, okay? I didn’t know how to answer them, what to say, and I… owe it to them at least to have an honest conversation with Steve, to air out all of these things.”
“This is not one of them,” Lord Steven replies, gravely. “I will only touch you when you reach an age of eight and ten, and not a day sooner, and in the meantime, if your… want for me decreases, I will accept that.”
“Because you’ve had suspicions about James and me for a few weeks, whereas I have been convinced that you’ve been sleeping with Natasha for
“She’s… for fuck’s sake, she’s out there, fucking my husband, and she has the audacity to come into my house and offer me advice. I bet I know what that fucking advice would be as well,” Tony mutters under his breath. “All the wrong things to do to completely push Steve out the door and into her arms, so I can sit on my own, like old matron that I am, waiting for divorce papers to be sent to me.”
“Things didn’t even need to change,” Grant goes onto say, as he spreads Tony’s legs wide, fitting himself between them.
Steve digs his teeth into James’ unmarked shoulder, and James yelps, his thrusts turning into stuttering, jerky, shallow motions that almost feel clumsy to Tony but definitely still do the trick.
Tony huffs, feeling the shame flush the nape of his neck. “Yeah, well, you can’t be nice to everyone,” he says, ruffling Peter’s hair.
Peter gets there before Steve does; he’s begging him not to die, his young face streaked with dirt and ash, and Tony wants to say,
Natasha stands on the other side, in a tight pencil skirt and a pale pink blouse, her neckline plunging like a waterfall.
in juvie’s because she happens to be a pretty white girl. If you or your mother had those crimes listed down, you’d be in prison.”
Tony struggles against Thor’s wall of muscle. “He fucking assaulted my boyfriend,” he snaps. “He’s lucky I’m not rearranging his fucking face, and he has the fucking nerve to tell me that there’s no way to fucking
Before Tony even knows what’s happening, something is colliding with him in a dull, painful thud, and he’s hitting the ground. The bazooka clatters across the cement floor as two other Nazis help subdue Tony. They take his pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp, just as Dr. Zola approaches.
“You don’t get to sit there and pass judgment on what I find attractive or not attractive,” Tony hisses. “You don’t get to do that. I am telling you now that I have no fucking problem with the way that you look right now. Whether or not you stay like this, I don’t care. Nothing is changing between us unless
. On our wedding night, you promised me that that would only happen between us when I was old enough and when I asked for it. I’m old enough, and I cannot ask for it yet. I might never be able to ask for it,” Tony warns, “but I will never stop talking to you about it. I will never
. Being a father is great and it’s significant and I know it’s important, but it’s not the same as what I did in college with Bucky, stopping HYDRA. I just wanted something different, and when James came back, asked me to help him dodge SHIELD, dodge HYDRA, I saw the something different. I wanted the adrenaline. I wanted something that wasn’t cutting the crusts off a cheese sandwich.”
James stares up at him in widened, obscene awe, his assassin skills completely useless to him, with Tony moving atop him in sinuous grace. Tony’s hands grip him by the shoulders, his nails digging into his skin, and he rises and falls, clenching around his cock, and with this knew angle, he’s filling Tony deeper, rougher, and the throbbing in Tony’s belly changes, grows tighter, as he approaches that edge.
, they weren’t, well, they weren’t always there, and so, I thought if I had babies of my own, I wasn’t sure I’d be a good
Out of both of his children, he thinks she’s more likely to react badly; above all else, she is attached to the idea that Tony and Steve stay together, the first to assure Steve that Tony wouldn’t do anything that would throw wrenches and spanners into their marriage, the first to ask Tony, almost terrified, of whether he and Steve are getting a divorce.
“So, I heard you even lift a motorcycle over your head,” he says, casually. “I’m sorry I missed it.”
“Hodge and his friends decided to take what they wanted last night,” Tony explains in a careful, measured note.
Steve tells her about the photos that Natasha was happy enough to give him, about Tony and the Winter Soldier spending time together, actively defying SHIELD, about the times that Tony lied to him, the night where they fucked and after, how Tony blew up at him and slept in the other room. Steve tells her about the last straw, about the last time that Tony had visited the Winter Soldier in his apartment, and how he’d come home afterwards. He tells her about the gun, SHIELD’s orders, and the fight that ensued after that. He tells her about the Winter Soldier intervening. He tells her about Bucky, about staring at a ghost, the ghost of his dead best friend, his first love, of a love that never quite died, was just lost somewhere in the desert half a world away.
“Listen, I’m gonna fall asleep. And if you see me struggle, if you see me fighting against something, you have to wake up. You just have to.”
Tony jars awake, suddenly, at the sensation of plaster dust raining down on him, sitting bolt upright. He looks up at the ceiling, touching the top of his head, feeling around his hair.
“James,” Tony whispers. “James, you showed me a universe I didn’t even think was possible; you made me
“Hey, dollface, why don’t you ditch Stick-Thin Stevie over there and bring that hot little body over to us. I’m sure we could show you a damn good time,” Hodge calls out across the mess hall, a lascivious note to his voice. “You look like you could use a ride, if you get my drift.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” he reassures. “At least not for another three days. I’m all yours until my heat ends.”
Tony clears his throat again and rubs his hand over his face, standing up, the chair dragging against the kitchen tiles.
He has that urge now, in the mile-long cue leading up to the school, with the kids in the back, chattering to each other, only moving an inch every five minutes.
“Okay, so, ideally speaking, Scott’s plan would work. I mean, we would go back to 2018, to the day that Thanos and his children came to Earth to fight us for the stones, and maybe, with all of us there knowing what was about to happen, we’d be able to tilt the odds in our favour and stop Thanos from snapping his fingers.”
He looks nervously towards the rest of the class. All are dumbly spellbound by Thor’s low, deep voice.
“This friend of yours – I assume that you’re talking about a guy, but I suppose that the same question applies to a girl as well – are you fucking him?”
Toni’s lips stretched upwards. “We had a wedding, a marriage certificate, and our son was not a bastard; I’m pretty sure it was a marriage,” she drawled.
Tony remembers crying when Rhodey moved away; they still talk, still email, still Facetime, all of it, but it’s not the same as having them there.
Tony is waiting in the cold, university square on his own, the sky dark above him, and he wraps his arms around himself, shuddering, waiting.
He screams into the water, the blood roaring in his ears. It goes in his eyes and ears and nose and mouth and into his hair and spills down his neck and front and he can’t
He just wanted someone to peel it back, that handsome, intelligent veneer and see the person that was underneath,
Tony moves to the wall and pulls down a lever. The table slowly tilts upright, and Steve rises like a rocket ready to launch into space. The panels unfold, and a hood lowers over Steve’s head, sealing him inside the vita rays chamber.
“I could make it so relaxing for you.” Tony slides closer to him, dragging his teeth over his pulse point.
He looks up, and Obadiah shouts when Steve grabs a shard of glass and stabs him in the leg. He backhands Steve hard enough to send him flying.
“A Lego Death Star, you know, from Star Wars,” Peter replies, poking at Steve’s bicep with amazement.
Sam’s brow furrows. “You mean when Steve jumped in when you were getting harassed by those frat boy dicks, and we had to fight our way out of that place?”
Steve’s face twists up with fury, an abnormal expression on his normally kind face, and he stands like he’s about to go and sniff Hodge out like Tony presumes alphas can do just with scents alone and beat the shit out of him, but much like the night before, Tony grips him by the wrist, yanking him down back into his seat.
James growls, balancing himself on his hand just above Tony’s body, their chest barely an inch from each other’s, and his hips start snapping forth in sharp, angry thrusts that drag the air out of his lungs.
Steve leans down and presses his mouth to the dip just above Tony’s collarbone. “I think you’re the most beautiful person that I’ve ever known,” he murmurs.
Tony takes another gulp of his scotch, letting the bitter, burning liquid scorch its path down his throat and settle in his gut, bracing himself for what he was about to do.
“Nor do we need to risk any diseases.” Steve’s face is ashen. “Not that I-I think you have any diseases or anything,” he stammers, clearly concerned that he may have offended Tony, “because I’m sure you don’t, and I don’t mean to say that you’d lie to me about them, if you did, but you don’t so I suppose it’s… not even a thing we need to talk about. I don’t have those diseases, by the way, in case you were wondering–”
He sits up on top of his featherbed, staring at the empty, clean wall, and then, he reacts. He slips off the bed, finds his robe, throwing it over his shoulders and tucking it in front of him, tying it at the waist.
Board members side-eye him at the beginning, and their attitude towards him is even more cavalier than it was before. The reporters relentlessly mock them, at least the straight-laced, conservative media, but the more progressive parts decide that he and Steve and James are the faces of a new movement, a movement away from traditional, heterosexual, monogamous relationships, a movement towards polyfidelity, whereby more than two people can be in a relationship with each other and be faithful to each other and not be considered
Tony’s shoulders deflate. “No, he didn’t. But maybe, maybe it’s something that you actually have to live in Timely for, you know? Like maybe they escaped it because they moved away.”
Tony grins, genuinely, the first grin that he’s smile that reaches his eyes, makes his cheeks hurt with the stretch, and he feels it in his heart. He cradles Steve’s face in his hand, smushing his cheeks together and making Steve’s lips purse and pout outwards like a duck.
. There wasn’t anything that was going on. And I guess, I just… I haven’t seen him so long,” he whispers, rubbing the heels of his hands over his sore eyes. “Not since before you and me, we met, and he… he hurt me,” he says, honestly. “I loved him.”
He enters the hall, taking a seat at the back, folding his coat around his thin, lithe body, pressing his back into the chair.
“Tony,” Steve says, softly, kneeling on the bed. “Tony, honey, there is nothing that I want to do with Bucky right now that I don’t want to share with you.”
Tony shrugs. “He has a knack for the sciences. What else could I have possibly done?” He hesitates. “We didn’t just come to you for shelter though. We need your help?”
Finally, Pepper lunges forward and switches off the television at the power point, and there’s blessed silence at last.
“Fuck, fuck,” Steve curses, breathlessly, and he’s pulling out of him, fisting his cock with a damp, loud sound that makes goosebumps flush all over his body. “Come on, baby, spread yourself.”
He moves to the second page: three people with dark skin and dark hair grouped together, and a fourth person far away.
“That’s not what I was trying to say at all,” James cuts him off. “I’m scared that’s how he thinks it is. I’m scared he’s going to take it out on you.”
“It’s okay,” he says, grudgingly, the blood hot in his face. “I’m just… I’m just going to finish up dinner. Can you… can you get the kids, get them ready to eat?”
Steve looks like he’s about to protest, and then, his shoulders slump in resignation. “Okay, how do you want to do this?”
her house? Do they meet at her house? Tony bets that her house is nothing like his, has none of the little children’s drawings framed all over the place, the toys littering the floor. Natasha’s house is probably all clean, sharp lines, without a cushion out of place, the sort of house that Tony used to have before he got married, a blatant contrast to the time that Tony hunkered down with the twins and made a pillow fort. Natasha’s house probably has a pool, around which they lounge around, without a care or a responsibility for anything, Steve conveniently forgetting about his children and his husband, drinking whiskey by the bottle full, and Steve can sleep it off in her warm, luxurious bed, so he’s refreshed enough to come home to Tony and give him shit for having a glass of wine.
“No,” James shakes his head. “I mean, that was part of it, but it was more because of the fact that I was so sure someone was following him, keeping an eye on him, and I didn’t like it. Besides, you guys kind of forced my hand.”
“Oh,” Steve says, quietly, settling back onto his heels. “I… I knew it was coming. I just… didn’t expect it to be today.”
Steve looks at him out of the corner of his eye, before darting back to the road. “How you holding up?”
Time slows and stretches, and around it, Tony bends, but he still can’t quite seem to process exactly what Steve just said aloud, his words widening the gulf between them.
James startles away, rising to his hips, and his eyes are more alert than Tony’s are, surveying the room in a clinical way, like he wants to reach for a weapon. He sees Tony beside him, naked and warm, and something in his face relaxes, as he wraps an arm around Tony’s waist.
He presses his fingers more insistently against James’ prostate, until James gasps. “Fuck, Tony, if you keep going, I’m gonna come and that’s gonna delay your plans by another fifteen minutes.”
“Oh, please,” Tony says, scathingly, “we’re good enough to marry now, and have kids with, and you don’t keep us in huts off your property and force us to raise your bastards alone because God forbid your pretty little white wife finds out, but you can’t resist having hot curry available for you, whenever you want, don’t you?”
“Well, I adore them too,” Ms Lewis says, fondly. “They’re very good children. Very smart, very kind, very polite. You should be proud.”
Tony presses his lips to Steve’s cheek, and when he pulls back, he memorises Steve’s face like this, memorises each and every moment in the last seventy-two hours that led up to this one, the one that has left him more satisfied, content, fuller in heart and mind than he’s ever felt in his entire life.
Tony meets Steve Rogers in person one night in the mess, when he decides to grab his tray of rations and drop them right in front of Steve, who is sitting on his own, for lack of friends among the recruits.
“Well, I don’t need it, okay. I don’t,” Tony says, fiercely. “I know what I saw, and she was… God, you should have seen the way she was touching him,” he says, his voice barely a whisper. “His collar and his chest, it was like… it was like she was trying to stake her claim. And I hadn’t even
“I don’t need you to fight my battles for me. I don’t need you to talk to my husband for me. Besides, I think that wouldn’t end well at all. I can explain everything to him; I just… I wanted to run it by you first, talk to you about it. Are you okay with me telling him?” Tony asks, practically vibrating down to his fingers and toes.
Tony squirms, having the sudden urge to roll out of the bed, shield himself from Steve’s discerning gaze with something. “I don’t know what else to think,” he says, defiantly. “One night, I was sleeping with you, and the next day, you were gone, and they told me that you’d left the university. I think that proved whatever I needed to be proved.”
James nods and pulls out a glass chair from his satchel, covered from top to bottom in a material that looks like cotton candy. He rattles it, revealing the sharp, clinking sound of the recording devices as they come into contact with the walls of the glass jar, even through the material that it’s contained inside.
