“Really?” Sam squeals, putting both hands on his head. His eyes widen almost comically, and he gets up so fast that he almost trips on Dean’s leg. He runs to the bathroom, laughing and saying ‘thank God’ over and over.
When Castiel explained his situation to his brother, Gabriel let out a low whistle. “Bro, you are one stupid angel. Brave, but stupid.”
“Well, that sucks,” Dean eyes the book in Cas’ hands. A small bouquet appears out of nowhere in Cas’ hand. The angel scolds and casts the thing aside.
Dean opens the door to the right. It looks so much like Sam’s bedroom that Dean takes a step back and looks at the corridor again. Yep, white walls, bright and clean, and Dean knows the corridors here are a little too dark. Sighing, he looks inside again, and the place is empty, but he can hear Sam humming a song from somewhere. He enters the room, looking around, and yes, it’s really his little brother’s bedroom. It’s a lot like his own, but Sam has a lot more books and less weapons. The place looks cozy, and although Sam had said once that the bunker doesn’t feel like home to him, it looks like Sam is very comfortable with the place.
"Cas…" he can't help but say when the fingers become three and they are suddenly so deep that they touch his prostate.
All people but not Dean, not Dean who hates psychology and Freud so much that when he was still at college and he was forced to study that subject he’d rather take a horrible grade to not tell those four bullshits his teacher keep calling science. Freud and his damn childhood traumas.
He takes off Dean's shirt with a quick gesture, almost offended with himself for not having done it before and Dean quickly lowers Cas' pants, sliding them down from his thighs and then continuing to take them off with his feet.
Dean is not particularly worried about the meeting, being the director of the accounting only means he has to talk to the new douchebag behind the desk about the financial statements and the company budget. He’s pretty good at his job and he really likes it.
He does not even remember when he saw the last car darting behind him or the last turn of the Ferris wheel. It was a hard day at work, Alastair keeps looking down on everyone with that horrible grin on his face. It's only his fault that they lost one of their clients, Dean had warned him but obviously he did not listen to him, he never really did.
He is too drunk to think about the scent of the salt that permeates his nose or the constant sound of the waves that touch the sand. There is only Cas and his eyes shining with alcohol, he stares at him amused.
That night he get out of his room only to bring some water to Sammy, he’s was thirsty not even Dean and instead of some water he found himself a nice childhood trauma.
Cas starts fucking him faster, so hard that Dean is rambling phrases neither of them bother to understand.
He doesn't have time to get used to the sudden change of position because Cas is back inside him, with a single push that makes him arch his back. He raises his pelvis slightly to take him all, all the way down, and Cas holds his hands tightly on his hips to indulge his movements, he’s aware of the marks of his fingers he’s leaving on the pale skin that moves languidly under him and he can’t’ wait to see them tomorrow, every time Dean walks in their apartment.
Cas obliges and begins to move, slowly, going so deep that Dean almost goes crazy. He rocks his pelvis a couple of times, staying completely inside him. Dean start to bite his lower lip hard to avoid being so loud.
Obviously being the normal person he is, he had a supply of brand new toothbrushes in the bathroom and he replaced theirs, (yes, both of them) in the glass above the sink because who knows, knowing Castiel, who else he could have lent his.
If it was Dean who raised so many walls between them, it's up to him to remove them or at least ask Cas somehow to do it.
Reluctantly he opens his eyes and finds Cas wrapped around his body: Dean’s legs are practically stuck, his back is against Cas’ chest and it lowers and rises slowly, their arms are resting on his belly and they do nothing but raise his temperature again.
“Sam, you made me remember that I had a home once, a wonderful home, with my father and my brothers and sisters, and everything was good and just; before Michael and the Morningstar fought. When God created the world and banished the Darkness. It was good. It was pure. I was truly happy.”
“Will do,” Dean gave him a fake smile and kept walking. He didn’t like to go to the diner too much these days. Everywhere he looked, it seemed that Cas would step from behind the counter and greet him with his stupid wide smile and intense stare, and it hurt to know he wasn’t there.
They let each other go after some time, but kept holding each other close. “Does it mean I get to kiss you whenever I want?”
Castiel closes his eyes and goes on, chanting in a low voice. He’s praying, asking for guidance, for strength and for protection; not for himself, but for Dean.
The angels were a whole different thing. Sam and Dean went straight for them, no time to waste. Despite their experience in dealing with them, these ones were more than dicks: they were
Castiel understood why John hadn’t left yet. He had been following his sons to see if they were alright, if Crowley hadn’t come back and possessed his boys. He wasn’t such a bad father, after all. At least he was trying to take care of Sam and Dean the best way he could, even though he was no
Weeks without him, unanswered phone calls and prayers but at least Cas was alive in some strange universe, even if he wasn’t with him. Many times Dean wondered if their souls were connected somehow, if was possible when Cas touched his soul in Hell to save him that something was happened. It’s the only way to explain the profound bond Cas usually talked about.
And really, the arrogance. Not only did Castiel completely turn his back on everything he had known practically since the beginning of time, what he had been created for but now he was at "his" home, Chuck home, ready to die in the name of the Righteous Man.
When he opens his eyes a few hours later, he discovers that the sun is rising and Cas has his face squashed in his neck. They go home without saying a word but still with a smile on their lips.
She does this weird expression with her face when Dean tells her the number of his new room but he is too tired to ask questions. At the moment he just wants to unpack his things, take a nice shower and sleep at least until tomorrow.
He doesn’t know if it is something he does unconsciously or if it’s only natural since they are getting closer every day, but whether they are voluntary or not, he is fully aware of the meaning of these behaviors.
Dean can’t be happier reading the mail, sitting in his cozy chair in his office. Even the usual burned coffee, from the third floor vending machine, seems better today. Alastair was fired, their New York stakeholders finally realize what a fuckin’ incompetent he was and apparently, there will be a meeting in the conference room between their new branch manager and all the Heads of Departments, today at three p.m.
But the stranger of the bench, Castiel or whatever his name was, is in front of him with a spark of amusement in his eyes.
Dean looks in Castiel’s eyes for the last time and then stares the ocean; he's already too far from the bench when Castiel speaks again
It is only natural for him to open his legs and welcome him between them, Cas immediately bends over to kiss him, his mouth open and his tongue caressing his palate. Dean is hot, he still a little feverish, Cas doesn't even dare imagine how hot it must be inside. It might come in his pants at the very thought of sinking completely in him.
When he returns from his well-deserved hot shower, there is a steaming soup on their little table near the sofa. He takes a seat next to Cas with a small embarrassed yet grateful smile on his face. Cas pretends not to notice it and Dean does the same when his roommate hand. It’s a gentle touch, right behind his neck, his fingers brushing his hairs, still wet after a shower.
And there is great satisfaction in finally seeing the story go where Chuck wanted it to go, the characters do exactly what he had in mind even if… how long did it last? Few days?
"Cas?" his voice is low, hoarse both because he is dying of thirst and because even his throat has started to sting a bit.
Cas smiles against his neck and starts moving his hands. They are soft touches, just fingers brushing that makes Dean shiver more and he knows, he just knows, how strong those hands can be, how big they look above his skin and he would like only to be touched a bit more rigorously with them until they leave signs that he can see in the mirror tomorrow.
"Cas" repeats, but he doesn't answer, he just caresses Dean's earlobe with the tip of his nose but doesn't touch him otherwise, his hand continues to rest on his pelvis, it squeezes him lightly to tell Dean to stay still. His other hand is on top of his stomach but just for comfort, it's not really touching him. His fingers keep going in and out of the pajama pants, loosening the elastic only to make it return to the initial potion, literally driving Dean crazy.
Which is quite impossible considering that Dean has a list of things he washes and has no intention of losing his belongings or taking stuff that is not his by mistake.
Dean would love to kick him in the face but right now what he wants more is the spot next to him occupied with his roommate. Fever has always played tricks on him, or at least that's what he likes to believe.
They have been lying on the slightly worn black leather seats for two hours now and Dean said more words to Cas tonight than in all the months they shared the apartment. Apparently his roommate studies for becoming an Architect, he is one of the best in his classes although Dean can count on the fingers of one hand the times he has seen him with a book in his hand.
It doesn’t take long to figure out in which of the three buildings his room is, (it’s the second one) so Dean walks along the short tree-lined avenue and he goes through the small door.
When he comes back to lie down, Dean is looking at the ceiling with the most beautiful and satisfied smile in the world.
The quite night is filled by the sound of the stranger's laughter beside him -Castiel- and Dean can’t help but smile with him, he wisely turns his face to the other side so the guy can’t see him and takes a drag of the cigarette, which has now become too short to be really smoked.
But no, he had to endure months of Dean walking around in too tight jeans, winking, smiling and oh, not to mention all the times he bends over on purpose in front of him because suddenly whatever he has in his hands falls on the floor.
It is inevitable for Cas to notice that Dean is slowly opening up and this makes him more than happy. They went out to drink together other times and, to Dean's delight, Cas never left him alone despite the fact that many people have tried to approach him in different ways.
Every time his shirts are on the floor, his socks mysteriously under Dean's bed and his underwear... Castiel has problems with his underwear, really.
“Maybe you should worry about your crappy day” Dean says, pointing to the crumpled shirt. The stranger just shrugs, as if he does not really care to look like someone just got out of a brawl. He puffs a small cloud of smoke in the air and follows it with his eyes until it dissolves completely and then turns to Dean.
“No, he was more. Dean…” he’s trying to figure out how to explain the bond between his brother and his best friend but there are no words to describe it. “Dean was his everything”.
He slightly regrets having accepted the invitation when he sees Cas near the door looking at his phone with a stupid smile on his face, he is probably watching one of those videos on kittens or bees that he likes so much.
You don't spend the last decades of your immortal life writing and programming every line, every plot twist just for seeing your own story completely turned upside down by one of your characters, one that at the beginning wasn’t even so important.
"Not that I meant... I'm not saying that one day I'll ask you to ... I mean, I would never ask you to touch-"
Dean stares at the bottle in his hands, where only a small piece of paper is still attached.  Then Dean looks in the eyes of the stranger who has just spoken. When the place next to him on his bench has been occupied, it remains a mystery.
Going through the administration office, avoiding falling at least three more times - really what are his problems? - he pauses once more to look at the building. There are three, all close and all equal to each other.
December is long since passed, as well as February and we are already in March when Dean passes his first exam. Not that he hadn't passed English literature already the previous three times but he has this thing that if he doesn't take the best grade, he must necessarily retake the exam again.
Cas glances up just in time to enjoy Dean’s little satisfied smile when he finally gets the full attention of his hands and mouth. But his smile has short life because a sudden moan comes out of his parted lips as soon as Cas slips off his boxers and takes him in his mouth.
“Cas, it’s still me. It’s Dean. You have to come back, man. I don’t know if I can do it without you. I don’t know if this time I can make it through. I still need you Cas, please. Come back to me”.
Obviously Dean doesn't mind that there are people all around the campus with Cas's sweatshirts or t-shirts, it's just that he doesn't want him in his room, that's all.
Bela clears his throat, bringing him back to the planet earth and Dean can’t help but blush as everyone keeps staring at him insistently.
It is Saturday when Cas's hair, stupidly shot in all directions, appears in his room. Dean immediately lowers his gaze to check if he crossed the border on the door that once a particularly angry Dean, indicated to him.
Looking at them now, with the world that once again, for one last time, is ending around them, Chuck can not but recognize that he lost on this.
Dean pretends to be busy with something else, maybe reading a book, maybe changing the layout of his room or reorganizing his library for the millionth time, but in reality he is just waiting for Cas to come back from work or from some evening class at the university.
He hopes with all of himself that maybe Cas didn’t get the double meaning that he can swear, he had no intention of doing since we have already established that Dean hates him and would have no interest in sleeping with someone like him.
Cas would have noticed their looks if only he hadn't been too busy staring at Dean's smirk, hidden behind the glass of peach vodka.
Dean... Dean was supposed to be just the son of the man who was supposed to bring the Apocalypse, one of those characters that everyone would love even if he died too soon in the story for anyone to really miss him.
Cas disappears after a few minutes and Dean hates the feeling of slight disappointment that spreads in his stomach. Of course he expected it and it’s not a problem, really. After all he wanted to get laid too tonight. Except that now he feels a little uncomfortable, Dean isn’t used to being in places with so many people, especially if the people in question are slightly tipsy and especially if he is completely alone.
It’s all about be screwed and not even in the funny way. At some point of your life you’re been screwed so many times that even feel bad about it it’s stupid. And every time, every single time, the only common thread are people.
So now he is faced with a choice, take a kick in the face from his bag or politely ask the guy with dark hairs to pick up his book.
Dean grew up with those four sentences spinning round and round in his head till they became his personality, the way he socialize with people, what drives him to behave in a certain way in practically all aspects of his life.
Dean would like to stop her but he is so tired that he allows it to happen. He doesn't know why, since he has known her for exactly three minutes, but he already trust her.
That's probably the moment when Chuck realized he couldn't do much about it. Of course he had started to write them in a slightly romantic way but it was only a subplot, really, you had to read between the lines to understand but seeing Dean staring at Castiel with that look... well, he couldn't do much then. Not that his readers didn't already appreciate it and then they did it all by themselves.
Cas started to like Dean's company a little too much, not that he was ever sorry for it , and Dean didn't even complain when his socks were on the sofa the other day.
Sam is still looking at him, the sun is anywhere in the sky to be seen, all is dark and Dean can see only thanks to the flames that keep burning the branches. It’s cold, there is only a little patch of moonlight and Dean totally doesn’t understand why the moon keep shining if everything inside him is dark. It doesn’t seem right.
Well and that’s not usually a big deal, it's just that he normally wears hoodies and Dean is already struggling to see those obscene arms when they are at home, let alone if they have to spend the evening together in a crowded place that will make it inevitable for both to touch each other.
It was only in his full interest not to let Cas die or at least kill him and then keep bringing him back to life. Don't judge him, who doesn't like a bit of drama and then it's not his fault if Dean reacts that way every time Castiel dies. It is always a fantastic opportunity for a bit of introspection, for some tears, self-hatred and guilt that Chuck swears it, he never intended to write. Dean always seems to blame himself for everything, every time something happens to Castiel he does nothing but hate himself a little more.
strange that right at the end of the long road, probably the Axis Mundi, Sam is there in the fucking bridge, as if he’d been waiting for Dean. Has Dean just spent forty years
“Cas…” Dean’s face turns serious. “You… do you… can you forgiven my sins? Like Cain’s sins were forgiven?”
Cas opens his mouth and starts to shrug, then aborts the movement, still looking at Miracle, perched on a log. “You don’t need me, Dean. You already have all you wanted. I made sure you have everything you could possibly want; everyone you love is here. Why should I come?”
It doesn't bother him so much, it's not that he has some claim on him, it's just that Cas invited him and at least for tonight it shouldn't be a problem for him not to score.
Cas' mouth drops slowly to his chest and then lower and lower, leaving a trail of wet kisses everywhere, as if he has all the time in the world and Dean isn't going to beg him to take him right now.
“You hate him only because Dorothy was working at that same contract for almost four months and then a guy from the other part of the country makes a deal with a local company”.
He would stop immediately if the problem of the entire situation were only his arms, but no, the list of obscenities about his roommate’s body continues inexorably to lengthen in his head; the arms go exactly in the fourth place, above his feet (Dean is not weird), and below respectively to his ass, hands (Ok, maybe he's a bit of a weirdo) and those stupid bright eyes. Dean knows Cas for months now but he hasn’t yet understood their color, no matter how much he looks (read: stares) at him.
It is no longer even meta-writing, it has become a complete joke. It wouldn't be surprised if Amara got something to do with it, maybe it's her revenge for having locked her up a long time ago.
Dean thought about it a lot and he never found the right answer, especially because a child that ear his mom say, “
Charlie is the Director of Research, Development and Innovation, which for Dean makes absolutely no sense but she seems to be good at whatever she does in her field. She’s probably one of the very few people with who Dean likes talking at work. There are so many people in the building.
Often one of the biggest mistakes a writer can do is to write his characters so well that they eventually take over and start writing for themselves.
When they get in the bar, Dean needs only a glance around to know that Cas will not stay around him for long. There are definitely too many people who stare at him and Cas has no problem look at them back with a smug smile on his face.
Obviously first he checks him out from head to toe and Dean hates him, hates him so much. And then who has such a deep voice at this age? He finds it terribly unfair.
. Even that death didn’t last long, Dean had just the time to grab his face in his hands before Cas opened his eyes again, with an odd expression, one of those that always make Dean laugh even if at the time he was too afraid to admit that to himself.
One of the longest separation between Cas and Dean was the year in purgatory. Year full of research, prayers and tortures. Year pretty useless, throw in Dean face when Cas decided to stay. Even that time he came back, with the angels in his head and the absurd want to be an hunter.
So Dean drinks, drinks and drinks, till the ice in his body leaves him alone and his mouth is full of bile. It’s useless and stupid like Dean in this moment and he just smile because at least now he’s feeling something. Is revulsion for himself a feeling, right?
The truth is that Castiel "lends" too many shirts, if only he stopped letting his “conquests” out of his house with his clothes on, all this would not happen.
When he enters, without knocking because he can never imagine Cas is awake at this hour, he finds a boy with only his pants on sitting on the washing machine.
He starts walking around the house with less layers of clothes on, not that he goes around in lace lingerie, but Cas has breakfast one day with a Dean in boxer and t-shirt.
The University of Portland has nothing special, besides the fact that it is 2454 miles from home and one of the few that Dean can afford. The alternative was Alaska and thanks but no thanks, he needs his toes. Not even the dormitory from the outside looks like something special, it is a simple white building with some mosaics on the sides of each window.
Because now is different, Cas is really dead. Dean knows this time. There were Cas’ wings on the ground and it never happened and Dean knows that Cas want to come back to his family, to him, but this time won’t happen. God doesn’t give a shit of them poor bastards on the earth, technically the world isn’t in any direction to a new Apocalypse. Lucifer is trapped who knows where and Jack doesn’t even know how to tie his shoes. Cas had faith in him but at the end of the day Cas had faith even in Dean and that didn’t work out good.
He looks like a completely different person with his clothes in the right place and the blue tie of the same shade of his eyes.
He is now in a somewhat complicated situation; on one hand he would like to gather the book on his own so he doesn't have to pay attention to the boy in front of him. He already seems too pleased with this situation and Dean doesn’t want to draw more attention to himself beyond that which he already has.
"I don't want to leave you alone" he whispers after a while, closes his eyes again and Dean swears, he's not sighing at all like a fifteen-year-old in front of his first crush. Luckily he has a fever so he has a valid excuse for being red in the face.
Dean could say a lot of things, all those things he never said to Cas, their stolen glances, those feelings they never shared to each other, but the only thing Dean can think right now is “I lost him, this time for good”.
He never starts arguments at work, even when he wants to break his boss’ head against the wall because he could run the company ten times better than him. It does not even sound the horn when those damned cyclists do not keep the right on the damn road. He let it go.
"I ... I want ..." he moans when he takes his lobe between his teeth and bites it slowly, passing his tongue over it several times.
Dean's glasses slip a little from his nose and his heart starts beating fast. Neither of them noticed his intrusion in the bathroom and he is free to run to his room, harder than he had been probably from months.
But for months, months he has been forced to look at the other's smile from afar, to bear all his complaints about how little often he cleans their common areas and all his unsolicited advice on how to do laundry and how to cook. In reality, every time it happened, Cas dreamed of being able to silence him, making him kneel right on that floor that Dean accuses him of not cleaning often enough and getting his cock wrapped around those full lips, always too red and shiny in his opinion.
Dean is a set of disconnected moans and sighs, despite Cas’ iron hand on his pelvis he begun to make these small, needy, circular motions, with the ever-growing desire to see what it seems to be an impressive erection inside him.
This is a very special moment for him. He is finally free, nobody can tell him what to do anymore, he can study what he has always wanted and read his favorite boo-
Charlie take him to the elevator and when they finally arrive on the fourth floor she leaves the box near his door.
The next day the fever dropped but not enough yet and Cas keeps putting that stupid wet hand towel on his forehead claiming that it is the most important thing to do in situations like these.
Since that evening on the bus he has been more careful not to get drunk so much. He still can't get over Dean's rebellious hair, his languid eyes for the too much alcohol and his relaxed, full smile. Cas hardly sees it on his face in their daily lives.
He has the most innocent look in the world on his face, like that of a dog before his master scolds him because he already knows he has done something wrong.  He is adorable and Dean would love to touch his hair right now, they always seem so soft but for obvious reasons he has not yet confirmed his theory.
Dean doesn’t know exactly what time it’s now, how much alcohol he drank. The noise in the hallway is stopped. Sam is probably sleeping. Even Dean closes his eyes for a bit. It takes time to fall asleep even if Dean never really sleep, it’s hard he can. He closes his eyes but his mind never leaves him alone. He fall in a kind of dullness where all is empty, dark, almost muffled, full of vague and confused memories. Dean want to scream and shout till his throat burn and the air in his lungs ends, but nothing come out of his mouth, nor even a hiss and this is only frustrating.
Dean didn’t even wash the dirty trench coat cause then it wouldn’t been the same thing.  He took and bent it because betrayal or not, Cas will come back. Dean can feel it, every time he touched his arm. Cas was gone for so long and Dean almost gave up but finally Cas came back to him, even if that time was Cas finding Dean. He was married, with no memories and a weird and horrible name. Gradually they meet each other, after the betrayal and all the water under the bridge Cas was back in Dean’s family, little and broken but still family.
It not much later that Dean gets tired of standing there helpless and begins, or at least tries in every way, to make his body closer to Cas', as if it were still humanly possible, not just to have a little relief but also because he wants to prove to him at all costs that he is certainly not the only one in a precarious situation, considering that the reason he woke up in the first place is an erection pressing against his ass.
"Then?" he did not quite understand why he continues to smile at him but his heart cannot avoid beating a little harder when Cas looks at him like that, with what seems to be admiration in his eyes.
To do so, however, he would have to lower himself and leave the box on the ground, in which case the shoulder strap would slide in his face and let's say that, for today, he’s done playing for laughs in front of the eyes of this weird guy who inexplicably keep staring at him, smiling.
When Cas found out, he laughed so hard that Dean didn't talk to him for three days. It is a sensitive topic for him but his roommate certainly cannot know. Dean has always been more than good at specifying that the limits imposed between them also concern personal things.
It was easy to stay in Lawrence possessing a mailman. He learned everything he could about this Dean Winchester that Castiel liked so much. He still didn’t know what Castiel wanted with the man, because to Crowley, the guy was as normal, unremarkable and useless as any human. But in a short time, with his persuasion – and manipulation – skills, he knew everything there was to know about the man Castiel was stalking.
ecause the truth would probably upset Mary, and Sam, following Dean’s example, did everything he could to spare Mom any kind of heartbreak.
“Shit.” Dean got up and walked towards his brother, while all Jess did was stare at her fiancée with a deer-in-the-headlights expression.
But that was for later. All those things, those wonderful things that Dean never believed he would have, like a house, a family, someone who would love him forever, could wait. Because now wasn’t the right time to talk.
Dean bursts out laughing, and his hold on Castiel tightens. He laughs so much that there are tears in his eyes, and the sound is like music to Castiel’s ears.
Castiel does his best to keep his face as neutral as possible. “That’s okay. I am not ashamed of the way I feel about you.”
Sam also told him, conversationally, that Mary and John had gone out on a date the previous weekend, and that they were testing the waters, seeing where this new relationship of theirs would leave them. John had gotten a construction job, and was currently living in a motel. Sam was excited about his new job. He and Jess would move to Kansas City in January, after their wedding. Things were slowly falling into place.
“Friends.” Castiel thought it was better not to go into details. Dean’s life was private, and he wasn’t sure the man would want his father, of all people, to know they were together.
Dean Winchester always thought good things can’t happen, or at least they never last, but a certain angel nine years ago put this strange hope in his mind that maybe miracles can happen. Obviously he was wrong. Good things don’t happen. Al least not for Dean.
The stranger next to him is now holding a cigarette in his mouth. He plays with it with the tip of his tongue making the cigarette wobble for a moment while he is patting his trouser pockets looking, certainly, for a lighter.
“When we decided to run away, Gabriel's wig got stuck in the mirror of a car and had to run away with the latex cap on his head. The face of our mother that evening when we went back home… God, I’ll never forget it "
And if on the one hand Cas does everything to repress himself from touching him, at the same time Dean has started to do it and a lot. They are not prolonged touches, they are mostly light hands that touch him almost everywhere: his back, his hair and the neck, especially the neck.
Dean has never had a fever this high in his life, he's so hot and so cold at the same time that he feels like he's going crazy. He kicked the covers and put it back over his head more times than he can remember, Cas has changed the damp hand towel on his forehead three times already and he’s always careful to reposition it every time he moves.
People would probably all laugh in front of those serious blue eyes that keep staring at Dean as if they really want an answer.
The truth is Dean Winchester is tired of people. He’s tired to hear them talk in the train, to see them pushing other people to get in the bus, to eat those stupid sandwiches every day during the lunch break.
Dean can’t help but notice it while shaking his head, pretending to be outraged by what the guy just said and slowly moving away towards his Impala.
It often happened that Cas brought different girls to the apartment, a couple of times Dean also noticed some boys sneaking away early in the mornings.
This time Dean doesn’t want to keep anything, all was gone with Cas. That horrible trench coat, that stupid tax collector tie, everything. The last time Dean brought his trench with him in Baby’s trunk, around America, because Cas always find a way to come back. But he’s never die like this.
There’s nothing interesting enough to sightseeing for the tourists, children don’t scream building their sandcastles, even the traffic decreases substantially.
The first time Dean Winchester tore the script and completely did things of his own way, Chuck was angry. Furious.
Cas smiles one last time, more fond than amused. He lies down next to him even if after all these months spent being careful not to cross the line to Dean’s room without his expressed permission he’d rather make him wait a little more but he's tired and even if he doesn't show it, he's worried about Dean.
Now... now he's forced to watch Jack suffer Dean's words and feel guilty about something he hasn't really done and which luckily, even if he doesn't know yet, he can fix so to not see Dean watch him with all that much hatred in the eyes. Not that Dean looks Jack in the eye much anyway since they returned to the bunker and Castiel is not with him.
“Oh, so we know each other?” and Dean looks at him this time but just to have the satisfaction to do the biggest eye roll in the history of eye rolls. Just now Dean realize the state of the stranger’s clothes.
Chuck found himself looking at Castiel, one of his angels, one of those characters put there only to serve the plot for a few scenes, to grab the soul of what was once a man and open his eyes (Well at least figuratively speaking, not that he really had eyes at that moment or a hand with which to grab Dean's shoulder but it had become so poetic that he just couldn't help but put that little detail in the story. Who doesn't love a romantic subplot).
Their bodies are too attached and it is inevitable for him to be able to perceive all Cas’ movements especially when at some point it becomes clear what is happening in Cas's pants.
Dean want to scratch it away, rip it from his skin, eliminate for good everything related to Cas but this is wrong and selfish. Cas doesn’t deserve it, he deserve to be remembered forever and Dean deserve everything. He deserve his heart burning in his body, he deserve all the fallen tears, the pain that never will leave him alone and Cas deserve Dean’s pain, after everything he’s done for him, after every time Cas put Dean above all, Heaven, his brother and even himself, so many times that Dean can’t even count them.
Dean regretted what he did in the same time he took a step in that house. Seeing his body there, on that table, was his official breakpoint. Despite everything, his face was in peace, Cas didn’t breathe but after all he never did, angles don’t breath. His eyes didn’t shine anymore, that brilliant blue that had always made clear the difference between Castiel and his vessel.
Imagine his shock when despite having provided Dean with a real script in his hands this time, he found himself with his back against the wall, literally, in the house of the character he had created for himself, threatened by one of his protagonists to follow him because apparently he could help him save his brother.
Dean can’t even feel the pain on his knuckles when he first punch the wall, the blood is staining the paint. It’s a clear warning in his head but he can’t feel anything. He can’t feel his skin rips up against the wall of his room or the voice of his brother calling him behind the door. It’s a chant of
Dean Winchester is 19 when finally, or not so much, he manages to leave his nest. He wasn’t uncomfortable or anything at home, it just that one day you get up and suddenly realize that the wisest choice is leaving home and choosing the furthest university from your hometown. So here he is, 5.5 feet, green eyes and blond hair, in front of the campus of one of the most common universities in all of America.
After all, the only reason he put an angel on Dean's shoulder was to create this parallel between his life and that of his brother, poetic although not as original as he believed when he wrote it for the first time. He shouldn't have been so difficult to replace Castiel with someone else. Someone less problematic. Someone like Anna.
him. Many times this simple gesture was the only thing keeping Dean’s mind straight, because Cas was somewhere, Cas was alive.
After Lucifer killed Castiel again (or better, Chuck had Lucifer kill Castiel again) he decided to call it quits. Too many times he had brought him back to life and honestly the story was completely getting out of hand.
“Hey Cas, I don’t know exactly why I’m doing this…” Dean closes his eyes for a bit, he’s trying to find the right words, “I don’t know exactly what to say. Well, I just want you to say thank you, I guess. I haven’t had time to tell you and sorry, just sorr-“
At one point it became a bit of a challenge to inflict so much pain to see how far Dean could go, if he would break. But no matter how hard Dean bends, he never got to that point, especially because he continues to lean on Cas every time and always come back a little straighter.
"Are you gotta be kidding me" and Dean thought he had just thought about it but apparently he said it out loud because everyone in the room is now staring at him outraged, even Charlie's eyes widen and she mumbles
But Dean... Dean saved him * and this Chuck didn’t really consider. After all, Cas was all Dean had always hated. One of those supernatural things that had ripped his mother away from his life and that his father taught him to hate since he was old enough to understand what the concept meant.
More than a story, it had become a continuous test for his characters to understand how far they would go and despite the fact that this was Chuck purpose, at least for a couple of years now, despite having put Dean in front of tragedies, obstacles, more great in the past, what does Dean do?** He surrendered to a death that this time was not even Chuck to put on his path?
but Dean is not listening. His ears are full of his sobs, his eyes full of water that can’t come down.
He's hard against him, he can't help but start to lightly rub against him, just for a second, just to see if it's not all a dream produced by his mind.
Imagine his amazement when Dean Winchester decides to stop fighting a few weeks after being on his knees next to Castiel's corpse, next to his burnt wings, grateful at least that his eyes were closed because seeing the two black orbits instead of that look that had become a constant in his life for too long, would have broken him even before when it happened shortly after.
After that they no longer laugh for a while, until Cas tells him about the time he dressed as a penguin with Gabriel for a Carnival and a bigger smile returns on Dean's mouth.
And they continued to save each other, to cover their backs in front of every obstacle Chuck put on their path to separate them and at some point it stopped being fun.
His mother often warned him about college during the long months before he left. According to her, university looks more like a den of addicted hippies with ambiguous sexual orientation rather than an educational institution and looking at Castiel in front of him, Dean can't help thinking that maybe she wasn't so wrong after all.
But no, Chuck hadn't taken one thing into account. A small and insignificant thing that in the end was able to change everything and completely rewrite his story: Sam.
"Can you give it back to me?" he tries not to use a gruff tone but at the moment, with that annoyed expression on his face, he only seems the son of that taxi driver from before.
No matter how many times he prayed to Chuck, how many punches on the wall and bloody knuckles or curses he threw at him. Castiel had to stay dead, the story was coming to an end nonetheless, after the birth of that Nephilim.
It’s not his fault if you had to sit in your room when the dishes flew in the kitchen, it’s not his fault if you had to plug Sammy’s hears when the screams get too loud. And Hell, it’s not even his fault if your mom doesn’t feel like to be your mom.
Dean grabs all his belongings and gets out of the car, he has a heavy leather shoulder bag and a backpack full of clothes, not to mention the box full of books he has in his arms. Like hell he’s spending a day without them, he would never leave them home alone unattended. God only knows what could happen.
So Dean, a quarter of an hour later, leaves his room dressed slightly better than usual. Not because he wants to impress Cas, we wouldn’t dream of it, it's just that it’s time for him to meet someone new. Just because he doesn't bring four different people in his bed every week like his roommate does, it doesn’t mean that he has no right to get laid.
So Dean picks his little red lighter and passes it to the stranger, hoping at least to finish his cigarette in silence after the brilliant pick-up line of the guy next to him.
The tiles are red and orange, they shine thought the rays of the September sun. Of course there is not much sun, we are in the fall and most of all "winter is coming". Dean laughs at himself, he'll have to find someone whit whom seeing the next season of Game of Thrones now that he's away from Sammy.
"Don't worry, if I ever have to touch you or your bed, I'll make sure to ask you for permission first" and with a stupid smile he leaves, as if he said he’s going to buy an ice cream, as if that voice isn’t the obscenest thing in the world.
Oh but Chuck can adapt. He was angry but there is nothing better than a little brotherly love, always leads viewers to remain glued to the pages and identify with the stories. So Dean ended up in hell for Sam and yes someone might think it was a cruel thing to do but who doesn't like a tormented hero?
Even before he can ask the bartender for something, Cas's stupid face pops up again and trust him, Dean would like to be able to repress the smile that inevitably draws on his lips when he sees him, elbowing among the people with some shots in his hands, but he can't.
"We have been living under this roof for a month now and we have to establish some rules" Cas listens carefully so Dean keep rumbling.
Charlie stares at Dean for a few seconds but then turns her attention to what it’s not apparently the new Starbucks delivery boy but their new manager.
"At least come here" Dean says with a small voice when he finally finds the courage to ask, the fear of a possible rejection in his heart.
Or maybe the problem is not hell, maybe no matter how far away Castiel is sent from Dean Winchester, they will always find each other in the end and this is damn frustrating.
Dean is impatient and puts his hands everywhere on Cas, it seems that he does not know where to start touching that solid body that moves like a cat on top of him.
That's how Dean meets Castiel - who later becomes Cas - for the first time and that's how Dean starts not standing him, but hey, nothing personal is just that he hates him.
Once again Chuck found himself watching Dean's soul doing things, feeling things, which he could never have considered, never written even if he wanted to.
Yes, now they have even started having dinner together. It does not matter what their commitments are, it’s now customary that they wait for each other even if it is not a totally official thing.
Castiel is fully dressed between his legs and he is leaving languid kisses on the other guy neck. He is moaning and sighing… It's fucking erotic.
And he certainly could not have known that there is always an archangel on the shoulders of a prophet to ensure that history is written, goes on. It was not difficult to connect the dots and understand who had provided that information to Dean.
Dean puts his soul into everything he does, he commits himself so much that he’s often surprised of his own results.
“The one with the American Seafood?” Charlie nods and Dean keeps staring at her with his mouth wide open until the elevator doors open again.
When Dean finds the physical strength to move again and remember that he exists and has a body, the courtyard is practically empty. It's almost dinner time but the only thing he can think of is finding his room and settling down as he wish.
It's not his fault, really. It's just that He created souls for humans, never for him and if there is one thing he learned at his expense, over time it is that often the feelings, those that make souls a little brighter, beautiful, they are always unpredictable.
Everything started when he was little, normal family in a normal house in Dumbfuck, Nowhere. Even the maps don’t know where it is. A normal family of the twenty-one century where you’re mom never loves you enough and your father is so busy to figure out when is life went to hell to realize that it’s your life that he’s screwing.
Dean laughs so hard that he would feel ridiculous if only he wasn't so drunk. He is not used to drinking and has definitely knocked out too many glasses of peach vodka for his taste. It was Cas's idea given that, according to him, Dean is not the type who can handle alcohol a lot. Obviously vodka is okay if you swallow less than half a bottle of it. They are past that from a while now.
He is not ashamed to say that he had a list of things to say to Castiel as soon as he would be brave enough to talk about them. And it was perfect, really, a detailed discussion on privacy and personal spaces with lots of super explanatory examples and simulations but it has been a while since Dean understood that every time they are both sitting so close, his brain does not respond well at his brain controls, his mouth begins to speak without a filter or knowledge.
Of course he will do it with more style, more drama. Maybe he'll have him killed by Dean, who knows but he hasn't yet come to write that part of the story.
“Do you have any idea how much is a commission for a sale like that? We had to go in Europe next summer” she pouts, her shoes resonate on the marble floor of the conference room.
Dean is so close to tear the cigarette off from his mouth and throw it on the ground but the guy probably would pull another from his packet and at that point Dean will surely get an aneurysm.
He has never been so distant from his family. Dean sighs, he just hopes he hasn't made a fucked up choice coming here but it's too late to go back now.
Dean, now finally free to move, grabs Cas' shirt with his fingers and pulls it towards him so that the other's body can finally be on his.
It’s just it doesn’t seems real, everything is happened in seconds and now death take away every single piace of Dean’s life. That shouldn’t be possible, even in a Winchester’s life, cause is too much. It’s too much even for Dean that is used suffering and see slip away from his fingers every drop of good since he was four.
When he wakes up two hours later he is terribly thirsty and hot, really hot but he just can't get rid of the blankets. He must have rolled up in the sheets while he slept. He is too tired to open his eyes again but at some point he is forced to do so because the heat becomes unbearable.
But he can only smile seeing Dean's head spring upwards, staring at Castiel with eyes full of amazement and gratitude. And he was not the only one amazed at that moment, despite everything Chuck was proud of how the story was going, of how the characters were moving forward even if in Dean and Castiel very little was left of him.
The only thing he now wants to do is sink into the warm body in his arms and wrap his hands around Dean’s soft hips, push them onto the bed and prove to him how much it’s nice to keep someone close and not always at a distance, behind imaginary lines that he created in his mind.
Of course, looking at things in hindsight, giving a soul to Castiel wouldn't have really made a big difference considering the fact that at the beginning it wasn't exactly Castiel’s fault.
"Cas ..." he whimpers when he realizes that that hand has no intention of moving away or at least helping his movements.
Dean opens the door as quietly as he could, he doesn’t want to meet his brother, he doesn’t want to speak or look him in the eyes. He doesn’t need his pity, he doesn’t need the pity of anyone.
In the end he doesn't have to choose anything, because Castiel, Cas, stops keeping his arms stretched out on the grass behind him and gathers the book.
There’s only the smell of saltiness and the beautiful sound that the waves of the ocean make when they arrive on the white beach and take it away a bit. They lull you until your head is relaxed and the smoke of your cigarette has disappeared into the sky full of clouds.
Weird how Dean didn’t notice how Cas was hard pressed against his thigh, how their mouths were too close.
And then Cas... Cas? A blasphemy, Dean Winchester took the name of an angel of the Lord and made it become a real thing, a person, part of that strange and unknown concept that he calls Family. No longer a mere useful object to insert a little pepper to the plot, ready to go out as soon as he accomplished his purpose.
“And you really seem the typical guy who goes around doing stupid personal questions to people he barely knows at two in the morning” Dean answers, he doesn’t look at the stranger yet but he takes back his lighter and put it in his jacket pocket. Dean keep losing every lighter he buys, losing one now, for some drunk guy sitting on
He probably caught a cold because he hasn't stopped sneezing in two minutes. When he arrives at the dorm, Cas is on the sofa watching a rerun of that weird Interior Designer program he likes so much. It's a bit of a tradition on their Thursday nights, and when he sees Dean in the doorway, he immediately turns off the TV and goes to meet him.
"What Dean?" he put his face in the hollow of Dean’s neck, leaving wet kisses and making the skin red with his teeth.
“I don’t understand, Dean was his… boyfriend?” the last word slip from his mouth like it was fake, empty and without meaning. He says it with a strange accent, the memory of hearing it only one time, accidentally, in same sort of conversation before his birth.
Even if he had to expect it, this story was going to hell for too long now (well ironically it's exactly where it will end).
He squeezes a generous amount of lube on his fingers and he rubs it between them to make it warmer, despite this Dean moans when they touch his skin, still too hot.
A cold sensation spread in his body, right into the bones and his muscles. Dean feels that a part of him is dead, his soul is mauled,
He grabs his neck and starts kissing him again because he really has no intention of continuing to make these little sounds, halfway between a moan and a needy whimper, every time Cas' fingers go in and out of his ass and give him the satisfaction that Dean knows Cas is looking for.
Thinking about it, Dean doesn’t stares at Cas so much by the way because every time he needs a great amount of strength not to blush or not to feel embarrassed.
But soon Castiel is back in Dean's arms on the edge of a dark road. Iconic how there is a cross next to them, as if unconsciously they do nothing but make fun of him and how much by now he has no control over what they do.
"You know I write the salary checks at the end of the month, right?" He winks at her, before sitting down on the other side of the oval table, to his right Bela, their lawyer, Dean hates her with the intensity of a thousand burning suns but at least with her they never lost a case in Court.
Perfect, the pain, Castiel's trembling voice and Dean's devastated gaze looking in Cas’ shining eyes. Even better than he could have imagined it.
"I hope you'll find your Darcy very soon," Castiel says in a deep voice and leaves. He gets up, runs his hands over his discolored jeans, far too tight for Dean liking, and walks away.
After a few moans Cas opens his eyes, he doesn't know if it’s for his fever delusions or just his usual embarrassing-self but he swears he can see the blue of his eyes even in the dark.
Cas removes the now completely dry hand towel from Dean’s forehead and puts a hand in its place. It's so fresh that Dean sighs with pleasure at the contact. Cas smiles and Dean keeps blushing but at the same time he is grateful when Cas give him a bottle of water.
He’s kind when it’s necessary, hell, he even help old ladies cross the street with their ridiculous shopping cart. He even smiles, when it’s necessary.
If he had put them on the right path by accompanying them to make the choices he wanted, perhaps the story could still be saved, it could go as it really had to go.
Then there was Cas with is absurd pretense to being God and trying to do everything his alleged father never had the balls to do. Obviously all get screwed up, like always in their miserable lives. Cas opened the Purgatory, the Leviathans destroyed Cas and he disappeared under the water of a lake God knows where. That was probably the longest time Dean believed Cas was gone, death not exactly death after all.
The agreement above provides that the bathroom is free in the early morning, when Dean, always late, have to run to class. He still has the chills after the last time. There was a blonde girl with only Cas's shirt on (which it itself is already terribly annoying), and his toothbrush in her mouth, HIS fucking toothbrush.
Dean realizes only now that he's still in the taxi, a grumpy man with a worn baseball hat is looking at him in a wrong way. He hadn't realized he had been staring at the building for so long and he certainly didn't want to stay there sighing like a little girl when she sees the boy she likes. He's just happy and wants to enjoy the moment, thank you so much taxi guy! You ruined the atmosphere.
He decides to wait for Cas on the small sofa in front of the TV, (Castiel's TV to be precise), while biting his fingernails. He doesn’t want to be hated by his roommate, not because he wants to become friend with him, simply because they live together and he doesn’t want his mother to find out about his death on TV or something.
He does it just for a moment, just long enough to drive Dean crazy more than he already is. Dean really just want to impale himself on his roommate's cock at this point, but Cas seems so determined to bring him to the brink of a nervous breakdown, especially when he suddenly gets up and leaves him on the bed with his legs open, naked and alone.
Dean comes first, pressed against the sheets under him, Cas is right behind him. He stays there for a bit, Dean’s ass keep twitching and milking him until he’s completely empty.
And then, what sane person would lend their toothbrush to a stranger? Or his shirt? Dean still finds all that situation completely absurd.
For a very long time Dean believed that was his fault. Now maybe he stopped believing it, even if there are moments where he wonders,
Of course, he had to imagine it since we are talking about Dean, the same Dean who is unlucky since the day he was born.
Going out from his room was a huge mistake. The only thing Dean wants right now is disappear and never reopen his eyes.
As he snorts and tries to keep his balance, more to protect his precious books than to protect himself, he notices that a book fell to the ground.
Dean lost the track of time and when he opens his eyes he’s in the bunker, on his bed with his shoes and all his clothes, full of blood, soot and God knows what. It’s dark, too dark and Dean can’t even watch his own hands. The only patch of light comes from under the little door. There is a quite noise in the hallway and Dean knows that it comes from the library.
Castiel, always Castiel, who in the most absurd and less likely way was slowly starting to turn his back on his family, the one that Chuck himself had created for him, the angels, to follow the ideals of a rebellious character who does not believe in himself but believes in his brother, in his family, which he has chosen and built himself and more importantly, in free will.
But he could only be fascinated by the way in which Dean's soul called Castiel in the darkest depths of hell, as he tried to cling desperately to his grace to be brought to safety even though aware within himself that this was his place, next to the wheel on which the soul he was torturing was tied, aware that he did not deserve to be saved.
It’s too late when Dean realizes the meaning of the sentence he has just said, he repeats it in his head a million times to look for an unambiguous meaning.
It's not really a nice pick-up line, especially if it's two o'clock in the morning in the middle of the ocean.
, is there like it doesn’t mean nothing. It’s weird and even pathetic but Dean can swear that since Cas has saved him from hell, in any circumstances he
So yes, Dean is tired of people, but he does not hate them. It's just that they've all become so predictable that Dean doesn’t have even to try harder to get something.
"There is a list of things I would like to talk to you about, some of your behaviors that I do not find very pleasant" Dean tries to smile in a gentle way.
He was quite proud of how things were coming together and seeing Sam keep trying to bring his brother back to life despite knowing that it was an impossible mission and getting closer and closer to that demon, Ruby, he could not help but think to Dean in hell. To the pain they were inflicting him (or he was, semantics) and Dean was inflicting and how symmetrically perfect it would have been, given the two paths that both brothers were doing, adding something to the story.
He wears dark thigh-fitting jeans that hug his legs in the right places and a black short-sleeved shirt.
He often wonders what would have happened if he had sent a different angel to save Dean's soul from hell.
And Dean could scream, cry and pray but where’s the sense of all this if the only person listening to his prayers now is gone?
"We have already talked about the boundaries inside the apartment and if there is one thing I hate it is the people who invade my personal space, and by personal space I mean that you cannot touch my things, especially my bed or my body, unless I have explicitly told you before "
It’s with this same though in his head that at three to ten he reaches the elevator of his floor and blocks the doors with his paper folder before they close.
“Well, this seems to me the right moment to tell you. At the end you’re dead and it doesn’t matter anymore. I love you and I don’t love you like a brother Cas, or like a friend. That were all bullshit. I love you and that’s all and I was a stupid son of a bitch not to tell you, Cas. I’m sorry, really Cas, sorry. I didn’t deserve you, I never did but doesn’t matter know so I can tell you. Yes, I can tell you”.
When he wake up things are not better. His headache is going stronger and Dean can’t understand if is the alcohol running in his veins that make all feels blurry, vague, inaccurate, or there are just too tears in his eyes to make he understands what’s happening in his head.
"Castiel, we have to talk" Dean shouldn't scream but he's so tired! It’s not the first time he found Cas's things scattered on his side of the house despite the fact that Dean has told him so many times, personal spaces, but nothing.
Dean closes his eyes, he’s remembering their first meeting. The huge wings that surprised and at the same time terrified him, like anything had done during his endless hunting life. Long, black, powerful. They were all the power of Paradise, pure and innocent, before Dean could corrupt Cas and bring him down, towards him.
It was at that point that he decided to put himself in the story, perhaps he would have been able to do what had become impossible keeping himself at distance.
At that point comes Castiel, one of the most beautiful character Chuck have ever written if he have to be honest with himself and He is many things but he is certainly not a fool, he would not made with him the same mistakes made with Dean. If it is the soul that makes a character unpredictable then the only thing to do is not to give him one.
"Drink" he intimates in a sweet tone and Dean nods, trying to raise his neck high enough not to wet the pillow.
The first time Dean saw Cas die with his eyes was when Lucifer snapped his fingers. They know each other from what, one year? The situation was so complicated that Dean didn’t have even the time to realize what was just happened and Cas was already there, besides him, where Cas should be. Cas was there again new and improved, fixing the messes they created together, as usual.
“I didn’t have a heartbeat then,” Castiel explains. “It happened when I turned human and it just didn’t go away.”
“Shit, shit, come on, where’s Winchester, Winchester…” Dean muttered. “Crap, who put these files here? There’s not a single name with a W!” he hissed.
At night they decide to finish decorating the Christmas tree. It’s Christmas Eve, after all, and, since this is the first Christmas Cas really spends on Earth with them, they want to make it count. Tonight they’ll watch stupid Christmas movies and have chili – Dean’s already made it – and tomorrow they’ll try to find a decent place to have lunch, and maybe even have some pie.
The garage was at walking distance. Dean walked fast, Cas beside him, their steps matching, with John behind them
The angel blade makes the ghosts disappear, as Dean thought it would. But if they were Gabriel, or even a shapeshifter, they would have died, not vanished. So, yeah, these are really John and Mary Winchester.
“Only because I sought for Gabriel’s help?” then a thought occurred to him. “Wait, did he find out Gabriel helps fallen angels?”
And, he’s seen them lying on the bed face to face, not touching, but not far from each other, talking. It’s been happening a lot in the past week. Maybe Dean’s decided to throw caution to the wind and-
“He does?” Cas makes an eager, hopeful expression that gives Dean a funny feeling, like his stomach is flip-flopping inside him.
“I’m gonna take a shower too, maybe that’ll help clear my head.” Dean said, squeezing Castiel’s hand once and turning to the stairs. “Wait for me?”
Sam sobered. “All I’m saying is, you should go for it. The guy seems to like you enough, judging by the stares and the smiles. And,” Sam added, “He didn’t take his eyes from here. “
Dean is not only annoyed now. He’s a little hurt. As if his friendship didn’t really mean anything for the angel. Part of him thinks it’s stupid, because Cas
The other demons stopped fighting and looked at one another, lost, and in the next minute there was black smoke everywhere, as they left their hosts, whose body fell on the floor, unconscious.
“Enough, brother! Someone may hear your words and interpret them as disobedience. It’s not our place to ask why things are the way they are. We just serve, nothing more.”
“All is – “ Dean sputters, disbelieving. “That’s what you have to say?” he closes the distance between them, stopping a few centimeters from Cas. “Where the hell have you been? I arrived here ages ago, and you haven’t come to see me.”
Dean’s expression turned as cold as ice. “Because you had an affair with the fucking neighbor under Mom’s nose. Because you knocked her up at the same time Mom got pregnant with Sam. Because you have another son, called Adam, who has Sam’s age, and who still lives in Lawrence. Because you not only cheated on her, you lied to her, you had a son with another woman, and the more I think of it, the more I can’t find any reason to forgive you. You are a liar who couldn’t keep your fucking dick in your fucking pants.”
In large bowl, beat half of a cup of granulated sugar and the egg with wire whisk until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 tablespoons of flour and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Beat in cooled butter. Gently stir in the apples. Pour into – Dean!” Castiel complained, but there was no heat in it.
“You don’t know that,” Dean insisted. “It’s not as if you’ll go to jail. Maybe they’ll want you to do community services for some time, but that’ll be all. No big deal.”
For a few minutes, Castiel debated with himself if he should go and talk to him. He didn’t know what to say or how John would react, especially if he remembered Castiel from the other day. But if John had been awake when Crowley possessed him, as most demonic possession victims were, he must be desperate and scared that it would happen again.
He’s not an ungrateful bastard. He knows he’s in heaven, and it’s – it’s just great, something he’d never thought he’d have. And wow, his family and dearest friends are here with him, and things couldn’t be better. He’s grateful for everything, and if Jack were here, he’d hug the hell out of the kid. Um… deity. Almighty. Whatever. Still, he’s one third Dean’s son, so he’ll call him kid if he wants to.
“Not when he is looking,” Sam went on. “But when you see he’s not paying attention, man, you totally do. And it’s cute.”
“Mhm. And did you remember to make enough food for the guys at the front office? The kids have never spent a Christmas Eve working, poor sods.”
Sam sighs. “I guess we’ll know what happens to him only if we try, right?” He steps closer to Dean, and this time, Dean doesn’t even bothers raising his head. He’s done with these two. They’re both too dumb to see the truth. “Here goes nothing,” Sam says.
But hey, on the bright side, Castiel seemed to be in one piece. Dean was looking so relieved that he was barely hiding the huge grin on his face. He hovered over Castiel like a mother hen, taking him to his bedroom and adjusting his pillows several times. Sam looked relieved too, but… not like Dean. Dean looked ecstatic.
“Come on, Cas!” Dean called, impatient, from the other side of the street. He turned around and started walking again, not waiting for Castiel.
Castiel can only nod. He can’t speak, there’s a lump in his throat. Dean stops hissing and looks at him, and there’s mockery in his smile and anger in his eyes.
She shakes her Head. “No, baby, you didn’t. That was probably a projection, you saw me in your particular heaven, didn’t you?”
“You know, Cas, I was happy with you, you son of a bitch. I was fucking happy. Why did it have to be a lie?”
“You do?” Dean gave him a stupid looking grin, and Castiel caught himself automatically grinning back.
“I will, boy. I did what I came here to do. I showed you what a good man you are. But you’re a really stubborn one, aren’t you?” Samuel’s ghost sighs. “I hope the others have better luck.”
"Your mother was only taking care of you. It’s only fair that she knows about me, since we’ve been recently spending a lot of time together."
, he’s not a gossip kind of guy. But Jack and Sam are talking in the war room, and when he hears Cas’ name, Dean stops before they can see him.
When Dean laid him down on the floor, Castiel closed his eyes again. He was so, so tired, and maybe if he slept for just a few minutes, he would have the strength to try to get up and escape.
“Believe you are a good man, son. That’s all you need,” John ruffles Dean’s hair, as if he were still a child. “Believe it, because it’s true. Only you can help yourself, no one else.”
Now that Castiel has Adina’s Grace inside him, he feels normal again. Or, as normal as an angel can be with another’s Grace inside him. It feels strange; it’s something he can’t quite describe. But it’s not something bad. In fact, Castiel is glad. Not because of his sister’s death, or because now he’s in debt with Crowley. But because without her Grace, he wouldn’t be able to help Dean.
"Dean, I know," Castiel hurries to say, because even though it's not entirely true - wasn't he just wondering if Dean considered him a true friend? – Dean's expression is pleading for him to understand, and Castiel is going to say anything at this point, so he won't cause Dean more suffering. “You don’t have to worry about it.”
“Dean, no, Dean you shouldn’t… why did you kill him?” Castiel said, alarmed, running to Dean and hugging him fiercely. You have no idea what you just did…!”
“I can assure you I’m never leaving Dean’s side. Not unless he asks me to. I love him,” Castiel had declared, because it was true and because Missouri apparently needed that reassurance from him.
Castiel stopped by the flower shop on the other side of the street. It was a quiet evening, and the street was calm, only a few people passing by, going home from work. Above Dean’s head, the diner’s sign was off, and it was almost sad to see all the lights out, the windows dark and looking abandoned.
Soon, Bobby was chatting animatedly with the three of them, calling them all ‘idjits’ and saying ‘balls’ and ‘shit’ to everyone, Cas included. Sam started talking about his plans for the future and which city would be ideal for him to start his career, while Bobby nodded and smiled like a proud father. They were doing their best to include Cas in the conversation, asking him his opinion about everything, even after Cas admitted shyly that his knowledge about most cities was very limited, since he had rarely left his hometown all his life.
Dean tells him everything, starting with Samuel’s visit, then Bobby’s, then his parents’. He tells all about the things he saw behind all the doors he opened – except, maybe, that he and Cas were together, like,
Cas crosses his arms. “Dean Winchester, I will not let you take our dog on hunts anymore. He’s old. If he gets killed or hurt, you will – “
Just what Castiel needed: the Angel of Death and Crowley on the same side, both of them wanting Dean to fail and die. And all because of him. If he had just collected Dean’s soul, like it was required of him, none of this would have happened.
Dean sighs and rolls his eyes, annoyed. But when Sam just shakes his head sadly and doesn’t say anything, he closes his eyes in defeat. He hasn’t gotten up since Cas carried him here, except for going to the bathroom and taking a shower, while Cas or Sam waits patiently behind the closed door, in case anything happens.
He spent the whole day like he was in a bad dream, something poking at the back of his mind, telling him he had to stop Dean no matter what; if only he could. He had never felt so useless, so weak and impotent before, and as an angel, he wasn’t used to that. It wasn’t his place to question Death’s decision, but to make him almost human, to strip him of most of his Grace only because he had questioned an order seemed too much punishment to such a little crime.
Dean wanted honesty, and that was something Castiel couldn’t give him. Not completely. And love was anything but simple. Even so, the angel gave Dean a little smile. “Yeah, I
Looking at John, who hadn’t still gotten up, but seemed fine, Castiel started walking, slowly following Dean with a heavy heart; there was a sense of foreboding growing inside him. In his mind, he kept hearing the same sentence over and over:
In return, it looks like Dean is determined to know about him too. So Castiel tells him how many vessels he’d had – and Dean is horrified to know some were women and children – and why he had to take them. He tells Dean what he remembers of his brothers and sisters, even if he’s not sure the memories are the real ones, after what Naomi did with his head. He tells everything about Naomi and Metatron, what they did to him.
So, I admit that I was a little bit homesick. Not that I missed my old, tiny apartment… but my computer, my playlists, my DVDs and Dean and Sam. Those boys grow on you and when you see, you’re smitten in a completely I-wanna-be-your-little-sister way.
“Than let Hannah help,” Sam pleads, although he’s not sure she’d want to. He doesn’t even know why she’s still here. Maybe because she likes Cas. “Maybe if Cas asks her-“
There were lots of things Dean could have done. He could have prayed to one of Cas’ brothers. He could have started to run and throw himself over the first cliff he found. He could have started drinking until he got into an alcoholic coma. But none of these things would give him the chance to see Cas again. None of these would bring Cas back to him, safe, alive.
“Not at the cost of Cas’ life, no,” Dean answers with conviction. He just finished eating a bacon cheeseburger, but he already looks tired.
of tinsel in all possible colors. Sorting through the box’s contents with Cas feels familiar, even though they’d never done anything like that before. It feels peaceful and Dean realizes, all of a sudden, that his shoulders are not so tense as it seems to be their default mode. Cas keeps quiet beside him, calmly and methodically picking up item by item from the box and arranging them in a line over the table. It feels… nice.
When Dean found the house, he prayed to Cas and told him he would buy it. He hadn’t been looking for a new place to live, but as soon as he saw it, he fell for its blue walls and small garden on the front. He bought it on an impulse, and refused to listen to his folks telling him he shouldn’t move out.
“He didn’t tell me anything. He’s been here since yesterday night, and he’s angry, sad, he’s… he’s a mess. Dad ended up telling me what you did at the police station, and he gave me the file you guys stole. We burned it.”
“Oh my God, baby, don’t say something like that…!” Mary shook her head as if to make the thought go away.
his own uselessness. He could still fight with his old agility, but he doubted it would make any difference against a demon, the king of the crossroads, no less.
Cas finally looks at Dean, and he looks so sad Dean almost pinches himself to make sure he’s awake. “Jack had just rescued me from the Empty and he asked if I wanted to see you, and – “
"You know,” Dean started rambling with a shaky voice, and it was clear he had been drinking for some time. “I just wanted something for myself. Just this once, I wanted something that wasn't related to my family, that wasn't for Sam, or for Mom. Something for
“Gabriel. They already knew each other. He’s been taking some of my fallen brothers and sisters to her; she helps them find a place to live.”
“Good,” Cas says, kissing Dean, the kind of soft and unhurried kiss that leaves no doubt of the love behind it.
And Castiel had let him go, thinking that, if Dean needed space, he would give it to him. He would go to Castiel when he was ready. There wasn’t much that Castiel could do, anyway, his Grace weak as it was. Besides, he needed time to think, too.
It had been the first kiss of Castiel’s life. As an angel, he had watched humans kissing before, but he’d never thought, not even for a second, that he would be kissed one day. Angels didn’t kiss each other; they merely clasped hands and, if they were very intimate, really close brothers, they hugged.
On an impulse, he grabs his blade and makes a shallow cut in the palm of his own hand. Pale, faint light radiates from it, instead of blood, and Castiel puts his hand on Dean’s mouth. Immediately, Dean opens his eyes and gasps, and a bit of Grace flows from Castiel’s hand into Dean’s mouth. It lasts less than a second. But it’s enough.
Dean closed his eyes. “Mmmm… I love when you do that. Hey, how come I woke up in my own bed this morning?”
Castiel gulped, eyeing the blackness before him. There was no going back now. Dean needed him. He walked purposefully to the void between the tree pieces and disappeared inside it.
Everything is quiet for a while, and Dean welcomes the silence, because his head is pounding again, and the pain is back. Uh. Maybe he shouldn’t have yelled so much.
Metatron looks like shit, disheveled and in torn clothes. He looks like a homeless old man, and okay, what a sad, sad figure he is right now.
Dean looked at them and all I can say about his face is that there was pure terror in it. I was petrified too. Then the guy started to speak in English. “Sam, you can fight him. You can tell him to leave, Sam. I know you can hear me. You need to be strong, this is very important. Fight him and tell him to leave your body. He cannot stay in you if you don’t allow him to. Fight!”
“I… I’ll just…”Cas said, looking down and clearing his throat. “I’ll just, um, go and get your orders.”
I’m going to bed now. I’m beat. Someday I hope I can write more than drama in this journal. I could write a fanfic with all this crap going on.
He tells the guy that he can do whatever he wants, but Dean will kill him eventually. As he says that, the Mark of Cain throbs again, as if begging him to go and kill the guy
Jess was holding a box that she put in Dean’s lap. “Found this on the front porch. It has your name on it.”
Samuel shook his head sadly. “Don’t shoot the messenger, boy. I didn’t do anything. Everything you saw was a product of your own mind; your own memories.”
The pie took more than three hours to get ready, it got a little burnt on the edges, but it tasted good.
He knows there are a lot of cars in the bunker’s garage, but they’re old and he doesn’t have time – or knowledge – to make any of them work. He contemplates using a motorcycle but he’s sure that driving a two-wheeler requires an experience he doesn’t have.
This time, Castiel flinched a little, but didn’t give up. "He is a good man, sir. His soul is bright and unblemished. He loves his family, he lives for them. He is a good son, a good brother, a good friend. I believe he has yet a lot to accomplish in his life."
Dean wants to yell at Cas, he hates that the angel is able to read him like that. Cas doesn’t understand,
It’s only a brush of lips. Soft, tender and brief. Dean feels Cas close and he puts his hands on the angel’s shoulders, feeling his warm breath on his face and the stubble scratching is chin a little. It’s different from everything Dean has experimented in his life. But, even being cliché, it feels
Now, don’t get me wrong, human Castiel is great and all, but he’s just another human; scared, weak and very much mortal, like the rest of us. If he knows a war is coming, why did he give his grace to Sam? I’m totally grateful he did what he did, because Sam is alive. I just don’t understand why Castiel didn’t look for another way to save him. He’s an angel, so how difficult it must be for him to find a cure for Sam? He helped Sam expel the other angel Gadreel but then, he put himself in a complete vulnerable position, giving freely the same grace he fought hard to get.
In the end, Sam traps him, the fucker. From the back seat of the Impala, Dean sees Sam giving the First Blade to Crowley, and he really, really wants to go there and kill them both right now. He looks at Crowley and he knows that one day he’ll kill the bastard. But not now, of course, because his fucking
“Oh, that’s so like you, Cas! Deciding things about my so-called wellbeing without telling me! Is this how you show you love me? Staying away?”
This article seeks to help the reader to solve unfinished business during his life on Earth. It is an observational interventionist study, based on the author's life. Some angels and demons were injured during the execution of the study, but the fact only serves as a background to illustrate the situations in which the author found himself and are important for the understanding of the facts.
“Oh. Um… here, you, you can take it,” he says, untangling his arms and legs from the blanked and giving it to Cas, who promptly covers himself.
It’s 6 AM and I’m going to bed now. We all had a great time together, and I’m dead on my feet. I danced, can you believe that? Me, dancing? I’ve always been too awkward and clumsy to dance. But, Kevin put on some loud music, grabbed my hand and we danced till our feet hurt. And you know what? I loved it; because I was with friends that love me and wouldn’t judge me or mock me.
Then he remembered something, and looked at Cas again, frowning a little. “Hey? Cas?” he asked, even though he knew Cas wouldn’t wake up now. “Why did you push me off that cliff?”
Everyone closed their eyes, except for Death. He only stood there, with a frozen, cruel smile on his face through Castiel’s pain. The light leaving his body remained above him like a fog, floating in the air, like it was waiting for something.
Dean was yelling from the other room, to be set free, banging furiously at the door, and when the last demon fell, Castiel unlocked the door, covered in sweat and still panting.
But seeing his brother dead, his motionless body emanating an eerie blue light, it was just too much. It made everything he wanted to say to his fiancée stupid and useless. How could he talk about them when Dean was in Purgatory? How could he talk about anything when Sam knew that even though Dean’s body was there with them, his soul was suffering?
He took a few breaths, waiting for the dizziness to stop, and got up slowly, walking to the door with one hand half-covering his eyes. Fuck, Benny had assured him that the whiskey wasn’t cheap, but judging from the present hangover, he’d probably made it in his bathtub.
“Okay, what the hell was that last night?” And Dean went straight to the point, finally looking at Castiel with a sour expression that made Castiel feel a pang inside. Dean
“Huh. I meant the rug. The stains are still there. I… do you… do you want some help? I think we still have some Planet Ultra Powdered in one of the storage rooms. From, you know, from the Levianthan thing.”
Bella walked up to them and sensuously ran a finger over Castiel’s chin. “I don’t mind if he stays,” she said to Dean lasciviously. “We could have a good time together, don’t you think?”
Castiel grabbed Dean’s head and gave him a fast but firm kiss. “I’ll never leave you, Dean. Never, because you’re my reason to live. Trust me. Wait for me.”
Castiel went very still, like someone had stabbed him and he couldn’t breathe. He made Kevin repeat what he’d just said, but then Kevin asked how come Castiel didn’t know this yet, since Sam and Dean had known this for weeks. Castiel got up without another word and left the library. Kevin and I followed him, because it was strange that he didn’t know that yet; hell, even I knew.
Well, when Dean and Castiel decided to tell her and appeared in the diner holding hands, Missouri had given Dean a hug and a kiss on the cheek. But she had dragged Castiel to the kitchen and looked at him sternly. “You’re not gonna hurt that boy, you hear me?”
“Jess?” Alright, what was happening here? Jess was supposed to be completely confused by everything and yet she was staring at Cas’ blood as if she fucking
Joshua smiled. “I always know. Sometimes it’s hard to tell, but not for me. I know each and every one of you.”
“You’re just like my brother,” Dean said, eyeing Cas’ salad suspiciously. “How can you eat rabbit food?”
Cas’ breath hitches and he looks at the ground, and even in the dark Dean can see his cheeks turning pink. Such a human thing…
Sighing, he got up and started his day. It was Saturday, and the diner opened only at ten, but he couldn’t stay in bed anymore. He took a shower, brushed his teeth and went to the diner. The place was in relative order, but cleaning was never Victor and Gordon’s thing. The windows were greasy and the coffee machine was dirty. The floor was in no better state.
“So all the bull shit you said is true, only from another point of view, right? You know what? I don’t care, Cas. I don’t care. I thought we had something real, and it was all a lie.”
John looked at Castiel again, and the angel understood the silent thanks in his eyes. As they got inside the Impala, Sam beside Dean and Castiel
“Reluctant?” Dean shook his head in disbelief. “I’m freaking out. That explains so much about you… all the – all the awkwardness, and – and – shit, angels and demons in my fucking life, messing with me and my family, and for what?”
Cas sighs. “I know this is a strong possibility. But we need to try. My only regret is that I didn’t think of this before.” Cas sits on a chair by Dean’s bed and gives him a bowl of steaming soup. It smells good, but Dean is so nauseous and dizzy that he can’t eat, and he knows it’s a sign that he’s getting worse, that they’re running out of time.
The red-eyed demon snapped his fingers and suddenly, the other demons vanished, leaving Crowley alone with Castiel and Dean.
“Dean, Dean, Dean…” Crowley made a falsely sorry face. “It was all you, my dear. I may have… influenced you a little. But you were the one who broke God’s laws,
“That is not happening, and you know it,” Rachel’s tone was heavy. “Those who chose to fall can never come back, even if they regret their decision.”
Castiel found John at the same bar, drinking the same brand of cheap beer. “You didn’t leave,” he commented, sitting in front of the man.
What Metatron said about the Darkness, you all know it was Death that said those things. I even used Death's words. I just wanted to link this story to season 11, so I made Metatron say it.  I hope you guys understand.
“I will think of something. Maybe Ambriel and Hadraniel will help me. They were sympathetic to your cause, back in Raphael's time.”
“What – Cas!” he heard Dean yell, but he was already drawing out his angel blade and facing the demons.
, bro, in case you didn’t notice. You’re banned from Heaven until further notice, which means, until this… what’s his name?”
of Dean’s Christmas nights were pretty crappy, if you ask him – so he closes the door with a bang as soon as he sees himself holding a bottle of Johnny Walker.
The story is not so boring as Dean thought it would be. But he gets a little offended by the comparison: Scrooge was a despicable person, the kind that kicked puppies, put kittens in the trash to die and loved money above all else.
And I’m so happy I came back. I can’t imagine what would have happened if I hadn’t. Those boys, I swear, I have no idea what to do with them. It’s amazing that, with all the shit they have to go through in a daily basis, they manage to put themselves in even worse situations.
Cas gave a half shrug. “Uneventful,” he said, still holding the broom and looking at Sam expectantly.
“Hey,” Sam said, shaking Cas’ hand firmly. “I heard you saved my moronic brother’s life,” he said, smiling. “Thanks a lot, man. Dean is an asshole but Mom and I would miss him.”
The angel’s human heart started beating fast; he wanted to cross the street, but his legs didn’t want to cooperate. What if Dean told him to forget everything? How hard it would be to keep being Dean’s friend, to look at him every day and know he would never kiss him again and –
There was a pause, in which the demon simply looked at the angel, squinting. “Wow. I didn’t see that coming. Why would you do that?” his tone was skeptical.
“There is no such thing,” Castiel muttered, but he walked to the other side of the empty room and slowly put his angel blade on the floor.
“Merry Christmas, Sammy, and don’t bother. Sleep in at least one day in your freaking nerdy life, for Christ’s sake!”
He had no idea where he was going, but at midnight, he turned all of the diner’s lights out, locked the door and took the key with him. He could send it by mail later.
He looked at me with a sad smile. “Yes… maybe I am,” was all he said, and went to his bedroom again.
“I mean, even if you really are an angel – and I didn’t say I believe that – why would you want to be with me? Why would you… unless it was for fun, because I really can’t find another reason. I’ve been thinking about it over and over and I just… this is crazy. This shit can’t be real, man, it can’t.”
He felt, more than saw, something tugging at the periphery of his vision. Dirty blond hair, broad shoulders; he would recognize Dean anywhere. He spread his wings to go after him, but felt a sharp pain at his side, and looked behind him, only to see the Leviathans so near he could see their twisted faces. There was a hook on his left wing now, and they were pulling him, their yellow teeth visible as their contorted smiles showed their glee.
Dean was late by nineteen minutes and eleven seconds. Castiel was beginning to worry he wouldn’t come. He arrived in his black Impala, dressed also in black, except for the leather jacket. He looked very attractive.
While Sam and Cas talked about the awesomeness of Star Wars, Dean watched them. Again. He liked to watch Cas talking with his brother animatedly, like old friends. It made him feel that Cas belonged there.
“He can hate me all he wants, but I’m not gonna sit and watch his future go down the drain. Besides, he never stays angry at me for too long.”
“Sam! Cas!” Dean almost burns his hands when he practically shoves the mugs on the nearest surface, but he doesn’t care. Sam opens his eyes and starts sitting up, groggily, before Dean can reach them. Cas is already awake too, looking around, confused.
Jess had been the only one to offer him some peace about this. She’d squeezed his hand and explained that time run differently in Heaven, Purgatory, Hell, and Earth. Gabriel hadn’t answered their prayers yet, but that didn’t mean he was avoiding them. He did have work to do, after all. Or, he could still be in Heaven helping Castiel. Who knew? She’d said Dean should trust the bond him and Cas had, and not give up. “Pray,” she’d added, smiling.
There was only one thing to do: summon the demon himself and ask it personally what it wanted with John. For that, he needed time to think, he needed to find an empty place to do the summoning and an adequate time. He couldn’t get caught.
John and Charlie would wait until two in the morning and then go to the police station. They would simulate a couple
