He had to break the kiss, to get his hands to the front of Tony’s shirt. Undoing the buttons too roughly, tearing more than he unfastened-
And he

referring back to mindless comments that Tony had made, when trying to work out what people were talking about…
He silenced the music with a wave of his hand and shut down the grinder, a static panic already building under his skin. All of a sudden, he could tell that Steve was feeling
He hated the specific vulnerability this forced on him, the fact that it came with so much emotional baggage and so many personal memories.

He shook his head again, and began attaching the new punching bag.
Tony didn’t even bother to kick himself for it. Now that he’d said it, he realised the inevitability of it – that he was

Well, he was very thirsty...
Steve let go of a soft, slow breath as Tony swept one hand down the length of his spine, and then back up to his neck again. He let that reassuring coolness radiate from Tony’s touch all the way down his back, and then through the rest of his body. Steve’s cock was still hard, and still burned with every slight movement, but that eye-watering sharpness began to ease. That tight coiling in his groin began to loosen, expanding into his back and hips, eventually settling into a deep, hot ache.
Steve’s voice caught, his grip tightening sharply in Tony’s hair as he tensed up against his mouth, and came. Tony hummed softly against him, still sucking gently, swallowing until Steve collapsed back against the sheets, completely spent.
Tony fixed Wesley with a deliberate stare for a second, before he turned to walk over to the wonky desk in the corner of the room - leaving Steve to glower right at Wesley the entire time.
He could hear Wesley whimpering quietly as he unfolded it, his eyes immediately drawn to the letters tastefully embossed at the top of the page,
, that the Mallamens enslaved these people in order to make themselves rich and powerful?” Tony challenged – scooting left, ever so slowly. “Did you know that Mrs Mallamen, whatever her name is, is only working with you because she needs someone to blame for her crimes – so that she can avoid prosecution, and ascend to power?”
This man had treated him like shit, and justified himself on the grounds that Tony
So, there is smut in this chapter, I swear - you just have to read through like 9k of introspection and character examination to get to it. ahem. BUT, when we get there, the standard warnings apply - there is a drug being pumped into the air in this place, and their interactions are perhaps a bit more intense and emotional because of that, so there is arguably that dub-con element. HOWEVER, i really don't think any further end notes apply on this one... but, if anyone would like further details, or would like to make suggestions for further warnings, please just let me know

like it's the only way.”
There was no hint of malice in anything about him, no competitiveness, or ego, or self-preservation. Everything was soft and kind and reassuring, from the look in his eyes to the way he held his body. The gentle, understanding tone of his voice… calm and sweet and

the imminent panic it had before…
He broke the kiss with a soft gasp, his arms suddenly throwing themselves around Steve’s neck with no input whatsoever from his head.
Breathless and elated and thrumming with harmless adrenaline, Steve kicked his way to the surface - finding it was far more difficult than he’d originally thought. By the time he’d finally managed to huff and wriggle his way into an upright position, Tony had simmered down into a warm, musical giggle that seemed to vibrate through the sea of plastic and right into the centre of Steve’s chest.
“Does that mean I was right...?” She asked, playfully.
So, begrudgingly, Steve had hidden himself in the shadows and watched as two former versions of himself traded blows and wisecracks…
But Tony had sort of given him an out. He’d made Steve
“...And I know that sounds ridiculous, and I really want to write it off as a trauma response or a superstition. I keep telling myself that it’s just a place, like anywhere else, that nothing about it’s really the same as last time…” He explained, his eyes drifting further into the middle distance “...But I’ve seen so many things that you’d think were ridiculous. Aliens and Gods and Magic and… And then being able to see

...That you simply couldn’t plan things like that, around someone like Tony. He was just too different, too far ahead, too brilliant to be planned for.
Hope you enjoy :-)
And Steve nodded instantly – because he
“Yeah?” He prompted, knowingly. “Well, something’s happened.”
And it had nothing to do with personal security or the future of the company or the integrity of the Avengers. It wasn’t any of the reasons he’d given to Pepper, or any of the objections he’d been listing in his own head for days. This was something right from his gut. A sudden
Tony smiled.
...But what could he say?
“Okay, so, from the looks of this – this is mostly stuff the Adam’s have recorded, from what the ‘Mallamens’ have told them… So, I think that’s Zan’s family name… So, maybe this is all lies –

And there was this sudden, giddy rush as he realised – he

Steve’s eyes snapped up to fix Peirce’s in a steely glare. He didn’t even have time to remind himself that this was the head of World Security - the reaction was instant.

“Well, it’s been a challenge,” he sighed, deliberately keeping his tone somewhere between neutral and upbeat - the ‘small talk’ voice, designed to maintain a conversational distance. “But I think I’m finding my feet with it. And, I have to admit, some things are better now. Food's a lot better, we used to boil everything. No polio is good.”

Within seconds – without him even realising it – his attempt to get a hold of himself had become a desperate attempt to think about Steve.

They’d never spent an hour shouting at each other about all the things they agreed on, all the principles and priorities they shared… those must’ve seemed obvious, maybe… or maybe it was never the point of the conversation they were having…
And yes, there was that tug of connection, that fierce protective instinct, that abundance of affection –the human forms of love were all still there, all so much stronger than they had ever been…
laughed. Tony saw it, just a flicker of a smile before he bit his lips together – like he knew he wasn’t allowed to.
...This was how it was
And, okay, yes, Steve would have been more relaxed right now if Tony had welcomed him into his life immediately and without hesitation - even if he
Steve heard the brave little intake of breath.
“One day, soon, when you can come home, I’m going to show you so many wonderful things,” Tony promised, his eyes locked on Steve, just watching him listen. “I’m going to take you to beautiful places, and you’re going to experience every pleasure, every happiness…”
That buzzing pleasure that was actually just the absence of pain, just the relief of all the tension and longing that
“Howard Potts, Sir,” Steve answered, “Civilian Security.”
...That might even help to explain that weird...
And then Tony was leaning over him.
She seemed to remember from nowhere – pre-empting Steve’s final question
There was no point, thinking back over the time they’d spent together or cataloguing the few personal insights Steve had shared. Any
There was a sharp stab of conflict in Tony then. The fear of an impossible choice, even before he’d worked out what it was. A hot confusion as he tried to reconcile these two priorities-
Even if he didn’t know exactly what it was, Steve could feel how much it mattered.
And not enough-
“Tony,” Steve whined, having writhed as far down the bed as his restraints would allow him. The tip of his cock was starting to burn from the loss of contact, the tension pulling so tight across his hips that it felt like something might break-
“No, I’ve never seen either of them before.”
He’d wanted Tony to be
“You really don’t see why someone would like you?” Steve asked, sadly – but Tony was quick to correct him.
Right now, for just a moment, for possibly the first time in his life, Steve was

to do that.”
“Well… I don’t…. Not as far as I know, they don’t,” he answered, weakly.
He heard himself whisper Steve’s name, his breath catching in his throat when Steve’s eyes finally met his-
“I’m so sorry” Tony blurted, as he watched the dread rise up in Steve’s eyes too. He felt Steve loosen his grip.
In fact, less than an hour after he got into bed, Steve gave up on the idea of resting all together. Trying to force himself to sleep had proven more stressful than simply staying awake – so, he got up. Without giving it any real thought, he pulled on some old clothes and headed down to the gym. Throwing a few blows at one of the punching bags had always been his go-to solution at times like this.
“No.” Tony frowned, softly. “I mean,
“What the hell?” Steve demanded.
make a difference,” he finished with another shrug.
“A Nazi scientist…” Nick frowned, barely taking his eye off Steve to look at the photograph.
The things Tony had actually said…
how things used to be, before.
People reminded him anyway, of course. And now the fear was rooted.
Maybe that’s why he didn’t stop himself from adding,
And a large purple water balloon held purposefully above his head.
“Right, so I’m going to set this to run for a minute, and then check the data to make sure it’s doing what it should be,” Tony explained, as he sat back from his work. “No point putting everything back together, if we’re just going to have to do this all over again in a minute…” he gestured awkwardly towards the missing panel on Bucky’s arm,
There will also be other one shots, and yes, hopefully that sequel eventually - but I figure people can subscribe to the series if they're interested in it, so I won't be added a new chapter to this every time I add one 😂
And Steve genuinely did feel like, if he started to think about it… he might end up thinking all sorts of things…
Steve’s heart began to race again, as he pulled it free of the wrapping and held it up in front of him - a long, ivory bathrobe, trimmed with intricate silver embroidery, and made out of the softest material Steve had ever touched. It was probably custom made, and certainly very expensive-
But Steve didn’t have time to process any of that before Tony was bounding playfully towards him. By the time he’d been distracted by the way Tony moved, and that rush of fondness for him, Steve’s arms were already opening…
"I tried to stop him, and I couldn't. None of us could," Steve continues, not able to look at Tony right now. "Five years after that, we figured out how to travel back in time, to stop him. And we did."
"Best you'll ever get," he agrees, standing up and motioning for Rogers to join him. He hesitates a beat before offering, "Hey. I could use some input on some new designs for the rest of the team. You'd- well your input would be helpful, considering that your suit's already been tested."
"Did that really give it away?" he asks, and Tony just shrugs.
"Tony, what is this about?" Steve asks, and Tony just groans because he's not really sure.
Once the note is tucked under Tony's hand, Steve heads out to the expansive den of the penthouse and grabs a tablet to do some research. He needs to know what's different about this timeline, needs to know if there's anything he can find about Hydra (he deliberately avoids thinking about Peggy) infiltrating SHIELD.
“Do you want to?” Steve asks in response, and Tony just shrugs.
“No, I am not going to pick that shirt up,” Steve smirks.
"Yes, sunshine. Busy? I want to take you out for breakfast."
Bucky relaxes a bit, and finds that he can't suppress a soft laugh. He can picture Steve pinching the bridge of his nose in exasperation. "You've been with him long enough to know he's always like this. You want to talk to him?"
Steve turns to look at him with a smile. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Tony. I love you for even being willing to think about something like this.”
This is all making his head hurt.
Tony makes a face as he walks out, but it just makes Steve smile. He can't believe that they're considering this, but he realizes it feels right. So hopefully, Bucky's willing.
“Nope.”
At that, Rogers laughs. “Didn’t think you were, sweetheart,” he says, the last word making Tony want to punch him a little, but it’s clear it’s meant to be a joke.
“This?” Bucky gestures between them. “This is not talking, Steve. This is awkward, and painful. Neither of us want to do this, so please, let’s just give it up.”
“No harm done,” Bucky replies easily, downing an overlarge gulp of cognac. “Really. I just hope I didn’t put a damper on your celebration.”
“Good.” Steve stands, holding out a hand for Steve to shake. It’s accepted and Steve offers an apologetic smile.
“Rogers, you’re a fucking tease,” Tony groans, eyes falling closed. He hears an exasperated laugh.
Rogers had also sat extremely close to him; far too close for someone that seemed to hate his guts a week ago.
“Okay, that’s good.” Tony motions Rogers over. “Feedback?”
He doesn’t think he ever quite stopped loving Bucky though. And that’s the problem. He was fine
Which is nice, but Tony's perfectly capable of choosing not to hole himself away. He just chooses to.
“Next time,” Bucky chuckles. By this point the car’s pulled up to his apartment, and as they exchange goodbyes and Bucky heads upstairs, he’s feeling a bit better about this. Weddings are no big deal.
“I feel like I’m going to regret saying yes, but yes.”
But Steve’s still the most amazing partner Tony could ever imagine. Tony doesn’t feel like a thing has changed between him and Steve; if anything, their relationship has improved.
“Maybe it wasn’t just for Tony,” Steve says, which confuses the hell out of Bucky. “Glad to know that you’re too much of a coward to see me, though.”
“I don’t know. But I do know I trust you to be honest with me. And I know that your happiness is the most important thing to me. So if that means Bucky’s in our lives, that’s what it means.”
“Sorry,” is all Steve says in reply. Tony just shrugs.
"Some of us were frozen for almost seven decades," Rogers retorts, but he's smiling. The sight sends a rush of warmth through Tony, which he still doesn't quite understand, because two weeks ago he'd have pushed Rogers off the helicarrier without a second thought.
Steve shows him how to work the bracelet, what to expect, and the most important thing; where to find Peggy. He clasps Steve’s shoulders, and then Steve’s gone.
Again, Bucky is surprised; he hadn’t expected Stark to be this casual.
When the day of the wedding actually arrives, Bucky has vague second thoughts. He still thinks it’s a little strange that he’s attending the wedding of someone he barely knows, but he and Tony have met up for lunch a few times, plus they’re in regular contact now for the Air Force.
“Just a little place I know,” Stark replies, reaching for the liquor bottle to refill his own glass. They fall into another easy conversation as the car drives, Bucky deciding after another glass of cognac that he‘s definitely working on a crush on Stark. He wonders if Stark’s single.
“When I was just out of the ice, I missed home something bad,” he finally says. “When I was you, I guess. All I thought about was that plane, the water and ice, Peggy. Losing all of it...well, it was worse than if I’d died. I’d have given anything to go back to it. And I think you would too.”
"Yes, I'm sure. Go talk to him."
"Yeah, that's fine. I'm busy today, but we can do tomorrow if you want."
An arched eyebrow is his answer, and Steve’s honestly not sure why he hasn’t been clocked yet. He would’ve clocked him if he were...him. Which he is, but he’s not.
“Hey. Question.” Tony tosses his shirt in the direction of the closet. Steve looks over, and god, Tony loves him. He’s just...Steve. He’s perfect.
“Sure,” Bucky smiles. “Sounds great.” Stark nods, a smile on his face.
“I know you miss her,” he says to...himself, hoping he’s willing to listen. “What if you had a chance to get that dance you promised her?”
Tony sits next to him and starts speaking, pointing out things on the screen that don’t quite register, partially because they’re way too technical for him, and partially because of Tony’s proximity.
Peggy. Steve loves her, so much, and he knows he could never leave her twice; if he goes back to her, he knows he’ll stay, which means he’ll never get the chance to fix things with Tony.
“I could live off this stuff,” he says appreciatively, setting the glass on the table. “How've you been?”
Steve can't even say the words. His eyes squeeze shut, trying to stave off the tears as the vision of Tony's face, burned and mangled from the gauntlet, eyes staring sightlessly into nothing, surfaces in his mind.
At that, Steve laughs too. “Yeah, I guess I do. Was good to see you, Buck.”
Which led him to today. He was in the back of a military vehicle, on his way to meet with the famed Tony Stark, widely considered one of the most brilliant engineers in the world and one of the most notable philanthropists. Stark routinely provided the Air Force with consults and upgrades, everything environmentally friendly and sustainably produced. Stark’s company allegedly had zero carbon footprint, which Bucky found pretty incredible.
“Don’t let me keep you,” Bucky says, trying for a smile.
“Wait,” he says before...he can throw the punch. “Just give me a chance to explain.”
"You could say that," Rogers replies, hand squeezing Tony's gently. Tony flips his hand up and allows their fingers to lace together, and feels something click into place somewhere deep down.
“So.” Steve passes over a cup and sits down, Tony following suit. “Were you serious about what you said last night?”
“Sit. I have some prototype ideas I want you to look at.”
"He's being an idiot, isn't he?" Steve says in greeting.
It had been hard, at first. Bucky would come to the tower and they’d drink, have fun, and enjoy each other’s company, but some nights Steve would lay in bed for hours, sleep eluding him. Those were the nights Tony hated most, because there wasn’t anything he could do to help, except be a comforting presence.
Goddamnit. Tony reaches out a hand as Steve approaches, saying, “This is the guy I’ve been working with, from the Air Force. Captain-“
Oh, well this is easy. “You think Tony Stark has a nice ass,” he smirks. Steve looks horrified.
“Who are you?” Steve demands, menacing, and Steve wonders if this is worth laughing over. The blow to his head that he gave...himself, must’ve given him a concussion.
Tony nods brusquely. “Great. I’ve got a few adjustments to make, and you can start using it at the end of the week.”
"Ha, see?" Tony exclaims, triumphant. "You can't lie to me, Rogers, you want to bang him."
Waiting for him when he reaches the lab, is Tony himself. Steve knows he’s staring, but he can’t quite help himself. He watched Tony die; to see him alive, vibrant and whole, is nothing short of a miracle.
“Tony, for God’s sake,” Steve says, exasperated, but Bucky can see the smile threatening to break free as Tony winds his arms around Bucky’s waist.
“Can we?” Bucky asks, sitting back and taking another drink of his coffee. “Can we, honestly?”
. Knowing that Tony would be the moment that Steve thought back to, over and over. That this intimate, personal desire of Steve’s would belong to him. Tony
Steve watched him bite his bottom lip, very softly.
this moment in 1970. He felt that.
Steve had been so careful not to acknowledge that comparison, so careful not to wonder why Tony had never been this understanding or forgiving or helpful when
“Well, whatever did it, we’d better go before they fix it – whatever we’re about to run into, it’s better than staying here.”
All of a sudden, everything seemed anxious and tenuous and confusing again….
Why should he feel obliged to have an answer to everything, when he hadn’t in the forties?
...It struck him as unlikely.
“Let’s never tell them that my Kryptonite is balls,” Steve squeaked out - not sure how Tony had understood it, but assuming that the high gasp of pain was a response.
“Hey boss,” Happy panted, as he jogged awkwardly up to the scene. “What happened here?”
“Well, from the sounds of it, if I did try to donate my blood to a hospital – like you were saying more people should do – then it’d just end up in the reject batch anyway. Which you seem okay with taking-”
...His hair all soft, almost curling at the back of his neck
totally devoted to Steve.
And then he felt Steve’s fingers, flitting quickly down the line of buttons of the front of his shirt. The sudden thrill of air on his chest – and then the heat of Steve’s palm, pressed against his skin. And he sat up enough to let Steve run his hands over his shoulders, pushing his shirt down over his arms –
the rooms he could’ve passed out drunk in-
That he didn’t even know if he’d just done something insensitive or damaging, at the worst possible time-
Or not.
Maybe… Maybe this was just the moment that Tony realised that it
So that Tony
It occurred to Steve that he never thought he’d watch Tony and Bucky talking as inconsequentially as that… that, thinking about it, he never thought he’d see them take on Peter and Shuri in a water balloon fight…
“No, I just…” Steve started, obviously still somewhat giddy. And then the dazed smile broke into a full out grin as he carried on, “I was just wondering if you’d thought about what you want for Christmas, is all.”
“Fuck me, use me, take whatever you need,” Tony panted, moving his hand so that he could push himself up on Steve’s shoulder – earning a sharp cry of pleading objection.
"You realize what time it is, right?" he says in greeting, but he smiles when he hears Tony laugh.
Maybe it’s just because it’s a wedding; as the ceremony progresses, Bucky can’t help but feel...not possessiveness, but the feeling that this was the life
“Then yes, 100% serious.” Tony stands up and walks to the counter, returning with the coffee pot. “I can’t explain it, but it’s been stuck in my head for weeks now.”
Rogers offers a smile. “It’s great, Ton-Stark,” he says, and isn’t that odd.
, maybe Tony is that kind of girl. “No pressure, okay? I can wait.”
It takes just three days to finish. He calls Rogers back, careful this time to watch him. The same stifled familiarity is on his face as he walks in, like seeing Tony is a miracle he can’t believe.
Bucky follows Stark into the building - a large, slightly ostentatious tower, but the engineering behind it is something Bucky’s read up on a bit. He’s impressed. Stark leads him to an elevator and up into a spacious office, where he gestures for Bucky to sit on a couch, taking a seat next to him.
"What?" Tony finally asks, voice gentler now.
"No idea," Tony says honestly. Rogers hasn't let go, and Tony doesn't really want to. Rogers feels like an anchor, keeping Tony from drifting away. “I have a million projects I could work on.”
“That sounds great,” he says sincerely, seeming to surprise Tony again.
“I mean you were at my wedding.” Steve feels so incredibly awkward. “Nothing much else to say.”
This is absolutely fine. Not a bad idea at all.
Smile still plastered on, he sucks it up and slogs through the reception, making sure to keep his distance from anyone that might recognize him for fear of his presence causing a scene.
me to sleep with Bucky?” Steve asks, and Tony’s just made a huge mess of this talk. He doesn’t think he actively
“Tony,” Steve chastises, turning slightly to Bucky. “You want this?”
“Sorry about the hit. Just seemed out there, even for the future.”
“Can’t complain,” Bucky lies, but there’s some truth in it. He hasn’t been wallowing, anyway. Tony arches an eyebrow.
"Pretty much," Steve agrees.
Rogers pulls back, face flushed and lips swollen and Tony thinks he’s never been more attractive in the past few hours he’s actually found Rogers attractive. “Come on.”
There's a long moment of silence. Tony lets out a long breath after a moment, and sits back against the back of the sofa.
When Tony left work for work this morning, he'd specifically mentioned that Bucky wasn’t going to be there today, so at least if Steve calls him he won’t be talking to Bucky and Tony.
“Thanks. Ridiculous, isn’t it? All the formality and fancy shit,” Tony laughs. “But you know me, I like to throw a good party.”
Steve knows exactly what to do. He just hopes it works.
The end of the following week finds Bucky again, on his way to Stark Industries for a meeting with Tony. They’ve exchanged texts as per usual, and neither of them had brought up the encounter at the wedding.
“Sounds great.”
"Promise," he agrees. He leans in to kiss Tony, who stops him with a hand on his chest.
“I was what, twenty two?” Steve shoots back, defensive. “I wasn’t the one that couldn’t have given a shit that their boyfriend needed support,
“Sure,” Steve agrees, twisting his wedding band absentmindedly. “He was my first real...anything. I loved him, but not like I want to go back to him. I love you, Tony. I married you.”
"Maybe I realized I was wrong," Rogers counters. Tony figures that's reasonable, but it's still suspicious.
. I don’t know where this came from, but if Bucky’s making you uncomfortable then him hanging around so much stops. You are the most important thing to me.”
Rogers just nods. When he’s in the suit, Tony looks it over appraisingly. “Turn around.” He motions with his hand. Rogers complies, turning to face the opposite wall. Tony takes a moment to appreciate the suit’s design, and it seems to fit well.
Tony - sun bright, sharp wit and the kindest heart Steve’s ever seen; how could Steve pick anyone but Tony? He knows Peggy lived a full life, a happy life filled with joy and love and family. Just not with him.
“Congrats,” Bucky smiles, genuinely happy for Tony now that Steve isn’t in view.
“I may not have, but Tony did,” Steve replies, which doesn’t make Bucky feel any better. “And if I’d known you were who he invited, I’d have wanted you there.”
It’s almost like old times. Bucky talks about his time in the military and Steve talks about his own work, not all that surprised when Bucky listens with rapt attention. Steve thinks he’s trying to make up for seeming disinterested all those years ago.
"Maybe I'm still not sure what the truth is," Rogers retorts, and it makes Tony sigh.
Nothing quite like compounding that disappointment. Bucky nods; he has no reference point at all. “Well congrats,” he manages, and he thinks he’s doing a decent job of disguising his feelings.
Very well, if Tony’s being honest.
The look on Rogers’s face when he stepped off the elevator was the same look that Pepper had when Tony was rescued from Afghanistan. Like they were seeing ghosts; people they thought were dead, brought back to life.
As time passes, Tony thinks they settle into a comfortable routine; Steve and Bucky spent weeks dancing around each other before Tony finally exclaimed that he didn’t care that they still had feelings for each other, because he doesn’t. They'd relaxed a little after that.
“Not at all. Just saying I’ve got a good feeling.”
Rogers just sighs, seeming to debate internally for a long moment before answering. "I just- I feel like I missed a chance to get to know you better. You're a good guy, Stark, and I'd like it if we could be friends."
"Well hopefully, since now. If that's something you're into."
“I think you should talk to him,” Steve says, chuckling when Tony’s eyes go wide. “I do. Then he’ll know you want it and I’m not pushing you into anything.”
"Just every other," Tony quips, but he's smiling now too. He doesn't get what's happening, why all of a sudden he's so drawn in by Rogers. Maybe it's the connection to Tony's own past through his dad.
He figures that’s reasonable.
For the first time in decades, Steve Rogers finally felt at peace.
that Tony can’t help but smile. He walks up, silent, and bends down to kiss Steve’s cheek. Steve doesn’t even flinch, instead turning his head to capture Tony’s lips.
“Okay, just for that, I’m not putting out ever.”
"Guilty," Tony agrees as Steve settles down next to him. "So did we admit something yet?"
Maybe it’s nothing. Tony doesn’t think it’s nothing, but without any more information, he can’t draw any conclusions.
Is it manipulation, he wonders, to use that knowledge to get Tony to fall for him? There was always a part of him that felt like Tony might have felt
Good, that takes care of Tony’s next question. He plows onward. “Do you want to?”
He doesn’t really remember what happened in this timeline; all he remembers is Tony telling him that Loki got away with the Tesseract, but he never said how. He steps inside the tower, leaving his bike parked outside, and is immediately directed to the elevator.
"You're a lousy liar too, Stark," he says, and Tony leans up to kiss him because he's there, and he's perfect. Tony loves him so much.
to do anything. Bucky’s become a good friend; Tony doesn’t have enough of them. He’s fun, unassuming, appreciates good liquor, and if Tony’s being honest, nice to look at. Not that he’d ever stray from Steve (anyone that’d want to is insane), but he can appreciate an attractive man.
“So,” Tony agrees. Rogers appears to hesitate for a brief moment, and then leans in to kiss him.
He’s sure it’s because Steve felt like he was ditching Tony, but a tiny part of him feels like it was because Steve missed him.
Still, things like a private car being sent for him are unexpected. The driver opens the rear door, and Stark is sitting there, waiting with a glass of what looks like bourbon in his hand.
“Go on, officially kiss and make up,” Tony instructs, which makes them all laugh.
“I am known for it,” he agrees, and Bucky wonders how terrible of an idea it’d be to go to the wedding. Apparently he and Tony are friends now, which makes Bucky wonder how many actual friends Tony really has; he’s rich, powerful, and really attractive, which is exactly the kind of man that attracts others to him not because of who he is, but what he can give them.
Tony notices that after the suit is finished, Rogers is around more; he seems to make a point of "dropping in" for lunch, or a drink, with the excuse that he wants to make sure Tony's not just holing himself up in his lab.
, but it's still hard.
Which is, of course, unproductive. Steve loves Tony, and isn't interested in a life that Tony isn't in. Eventually the feelings will dissipate.
“You were the one that left me,” Bucky retorts, but he sits back down.
After an hour, Steve’s phone chimes with a text from Tony. He glances at it and flips the phone over while flipping the switch to silence it.
He’s really glad he took the Pym Particles he did now.
Despite all his initial eagerness, when Steve’s finally given a chance to see Tony again, he’s nervous. He can’t tell anyone he’s from the future, though maybe one day he’ll be able to share that.
“So you are making me your sex slave?” Bucky asks with a sly grin.
"So why are you saying you want to have a date with me, if you're married?" Bucky finally tries. Tony shrugs.
Steve isn’t sure this is a productive conversation, but it’s cathartic. “I can’t say I’m unhappy where I ended up,” he admits, because he wouldn’t trade Tony for the world. “But I know what you mean. We were good together.”
"God, Tony," he sighs, head dropping back on the sofa as he turns to look at Tony. "I really don't want to fuck everything up."
Finally, it seems to settle. Tony isn’t sure what changed, but he’s not going to complain. It’s been a couple months now, and things have felt better for at least a couple weeks. Tony wonders if Steve and Bucky finally kissed and made up.
Tony’s not great at this relationship thing (Pepper can corroborate), but he’s also not an idiot. Ten days ago Rogers acted like Tony was the scum of the earth, and today was...well.
At that, Steve laughs. "Had to take the chance you gave me." He sits up and turns to face Tony. "Tony, I know it's a lot, but I hope you can trust me. I spent the last eleven years falling for you; I know that means you've got catch up to do, if you're even interested in taking that chance with me, but I hope you do."
"You didn't have to do that," Rogers protests, and Tony just shrugs. He wanted to; figures it's a way to thank Rogers for dragging him out like this.
Steve's quiet for a moment, and Tony thinks he crossed a line, but then Steve bursts out laughing. He rolls over, nearly onto Tony, and really, that smile could put the sun to shame.
“I’m sorry,” he finally gasps, still dazed; this must be why time travelers don’t talk to their past selves. They go insane.
He thinks it helps that Steve and Bucky don't really flirt (they do, but nothing excessive or anything that's ever made him uncomfortable), don't really touch on their shared past, and rarely does Tony feel like a third wheel. He’s never felt like one in a romantic sense, but there’s always that keen feeling of missing something when two old friends share an inside joke, which he'd never blame either of them for. It's impossible to have a history and not make other people feel left out of that loop once in awhile.
The thought of being with anyone else is unfathomable to Steve. But being with Tony
Steve’s still just staring at him. Bucky can’t even look at him. “Tony, I appreciate the invite,” Bucky goes on, clapping his shoulder again. “I’ll catch up with you Monday on the project. You guys have fun, and really, congrats. I’m happy for you both.”
"Great." Tony leads them out and into the car. He drives back to the rebranded Avengers Tower, glancing over at Rogers only once, because he can feel the eyes on him.
“Why are you here?” Steve asks curiously.
Steve isn't sure if this is one of those times where revealing the future messes things up. "I don't know a lot about time travel, Tony, what if I say something that changes the future?"
Tony hums in thought as he drives, remembering the conversation they’d had the night of the wedding, when everyone had finally gotten the hell out. Steve had been (understandably, Tony thinks) upset, but Tony hadn’t been sure if it was because Bucky had left, or because Bucky had been there in the first place.
“Because I can prove it,” Steve replies, confident now. “I can tell you the last thing you said before you went into the ice.”
Tony sighs. There’s a part of him that wishes they’d never crossed paths with Bucky; he can see that Steve’s hurting. But, he thinks, that hurt might’ve been there anyway, and Tony might never have known about it. Now he’s got a chance to maybe fix it.
“True,” Steve agrees. “The difference would just be that I don’t have to smack Tony when he does things like this.”
He feels ridiculous. It's been ten years since he and Steve broke up, but learning that Steve did it to make a point cut really deep. He knows he meant it when he said he was happy for them; he is. Steve deserves someone like Tony. Tony's a good guy, he deserves someone like Steve.
Preparing to travel to 1945 takes hardly any time. Steve finds some era appropriate clothing and packs a bag, ready to go back and find Peggy. Right as he's ready to depart, he hesitates.
"You didn't drink enough to be this incoherent," Steve points out, which...might be true. "Tony, are you trying to tell me you have feelings for Bucky?"
At that, Steve truly smiles. “Okay. Then we try it.” He pushes away some of the sadness as they fall into an only slightly forced conversation, deliberately avoiding the topic of Tony, and Steve’s marriage to him.
It’s an odd way to think about it, he realizes. But it’s something he hasn’t been able to shake free in his mind. Their relationship is easy, and they’re familiar around each other, and Tony’s
“No emergency, unless you count that travesty of a suit you wear,” Tony quips, and Steve can’t help but smile.
Tony hates not being able to fix things.
to support you!” Bucky hisses, eyes narrowed. “Steve, I was ready to take a third job to help put you through that fucking school. Maybe I wasn’t always around, or always the best boyfriend, but I was trying the best way I could to make sure you could keep going to school because your happiness was important to me.”
------
“Bucky,” he corrects with a laugh. “I’ll be sure to let every guest know I’m only there because I’m a Tony Stark fanboy.”
A few months ago Bucky had been promoted to the rank of Captain and retired from active duty. He’d offered his expertise in developing new planes, which his superiors had eagerly accepted, offering him a senior position in their engineering division.
"Felt like I had," Steve agrees.
think Steve is cheating on him, either. He knows if he talked to anyone else about this, they’d immediately assume Steve and Bucky were sleeping together, and Tony knows that it’s not an illogical assumption, but he just
------
"Breakfast first. I need more coffee."
"Glad I was able to get you out, and that you didn't hate every second."
Steve leads them, sitting down on the couch and motioning for Bucky to sit next to him. Bucky does, entirely unsurprised when Tony slides up behind him.
Steve sighs. He doesn't even know. "Just wanted to see how you're doing," he tries, knowing Bucky will see right through it.
"I- yeah, okay," he says, dragging himself out of bed. "Where?"
He debates skipping out on the reception, but he knows he can’t without offering an explanation and he thinks, “Your new husband is my ex that I’m apparently still carrying a torch for,” isn’t a great one. He doesn’t want to hurt Tony, and at a minimum, they’re still going to have to communicate on their projects.
He rises carefully from the bed, pressing a kiss to Tony's forehead before he does, and quietly walks to the bathroom. He wishes he had more memories of this place, wishes that he hadn't been such a coward in what feels like an entirely separate life. But the point is that he's here now, he supposes.
A sigh is Steve’s response, but Tony’s just grinning. “Do we even need to talk about this? He’s clearly on board.”
Tony smirks to himself as he leans in again, deliberately brushing against Rogers this time. The touch sends a spike of electricity through him, which is surprising, but not unwelcome. He rests a hand on Rogers's knee, feeling Rogers jolt under his hand, and this time he can't contain the smirk. Tony's never been one to shy away from new experiences, and certainly never been one to shy away from bed partners, but there's still something about this that's a lot different; Tony feels like if he lets himself go down this road, it'll be for good.
“But they didn’t hear you whisper to Peggy that you loved her.”
“Hey, Steve. Congrats, man.” He shoves his hands deep into his pockets for lack of anything better to do.
Then they turn to walk to the altar, and Bucky sees the face of the man that’s about to marry Tony.
It gets to the point that he decides he needs to at least talk to Steve about it. He waits until Bucky’s gone for the night (he spends most evenings at their penthouse now), and they’re nearly ready for bed.
Tony doesn't seem to suspect anything, which is good. Steve knows at some point he's going to have to come clean. He splashes some water on his face and goes back out to retrieve his clothes, and scribbles a note to Tony on the back of a spare piece of paper in his wallet.
“That’s really it?”
Steve’s past self stares at him, and he can see the fight coming.
“I bet you were a sight to behold after that,” Rogers says, still chuckling. “You know we don’t have to do anything about it, not if you don’t want. I can wait.”
“Awkward,” he hears Rogers mutter, which brings a smile to Tony’s face; the smile turning into a smirk when he sees Rogers waving his arms.
A soft chuckle is Bucky’s response. “Only if you’re paying, jerk. You’ve got a rich husband now.”
Steve’s quiet for a long time. “You’re worried I still have feelings for him,” he says, a statement rather than a question, but Tony feels like it’s a question. He shrugs, moving back to sit on the armrest of Steve’s chair and gently carding a hand through his hair.
“Oh it’s fine.” Bucky relaxes back into Tony’s embrace, figuring at this point he’s made up his mind. “As long as you two aren’t going to try to make me your sex slave, I’m on board.”
"It's my treat. Consider it thanks for this," Tony replies, and Rogers seems to brighten.
“I don’t know how you find that funny, but it’s good enough for me,” Steve says, a scowl on his face.
“Okay, step onto that platform,” he instructs, gesturing to it. Rogers complies again, and Tony punches instructions in the computer. It runs some scans, because Tony’s nothing if not thorough.
He receives a nod in reply. Steve steps back to allow him in, and really, he should’ve seen the blow to the head coming.
Steve Rogers would forever be the love of Bucky Barnes’s life. He thinks of Steve every now and then, the memories bittersweet. Sometimes it’s a small reminder that makes him smile; other times it‘s a knife in his gut, slicing the memories out and leaving him morose for days.
Bucky's just confused now. It sounds like Tony's saying that he and Steve want to date him, which doesn't make sense, because they're married. To each other.
“Tony,” Steve says, sliding close to him and sitting up to cup Tony’s cheek. “Tony, I love
He knows exactly where he’s going; even though it’s been nine years since he lived in this particular apartment, Brooklyn is indelibly ingrained into Steve’s memory.
Tony smiles a sad sort of smile. “Thanks. Let’s not torture you anymore with talking about him, though. Ready to see the new schematics I drew up?”
“Sounds great,” Rogers replies, and goddamn if he doesn’t sound sincere. “Thanks.”
Bucky knew, of course; after everything they’d been through, Steve knew he couldn’t leave and not tell Bucky. Sad, but understanding, Bucky had offered nothing but support.
"Okay, talk."
“It’s worked fine so far,” Steve counters, reminding himself that he has to stifle the familiarity right now.
Bucky snorts. “And here’s me wondering why the hell you walked out on me like that. You were trying to get me to call your bluff? Real mature, Rogers.”
"Oh my god," Steve sighs, flopping back on the bed. "You're ridiculous. You want to sleep with Bucky, so you're trying to get me to admit I want to so that you don't have to feel guilty."
“Not what I was going to ask.” Tony flops back onto the bed, waiting until Steve’s next to him. “You and Bucky. You’re not fucking, right?”
“Rogers, hi,” Tony says, a harsh reminder that Steve doesn’t have that familiarity with Tony yet.
At that, Tony’s expression softens, just a bit. “Sure. I guess you did, in a way. Of course your whole life is practically a sci-fi movie.”
"No, I'm good," Steve says, and Bucky can tell he's still got his eyes closed, silently berating himself for not having this conversation instead of Tony. "Just do me a favor and don't make any decisions until you get here?"
Okay then. Tony's silent as they drive, and Bucky can't stand the silence. Eventually he finally says, "What's going on?"
"I don't- I mean if you had permission, would you want to?" Tony asks, because now he needs to know and he's not sure why. They drank a lot tonight, maybe it's the alcohol.
“I can think of other ways to do that,” Rogers smirks at him.
“Do you
“It’s fine if you miss him, Steve,” he finally says. “Seems like he misses you too. You don’t want to try to reconnect?”
He isn’t sure what any of it means.
"Yes," Steve chuckles. "But we should talk about it in the morning when you can't pretend to be drunk."
he’d healed. He was now one of, if not the best, pilots in the United States Air Force. The army had enabled him to go to college, and he’d graduated with a masters in aerospace engineering.
Tony’s not sure what to do about it, or if he even
He barely registers Steve pushing him back against Tony, but he smiles against Steve’s lips when Tony’s arms wrap back around his waist. Steve pulls back after a long moment, and settles between Bucky’s legs, laying his head on Bucky’s chest.
“Nah, I’m good here.” Tony huffs out a contented sigh and settles into Steve’s embrace. “So did the conversation that I think happened last night actually happen?”
"Okay, how are you not mad at me for this?" he finally asks, turning so he can look at Steve.
Bucky shrugs. “I survived. You?”
"I already told you," Tony says, and Bucky wants to smack him.
It’s better if he doesn’t think about it. Tony’s waiting for him as he walks in, equipped as always with a glass of cognac. Bucky smiles as he accepts it, ignoring the wedding band visible on Tony’s hand, and pulls Tony into a brief hug.
“That’s it?” comes from his past self, and Steve can see the twitching fingers that warn him the punch is coming. He holds up his hands defensively.
Even so, familiarity only goes so far when the door to “your” apartment opens and you literally stare yourself in the face.
Bucky nods before remembering Tony can't see him. "Sounds good," he says. He hangs up, and starts getting dressed. When he walks out of the building, Tony's waiting for him in a flashy looking car. He gets in, and Tony just smiles at him, which is...weird. Something's definitely up.
Steve isn’t sure that’s the best idea; he’d worry that Bucky would think Steve was trying to cheat. “I don’t know,” he says after a moment. “It could come off as me telling him I want an affair.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Look, I know it’s been a century since you’ve gotten laid, but I’m just not that kind of girl.”
Their hands are still clasped; Tony wonders if Rogers ever has plans to let go. Rogers leads them to the elevator, instructing JARVIS not to let anyone into Tony’s penthouse, and there’s something odd about that but then he’s pressed up against the wall of the elevator again and most of his coherent thought is driven away.
“I think you just like trying to get me to drink too much,” Bucky laughs, aware he’s being flirtatious, but it’s slightly out of his control. “I appreciate the offer, Stark, but I’m sure you don’t want me there.”
He supposes that’s a thought for another day. For now, he’s exhausted and thinks a nap is a good idea.
"Nope, busy. You can hit on me later," Tony retorts, but he turns to Rogers and winks. "What's the matter, Cap, can't concentrate?"
When Rogers is gone, Tony takes a moment to contemplate what the fuck just happened.
"Tony, I can't help you if you don't talk to me," comes the exasperated reply, and why isn't Steve more upset about this? Tony thinks he should be, considering that Tony just said that he thinks Steve and his ex should sleep together, and that they should all be in a relationship. He thinks that's what he said, anyway.
“Not a problem. Getting married next weekend, I think it’s just pre-wedding jitters.”
“Then you owe me a drink, punk,” Steve replies, punching Bucky’s shoulder lightly.
"That's fine." Steve sighs, and they exchange numbers and set a place to meet the following afternoon. Steve just hopes this doesn't turn out to be a big mistake.
“Hey,” Rogers says as he steps into the lab. “That was fast.”
“This isn’t making me want to wait,” Tony growls.
As Bucky steps out of the car, none other than Stark himself is waiting for him, which is surprising; he’d always pegged Stark to be stuffy, or elitist. Stark’s in a dressed down suit, hair swept back perfectly, and a neatly trimmed goatee on his face. He looks like he’s at best six or seven years Bucky’s senior, which is also surprising; he’d always imagined Stark to look vaguely like an old hippie.
“How do I know you’re not some trick?” Steve (other Steve, not
Rogers sighs. "Fine. I realized I was too hard on you, and wanted to try to make that right. I owe you a lot for what you did that day when Loki attacked. We all do."
Before Tony even realizes it, an hour has passed; he's surprised to discover that he actually enjoyed himself. Rogers has this...genuineness to him that Tony's never really experienced before, in anyone really. He decides to take a leap of faith and continue the day, instead of retreating back to the tower like he'd originally planned on.
And yet, miraculously, Steve had been presented with a second chance. A chance to right those regrets, to live the life that he dreamed of - not the one he felt duty bound to live.
He leaves without another word, a smile on his face as he kicks the bike into gear and drives off.
Well, that’s that. Bucky pushes down the disappointment he feels; it’s not like Stark would’ve been interested in him anyway.
"Nothing's going on," Rogers protests, and Tony really wants to call bullshit on that, but he can wait a minute. He motions for Rogers to get out, and ushers him into the elevator. When they're back in the lab, he faces Rogers, arms crossed.
"Tell me something," Tony asks after a moment. "Assuming this is all true, when did you come back? What day?"
"A note saying I'm in here?" Steve asks, confused. Tony shakes his head, walking over and throwing the paper at him.
“Could’ve been worse,” Tony replies with a shrug. “Was sorry to see you leave, but I get it. Small world, though.”
"I think we should," Steve finally says, even though he's split on whether or not he actually thinks he can handle this. "If nothing else, I think we both need some closure. Just coffee, nothing fancy, no pressure. If you want."
“Yep. Went over some new jet designs; as long as they’re approved, and they will be because they’re mine, we’ll sign a contract next week.”
He isn’t sure he wants to ask; better to not risk the disappointment.
"Didn't fit with what I knew about you. I ignored it at the time because you were distracting."
“Earth to Capsicle,” penetrates the haze, and Steve looks up guiltily.
He feels
“That doesn’t change the fact that when I told you what I needed from you, your response was that you didn’t know how to be what I needed.” Steve’s heart
He sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, pushing his laptop away from him.
“Maybe?” he tries, sitting up to face Steve. “I’m just saying that if it did happen I don’t think I’d mind, because it’s you two, but I’d like to be kept in the loop?”
“Yeah, that’s definitely it,” Bucky replies, unwilling to get into a fight; ten years ago, he would’ve argued the point simply for the sake of arguing, but he’s too tired to do that now. And he knows that there’s some truth to what Steve said.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Steve asks without any accusation in his voice. He seems genuinely surprised; Bucky can see the emotions flitting across Steve’s face like they’re written there for Bucky to read. They always used to joke that Bucky was the one person Steve could never pull off lying to.
"Uh uh, you're a lousy liar, Cap. Spill it."
His mom used to say everything happens for a reason. Steve wonders what she’d say to this.
"Hey, Bucky. It's Steve."
"So these are the designs I've got prototypes for," Tony explains, pointing them out on the screens. "They're all similar to yours, you said the new fabric worked well?"
“Anyway, come by sometime for a drink,” Stark says as he closes up his laptop and sets it aside. “Got some new ideas for jets I didn’t show you I think you’d like to see, too.”
Tony’s called him to the Avengers Tower; Steve isn’t sure why, even after all these years he still doesn’t grasp Tony’s techno talk, but he’s not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Tony waits for the cheesy, "just like you," and is both relieved and disappointed when it doesn't come. He's far from perfect, but he feels like Rogers is the type to say it anyway.
This seems to give Steve pause. Steve can see the wheels turning in his counterpart’s head, can see the logic falling into place, but the suspicion doesn’t totally disappear.
“Think we can be friends, for his sake?” Steve asks, not sure if he knows his own answer to the question. He knows he misses Bucky, but there’s a part of him afraid to go down the road of friendship. He’s afraid he’ll end up wanting more.
And even as one minute became two, and three…
The smell hit him before he’d even gotten the vial to his lips… a sharp, rancid smell, like curdled milk. He tried to brace, and took a huge mouthful, thinking it might be easier to get it over and done with as quickly as possible –
Tony slapped the work desk in frustration, hard enough to make his palm sting. God, it was like having a bad High School Forensics team in his head, squabbling over philosophical concepts that had no place in the real world-
And Steve couldn’t tell whether it was just a culture shock - if he’d simply grown used to a society that aggressively marketed youth to young adults and glamorized a person's twenties as a time of self discovery…
He sighed and fell into the chair behind him, simply letting the page he was holding slip out of his grip and onto the floor.
seen behind the curtain of existence - that, however inhuman and overwhelming his knowledge was, there was still so much left for him to be humbled and confused by.
“Lie back, sweetheart,” Tony purred, as he guided Steve back against the sheets.
He stopped, his lips still pressed firm to Steve’s skin as he swallowed that final mouthful, and then gently began to seal the wound.
“Thank you,” he said, gesturing to the bloodstained T-shirt on the floor beside him. Bucky just frowned and shook his head.
“What else it means,” Tony whispered, dazed.
“I, uh, I don’t… not in so many…words, I don’t think…” Steve stammered awkwardly, a hot blush running up his neck-
He hated the thought of Steve putting so much of himself into a plan that couldn’t work.
His shoulders tensed, and he reflexively tapped his watch to make sure that he could arm it quickly - but he wasn’t especially perturbed. In fact, this was probably as calm as Tony could be outside of an Avengers facility. He had been staying in this hotel for over twenty years. He trusted his security checks. There was nothing especially controversial about this particular conference, or any of the people speaking at it-
Tony shoots Dr Stape, and it's made clear that the shot basically destroys the body - again, the actual anatomics are not described in detail, but there are a few general references to the damage done.
And if any of
Now that he was allowed to, Steve could so clearly remember turning to share a glance with Tony in this same training camp, on this unseasonably warm April day in the already distant past… He remembered the little rivet of excitement, because that connection felt familiar and hopeful and just for the two of them. Steve remembered
“Well, that’s no small thing,” Steve laughed, joylessly.
And then the elevator doors slid open.
The awkwardness curled in Bucky’s stomach, the blush glowing hotter as he recognised what Tony meant…
He saw Tony’s features fall, a look of baffled shock welling up in his eyes – and Steve very nearly asked him what was wrong. For one whole second, Steve really had no comprehension of what he’d just said.
“Happy New Year,” Tony smiled back…
He saw Bucky wince. Steve could practically hear him thinking,
to be a fucking Avenger – I just want the reputation I worked for – that I
The fact was, everything was already ruined. The only mature thing he could do now was accept it, and try to help people anyway.
What it really meant was that there were times when Steve was so fucking horny that he couldn’t think straight. Times when every muscle in his body tensed with a desperate need for release, times when it was all he could do to keep himself from openly panting. Sometimes it was triggered by the most minor or mundane of things – sometimes, as far as Steve could tell, it wasn’t triggered by anything at all. He had literally no idea why he felt like this today. He’d just woken up with an uneasy awareness of his own body, and a weary understanding of exactly where it was going. It had quickly heated into a compulsive, irritated feeling, like an itch he couldn’t find. Then a low ache, and a painful erection that hadn’t relented even slightly in the last few hours – and Jesus Christ, Steve wished he hadn’t worn the Captain America uniform to this stupid meeting.

Occasionally glancing at the carry case on the seat beside him. Like he was expecting it to move, or something.

And the smartest thing I could imagine anyone doing was sabotaging that weapon. And
And then Tony went back to moving his way down Steve’s body, this time pressing hot, deep kisses along his jaw, and neck, and chest… Grinning against Steve’s skin,
later, I finally let Sam talk me into playing Call of Duty,” Bucky smiled, like he knew full well that it was a perfunctory offer. “But just so you know, if you’re not there by ten, I’m switching to the strip-version of the game.”
That he hadn’t even known who Steve
And he’d finally stopped trying to work out how he felt about Steve, and acknowledged that he already knew.
He’d spent the day in a state of giddy
awareness of Tony-
“Yeah, also,
. That, after all this time of counting down the days and hours and minutes, he was home.
“Sorry, say again?” He asked, leaning back so that he could look Tony in the eye.
Okay. Deep breath. Lay everything out and put it all into boxes. Start from the top.
Calculating quickly, he realised that he had to do something to get Stape to come close to him… but, ideally, something that wouldn’t put him on the defensive…
“So, you’re using these people as lab rats?” Tony spat, his hands gripping the railing so tight that his knuckles were white.

kind of know he was doing it, when he answered that one.
And then that wave of pleasure finally broke, slamming through that wall of tension and shattering it. Tony dug his nails so deep into Steve’s shoulders that he might have drawn blood, his throat stripped raw by the cry he let out as he came in Steve’s mouth. The initial rush of sheer relief stretched out around him, dragging the pressure up from the very core of him as Steve continued to swallow, eagerly.
“Oh no you don’t,” she told him straight. “You’re not getting rid of me unless you tell me what’s going on.”
It took him a few silent, stammered attempts to even manage,

And then felt his chest begin to tighten again, as he realised how silly and over the top his reaction had been…
to you?”
And, over the top of it all, the noisy fuzz of total confusion.
“Hm?” Steve frowned – and then realised that he’d written these notes on the back of a Talleroy Communications Flyer. A little smile escaped him, simply because he liked that Tony had remembered it. “Oh, yeah, they came back. I think they might even be coming back again…”
He was maybe an inch short-
As it turned out, anxiety and doubt and fears for the future were all just inventions of the reality he’d left behind. Time itself seemed to no longer apply. Steve had no idea how long it had been since Tony drifted into sleep, right there in his arms. How long Steve had been lying here, staring at that beautiful face, tracing gentle touches over Tony’s back. How many times he’d buried his head into Tony’s hair, and just breathed him in.
…Wait.
Unfortunately, they didn’t have a better one.
“I’m-I’m not, I don’t, I don’t care about them-”
He didn’t know
Okay. He’d gotten a little distracted there. But he managed to drag his thoughts back into focus, even over the top of this sudden surge of affection – maybe because of it. Because loving Steve as much as he did was the whole reason he wanted to do this…
Thinking about it happening on Anni Vara
“I know,” Steve nodded. “But the truth is… I realised a long time ago that my life might not look exactly like a Hallmark Holiday Special – and I mean before the serum, even. I was never someone who could take a certain life for granted, or had my heart set of one type of future… I mean, I knew I wanted to serve my country, and I knew I wanted to fall in love – but I never cared much how I got there, or what it looked like,” a faint blush ran up Steve’s neck as he remembered himself in a poorly fitted wool uniform, selling war bonds to the tune of
“If there is, I’ll add it to the list,” Tony replied, standing up from the couch.
no words for, even if he was in any state to think of them.
“I want you,” Steve breathed, just because he was thinking it. And Tony’s eyes lit up, in a way that excited every nerve in Steve’s body-

. Like everything was eased and soothed and secured, when he could feel Tony inside him like this.

A different sort of dizziness rolled over Steve as the relief of it washed up along his back. His limbs fell into a pleasant heaviness, tingling at the joints…

As it turned out, having dutifully suffered through every line in the file, Steve had basically the same message for Tony as he had three weeks ago-

And then, obviously, Tony felt terrible for saying anything so cold and unkind.

“None of that is why I was mad,” Tony told him, softly.
When he looked up, the assistant was still looking at him expectantly, subtly nodding towards the outfit in a silent encouragement to put it on. Tony sighed, and went to pull the robes over his head-
Tony, who hadn’t made Steve feel any less of a hero when he’d had him pinned naked to a bed…
That he must always have liked something about this moment…
It was just as big a fear that gripped Tony now – and it was going to be the same answer. The same little voice that whispered,
And he hated himself, for blaming Steve for it.
He didn’t mean to. He didn’t even know he was doing it. It just felt so natural, all of a sudden - instinctive. He
Not now.
And he had no idea whether anyone

“What do you want?” Nick asked again, more guarded now - like his defences were beginning to click into place. Steve grinned at him.

“What?” Steve whispered – well,
“The Master of Ceremonies himself,” The officer replied with professional detachment. “He’s here to collect you.”

, he could see this answer.
And no reason to judge him either way.
And then Tony stroked his palm up along Steve’s neck, slow and steady and sure, eventually coming to cradle the side of his face. Steve sighed, and let his head rest against Tony’s hand, and ran through all of those promises again in his head. Still trying to process how wonderful that was, still in the middle of realising how much it meant, that he really believed that-
father?
Steve let go of the breath he’d been holding, and everything rushed out after it. His whole body weakened, his legs turning to water beneath him - it was more luck than judgement that he managed to fall into the couch. For a few moments, there was only his own heartbeat. And then those few dazed thoughts, repeating over and over-
He had to keep reminding himself that
When Steve met Tony’s eye again he found an expression of such naked sincerity - something that demanded attention.
“Maribelle. Louise. Wang. Dr Simonetti. There are a few others, but I don’t know their names.”
“Official consulting hours are between five and eight,” he muttered, taking the file from her without so much as a glance. Talking purely for his own amusement, now.
And then he remembers…
“I have no idea,” Tony replied, natural and friendly and interested. “I mean, I know he was
And he hated himself for essentially giving Steve the silent treatment. He knew he was doing it, and he knew it was the worst of all the options. None of the catharsis of actually having this thing out, none of the superior serenity of letting it go. No chance of claiming the high ground, yet again.
And then those few pages. That relatively short account by a man who clearly wasn’t a vampire hunter – who clearly used the word to mean vampire historian instead.
Tony’s spine jolted with something much like panic, stars exploding behind his eyes as he screamed into the pillows, not yet able to process this new level of urgency-
“I’m Zan. I think we’ve almost met before.”
“I meant it when I said I was sorry, I
He strolled out of the room, looking exactly as casual as someone trying to look casual. He saw Steve take a steadying little breath, the same as he might’ve walking into a battle, and Tony still wasn’t sure whether he sympathised with Steve’s situation or resented being treated like a challenge to be overcome…
think it wasn’t my business to teach him that… But he literally locked you in your room, and baited you with a final message from your dead father, because he thought you needed to learn a lesson. So, what’s he going to say?”

didn’t have time for that one.
Tony still couldn’t quite push his mind past,
And Steve opened his mouth, and took a choked gulp of air, tears sliding from the corners of his eyes.
And all of that was quite uncomfortable enough, even before Steve slipped into that soft, sincere tone to add,
And, at the same time, the now familiar flush of heat, that compulsive, craving feeling - that odd sense of pride…
“Well, this is all very generous,” Steve murmured playfully, as he took them.
Those memories weren’t just words in Tony’s head. Those images had a sound, and a taste… they

Not because he was worried it would send the wrong message.
“On the floor. On your knees.”
“Not wanting to worry that I’m safe isn’t actually selfish,” Steve smiled, knowingly.
“But you have time,” Steve assured him, fluidly following on from Tony’s point - as he so often did. “And you’ll have the both of us here to help in any way that we can. And you’ll be safe here, always.”
“Er… Oh, if I think very hard about it, I do…” Tony groaned petulantly, squinting back at the computer panel.

- enough that he forced himself to stop and think about it…
Instead he let his focus sharpen into a sort of tunnel vision, until all he could see was his target, and all he was thinking about was getting rid of that damn stone…
so much more of the world, now that he was with Steve. There were so many little joys in life that he’d simply not seen, back when he was so unhappy. So many privileges that he’d taken for granted, until he thought of sharing them with Steve…
For a moment, there was nothing more than the feeling of Steve’s chest pressed against his, and the smell of Steve’s skin, and the overwhelming joy of knowing that he was here, and safe, and
He wished Steve wouldn’t fight this.
I’m thinking about this differently, now…”
In fact, Steve made it to his usual parking spot in just under seven minutes – which was soon as he could possibly have been there, without endangering other drivers on the road.
“And you really want to do that, do you? Try to fight your way out of here? Take on an unknown number of highly skilled agents - to go where?” Nick demanded - sounding just a little bit nervous now, Steve was delighted to note.
But, in any case, I really hope you enjoy the update!

did – he felt powerful, and important, and
And, perhaps most important of all, there wasn’t the remotest question this overwhelming Tony’s self-control. However much he wanted Steve’s blood, the idea of forcing himself onto Steve was as repugnant as it had ever been.
“Oh, no, nothing like that” Tony reassured her. “I guess it’s just… you know, new…”
Finding out that the last of those ‘true vampires’ died out a long time ago might’ve been disappointing or confusing, at one point… But now it just felt like being able to trace his roots back to Ancient Rome. It didn’t really mean anything to him, that it no longer existed.
had been the most horrific part of the worst experience of Tony’s life, the part he could never bring himself to revisit, not even that night with Steve. The terrifying, disgusting moment when Obie had grabbed him by the back of his hair, and forced his wrist into Tony’s mouth, and barked at him,

By the time Steve turned the water off, Tony felt giddy. Weak. Heavy and weightless, all at once.
And Steve just gave into it.
Apparently Steve liked to have his hair pulled – and Tony liked the noise Steve made, when he did.
And Tony just knew this was one of those things that would be sad, if he really thought about it. Like any of the little things he found to smile about; the positive news stories and the progress of the Avengers and the things that went right for Rhodey and Pepper… Things that could only make him happy if he didn’t stop to analyse them. If he didn’t let himself get as far as thinking that he’d never have it for himself, that he couldn’t really be a part of anything, that no one would ever know what made him smile.
“Even though I know
It felt strange to be sitting on the examination table again.
And then Tony’s hand was on the back of his head, cradling him close, whispering to him, over and over,
He couldn’t help thinking of how he would’ve reacted to that, the first time he met Tony. How personally he’d taken everything, how tense he’d been in Tony’s company - how quick he’d been to take everything at face value, including the misguided opinions of other people.

At least Steve had tried to reach out. He’d written a letter, and sent a phone… and Tony had never once thought about calling it. He’d never even thought about sending a text – not even about the things he
This would be one of the images that flashed before his eyes when he died.
“It always sounded kind of fake to me. I mean, it’s not that I don’t trust Nick – I know he’s on my side, and no one’s ever going to be able to buy him, or blackmail him or whatever. It’s just that I don’t always trust what he’s telling me? He does this thing, where he only tells you what he thinks it’s best for you to know…” And then Steve shook his head sharply, like he was telling himself off, and seemed to focus. “But my point is, I feel like I can’t take the risk. And, I dunno, that seemed like kind of a shame at the time… But I just keep thinking about it, now.”
“Yeah, I… know…” Tony answered automatically, his mind already racing ahead to the obvious follow up question-
people are only interested in what they’re worth.”
that?” And he looked at Tony, expectantly.
“So, why are you saying sorry?” Tony asked, meeting his eye again.
The Operation Rebirth folder was closed by then, glaring up at him like a spiteful reminder of what was coming - somehow gloating and indifferent, all at once. Like a prison guard, waiting to lead him to the gallows.
And Tony really didn’t
This was the conversational equivalent of dangling your keys in front of a toddler while you tried to deal with a grown-up task.

“They have parties for specially selected people on the third floor. They say its an exclusive experience, and I suppose to them, it is. None of them complain. But they’re only there so the Adams can have them take these things and do these things under test conditions.”

Tony hoped he didn’t look as unnerved by that as he felt.
“Everyone is” Janine assured them. “But please, don’t worry. I’ll start by saying that these experiences are quite carefully controlled – and that’s so that you can get the most out of this, and have an authentic experience of New Eden, but, most importantly, so that everything is safe. And we have made sure that – so long as you follow the basic rules, and stay within the general parameters, there is literally nothing that can go wrong.”
Tony wrapped the sheets snug around him, before he sat beside him and encouraged Steve to rest his head in Tony’s lap. Steve just let himself fall, like he was sinking though himself. And then Tony ran a gentle hand through Steve’s hair, and whispered,
The rain clouds had slowly darkened over the course of the day. By the time Steve made it back to his room the horizon had started to flicker with the first warnings of the approaching thunderstorm-

Steve pushed into him again, hard and sharp, the second shock running up Tony’s spine while he was still reeling from the first-

All of his senses momentarily confused, Tony surrendered to the sheer immovability of him, throwing his arms around Steve’s neck and wrapping his legs tight around his waist. A thick wave of friction curled through his hips, mixing in with all the emotional upheaval and the physical shock and the sudden shift in his perceptions-
“And… more than that, I don’t know if you really

Steve) asks, suspicion lacing his tone, and okay, that’s fair.
“Why would I want to?” Steve asks, incredulous. “Tony, you’re my husband. I don’t need, or want, to sleep with anyone but you.”
He picks up the phone, and then hangs it up immediately. This is the worst idea anyone's ever had. He pulls his tablet over and starts sketching out designs for a new project, determinedly ignoring the part of him that's desperate to make that call.
But that was Tony, he’d realized. Bucky‘s never met someone so generous.
"No."
Steve lands exactly when, and where, he intended; exactly one week after the Battle of New York, in Brooklyn. He’s dressed to blend in as much as possible, but even so he pulls the baseball cap down over his brow to shield his eyes from passerby.
Tony immediately melts into it; the sensation’s like nothing he’s ever felt before, with anyone. Rogers is insistent, pressing Tony back against the wall of the elevator, hands still clasped, driving a surprised and definitely not desperate gasp from him.
“I’m from the future,” Steve says after a moment, hearing how ridiculous it sounds, but it’s true, so he keeps going. “I’m you. I’m from your future.”
But Steve has all of time and space at his fingertips. The solution hits him; it’s so easy. Why can’t he fix that? Give Peggy the life they both wanted?
“I don’t burn it,” Steve quips. “And I’m not going to be mad at you for it.”
Or maybe it's that Rogers isn't the worst person to look at from across a table. Or the fact that he seems to actually care about Tony.
“Hey,” he says, and now that Bucky’s in front of him, Steve can’t fathom why he thought this was anywhere close to a good idea. Bucky looks amazing, and Steve’s heart aches.
“So we talk to him about it.”
“Yeah, this was a bad idea,” Bucky sighs, taking a long drink from his coffee. “You’re not here because you want to be. Tell Tony that once our contract’s signed he can lose my number, I won’t bother you guys again.” He sets the cup down and moves to stand; Steve reaches out to grip his arm instinctively.
“Not if you say the words, ‘Tony and I would like to date you,’” Tony replies, and Steve can see the barely restrained urge to roll his eyes. It’s a fair point, but he thinks it’d come off better if it came from Tony.
Bucky isn’t sure what the hell he did to deserve this, but fuck the universe. Fuck him for thinking this was a good idea.
Bucky shakes his head, but he waits until they're seated at the cafe before he brings it up again. He takes a long sip of coffee. "Okay, talk. What the fuck is going on?"
“Why?” Bucky isn’t sure he wants the answer. “For Tony, right? Steve, you don’t have to tolerate me just because Tony wanted me there. Trust me, if he’d told me your name, I would’ve stayed home.”
“You move in, and we all live happily ever after?” Tony suggests, which makes Steve chuckle. Bucky shrugs; the idea’s appealing.
“Stark,” he replies evenly. “What’s the emergency?”
The “little place” turns out to be a private club, and Bucky isn’t usually one for this kind of scene, but they end up having a good time anyway. It’s quiet enough for more talking, and by the end of the night Bucky’s starting to contemplate risking that disappointment.
Tony's silent for another long moment. "It's not gonna be easy," he admits. "But yeah. I think so."
It’s the most difficult hour of Bucky’s life. He knows he can’t leave, even though he wishes he could; Tony couldn’t have known that his now husband (the thought makes Bucky’s stomach twist) and his new friend have the past they have.
Apparently it got through, though, because Steve is untying him.
“It’s great,” Bucky replies, clapping Tony on the shoulder. “Does this mean I’m on my own with our project while you two honeymoon?”
"What the fuck is this?" Tony demands, waving Steve's note at him.
Steve takes a long moment before he replies; this wasn't how he wanted to do this at all. He doubts that Tony will believe him at this point, but he knows he owes it to Tony to come clean.
Tony nods, that playful smile on his face. "Don't make me second guess it," he warns, and Steve laughs again.
“Well I’m glad to see you,” Steve replies, arms twining around Tony’s waist comfortably. “Good meeting, then?”
Rogers shakes his head. "It's perfect, Tony. Couldn't ask for better."
“So it’s all about ego,” Bucky teases, and Stark (Tony) just laughs.
"Too bad, I need you to." Tony squeezes Rogers's hand back, a shiver running through him when a thumb starts rubbing the back of his hand. "Anything at all you'd make different about the suit? More flexibility, less, lighter fabric, anything?"
“Eyes up here, solider,” Stark quips, and Bucky just laughs, cheeks pink.
A moment of silence, and a long, exasperated sigh comes from the other end. "How much has he flirted with you?" Steve asks.
When he awakes, he’s bound to a chair, and goddamn him for being so strong, because he’s tied himself so tight he can’t escape. Not while he’s dazed, anyway.
Disappointed but knowing better than to push, Steve rises as well. “Thanks,” he says before heading out, and Tony nods.
"Since when do we have dates?" Bucky asks, and Tony just grins.
"If I say I don't know, is that bad?" he asks in return, and Steve just rolls his eyes.
"I don't know," Steve sighs.
“Likewise,” Stark says with a smile, which doesn’t make sense, but Bucky brushes it off. He’s sure his superiors mentioned his background before coming here. “Shall we?”
A nod, and Steve complies, the amount of information on the screens overwhelming even after almost fifteen years out of the ice.
"Entirely unhelpful. But I'm sure I'll find something to fix at some point," Tony replies, wondering who's going to acknowledge the hand thing first.
"Tony said we should talk," is all Steve can manage, the sound of Bucky's voice seeping to the back of his memory and dragging feelings he'd long thought gone back with it. "He said you guys really hit it off, thinks we should reconnect.
“We were,” Bucky agrees, voice sad. “Who knows where we’d have ended up if you hadn’t walked out. Or if I’d stopped you.”
“Just you and me, against the world,” Bucky agrees with a sad smile, reaching out to grip Steve’s forearm. “I really am happy for you, Stevie. You deserve to be happy, and I know Tony makes you.”
“We’ll see,” Bucky chuckles, but Tony proves to be as good as his word. He slides an arm around Bucky’s waist as they walk out, which is...nice. Unexpected (maybe it shouldn’t have been), but nice. Tony is a solid presence next to him, fingers looped securely into his belt loops, and Bucky thinks he could probably get used to this.
Maybe this will give Steve some closure, then. It probably can't make anything worse.
“You are the king of vague answers today.”
Bucky rattles off his personal number without any hesitation, and that’s slightly surprising; normally he’s less free with giving away personal information, but there’s something disarming about Stark, who punches it into the phone.
"Promise."
"So you just..." Tony still seems skeptical. "Decided to come back here."
“All right, fine, you win.” Bucky says, feeling like he might regret this, but he can be a good new friend and suck it up. “I’ll be there, just tell me when and where.”
talk to him about it.”
Another wince. When Steve puts it like that, it does kind of hit the ear wrong.
is how I imagined the days after our wedding,” Tony grins. Steve grins back. They’ll be okay, Tony thinks.
Steve spends most of the next morning thinking about his impending coffee...not-date with Bucky. Aside from the few moments at the wedding, he hasn't seen Bucky in years. The thought is paralyzing, and Steve really hasn't given himself permission to think about why.
"You know at some point, you are spilling all the details. I want to know all the major scientific breakthroughs I have, okay?"
“I just kissed you and you still can’t call me Steve, huh?”
Bucky’s grateful. He’s deliberately avoided thinking about it, but if he slips, and remembers Steve’s face, he likes to think there was some sadness in Steve’s eyes when he left that night.
"Rude," Tony murmurs, but Steve is probably right. Steve's always right.
"No," Tony protests, but maybe he is. "Maybe? He's a nice guy."
“I said you were right. I’m not here to argue with you, Steve. I told you, I’m happy for you, you’re obviously happy, and I don’t want to ruin your night.”
Steve chuckles. “I guess you’re right,” he agrees, because really, it’s true. Tony looks surprised at the laugh, and points at a chair near one of the desks.
“Yeah, that’s the thing,” Tony says, words still falling from his lips without his consent. “I can’t explain it, but I’m not jealous of it. I don’t even think I could be if I wanted.”
So now, he has to choose - Peggy, or Tony. He can’t fix both regrets.
Grateful for the change of topic, Bucky throws himself into the conversation, time passing quickly now like it always does.
The second was not telling Tony Stark he was in love with him.
“Because you’re married, and I never fucking stopped loving you,” Bucky says bluntly. Steve feels like he’s been punched in the gut. “I’m not saying I’d ever try to do anything to mess up your relationship with Tony, please don’t take it that way. But I think it’d be hard for me.”
Steve (god this is confusing) stares at him, suspicion clouding his face.
"When were we friends?" Tony asks bluntly. "Last thing I remember was you telling me the only thing special about me was my suit."
“Ten seconds. Talk.”
There's silence for long enough that Steve worries Bucky hung up on him.
“I suppose so.” Bucky looks him over, feeling a little inadequate at how well put together Stark always seems to look.
“It’s like I can read your mind,” Tony remarks, chin resting on his hand as he gazes at Bucky. “Liking this idea, huh?”
Rogers nods, and despite himself, Tony finds himself opening up. Rogers is warm and kind, asking genuine questions about Tony and his projects, Iron Man, and even though Tony still feels like he missed a big part of their history together, it's kind of nice. Steve offers stories about his life in the thirties and forties, which sometimes involve a mention of Howard Stark, but Tony finds he doesn't even mind; it's interesting to see a perspective of his dad that isn't clouded by him being an asshole.
"Yep."
"And it explains why you didn't treat JARVIS like some disembodied poltergeist," Tony adds, which makes Steve chuckle; he did feel that way at first, all those years ago.
And he absolutely does
As he turns to leave, he hears a soft apology from Tony to Steve. He quickens his pace, making it out to the parking lot when a hand falls on his shoulder to stop him.
Maybe he’s projecting his own attraction onto Steve.
“I know,” Steve sighs. “I’m sorry, okay? It’s just. A lot harder to see you than I thought.”
Tony’s eyes open, eyes narrowing at Rogers. “You think I’m that easy?” He squeezes Rogers’s hand for emphasis. Rogers laughs again.
One was missing his dance with Peggy.
And Tony thinks that it'd be good for Steve to have Bucky back in his life, which doesn't make any sense. It's not like Bucky wants that; if he did, he'd have come to Steve. Steve also thinks it makes no sense for Tony to want his husband to reconnect with said husband's ex boyfriend, but Tony's sometimes inexplicable.
"Make sure he knows that if he hurts you, I'll kill him," Bucky says, still smiling. "I'm glad we did this. I think I needed it."
Returning the stones took weeks; not as difficult as obtaining them, but difficult nonetheless. The soul stone was a surprise; of all the people Steve had expected to meet, the Red Skull wasn’t anywhere even close to on the list.
Steve just shakes his head, expression mirroring Bucky’s. “We both made mistakes. I miss you, Buck. Can we try this?”
With a smile on his face, he recalibrates the time travel bracelet Tony made, and disappears into the quantum realm.
Well, Tony’s never one to shy away from a project. He gets down to business, the work easy and familiar.
"He's threatening me, isn't he?" Bucky guesses, but when Steve looks up, he's smiling. "You look really happy, Stevie. I'm really happy for you. I mean it."
“No, no,” Steve says quickly, sensing this as an opening to try to connect with Tony. “Just all gets a little overwhelming, sometimes. All this new technology, it’s like I got dropped into a science-fiction movie.”
Rogers looks shocked, but he stifles it quickly. "Yeah, sure."
“I’ve got something I need to make right. If you go back, I can make that right too.” He doesn't tell Steve what that something is; he doesn't want to do anything that'd change Steve's mind.
“Tony invited me,” Bucky replies. God Steve looks amazing, Bucky’s heart aches right now. “If it’s too weird, I’ll go.”
"I could. Let's see how lunch goes."
Of course Bucky picks up immediately. "Hello?"
“Just answer him. He probably wants to make sure I haven’t made you cry yet.”
“No,” Steve says softly, taking a sip from the cup. “How’ve you been?”
“Captain Barnes,” Stark says in greeting, a smile on his face as he extends a hand for Bucky to shake.
“I’m an excellent date, thank you.”
“Maybe,” Bucky agrees. “Depends on how this 'date' goes.”
Steve looks like he’s holding back a lot of emotion. Bucky can’t (doesn’t want to) read it. “Thanks,” he says, just as soft. “It would be nice if you stayed.”
"Now what?" Rogers asks, and Tony knows he's not really asking about the suits. He shrugs, sitting back slightly but keeping their hands clasped.
He hopes the answer to both is yes.
"So you want a relationship with him." It's a statement, but Tony knows it's a question.
"Simple isn't the word I'd use," Bucky replies, still not sure if this is some kind of test. "You're saying Steve's on board with this...whatever this is?"
Rogers looks surprised; did he really think Tony wasn't going to notice? "Can't stop by to take a friend to lunch?" he asks, clearly trying to sound innocent.
And of course, in typical Steve Rogers fashion, he’d brushed it off. Said he was fine, that it’d been a decade since he’d seen Bucky and it didn’t bother him.
“This way’s more fun.”
about Bucky, he was able to move on. When he met Tony, it was everything he’d ever wanted out of another person, and Steve loves him, so much. Tony’s generous and kind, he’s supportive, caring, and selfless. Steve knows how lucky he is to have found someone like Tony.
“It’s okay,” Steve replies, more serious now. “I would’ve done the same thing.”
“Well.” Tony claps his hands and stands up. “That’s all I need then, Cap, you can head to wherever they’re playing bingo.”
It's fine. He'll figure it out. For now, he's just...going to go along for the ride and see what happens.
He's not sure why it's so important to him to figure out what Rogers is hiding. Maybe it's because he doesn't like not knowing things, maybe it's because he's finding Rogers increasingly attractive and boy if that isn't something he never thought he'd say.
“It did,” Steve agrees, pressing a kiss to Tonys forehead. “Breakfast and then we can keep talking about it?”
“So you’re not seeing him again, is what you’re saying?”
He hadn’t wanted to leave; it was a bluff he’d hoped Bucky would call. When he didn’t, Steve knew that was his answer.
“So.” Tony’s grinning. “What d’you think?”
“You know I never stopped loving you either, you punk.” The admission actually helps. Steve feels like they’re on the same page with how they feel, which might make it easier to work through it.
“I can drive myself places,” Bucky chuckles as he climbs in. Stark just grins and hands him the glass.
pretend
“Okay,
"Hey, Steve. What's up?"
It’s how they met; Tony had contracted the firm to help design it, and after looking through some portfolios, had chosen Steve based on his work. The rest, as they say, was history.
"Sure, I bet you can. You know, I knew there was something off about all this, but I ignored it because you were so convincing." Tony's advancing on him now, a finger pointed in his direction. "I knew there was something weird about the way you looked at me, the fact that you were always here, the fact that you didn't hesitate with JARVIS when the last time you were here you acted like he was a ghost, and you owe me a fucking explanation, Rogers. Who the fuck are you?"
“Guess I am.” Rogers rises and pulls Tony up with him, not releasing his grip. “Still don’t know what to do about that?”
"Still lying," Tony says, irritated now. "What's the big deal about telling me the truth?"
“So!” Tony claps his hands. “New suit’s over there, do me a favor and go try it on. I have tests we need to run.”
“We don’t have to,” Rogers says, voice a hum, and goddamnit that does unfair things to Tony’s resolve.
. Steve’s arms uncross and his eyes widen, and Steve knows he’s gotten through.
A low whistle leaves Rogers as he takes in the gym. “This is impressive.”
He knows Steve’s getting off work early today, so hopefully he’ll be home when Tony gets there. The thought brings a smile to his face; Steve was promoted recently at his architectural firm, thanks, in part, to the work he’s done on Stark Tower.
"Next try," Tony fires back, and Steve holds up a hand.
way, but he could’ve just as easily been looking through rose colored glasses.
"Why do you think I need to sleep with Bucky?" Steve asks after a moment of silence.
“I am happy for you, Stevie,” he says softly as he pulls back. “Really. That’s all I ever wanted for you.”
Bucky knows that was deliberate, and goddamn if it doesn’t hurt. He knows he’s hurting Steve, but he also knows that if he stays, it’ll get worse. He huffs out a breath and steels himself before pulling Steve into a hug.
"I'll come by and get you," Tony says, which is typical. "Be ready in twenty."
“Perfect.”
Bucky’s proud of where he’s at. If he gives himself permission to think about it, he likes to think Steve would be proud of him too; Steve always told him he was destined for great things.
Rogers hums out a dissent. “You know that’s not what I’m talking about.”
A chuckle that sounds fond of Tony is Rogers’s response. “Sounds great. You coming with me?”
“I just mean if you are, I’d like to know,” he says, not missing Steve’s eyebrows shooting into his hairline even in profile. “I don’t think you are, really, but sometimes things happen and I’d rather know so I just figured if it had happened, we could talk about it. But I don’t think you are."
"Then why did you call me?" Bucky asks, sounding exhausted. "Steve, I know you're not really interested in reconnecting, don't force yourself to do it because Tony thinks we should. You're not hurting my feelings."
Bucky nods. “I think I’d be stupid to turn this down, honestly. What- I mean, how do you envision this?”
"I told you, you get to date him too," Tony replies with a grin. "It's simple."
"Look, what I'm going to say is going to sound crazy, but just...hear me out," he starts, and Tony snorts again. "I'm from the future."
Two hours are all Steve manages to last before caving. He's doing this because Tony thinks he should, he tells himself as he picks up the phone and dials. Not because he wants to.
“Hate it,” Tony groans, but he knows they both know he’s lying. It seems like principle now not to give in, but he wants to; and when has he ever denied himself something he wants? “Fuck it, I’m lying, you win.”
Fuck Tony for inviting him.
“The idea does have potential,” Tony says, smirk evident in his voice.
. He’s pissed at everyone - himself for not being past this, Bucky for not stopping him from walking out, and Tony for thinking this was a good idea.
"I know," Steve admits. "But it's the truth."
Steve looks torn; fortunately, Steve planned for this. He’s talking to himself, after all.
Tony nods. "Yep. You can call him to ask me if you don't believe me, which you clearly don't."
. Steve wrote the note on a photo, not a piece of paper. He flips the photo over, seeing his own smiling face grinning back at him, taunting him, with an arm around Tony. It'd been taken at the party they'd thrown right before Ultron first attacked.
Bucky takes the phone off speaker and brings it up to his ear. "Hey, Steve. Is this really the conversation I think I'm having, or is Tony trying to figure out if you'd cheat on him with me?"
“Once the contract’s signed there won't be any more meetings,” Tony offers after a minute, and Steve lets out a breath.
"I don't want to say yes if that means you're going to do something you don't want to do," Bucky replies. Steve can picture his face right now, and it sort of kills him.
“You’re a menace,” Tony groans. Rogers chuckles, more insistent now, like he thinks Tony will disappear if he stops.
That doesn’t fit with what Tony knows about Steve, but then again, Steve was a lot younger back then.
“Yeah, never been a fan of letting stuff wait,” Tony says, deliberately offhand. Rogers just nods, seeming to wait for a cue. Tony can’t put his finger on why Rogers is different, but if he didn’t know better he’d swear this isn’t the same man he fought aliens with two weeks ago.
Maybe an email would be better. But Bucky had always hated impersonal communication, which made it that much more frustrating when he shut Steve out.
“Based on that kiss, I’m not worried about it.”
Steve doesn’t remember this from his past, not this early. He remembers Tony upgrading his armor eventually, but not this early on. He wonders what that means.
“Me either. Hope that just means once we’re through this it’s nothing but smooth sailing.” Steve stands, taking Tony’s hand and pulls him up and into a kiss in one swift motion. Tony melts into it; he’s never been able to resist Steve.
“No prob,” Tony offers. “I’ll call you when it’s ready.”
"Look, just- just finish breakfast with him, and then will you come back to the tower so we can talk in person?" Steve asks. "It- this wasn't how I told him to do this. Yes, we talked about it and I know what he's asking you. I thought it'd be better if it came from him, I didn't expect him to be...like this."
Steve really isn’t in a hurry to get up, but he also knows he wants coffee. Tony groans in protest as Steve gets up and pulls on pants, but he’s smiling when he comes to the kitchen once the coffee is brewing.
“I know it is.”
“Then you don’t,” Tony says simply. “But I don’t think there’s a reason not to talk to him, Steve. Whatever happens if you talk to him, it’ll be okay.”
Steve shakes his head. “Let me in, I can explain everything.”
“I’d like to think so,” Steve says, because he knows the thought of not seeing Bucky again is unbearable. “Why couldn’t we be?”
“That’s impossible.”
And that’s really all he’s doing; giving himself a second chance to take that leap with Tony.
The research draws him into his own world; he's not very good at this, even after this many years, but Google is forgiving and he feels like he's at least making some progress. He hears the bedroom door open, looking up with a smile.
The depression had crippled him; he’d joined the army to escape, he’d sought help from a therapist, and
It’s been ten years since Steve walked out. Bucky knows now he deserved it; he was young, impulsive, and took Steve for granted. They were barely twenty, and Bucky thought they’d be together forever.
As he drives, Bucky wonders how good of an idea any of this was. He thinks it
. He's not entirely sure why, but this whole lunch felt like a betrayal, even though Tony was technically the one who suggested it. Maybe it's because of the nature of their breakup; neither one of them apparently wanted the other to go. Steve knows, in a tiny corner of his mind, deep down where he can't quite acknowledge it, that if it weren't for Tony, he'd probably want to work things out with Bucky and try again.
“I don’t know if that’s a great idea.” Steve sighs. “How are you not jealous about this?”
"I know," Tony agrees, but this is at least more in line with what he knows about Rogers. "Still seems weird, Rogers, but fine. I can accept that."
Bucky hesitates for a moment, and Steve wonders if he's pushed too far, but then Bucky replies, "Sure."
Remembering that leap of faith he feels like he took earlier, Tony sits on the stool next to Rogers and pulls it close enough so their legs brush. He watches as Rogers stifles a reaction, and doesn't move away. He leans over into Rogers's personal space to punch in a few things on the computer, not surprised when Rogers doesn't pull back.
“Tony, don’t not be friends with him because of me. I told you, I get it,” Steve says firmly. “We just...were young, and dumb. I felt like he didn’t appreciate me, and when I brought it up, I felt like he brushed me off.  So I left.”
It was time to live his life for him.
It’s not like Bucky’s a bad guy. Or even unattractive. In fact, he’s probably one of the best people Tony’s ever met in his life. And one of the more attractive.
“Don’t think about it. Just go,” he urges, stepping forward to close the distance between them. “If I give you that Particle, I stay here in the past, you won’t leave anyone hanging. Fury might notice, but none of the rest of them will. I’ve got-“ he breaks off, fear and hope and regret surging up.
Steve can’t imagine a world in which Hydra being gone isn’t better, but he’s never considered any other alternative.
“Fine with me. I don’t really know what the rules are for something like this,” Bucky says, smiling when Tony’s arms tighten just a bit, “but we’ve kind of already- we’re basically already doing this.”
And fuck Steve Rogers for being the one marrying him.
Tony nods. "Yeah. Makes sense, if I think about it. The first time you showed up here after..." he gestures vaguely, "everything with the aliens, you looked at me like you'd seen a ghost."
Bucky just smiles sadly. “I wish it’d been enough. You’re so much more than I ever deserved.”
“Hey, can’t say I blame you,” Stark chuckles. “I’m a catch.”
Tony pauses before replying, because he’s not sure. Sure, Bucky’s become a friend, enough for Tony to (impulsively, yes) invite him to his wedding, but is there a reason to keep in touch after this project is over? He’s not even sure Bucky would want to, honestly.
It’s Steve. Bucky steps back, at this point ready to just bolt.
“I do,” Tony agrees. “My longest stretch was something like ninety-six hours.”
When morning arrives, Steve wonders if he imagined the entire conversation last night. Maybe he was more drunk than he thought.
“Postponed,” Tony says with a shrug. “Once you and I are all finished up, then it’s happening.”
As they climb back into the waiting car, Stark’s phone goes off. He pulls it out, offering Bucky an apologetic smile. “Other half,” he explains, apparently replying to a text.
“Yeah, I know that, but I’m just saying if you do want to, I don’t really think it’s a big deal,” Tony replies, feeling like he can’t control the words anymore. “I know you love him.”
Steve opens his mouth to reply that’s a terrible idea, when he realizes it might not be. It feels sneaky, though, and he doubts Bucky would fall for it. "I don't think that's a good idea," he finally settles on, because it really isn't; he doesn't like how manipulative it feels. "It'll just make him uncomfortable. One of us needs to just...talk to him."
"You owe me for this," Tony retorts, but he downs his coffee and stands up. "Something really big."
“You’re worth waiting for,” Rogers replies, and goddamn if he isn’t basically perfect. Tony feels like he’s taken a lot of leaps of faith today, but breaking the mood doesn’t feel like a good idea just yet.
Bucky’s waiting for him, offering a hesitant smile as Steve walks in and takes a seat across from him.
“Thanks,” Stark replies, answering another text and then stowing the phone away. “Got plans? Come join us.”
They end up at a little hole in the wall pizza joint, Rogers offering a smile as they sit down.
Which he is, but he’s not him. Technically.
something."
Bucky awakes to the sound of his phone ringing; he groans, and rolls over to silence it, when he sees Tony's name on the caller ID. For a moment he debates silencing it, but it could be important.
Tony’s awake, and watching him, and Steve just smiles; he loves Tony so much.
“Better?” Tony asks, and Bucky can hear the smile in his voice.
Maybe.
He looks over at Tony, who still looks skeptical. Steve sighs and keeps talking, chest twisting as he does. "We were able to bring everyone back, and we were able to defeat him. But it cost us something, cost
“Can I?” Bucky asks softly, and when Steve nods, Bucky leans forward and pulls Steve into a gentle kiss. Steve immediately relaxes into it, and it’s still familiar even after all these years.
“I’m saying
“Good to see you,” he says as he sits down. Tony plops down next to him, taking a long drink of the cognac.
His eyes light on the wedding band on his finger, and he takes a breath. He's not cheating on Tony. Tony encouraged this. He's just reconnecting with one of Tony's friends. That he used to date. That he thought he was going to marry.
“Great.” Tony’s grinning. “Make sure to tell everyone you’re there because you worship me, Barnes.”
“What?” Bucky asks, stunned. “You’re joking.”
A long groan escapes him and he lays back down, because this conversation was a lot easier in his head. He isn't even sure what he means. Yes, Bucky's a good fit with them, yes he thinks Bucky's attractive (who wouldn't), yes he thinks that Steve and Bucky complement each other well, but does that mean he wants a relationship with them? And for them to have one with him? Or does it work independently of everyone and they're some kind of weird not-love triangle?
“Steve,” Bucky sighs, the fight seeming to leave him, “Steve, goddamnit, I’m sorry, okay? God, Steve I lov- I loved you so fucking much, I would’ve done anything for you. I thought you really meant it, and I thought I deserved you leaving me.”
Which is fine. He's fine. He can get over this; he got over it once before. Or at least he thought he did.
"Yeah," Rogers agrees, and goddamn if his voice doesn't sound slightly hoarse. "Yeah, no complaints."
!” Steve finally manages, and now Steve can’t stop himself from laughing. Because he knows better now, and has accepted that Tony’s ass is, in fact, quite nice, this is entirely comical. This is exactly how he would’ve reacted if he’d been himself in this situation.
"You can call me Steve, you know," Rogers replies, and Tony shrugs.
Steve’s arms wind around Bucky’s waist as Tony kisses him. Steve holds him close, and Bucky realizes that maybe this wasn’t where he thought he’d end up that day Steve walked out, but in the end, it was the best thing that could’ve happened to him. As they all settle together on the couch, he knows he wouldn’t have his life any other way.
Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever forget the day he left. He hasn’t thought about it in a long time.
He's not sure that's a bad thing. But he's definitely sure now that Rogers has a serious thing for him.
“I’ll try not to keep you too long,” Bucky chuckles, a spike of...he isn’t sure if it’s fear or what, shooting through him when Tony’s face lights up in a way that can only mean Steve is behind him.
“Great.” Stark stands up, a smile on his face as he reaches out to shake Bucky’s hand again, pulling out a fancy looking cellphone with the other. “You don’t have to, but I’d rather not go through the military to get ahold of you.”
Steve might have said don’t make any decisions, but unless they throw something at him really out of left field, he thinks he knows his answer.
“Hungover?” Steve asks, reaching out to pull Tony close. “I can go grab you some water.”
"You love him. That's what people that love each other do," Tony says, because that seems to make the most sense right now. "I honestly don't know. It's just been stuck in my head, that you should, that you need to, and maybe I wouldn't mind it because I can see why you love him or something. Maybe I'm just too drunk."
Before Tony can answer, the elevator door opens. Rogers steps out, all but dragging Tony with him because he still hasn’t let go of Tony’s hand, not that Tony really minds. There’s something about all this that, while it would normally send him running, is instead making him feel safe.
"Promise," Bucky agrees, but he already knows if this is serious, and they're both interested, he is too. "See ya soon, then."
But only because it’s Bucky.
“Fake punch something, don’t just wave,” he calls out. Rogers flushes, which is a check in the ‘Tony Wins’ column. The tests all check out with just a few tweaks needed, but watching Rogers fake fight nothing is amusing, so he lets it go on an extra moment.
“Well this is awkward,” Tony interjects, looking between the two of them. “Steve, did I invite an ex to our wedding or something?”
But of course Tony seeks him out. Bucky pulls him into a hug, because really, he’s happy for Tony, and Steve is mercifully absent.
“Just the one meeting. Since I’m the boss, I decide when I leave,” Tony smirks. He’s not usually one for this much affection, but Steve brings it out of him easily.
"You know that's a hard thing to believe."
Bucky’s slightly alarmed by the fact that Tony can already see right through his lies, but it seems like Tony’s just genuinely apologetic.
"And you came back here to do that," Tony says, a statement instead of a question. Steve shakes his head; it hadn't ever been about Thanos, though he knows it should've been. It was always about fixing the fact that he never had enough courage to tell Tony how he felt.
“Doubt all you want,” he says, feigning indifference. Rogers laughs again and pulls Tony towards him and into another kiss. “Jesus,” he breathes against Rogers’s lips.
Well, no help for it now. He collects the glasses and bottle and sets them aside, and decides to call it a day.
“So you don’t think I’m cheating on you,” Steve says slowly, pushing himself up onto an elbow to look at Tony, and really, Tony's never noticed how interesting the ceiling pattern is, “but you’re asking if I am anyway?”
“Tony,” Stark corrects, and shrugs. “Your loss. Invitation’s open, and for the record, you’re wanted there. Never met someone that had such an appreciation for what I do.”
was supposed to have with Steve. That this, all of this, should’ve been his.
Goddamnit. Steve forgot about Loki. Forgot he’s already met himself. He was so concerned with getting here, that he didn’t consider the fact that this isn’t a whole new timeline.
“Oh I know. But I don’t know what to do about that. I do, however, know what to do about the million projects. Sleep is for the weak.”
“And I call you my boyfriend,” Bucky says, but he hopes Steve hears the question. Steve does, of course, smiling at Bucky.
"You're a lousy liar, Steve. Good try, though. What's really up? I'm kinda busy."
“Well, no. Can I come in?”
“Nothing in particular.” Steve sets the sketchbook aside and pulls Tony onto his lap. “Good day? Wasn’t expecting you for awhile.”
“It’s rude,” Steve says, and Bucky just shakes his head, a genuine smile on his face.
A sign proclaiming “Stark-Rogers Wedding” appears as he walks into the roped off area, which sends a twinge through him; count on a wedding to remind him of Steve. He takes a seat in the chairs, fiddling with the buttons on his sleeve as the rest of the guests fill in and the ceremony starts.
Well, no sense in dwelling. When the end of the day comes he packs up his computer and his tablet, and definitely doesn’t take the long way to the coffee shop.
, Tony. You sacrificed yourself to destroy him. I'm here because I couldn't live in a world without you in it. I couldn't live in a world where you were gone, even though I knew you didn't regret it. So I came back here."
Bucky knows he should be over Steve by now. It’s ridiculous that Steve can still make him feel like this after so many years, but he really did think he was over Steve.
Which he never would’ve expected. They’re like two halves of the same whole, and seeing them together just feels right.
“Or you’re just another one of Loki’s tricks,” Steve shoots back.
“Yeah,” Bucky agrees, turning somewhat awkwardly to look at Tony. That grin is back, filled with a deep affection as Tony leans down to press a kiss to Bucky’s lips, and yeah, he’s on board with this.
"Enough," Bucky replies. "So...Steve what the fuck? What is going on here?"
"Oh, yeah, you can have dates with him too," Tony replies, turning to look at Bucky and winking. "And yes, I am married."
"I'm from the future," he says again, silencing Tony with a look when his mouth opens. "I know it sounds crazy. Six years from now, the same person that sent all those aliens and Loki here is going to destroy half of all life on earth." He breaks off, because the memories were muted until now, and the rush of emotion that returns is dizzying. He takes a deep breath, motioning for Tony to sit. He's surprised that Tony does; it gives him hope.
"So you believe me?" Steve asks, surprised despite himself.
Steve nods. “Tell me what to do.”
When the check arrives, he grabs it, offering the server a wink. "I got it."
“Wait,” he says, and Bucky freezes, looking surprised. “I am here because I want to be. I’m just. Fuck, Bucky, can’t we talk?”
It’d surprised him, to realize he didn’t care. He always figured he’d be the jealous type.
"Yeah?" Steve asks, hardly able to believe it.
“I don’t- maybe?” he finally tries, which is about as close to the truth as he can get.
A laugh is Rogers’s response, hand squeezing Tony’s tight. “If you say so.”
“You too, Stevie.” Bucky swallows down the emotion again and offers a smile before he turns to leave. He drives home in silence, deliberately not thinking about anything that happened tonight. When he gets to his apartment, he pulls out the bottle of cognac Tony sent him last week, and pours himself a sizable glass. He’d looked this bottle up when he got it, and had almost choked at the price.
"You're goddamn right I don't believe you." Bucky decides to call Tony's bluff, and picks up his phone to call Steve, who answers immediately. Bucky puts the phone on speaker, trusting the volume of the restaurant to keep their conversation private.
Tony broke the kiss, his forehead still resting against Steve’s.
“It’s just… I almost lost you there, once,” Steve surrendered. “Or him, I mean. Well, I

Steve Rogers apparently thought Tony was worth having around, flaws and all, because he believed Tony could do impossible things…
“Why, what did
“What was that?” Rhodey asked, as they started walking again.
“Yes.”
Tony swallowed hard.
As subtly as he could, he tapped and armed his watch, and shifted his weight into battle stance. He tried to keep his expression natural and his posture looking relaxed, as he slowly turned to look back over the drive-
He hadn’t had to worry about that, back when he was trying to be all Greatest Generation about the whole thing. The year he’d spent on the run, Steve at least had the comfort of simplicity. The purity of self-flagellation as a response to guilt and loss. It didn’t

So, he made do with berating himself for never asking about things that might’ve been useful - you know, practical, mission focused regrets…

. That this was the first time he hadn’t felt entirely responsible for making sure Bucky got treated like a human being. That he wasn’t listing all the points he had to make the doctors aware of, because they hadn’t asked, and wouldn’t ask. That he wasn’t thinking back over a catalogue of casual cruelties from the last appointment, trying to judge how he’d pre-empt them this time around.
And there
“But is there any point in doing that now?” Captain America asked. Because, personally, Steve might’ve preferred to do

himself. “I don’t know how he got them, or why he had them, but Hydra wanted them. So, they killed him… And your mom…. And stole the serum…”
“Well, it’s up to you,” Tony told him, still dubious. “I mean, it doesn’t affect the procedure one way of the other. It’s just to make you more comfortable. So, I guess, if it doesn’t make you more comfortable…” And the confusion melted away as he spoke, and Steve could just see him thinking it,

In fact, it was possibly only the focusing effect of seeing Tony’s injuries that kept him from fainting.
Tony gave another little squeak of alarm, frantically scanning in all directions for any possible means of escape, before he scrambled around Nat and Sam…
Immediately, it was clear that his eyes were fixed on Bucky-
similar locations within a hundred miles,”
Steve’s pleading whimpering grew tighter, the sound of it shivering up Tony’s spine. A low pleasure coiled in his hips as Steve started rutting sharply against his mouth, spiking with every move Steve made.
beautiful Tony was.
But there had
“You have this pool for a week,” Steve corrected… already thinking that there was a lot they could do, in a week-
“You know, I’ve met a few people who’ve talked like that” Steve told her, his voice kinder now “And some of them ended up among the best people I know.”
Although, he had to say ‘apparently’, because even as he was screeching to a halt in front of the building, he couldn’t really remember the drive over.
“Well… That
Steve nodded. A watery giddiness crept up along his legs as Tony led him over to the couch, until he felt unsteady on his feet. When Tony guided him to fall into the cushions Steve was relieved and ashamed in equal measure. His head was swimming…
He’d probably been there the whole time.
He knew it would feel different if he pictured it now.
It was a huge, white four poster bed… with a thick black chain cuffed to each post, and draped artfully towards the centre of the pristine cotton sheets.
Because Steve knew Bucky
“The guests.” He remembered “The, uh, the research, and-”
...Tony didn’t know what else to do.
But, really…
that’s right – but, really, a lot of the time, you’ve just found

“Jesus Tony…” Steve breathed, “I, God, I love you, I…”
And somewhere between then and now, Steve had given himself entirely.
The way Steve’s eyes lit up,
But he hadn’t realised just how much he’d

,” Tony begged, still trying to think what to beg for-
And Steve really hadn’t known that Tony cared enough to have hurt feelings in the first place. And now the thought that maybe he had… That maybe there had been a chance, and Steve had just let it pass…
“Well, thank you again for coming by,” he exhaled, as he stood up to take Steve’s hand again.
But Steve hadn’t said any of those things. Steve had just stood there and stared at him, before destroying Tony’s life in a single word.
And Tony just burst out laughing again.
“I love you. I am madly in love with you.” He surrendered.
And, thinking about it… Steve didn’t know what he thought Tony
Apparently, this drug just took whatever idea was in your mind – whether it was one you were trying to hold on to, or one that had a hold of you – and

, that for a second he could have given into temptation and simply begged Tony not to risk it-
“Steve?” Rhodey questioned, with an interested little smile. It took Tony a second to recognise his own slip up – and then he kicked himself.
This wasn’t the ordinary, human guilt of looking over a disaster he could’ve avoided, or a tragedy he helped to make happen.
And then Steve caressed his palm roughly over Tony’s thigh, and then between his legs – over the outline of his cock, hard and thick against the fabric of his pants.
The cloth he’d tossed aside earlier, with the good old-fashioned Earth based sedative on it.

But all he could do was moan, and gulp for air, and let this pleasure crash over him again and again-
The thrill of having Tony actually touch him.

Nothing’s ever going to be more important than that - that’s the reason I give a shit about building a better world in the first place. But… You’re right, I can’t pretend to be someone else just to keep you. And if the fact that I’ve even considered this terrifies you, and you don’t want anything to do with me anymore… then maybe I
“Like the people in the basement?” Tony guessed, and Zan narrowed her eyes at him.
And even outside of that - every ordinary, human anxiety Steve had ever felt had been eased by a day just lying in Tony’s arms. His fears that this relationship could only be complicated and painful had been replaced by an optimistic nervousness that things seemed to be going really well. His shapeless loneliness and confusion about life in the 21st Century had, at last, relented. His back even felt better.
“You are

Steve barely noticed.
knew that this connection was always there, that even their most mundane domestic exchanges were based on a deeper understanding than any human would know… But they were the same domestic exchanges as anyone else, none the less. Day to day, it was the same dynamic as their human relationship would have been, just better. They talked to one another, and worried about one another, and looked out for one another. Steve was as free and as comfortable giving his point of view as he would have been before, as concerned for Tony’s wellbeing as Tony was for his, every bit as responsible and as in control as Tony was…
For two whole seconds, Steve just stared at him like he was mad. Then he seemed to shake himself to the same conclusion Tony had come to, dropping his eyes and taking a breath before he answered.

He only knew that these words were finally starting to flow more freely…
“Oh, about… six months, I think?” She answered, like it was no big deal.
He couldn’t think of anything but how close he was…
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bucky move. He looked up just in time to see Bucky swipe his phone screen… and frown thoughtfully… and then
Now he’d remembered his prickling sense of injustice over the way SHIELD had treated him the last time; now he had to commit some mental energy to

Tony didn’t even know if that had made everything better – he was so overwhelmed, he’d completely forgotten the list of grievances he’d been studying for months. He couldn’t remember what their political disagreements were, or what issues underpinned them…
to keep Tony on the phone…
“Your family – through a series of complicated and unfortunate events, whatever – but they ‘ended up’ kidnapping a group of government troops. And your father – for understandable and altruistic reasons, you think – is the one that came up with the drugs to do that. And your mother, and your brother, decided to turn them into slaves… working on your fathers research?”
“What time is it?” Steve murmured, warm against Tony’s skin.

“So….” Tony smiled, glancing down at the invitation. “Would you like to go?”
That argument was so well practiced, it leapt to the front of Steve’s mind automatically-

A decidedly

And it was so against Tony’s entire life’s teaching to fall in love like that. To show and feel and risk any of the things you had to, to fall in love.
He knew, logically, that he’d been awake for a full twenty-four hours by then. That he’d had a particularly tiring day – emotionally and physically. That he
“Oh God, I’m not leaving you, I’ll never leave you, I swear” Tony promised, over the terrible, chilling recognition that-
He came hard, soaking his underwear, already pooling, warm and sticky, between his legs-
That, and his attention kept getting snagged by Steve, who was pacing around at the back of the living room and talking on his phone.
interested in ‘uncovering the truth about his dad’ - because in all this time, he’d still made no progress with it. He’d learned a lot of very mundane details about a few non-essential projects that his father worked on in the forties and fifties, and that was about it.
And yet, he was still stunned.
No one glanced up when Tony reached the counter and then turned back immediately, like he’d forgotten the order.

Which would usually lead to a rush of wonderful, warm reassurance, as Steve remembered –

That’s the fantasy – so you tell me. This is a Yes/No question, so you can just nod – are you uncomfortable with this, and do you want to go?”
A slightly embarrassed pulse of hope, when he saw Tony run his eyes over his chest - and smile.

Well… Tony might not
Steve heard himself moaning Tony’s name as he came hard over the front of his shirt.
But it didn’t.
And Steve was absolutely certain that Tony wanted to fuck him right now… but that wasn’t the same thing.
He knew that he could take her keys by force, that he’d remember how hotwire an engine – and he’d have done it, if there was no other option.
Steve had always had...

And I’d
But he didn’t have to consider
“Can’t chat – we have to take this thing down before anyone notices she’s missing” Tony explained, quickly. Rhodey just nodded. “Just make sure you have someone on watch in the conference room, okay? This is where I’ll open the portal, when we need you”
… And then started whispering
“And, in the meantime, I’ve got to sit here and work out a bunch of highly theoretical chemical equations, so I can maybe have some idea what we’re looking for when we get there.” He explained, already sitting down in front of his papers again. “So, you can either go exploring, or sit here and watch me write equations.”
“You’re nervous,” he observed, kindly. Steve breathed a shy laugh.
…Yeah, Steve definitely liked that reaction-
“You can’t just take people’s memories from them” Tony gasped, the first of them to manage some sort of outburst – but Steve could see him struggling with the enormity of his outrage, too.
He glanced up at it, his surprised frown quickly melting back into a smile. He knew that it wasn’t Steve. For one, Steve never took the elevator - but more to the point, Tony would always know when it was Steve.
He would

to grab hold of Tony’s hair – but didn’t. He just lay there, like he was writhing against invisible restraints, as Tony began to kiss his way lower, moving agonisingly slowly over the column of his throat. Steve tried to arc up into it, tried to move his body against Tony’s hands, wanting so much to grab Tony with all his strength and throw him on his back and-
For one, he knew that in reality Bucky would simply panic - if not because an aged and apparently mutated Steve had accosted him in the street, then because a deranged forty year old stranger had…
Oh, yeah… Because he was
But even that came to him in a calmer, clearer voice than anything in the last four days-
Tony’s hand stroked lower, his fingers curling around Steve’s cock. Steve throbbed hard again under his palm, like he was simply stretching into this feeling, a wonderful ache spreading through the small of his back.
than anything he’d ever felt…
Maybe it was simply that it had made him so uncomfortable at the time.
“Do you know everything that’s going to happen?”
He made a valiant attempt to swallow them again.
As Zan was speaking, Steve had circled around so that he could sit on the couch – next to Tony. Which was all he really could do, if he wanted to look at Zan while she was speaking… But still…
But there was also this feeling that Dimitri had done the exact opposite thing to Tony… That Dimitri had always been taught, or always assumed, that being bonded to someone was a beautiful, precious, perfectly natural thing… and, as such, found endless evidence to back him up. Everything he loved about Ottilie was another piece of evidence that he had found his perfect partner, and that in turn could only mean he was living his
The body
But Tony did kind of want to tell him.
Steve didn’t remember ever coming to a conclusion on that…
“Tony, I’m - sorry-” he whispered, suddenly worried that he might cry - worried that if he started crying, he might never stop. That he might just fall into this endless, wretched emptiness-
the urgent little noises he made, the frenetic moaning that grew lower and louder as Tony picked up his pace
Tony had never said that though.
Tony had been drinking his blood again… And then got completely distracted by Tony’s lips…
And then, in a low growl, Tony ordered,
It wasn’t even the word itself that he objected to. Tony was still too overwhelmed by the whole thing to recognise it as a word. It was just the idea of
“Good morning Sir,” JARVIS prompted, when Tony didn’t move. Tony semi shook himself to his senses - enough to step out of the elevator, at least.
“And it was all so obvious that it was never going to last – that
already knows that. If you think about it, its obvious. I mean… Like when Nat tried to fire one of the repulsors at Tony’s house, and she said it felt like having her arm blown off…” And, of course, he looked up at Nat when he made the observation…

...In her civilian clothes.
And he didn’t know why he was angry about this.
“You okay?” Tony asked perfunctorily, already turning to scan the surroundings.
And how

“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve whispered, miserably. “I never meant to upset you. I swear, I

The feeling of Steve’s chest pressed up against him, the dizzying safety and surrender of being held in that embrace.

There was quite a jump in Tony’s level of irritation with this, from just a minute earlier. It didn’t help that Steve’s efforts were getting more transparent, the more desperate he became. Tony was sure, any minute now, he was going to break and outright ask,
“Good, that’s important,” She assured him, leaning forward “There’s a reason that we only allow couples to take this drug – the same reason that the Varians only ever brewed this for couples…”
But this wasn’t about what Steve hated.
But Steve wasn’t talking to Adam anymore.
“Well, I have to say, that was terrible food done

But he wasn’t sure if there had been any actual
Which didn’t sound like nearly grand enough a word – but still, it fit so well. This giddy rush of happiness, this in-the-moment excitement, this safe and simple experience of the new.
“Yeah,” Bucky nodded. “…Thank you.”

an explanation.
Was it just that he was overwhelmed with choices, paralysed by the finality of them? Would it all come back to him when he calmed down?
“Sorry, I didn’t – I don’t know why I said all of that. I’m sorry.” Steve babbled, dropping his eyes. “Don’t we have a… an, alien…planet card, or whatever it was? Could we just ignore that please?”
“You were
“It’s not me, I’m not doing this-”
And he couldn’t ask that, obviously…
Tony was standing a few steps away from him now. Steve wasn’t sure when that had happened, but it didn’t matter… he just had to tell Tony-
There couldn’t possibly be anything more important than having that taste, right
Frantic now, Steve looked over to the kitchen area, to where Tony was walking in short, sharp lines as he talked to someone on his cell phone. Already, Steve knew that this was the wrong priority. He knew that he should be far more concerned by what he did to that photographer - by what he

And, I mean, it wasn’t like Steve could have walked into my life at all, if Pepper hadn’t fought so hard for it,” Tony remembered with a self-depreciating laugh. “And I never would have invited him back if it weren’t for you oh-so-carefully pushing me into it… But it’s more than that. I don’t know if I would even have been in the right place to feel this for him – or how he could possibly have liked me, if I was still like I was at 21… Or even if this feeling would have been enough, if it wasn’t for all the other stuff I had to fall back on…” Tony swallowed hard, surprised by how
Except his arms.
Tony could swear he sounded smug.
Until he felt Steve’s fingertips dig into his flesh - into that same spot on his inner thighs - gripping him hard as he spread him open-

And he heard Tony swear
Tony paused and took the opportunity to arrange his thoughts - still very aware of Steve
He had to concentrate to keep his hand steady as he unfastened Tony’s belt. And then, in a fit of eagerness – or possibly nerves – he curled his hands over Tony’s waistband and tugged his pants and his underwear down over his hips in one sharp motion-

“I’m sorry,” he cringed. “I
deserve this,” Tony carried on, his tone just a little darker, as he shifted to straddle Steve’s hips. “You deserve to be celebrated for all the things you’ve done, and rewarded - you deserve all the nicest, most wonderful things in life, because you are the most extraordinary person in the world…”
“Oh, Good Morning Mr Stark, I hope I didn’t disturb you,” came a warm, smooth voice from the hallway. “My name is Freddie; I’ve been assigned as your personal concierge.”
Instinctively, he screwed his eyes closed tighter and tried to bury himself into Steve’s chest, already aware that this calm sense of

he was suddenly fighting mental images of Steve in rubber.
He hadn’t expected any of this.
Maybe it was simply that there was no one here to see him, no one to maintain the illusion for. Maybe the enlightenment of Camp Lehigh was still unfolding in his head. But somehow, these thoughts weren’t immediately swamped by his own self loathing, as they should have been.

for a moment.
And then Tony pulled free, letting Steve’s blood trickle down over his arm, hot and thick and rapid. Steve’s head swam as that pressure released, the fog punctured by a little spike of pleasure with every beat of his heart-
logic Steve had used to talk himself into the worst decision that he’d ever made - it was the reason he’d kept that secret from Tony in the first place...

All of that was so immediately, emotionally overwhelming that it took Steve a few seconds to realise…

split up.”
conversations like this weren’t his strong suit any more than they were Bucky’s. And Bucky had to admit, he liked being around someone who was better at this than he was.
“Yeah?” He grinned.
But then Tony pressed just a little firmer against him, swallowing hard and exhaling heavily before he met Steve’s gaze. Steve felt a kick in his gut, and managed to pull himself to a tense, fidgety stop under Tony’s palm. And then Tony flexed his fingers against Steve’s skin, affectionate and reassuring, his eyes wide and warm… but his tone was steady, and very serious, when he asked,
“Fine, touché,” Tony muttered, begrudgingly. And then added more firmly, “but it’s still a fair question - why you and not me?”
Which was the only reason it had taken Steve as long as twenty minutes to get here.

It was a few hours later when Steve gave into the temptation to go and find Tony again.
His voice literally trailed off into a whimper as he tried to process that. Realising as it hit him that
Steve felt his spine jolt straight, his muscles clenching painfully in panic.

the phone number for it. He smiled at the way Tony’s face lit up when Zan finally handed it to him, the child-like joy that always flashed up in his eyes when he was given a new toy to play with...
This would always be how Tony found out, and this would always be his first impression of it, and now the choice was his. A choice that he was probably making right now, with none of the details that Steve
But he had explained
Wishing he’d been
If he said something wrong… If he did risk it all, and go in for a kiss -
“You feel better sweetheart?” He whispered, stroking a palm over Steve’s ribs. Steve just nodded, as enthusiastically as he could manage – although, truthfully, he had no recollection whatsoever of ever feeling bad. He couldn’t remember anything outside of this room, couldn’t conceive of any other priority… But he knew he felt better. That this was as good as it was possible to feel. Tony let his head rest on Steve’s shoulder, his hands stroking over Steve’s waist, curving over his hips. “Good…”
What it must actually have looked like to Tony.
“Urg. How garish.” Steve joked. And, before he could kick himself for it, Tony laughed.
Steve knew at once that Clint recognised him - he caught the subtle widening of his eyes, the way Clint quietly appraised him as he held out his hand.
“Hi, it’s Steve and Tony, right?” The man asked, extending a friendly hand. Tony was the first to take it.
“We’re not just going to let you walk out of here,” Nick informed him, in what was probably meant to be a commanding tone.
Steve’s brain calculated the battle strategy on auto pilot now.
And it wasn’t something he particularly wanted to do - or, if he was being really honest, something he saw much point in… But, for reasons that now escaped him, he’d taken it especially personally when
“Nothing. Doesn’t matter,” Tony mumbled in response. He could feel the blush scalding up his neck, burning the tips of his ears - if Steve happened to look back now, he was sure to see Tony glowing. People back at the hotel could probably see him-
maybe it’s more awful, losing him now… But maybe that’s just the price, and maybe that was worth it – until that’s not the whole price, and I’m actually just going to keep paying for this-”
“Hey, you’re okay,” Tony reassured, automatically. Bucky turned to face him, his eyes still not quite focused-
“You talk exactly like her,” Steve carried on, just a bit more firmly. “I don’t know if that makes any sense… But, I don’t know, if I hadn’t
And then there was the solid warmth of Steve’s chest pressed against him,
And the fact was, if Tony
. The caress of Steve’s hands, slowly working their way up his back now, the perfect softness of Steve’s skin under his palms, the growing ache of him rocking gently against Tony’s hips.
Steve had never not answered him.
Maybe Steve had needed Tony to explain his point of view, to show him the rest of the picture, before he could really think about his own side of it…
“…I didn’t get much of a debrief, but the way I heard it, if you’d got there half a second later they’d both be dead,” Rhodey offered, kindly.

Oh, Jesus, he was an idiot.
that Clint had been watching his every move since he’d first arrived. A few times, Steve had caught a glimpse of him - just a movement in the shadows, far above his head. Other times, it was a feeling that he knew who he was being watched by. Most of the time, it was nothing at all, not even the slightest clue that anyone was there-
...Was he obliged?

“How long are you in Washington?” He asked casually, as they walked across the hall.

Why he couldn’t have Steve, or anyone, ever.
Really, he would’ve liked to get annoyed at Steve right now. He could’ve gone into quite a satisfying little rant about how thoughtless it was for Steve to leave him bunched up in that chair for six fucking hours-
“Well, it’s fifty percent impertinence, fifty percent logistics, to be honest with you.”
Tony pulled back just enough to let Steve come in his mouth, sucking the head of Steve’s cock as he swallowed, dragging his orgasm out as long as he could.
Steve huffed wearily, leaning his weight on the desk and letting his head fall forward.
he didn’t want to talk to Pepper, or what that said about their relationship, or any other deep and unrelated questions.
“I love you,” Steve whispered, before he dropped to press a deep, slow kiss to Tony’s throat.
“You could say that, I suppose” Tony muttered, and Steve laughed again.
It wasn’t that Steve didn’t know what he wanted. For all the confusion he felt at the moment, Steve was completely and entirely sure that he wanted to be Tony’s – that he wanted it
He could drift back into that warm, quiet place that he’d fallen into when Steve had him cradled against his chest. That heady sense of contentment and security that he’d never known before.

them to be a bit thrown by the question – but if someone asks you whether you support the church, then it’s a simple yes/no question that Captain America deliberately avoided, and what is he hiding-” And Tony was cut short when Steve burst out laughing again.
Steve was sure that little jab would’ve annoyed him, back when he was 27.
Whatever it was, Stape knew he should feel ashamed of it. Just not enough to do the right thing, apparently.
“Yes, God-” he cried, his head falling back, his whole body falling apart as the sensation crashed through him. And just as it burned itself out, tightening into that need for more, Steve pushed into him again – harder. Tony called out, trying for something like

Tony had told him how hurt he’d been, and Steve still hadn’t said sorry-
“No,” Steve exhaled. “No, actually, it was probably one of the more efficient meetings we’ve had…”
“The other thing…” Tony began carefully, “is that I was looking through all the data, thinking I might be able to work out another Hydra access point - you know, so we didn’t have to go back to that bunker...” He saw Steve’s shoulders sag.

And then he felt Tony’s hand cup the side of his face, tilting his chin up just slightly. So, of course, Steve made himself focus,
At what was, now that he thought about it, an in joke.

And Steve watched her explain it – or, rather, he watched Tony’s face as she explained it, the way he ran ahead with a thousand more interesting questions, while she was relaying her basic instructions. Steve smiled at the way Tony just knew the exact co-ordinates for the compound conference room – but probably

Tony came, sudden and sharp and completely unexpectedly, his whole body trembling with the force of it-
“Actually, there are a few things I need to do first,” he said. He was pleased that Steve simply raised his eyebrows, intrigued rather than hurt or concerned. “I, uh… Tell you what, I’ll get Rhodey to drive me home, and I’ll talk to him, and Pepper, and… get a few things sorted. And you can get whatever medical checks and incident reports out of the way. And then you can come over tonight and we can talk properly. About everything. Is that okay?”
Perhaps that was just wishful thinking. Perhaps it was simply that Steve knew he
His cock throbbed pleasantly against his abs, feeling that friction roll from
And now he was just…
“I just… I can only tell you that I know what I want,” Steve clarified, carefully. “And… I can’t ever know if I’m being influenced by something I don’t know about. I can just tell you how I feel, that I’m sure.”
“So, are you actually going to do something about it?”
“Why? You’re right –
Not because it would get him out of the building more efficiently.
It occurred to him to wonder why he hadn’t said it before now.
“I’m sorry Tony,” Steve breathed, taking a little step forward. Tony dropped his arms.
But, God, Steve

Steve, looking at him like that… What might’ve happened, if it had been just the two of them there, if Steve already knew and there was no drama or trauma or complicated conversation to have…

His focus began to widen, his gaze settling somewhere beyond the horizon as he fell deeper into his own head.

that came from somewhere between his instincts and his cerebral functions, above his thoughts and at the root of all his basic impulses, all at once.
The authorities behind Operation Rebirth had decided, unanimously and without need for much discussion, that ‘Raising An Army Of The Undead’ would be bad for the propaganda war. The euphemism ‘Super Soldier’ had been decided on long before Steve was - and only became more important after Erskine was shot, and their proposed ‘army’ became one symbolic serviceman. For that first year, Steve’s only value to the Allies was as a poster boy and a bond salesman, and he didn’t need reminding that it would all have been for nothing if the truth came out - that, if the American Midwest discovered they’d been handing their babies to a vampire for souvenir photos, Steve would have done more harm than good.
It was only a few hours ago that he’d fucked Tony in a
Which made sense, he supposed - because that first timeline ended up as total shit.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve whispered, that pleasure tensing low inside him, tightening, pulling close-
Everything was so
He thought about The Avengers, the politics and the philosophy and the practicalities of them, a hundred different ways they might evolve and thousand new ideas he could explore on their behalf.

And, if the way you’ve dealt with that is by becoming an expert at invisibly defending yourself, while you just keep trying anyway – then you should probably be proud, in a way.” And he laughed softly, and he squeezed Tony’s shoulders…
And Steve only asked because he knew what Tony’s answer would be - because he was impatient to hear it.

They both wanted to keep Fury and SHIELD in the dark about as much as possible - as much out of spite as out of practicality. As such, they hadn’t told anyone that
His mouth had dried up when he turned back to Steve, to tell him,

when he recognised that he was tidying a room he hadn’t even been in for a year. And then he’d realised that he still had three whole hours to kill until Steve arrived – and regretted putting his work away so soon. And then he’d decided that he should probably think about what he was going to wear…

“…Well, before anything else, we have a simple ECG to run,” he replied, cautiously. “And a standard pulse meter to attach – just a cuff, on your wrist…”

“Oh my God,” he breathed, a dreamy smile washing over his features. Steve grinned, and dropped his head to kiss Tony’s neck, his lips so hot against Tony’s skin. Tony felt a giggle bubble up through his chest, a joyful, playful feeling welling up behind it.
