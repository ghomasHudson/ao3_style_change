“Mmm, they do make you look delicious,” John said. “We’ll buy you a new pair.” He pulled the fabric away from Sherlock’s arse and picked up the scissors he’d found. He carefully cut into the seam, creating a large slit in the back. “Perfect,” he muttered, rather proud of himself.
“And implying that –“
John resolutely stood up and began unbuttoning his shirt. This was what he was here for, right?
“Need what, Sherlock. Need me?”
Stranger: "I've got a hostage then, hm?" Sherlock murmured, leaning down to lave his tongue over one of the hardened nipples while his fingers pinched and teased the other. "I'll keep you until that gorgeous detective of yours comes to save you," he winked.
Translation of Italian (using Google translate. Please excuse my bad Italian):
Alessandro held up his hands in a conciliatory gesture. “Fine, fine. Let’s not fight. We’re family after all.” Neither Holmes brother moved. “I will…tell my mother that you are still working out the details. But you should move soon, cousin. A strong man like this will gain the attention of…others.”
As Sherlock led the other witnesses into the bedroom, John politely waited for the rest to enter before him. He closed and locked the door behind him, shutting out the sounds of the wedding reception still going on downstairs. He glanced around the room and smiled at the romantic, sumptuous appearance of the room. Having been friends with Greg for a while, he knew about Mycroft’s hidden romantic streak, and was pleased to see it out in the open in honor of their bonding.
Sherlock smirked. “You still exhibit human sensibilities, John. That was an important ritual and the sex, while admittedly stimulating to witness, is merely a part of it. It is a part of my culture.”
Sherlock paused and then nodded slowly, flushing.
John now has both Holmes brothers touching him, seeking to claim him. He swallows, nerves and arousal making him jittery.
Sherlock didn’t react, staring attentively at the journal.
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise and sat on one of the tall stools at the kitchen island. “So these are your vaunted cooking skills? I had no idea you cooked, brother.”
John flushed, flustered as if he was a school boy caught doing something wrong at recess. He smiled tightly and glanced at Greg, who was chuckling softly. “The two of you,” he muttered with a shake of his head.
“Dr. Watson,” he said, shaking John’s hand, “Good luck. You’re in good hands. The Holmes’s are a good family to be associated with. And it appears that Mr. Holmes here will…take care of you.” He winked and John tried to smile back.
“Sherlock,” John said, leaning forward and placing his hands firmly on the kitchen table, “I have military training, you know. I like to know what I’m walking into.”
John panted as adrenaline coursed through his system. He had no idea what they were saying, but Mycroft was clearly unhappy. Lestrade ran up to them and stopped just next to Mycroft, gun drawn even though he must know it would be useless. There was a gash on the back of his right hand, and blood dribbled down his skin.
“My dear Sherlock, who said anything about talking?”
“Well then, don’t control yourself.” He pushed his hips back, making them both cry out.
“Interesting,” Sherlock mutters. “The touch of your hand is more...powerful with my eyes closed.”
“Please, Myc,” Greg hissed.
“Yeah…” Greg took another swig, idly playing a finger along the side of his own neck. “Did he give you instructions?”
“Um, yeah. Everything looks fine.”
“Allow me,” Mycroft said. He started to help Greg undress. Once his tuxedo jacket, bow tie, and waistcoat were off, he started on his shirt. “I should find reasons to get you into a tuxedo more often, Gregory. You look ravishing.”
“Certainly not,” Sherlock says as if another answer would have insulted his mind.
“Clearly this excites you,” John replied, hand hovering over the bulge in Sherlock’s shorts.
“Irrelevant? I live with him. He'll notice."
Sherlock nodded and released John from his grip enough to walk them to the sleek black limo that was waiting.
“Come on, Gregory. We’re going to give my brother and John in Baker Street.”
John’s eyes widened. Somehow he hadn’t figured on clothes being removed. This was threatening to short circuit his brain. He twisted a bit, trying to rearrange himself surreptitiously, but he knew that Sherlock would know what he was doing.
“Of course,” John said more bravely than he felt.
“Lo fa, Alessandro. Rilasciare lui subito.”
“You’re biased,” Greg muttered. “It’s not every day I meet my fiance’s child.”
You: Mycroft brought the hand up to his lips. "Indeed. Anthea is smoothing out the paperwork if you're ready to come home?"
Sherlock’s eyes narrow. “What are you playing at, Mycroft?”
Stranger: Sherlock's clothes were scattered on the floor beside him and he opened his eyes, looked into the kitchen where John was, sighed and pulled on his trousers. Whatever. If this was what John wanted, he'll do it. "I've got trousers on!" He called from the sofa, closing his eyes again.
Stranger: Sherlock's hand pulled away. "Go on then. I'll be with you sooner or later."
“I told you, I want this, Sherlock. I-I trust you.”
At 221B, John carefully stripped off his scarf and jacket, watching the vampire warily. For some reason, despite having been living together for a while now, John was suddenly nervous. Would it hurt? What did Sherlock actually want? What if Sherlock lost control and took too much blood?
Snarling softly, Sherlock stood and swiftly began to strip off his expensive tuxedo, eyes never leaving John. “On the bed on your back,” he ordered. “Use the lube over there to prepare yourself for me.”
“And I love you,” Greg said, kissing him. He took a deep breath. “Alright, now what?”
“You are not imagining it,” Mycroft said, eyes opening. “I do feel at peace, and very happy.” He cupped Greg’s cheek. “You are feeling the new connection between us.”
Stranger: Sherlock arched up into him. "Then go get in the shower."
“If I tell you now, you won’t like it, you won’t sleep, and you’ll be agitated by the time we reach the Blood Registry Office.”
“You invite me here and then waive John in my face. And now you’re bidding on him. How predictable,” he spits.
John took the invitation and let go of Sherlock’s hands so that he could run a finger between his spread legs. There was ample lubrication. His whole body shuddered in anticipation. “Do you know how slick you are right now, Sherlock?”
“No,” he whispers.
“John, you said trust me?”
Sherlock leaned forward and settled himself over John’s prone body. He gently pushed John’s head to the side to expose his neck. The shifting of his weight had stopped the fucking, but he started up again. The thrusts weren’t as deep in this position, but it gave him access to John’s tempting neck.
“Uh, no. No, he says he only takes what he needs,” John said with a shrug and a frown.
You: "It is suddenly warmer in here, yeah"
“Diceria?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock appeared at John’s side. He locked eyes with Mycroft who nodded. “As discussed, I will text you when we are ready. But do not delay,” he said sternly, keeping contact with Greg.
Sherlock frowns. This man is selling off His John  like a piece of good looking meat. Up for the highest bidder. How vulgar. Besides, this ridiculous announcer doesn’t know the first thing about what makes John Watson so amazing and interesting. He doesn’t know anything about how John always manages to ask the question that helps Sherlock make the final deductions. He doesn’t know how John learned to merely smile and shake his head at the body parts Sherlock sets up as experiments in the fridge.  He doesn’t know that John once shot a man to save Sherlock’s life.
Greg laughed softly and sipped his tea. “Ok. The bond sounds like a good deal to me, what with the physical changes and all. What do you get out it?”
They walked into the large kitchen, where the older Holmes brother was prodding at salmon filets on an oven tray. He was bent over, and John’s mind immediately produced the image that he’d obsessed over all week, that of Mycroft Holmes arse up over Greg’s lap. He looked away before he could embarrass himself.
Not looking away, Sherlock put his violin down. “The contract is over, John. You don’t need to stay here…. with me,” he said, mind working on how to respond to this development.
“He knows,” Greg said. “He probably just doesn’t think he needs to show that he does.”
“That’s it. This will make it easier.” John nodded and reached up and dug his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. “Hmm, maybe I should have tied your hands,” Sherlock said when John accidentally yanked on his hair.
“They’re called profiteroles, John.”
Smiling predatorily, Mycroft pulls John closer to him, spreading his legs around him. Long talented fingers explore between John’s legs. Mycroft presses a finger at the hidden back entrance to John’s body, gentle but insistent that he be allowed entrance.
if you got married to a vampire.” He rubbed the back of his neck.
“Don’t you know?” John asked incredulously.
The man nodded with a tight smile. “Yes, please allow me to introduce myself, Dr. Watson. I am Sherlock’s older brother. I thought I should introduce myself to my brother’s newest…friend.”
“Much better. I know you’re nervous, pet, but you’re going to be spectacular. I know it. Don’t you want to please me?”
John leans up on his elbows, hovering over him, staring down into those beautiful steel blue eyes. Maintaining eye contact, he shifts so that their cocks touch. Sherlock is already half-hard again and he inhales sharply at the feeling, eyes fluttering closed.
John winced as soft pain bloomed in the wounded area at the touch of Sherlock’s finger, gentle though it was. The vampire frowned and pulled his finger back.
You: John chuckled. "Can't argue with you there." He looked down at his naked body, noting the thin film of sweat on his skin
Mycroft’s eyes flicked to his mobile on the dresser. It had been over an hour and Sherlock hadn’t responded to his text. He frowned. His mind leaped through any number of possible outcomes to the plan forming in his mind.
For several minutes, John stared at the door, as if willing the mystery of a vampire to walk back through it and explain himself.
Greg moaned as pain and pleasure ripped up his spine. He fell back on the bed, eyes still locked on Mycroft’s, and planted his feet on the bed so that he could push up onto the vampire’s cock.
Stranger: Thanks, his head's killing him and he's getting frustrated. Oh, he says that if you even think about being loud he's going to shoot you in the foot. I wouldn't worry, he's just annoyed. SD
Stranger: Sherlock swallowed thickly and nodded. "Yes, John." He sat up and spread the blonde's legs apart, then spit in his hand. He didn't have lube because sex before meeting John didn't interest him. He smiled down at him and moved his fingers in between John's legs. "Relax for me, John."
“So, um, how….?” John gestures in the direction that Annabelle disappeared, twisting his wrist, palm up.
Greg listened, letting his friend talk. Based on a law negotiated by Queen Elizabeth I and the vampire community of Britain, any human or family could sell a contract for one year of service to a vampire or a vampire family. One year of blood donations and…whatever else the vampire wished. It was a financial arrangement, and people often did it in times of need. One might ask
“So. Is Annabelle coming back?” John asks.
“And you’re an omega,” John answered, his voice lowering. He stepped forwards until he could feel the heat coming off of Sherlock’s body. The man was wearing only a towel wrapped around his waist, and John had the sudden need to run his hands over the smooth planes of pale skin. Without looking for permission, John ran his hands over Sherlock’s arms and chest.
John nodded at the command and swallowed nervously.
“Fuck,” Sherlock ground out when he saw John’s fingers wet with natural lubrication. “I had no idea my body could do that.”
John winced in sympathy. He could imagine that sharp pain that danced on the edge of pleasure tipping towards just pain. It also explained Mycroft’s reference to needles. “What makes some mesh and some not?”
John did so as Sherlock sat on a sofa near where the heated bowl sat on a table.
“Stay?”
“Rearranging the mantle multiple times will not make this event occur faster, Gregory,” Mycroft said calmly from his seat with a hint of amusement.
“It seemed only fair, considering we did combine our financial resources to ensure that no one else got their hands on you.” John cranes his head up to where Sherlock is speaking, standing right behind him. Sherlock gently, if possessively, rubs his hand down John’s bared neck.
Greg’s eyes widened and then he barked out a laugh. “No. Trust me, you’d
claim involve?”
When John deemed him stretched enough, he positioned his hard cock at the entrance to Sherlock’s body. Sherlock spread his legs wide in offering and locked eyes with him. For one moment, they paused, held there. Waiting. Then John directed the tip of his cock into the tight hole and pushed. They groaned in unison and John pushed in until the slightly swelling base of his cock was flush against Sherlock’s ass cheeks.
“Well. Right. I suppose I will ask him.”
John’s eyes flicked around and he suddenly realized something odd. Various medical personnel and police officers were milling around them, but no one seemed to notice them. As he watched, one of the nurses looked in his direction, but her eyes seemed to slip to the side, as if she couldn’t quite focus on them. Before he had time to consider this enigma, he heard a soft thump behind them.
You: Sherlock, didn't we talk about you needing to wear clothes around the flat? -JW
It takes a few minutes, but the two brothers setup a rhythm of pushing back and forth, back and forth, sharing him between them. Still holding on with one hand, John grasps one of Sherlock’s achingly tempting ass cheeks in his hand. He squeezes hard and is rewarded by a particularly strong thrust into his mouth. Sherlock fights the urge to grab John’s head and slam into him repeatedly.
The touch of humiliation was perfect and Greg whimpered in arousal. Mycroft sneered. He placed one clothed knee on the divan close between Greg’s spread thighs. “Such a lovely morsel for me.” He let one claw extend on a long finger and ran the tip up the inside of Greg’s thigh. A thin line of blood appeared.
“Oh, sorry si-Sherlock." He paused. "Seems more comfortable anyway,” John said, a hint of relief in his voice.
“Five hours? In the middle of the day?” John asked incredulously, taking the offered glass.
“What?” John asked, flushing when he realized he’d been caught staring.
“Yes ma’am,” Sherlock interceded. “This is my - companion, John Watson. John may I introduce you to Victoire.”
Sherlock pressed his hand to the front of the red shorts. He could feel their combined seed, warm and wet beneath the fabric. He grinned lasciviously. “Keep them on.”
Mycroft nods and smiles. He holds his glass up and watches the firelight dance through the amber liquid.
John hissed at the bite, loving the pain that swirled with pleasure and the tight feeling of Sherlock’s cock filling him. It was overwhelming and he moaned loudly, not caring who might hear. “Please….Sherlock please!”
After sitting like that for several minutes, the need to do something, anything, became too strong. He was not the type to do nothing. Taking a deep breath, he stood up and walked down the stairs. He found Sherlock composing music in the front sitting room. The vampire glanced up at John briefly.
Mycroft cupped his cheek. “Now, my love. The time is now,” he said softly but firmly.
“Ah. So I guess I shouldn’t….”
Stranger: Sally deleted the last few messages and put the phone down next to Greg, who now had his hands pressed over his eyes, trying to block out the light in the room, having already given up on the sound. "Mycroft's on his way." She said as quietly as possible, still earning a disgruntled noise and a frown. "Thanks." He said sardonically, waiting until Sally had left the room to curl in on himself and shove the pillow over his head.
Stranger: "Terrified," Sherlock smiled into his skin, licking over his Adam's apple and down his chest. "Sensitive?" He asked, moving his fingers over John's nipples and playing with them. "They're cute. Like you."
“Only if I’m allowed to aide you,” Mycroft replied with a grin.
Stranger: Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and lightly bit his lip, his tongue prodding against John's lips.
“Wait,” Greg said, grabbing his arm. “How’s it going with him? He treating you ok?”
“Mycroft. Enough.” Greg squeezed Mycroft’s hand.
Fascinated, John watched Sherlock squeeze several drops of blood from each finger in turn and let them drop onto a blank space on the book’s page. Their blood combined on the page and then Melbourne produced an eyedropper and squeezed two drops of something onto the blood.
John groaned and took two long purposeful strides towards the bed. He climbed on top, hovering over his husband. His mate.
“They’re one of my favorites,” Sherlock said with a frown over his shoulder.
John stood up and offered his lover a hand. “I think we’ll need to buy you more shorts. Do they sell them in other colors? I think we need to get you several.”
Greg shook their hands. “Please to meet all of you.” He felt the vampires scrutinizing him down to his heart rate and breathing pattern. At least with Mycroft’s tailor he was dressed well for the occasion.
“And now I’m here and you’ve suddenly decided to show off your seduction skills?”
Sherlock palms John’s cock through his pajama bottoms, steel eyes bright. “Do you want help with this?”
John chuckled and finished off his beer.
“Oh lord that’s gorgeous,” Sherlock breathed.
Sherlock put away his violin and watched John intently. “It’s called reses. It enables a vampire to immobilize someone temporarily. If used lightly, it can make you slow. Someone once described it to me as ‘moving through molasses.’ If used with a heavier touch, it can completely immobilize a human, though not indefinitely.”
The woman’s eyes widened and she stood up hastily. “Of course, Mr. Holmes. Please have a seat. I will let the Registrar know that you are here. Can I get you or your companion refreshments?”
“For a very long time, I see,” she replied. “Mycroft, will your parents be joining us? I do hope to see them before the wedding.”
“You were on display. In fact, you’re still on display. For me…and you like it,” John said, letting his hand rest over the bulge in Sherlock’s shorts.
“Yess, that’s right. Touch me,” John murmurs, eyes slipping closed. As Sherlock’s hand slips down to his collarbone, John opens his eyes and locks them onto the steel blue ones staring intently up at him. The hand runs down his chest and then those long fingers are joining John’s hand, wrapping around their erections. John groans and lets go, bracing himself above Sherlock, keeping enough space between their bodies.
You: John tilted his head back and licked his dry lips
Some part of Sherlock’s mind was surprised at the strength of the possessiveness that he felt rise up towards John. His mind flashed to the bonding ritual they had witnessed and at that moment, Sherlock knew he wanted that with John. He slammed into John’s body hard. Releasing one ankle, he leaned down and bit down over John’s heart.
“So yours,” Greg responded as his body relaxed around his lover’s cock.
Mycroft Holmes: Don't be alarmed. It's to do with sex.
“N-no. Feels….good.” John laughed. “Really good.”
Is it wrong that I want to stay?
Stranger: Greg sat up with a groan, swaying slightly and leaning on Mycroft's shoulder as his vision filled with spots. He stopped and cradled his head in his hands, moaning softly, cursing under his breath.
“Not particularly. We are not remotely the first couple to be in this situation. Children born from such agreements are relatively common with the older families.” Mycroft watched Greg. “Are you – ok with this, Gregory?”
“Yes, they’ll be here later this evening after dinner. I requested that Gregory be allowed to meet you and Xavier without the whole family to contend with….”
Greg licked his lips and nodded. “Yes sir. I do.”
Sherlock knelt between his legs and pulled off John’s shoes and socks. Then he stood up and helped John take off his jumper and undershirt, leaving him bare chested. “Lie back on the bed, John,” he directed. As John shifted to the center of the bed, Sherlock pushed off his own shoes and socks, and lay down next to him.
At this, John wrenches his mouth from Sherlock’s and looks at Mycroft with wide eyes, who smiles pleasantly and slowly undoes the zipper. The sound of the zipper pushes through the silence in the room and John knows that, if he cared to look, he would find two pairs of blue eyes staring intently at the spot where his boxer-briefs were just visible.
Crouching on the ground, next to the warehouse, John reached back under his jacket and pulled out his Browning. He smiled slightly to himself, eyes darting around the scene thoughtfully, as he checked the gun for readiness. It had taken a bit of arguing, but he had managed to convince Sherlock that he would be a bit more comfortable at crime scenes if he wasn’t wearing a tailored suit. He now sported a Haversack shooting jacket. The best, of course, that a Holmes’s money could buy. John had to admit that the jacket was rather comfortable.
John snorted softly and shook his head. He stepped closer. “My normal life was dull, pointless. With you I’ve found….more.” He gave a small, almost apologetic shrug.
John sits back, chuckling softly at the sheer oddity of the situation. Only Sherlock can utter multi-syllabic words after cumming that hard. “Glad to be of service,” John replies as he leans against the headboard.
“I know. But still…..” Mycroft gently turned Greg’s head to the right and placed a kiss on the skin behind his ear.
In response, Sherlock wrapped his legs around his alphas waist and nodded. John pushed back in hard and fast, forcing his knot into his omega’s waiting body. The alpha growled happily, lips pulled back revealing his teeth.
Mycroft smiled and stood up and pressed himself flush against Greg’s body. “I have seen many sensuous beings in my years, my love, but you elicit such strong responses that sometimes I don’t know if I can control myself around you.”
Sherlock’s arms were pinned neatly behind his back in the shirt, and John grinned down at him. “Spanking and bondage in one night, John? We’re getting rather adventurous, don’t you think?”
“Sure, I’ll bring it by your office.”
“That went well, I think,” Mycroft said. He kissed Greg’s cheek. “Shall we sit down with some tea?”
John shifted, watching Sherlock from his vantage point on the pillow.
Alessandro shrugged. “If you tire of him, let me know, eh? I’d love to taste him again.” He gave John a leer. With that, the vampire climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof.
Mycroft laughed softly. “For going through with the bonding. I know it wasn’t easy to do. And I’m grateful that you trusted me to complete it with the right witnesses.”
Sherlock gently sliced through the thin fabric of John pants. John tensed up but felt no slice of pain, so he opened his eyes and looked down to the predator kneeling over his body. “Sherlock?”
Instead, John was looking at what was clearly the penis of an alpha. He touched the length and hissed at the sudden pleasure. Looking down, he could see a knot starting to form at the base, seeking a mate.
“For me?”
“A couple of times a year. Eventually he will need to move to England to learn of his heritage and his responsibilities here. But for now he’s still young.”
Xavier eyed their joined hands and snorted. “You two. Everyone will get overwhelmed by all the lovey dovey happening.” He shoved his hands in his pockets and returned to his mother’s side, glancing back once to give them a bit of a smile.
Greg meets Mycroft's son
John looked over Sherlock’s shoulder. The sigil was a stylized lion, claws out and facing the left, with a book lying open over it. A single eye looked up from the center of the book. John smiled as he recognized what must be Sherlock’s nod to knowledge and observation. His personal sigil.
“Alright ladies and gentlemen, let’s see the initial bids for our handsome military man. Ohhhh, £2,000! Looks like you’re going to be popular tonight, Dr. Watson! Shall we see if we can that a bit higher, hmm?”
“Well…I don’t know. Sounds like Mycroft thinks so. Sounds like Sherlock likes you. I don’t think he’ll force you to do anything you don’t want, though. He’s
Mycroft swallowed nervously. “For being rude to our guests.”
Sherlock’s lips parted, and John could see the fangs extended. The vampire leaned down and lapped at the skin on the side of John’s neck. One hand cradled his head, and the other applied strong pressure to his stomach, pushing him down. After three long licks, Sherlock pierced the skin. John gasped, and would have arched up had he been able to.
“Mm. Drink the water. You’re dehydrated.” John drank, feeling the water wash over his parched throat. He looked around the room with a disoriented frown, noting his shoes placed neatly next to the couch and his jacket thrown over the back of a kitchen chair. His Browning was sitting on top of its case on the mantelpiece. “There is Thai food in the kitchen. I took the liberty of ordering something for you. You need nourishment.”
John blushed at the thought and idly fiddled with the brocade fabric edge of the couch.
John swallowed, still pinned to the wall. “Right. Um, how much blood will you take?”
“What did you just do?” Sherlock asked, twisting around to see.
“But you do not find it unpleasant.”
You: "Yours. Have been," John panted. He canted his hips so that Sherlock could go deeper.
“Why do you think I’m not interested?” Sherlock says, quickly typing in a number and hitting the submit key. Mycroft smiles and sits back.
Sherlock smirked up at him and lifted the cut material off of John’s hard cock. John was hard. Achingly hard.
The Registrar opened the door to his office and turned back to them. “Oh, and do take that young man home and take care of him, Mr. Holmes. He looks a bit peaky.”
Greg smiled fondly. “You and I both know that the Holmes boys are more sentimental than they let on. I mean, I know they’re out there arguing right now, but for all of their bluster, they do have each others’ backs when needed.”
Stranger: *around his
John turned his head, looking at his over his shoulder. “Are you going to -?”
He hung up and considered for a moment, staring at the phone in his hand.
afraid of having the baby?” she asked gently.
That evening, after curry takeout, John eyes Sherlock as he pats his mouth with the thin paper napkin. He sits back in the chair, finger nervously tapping on the arm of the chair. Sherlock is thinking. When is he ever not?
Mycroft considered how to go about it. For all that he’d thought of this, he suddenly wasn’t sure what to say. His planned speech suddenly seemed too flowery and stilted.
“Yes, but you love me anyway.”
Greg saw the blush and snorted. “Ok, so things are going ok between the two of you. Follow…corny as this sounds, follow your heart. You’re a good guy, John Watson. I think your instincts are good. Very good. Follow them.” Greg patted his shoulder.
Greg snorted. “Definitely not. So there will be some blood drinking and sex…” he paused and frowned. “Will, um, your mother be there for that bit?”
Stranger: "You're ready now?" Sherlock smiled down at him. "Because I think you can use a /little/ more of this," he gently caught the small bundle of nerves in between his fingers and stroked it.
Part of John rebelled at the idea of the whole situation. He was spread out like a sacrificial virgin.
John gaped at him.
“You find the idea of having been aroused by it disturbing,” Sherlock commented.
After a moment, Sherlock looked up at John, who nearly staggered back at the weight in his sharp blue eyes. “Not unless Greg calls requiring assistance,” he said bluntly.
The vampire crowded into his personal space and held John’s chin in one elegant long-fingered hand. He paused, eyes flicking quickly over John’s face, reading every minutia. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and soft and fast. “John, when we first met, I told you that I…appreciate your unique blend of skills and abilities. I have since found, during our short acquaintance, that….” Sherlock paused and ran his eyes over John’s face again, “that you are too precious of a commodity to not protect. My blood will offer you more than a mere vindico blood mark would do.”
You: "It is suddenly warmer in here, yeah"
Greg shrugged and pushed down the feeling of disquietude. “I guess it won’t impact us as much as I first thought. As long as she doesn’t have any way to get between us.” He was surprised by the vehemence in his voice.
“I think you’re making us feel incompetent,” John said with a chuckle as he rested his hand on Sherlock’s thigh and squeezed. “We usually just get takeout from the Chinese place down the street. My hours at the clinic change around a lot…”
------
“At first we were going to raise him here, but then it looked like war – World War I – would break out any moment, and she took him to America, where they remain today.”
Greg took a long swallow and put the glass down carefully. “Shit.”
Mycroft laughed. He leaned up and placed a soft kiss on the tip of Greg’s cock. It was soft. Closing his eyes, Mycroft could focus on Greg’s heart beat. It was high and fast. Greg was nervous, which was going to make this harder. He helped Greg out of his clothes until he stood before him naked. “You’re beautiful,” he murmured. He stood up and started to undo his bow tie but Greg stopped him.
Note: I’ve decided that vampires drink tea. Or rather, can drink tea. Because you know what? I can’t imagine Mycroft Holmes, so thoroughly British, not drinking tea. Cheers.
John reaches out and unbuttons Sherlock’s pajama top, slowly uncovering his pale skin. When it’s fully unbuttoned, he pushes it off Sherlock’s shoulders. He runs a hand down the skin. He’s seen Sherlock with his top off before. They’re flatmates. But he’s never given into the impulse to touch until now.
“Mmm, yes, now that you mention it, I’m ravenous! I suppose it would be inappropriate to call for room
His sister finally stepped back with a huff and looked him up and down. She grinned.
Dressed in his suit slacks and shirt from before and holding the mug in front of him like a shield, John cautiously walked down the hallway to the front sitting room. He could feel the tension the moment he stepped into the room.
Sharp blue eyes looked into his own for a moment and then Sherlock nodded. “That is…acceptable.” He stood up and got dressed swiftly. “Sleep again, John. You need your strength.” He leaned over and reached out as if to caress John’s face and then stopped and walked out the door.
Mycroft snorted. “And carries substantially longer consequences and responsibilities. Do I need to be blunt? Why did you choose that claim?”
John smiled, noting how easily the DI spoke of Mycroft. “You almost make him sound like he’s human.” He nudged Greg in the ribs playfully.
“But we’re not, um, mates.”
Stranger: No. SH
“And…for picking fights with my brother.”
“Ah, good. He’s already told John. Sherlock informed me this afternoon that he plans to take John to the Blood Registry Office tomorrow to make an official claim on him.”
You: "Eh, he's too...too nuts." John groaned and arched his neck, loving it when the sensitive skin there was touched and nibbled and licked
Stranger: Greg looked down at his shoes, shuffling his feet a bit. "You're the bloody genius, Sherlock. I bet you could deduce it if you tried."
Stranger: Sherlock pressed closer and watched John's face. "I've solved it."
Mycroft runs his hands up John’s thighs and spreads them further, leaving John open for him. He slicks up his cock and presses the tips against John’s open hole.
John looked at the text from Greg and frowned. “He says they’re going to take my picture. Why do they need a picture of me? I thought they already had one from when you initially claimed the contract?”
“Mmm, yes. And I appreciated the effort, Gregory.”
Mycroft chose not to answer. “And you, brother? He’s right, if crude and tactless. You shouldn’t allow John to wander around unclaimed. The heart of a warrior. And strong and loyal. He is too…tempting for our kind.”
You: *shirt
A sudden crash and shouting had everyone tense and shifting on their feet. John shifted his weight, rolling his shoulder that was getting stiff in the cool autumn air from his own tension. The shouts and noises from the radios were confusing and indistinguishable. Several shots were fired.
Sherlock dramatically rolled his eyes, but he appeared sincere when he said, “About time, brother.”
“Mycroft, I can’t. You know I can’t.” Lestrade stood tall, facing his lover. “This was my operation. Not only is there a mountain of paperwork to do for every bullet fired, but it’s my responsibility. To my team. They need me.”
“I don’t think either of us did,” John said with a chuckle as he kissed the spot under Sherlock’s ear.
John looked at him questioningly.
“Still. Do you need help? Medical attention?”
The vampire laughed softly. “You must know by now, love, that I would rarely deny you anything.”
“How-“
“Finished with your shower?”
“Alessandro came at his mother’s behest. Victoire is, well, she’s very old. Very powerful. She has a large number of vampires, thralls, and humans under her control. And she hates not knowing things. That she sent a family member instead of mere minion means that she is very…concerned. She sent him to find out whether the rumor is true that I’ve finally chosen a mate.” He decidedly did not look at Greg as he said this last part.
The blond woman handed each of them a cup of tea with a bright smile, which John tried to return. He took several sips and smiled. What was it about tea that always made him relax? It occurred to him that Sherlock had asked for it for this very reason. The vampire hadn’t touched his.
The older Holmes brother smiles and stands up. “Then I suppose I should follow suit.”
Simul sanguis: Latin, vaguely translated as "together blood"
Sherlock smirked. “Stay there.”
John moaned wantonly. “Only for you,” he panted. He squeezed his anal muscles again around Sherlock’s cock again, urging him on.
John nodded, unsure of why this was a surprise. How would Sherlock do it with needles? Remove his blood via syringe and store it in the fridge?
John’s hips pushed up into Sherlock’s hand and he didn’t resist when the vampire let go of his cock and carefully titled his head to the right and forward. John tensed automatically.
Lestrade lifted his hand and brought it down in the middle of his arse with a loud smack. Mycroft grunted softly. With that, Greg set up a smooth pace, bringing his hand up and down with a regular rhythm. Mycroft grunted and whimpered, but didn’t cry out.
Sherlock reaches back and pushes a couple of slick fingers into himself, breath hitching as John’s hand joins his and eases the fingers in deeper. John guides Sherlock’s hand, helping him open himself up slowly. He lies back, watching in awe as Sherlock’s face twists in pleasure.
John looked intently down at him. He pulled his cock out almost all the way and then pushed back in, setting up a rhythm between them.
It was as if Sherlock needed permission. Or maybe he was waiting for it. At his mate’s words, he shuddered and came hard. John gasped at the sheer intensity of it.
Sherlock blinked slowly at him, eyes darkening ever so slightly.
Stranger: Greg put almost his entire weight on Mycroft, closing his eyes and nodding carefully, trusting the other man to not kead him into anything. "Is that food? I'm starved, had to skip breakfast and lunch was a bag of crisps."
“Right,” John replied as he texted Greg.
“I have, at times, encouraged him to consider such a plan. Though he would need Greg’s approval first, of course.”
Growling, Sherlock sank his fangs into John’s neck and came a moment later. The dual sensation of the vampire coming in him and drinking his blood from his neck was too much for John. His climax came hard and fast. He cried out and lay there, panting.
When they break apart, they are both panting. John scrambles off the bed and pushes his pajama bottoms and pants down his legs. He stares for a moment down at his flatmate. There are so many things he is aching to do, and it takes a moment for him to focus. He shakes his head to clear it and Sherlock smirks, as if he can read his thoughts on John’s face. He reaches for his hard cock.
Sherlock snorted and watched London pass by through the heavily tinted window.
Mycroft beamed. “I’m glad you like it, love.” He kissed his hand. “I - know that this part isn’t easy for you, and I want you to know that I value your trust.” He kissed the inside of Greg’s palm.
He tugs at Sherlock’s pajama pants and pushes them down to his knees. John looks at the bare, hard cock in front of him. It’s weeping, sitting tall and straight from a bed of dark wiry curls. Like the rest of Sherlock, it is beautiful. Suddenly, John  wants...everything. He wants to more than show Sherlock. He wants to make him fall apart and put the pieces back together with his own hands.
You: John braced himself, moaning softly
You: "Greg, you have an above average brain that you put to use in solving heinous crimes. Not to mention that you periodically bring me interesting cases. You are already in my good graces." Sherlock smiled just a bit, still graspong his wrist
John’s eyes flicked up to meet Sherlock’s. Thankfully they had returned to the normal grey color. “Why?”
“Still, some humans…object to it.” Mr. Melbourne shifted some papers on his desk unnecessarily.
“Fuck yes!”
“Did you enjoy it?” he asks in a whisper.
The vampire took the whimper as a sign of approval and began to move. He began to fuck John, not too fast, but his movements were measured and each thrust jerked John’s body on the bed. With his free hand, he grasped John’s hair and pulled his head back. His eyes focused on the pulse point in John’s bared neck.
John smiled sleepily. “Glad it makes you better.”
John grabbed the new bottle of lube helpfully helpfully set out with a towel on the bedside table. He spread his legs wantonly and paused for a moment to watch Sherlock reveal his beautiful body before coating two fingers with lube. He hissed as he pushed both fingers inside his body, lying back to revel in the feeling.
John moves restlessly on the bed, hard and aching, and he’s fairly sure he can feel cum dribbling out of his stretched hole.  He arches up into Mycroft’s hand, seeking the fastest route to pleasure. Sherlock props himself on his elbow, idly caressing John’s face and neck, and John reaches for him.
A fine sheen of sweat covered Greg’s body and his fingers clenched around the ropes binding him to the bed. He groaned as Mycroft paused his smacks to his arse cheeks and placed hungry open-mouthed kisses to his inner thighs.
“Of course,” John said somewhat awkwardly before glancing at Lestrade, one eyebrow raised. Beside him, Sherlock smirked.
Stranger: "Oh, I hope not. Wouldn't want to share you with Moriarty," he murmured, sucking a hickey into John's pale neck and shoulder.
that?” he asked over his shoulder as he walked into the kitchen.
John sits with a sigh and stares at the fire. Why did he agree to subject himself to this again? Oh yes. For charity.
Sherlock’s eyes darkened in response. He leaned down and teased the tips of his fangs along the tender skin that he saw there. John shivered.
“Well I should hope so. Do you think he’ll actually ask?”
“Oh, I apologize. Of course you thought you were in her home. No, this is a Holmes estate.”
John decides that the image of Sherlock cumming is one of the most beautiful, arousing things he’s ever seen. Sherlock throws his head back, eyes wide, mouth open, uttering a long, deep moan that makes something vibrate inside John’s body.
“Well, I suppose it could be seen a mark of ownership….which certain political groups, who shall remain nameless, dislike as a matter of conscience.” He shrugged elegantly.
John inhaled softly at the first breach and reached up behind him to grasp the headboard. He looked up into Sherlock’s eyes and licked his lips, tilting his head to show off the blood trail on his neck.
“But I-“
Sherlock nods, the smile on his lips twisting in a way that could almost be predatory. He is still leaning casually against the door. “It occurs to me that I should know. It’s important to know these kinds of things, especially since so many people are motivated by it.”
“Leaving?”
John let out a soft whimper when he felt the vampire’s lips linger close to the skin on his neck. Over the months Sherlock had bitten him in numerous places on his body, and each spot offered John a different experience of mixing pleasure and pain. The vampire seemed intent on cataloging them all, and John was happy to let him. But his neck….that seemed to enthrall both of them.
“You forget that we age more slowly than humans. This is his third degree. He’ll turn out like Sherlock yet.”
“Up, love,” John said more loudly. “Face me. Shoes and trousers off.”

"Sai, cugino, se ho posseduto un animale domestico che puzzava così, non avrei mai lasciato il mio cazzo lasciare il suo culo.”
“They’ll bring out the book of fabric samples. You can choose the fabric for several. I will choose the rest,” Sherlock said dismissively.
John was silent for a moment. “Wow. Somehow I can’t imagine Mycroft putting up with it.”
Sherlock looked down and then his eyes flew back up to meet John’s. “You’re an alpha,” he whispered.
“And you did, John. Quite a bit, too.”
“Are you feeling ill?” Sherlock said, noting John’s glazed eyes.
John froze and his eyes narrowed. “That assehole that attacked me?”
Stranger: Greg nodded minutely, blinking open his eyes to look up at Mycroft, "I'll be more careful, I swear. I'll even wear that unwieldy vest if it makes you happy." He mentally cursed himself, that was going to land him in trouble, Mycroft didn't know that he didn't usually wear his vest.
“Listening devices. Or cameras,” Sherlock said dismissively.
“At this point, you think I’m not?”
“You’re thinking. Loudly. I can hear from across the room.”
The door opened and Melbourne approached them with a happy hum. “Excellent! He doesn’t look
sat down, hoping that John was too tired to notice his wince as the plug shifted against his prostate.
“Mmm, yes. Mine.” Mycroft pulled his hips back and then thrust forward, building a hunger-driven rhythm. He shakily reached between them and removed the cock ring from Greg’s length.
John felt like prey being stalked. He should have been afraid. He should have been petrified. But as Sherlock reached the bed and gently pushed his legs apart, all he could think of what how utterly right this felt.
In the car, Sherlock was surprisingly not buried in his mobile. “Sherlock. You can call me by my name, instead of…other titles,” the vampire said after a moment.
Sherlock hissed as John moved lazily against him. He placed a hand on John’s hip and stopped his movements. “You’re tired.”
“I – I would hope that – I mean we have been spending substantial amounts of time in each other’s company, and it would seem appropriate to further substantiate on these relations – I mean –“
You: Sherlock stood up swiftly and stepped into his personal space. He grasped Greg's wrist and stared down into his eyes. "You are attracted to me in a sexual manner and wish to impress me so as to get into my good graces."
“So…do you think you guys are going to have a baby immediately?”
When nothing else was forthcoming, Sherlock turned back to the laptop. John watched him, brain working at the problem that was Sherlock Holmes. It was clear that something was happening that John couldn’t identify. Both Greg and Mycroft Holmes seemed to think their relationship to be significant, more than that of a normal donor and master. And every time Sherlock fed from, plunged his fangs into his skin, John felt…so much more. Like his life before had been flat and grey and dull.
Stranger: I'm aware, Sherlock. GL
John scrambled to obey. His cock was hard and making a tent in his pants.
John smirked, never tiring of the way he could elicit unbidden responses from a centuries old vampire proud of seeing his body only as ‘transport’. Looking up into Sherlock’s eyes, John began to pleasure him with his mouth, taking him in deeply before slowly sliding back up. Sherlock lost patience at the slow movements and grasped John’s head with a snarl and pushed his cock deep until the tip of his cock was pushing against the back of John’s throat. He smirked, holding it there as John gagged.
“Yes!” Sherlock shouted, though whether it was in response to John’s words or his finger, neither knew.
“Um, just how we’re doing. Whether you feed from me. Stuff like that.” John flushed a bit. He now had an almost Pavlovian response to the idea of feeding, the mere mention of which made him hard and aching. If Sherlock noticed, he never said anything. John leaned against the counter and watched him, trying to look casual.
“We will drink from each other, for starters. There is….well, there is something of a sexual component as well.”
Stranger: "Oh, uh sorry about that..." Greg muttered pulling away from Sherlock, and looking at his feet. "Just wanted to be closer..."
“And, if I may be so bold, Dr. Watson, may I ask if my brother has fed from you? I realize that it’s rather personal, but I am asking for my brother’s health. He has, in the past, not fed often enough and found himself weak.” He spat out the last word.
“Are you
“Sorry. I’ll try to think more quietly.”
John pulled the Browning out and nodded. “What are you going to do?”
Author's note
“I – I….Gregory, I’m a father.”
“Hmm, apparently we’ve discovered a new kink,” John said with a grin. “I’m going to enjoy exploring this with you.”
With a smirk, John grasps Sherlock’s cock through his pajamas, eliciting a hiss from him. “Like that, you mean?” John says as he rubs the hard flesh, smiling as he watches Sherlock slowly abandon his restraint.
John’s eyebrows rose in amusement.
John swallowed and glanced away with a light blush. “It’s...I’m glad I can help.”
“Whatever it is, just say it,” Sherlock says, sounding almost bored. “Then maybe it won’t be such a loud thought.”
“Bastard,” Greg panted.
John sat back with a sigh of relief. “Does it look ok?” he asked, turning his head to the side.
I decided it was time to live up to the 'explicit' tag. Cheers! :)
“Thanks,” John said, shaking his head to rid it of the fuzzy feeling. “What
John can’t help it. He smiles. The speech is so incredibly Sherlock; bold, clinically dispassionate, and blunt. As if he isn’t suggesting they have a wank together.
John glanced at Sherlock. “Wait, permanent?”
“And you say I’m beautiful?” John says with a soft chuckle.
“It should be healing faster,” Sherlock muttered.
“I am relaxed.”
“And leave before watching my brother be humiliated? Never. I relish it.”
“Yeesss,” Sherlock replied, wincing a bit at a particularly rough thrust.
“Do you – want me to leave?” Sherlock asks, his low voice washing over John’s senses. John hears the moment of hesitancy, insecurity.
John suddenly finds himself with a lap full of Sherlock. Long lithe legs settle outside of John’s thighs as Sherlock straddles his lap. Their cocks touch and Sherlock whimpers softly, resting his forehead against John’s. John doesn’t think he’s heard Sherlock whimper, ever. He gently presses his lips against the tempting neck and mouths the skin.
Greg shrugged. “Depends on where you both take it. You could form a nice friendship, live as colleagues who happen to share blood from time to time. Or…well, I mean, John,
“Not bad so far.”
Sherlock laughed lowly and moved to lap at another cut, and then another, until John’s chest was whole and healed. He slithered down John’s body until he was poised over John’s crotch. “May I?” he asked.
“Very well. I shall have dinner waiting for you.”
“Nope. Teases don’t plan to follow through. I plan to follow through with absolutely every whim we can come up with between us.”
going to bring John tea and see how he is.” With that, Greg tried to walk steadily to the kitchen to pour a mug of tea. As soon as he was sure Sherlock couldn’t see his face, he winced.
“I’d like to start with seven suits. No three pieces – that’s my brother’s style. Simple, comfortable. Two dozen shirts. A handful of ties. Nothing too flashy. And I suppose I must order one with the family crest on it for family gatherings and the like.” Sherlock sounded annoyed at the last request.
You: John hissed and cried out. "Fuck!" He panted. "Do that again"
“Mmm, vampire Mycroft Holmes: makes his boyfriend dinner, gives great head, and cuddles after sex.”
“Do you have any idea, Gregory, how utterly desirable, erotic, and…stimulating you are?”
“Ma lui non ha alcuna, cugino segno. Si dovrebbe prendere più cura delle tue cose. Potrebbe vengono per nuocere.”
The car stopped in front of Henry Poole & Co. and John followed Sherlock into the store, feeling out of place. They were immediately set upon by a small horde of attendants, who clearly were expecting them. they were ushered into a nice sitting room and John quickly found himself standing stock still as an elderly man, the head tailor, took his measurements. The vampire ignored most of it with his face buried in his phone.
“The marking. The claiming,” Sherlock said with a half-shrug. “Even after the wound heals, which it will, soon, others of my kind will be able to sense it. To…to smell it.” He slid his hand along John’s neck. “They will all know that you are mi-that you are under my care.”
“Here? Now?” Mycroft said, breaking the silence.
“It was nothing. I have merely stayed in the same room and listened to your breathing and heart rate,” Sherlock said with a nonchalant shrug.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but his eyes flicked to John and pinned him down where he stood as the newly married couple descended the stairs to a round of applause from the guests below.
“You have a good point,” Greg said with a chuckle. He sipped his own drink, half to hide his embarrassment. “Speaking of Sherlock, I’m glad you’re sticking around with him. He seems...good for you somehow. If you don’t mind me saying you seem to have more focus….Mycroft likes the two of you together, too.”
Stranger: "Do you want me to join you in the shower?" He smirked.
Still wrapped up with Mycroft, he doesn’t need to look down to know that the hands gently easing his legs apart are Sherlock’s. Sherlock kneels between his spread legs, hungrily intent on the large bulge in John’s boxer briefs. There’s also a small wet spot that begs to be tasted. He leans down and mouths John’s cock through the thin fabric, causing him to whimper into Mycroft’s mouth.
Sherlock swallows several times, calming his breathing. One of his delicate aristocratic hands grasps John’s thigh, thumb rubbing playfully. “Now, I believe that you distracted me from my initial question earlier.”
You: John moaned at the feeling of his teeth biting into the skin. He knew that he'd have marks tomorrow, but somehow that only made it hotter. Marked by Sherlock Holmes. His ass clenched around Sherlock cock at the thought
They rode the elevator to the third floor and walked down a ostentatiously decorated hall. Sherlock pushed through the double doors without pausing.
“Yes, sir. I saw the Holmes family book personally to confirm it before phoning you.”
Sherlock glared at him, and John could very well imagine that this wasn’t so much Sherlock’s choice as Mycroft’s. Or perhaps Mummy’s.
Sherlock picked John up easily and carried him to his bedroom where he deposited him on the bed. John hastily began taking his clothes off. He knew he looked a bit disheveled and desperate. And he didn’t care.
John’s eyes darkened. His newfound alpha impulses kicked into gear in the presence of an omega. An omega ready to be bred. He stood up and nearly prowled towards his husband.
As they kiss, Sherlock stands and begins to undress, intently watching them. He carelessly lets his bespoke tuxedo fall to the floor and idly palms his hard shaft.
Greg groaned and dug his finger nails into the vampire’s back as he futilely tried to get enough leverage to push up into his thrusts with his legs bound. “Fuuuck. Myc. More. Please!”
“Cheers.”
From inside the limo, John sleepily watched Mycroft and Greg interact. He had to admit they were rather sweet together. He had never seen the imperious Mycroft Holmes act so human with anyone else. He leaned his head back on Sherlock’s shoulder.
You: "Oh G-d," John breathed. He licked his dry lips. "I-I want you to fuck me, Sherlock."
“Wear the dark charcoal suit tomorrow,” Sherlock said, not looking up.
John jumped and came out of his reverie. He cleared his throat and didn't meet the vampire's sharp eyes. “Yeah. It was…good to see him.”
You're chatting with a random stranger. Say hello!
“Don’t take too long,” John replied. “I-I want you on top of me. Soon.”
“If you’re sure, then yeah.”
“John!”
“Please tell me that’s the only time we have to do this.”
“That won’t be too awkward?” Greg asked.
Stranger: ((Brb))
You: "So do you," John moaned. He held himself open for Sherlock.
John started to wriggle more out of his slacks, but Sherlock stopped him. “No, like this. Just like this,” he said as he unbuttoned his shirt. He pulled John back and they both inhaled at the feeling of heated skin against skin.
The sedan carrying John and Sherlock was, as usual, sleek, black, and with very tinted windows. Sherlock was reading emails on his mobile and muttering about something about Lestrade needing to determine whether the fiancé had gone to university in Liverpool.
John jumps up and spins around, reflexes kicking in. “Mycroft?” he asks dubiously as the elder Holmes brother closes the door as quietly as he had opened it.
John was cut off when Sherlock tilted his head up and kissed his mouth. Sherlock’s lips were cool to the touch, as was his tongue, which John found oddly arousing as the sinuous organ pushed at his mouth. The vampire's hands gripped his biceps strongly, keeping him in place as he focused all of his extensive energy on Doctor John Watson. John found that he enjoyed being the center of Sherlock’s attention, and he leaned back, almost relaxing into the kiss. As his cock hardened, he pushed his hips forwards, blatantly showing Sherlock the effect he had on him.
“Mmm,” John replied sleepily. “Yes. Should probably change my pants though.”
“Predictable? How so? Is the idea that I’d like to spend time with John so incomprehensible to you?”
John took a deep breath and nodded. Greg moved off and John looked up again at Sherlock. Vampire. Blood drinker. His master. His contract, sold by his poor parents when he was a child, had been claimed by Sherlock just shy of the expiration when he was 34. They were now four months into….whatever it was that was they were doing. On paper, John was in Sherlock’s personal aide, under contract for his services. For whatever the vampire required. Literally. He kept their flat at 221B Baker Street relatively clean and did the shopping. Mostly he helped out at crime scenes by providing medical information on corpses. They ran around London like energetic schoolboys. It was the most fun he’d had in a long time.
John sat stiffly. One finger nervously tapped out a rhythm on his leg. He was, as requested, wearing the dark charcoal suit. They were running a bit late because Sherlock had burst into John’s room just as he was tying the knot in his tie and insisted that a different shirt would be better. John had sighed and stripped off his shirt and changed into the crisp white shirt and put on the offered tie. John had to admit that the new tie, which was deep green, made his eyes pop out. If Sherlock thought he looked good, he didn’t give any indication.
John stared up at the ceiling and swallowed. “It feels…odd. Both painful and…good – as the skin mends itself back together.”
Sherlock frowned. “I will when you cease interfering in my affairs, Mycroft.”
“What? Like digestion?” John asks with a smirk.
“And me?” John asked casually. “What did Alessandro want with me?”
Greg shrugged. “If vampire poetry is to be believed, the connection is soul mates.”
Then John is surrounded by skin as the other two men lie on either side of him.
That is when Sherlock moves from his perch and swoops down on his flatmate, surprising him by sitting on the edge of John’s bed. He puts his hand on John’s knee over the blanket. John tenses but doesn’t move. He’s not wearing a shirt and, despite the fact that Sherlock has seen him shirtless before, he suddenly feels rather naked.
The vampire’s eyes widened when John moved his finger from Sherlock’s mouth to trace it slowly over his own neck, leaving behind a tempting trail of blood. Sherlock’s nostrils flared at the blatant challenge and invitation.
“I want to show you everything,” John murmurs. “Will you let me? Do you trust me?”
“Mmm, yes. You said you have questions?”
self-controlled.”
Lestrade shrugged. “He’s got awful habits when it comes to eating and sleeping. A couple of months after we started seeing each other, there was some emergency in Berlin.  He came home and collapsed and slept for 2 days. That’s when I pried it out of him that he hadn’t sleep for 3 days, and barely ate. He looked like shit. I was so scared for him and then I was angry that he wouldn’t take care of himself. In a fit of an argument, I said that next time he pulled something like that, I’d put him over my lap and spank him. He dared me to.” Greg shrugged again and grinned at John. “I took him up on the dare.”
“You shouldn’t trust me, John. You’re strong and brave, but so weak to me.” He pulled out and yanked John’s head back by his hair as if to demonstrate how easily he could break the human.
“Alright. Shirt off and on your hands and knees,” John said firmly, helping Sherlock up and into position. John sat back on his heels and admired the sight. How could he be so lucky? Sherlock put so much trust in him. “Stay just like this, Sherlock. I’ll be right back.” He stood up, giving him one smooth smack before wandering over to the kitchen, shedding his shirt as he walked. He rifled through a couple of drawers before wandering back.
You: John didn't bother to ask *how* Sherlock knew that. "I thought of - of you." John blushed.
Mycroft laughed. “True, but it helps the fantasy.” He teased a fingertip around one of Greg’s nipples. “Are you truly ready to give yourself to me, your lord, to be used for my pleasure?” He pinched the nipple.
“Thought you’d like that.”
Stranger: Greg smirked against Sherlock's lips, nipping gently against the lower one. He grew a bit bolder and began to palm Sherlock's erection gently.
“It’s time my dear,” he said, ignoring anything he might have heard. He ran his hand along Greg’s back and placed a kiss on his cheek.
“Evil, evil man.” Greg sat up with a wince and began to pull on the clothes that the vampire handed him.
– are common when one of my kind claims a human under contract, but I do not wish to take advantage of you.”
“Hmm.” Mycroft paused and pretended to think about it for a moment. “No. I’m not done with you yet, love.” Mycroft grinned up his fiancé’s body.
“Hush,” Mycroft says, perching elegantly on the couch next to him. “Sherlock and I both believe that you are beautiful, so beautiful you are.”
“Perhaps,” Sherlock suggested, keeping his voice low and calm, “you would like to shower while I search the suite for bugs?”
“When you go to Tesco’s today, please pickup a bag of sugar. I need some for my experiment,” Sherlock said, abruptly changing the subject.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he looked closely at John’s face, the way his pupils were dilated, his fast breathing. He leaned down and licked at one long red stripe across his belly and looked up the beautiful expanse of John’s skin to meet his eyes. “But do you want me to stop?”
“Thank you. I’ve…found it to be rather relaxing to cook.”
Xavier eyed Greg warily, who backed away from the group so that he could speak with the young vampire alone.
“No,” Sherlock said with a slight shake of the head. “That only happens when necessary when fighting.”
John nodded, a bit dizzy. He was still achingly hard, and there wasn’t a hope in hell that Sherlock hadn’t noticed. He opened his eyes again when Sherlock covered him in a light blanket. When had his eyes closed? Sherlock knelt next to him again and smoothed the blanket down. “Lie still. You’ve lost a lot of blood.”
Stranger: Sherlock gently circled the sensitive skin of John's entrance before actually sliding his first finger in and out, carefully stretching John.
“Hi. It’s good to meet you. Mycroft wanted…..” He paused, unsure of what to say.
“We should scan the suite for bugs.”
“Very well. But don’t blame me if it leads to disaster.”
Mycroft's eyes slipped down to the cut on Greg's hand. "Perhaps a snack now?" he asked, eyes glinting as he raised Greg's hand to his lips. Locking eyes, his tongue snaked out and slowly licked at the trail of blood. Greg swallowed a whimper as his lover lapped at the wound, using his saliva to heal it faster than humanly normal.
John smiled and leaned into Sherlock’s protective embrace.
You: John shuddered at the feeling of those talented fingers focused on his skin. He could feel Sherlock's cock pressing between his ass cheeks, and he pushed back against it.
“Watching their bonding was….intense,” John said.
The young blond woman, a human, smiled and asked politely, “Good afternoon. How may I assist you?”
Mycroft Holmes paused, about to take a sip of blood. “He feeds from you?
“Sherlock,” John breathes, “Are you sure?”
“But Sherlock-” John protested.
“Dull. Send it to John.” Sherlock waived a hand in dismissal.
Sherlock sat in the chair opposite his brother and picked up his violin and bow. “What of it?”
In a public, ok semi-public, place for Lord’s sake. But half of John hummed along happily and urged his to spread his legs wider for this eccentric vampire.
Glancing quickly at the bathroom, he sat on the bed and lay back so that he could gingerly swipe a finger between his legs. No wetness. Not even a drop. Perplexed, he sat up and looked down.
“It’s not exactly that simple. And yes, he’s a prick. I’m sure you noticed his reaction to you and John.” He nodded. Mycroft took a deep breath, a reflex considering he didn’t actually need to breathe. “Not all of our kind approves of taking human…mates. It’s a bit unconventional in some circles.”
John swallows. “Well. It’s just, well, what exactly did Mycroft mean?”
John stopped. “So…you want me to live here? With you?” He dared not actually look at the vampire.
Sherlock pulls away and glares at him. “And you’re interrupting.” But he still climbs off and gestures politely with his hand, as if allowing Mycroft to go ahead of him.
Sherlock leaned back against the wall with a soft moan. John grinned and moved in, kissing his neck and collar bone, nipping at the skin.
John paused, making Sherlock glance up at him. “Well, he said you don’t always feed directly from your donors. He was very interested in seeing the puncture marks on my wrist.”
“Such a lovely little cock, too,” Mycroft purred. “Of course you’ll never fuck me with it but it’s nice to look at,” Mycroft said with a cruel smirk.
At the same time, Greg and John looked up the wall of the warehouse to where Sherlock Holmes crouched half-way up, seemingly effortlessly holding onto the wall. His eyes were focused on the distant door where the teams would enter the building. As if hearing them, he turn suddenly and looked down at the two men.
“Uh, yes. Send it to me, I’ll take care of it,” John said, knowing that wasn’t what Greg was trying to ask. “When do you need it by?”
Mycroft ushered Greg out through a side door, deftly avoiding starting conversations with wedding guests. John watched as the door slipped closed behind them. “Mycroft is taking Gregory to prepare for the bonding. A blushing bride Gregory may not be but I believe Mycroft still wishes to ensure that he feels safe and cared for.”
John closed his eyes and let his head fall back on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock caressed his neck and undid the top couple of buttons on his shirt. He ran a sharp fingernail down the skin, tracing the artery and eliciting a soft shiver.
Sherlock nodded with a deep hum and John hesitantly ran a hand through his dark curls. They stayed like that for a minute. Finally John spoke. “So, now what?”
Stranger: "Quiet sounds lovely, but don't you dare." He murmured, exhausted, "God, I'm getting too old for this nonsense but I'd go mad without it. Completely unfair." He reached blindly for Mycroft's hand, giving up and waggling his fingers, inviting Mycroft to take his.
“Sir, you asked me to report to you on the claim registered by your brother today at the Blood Registry Office.”
“Rumors?”
“All clear!” Lestrade yelled as they approached the pair. John crawled out and approached them. The officers were handcuffing the murderer, but he noticed that Sherlock was still kneeling on the ground, head bowed, one hand on his side.
“Of course. Your family’s traditional location.”
Finally, Greg stopped. He was panting lightly and the man on his lap was flushed and squirming. He ran a hand soothingly over his back and arse, and leaned down, murmuring softly.
“Mmm, though possibly not always on Mycroft and Greg’s carpet.”
John ran a hand over Sherlock’s arse and then his cheek. “Ready love?”
John frowned.
You: John's nipples hardened into small pebbles. "Then I surrender here and now," he said, running his hands over the skin he could get to
“Come home, Gregory.”
“Yes, but then, I think you’ve belonged to my brother for a good deal longer. Gentlemen.” And with that, Mycroft steps out and closes the door.
Greg looked down the length of his body into the vampire’s bright blue eyes.
John gasped, eyes wide. The feeling was…extraordinary. There was pain, yes, but it was almost so sharp that it didn’t register. The doctor in John paid attention to the feeling of the flow of his blood to where Sherlock’s mouth was latched on. And then a slight pinch at the fangs pulled out and the tongue was licking him again.
“Well. Yes. I suppose that I can admit to such an - alteration,” the elder Holmes said slowly. “This would seem to be an appropriate time to announce that I have asked Gregory to bond with me. And he has accepted.”
“Yes,” Mycroft said, not rising to the teasing jab as he smoothed down his tuxedo coat. “Thank you for standing watch over us. Both of you,” he said, turning to John and inclining his head.
As before, Sherlock’s lips were a bit cool to the touch, as was his tongue. John felt a hand run through his hair and he shuddered, remembering how the vampire’s hands had turned into claws when fighting the murderer in the alley.
Sherlock’s mobile beeped with an incoming text message.
John blushed under Sherlock’s sharp gaze. “You’re not looking bad yourself,” he said, gesturing to Sherlock’s new bespoke tuxedo.
Greg pushed his hips down silently asked for more, needy. “Please, Myc. Need more.”
Stranger: Sherlock nodded and pulled back before pushing his hips forward into John.
You: "Solved it? Solved what?"
“Ohhh, fuck. John, I need you – I need you on top of me.”
Beneath Sherlock, John keened. His body was overloaded, but he hung onto consciousness with all of his strength. There was no way he was going to miss a moment of this. His world shrank to the dual points of sharp heat where he was pierced by cock and by fangs.
The vampire looked into his eyes. “That if you want to stay. With me, we must make this work. The sex is….”
“Yeah. It’s…long term.”
“Putting my considerable skills to better use,” John said with a smirk as he assessed the wound. As he watched, the skin appeared to be renewing itself slowly. “Amazing,” he breathed.
“After having lived with me,” Sherlock completed the sentence. He gave John a feral smile that showed his fangs.
And gasped.
Stranger: Sherlock's clothes were scattered on the floor beside him and he opened his eyes, looked into the kitchen where John was, sighed and pulled on his trousers. Whatever. If this was what John wanted, he'll do it. "I've got trousers on!" He called from the sofa, closing his eyes again.
“Cheers,” John said and patted the roof before taking a deep breath and walking back inside.
“Yes. Always.” The vampire attached a black leather ring around the base of Greg’s cock and balls. He paused and then attached another cock ring to himself. Greg grinned, clearly loving the effect he had on him. Mycroft smacked his inner thigh. “Cheeky.”
You: Sherlock stiffened slightly when Greg pressed blatantly up against him. His mind was overwhelmed by new information, including the hardness poking into him.
Sherlock inclined his head. “Yes ma’am. Soon. I was hoping to have the witnesses ready when they are.”
“You’ve been working too hard. Come, the London Broncos game is on.” Mycroft carried a tray of food and a goblet of blood into the sitting room, where they could relax on the large plush couch and watch rugby. Greg followed, slipping off his shoes and socks as he did.
“I don’t think I’ve cum that hard in a long time, “ John said with a chuckle. “Twice.”
You: John ran a hand over Sherlock's check. "So what course of action do you recommend?"
“Must’ve been a hand full.”
John pushed his cock inside completely. “I think I like hearing your gorgeous voice telling me how much you want me.”
“Sherlock Holmes. We have an appointment at 1:00.”
They stopped smoothly in front of the long, rounded building that housed the Offices of Vampiric Internal Affairs. It was pure white and sat, dignified, across the Thames from Parliament, like an unsubtle reminder that the vampires watched the workings of human government.
Mycroft placed Greg’s hand on his cheek, closing his eyes at the feeling of warmth. He could
“Fuck,” Sherlock grinds out. His eyes open wide, pupils wide and dark. He shakily brings one hand up and touches John’s face. John wouldn’t call it a caress because it isn’t. Sherlock methodically runs the pads of his fingers over the angles of his cheek and chin. As before, John imagines that Sherlock is forming a mental picture, a map, of his body, memorizing every angle and curve. Sherlock runs his thumb over his lower lip, and all John can think of is that if this is mapping, then he would willingly become the other man’s atlas.
“A month and a half.”
Mycroft crawled off his lap and stood up, walking to the door that led to the stairs. He paused and looked at John and Sherlock, giving them a smile. “Good evening. I hope you won’t mind if Gregory and I leave you early tonight. You are welcome to stay the night. Or as long as you wish.” With that, he padded out of the room.
You and the stranger both like Johnlock.
John swallowed and panted softly. With his head in that position he couldn’t see Sherlock, and he felt the vulnerable nature of the position in the way his neck was bared to the vampire’s hungry gaze. Between his legs, his cock was hard and leaking. One hand curled around Sherlock’s wrist, where he could feel the inhuman strength in his muscles.
You: Mycroft patiently helped Greg inside. One of his people had delivered dinner and he could smell it from the kitchen. But the house was empty as he had instructed. "Living room on the big couch?" he asked once inside.
