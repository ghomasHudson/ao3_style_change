John snorted, "I wouldn't agree with that."
Sherlock grinned, staring down at her arm and taking it into his hand, "Would've been better if it was just him."
Sherlock cocked his head, "Why?'
John sighed. Sherlock looked at him. Sherlock’s eyes were focused on John’s, close to curious. They made tiny movements around John's face, darting from feature to feature.
He groaned, “Fine. Alright. Just for kicks, but I’m getting out as soon as I can.”
"No, no, that's not- I'm not saying we're- Look..." Sherlock sighed, "I'm not- I'm not the best. When it comes to this stuff. I'm aware of that."
"Sherlock?"
"Too much."
last."
“Oh? Where would you go, Sherlock?”
John smiled, "That's probably the nicest thing you've said."
John snorted, "Don't flatter yourself." He forced his feet to step forward, towards the car, and towards hell in the process. Funny, he felt like he'd been here before.
He shook his head again, “That’s what happens. That’s how it works out. You’ll end up hating me anyway, why not do it now?”
"I know people."
Sherlock huffed, "Why? Why are you here? Why do you do all these things you don't have to?"
"Well, this was a nice talk we had, can you come back down here, then?"
I didn't sit in my chair. My hands felt like they were going thin at the edges, like they were fading into the background, and I couldn't have my whole body fade. I grabbed my coat, caught a cab, and arrived at Scotland Yard, which was quiet too.  Lestrade was the first one who saw me, but everyone else was turning their heads. I wanted them all to disappear. My head felt fuzzy, blurred. I should've been here with John. John would tell them all to go fuck themselves. What were they looking at? Didn't they have jobs to do?
He tore a hand through his hair and sprang back up. Sherlock probably wouldn't even answer, and it's not like he would know it's John.
dramatic." He clicked the lighter.
He snorted, "I just said it makes you sound sleazy."
"Have I never said?"
“I…I could tell Mycroft.”
Sherlock took another drag, "You're making progress." He smirked just a bit, just enough for John to notice it.
"Not how you would expect him to be." John landed on.
John sighed and wrapped his arms tighter, "I don't know."
"Because you... Sherlock, you can't just-"
"Well, humans are also very inclined to lie."
"What's that mean?"
"You're alright then?" He asked, watching as Sherlock wrapped the covers back around him, still damp from his laying on them before he feel asleep.
John could feel the footsteps rumble across the hallway. Sherlock kissed his forehead before climbing under the sheets and behind John. Before John could decide whether or not he wanted to pretend to be asleep, his dad walked in.
He packed his things and left the next morning, before anyone was awake. He called Finn, knowing she always had a spare bed, and rode there in a cab.
"I trust you," He said.
Sherlock fell back next to him and John could feel his legs right next to his but not touching. Sherlock's feet almost touched the ground. Maybe his bed was too short. Maybe John was too short.
"You can go faster, ya know."
John laughed and rolled his eyes, "Alright, Superman."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock?" He got out between stalled breaths.
Sherlock was leaning ever closer, and he seemed to take up John's entire world, entire being. He was everything John could focus on, everything he wanted in that moment.
“But I don’t.”
John was still in the corner, his eyes flicking between the door and Sherlock.
Sherlock's eyebrows knitted together, "Why would I buy you dinner?"
"Stop saying that," I said calmly. All of my energy stores had been burnt, my chest almost burning from the effort to keep my ribs intact.
"Define alright." Sherlock mumbled.
"The room, alright?"
"Actually,
He had moved in with them after leaving the hospital. Not his first choice, (John wouldn't listen to his first choice) and he definitely wasn't comfortable with it.
John huffed playfully, "Yes, Sherlock," He reached up to light the end of Sherlock's cigarette.
He pulled John in close with an arm around his waist, "I think you just enjoy seeing me suffer."
"No?" The voice made a return, "What does work for you then?"
He stepped in. For a moment he didn't know what to do. Should he go upstairs and risk John finding him? Go farther in and risk Mrs. Hudson finding him? Or stay right there, frozen.
"You like it."
"Are you wanting me to do something?"
“Do you love her?" He asked without a pause.
"We didn't have a falling out. We just…" John shrugged. He didn't want to talk about it.
John chuckled, "It's just generally good."
"Yeah, we can go to a diner, get a couple-a milkshakes, I'll pay."
"You can't be so careless, Sherlock."
, I don't." Sherlock titled his head, an innocent smiling playing on his lips, "Thought you would realize that by now."
He picked up the receiver, and got all the way to putting it to his ear before setting it back down again. He sighed and tapped his fingers on his thigh.
Once the closet area looked a bit better, they both got up and John sighed.
"I don't like you."
John smiled.
Sherlock didn't quite open his mouth but it wasn't quite closed either and John could see a hint of his tongue poking out between his teeth. John scooted a bit closer.
Sherlock shrugged. John wanted to punch him.
"I feel kinda…tired." He said softly.
Sherlock cocked his head, "I would actually try and answer that, except it's probably for a reason I don't expect."
John chuckled and linked his arm with Sherlock's, the tension from before slipping off just a bit, "Do you really want to be something? You can say no."
"There wasn't a body to see."
I sat in my chair, crossing my legs. I wondered if I could still get away with sitting here all day. John sat down across from me with a soft sigh.
"Oh yeah, I forgot you're a little virgin."
"Walking in the rain for hours isn't your job either."
On one hand he felt terrible for not automatically saying yes. Of course he wanted Sherlock back, all the time, everyday, but on the other hand he knew that at this point it didn't matter what answer he gave. He could feel his resolve slipping like a mudslide, or an out of control spark, burning every "no" in his mind.
John wondered how he let himself think that this would last. They were teenagers, and they were
John's dad clicked his tongue and shook his head, "He ran away with some boy. Turns out he might be a fag." He  gave John a glance from over his shoulder, "Family's torn apart. It's real selfish what he did, don't you think?"
"Alright. If you wanna stay here, that's what we'll do."
"Exactly, so I should enjoy it."
"I'm not doing this. I'm not dealing with you like this." He moved to walk out the room.
Traces of Sherlock's tongue on his neck, hints on his jaw. He hoped marks wouldn’t be left, but in the back of his mind he wanted them to show. He wanted everyone to see what Sherlock Holmes did. How he claimed John, and how John wanted him to.
Sherlock was barely going over 60 as they drove. John looked at the road, then to Sherlock. He was biting his lip ever so slightly, just pulling on the inside of his mouth.
His room was also empty. And quiet. It would’ve been peaceful on any other day before this. The bed was made. Probably one of the last things John touched in the whole flat. I walked forward and sat on the edge. I had been in this bed so many times before. When John spent long nights at the local clinic when he dragged me upstairs to do nothing but fall asleep next to me. I had spent so many nights in here, and during all of them, I thought about all the reasons it was a bad idea, all the ways this could end in flames. I had spent so much time trying to convince John that this wasn't worth it, and now he wasn't here to argue with.
He was used to this bit. The part where he lied his ass off to get out of a situation he wanted to be in. He was used to isolating himself, telling himself it would be better if he left, because most of the time it was.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "I've said that before."
He took the tourniquet and wrapped it around his own arm. This was it, the ritual. Getting whoever was with him blasted, then focusing on himself. It had worked out for years, especially with Finn once they got more comfortable around each other.
John's head jerked towards me, "Sorry?"
"Sherlock."
"Have you done this before?" John asked breathily.
"Why not?"
Sherlock wanted to die.
Sherlock’s smile was of the devil, twisted and torn, but oh-so tempting. John couldn’t help but give in, breaking like weak clay at that smile.
"If you let me in."
“That was a lie. I lied.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I took a little time between writing this and editing it. I'll try and have the next one written and up soon, but I have no idea when that'll be since school is starting soon (and I have to catch up on my reading) and because I have three other WIPs I'm working on, but don't worry, I'm not gonna abandon this one, it just might take more time than I would like.
"As am I. Figure A being this conversation."
"Do you think you're gonna save me?" He asked, wincing at his own question. He could've built up to it, but why beat around the bush?
Apparently not that hard.
John shook his head, "I don't think so."
Sherlock wasn't in the hallways when John dashed between classes, and he wasn't there glaring John down at the front of the school either. In fact, John didn't see him all day.
“Not your concern.”
"You don't know? Fine, I'll tell you."
"Not over the phone." John agreed.
“Victor?”
“That one felt different.”
know about what's smart for you."
John blinked, "...Offering you coffee?"
“In the morning.”
“Well…” His gaze dropped, “That doesn’t really change things does it?”
John frowned, "The diner. Yesterday."
fucking lost it.
"You just want people to think that." Sherlock smirked at John, "You just want the path with the least explanation. You hate questions, but you like asking them."
"Greedy."
“Mycroft told me. Vaguely. Said you probably wouldn’t talk about him.”
"That doesn't make it your fault."
"Right,
“Wait here.” John said from outside the cab, and Sherlock did. He sat and watched John go in the house, his hands in his lap like a good little follower.
"I don't know about friends. That doesn't work out for me that often."
“I don’t think you should be talking. All you have are t-shirts and jeans.” John rolled his eyes.
Molly pursed her lips, as if deciding whether or not she was mad. After a moment she shook her head.
But all of those thoughts went away when he pushed the syringe down. Nothing even touched the cozy feeling wrapping around him.
John couldn’t get over that he had kissed a boy. Not just anyone, but
"We the only ones here?"
"Right. Not over the phone."
He attempted a smile, "Hey, John."
“I don’t. And like you know what’s good for me.” John muttered.
Sherlock shrugged, "Do whatever you want, just don't expect me to talk about it."
John couldn’t tell you how he felt about it. His only thought was the mouth now at his stomach. Tongue darting out, flicking, driving John crazy. There was ringing in his ears and he didn’t know if those sounds were from him or Sherlock.
“Let’s say that. Yes, Sherlock.”
"Oh." Sherlock looked up in thought, "If I'm honest, I couldn't tell you her name."
"Alright, then." John sighed.
“No, no,” Sherlock said quickly, “It felt like… more.”
John said she hadn’t taken everything, and she would probably be back, but it had been more than twelve hours, and everything was still quiet. Sherlock just felt on edge. At any point Mary could come back and tear this apart.
"To the hospital?"
His voice was soft when it interrupted the silence, "I came back."
“…I can-” Sherlock blinked, correcting himself, “I know that feeling. Not specifically, obviously, but that… Haunted feeling. I know what it’s like to have that follow you around. To have something follow you around.”
Why did John even care? It's not like they had a promise to tell each other everything that happens in their life, especially when John couldn't even get the courage to tell Sherlock about the main reason he went out with him to begin with.
"I like…learning. All I can."
Mycroft wasn't even sitting, just standing by Sherlock's bed, umbrella by his side, nose turned towards the fucking sky. Sherlock thought briefly about breaking said nose, letting blood drip onto his pressed suit, just to bring him back down to earth with the rest of the idiots.
John glared at him, "She isn't the only one, you know. The entire school wants to know what's behind Sherlock Holmes."
Mrs Hudson stopped asking me if I was okay during the third round of tea. She stopped asking if I would move or what I was thinking, she just brought the tea and went back downstairs. I think I had a sip once. My head was too fuzzy to remember. All I could remember was John’s face and how sure he sure he looked. His heroism finally landed him on concrete. Spread out like some common death. They didn’t even let me see him. Lestrade said he was trying to protect me.
John sighed heavily, "Fine. What do you suggest?"
"No. Not like that. I work for you, but you didn't hire me."
His sister used to tell him stories of when she went out with guys. (Years ago, when she still cared enough to talk to John.) She would come into his room on Friday night, right after a date, and tell John everything that was wrong with it. She always looked the same as usual (she never dressed up for a date, always said it was pointless. If the guy didn't like her when she dressed normal then he didn't like her at all.)
thank you all so much.
"You shouldn't do that."
“She’s not you.”
His heart stopped when he saw Sherlock, all long limbs and grey accents, sitting in his driveway.
"Do I?
"We could do that." John's eye were wide, and he felt like smiling.
"You are!" He was getting hysterical at this point. God, he hated when he did this. He could feel tears behind his eyes and sobs forming in his chest. He couldn't do this, not here, not now.
Sherlock shrugged, "Not lucky, just smart."
This kiss was softer than anything he had done with Sherlock. It was slow, and felt like
"So, breakfast?"
“Why not?” John asked his fingers finding a delicate path through Sherlock’s hair.
For a second John couldn't believe he said that out loud.
He sighed again and scratched his forehead.
"Think I should wait."
Sherlock drained him in a way that no one else had, and in a way he didn't notice until he had left, which was long after they made shapes on the ceiling. Sherlock kept John up practically  all night, asking him questions about
"Mycroft likes appearances, and I like proving points." Sherlock said, "Hell, I'd take you on this couch if the risk was worth the reward."
Maybe Sherlock shouldn't trust him.
"You have to check this shit. Christ."
John pulled back, "You're coming with me."
Sherlock sat up properly and crossed his legs, "You know, I'm not gonna shout this from the rooftops. "
“That’s not fair.”
“Like how you saw me? When we met?”
"People say that you two were doing something illegal."
His face was pressed into John's chest (John's idea), which Sherlock didn't mind, even though he smelled of wet cotton and sweat (And something else Sherlock couldn't quite place), and Sherlock probably should've asked him to take a shower, but it was awkward enough to be this close to a total stranger without accusing them of needing a shower.
Really it was easy, just one word, one syllable, three letters, and John would have him. He could take all he wanted from Sherlock if he stayed long enough, he could destroy him if he had the will. He could crush everything that was and is Sherlock Holmes with the right word, the right phrase, or the right body language.
"I liked it. You here."
John had said a lot of cons of dating her, but Sherlock couldn’t tell if he was being truthful or exaggerating to make Sherlock feel better. He could’ve easily left out something wonderful and beautiful that he was upset about leaving behind, but Sherlock tried to keep from going down that spiral. John wanted him around, for whatever reason, and Sherlock didn’t want to ruin that.
Sherlock smiled, then whispered, "Both."
"I think it's more than fine. I'm just curious."
"John." It came out breathy, like Sherlock had waited his entire life to say it and it took everything in him. John was close to crying.
“Your heart is racing, and your pupils are dilated.”
Sherlock leaned his head against the window sill (Are they still called that in cars? Is there a special car word for the threshold between the inside and outside of the car? Would anyone bother to even make that word?)
John woke up to the front door slamming shut. The moment he opened his eyes to see Sherlock he felt his stomach drop.
And trying to avoid John, pretend like he was a random person John found on the side of the street, was exhausting. Even if they weren't best friends, even if they weren't... Whatever they could be, it still hurt.
"You shrug a lot."
"Okay." He said softly and hung up the phone, before rushing to his closet.
But John didn't really want to.
Smoke fell out of his mouth.
Sherlock gave a small, slightly ambiguous nod, and John’s face lit up like a Christmas tree.
John hugged Sherlock's arm again, "Then don't worry about it. I'll tell you if you ever do something."
John didn’t know what he was doing. He knew that grass was under him, and Sherlock was on top of him, and Sherlock's eyes were burning brighter than he had ever seen. Hot breath lingered with his, and all he saw was pale skin and pink lips, and he was so close and so far from where he wanted to be.
"Saying my name is definitely gonna change my mind, John."
“Sherlock. We are in an alley waiting for a murderer, do you really want to bring this up?”
"It'll take five minutes." He shot him a glance, eyes wide and begging, "Please?"
“Go to sleep. I’ll still be here in the morning.”
John hummed and rubbed his thumb over Sherlock's hand, "Well, he must want you around then."
Sherlock wasn’t this fucking person. He was shit, sure; he was an asshole, definitely, but he didn’t go around and kiss people who were taken. He didn’t do this. He shouldn’t have done this.
John nodded.
John huffed. Both of them were getting irritated now, “Why not? Why can’t I? Since you know everything.”
He pulled Sherlock off him, who was just as out of breath as he was, and scrambled into a sitting position. Sherlock's eyes were almost black. John's probably were too.
speaking of hopes, hope they were fulfilled in this chapter.
“What, Sh-” Sherlock put a hand over John’s mouth. John’s eyes were wide. Sherlock’s were cool and collected. John was sure he was blushing. (Himself, not Sherlock. Sherlock never blushes.)(Though, now he was wondering what it would take to get Sherlock to blush.)
John nodded and kept his lips tight as they walked into school. Molly wouldn’t stop talking about him, never stopped talking about him, but John didn’t listen to a word. If anything he avoided Sherlock like the Plague, but no matter how hard he tried, John couldn’t get Sherlock's eyes out of his head. Burning a bright blue. The way he looked over everyone like he had seen this play a thousand times before. Like he had fucking wrote it. His gaze led to high, sharp cheekbones, befitting royal blood. Then, slightly parted, wet lips hinting at a twisted smirk, like he knew John, like he was an old friend, like he could be everything.
John laughed, and tried to think of a reason for there to be a wavy building, but Sherlock's features were much too distracting. Everything about his face was long and translucent, down to his eyelashes. His hair was even messier than usual, the blankets behind him doing little to hold them down as they still fell in all directions around his head.
"You came back. You came back, John," I said, my eyes on the rug in front of me.
Sherlock sucked in a breath free of cigarette smoke, "Did you enjoy it?" His head dropped to one side. He wasn't looking at John, "I mean, you certainly did in the moment, but do you regret it now?"
Sherlock gripped the steering wheel tighter, "You said you worried about me."
you?"
I saw Lestrade running towards me, but my vision was going too. Fading. Nothing felt real. This couldn't be real. I hated this. John should've been here. Everything was in slow motion. I was falling, but I didn't realize until I was on the ground. Until Lestrade was over me. I could hear whispers in the background, but they might've been yells. Nothing was working properly. My entire system had been compromised. John fucking Watson had ruined my entire system.
"I think…Well, I've spent more time with you than I initially thought I would, and all of that time doesn’t feel wasted, so…I think I like you too." Sherlock said, his voice barely a whisper towards the end.
John took his own moment to respond. He didn’t really know what he wanted. He played with the idea of this being real, but he knew it couldn't be. They could seriously get in trouble, someone could find out, or both of them could just end up hurt.
"I'm not. You sound tired."
John cleared his throat, “I don’t know.”
The kitchen table was messy, overflowing with half finished experiments. Sherlock could sit and pick up where he left off. He wondered what John would say if he came home and Sherlock was back at the table, focused on something John didn’t care to understand. He wondered if he would think it was real, or if he would be convinced he, himself, was dead, or possibly hallucinating.
"Yeah," John said, "The one I made you."
Sherlock hated being at yet another hotel. It was a little better with John behind him from the start, but he still had that pit in his stomach. He wanted to tell it to go fuck itself.
When John first woke up, still in that space where he wasn't sure if he was dreaming or actually awake, all he could feel was warmth. When he opened his eyes all he saw was Sherlock. His hair was in his face and his eyes were still shut, and John thought Sherlock looked odd while he slept. He felt like he was watching something he shouldn't have been.
John stared back at this man he was forced to call his father and for a brief second wondered if he actually cared. John knew he hadn't had the best life, but neither had John, and only one of them was at a bar all day.
The lump in John's throat was fully formed again and John could barely speak around it. Everything hurt again. How could Sherlock make him feel like this over and over again?
"That doesn't even make sense. Sure you're not already high?"
Sherlock tugged at the edges of his shirt as they walked in. He didn’t know how he should act.
"You fill your head with less important things."
John could smell the cigarette close to him before he heard Sherlock's voice, "It's my brother's. He never drives it."
He looked down, just for a flash of a moment, "Yes," he replied, his voice still soft, his eyes still dripping with empathy. He tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair, the now not empty chair, the now full chair with the person that should be sitting in the chair, "And because I would have to come back eventually. Mycroft wanted to wait. I didn't, neither did Greg, so... I came back." His words were almost tripping over each other. I was sure with a good wine and a few hours he would tell me all of the details anyway. I was sure this was him simply trying to be formal.
“But are you going to?”
John took the cigarette and rolled it in between his fingers, "I don't think that logic is sound."
His breath found it’s way to John’s ear, and he could feel the vague shape of Sherlock’s mouth as he spoke.
Because of course he was attracted to Sherlock. God, who
"Sherlock. We shouldn't be doing this."
a talented mouth. Cold, rough hands under his shirt and sharp edges cutting into him, threatening to tear him apart.
God, he hadn't even told Sherlock about the dare. Was it a dare really? It wasn't like it was important anyway. It's not like John could fake the whole relationship.
He shrugged.
John was next to him, giving him a once over every few moments. It's not like Sherlock was going duck and roll out the car, and if he did, a stern look from Mr. Army-Man wasn't going to stop him.
"Dodging or hurt."
John's eyes went wide. He didn't mean to say that, but now it was hanging in the air.
John leaned over and kissed his cheek. Mostly because he could.
“No- I'm... You act like it. Like I'm a rescue dog.” He said.
“Did-“ Sherlock bit his lip before he could finish the question.
“You are. You’re probably the cutest person I’ve ever met.”
He could still hear John and Mycroft bickering over him, (Felt funny, people talking about him while he was so close. He could answer all their questions.) but it felt like he was behind a wall. Wasn't sure what side each of them were on.
- was right there. Damn him.
He opened the door, dripping rain water onto the cheap carpet, and pulling a credit card (John's) out of his slipper, a bit wet, but no worse for wear. He pulled a strand of soaked hair out of his eyes and calmly asked for a room, ignoring the look on the host's face.
"And when you're not?"
"You're the one who left, Sherlock!" John snapped, "You're the one who shut the door, you're the one who didn't come back. Yes, I was a jerk, but I didn't want you to leave."
“Can we stay here? Just for today.”
"You see plenty."
could move mountains at that point.
How was he supposed to resist that?
"You're awful."
Sherlock didn't want to leave. He wanted this, whatever it was, to stay put. He kept the covers over his head, willing himself to go back to sleep.
"You should've let me handle it!" I yelled and I swore I could hear birds take flight, "You should've let me..." I shook my head and stared into my lap. I hated this. I felt like every piece of my chest was being picked apart, like I was laid out for John to play with. He had complete control over my emotions for the past 24 hours and now that he was back, despite everything being different, nothing had changed. He could still press all my buttons, push tears to the back of my eyes, make my heart and hands tremble. He was still in control of every aspect of me. He always had been, and I was sick of it.
John pursed his lips. He was gonna get wrinkles, just from Sherlock.
Lestrade said something, but I couldn't retain it. I ended up in one of the interrogation rooms with him. I sat against the wall with my legs pulled up to my chest and he was saying something about 'understanding what you're going through' and I laughed. I think I laughed. Because it was ridiculous. He didn't—He couldn't. He couldn't understand. John had left. John was gone. John was in a morgue somewhere, and I couldn't see his body. I couldn't see him. Every memory I had, from seeing John for the first time, to seeing him on top of that building, all of it was flashing by me. I felt like I was losing them too. I had lost everything. John was everything. And he was alone in a morgue somewhere. Lestrade couldn't understand that.
"Fine. I'll give you my number, yeah? Call me if you end up in a ditch somewhere."
I sighed. Then got up. One good hit was all it took for the violin to splinter, but I hit it again against the side of his chair. The deathly empty fucking chair. The sound was awful, but I didn’t care. I think I yelled. I must’ve. Mrs Hudson was rushing up the stairs, standing in the doorway, her hand over her mouth. I dropped the neck of the violin on the floor and didn’t look at her as I went upstairs.
"Well, I can't exactly see into the future."
John walked up behind him and stood on his tiptoes to look over Sherlock’s shoulder.
That seemed to shut Sherlock up. He stared into his lap, and took his time coming up with a response, every second feeling longer than the last.
Sherlock grumbled, lifting his head weakly. He caught a glimpse of a pale sweater and blonde hair and had to keep himself from laughing.
“I know.”
“Please, what? Please, touch you? Please, leave bruises and marks and
John shrugged, "I think it is. I'm gonna regret a lot, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn't do anything."
"I won't bite." John said, a slight grin on his face. He looked tired, his hair messy, his eyes heavy. Sherlock almost felt bad for leaving. Almost.
"You're very good at dodging."
Sherlock turned away and leaned his head back on his pillows. He had gotten John's jacket around him at some point. It was irritatingly musty, wrinkly, and just a tad too wide and too short. He wrapped it tighter around him.
"Partly," Sherlock said, his honesty forced.
gonna be a lot slower updating this at this rate. will prolly be more productive on the weekends than weekdays, we'll see. i know it's a short chapter, but i wanted to update tonight. hope you enjoyed. x
John shook his head.
"No."
Maybe it was the ritual that was the most intriguing. Getting everything ready, getting in place, and shooting. Sherlock always found rituals relaxing. Made him felt balanced, more in control. The actual high was a bonus, that perfect level, and trying to get it over and over, that was really what kept him coming back.
"Okay, Brains. Go on."
Sherlock pulled the blankets back, dark curls poking over off-white sheets, "Why?"
"If you're a jerk, then I'm a complete ass.."
"We should sleep."
Sherlock stayed still for a moment. He couldn't be that bad, right? He wouldn’t hurt Sherlock, Mycroft probably ensured that. He rolled out of the bed and went to open the door, keeping the dead bolt chained and looking at John through the crack.
"She seems like the prying type."
His eyebrows always seemed to be furrowed or raised. He was always pouting or indignant. Black or white. Really, Sherlock was full of contradictions.
"So, she knows about this?"
"I…I was just rambling- I don't- I mean-"
Sherlock felt a bit silly being this clingy, but he enjoyed how John's arms wrapped around him and how he could still smell the rain on his skin. Something about it felt perfectly in place, like this is where Sherlock was supposed to be, how he was supposed to be. Maybe it didn't matter that John was a stranger. Maybe this feeling, this comfort, transcended relationships.
“It’s exhausting.” John said.
He looked up and John’s eyes held too much to stay away from. He pushed forward and…
No. He wasn't. He was busy focusing on the people who had just walked in: a tall, blonde paper shaker with long legs and a short skirt, dangling on the arm of an even taller Sherlock Holmes.
John sighed, sitting on the foot of the bed, "Are you ever planning on going back?"
"When?"
Sherlock nodded, “Then, thank you. I don’t think anyone’s ever…done something like this for me.” He said, picking up a fork.
"We can get ribbons for your hair too."
"I…Um, I got your number. Obviously." He sighed and looked down, "I don't know what to say…"
"Is yours better?"
Sherlock dropped his cigarette, "I don't mind that it's difficult, or I wouldn't if it was only me that was affected."
Sherlock sighed and sat up, meeting John's eyes, "I don't count the paper shakers and soc's."
It was a common thing, someone getting the wrong purity and accidently shooting up with something 20% more pure than what you're used to, and winding up fucked up beyond repair. Finn sometimes teased him about how careful he was about what he got his hands on, but if the whole thing was about control, why wouldn't he be?
John was as good as the sun, in Sherlock’s opinion. Just as bright, just as warm. He could hide with John in these cold months and be just fine. He wanted that. Those soft domestic moments where this was all routine. Maybe not even with John, but… Sherlock wouldn’t mind.
John huffed heavily, almost as if to push Sherlock back with his breath.
"Don't you usually want me to go once it gets this late?"
"Apparently, you do." He went to walk out the room, "He's all yours." He said to someone outside the door.
"Take a chill pill, no one pays that much attention, anyway."
"Would you tell me if I do something shitty?" He asked.
Sherlock sighed and ran his hand along John's thigh, "I
He had a girlfriend.
He locked his eyes on me. They were soft, almost melting with the amount of pity behind them. "I can't, Sherlock. You know I can't."
“Will do.”
Sherlock responded more instinctively than he should've, "What do you mean?"
He wanted to walk in and for everything to go back to normal. It would be so much easier.
"You've done plenty you shouldn't've."
Sherlock stayed still. The man- John –was relaxing around him. How did he do that?
“I mean… I can’t.” He couldn’t take Sherlock's glare. John stared down at the space between them, at the negative space, only filled by wind and tension.
"How would you have reacted if I was the one that jumped?"
"So, tell me. What do you see, John?"
John shook his head, "Not here to tell you about me."
Sherlock's rainbow colored eyes thinned, "Interesting."
John shook his head and sat next to him, looking up at the sky.
Sherlock hummed and moved a bit closer, not yet kissing him, “Please?”
John's mouth fell open, but his throat didn’t let the words out. What was he supposed to say? He had class and plans after. He had a life that Sherlock seemed sure to drag into the light and set aflame.
Sherlock rose out of the drivers seat with ease and strolled over to John in a black shirt and black washed jeans.
"I thought you were gonna kick me out! Sorry that I wasn't thinking about your fucking-! Oh, Mycroft. Yeah, hello."
Sherlock sucked in a breath, "Dad's a drunk, Ma's a pushover. A situation you're slightly familiar with."
"Good." He walked around and slid beside John, his arm resting on the top of the seat, not quite around John. Half of John wanted to tell Sherlock to put his arm down, the other half wanted Sherlock to pull him close.
Sherlock looked down at the same spot, “Well… I should thank you, yes?”
"Uh h-hi. Hey, Sherlock." He forced out, expecting Sherlock to hang up. Instead there was a long silence full of static and the worst scenarios John could come up with.
hello, chapters are gonna be a bit slow as my laptop is out so service at the morning. hoping to get a new one soon, and i’ll still be working on this when i can on my phone, but don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up.
The man squinted, "Are you gonna tell me how you do that or should I assume you're a mind reader?"
John had never been to a drive-in with a girl, but that doesn't mean he was oblivious to the petting going on around him in backseats of the dim cars. He had thought about asking some plastic doll, paper shaker, out and bringing her here. But not only did he tear himself apart long before asking her out, he also didn't care enough to actually do it. The only reason he would was to say he had.
"No?"
“Why not? What’s wrong with my house?”
John nodded loosely, “Let’s hope.”
Sherlock chuckled softly. He sat across from John and stared into space for a second, chewing on his lip.
This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. I knew that. All of this— all of it— could’ve gone so much different. John wanted to be a hero. I knew he was planning something, I knew he was trying to be the hero. I should’ve tried to stop him, confronted him, done something. He would’ve listened to me. This wasn’t supposed to happen.
“We have a few minutes and I'm curious.”
"Which is why I should stop now."
A sudden heaviness dropped into Sherlock's heart, "I know."
"You're rather full of yourself."
Pure fucking bliss.
"I don't know what to tell you."
Sherlock hated how he said his name. He wanted to burn his tongue so he would never say it again.
"Damn what people say!" John threw his hands in the air, the thin crowd in homeroom all turning to stare at him.
"You want to get out of what you think is a shitty life at times, but at the same time you know you shouldn't complain. You don't know how to actually care for someone, or what it feels like to fall for someone. You probably think I'm gonna leave you whenever I 'get what I want.' I assure you, John, I won't."
"Is it that bad at home, or are you just looking for anyway to get out and I'm the best choice?" John whispered. It came out harsher than he wanted.
"So you're the harder option?"
"Well, sometimes you're an ass."
"Must be fun."
"I don't want to leave." He said finally.
"Or realistic."
. Yes, he wanted all of that. He could feel his breath quicken at the words, at the hot breath in his ear, whispering and kissing, and before John could push him away again, Sherlock’s hands were under his shirt and John’s were in his hair. Pale flesh seen through a mess of dark curls, and John gave in under him. He didn’t let Sherlock’s hands go lower than his waist, nor his mouth lower than his neck, but just a tiny bit of him broke free on that grass.
"For being a jerk." John replied, staring out the window.
John shook his head.
Sherlock pushed his face into John's shoulder, "And are okay being this close?"
"Are you gonna make me go back?"
His fingers dragged along the railing, the dust sticking to his hands. He didn't bother to wipe it off.
"Because…" He bit his lip, "I don't care about them. Rather, I'm not that interested in them."
Sherlock winced, but kept going,
Sherlock.
Now there were tubes in his arms, injecting things he had no interest in.
?" Mycroft's voice was rising now, "Do you think this a walk in the park, Sherlock? Do you think I like any of this?"
“Sherlock.”
"To berate you on how you decorate your room."
"Alright?"
John laughed and kissed his cheek, “We’re really doing this, aren’t we?”
"Lots of reasons , John."
Sherlock shrugged and dug into his pocket again. It could go well, or it could be something they end up regretting. He knew this is what being a teenager was for, mistakes and finding yourself in relationships you tell your future spouse about. He knew that John didn't mean any harm, but the only thing he could think of was all the things that had gone wrong before. For both of them.
"I think I like you." John said quietly. He knew he liked Sherlock, he knew he wanted him at this point, but just saying it felt like something bigger than when it was just in his head. Saying it made it feel real, like this could actually be something.
"One more thing."
"Listen, I wasn't really thinking of that when I found you." He said, dialing.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Like
Everything was so new. Lips on his, hands in his hair, fresh marks on his neck, all by a guy. It made his mind stop dead in it’s tracks.
"Christ. I'm not trying to fight with you. I don't tell her anything. I don't
"You say you aren't attracted to me," Sherlock cut in, "but you're showing clear signs that you are." Sherlock's head fell to the side and John could see all the muscles in his neck.
"So, then, does that make you more human than you like to think?"
"For the slim chance of not having to hide? For the slim chance of being just another couple, overlooking the fact that we could break up at any point? Overlooking the fact that we won't be normal no matter where we go, John."
He dropped face down on his bed the moment he got in the door. God, he was tired. He could fall asleep right now…
Sherlock cocked his head, expecting John to elaborate.
But John's chair was empty. Tragically so.
He stared at the dark, making his breath as sparse at possible. He knew Mycroft would most likely find him at some point, probably put him back in the hospital with an exhausted sigh and give him another lecture, before leaving him with a stranger, but Sherlock still felt a knot in his stomach, which grew as another knock on the door bounced around the room.
John smirked, "But I don't think I mind."
"Hm." John reached up and snatched his cigarette, "You know, James Dean's real cool."
Sherlock's face was mostly blank, but there was a slight dip in eyebrows and a slight turn in his lips that John couldn't help but notice.
He had to get him out. He had to stop this before he got too involved. He had to--
"Man, do you love those."
John bit his lip, "He's…"
"Is that supposed to make me feel guilty?"
John looked at him for a moment before swinging his leg over Sherlock and sitting in his lap. Sherlock just stared at him, cigarette dangling out his mouth and a trace amount of a smirk on his face.
He felt better now that he had taken a detour. In balance, almost. He closed his eyes and let his thoughts swim in and out freely. He didn't know why everyone was so upset. He wasn't stupid. He wasn't going to try and overdose
been like at this point.
"You're looking at my lips." John said even though he was looking at Sherlock's too. He wondered how they could fit so well with John's, how it was even possible for them to make John's heart race and blood pressure spike.
"Why?"
"Does it work?" He smiled back just as wide.
Then someone who wasn't John, cleared their throat.
He chuckled, "You're an ass."
He was studying him. Trying to see how he worked. it's the same way he looked at a crime scene. He was trying to fit the pieces together. Sherlock should know how he works by now after six years.
"I have a question." John whispered.
John stared at the ceiling, but could still see Sherlock smiling out of the corner of his eye.
"Now, I'm really flattered."
John was much too kind. He had gone back into full caretaker mode, reminding him of what it was like living with him when Mary was still around.
John felt something larger than anger build up under his ribcage. Sherlock shouldn't be looking at anyone like that, but him. That girl didn't know anything about Sherlock. She didn't know what it was like to be destroyed by him from the inside out. She didn't know what it was like to look over and see a rare, wide, grin coming from Sherlock.
He got out to see Sherlock slumped against the courtyard wall, with George the anatomy teacher towering over him. Sandra was nowhere to be seen. Sherlock saw John first and widened her eyes in a silent warning.
He was suddenly reminded of that one time he went to Confession after he came back from the war. It was the same need to confess, to absolve himself from his sins. To submit his soul to a higher power and subjugate his fate entirely to its judgement.
After yesterday’s kiss, Sherlock had dropped all pretense and went back to his cold machine self and left an electric tension in the air. John should have known Sherlock couldn’t handle romantic acts, even if these were for a case and not genuine acts of love. No, Sherlock was very much married to his work. Why had John even attempted to presume otherwise?
The primary suspect were the Nobel prize nominees who replaced Ferdinand van Brugel. They were a duo of Dr. Louise Lacroix, a tall blonde woman and Dr. Adèle Dupont, a shorter dark-haired woman. Both women were accomplished scientists and doctors who had revolutionized the field of neuroscience and psychiatry. They had discovered a new way of tweaking the brain’s chemistry which was more effective than existing medication.
He came back with two cups and handed one to Sherlock who was now in a reclined sitting position on the bed. Their fingers brushed, Sherlock hummed a thanks and John had to cough to clear his throat. They drank their tea in a companionable silence.
“All right ladies and gentlemen, please calm down. I need to make some introductions first.” George made an exaggerated wink at the class. That earned him some laughs.
Sherlock let out a small, heartbreaking sob and then nodded fervently.
“Also your sister Harry Watson? Her pretty ex-wife Clara is one of my exes. I always say the ex of my ex is my friend. The lesbian world is tiny, I tell you!” Maria exclaimed with a wink.
“I thought you’d be happy to not have my daughter barging into your experiments!” John exclaimed, running a hand though his hair. Really, he had gone through this decision with everyone including his sister, debated with himself for the past 4 weeks, explored every scenario…and Sherlock was the one to complain?
Cynthia the ER anesthesiologist looked at John, surprised. She did as he asked.
The air between them was still tense the next morning. John supposed the only reason he fell back to sleep so fast was because Sherlock’s revelations sapped him of all the little energy he had left after his nightmare.
Then he felt the pain shoot up his hand up towards his bad shoulder. It was like reaching the surface after plunging in icy cold water. Everything gradually sped up.
The kiss was so simple yet so tender, John forgot how to breathe, how to think. When the kiss broke, Sherlock moved his lips in for another. And another. And another. And John moved in for one more. The years of longing would to the casual observer go unnoticed, but it was there, all-consuming, lighting a flame between them that could never be extinguished.
Sherlock and John have dinner/double date with a lesbian couple. John has a hard time.
Sherlock’s voice broke and his hands started trembling furiously.
John entered the autopsy theatre with his fellow students. A lot of the doctor students were excited about this lesson as they wanted to hone their skills in cricothyrotomy, a life-saving emergency operation for extremely acute situations. This was why it was called the emergency airway puncture. Most students were doctors who worked in hospitals with access to more sophisticated equipment and medical competence. This was field work, which was why many very competent trauma doctors and surgeons had never performed this particular operation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Because yes, John had been counting. He knew Sherlock had been too. Of course, he had. Trust Sherlock to treat killing himself as some kind of experiment.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry for storming off. I was angry but as you said we need to work this case together if we want to solve it and prevent more murders. Which is what we do -- you and I. This is what we do, and we were good at it too, before you—” John had to stop there to swallow, “Before you – left. We haven’t been on cases where we had to pretend to be a couple before and I’ve never been to Norway before, but we have done so many other things this won’t even be the most ridiculous. You in that sheet at Buckingham palace will always be more ridiculous. So that's that. I'm coming.”
John replied in assent, inexplicably feeling something was off. Sherlock was looking slightly surly. He realized belatedly that Sherlock meant he was going back to Mary and not to Baker Street. It did make sense but it felt horribly wrong. John decided what he had to do. He had to call Mary and explain.
That wall had seen a lot of beautiful times between them. Sherlock liked reminiscing about when he and John laughed after the cabbie case and joked about invading Afghanistan. That had been their first case together. John had forsaken his cane and killed a man for him that night. He was so radiant when he laughed. Sherlock wondered what went wrong along the way.
"Yeah that--is true. Yeah. Sometimes i just--need to see the exit, because then there was no way out back then...But you're wrong about the girlfriends, I loved them and that's why i let them choose!"
The word burned through John. He knew he shouldn’t be made to feel ashamed by a man who’s incapacitated and handcuffed by the police, but he couldn’t help but feel that put a damper on the joy of the case. Being insulted in front of his peers hurt even more, even if he thought they seemed to find their fake relationship was romantic.
“I wanted to thank you for keeping me safe and apologize for the way I treated you when you came back,” John said solemnly.
“Christ Sherlock,” John said firmly but more quietly, “please let me speak.”
John groaned, his phone was in his jacket by his desk. He’d had to leave it behind when putting on his protective gear. Once the buzzing stopped his phone pinged. Sherlock never called, he texted. And nobody else ever contacted John. That meant Sherlock was in danger! John drew down his face mask.
John huffed again, except he seemed to be half laughing during it. Sherlock felt himself smile. Sherlock started explaining his findings to John, who nodded and asked relevant questions at the appropriate times. Nobody could be excluded as a suspect, not even the royal family who was attending the banquet. Even Mycroft could have been a suspect – had we not attended in his place, Sherlock explained. The killer was smart and ambitious, maybe wanted recognition of some kind. The clever ones are always so desperate to get caught, which always made the cases extra exciting.
John stood at attention, his mask still on. Sherlock fixed him with his intense gaze.
John was positive Sherlock wanted to gouge her eyes out, but Sherlock was smiling a smile that looked alarmingly sincere. Did Sherlock see something in her he did not? Cynthia got herself under control and went back to looking like competent doctor. The quick change from awkward fangirl to professional anesthesiologist was baffling.
Sherlock’s head leaned in closer to John’s, his hand reaching towards John’s face.
Cynthia and Maria shared a look. Maria explained she had met a patient who had been in a Chinese internment camp and couldn’t disclose what had happened to him there. The reason was because he was mute and did not know British Sign Language.
John looked pensive but did not reply. Sherlock looked pointedly in his direction. John seemed to get the hint and cleared his throat.
John blushed before joining in on Maria’s booming laughter. It felt good to let it out.
“Can you tell us about what happened last time you performed this operation? You said you were on the field, what did you use then?” Dr Kelley enquired with a glow in her eyes.
Sherlock took John’s hand and guided him back to bed. He jumped onto the bed next to John and slipped under the covers, holding their fingers entertwined under the blanket.
At least John had come back, Sherlock reminded himself. John was back with his warm oatmeal-coloured jumper and his comforting compact stance and his lovely scent of sandalwood and Earl grey tea. John had not forgotten him.
“But you –”
“You freak! What did you do to Sandra! Answer me!” shouted George. He had a knife in his hand, pointing it towards Sherlock.
“A dinner date?! Thanks for informing me!” John shouted out irritably.
As he was shaving, he realized two things that irked him. One: Sherlock was always dressed nowadays and did not strut around in a sheet like he used to. He had become very modest since he came back. Two: the flat smelled of scrambled eggs and pancakes, which meant Sherlock was going to put up that overly polite and courteous act that was so unnerving.
Unfortunately, Lestrade was around today. The strictest of his minders. John was strict with the drugs, but he had a soft spot for Sherlock’s antics, and was also ashamed of his behavior in the morgue. Mycroft might be strict with Sherlock, but he did not have the time to hang around babysitting and at least wasn’t dull. Mrs. Hudson sneaked herbal soothers in herself. Molly? Let me laugh.
Sherlock was stacking up pancakes onto a plate. He nodded at John and said: “Good morning John! Breakfast is ready, strawberry jam is on the table.”
Even if Sherlock would not be forgiven, he could try to make John happy. John’s happiness sometimes (more rarely these days) elicited a smile, which would warm the emptiness inside Sherlock for a second. Sherlock would then store that smile into his mind palace to review at leisure and glean out as much pleasure as he could out of it.
So it was not homophobia, they thought Sherlock barging in was
John raised his eyebrows with a grunt but ended up going about the familiar routine of unpacking his suitcase. Sherlock watched him closely, admiring not for the first time how John was trying so hard at normality despite all that had happened over the years. It was comforting. Sherlock often considered comfort a concept for the simple-minded, but it was true that it could be useful at times. This case required a great deal of poise to observe social graces. Sherlock was an expert behind the theory of social etiquette but still struggled in the practical application. John Watson was the perfect companion for this case in that respect. He was also the perfect companion full stop, but he should not linger in these dangerous thoughts.
And John was off.
“Sherlock – you know this is hard for me. This kind of stuff. It’s – it’s fucked up. It’s all a mess. I’m seeing Ella for it and I swear I’m trying. Just – please don’t blame yourself.”
But then there was silence.
…………………………………………………………………………………..
“Whatever remains must be the truth.” John completed his sentence.
John checked the GPS on his phone and ran towards St John’s College. There was Sherlock, back turned against him, facing the water.
They finally talk and there is fluff
John cleared the bleariness from his eyes and the soggy taste in his mouth. He hadn’t brushed his teeth.
After that breakfast and John’s stilted comments about his repressed emotions, things had gone back to the hateful distance and awkwardness between them. John was still going to regular therapy and coming back grumpy every time. John was going to the gym a lot, presumably using the punching bag and pretending it was Sherlock. John had also been to Lestrade and Molly’s and presumably made a lot of tedious small talk to convey how grateful he was for them and their taking care of baby Watson. Rosie. He could not call her Watson anymore, Sherlock reminded himself.
“What’s the occasion?” John chuckled nervously.
“Sweden, not Norway,” Sherlock announced when he had regained his voice.
And his mind was not as reliable as it used to be, since his time away…He had not even seen Mary coming. He had done so much, endured so much for the safety and happiness of the man in front of him. John knew nothing of this and it was better it stayed that way. He’d been hurt, he’d been broken, he’d been tortured. He had killed. He had starved. He had even tortured his own torturers and enjoyed it at the time.
“Oh come on John, I’m a uni student, I must dress the part! Besides, we have lab work today, wouldn’t want to mess up my shirts.”
As if on cue, his mobile phone started buzzing.
Sherlock nodded, “It is. Which is a good thing for you George, had John been killed you wouldn’t have left this room alive!”
“Wha-at was that about?” John asked, head buzzing.
“A pleasure to meet you, Mister Watson, Sherlock has been talking about your medical expertise quite a bit,” the professor said.
“You mean you two were going together as family. I’m not family,” John pointed out.
“Sandra?”
“I did it to keep you safe,” Sherlock whispered.
John looked affronted and not at all amused by the statement, despite Sherlock's contrived wink.
John was taken aback by this statement. What could Sherlock be having nightmares about? He hadn’t been in war and hadn’t witnessed his best friend die. He kept an expectant gaze on Sherlock, hoping for an explanation.
“Well, that was so easy you could have done it,” John said.
John savored the moment. Things were far from okay, but his friendship with Sherlock felt less like something irretrievable and more of something to strive for.
John mouth twitched into a smile and soon he was giggling along with Sherlock. To think he would have so many more bright moments like these, and that he had been given this gift to savour so thoroughly and extensively, was enough to humble any man. If he was lucky, he could have this for years, for the rest of his days if he wanted. The prospect of such a sunny future made him giddy with happiness and from the glee in Sherlock’s eyes, it made Sherlock feel the same.
“Is it cowardly? That I explained it on the phone?” John whispered brokenly to Sherlock.
“Yeah, Chinese sounds good,” John grinned. They both laughed.
Sherlock runs off in the pouring rain. Warning for mentions of torture.
When he got out of the shower, he noticed Sherlock was awake, but keeping his eyes closed. He would probably stay like that until the alarm clock rang.
John let out a relieved sigh.
This fic has a few chapters left, we need to get to the Johnlock fluff!
Operation initiated, muttered John Watson to himself.
“I’m calling off the wedding,” John announced.
“Okay. We keep the charade going. For justice,” John said with determination.
John suddenly felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.
John did not seem too happy at the prospect, his foot tapping the ground.
Sorry guys for not making it more Johnlock-y after such a long absence (more than a year!) but we need to get through this in order to get to the good stuff! Thank you for your support!
“So now we’ve gone through premises and autopsy protocol, I will need a volunteer to demonstrate! John Watson? Will you come up?” George asked with a sly smile.
Time for bed! Sherlock deduces stuff and John has angst.
“Sir, what equipment do I have at my disposal?” John asked casually.
At breakfast, John and Sherlock sat opposite each other at a long cafeteria table. Sherlock blended right in with the students, hunched over in his hoodie. John felt very old suddenly surrounded by these youths.
Which was a very intimate moment. Which they had shared in public. Oh god, what if Sherlock actually returned John’s feelings? No, he couldn’t tumble down that trail, Sherlock was a very good actor, he wasn’t at all interested in romance with anyone. Least of all him.
Time to put on the act
John woke up at around noon facing Sherlock with his legs wrapped around his partner’s. Yes, John could say partner now, in all senses of the word. That was a disconcerting but rather pleasing thought.
"Oh yeah? Go on then genius, tell me about my 'preferences'!" John replied irritably, mimicking air quotations.
John huffed, “So you know about him but you didn’t even know about the Queen of our own country!”
He remembered their eyes, their hands, the blood seeping out of their neck, their arms, his arms, his neck, his thighs. He remembers the crack of the whip, the clink of glass shards, the hissing cigarette butts…
“Sherlock!” John interrupted, scandalized. These were his colleagues: quite ditzy colleagues but his colleagues nevertheless.
“All right, I’m just wondering just how public our marriage is going to be, seeing as we are so central and we are hardly anonymous anymore. What if my fake wedding to you gets leaked in the press? What then?”
John was standing over Alicia the dead victim, and realized he could not let George in on that he knew who he was dissecting.
John had come back to Baker Street with Rosie. It was ridiculous that he trusted Sherlock enough to let his own child with a drug addict, particularly one who had last shot up 18 days ago.
His heart had already skipped a beat at dinner when Sherlock’s long fingers traced his own over the table at the canteen table over dinner. He did not wish to be carried away again. John was worried he would end up touching the detective while asleep and Sherlock would figure out --as he always does—that his relationship act was an actual desire on his part. Sherlock, who abhorred sentiment, would never look at him in the eye again. No, it was better he stayed to his side of the bed.
Sherlock slowly peeled off his tailored shirt with stiffly controlled movements.
“I – I’ve been having a hard time accepting that I’m – I’m bisexual. I’m not out and our relationship is still pretty much a secret. Sherlock is okay with it but I’m terrified. Coming out did not go so well for my sister Harry and – and I’m scared to go that path. I’ve always done as was expected of me so this is a big step,” John explained.
They both fell in a fit of giggles.
John had evidently needed some comfort from his wife to dull the sharp edge his freak of a flat mate made of his life. A brisk walk through the rain and some sweet words had not been enough. Sex, apparently, had done the trick. Sherlock felt a strange bout of nausea looming in. His brain’s constant lookout for clues was unbearable at times.
. That was a first. But John ended up smiling. It actually was the sort of thing Sherlock would do, he loved getting John’s attention and would probably ache to see John cutting up a body. And that was weirdly sort of cute. He hoped nobody could see him blush.
“You’re seeing that librarian woman.” Sherlock gasped the first deduction he could.
John walked up to George and Sherlock, seeing George tense and press the knife further to reveal a drop of blood.
Cynthia turned to Sherlock, who merely nodded, encouraging her to continue.
“You are clean shaven: you wanted to make a good impression at the restaurant. You have bags under your eyes: haven’t slept, but that isn’t too difficult to deduce given that it is 4AM at present. You are in your pajamas that Mary finds ugly but fit you rather well. You keep swallowing and clearing your throat because you didn’t brush your teeth last night. You are smiling rather fondly at me, probably due to lack of sleep, but also because you enjoy watching me at my deductions,” Sherlock deduced. He then started looking around the room.
Sherlock however seemed to enjoy it a great deal, and languidly stretched the way a feline would. Being so graceful so early in the morning should be considered a crime, John thought.
For now he was allowed to gaze at Sherlock all night long. If he wanted to. If he allowed himself to. If he did not lose all sense of self control. But he should not get used to it. He had to seize this moment and then let it go. And he could not bear to think of it.
“How romantic!” Cynthia exclaimed, making everyone laugh.
The voice in his head thundered. John was a much happier person before Everything. And Everything bad had happened because of Sherlock. He did not know how to fix this. John had not forgiven him. Maybe Sherlock was beyond forgiveness.
Sherlock had just explained his scheme and was quite pleased with it (though admittedly it was the only logical option available). However John apparently needed more to be persuaded. Sherlock wondered if John's neurons were rattled, or even awake for that matter.
Sorry about the explicit nature of last chapter. This is not a rape recovery fic. I've had a similar talk about trauma with a friend lately and this was therapeutic for me. My intention was not to dismiss or cheapen the story of any survivor of rape or abuse. I just found it unfortunately very plausible given the insistence surrounding Sherlock's virginity on the show and Moriarty would definitely use his pressure points.
“What do you mean, my bedroom?” John coaxed, slowly shifting closer to Sherlock, “You have a bedroom.”
“You did it to save me?” John asked, incredulous.
“Yes, well now with her gone and out of the way, we can focus on more important matters! We can go on cases again! Chase some criminals! Where is my blogger when I need him? I know you still have the Sig in your bedside drawer. Not very wise of you, considering a child was sleeping there mere days ago, but it just goes to show you like danger and need some excitement!”
Sherlock smiled that very rare smile that seemed reserved for John. John did not know how he was worthy of that honor of his special place in Sherlock Holmes’s life, but he thanked his lucky stars every day for it.
“John if you actually talked to your precious fiancée you’d have realized she is perfectly okay with the case!” Sherlock said--and added as an afterthought: “And I’m fine with being hypothetically cheated on, if that makes you feel any better.”
They reached the train platform just in time after being delayed by several rounds of kissing (thoroughly fascinating John!). They had a booth themselves.
“I’d say it was most efficient. You will now be able to move back to Baker Street directly and without hesitation,” Sherlock concluded.
out like you were dinner!”
"Sherlock knew talking was not their best point, and John had performed admirably. It was brilliant. John was brilliant. He had restored order and peace in the universe."
John Watson with Sherlock
The room seemed buzzing with energy. Everybody was eager to get to that part.
“You’re doing great. I’m very lucky,” Sherlock murmured softly. His eyes were downcast towards their linked hands. John shuddered but tried to stay calm as his heart fluttered.
But it was also a trick to rid his mind of his nightmares. He had not had nightmares now, but tantalizing visions of himself sleeping with Sherlock he’d rather scrub right off before the roots grew like weeds. He got dressed and tried rubbing off the indelible circles under his eyes.
Sherlock was snoring softly, his face relaxed by sleep. He was sleeping on his stomach and had a curl of hair moving back and forth in time with his exhales. John was suddenly absurdly grateful that Sherlock did not sleep on his back and that must have spared him pain these past months.
The guilt was eating up at his insides like he was a particularly gruesome corpse.
John was both irritated at the disturbance and feeling a wave of affection bloom in his chest. This man was going to kill him one day. Between dangerous cases, faking his death and his quirky lifestyle, Sherlock had turned his life around, both good and bad.
“What about Mary?” Sherlock asked in a raw voice.
“Yes John, much worse. Do keep up!” Sherlock replied with a smug grin.
…………………………………………………………………
“Okay…But how many years are supposed to be between us, as a couple?”
John went towards the kitchen to enquire about the case. The chef knew nothing, but the dishwasher said the blonde waitress (whose name was Sandra) had been in a couple with the deceased med student Alicia, before being with George the anatomy teacher. He said she was grieving her, and very out of sorts, but had told him she was trying to move on with a man. He said Alicia had died together with her boyfriend. Sandra was devastated about Alicia’s death, but secretly glad the boyfriend had died as well so she didn’t have to face him for Alicia’s cheating with her. She decided to move with George the anatomy teacher but did not seem really happy with him.
A heavy-set woman next to Cynthia piped up. She had a look of admiration on her face. Her nametag read
John’s heart finally broke. God knows what Sherlock was dreaming of. But John was part of it. He was important enough to even be any part of his life, even if it was only to buy milk or give him a pen during his mind palace sessions. He was somehow present in Sherlock’s life. He was so lucky, and now his contact with the extraordinary man would all be reduced to occasional visits together with his wife.
John could barely hear it, had he misheard? The softness in Sherlock’s voice made John’s heart skip a beat. John spun slowly around to find Sherlock eyes down, standing awkwardly with his hands fidgeting with the right sleeve of his dressing gown.
“I had a nightmare too, John. I understand.”
John was awoken by a loud snore of Sherlock’s. Sherlock had taken over most of the bed, and most of the covers, which left John freezing in a corner. Well, that was to be expected from such a self-absorbed man as Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head sadly as a tear rolled out. He wiped his cheek with his shoulder, letting John’s hands rest on top of his.
Then Sherlock took John by the waist did the unexpected:
John lifted his chin and fixed Sherlock with his gaze, small smile curling at the edge of his lips.
“They – they we also alerted to the fact I was a virgin. I don’t know if I am or if I’m – I’m not – anymore. My mouth isn’t – anymore.”
John put on his double gloves and went to the head to remove the white cloth covering the head, he pulled it down to the neck.
Ok I couldn't resist having Sherlock helping a gay couple ! I'm sorry for making Cynthia and Maria have zero descriptions but i imagine Cynthia as the more soft-spoken and sensitive while Maria is more boisterous. You can imagine them how you'd like.
" But the case Sherlock! You always put the case first!"
“It’s okay, John. You are in Cambridge. You and I are on a case. You are safe.” Sherlock intoned with a steady voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where are they?” John managed through gritted teeth.
Sherlock seemed to feel a need to interject: “I’m sorry for being unreasonable. I was disrespectful. I know giving Rosie up must have been hard for you, on top of everything—”
John had not known what to say. It really was sweet, that this lesbian couple felt stronger together thanks to Sherlock. But it churned John’s gut to know they’d been fooled by an act. They really thought he and Sherlock were passionately in love. They’d heard Sherlock defending him. They’d seen Sherlock rushing in to make sure John was unharmed, touching his face.
Sandra worked at the morgue part-time, which was where she met Alicia. Alicia and Sandra broke up for a squabble and George planting the idea of murder in her head. He was happy she was not pursuing a same-sex relationship anymore. She committed the murder by poisoning the ex and her boyfriend in the medical lab facility. It looked like an experiment gone wrong.
“Thank you, John.”
"You thought of everything, you even put the hard pillow on the left side!" John exclaimed, trying to diffuse the tension.
“How could you lower yourself to speak to my pompous excuse of a brother?” fumed Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m in my mid-twenties, you’re in your early thirties. The story is that I met you at the lab and you tutored me a bit during med school. I admired your knowledge and practical nature while you found my bright mind and quirks endearing. We are in love and do not care about ages. Now you’ve done your foundation years and are learning first aid and traumatology here.”
Warning for mentions of torture, rape. Nothing too detailed but please don't trigger yourself.
John turned and walked blindly towards the hallway, slipped on his shoes, ran swiftly down the stairs, scrambled through the coats on the hooks…and threw his closed fist at the wall.
“Um, yeah, um. I am a registrar doctor doing a first aid course here. Afraid I followed Sherlock here to be near him. I’m from London myself, good thing I got into this course.” John joked, a bit self-consciously.
“Are you hurt? John please say you’re not hurt!” Sherlock’s lips were trembling, his eyes were glistened with moisture. John could see this was not an act, Sherlock actually cared about him. He cared so much he was breaking down in front of a crowd, in the middle of a case. He saw that Sherlock had a great heart as well as a great brain. His loyalty and care made all those years of suffering worth it. Sherlock was looking for other injuries, haphazardly feeling John’s limbs as if he were about to disappear.
John kept shooting nervous glances towards Sherlock throughout dinner and Sherlock would sometimes reply with a concerned or frustrated glance. Hard to tell if the glance was friendly or not with Sherlock. However for the most part Sherlock was decidedly in what John called his “disgustingly charming” mode, that is until the conversation started drifting towards gore and guts, as is inevitable between medical professionals.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, we can talk now,” Sherlock said tentatively.
So that is where his mind got that sentence. Sherlock must have been murmuring it to wake him up, like he was doing now. John wanted to hide under a rock, in this case his pillow. But no, Sherlock wanted John’s attention. He really never could deny Sherlock anything.
Sherlock played at a pout but could not fight back a smile. The mask was quickly back on.
The phone call had been more trying and draining than he’d expected. He hadn’t been able to get Sherlock out of the dorm room and hadn’t wanted to show his emotions in public, so he’d had the phone conversation with Sherlock in the room. Sherlock had known when to let John pace the room angrily and when to squeeze his shoulder. At one point of the phone call John let out an involuntary sob. The guilt of leaving Mary, his sweet Mary who had done nothing wrong, into this situation made him feel like an utter prick. Sherlock had known exactly what to do and started rubbing large circles over his back with his hands as John leant his head into Sherlock’s neck.
You need to consent to full-body donations, and if you have an injury or autopsy done you cannot donate your body for medical teaching. That is at least the rules at my uni.
“We will be together,” John acquiesced, “We won’t ever have to be alone again Sherlock.”
When the teacher was out of earshot, Sherlock drew his hand away and wolfed down his scrambled eggs as if nothing had happened. John’s hand was still buzzing from the contact with Sherlock’s lips. John had many questions but he settled with the most important.
“Sherlock, I wouldn’t do anything I didn’t want to do. That kiss over at the restaurant, that wasn’t a kiss of a sociopath, even a high-functioning one at that. You wanted this,” John remarked.
John realized maybe this pretending-to-be-in-a-relationship might be tiring for Sherlock as well. After all, he was not good with small talk and gushy emotions. And now he’d invited Sherlock to be best man at his wedding – the most lovey-dovey event of all! Sherlock had seemed excited about the color-coordinating the wedding invitations, but that was his detail-oriented nature. He might be nervous about the social bit? John figured Sherlock needed a break from this as much as he did.
He decided sleep was the best medicine for the heartache gnawing at his insides. As Sherlock said, he could do the acting in the morning. With all his willpower, he turned around and to reluctantly face away from Sherlock and towards the door. Yes, he would endure crunching his bad shoulder into the mattress if it meant saving his honor. That was the only thing he was good at these days, being a soldier. Even if that particular war that only existed in his head.
Sherlock still hadn't figured out the whole case and was tired of having to maintain the facade of a relationship with John. That much was what John could gather. He did not understand the rest, and he loathed when Sherlock left him out of the loop.
He now stood in front of a restaurant that looked fancy enough but affordable. Italian. Reminded John of Angelo’s. Obviously.
“John? John! John Look at me! Calm down, I did not mean any harm, I take it back if you want. You are right, I have no right to impose. I have made you some tea, sit down. Please?” He looked nervous, fiddling with his cuffs.
John put the card in the hotel room door and pulled on the handle. He gasped as he opened the door and took a steadying step back.
John’s voice cracked at that last sentence. The tremor in his hand seemed to awaken from these kinds of emotionally fraught conversations.
“Good night John,” Sherlock said quietly, bringing John’s hand to his mouth.
John leant forward and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock blushed to his most handsome shade.
“Yes, Sherlock. I love you,” John simply revealed, “And I take it you do as well?”
“Your phone is your heart, you usually keep it hidden. Your phone is old and used. Mary doesn’t have access to the deepest parts of it. You are letting me see more than you are willing to show her. You should have been rattled to hear what I told you tonight, and any normal person would have waited until morning for this conversation. But as we know, you are addicted to danger. Your gaze is steady right now, even as your breathing is quicker,” Sherlock explained while taking his wrist, “And your pulse is elevated. You find this exciting. Your eyes –”
The case gets clearer. John has doubts. Warning for mention of homophobia.
"Who's watching?" John asked, searching around the room.
Sherlock curled up in his chair, pretending his defensive stance was him sulking rather than being genuinely worried about John’s next move. The man had punched Sherlock in the nose two months ago when Sherlock came back and Sherlock would rather face the Nobel banquet without a nasty bruise.
Sherlock seemed to be furious. He shoved George between the shoulders and placed a foot on his back, throwing some rope to John who started tying George up next to Sandra.
John pressed his palms to his eyes, “…Yes?”
Sherlock had stayed silent all evening when he finally perked up during an advertisement break at one in the morning.
George cleared his throat.
John let his words sink in, the effect on Sherlock’s expression made John’s heart melt. Sherlock gazed at John in wonder.
) but he was willing to work hard to do better.
John felt a soft whispered breath at his ear.
“Yeah. Yeah, you’re right Maria. Mr Sampler saw us. Caught me kissing Maria in the chemistry corridor last week. He literally tore us apart from each other. Called us ugly dykes. Sherlock was the only person at the lab at that time of the day, pipetting stuff. He tried to stop Mr Sampler, but he got another telling off for being gay. He thought Sherlock was influencing us to be gay or something in that vein. We tried to explain we didn’t know his name, we hadn’t even seen him before.”
Both were arrested with Sandra sobbing through her confession but George was silent. Instead he glared daggers at John and Sherlock and only uttered one word.
It was true that Sherlock basically never slept during cases so he would not have been able to witness it often. But they were flat mates! He knew all about the violin screeching at ungodly hours of the morning, but not of snoring.
John gets angry. He hits a wall.
“Open your eyes.”
John’s brain supplied that terrible theory to tingle in the back of his mind. John rushed out again in the downpour and just ran through Cambridge’s campus like a madman. He paused under an archway to catch his breath. Suddenly, a ping from his phone:
Sherlock was right: it was not his place to contradict him about his bloody life. Sherlock was however wrong: treating John like he was made of glass (as if he hadn’t been to Afghanistan!) was frankly insulting.
“We won’t be needing two bedrooms,” John revealed with a glance at Sherlock.
John decided the first stop would be the dorm. Sherlock was not there and everything was untouched. Sherlock had left without an umbrella, and that fact alone made John mad. He couldn’t have taken the train without the keys to 221B, and Sherlock’s pair of keys was lying on the night stand. Where could he have gone?
It was difficult to not enjoy something that was clearly enjoyable. John realized he must leave this bed at once. Or else he’d get sucked in. He turned the bedside lamp on, extricated himself from Sherlock’s grasp, grabbed his clothes and fled to the bathroom to change. He showered his late night grief away. He always showered in the morning, as Sherlock had deduced one morning: “a routine from army days”.
John makes some progress!
John had fallen asleep on the bed but had woken up due to a particularly loud boom of thunder. The television was on mute and the static electricity in the room had been the only noise until then.
“Mrs Jones? Cynthia?” John addressed the student closest to his desk, “Could you check what that last text said? I think it’s rather important.”
“Abuse runs in certain families as genius does in others.”
Sherlock grumbled something about right side of the bed, no difference…
“Hurt him. Yes.” Mycroft said scathingly.
Sherlock then dashed out the door, leaving John to take care of his business. So that solved the awkwardness at least, but John still felt uneasy. John hoped their suspect Sandra was still ignorant to the fact that they were investigating. Otherwise she might do something to Sherlock.
It seemed to be too short and too long at the same time when the kiss broke apart. John longed for the contact, he looked up into Sherlock’s eyes and Sherlock seemed surprised by his own boldness. However he put up the wall again the split second after glancing at John and took a step back.
“Did you not like my scrambled eggs?” Sherlock asked with a smirk.
They were brought to the table Cynthia was seated at, wearing a long silver gown.
John then realized that meant Sherlock was willing to give up a case if John ruined it. That would not do. He had to get over himself. People had died. He could not permit more deaths. Without them there would be no justice for Sandra or her victims.
“Gavin, just let me go relieve my bladder without watching me like an animal at the zoo!” Sherlock exclaimed while squirming on the sofa.
Sherlock suddenly turned to stare at John. Then he seemed to get a grip on himself and nodded. John was unsure what to say next. He just went with the flow of emotions. This was something he had to do. Not just as a favor Mycroft, but a debt to Sherlock.
“You opened my eyes to how our lives could be together. You are as always my conductor of light, John. All my deductions, guided onto the right path thanks to you. And you do so unassumingly, with such confidence in me. I do not know what I have done to deserve such a loyal and steadfast companion, not to mention such a strong and clever one at that. You truly are brilliant, and amazing, and all the adjectives you attribute to me on your blog,” Sherlock declared, “We must never part because without one another we suffer. Together, we are better than the sum of our parts.”
John demonstrates how to do an operation, is interrupted by Sherlock who demonstrates something else. Slight Garridebs moment! Warning for description of traumatic injury.
John’s shoulder ached tonight and he was not making matters better. But John Watson, Ex Captain of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, would not relent. He would not move and persist through the night awake if he had to.
John finds out about Sherlock's scars.
(See the end of the chapter for
When they got back home and dried off, Sherlock was in a quiet and subdued mood from the crying. John ordered take out even though they’d already eaten, just for the sake of the ritual. It did smell good.
“I know. Look I—I’m sorry. Don’t you see? I can’t take care of her. Rosie. She—she deserves better. Parents who will bloody care for her. Who will—will love her. Not—not abuse her or neglect her or anything else.”
“Thank you for your deductions, but they are wrong – as they usually are!” Sherlock shouted as he stood up and brusquely wrapped his dressing gown around his body.
“You might have forgotten –-hm?— that I’m engaged. An engagement you had the good grace to interrupt, hm? You might also have forgotten that I AM NOT GAY!” John shouted while jabbing his fork towards Sherlock at every syllable.
“But that is even better! It will be even more interesting to watch somebody with expertise demonstrate how it should be done!”
John was shocked. He did not know Sherlock snored! He seemed way too slim and delicate and…god-like? to succumb to such a basal human affliction.
Sherlock shook his head and sat down on the edge of the bed again. He seemed to ponder the question for some time. John wondered if he’d gone to his mind palace.
“These past few years haven’t been easy on me -- but you know that of course. You jumped off the bloody hospital roof first off and left me to grieve for two years.
“Better get that, I’ll be right back,” John said and proceeded towards the kitchen.
“Says the man who licked his fingers from strawberry jam.”
John and Sherlock had barely just arrived their hotel room for an exciting new case in Cambridge. A double murder to be exact --triple murder if you count the disappearance of a lab rat, as Sherlock pointed out. The victims were a chemistry student and med student girlfriend, killed in the former’s dorm room. Sherlock suspected an act of jealousy from one of their university colleagues. Mycroft suspected the replacement anatomy teacher. John did not know who to suspect.
“Ready for what?”
He placed a square of butter on the stack, just like John liked it. He opened and closed different shelves and drawers here and there, looking for cutlery, honey and tea bags. Sherlock looked manic, like he was overly excited about a new experiment.
John’s experiment had the desired effect of riling Sherlock up. He could not go back now.
“Sherlock is actually my boyfriend and he wrote that as code to tell me he wants to watch me in action. He will come bursting in here at any moment,” John blurted out. It was the most plausible thing his mind could supply.
Sherlock seemed to sense something was off and gently led John away by the elbow.
Warning for mentions of homophobia and slurs.
“Oh no oh no! I’m so clumsy, sorry! Really so so sorry!” Sherlock exclaimed. But then he winked at John. Oh the prick. John knew exactly what Sherlock was doing. Sherlock strode towards the waitress and showed her the mess, using his apologetical puppy eyes.
Sherlock seemed to analyze the scene in front of him as if it was a crime scene.
.............................................................
Deductions are made, the case is over, but instead of going home John and Sherlock are fawned over by fangirls.
Sherlock hummed, “A ridiculous notion if I ever heard one. As I’ve told you before, the Work is what I’m married to! Also, you should really be more careful cleaning out the shower of your pubic hairs.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“On his way.”
“Um Doctor Watson? John? I—I just wanted to say—um—sorry the nerves are getting to me!” Cynthia giggled awkwardly like a schoolgirl.
“Your phone is on the bedside table. It has otherwise been in your suitcase while in our dorm room. Mary hasn’t called or texted you since our case began and you haven’t texted her either,” Sherlock pointed out.
This had all gone very well, they had been welcomed at the university and Mary had allowed John to leave before the wedding preparations. There was just the slight problem of sleeping arrangements.
“Then Mr Sampler said something about how he doesn’t listen to someone who gets it up in the arse with a pathetic retired stump of a man and Sherlock told him he didn’t speak to anyone who fucks a girl 20 years younger than him. I’m guessing he meant Sandra? Anyway Mr Sampler then became furious and slapped him right in the face. Sherlock grabbed his hand, twisted it behind his back and hissed
He suddenly felt a wave of anger towards Sherlock for…for corrupting him like this. For thwarting his resolve to be a good respectable man. The posh junkie would be the death of him someday. It was shameful, the thoughts that came to mind when he thought of Sherlock.
i hope you enjoyed! i'm planning on just rounding this off with one or two more chapters of John and Sherlock being incandescently happy (between resolving a few remaining issues).
Sherlock looked looked disinterested and bored from the conversation. He looked down at the knife like it was a mere inconvenience, a pebble in his shoe.
John and Sherlock laughed together and John threw his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. They were holding each other in some sort of side-hug, with their bodies touching from shoulders to knees. It was amazing to be so close, the air between them was electric.
"Er--I just thought you could choose side of the bed, I have no preference either way", John announced. "Don't be ridiculous John, from all the facts I have gathered about you it is easy to deduce your preferences regarding sleeping arrangements."
The anatomy room i based this on: https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavianum#/media/Fil:Anatomiska_teatern_Gustavianum.jpg
“Good morning Sherlock,” John greeted him with a smile oozing sentimentality.
“I’m sorry John…”
Both middle-aged women looked in awe at him, completely enraptured by his little speech. John was actually relieved to bask in their glow, it made his interminable wait for Sherlock more bearable. John had just made the incision when Sherlock arrived.
What had gotten into him! Sherlock despised sentiment, he had to tone it down.
before releasing him,” Cynthia continued, smiling at the memory.
Christ he was never going to be ready. But he had to leave. Now.
His wedding to Mary. Mary, the sweetest, most practical, least-like-Sherlock a person could ever be. Sherlock belonged to the ethereal and eclectic world of flat-sharing, skulls and crimes. Mary belonged to the comfortable, domestic world of suburban villas. John was torn between the two, but he knew he would never be in Sherlock’s heart.
“Jo-ohnn”
“No—no you did not get it wrong, your deduction is absolutely correct,” John half-sighed half-laughed, “But why are you making me breakfast? It is not my birthday last I checked. Do we have a case?”
He kissed John’s knuckles with a sincerity that took John’s breath away. John just nodded with a fond smile, feeling a tear push past his eyelashes. This was like a dream come true and John was enjoying every moment. The path to this point had been long, but had been worth. So, so worth it. He would never take anything for granted ever again. He would never want for more ever again, because he had everything he’d wanted. He felt luminously happy, blissful in a way he did not know was possible.
“I can’t bear to have her get hurt, Mycroft. I would never forgive myself. And my relatives are no better.” John said, shaking his head.
Back to their dorm room, John demanded an explanation of what Sherlock had done in the courtyard before he came.
Maria found out his airway was fine and functional with her state-of-the-art oto-rhino-laryngology instruments. She had heard of terrible stories of people tortured through forced tube feeding with boiling water. She was glad that was not the case but the mutism was probably due to some deep psychological damage. During her examinations she’d had to put the patient under general anesthesia and the patient was terrified, having probably been drugged as a torture device. Cynthia, the anesthesiologist on call, had been the one who managed to calm him down enough that the procedure ran smoothly.
“To show you. What happened in Syria, when I was away,” Sherlock said while looking straight into his eyes. He seemed awake and resolute, but in a sad way. Resigned.
John hummed an affirmative. The light switch went off with a little click! and Sherlock shuffled around the covers. John stared at the ceiling, waiting. After a while John turned his head and realized the detective had fallen asleep.
The heavy doors swung shut behind him with a loud thud. Sherlock looked a mess, his hair in disarray, his breath quick. His coat flapped behind him as the doors closed.
Sherlock called after him: “Don’t be an idiot! That was rather the point, you know! We need to sleep in the same room in order to catch the killer!”
The body was wheeled into the anatomy theater. George went through the basics of keeping an airway open and the indications for the surgery.
“She’s our anatomy teacher’s current girlfriend, and who is cheating on him with that woman by the bar.”
Hey I hope you liked this! I'm a bit disappointed I could not get deeper, I kind of triggered myself writing this.
We learn more about the case.
But Sherlock had decided to sleep on. With his extremities laced with John’s. It was strangely comforting to touch another warm body in the cold. Of course he wished to be back in bed with Mary, where things were more wholesome and loving and less complicated. But sharing a bed with Sherlock was so soothing. And were he not about to get married he might have considered enjoying it… But Watsons were loyal. He should not even be thinking of the alternatives, of what ifs, lovely visions of how things could be. He was about to become the happiest man alive with Mary. And there was no “buts”. Of course he would.
John sat himself down in one of the armchairs, bowed his head. Took a deep breath. No doubt had he been to his therapist Ella Thomson this week and learnt some coping techniques.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
“Your eyes are full of affection,” Sherlock concluded, looking lost.
“NO!” John growled out, thumping his fist against the mantle where the skull rattled, “I will not be your experiment in human emotions! You’ve already DIED in front of me for your own amusement, I’m not playing your funny little games again!”
John shuffled his shoes and said, “Between me and Sherlock? Is it really that obvious?”
John felt a tremendous wave of despair and upset boiling through him. He did not make a sound, suffocating the sobs before they emerged. But he could not stop the tear forming out the corner of his eye. He felt it form, round and wet, pour down a streak on his cheek and drip a wet spot on his pillow. John’s last thoughts before he fell asleep were that at least Sherlock had not been awake to witness this moment of weakness.
It would be far too easy to fall back into a role of dating his friend. John had to pretend to be in a relationship when he wasn't allowed a real one--and thus had to maintain a certain emotional barrier.
“I don’t want your pity!” Sherlock shouted as he stood up and started pacing, pulling at his hair.
George had offered to cover the deed up, with his knowledge of the morgue and his high status at Cambridge, thus securing Sandra as a girlfriend. He might not be getting his hands dirty, but he was cunning and manipulated young Sandra into thinking her sexuality was wrong and that murdering her ex was the right thing to do.
John’s hand started shaking. Get a grip on yourself, you’re holding a scalpel!
It had taken John’s breath away. He had thought he was going to die so he had not really pondered it, but now that the expression was back on Sherlock’s face, he was hit by its intensity.
But Lestrade? Lestrade knew of his past as an addict and had gotten him out of the gutter on more than one occasion. Lestrade was not impressed by Sherlock’s genius. He appreciated Sherlock’s help at cases and had grown close to Sherlock, but knew his duty. And he knew his duty now was to help Sherlock stay away from drugs.
John saw the petite animated young woman, and damn! Sherlock knew his type. Or maybe she just looked like Mary.
“Useless hard drive space!” Sherlock countered.
Sherlock had stopped snoring and it was eerily quiet. John wished he’d start again. Then Sherlock mumbled something unintelligible into his pillow. John heard him the next slurred words clearly enough to make out one whispered word:
He knew of several things that made John happy or at least content. He vowed to contribute to John’s wellbeing. He now did the groceries for example. He was not always very skilled in his new pursuits (
Sherlock chastised himself. Why did he call it Mary’s? John lived there now.
“They’re engaged, didn’t you know? You are so oblivious.”
“SHE WHAT?!” John roared, taking a threatening step towards Sherlock.
“You do not get to call him that!” John growled, “Sherlock he called you a freak, I will end him. I swear I will.”
Sherlock was taking ages in the shower. John had to turn on the small old tv to drown out the sounds of the water pouring down Sherlock’s body. God, that body! He tried to distract himself from his inappropriate thoughts by turning to a nature documentary about the life cycles of bees. Unfortunately, the closeups of pouring honey only reminded him of the lush shampoo running down Sherlock’s shoulders, his back, his hips, his legs… He ended up switching to a documentary about Victorian times, which was bleak and drab and hopefully unsexy. But even in the Romantic men of that time reminded him of Sherlock, with long limbs and soft pouts.
John had been letting some of his own frustrations go with Ella, but Sherlock could not bring himself to go to therapy. He hated being analyzed. He knew John hated it too and admired the soldier’s bravery for exposing himself to scrutiny. Even Sherlock’s often intense scrutiny. John had always been the strongest of them.
“Nothing much, we just wanted to thank you,” replied Cynthia, nodding towards her wife.
“I was just asking you to leave the door open. Now go piss!”
“My anger issues are not your concern Sherlock.”
“Oh, Sherlock… No, no, no. You’ve been so brave. It’s over now, you’re here with me. That’s it let it out… Shhh…” John’s murmured into Sherlock’s ear as Sherlock was wrestling with his tears.
Sherlock found this new routine not much different to how his life was with John before the incident…Or rather before Everything. Before Culverton, before the Tarmac, before Mary’s death, before the Wedding…Before the Fall. The routine (black, two sugars) was the same, but that easy camaraderie was gone, lost. Not much had changed, yet everything had.
“I really appreciate your thanks, but I am merely doing my life’s work, which comprises of bringing criminals to justice and loving John Watson.”
John pretended to consider and then with a distinct nod walked up towards the center of the room with the covered body. The class gave him a round of applause. John wasn’t often in the spotlight, being relegated to the role of Sherlock’s sidekick, but he found he rather enjoyed it. It reminded him that he was a competent doctor who was useful. This was how Sherlock must feel when doing his final deductions. He even had a dead body to circle around, his mind supplied.
But John knew he was all both Sherlock and Rosie had. And all he had was them. It was them against the rest of the world. How ironic.
John finally apologizes.
No, there was more.
He wanted to put it off forever, but he was not a man who skirted from his responsibilities.
Sherlock explained that Sandra had killed her ex and her ex’s boyfriend. The anatomy teacher acting out was just because he was scared of losing Sandra with whom he was recklessly in love with. He saw Sherlock and John as a threat towards Sandra and attacked. He was probably biphobic and by extension homophobic in part because he knew of Sandra’s ex and did not accept that side of her. He was insecure she would run off with a woman.
The pair of detectives finally arrived in Stockholm in darkness – as was customary, seeing that the city barely saw sunlight in December. Mycroft had booked a room at the Grand Hotel, the most expensive hotel in town, on the banks of the lake Mälaren. This was presumably where several of the other Nobel guests were staying, which allowed them a head-start in the investigation.
“Haha…yes…that’s right…just…don’t go leaking that to the press…it’s not official yet…we better get going…isn’t that right Sherlock?...” John attempted weakly, awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck, ready to get out of there.
John lay still as a ramrod next to Sherlock. How the hell would he fall asleep? After what felt like an eternity, Sherlock asked: “Should I turn the light off?”
John spinned around, eyebrows raised in surprise. Sherlock’s “strops” usually lasted a while but Sherlock couldn’t help but relent when seeing John so defeated.
What was less expected was the leg that had slung itself over his legs and Sherlock’s hand grazing his shoulder. This was sending John in a bit of a panic as he was not used to touching the self-proclaimed sociopath. He checked the clock: 6.21AM. The alarm was set to 7 so that they could plan the day, eat a very public breakfast and get ready for class at 8.
“We are going back to London this evening, we should probably take the train at 17:15, so you can be home by dinner,” Sherlock communicated.
Sherlock came out dressed in a hoodie and track pants.
“Come again?” John asked, bewildered.
“You are amazing,” John whispered in awe.
After a few moments of silence, John pulled Sherlock’s hand from it’s stop position to rest lightly with his own on the window ledge. Their fingers intertwined effortlessly.
“It was to be my final mission, the last thread of Moriarty’s international organization. Unfortunately my mind and transport were weakened from years on the road. I was irrational, distracted. They captured me in Belgrade, I was held for three weeks before Mycroft came. It would have been only days before they would have tried other methods of gaining information. And from my observations, they had many methods.”
“Well isn’t that lovely!” the teacher exclaimed, “I must be off, but I’m happy to meet you and I’m sure we will see each other in the anatomy theater!”
This is yet another angsty chapter with some hurt/comfort...Next one will be more fluffy by the end!
John raised his eyebrows at Sherlock. To which Sherlock winked.
Sherlock did have a point that they needed to play their parts to solve the case, both for gathering information onsite and to attract the killer. But John was sick and tired of always tagging along, following the Great Sherlock Holmes. Wasn’t he allowed to have his own life, with Mary? Sherlock did not bother to inform him before faking his own death, for god’s sake! He should be able to have his quiet life in the suburbs without the whirlwind of drama that followed Sherlock wherever he went.
John looked rather grumpy in his puffy coat at the back of the cab. John had resisted any attempts of Sherlock to dress him up and had been incensed when he caught Sherlock looking up tailors online (he had deduced John’s measurements after all). Sherlock knew his Belstaff would blend in nicely with the minimalist Swedish fashion. John could be fashionable, in his own understated way, but lacked the sense of class that mingling with the elites would require. Undoubtably scientists were rarely known for their sense of fashion, but being invited to a prestigious award ceremony required a particular attention to appearance John would be uneasy with. Sherlock had bought the suit.
“If you’re talking about what happened to Sherlock, I…”
John snuck behind George, hoping to go unseen. Unfortunately the gravel he had shuffled was loud.
…………………………………………………….
Sherlock’s back was a web of crisscrossing scars. Some long, some short. They seemed to be whip lashes for the most part, etched into his back like some deranged tapestry. John took in a shuddering breath. Sherlock’s back was still turned toward him, ramrod straight. His head was bowed and his eyes were shut, as if bracing himself from some impact.
Then Sherlock seemed to nod to himself, looking up at John with intense, albeit sad eyes.
"You saw her right there?"
The sheet was soft and silky, which made John think of Sherlock’s dressing gown he was without a doubt slipping on behind that bathroom door. How could a uni bedroom have such pristine sheets? Why was the smell of Sherlock’s aftershave overwhelm him so? John groaned. Oh, of course Sherlock had brought his own sheets, the posh git. John rolled his eyes and fiddled with his outdated phone, pretending to do something useful.
“John I—I can’t tell you more at present, but I think you should know that those two years were not easy on me either.”
“I hear you, that sounds tough. Thank you for telling me. I think you and Sherlock are a great couple, but I understand it is difficult if you’re scared all the time. Talk to Sherlock, John. I think he will understand too. But he can’t read minds, he needs to know you care so that he can help you along the way,” Maria remarked, and then added with a little smirk, “Also, I bet you were too wrapped up in your thoughts to notice, but he was totally sneakily checking
John snorted. He knew that was a distinctly not-good reaction, but he couldn’t help himself. Sherlock had decided to fake his suicide to have a glorious bit of fun playing puzzles with Moriarty’s web, leaving John to grieve and feel like an empty husk.
