The towering angel has a stack of finger sandwiches and hands one to Dean.  Meg pulls a piece off, shoving it into her mouth with a huff.  Oddly enough the angel bodyguard has a calming effect on Dean.  He clearly has a thing for stoic soldiers of heaven, but Uriel seems different, almost unaware of his omega status.  Huh?
Hanging his head Dean releases the final blow.  “I will never be claimed.  Any future with me will be one made of our commitment to each other and not a bite on the neck.  No one will own me.  There will be no land of confusion between us, I will remain free.  Always.”
“Are you coming or going?”  Hannah stands before him in a gorgeous royal blue dress.  The color makes her blue eyes pop, her chestnut hair styled in big curls.
“They are red, which totally goes with my Christmas look.” Meg throws her hip into Claire’s leg, and then snatches her fairy wand before dashing out to the car.
Dean smiles.  Professor Novak helps his students to stay in school; the effort hits a chord with him.  “His tuition is covered with scholarships, for now anyways. In his senior year, everything changes.  I’m currently helping with living expenses and books.  Which is not cheap, let me tell you.”
A little while later, Dean burrows into his enormous pile of fabric and pillows.  Sam has done a superb job twirling the material in a circular fashion so it really looks like a bird’s hideaway.  The parade is on TV, and the omega purrs with happiness.  His brother is hovering in the corner trying to blend into the cabinets, “Sam, I see you over there.  What’s up?”
Kevin grasps Balthazar’s hand with his free one as the four men remain in silence.  It’s the youngest of the group who murmurs, “What do we do now?”
“Lucifer left, and I just spoke with Sam,” Cas lifts Dean’s head to put it in the alpha’s lap.  “Portia is fine, and he’ll bring her by in the morning on his way to work.  I worry that if we keep letting her sleep over there Ruby and Emma might try to keep her.”
“Make sure Ishim has no reason to believe Cas is a threat.  I’m going to sell him on the idea that Cas is only a toy.  An alpha for me to play with,” the next few words sting, “like a doll.”
It’s only then that Castiel notices, Dean’s grumbles are about him.  He tilts closer, listening.  Dean glances up, catching his gaze, exclaiming quietly, “Have I ever told you about my angel Cas?”
“No,” he picks up the little bed remote that turns on the 45-inch LCD TV on the wall.  Dean has a hunch this isn’t in every room.  He finds old Tom and Jerry cartoons, letting them run muted in the background.  “Doesn’t make it suck any less.”
The older man nods his head.  “I can’t put my finger on it, but there seems to be a resemblance.  Do you know much about your extended family?”
Grabbing his arm, Amara twirls him to face her; the woman cups his chin in her hands tenderly, “Mating Naomi was not about love.  It was a business decision between our families.  We have affection for each other and, hell, let’s be honest, angry sex is spectacular.”
All through their interactions, the underscore of Sam’s snores continues.  Castiel knows he’s loved when Dean allows the Alpha three bites of the pie.  The realization keeps a smile on his face.
“My father said that good girls kill the omegas that exude the scent of purity beyond all others. He said you smell like Heaven’s angels, and you must be stopped. I gave you Alphesterone in everything possible. Your morphine injections, your oral pain meds, and even your fucking Jell-O. The first time Dean scented your slit, he should have slaughtered you. Any alpha would have reacted that way, regardless of their wimp status. Yet, here you stand. This shouldn’t be possible.”
“The best, Cas.”  Dean laces his fingers together, placing them on Castiel’s chest and resting his chin on top.
“I don’t believe inanimate objects have a will of their own.”  Cas sits next to him, staring at the bee shaped bean bag chair.  “Did the item come in a box?”
His friend leads him from the room to the stairwell out of the building, “Okay, Clarence, do you want to just walk over to the Winchester offices?”
“Sam will not be able to return to Stanford.  If he wishes to continue his studies, he may enroll for the fall at Kansas University on a limited basis.”
Dean raises his head, turning to face the nurse. “Yes, you will, and can you bring it in here?  I don’t want to move.”
“I know it’s a touchy subject, but Dean it’s necessary.  While you were out with Donna I specifically made sure that your health care package included a heat helper of the real person kind.”  Dean can practically envision Sam squirming on the other end.  “No more BOKs; you need a real knot.”
“No.  Although, I agree with the sentiment.  You are the heart of our family and should be admired on the day of thanks.  I am grateful you are in my life.”
“No way. I keep it simple; last year I wore jeans and a green button up.  Brings out my eyes.”  He bats his lashes; the action having no effect on the girl.  She’s his age and has no time for his shit this morning.
The sub can’t make out the entire conversation, but she’s screaming about being dosed with something and how the hotel is compromised. He wants to tell her that the phone call would work better if she wasn’t talking into a banana, but then maybe he won’t.
The hunter carries the quilt as he trails behind Castiel.  The sun is warm with a cool, light breeze, giving a fresh feel to the air.  Dean is wearing his standard uniform of a grey Henley with jeans, and his boots.  Castiel chose hip hugging jeans that hang just low enough to show off the cut of his muscles.  The Led Zeppelin t-shirt, stolen from Dean, fits gloriously as his tattoo peers out near the elbow.  God, he would give his left nut to kiss just one speck of his silky smooth skin.  Every inch of Castiel’s body invades his dreams, taking residence for the foreseeable future.
He’s only vaguely relieved when Cas raises his hand. Inias adding, “With all his yoga stuff, Castiel is the best rider.”
“Do you wish to stay, Alpha?  To touch me?”  Dean ghosts his fingers up his chest fluttering over his nipple.
Dean pulls his hips back then snaps them back, slamming against the fake knot. Castiel cries out in pleasure, “Holy moly, do that again!”
Delphine catches the door before it finishes closing, “You’ll live and trust me, sometimes it's best to not know until MacLeod has worked his magic.”
With the advent of the drab cloud, the omega licks his lips.  Fury bowls over the safety precautions on his heat.  The low simmer has begun to grow.  The omega doesn’t give a shit.  Ishim has given him an out, and Dean plans on taking it.  Blame his disgust towards Ishim on the man’s lack of empathy for the plight of Sammy.  Dumbass made it so damn easy.
Dean wants his Egyptian cotton and miles of space to spread out on; the biggest disappointment is that Cas struggles to fit on the bed with him.  Yes, they tried, and the poor alpha fell out.  Although, the entertainment value in watching Cas squirm as a nurse rushed in to save him was priceless.
“I’m going to ask Dean to spend sun up to sun down with me, alone, and before dusk he has to kiss me.”
“Have yourself a merry little Christmas, Let your heart be light, From now on, Our troubles will be out of sight.”  Letting his eyelids drift shut, he sings the carol from memory.  “Have yourself a merry little Christmas.”
Sundays are the Centers’ free days.  Unlike on the outside, where individuals get a two-day weekend, omegas get one.  Mainly because there isn’t much to do to stay busy; idle hands and all.  This happens to be the day when the computer lab bursts at the seams with bodies.  Again, Dean thanks the powers that be for Ash.  He forces both omegas to rise before 7 a.m. to beat the crowds.
“Jerk, Emma’s in school.”  Sam peeks at the claiming bite, having to pull Ruby’s head from it.  His sweet girl is still growling softly at the mark.  “Now I get why we haven’t seen you in a while.”
The two men stroll across the lawn to the dormitories. A giant four-story cement structure built by the military. It’s cold and harsh, but Dean’s certain the damn thing will survive everything including tornado season every year.
The alpha scoots to the far side of his bed, then timidly pulls the sheets back.  “You could nap here.  I promise to stay on my side of the bed.” Castiel's eyes search Dean’s. “It would be … relaxing to have your scent here.”
After settling into the couch, Cas brings a warm bottle of milk for Portia.  Carefully Dean places the nipple near her mouth, and she suckles with gusto.  The alpha tucks in next to them, Cas’s arm draped over Dean’s back.  “God, I always thought I’d hate owning a dog.”
“Dean, I went and found several witnesses, all of whom say the same thing… you would have taken the young man’s life if the Sheriff hadn’t pulled you off herself.” Sam gives him a stern expression, “If Sheriff Hanscum hadn’t recognized my last name and called Jess’s dad, you would be on your way to an arraignment hearing that would eventually lead you to a jail sentence of three to five years.”
“You are so beautiful, my Princess.” The words from Castiel set off butterflies in the sub’s stomach.
“No need, the patrol outside isn’t going to miss shots of that caliber.”  Gabe taps Gadreel’s foot as he unwraps a lollipop, “nice shootin’, Tex.”
“Calm down ya idjits.”  Bobby yells from next to Max holding the hose.  “I will talk to the foreman about behavior.  It will be fine.  Now can I turn off the water?”
“No you didn’t, Dean. Look at me.”  It takes a second, but eventually Dean complies, “This was bound to happen.  Cas always gets like this when Zachariah comes around.  That asshole is the trigger for this, not you.  My brother adores you.  I’m fairly sure the kiss was his idea anyways.”
Darkness swallows the 1977 F150 truck. The only illumination shines from the moon and stars.  It’s a clear, beautiful, cold night. Light bounces off the snow, brightening the sky a shade or two.  Castiel hums quietly along with the radio to an old Beatles song, Here Comes the Sun. Dean’s head is resting on Cas’s shoulder. The weight of his mate cuddled up against him warms something deep within the Alpha. Sam’s on the other side, snoring. The younger brother’s face smashes against the truck’s window. Cas can’t decide if he should wake him or let the Omega sleep.  Oh, well if it were truly uncomfortable, he’d move.
“Alpha Panels are done by silent auction,” Charlie answers.  “An interested Alpha receives an iPad with the auction app along with a pseudonym.  It allows alphas the freedom to express interest and make offers without embarrassment.  Basically, if they lose no one will know they tried.  Gotta keep the Alpha pride protected.”
Rubbing his forehead, fighting back another headache, Dean responds, “The magical beans that grew a honeysuckle shrub.”
“No, you moron, you smell content.  I thought only omegas could do that.”  Gabriel isn’t teasing, the statement more of an observation.
He stops next to the wall, leaning his forehead against the cool surface. This can’t be happening. The logical side of his brain is yelling at Castiel to wait the 6 to 8 months, then mate with the beast during Dean’s following rut. Yet, his heart doesn’t want to listen to reason. Cas wants his alpha now, no matter the consequences. All those months alone in this house without Dean.
The two men tumble to the sheets below, panting in near unison. Sated, gratified, total bliss, the words don’t even come close to describing Dean’s current state. So he goes with what he knows, “Fuck, Sir, that was incredible!”
“I am saddened but will abide by the limit.  If at any time, Dean, you wish to change the rule you simply have to kiss me.”
“In the cell during your…” Chuck clears his throat nervously, a blush rising on his face, “knotting. I thought it was time. That mating sickness can be a bitch.”
“An open mind about what?  I don’t want ugly dancers.  Crowley would kill me.”  Dean rubs his eyes trying to decide if this is such a good idea.
The entire point of the light on the outside is for others to check in, bring them necessary supplies.
Stress mounts on his overworked nerves as Dean inhales, blowing out the air slowly as his fingers still play the familiar tune.  Anything to distract his mind.  The elevator doors swish open, revealing Frank Devereaux carrying three laptops.
Thank you for being awesome!!  As always I adore hearing from you so drop me a comment and make my day.
Wiping away a tear, Dean replies curiously, “Don’t get me wrong; I’m thrilled we are together, but tonight was no picnic.  Forgetting the whole affair sounds great.”
Has Rowena decided Chuck’s fate?  Did she intentionally keep he and Dean in the dark so they wouldn’t stop the ceremony?  Castiel has no alternative.  If he stops, the magic will be broken and his family might take Chuck’s place.
“Don’t sass me. Your encouraging the thought Hannah will die and be reborn in the Kingdom of Heaven.” Mother Novak stalks her prey, but alas she’s an idiot.
Thank God, he always keeps a back-up knife in his boot.  Effective, but filthy.  A little blood for color is wonderful, but he truly believes there can be too much of a good thing.  Shit stinks.
The banging suddenly stops and the air is palpable as Dean tries to remind himself to breathe.  A loud whack hits the barrier, and this time it’s not a fist beating on the titanium. The intruder has moved to a large chair or hammer.   The noise is deafening and Dean can hear Claire’s screams mixed with another voice shouting just as loud.  “You stay the fuck away from my family!”
Theo and Malachi are circling close by, keeping tabs on their prey.  Dean can sense it.  All the emotional turmoil is making them vulnerable.  He would bet his soul that one of the dark hunters is crouching in the rain, watching him for any sign of weakness.  Only Dean’s eyes move as he scans the area waiting.
“First of all, …gross.  Now if I ever meet the blue-eyed Russian all I’m going to picture is you two knocking Johnsons.  Although, in a very tight second place, the guy must have some amazing restraint.  Those lips are legendary.”
“Little Red is fine.”  The female omega glides inside the house her black leather trench coat giving her the illusion of floating.  “Called for my next target and she told me an odd tale.  Had to check the facts myself because Dean Winchester giving up on the mission must be wrong.”
A rather young first-year pushes the call button, avoiding eye contact with either of them.  Dean doesn’t blame the kid; everything is new and frightening those first few months.  All omegas end up in an Omega Center after their first heat.  A family member can come collect them if they can provide documentation of ways to keep their omega sheltered from alphas during heat.  The scent of an unmated omega in heat can turn any alpha feral with lust.  Those omegas with families who can’t afford a fancy heat saferoom will spend the next five years at the center.  For some it will be a lifetime.
In a moment of concern, Ishim takes his free hand. “Don’t be frightened, little one.  Continue your charade with Castiel, and I will reward you soon.”
“No.” Dean sulks because of course he doesn’t need such things, but he’s all in tonight regardless of the stupidity of it.  “Hard limits means absolutely never, and soft limits means I might warm up to the idea with further discussion.”
His Dom pushes him out so he can shut the door on the scent murderer.  “Please, it’s not that bad once you get used to it.”
“You’ve been a very bad omega, Dean.”  His dark mahogany gaze is fiery with rage.  “To the cross with you.”
“Holy shit!” Dean has seen movies with playrooms that don’t even come close to rivaling this amazing space. “Cas this is unbelievable!”
“I’m okay with that.”  Dean presses a soft kiss to her blonde hair.  The statement is true. Dean knows the mechanics, and he trusts Castiel to take care of him.  “Cas is a good guy.”
Laughing hysterically, Dean releases the woman, crashing to the hard, cold marble.  “Pure.”  The laughter evolves into a gasping, outrageous cackle, “Why would anyone care if I had some alpha cum up my ass?  How is being pure a necessity?  Virginity is only valuable to those who see sex as a bargaining tool.  A heat is a heat. No, this is payback for ruining their precious side deal.”
The nasty weather kept the crew from hunting, so Dean is in stalker mode.  The fight that sent Meg and Cas to their own cabin was two days ago, but spending this much time away from his angel is teetering on torture.  All he’s gotten recently has been a handful of long gazes, but never a kiss, a touch, or even a smile.  Withdrawal is sweeping him into a dark void.  He can’t survive like this for much longer.  Glimpsing down, Dean’s fingers are trembling but it’s not from his wet skin.  The hunter spent breakfast yesterday begging forgiveness in the middle of the dining hall, yet he got zilch in return.  There is something deeper going on here, and the mystery is killing Dean.
Dean stands to face the alpha, a concern scent filling the air. “No, alpha.  I’m simply given a room number and told to pack my bag.  Did I do something wrong?”
Without a warning, Dean’s mouth is assaulted with Cas’s lips and talented tongue. The kiss is rough, needy and so hot.  Oxygen?  What is more important than his boyfriend sucking his tongue so deliciously that he will definitely feel it for days?  Screw oxygen.
A tender, affectionate smile flows evenly on Castiel’s face as he smears a little of the Neosporin on his pointer finger. Stretching out his hand, Castiel softly strokes Dean’s face, covering the marks.  The sting evaporates at his roommate’s touch, causing Dean to moan.  This man truly is an angel.  When he’s done, Castiel taps the scrapes, tilting his head to the side with a curious look.
The anesthesiologist tilts into his view wearing a surgical mask, “Okay Mr. Winchester I want you to think happy thoughts.”
Wishing to give the professor a well thought out answer, he thinks about the day.  All in all, he senses warmth.  People came out to revel in his life being extended.  They care about him and his future.  Letting his gaze roam over the room and the family he’s built with Cas, Dean responds, “Today was just me saying goodbye to a long year of fear and stress.  Instead of worn out, I feel excited about what comes next because I know for sure there will be a next.”
“Dick Roman’s room please.”  The angel is hoping with all his might that the jerk answers.  After two rings, his wish is granted.
“Jesus, Dean.”  Punches through the alpha, his hands tight fists.  Dean’s aware the alpha battles his hunger to fill his leaking hole.
When the coach rolls up to Eden Village, Dean’s the first one out, dashing to Rufus’s cabin.  It’s got to be mid-day but after several sharp knocks there is no answer.  “RUFUS!  Cas and Meg need your help!”
In the kitchen, the refrigerator’s doors are also wide open as it sits totally empty.  The inner light casting shadows on the wooden floor leaving just enough brightness to break sharp edges against the dark.  Nonetheless, nothing to be seen.  The white walls and clear shelves devoid of everything but the grime of its previous inhabitants.
“Shhh, I know what you crave.”  The alpha lays Dean down onto the cold, dark-hardwood floor.  A chill runs over Dean’s flesh as he curls into a ball.  The discomfort of sleeping on the harsh surface soothes Dean’s nerves.  “You will rest here, my Omega.”
Instead of a sweet sixteen party, Sam asked for diapers and baby formula from all his friends. The summer after Sammy’s sophomore year ended he became a father. The young dad put everything into caring for his daughter. In the evening, Sam would sing
“Whatever.  I was 22 and stupid.”  Dean blushes.  He can’t deny he was one hell of a twink back in the day.
“What an asshole!  Castiel’s not going to pull the wool over my eyes.”  He’d cringe at Baby’s door slamming so loudly, but fuck it.  He speeds the entire way to the mathematics building.  Dean’s never been inside, but he’s dropped and picked up Cas from the front numerous times.
His boyfriend’s head pops up with mild worry on his face.  There seems to be a serious inner battle on whether to open the door, so Dean hisses with his flinch this time to really drill in his dire need.  Finally, Cas nods, pointing to the bathroom.
“Mom, he’s a healthy alpha.”  Dean has literally perused the medical files to prove it.  He shrugs, tucking his head down. “He really likes me.”
Where is the damn bed?  Dean gives up on the dress shirt buttons, choosing to simply rip it open.  The sounds of buttons scattering across the cement floor add to the chorus of their sensual groans.  Undershirt gone.
Her bright blue eyes nearly come out of the socket with her eye roll.  “Seriously, it’s not that bad.  I’ve heard 50 Shades of Grey is worse.”
Around ten minutes to nine, the act finishes and the stage goes dark.  Dean continues to devour the spread before him.  The food is spectacular. Gadreel’s been holding out on him.  He has a brother that is Dean’s new favorite chef.
Inhaling, the omega permits the aroma of cinnamon with hazelnut coffee to fill every crack in his soul.  He’s got several.  All the times someone harmed him or treated him as nothing better than a street kid.  It left voids that Cas and his delicious scent, his loving caress and spectacular smile aided in filling, leaving Dean happy.  How will he survive when the empty space returns?
Tears fall on their own.  He swipes at the wet betrayal, hating himself for letting his emotions take over.
“Well we can stand here and complain or we can try to find at least one of the beds,” Cas suggests, wandering inside to shove balloons out the door as best he can.
“I think it was built in the ’50s, way before anyone thought about wheelchair accessibility or AC.”  Castiel doesn’t reply, simply observes intently.  His blue eyes miss nothing as the door bobbles loose on its hinges.  They take the staircase on the right heading down to the basement where his unit resides.  “All the studio efficiencies are down here.”
“Are you planning to stay and clean up said experience when it is all over the floor?”  The professor cocks one eyebrow.
His chaperone finishes chewing his bite, washing it down with water. “Well there are several answers to that question.” They both take a sip of their drinks before the younger man continues. “When we met, I was 16 and Benny was 27. I’ve lived in Beaufort my entire life. Benny worked on a yacht that docked here several times throughout the year, but of course I was too young back then for anything more than friendship.”
The two men stand in silence as dawn reaches its crest.  Even after so many months, this time of day is special to them.  Sunrise marks eternity.  Also, it reminds them of Emma’s birth three months ago.  Their omega daughter was born as sunbeams shone into the hospital room.
A stillness sweeps through the room as Dean ponders on the right word. He never partied to the point that he wasn’t clean of the stuff after a day or so; yet, he’d be lying if he said he didn’t need the dulling sensation it gave him when the past haunted him.
As he and Charlie approach the swinging lift, Dean focuses on Gadreel’s number one rule: Don’t cross your skis.  He can keep them parallel or in a pie-slice shape but crossing is bad.  It reminds the omega of Ghostbusters: Don’t cross the streams.  The beta has been skiing for years, so she holds his hand as they scooch up to the chair.
Without the presence of Joshua, the strange alpha might be doing a shanghai of his mind.  Driving Dean crazy through horrors of abuse in a dream he can’t leave.  He observes the flowing black wisps skate over the clear wall.  Each shadowy tentacle is testing for any holes.
“I don’t know, Dean.”  Tears blend with the spray from the shower, but the scent of salt stings Dean’s heart.  “I don’t know what happened after.”
His traitorous roommate bursts out laughing, catching Ruby’s attention, “Oh good, you’re back with us today, Castiel.”
“Tomorrow morning a box will arrive for you.  It will have answers, I promise.”  Sam fixes his eyes on a point behind Castiel.
Placing his nose into the crook of Dean’s neck, the omega breathes in the intoxicating bouquet of oil and leather with a hint of honey. Castiel hums at the realization that Dean’s core scent is altering too. They are mates, alpha to his omega, forever. A flood of warmth covers his skin delving deep into his very soul. The omega will never be alone again.
“Then you have no chance of rescue in an emergency.  You would either drown or be released if you’re the final competitor.”  Her normally aloof attitude becomes rigidly focused. “After the alarm cuts off you have five minutes to become familiar with the …situation.  Next, Alphas will be permitted to enter the field at their leisure.  Each alpha will be armed with a waterproof marker.  They get points by marking you with their personal color, more marks, more points.”
“May I have some time with Gabriel and Dean alone please?”  Cas’s hand holds his brother’s limp one.
The alpha is stunned as Dean practically leaps from his seat, planting his lips over Castiel’s. The kiss is rough, but tender as their tongues eventually find a pace that is even and sturdy.  The young father immediately notices the taste of a sweet candy on his tongue.  It’s stimulating to all his senses as Castiel releases a moan from his throat.  Dean’s hands card through his dark, wavy hair rubbing his temple, making his muscles go slack.
“The one and only,” he adds.  There is something predatory in the guy’s gaze, although it takes Dean a second to notice the blazing eyes are not for the only omega in the room.  Nope Crowley’s glaring past Dean towards Hannah.  Hmmm, a very interesting twist indeed.  At least now Dean understands why Hannah got all dolled up.  Twirling back, he notes Hannah’s scalding gaze in return.  Yep, he’s got his own entertainment right here.
He would rather take a couple more turns on the brutal course, adding more bruises to the blossoming beauties throughout his body by sloshing through mud, climbing over uneven logs, getting elbows to the face, being pelted with sticks from the other omegas, swinging across plummeting drops with harsh hand-ripping ropes, and sprinting until he felt his knees give way. He doesn’t have a clue where the wickedly bleeding injury came from. The fucker just happened. Instead he must clean up to …meet alphas.
“Lunch time!” One of the Ruby’s shouts from the hall.  The sound shaking them both from the bubble of silence they had created.  Before he can say another word, Cas launches himself from the room, but heads in the direction of the media room.
Before Castiel can reply, Dean is standing as he removes his boots and every stitch of clothes. Then its suddenly like Christmas, his birthday, and the fucking Fourth of July all wrapped into one moment. His Omega is breathtaking.  Dean’s skin has a hint of tan, and his cock is much larger than Castiel would have suspected; perhaps there is something to Gabriel’s comment.  Oh wait, the young father realizes that Dean asked a question and he needs to answer instead of gawking at his dick.  “She was a beta who felt the scenting ritual was unnecessary and a little gross.”
Gabe slaps the Alpha’s shoulder, “Welcome to a town full of Omega’s.  Secrets have a much looser definition here.  If you think about it, having the town watching for Duma can be a positive thing.”
Castiel shakes his head, “Please excuse the man you are about to meet.  My brother Gabriel has no manners and finds making me uncomfortable his favorite pastime.  If it helps, he was adopted.”
The words settle in his soul.  He drifts off to the loving coos of his Alpha and cuddles of all the exposed skin.  Falling deeper into sleep coincides with plunging further into his resolve.  Dean Winchester’s ready.
Everyone immediately turns and glares at his roommate, and it makes Dean’s stomach churn. He observes in horror as Castiel pulls his feet up, attempting to make himself smaller.  A tiny whine gradually grows in volume from Cas’s chest.  The sound of that gravelly, deep voice screaming in pain fills Dean’s ears, and he can’t take another second of discomfort.
A fire burns behind blue eyes as the professor holds him still by a look alone. “I will never harm you.”
“How are father and mother?”  He’s not sure if asking is appropriate, his Dean being the one to set off the actions that led to Chuck’s de-throning.
Suddenly the omega is overwhelmed with all the possibilities. He doesn’t know where to begin so he asks the one question that has been burning a hole in his heart.
“Not today,” she steps away, giving herself a calming breath. “Doesn’t matter, you have someone waiting for you.”  Her nose scrunches on the second inhale. “Damn it.  Shower first though.  Only a complete dumbass hangs with an omega in heat on a trial day?”
On the other side of the vehicle, Sam kisses Gabriel goodbye. The two still haven’t made the final plunge into mating, but Cas suspects it will be quite soon. Gabriel stares up at the younger Winchester like he’s the omega’s sole purpose for existing. Castiel knows the feeling.
“Seriously, man.  You are not making a lick of sense.  If he wants me, why shouldn’t I let him blow me.  The chemistry between us is utterly insane.”
“She couldn’t birth a child.  The trip to Savannah, which led to the production of the amulet, was paid for by her Alpha, Ishim.  The asshole would do anything for grandchildren.  Guess who was on the phone with her five minutes before her swan song?”
Without warning Dean’s manhandled by the alpha till he’s on his back looking up at intense, fiery blue eyes.  “Isn’t my apple bouquet enough?”
“Hey, Dean, do you have a minute?”  Nurse Kelly pauses in the doorway, her yellow scrubs an odd contrast to the gloomy day.
Warmth builds in Dean’s chest as he links their hands together, never wanting to let go.  Using his tongue Dean traces the letters
Grasping Gadreel’s shoulder with a squeeze Dean promises, “I will do ya one better, Gadreel. Castiel’s happiness will always be my ultimate goal but also his hope for tomorrow.  Without hope, it’s harder to make it through the darkness alive.  I know this first hand.”
“Cas?  You here?” He shuts the door when a stunning floral scent suddenly battles with the sunblock.
Two seconds later Crowley yelps, “Yes!” as he dashes out of the room, mumbling about tea.  Dean and Claire laugh so hard Cas asks, “Can you two breathe at all?  This can’t be healthy.”
“In my defense, it took longer than anticipated and we were working on a time crunch.”  Gabriel huffs covering his groin with both his hands, “NO, okay no I didn’t think about it until after the gown was on its way to Castiel.  Why?”
“I made pie for a pre-dinner treat,” Castiel hums, sinking his pointer finger into the center of the treat and licking it clean. “Can I feed it to you?”
Cas slips his fingers through Dean’s, lacing them together.  “I want you, my Omega.  However, I will not make the decision for you.  A claim is eternal.”
“Absolutely not, you are not violent.  Jesus, you basically hallucinate a happier world than the one we are in, which isn’t a bad thing.  Give the girls some hope.”
“Shut up, Charlie, I’m not even your type,” Dean grumbles as Andrea finishes her placement of his interview ensemble.
With one swipe of his eyes, Dean has noticed at least two cameras with microphones. Clearly the meetings with friends and families are monitored.
His flying ball of light buzzes by to observe the masses. Eventually, Meg yawns, returning to her spot in his pocket.
Castiel shouts as Dean approaches “Bobby, if you could man the speaker system please.”  Bobby was able to weasel out of the dancing part of the ball claiming old age.  Crowley agreed, simply because someone needed to focus on the music.  “I want everyone to stand along the wall and watch for the first song.  Pay particular attention to the style you chose.  Dean and Sam will be dancing the masculine while Meg and myself will be performing the feminine role.”  Cas snatches Dean’s hands, placing them in the air.  The hunter is frozen, he’s never touched his angel beyond his hands.  Clearly, in a matter of seconds that is all about to change.  If Castiel has any trepidation over the new position, he doesn’t show it.  His face is serious and focused, just as a proper instructor should be.  However, as the group moves to find a spot on the wall, Cas tilts in whispering, “It’s okay, I can do this, don’t be nervous.”  Dean finds his shoulders relaxing at his angels words.  Fuck, if Cas can’t read him like a book.  “Okay Bobby, when I nod my head press play.”
“Families are rough,” Dean comments. He and Sam used to have blow-ups every time they were in the same room; however, his brother’s last few visits have been very chill.  Recently, Sam told Dean he was proud of him for taking this seriously.  Dean tries not to dwell on how much that means to him.
A beautiful blush splatters across Castiel’s face.  “A possible side effect of the alpha suppressant.”
The night sky hangs above them, allowing Dean to see the glowing light of the town first.  Even in the dark he can make out several full-size homes of varying shapes and colors, not a boring shade among them.  Fairies do love bright shiny things.  As he and Cas enter the village, Dean notices smaller houses ranging from right at six feet down to tinier than his shoe.  Little log cabins hang from the trees, swaying in the breeze.  The town must hold fairies of all types.
“Yeah,” the blonde omega supplies, “Harry and I mated twins.  They are the gatekeepers for the entrance to Purgatory.”
Castiel loves his sister, but she has a very crass side that he does not enjoy. She needs to watch her tone or he will make it difficult for her to speak.  The sassy red head drops her smile as she returns his deep dark gaze.  “Of course, I will make this happen.  Now can you please release my hand?  I fear you may break it.”
Castiel’s breath hitches in his throat.  It takes some effort to exhale, “I actually needed to hear that.”
Texas in June is brutal even at 9:30 in the morning.  Pushing a wheelchair while juggling an excited puppy who has no training on a leash is a new level of hell.  Sweat drips from every pore on Dean’s body.  He pauses every block to give Gabe, along with the puppy, a sip of water.
Immediately Dean is pulled down onto Cas’s lap as the sub embraces him. He almost loses his drink in the process, but prevails. His dom rocks him like a small child as Dean continues to rehydrate. Kisses rain down on the sub’s forehead, cheeks neck, and ears.
Sliding the key into the ignition, Dean pauses, twisting to face the passenger.  “We don’t need to head over there.”  The craptastic hellhole he calls an apartment should never be graced by the presence of Dr. Novak.  They just finished lunch at the Roadhouse, so he’s hoping for an alternate destination.  “What do you usually do on Saturday afternoons?  We can do that.”
“I should see if I need to help.  Later.”  The giant man pauses, as if he should do something before exiting hastily.
“If you want out, I can drop you off in Galway.  No need to go any farther unless you are 100% sure.”  Castiel’s tone is stern.  This is not playtime; his entire family’s safety hangs in the balance.  If they mess this up, any survivors will come after Dean; that will not happen.
All Dean can think about is how hard it must be on Gabriel to keep his shit together. His brother’s are shattered images of what they could be, and there is nothing he can do but try to make their lives a little brighter.  It’s probably why he’s always cracking jokes.  The guy must be exhausted.
Dean covers his eyes with his hands, shouting, “Sign the marriage license and give it to Sam after the wedding.”
“Pants, Alpha, let’s not justify the flasher look.”  Chuckling softly, Dean watches as Castiel slips on boxers and a pair of jeans.  Then he gives Cas a big thumbs up as he disappears behind the military grade door.
Hope you enjoyed the chapter.  Thanks for reading and as always I live for your wonderful comments and questions.
With his long sleeves, most of Dean’s body art remains hidden; however, the two tattoos on his neck are visible: a weaving noose crawls up his right side, while an antique colt revolver rests on the left. Flashing the stranger a sassy faux smile, he tries again, “I just want to know where I landed so when I get my phone call, I can tell my dad where to pick me up.”
It becomes painfully obvious when the horrid odor smacks into his Omega’s nostrils.  Dean’s arms come flying out to push away the vile bag.  Thank goodness he was prepared.  Hastily, Castiel zips each individual baggie closed and snatches Dean, rushing him back to the bed.
“Yes, Princess, Daddy’s upset.  I got some bad news and it’s made me sad, but the magical green Jell-O is making it better.”
Dean tucks the cards in his wallet next to his clothes, and then makes a beeline for the toilet because damn it, he really has to go now.
Without a word, the sub removes his clothes, folding them neatly and placing them on a chair in the corner of the room. Once he’s naked, Dean drops to his knees in front of Cas. The dom is sitting on the edge of the bed with a black lacquer box on his lap.
He stays on Castiel’s back as the man attempts to pour a glass of water.  “Hey, we let Emma open one gift on Christmas Eve.  Maybe, we should do the same for birthdays?”
Dean glimpses at Cain. The sober companion flinches from Sam’s attitude; perhaps the youngest Winchester has taken a detour in the conversation.
“Yes,” Dean grins, pressing his mouth to Castiel’s neck for open-mouth kisses.  “However, let’s talk about the kiddos later.  I think we need some adult time.”
A bright moon shines through the window pane, illuminating the room along with the roaring fire.  Autumn has brought biting cold nights with it.  Castiel pushes against the rocking chair, the scratch of wood the sole noise in their bedroom.  Dean stands before the mirror inspecting his changing body.  At eleven weeks the tiniest of bumps marks the growth of their heir.
The sun is peaking through the blinds of his bedroom windows. It’s not quite 7:00am, but Cas is too excited to go back to sleep. Castiel misses his daughter desperately, and spending time with the littlest Winchester has helped to fill a painful void. Accompanying Meg to the Fall Festival today will be a sweet elixir to his lonely soul. It’s been a little over three years since he’s seen Claire. One day in the near future, he will get to hold his own flesh and blood but for now, he waits.
Obeying, Cas kicks off his shoes and socks, rolling up the legs of his dress pants.  As they walk he observes the horizon, wishing he could simply whisk his mate far, far away from here.
Using his liberated hands, Dean encourages Cas to drape across his torso.  The weight amazing and reassuring.  Safe.  Love.  Always.
“Well shit, I didn’t pay attention.”  Benny growls.  However, exactly thirty seconds after the last chant, they hear it again.
Lifting his head like he can see his driver, Kevin replies, “There is only one reason she’s not watching TV.”
“Listen very carefully to me, Castiel. When I ran with Claire, I did a lot of research on exactly this type of scenario.”
“You are right.”  Castiel’s heart shreds into tiny pieces.  Not unlike the one he found under the dining room table.  “Please, Dean forgive me.  I should have called Jody or Donna or you to come get me from the house.  It was late and we were all exhausted.  I wasn’t thinking.”
The connection goes black.  Dean signs off, shuts down the laptop and puts the cement lid back into place.  He drives the Corvette over the cubbyhole, then drops his head to the steering wheel.  If anyone on the planet can track down Roman’s whereabouts it's God.  The guy didn’t get the codename for funsies.
“It’s a night club that Crowley owns in SoHo. It’s perfect, small with an awesome dance floor.” She chews on her straw for a second then adds, “We should go shopping for new outfits.”
“I’ll do it.”  Rowena calls from the doorway.  “Whoever I find will cooperate; I can promise you.”  She stalks off in a long white silk robe with matching slippers; heels of course.
He obeys, scooting over to the passenger side. Castiel lets his gaze wander while Dean drives slowly, one hand on the wheel, the other holding Castiel’s. The omega frowns in confusion when they pass the turn that heads to their home. His alpha squeezes his hand in a reassuring gesture. Cas leans further into the seat, knowing the older man has a plan and Castiel will always trust that. After taking an unknown gravel road, they pull up to the barn near their backyard. Dean climbs out of the vehicle first, motioning for the omega to follow.
“Are you going to tell Dean about my walk?” The omega wrings his hands together, finding the digits explicitly interesting.
Totally catching her dismissal, Dean stumbles out of the classroom, his head to full of conflicting emotions and his nostrils overwhelmed with just as many odors.  He collides with the Academics teacher, both men stumbling to the floor.
“Fairies aren’t really the 'sharing with other races' type,” Max shrugs, “they won’t even let outsiders watch the birth of their children.”
“What kind of heathen would treat you like a chair?”  Dean mumbles to himself as he searches for a bucket.
The sun is up, spilling late morning light through the blinds of the small window.  “If you don’t sleep in a bed, then I don’t.”
“Botanical Gardens display.” Castiel’s gaze widens as he takes in the beauty. “I’ve dreamt of coming here to visit but the crowds, the noise and chaos kept me away. How did you get a quiet moment with the Spring show?”
Castiel’s breath catches in his throat as the doctor moves the wand around looking for just the right spot. He kisses Dean’s cheek taking his hand. “What do you think my love? More than one?”
From inside his mind, Dean answers, but his mouth remains quiet.  He doesn’t want to move; in doing so he starts the beginning of the end.  Castiel tries again, his fingers stroking Dean’s face, “I am here, please, Dean, say something.”
“Not saying I’m against long walks in the park selecting rabbit food, but I need to pick up my baby at lunch time.”  Dean adds to the stack, considering how he can work it into Cas’s scheduled trip.  Even someone with his IQ realizes the importance of a strict timetable to his host.
“Charlie!” Cas hisses, “Gabriel and Sam need some space to themselves for a while. Poor Donna doesn’t want to hear their mating dance.”
The younger omega moves back at being yelled at in the face.  “Okay, fine, but even with your mate present, it’s important to have another omega in the room.  Dean, you and I are the only mortal omegas in the castle.  We should support each other.”
“A date? Nobody dates omegas Dean.” Secretly, Cas is reveling in the idea of a date. Just like he’s seen in the movies and on TV. “That’s for betas and alphas.”
Dean’s never moved faster before the ass crack of dawn.  He’s dressed in his warm clothes chewing on some dried fruit and jerky a few minutes later.  Of course, his alpha doesn’t forget the tea.
A blinding burst of stars explodes under his eyelids.  Blowing his load, the Omega shouts, “Thank you, Sir.”
Garth shrugs, accepting the change in direction, “There was a strict religious group that lived on this very land for over fifty years called ‘The Heavenly Hosts’. They held the belief that they were descendants of actual living angels. Children who were born to members were given angelic names by their leader, Michael.”
The team’s location producer, Balthazar, tuts, “I may be the oldest here, but I will outlive you all.”  His thick British accent slurred by the copious amounts of alcohol. This is their one day off a week, so they tend to spend it drunk.  Over the past few years, Dean has become fairly close to the crew that follows him around several months during the year.  Kevin was just out of college when he took the job as their camera operator, and Ash is a whiz with electronics, making him an excellent sound guy.  The team has slowly become a family.  In fact, the five of them did this exact same thing the night of his father’s funeral.
Jack’s slipping his chubby fingers into Hannah’s mouth as it drops to match Dean’s.  “No, no I’m sorry.  Damn it, I’ve completely messed this up.”  Tears are leaking from the woman’s eyes as she hiccups.  “Please, don’t ever think we would take advantage of you.  No, no, no, no.”
An hour later, the six person kitchen table is full.  Claire is at the head in her high chair, pushing pieces of pancake around.  Bobby sits at the other end, his head down, shoveling his food hastily.  Dean and Castiel sit on one side while Gabriel and Sam round out the seats.  The only sound is mumbles of gratitude and happy slurping.  Dean has a bowl of fruit and two pieces of bacon on his plate.  The alpha releases a sigh of relief because he started with five.
Removing his backpack, Dean opens the main compartment, retrieving the rope.  He hastily unzips his snowsuit, slipping the loaded dart gun into the holster, then the Omega scales the tree.  Ever since he was a child Dean Winchester loved to climb anything he saw as a challenge.  He also wanted to be a Cowboy.  God, he and Sam would play Cowboys for hours chasing imaginary cows and lost horses.  Lassos are easy.  Using the loop to snag the chimney takes several tries and a few cuss words.  He ties the open end around the trunk of the tree for support.
“Exactly, sweet girl.  Imagine having someone use you to their liking, you have no say, no choice.  Their every whim is your future.  Now, my lovely little omegas, take it one step further.  Until you are mated and your mind links with that alpha, you are completely vulnerable to the inklings of disgusting humans who have watched you on TV.  They only need your image to hunt down your dreamscape.”
“Oh, yes, Benny was worried that Dean would ask what you got, so we bought you an actual gift that should help shut your alpha up fast.”
“Witchy things actually, which require me to be in this location for another,” she glances at her phone, “72 minutes.”
The passenger bounces his head side to side, “The MacLeods keep me from falling into my bad behaviors.”
“It is better when a trained psychiatric nurse challenges my hallucinations.  Whereas forcing you to play that role could damage our relationship; you need to be my supportive loved one, not my nurse.”  Cas picks at his nails, avoiding Dean’s face.  “I am clear headed today; maybe he can come back tomorrow.”
The older man returns to his ministrations as Dean’s muscles ache with the need to move. Wails build louder and wilder as Cas adds his hand to the task and shit that’s all it takes for the sub to cum hard, into Novak’s beautiful mouth.
There is no doubt in Dean’s mind that this woman was raised by Gabriel. They may not all share the same DNA, but her loyalty to their band of eight is just as strong, which means he needs to heed her warnings.
Dean chuckles when Castiel retrieves a note from the pocket on his shirt. Never doubt his angel’s power to anticipate his every need.  Grinning like a fool, he accepts the piece of paper, reading it.
“Aye, aye, Captain.” She snatches the items, then her hazel eyes triple in size when she spots the remaining outfit.  “Oh my God, has Dean seen this?”
“You shouldn’t talk to unfamiliar people.”  Dean cages him against the wall with those powerful arms his voice threatening.  Castiel is battling to stave off hyperventilating.  “It can be dangerous.”
“No, no.” He can almost hear Kevin waving his hands frantically. “Winchester Ranch has been the safest home I’ve ever had. It was the school I went to, they had a traditional approach to omega behavior training. What was your place like?”
The younger man can barely speak his voice shaking, “Cracked her head. There is a lot of… blood. She’s not… conscious.”
“You will be an unmated Omega without an Alpha guardian.  I know the side effects can be rough, but so can the alternative on the outside.”  Ash pauses to glare with concern.  “Without suppressants to block your sweet sugar cookie scent no one will let you rent an apartment or give you a job.  I don’t want to remind you what happens to us on the streets.”
The gorgeous blue eyes are sparkling under the shadows of Jack’s nightlight.  “I have lived in this house for years; it wasn’t a home until you arrived.  Suddenly, people were discovering their place under our roof.  Sam’s found redemption, Emma a future, Jack a safe beginning, and me, I observe it all marveling at the love you share with all those around you.  Even Meg has a smile.  Why in the world would you think we wouldn’t have room for one more?”
“You really are the essence of innocence and virginity.” Pamela chuckles over her response. Then scents Castiel, “Actually, you’ve been up to some fun yourself. That million dollar purity scent is less potent lately.”
“Alright, girls.”  Dean claps his hands enthusiastically.  “Loud noises and wild actions scare Portia.  Whoever sits on the couch without a sound gets to hold her.”
Their bodies mesh against each other as the angel tugs them down to the mattress below with a thud.  Dean doesn’t have the willpower for fucking, so he slots his cock against Castiel’s, grinding them together.  The intoxicating sensation of every thrust of their hips adds to Dean’s building orgasm.  The two lover’s release their tongues, as if they have a mind of their own.
“Dude, what rock have you been living under?  Scent claiming papers are only valid for one year after your first heat.  After that, any alpha can claim you, unless the state reassigns you to a work detail like I have here at Winchester Ranch.  But an alpha can still mate me; they just have to buy the ranch a new omega.”
Moments later Castiel notices he’s awake and sits on the edge of the lounge chair handing Jack off to Meg.
Everyone is anxious for Dorothy and Adam to return from their trip to Europe.  It seems that Interpol does not take two tiny omegas as any kind of threat; therefore, Adam stepped up to personally search and ruffle some feathers until Lillith and Hael are found and returned to Savannah.  Dorothy is traveling as the Winchester family house omega, but of course, really she’s the muscle behind the hunt.  Castiel hates to not do it himself, but leaving Dean for weeks is not an option.
“Since you have such a vast knowledge of science I thought we could start with baking, which is basically chemistry with edible results.”
“Take me away.” His throat is dry making his voice raspy. “I want only you. Take me to a place where only you exist.”
“No, how rude of me. Of course, Dean, rest.  I will be here when you wake.”  There is a softness to the alpha's gaze that comforts the omega as he drifts off.  His mind is twisting the actual question over and over: Did you give me the birth control?
Shaking his head, Dean looks between the other two omegas. “Nope, except for maybe a trip to the Appalachian Trail.”
A particularly wicked siren wails as two red lights twirl next to the massive hatch.  Elbows, fists, and palms shove the party forward pressing them against the huge door measuring a good twelve feet wide.  Asmodeus yells something from his perch, but Dean can’t hear.  The screams from those being flattened against the walls reach migraine levels.
His bodyguard remains by the door.  Obviously poised to strike if any of those tawdry Hellions attempt to leap into the room.  After a few bites, Dean’s going to require a distraction to force feed himself.
Castiel tightens his hold on the towel around his waist, chucking his chin towards the ensemble laid on the mattress. “I need to get into that and maybe a few suggestions for,” he coughs, having trouble finishing the sentence, “…positions.”
He has nothing left to give so he just lets himself soar. Castiel slows to a more affectionate pace, his hands untying Dean’s arms and legs. With his new found freedom, the sub wraps his weak limbs around the older man. He feels like a rag doll just flopping with each thrust from Cas.
“Bruises on his neck.”  The beta’s face goes sour.  “Dean disappears.  He’ll be gone for two to four days and sometimes when he returns there are injuries.  The ones he has now aren’t even close to the worst of it.  I have never asked for an explanation.”
Castiel waves from where he and Charlie have chosen for their next exploration.  With a smile Dean returns the gesture, fixing his sunglasses as his gaze spots Benny and Cain chatting on the back lounge area of the boat.  An afternoon of sun, water, and nowhere to be is exactly what this family needs.  It’s been three days since Charlie arrived, and the accomplice remains anonymous.  The request for a day on the sea from the redheaded omega was brilliant.  Tensions are building with each passing day that Cas and Charlie come up empty from their vigilant searching.
Mrs. Macleod’s head leans to the side in a very Novak image.  “Gabriel mentioned you two were living in Castiel’s house.”
Marv scoffs, “That’s plain stupid. It’s not like he’s the one raising the kid.  Uncle’s get to do the fun stuff, then hand them over when they’re crying and shit.”
“Since we have a new patient on the floor, I thought we could all introduce ourselves to him,” Garth announces.
“Dinner!”  Hannah calls, setting a massive pot roast down on the dining room table.  “Can someone go get Rowena?”
Garth chuckles. “Yeah, once the baby arrives taking care of Gabriel will have seemed like a holiday.”
The tall, lanky 16-year-old straightens his back, attempting to look confident, not really accomplishing anything other than a mild expression of constipation.  Sam speaks stoically, “Max and I should go alone.  You can tell us about the path Cas gave you, and we can save him. Purgatory is no place for a pregnant omega.”
Castiel fucking Novak struts out.  He doesn’t run or even sway; he walks with purpose as he takes his spot on the stage.  One finger starts at Cas’s groin, grinding up the exposed torso to his mouth where the little turd licks the top with a shit-eating smirk.  Dean can’t stop himself; he’s on his feet and in front of his mate in seconds.
A dark cloud materializes, blocking Dean’s sunrays.  The shade annoys the omega, yet the change intrigues him.  He’s learned dreamweavers have control over all their domain. Dean wasn’t creating the world he shared with Castiel, instead his alpha would seek out his desires and match them.  Which means one of two things: Joshua thinks a bit of shade necessary or Stormy Alpha has returned.
“No Charlie, that is a last resort.  My brother dedicated his adult life to Angel Computers; I can’t fail him.”  Castiel places his forehead against the cool glass.  There is a high chance that his head will now have black dry eraser marker across it, but the alpha’s too tired to care.
“I might be able to,” Dean can literally watch the mouthful of wine travel down the beautiful throat, “connect you with an employer who is in need of your skills.  The first job is usually an unpaid audition, but if you consented to multiple assignments, we might be able to negotiate a signing bonus of sorts.  Hannah’s vouching for you which never happens, her name alone opens a lot of doors in Dallas.”
“Alright, but you stay in your room until one of your uncles arrives.”  Dean’s gaze catches the door opposite to Ben and Henry’s room.  “And don’t wake your sisters.”  The words barely leave his mouth when the bright yellow door flings open.
The scent expert slams a pair of shoes against the wall.  “I never loved my job.  All the shady dealings, but I had enough pull to keep omegas out of abusive or horrific conditions.  Gabriel kept me informed as to who would not be a healthy match.  But today I resemble a backstreet omega doll pimp.”
“I’m not going to fight with you today, but I am going to thank you for the written testimony. You didn’t have to do it and I …thanks.” Dean kicks the carpet with his running shoe, not sure what else there is to say. The teacher helped save his ass; how do you properly thank someone for that?
The carriage is open, and Dean gives one final wave before disappearing inside, pulling the curtains.  He gave them their moment; now he gets his.
“Remember, when we drove all the way to Dallas because Aunt Hannah’s brain was sick?”  Dean scoots closer swallowing her mini fingers in his palm.
Dean’s touched Cas’s knot and he has definitely felt it inside him, but he’s never had the chance to simply stare at his alpha’s cock.  Here on his knees, Dean’s in the best possible location for further research.  Reaching out tentatively, Dean uses the tip of his pointer finger to follow a rather thick vein from root to tip.
“I know it wouldn’t be a real claim …I need something to take with me.  Everything outside this room is going to hell as the bastard stalker hunts me like an animal.  It’s not permanent, but it's you on me.”
“Dr. Jody Mills.  Do you have any questions, Dean?  I can take a moment to help clarify any worries.”
Strolling to the front of the classroom, Rowena picks up a purple dry-erase marker, scrawling out three words:
Castiel stands, stripping off his clothes and wrapping a matching loin cloth over his own groin.  Dean squints curiously. “What are you doing, Cas?”
“Why?  Seriously, what did he do?”  Dean stands screaming at the other omega.  “And it’s not my family.”
The orgasm rips through his body like a fucking freight train. Dean swears he passed out for a minute, but when he returns to the living, Castiel is still assaulting his cock with no mercy. In fact, the sub is pretty certain a third finger has been added in his backdoor.
The driver whips his head around whining, “I didn’t hit it. I swear to God the goat just flopped over.”
The sound of feet padding on the dirt gives the omega a warning.  Dean hastily scrambles up the closest tree, appreciative of all the time he spent on the ropes.  Once he’s hidden elevated in the green foliage, Dean adjusts his spot to get a nice view.
“No.  Do you need a paper bag?”  She leans against the house, her leather jacket and black jeans hugging all those glorious curves.
A noisy crack of someone stepping on a fallen branch alerts Dean to the intruders.  He shakes off the veil of sleep.  Cas lies motionless next to him.  Dean checks for breathing before listening to the strangers standing just beyond the bushes.  It’s not Benny and Sam, the scents aren’t right, although mysteriously familiar.
“My apologies, I had my heat and was forced indoors for the duration.”  Castiel rests against the wood panels, watching the bees while speaking with his friend.  “How have you been?”
“That I would be his omega.”  A few tears trail down her cheeks. “You’re right, Castiel. We met several times while Dick was …playing with Dean.  He flirted with me, made me feel special, so I gave him my phone number.  About a month after Dean was injured, Dick called me asking if I wanted to play a game with him.”
Ah!  Word of his door art has hit the fifth-years.  Giving the other omega a slap on the shoulder, Dean sighs. “Don’t really care.  Some people are taking the whole ranking thing way too seriously.”
Releasing a fiendish grin, the alpha moves to the right nipple giving it the same attention.  Once again the poor Omega is completely undone by Castiel’s touch.  The older mate wanders his mouth to the swell of his mate’s abdomen.  The father places tender kisses to the area murmuring, “I love you both.”
The words were said to Meg, but in reality, he includes Dean in that statement. Taking his boyfriend on this trip is a double-edged sword. After a few deep breathes, a gentle hand pats his shoulder, and then pries his fingers away from his face so her words are his only focus.
She grins, pulling down her collar to reveal a bite.  “I wear a heavy scent deodorant.  It helps in my line of work to not be sending your emotions into the room when the focus needs to be on the client.  I do have a bite, yet I am unable to mate my Love.  She is also an Alpha.”
He knows the answer because it was a huge deal the night Johnny was born.  “The night of my first heat with you,” Dean’s voice going softer, “when we conceived Johnny.  It’s visible during the months I was pregnant and will putter out right after his birthday.”
“Okay.” He answers. It’s a lie, of course he has no intention of ever opening that door, forcing himself to face what happened the complete and total rejection from his alpha.
“Touché.” Shrugging off the realization that even Dean knew Gabe did at some point fuck Hester, Gabriel flips on the electric razor, taming the beast of a beard he’s got going.  Dean notices the razor and asks, “Hey, how did you get that?”
There are several things that Dean finds disturbing about these texts. Why in the hell would Dr. Shurley drive him home? Did the dude just stumble onto Dean dozing on the pavement? Also, if he was so wasted that he has no memory of the events, then how in the world did he have the wherewithal to type responses to Sam’s texts. It was odd, like almost creepy.
This has been happening a lot.  Dean’s never had sex outside of a scene with an alpha, a beta sure, sometimes even a female omega for a laugh.  He seems to be tossing out all the rules for the blue-eyed alpha breathing heavily below him.  Dean’s okay with it.
The fairy flutters to the center of the room and motions for him to stand next to her.  He does without question because Dean trusts very few people and Meg is on the list.
“If you are in agreement, I would like you to lift your shirt so I may place my palm to your stomach.”  Joshua smiles tenderly.
Dean cups his lover's chin guiding the alpha’s lips to his own.  The kiss is tender, their tongues finding comfort in the simple brush strokes.  The omega breaks the moment, “I love you, Cas.”
Complying with the officer, Dean slides out, waiting by the tailgate as the sheriff grabs something from his SUV.  Without a word, the man holds out a tiny breathalyzer, and Dean gives it a nice long blow.
Dean pauses in his packing to focus on his omega, the alpha’s eyes completely dripping in adoration. “My little omega, I really wish I could just blow off this conference and spend the week locked in our room, but this is extremely important. Laws and regulations for oil ownership, collection, and distribution will be reviewed. I have to go. Any other time I would say yes, you have to believe me, but this is like the one big oil summit that I have no choice but to attend.”
His least favorite client at the moment interrupts him, “No, no Dean, I said you will pick them out.  Not Charlie, not a service, not even jolly green giant over here.  You, Dean Winchester, will visit the club personally and choose our entertainers.”
“Dee, you have kept me safe and loved my entire life, now it’s my turn.” Meg tilts forward placing a sweet, innocent kiss to his lips. “You need me.”
With the curtains open, Dean gets a spectacular view of the stars as they shine brightly.  The center is somewhere in Kansas, but far enough away from any city that all they see out the windows is miles of green broken only by the cement walls keeping anyone out.  One positive to the challenges is he’ll be air lifted to a disclosed location to perform the trials with any interested alphas.
He lets himself hold her longer than necessary.  Dean’s desperate to be reminded he’s not alone, especially with Castiel being a no-show recently.  “Go to class.  I got a pass for the day, so I’ll catch up with you at lunch.”
“I will never want anyone but you, Dean.” The two men embrace, holding tight for several minutes. “I am yours forever.”
Again he watches his phone, begging for it to ring.   “How long do you think it will take to deal with Daphne?”
“Silly Kitten, of course there will be rules, but the house laws will help to keep other doms away from you.”
His lungs seize as Dean struggles to breath.  Every inhale is like swallowing nails; he doesn’t let the throbbing stop him.  He will never yield.  Blind, Dean lashes out with his fingers scratching at the world to remind himself he’s real.
WARNING:  I added a tag.  References to past rape.  It's only a couple sentences about Meg's interactions with Dick Roman.
street.  It’s a six block walk, but once he’s on, it’s a straight shot to Lisa’s.  Their arrangement is peculiar, and Sam gives his older brother grief for it constantly, but never enough to make Dean end it.  One day he will find the strength to be with someone for real, but currently Lisa needs the cash, and the eldest Winchester needs a female to fuck without any ties.  When Dean was 25 he met Lisa at a Starbuck’s near his apartment.  He asked her out, she said yes and they started dating immediately.  The traditional definition of their relationship lasted almost two years.  Then in a moment of weakness, Dean glanced a little too long at a man’s ass and she knew, but instead of breaking up with him, she just altered the rules.
“Oh for fuck's sake!  Shut up bitch.”  Dean goes to hang up the phone, and he swears he hears a soft “jerk” in reply.
By the time they reach the bottom, Dean’s completely lost the feeling in his fingers and face, but such a small price for one hell of an exhilarating ride.  He puts his boots into the snow, bringing the sled to halt just behind Hannah’s.  He totally let her win.
Scrunching his nose, the professor counters, “I do not wish to sleep on them.  They would get soggy and possibly cause an ear infection.”
“From this moment until the conclusion of the final Hunter Challenge you have a right to speak to and see me.  If you need anything, simply announce to a teacher, coach, or trial official that you must speak to your caseworker.  No one can deny my access to you.  Ever.  Understand?”
Amara suggested Dean have an open conversation with Cas about mating.  Neither of them has anywhere to be so might as well take the leap.  “Hey, can I ask you something?”
Dean remains standing, too nervous to sit as Cas kneels down, putting the sub’s socks and shoes on for him. He doesn’t really think anything of it until Jo raises a questioning eyebrow at him. Dean simply grunts, “Whatever,” and lets Castiel finish.
The fairy hovers over Dean’s head, saluting the alpha before flittering over to Hannah’s shoulder.  It’s not ideal, but Meg can make herself scarce.  Dean knows that from personal experience.
“Okay so what was the plan?  I mean how do they steal everything?”  Dean’s trying to figure out how to turn this information into an advantage.
“A symbol, a special claim of my own creation, mystically locks the many souls within your Castiel.  Find a way to remove the,” the grey-haired man winks, “mark of Cain and I’m positive one of the multitude of exorcism spells will be successful, but be careful with the kickback.  The darker personalities won’t be happy with the change of scenery because you’ll be sending them back to hell.”
“Dean.” He gently rocks his lover, hoping to wake him from a bad dream. Dean's often plagued by them.
Stopping to readjust permits soft, delicate fingers to wrap around his chin forcing, him to meet kind blue eyes. “I promise the instant we are safely in the cabin I will give you what you crave.”
“Maybe,” he’s too tired to argue, not with Charlie anyway. “Dude, no snot on the merchandise.  Alphas will pay good money for this.”
He’s gotta give Nora a shit ton of credit.  The young woman doesn’t even lift her eyes from the volume in front of her.  “True.  Lucifer doles out the sentence cast down; however, you are missing one giant piece of the puzzle.”  Only then does Nora turn to glare down at Lilith.  “Michael is the law of Heaven.  I think I’m perfectly okay with you tattling.”
The proud hunter thumps his head against the harsh wall behind him.  “No matter how terrifying this is, I still want him, warts and all.”
A terrible chill cascades down Castiel’s spine.  His lungs spasm, forcing a rough cough from the alpha’s lips.  Naomi will be forced to command Dean to mate Ishim; Cas’s worst nightmare coming to fruition.  He’s unable to inhale.
He does his best, the omega’s head booms with pain adding to the burning, aching and all-around agony going on below the belt.
, he has no idea what his face is doing. He’s probably being so obvious - but he wills himself to relax. So what if she can tell just by looking at him that he’s having a big gay crisis? This is why he came to Charlie in the first place. He doesn’t have to worry for one second that she’s judging him.
“I’m… pretty good, actually. It’s not every day you get to relive a plot from your favorite show,” she chuckles, taking a ginger sip of the still-steaming tea.
Dean’s eyebrows raise as Cas releases his held hand, instead reaching for something he’s wanted a long, long time. Longer than he can remember wanting anything.
“How about you, Dean?” Her tea is definitely cold by now. She’s making no moves to get up from the kitchen table. “How are you holding up?”
When Dean takes his hand, there’s no mistaking the look of relief that washes over his features. Cas feels like he could weep at the sight.
Weeks later, Buffy Night has become more of a Dean-and-Charlie activity — the pretense of ‘research’ abandoned in favor of making up drinking games and eating more junk food than usual while bingeing as many episodes as they can. They’re still joined occasionally by Cas or Sam, and on a few memorable occasions, Eileen. Dean is always ready to fill in gaps of the story they’d missed, and Charlie can’t help but think that he’ll end up the bigger fan by the time they finally reach the finale.
She’s about to reply when she sees Dean’s face light up, and she already knows Cas must be behind her. She can smell basil. She turns around, ready to ask if that’s for the pizza.
Dean shakes himself out of this tangent—since when does every little thing remind him of Cas? He knows the answer but still can’t look directly at it. That’s kinda why he’s here in the kitchen with Charlie, and not making grand confessions in the library, or the war room, or the rooftop garden. Wherever Cas is.
“Heh, yeah, I can uh - I can imagine seein’ that woulda been pretty cool.” He rubs the back of his neck, a nervous habit. “This might be a, I dunno, rude question but, when did you... know? That. About yourself.”
“You’ve seen something like this before?” Dean steps further into the kitchen, hip leaning against the countertop. They still hadn’t quite figured out what caused the sudden bout of amnesia Dean and the others were struck with today.
“Yes, thank you,” he replies, handing it over. “The basil and oregano have been particularly prolific, there should be plenty there for all of us.”
The part of Cas that still felt awkward or upset over Dean’s earlier coldness was losing its grip on this interaction. The part of Dean that he’d feared to be reticent, even regretful, over the way the day’s events had unfolded, had apparently also waned significantly.
Cas wants to offer some protest, tell Dean he isn’t broken. That for all his mistakes, his flaws, all the horrible things he’s endured, he’s still a good man. That he’s all the things a good man should be.
He’s quiet for long enough that Charlie continues, in a blessedly casual voice, knowing there’s every chance Dean will want to carry on as if this whole conversation never happened. “So, yeah. She quips that she thinks she might be kinda gay. Which lemme tell ya, as a red-headed Gen X’er who turned out to be more than kinda gay - big TV moment for me.”
This is it. Dean could choose right now to just move past it - ignore the question she’s really asking.
He feels guilty about avoiding Cas since they all got their memories back, but there’s something he needs to figure out first, and there’s only one person he trusts to help him do it.
Now, Dean knows he should probably redirect the conversation to figuring out just how similar today’s events were to a certain intellectual property. It could be important, and it wouldn’t be the first time a seemingly fictional scenario turned out to be a reality. Charlie’s told him stories from Oz that still make his head spin.
Unbidden, memories of the past 12 hours demand Cas’ attention: The confusion, waking in the street with no memory, but a keen sense for hand-to-hand combat and a blade that took down monsters with a single strike. Dean’s face staring up at him, bewildered when he saved his life. He’d just acted on instinct and it had felt so
“And I just... once it was over, and we were back to normal — I guess I was scared the other shoe was gonna drop. Now that I’m back to bein’ the same old, messed up me. At least two lifetime’s worth ‘a bad memories knocking around up here,” he huffs, a humorless sound, tipping his head.
Dean raises his hand with a thumbs up. “That was the deal, I got the DVDs and the snacks, you and Sammy got dinner.”
Somewhere in the back of his mind, Cas realizes they’re both dressed in pajamas. He can count on one hand  the number of times he’s been in pajamas in Dean’s presence over the many years they’ve known each other. Though he was an angel for most of those years, so perhaps that’s not so remarkable.
“And then, there was...  Remember when we were all barricaded in that basement, when the whole nest was on the prowl?” She gives him a small nod, and Dean kicks himself, of course she remembers. “Well I —without really realizing — we were holding hands.” He laughs a bit at that. It seems so small, so juvenile. “I know it sounds silly but... man. I didn’t wanna let go.”
“Hey hey hey — don’t put anything green on my pizza Charlie, c’mon, I’m trusting you,” Dean interjects, making his way to the doorway. “If I wanted rabbit food I woulda just let Sammy have full reign of my kitchen,” he adds, eyeing the (frankly astounding) bundle of herbs she now holds like a bouquet.
“What you want,” he adds, just that much quieter. Dean’s eyes are glistening slightly, but he’s smiling. Cas can feel his own smile blossoming as the worried line between Dean’s eyes starts to ease.
), usually preferring to read in the library, or tend to the scant herb garden he’s trying to start on the roof.
Twenty minutes later, Dean and Cas had walked into the library hand in hand, much to Sam’s shock and both their delight. By lunchtime, he was begging them to get a room and leave the research to the “non-honeymooners.”
“Sorry I’m uh, getting off topic. You know I ramble when I’m nervous,” he laughs, and it is a little anxious-sounding. “Y’know when I knocked on that door, I was feeling so fearless.” He meets Cas’ eye again, and Cas doesn’t think it’s wishful thinking making him see what he wants to in Dean’s expression.
“Hey,” Dean smiles, then shakes himself, maybe realizing that’s his second greeting. “I’ve been lookin’ all over for you.”
Tonight, as if by fate, they have a full house — no one is out on a hunt, Eileen is visiting along with Claire and Kaia, and although she feels a little bit like a seventh wheel, Charlie couldn’t be happier that they are all here for this particular viewing session.
Earlier, without their memories, without the burden of a decade of betrayals and misunderstandings, it had been the most natural thing in the world to reach for Dean’s hand in a moment of fear. He had reached out without a thought for how it could be interpreted, how it might make Dean uncomfortable. It was effortless. Finding that Dean had reached for him at the same time hadn’t come as a surprise, just another extension of the unmistakable bond he’d felt with him since their meeting mere hours before.
The clock in Cas’ room keeps ticking, which he knows is a ludicrous thing to be annoyed with. And yet.
Charlie’s eyebrows threaten to reach her hairline. Dean can almost see the hundred half-formed questions and thoughts forming in her eyes and braces himself. He trusts Charlie, more than anyone where this particular issue is concerned, but he can’t help the roiling he feels in his stomach. Obfuscated as it was, he’d just put into words something he’d never told another person. He has to look away.
“Yeah. This character, Willow— she and her girlfriend don’t have their memories, but they spend the whole episode practically half a second from making out. Even without knowing their history, they still... gravitated to each other.” Charlie pauses, taking a sip of her tea. She’s still holding Dean’s eye. “Like, without the distraction of the rest of their crazy lives, it just became even more obvious how she felt about her.”
Dean must see the change in his expression - Cas curses inwardly - because his own face falls a fraction.
