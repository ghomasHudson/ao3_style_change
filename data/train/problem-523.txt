Sherlock had tried all he could to keep from feeling young the night before, but his mind had been a messy jumble of missing Dimitri, longing for a pacifier, and feeling shame over such a strong desire for his comfort items.  Not to mention he was scared to death he’d slip up and pee in bed if he fell asleep.
“It was my fault,” Sherlock said when his tears had at last been reduced to sniffles.  “It’s my fault we never found him.”
Sherlock was latched onto Bunny’s Daddy like a monkey and it didn’t look as if he were planning to let go anytime soon.  It wasn’t fair.  Bunny wanted to be the littlest that day, wanted Daddy and Papa to snuggle him and look out for him while Sherlock’s teasing kept him small and vulnerable; he felt too fuzzy in his mind to be the big brother because he maybe just wanted to be the little sister.
Greg seemed to understand, and he reached to ruffle John’s hair before pulling him bodily into a bear hug, most likely seeing the smallness John was desperately working to mask.  It would all be so much easier if he could be little, chasing the rest of the kids from room to room instead of making small talk and fielding too-personal medical questions from hypochondriacal Great Aunts.
He could not keep his mind off of Sherlock.  John did as Sherlock bid when they were on a case, helping the man as he chased after each lead or detail in turn.  The pace of the worst ones was unnerving, and John was always left feeling exhausted and overworked.  But if John felt overtired simply from doing Sherlock's legwork, he couldn’t imagine the toll the cases took on Sherlock, who pieced details and evidence together in a constant stream of grueling, never-ending analysis.
“Oh, alright,” he said with a smile. “But not for too long.  I don't want you closed in with all the dust and debris up in that attic all afternoon.”
“You’re due for a timeout for locking the guest room door,” Papa reminded him.  Then, when Sherlock remained silent, in his gentlest voice: “When’s the last time you had a wee, bud?”
Greg could understand respect for the dead, and knew it was not beneath Anderson and his forensics lackeys to take the piss out of some poor bloke who’d been strangled to death, but why John would have been angry enough to start a fist fight over a bit of workplace teasing was still unclear.  John’s anger was often unpredictable, but Greg had never known it to be unprovoked.
“John,” Mycroft said, voice tinged with a bit of a warning.  “You know it’s best we talk about it while it’s on your mind.  I want you to have a relaxing end to the weekend.”
The only response Greg received to his suggestion was the door shoved against his face as Sherlock pushed it closed.
“One more question, bud,” he said.  “Did you fib just now when you told me you went potty? Because, if I’m not mistaken, you’re wearing a rather full pull-up right now.”
Sherlock pouted, his previous frenetic energy dissipating as he stepped from the stool and walked over to press himself against Mycroft’s chest.
John and Mycroft discuss what to do about Sherlock's nearly constant state of wet pants while the little detective naps in the other room.
“You’re mine,” Sherlock said, voice little more than a mumbled whisper.  He knew it wasn’t the right thing to say, that Mycroft didn’t like when he was selfish.  He was supposed to share with Bunny, even when it was hard.  But it was all he could do to keep from crying.
, he whispered when he regained a momentary control.  But, a second later, a jab of desperation hit him, and he folded over onto himself as he lost control.
John tried to explain that he was sorry, tried to put to words all that he wanted Greg to know and all that he was still trying to process.  But words were hard, and he knew he would not be able to present himself as adult for much longer.  He needed to get out of view of the others, he needed to get away from the dead body in the bathroom that looked so much like his drunken father.
It was only once he was out of 221b that Mycroft allowed himself to drop the facade of nonchalance.  Even then, he worried that his brother may notice his walk away through the window, so he allowed himself only a small moment of mourning for the particular piece of innocence he feared was lost from Sherlock forever, straightened his cuffs, opened his umbrella against the light drizzle, and stepped away with his shoulders held back.
,” Greg said, pulling teasingly at the end of Mycroft’s Santa hat to make the bell in its white pom-pom jingle.
The voicing of shame seemed to have the opposite effect of what Greg had intended, brightening John’s cheeks in embarrassment as the kid hunched his shoulders and cried harder.  Greg reached to the backseat, pulling the duffel onto the center console.  He unzipped the bag and pulled out the plush rabbit before rooting around for the pacifier, knowing it would likely be needed before long.
He was grateful for the nightlights plugged in along the dark hallway--no doubt placed there for the benefit of Greg’s nieces--as he made his way quietly but quickly so as not to disturb the girls.  In his younger headspace, he held the somewhat irrational fear that his own nightmares would transfer to others were he not careful.  He paused at the top of the staircase, listening for voices downstairs and hearing laughter and joyful conversation from Papa and Papa’s oldest brother.  They were joking and reminiscing over something that apparently warranted a great deal of teasing of Papa.
“Mycroft is certainly a bit of a mystery,” John said, caught in a laugh as he tracked the blush spreading across Greg’s cheeks.
“Go home, My?” Sherlock asked, and once again Mycroft could see that this was not all little Sherlock; there was the hint of the adult here, well-aware at his attempts at manipulation.
“Poor son-of-a-bitch didn’t know what he was in for,” Anderson said when they'd seen the extent of the bruising around his neck.  He breathed a laugh as he began scraping beneath the man’s fingernails for residual DNA.
Uncle Greg had told Sherlock the truth.  He had been there when Sherlock had needed him in the middle of the night, unlike Mycroft.
“He’s afraid,” Sherlock said as Mycroft cleared John’s breakfast dishes beside him and began cleaning up the scattered bits of egg from the carpet.
Mycroft sighed, glancing down at Sherlock knowingly.  It was clear he knew the ploy Sherlock was attempting.
Greg felt a pit in the base of his stomach knowing he had exposed his kid to death and murder on a day he hadn’t been prepared for it.  He should have paid more attention, should have realized earlier that John had been closer to toddler-mindset than adult, no matter what the man professed.  Both Sherlock and John were constantly attempting to prove themselves big; it was Greg’s job to see them for what they really were at any given moment, and, in this case, he had failed.
Mycroft was on his way to Baker Street quickly.  In the car, he set down the bag he’d packed with what he thought may be useful given his assessment of the situation, gave instructions to his driver, then texted Greg to let him know he was on his way to the boys.  Greg was finishing up a late shift and had mentioned that he planned to go to Mycroft’s when he was off work, so Mycroft didn’t want him to be caught locked out if he arrived while he was away.  It really was about time he gave Greg a key to his place.
John could tell that Mycroft was analyzing him, deducing his inner conflict and attempting to gauge whether to push him towards a conversation or allow him to process on his own.
As if the universe were playing some cruel joke, the man currently on the floor of the cramped motel room bathroom had the same sharp, unshaven jawline as John's father, and the circles beneath the man’s eyes were the same deep, dark circles that were present on his father’s face whenever John found him passed out in corner booths or atop the synthetic fabric of motel room comforters.   The body before him had the additional marks of strangulation, and there was a yellow tinge to the man’s eyes when he examined them closely, but there was enough of a resemblance to set John on edge, thrown back into memories of his father’s violent forays into alcoholism.
“Use your soother, bud,” Greg said, glancing to him with reassurance through the rear-view mirror.  “It’s okay to cry, but try to breathe.”
It had been Uncle Greg who had settled John back into his Bunny headspace.  When John emerged from the shower after his nap with Sherlock, he found the detective inspector wiping down the mattress cover on Sherlock’s bed, finishing up the clean-up job John had started before the itchiness of urine against his skin prodded him to wash up.
John ran a hand across his eyes.  He shouldn’t let himself slip, shouldn’t acknowledge the tight neediness in the center of his chest begging for him to let go.  But there was only so much strength and stoicism he could sustain, particularly when his Daddy was listening, was simply waiting for him to admit to what he needed.  John sighed.
Bunny, glancing up from his coloring book to peer out the window, smiled wide as he seemed to realize for the first time that they’d arrived at the store.  He nodded and began quickly stuffing crayons back into the box, squirming against the seat belt as he reached a hand to unbuckle himself.
John--yes, Mycroft was positive now that this was still a fully adult John in front of him--blushed beet red and shifted his gaze back to his feet.  Greg may have been oblivious to John’s state of mind--he was still holding the man to him as if he were his little Bunny instead of his adult friend--but Mycroft knew better than to be fooled by John’s show of littleness.
Sherlock’s hands were on his waist as John’s mouth found his boyfriend’s, and John could not help but snake his own hand down the front of Sherlock’s trousers, which had now gone cold and clammy.
It was amazing how much Greg had learned about Mycroft from seeing him care for his brother and John Watson.  There was a softness to him not apparent to those he interacted with on a daily basis, an understanding of the world of his brother that spoke to nothing but unconditional, ever-growing love.  If it hadn’t been for Mycroft’s astute observations, his clear understanding of the thoughts and desires of the boys--with the rare exception of his shortcomings regarding John’s princess desires--the entire weekend would have more than likely disintegrated into chaos and an emotional turmoil they may not have been able to overcome.
Mycroft got Bunny undressed and into the bath quickly, knowing the boy most needed to be cleaned, comforted, and put to bed.  He would most like to get both Sherlock and John away from the distractions of Baker Street by bringing them to his house, but he was not going to leave Sherlock alone in his current state, and it remained to be seen whether he would agree to leave.
“That level of loss sticks with you,” Greg continued, recalling cases steeped in sorrow that he’d covered throughout his career.  “He’ll realize there’s more to his remembered pain than a lost pet.”
When Uncle Greg peeked into the bedroom and called to the boys, Sherlock’s first impulse was to whisper to Bunny to hide and to pull the sheets up over their heads.  Bunny seemed surprised and then giddy, and they clapped hands to their mouths to keep Uncle Greg from hearing their giggles.
Years ago, his father had hit John when he found his sister’s dolls hidden under his bed.  They had been an old birthday present to his sister, but Harry hadn’t been the slightest bit interested in them, and they remained perched in the corner of her bedroom for months, untouched and unloved.  John took them.  He didn’t play with them, just hid them under his bed and sometimes lay on his stomach on the floor to look at them and whisper his secrets.
“Thank you, Sherlock,” John said, reaching for the man's hand.  “Unfortunately, I'm not sure it’s as simple as you understanding or supporting my choices.  My, ah...my new identification seemed to trigger something in Mycroft.  A very real worry about how to introduce the topic to you.  Greg was prepared to take me away to Baker Street for the night.”
Unfortunately, John’s nightmares were unpredictable, and not even pacifiers and pull-ups had been able to lessen their frequency.
“It didn’t work, anyway,” Sherlock said, his admission of a failed plan as much of a ‘you’re forgiven’ as Bunny was likely to get.  “I was naughty but nothing changed.”
“I want to stay here,” Bunny said, tears continuing to flow, the pacifier slipping from his mouth.  “I’m sorry I said I’m a girl.”
Hopefully, if Mycroft was willing to listen, John would be willing to explain as truthfully and as honesty as possible.  He was relieved when John nodded.
Sherlock sat on the couch with his legs crossed, the quilt from his bed wrapped around his shoulders and up over his head, watching telly.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock said quietly after a moment.  He untied the sash of the dress and pulled it off of Bunny, who allowed his arms to be pulled up so the dress could be stripped of him and he could at last be taken out of the game.  Sherlock finally seemed to understand his little brother wasn’t okay, that he needed comfort because he hadn't exactly been looking out for Bunny’s needs.  Bunny knew by the somewhat frightened tone in Sherlock’s voice that he had not meant to be intentionally cruel.
Christmas Eve at the Lestrades was a bustling, cheerful affair.  Greg’s parents’ house was warm and inviting: crackling fireplaces in both the dining and living room, wreaths and garlands hung on doors and across mantle pieces, and no less than three Christmas trees scattered around the ground floor.  Beneath the twinkling lights and glittery reindeer statuettes were pictures of Greg and his older brothers--recent pictures from commendations Greg had received after solving difficult cases or promotions his brothers had received at work, graduation photos from various university commencement ceremonies, even an elementary school picture where the photographer had caught Greg in a laugh, freckled and missing his two front teeth.
As he’d jerkily stuffed fistfulls of torn cardstock back into the envelope in which the dolls were stored, he crossed his fingers and prayed that Bunny wouldn’t want to play with his paper dolls that day.  He tried to convince himself that it served Bunny right, that now Mycroft and Papa would really have a reason to give Bunny so much coddling attention and to buy him new toys at the store.  But a sinking emptiness driven by more than his refusal to eat breakfast made his stomach ache, and he hadn’t been able to look Bunny in the eye when the kid had come into the living room to play.
The moon was bright in the master bedroom, the windows open to the now pattering rain.  Sherlock stood in the doorway for only a moment before ascertaining which side of the bed his brother was sleeping on and taking steps towards him.  But he paused.  Because he could see Uncle Greg asleep on one side of the bed and Mycroft asleep on the other, but he could also see John, asleep in their bed too.  John’s head was rested against Mycroft’s chest, pacifier in his mouth and hair disheveled.  And Mycroft’s arm was around John, pulling the man closer, comforting him.
Greg helped him undress and let him choose some bath toys and add in bubble bath.  It was clear Mycroft had been thorough when explaining to Lestrade the procedures of their domestic routine, for which John continued to be grateful.
Sherlock was not ready to express his feelings about the morning’s events in any way that might be considered mature.  He was hurt and confused, but for a man desperate to appear independent and self-sufficiently intelligent, those were two emotions nearly impossible to come to terms with, let alone admit to others.  It had happened before: Sherlock slipping in headspace to keep from dealing with bullying from his classmates, or to keep from admitting to his own loneliness, or, the night before Mycroft had left for university, to keep from having to tell his big brother how much he would miss him.  In headspace Sherlock didn’t have to uphold societal norms or behave in ways appropriate to the standards he had set for himself; if he was angry, he could act out; if he was lonely, he could ask for comfort.
“John and Sherlock,” he explained, thrown-off by the way in which past conversations with his big brother--delicate conversations about girlfriends, boyfriends, sex--reverberated into the current moment.  “When they’re small.”
This chapter and the next were originally one longer chapter, but I decided to break them up a bit for ease of reading and because I wanted to tweak the second half a bit.  I'll be posting a one-shot on tumblr (hopefully) tomorrow, and then I'll be able to finalize the next chapter of this story.
John put away his mobile and began shrugging on his coat.  His train was pulling into the commuter station closest to Harry’s, and he was more than ready to be on solid ground once more.
Sherlock was most susceptible to self-harm and destructive behavior when in the midst of a let-down after a case.  It often took Sherlock a day or two after finalizing logistics and processing the events of each case to begin feeling little.  Sherlock was not about to suddenly want to slip younger just because John had been stressed about wetting himself.  And if John abandoned Sherlock by slipping into headspace, who would be around to make sure Sherlock was handling the post-case boredom without resorting to his self-destructive tactics?
It had been a trying day, and his worries over the potential backlash of Sherlock’s forgotten trauma had not been entirely assuaged.  But, for the moment, it was almost enough to know that those he cared for most in the world, the three men he would protect at any cost from harm and lurking demons and pain, were warm, peaceful, and--although Mycroft may never admit it outside of the world they’d created for themselves--truly, selflessly loved.
“Remind him he can safeword out before you start?” Greg asked, and Mycroft nodded to relieve Greg’s conscience.
It was when Bunny’s eyebrows furrowed in honest confusion as he glanced down to his lap before reaching to press against the soggy material between his thighs that Mycroft realized the boy truly hadn’t realized he was wet.  He’d assumed the boy had simply wet his pull-up by choice, deciding to watch the film rather than miss a key moment by going potty.  Almost as soon as they’d arrived at Mycroft’s, Sherlock had stood in the kitchen and peed into his pants, clearly uninterested in putting in the effort it would take to walk the few steps to the loo and using wetting as a way to settle further down into age.  Mycroft had assumed Bunny was of the same mindset, and now felt heartless for teasing the boy, no matter how good-natured it may have been.
"He's been gone for three days," John whispered.  "Just came back from what was obviously a drug-induced weekend and seems to be hurt in some..What? I---no, I don't, Mycroft.  He's asking for you.  He's--"
“I think Mycroft would murder me if I brought home any more Christmas presents,” he said with a raised eyebrow.  “He’s not a proponent of what he calls my ‘spoiling the kids.’”
And then Papa was helping her put on the headband, sliding it onto her head until the horn rested just above her forehead.  Papa’s face broke out into a wide grin as he sat back to look down at Bunny, and she blushed through Daddy snapping a quick picture of her on his phone.  After putting his phone away, he leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek.  Bunny leapt towards him for a hug.
But it was nothing more than a kid’s bedwetting diaper, and it could not hold the contents of a grown man’s bladder.  Soon, Sherlock’s hand in his crotch was becoming wet as the pee streamed through the legholes of the diaper and soaked into his jeans and down onto the car seat.  He reveled in the wetness, feeling so young and helpless that there were tears in his eyes.  He hoped it would never stop.  He pushed his bladder when the stream began to die down, wanting to become as soaked and saturated with urine as he possibly could, using his hands to splash the warm liquid from where it was puddled between his legs on the carseat up and onto dry areas of his jeans.
Mycroft was between Sherlock and Bunny in an instant, and he took Bunny by the arm and yanked him to a standing position.
I'm so sorry it took me far longer to update than I'd expected!  I had a really tough time figuring out the ending of this chapter.  I'm not entirely happy with it, but at least it's finished! Full disclosure that it's an unedited chapter, so apologies for any mistakes.  Just one or two more chapters left in this story before I plan to turn my attention back to A Little Training.  Life is a bit crazy, as I'm sure it is for all of you as well, but I promise I'm writing when I can.
“That is not an inaccurate statement,” Mycroft relented, proceeding with bluntness as a way to meet Sherlock’s half-adult mind.  “There were matters which drew my attention away from you for a time, yes.”
“Hey, hey, what’s this?” Mycroft asked, pulling Sherlock closer to him.  “Come here, ‘Lock.  It’s going to be okay.”
Their mother saw through the lies, thanking Mycroft for taking care of his little brother when she hugged him goodbye.  She told Sherlock she was glad he’d come, and Mycroft worried the kid would snap at her with something disparaging--praise being a bit of a divisive action when Sherlock was fighting headspace, but he simply shrugged and whined a bit in the back of his throat as Mycroft, laden with presents and far too many leftovers, ushered him out of the house.
But Sherlock had asked him to get young.  And although Sherlock had no qualms about asking John to pick up biscuits or to text clients or to retrieve a book he was too lazy to walk across the room to get himself, he rarely asked for what it was he actually needed, especially not while out of headspace.  And because John knew this, he had long ago made it a policy to follow through on any of Sherlock’s legitimate requests.  If Sherlock needed John to be young, John would do everything he could to make that happen, and he would do it as quickly as possible.
Mycroft looked unconvinced, as if he were about to argue against Greg’s unfailing high esteem, but they were interrupted by a clearing of the throat, and both men turned to see Bunny in the kitchen doorway, hands shoved in the pockets of his coat.
He could not hear any commotion downstairs, which he hoped meant that Greg had gotten Bunny back to sleep.  He couldn’t wait to get the boys back to his house, where they had their own connected rooms just down the hall from the master bedroom and Mycroft could watch over them both.  The quarters were too tight at Baker Street; there was not enough space for them to all be together at night, when the boys were most vulnerable to dark thoughts and nightmares.
Sherlock could still feel the darkness whispering in his mind, the negative and even hopeless thoughts waiting in the wings that always came with his bad days.  But, for the moment, he knew as he fell into a deep sleep that he was safe from the loneliness.  And that went a long way towards making him feel as if, in time, everything might feel okay again.
Mycroft opened his paper once more.  “Not in time out,” he said.  “Boys who are punished for misbehaving do not get toys during their punishment.”
Sherlock had been planning to refuse to go to the lake house.  He didn’t know if he could handle a weekend away without becoming more vulnerable than he wanted to, without letting the sense of purposelessness plunge him into depression and anger and neediness.  Age play was in large part about a loss of control, and Sherlock worried that if he allowed himself to sink down right now, he would lose even the small semblance of control he had always been able to retain while little.  And that terrified him.
“Bunny,” Mycroft warned.  “You know you’re not to be sucking your thumb today.  Take it out.  Let me see your tongue.”
“I don’t know, exactly,” Sherlock said.  He turned his contemplative gaze toward Mycroft.  “There was a riddle...a rhyme to…”
After sending both boys to use the loo while Greg finished packing the car and after dealing with Sherlock’s stubborn refusal to try to pee one more time by threatening time outs until he stormed into the bathroom--the man wouldn't be big for long, Mycroft could see--they were each buckled into the rental car and on their way out of the city for a much-needed break.
The car ride would be less insufferable if he could allow himself to slip down in age.  Mycroft and Lestrade had brought toys, books, puzzles, even Sherlock’s pirate shirt and, in case he was feeling particularly young and was in just the right mood, Sherlock’s pacifier.  But Sherlock’s mind was moving too quickly, his nerves too frazzled to feel as if he could allow himself the comfort of slipping.  He was worried about how young he might go, worried about the force of the neediness pulling at the back of his mind.  As it was, he hadn’t been able to let himself fall down to his usual age, and he knew he was hovering around a teenaged-mindset, only young enough for snark and sullenness.
“Daddy, Sherlock pinched me,” Bunny said in an attempt to turn his Daddy’s loving affection away from little Sherlock.  He held out his forearm, pointing to where he could almost imagine a small red mark left by Sherlock’s grasping fingers.
The boy (and the man) hated apologies.  Mycroft hoped this one would not become a drawn out ordeal.  He was relieved when Sherlock did not put up a fight but came closer to where John lay with his head on Mycroft’s shoulder.
It was true that Mycroft worried about Sherlock’s treatment of Bunny given this new development, worried about the potential teasing or shunning that Bun might receive at the hands of Sherlock.  But Mycroft had suddenly been reminded that there was more to the situation than Bunny’s feelings alone.  Bunny would have had no idea of the ramifications, of course, but introducing a sister into Sherlock’s world had more than the usual potential for disaster.  Mycroft worried about the effect it may have on Sherlock’s state of mind.
“Oh, no, sweetheart,” Mycroft said, setting Sherlock’s overnight bag on the table as he turned to reassure the boy.  “I just didn’t want to put your bag on the dirty floor.  I know you’re a big boy.”
Bunny was confused by the layout of his Daddy’s house.  He wasn’t even sure he would have been able to find his own way from his bedroom to the breakfast table that morning if Papa hadn’t led him down, so it was no easy feat to find a room that would make a good hiding spot.
He’d been keeping himself from full disciplinarian-mode out of fear Sherlock would break down, but now that they were alone he couldn’t resist an expression of his frustration over his brother’s actions.  He placed a hand on the back of Sherlock’s headrest and twisted his body to look behind them as he began to back out of the driveway.
Papa’s voice was at its gentlest, which made Sherlock feel like crying again.  He yanked the duvet tighter around him.
“Furthermore,” Sherlock continued, seemingly unaware that John was not entirely following.  “Although I’m more than content for you to express yourself as female when or if you’d like to, I predict that it will not be something you desire more than the occasional day or night here and there.  It's glaringly apparent that your psyche is rather fixed on working through your own childhood experiences in this regard, meaning that you will mirror that which you felt as a child by remaining attached to what have generally been coded feminine items.  However, now that you’ve gone through the process of testing the levels of Mycroft and Lestrade's acceptance and thus soothing your worries about the real issue, which is your association with stereotypically 'girly' items, you won’t have nearly as much drive to label your gender quite so specifically."
This chapter was an interesting challenge, as I wanted to explore the impact the events of the previous few chapters had on both Sherlock and Mycroft in alternating perspectives.  Hopefully it worked out!
Bunny’s countenance changed over the course of time she and Sherlock shared crayons and made up stories for the pictures they were coloring: she sat up straighter and had a cheerful glint to her eye that was different from the usually reserved, shy looks the boy Bunny often cast towards Sherlock.  Bunny even sounded different: her voice was louder and she was prone to fits of giggling, finding silliness in things Sherlock had never thought to think funny.
“I’ll stop at the next service station,” Mycroft said when he noticed the way Sherlock’s kicking of the footwell was accompanied by a tell-tale fidgeting.
Mycroft was doing well; he always knew just how to help Sherlock slip when he felt unable to.  The younger man pressed his face into the car seat and waited for the first strike.  It came quickly and harshly, Mycroft’s hand smacking against his bare skin.  Mycroft began high up, just below Sherlock’s lower back.  Sherlock yelped and, after recovering for a moment, began counting.  Mycroft’s spanking moved down Sherlock’s bottom until he was hitting right against his seat, always the most painful for Sherlock.
“Bunny doesn’t want to wear big boy clothes because he might have a wee in his pants, and everyone would know,” Sherlock whispered.
They had by now had a bit of time to process the drama of the weekend at the lake, albeit not as much as was probably necessary, and John, for one, was feeling tentatively optimistic about the overall progress they had all made as a foursome.  But there were lingering questions and concerns that still needed to be aired--between him and Sherlock in particular.
a bad dream.  He was gasping for breath around the phantom weight settled heavily on his chest, afraid that, together in one room, they were all in reach of the monster’s clutches.  But Daddy was strong and calm, speaking softly.  With a sympathetic glance towards Bunny and a nod towards Daddy, Papa brought Sherlock out of the bedroom and into the hallway, headed in the direction of the Master bedroom.
Uncle Greg laughed and began to nod, but, before he could answer, Bunny’s Daddy spoke up from where he was feeding Sherlock at the other end of the table.
Mycroft nodded, the closest Greg would get to an “I love you, too” when Mycroft was sober and shifting into problem-solving mode.
Mycroft got Sherlock to sleep rather quickly, the boy already tired from the hot cocoa and the cold medicine he had found in the downstairs bathroom cabinet.  Sherlock did ask for a story to be read to him before he’d fallen asleep, and Mycroft had found one of the new pictures books he’d furnished Sherlock’s room with and sat beside him in bed to read to the boy.
“Not hungry,” he said, slumping down into the seat and resting his knees against the back of the driver’s seat.
“I can swing you back to Mycroft’s when we’re finished here,” he said, conveying far more with his concerned look than he did with his words.  “It’s been a long morning.”
“Bun, come on with me and let’s use the loo,” Greg said, holding out his hand.  “Your brother and Mycroft will join us in a moment and we’ll all have some lunch, okay?”
He paused in undressing Greg only to trail his tongue and lips along the man’s stomach, sending the Detective Inspector into stifled laughter when his most ticklish spots were found.  They were breathless even before they were naked, hands roving and bodies pressing against each other, thrusting in desperate need.
“It doesn’t work that way, love,” John said.  “If you love Bunny, you have to accept her for who she is, no matter what.”
He wasn’t exactly proud of it, but it had taken only minutes before he had been compelled to go through the room in search of something he could use to harm himself.  Given that there was no possibility for drugs of any kind--Mycroft and Greg had both searched his bags before leaving Baker Street--it was his next-step coping mechanism.  But he had known he wouldn’t find anything sharper than the plastic corner of a lego even before he had started looking.  His brother and Lestrade had ensured the room was free of anything dangerous.  The fact that they cared for his well being should have comforted him; instead, it sparked anger and irritation.  What right did they have to stifle him and his needs, to censor him?
Mycroft wrapped an arm around him, and John’s face fell once more.  He gave in to the lingering tears, head falling sideways to rest against Mycroft’s shoulder.  Mycroft supported him, telling him again and again that he was safe, allowing John the time that he needed to process and recover from the nightmare.
Dinner seemed to progress normally after that moment.  Sherlock, having finally agreed to the compromise of watching Land Before Time but only if he was allowed to explain the scientific inaccuracies of prehistoric times as they watched, continued to prattle on about whatever popped into his mind, and Mycroft and Greg entertained his notions while they ate and Bunny remained silent.  And although Mycroft fed Bunny between bites of his own food, there was very little that was different about their family meal.
“You didn’t know little John in his earliest stages of ageplay,” Mycroft said.  “You didn’t see how unsure of himself he was, how eager he was to fit specifically into whatever he thought was wanted of him.  It was Sherlock who created Bunny, Greg.  Not John.  I worry that John is playing a character, that he feels more comfortable separating himself as much as possible from his adult self than he does finding his actual personality in headspace, that he somehow thinks this is the role he should be playing.”
“I didn’t go all the way.” John could hear the smile in the admission; Sherlock was clearly enjoying the fact that he’d been caught.  “I only let out enough to let him think I’d gone.”
“None of that,” Mycroft said, clucking his tongue as he nodded towards Sherlock.  “You’re too old for that, now.”
“My room!” He said when he’d come across a blue child’s room with a green bedspread over the twin bed.
“I think you know what you did wrong, Bunny,” Mycroft said.  “It was very wrong of you to wander away from Uncle Greg when you were in the store and to disobey him.  You scared Uncle Greg very much and you put yourself in danger by breaking the rules.”
“And I don’t think you’re a baby,” Sherlock said.  “And I’m sorry for teasing you because I don’t like it when people tease me, either.”
“If I am, it’s thanks to the three of you,” he said, nodding with his chin towards the boys as he once more squeezed Greg’s hand.
Mycroft had re-entered the living room at this point with a wiped down Dmitri the dinosaur, which Sherlock reached for immediately.
Sherlock glanced over to Bunny, who had turned away from the cartoons and was looking up at Mycroft with something between longing and fear.  Sherlock knew Bunny rarely left the house while in headspace.  He also knew the man was far less of a homebody than was Sherlock, and it was likely he was going a bit stir-crazy after so many days at the lake house.
Sending you all holiday wishes and Snow Bunny kisses.  Love to those of you who have family to celebrate the holidays with but especially to those who don't--please know you're not alone and I for one am sending you positive vibes!
Sherlock could feel himself younger than before, less wild in the mind.  But he was still unsure of himself, and anxious about going into a public space.  He knew he would be pulled immediately out of any younger headspace were he to be surrounded by strangers, and then Mycroft’s spanking would have all been for nothing.
Sherlock was sulking, but he walked over to the kitchen table where Mycroft and John sat.  He fidgeted, one foot on top of the other.
“Is John-John still big?” Sherlock asked, balancing himself on Papa’s shoulders as the man, seated on the edge of the bathtub, leaned to help him step out of his wet trousers.
Greg wished they were closer, wished he could pull the kid into his lap.  As it was, all he could do was squeeze the boy’s knee in reassurance.
Whether because he actually believed him to be fully adult or because he was simply in too much of a rush to question the statement, John didn’t know.  But Greg took only a moment longer before nodding and turning from the kitchen.
, John texted back, ultimately wanting to assuage his sister’s guilt more than he wanted to delve into the overwhelming disappointment of the situation and its predecessors.
I meant to write a quick bit of fluff ending this story with syrupy-sweet Christmas time among the little family, but if you've read this far you know I'm basically incapable of keeping the angsty-plots from emerging.  I'm not entirely happy with this chapter because I had to rush it a bit (I gave myself a deadline of Christmas), and it's more of a set-up chapter than anything, but I hope you'll forgive me for that as I get myself back into this world after not writing for so long!  Feel free to let me know what you'd like to see once I do get around to the Christmas-y fluff (which will come), and have a fantastic night, loves!  Happy Holidays to all of you!
Mycroft cleared his throat.  His brother knew what was required for a proper explanation.  They had decided on parameters long ago.  Sherlock sighed, stomping his foot in a show of aggravation.
“How are my two favorite kiddos?” Papa asked a few minutes later as he came down the steps with a handful of dirty laundry.  He walked past them to toss the laundry into the laundry hamper which sat next to the washing machine in the downstairs loo, then turned the corner back into the kitchen to wash his hands.  “Leaving any dino nuggets for Papa?”
"John? What is it?...Watson? Tell that brother of mine my patience is wearing thin, as it has been with him for the past month.  He knows as well as I that his recent behavior--"
And with a small moan and his eyes squeezed shut, Sherlock began to pee in his pants.  He spread his legs and leaned back against the seat as urine began to pulse warm and wet into the pull-up, saturating the crotch and then spreading down against his already warmed bum.  The stream was strong and fast, and Sherlock could hear the pee exiting his body and streaming into the pull-up until the training diaper was thick and heavy.
And, when he had finished, when he sat staring down at the mess he had made of himself and the carseat, when he realized he’d just had an accident like a bad boy and that Mycroft and Uncle Greg would be upset with him and that Bunny--who had gone with Uncle Greg to use the loo like a big boy--would see that he really wasn’t anything more than a wet-pants baby, when, more than anything, he realized with relief that he was finally in a young headspace, he began to cry.
He shrugged up at his Papa and let his fork drop on his plate.  Maybe if he didn’t feed himself, Papa would do it for him.
Bunny felt a bit more grounded once they were closed in the hall bathroom Greg’s nieces shared, the bright light and colorful unicorn shower curtain helping to convince him there were most likely no hidden monsters ready to jump out and get him.
Greg did his best with what he had--helping Bunny out of his saturated pants, using the dry sections of the blanket to wipe him off, and re-dressing him in the trousers he’d asked the boy to take off.  As he bundled the blanket and wet pants into the boot of the car, Greg was adding to the list of necessaries he would be stocking up on: spare clothes, baby wipes, plastic bags.  Luckily, the accident had been contained by the folds of the blanket, so he was able to settle the boy back into his seat and buckle him in once more.
The juxtaposition of Sherlock’s currently childish voice struggling to parrot back Mycroft’s heightened language was rather adorable, and John could not help but pull the boy in for a hug at long last, chuckling to himself that Sherlock was too cute for his own good.
“Hey, none of that,” Greg said, taking Mycroft by the shoulders.  “The kid felt comfortable enough to express himself as he truly was, today.  I’m not about to minimize the progress that shows, no matter what consequences it's had.  I don’t know what’s got you so worried, love, but I do know none of this is your fault.”
“Even though I’m naughty and Bunny has more stickers on his chart than me?” he asked, following another repeated insecurity by comparing himself to John.
“Take all the time you might need,” Mycroft said.  “Thank you for telling me.  I will follow your lead.  For now, do you have a sense of how you’d like me to respond if it does happen again?”
“Oh, alright,” he said, shifting the hat so that it was properly situated on his head.  “But you better keep your phone away.  I don’t want any photographic evidence.”
Mycroft was calling from the other side of the door.  Sherlock could not help but bite back a sob.  He couldn’t ask Mycroft to help him, no matter how much he wanted it.  Mycroft would see the pull-up if he helped him untie his pants; Mycroft would know Sherlock had been bad.
“Are you sure?” Mycroft asked.  “Uncle Greg said you picked out some nice presents for your brother.  I’m sure he’d love to see them.”
After a quick trip to the downstairs bathroom to throw his wet sock into the laundry hamper and to find a clean pull-up and a package of baby wipes in the cabinet beneath the sink, he began his search for the boy.
“Sherlock?” he asked, and when Sherlock turned to him, his big brother was looking at him searchingly.
Mycroft had, over the years, helped Sherlock to develop coping mechanisms for when he was feeling depressed while in littlespace, mechanisms of self-care that were meant to be as far as possible from drugs or self-harm.  But, that morning, Sherlock had not been in the mood to draw pictures of his feelings or to recite any positive affirmations or to go for a walk outside.  He’d been up nearly the entire night, unable to find a comfortable spot in the bed squeezed between Bunny and Uncle Greg yet too desperate for company to retreat back to his own bedroom.  He didn’t have the energy for much of anything.
Ignoring the man with a roll of his eyes, John dragged the desk chair towards the bed, taking a seat where he could get a glimpse at whatever it was Sherlock was working on.
But as he sat beneath the twinkling string lights that Greg had hung in the kitchen (and in every other room of the main floor, and on the banister up to the second floor, and in the bushes out front), watching the smiling faces of his kids dressed in matching pajamas and the knowing glances of his contented boyfriend in his ridiculous old Santa hat, he began to understand.  For the first time, he was spending Christmas with a family who understood and valued him for exactly who he was, a family he could care for and who had forced him to open himself up to their love.
It was the sound of shattered glass that must have been the last straw for Mycroft and John.  For, as Sherlock clutched his bleeding fist against his chest and stood on the carpet amidst the shattered fragments of the broken window, they shoved their way into the room, toppling over the dresser in their need to get to their hurt Sherlock.
Sherlock hugged his arms around himself and shrugged, eyes downcast to the footwell of the car.  He shifted where he sat, his bladder full and his bottom sore from the spanking.
“Listen,” Greg said when he’d finished paying at the counter inside and had climbed back into the car with John.  “I know yesterday wasn’t easy.  But you did good.”
“Ow,” Sherlock said when Mycroft looked closely at the deepest of the cuts despite the fact that he had not touched them.  “Don’t do that.”
Sherlock said nothing, but he nodded, and John could breathe again.  He reached out and took Sherlock’s uninjured hand, glad when the other man didn’t yank away from his touch.
Daddy twisted his head to follow the sound of tumbling blocks to glance at Bunny, kneeling on the carpet.
“Where’s Ariel?” Mycroft asked, and John yanked back his sheets and blankets until he found his stuffed lion tangled in the bedclothes.  He pulled the stuffed animal to his chest.  It was John’s only little item Mycroft had not been able to pack, as the man had started to keep her with him, close by even when the man was big.  But whether out of necessity or convenience, Mycroft was unsure.
Downstairs in Mycroft’s presence, the prickling guilt--guilt which had surfaced when he lied to Papa about the juice on the carpet--intensified.  He was worried Mycroft would deduce his naughtiness with a single look, and the disappointed sigh the man gave after asking Sherlock where his Papa was caused Sherlock to sink into himself, vowing to be as unreadable as possible.
“I’ll deal with any wet sheets if it comes to that,” he said, continuing to keep his voice low.  “Let’s just go to bed, now.”
Greg  was cuddled up with a now-placated Sherlock when Mycroft and Bunny returned.  He tried to make eye contact with his boyfriend when the man deposited their youngest back onto the couch, but Mycroft avoided his gaze, leaving the boy to watch the end of the movie before stepping over the scattered pillows the boys had been using on the floor and retreating out of the living room.
Mycroft shook his head as they set up their chairs right where the grass of the yard met the sand of the shore.  The owners of the house had created a faux beach, laying sand over the dirt of the shoreline.  The boys had raced through the sand, and Sherlock was now up to his waist in the water, trying to coax a tentative John to come in past his ankles.
Bunny breathed a quiet laugh, and Greg carded his fingers through the boy’s hair.  It was longer than usual given the relentless pace of cases that had kept him and Sherlock from anything not crime-related for quite some time.
Bunny could hear Mycroft answer after only two rings, and he made a high-pitched noise in the back of his throat.  Just knowing his Daddy was on the other end of the line made him more desperate to talk to him, to see him.
“John, listen to me,” Mycroft said, reaching across the table to pat John’s hand as a way to get his full attention.  “I know you'll think my words childish, but it really was just an accident.  It isn't the end of the world.  And it definitely didn't make you a bad kid.  It actually just made you a kid, which you were at the time.”
It was a slight point of contention between Greg and Mycroft, the way Greg could get Sherlock to cooperate in ways Mycroft could not.  The boy was often a more well-behaved child when in the care of Greg, less combative and argumentative than when he was with his brother.  Greg assumed the juxtaposition had to do with the fact that Greg didn’t have the same level of history with Sherlock as Mycroft did.  Even as Sherlock’s caretaker, Mycroft had to combat years of competition and power struggles.  Greg, on the other hand, could simply be an authority figure, something Sherlock desperately needed.
John Watson didn't understand.  He left behind his newspaper and crossed the room towards his best friend and boyfriend, the anger he had felt over Sherlock not contacting him for the past three days dissipating at the thought of Sherlock injured in some way.
“No, I’m not,” Sherlock argued, lying to his brother for the simple fact that he felt like causing trouble.  “I’m cold.”
“Bun, come on and eat when you’re ready,” Greg called from the other side of the bathroom door, and John felt a stab of panic.  He realized he was standing in the bathroom, arms around himself, in nothing but a pull-up and his Gryffindor pajama top.
The timing of Sherlock’s looming regression could not have been worse.  Sherlock had made strides in headspace by letting Greg and John in on the equation, but he wasn’t about to welcome other observers, least of all the Holmes brothers’ rather conservative parents.
It was almost a blessing in disguise; Greg would rather discourage the boy from sucking his thumb or pacifier because he didn't want to further aggravate the sore on his tongue than because he didn't want close-minded people to stare, point, or tease.
Mycroft reached forward and adjusted Bunny’s pull-up, running a finger along the inside of the leg holes to ensure they were not bunched or pulling in the wrong direction.
“I’ll handle Sherlock,” Mycroft said, knowing there were both apologies to be made and punishments to be doled out.  “You need to punish the Bunny.”
Mycroft leaned forward and kissed John on the forehead.  John blushed, and mumbled that he was big, but he was grateful for the comfort no matter what he said.  Deep down, he wasn't sure if he’d have been able to function had Mycroft not accepted this part of him.
Bunny seemed not to hear as he was led away, his eyes lingering on the bunny nightgown even as they walked towards the women’s section.  Greg just prayed there would be something Bunny liked in a large enough size for him.
Sherlock felt the fabric at John’s crotch dampening, could feel the muscles of his stomach tense as he struggled to keep from losing complete control.
John slipped his phone into his pocket and leaned onto his knees, letting his face fall into his hands.  Why did he give her chance after chance?  He should know by now that Harry was not reliable, that picking him up at the train station on time was a rather tall order for his sister.  He didn’t place full blame Harry; she had been through a lot, and John knew first-hand how difficult it could be to cope at times.  But that didn’t mean the whole situation hadn’t left him feeling stranded and forgotten.
Mycroft hoisted himself from the chair with a sigh and crossed to the window, glass of bourbon in hand.
“Not the time for a lecture, Myc,” Greg said with a smirk, reaching to rub the man’s shoulder.  He smiled at John and quirked his head towards the staircase.  “Let us know if you need backup, kiddo,” he said.
“I’d say we might just have another little on our hands,” Greg smiled.  “If you’re ready to take on that additional responsibility, you should talk to him, Myc.  John’s clearly a man who’s seen his fair share of pain.  A little comfort might go a long way towards alleviating some hardship.”
But the man’s breath of laughter faded as Bunny refused to look up from where he gaze was fixed on the stairway.
“There’s more to this than you’re letting on,” he said, wishing Mycroft would realize he wouldn’t jeopardize his brother’s well-being were he to place his full trust in Greg.
Sherlock was naked from the waist down and over Mycroft’s lap a moment later, writhing but content as he was spanked.  It was a rather long spanking, Sherlock’s bare bum reddening as Mycroft hit him again and again, but Mycroft knew it was what Sherlock needed, in fact what he was desperate for.  The boy, yelling through his snivelling, was being punished for the lies of the day before and the cheekiness of the morning’s antics, yes, but he was also being shown the affirmation of Mycroft’s care for him.  Mycroft had him in-hand, and Sherlock could do nothing but trust that Mycroft--steadfast, intuitive, big brother Mycroft--knew just what he needed.
Sherlock looked as if he would refuse, looked as if he were ready to send his little brother back to his room alone to punish him for any number of the things Sherlock currently had to hold against Bunny.
“You’re doing just fine,” Mycroft said.  “You were upset that Bunny could be himself when you felt as if you could not.  Is that right?”
“Stop this charade,” he said, nearly caustic as he took hold of Sherlock’s upper arm.  “Your pride isn’t worth pissing yourself.”
“Still asleep, but grumpy from what I can ascertain.”  Daddy pressed Bunny’s head to his chest and covered the ear not pressed against him, but Bunny could still hear what Daddy was saying to Papa.  “I found Bunny on the floor, under the bed.  He told me Sherlock didn’t want him sleeping with him.”
Greg did not mention his hope that, should John stay, they could ease the Doctor back down into some semblance of headspace.  It was clear John had been pulled rather abruptly out of headspace, and Greg knew he himself hadn't exactly helped in that area.
Sherlock was already dressed in pajamas, Mycroft having changed him into them when he’d brought the boy upstairs for a diaper change and what he’d later told Greg had been a quick rock in the rocking chair to settle him into headspace, but Greg knew Mycroft did not like the boys to skip cleaning their teeth.  He carried the boy into the upstairs bathroom and perched him on the top of the sink cabinet as he reached for the baby’s alligator toothbrush.
Mycroft nodded.  “Sherlock and I have had years to cultivate his ideal environment, years to settle on parameters based on his needs.  But Sherlock’s rules may not work best for you.”
There was no visible puddle on the bedroom floor leading into the closet, so it seemed Bunny’s accident may have happened prior to him retreating to his closet hiding place.  Mycroft moved to John’s side of the bed and flipped back the sheets, and, sure enough, he revealed a wet patch of urine.  Sherlock groaned and the baby tensed in Mycroft’s arms.
“Bun, do you need the potty, sweetheart?” He asked as he sent off an email to a rather incompetent government higher-up.  He’d just realized the boy hadn’t been to the loo all morning.  He’d meant to take him after changing Sherlock’s diaper, but had been distracted by getting his little brother settled and content.
Bunny keened in the back of his throat as the smell of his accident reached him, and a moment later he felt the pull-up leaking, trickling out of the left leg hole to run down his thigh and his calf until it began puddling around his foot on the hardwood floor.  He continued to pee, unable to stop, suddenly helpless against the rush of liquid streaming through the too-full pull-up and falling to patter onto the floor.
There was a pause, then mumbling that Greg could not understand.  They had just turned off the expressway, and he took advantage of the side streets to pull off on the side of the road.
Alone with Mycroft in the bedroom that was his for the weekend, John was relieved to no longer have to so closely guard against adulthood.  It seemed there was a silver lining to him and Sherlock being placed in separate rooms.
“That’s part of the chaos that is taking care of little Sherlock.  He’s not generally any set age.  He could start a day as eight and be five by dinnertime.  He needs the mental stimulation that keeps him from feeling self-conscious about regression.  If he’s not stimulated in some external way--going on a trip or solving a new puzzle--he needs a way to distract himself.  We've come across a few tactics that keep him aged down, and one of them is that he’ll shift in age to keep himself entertained.  I’ve personally seen him sink as young as a needy three year old and then shift to as old as a very petulant pre-teen, around twelve or thirteen.”
“I know you need time.  You can take all of it that you need.  But it doesn’t have to be this way.  Let me help you with this.”
Greg knew he could grab what they needed and be out of the store in twenty or thirty minutes, but he also knew John could benefit not only from the experience in public while little, but also from the time outside of the lake house, which had, over the course of the weekend, definitely become a space where Sherlock’s needs had been put first.  Greg wanted John to feel cared for and looked after as well, and that meant it would be beneficial to take some alone time with the boy.
I have minimal first-hand experience with questions of gender identity beyond my own proclivity towards opposite-gender items/interests while ageplaying, so please feel free to reach out/comment if there is anything you feel to be inauthentic/incomplete/inaccurate or unfairly stereotypical about what Bunny is going through in this chapter.  I'd love to hear from any of you who have been through this first-hand and can give pointers or advice for approaching the topic both realistically and with sensitivity in this and future chapters.
“No,” Greg said, quick to reassure the boy that he was not in trouble for his accident.  “But I do think a time-out is in order for disobeying Daddy.”
“Bloody hell, Sherlock,” he gasped, falling forward.  Sherlock held John by the biceps, steadying him as he nearly collapsed from the ecstasy of the spreading warmth as the pull-up grew heavy.
John squealed and raced out of the living room as Mycroft chased him down the hallway.  It would be okay, John thought as he laughed and hid from his smiling daddy.  It would all be alright.
He placed the dinosaur on the kitchen table.  Sherlock whined, but stopped after a look from Mycroft, who was clearly a stern yet warm caretaker.
It had been the worst day ever.  He didn’t feel well and Daddy loved Sherlock more than he loved him.  Daddy wasn’t fair and he couldn’t talk to him right now.  He wanted his Papa.
“No,” he said.  “There was a slight moment when he began to age up, but it was clear he wasn't ready to come out of headspace yet.  He needs more time to process what happened and how he’s feeling before he’ll be ready to chat.”
“My brothers built it when I was seven,” Greg said, leaning into the treehouse from where he stood with both hands on the door frame, startling John from the close attention he had been paying to some old school textbooks and records--waterlogged and falling apart--that he’d found in the far corner.
“Even big boys have trouble now and then,” Mycroft said as nonchalantly as possible.  “Nothing a bath and some laundry can’t fix up good as new for my sweet boy.”
“Sherlock, let’s get you to the loo, at least,” Papa said, clearly attempting to tackle the issue he could most easily handle at the moment.  “We don’t want an accident.”
Bunny whimpered and tried to push himself away from Mycroft.  Mycroft feared he would burst into loud cries once more, and kept his arms wrapped tightly around the boy.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John warned.  Yet there was a smirk emerging even as John rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s presumptuous deducing.  This was his old Sherlock, back to teasing and self-assured statements.
Bunny whined in the back of his throat as he reached towards his Papa for a hug.  Didn’t Papa understand that he didn’t want to take care of Sherlock, that he didn’t want to worry about being bigger today? That he was sick and felt icky and all befuddled?
But John was not in a position to let the man’s carelessness slide, and he was on his feet with threatening epithets in an instant, body posed for fighting.  The younger man held up his hands and apologized again, but John lunged, and soon found himself in the midst of a shouting, scrambling bar fight.
“Meaning it’s not the presence of a woman but the presence of a...a young girl that he somehow believes dangerous.” he said, nodding.
“Speaking of which,” Greg said as he pulled the last item from Sherlock’s overnight bag: a plastic mattress cover.
John smiled sideways.  Leave it to Sherlock to give himself an excuse to act up.  It was no surprise that Sherlock had found a way to use this to his own advantage.
Sherlock seemed satisfied, and once he was done weeing and had torn off the soaked pull-up, he stood patiently while Mycroft cleaned him up with wet paper towels.  Mycroft had ignored the instinct early that morning which had told him to bring along wet wipes and spare pull-ups, somehow rationalizing that Sherlock would be more likely to slip were Mycroft to prepare for his younger headspaces.  But Mycroft could see now how foolish it had been.  Sherlock was clearly uncomfortable, and all Mycroft could offer him was clean-up with cheap paper towels.
Bunny rubbed at his eyes and smiled at his big brother.  If Sherlock was teasing again instead of outright name calling and shoving, maybe things would be okay.
He turned around the corner of the building as he pissed himself, close to the wall to hide himself from the wandering investigators and crime scene technicians. Sherlock’s hand was on his shoulder, and John shrugged it off.  He didn’t want pity.
There was a hesitancy in Mycroft’s voice that even little Sherlock knew had to do with guilt and a desire to placate.
When he had no luck in the pharmacy aisle, he made his way back towards the toy section, glancing down each aisle in turn while attempting to calm his fraying nerves.  He should never have taken his eye off him; he should never have let go of his hand.
“Daddy,” Bunny cried, reaching out for Mycroft as soon as he entered the room.  “Sherlock pinched me!”
“Uncle Greg is mean,” is what Bunny said, repeating what he had mumbled a moment before.  His cheeks flushed, as if he were nervous about his words.
He was grateful that Mycroft had brought him to the bathroom quickly; if he'd been made to stand in the corner for a full timeout he would have certainly wet himself.  As it was, he was having trouble gaining control of himself now.  The intense urge had passed, but his fingers were fumbling as he stood upright and began attempting to unknot the drawstring of his joggers, thighs scissoring back and forth in his desperate need.
It wasn’t what he’d expected.  He was used to drastic action being taken when there were suspicions he’d hurt himself.  He was used to loud voices making demands and grasping hands pulling him one way or another.  He was used to being made to feel inconsequential and naughty.
“Okay,” he said when the boy returned and was sitting cross-legged on the bed, facing him.  “Let’s talk about Bunny.”
Bunny hesitated, then gave a small, miserable “okay” that was little more than a drawn-out sob.  Mycroft could not help but wonder if they had ever had a day full of so many breakdowns for both Sherlock and John.  It was rare both boys were so emotionally off at the same time.  Then again, this was the longest stretch of uninterrupted ageplay they had had in quite some time, and it was bound to lead to new emotions and conflicts for the boys.  He was distressed to see Bunny so upset, but there was also the relief that, over the course of the weekend at the lake, Bunny had become far less hesitant towards expressing his emotions.  Mycroft had seen John cry more often in the past three days than he had during months of ageplay previously.
John was unaware just how long the panic attack lasted.  But eventually Mycroft’s steady, unending counting and his practiced tone became prominent over the flashbacks and agitation, and John, exhausted and gasping for breath, collapsed to the floor at his feet.  Mycroft was beside him in a moment, arm wrapped around his shoulder protectively.
“Couldn’t get the knot undone in time,” he said.  “I went in my pants by accident, but then I couldn’t tell because I didn't want anyone to know I put on a pull-up.”
Papa’s voice was no-nonsense and demanding as he continued to jiggle the doorknob.  Sherlock pressed the juice box harder, willing the liquid to squirt out more quickly, clumsily aiming as he glanced back over his shoulder at the door.  He was grateful the video game was still waiting for him to choose to restart the level, bright electronic music repeating again and again; it would have been one more thing he’d needed to do before opening the door had the game shut off while he’d been gone.
Bunny glanced up at him for a moment, but then his face fell, and he was crying again, Sherlock’s reminder of his torn paper dolls apparently too much to take.  But Papa Greg was nodding for Sherlock to go on as he rubbed Bunny’s back, and when Sherlock glanced back over his shoulder at Mycroft, he simply raised one eyebrow, as if he were expecting more.
Greg chuckled again, patting the boy’s knee to calm him after reaching across his chest and clicking his seat belt back into place.
Mycroft cleared his throat.  He’d been hoping to make it through the night without having to come to terms with his own moodiness, but he’d known it was unlikely given the way Greg had been peppering him with concerned questions throughout the night.  He nodded to acknowledge Greg’s request.
Papa only glanced across the kitchen with worry towards Mycroft, however.  Mycroft was keeping an eye on Bunny while simultaneously watching the conversation between Sherlock and Papa.  He had a hand resting on the back of Bunny's neck, and was nodding at the boy as he energetically chattered and sorted through stickers, holding up first one style and then another for Mycroft’s input.  Sherlock turned to press his face back into the darkness of his crossed arms when Papa turned back towards him.
“Stop it, Papa,” Sherlock said, because he could tell Uncle Greg liked the idea, that he would very much like being Papa.
He and Greg stationed themselves in the window seat on the far end of the living room, Mycroft sitting straight-backed while Greg slumped against the side of the bookcase, one leg up on the cushion on which they were seated.  He passed Mycroft his tea cup after retrieving their drinks, which he had carried in from the kitchen, from the coffee table.
John’s sort of self-harm generally involved massive hangovers and nameless faces in any number of indistinguishable bedrooms instead of sharp objects, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t familiar with the type of demeaning self-talk that plagued Sherlock on his darkest days.  They were both men tormented by their pasts, often struggling to keep their heads above water.  Age regression helped, but that didn’t mean they weren’t still challenged by persistent, underlying thoughts of their own worthlessness.
“I sat out here in case he decided to run,” Greg explained, part of him needing to convince Mycroft he had at least taken responsibility for his mistake.  “And he did try.  But, when he opened the door, he saw me and decided against leaving.  Now he’s barricaded himself inside.”
There was a hole where a tree branch had long ago damaged the roof, so the snow was falling from the ceiling, leaving a white patch in a streak across the floorboards.  John watched it falling through the criss-crossed tree branches high overhead.
“Sherlock, I have to go,” Bunny said when he couldn’t stand it any longer. His voice was quiet, cheeks pinking beneath the tear-stains.  He squeezed his thighs together and wiggled in place.  He knew Sherlock had noticed his problem long minutes ago, had chosen to ignore it.  Sherlock himself had to go too, Bunny could tell.  He’d squeezed between his legs a time or two while they played.  But Sherlock could hold it longer than Bunny could, he had more practice at it, which only made Bunny feel littler.
“Daddy, too.  I want you to forget what he may have said or how he behaved before, princess.  Daddy was telling you the truth today when he said he supports you just as you are.  It’s only fair of us to take him at his word.  Okay?”
“There may have been a bloody nose involved,” Greg relented with a sigh.  “And what I hope wasn't a broken cheekbone.”
The tears were fat and fast, and he soon found himself not just crying, but blubbering, making guttural sounds in his throat as he threw his head back and sobbed.
Bunny was skipping into the kitchen a moment later, followed closely by Papa, who crossed to Mycroft with a glance that Sherlock would have been able to read had he been in an older headspace.  At the moment, he didn’t have much interest in interpreting the silent conversations Papa and Mycroft could have over his and Bunny’s heads, and instead held up his half-colored planet towards Bunny, who was climbing onto his knees in the chair beside him.
Bunny twitched a bit on the carpet.  He’d lied to Daddy earlier when he’d asked if he needed the potty, and now it was getting to be a bit of an emergency.  He was about to set down his sippy cup and make his way to the potty like a big kid.
"I'm here, little one," Papa said, holding him close as he rocked him were he stood.  "Papa's right here, brave boy."
“Well, for the sake of argument let’s pretend I’ve given you sufficient time to hem and haw over the embarrassment you feel regarding your choice to identify as female while young yesterday and move along to what made you age up and leave Mycroft’s flat so abruptly.”
I would love to take another day or two to tighten this chapter up and get it where I'd like it to be, but because I won't have a day off for another week and two days, I figured that might not be realistic.  So, I figured it would be best to get it posted so all of you lovely humans can at least have a continuation of the story! Let me know if you have any feedback--this is definitely one I may go back to edit at a future date!
Bunny reached out and placed a hand on Sherlock’s back, then traced his fingers along Sherlock’s bony spine in an attempt to soothe him.  He drew stars and thunderclouds with his finger along Sherlock’s back, relieved when Sherlock did not tell him off or pull farther away.
Mycroft may not have understood Sherlock’s words, but he had caught onto Sherlock’s distress, and despite Sherlock’s feeble protests, he lifted the slighter man into his lap and rubbed his back while he cried.
Mycroft continued after draining his glass.  “I...I have grown rather attached to little John, as well, and I need you to know he could never inconvenience me, certainly not for something which he needs at his core to find happiness and confidence.  I don't view you as tagging along while Sherlock ageplays.  You're as much worthy of your own experience as Sherlock is.  That's why I was disappointed in myself over what happened today.  I slipped in my duties to keep you happiest and taken care of in your little space.  I allowed something to happen that you did not desire or ask for.  Do you understand?”
He screamed and flailed for longer than he thought he ever had before, kicking against the wall where he had been set into the corner and hitting at Uncle Greg and Mycroft’s hands when they attempted to steady him.  He was alone, and angry, and no longer able to find the best frogs, and Mycroft liked John better than him, which he didn’t know how to deal with besides yelling and kicking and hitting.
Thanks for your support and wonderful comments on the last few chapters! I can't believe this story has almost reached over 50,000 words!  You've all been such great supporters of my writing and this series, and I am very grateful.
“Let’s start here,” Mycroft said, sitting up and taking charge in a way that calmed John’s nerves.  He had been unsure how to begin the conversation that he knew they needed to have, so it was comforting to simply follows Mycroft’s lead.
John turned back over his shoulder with eyebrows raised, but Sherlock was rolling his eyes towards the screen, unconscious of John’s attention.
John continued stroking the boy’s back even after he could feel the steady rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest signalling that he had fallen asleep.  If anyone had any doubts about little space being beneficial for Sherlock, they only had to see how much easier it was for Sherlock to fall asleep when young, and John knew they would never doubt again.
That said, he couldn’t help but find it frustratingly ironic that the day the political geography of England was threatened by opportunism was the same day Greg had been called into work and John had insisted on tagging along.  Mycroft, as a rule, kept very strict boundaries between his home and work life.  At the moment, however, he had no option but to to handle things as quickly and efficiently as possible while hoping Sherlock would be content with some extra time in front of the telly.
“Fuck, I can’t…,” John breathed, twisting his legs around the hand in his crotch and nearly thrashing in bed as he regained control of himself.  “Sherlock, I’m going to wet myself...oh god...the mattress.”
John, catching eyes once more with Sherlock, decided to give in to the man’s crooked grin.  He sighed, letting some of the tense rigidity of his shoulders slip away as he stood and crossed to his chair.  He lifted Sherlock’s coat from the cushion to free a spot for himself, and sat.
Greg turned down the music on the radio, knowing the boy would be asleep in moments.  He was grateful, knowing John hadn’t slept well the night before.  They really needed to get the kids back into a routine, and Greg wished not for the first time that their schedules would allow for set, planned ageplay sessions.  It was when the boys had gone far too long without the emotional release that they ran into trouble.  Maybe if he'd insisted John take some time out to be Bunny, the man wouldn't have gotten into a fist fight with Greg's primary crime scene technician in a dingy motel room.
But being the big brother was harder than being the little brother.  Being a good big brother took a lot of watching, thinking ahead, and accommodating.  Bunny didn’t know if he had the energy to be the big brother while his throat hurt and his eyes and nose were all runny from what Papa had called a “nasty head cold," not to mention while suffering from an extreme lack of sleep and a confused, doubt-filled mind.
“I’ll be back soon, princess,” Papa called over Bunny’s tears, reaching down to squeeze his shoulder in a makeshift goodbye, which only made Bunny cry more loudly.
“Get some sleep, my little princess,” he whispered, and Bunny nodded, nuzzling up against Sherlock, who was sleeping peacefully.
“They’re the same as always, Bun,” he said, knowing there were few options for pull-ups that would fit an adult, and knowing that Greg would have consulted him before trying a new brand.  “Let’s use up the rest of these ones and then we’ll open the new package, okay?”
They wouldn’t fool Mycroft, who would know what a line of four plasters meant, but they would hide the cuts, and maybe, if Bunny was small enough, he could be convinced Sherlock had just gotten an owie.
Sherlock reached to feel the wetness spreading down his thigh even as he kept defiant eye contact with Papa.  The naughtiness settled his mind a bit.  He had coaxed a pseudo-disciplinarian out of Papa, could see the man weighing options for punishment.  He needed him to take charge, to start making demands.
The forensics team made quick work of the room, entering with their latex gloves and full-body coveralls to assess the scene and begin processing evidence in the bathroom.  Greg supervised and organized each team in turn before leaving the room to meet Donovan when she arrived, taking her through the updated information they’d gleaned.
But it was far too late.  Daddy twisted in his seat, and Bunny could see the expression on his face shift from one of concern to one of exasperation as he realized that Bunny wasn’t
Sherlock could not take it any longer.  Papa was so understanding and Mycroft was so close, and Bunny, sitting watching him from where he’d been helping Papa with the puzzle, had clearly already forgiven his pinching.  He’d spent the entire day lying to them all, and the heavy pull-up between his legs was a sinister reminder of his shortcomings.  Sherlock’s face fell, and he started to cry.
I hope you're all doing well!  I know I need to get back to Sherlock and Mycroft in this story, but I'm having such fun writing about Christmas at the Lestrades.  TrailsandRoses made a great point that Greg's mom would be great with the Bunny, and the idea wouldn't leave my mind until I'd written a bit along those lines, so thank you to TrailsandRoses and to all of you wonderful readers for your thoughts, ideas, and encouragement!
And then Sherlock was shifting them, guiding John to lay on his back in the space Sherlock had just vacated.  He took the man’s pajama pants by the waist and began pulling them off slowly.  John raised his hips to allow Sherlock to pull them off completely.  Sherlock dropped the pajama pants to the floor and then situated himself over John, shifting one thigh until it was carefully pressed against the pull-up, just between John’s legs.
Greg rooted around in the bedside table and was rewarded when he came up with a spare pacifier, which he held out on the flat of his palm towards Sherlock, whose thumb had made its way into his mouth.  The boy hesitated for only a moment before accepting it, and he pushed it into his mouth as Greg settled into bed between the boys, pulling the blankets up to Bunny’s chin and lifting an arm to wrap around Sherlock as the boy lay his head on his chest.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and bid them goodnight, leaning over to kiss their mother on the cheek as he gave in to her sentiment before turning down the hall to trudge up the stairs.  Sherlock was all too happy to follow close behind.
It was unclear exactly what had brought about John’s foray into fighting with Anderson.  He’d seen the effects of the man’s temper a time or two, knew John certainly had moments where he gave into the seething anger he often felt and thus resorted to violence.  It was, gratefully, a personality trait that plagued adult John often and their mild-mannered Bunny rather infrequently, but it was nevertheless a part of the make-up of John Watson, fits of rage looming like his PTSD-nightmares and Sherlock’s tendency towards self-harm.  Greg wanted so badly to save his kids from the pain they felt, from the thoughts that drew them towards unhealthy and destructive coping mechanisms, but, at the moment, all he could do was assure John that he was loved, and get him home to where he would feel safe.
Mycroft had just put the seasoned chicken into the oven and was beginning to prepare the broccoli when he heard shouting from the other room.  He paused, and Sherlock’s raised voice was heard over Bunny’s tears.
John didn’t want to have to save parts of his little personality for specific nights, but a part of him he still had trouble acknowledging couldn’t bear the thought of losing Mycroft as his caretaker.  He turned to glance at him.
They all turned to look at John, who blinked up at Sherlock, turned to Mycroft, and then nodded slowly.
“I was afraid you wouldn’t like it,” John said quietly, unable to be anything except fully honest in the moment.  “I was afraid you would want me to stop being your little brother.”
Bunny glanced up from his spot snuggled with his blanket and bunny rabbit on the couch and shook his head.
“I think I managed to convince Anderson not to take it further for the moment,” Greg explained.  “I reminded him that any investigation would bring his own professionalism before the incident into scrutiny, which seemed to at least sober him enough to question the effectiveness of pressing charges.  Donovan took him to get checked out, and promised to follow-up.”
Bunny didn’t generally crave or prompt discipline in the same way that Sherlock did, but maybe that was what he needed currently? Some firm attention and a chance to settle his mind during a punishment?  Bunny had been pushing boundaries all morning; maybe he’d be up for finally telling Mycroft what was bothering him after a little quiet time.
Sherlock had found himself embarrassingly enamored with the films, the little boy Mycroft had allowed him to be for most of the car ride not far from the surface as night settled around them in the living room.  If it hadn’t been for Mycroft’s well-timed clearing of the throat after Sherlock had actually giggled at a magical turn of events in the film, Sherlock may have failed completely in his desire to hide his little self from his parents.
It was Sherlock who heard footsteps first, turning to glance down the hallway.  Soon after, they all heard the door opening, and Greg’s voice ringing out down the hallway.
“I don’t…” John was breathing heavily, blinking up at Mycroft at last.  He turned to glance at Greg, whose brow was furrowed as he began understanding that something was going on, and then back to Mycroft.  Mycroft did not look away.
Greg chuckled and patted the boy’s leg, grateful the day had begun on a happier note than the day before.  He deposited the boy on the floor of the living room next to Sherlock, who was eating small bites of scrambled eggs from a kid’s plate set on the floor in front of him as he watched cartoons.

“Okay, champ,” Papa said, guiding John towards the backseat before opening the door.  “Let’s get you into the car.”
Greg placed the final items into the dresser and took a seat on the end the bed.  He patted the mattress, signalling for Sherlock to take a seat beside him.
John turned over towards Greg and blinked awake.  He looked sleepy and content, and tried to crawl closer to snuggle up to the man.
His father had never left motel rooms easily; John often attracted quite a few onlookers as he wrestled his belligerent father--screaming threats and curses and often lashing out physically--into the back seat of the car.  He’d found the role reversal ironic even then: a fifteen-year-old with only a learner’s permit driving his drunken father--passed out in the back seat--home.  He always drove the speed limit and follow the traffic laws, even if his father was conscious enough to jeer and yell at his over cautious driving.  The consequences wouldn't have been good for either of them if John were ever to have been pulled over.
“I put him down for a nap,” she said, throwing a dish towel over her shoulder as she crossed to the fridge to retrieve the Egg Nog.
“I had a little accident,” he said, as if the evidence weren’t spreading across the plastic sheet towards Sherlock as he spoke.
Bunny was not ready to give in, and he did all he could to get out of timeout, wiggling away from Mycroft’s grasp and kicking out when he tried to block his escape from the corner.  Mycroft had no option but to put the kid over his knee and spank him through his nightshirt and training pants until Bunny became compliant and stayed in the corner, crying into his hands.
Bunny began shimmying out of his jeans as Greg left to pop open the boot of the car.  He was hoping he’d remembered correctly about having an old blanket tucked away somewhere, and was relieved when he found it pressed beside the spare tire.
“That’s lovely,” Sherlock said, busy with his own cock, which he rutted against John’s hip furiously before snatching his fingers from where they had been pressing along John’s groin and shoving them into his own pajama trousers.  “Piss your pants for me, love.”
I'm not entirely happy with this chapter for a few different reasons.  I must have jinxed myself by writing about Bunny and Sherlock getting sick because now I have a head cold that has come at a not so great time.  Add in a lack of space and time to write and some general family drama and you've got the unlucky circumstances that birthed this chapter.  Nevertheless, I wanted to get it to you all before we all get too busy with holiday events/shopping/celebrations, and sometimes you've just got to get the work out there and move forward.
“How long have you been in a wet pull-up?” Papa asked with concern in his voice, bringing a pink blush to Sherlock’s cheeks.
“That’s more than okay, Sherlock,” he said.  “But you know it may be harder to age up once you allow yourself the time.  Do you understand that?”
