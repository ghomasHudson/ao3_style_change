Steve delivers his best speech before launch and spends time with each of the department heads who are on the bridge, smiling and shaking hands, telling everyone how honoured he is to have a chance to be working with them.
Tony’s lips brush against Steve’s face and his cheeks tingle from the touch. “So you’re saying that was the only time you were a jerk?”
so much, he tells himself as he listens to Tony explaining the theory of Carbonara's origin being related to Carboneria, and he repeats it to himself that he
The omega lying on the table, as Steve’s last customer tonight, is too quiet, if anything. Too pliant, with a beautiful wide smile, that makes something tingle at the back of Steve’s neck, and a chill go down his spine.
Steve doesn’t want to sit down. Not really, because it’s a bit uncomfortable. Very, to be precise, but he’s not sure how he should explain the problem, so he hums, shifts on his feet a little, and takes a step back, as if trying to take up less space, so his thighs hit the edge of the examination table.
He hands the bag to Nat, walks around the bed and sits next to Bruce who is now examining Tony’s fingers. He gestures to Captain Rogers without looking up from Tony’s swollen fingers and a familiar shudder of fear runs through Tony's chest and stabs his heart. Captain Rogers cannot care less about the
He turns and wonders if he's ever seen anything more beautiful than the deep lines that form around Tony's mouth as his face lights up into a smile.
He then tilts his head to the side and his eyes are suddenly serious. He looks at Tony with narrowed eyes, pressing his lips together before he opens his mouth to speak again. “This particular one was … impossible to miss, really. SI was in the news for a whole two weeks and every single show on every single channel talked about it at some point. It was kind of a great deal, wasn’t it?”
“Drugs?” Steve starts and leans forward quickly, and damn, just fuck this shit, because the supposedly durable best-quality disaster moves in his ass, which makes Steve dig his fingers into the examination table and shiver a little.
Steve narrows his eyes as he brings his hands up Tony’s back and the prickling sensation shoots up Tony’s spine this time. Steve then pouts in a fake displease and a million tiny bubbles fill the inside of Tony’s chest. “So what about me? Not feeling lucky that I admire you?” And his pout turns into a soft smile and crinkles to the corner of the eyes.
for providing mask sewing essentials to volunteer households that he emails to Pepper around midday is just flawless and the initial approval of $100k funding from Scholastic to start the ‘Kids at Home’ educational video channel that shows up in Tony’s inbox shortly after is kinda impossible. The way Steve never forgets to include his gratitude for Amy’s help in each and every one of his 18 unbelievably polite but sharp emails, makes Tony’s heart do a happy dance and Tony makes a mental note: Steve does not take shit from anyone, even if they happen to be the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America.
He is fascinated by this guy’s eyes and his jokes and the most beautiful laugh he has ever heard, but it’s not just that. There is something about sitting here and blushing shyly that feels right. It feels to have been decided for him by a greater power, somehow, that had brought him to this bar randomly and had made him stick around even after the disastrous approach from that previous douche bag. Not that Steve wants to get spiritual about meeting a sexy man, but he feels like he's been waiting for this for so long, for eternity maybe.
Time somehow loses its meaning. It might be minutes, or hours, that Steve is lying on the table, his brain being stretched and relaxed along with his hole, and it’s not hurting any more for some reason, no guilt, no pressure, no burn. The brown eyes looking up at him from time to time might be the reason; the smiles, the professional reassurance that Steve’s brain decidedly takes as praise. The acceptance maybe, that it’s out of his hands now, the unexpected trust, the safe feeling that’s wrapped around his flushed body like cold water in this hot mess of a summer afternoon.
“Yeah?” Tony’s lips tremble a little, making Steve’s heart squeeze painfully. “Because from where I’m standing, it looks the exact opposite.”
Tony is flying. He might also be sinking because he struggles for air with each breath and every small movement sends a wave of pain all over his body. This doesn’t seem like a good idea anymore, but to be fair, it wasn't a particularly good idea an hour ago either. It was the only idea, a vision that came to him when Ty left the room to get back to their guest without locking the door and a strand of hope that he had five minutes to hang on to before it was gone forever. It seemed crazy and impossible to even get to Captain Rogers' vintage Camaro parked at the front without being seen and Tony is still not sure how he has managed to fit into what must be the tiniest trunk of all American-made cars. But now, the adrenaline that rushed him down the stairs and out of the back door is gone and all that is left is doubt, pain and horror. He is stuck in a practical coffin that some people hide dead bodies in and wonders if he will end up as one, before he sees the sky ever again.
“$150k. Yes, I know that but you wouldn't have to spend this much money if it wasn’t for me. This-” Steve sways his finger between them “-this has nothing to do with me. It’s your money and your connections, I just happened to be standing there in the corner.” And he sighs as he goes back to rubbing the back of his neck.
Tony shakes his head. Again. And then one more time. He feels like he is losing consciousness as things seem to get away from him, like he is soaring up or being pushed back. His brain reprocesses the words he has just heard but there is no other possible meaning to them. Something blocks his airway and his mouth suddenly feels like a desert. He can vauguly feel Ty’s hold tightening around his arm, yet instead of the usual shiver a fire line runs through his chest and burns his heart.
Time freezes and the world stops turning when Tony’s lips touch Steve’s cock. He is melting. He might actually have evaporated somehow and the only part of him that's still there is the point of contact between his body and Tony’s. He can’t see. He can’t breathe. He can’t think. All that there is, is Tony and his lips moving on Steve, up and down in an insanely slow rhythm. It’s soft and gentle, like his kisses and his touch, and it’s firm and tight, as he has held Steve over the past two days.
He slowly turns his head towards Ty, expecting to bite his tongue and shut up as he always does just seeing the discontented look on Ty’s face, and he is surprised to hear the sound of his own voice. It’s small and almost quiet, but it is there.
There are beers on the coffee table in front of the TV, and a giant pizza box that Tony puts on Steve’s lap as soon as he sits down. Bollo is allegedly the best pizza in all of Texas, and Tony would have gotten more if he was not worried about already being on Steve’s bad side today, not willing to make it any worse by overspending. Steve pretends to not feel the slight sting of the words but his hands go cold for a second when he is opening the pizza box.
Tony looks relieved, for whatever reason. He smiles back at Steve, takes a deep breath and sits as Steve gestures to the chair on Tony’s side of the table.
“I step forward, you step back, one, two, three, four. Just keep going with me, don’t let a gap come between us.” Steve listens to Tony count, his body moving the way Tony directs, as Tony leans in a little with every step and he holds on to Tony’s shoulder, his fingers pressing a little too hard, maybe.
He is busy, obviously, and he seems happy the few times he does, in fact, show up at Tony’s door, with random questions about the number of StarkPads SI can refurbish in a week, or to let Tony know that Mr. Osbourne is happy to join the ‘stay at home celebrity video chat’ initiative, as long as Tony gives him a call himself.
I hope it was worth the wait :) I am hoping to write the final chapter in the next week because I'm desperate to close this one off.
nervous, if he ignores his sweaty palms and flushed cheeks, and the way his heart is racing in his chest.
“I’m all good, thank you for asking,” Steve says, coughing again, not sounding very convincing, but his awkward smile grows even wider. What if he brought his own hand up to cover Tony’s? Would it be too inappropriate if he just pressed Tony’s body to the wall right here, and kissed him?
He might have said that out loud because Captain Rogers turns the radio off and Tony might be imagining it, or he might already be asleep and dreaming, but after the long and excruciating silence,  Captain Rogers finally says something.
A quick light angst warning for the first part of the chapter, in case you don't want to read angst at all these days. I hope you give it a try anyway, because it kinda gets better from there :))
“I promise to eat whatever weird thing you make from the leftovers, and you can make sure I don’t spend too much on things that don’t really matter,” Tony says after a deep breath, the rush of warm air making a line of fire burn down Steve’s neck while Tony’s words become more real, yet more dreamy.
“Not gonna thank me for the treat?” Steve says, pulling his own pants up, “kiss me soft and sweet and tell me you love me?”
“He’s an O, Steve,” Clint says as he walks past to sit on a chair, “Omegas should be treated more gently.”
That’s it for cool and casual, Tony tells himself as he gets off his chair and does his best to not run, just walk. “It has everything to do with you, Steve,” he whispers as he lays his head on Steve’s chest forgetting why he is holding Steve altogether, for a second at least, because Steve brings up his free hand and presses Tony to himself. “And a househusband without an apron? Pffft. Definitely not.”
Steve shuffles closer to Tony. “You tell me first. I was almost jealous of Batman for no reason apparently.”
Steve blinks and tilts his head. He starts to shiver, as tears run down his face and that’s it, the last bit of Tony’s resolve to respect this invisible boundary, or
Steve should know much better than that. He is a grown-ass man, an adult for God’s sake, and he’d better get a hang of himself right this second before he makes things more awkward for either of them. So he does just that, he takes a deep breath and stops staring at the patch of skin that’s showing from the slightly skewed neckline of Tony’s t-shirt. He pours coffee in the matching cups he may or may not have taken a minute to find in the cupboard, before looking back at Tony with the fakest happy smile of his lifetime.
Steve’s hand darts forward on its own accord as his body goes hot on the surface and starts to shiver inside.
Everything freezes for a moment, except for his cock, which is stuck in the magical land of permanent erection, and all of his body becomes numb.
. He literally sacrificed himself to save the world. I have nothing to be ashamed of for loving the guy with my whole heart.” And the sincere pride in his tone fills Steve’s chest with a million butterflies.
The door to the examination room opens with a dreadful screech, and Steve turns on his heels to watch the unexpectedly young doctor walk in.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to Jeh and fiftyshades, guys, this is your work as much as mine, I could not have done it without you guys <3333
This is not a date, definitely not, but Tony keeps asking all the first date questions. He frowns when Steve says he can't disclose his age and narrows his eyes because Steve can’t really disclose his job either. It is weird and kinda funny the way his eyes go to normal size and then pop with surprise when Steve says he is in the business of global security and the fact that Tony jumps to the possibility of Steve being
Tony is too weak to take a shower now, or at least that’s what Captain Rogers thinks so Nat disappears into the bathroom to get some wet towels to help Tony clean up. Captain Rogers helps Tony off the bed and onto the couch and puts the ice bag on his fingers before covering him with the blue blanket. Bruce strips the dirty sheets from the bed and Clint leaves the plate of actual blueberry cookies on the arm of the couch. Sam pokes his head into the room
I am sorry if I made you cry guys, and I hope I made up for it after? hugs and kisses for everyone and Steve, you're okay baby, we love you so much :))
Thank you to fiftyshadesofstony, and JehBeeEh for beta, guys you make my work readable and I really really appreciate your help <3<3<3
have one? A celebrity crush?” he says lightly, before pulling forward just a little bit to press his face to the warmth of Steve’s chest.
Captain Rogers is as patient on the way back up to the bedroom as he was on the way down earlier in the morning.
“Hey, hey, hey, breathe,” Steve says, too commanding maybe, but there is only so much of the growling dragon inside that he can keep from bursting out. “I’m not leaving, and you’re not a loser. You kicked him out, and I’d be honored to help you clean up the mess, as much as I can.”
Steve’s beautiful face lights up in a sweet smile and earnest sparkles shine in his eyes. That’s all that matters, Tony tells himself as he swallows around the lump that’s starting to hurt in his throat. The fact that it means something to Steve, that there is a slim chance, far away in the distance, that Tony will end up making him proud, even if it means pain and anxiety in the road to get there; even if the only way is by bearing bruises on his skin and deep wounds upon his soul.
“Steve,” Tony whispers in his ear, shaky and breathless, “you’re just--” he can’t form any more words as his fingers find Steve’s nipples again and Steve shudders in a flood of sensation. It takes a minute, or an hour, Steve can’t be quite sure, for Tony to rub and pinch and flick Steve’s nipples before Steve can’t hold it together any longer.
She shakes her head again as she takes a smaller bag out of one of the shopping bags and Tony thinks about the blood stains on a proper-for-a-private-dinner white shirt last night to distract himself from the fact that Captain Rogers had asked Nat to buy clothes for Tony in specific colors. Or the fact that he had remembered to ask for underwear and socks too, and everything else in the small bag that Nat’s unloading on the dressing table right now, written down on the piece of paper that she’s just dropped on Tony’s lap. It’s nothing special really, just a neatly handwritten list with smooth letters that are exactly the same size, so there is no reason for this stupid heat that's suddenly spreading over his chest and that weird sensation that's unexpectedly tingling the back of his neck. He doesn't the spoons - even a plastic teaspoon - for feeling weird about a fucking note, no, just no, so he crumples the paper and shoves it in his pocket, so he can throw it in the bathroom rubbish bin as soon as he can stand up.
Steve turned towards the sea before Tony could work out what the wrinkle in his forehead meant. The sudden shift made Steve's oversized shirt slide down a little further and the sight of the bite mark on Steve’s neck made Tony’s heart clench. The scent of Steve’s skin, the warmth of his breath, the memory of his fingers digging into Tony’s sides, filled Tony’s head and a teardrop fled from one eye before he squeezed them shut. The desire for this delicate, wonderful human coursed through Tony’s veins, not that the flame had ever gone completely out, since that first time he set eyes on him. Shame followed as always, making Tony loathe his entire being for thinking that way about Steve, who did not deserve any of this. He balled his fists and pressed them firmly into his thighs, to keep his desperate fingers from touching the bite mark. He was better than this. He could keep it together a bit longer.
“It would be great to have a superpower that makes you not need food, I am kinda jealous. But it’s great that someone can make you eat, even if it’s by threatening to kill you. I already like Ms. Potts, very much.” Steve says, lightly, as he contemplates eating one more peanut butter sandwich.
There is something magical about that smile. It’s beautiful and earnest and it kinda lights up the guy’s face. Sparkles shine in his eyes and butterflies start to fly in Steve's stomach. Things seem to run away, all of a sudden; and he feels like he is 20 again, carefree and shy and damn he is absolutely blushing.
“At least the pancakes are good.” Tony winks, and something goes loose in Steve’s belly. “There is always a silver lining, right? I could’ve woken up with ‘Ty’s Bitch’ on my fucking neck, and I tell you this, the guy can’t cook shit if his life depends on it."
Counting like that makes Tony realize that one thousand is not enough. Not even barely there. Five thousand maybe? Ten? How many times would he have touched Steve after a lifetime? A lot. He doesn’t want to count. He can go without knowing, with keeping it open and hopeful as long as it comes to Steve.
“Well someone took all my clothes off,” Steve chimes as Tony sips his coffee and lets out a small moan, “and I’d wear the damn apron if you’d freakin’ buy one for me,
He had a thing for his boyfriend’s best friend, and instead of feeling wrong and ashamed, the realization felt like a hot swirl of want in his belly.
“I’m already impressed.” Steve puts his fork down and tilts his head, watching Tony’s forehead unwrinkle, and his laugh lines deepen. He then stands up and walks around the table, to wrap his hands around Tony’s shoulders and breathe in the coconut scent of his hair. “I’m very very impressed.”
Captain Rogers wipes his eyes with his hands and takes a deep breath. He is not laughing anymore but his voice is still ringing with happiness. “They do send things. By mail, as I have not agreed to receive emails yet. There have  been stories about Stark Industries weapons in them too but not this particular one.”
He reaches for Tony and his fingers lay on Tony’s stomach. “Please,” he pleads, or begs but he doesn’t really care, “please, Tony, please, I can’t wait anymore.”
“It was nothing,” Steve replies nonchalantly, but something bubbles in his heart and spills into his chest. “Punching bullies, and making you happy?” He peppers quick kisses on the corner of Tony’s mouth. “I can do this all day.”
He finds himself moving things around to make them look nice on the table, but he doesn’t get a chance to feel embarrassed about it, as Tony shows up at the breakfast area, pulling a t-shirt over his head. He has that sleepy glow, his hair adorably mussed and Steve has to reach for the coffee pot to keep his hands busy; to not reach over and push Tony’s hair away from his forehead.
“How?” he asks, his voice too small, despite the fact that his insides are somehow boiling with what felt like liquid fire. “How—” And there is no sound coming out of his throat anymore, as the fire might have burnt his throat altogether.
I mean this whole fic is one giant sappiness altogether but I think I have outdone myself in being so sappy and head over heels for my boys, because God I love them so much I can write 4.6k of Steve appreciation and go in circles only slightly :))))
, Commander Barton. It’s not a furnace where you just add more coal.” Tony shifts in his seat from across the room and shakes his head. “Instead of working on hilarious solutions, could we please have detailed information on the number of crew and passengers and a diagram of their acceleration toward the event horizon?”
Tony blushes and hides his face in Steve’s chest. “Jeeze, Captain, you’ll give me a heart attack if you keep talking like  this.” and the way his voice shakes slightly, makes Steve’s heart do a silent happy dance.
Tags are changed so please make sure you mind them before reading if you are worried about triggers. One tag is missing due to spoilers. Please refer to endnotes for more details before reading if you are concerned.
Tony turns toward Steve yelling from the top of his lungs, and a comical mix of shock and relief washes over him visibly.
Steve swallows as he starts to walk, “and I think I need to take a shower," sounding louder and more clear this time.
to smile at  Dr. Morbius when he spoke  about his grandson and make small conversation about how he is a really strong boy who will present as alpha, just like his father.
Steve moves down Tony’s chest and licks those few scars in the middle. This doesn’t just feel like it's the first time; this actually
Tony nibbles at Steve’s neck, and kisses his Adam’s apple. “Oh Batman is awesome, don’t get me wrong,” he says, suddenly tired with the roller coaster ride that’s been the last day of week one of self-isolation, “but he is nowhere and let me repeat this, nowhere as brave, and kind, and smart, and amazing as my guy.” And he yawns against Steve’s shoulder.
Dr. Stark throws his head back and laughs out loud. “Oh God, no, I love helping people.” And he laughs some more, and Steve watches him, wondering how inappropriate it will be if he wraps an arm around this perfectly-shaped waist to pull Dr. Stark onto his lap. “It’s just that I feel like building things is my true calling. I don’t fit this mold that my dad shoved me into, and it’s just so frustrating, being stuck doing what others expect from you. You know what I mean?”
He did not have a dream, not exactly, but he can feel the cold stickiness that’s creeping under his skin. He can still breathe and his teeth are not chattering, but there is a weight pressing at his chest and he is numb and sweaty.
It probably is, Tony tells himself, as it’s time to stop dreaming and wake up, anytime now. Especially if the guy he loves happens to be Steve Rogers; pure concentrated perfection.
knowledge of modern art he has acquired from eye balling the auction catalogues his curators send him.
“Easy ha? And you tell me now, while I’ve been trying so fucking hard to get into your pants,” and he leans forward to kiss Steve’s nose, which is starting to flush red again.
The last thing he wants in this world is to throw up - and ruin Captain Rogers’s front seat like the back - so he closes his eyes and tries to listen to the blend of emotions in the artist’s voice at least for a few seconds. The concept of freedom, as familiar as it must be for this 200 lbs of alpha perfection, is so distant for Tony - who hates himself for not daring to touch the stupid window crank handle - that he never even allows himself to dream of it. He just can’t think about a shadow of it without getting worked up, and he needs a minute, or a few before he can open his eyes, and his mouth to ask any questions.
Tears ran down Tony’s face as he trembled and panted in Steve’s arms. Steve wiped Tony’s tears away, with no questions, holding on to Tony, caressing his hair, whispering all the miraculous words that Tony loved to hear. Tony breathed in Steve’s scent, unable to hold the tears back. He couldn’t lose Steve, even if the place he was taking right now was supposed to belong to someone else.
“You are not allergic to peanuts, Tony?” Tony turns and Sam’s face is as calming as his voice. He shakes his head and Sam taps on Captain Rogers’ shoulder a couple of times before he walks around the bed to stand next to Nat and Clint. “Strawberry jam? You should buy some blueberry jam, Steve.”
“It’s all my fault. I shouldn't have fallen in love with him. I shouldn't have offered to bond with him. I should have called off the search for Mr. James fucking Barnes at the very least.” Tony set the empty teacup down. “I am so stupid, Jarvis. Why am I always so stupid?”
and their tiny flat, or the fact that he doesn’t ignore the help like every other person Tony has ever dined with, but Tony’s heart does a flip flop in his chest and a warm wave of calm washes over him. He smiles back almost involuntarily and for a moment forgets where he is and what he is doing here.
Maybe it’s the suddenly distinctive Brooklyn accent, or the way his voice cracks when he talks about his
Steve Rogers, just licked “I love you” on him, and he is allowed to be out of order for a bit; or for a lifetime.
Steve gets to be Captain America in Iron Man’s arms because Tony is not afraid of putting fantasies into words and doesn’t mind pretending to be the man of Steve’s fantasies even more than he already is. He does blush but keeps talking about how Iron Man and Captain America meet for a battle and kisses Steve’s heated cheeks and parted lips as Steve chokes to say his lines about seducing Iron Man after the battle, the few first times.
And Steve holds on to that shred when they go to Thanos’s garden. He digs his fingers into its invisible tiny threads, refusing to believe that the stones are gone for good, and ties it into little imaginary butterfly knots to keep from bending in half when the splash of Thanos's blood paints a red line on the wall.
Tony’s hands slide down and start to unbuckle Steve’s belt. “You’re just beautiful. Firm and strong and so perfectly muscled and yet it takes a gentle touch to that perfect hair, to make you blush to the back of your neck.” Steve can’t decide what he needs to focus on; Tony’s words, or the way he sucks at the base of Steve’s neck, his fingers rolling over the tip of Steve’s cock or the dishes that he has magically managed to wash and pile up on top of each other and are waiting to be rinsed.
Thank you to fiftyshadesofstony, Succubus Kayko and JehBeeEh for beta, guys you make my work readable and I really really appreciate your help <3<3<3
Steve thinks about the way Tony had shown him, a perfect stranger, heaven this morning without even suggesting that Steve should do something in return. Steve has not done any of it before, true, but he is sure as hell that this is
he might have made a few lists in some of his notebooks. Right now, however, all he can do is immerse himself in the touches and kisses and words and blush, God, all over his almost naked body.
No one yells though. No blows come out of nowhere. The swish in the air is not a hand being raised, it’s just a phone being fished out of a pocket, but Tony can’t help but flinch when Captain Rogers holds the phone out to him.
Steve’s managed to rinse more than half of the dishes when Tony’s fingers slide between his cheeks, suddenly warm and sleek. That’s what the quick weird noise must have been a couple of minutes ago, right before Tony’s hands had moved away from Steve’s balls and toward his back. The steam of last night’s memories cloud Steve’s mind, as Tony slips his finger back and forth in between Steve’s thighs and then, just then, Tony’s fingers brush over Steve’s hole out of nowhere and Steve cries out, almost dropping the wine glass he’s rinsing, as his hands go numb and he starts shaking.
He's nervous but he's ready. He's read all of the personnel files and all the technical documents. He's memorized names, faces, ranks - he even knows who has kids on board and who has kids waiting back at home.
“Look, I appreciate your old-fashioned alpha thing going on, but you take a boy on a date this big to propose or something. You don’t start with it, because how are you gonna top this?” he mocks playfully as he stirs his spoon in the bowl of ridiculously expensive soup that Steve had insisted three times that he order before he’d agreed.
“I don’t need to charge your employer for this room though, I can afford the two weeks on my own,” Tony says, taking a couple of careful steps forward, hoping he doesn’t sound like a pretentious rich person.
Captain Rogers’ face is dark gray and as much as it looks like it, what’s pouring down from his clenched fist is not rain. It’s sugary water and a thousand pieces of shattered glass.
Steve kisses the top of Tony’s head and Tony thinks about the astonishment of sleeping in Steve’s arms. Steve, who is caring and gentle with people he hasn’t even met and hates throwing stuff away. Who can turn a line on a piece of paper, into a fully fleshed international treaty proposal in half a day and is not afraid of using big words like admiration and jealousy. Tony loves being around him. He has a way, a different way, Tony thinks, a bit old fashioned and too serious maybe sometimes, but also adorably sharp and awkwardly funny. He is brave and smart and so heartwarmingly kind, and he reminds Tony of someone but he is too tired now, and he can’t quite remember.
Tony helps Steve to the shower and washes him with heartbreakingly gentle touches as if Steve’s a delicate glass sculpture that needs to be handled with care. He asks if Steve’s feeling alright
“Move down, a bit more, excellent. Now put your feet up,” Dr. Stark instructs, and his fingers burn on the skin of Steve’s shins as he guides them onto the stirrups. “Ah, there you go, great job.” And the praise washes him all over even if he knows, at least on some deep inaccessible level, that it’s not meant the way his body is trying to take it.
They’re still here, and they might still have a chance of pulling through. Steve’s still holding on to Tony as if he’s the most important thing in the whole world, and even though the storm is still raging outside their window, he is not shaking anymore. There is still hope, even after decades of fear and sorrow, and their life may not turn out like the love songs, but they can try to fix their broken pieces, one nightmare at a time.
Tony leans back and lays his chin on his palms. “Santa Maria passengers are safe and sound, they will be at the space station in no time.”
“No, we barely have enough water for people who are not in heat. And we have little power to keep us afloat so we can’t synthesize any food. According to Starfleet Secondary Gender handbook, food and water are crucial in suddent heats to keep an omega alive before getting to a medical facility, and we are short on both.”
Tony blinks and his vision blurs for a second. It’s hard to keep up with the images, even if he tries to avert most of his attention to the way the leather of the steering wheel is being too tightly squished between Captain Rogers fingers. He can't quite fathom how ridiculously painful it must be to be the omega who is being handed back to a mate, after being bonded to someone else, most possibly against their will, and that’s without thinking about the kids that had definitely been involved, because even illegal suppressants did not exist back then. This is what they mean by ‘it could be worse’ and how it applies in every situation even to Tony right this moment, because despite, well, everything, he doesn’t have to obsess about deciding between living on the streets or being some random alpha’s temporary omega against his will.
The roaring waves crashed into the shore and the sudden wind muffled Barnes’s words and shook Tony’s hat on his head. Tony swallowed the bile and took his hat off to keep it from the wind, watching as Steve ran down the stairs and jumped into Barnes’s arms. He tried to breathe through the stabbing pain that cut his heart in half when Barnes pressed Steve to his chest and ruffled his hair, and clutched at his tightening chest when Barnes’s fingers brushed over the bite mark on Steve’s neck. A growl echoed in his head,
“This place is not as scary as I remember,” he says, and moves on to sit on the chair in the corner and browse through Steve’s design album. “All this your work? Wow, look at this magnificently creepy horned creature.”
“Do I have to say the words?” Steve says, blinking a few more times, and swallowing visibly, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down.
“I’d say my bed, but that’s a bit inappropriate,” Steve chuckles as he sets two plates stacked with pancakes on the counter, “and also a big fat lie.”
“Hey, hey why?” Tony asks, his face turning serious in a heartbeat, the way he usually gets when Steve seems to be crawling out of his skin, and Steve wants to hug him tight right now and never let him go.
. He sat on Tony’s bed and was  very gentle when he told Tony that he needs to be more respectful. That he needs to shut the fuck up, smile and never say no. That Tony was lucky to have Ty to take care of him and his company, and he should try to do better next time because Ty was all he had left after his parents' deaths.
Steve’s coming apart. He’s gasping for air, unable to get enough, and the intensity of the moment is breaking him in two. It doesn't hurt, not in the very least, it just feels like Tony’s opening his body and reaching into his soul, with each thrust, each bolt of electricity that curls Steve’s toes and sweeps through his core, all the way up to prickle his scalp. He’s present with every nerve in his body, each somehow taking in the feelings thousands of times more than they rightfully should and there is absolutely no room left for anything else in the world, the concepts that are supposed to hurt, the memories, the nightmares, the regrets.
almost drop the phone with the rush of dizzying protectiveness that washes him over with Tony’s broken sobs on the other side of the line. If he hangs up too quickly, and runs two blocks north before stopping to catch his breath and realizing, just then, that he has no idea where Tony actually lives, well, that’s nobody’s business.
Steve runs, in agony and hope, because it’s him, sliding down the steps, holding on to a blue-faced person Steve doesn’t recognize, his beard untidy and his hair mussed, eyes glossy as if empty of life. But it’s Tony, in the flesh, half the size Steve remembers, hissing in pain as he slumps into Steve’s arms, but he’s alive, breathing, saying words Steve can’t gather the mental ability to understand but is grateful to hear nevertheless. Steve has to pause in the middle of the steps, to take a deep breath and steady himself. He has Tony in his arms so he can’t shatter into pieces; he has to keep it together.
For the long seconds that follow, Tony wonders if he’d ever known how to breathe, if he’d ever managed to close his eyes to not see, or move his fingers to turn on the water and splash some sanity onto his face. He doesn’t know if there ever was a path to move on from this second into the next. If he remembers how to be; to exist.
Steve drops the tattoo gun and startles himself with the loud clunk. Or at least that’s what he blames his thundering heart on, in the fraction of the second it takes him to turn and face Tony, and thank God, and all the Irish saints, Tony has that cheeky sparkle in his eyes that Steve adores with his whole heart.
This chapter has mpreg which is not tagged for spoiler reasons. No description of pregnancy really, just the fact that Tony is pregnant. There is mention of blood and injuries and I don't think they are too graphic but definitely a little graphic. There is description of emotional abusive behavior but in the form of honeymoon phase of the abusive cycle as in Ty being nice to Tony after he has been physically abusive.
“Thank you,” Steve said, his eyes fastened to the floor before him. Tony looked down too and the holes in Steve’s shoes caught his eyes like always. Who wore shoes with holes in them when they could wear new ones? Who returned a simple gift like Italian shoes? ‘The Art of Keeping Your Omega Content’ was definitely written by an ignorant alpha who would burn in hell for the lies he'd published in a book that cost a small fortune.
feeling better, that’s for sure, because despite the rush of fear that makes his toes go numb and the hair on his neck stand on end, he’s ready for what inevitably comes when he dares to answer a question with something other than the exactly expected.
Something bubbles up in Steve’s chest and stings at his heart. “I’m not uncomfortable. I just…” He breathes in. “I’m just …” He breathes out. “Just…”
A sharp citrus scent fills Steve’s nose, Tony’s obviously, and he looks more and more distressed by the second. Steve looks between them and moves without thinking, planning vaguely to grab the alpha’s arm and break it in half right then and there, but instead of Ty Stone, Tony’s body is pressed against his. Tony is standing between them, holding Steve’s hand, his fingers burning on Steve’s forearm.
Steve’s face goes from shock to unreadable, before it softens to another perfect smile, and Tony lets out a breath he did not know he was holding.
“It’s okay. We’ve got this. If you lie down on the table for me, I’ll take care of everything.” Dr. Stark bends forward to tap on the table and his scrubs brush against Steve’s gown, close, so close that if Steve moves an inch forward, he can rub his nipples against Dr. Stark’s arm. He doesn’t move an inch forward though; he just holds still, trembling inside, and he inhales, wondering how inappropriate it will be to ask if he can smell Dr. Stark’s hair right now.
Tony shook his head and turned back to watch the sea. Long waves were washing against the shore and the clouds seemed to be getting darker. Steve might have to stay for tonight, he thought before mentally kicking himself, and he shook his head again to push the thought away.
I would fall asleep every time, even if it was just for a few hours, and I would still jerk awake, sweating and disturbed, with a pounding heart and a dry mouth, wondering if I was still in the ocean or if I was on that cursed bridge, if I was drowning again or failing one more time. But still, the only break I could get from the hell that was my life over the past 18 months, the only relief, the only breath of fresh air, was him.”
Steve’s fingers find Tony’s hair, trying not to pull or push but he is unable to control himself completely. He can’t contain the way he moans and trembles as Tony swallows him down, wondering if this is the last bit of life before he can see heaven when Tony starts to suck his cock.
Bucky shifted on the bench until his body was pressed to Steve’s side. “I’m so sorry, Stevie, you went through so many awful things and it’s all on me,” he sighed and shook his head. “I would’ve been here from the first day, but I never got your letter from before your departure or the telegram that announced your arrival, as I had already moved to Sydney. It was so foolish of me, not to write back home
Getting to Rhodey has been a constant part of his plan so much that coming up with an alternative in which Rhodey’s away on tour, and unreachable for three months is just impossible. With Pepper working for SI and being probably interrogated by security right this second Tony's left with no options, legal or illegal, and with no money and no one else to turn to, he has no clue, whatsoever of what he should do.
“Your fella’s home, Stevie, so ’m gonna get going,” Bucky said as he turned on his heels to walk out.
“Well, let me tell you this, you are missing out big time and you should absolutely get bonded. This is definitely something you want.” Ty turns his head to Tony as he gently turns his head toward himself. He looks into Tony’s eyes and his gaze and smile are so familiar and so safe.
Steve tries to look away. He wants to be polite and not stare, he wants to at least take a sip from the drink the guy bought him but he just can’t. He looks at the guy and his dark fluffy hair and wonders if that third drink has actually got to him because he seems to have a hard time keeping his hands to himself. He suddenly has this urge to touch this man; those eyes, that hair, and the perfect mesmerizing whole-face smile.
“Steve,” Tony says, surprised that he still has a voice, and he tries to go on, wishing to be as verbose as he usually is, to chatter away and make Steve smile, but that Tony seems so far away and so does that Steve; so does their little bubble of joy that’s been surrounding this quarantine room for the past days.
“No, but you were always a jerk back, with a grand comeback, and we would end up in… you know… the closet. That night though, it was a whole other kind of rage. It wasn’t funny or a turn on, I wanted to fucking kill the guy. He was touching you, and you were smiling at him and you said you’d call him and I lost it.”
He leaves the plates on any and all empty, flat surfaces he can find, between all the notes and gadgets and things he doesn’t recognize. He pauses behind the bathroom door and his hand hovers on the doorknob. The image of Tony’s naked body sparkling with drops of water burns through his skin and a now-familiar heat swirls low in his body. The desire that’s been buzzing in the back of his mind since last night takes over him all of a sudden and he almost knocks, almost turns that knob, almost walks in.
Thank you for reading and I hope it was worth the wait 💓 please let me know what you think, kudos and comments are highly appreciated!
“Your nose is not broken. The swelling and black eyes should subside in a few days.” Bruce’s tone is neutral and calm so Tony tries to focus on the facts
It’s almost midnight. Tony’s been tossing and turning for an hour in the bed he shared with Steve last night. Gorgeous, virgin and blushing at first touch Steve, who’s sleeping in the next room and all Tony can think about is the way he touched Tony, shy but certain. He welcomes the dizzying thoughts over the creeping anxiety of the hell that he will need to deal with in the coming days, for SI, for the greater community, and for the whole world, probably. He’s contemplating jerking off, to let off some steam and hopefully go to sleep for a few hours, when he hears the sounds. He mostly feels them, as if with his heart and not his ears as if he’s imagining something that does not exist, but he sure as hell knows that it does.
Tony takes another step back and then another until his back hits the wall. A couple of people from HR pass by and one of the girls takes a look at both of them but they’re probably too drunk themselves to notice anything.
Steve snaps his mouth closed - it always falls open when Tony starts to talk - and looks back at Ms. Romanoff. “How much time do we have?”
, his heart racing in his chest and his breath hitched and short while his mind falls into that painless place he has finally come to found, which is easy and quiet. He listens to Iron Man as he keeps on talking breathlessly, how he has daydreamed about this, having Captain America under him, exposed and vulnerable like this, and Steve wonders if Captain America has enjoyed anything more in his life than this, lying on the dusty sidewalk of a dark empty alley, this vulnerable and this exposed.
Steve wants to look away, but he doesn’t seem to be able to. Dr. Stark’s eyes are a unique color, a golden brown, like chocolate, or dark honey maybe, and Steve doesn’t expect it, the way they’re holding him in place, warming him up and calming him down.
He thought about Tony’s breath against his skin and his hands, wrapped around Steve’s waist, holding him close, keeping him from drifting away with the wind. Being enchanted by the touch, the sharp burst of pleasure that ran through his body and took his breath away, and left his head spinning and his core aching with want he did not know existed.
Nat huffs and Clint shakes his head. “Guys, we need to get our shit together, before Fury gets here.”
Countless, his brain provides dutifully and his eyes start to prickle. He’d broken his own heart as many times - and his forearm, once, but that one was entirely his own fault, blurting out the name of an underground omega rights group, and being too unsteady to fall on his hands with just a little push from behind. The shit storm that had followed through weeks of torment and pain, or what he thought was a shit storm at the time, but was just playful banter compared to… well, all of this.
Steve swipes away the holograms and rubs a hand over his eyes. “You want to get off the ship at the next space station? Why?”
the heavenly breeze in Steve’s blistering hell, for real, and nothing about this ‘hook up’ situation is random. This is just how it’s meant to be, as fucking cliche as it might sound, that Steve had to wait all these years, mostly unconscious and frozen, to get here and find his one.
Steve can hear the sound of latex gloves being peeled off Dr. Stark’s hands and thrown in the bin, and his brain fixates on the price of each pair for a second, that he will have to pay out of pocket because there is no chance in hell that he will use his employer-provided insurance for this hospital visit.
“I’m honored that you feel that way, Steve. I truly am. I’m just hoping-- just let me show my absolute gratitude for how crazy hot it was for me, too.”
“And you knew you were on this job, for what, two minutes before launch? That’s impressive! And it’s not a part of the job Steve, it’s what I call going above and beyond.” Tony lowers his hands and clasps them together on the table.
Steve holds onto Tony’s shoulder and watches the wave in his hair with every slow move, his mind spiraling in countless spins, away from Tony and back to him, over and over and over again.
to propose he could take any of the rooms, including the one they slept in last night. He'd vaguely hoped that Steve would suggest they can sleep in the same room but sadly, he doesn’t. It would be crazy anyway and Tony distracts himself with another hour of useless yelling at the board, to discuss the inevitable financial crisis on the horizon, hoping he could reprogram board members to his liking using the BARF technology, one day.
Right now however, he’s none of that. The bunch of sharp shattered pieces he has in his chest are not capable of melting, and his fingers will be in no condition to even sketch a phone antenna because Ty knows exactly where to hit so it would hurt for so long on so many fucked-up, stupid levels.
He can’t tell how, or when, but the next thing he knows is that he’s straddling Ty, who’s struggling underneath him with no success, and he’s punching that smug face, left, right, left and right again. Voices call him from afar and hands pull at him but he can’t bring himself to care. The only thing he cares about is the pain creeping back into Tony’s eyes, right when he seemed to have kicked its damn shadow, and the fact that this guy, the big alpha whose only strength is his ability to abuse an omega’s love and trust, is the source of that pain from the get fucking go.
On the shuttle taking him to San Francisco Fleet Yards, Steve sits on the last seat of the front row with his side pressed to the cold metallic wall. He places his backpack between his feet on the floor, even if the whole row remains unoccupied. It’s been more than five years but Steve doesn't seem to be getting used to having enough space on vehicles.
Steve wants to push that ‘playing-dumb’ face to his chest. Or at least go over and kiss the top of his head and feed him another bagel. He can’t do any of those, obviously, so he spreads peanut butter on another three pieces of bread and goes with raspberry jam this time. “Two. and only because I shoved them in your face at four PM. I can’t believe you can eat so little food and do so much. I just don’t get how your body works.”
“I don’t know, Iron Man, I think I kinda liked doing it in a back alley?” Steve envelopes Tony in his arms and breathes in the coconut scent of his shower damp hair.
“I’m not surprised that they knew who you’re staying with from day one,” Tony sighs, running a hand through his hair, making them more adorably tousled, “they didn’t mind leaving you on your own, for 18 months, but they would never leave their precious asset to stay with a random guy. Classic SHIELD.”
but sharp needles are pricking his heart suddenly. “I’d say you get to do both then,” and he ruffles Steve’s hair, brushing his forearm to the side of his face and Steve turns and pecks a quick kiss on Tony’s hand before turning back to watch the stripping wheel spin on the TV.
“What was the best sex you ever had?” Steve reads Tony’s truth question, sounding a little shaky still, and Tony hesitates for a second. Not that he doesn’t know the answer, because he does, and it’s more clear than Steve’s anxious anticipation with the way he is chewing on his bottom lip and rubbing the back of his neck. It’s the realization of the answer that is taking Tony by surprise, the clarity itself, how there is no beat, no doubt, no internal debates. How it’s completely obvious.
This is an ending to something Steve can’t name; the beginning of something Steve can’t even imagine. Like a blank sheet of paper, and the most exquisite idea, blending together to create an eternal masterpiece, the gratifying flood that takes away years worth of debris and wreckage and leaves Steve behind in Tony’s arm, as they become one, the tears that tangle with smiles, as Tony leans in and brings their lips together. Colors explode into rainbows and the words turn into songs as they pant and shake together as they come, holding on to each other so tight, that nothing could break them apart.
“Wait until I step on all your toes,” Steve tries casually, as he follows Tony’s gentle tug, and Tony laughs with his whole face, the candlelight sparkling in his eyes.
Steve thought about the bite mark the most. He would touch it to feel the tingle that ran through his spine every chance he got. Every time he had felt desperate to touch Tony in the past months, every single night he spent in this bed listening to Tony’s breaths, and wondering what his life would be like if Tony loved him back at least a little bit.
Tony asks before taking off Steve’s boxers. He waits patiently for Steve to say the word, and asks and waits again before Steve tells him that he can touch his cock. In the long seconds between the confirmation leaving Steve’s lips and Tony’s hand finally touching him, and in the feverish haze that’s clouding his brain, Steve thinks about how this is nothing like he had imagined his first time to be. That this, here, naked and lost in Tony’s body and his scent and his touch, is something he has never even dared to dream about. He trembles and whines as Tony’s fingers wrap around his cock and doesn’t even try to stop the stream of nonsense that is coming out of his mouth. He reaches over and pushes Tony’s briefs down, enough to get his hand on Tony’s cock, vaguely aware that he should probably ask first but he just can’t. He runs his fingers on the head and smears Tony’s precum over the head and the length. Tony moans, long and low and a fresh rush of arousal goes through Steve’s body. He presses himself into Tony, squirming as Tony’s fingers move on him, mirroring his rhythm without realizing.
Steve blinks again before the flash of lightning illuminates his features, and the way he trembles with the thunder tightens Tony’s chest. Or his words, the pieces of a dark puzzle slotting into place, the understanding that’s starting to settle in, yet bringing along more confusion.
And he smiles, light and bright, different from what Tony has seen so far. Tony smiles back and his heart grows at least half a size.
“I won’t lock anyone anywhere, and everyone’s going to the party tonight.” Steve looks around the room at Clint and Bruce who are finally here and takes his time chewing and swallowing the rest of his donut. “Except for Stark,” he says and walks toward Tony’s desk watching him carefully so he won't miss a single move in Tony’s face as Steve’s words set in. “
Tony’s efforts to stay still finally fail when Steve nibbles at his stomach. He blinks at the sight of Steve going down on his knees, between Tony’s legs, and he opens and closes his mouth in hopes for some meaningful words which obviously don’t exist.
The IV bag is almost empty now. He looks at Nat holding the ice bag instead of Tony’s hand and then back at Captain Rogers who is fiddling with the glass of water as if he is waiting for Bruce’s next gesture to make Tony drink some more of the sickening sweetness.
Ty’s eyes pop out, figuratively, and he finally lets go of Tony’s hand. “You’ve got to be kidding me.” He looks at Tony, then at Steve, and his hands dart to his pockets, searching for something from the outside, and well, Steve doesn’t have to be a genius to work out the reason for his sudden frustration.
“Yeah, yeah, I believe you.” And he turns to the screen to watch the stripping wheel spin but he is grinning wide and his voice is ringing with something that settles in Tony’s body like an unexpected rain on a New York summer afternoon.
Steve pulls the covers over them and tucks Tony in. “I don’t want anything to happen to your heart.” He brushes his lips over Tony’s hair, pressing him in, as he closes his eyes. “I love you,” he whispers, before falling into a dreamless, deep sleep.
“Blueberries.” He sounds wrong and ragged, and considering the situation, this is an insanely ridiculous first thing to say to a bunch of new people who are worried for him, for no apparent reason, but someone is making cookies and he gets to choose blueberries. He can’t really smile but he can feel something warm running under his skin and he is not shivering anymore.
It’s ridiculous. There is no way that Steve would understand what Tony is asking permission for. Tony barely knows himself and there is no chance in hell he can word what’s in his mind right now, maybe not ever. As it turns out, though, Steve seems to actually understand. Amazing, beautiful Steve that leaves snacks around Tony’s room and makes him look much better than what he actually does in that perfect little drawing; the guy who can move all seven boxes of Tony’s things into the penthouse by himself but turns into a mass of flushed warmth under Tony’s hands in a heartbeat. He understands and nods, his cheek moving against Tony’s in the most soothing way and holy fucking mother of fuck; he bends down a little and parts his legs.
“You didn’t have to mess with the mission,” Steve says, out of breath, as he starts to move, “just for this.”
For a few seconds, Steve feels like he is floating in unknown territory. His brain is not processing at full speed and he is not sure if he is understanding properly. Is he actually supposed to continue washing the dishes while Tony’s hands are on him? He takes another deep breath and looks at Tony’s hands, resting on his abs. It’s a game, he tells himself, a little challenge that Steve would not back down from. It’s also something Tony wants and that makes everything else far less important. Tony never wants anything, not for himself anyway, and the idea of giving something to Tony that he has actually asked for makes Steve’s head spin a little. He lets go of the edge of the sink to take a plate out of the sink and he is grateful for Tony’s arms around him because he doesn’t think he can stand steady anymore.
He can’t sit here and do nothing, even if it hurts like hell to get out of the bed. He has to find Tony, no matter what, even if walking through the hospital corridors with bare feet proves to be a tedious task, even if he ends up stopping several times and holding on to the railing on the wall to keep from tripping. He has to find Tony.
He looks at his hand and brings it down slower than he’s expected as if he’s in a movie that’s gone suddenly in slow motion mode. “I can’t stand back when you look distressed like that, Tony, I—”
“Fine, Othello, no need to punch anyone dead. Told you he is dead already. It’s the guy who’s strong and brave, here to save the American way.” Tony yawns and curls his feet around Steve’s. “It’s Captain America,” he whispers, before he drifts off into a dreamless, deep sleep.
And he doesn’t fall apart, as Nat goes through the pictures of the lost ones, when tears fill Tony’s eyes seeing Peter’s face among the rest. He doesn’t lose his composure when Tony reminds him that he
He closes his eyes, as Tony’s fingers brush over his neck and caress his cheeks, tilting his head, just a little, and his lips are on Tony’s. Tony kisses him, his tongue touching Steve's lips and Steve opens up and lets him in, losing himself in the sensation. Tony's feet curl around Steve's as they taste each other and Steve's hand laces into Tony's hair. He can’t quite believe it, but he has
He’s just finished shaving for the first time in two years when the ground under his feet starts to shake. He throws the towel right next to the hamper as the whole compound is rocking in place and he runs, or flies, or does both somehow, the distance to the front door stretching before him to infinity. His jaw falls open at the sight of a spaceship landing right outside the main building and he can’t believe his own eyes as the doors open.
“It’s too late, babe. He might be asleep by the time you come back. I might have a few things lying around here somewhere … but I don’t imagine Tony fancies wearing my floral summer dress.” And she smiles again.
“Have her contact my assistant, Ms. Pepper Potts at Stark Industries. She’s already made an arrangement with the hotel to deliver things to the door in compliance with self-isolation rules.”
Everyone on the bridge is now looking at them. How do you say ‘because you’re an omega’, without saying the words?
Chief staff meetings, however, are a whole different story. Tony shows up to all of them like clockwork and Steve’s efforts to sit in the furthest spot from him doesn't do much to help. He goes through bottles of iced water and still burns all over like he’s been set on fire from the inside. He has to pinch himself under the table to stay focused on what anyone says, and if it weren’t for memos and meeting reports, and brilliant communication officers, Steve would have no idea what any of his staff in the meetings had said. When it’s Tony’s turn to talk though, the whole universe disappears and angels start to sing. Steve sweats and shivers at the same time, going back and forth from the need to walk through the room and kiss Tony’s hair to the urge to run out of the bridge and jump out of the starship into the endless space.
Tony leans forward to kiss Steve’s hair and Steve reaches up to wrap his hands around him. “Iron Man made Mark I in a cave, a fucking cave, held captive at gunpoint. All the brilliance? It’s inside him. It’s his hard work, and never-ending efforts, and his amazing good heart that makes him special. Your guy though-” Steve takes a deep breath “-everything special about your guy, came from a bottle.” And he waits for the creeping shadow of pain, but Tony is hugging his shoulders and the heartache doesn't seem to want to rush back.
Ty is talking about art. He has actually been talking about the artwork in the living room for the past 30 minutes, showcasing the
Steve’s the greatest guy in the world, of course, who supposedly loves Tony and Tony knows, in theory, that Steve will be understanding if Tony makes a mess and gracious enough to hold back his angry strokes even if Tony’s whining happens to ruin everything.
It’s just too much, and it makes all his thoughts come to a halt, so he trembles and bites back a moan, even more of his blood leaving his brain to rush south, and he has to lean back against the examination table to keep from falling, his hands finally ripping the paper-thin gown on both sides.
Omegas in Tony’s situation can disappear one day, Tony thinks, like ‘OneMatchExplosion’ from the forum, who never updated his status after that last message, ‘I’m terrified for my safety’. They can also end up in prison with a life sentence, like ‘kissed_by_a_fist’, when her efforts to stop her alpha from hurting her had gone horribly wrong.
“Yes, I’m sure,” the alpha says, tentatively, as if he can’t believe that Steve’s asking the question.
He is joking, right? What if he is not joking? Shit, what if Tony has actually offended him? It’s not like he can pack up and go-- wait-- he actually can pack up and--
like that time in Malibu police station. His fingers still go cold at the thought, his spine prickling in terror, but he can count the small apple pie prints on the mug to calm his nerves and drink a little more of the hot chocolate to warm up his shuddering inside, because he can’t fall apart.
Going through the empty rooms of Building 3 after that, he went to his old room and sat on the edge of the bed. It had been a while since a ship with third-class passengers had arrived at the port so the building had been empty. Part of him was grateful beyond measure that he wasn't still stuck in these rooms, like during the long months after the end of his 40-day quarantine, before he met Tony behind Building 1. The other part, however, couldn’t help but wonder if it would’ve been easier to stay here, waiting for his eventual deportation followed by catching the flu on the return voyage. Would it have been less torturous to make it to Ireland only to end up with no food and money in the middle of a civil war and no family or friend to help him out? Would counting the days until his probable death make his heart clench this painfully or make breathing this damn hard?
Tony might have used up his mortification allowance for one day, or one lifetime, but he is grateful that he can still feel the warmth that starts from his cheek and spreads over his face, onto his chest and all the way to his toes.
He would not need a nose surgery which is actually good news. A silver lining, some light in the darkest hour of the night.
“You’ll let me do the dishes, ha?” Steve frowns, and Tony’s heart drops like a stone. “So is it some sort of an honor to be allowed to wash your dishes?”
sounds beautifully different coming out of those slightly parched lips, even before all the nice words sink in. “Thank you, Commander, that’s really nice to hear.”
Tony’s touch is soft on Steve’s skin. His words are gentle in Steve’s ears. His mercy, however, hurts more than his disappointment. His tenderness cuts through Steve’s wounds, precise like a sharp blade, and Steve’s bleeding all over himself in tears and useless explanations. That he never meant to hurt Tony. That he never meant to leave Tony behind. That he meant to call, to come back, to keep Tony in his arms and never let go. That he’s made a mistake, a million of them back to back, and he is a failure who doesn’t deserve Tony’s forgiveness, even if it’s the only thing in the world left for him to fight for.
“I haven't had any health issues since the new meds, which is six years now.” Federations medicine works wonders and since they’ve been rehomed to New Earth no one Steve knows has died from simple things that killed people all the time back in New Brooklyn. No one goes hungry. No one suffocates without oxygen. Life is different; Steve’s grateful. What’s fixable is now fixed. The twenty-five-year-long star storm that had isolated New Brooklyn was no one’s fault. Steve’s Ma dying from an epidemic with no medical help is part of the past.
grabing the drawing, Steve doesn't try to clean up the charcoal and the color pencil dust from his face and hands. What feels right, might end up being the right thing to do. It might also not end up that way, but Steve will never know if he doesn’t walk this path.
“There was something on the wall that I’d never seen in a hospital room, and for a second I wondered if I’d died but ended up in a hospital in heaven. It was too thin and too vivid to be a television, and too small for a movie screen, but it got me hooked, instantly. I was mesmerized by the slick lines and shining colors of a flying suit of armor.  I got so fascinated with the smooth glide of it through the New York Skyline that I almost didn’t notice the Empire State Building being surrounded by skyscrapers.”
Please let me know what you think, in any shape way or form, your nice words make me keep going with this one, as it gets harder and harder to tie things together as I am going forward.
Steve cries out loud as he comes in Tony’s hand. Tony comes right after as they both go limp and loose, Steve collapsing onto the wall and Tony onto Steve. Tony holds on to Steve with both hands, and Steve holds onto Tony’s hands with both of his. They stay like that until they start to get cold, so Tony turns the water back on before laying his head on Steve’s back again. He is vaguely aware that he is supposed to move and be responsible, like every other second of his life, but right now, he is holding Steve, and Steve is holding him and someone is saying something low and sweet. It might be Tony who’s chanting Steve’s name, or Steve saying Tony’s. Or both, perhaps, low and sweet, and together.
“Well, I’d have to deal with that erection if it had not gone down. You basically did a part of my job for me. So thank you for that.”
Tony nods anyway and manages to put up a smile, or what he hopes looks like one because Steve’s obviously struggling and he doesn’t deserve to be left hanging like this. He deserves the world as far as Tony’s concerned and it’s not like Tony doesn’t want to say something positive or be more optimistic; it’s just that he can’t. He absolutely can’t.
He locks himself in his room to video chat with Nat, and he replies to all of Fury’s emails that have been left unread in his inbox forever. He talks to Clint, checks up on Sam, and even finishes four overdue mission reports, but the time seems to be stretching and it just does not pass.
Steve opens his mouth to say something, but he seems to have lost that ability in full, so he closes his mouth, shakes Tony’s hand again, and smiles even wider than before.
We are discussing COVID-19 pandemic, as usual, without mentioning the name, so if you don't want to be exposed to that topic, please take care of yourself and don't read this one.
“I was at the uni until 10 PM, helping a few of the students I’m TA’ing because they have their physics finals tomorrow, and he moved out after a week of none-stop yelling, like
Steve eats his pasta and nods a lot, wondering if it would be totally inappropriate to feed Tony some of the pasta he has not touched at all. He nods some more, in absence of any clear ideas that would form into words, and then stands up to clear his plate and go to bed, as soon as the clock hits 7 PM.
We are still discussing the pandemic of the COVID-19 (still not mentioned the name) so please take care of yourself and don't read this fic if you don't want to be exposed to it.
Tony shakes his head. “Yeah? If you’re this savvy on secondary gender science, you probably know I will start melting in a span of hours.”
“But it depends on this guy. As long as he doesn’t lock me up in the supplies closet because he’s unhappy with something I’ve done in my lifetime.”
But nothing about this peak of human perfection has been like anything Tony has ever experienced. He is something else altogether, from his eyes to his lips, and that perfect hair magically staying in place, even when he is having a nightmare. Or his words, the semi-socialist beliefs, feeling uncomfortable if someone spends too much money on him in times of crisis. And above all, the way he makes Tony feel when he kisses Tony’s lips or runs his hands through Tony’s hair or sucks his dick, for that matter.
“I think you’re in heat,” Steve blurts out and the intensity of the statement makes him panic a bit.
, as soon as he stepped into Tony’s workshop. It was a different kind of satisfaction to watch Bucky’s eyes go wide when Tony would ramble on about the latest development in jets, or have him listen with a half-open mouth, when Tony had recited his TED talk on how transistors had revolutionized, well, everything. The way his whole face had lit up when Tony showed him the vintage blueprints of SI flying cars and squealed in pure excitement when Tony reassured him that the schematics were for the cars on display at the 1945 Stark Expo. How his cheeks had colored the very last time he was in the workshop, as Tony was working on fixing a quirk of Bucky’s elbow. How he had smiled and ducked his head at the slightest touch of Tony’s fingers on the scars of his shoulder.
Tony slams the door shut and Steve snaps out of what feels like a magnetic field, finally able to stop staring at the now wide shut door.
This was not that moment though; there would never be such a moment. Tony knew better than to open his foolish mouth. He pressed his lips together instead, squeezed his eyes, and listened to the rush of blood that roared in his ears and pounded in his head. He was filled with a desperate desire for the delicate omega pretending to be asleep in his undergarments just a foot away, and all he wanted in this world was to hold that fragile frame in his arms, to kiss his hair and touch his lips, to put some ointment on the skin of those frail fingers that were always cracked from working in cold water. All he wanted to do was to rest his head on that pale chest and listen to the weak beating of the strongest heart that he had ever known.
Steve pulls the covers over them and tucks Tony in. “Well, tell me, already! Dead or alive, who do I need to actually be jealous of?”
Steve might never get the chance to tell Tony how perfect he is. What if he actually believes that Steve thinks he’s dumber than his AIs? God, what if he thinks that Steve really thinks he’s sloppy and outrageous, or useless for that matter? While what he actually meant to say, through each of those stupid fights what the exact opposite, while it was just a game that was supposed to be over way back, but it just kept going, because Steve was a coward who couldn’t come to terms with having fallen for the most perfect omega in the world.
, babe I love you. I can't thank you enough for all your support and encouragement and the late-night beta, which I really and truly appreciate. <3<3
Steve has never had before, even when he was playing with the plug before all of this happened. He’s never been this open, this stretched, and it’s mind-blowing, the roaring of blood in his ears as his hole squeezes Dr. Stark’s fingers, his breath trapped in his chest, and the way he arches his back, the words that slip out of their own accord, as he covers his mouth with one hand, meaningless and muffled and so very loud.
Mornings are spent on bringing some order back to the city: clearing the abandoned cars from the roads, organizing volunteers for hospitals, planning for security measures, and dealing with unaccompanied children wandering around in every unexpected corner. In the afternoons, Steve just walks in the streets. He goes from one street to another and listens to people. Some cry on his shoulders. Some yell. Some even throw a punch at him, which he takes without a blink. He needs to be there for the people he has let down so fucking spectacularly— not that he can undo any of the harm, not that it makes him feel better the slightest bit, but he’s at least doing what needs to be done; he is at least doing something.
Back in his room and surrounded by sketchpads, drawing pencils and his new charcoal set, that Nat had not forgotten to get from his apartment, Steve loses himself in countless sketches of those amazing curves and sharp lines, coming beautifully together in what represents so much more than aesthetic beauty.
Being cheeky is a good look on Tony and Steve makes a mental note; Tony can turn anything into a charity opportunity.
“Dance with me?” Tony says as he turns to face Steve and everything feels surreal suddenly. Steve steps toward Tony, the floor not solid under his feet, and it feels like a dream,
"Hey, hey, nothing to be sorry about. I'm glad I heard you." His fingers trail up Steve’s spine, resting on his nape, making Steve’s breath hitch along the way.
“So your employer wants to move you? I’m not sure if that complies with the rapidly evolving strictness of the self-isolation guidelines.”
am the poor assistant who has to be here prying clothes out of his iron fists, because he thinks it’s okay to wear a tan suit and a light green shirt to the Columbia Children’s Hospital Christmas Gala.”
If Tony was still 18, his heart would melt into a stinky puddle of pink goo with the way Captain Rogers's gaze is so impossibly soft. If he was the same glorious romantic who used to listen to love songs while sketching StarkPhone I design drafts, he would believe, in a heartbeat, that this stranger guy with that hair and that honey coated voice is telling the truth. He would lay his head on the alpha’s knees, and cry until he would fall asleep. If he was still that Tony, he would bask in the protectiveness that’s making the air in the car too thick to easily breathe in.
The air in the room stills and becomes heavy for a second. Steve waits, holding his breath, his nails digging into his palms, waiting for a chuckle or a grin, a few condescending words at least, but none of those happens.
Not that Steve would have cared, even if Tony had explained it to him word for word. Not that he cares now, knowing that punching Ty might have been the last strike, indeed, if it meant that he would get to protect the person that means the most to him in the world - whom he’s already failed to protect so miserably.
“No need to do that.” Dr. Stark puts the tablet away and comes to Steve’s side. “It’s all done and dusted. You can’t even imagine some of the things I’ve had to deal with since I started working in this ED. This was nothing, I promise you, I won’t even remember it tomorrow.”
All he gets right now is a choice; a decision to either live on the streets or be this random alpha’s temporary omega.
It’s not Steve who pushes two fingers inside Tony’s slicked hole, moaning around Tony’s flushed cock, it’s not him who slides his cock into Tony's warm and inviting body, fucking him so hard that Tony stops babbling and comes untouched, absolutely quiet.
Like he can move an inch from here, Tony thinks, as the scent and the colors and the deep gentle voice fade. Like he’s got an ounce of power left to lift a finger, even if he tries his best. He’s just empty, like a wrinkled deflated balloon, a void, a small piece of nothing wrapped in a small battered shell.
Tony wants to do things to Steve. He wants to sneak Steve into his office and keep him there, holding Steve's fingers as he talks to complete strangers. It’s exactly what he wants to do, Steve thinks through a sudden hazy fog that comes down his brain, and he has to take a deep breath and lean into Tony a little more than he wants to, to keep from flailing. Tony wants to give Steve what he wants exactly and it’s so close, it’s right before Steve’s eyes, he just has to hold out his hand and grab it.
is a board game that is apparently very fun and is rather new which Tony doesn't know of, hence he calls it quirks of quenching, quenching being an engineering term!
The guy with glasses, Bruce, unfastens what is actually the cuff of a blood pressure monitor and rolls Tony’s sleeve down. Tony looks at him, then at the bloody sleeve of his shirt and realizes that he is not wearing his jacket anymore. He is suddenly aware of the fact that he is too dusty and too bloody to be lying on a nice clean bed and a lump starts to build in his throat.
Thank you to all of you beautiful people who are reading this, I appreciate your support and I really hope this brings a smile to your lips in this hard period we are all going through. I totally have that in mind when I am writing this, and I don't mind making our boys a little bit too gooey and hopeful, because that's what this fic is about, a happy, warm place to forget about all the non-hopeful and non-gooey that is going on out there :)
Tony should be offended right now. He should think that Steve’s trying to mock his lifestyle and suggests he is extravagant, and that should throw Tony off the rails and make him start talking about the obscene amount of money he donates every year, and even touch on the non-monetary good things that he does. On the contrary, though, he feels intrigued. The guy has a point and he seems to be genuinely interested in doing the right thing, rather than teaching Tony a lesson.
Tony’s fingers move around Steve’s cock and he tightens his feet around Steve’s ankles. Steve’s fingers move on Tony and he pulls him further in until there is no distance between them and their lips meet into a kiss unexpected and electrifying.
and it took all of his non-instinctive willpower to stop the howling alpha inside from punching Barnes or breaking his neck.
Tony looks at himself in the mirror again. He runs a hand over his slicked hair, straightens the tie pin, and lets go of the edge of the dresser.
Steve ends up being the one staying at his desk until it’s dark outside, of course, as Tony’s new set of results, handed in a couple of hours before the end of the day, requires Steve’s report to be completely reorganized.
“Coming to the party tonight, Tony?” Nat asks as she hands Steve his take away coffee and Friday special donuts.
“I’m happy to stay, Mr. Stark,” Barnes said, and coughed again demonstratively, “if you take on the responsibility of unloading your omega’s belongings from the carriage and back into the house.”
Or to think about other things too, and keep somewhat focused, especially when he’s putting permanent ink under the skin of his patrons, and he’s fully calm and collected when an unfamiliar number starts to blink on his phone at 11 PM, right after Steve had closed the shop for the night. His hands are
“Steve, lay back, oh God,” someone says, and hands press on his stomach. There is no pain or even the slightest sting, it’s just suddenly cold, and the world’s spinning around Steve. The guys show up in Steve’s line of sight and disappear and Nat keeps touching his forehead and saying words that turn into jumbled noises in Steve’s brain. Something cold and wet is soaking the front of his hospital gown and it’s not like he can’t tell that he’s bleeding quickly; it’s just that he doesn’t care.
Tony swallows, blinks, and pushes both of his hands in his pockets because he’s now standing in front of Steve and he doesn’t want to ‘accidentally’ touch Steve’s breathtaking biceps.
“Look at all these swirly curls! Why would you hide this adorable mess?” Nat chuckles as she finally finishes brushing Tony’s hair. He could’ve done it himself, most probably, but it’s not a common occurrence for Tony to have someone brush his hair. It’s nice to be indulged like this, despite the constant swirl of shame in his belly, to have the luxury of a tender touch without an agenda. “No hair products on the list, sorry.” She puts the brush back on the dresser and turns back to Tony. “You have to leave these pretty things out to the public eye for a little while,” she says and covers Tony with a white blanket before curling up next to him on the couch.
And he belongs between Steve’s arms, he just fits across Steve’s chest. Steve doesn’t know how he has survived without Tony these past years—he doesn’t want to know if he can put a foot in front of the other without Tony from now on. He tightens his hold around Tony’s too narrow shoulders and breathes him in, kissing his lips, his hair, his neck, the discolored patch of skin where the arc reactor used to be, thrilled that it still makes Tony’s breath hitch and his eyes flutter shut. He wants more, much more, but Tony is too weak, even for sitting upright.
What he remembered was Tony’s low voice and his soothing words. His eyes on Steve’s face during the officiation, his thumb caressing the back of Steve’s hand, and his scent, distracting Steve from the whole world, wrapping him like a warm woolen throw, shielding him from all the nasty rules that were the reason for them gathering in that room in the first place.
Tony’s heart pounds painfully, his body numb but on fire, and his mind is running a mile a minute but still not getting there. There is an idea right at the back of his mind, a miracle, a tragedy, or both, and it’s right there, just out of reach and Tony can’t get the hang of it; not just yet. “Steve, honey, you’re not going to lose me. I’m right here,
“Can’t we up the speed a notch to catch up? I thought we had the most capable engines in the Federation on Avenger.” Commander Barton drags his elbows off his console. “If we can’t reach them, no other ship can either. They are out of luck.”
It’s just that charity talk and business ideas are not among the safe topics to be spoken about in these get-togethers.
Maybe they can get a puppy together? Steve’s definitely a dog person, and no one can stop Tony from bringing a pet into his own tower. Steve wouldn’t go with buying one though, Tony can hear the argument about breeding crimes like it’s happening before him, so maybe a big dog from a shelter? They can do whatever Steve wants to do. They can buy a dog hotel and adopt the whole shelter.
Life can sometimes be nice for a change, somewhat nice at least, because even if there is a problem regarding an erection, Steve's not the person who had to say it out loud. He gives a quick nod in response though, to avoid any confusion that might lead to more questions.
War superhero? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Rhodey is obviously a war hero but last time Tony checked he was not on speaking terms with the president, at all.
“You’re so funny haha,” she mocks and then laughs for real, and Tony’s heart drops, with the usual rush of panic that runs through his body, everytime an alpha is disrespected - which seems to happen a lot around here. Captain Rogers is still laughing though, as he turns back to smile at Tony, and their soft scents mixed together eases Tony’s nerves a little.
Steve’s face goes serious and he stops smiling, a blink and you’ll miss it kind of situation, and he is smiling again in the next fraction of a second, brighter than before. “Strip friends indeed, then.”
It might be the way Steve puts these things together, with repetitive questions that quiz the same concept from different angles. Or the fact that he doesn’t seem disappointed, ever, even when Tony blurts out ‘no way’ at the mention of pain play, or that he doesn’t mock Tony, at all, even if his breath hitches when a magnificent thin leather collar, that can easily pass as a fashionable choker, shows up on the screen.
The guy Steve’s still dreaming about kissing and doing other things with, had to clean the filthy mess between his legs before covering him with a blanket, while he was out because he had an orgasm during a medical procedure.
The sun glitters over Tony’s skin and his eyes soften. He holds out his hand and Steve finds himself out of the bed and in Tony’s arm in a split second. Tony wraps the stretched arm around Steve’s back to pull him in, and the smell of his hair calms Steve immediately. “We would’ve survived,” he whispers into Steve’s throat, sending shudders down Steve’s spine. “We will survive. Together.”
“He’s gonna die right? He’s not gonna make it. Why would he even listen to me for fuck’s sake, why wouldn’t he just be his stupid rebel ass and send in that drone he used to kick the slime monster’s that time?”
Pain explodes in Steve’s veins and the anger of the insult blends perfectly with the pleasure of holding Tony’s delicate body in his arms, so open and vulnerable just for Steve. It’s just too much, too overwhelming, and Steve has to suck on Tony’s gland again to keep himself quiet, so he won’t accidentally inform the whole building of what’s happening inside this small space.
The twenty-third day is different; there is this tingle in Steve’s spine when he wakes up. He feels giddy somehow as if it hasn’t been less than a month since half of the universe got wiped out of existence. As if he is not mourning his teammates and friends, as if the visions of Tony turning into dust somewhere unknown in outer space don’t make his blood freeze every time he closes his eyes.
Tony shows Steve how to touch step and triple step with ‘It’s Been a Long Long Time’, while kissing him once and twice then once again, and explains how you can west coast swing to any pop music, like ‘Underwater’ mixing and matching the steps Steve had just learned. Steve’s brain stumbles over the words of the song, hooked on how the love Tony breathes is all Steve needs to become invincible, as silly as it might sound, how he can even breathe underwater if he can keep Tony’s lips on his for as long as possible. They slow down with ‘The Way I Am’, Tony letting go of Steve’s body a couple of times to pull him back right after. He sings some of the words, ‘cause I love the way you say good morning’, and ‘I love you more than I could ever promise’, and it shouldn’t be possible to be nearly flawless, but Tony apparently is, because even his singing voice is absolutely perfect.
the first time that anyone has appreciated the scars on Tony's chest, ever. There must be something seriously wrong with Steve though, to appreciate something weird like that. It’s a good flaw; Tony notes, ‘he likes imperfections’.
Obie understands. He always has, since the very first time Tony was  admitted to UCLA Hospital with a concussion because
“You had no idea how to boil an egg when we first met. But look at the feast you threw tonight. It was amazing.” Ty's smile widens into a grin that shows off his beautiful white teeth. Tony’s heart is not racing anymore though. He keeps Ty’s gaze and even manages to keep his soft smile in place, but he can feel the blood draining from his ears and his fingers and toes getting ice cold. He is suddenly very very nauseated  and it won’t be the worst thing in the world if he accidentally throws up right this moment.
He pulls the blanket up to his neck and looks out of the window as the buildings become more condensed. He is dizzy, lightheaded and the humming sound of the car and the rain are making him very, very sleepy.  Then Captain Rogers turns the radio on and thank fuck, the most ridiculous love song of all time is playing.
and Ty is still rolling his eyes as he reaches for the Cognac glass on Helen’s tray. Captain Rogers, however, does not roll his eyes. He doesn’t look at him disapprovingly either. He puts one arm on his chest, throws his head back and laughs so hard that even the chair he is sitting on shakes a little. Tony is now hot, he is probably sweating under his suit jacket. The melody of Captain Rogers’ laughter has made a swirling wave low in his belly and fuck the damn hormones but he is thinking things he should not be thinking and the whole thing is suddenly really really inappropriate.
“Mr. Stark, is it true that you’re self-isolating with the hooker you picked up at a bar two nights ago? We have footage of you groping him in the elevator, but none of the gay escort services in Houston have been able to identify him.”
“Iron Man is just a man in a suit of armor. Take the suit away and what is he? I mean, we don’t know what the guy behind that mask looks like. Even
“Come home with me, Steve. I don’t want to be where you’re not.” Something is pounding between them. It might be Tony’s heart, or his own, Steve can’t tell for sure. He is not sure if he is hearing right or not; if he is mixing up Tony’s words with the song.
Tony wonders if there is a limit for a person’s humiliation. He’s been thinking about that all night, thinking this is it, this is the breaking point that he would come apart and stop existing but he has not.
“But you…” Steve breathes out. “You…” He breathes in. “The difference is that you…” He runs his hands through his hair and crosses them over his chest.
“And then I met you,” Steve continues, his voice small and wistful, like he's talking about something that’s not there anymore, “a perfect stranger, a random guy from a random bar I wasn’t even supposed to walk into. I can’t even get drunk for God’s sake, I just wanted to… be like normal people for a couple of hours.”
“I want you to… I want to…” He wants Tony. He is close, so close, but not nearly enough and that’s the only thing Steve wants.
. The word has such a nice ring to it though, and Steve allows himself to think about it for a few more seconds, before shaking his head again, this time to push the fuzzy happiness fog away. “I'm sorry, you're kinda loud on the phone, and I have nothing else to do, except for summing up the numbers you shout all day.”
He stands at the foot of the bed and watches Steve for a moment. The anticipation of what’s coming next makes the butterflies fly again in Steve’s stomach and the way Tony seems to be admiring the sweaty flushed mess Steve must be right now, builds more heat low in his belly. He is warm and dizzy and buzzing with want without the tiniest shred of doubt about doing this. He is not even nervous, although he always thought he would be when he finally does it, but now…he feels right. He feels safe.
Steve nodded and breathed out, his lips brushing against Tony’s again. Tony stayed like that, with Steve’s lips against his for a few more seconds before he reluctantly turned to look over his shoulder - it felt wrong not to feel Steve’s breath on his face - because someone was coughing somewhere in the distance.
Tony looks pale, even under the thick layer of the darker foundation he has been wearing recently. He needs to eat before he hits the point of fainting, but the idea of food spins his head and makes his stomach churn. He holds on to the edge of the dresser, and the idea of their guest
Steve doesn’t seem to mind though. He takes the sweat pants, couple of t-shirts, and the change of underwear to his ‘room’ because Tony
Bruce asks for a glass of sweetened water because the IV bag is only saline and Tony can now get sugar because he is awake and can confirm that he is not diabetic. Captain Rogers does not even look annoyed as he walks out to get the glass of water and Tony wonders if Brooklyn falls outside of the U.S. or if this house is some sort of magical wonderland because he has never dared to simply ask an alpha to
Pepper is furious, as expected. Tony has apparently confirmed he is self-isolating with someone he picked up from a bar - a point that Tony strongly disagrees with - and that’s apparently a huge PR nightmare, as Tony Stark has been irresponsible and reckless again, in a time of such horrible crisis. As far as Tony is concerned, the media can go fuck themselves, because he has not done a single thing wrong. Pepper, however, ‘begs to differ’ and is explaining to Tony how she has spent the past four hours with PR and legal trying to mitigate the issue, in some not very nice words.
“It’s ok buddy, I never thought you might be a corporate spy or something. You look too innocent for that, to be honest.” and his smile goes lopsided again making Steve smile too.
“About 10 hours then.” Dr. Stark narrows his eyes. “Did you, by any chance, use sexual enhancing drugs?”
Steve’s breath hitches, and he shivers, fully aware that his cock is leaking into Dr. Stark’s hand. He tries to reply, he really does, but his brain is not capable of forming words, proper ones at least, because there are some highly inappropriate things at the back of his mind, ready to be voiced. He just shakes his head instead, and hisses with strained breath when Dr. Stark presses on the base of his cock.
He goes through the leftovers in the fridge and sorts out a few snack plates as soon as the water starts to run in Tony’s shower. It will not be weird, and even if it is he can brush it off, as not wanting to deal with Tony fainting just like Ms. Potts, or something along that line. Tony would eat and Steve would stop obsessing and it would be absolutely worth it.
The million different tests that Steve puts Tony through over the next months are more appropriate for a top-secret spy job.
They sleep for hours, holding on to eachother before they receive the rescue communication. Steve helps Tony get dressed and holds his hand through the ride back to Avenger, and lets go reluctantly when Tony is being rolled into Medical 1. He doesn’t notice the heavy feeling in his chest as he’s walked to Medical 2, or as he's being checked up and cleared to go. Sneaking into Medical 1, he watches Tony’s weak smile from across the hall but doesn’t find it in himself to go any closer. Tony’s doing fine, surrounded by his friends, and Steve has no right to impose. Steve’s not Tony’s friend. He’s Tony’s Captain and he’s done what was required to keep him safe like he would for every other crew member.
Tony kisses Steve’s cheek. He kisses his ear and his hair and the soft spot on the side of his neck. Steve turns to press his lips to Tony’s and his soft murmurs turn into broken whimpers when Tony’s fingers wrap around his cock, rubbing gently. Tony’s heart is racing in his chest, the blood roaring in his ears as he starts to move as slowly as he possibly can and stops beating altogether, at least for some time, when Steve starts to move in the same rhythm, slow but certain.
He can do that. Maybe just this once, and so carefully so he doesn’t get used to it, but right here and right now, he will take this one. Happily.
Dr. Stark’s eyes go soft, and his face eases into a soothing smile. “Of course not, Steve, of course not. It’s just a very rare accident, and I have to double-check because I need to know what material I’m dealing with before the physical examination, whether there is a chance of breakage when we’re trying to extract it, you know things like that.”
“I nearly died,” he says, his fingers snaking forward to find Tony’s. “I thought I lost you,” he whispers and his knees buckle and hit the hard floor with a dull thud.
“Of course, anything about the new engines. Part of the job, I guess, to know as much as possible about the ship I command.”
Captain Rogers kneels on the floor and brings the glass to Tony’s mouth. He’s changed since last night, dim gray sweatpants with a white T-shirt just like the one Tony’s wearing now that doesn’t say ARMY on the front, and he doesn't seem to have had a second to run a hand through his hair before rushing out of his bedroom.
He is still wearing his white shirt and black pants but he has gotten rid of his shoes and socks and, well, even his feet are A-class alpha material.
His each and every reason to miss chief officers’ meetings are absolutely legitimate and Commander Romanoff can’t give him the “you’re starving yourself” speech anymore, as he’s arranged for his food to be delivered to Captain’s Ready Room.
The idea rolls through Steve’s body and tears run down his face. Tony is the one Steve has been waiting for; awake or asleep, buried under miles of ice in a stretch between two centuries. He
He sits on the bed and listens carefully. He wishes he was in his own house, so he could get JARVIS to check on Steve, and it takes him a minute to decide that making sure Steve is okay should be more important than respecting his privacy. Worst that could happen is catching Steve masturbating, which would not be the worst scene in the world and maybe Tony can help out; like one of those low-quality porn movies he secretly loves to watch.
It never gets old, after two years, that first brush of Steve’s fingers against Tony’s cock. The thrill that tingles down Steve’s spine from the slick already soaking Tony’s thong, the pure bliss of slipping his two fingers into Tony’s warm inviting hole, and the way Tony goes pliant, completely. The rare moment of having him not fight back, even if it’s too short; it’s blink and you miss it.
“I could smell the dark chocolate scent from across the hall,” he says as Steve lifts him in the air and holds him against the door, “and besides, who started yelling the moment I walked into that briefing room? You know how much I enjoy seeing you go crazy, gritting your teeth and pushing your fists—,” and that’s all he manages to get out before Steve pushes in, and they both go quiet for a few seconds.
Tony looks into Steve’s eyes. “Who knew that Captain America would be into exhibitionism?” And he wiggles his eyebrow, his face lighting up into an easy smile. “Not that I am shaming or objecting sweetheart, your kink is my kink and it’s okay.”
“Please, Tony,” Steve tries miserably, surprised that he is capable of forming words, “please, I want--” He doesn’t know how to move on from that though, and he stutters. He doesn’t know what he wants, let alone how to put it into words, he just knows that he wants, more than he's ever wanted anything in his life.
“Okay turn around, get back to your dishes,” Tony teases as he gently pushes his chin to the side of Steve’s face, and Steve turns to the sink and back to the dishes.
Tony smiles. “Look, I am not judging you, it’s perfectly okay to have a crush on…well anybody.” And he turns to his side too, so he can look at Steve’s perfect eyes that are so adorably confused right now.
It feels like being seasick while sailing in his dad’s yacht in the ocean, or that tractor ride in the valley on his seventh birthday. The car is shaking too much, and Tony’s head is swimming frantically, without reaching anywhere to hold on to, to stop, to take a breath.
“Oh come on,” Tony snaps and takes a couple of steps forward. “Was it that bad? Is it that embarrassing? I mean you always had the option of letting me die, you know, so it’s not like I forced you into it.”
Tony looks up, so quickly that a stabbing pain cuts through his back, and he blinks at Mr. Murdock. He doesn’t know what’s supposed to be right, obviously, because he’s been lost inside his
Tony caresses Steve’s hair and brushes the side of his face. “Don’t say that sweetheart, you need some alien grade glue to get selfish to stick to you.”
“Dr. Stark, please. Wait, just, wait.” Steve tries, feeling the sweat that’s trickling down his temple all of a sudden. “This is not the main problem. There is… something else.”
This will be the same, Steve repeats to himself, ignoring the way his cock is straining and leaking even more, unsure how that’s even possible at this stage, and he does as Dr. Stark says. He takes a very deep breath, because he’s got this, despite the unfortunate incident, being on display and spreading wide, despite the blinding embarrassment. He has got this.
,’" Tony sighed. "Took me a while to stop trying to change his mind.” He smiled absentmindedly and tore his eyes away from the disinfection building to look at Barnes.
“I won’t be imposing on you? You know, taking up your space? I am generally organized and I clean up after myself but I'd still be around, you know… all the time.”
It’s amazing how Tony’s hands start to shake when they reach Steve’s ass. It’s a novel moment for Tony as much as it would be for Steve, and Tony is thrilled and terrified at the same time. He does his best to be especially careful, as he slides his palm on Steve’s ass, and God, it’s firm and smooth and so fucking perfect that Tony wants to squeal with joy. He runs his palm on each of Steve’s cheeks, in small circles and watches the way Steve’s body tremors from the start to the end of each motion. Tony wraps his other hand around Steve to keep him still and he goes on drawing small circles on Steve’s ass. It’s just a breathtaking scene to witness;  the way Steve is coming apart in Tony’s arms, hard and blushing, from Tony's touch alone, with just one hand.
Steve chews his mouthful of bacon, as slowly as he can, hoping not to choke and cough instead of a reply, and looks up gradually, as if the air would become less thin if he takes his time to think about what Tony had just said.
“Don’t beat yourself up, Steve. It’s perfectly normal to be aroused in this situation, and man, I promise you, compared to what I usually hear in this room, between pained cries and frustrated insults, this-” he looks up and gestures to Steve “-is much preferred and a nice change of pace. It’s okay. You’re okay.” And he winks, or that’s what Steve’s mind makes up, he can’t be sure, but the lightning that runs through Steve’s spine is real, for sure, because it burns all the way from the back of his neck down to the tip of his toes.
Steve wipes his eyes, as he’s apparently crying for real. “Okay I will,” he rasps, clutching Tony’s hand. “I just don’t want you to die before knowing that I will die without you.”
Bucky manages to make Steve sit on the wheelchair to go back to his own room, only after the head nurse promises to put Steve’s omega in the same room as him as soon as he’s out of CCU.
We are discussing COVID-19 pandemic, as usual, without mentioning the name, so if you don't want to be exposed to that topic, please take care of yourself and don't read this one.
Because it felt right, for the first time in forever, he tells himself for the hundredth time, to trust someone. Why would Tony feel the same way? He couldn’t. He definitely shouldn't.
He slides down the counter and leans his hip against it. “Anyone else, you ask? Ty fucking hates everyone. ‘Don’t speak to Carol, she’s an alpha, she has a crush on you.’ ‘Why did you smile so much when we were on a fucking double date, with Jan and Hank? They’re both betas so you never know.’” He runs his hands through his hair and keeps his fingers there, pulling slightly, and Steve has to press his thighs from inside his pockets to stop himself from reaching over and stopping him.
“But he takes one look at me, and I go completely bananas, it’s pathetic, no joke,” he mumbles as he keeps smashing his breakfast and Steve has to flex his fingers to keep from reaching over the table and wrapping them around Tony’s fingers. “It’s the stupid alpha scent and years of co-dependency. I end up doing whatever he asks me to do. And yet, he goes on and does-” he points to the side of his neck “-this.”
is not just too many days spent in court corridors but it also means a growing bump that will get harder and harder to cover up, leading to Ty finding out and exercising his power about his child's living arrangements, before any hearing can come to any conclusion. Or
Steve is not sure about what happens next exactly. He remembers being held tight and kissed as they pay for their drinks, walk out of the back door, and into a hotel lobby that is apparently right behind the dingy bar. He remembers the hand that’s wrapped around his waist the whole time, as Tony talks to the hotel reception and the amazing feeling of Tony’s body pressing him onto the elevator mirror all the way up to level one hundred and fifty-something.
Steve runs his fingers in Tony’s hair, and they tingle the back of Tony’s neck. “He is not my celebrity crush, Tony, I promise.”
The world starts to spin and the floor ceases to be solid. He’s folding, falling, dying maybe. It will be hours before someone comes looking for him, and there are some perks to being dead, like not having to think about the pathetic image that he would make lying on the bathroom floor. Bruised, foul and filthy; a perfect reflection of who he’s ended up as.
Tony seems to have no options here, except for believing that Steve actually means what he is saying; that he actually doesn’t want anything back. It’s a gesture, a token, something oddly in context, and so precious. For once he can just have and not worry about anything else.
strong then,” Dr. Stark says, his voice a little too hoarse maybe, something sounding off that Steve can’t quite put a finger on.
Steve sits at the coffee table to draw the skyline on the west side of the hotel but he ends up scribbling swirling circles that he just does not want to look at. He looks under the coffee table and grabs a bunch of magazines that are probably very expensive and significant culturally, but skimming through, Steve can’t seem to find anything interesting. He is an inch away from generalizing rich people to be tasteless and boring when he finally gets to a special issue of TIME magazine. He takes one look at the cover and all the uneasiness and boredom melts away like snow in April sunshine.
Tony closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He slaps Ty’s hand away from his face with a strength he can’t quite work out the source of and knocks his full Cognac glass over the Egyptian cotton tablecloth as he pushes his chair back and stands up. He waits a few seconds for the room to stop reeling around then turns and marches out without looking back at Ty.
Tony takes another sip of his hot chocolate, as his eyes wander between the two alphas, who refuse to look at him at the moment. He is fairly certain of the reason Ty has yet to file a missing omega report - a bunch of Stark Industries legal and PR people huddling around the breakfast table, advising him to keep it quiet for now, while the entire security team combs through every single contact traced to Tony’s small group friends who might have anything to do with his disappearance; people who work for a company that’s Tony’s legal property, paid with his money that he himself cannot access, helping Ty make Tony’s life a little more miserable once again.
The OR corridors are colder than the ER treatment rooms, for some reason, which has nothing to do with the amount of blood that Steve’s lost or the way his team look like a defeated army, scattered on different chairs.
Steve tightens his grip around Tony’s fingers slightly and takes a deep, deep breath. He then brushes the back of Tony’s hand gently, before he turns to the unwelcome, loud jerk, who is, as expected, Ty fucking Stone.
There are new flowers along the side of the road, so he picks some as he comes back from his morning run. He yells at everyone to do laundry because the whole compound smells like sweat and spit after so many days of non-stop running around. He finds clean sheets in the linen closet at the back of the main living room, the same place they used to be two years ago, and changes everyone’s sheets, even if it means that he has to drag Thor off of his bed with the dirty beddings. He cooks a pot of spaghetti bolognese because
They both laugh this time, and things seem pretty promising for the first hour of their now mutual self-isolation.
For a few long seconds, nothing moves. Tony wonders if he has imagined the words coming out of his mouth because no one blinks and no one breathes.Then in the blink of an eye, scents around him shift and a hypothetical storm starts pounding at the door. Nat reaches for his hand, holds it in both of hers and whispers something that Tony can’t hear. Something is being shattered on the other side of the bed, so Tony turns back to his right and for a second his brain cannot find the relation between the image, the sound and the concept. Then the storm slams the door open, his blood starts to freeze and his brain can finally process what’s happening right in front of him.
Steve narrows his eyes and he looks at Tony disapprovingly. Tony makes a mental note, although this is probably the worst time for it; Steve disapproves a lot and looks just as perfect doing it.
Tony finishes off the bagel, takes another sip of coffee, and twitches his face. “Ham and cheese sandwiches? I am sure it was more than one, so let’s say three?”
“Okay, I hear you, and I agree with you. How about I get the hotel to let me donate the money on their behalf? To the cause of helping people in hardship during self-isolation?”
“So, Iron Man then?” Tony is standing behind the couch as they watch Iron Man disappear into the gray cloudy sky, in the very last video that is available from him online.
two years ago and the light blue tie he never managed to make Ty buy. A twisted rush runs down the back of his neck and his tummy flutters in a dark excitement as he pictures himself dressed in different shades of blue for an event. He stops thinking about it quickly though, because Ty is calling him from the bathroom. Nothing to do with the dull pain that he still feels in his left arm even after two  years.
Steve wakes up with the sound of a ringing phone and a deep low voice talking, which sounds kinda angry. In the sleepy confusion of the first seconds after waking up, he wonders if he has done something wrong and his heart drops as he sits up in the still warm but empty bed.
Something changes in the air  as soon as he sets his eyes on Tony, though, and a hint of a smile lingers on the corner of his lips. He enjoys the look of his colors on me, Tony muses and a rush of relief washes him over like a warm summer breeze. It’s completely obvious, the sparkle shining in his eyes, and Tony’s heart does a tiny flip, his stomach churning at the same time, because God, it’s so bad to feel this good about being the reason for that sparkle, that hint of a smile; it’s perfect and horrible, so overwhelming that he wants to cry.
Tony shoves the rest of the eggs inside his mouth and drinks what’s left in the mug, like a good omega, even if it’s too hard to swallow around the lump that doesn’t go down with food or drink.
He taps on the voicemails, and it might be hunger, or the toll of the eventful hours he’d had, but Nat’s words blur and get mixed up with Tony’s and Steve can’t tell for sure if he is understanding it correctly, at least until the very end.
“I just acted according to the situation. Assessing on the spot, you know the handbook stuff they teach you at the Academy. I have nothing to be worried about,” Tony says without turning to Clint, his breath blowing warm on Steve’s face.
“Usually we’d give the patient a mild sedative that allows the sphincter to relax. Then we use a speculum to view the object so forceps can be used to remove it,” Dr. Stark says, in a sing-song voice, as if he has ‘extracted’ a million plugs from a million unfortunate asses sticking up in the air just like Steve’s. “On rare occasions though, when there are any concerns about the patient's reaction to the drugs, we try the manual opening technique.”
Tony is shaking. He feels dizzy and nauseated, not really sure about anything anymore. He doesn’t want to think about the hours spent contemplating the perfect magazine capacity and the implication of that perfect magazine when an active shooter is changing it to fire into a crowd in the local mall. He drops his hand, claws the table cloth and then the fucking stupid tears start running down his face.
“It’s okay Steve. I’ve decided to trust you. For the same reason you’ve decided to trust me with-- with you, I’ve decided to trust you. With all of me.”
Safe, held tight in Tony’s hands, washed with pleasure and thrumming with anticipation, open, loose, and ready.
“You know, I never got used to people calling me Dr. Stark,” he says, as he pushes his finger in, less gently this time, but in one quick motion. “The sphincter is intact.” His finger moves around and pushes further in as Steve presses his feet down on the stirrups, his fingers digging into the sheet under him on the exam table. “Dr. Stark is my dad, and he used to be an attending in this hospital when I was an intern.” There is more pressure and more push. “No tears or tenderness in the walls.” The finger goes further up, just barely brushing up against his prostate, and it takes every ounce of Steve’s willpower to not move his feet and kick Dr. Stark in the face. “He runs the company now, and I envy him so much, because he gets to deal with prosthetics and medical technology. Ah, there we go, I found it,” he says happily, and Steve wonders if his head would explode with the way the plug shifts as Dr. Stark’s finger touches the edge of the damn thing. “I always wanted to become an engineer, but he wouldn't even listen to me talk about it. Eh, water under the bridge.” He pulls his finger out of Steve’s ass in another swift motion, and it’s just impossible, how his whole body burns, in a jumble of mismatched sensations.
Captain Rogers is still pacing when Tony opens his eyes. His blood pressure is probably around zero and it would be the perfect time to pass out right as Captain Rogers finally takes the driver's seat and turns around to face him. It can't get any worse than this. It will just be over.
Ty lets go of Tony’s fingers and wraps his hand around Tony’s shoulders. “The pleasure is all mine, sir. Please call me Ty.” He squeezes Tony’s shoulder, sending a frosty line across Tony’s chest, so he shifts a little in place and rubs his hand on the outside of his thigh to stop himself from pulling away. “And Captain Rogers, this is my omega, Tony.”
He doesn’t miss Tony’s soft breaths and beautiful smiles every single second of every single day. He doesn’t want to hold Tony close and smell his hair, and he definitely does not want to make him whimper and moan in pleasure, properly this time. He doesn’t want any of that. He doesn't get to want any of that.
Tony walks the distance between the kitchen entrance and the sink and puts a quick kiss on Steve’s nose. “Well, not the same. I seriously wanted to watch you wash the dishes wearing an apron, but I guess we have to do with what we got,” and he wraps his hands around Steve’s waist and leans in for a long kiss, that is soft and slow but leaves Steve hot all over and panting for air.
here-” Steve emphasizes the name, just to see the tic in the corner of the alpha’s eyes, “-is in no condition to make this decision. I suggest that you hold it off for tonight, and come back some other—”
“Sorry Stark, Steve kept sending me these cell phone messages, all complaining about you being late, and I got tired of replying. So I just came here to babysit him.”
He sits on the edge of the bed, awkwardly straight, and Tony’s heart starts to shake in his chest. The warmth spreads under his skin, spilling into his head and his thoughts race one another, so fast that it’s impossible to collect and rearrange them in order. Mr. Murdock is the best in the field of runaway omegas, apparently, and he’ll be here
“Alright everyone, let’s get this spaceship out of trouble,” he says with more enthusiasm than he feels, “Lieutenant Lang, please send the communication back to base. Commander Barton, we need the diagram Commander Stark asked for, asap.” He grabs his PADD and shoves his free hand in his pocket. “Commander Romanoff, you have the conn.”
Shame swirls in his chest with the idea of Tony walking in on him in whatever miserable state he must have been in, and for a second he wonders if he can sneak out of Tony’s hold, out of the room and out of this place altogether.
Steve scratches the back of his neck and breathes through the unbearable wave of arousal that’s running through his body from the words. “I might have an idea.”
to put on foundation. With dark bruises blackening his eyes and spreading down his cheeks, he looks more like what’s-his-face in fight club, although a little less masculine and with slightly narrower shoulders. As bruised and broken as he’s been before, Tony has never looked like this.
They could still see Tony in the distance as he was making his way along the beach to go back to the fort. Tony had walked this same path many times after his usual midday visits that they would spend sitting on this same bench behind quarantine buildings. This would be the last time Steve would watch Tony go for as long as he could before Tony would turn around, to wave at Steve just before disappearing behind the trees that shaded the road. There would be no other time, Steve told himself, and he rubbed his chest to ease the trapped breath that was refusing to come out. Never again. None.
The fourth plain white t-shirt looks worse than the first three. Steve runs his hand on the back of his neck and wonders if he should go back to the first plain white one; he is not planning to wear a button-up shirt to this date--dinner, or whatever.
Tony lets go of Steve’s hand and walks to the sound system on the shelf under the TV to turn it on. The lights are dimmed, flickering if you pay enough attention, as Tony had set them to the candlelight mode. You don’t need candles to have a candlelit room these days, and Steve can’t complain; the smell of blown-out candles reminds him of late nights, shivering from cold in the army tents, waiting for the enemy bombers to fly past.
I am sorry it is still sad and the abuse is more graphic. I wish I could say I have made this all up an none of this happens in real life but unfortunately, that would not be true :( I promise things will get better slowly and there would definitely be a happy ending.
We are almost there people, almost!! A little bit more to go only, and I am so excited!!! Let's do this!!!!
Steve squints at the TV screen as he reads the question. “Which movie star would you really want to have sex with?”
He informed Mr. O'Connell of his plans for departure while sorting the disinfected luggage in the clean storage room for the last time and helped with settling the second-class passengers of the newly-arrived ship into Quarantine Building 2, which did not take long.
Tony’s other hand rubs soothing circles on Steve’s stomach, as he pumps his finger in and out. Waves of pleasure flutter through Steve’s core with every slide, and it’s good, God, it’s amazing, Steve could stay like this, splayed out and spread wide, at Tony’s mercy, for the rest of his life.
He takes all Tony’s clothes off and kisses his body, inch by inch, before resting his head on Tony’s chest to kiss and lick the stunning scars. Tony’s breath hitches and his words become unintelligible as Steve’s fingers move around his cock and he comes in Steve’s hand moaning and shaking, as he clings to Steve like Steve is the only one, like Steve is all he’s got in the world.
By the time it’s bright outside, Steve is naked and panting. Tony has kissed his lips, tasting and biting, and has nibbled and licked the line down his throat, on his chest and his navel many times. Steve is on his back, sweaty and flushed and burning all over. He wants-- he doesn’t know what. He just
He keeps his forehead on Steve’s a little longer, as they kiss and whimper in each other's arms and Tony could swear that this must be what heaven feels like, figuratively, the way Steve parts his lips and Tony’s tongue gets to taste his mouth. Steve rubs his hands up and down Tony’s back then, and it feels like fireworks along Tony’s skin. Tony might need to change his last statement after all, because this, this must be what heaven feels like, literally and figuratively.
The omega moves his head, slowly, and looks at Steve. He then smiles insanely wider than before and his too innocent, too out-of-it face breaks Steve’s heart a little.
"Brooklyn. ’m mad in love with Brooklyn. I was born and raised there.” Captain Rogers looks at Tony and smiles. “Moved back two years ago. Live and work there like a true local.”
“Nice to meet you, sir.” Barnes’s accent had a nice ring as it reminded Tony of Steve’s but years of living in Australia had apparently rounded the edges a little bit. He seemed humble and friendly, and he was well presented, wealthy enough to wear a Homburg hat. He seemed perfect. Tony hated him.
“I’m such a loser,” Tony says in a small voice, “to call you, a complete stranger I spent a night on his couch - fully clothed - to come save me from my own mess.” And he trails off, pointing around, before going back to playing with his thumbs.
Pepper sits by Tony’s bed and holds his hand. Steve doesn’t need to look at the deep wrinkle between her brows to know that he’s not welcome to stay. Holding Tony in his arms, carrying him to bed, and tucking him under the blankets they used to cuddle under, is more than enough. Knowing that he’s not gone; that there is a shred of hope left in the world to keep going for.
Tony takes a deep breath to steady himself as Steve pulls away and blinks a few times till he is finally able to focus on his phone. “Truth or dare?”
What would happen if he asked for the car to be stopped? To take a walk to breathe fresh air, assuming he can stand on his feet? Would Captain Rogers be one of those alphas who get antsy when someone touches the window handle?
He crosses his arms across  his chest and then looks away, too quickly, because Tony must be looking miserable right now. He turns back to face the road and turns the key in the ignition. The car starts with a jittery heavy sound and Tony’s heart stops beating altogether.
Steve is restless. He can’t sit. He can’t lie down or walk or work out for that matter. What Tony has said plays on repeat in his mind and he wishes he could tune it out but he just can’t. He thinks about it over and over and over again, until the words lose all meaning, but nothing makes sense. Why would Tony trust Steve? With
“We are almost there, Steve,” he says and looks up at Steve’s face with a gentle nod. “You are doing really well, holding nice and still. I’ll now add another finger.”
Moving down, Tony’s fingers caress the inside of Steve’s thighs, slide through the crease of his ass and cup his balls just for a second. Steve whimpers and moans and an extreme rush of arousal runs from Tony’s chest right into his cock. He can’t help doing it again, and again and one more time until Steve can’t seem to hold his weight up straight anymore. He stumbles forward just a couple of inches and his hands find the wall for support as Tony keeps touching his balls, they both shivering from the sensation. Steve lets out a startled cry as Tony’s other hand moves up a bit and starts rubbing on his pecs. He breathes short and heavy when Tony’s fingers find his nipples and Tony’s breath comes short and heavy too, he is lightheaded again and can’t remember if he has ever been turned on like this.
Steve looks pale, more than he usually does and he sounds too hesitant, too worried, as his voice breaks a little with every word.
but that seems too much of a far reach in  this  situation. Captain Rogers doesn’t seem to be taking Tony back to hand him over to Ty, at least not right now, and the hope  of that never happening, is too sweet to tamper with. It’s stupid but part of him thinks that maybe if he doesn’t say anything, he might actually have enough time on the outside to get his hands on a phone and call Rhodey before Captain Rogers changes his mind.
at the last minute was a walk in the park. Realizing how his sanity and judgment can deteriorate at Warp-cubed speed, on the other hand, is nerve-racking. He never thought he’d meet an omega, ever, let alone be helpless like this with just downing one lungful of his scent. It suddenly makes sense why a lot of scientific articles subtly imply that ABO extinction is in line with progress and human evolution. It still hurts. But it at least makes sense.
He tries to think about something happy but his brain is betraying him as always. Slow constant movements and dizziness make him drift off slowly. He finally comes up with something to be happy about: the fact that he has thrown up back in the bedroom so there is little chance he will be covered in his puke when he finally gets the fuck out of here.
Captain Rogers pulls the stone face mask he’d rushed into the room with back down and Nat’s fingers around Tony’s tighten a little. Tony presses his thumb to the back of her palm, stroking gently and Nat brings her other hand to wrap around their intertwined fingers. An unspoken message that apparently calms them both, that they’re okay, they’re safe, that alphas scaring them even when they don’t mean to is nothing to worry too much about.
The sugar water had not saved that tiny red and gold butterfly with a torn wing that cold spring morning all those years ago, and even Jarvis is not around anymore to hold Tony in his arms so he can at least cry for failing to find a way to save his not-yet-born but already too-badly-hurt butterfly.
“I couldn’t fall asleep after I woke up. Ironic, I guess, like my body had decided it had slept long enough for the better part of a century and it needed no more. Nothing worked. Nothing helped. Not even a whole bottle of pills crushed in a glass of water could put me to sleep. I was walking in a nightmare, wide awake, day and night, but hey it was okay, right? Because my body can survive without sleep. The serum takes care of everything. Who cares if the serum can’t fix the hollow feeling in my chest? Or the dread that starts to pool in my gut as soon as it starts to get dark when the only thing to do is drowning in the ocean of the images I’m desperate to forget?” Steve rubs his eyes and scratches his head as the lightning hits and the thunder booms. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, to grasp his thoughts, and the image of Steve downing a glass of cloudy water and yet living in one long-winded insomnia feels like a hand pressing Tony’s throat.
Steve chews the inside of this cheek and cracks his knuckles. “It’s too dangerous, I can’t possibly allow you to jeopardize yourself like that.”
It’s dark outside when they are finally naked and it’s only because of the flickering lights of the TV, that Tony can revel in the sight that is Steve’s full-body blush, Or his slightest trembles as Tony kisses his throat, his neck, and his chest. Steve lifts his head to look at Tony with the most endearing blend of confusion and despair when Tony takes them both in hand and Steve’s breathing gets short and heavy as he falls back onto the couch when Tony’s strokes quicken. Tony’s vision is blurry by that point. He is hazy and dazed, but he does his best to take in the way Steve closes his eyes and throws his head back, moaning and shaking and how he opens them to look at Tony just before he comes undone. It’s right then, when Tony finally lets go too, as Steve pulls him in, placing sloppy kisses on Tony’s lips and cheeks and hair as they come, tangled in each other and the colors dancing in Steve’s eyes take Tony’s breath away, although he has no breath left in him anyway. It’s a bliss, a joy, a different kind of content. It’s a flood of warmth that washes over Tony instead of washing him up because Steve is holding on to him, like Tony’s the only one, like Tony’s all he’s got in the world.
but the power of the fantasy shocked the hell out of him. It felt real, like he had just seen it with his own eyes, thrilling and yet so painful, the fact that he was not the one in Steve’s arms but also… he wasn’t the one touching Bucky.
Steve lets go of the back of his neck. “Well, yes? It’s just that… it’s just that I feel, you know, useless. Going around here all day, listening to you trying to save the world with the snap of your fingers,” he mutters a little shakily and Tony feels a sudden urge to kiss better the unhappiness that is wrinkling Steve’s forehead. Steve’s lips press into a thin line and he looks down, as he continues, too sad for Tony’s liking. “My job is not exactly the kind you can do from home, and I try, you know, to be there for my team. Move things around to improve their insurance or up the living arrangements SHIE-- our employer has come up with for those who are not based in New York. But aside from checking on them like once a day and playing house husband here, I do nothing to help people.”
Tony kisses and licks, moaning as his tongue delves in, tasting Steve’s body, and Steve cries out loud when Tony’s fingers replace his tongue, out of nowhere, replaced by his tongue and back to fingers, before Steve can register either, so many times that he loses count, loses control, and stops trying to hold on altogether.
Steve falls asleep as the first rays of dawn paint the sky, slouched in the chair by the window with his head on the desk, and wakes up to the first footsteps that echo in the hallway, excruciating pain racking through his body that he brushes off to the extra miles he’d run the day before.
meant to be,” Tony tries desperately, even if he knows that he’s still missing a large part of the picture. “I’m sure it is. Is the universe always supposed to be cruel and crazy? It
“Please,” Steve finally manages, his voice sounding odd in his own ears, “I do... want you to,” and he closes his eyes, leaning back into Tony’s frame because he is dizzy and light-headed and he can’t hold on anymore.
Steve blushes at a dirty joke, giggles and blushes a bit more, embarrassed from giggling and blushing in the first place. Tony smiles at the whole show Steve’s got going on and lays a reassuring hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve’s body freezes for a second, and he feels numb from the touch before something starts to burn through his left shoulder down to his chest and set his whole body on fire.
“I went shopping and stocked the fridge with edible things, including real food. I took a photo, and the only person I wanted to show it to was you. Too weird right?”
Tony’s alive and is nibbling at Steve’s skin and maybe, just maybe, there is still a chance to make things right.
“Between four to seven hours. Closer to four because statistically, the black hole’s gravity ratio might increase as they get closer to the core.”
The time to do the damn scene has come too quickly - it feels like the night in the diner back in November was just a week ago - and Tony’s pounding heart and numb fingers contradict the ‘absolutely ready’ statement he’s made 30 times in the past day in response to Steve’s concerned looks and pointed questions.
The dim glow of the table lamp does not extend inside the bathroom and feeling for the switch on the wall behind through the blinding pain in his ribcage is a damn struggle. He tries to breathe through the pain, even if the air refuses to go in and hurts to come out, and has to lean gainst the door in preparation to see what’s now hidden in the dark.
He opens the top drawer of the desk and stares at a framed piece of sandwich wrapping paper with Steve’s first ‘I love you’ note written on it, right next to the fluffy Iron Man socks that used to keep Steve’s toes warm on cold winter nights. Grabbing a sketchbook from the neat stack in the second drawer, Steve browses through the pages and runs his fingers on the wrinkled lines here and there. Something’s spilled on them, perhaps, like the golden liquid in the half-empty Macallan 18 bottle that Steve had found in the bottom drawer. Or tears. Tony’s tears. Not that Steve deserves a single drop. Not that he doesn’t wish every second of every hour to be able to go back in time and uncry those tears.
“Nat, go to the gallery and take over the final prep for the show tomorrow because we can’t possibly mess with that and get Clint to come to Brooklyn Family Court ASAP as I might need him there as a witness.”
Jarvis was not Tony’s dad, though, and Nat, this room, this whole fantasy island where he’s magically landed, does not belong to him. Captain Rogers, as charitable and decent as he might be, is not Tony’s friend; he’s an alpha, who has no fucking reason to be in Tony’s corner.
is tasteful enough to admire me?” He kisses Steve’s forehead, trails down slowly, kissing the line of Steve’s nose. “Don’t think I am that lucky to have such an admirer, Steve.”
Tony smiles and nods, before rubbing his eyes and messing up his hair. “I’m exhausted and a little woozy, I think the stress is catching up with me.”
Tony takes a deep breath. “First of all, I had no idea you lead a team and I think you should always start with that, because it’s damn hot.” He smiles as he wiggles an eyebrow and Steve’s face unwrinkles a little as he smiles back with his eyes. “Secondly, you do realize that you’ve donated an exorbitant amount of money to the Maria Stark Foundation special pandemic fund right? Four Seasons is matching dollar for dollar and it already adds up to around--”
I got the general idea of this game from "Full Disclosure Strip, Truth or Dare Game for Lovers" and adapted it to some sort of digital version. I have not played that game though so no idea how that one goes exactly!
“Thank you, Cap, I had a blast. We should do it again sometime, maybe somewhere with more privacy?” Tony seems endearingly happy, as he tangles his feet to Steve’s and Steve doesn’t find it in himself to doubt his words; the ‘having a blast’ part, or ‘doing it again’.
“It should be very little discomfort now, and I want you to tell me if it starts to hurt even a little bit. You think you can do that for me, Steve?” Dr. Stark smiles back, and God, why does he look more beautiful with every smile?
“I have no idea what either of you are talking about. Stark’s not an omega. He’s a vampire.” Steve grabs a bottle of water from the side table and opens it with a bit too much force. “Omegas are supposed to be sweet and tame and doe-eyed.” He drinks half of the water in one go. “This one? He’ll bite my ass and suck my blood and set my corpse on fire.” Steve drinks the rest of the water and starts hiccuping. “He will have a party after that, right on top of my ashes.”
Steve grits his teeth, so hard that his jaw starts to hurt. “And you’re all about style, aren’t you?”
Steve shifts a little, easing into Tony’s hold, and Tony feels that breathing becomes a bit easier from then on. “I’m damaged goods, Tony,” he whispers into Tony’s neck, and his breath tingles a line across Tony’s shoulder, “and you--”
though. He brings the glass up to Tony’s lips and his eyes are still pained and distressed but he is not looking gray anymore.
“You were saying, Stark?” Steve teases. “Any chance you can whistle for me now?” Tony growls around Steve’s fingers and his hole clenches around Steve’s cock. “No?” he slams his hip against Tony’s, so hard that the door thuds and rattles, but hopefully not hard enough to make a dent. Tony clenches Steve’s flesh between his fingers and tightens his feet around Steve’s waist, his eyes full of fire but his body limp. He purrs once, so low that Steve wonders if he’s imagined it as soon as it’s done, but something swirls in his belly anyway as he picks up speed, pumping his fist around Tony’s cock, thrusting inside his hole, and moving his fingers, all in harmony. He can’t quite tell who first gives up and lets go but for a minute or two, all there is in the world is just them, Tony’s body enveloping Steve’s as if there is no distance in between, as if Steve can’t tell where he ends and Tony begins, shaking and breathless, washed over by wave after wave of pleasure and relief.
“It’s a shame really because now I need to sign off to go check on the unidentified person I’ve apparently been groping in the elevator, and I can’t answer any more questions,” and he taps on his watch and the noises in the room and in Steve’s head die down immediately.
He took another deep breath and turned the doorknob. As the rational, sane part of Tony had expected, Steve was
The dinner is finally off the table and Tony is happy to have managed to get through it without having to run to the bathroom or throwing up on the table.
“Why are we watching Fox News?” Tony rolls his eyes and shuffles in his seat, trying to move a little closer to Steve as subtly as he can and he takes another bite from the turkey garlic bread sandwich that tastes much better than it sounds. Steve’s constant battle against food waste is absolutely noble but it’s also endearing and hot as fuck, and he must have done it so many times because whatever he cooks up from the leftovers is absolutely amazing.
“I have to examine your abdomen now. Is that okay?” Dr. Stark says gently and waits until Steve makes some sort of movement that could be taken as an affirmative, before stepping forward.
“And if we do nothing, Dr. Banner, by breakfast time tomorrow, they are toast. No pun— what the heck, pun fully intended!” Tony’s eyes are bright with hope. “I can get the shuttle ready to go in an hour, and going at Warp 11 speed we’ll be able to get to them in less than an hour.”  He stands up and tucks his PADD under his arm. “I’ll meet you on board the rescue shuttle in an hour, Captain Rogers, don’t forget your ice bucket.”
“I will,” Captain Rogers says, his voice low, different, a little shaky. “I’ll do it right this time,” he adds, and his fingers clutch the steering wheel with more force than before. “I just...can’t… I just can’t let you down.”
He has finally arrived at the spring but he can’t take the water. It’s pouring out of his clenched fists, no matter how much he squeezes his fingers; you can’t hold water in your hand, and that’s that.
Steve nods gingerly as Tony walks past him and toward the exit, and takes a few deep breaths in hopes of gaining enough composure to be able to follow. It’s not as if Steve didn’t know that Commander Stark is handsome, smart, and charming; Steve had gathered as much from his file, although he looks even better in person. It’s just that some rather life-changing information that Steve's just found out was not mentioned in his personnel file.
burns in his throat and makes his toes go cold, but he manages to bite his bottom lip as Tony leans forward to place the lightest of the kisses on his lips.
“You feel great, Steve,” Tony whispers as he pulls his fingers out suddenly, “perfectly tight and opening so beautifully for me,” he adds, and the dark tint of his voice goes right to Steve’s cock. “I wish you could see this, God, this is-- ” Tony’s lips touch where his fingers were a second ago and Steve’s brain freezes as his body catches on fire.
“We called him last night.” He nods and Tony parts his lips. “And he’s agreed to help,” he adds, lifting the glass just enough to allow a steady stream into Tony’s mouth. The sweetness bursts over his tongue and flows into his veins; the magic of feeding sugar water to a butterfly, like Jarvis used to do when Tony would run into the kitchen with one he’d found around the garden with broken wings. “He’ll be here…” Captain Rogers takes the glass away, sits back on his heels, and flicks his wrist to look at the StarkWatch that was there last night, but is gone now. “Sometime…” he says, and stands up to put the glass back on the nightstand, “...soon. He’ll be here soon.”
“Fair warning though, you might miss dinner.” He smiles with his whole face and the adorable wrinkles show up on the corner of his eyes. “Even breakfast.” He winks and Steve wonders if his heart is ever gonna beat with a normal rhythm after that.
The other part  … is not that stupid. The other part is just a small beaten-up omega, and even smelling the huge angry alpha behind the wheel is enough for him to shut the fuck up.
If it was another time and place, Steve would growl and gather Tony in his arms and lock them both up in the nearest supplies closet for a month, but they’re in a hospital ward full of very sick people about to get caught any second now. So all he does is pull Tony further in, as they part their lips and taste each other, so slow as if it’s barely happening, as if it’s the first time they’re even touching each other, so careful as if what just happened is a delicate glasswork that might shatter any second, all over again.
“I was wondering if you… wanted to…” He sighs and the blush runs down his cheeks pinking the back of his ears. “Would you want to… do a scene with me?” He turns red all over his neck and Tony can see the color running down his chest, through the fabric of his white T-shirt.
him in bed and looking slightly upset because of it. That’s all in his head obviously, because why would Tony actually miss Steve? They’ve known each other for five seconds and Steve’s already been enough trouble for a lifetime. It’s not like he is Steve’s boyfriend or anything.
Steve holds Tony in his arms as they lie on the couch and covers them with the warm knitted throw. Tony kisses Steve’s lips, his face, his hair, his wonderful mesmerizing eyes, and doesn’t know how many times he whispers 'I love you too' in Steve's ears before he falls into a deep dreamless sleep.
“It’s very generous of you, Tony, but I can’t possibly accept it. I'm sure it costs a fortune to stay here for two weeks and I won’t be comfortable knowing that much money’s spent on my accommodation, either way,”
Steve looks at something behind Tony and grimaces. “The nightmares stopped. Waking up with Bucky’s voice still ringing in my ears and being so cold all the fucking time, all of that. Suddenly I wasn’t staggering between agony and grief, I had something to wake up to and sleep for and I thought maybe, just maybe, something good had finally come my way. That it was not a trick, it was not the universe’s new way of fucking with me. That it was just… meant to be.”
Tony pushes on Steve’s sides with both hands as they finally break apart, and Steve turns without missing a beat, as if it’s the thousandth time that he is doing this with Tony’s direction. The idea of touching Steve for the thousandth time stays with Tony, as he runs his soapy hands on Steve’s back and he trembles with every shudder of Steve’s body as his hands slip from the base of his neck to the slight hollow of his waist. He is an unrealistic dreamer, as Pepper points out to him all the time, and a thousand is a nice round number anyway.
It’s that growling, hungry beast, having starved for so long, who’s been told that he’s not good enough to exist, but he’s here, filled with fire and lust, with the way Tony’s scent shifts from desperate to content bit by bit, the quickening pulse of his heart, beating against Steve’s chest, the way he just smiles and closes his eyes, pliant - it’s impossible to keep it from growling.
so many times, and despite Steve’s numerous reassurances, his touches get even lighter when he’s washing and rinsing and drying, well... down there. Steve holds back from reminding him that he heals fast, too fast maybe, and goes easily when Tony makes him lie on his front to put lotion on him and spreads Steve’s cheeks  just to make sure that everything is perfectly normal.
“I thought you left the armed forces ages ago, Captain Rogers. Do they send you a monthly newspaper with updates on the weapons industry? Does it come by post every 3rd Wednesday of the month? Or do they send emails these days?” Tony is usually
It’s gentle and soft, and so heartbreakingly intimate with no rush, no deadline, no one dying on Tony’s watch or because he has not done enough. It’s just Steve, and the way he melts little by little as Tony kisses him back, how he tenderly brushes his tongue over Tony’s lips, burning a line of fire down his neck right into his heart. All else becomes insignificant, with the way they taste each other, over and over and over again, how they nibble, suck, bite; the way they just
over. Barnes was coming to get Steve and Tony would be left to grieve something that was never going to happen anyway.
No matter how much he wants to scream with the slow but steady stretch of his rim as Dr. Stark adds a second finger, the unbearable embarrassment of the precome covering his balls and making a pool on the table, Dr. Stark's fingers pushing in and pulling out, the shreds of pleasure stabbing into his core with every stroke, and the red-hot guilt that comes after every shiver, just for a second, before the next blaze of pleasure takes him all over. He doesn't have to do anything. He can just lie back, breathe, glance at the lines on Dr. Stark’s face which make it so easy to trust him, and hold still.
Even Rhodey, who is the sun and the moon has never ever offered to make a peanut butter sandwich for Tony. He can’t be in wonderland though, or outside of the U.S. He is in too much pain and he can’t go to the hospital if he passes out again unless his alpha shows up miraculously.
He needs to hold it together, and he does, absolutely, at least for the first 22 days after the tragedy Thanos brings upon the universe— despite the thrumming pain in his joints he wakes up to every single morning, that he brushes off to the extra miles he’d run the day before; despite the way the pain spreads in his body as the day goes on.
“Steve?” Tony asks, his voice low and sleepy, lazy fingers combing through Steve’s hair. “What’s happening down there, buddy?”
“I am honored, Steve. I can’t begin to figure out why, but I am happy out of my mind that you were, you know, easy with me,” and he presses his lips against Steve, watching the way Steve gets lost into the kiss before he is lost himself too in the way Steve’s mouth tastes like a Tuscany spring morning which is oddly specific but exactly true.
Tony would love to flatter himself and pretend that it’s the miracle work of his fingers that are making Steve unwind like this, which most probably is not true. It’s an amazing sight though, and Tony makes a note to himself: Steve looks equally perfect standing at parade rest as he does most of the time, or at ease like right now, as if he hasn’t a care in the world.
It’s just hormones, he tells himself, the stupid alpha protectiveness, the urge to knot the omega and break him in. It’s nothing other than the alpha need to keep the omega safe and happy, to just keep the omega, forever and ever, to just have and to just hold.
“Are you sure?” Steve blurts out as he looks at the design and his stomach starts to feel funny, as if something bad’s about to happen. The way the guy’s been going on about his masterpiece of a design had Steve thinking that he’d be tattooing a butterfly, or a tiny moon and an even tinier star on the side of this omega’s delicate neck, but this, the scripted words with the simplest possible font... feels wrong.
We are still discussing the pandemic of the COVID-19 (although I have not mentioned the name so far) so please take care of yourself and don't read this fic if you don't want to be exposed to it.
Steve is not obsessed with the idea of kissing Tony’s lips right at this moment. Or maybe he is but he can’t do anything about it, really. He smiles again instead - he will get muscle pain soon from all the fake smiling - as he spreads peanut butter on all five pieces of toast on his plate.
Also, as usual, we are discussing COVID-19 pandemic without mentioning the name, so if you don't want to be exposed to that topic, please take care of yourself and don't read this one.
distracted with a soft sleepy voice echoing in his brain and saying words that are not meant for him and it hurts only a little bit to be jealous of yourself because at least it’s not someone else. It’s okay, it’s cool. It’s just complicated.
