Sherlock found the bourbon, and two glasses, although seeing as the only two clean receptacles he could find were a teacup and a shotglass, he thought they might be in for an interesting night. John came back and poured them both some bourbon without commenting on his choice of cup. He sat by Sherlock on the couch, opened the safety kit, and took the closest of Sherlock’s hands.
John rolled over again, and Sherlock blinked in surprise as his sudden proximity. John smiled and reached out under the covers, finding Sherlock's waist and dragging him closer. John rested his forehead against Sherlock's chest, sighed contentedly, and to all outward appearances, went straight back to sleep.
They both looked at each other tentatively, and Sherlock’s heart pounded. This was just silly, he’d only just met the man, and already he was staying to help arrange his flat. On the other hand, he’d get to go through John’s stuff, which would be good for his mission to find out more about John.
I opened my mouth to protest, because surely this was making John uncomfortable, when John himself spoke up.
Sherlock was so lucky they'd managed to get John for a roommate. At the beginning, Sherlock had never imagined they'd be able to find a roommate that they could stand living with, but John was a minor miracle in many ways. But she wasn't anyone else's miracle, just Sherlock's, a short girl who dressed in the world's ugliest jumpers.
Why was she feeling so melancholy? She had done it, hadn't she? She'd escaped marriage to a lecherous old man and her familial duties to her kingdom in one successful escape attempt. She was doing what she loved – experimenting with science. As a princess, she had never been allowed to pursue her interests. Half the time, she'd been learning political manipulation, and the other half she'd been applying it. She hated it.
A porter got their bags for them, and Sherlock went up to the front desk to check in, John at his side. John reached for his hand and easily entwined it with his own. Sherlock, who had been about to speak, seemed to take an extra hard breath at John's touch.
Once that was done, John looped another rope closer to Sherlock's bent knee. He could see Sherlock's muscle tensing, holding his leg still for John.
His neighbour’s door was wide open, and there were stacks of boxes piled up in the hallway and propping the door open.
John frowned at me, and I slowly removed my hand from his face, but otherwise didn’t move. I had to listen.
"We're going to try and figure out what stabbed our victim," Molly said. "Would you like to help, John?"
John and the dragon stared at each other for about two seconds before the dragon suddenly coughed and spat out the naga’s head.
And then he put the ice cube he'd picked out of the tray while Sherlock was talking directly on his left nipple.
Sherlock did so, movements slow. His arse cheeks were bright red from his punishment, and his face was bright red from arousal.
"Which one?" Sherlock asked gleefully, knowing full well that Anderson was almost completely incompetent at the best of times.
Sherlock had said to come find him, but now that he was here, he wasn't so sure that Wiggins wasn't right. Gladstone sat down at his side and waited too, tongue lolling out. She wasn't nervous at all, in spite of John's worry.
John stood, and taking Sherlock's hand, lead him down the hall to the bedroom. He expected it to be just as cluttered as the rest of the house. It was surprisingly clean, which made John smile. Of course he'd keep his own room clean.
Bending his knees, he lowered himself until he felt Sherlock's lips on his sack and groaned at the heat and wetness. Sherlock's lips moved, mouthing at his sensitive skin and darting out with his tongue. John felt a throb low in his gut, and he bobbed himself lower until his testicles were enveloped in wet heat.
"This is so..." Sherlock said, unable to come up with a word for it in the moment. They felt remarkably light-headed, and swayed in John's arms.
Gladstone put her ears forward as if on alert and chased him close on his heels as he rushed down the stairs. He struggled with the lock, got the door open, and stopped. It was cold out, the night air of London chilling and damp. He wasn't wearing his layers of clothes, and even his face felt oddly cold after its shearing.
"We're used to sharing a bed by now, right Sherlock?" he said jovially. "Saves us a hundred quid for the night, although I'd have been happier to have gotten a train back to London."
Sherlock tried to sulk on the sofa in his pyjamas, but was shooed off the couch by John, who directed him to get changed. Sherlock sulked, but got changed anyway.
John liked him, and had all along. Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure where this was going, and John hadn’t pushed anything. That was good.
It was also at that moment when I realized that I was very close to John. Very very close, mostly because in my panic I had jumped even closer to him, and my hand was still over his mouth. Oh no. Already I could feel my heart rate picking up and my breath catching.
He lifted his leg and got one foot on the next stair. That was good, he'd already made it as far as he had the previous night. He lifted his other foot, wavered for a moment, and plonked it down next to the other one. Good. Progress.
Sherlock trembled and pulled him back in so that he could forget the world all over again. John grinned against his mouth, and Sherlock embedded the feel of it in his Mind Palace. They kissed for ages, and by the time Sherlock drew away, his chest was heaving and his mouth was tender.
John clenched her fist in the front of Sherlock's shirt and stood on her tip-toes. Without any warning at all, John was
"O, let me not me mad, not mad, sweet heaven; keep me in temper; I would not be mad!" Sherlock exclaimed, and then pouted.
Thanks for being patient everyone! I have been doing lots of work over the semester and am writing an 18 page paper for my PhD courses. So I hope you enjoy the fruits of my labour!
Really, it could just be that there were very few ways to eat an ice lolly without seeming inappropriate to onlookers. Sherlock didn't really chomp down on anything when eating, and it would be cold on the gums to bite it anyway.
"That's just on special occasions then," John said, with a smile that made the corners of his eyes crinkle in a way that made Sherlock’s heart jump.
Sherlock took his chance and nuzzled his head into John's neck. John's hand left his shoulder and slid into his hair, stroking gently. Sherlock made a sound remarkably like a purr and pushed up into John's hand. His scalp tingled.
John got up and went to the bathroom to start her nighttime routine, but Sherlock stayed where they were on the floor on their stomach. John liked their hair. Sherlock knew it was unfair to be angry at John for complimenting their hair when Sherlock had never mentioned to John how much they absolutely hated having long hair. But there it was, just the same. They almost felt betrayed.
Gladstone was actually pawing at the door, impatient for John to finish dressing. She was used to action, and soldiers flinging their clothes on as fast as possible. This dawdling was getting in the way of breakfast, as far as she was concerned.
Gladstone immediately rushed up and jumped the bar counter, knocked McTavish clear off his feet. John grabbed Sherlock's arm and dragged him out the door, Gladstone close behind them. She hadn't actually hurt McTavish, although getting knocked over by a seventy pound animal was terrifying enough. They ran as fast as they could, and it wasn't until they were several blocks away that John realized he still had Sherlock's sleeve clenched in his hand.
John smiled and took another bite of his sandwich. Trust Sherlock to be too embarrassed about it to make up a story like he usually did when Lestrade's things went missing and he was to blame.
The night that Sherlock called John with something like panic in his voice, John knew that there was something horribly wrong. There was a bit of a high-pitched whine behind his words, something that John had never heard before.
Sherlock nodded and frowned. That didn’t help them much, and he really should have considered that the tire marks would belong to Mr. Fielding. After all, it had been Mr. Fielding who had lead them to the warehouse in the first place. Back to square one again.
They finished off the half bottle that was left while sleepily entwined, and once that was done, Sherlock snuggled down into the sheets and pulled John against him.
Sherlock could barely register that it was really John that was kissing them, and it was so surprising that Sherlock wasn't entirely certain what to do about it. They hadn't done much kissing, and having Victor Trevor attempt to steal one didn't really count as far as they were concerned.
“Without you, Sherlock would never have escaped either,” said Mycroft. “I'll deal with the matter. Not to worry.”
“I think that was mentioned, yeah, but Mycroft was mostly concerned about you,” said John. “He wants to turn you into a human again.”
They got another cab to St. Bart's, Sherlock parting the crowded street with ease and John following after him. Lestrade was waiting in the hospital foyer for them, and he began talking as they all made their way to the lift.
Baker Street arrived far too soon, and Sherlock reluctantly pulled himself away from John and struggled out of the cab.
Sherlock knew what he was doing and folded himself so that his knees were up near his ears. His legs were spread, and John could see everything, his half-hard cock, his cute bollocks, and his arse, still red from his earlier punishment.
Sherlock had heard the word "machine" used to describe his brain many times. It wasn't a novel idea, and the very same word had been used on Sherlock himself. Something about the complexity of his mind scared people and they attributed his seemingly super-human attention to detail as non-human.
“I have to, it's a matter of great importance,” said the Captain. “I can't really explain further...”
What if bed-sharing was okay when there was an actual reason for it besides "Sherlock enjoys sleeping next to you, and sharing your body heat, and being surrounded by your scent, and feeling safe and happy?"
John and Greg wandered into the nearby forest with the dog on a lead. The dog had immediately started pulling them in a certain direction, and it seemed to correlate with the direction that the amulet wanted them to go.
Sherlock needed John. Of course he needed him, every moment of every day, and that was just the truth of the matter. He hadn’t been able to actually say it, not even back when he was able to speak properly.
"Excellent, John," Sherlock said. "I was hoping you would show up and I wouldn't have to send Wiggins for you."
Sherlock tried to tell John that his repeated actions of dating insipid women would only end in tragedy, but what he said was, "The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind."
"You haven't told me what they are yet, but I imagine not," John said, smiling over the rim of his tea mug.
"Careful," said Posh Bloke, and slipped onto the barstool beside him. "I see you recognize our friend the bartender."
"I chose it for myself, I know," Sherlock said. "Didn't make it less bad, you know. How do you think I know Wiggins, John? I made it back out, and I didn't do it by myself."
They stared into the mirror in growing despair, because no matter how they tried to fix it, they only made it worse.
A case comes Sherlock's way which necessitates him to pretend to be a couple with John. What will happen next?
“It’s true, but Malcolm’s husband Xavier is a local lad. You know, I see him in town quite often. More often than I thought I’d see someone who generally lives in London.”
Much later, Sherlock was playing his violin, and John came back. The snow outside had turned to slush, and it had made the bottoms of John's trousers sodden and dirty. As Sherlock had predicted, John was grumpy from having extra patients. All of the glittering snow had melted, leaving London a soupy mess.
Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes, but there was nothing else to do. Lestrade went down first, and John had to bite his lip from automatically barking out an order to go faster. He was used to people moving faster than this in emergency situations. But this was not his jurisdiction, not really.
It was an ordinary start to the day, and John hummed contentedly as he made himself and his still-sleeping lover some tea. He hardly paid any attention as Sherlock shuffled into the living room, wrapped up in only a white sheet. He made their cups up and brought them over to the table only to find that Sherlock had left him a present on top of his morning newspaper.
Sherlock's fingers speared through the hair on John's chest, and Sherlock nuzzled his nose into the crease of John's neck, smelling the thick alpha pheromones there.
“I can fly us there, but then I have to hide while you go into the town,” said Sherlock. “You'd be alone.”
Everything seemed magnified. I could smell John’s musky scent underneath lemony laundry soap and cheap 3-in-1 shampoo. I could feel John’s breath on my collarbone, and the subtle rise and fall of his chest against mine. I licked my lips nervously and closed my eyes, trying to get my bodily reactions back under control.
He had his neighbourhood, and didn't stray far from it. Most didn't, once they were settled. He knew a few of the others well enough.
It was a soft look, a look that dislodged butterflies from the lining of his stomach. Sherlock took another sip of wine to quench his suddenly dry mouth. They hadn’t even said anything yet, just looked at one another across the table, faces lit by the softer, warmer candlelight.
He was so angry, he marched down the street without realizing that Gladstone had bounded after him in pursuit. He walked for a long time, without seeing anything around him, he was just so angry, the hot rage burning in his chest like heart-burn.
And then promptly whined as John wrapped his lips around Sherlock's cock and bobbed his head up and down, licking at the underside and rubbing at that soft spot behind his balls. He made a soft, desperate noise when John drew away, and went back to his design.
Lestrade and Sherlock eventually managed to snipe at each other long enough that they reached some sort of agreement. Sherlock agreed he would come look at the crime scene as long as he could bring his own assistant, and Lestrade agreed he would keep Anderson (whoever that was) off the case, but made no promises about Donovan (even more mysteriously).
Sherlock snorted. "Don't be silly, Lestrade. John obviously doesn't do any drugs. First off, he's a doctor. Second, you know the signs of addiction as well as I do, and John is perfectly clean. John sometimes helped street addicts with problems like overdoses and infections."
Sherlock complied shakily and immediately constricted his ankles as John licked a line of wet heat up the underside of his cock. He whined and arched his back, heels digging into John’s back, but not letting go. He was all at once completely engulfed in John’s mouth, and at the first hint of suction, Sherlock keened loudly and stuffed his hand over his mouth, biting the fleshy part of his palm.
“Maybe for once I’ll have a girlfriend who sticks around for a while,” John said, and laughed. “I warned her that we might have a case that interrupts a date once in a while, and you know what she said?”
Sherlock woke to the image of falling snow going past his window. He rose groggily, wrapped up in his sheet, and went into the living room.
It made sense to him. This case was interesting, and in the very end, John had appeared striking while wielding his Sig with precision. Somehow, he found himself drawing John holding his gun up and glaring down the barrel at their suspect. Sherlock almost put it away with the rest of the drawings. Instead, he secreted it away.
“Not too bad for a bone-headed knight, right?” John said, grinning. His face fell a second later. “There's almost nothing that way. A small road, sparsely travelled heads that direction, and there's a distant settlement... on the edge of the Wasting Sea.”
John and I entered the hotel lobby, and there was one person at the front desk. I had a few questions, but I had to decide where to start.
He couldn't go out there. Holmes had made him look like one of them, had taken away his street identity with his dirty clothes, long hair, and beard. He couldn't go back on the street like this, he would die. He didn't even know where his shoes wet, and his bare feet could feel the scritch of gravel beneath his soles.
He moped around the flat, glared at the dishes in the sink and the cockroaches scuttling across the cracked linoleum and eventually went out onto the balcony in a fit of pique, digging out a carton of cigarettes.
For a moment, Sherlock lost all the breath in his lungs and couldn’t think of anything to say. He knew his mouth had fallen open and hastily shut it, swallowing hard. John was all golden skin and solid muscle, obviously from playing rugby. He had more hair on his chest than Sherlock, and Sherlock wanted to bury his fingers in it. His cock jutted up, flushed a deep red, hard and resting against his abdomen.
Before I could say a word, the rattle of the front door stopped me. My eyes widened again and John grimaced in dismay. We had spent so long trying to sort ourselves out that someone had come back and was at the door. I felt my heart drop. I had been so close to confessing, and I had been thwarted. Would I never get the chance to tell John how I felt?
"I can't believe you nearly made me get married over a trading debt," Sherlock snorted, and a tiny lick of flames curled out over his snout.
Sherlock had been floating on air ever since the previous day. It almost felt like a dream to him, and he didn't generally believe in miracles, but this certainly felt like one. Sherlock was afraid this air of uncertain joy would shatter at any moment.
They flew on over the deadly, frothing waves, while in the distance, a huge island rose up in front of them, backlit by the setting sun.
Logically, he knew that he needed to rehabilitate, go to therapy, find his old friends and reconnect, get a job. Doctor John Watson knew these things, remembered them, but Captain John Watson couldn't bring himself to do any of them.
The field hospital made two more appearances, as did the back of a med-evac jeep. He must be delirious, because he swore that there was a warm presence curled up beside him on the way.
John cursed, then reached in between them to wrap his hand around them both. Sherlock lost himself, everything narrowing down to that aching place between his legs that was begging for John to touch it. He panted, unable to do anything except lie back and take what John gave him.
"Are you?" John asked, and purposefully breathed hot air over his cock again. "Can you prove what a good boy you are... Sherlock?"
John pressed him back against the door with his whole body. His hands found their way underneath his coat and pulled his shirttails out of his trousers. Warm hands caressed his hipbones, and Sherlock lifted up a hand to put it over his mouth, stifling the sounds spilling from his lips.
It was the only song he could think of to sing, so he started it again, and again once he'd finished it one time through. Eventually, John started to relax. Something must have penetrated his fog of sleep, because he woke groggily and blinked over at Sherlock sitting next to him.
Before John could react, he escaped out the door to the bathroom. John chuckled again and picked up the handcuffs from the floor. Who knew something this good could come from Sherlock's mad experiments and a little bit of borrowing of police property?
Sherlock made a surprised sound as John pressed his mouth to the corner of Sherlocks and hummed in pleasure as John's lips found his.
In truth, he was not just angry about being abandoned, but about being abandoned for yet another insipid woman who he would date for a few days or maybe even a week and then blame Sherlock when their dates were interrupted too often. Unfortunately, Chantelle was a nurse, so her profession might lend her extra points with John.
Sherlock went and flopped down on his bed. The sheets were soaked with his sweat and omega secretions, but Sherlock didn't bother changing them. It was only going to get dirty again.
They hated it. Every single time they went in to get a trim, Sherlock felt the overwhelming urge to just tell them to cut it all off, to give them a buzz cut even, just to get rid of it all. The hair felt like shackles, tying them to femininity.
Sherlock found a ring one day, hidden in John's sock drawer. It wasn't an elaborate ring. It was a plain gold band, quite heavy, and polished until gleaming bright. It didn't have an inscription.
"The breathing instruments inspire, wake into voice each silent string, and sweep the sounding lyre! In a sadly-pleasing strain," he said to himself, because no one was there to hear him talking in such strange verse.
John wandered over to the other side of the room. He smiled and exclaimed, "Chantelle!" into the mobile, beaming.
His phone was on the bedside table, and he backed up to get a wide shot of Sherlock that fit all of the bondage work done on him, then came closer to take close-ups of the knots he'd used. He brought the phone down next to Sherlock's face and flicked through them.
With a lot of grumbling regarding physical labour, Sherlock managed to move one of the rocks, and soon both he and Molly were free of the castle and in the air.
No one could take that from him. No matter where he was in the world, he was still Doctor Watson, and he could still help people, even the invisible citizens of the London underbelly. Especially them.
I didn’t say anything, but I did relax back into his embrace. This was fine. He was my safety net. He knew almost everything about me. The only thing he didn’t know was that I loved him. There was no danger here in him discovering that. It was simply his doctorly response to my nightmares.
Morning seemed to take forever to come, but finally, it was light enough to constitute morning. John woke up and began preparing for his shift at the clinic. He seemed surprised to see Sherlock awake at that hour.
It was an embarrassingly short time later that he was writhing mindlessly on the bed, tugging at John’s hand to try and warn him of Sherlock’s impending orgasm.
"Please, John, I was just trying to figure out if I could tie these knots properly," Sherlock grumbled. "There, you can look again."
“I’m sure they’ll fix it eventually,” Sherlock said, without holding out any real hope for such an event.
The first thing that Sherlock saw that morning was John, who was sporting a hideous monstrosity, and he didn't bother to hold back his greeting of, "What on Earth are you wearing?"
This is what he’d been hoping for last night, before they’d been interrupted by that thrice-damned fire alarm. He didn’t know what he would do if his hopes were dashed this time. Probably implode.
John put his phone down and immediately turned around. Sherlock was in trouble, and he had to go help. He would have been a bit annoyed with the interruption, but this was something of an emergency. Not only that, but it gave him an excuse to go back.
John's forehead wrinkled, and he asked, "Are you quoting Shakespeare or something? I didn't think you knew any Shakespeare."
Now, he switched it up. Sometimes, he would only lightly slap Sherlock, and others he would hit as hard as he dared. He tried to keep the strength behind his hits patternless, and sometimes he would hit in quick succession, and other times draw it out between hits.
“You looked disappointed,” John said, stroking a soothing hand up his back. “Don’t be. Just because we were interrupted, it doesn’t mean it was our only chance.”
Sherlock did, pushing outward to test if he could unbend his leg, but the tie did hold, as John had promised it would.
Sherlock's fingers found the short hair at the nape of John's neck and pulled. John growled against Sherlock's throat and nipped at it. Sherlock mewled and melted back against the bed.
There weren’t too many ways Sherlock could interpret that, and most of them were very suggestive of interest in some sort of relationship.
Sherlock still avoided Victor Trevor to this day. They had met him in their chemistry lab in first year, and he had seemed like a fairly intelligent person. In the very least, he hadn't caused Sherlock any problems with their lab, which was a minor miracle considering the rest of their peers in the program. Sherlock had found him tolerable enough, and agreed to study with him after school. Little did Sherlock know, but Trevor was still a typical university student in that getting laid was one of his primary objectives. He had made a move on them the first night of studying, and Sherlock had been so upset that they'd left his flat altogether. Sherlock had stopped talking to him after that.
Sherlock almost cringed at the word. He hated it when John called him 'mate.' It almost seemed like John was distancing himself from Sherlock by calling him that.
“What do you mean you don’t know where they went?” asked Malcolm sharply, but I hardly registered that this might be a bad situation.
"No evidence of spinal fractures," John said. "There's only one way to get him out anyway, so I suggest we do it quickly. He's not going to last much longer in these conditions."
"Do you think she'd be able to help if you did let her in on your suspicions?" John asked, running his fingers over Sherlock's hipbone.
He was so obvious. Came from a middle class family. Had two family members with drinking problems, one of whom was about his age - probably a sibling. Played rugby in his teenage years, possibly even his undergraduate years. Was studying to become a doctor.
The mulled wine was good, but Sherlock couldn't help but think that John's lips, an inch from his own, would have tasted far better.
Sherlock shook his head and threw his hands up in the air. He couldn't even properly communicate his frustration, and how John was letting him down with this.
His cock was already beginning to stir against the front of his jeans. He palmed himself briefly through the rough fabric, then got up out of his seat and tested the swish-crack of the crop against his hand again. No, it wouldn't break the skin, but how it would sting against Sherlock's skin.
"Perhaps not," Sherlock said, running over to the stairs and popping his head out of the trapdoor. "Let's see if it has a corresponding tap."
They had always suspected that Mycroft knew more than he was letting on. Sherlock hadn't told anyone anything about their gender identity problems, not about their pronouns, not about the dysphoria, not about anything. But their brother was harder to fool than most people, because he wasn't looking for "normal" things, and Sherlock's genderfluidity wasn't normal at all.
"If music be the food of love, play on!" Sherlock shouted in rapture, not seeing that John had opened the door and was standing at the entrance to 221b.
“That’s fine, no one does,” John said, crouching to look under a bush. “But they all really happened. Not that you’d care.”
This is what it came down to: he had to question Mr. Fielding somehow, and that meant researching how to communicate even if both of them had the same impediment. He couldn’t give up over a minor inconvenience.
"Captain John Watson, 5th Northumberland Fusiliers," Sherlock said proudly, as if knowing John were some sort of great honour.
"Oh!" Sherlock threw his head back against the pillow, legs twitching as John pressed in slowly but firmly.
As John was looking up, he noticed a strange shape in the clouds. It was large and black, and he would have said it was a bird, but it seemed rather too large to be a bird. John frowned and took out a brass telescope from the bag hanging from his belt. But by the time he had gotten the scope to his eye, it was too late. The shape had disappeared.
Sherlock approached the bed, but didn't move within arm's reach. He could leap backwards if necessary. John would feel even more terrible if he woke up to find he'd harmed Sherlock accidentally, even in sleep.
"I have to wake you up in two hours to reassess your condition," John said. "Since I hate tromping up and down the stairs at night, I'm just going to stay here and read while you sleep."
John was immediately hard, as if a switch had been turned on. John groaned and thudded his head against the door. It took all of his control not to try and break the door down again. Sherlock must have heard the thump, because there was an answering thump from the other side.
"And you, here!" Sherlock said, putting his hands in the flour on the counter and pressing them to John's jumper.
John drank and scowled back at him. "Unfair! Just because my first girlfriend had never slept with anyone before."
John didn't want to be reassured. Grim reality was what he knew, and John knew damn well that sometimes things went wrong, and they couldn't be fixed. Knew it as he walked the streets of London by flitting through back alleyways and across empty lots rather than brave the crowded boulevards filled with people. Knew it as his dogtags clinked together as he walked, knew it as Bill Murray's dog followed him everywhere – his only by default.
First one in the bullseye. Second, third... fourth was outside the bullseye. Sherlock took a sip of his drink, as per the rules, and steadied himself for his last shot at the board.
They had tried to even it out, first just by sight, looking at it like a sculpture of sorts. However, no matter what bit they cut off, all it did was make it uneven in a different way. Now, instead of only having a slightly uneven cut, it was uneven in every way possible, especially the back.
And then, Gladstone rushed off, rounded the end of the bar and went behind. John followed, frowning as he watched her start pawing at the rubber mat underneath her feet. It was one of those ones bar owners put down for traction behind the bar. John lifted it up and found that there was a trapdoor, probably to a cellar underneath to store barrels to feed beer up to the taps.
There was one thing they did know about John, and that was that she never stayed the night with a one-night stand. And here she was with Sherlock, still asleep, one arm draped around Sherlock's waist and the other pillowing Sherlock's head. She smelled soft and somehow warm, nestled up against Sherlock's side. She was still asleep, and Sherlock was tempted to simply watch her for most of the day, just lying there, breathing.
"One of us says a word, and the other says the first word that pops into their head," John says. "We can go back and forth. We should try and go as fast as possible and see where we end up."
"Dehydrated, becoming hypothermic," John said. "Malnourished and probably going through withdrawal."
That didn’t exactly make me feel better, but I got ready for bed and climbed in first, edging as far away from John as possible.
John dug around the boxes until he located his kettle and his tea, then put the kettle on the empty counter. Sherlock fidgeted while they waited for the kettle to boil.
Sherlock's heart fell. Would John use being drunk as an excuse to not talk about what had happened last night? Then again, Sherlock could use it as an excuse not to talk about the scars. He didn't want to open that memory again, and dragging it up would probably trigger unfortunate reactions. He'd managed to pack it all away, but it was waiting there in the back of his mind.
John laughed. "That was just the stag night. Don't worry, I don't want to wake up in the drunk tank again tomorrow morning."
"John, I'm a man who has retained his sexual innocence to his third decade. I think you can safely say that this is not about sex," Sherlock said dryly.
"I don't have to prove it," Sherlock snapped. "I'm an excellent actor. It's John you have to worry about. He's terrible at acting."
“Guess I should have clarified,” John said. “I do like you, Sherlock. A lot. I want to keep doing this for a long time.”
knew that it wasn't generally advised to imply insult to a bunch of already-enraged thugs. What was wrong with his mouth?
John still didn't know what was expected of him, so he simply shrugged and dug into his breakfast. It was a proper fry up, and he wasn't certain that, after all this time of half-starvation, he'd even be able to finish it. Once he'd gulped the majority of it down, he looked at Sherlock, wondering what he could be thinking.
He should have known that no sooner had he opened the door to 221b then he would be whisked away back out into the streets of London, without even a breather to put his briefcase down.
“Come on, you,” John said, and he smiled so softly, that for a moment Sherlock was certain that he was still dreaming.
When he looked out the window, he was sad to see it wasn't John. It looked like a client. Sherlock should really put up a sign on the door to not disturb him.
Sherlock sulked and John hummed as they walked. Sherlock would have said something impatient, but John just smiled and tugged his arm. After a while, Sherlock had to admit, it was calming to walk through this quiet garden, and the flowers did smell lovely.
The beverages were poured, and Sherlock sipped at it, the sweet spiced beverage warming him up inside. They shared a careful silence.
"Yes, I want to look in the mirror, but obviously I can't do that, so a photo is the next best option," Sherlock said.
He mused that it was sort of like being a present, and that presents must be very lucky if being wrapped up in this fashion made them as special as Sherlock felt. How silly of him, musing on the emotional properties of inanimate objects.
paying attention after all. Sherlock shifted closer again with more purpose, until a line of warmth from John's close proximity burned up his side.
They had both been rather more honest than first intended. Sherlock looked down at his folded hands, avoiding John's eyes. Mycroft had implied to John at one point that Sherlock was a virgin, and back then, John had dismissed this information as ridiculous. Reaching the age of 32 as a virgin was almost unheard of, and among their age group at least, seen as something to be embarrassed by.
John divested him of his trousers so quickly, Sherlock wasn’t sure how he’d done it. He palmed Sherlock’s cock through his pants and Sherlock whined, rolling his hips up. John growled against his throat and kicked his legs further apart. Sherlock trembled and waited as John’s fingers brushed over the inside of his thigh, teasing him with soft passes of his fingers.
"Rubbing alcohol isn't meant for human consumption," John retorted bluntly. "It's made of a different type of alcohol than spirits. I really hope you're not drinking this, it could do major damage to your central nervous system."
“You’re treating me like…” John said, and then his voice trailed off. “Never mind. It’s obvious you don’t need me to interfere in your case. It’s all up to you and your brilliant deductions.”
“He could be anywhere,” Malcolm said. “I don’t doubt that he’d understand the situation, given a chance. But I’d rather not give hime the chance.”
Sherlock really had not good explanation for why they had suddenly chopped off the majority of their hair. Most of if wasn't going to fit in a hair tie anymore, because the more they tried to even it out, the shorter and more lop-sided it got.
, John. You were happy. I wouldn't have interfered with that, no matter what my feelings were on the matter. John, I... I – "
"I wanted a softer alternative anyway," John said. "I didn't much like the cuts on your wrists after last time."
“Ugh, and she was going to get me a book in order to try and break the spell,” said Sherlock. “I can’t just figure everything out on my own.”
John knew from looking at the website that the resort usually had a dark green and brown theme, but for the weekend, it was done up in lush red and white. Sherlock hid his distaste until the door closed, but he immediately took his hand out of John's and looked around in disdain. John would rather the green and brown himself, but he wasn't nearly so offended as Sherlock by the colours.
It took ages for the building manager and the fire crew to sort out what happened, and by that time, Sherlock was feeling sleepy. John lead him back to John’s flat, gave him a spare pair of boxers and a t-shirt, and tucked him into bed, clambering in after him. Sherlock smiled drowsily and hummed in satisfaction as John wrapped his arms around him. It was warm and secure, and absolutely the best feeling in the world, to drift asleep with John’s arms cradling him.
"There were markings on the wall!" came another voice, and a man, presumably Anderson joined them on site.
Sherlock picked up the basket and quickly closed the door. The snap of the bolt being thrown back across the door could be heard across the street. John sighed and left for home once more.
"And you've a got a bit of flour just – here!" John said, running a white flour-covered finger over his cheekbone.
Or rather, when one was lying immobile on the ground bleeding out, one would take what one could get.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the worn-out blue striped pyjama bottoms and the ragged t-shirt and said, "For the purpose of sleeping, I suppose."
Sherlock didn't know where this was going. It was easy to say he wanted them to stay together for life, but what did that mean? They already lived together, paid the bills together, solved cases together, and had fun together. Sherlock wondered if maybe that meant they would begin to sleep together, move into one room together, or even perhaps make love together.
It was necessary, however, to put up with all these annoyances until he’d finished his MSc in Chemistry and could go on his way.
I froze for just a second, just long enough for Mycroft's eye to twitch. He knew what I was thinking, and I hated him for it. I glared at him.
John went to step through and came to a sudden halt at the sight of another man already in the room. He was tall, with greying hair, and an easy-going air. He frowned at John's appearance and John frowned right back.
Sherlock perused the ring and decided that he might as well look it over with a microscope and see if he could find anything else out about it. Such as, why was it in John's sock drawer, of all places? And if John was trying to keep it hidden, why had he chosen such an obvious place?
Sherlock huffed and let John get to work, trying to keep their breathing even. Eventually, their heart stopped beating so hard, and they began to feel drowsy and relaxed. They hardly noticed as John's fingers began massaging the back of their neck.
John fluttered a kiss over Sherlock's pink, furled hole and Sherlock bucked and whined. Holding him still with his hands, John kissed him again more firmly and mouthed against it, his heated breath making Sherlock shudder.
He had been so distracted that he hadn't even realized that someone had come into Baker street and left him a flash drive. Mycroft's people were getting better at leaving no trace of their passage, and Sherlock ruefully stopped his study of how flame-resistant nail clippings were and went to get John's computer. This was far more important. The sooner he got his voice back, the sooner he could use his usually impressive skills of deduction to drive Chantelle away.
John left his room, and Sherlock could hear him rummaging around upstairs, getting changed and ready for bed. Sherlock's head still hurt, and he knew that a person with a concussion was supposed to rest as much as possible to help with the recovery process. John had work tomorrow, so Sherlock resigned himself to a long, boring day of nothing the next day. He sighed and put his head down on the pillow. Sleep came surprisingly quickly.
John was generally accepting of the strangest things, even Sherlock's oddities, but Sherlock still didn't know how she would react to Sherlock's gender identity.
"An island," Sherlock said. "In the middle of the Wasting Sea. I daresay if anyone manages to reach us there, they rather deserve to find us."
He hurried, because the book told him not to leave someone tied up by himself. As he remembered from earlier, there were some apples in the fridge. And cheese – proper aged Cheddar, not that weird squidgy stuff Americans liked to buy.
"Head injuries bleed a lot. Where's John?" Sherlock went to stand, and the whole world swirled around him.
But how Sherlock wanted that, to be sometimes mistaken for a man, to have people treat her like one, and above all, she wished she had John's short hair. John had a pixie cut, and Sherlock knew it was a girls' short haircut, but what Sherlock wouldn't give for short hair!
"Don't be daft, Sherlock, I can tell when someone's avoiding me," John said. "You haven't just been avoiding the flat, but you've been avoiding looking at me or talking to me. What's this all about, Sherlock?"
“Yes, I figure that we’re safe to search the room now,” he said. “But that’s not what we should be talking about right now, is it.”
The pub wasn't too crowded, and Lestrade and Donovan were there with a few other Yarders. Sherlock estimated that they were already into their second round, and a couple had already gotten to their third or fourth. Lestrade raised a pint glass at their approach.
He'd won, somehow. Out of the two of them, he'd won John Watson. It wasn't what he'd imagined, especially when he'd stood up at their wedding and given that speech.
"You might not be wrong, John," Sherlock said. "Someone tampered with this latch – it won't close properly."
"I've got some bourbon we should finish off," John said. "Up in the cupboard. You go get that and some glasses, and I'll get the first aid kit."
"Of course," Sherlock said, almost groaning in dismay that there was a vest underneath the jumper. Why did John have to dress in so many layers?
"Gladstone is a service dog," John said slowly. "Is there any way to get underneath this butcher shop? A trap door, walk space, anything?"
There was a suspect at staying at the resort we were going to whom the police suspected of being a serial killer for several reasons. There was a whole separate sub-folder with various evidence pointing towards this man as the killer. However, there was no solid evidence tying him to the murders yet, only suspicion.
"Yes, ha ha, how funny," Sherlock replied bitterly. "Of course you're not my girlfriend. What a hilarious notion! Why would anyone, but especially John Watson, want to date Sherlock?"
"This is before Mary ever entered the picture," John said. "I've l-liked you since almost the very start, but I didn't always accept that that's what I was feeling. I was in denial."
John got a determined look on his face, and Sherlock pointedly put his hand in a pile of flour. This was war.
John must have thought the dazed look on his face was negative, because he hurriedly said, “Sorry, I thought that you might want… I’ll just... “
"Indeed," Lestrade said. "We think we know which person he was targeting, so we've told this... this..." Lestrade reached for a file on the desk and drew out a sheaf of papers to look at a name. "Benedict Cumberbatch about his peril and asked that he keep his reservation so that we can send in an undercover team."
John’s mouth closed over a nipple and sucked. Sherlock, completely unprepared for the shock of warm arousal that shot through him at the sensation, gasped and tilted his head back. His fingers clenched in John’s hair and he panted as John lapped and sucked at the raised, puckered flesh until Sherlock was writhing underneath him on the couch.
"You're welcome to him," one of them said, shooting him a glare before they shut the ambulance and left.
I took another shaky breath, but stayed where I was. I had to listen to this conversation, and moving was too risky at the moment.
John was already pulling on his coat and getting his shoes back on. He was clearly raring to go, even if it was only down to the NSY building. Just spending time in the monotony of ordinary life was apparently grating on John. This was why John always came when Sherlock said there was a case. Because in those moments, he was anything but ordinary.
“Oh, Malcolm Alexander,” she said. She looked around, before leaning in. “Just between you and me, he’s actually here this weekend!”
Once they got him up, the ambulance attendants took charge of him and whisked him off to the nearest hospital, which was St. Bart's. John shook his head. He could hardly believe that this was the type of thing Sherlock had to deal with on a regular basis.
Mr. Fielding looked disappointed that Sherlock had not yet solved the mystery, but he also didn't send Sherlock away, so there was that. Sherlock got a blank piece of paper out of his pocket and drew a van on it as best he could. Mr. Fielding watched with interest, and Sherlock pointed at him. Mr. Fielding looked surprised, and patted his own chest. Sherlock nodded. Sherlock got out the map again and pointed at the place where the warehouse was located, then pointed at the van again.
They both trooped over to the sofa and put the plates in their laps. John flicked on the telly, and immediately made a disparaging comment about one of the characters on the screen. Sherlock laughed, and he felt himself settle into the moment, like he belonged in it, here with John.
As they made their way home, Sherlock said, "You know, John, I don't think I'm much one for doing the tying."
John downed his pint, but before he could fork out the cash to pay, Posh Bloke flung down ten quid on the counter, and tugged him away. Since the bartender didn't even notice them leave, John felt a bit better about not paying himself.
It was Christmas morning, and although Sherlock hadn't expected it, John had responded well to Sherlock's hesitant hand underneath his shirt. One thing led to another, and here they were.
John moved around the dorm outside, clinking dishes, turning on the kettle, sitting on the couch. Sherlock lay on the bed listening to her and waiting for John to go to bed. Sherlock still hadn't figured out what they were supposed to do about the hair situation. The future looked a bit bleak to them, and they could only hope that Mycroft with his mysterious powers of knowing things he shouldn't had not seen Sherlock's mad dash back to their room with a shorn head.
John pulled him through to the bedroom, pushing him up against the door with his weight. Sherlock leaned back and let him do as he pleased. He felt a bit like an accidental passenger that had gotten swept away for a ride on the back of a wild horse. All he could do was hang on tight.
"You came back, you berk," John said. "You came back, and suddenly, I had two people that I felt strongly about in my life. I couldn't keep you both, that's not how this works for me."
It was a bit of a low blow, I admit, but he was getting too close to the truth of the matter, and he didn’t need to know about the torture. Of all people, he shouldn’t know. Just like I’d hidden the reason behind my disappearance, never told him why I’d left, never told him of what I’d endured on his behalf. If he knew that it hadn’t been just a grand adventure abroad, what I’d done for him... he’d know. He may be a little dense when it comes to this matter, but even he could figure it out from there.
Normal was drinking tea, and crosswords, and crap telly on Sundays. Sherlock wanted more than anything in the world that he could get that back, to return to the days where they could collapse against the wall in the hallway and giggle after a case. But that just wasn't a realistic expectation. Not anymore. The two of them had too many scars now.
"I didn't think so," Sherlock said. "Well, now that you know what's going on, you should go away and let me get through this on my own."
There was something different about this nightmare. Sherlock had woken John from countless nightmares after they had first met. But none of those instances compared to what he was listening to now.
John pressed Sherlock’s ankles back until they could rest on his shoulders, and Sherlock moaned brokenly as John sank into him even deeper. And as John began to thrust again, the change in angle caused him to brush Sherlock’s prostate.
John frowned uncomfortably. There was a truth to that which he hadn't really thought about in the thrill of actually interacting with the world again.
"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter," Sherlock replied snarkily, not caring if it sounded weird to her.
"You don't have to worry she'll ever do anything to hurt anyone or get in the way," John said quickly. "She's a well-trained service dog. She saw combat in Afghanistan – nothing rattles her."
Once he got up to Lestrade's office, he found that Sherlock had already abandoned him for the evidence room.
Then, John climbed into one side of the bed (Sherlock's mind shied away from calling it "his" side, as it implied that Sherlock had a "side" in John's bed), turned over, and sighed as he settled in for the night.
"It's okay," John said. "Like I said, we can go and get it cut in the morning. I'll go with you. We can get it cut however you like."
John left the room to go find the bag of shopping he'd gotten earlier. He had decided on going to the sex shop from the case, the one that had started this entire venture. It seemed fitting. He wasn't going to use everything he'd bought just yet. But Sherlock didn't have to know that.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said awkwardly as he tried to figure out if John wanted him to just leave now that he’d been patched up.
Gentle fingers under his chin lifted his eyes up to John’s, and John looked at him seriously. Neither of them said a word, caught up in the other’s gaze. Sherlock’s heart was rocketing furiously, the pulse of his blood so close to the pads of John’s fingers.
"Hateful," Sherlock muttered, looking out the window, but nothing he said or did would change the fact that a few measly inches of snow had brought London to a standstill.
They gave up on fixing it themself for the moment, since they were only making it worse. They had to think of how to fix this – not just the hair, although that was the main priority – but how to explain to everyone else what they had done.
As the two of them walked along the street hand-in-hand, Sherlock still couldn't shake the feeling that this was a dream.
"All's Mycroft that ends Mycroft," John chortled in return. "Okay, since we've ended up with both myself and Mycroft, maybe we should start with Lestrade."
Sherlock went, and John rushed up the stairs, stripping faster than he had ever stripped in his life. He rummaged through the back of his wardrobe upstairs, which is where his army things still were. He hadn't touched these things in years, but they should still fit him.
Sherlock usually only went in there when he was either sleeping or shagging. He obviously wasn't shagging, since John was out here. But John could have sworn he'd slept last night.
Sherlock just shrugged sheepishly and handed her the photo. Luckily, the woman didn't talk much, but she had deft hands. Sherlock felt more and more as if they were gaining freedom the more hair that fell to the ground sheared away. And as that feeling built, their ability to deduce started working again. Or, rather, the anxiety brought on by their gender dysphoria was pushed back enough that their observations could filter through again.
Sherlock had learned nothing, he was simply doing what felt natural to him. But it was still gratifying to hear John's enjoyment of the act was at least equal to his own. He wriggled his tongue back and forth, experimenting. He pulled off to lick just at John's slit, then swallowed him down again.
He lit a paraffin candle, testing it on the skin of his wrist for temperature. He'd researched this on the internet and even gone so far as to ask one of the sex shop employees about it. Soft candles melted at a lower temperature, making paraffin the safest for this use.
John smacked him again a moment later, keeping the beats between them in his head like the cadence of marching.
Sherlock got in the door of 221b and immediately dropped all of the bags he had been carrying. Now that they were in the flat, John could deal with the pesky task of wrapping, thanks ever so.
Baker street was intolerable without John there, but Sherlock had nowhere else to be but perhaps the morgue, if Molly would let him in. He couldn't progress in the case without John, but John would insist on remaining at work, even if Sherlock decided to try and drag him away from it.
"Bugger that lot," John said, pulling Sherlock closer against her. "If anyone says anything about it, I'll punch them for you. How does that sound?"
"You were shot though," Sherlock continued. "The presence of the limp suggests that your injury was psychologically traumatic."
After a while, Sherlock felt curiosity rising in him, and a desire to see John in the same state as he had been in. A desire that ached sharply as he considered it.
"No, he's not. Lestrade is waiting for her at the entrance," John said, hands behind his back as he walked.
John sucked on his fingers for a few seconds and then massaged Sherlock's furled hole gently. Sherlock sighed and wrapped one of his legs around John's waist. As soon as John touched him there he went soft and pliant.
This kiss was so different than the one he had shared with Janine. Objectively, Janine's mouth was fuller and softer than John's, but kissing Janine had felt mechanical and void of emotion. Sherlock had calculated every angle of attack, where he should put his hands, what his face should look like when they drew back, John's reaction in the background.
“Great, we’re neighbours, then,” John said, turning to grin at him. “I hope that you don’t find me too annoying.”
John pulled the shirt over their head, and their hair fluffed up with static. John giggled and knocked them back over onto the bed to kiss them again, all over their face. Sherlock turned their face up to receive them, closing their eyes at the soft presses against their cheeks, the tip of their nose, their forehead, and the corner of their slightly parted mouth.
Sherlock stumbled backwards, hands clinging to John's shirtfront. They tumbled back onto the bed as Sherlock's knees hit the edge.
"Nope, wasn't allowed one," John said. "I wanted one. I really wanted an English bulldog, but by the time I got out of school, I'd decided to join the army."
How one person could possibly ruin everything John didn't know, but he was eager to find out what could possibly be in store for him.
“John!” he cried, and thrust upward into John’s mouth one last time before shuddering hard in the throes of climax.
The door banged shut, and John raised his head. He knew that Len was the owner, but the mysterious second voice was no one he knew. Len sure sounded like he was planning some dirty business. He frowned and patted Gladstone's head absent-mindedly.
A gentle snore from my right indicated that John had fallen asleep on my shoulder. I sighed. It seemed to easy for John, so why was it so hard for me? Maybe because my feelings were real. I carefully rested my cheek on top of John’s head and went back to reading the dossier.
He didn't know what to concentrate on, John's mouth tracing his neck with his tongue and teeth, or the fact his erection was pressing into John's hip. The dial on his arousal had jumped from moderate to in-danger-of-combustion, and if they didn't go inside soon, Sherlock feared that their first time together was going to reach its peak right out there on the street.
John brought their head down again, and Sherlock sank into the kiss with a soft noise, hands clutching at the front of John's terrible jumper. They would have far preferred John to wear her rugby jersey. She looked very heroic in it. It was in this moment of distraction that John delved into their mouth, and Sherlock let out a startled moan as their knees buckled.
"Yeah," John said, and then, because Posh Bloke was still looking at him expectantly, he asked, "How did you know?"
wait until tomorrow, and John should know that. But he was too embroiled in his own silly love life to realize that Sherlock's entire wellbeing counted on them solving this case as soon as possible. How could John not realize how important this was?
Sherlock, lying on Mrs. Hudson's couch with his feet in John's lap as they watched telly, didn't notice that the evening was creeping up on them and that eventually John would want to sleep. When John yawned and slowly got to his feet, Sherlock followed him all the way up the stairs to his room, and John didn't protest.
"Oh, that," Sherlock snorted. "I can probaby give a fairly accurate synopsis based on the last episode."
Breakfast done, John dug into her closet and found a large, knitted hat to cover Sherlock's hair with. Sherlock briefly considered skipping the part where they had to go to the hairdressers and just wear a hat until all the hair grew back. But no, they'd started this by cutting off most of it, they might as well finish the job. They didn't generally like hats, but this was an exceptional circumstance.
Before John could say anything else, there were footsteps in the hallway behind him, and a girl appeared over his shoulder. Sherlock froze in surprise. Something must have shown on his face, because John turned to look too.
I looked at John. What could we do in this situation? If we were discovered, this could be bad for everyone involved. I didn’t particularly want to be shot at close range. Neither did I want to put our case in jeopardy. But if our lives were in danger, what could I do? There was one other option... but I was loathe to get help from anyone.
"There's a Chinese place open till 2 near here," Sherlock said slowly. "They don't mind who comes in, just that they have business. They won't even mind Gladstone."
Secondly, Sherlock didn't like boys and never had. They had struggled to try and find any delight in the male form and in their rough boyish personalities, but they never did find them appealing in the least. On the other hand... Sherlock loved girls. They loved their faces, and their hair, and the way they moved, the way they always smelled so nice. And Sherlock liked one girl in particular, although they were having trouble telling the girl in question.
Mycroft looked at them both quizically, and frowned. "You really must have something wrong with you. You would never imperil the cases."
Sherlock tried to do as requested, but his muscles were trembling too much, and John had to help. Considering the position he wanted Sherlock in, he untied his arms, massaging them carefully. He retied them up in front of him. As he did, John checked his fingers and toes for signs of circulation problems.
Sherlock stared at John in amazement. How had John figured it out from such a useless line of whatever literary nonsense it was he was spouting now?
And the two of them would have stayed there quite happily, making experiments and living peaceful (and unmarried) lives.
John reached up and fastened it around his neck, the doctor in him making sure to check that there was enough room for him to breath easily. Sherlock seemed to puff up once he had the collar on, preening.
"I know you said that I was all you wanted for Christmas, but I got you something anyway," John said.
Eventually, they found a door that was locked from the outside. The bolt cutters were procured once more, and then, they finally found the room below the grate. There was barely any light, and it was damp and chilly. There was no apparent threat. A form on the floor stirred, and John rushed to the side of the prisoner. The figure raised his head, revealing a man with his hands handcuffed behind his back.
Sherlock went over to the table, picked up the second of the monstrosities, took it to the window, opened it, and tossed it out. There was a disgruntled yell from below, before Sherlock shut the window again.
"Yeah, for a price I do!" Wiggins waved his arms. "And if things get hairy, I get out! Cause nobody is going to bail my arse out of jail if I end up there. And no one is going to bail you out either."
"Indeed," Sherlock said, moving to stand. "But now, a shower, I think. I'm drenched in sweat... oh."
But John was already bustling around the kitchen gathering ingredients and throwing them into a large pot.
“Oh thank God,” John said, with a sudden relieved smile. “It seemed like a good idea, but now that the moment is here…”
Sherlock didn't even bother to ask why. John was in full-on Christmas cheer, and not even Sherlock's irritation dampened it. Sherlock collapsed in his chair and waited for the hot cocoa to be delivered to his hand from John.
Sometime in the night, Sherlock had come in, hung a robe on the door, left some slippers by John's bed, and left again. Gladstone hadn't woken him up, so John could only guess whether Gladstone trusted him, or he'd been quiet enough not to wake her. He slipped the slippers on, and with some trepidation, picked up the robe.
John smiled, leaning down to brush a soft kiss over his mouth. Sherlock leaned up, hand coming up to curl around the back of John’s neck, pulling him down. All that warm skin made contact, and Sherlock groaned against John’s mouth as their bodies settled together. Sherlock spread his legs and John slotted in between them, aligning their groins.
John came home to an empty house, which was odd. Sherlock had assured him this morning that he would be here when John returned. John put his briefcase down, toed off his shoes and looked around, just to be sure he hadn't missed him.
"Well, apart from the fact that I'm a medical doctor and have a degree in biochemistry, it also says so right on the bloody label," John snapped, holding it up. "I'm using it for its intended purpose, which is to treat minor topical injuries."
At first, I froze, terrified once again that he would see through my facade and realize how truly vulnerable I was. But then I remembered: John already knew. It was okay.
John put an arm around Gladstone protectively. Gladstone was very conspicuous, and even if someone didn't know about his connection to the break-in, they might report him for having an unleashed dog. And if they arrested John, they would take her away from him. John didn't like to think of what would happen then.
“Yes,” I answered. “Think nothing of it. It's long since revealed itself to be something that will never be mine.”
“Probably wherever Molly went as well,” the dragon sniffed. “I assume this was your attempt to rescue her?”
And then Sherlock remembered the matchbox and the strange golden light. Sherlock immediately discounted magic, because he refused to consider such an unscientific possibility as an answer for what had happened. Perhaps it had hypnotized him into only speaking in Shakespearean quotations? What kind of apparatus would be required for such a thing?
By the time Lestrade got back to the crime scene carrying a paper cup in one hand, most of the officers present were frantically searching for a way down. The grate was far too small to accommodate an adult human person's body, and it was welded shut besides, and had been for a long time.
John half-smiled then. While he did need his arm to hold steady for being a surgeon, he was still qualified to be a GP. He still didn't say anything, wondering what it was that made this strange man tick.
"That was a good afternoon, wasn't it," Molly said. "I'm sure John must be done whatever it was he was doing now. Do you think it was the letter opener?"
Sherlock left the morgue with a bag of fresh ears and some toenails as well. He planned to do nothing but set them on fire at home in revenge for John leaving him by himself when he couldn't talk. Burnt toenails had a very distinct scent, and he hoped John wouldn't forget it anytime soon. That would teach him to abandon Sherlock in the middle of a case.
He still had his Sig. He had somehow managed to keep it with his things, the few items that remained to him. It all fit into the dusty duffel bag, a few worn out pairs of jeans and jumpers. His entire wardrobe could fit into one load at the laundromat. He could see his entire life whirling around behind the glass door, being cleaned and rinsed, however frayed.
The two of them emerged into a clearing where a young woman was facing off with a large naga. The naga, half woman and half snake, had the woman cornered against the face of a cliff. In spite of this, the woman was brandishing a large stick in the naga’s direction.
"I already have photos of my own," Sherlock said. "Anyway, Anderson took them. They're probably crap."
Sherlock approached the other side of the bed with some trepidation. He hadn't had to share a bed anytime in the past three-odd decades of his life. He had no idea how his transport would react in sleep to bed-sharing. Especially with John.
John opened the door, but rather than looking pleased, like Sherlock had planned, his face fell. Sherlock’s heart clenched, and he got the sudden urge to flee. That wasn’t what was supposed to happen.
Sherlock couldn’t roll his eyes because draconic eyes didn’t go all the way around, but he did snort, sending a puff of steam out of his nostrils. “Clearly, you’re here to rescue Princess Molly from my dread clutches.”
John, whose whole body was still too shaky too move much, wasn't so sure. But he was certainly up to the attempt!
At first John thought that it was the ringing in his ears making the unhappy, high-pitched whining noise nearby, but a nudge with a rough, sand-encrusted nose indicated otherwise. John turned his head to find Bill Murray's dog beside him, snout covered in still-wet blood and sand. Bill likely dead then, if the dog was beside him.
John insisted that they have a shower, and Sherlock complied happily. The water pressure in their building left much to be desired, but for once, Sherlock was too distracted and pleased to give it much thought.
It probably wouldn’t have been cold if Sherlock wasn’t naked, and also wasn’t covered in drying sweat from their earlier activities. Still, his ankles and calves were chilly, and the draft was unpleasant.
The murderer also got ahold of an epee, and the two of them circled each other. John sighed and shook his head. Neither of the swords were sharp, each of them tipped with a little button that would do no real damage. John texted Lestrade and awaited back-up.
The murders had not happened at the retreat, but over the course of years at various places in London. There had been nothing solid to connect the cases yet. All the victims had been men, but the age range was broad. Nothing connected them through jobs, hobbies, or any other event. The only reason that Malcolm was suspect was because he’d been in the same hotel as one of the murdered men, and had met him in the hotel bar. He’d had an alibi, but upon being pressed, the alibi had fallen through. Malcolm didn’t know that.
There was nothing for it but to open the door, and to try and school his expression, not give away how defeated he suddenly felt. It mustn’t have worked, because John’s worried face turned even more anxious when he saw Sherlock’s.
He kicked his jeans and pants off onto the floor, then crawled up the bed to undo Sherlock's blindfold. Sherlock blinked at him as John untied his hands, then used the scarves to mop off the mess on Sherlock's stomach.
He hadn't really expected to find anything when looking at it under a microscope. He was just bored, and this was proving to be a nice distraction from the monotony of the time in between cases.
It had happened once or twice after John's stag party. The one that chiefly stood out in his mind was the night that John's divorce was finalized. John had insisted that Sherlock drink, too, and Sherlock, not wanting to reject this invitation of solidarity, had gotten completely plastered. He was still embarrassingly incapable of holding his drink, but at least he hadn't thrown up this time.
Sherlock lay there panting for several minutes, little shivers still running through his body. John waited patiently, even though his cock was throbbing against the zip of his jeans.
"I... liked it," Sherlock said, and he was still so flushed from their activity that John only knew he was embarrassed by the way he dipped his chin down and wouldn't look John in the eye.
John gave him a pointed look. Sherlock scowled in return and took a sip of his bourbon. He accidentally took a larger gulp than he meant to and ended up coughing and sputtering as some of it went down the wrong way.
The naga hissed and relaunched its attack. John tried to back away, but the naga’s tail coiled around him again. John thrust his sword at the naga’s bulging flank, but his sword slid on the rock-hard scales. John would have to get closer to get the naga’s head off.
His jaw began to ache, and he felt tears force their way past his eyelids. The tears weren't from happiness, or from sadness, but simply from the effort he was putting into the act of fellatio. He half-choked on John's cock, and he enjoyed it.
Most people must think that I’m a cold person, a person who doesn’t feel emotions. And I cultivate that idea within people because while I do feel, I actually hate feelings. I have an aversion to feeling every single thing that happens. I don’t like talking about it and I find it excruciating to have any conversation at all that’s related to feelings. I never want people to know that I feel, and feel deeply. It hurts too much.
He began pulling the pyjamas off, revealing that Sherlock hadn't been wearing pants underneath them. John groaned as Sherlock's cock sprung free, red and leaking.
He only had half an hour before John was back from the surgery – forty minutes if he stopped to get a paper and some milk from Tesco on his way home. There were too many bedbugs, and they'd had the entire day to spread out and infest the house.
"I love you," Sherlock blurted without any finesse whatsoever. "Like that song. If this relationship is all I receive this year, I would be satisfied."
He was still drowsing when John moved. At first, he thought that John had grown tired of snuggling and was going to go do something else, such as make tea, or breakfast. But he tugged at Sherlock's shoulders until Sherlock was lying prone on John's bed. Sherlock was momentarily confused, but then John kissed the back of his neck. Sherlock froze.
“This knight is legendary!” said Mycroft. “Surely you have heard of him? Oh, I suppose you would only know the stories.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and said, “I have the tapes that you wanted. Don’t forget, it’s up to you to take Mummy out to the show later this week. Don’t try and skip it.”
“No,” Sherlock said. “We need to think of something else. If only I wasn't a dragon. We could travel around the country in disguise and explore the Seven Realms.”
"Bi... bisexual?" Sherlock asked, mind racing. It wasn't a possibility they had considered, a terrible oversight on their part if that was the case. Why had they just assumed when John had never herself confirmed her heterosexuality? Saying she wasn't gay was one thing which didn't necessarily exclude Sherlock.
"Okay," John said. "I won't stop. Just... will you tell me what I did wrong, Sherlock? Whatever it was, I didn't mean to hurt you, in spite of the fact that I obviously did, somehow. Please just tell me what it was."
Sherlock blushed and turned his coat collar up, hoping that John wouldn't notice. It was dim light, and John wasn't the most observant of people. It was conceivable that John wouldn't see the flush on Sherlock's face.
"Lestrade's crew, I suppose, but we'll be there if I insist hard enough," Sherlock replied. "And I will. Haven't had a case this engaging for ages."
“I guess he misses his home,” said the woman. “I always see him walking along the cliffs overlooking the sea. He likes to go on long day hikes.”
The two of them stared at each other tentatively. Sherlock still wasn't processing the information. Was "darling" something romantic, or could that still be seen as platonic? Sherlock wished he had his (or John's) laptop to look it up, but he couldn't even move. John was still flushed up to his ears, and Sherlock felt rather hot in the face himself.
In answer, John reached over, slid his hand into Sherlock's hair and pulled him into a kiss. He ran his hand down Sherlock's neck and over his shoulder. Sherlock pulled John against him, wishing that he could feel skin-on-skin. He needed to be closer – so much closer than this. He pulled John closer by the waist, could feel his body warm and firm against his own.
It stung quite a bit, and it stung even more as John cleaned it out. Sherlock hissed sharply as John cleared the blood away.
He stripped down quickly, piling his clothes in the middle of the room as far away from anything else as possible. Half of it was because his clothes were filthy and possibly had lice, but the other was that he found an odd-looking experimental contraption set up on the bathroom counter, and didn't want the clothes he might end up wearing again to get contaminated with a potentially biohazardous material.
The movement stirred John, who sleepily buried his face in Sherlock’s shoulder. After a few minutes of satisfied cuddling, Sherlock realized that the vague urgency he felt was actually not the need to use the loo. Not only that, John seemed to have the same problem, and it was poking him in the thigh.
They swirled their coat around their legs as they ran and grinned. Back when they'd first become a couple, Sherlock had bought a long coat and had worn it for years, until it was well worn out. John had bought them this new one for their birthday, and it still smelled new. It was a bit more posh than their last coat, that was for sure.
“Speaking of the plates, they’ve finished running,” Sally said. “Our database says that the license belongs to a Mr. Harry Fielding.”
John tries to settle into 221b, and is immediately swept off on his first case as Sherlock's assistant. John meets the Yarders, they investigate an arson, and Gladstone discovers something.
John Watson looked like an alien, with his short hair, smooth face, and posh silk robe. John didn't know who that man was anymore, and he felt such a strong sense of disassociation that he had to look away again. Whoever he was, the image in the mirror lied. It wasn't him anymore.
After a while of just sitting in John's embrace, Sherlock's eyes were closing. Apparently being anxious for so long was tiring.
My heart pounded against my ribs, and the feeling in my chest ached. I made a rather embarrassing noise against John’s lips and pressed back, eyes sliding shut. John tilted my head slightly, and our mouths slid together more firmly, slotting together like puzzle pieces. I was so intent on kissing him, that I forgot to breathe.
Sherlock watched John walking away, obviously nursing an erection that made him limp ever so slightly and whimpered.
"Good," John said, and brought his hand down on Sherlock's left cheek. It rippled with the impact, and Sherlock whimpered again.
221b Baker street was a neat little place tucked in between another apartment building and a sandwich shop. John frowned, looking up at it. Surely the enigmatic Sherlock Holmes didn't live in a place like this? But it was the only address he had, so he rang the buzzer, and then clenched his arms nervously behind his back as he waited.
His sister offered him a place on her couch, a space to recuperate. He turned it down, and refused the mobile phone she tried to push on him. Alcohol abuse, walking out on her wife – it didn't matter, they were still elements of the everyday that still didn't make sense to him. It was all the same, people going to work, meeting up with friends, petty arguments, traffic jams – it was all the same, ordinary story of a place that no longer fit.
"I've already taken my own advice to heart," John said with a chuckle. "I'm just more used to it than you are."
"I have half a mind to leave you here and just run away by myself!" Molly snapped. "But I need you, and you need me."
John sucking on his collarbone pulled a groan from his throat, and Sherlock vaguely realized his fingers were clenched in John’s shirt.
Sherlock sat in the back of the car Mycroft had come and kidnapped him in with his back to his older brother, arms crossed and staring out the window.
"I don't know who else to call," Sherlock said. "I definitely can't call my brother. But there's also nothing that you can do."
Sherlock came back from class to find a note on his door. He grabbed it off the door with his teeth, carrying too much and not wanting to put any of it down. He scrabbled with his keys, kicked the door open and immediately dropped everything he’d been carrying and took the note out of his mouth.
The party he'd agreed to go to even though it was going to be annoying. What did it matter to Lestrade and Molly whether or not he came to the party?
He didn't even have a card, and so couldn't go through the self check out, having to brave the stern-faced cashier.
John unlocked the door for them, as Sherlock’s fingers were trembling too much to be of much use. John took him by the hand, much more gently than Sherlock had anticipated, and drew him along behind him. Sherlock followed, heart still pounding.
"What do you think I was doing in here earlier?" Posh Bloke scoffed. "I was making sure that there weren't alarms and cameras. The one in the corner is obviously fake."
Sherlock waited for John to do something. He was baring himself, figuratively and literally, and it was nerve-wracking waiting for John to decide what he wanted. At the first touch of John's hands on his hips, Sherlock twitched.
His neighbour was a nutjob. He kept banging on Sherlock’s door telling him to keep the noise down. Sherlock conceded that sometimes his experiments were rather loud, but this sort of thing happened even when Sherlock was asleep.
"The last person left standing," John said. "But you know, winning wasn't really the point. The point was to find out as much goss as possible about your mates to use against them in the future."
"I don't know, perhaps if my brother is quite finished with the insults in Shakespeare's tongue, then I can help you with a little something," Mycroft said. "That, and my earlier requirement."
“Cheeky,” he said, and then pulled the t-shirt Sherlock was wearing up so that he could lick at Sherlock’s nipple.
He could hear Sherlock's breathing getting louder and pitchier as he licked at Sherlock's hole. He flattened his tongue against Sherlock's perineum and dragged it up slowly and firmly. Sherlock shoulders quivered, and he was muffling whimpers in the pillow underneath his head. John wiggled his tongue agains his opening, pushing and slicking it with saliva.
When he got in from the clinic, he ran into Mrs. Hudson on the way in, who stopped him and handed him his parcel, which she'd signed for in his absence. It was an ordinary-looking parcel, with nothing to give away what it actually contained.
Sherlock smiled and looked up through his eyelashes, something he knew John loved. Slowly, he lapped up the underside of John's cock, and then rubbed his cheek up the length. He was in no rush. He could draw this out for ages, and John swore that he just plain enjoyed it, just for the sake of having a cock in his mouth. Not that he couldn't suck John off quickly when he put his mind to it, he just enjoyed the build-up.
Surely he could get someone else to look through this for him? But no, no one else knew what type of vehicle had the sort of tire tracks he’d found in the warehouse.
Sherlock whined and kissed John again. John ran his hands up Sherlock's side, and Sherlock whined and grinded himself back against John's hardened length, which was settled in the curve of his arse.
"They are though," Sherlock muttered rebelliously, pouting. "You like adventure more than safety, I keep telling you."
"Hey, it's alright," John said. "We don't have to do this, you know. We could just pretend to be a couple on the rocks that is having one last go at being a proper couple and failing."
Sherlock didn't think it was good etiquette to leave one's partner asleep, but their bladder was rather insistent on them getting up. Extracting themself from John's possessive hold on them was something of a challenge, but Sherlock didn't mind John's clinging. They rather wanted to cling back and possibly never let go.
Sherlock awoke to fingers tracing his spine, and he sighed in contentment. He was warm and comfortable, coccooned in happiness, waiting to emerge as something entirely different than he had been last night.
Sherlock did, and looked around. John had arranged all of his furniture and there was a pile of flattened boxes in the corner waiting to be taken out. It looked as if John had gotten everything sorted out already. He was a fast worker. Sherlock still had boxes that he hadn’t bothered unpacking from when he’d moved in at beginning of term.
Sherlock couldn’t help it, he burst out laughing so hard that a spray of steam and hot water shot out of his nostrils. John leapt back, startled, but then turned up a frowning face towards him.
It seemed simple enough. I just had to do some snooping around while also pretending to be John’s... ugh... boyfriend and it would be an easy open and shut case.
Sherlock hadn't thought of that, actually, but John didn't need to know that. "If I told you, it would ruin the experiment."
He briefly considered trying to climb through a window, but reconsidered and simply decided to break the door down. Mrs. Hudson would forgive him, especially since Sherlock was in trouble.
"You have chlamydia, you're cheating on your wife with that guy, and that guy's secretly a drag queen. Also, half of you are coming off a marijuana high right now. Good marijuana, imported from Canada," Sherlock said, spouting off the information without really thinking about it.
John twined their fingers together, and Sherlock nearly crushed them as John went back to lapping at the head of his cock, tonguing the slit wetly. Sherlock made another loud and embarrassing noise, but it appeared to please John immensely, so Sherlock allowed himself the private moment.
"Don't you dare spoil it for me, you bastard," John said. "Now, are you going to sleep, or what? Not much else to do in this place anyway."
"I'll find more evidence later. Ongoing investigation you know. Come, John, let's get out of here," Sherlock edged toward the stairs back up and began quickly and silently making his way up them.
Feeling sick to their stomach with it, Sherlock dragged themself to the lab. Their dysphoria was almost overwhelming today, to the point that they couldn't even make deductions about people they saw while they were on their way. Sherlock just got a terrible feeling that everyone around them knew they were a freak and were actually staring at them and judging them.
And John... John thought that Sherlock only wanted to have sex with him because of his heat. Sherlock would never tell him that he'd wanted this from the moment he'd realized that John had shot the cabbie for him.
John was in the grips of a PTSD-fuelled nightmare, and Sherlock had to be very careful in his approach to waking John up. He had a brief moment of regret for his absent violin, which he'd left in the care of Mycroft (or, more likely, one of his minions) after John's wedding, and which he'd never retrieved. In the past, he'd played songs until John woke up.
Come to think of it, he'd stopped asking for anything after Redbeard had been hit by a car and killed. He'd never wanted any presents since then, not if they might be destroyed. Things were so easy to accidentally break.
John had grown a bit of a beard from lack of razors out on the street. He didn't mind it much, as it kept his face reasonably warm in cold night weather.
Sherlock was grinning and patting Gladstone, who looked mightily pleased with herself. She'd been more useful than she'd been in several months, unless one counted making sure a sad, maladjusted veteran didn't blow his own brains out.
"Sherlock, what do you want for Christmas?" John asked. "I've got to get my shopping done this week. Next week will probably be hectic for me at the clinic."
Sherlock eagerly spread his legs for John, and felt John hum in encouragement, hands running up and down their long length.
Mummy wanted to go see the Nutcracker. Sherlock could think of nothing he had less desire to see, but it was his turn. Mummy had even said that John could come if he wanted. Sherlock had no idea why John would bother, but miraculously enough, John agreed at once.
"What's going on? What are you doing locked in your room?" John asked. "You're normally at the lab till late, or working on your own experiments."
He knew that soldiers that went through trauma improved with an animal's companionship. He'd even prescribed it himself.
As if summoned by stray thoughts, Sherlock himself ambled out across the cliffs, and upon sighting her, headed in her direction. Very carefully, he settled himself next to her, shading her from the wind with one of his wings.
They broke apart, panting hard. John hovered over him, because somehow in the act of kissing, Sherlock had ended up flat on his back on John's bed. He felt a thrum of energy rush through him. This wasn't over, not by a long shot.
Sherlock whimpered and clung to John's back, fingers slipping in sweat, nails scoring the broad expand of skin.
Sherlock did as he was bid and watched as John looked through the carefully labelled boxes for one that contained his medical kit. It didn’t take long, and John patted his injured hand dry with a towel, then started applying an antibiotic cream.
Sherlock's eyes darkened, and he started unbuttoning his shirt, pulling it out from where it was tucked into his trousers. John unfolded the rope, running it through his hands as he watched Sherlock quickly shuck his trousers as well, eyes fastened on John's hands.
"Didn't you know? Mrs. Hudson gives me a deal. Her husband was going to be executed in Florida." Sherlock seemed very cavalier about all this. John felt anxiety welling up in his chest.
"You do?" John said. "I never got that impression. You're always tense or look like you'd rather be on the other side of the room whenever I touch you."
Sherlock definitely knew that he couldn't just go and wake John up by physically touching him. Even if this nightmare was created from a different memory than those John had from the war, John had still been a soldier. Waking him up with his mind in such turmoil would probably result in Sherlock being put through the wall.
It deserved the capitals he gave it in his head. He still had a very intense memory of John's hands, warm and firm, grasping his knee to steady himself. The heated look in John's eyes, and the fact that at any moment, Sherlock could have had a warm, pliant, and pleased John Watson topple between his spread thighs was imprinted on his brain.
John finally fingered Sherlock hard, plunging his fingers up and in, rubbing against that spot inside him that made Sherlock wail with every thrust. John could see Sherlock grabbing onto the chain of the handcuffs so tightly his fingers turned mottled pink and white. Sweat ran down his forehead, and Sherlock didn't care.
But upon John entering the next morning, Sherlock opened his mouth to demand John pay attention, and instead he said, "O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention."
John lifted Sherlock's legs up so that he could lick the spot behind Sherlock's balls, and Sherlock made a tortured keening sound as John applied his tongue liberally. John made his lips soft and mouthed at Sherlock's testicles. Sherlock cried out and spread his knees further.
"Maybe," John said, trying not to act too affected. "I mean, you aren't used to me acting affectionately with you, so this would acclimatize you more quickly."
"Ogres, elves and trolls are no better," Mycroft said, glaring at Sherlock. "If I didn't know better, I'd be certain that this was some sort of plan of yours to get out of marrying Princess Molly."
Once again, Sherlock was distracted from his main mission, which was to get his proper voice back, by John and his insistence on dating insipid women.
Except, Sherlock definitely couldn't go by himself, because the likelihood of Sherlock also being thrown in a psychiatric hospital was high unless someone were with him.
Sherlock sighed. "So, if it's not played like the kid's game, where whoever gets to ten fingers last wins, then when does it end?"
“I'd prefer to have a travelling companion to someone following me at a distance any day,” John said. “I figure that if I said no, you'd just tail me all the way to Sherlock's location.”
John waited patiently for the monarchs to get their silly babble out of the way. He knew why he was here. There could be no other reason.
“John,” I finally said, trying not to let the annoyance enter my voice. “What are we going to do about the bed?”
“It's because there's only so much science to do on this small island,” Sherlock said. “We can't stay here forever, but what comes after isn't clear.”
“Oh,” Sherlock said softly, his heart fluttering like a breath could extinguish it as easily as a candle.
She had called Sherlock a freak at first – sometimes because Sherlock had a tendency to lose all sense of tact when John wasn't around, and sometimes because it was obvious by Sherlock's clothing that they didn't follow typical gender expectations. John had put a stop to that as soon as she'd returned and started going out on cases again.
He couldn't be doing it on purpose. Not his Sherlock, disdainful of human contact and consummately unaffected. John glanced up again and broke the tip of his pencil, scattering dark grey shards all over his crossword. Sherlock was doing it nonetheless, whether or not it was on purpose.
"Yes, Mrs. Hudson, that's very nice. He is my new assistant," Sherlock said, seeming pleased with himself.
At the compliment, Sherlock renewed his suction, licking and sucking as if there was nothing better to do than suck John's cock. John could hardly believe that the dark head bobbing in his lap was actually Sherlock. It was like a fantasy come to life.
"Yes, here's your keycard, map of the resort, and coupons for couple's massage at the spa," she chirped, handing them everything. Have a pleasant stay, Mr. Holmes!"
Anderson drew himself up and said, “How could a bone-headed knight like you discover the whereabouts of Prince Sherlock when I, the most powerful mage in the kingdom, failed?”
His pension was meagre, and dwindling fast – between the rent, his food, and food for Gladstone, he hardly had enough to get by. He was told to go to a therapist, he even had one recommended to him, but the idea that anyone who hadn't been there, who hadn't had Afghanistan seep into their very pores, who hadn't seen their blood soaking into the dry earth could ever understand was impossible. The wilds of the desert, the unforgiving landscape, the glaring sun and heat and dust was looking out from behind his eyes, and someone from London would never recognise it for what it was.
To Sherlock's utter horror, as soon as John stepped through the door, they felt tears well up in their eyes again. They tried to blink them away, but a heavy sob worked its way out of their throat.
The tile underneath the keg had an indent in the middle with a ring that could pull up. Lestrade got ahold of it and pulled. Underneath was a metal door with a padlock on it.
Sherlock flushed, and John giggled, leaning up on her tip-toes to kiss them on the cheek. Sherlock looked at themself in the mirror a second time, admiring how their face looked so different now that they didn't have all that hair around their face. It changed the whole way their face looked, made it seem sharper, more masculine – which Sherlock supposed was the point of it.
I felt like I was falling, and it took a second to realize that my knees were shaking. I was still trembling as if I could rattle myself right out of my skin. John’s fingers carded through my hair and I groaned into the kiss hungrily. John crowded close to me, and we were close, so close. I could feel his chest heaving against mine. He was as affected as I was.
“From my ‘one true love,’” Sherlock repeated, and he put as much disgust behind his voice as possible.
"Let's go," John said, tugging them in the direction of more shops. "We can still get you something to wear today. I just thought... you might like something nice."
It was obvious he was homeless. He kept as clean as possible, but sleeping in alleyways, digging through garbage tips, and having limited access to laundromats and showers took its toll. As soon as he stepped inside, he was on the receiving end of a barrage of short-lived glares that turned into avoidance.
“I care that Mycroft apparently sent a legend to come after me,” Sherlock said. “I thought he’d just send Lestrade, actually.”
He cleared his throat and straightened his clothes again, although they didn’t need it. He shuffled his feet once and went to knock.
Lestrade stumbled off of the crime scene, apparently in search of more caffeine sustenance. John remembered there was a cafe just around the corner to acquire it. As he left, a tall, black woman came in, frowning as she set eyes on him.
"Tw-twenty-four," Sherlock burst out belatedly. It was a slow reaction, but John would let it slide.
"Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?" Sherlock murmured absent-mindedly as he examined the body.
Sherlock's scientific brain wanted to cry out in terror, that adding John to the equation doubled the variables and made their path forward even harder to calculate. John's hand slid through his hair, and Sherlock sighed, shuddered, and closed his eyes.
"Yes, and as fast as we can," John determined. He addressed the man himself. "Hello? Hello, can you hear me? My name is John Watson. I'm a doctor. We're here to help you."
"By Music, minds an equal temper know, nor swell too high, nor sink too low. If in the breast tumultuous joys arise, music her soft, assuasive voice applies," Sherlock said, playing something softer as he thought of John going away with Chantelle and leaving Sherlock by himself.
John sighed. No one ever believed him. Without a word, he unslung his shield from his back. It still shone silver and white, no matter how much he used it. A gifted mage had once given it to him as a gift because the one he usually used kept getting dented. It was round and had a white tree in the middle.
Sherlock poked his head out of the door, and then looked up at John standing across the street. He was wearing his blue robe and pyjama pants and one of John's ratty old t-shirts that Sherlock must have nicked at some point. Just seeing Sherlock in his clothes sent a possessive surge through John that John clenched his hands to subdue. His hair was darker and limp with sweat, and even across the street, Sherlock's aroma drifted to John's nose.
Two more strokes and Sherlock let out a little mewl and rolled his hips up. John drew eight points on Sherlock's body and smiled slightly.
“How is he supposed to find them?” asked King Alendale. “I still think that we should send an army to scour the lands -”
meant "that which is denied is desired." It spoke of repression of feeling that would burst out if kept bottled up. Sherlock did not like the sounds of that. If anything, he definitely wanted to keep his unfortunate feelings hidden. John was not to know.
Sherlock's cheeks burned at the word, at John using it to describe him, he was both completely mortified and absurdly delighted by it. John's nose brushed against his, and then John's mouth found his. Sherlock's hands came up and clutched at John's shoulders.
As he said this, he quickly searched the area and found a metal panel. He opened it, revealing the switchboard for the tavern. He flicked them all off, cutting power to the lights. John grudgingly admitted that that was a clever move on Sherlock's part.
To his surprise, after John settled Sherlock into bed, he climbed onto the other side and lay down, albeit on top of the sheets and still dressed.
Hello everyone, this is testosterone-tea! For those of you who are here from Tumblr, I have to tell you that I have very cleverly managed to lock myself out of my account. I'll still be posting works here, but so far, Tumblr support hasn't been very helpful in getting me access to my account. So sorry if you're wondering where I've been.
What had Mr. Fielding been doing in the first place when he had discovered the matchboxes? Where had they all come from? What did the warehouse have to do with anything? And who was driving Mr. Fielding’s van now that he was in hospital? The questions were piling up.
The best thing that Sherlock had discovered about being with John is that he could demand a hug anytime he wanted. Mostly, he would come and stand very close to John and lean on him until John realized what he wanted.
"You can't," John said. "But we can try our hardest to make things work. And I know you, and you know me, as well as any two people can know one another. We have to trust one another, and if something happens, we have to work together to fix it."
Unfortunately, Sherlock hadn't the power to help John out. He was too far away, and Sherlock was already on the way to Mr. Fielding's house. He couldn't communicate with the cab driver that he had to turn around.
“Do you have a true love?” Sherlock asked sarcastically. “Not everyone does, and I assure you, I do not. Besides, you’re out of luck. Women are not really... my area.”
John stopped short, and Sherlock said quickly, "Don't go in the flat, it's overrun by bedbugs. I've taken precaution to make sure I don't cross-contaminate the rest of the house. The exterminator can't be here until tomorrow morning, so you'll have to make due with not showering until tomorrow."
"What's that about angels?" John asked in bemusement. "I'd almost say you were doing that on purpose now, if I didn't know that you know absolutely nothing about literature."
"What do you think I should do to punish you, Private?" John asked, circling him in a predatory manner. "You've been awfully naughty. Gone AWOL. Wouldn't want a court-martial, would we? You're going to have to do a lot to make up for that."
"Come on, let's go," John said. "I want to make us some dinner, and then we can trade back massages. Sound good to you?"
John Watson was the captain of the university girl's rugby team, was training to be a doctor, and wanted to join the army. And Sherlock, in spite of their admiration of John's stellar qualities, they couldn't help but be envious at the same time.
Sherlock whimpered as John said that. He loved it when John called him his good lad, so John made sure to say it at least once during their more forceful sessions. To be honest, John rather liked calling Sherlock his anything, and it was adorable how much Sherlock grew flustered when he was called the endearment unexpectedly.
There was the news anchor to track down, his husband, and the daughter of the government official. Or, I could start easy and talk to one of the hotel workers. They overheard everything.
But this was very interesting information. John had, by his own admittance, given somebody a blowjob. Of course, that person could have been a trans woman, but John's reaction suggested that was not the case. Who had it been? Somebody in the army? Now that Sherlock knew that, he wondered if John had ever slept with a man.
"Accidentally burned a hole in the wall of my place at Montague," Sherlock said, cheerfully unrepetent. "I'll see you later, Dr. Watson."
Panting, they stared at themself in the mirror. Their hair was a mess still, although it was shorter now. It was surprisingly light not to have all the hair weighing them down. But without the extra weight of hair, their curls had gone on a riot. Their hair was everywhere, sticking out and fluffing out around their head uncontrollably. Some of their hair was too short to even put in a tie because they'd miscalculated in their haste.
Sherlock waited impatiently for John to finish up with his morning, but John was in no hurrying mood. By the time he'd finished breakfast, washed the dishes, completed his morning ablutions, and gone to get dressed, Sherlock was in something of what John termed 'a tizzy.'
They went back and forth for a while. Sherlock found out that John had never broken a bone, gone to Australia (full of poison things John), set himself on fire (it was
Sherlock watched as John slid the dildo into a condom and slicked it up with lube. First, John slid his fingers into Sherlock, searching around until he found the bump of Sherlock's prostate. Sherlock was leaking in earnest onto his flat stomach, and when John hit his prostate, his cock jerked slightly against his belly and dripped more sticky fluid next to his navel.
"I also knew you wouldn't be able to resist correcting my deductions," John said with a laugh. "What are you doing in there, Sherlock? Come out and have some dinner."
After blinking odd after-images out of his vision, Sherlock had shook his head and sneezed. Nothing else had happened – or so he thought.
Hello all! I finally updated this fic. I'm hoping to finish it sometime in the future. Let me know what you think. This is pretty much a crack fic, but in the very least there will be some John/Sherlock action in the future chapters.
The other alpha twitched, and that was it. The alpha leapt forward, fist raised. John, used as he was to real combat in an active war zone, calmly sidestepped the blow and brought his elbow up. John's elbow caught the alpha right in the solar plexus. The alpha dropped back on his arse, too winded to stand back up.
He could tell this was a transparent attempt on John's part to find out more about his past. He would let him ask, in the hopes that maybe this would bridge some of the cavernous gap that had grown between them in his absence. John could have just asked, like a normal person. But of course, he had to pretend it was a game in order to actually do it.
John sipped his coffee and sighed happily. Strangely, he didn't mind that there wasn't a case right now. Sherlock had promised to take him out later that night and show him the city.
"That's the thing," Lestrade said. "He wasn't bloody well missing, or reported missing by his coworkers. In fact, some of them seem to think he was still on the job today – checked in this morning, as he does every few days. Now we can't find him, and it's making me wonder if the guy who checked in was actually him."
Sherlock just shrugged and sipped their coffee. It was perfect, as always. John knew just what they liked.
Unable to resist the curiosity, John went, wanting to see where Sherlock had done his graduate chemistry studies. Why Sherlock wanted to go was a mystery – surely he couldn't tell there would be a murder from parchment and wax?
Sherlock had no idea where most of his clothes had ended up. John picked up a fluffy blanket off the end of his bed and tossed it to Sherlock. Sherlock stared at it.
"Are you all right, Mr. Fielding?" asked Chantelle, looking up from her conversation with John. "If he's getting upset, maybe you should go."
"Sherlock?" he said in confusion. "Have you been burning something in here? What were you playing? It was nice."
"You know, this isn't the end of the world, you know," John said, hand running over their head. "It's fixable. We can definitely fix this."
Sherlock lost track of how long he played, but the horrible smell of burned toenails had almost completely faded by the time the sound of feet on the stairs started coming up. Sherlock didn't notice them, however, caught up as he was in playing.
Of course the one person to see through their feminine facade was also the least supportive and understanding person on the planet. How had Mycroft even figured it out? Mycroft had just started some dull government job. Maybe they were using it to spy on them?
"Oh, I've put my foot in it now," Lestrade groaned. "You're the chap from last night, aren't you. And that's the very same dog that I complained about not having a leash."
Sherlock let him believe that they would be allowed to wander about in this wintery wonderland later, after John was done work.
I'm back! It was a rough three weeks. I just started a new job, so I was just learning the ropes. This is the first weekend I've had that wasn't completely hectic.
“Oh,” John said, and for a moment, Sherlock was worried that was going to be a problem. “Boyfriend then? It’s fine, it’s all fine.”
John wanted to continue to be angry, but when he showed up at Wiggin's place with the antiseptic and some bandages, it helped. Methodically washing his hands and tending to the injuries of the young drug addict calmed him, and as he finished wrapping up the bandages, he felt better.
"I'll see you later, Doc Watson," Wiggins said. "You've got something good going on here. Forget what I said earlier."
Sherlock knew that, having had much more grievous injuries than shredded knuckles. He just liked complaining. He made a few more grumbling whines as John finished cleaning out the injuries. John just hummed and started wrapping gauze around his knuckles. Once he'd finished, he surveyed his completed work with satisfaction.
And there it was, the swell of John's knot, joining them together. It was almost time, and Sherlock ground back against it, hoping it would hit his sweet spot.
Sherlock made a motion with his hand to indicate that he wanted the flashdrive. John rolled his eyes and handed it over without argument. He didn’t even say anything as Sherlock settled on the couch and pulled John’s laptop towards him.
He made his way back to the other end of the bed, and swung again, this time a little harder. Sherlock yelped this time.
John was washing dishes and the sight of him was simply too much to bear. Something inside Sherlock overflowed and overwhelmed him.
John respected science a great deal, and he put up with Sherlock's experiments far more than any of Sherlock's past acquaintances. If he could come up with a compelling enough argument, John might willingly consent to sharing a bed more often with Sherlock.
John kissed his shoulder again, and down, pressing down his back, criss-crossing his spine. Sherlock waited in confusion for John to explain what was happening, because this was the last thing he'd expected.
"Come on, Sherlock," John cajoled. "I'd feel weird buying Christmas presents for everyone else and not getting one for my favourite person."
Now, Alice wasn’t supposed to even be a suspect, but she’d been in contact with Malcolm a few days before the murder. And she’d been in contact with him before every murder that had happened. Malcolm, too, upon investigation, had been in the area of several of the murders, but there hadn’t been many witnesses.
"Very dashing," the hairdresser said, holding up a mirror for Sherlock to see the back. "What do you think?"
John laughed softly, and slicked more lube over his cock and around Sherlock's entrance before easing forward with a slow roll of his hips. Sherlock groaned loudly, grabbing at John's arse to pull him forward. John panted as he sank into velvety wet heat, deeper and deeper. When he finally bottomed out against Sherlock's arse, they were both breathing hard and clinging to each other.
Sherlock blushed and automatically jerked away from John. "He was just mad because he was trying to get into my pants and didn't realize I only like women."
Mrs. Hudson arrived first, and immediately came to fuss over Sherlock. "Oh, you look a treat, doesn't he, John?"
He got home and found Sherlock waiting for him. Before John could say a word, Sherlock brandished the envelope at him. John sighed – he was right, this was going to end badly.
Sherlock's mother always complimented their hair, because it was long and beautiful, and it flowed down their back in rippling curls.
Sherlock capitulated, allowed himself to be dragged under. He couldn’t breathe, and the rushing in his ears told him he was drowning.
You wouldn't think the man a work of art, unless you were me, and still I am jealous of every woman that crosses his path, because who could not understand, who could not see what a wonder he is?
"What am I supposed to do now?" Sherlock complained loudly. "How am I supposed to conduct experiments in this state?"
"Well... as long as you got the quid, I'll pull you a pint," the man said, and without asking which beer he wanted, reached for a glass and did so.
The thing was, Sherlock hadn't thought they would be able to escape. And he'd brought a lot of them – an excessive amount, now that he reconsidered the number based on the fact they had escaped and were loose in the flat. Sherlock hadn't even noticed they'd escaped for the majority of the day, because he'd been distracted by a cold case from Lestrade.
Soon there was flour everywhere. Sherlock and John panted, covered in it, grinning. Sherlock couldn't help but think that John hadn't minded touching him while the battle was joined. Perhaps not mentioning that would be best.
John was already gone by the time he woke up, and neither mentioned what had transpired the night before.
Molly was the one that had found the caves hidden by an overgrowth of vegetation which Sherlock had torn down so that they could find their way inside. It had taken a lot of cleaning up, but between the two of them, they managed to get the caves into a condition that might be considered liveable.
Sherlock's already dilated pupils went huge at the sight, and his flushed cheeks darkened even more. For a moment, John wasn't sure it wasn't a fear reaction until Sherlock nodded vigorously.
The thing was, they wouldn't mind the long hair so much if people didn't think that long hair automatically signalled being female. In fact, sometimes they liked the long hair, and liked wearing cute feminine clothing. But the other half of the time, Sherlock could hardly stand it.
He aimed a hit at the back of Sherlock's thighs, and Sherlock squeaked in surprise. A glob of stringy precome hung from the tip of his cock before dripping onto the sheets.
Just like that, it was over and done with. The alpha slunk off, and John turned back to the door of 221b.
Sherlock sighed, "Technically, yes. But the investigation isn't over yet, so I don't see why we should right now. Who knows when this will wrap up? It's turning into quite the interesting case."
"It was in his things that got taken, along with his insulin," John said. "So who took that? Did they mean to kill him or not?"
I wanted to know whether or not John felt the same way that I did before anything else happened. He kissed me, but my brain was coming back online, rebooting like lightning. Did he love me, or was I just ... convenient? I couldn’t help but fear that this meant nothing to John, no matter all that we’d been through together.
John left their door, and soon Sherlock could hear her banging the pots and pans around in the kitchen, louder than usual. John made something quickly and didn't wait for Sherlock to come join her. Not that Sherlock was able to leave without John noticing. Their dorm room was a tiny thing, barely big enough for two people to live in, let alone sneak around in without the other noticing.
Sherlock simply nodded once, forehead bumping against John's shoulder. John slid his pants down over his hips, and Sherlock helped by shimmying them down around his knees and kicking them off. John shucked his as well, and then they were naked. The intimacy of the feeling was exquisite, and it almost hurt, the feeling that pulsed through Sherlock's body.
It was strange that Sherlock and John had both served their nation now, and both come away scarred from the ordeal.
Curse their bodily weaknesses that prevented them from simply staying here all day instead of getting up and performing tedious bodily functions.
"What's that about death?" John said. "The guy is dead? You want to know why he's dead? Oh! You want to go to the morgue."
Sherlock hazily came back to himself and became aware of the semen cooling on his skin and gluing him to John, collapsed on top of him. He smiled slowly and twined his legs with John's, feeling very satisfied and satiated.
John drank, frowned, and poured himself some more bourbon. They had both gone through quite a lot of liquor by that point, more than Sherlock thought was advisable.
"That's not everything, is it?" John asked. "There's something you're not telling me. Such as why you've been avoiding me."
Sherlock nudged John's leg with his head, and John's hand obediently came down to pat his curls. Sherlock closed his eyes, and the room was still bright behind his eyelids. He made a soft sound in his throat as John's fingers stroked his scalp, and the soft spot behind his left ear.
"I gathered as much," John said wryly. "Does he always assume your female friends are your girlfriend?"
The first time it happened, it was actually a complete accident. To be fair, accidents while experimenting that made John mad were fairly common occurances. But it wasn't often that Sherlock rendered a whole level of their flat uninhabitable.
Hey all, John and Gladstone are back! Sorry the update took a bit longer than I planned. Finals week, you know. I'm done that now, so look forward to hopefully more regular updates. This is sort of the end of what I think of as Part 1. John is moving on to Part 2 of his life with Sherlock and Gladstone. Hope you enjoy!
“And let me guess, Sherlock doesn’t care about that, whatever he wants is too important for silly things like rules,” Lestrade said.
Sherlock made a rumbling noise in his throat, and it sounded enough like a purr that John laughed. It was a good sound, and Sherlock could feel it against his cheek and in his chest. John's fingertips found a sensitive spot, and Sherlock arched his neck back to urge him on.
Sherlock really didn't. Pubs were loud, filled with idiots under the influence of varying amounts of alcohol, and served food that was really not for the faint of heart.
Sherlock went back to his flat, and when he got there, there was already a message on his phone, waiting for him.
Mr. Fielding, who hadn't looked at all like he was inclined to talk to Sherlock at all, suddenly turned to stare at him.
Remembering where he'd found Sherlock's prostate, John drew the dildo partially out and then pressed it back in. Sherlock's eyes flew open, and he gasped. Following that cue, John started up a slow rhythm that had Sherlock writhing on the bed and pulling his knees back more.
When they got back, Sherlock went and dug around under his bed, pulling out a rather impressive collection of different kinds of rope. Never mind John's book, how had Sherlock managed to hide all
Sherlock sighed in relief. Molly probably had a fair idea of what he meant by his lines, because while she was quiet and a bit meek, she was very perceptive. At least if she realized his real feelings, then she would cease in her pursuit of him.
. Sherlock lost himself in the slide of their mouths together, the gentle push and pull of it. It had a rhythm to it, one that his body somehow knew already, without any input from his thinking processors.
Then Gladstone barked, and everyone fell silent. She barked again and then sat down on top of the grate, staring at John. She whined again and nosed at the grate.
Wiggins was a den ward for a cocaine den, and sometimes he asked John for a little medical help. Mostly simple stuff, like knowing what to do if someone OD'd or got out of control. John could hardly refuse his aid in return for the help Wiggins had given him in his early days.
Now, the government official's daughter, Alice Vernier was supposed to be here with her girlfriend Dana, but she and Dana had broken up just before the retreat. Alice was attending alone.
The rest of the guests arrived at once, and Sherlock was persuaded, in no small part by the remembrance of John's smile, to play the violin. It wasn't terrible, as far as parties went. At least he liked everyone there.
"Don't call him that," John said. "If it wasn't for him, you'd never have found the entrance, nor would you have realized that there was a person trapped down there to begin with."
He thought he'd actually managed to hide it from Sherlock, and then one day, he came home from work early and found it was missing. Surely, he'd just misplaced it? A thorough search of his closet did not unearth it, so with a sigh, John concluded that Sherlock must have found it.
Sherlock sighed. It was Sebastian Wilkes and one of his cronies. He’d met Wilkes in his undergrad year, and had made a fast enemy. Wilkes had tried to play around with him, like he did so many other people, trying to get them to dance to his tune. Sherlock had seen through it, but not before Wilkes had made Sherlock think he actually had a friend in him.
If there was one thing they wished they could tell their younger self, it was how they lived – and loved – now. A fairytale ended at happily-ever-after, but Sherlock and John were still living it, from that very day way back when, and beyond it.
Sherlock trembled and writhed, but John was in no hurry. He licked at Sherlock's cock through the fabric until Sherlock's pants were soaked and clingy. By the time that John had mercy and removed them, Sherlock was desperately trying to get friction on his aching cock.
"Why would you want to do that?" Sherlock asked. "The flat will be filled with loud, messy people who we only marginally know through work."
Sherlock had already considered that. There was only one place to stay in the town, a little bed and breakfast with very limited rooms. He had planned it in advance, and he was fairly certain there was a room available, but no more than one room. It was perfect.
It was true, Sherlock did avoid a lot of people, and more often than not, could be found either in the lab running an experiment or in the university dorms reading research papers. Sherlock didn't much like people, but they didn't know how much of it was actual dislike of people, and how much it was that in their mind, every single person that passed them on the street looked at them and automatically thought "girl."
It wasn’t even just his flat, it was the entire building. The pipes kept breaking and raining down through people’s ceilings, the elevator never worked and always smelled of marijuana. Sometimes it took him to the eighth floor instead of the sixth or creaked ominously.
"Oh," Molly said, returning to her unconcerned state. "I'm sure it must have been quite the bet for Sherlock to have lost to end up not being able to speak properly."
It was supposed to be a case that brought them here, but so far, there hadn't been anything resembling detective work happening at all. There had been a lot of delicious food and drinking wine while sitting on their balcony at night, looking out at the city and hearing the sound of the ocean.
John didn't expect to see the mysterious man with the sharp cheekbones again. Even people who were nice to the homeless tended to forget that they existed once they were out of sight. John had told the strange man about Len's conversation, and Posh Bloke had dashed off, without saying thank you, but not without tossing several ten quid notes at John's face.
John drew back and grinned ferally, and Sherlock's gut lurched, wondering if John would simply pick him up and carry him off caveman-style. The idea wasn't as unappealing as he would have imagined earlier, before all this had unravelled.
Sherlock stood at the bottom of the stairs to John's room and stared up at John's door. After the "experimental" bed sharing incident, Sherlock told John that he didn't need any further experimental sessions. John had been completely neutral about this announcement, neither disappointed nor relieved.
John pinched his nipple, and Sherlock yelped. John had thought as much, he was just getting Sherlock used to the feeling of the wax.
Anyway, the point is, that oftentimes various trauma in my life leads to feelings that are quite unwelcome, which I suppress as best I can. Unfortunately, when you suppress feelings, they often emerge elsewhere in inconvenient ways.
He didn't say anything else but increasingly pitiful utterances of Sherlock's name for the next minute. The words grated at the very marrow of Sherlock's bones. How did he make this better?
"That was very quick," John commented. "Whoever it was only had a couple of hours to find him and kill him."
"We, meaning you and Sherlock Holmes," Wiggins said. "You know, Doc, I think you're made for trouble."
He went back downstairs and found Sherlock in their room, standing at attention. His eyes widened fractionally at the sight of John in his actual uniform, and his throat bobbed. Right on the money, Sherlock was aroused by John wearing combats.
"I still get the feeling you think you're in charge of these proceedings," John said, a hint of dark in his voice. "You couldn't be more mistaken."
“Yeah, apparently something large carried off one of their sheep a while back,” said Greg musingly. “Could have been a dragon, but there are other monsters in these parts.”
But he remembered what the thrill of the fight was like, and he needed it. He knew that Len had been up to something untoward, and he also knew that Posh Bloke was investigating it.
Sherlock's eyes were becoming glazed over, and John would bet anything he was high as a kite on endorphins. He was also flooded with arousal, which made John's cock throb in sympathy. Soon this would be over, and then they could both come.
It took Sherlock until midnight that night to realize something very important. He snapped out of his daze on the couch and shot upright. John was asleep, so he couldn’t show him what he had discovered.
"I thought you might show up sooner or later," Molly said. "Looks like we've got an interesting one now. He has some strange stab wounds, superficial and not what caused death."
John stood frozen, and Sherlock Holmes prattled at him as he dashed around, talking a million miles an hour about the case. John wasn't sure what half of it was about, but he wasn't really hearing what Sherlock said anyway. There was a feeling of panic expanding in his chest. He turned to look at Sherlock and instead caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror above the mantel.
John’s cock slid over Sherlock’s hip and when Sherlock bucked up, finally came in contact with Sherlock’s aching length.
“John, I...” I attempted, but John raised a finger to my lips and that’s all it took to silence me. I was trembling in his embrace, and there was no way that he didn’t notice that.
Sherlock automatically opened his mouth to say something, and what came out was, "Poor lady, she were better love a dream."
Good news! I've handed in my full draft of my thesis to my committee. Very soon, I will have a defence date, and then I will be a Master of the Arts. What this means for you guys? More writing time for Sherlock and John.
His jaw began to ache, but he kept sliding his mouth down over John’s length, trying to get as much of it in his mouth as possible. John’s hand was tangled in his hair, and Sherlock found he liked it there. Before this, he’d have thought the act of oral sex demeaning, as it was portrayed in pornography. But this was so much more than that, somehow.
"Ah, but that's not what you said," John said with a grin. "You said that nothing I do would distract you."
John sucked at the head of Sherlock's cock, pleased to taste the salty-bitter flavoured pre-ejaculate leaking from his slit. He lapped at it, teasing more out. He pulled back and slowly stroked his wet hand over Sherlock's cock while simultaneously reaching into the bag until he found what he needed.
It what they all did, out here. He'd received more help from people in his exact situation than anyone else out there.
Then, there was the fact that with one foot bare and one foot still clad, he couldn't walk to the taxi waiting for them.
The breathless quality of Sherlock's voice, the vulnerable shake as he mouthed that word silently to himself after he'd already said it aloud made John's heart throb almost painfully.
“It amazes me that you are still able to antagonize your brother when you can only speak in literary gibberish,” John said.
"Oh, no, if you're just doing that, I've got a date waiting on my freedom," John said. "Well, if that's all, I'll just be on my way."
He moved, and his head hurt, dehydration hitting him. He hadn't wanted to move before, and now he wanted to move even less. He knew he should drink some water, maybe take something for the pain in his head, but logic wasn't working at this moment.
The contents of a duffle bag were easy to pack up and to carry when he abandoned the bedsit for London's underbelly. He still had a good pair of combat boots, and he picked up an old sleeping bag from a thrift store. If there was one thing that John Watson knew, it was survival. He could survive anything.
Sherlock nodded again. Chicago wasn't the worst one he could be forced to see. At least there was murder in it.
Sherlock already knew that about John, but it still stung to hear. He left without saying anything, too intent upon the case to linger long where there were no more leads.
"Here, take a break and have coffee with me," John said, leaning over Sherlock's shoulders and resting her crossed arms over them.
John supposed he was being given the cheapest one there was, so didn't complain. Come to think of it, he did recognize the man's face. Possibly from walking back and forth to work, but also probably...
"Her owner is dead then, aren't they," Sherlock said. "You were fairly close, and Gladstone went through the same thing as you did. It's why you're so loyal to one another."
Consciousness returned slowly. John had to fight for it, struggle against the darkness and the delirium threatening to drag him down again. It was like trying to swim in treacle, but eventually, John opened his eyes and saw he was in a room with white walls, separated from the bed next to him by a flimsy blue curtain.
“Wait,” Mycroft said, an edge of panic in his voice. “You're correct. No one else can do this mission.”
“That's no problem,” John said. “He's with a girl, right? One he was supposed to marry. True love's first kiss reverses pretty much any spell.”
They lay there for a little while, simply breathing together, settling into each other's presence, soaking it up like plants unfurling for the sun. Then John began tracing patterns on his back. Sherlock made a valiant effort not to tense up, but John must have noticed the tightening of his shoulders, because he stopped.
Once away from the front desk, I started talking to John in a low voice. “I didn’t think that Xavier was involved, but I might have been wrong on that front.”
They got a cab to the hospital, and John said all the necessary niceties to everyone in order for them to be let in. John was always so nice to all of these silly idiots, but Sherlock dared not open his mouth, for fear of what exactly would emerge. John seemed to be enjoying this.
Sherlock wanted to say not to worry, that he and John were going to catch whoever had made all these matchboxes and find a way to fix them. Instead, he held the man's eyes and nodded briefly, then went over to the pile of old newspapers lying on one of the tables. He rapidly searched through until he found the one announcing his return. He brought it back to the table where Mr. Fielding was.
"But you didn't find anything besides his drug stash," John said. "Anyway, you can't use it as evidence if you break and enter."
"Strangely enough, I think your weird brother knew what was happening," John said. "He sent me the address to the tailor and said I might need it. I had no idea what he was talking about until last night."
"Really, Sherlock, you're still going on with this?" Mycroft said. "I was certain you'd be tired of it before the end of an hour."
While Sherlock was still in mid-argument, he stepped over to Sherlock's side and easily slid himself under Sherlock's arm. John leaned into him, wrapping an arm around his lower back, leaning his head against Sherlock's surprisingly soft shoulder.
Lestrade turned to Sherlock and sighed. "Really, Sherlock?" He turned back to John. "Not that I'm surprised that Sherlock would do something like this, but what did he do to get you to come along with him, kidnap you off the street?"
"It's fine," Sherlock reiterated, not wanting John to get out of the bed and leave Sherlock by himself.
"Let me guess, we're going to skip having a proper breakfast to go haring off after a murderer," John said with a sigh.
He could ‘accidentally’ set her on fire, that would probably work. No, that would get rid of Chantelle, but John would see through it immediately and get mad at Sherlock. He was always annoyed when something Sherlock did drove away one of his dates. But Sherlock didn’t have a choice if he wanted to keep John.
John frowned, wondering what exactly Sherlock was doing at Bart's with his bondage handbook. A flashback to Sherlock giving Molly sex toys without realizing the deeper meaning behind it made him clench his hands. Surely he wasn't getting
"Well, I did ask him at one point after we got back, and he said he still hadn't," John said. "Anyway, in uni, it's a drinking game. So, if you've done it, you take a drink."
Sherlock peered over John's shoulder. It appeared to be mulled wine, which Sherlock had memories of being allowed to drink during the Christmas holidays at home when he was a teen. Perhaps sensing someone behind him, John turned his head to look.
"It's not as if you would have all this time to do it," John said. "Not to mention, you'd probably end up being... distracted."
Mrs. Hudson was baking, and somehow, John had been roped in to help. Not that he seemed to mind. Sherlock watched from the doorway as they put their batch of shortbreads into the oven. There was flour everywhere, and the kitchen was a mess.
John's fingers found the edge of Sherlock's shirt and pulled it up their ribcage. They felt goosebumps ripple up their stomach, and John's fingers on their skin. John made an inquiring sound against their mouth, tugging at the fabric bunched up around their middle.
As soon as Adam McTavish was around the corner, Posh Bloke leapt to his feet and went to the back door. John and Gladstone followed at a more sedate pace, and John watched as he fiddled with two long, thin metal objects.
John hooked his fingers in the waistband of Sherlock's trousers and dragged them down, slowly. Sherlock tried to kick them off his legs, but John trapped him there with the fabric and nuzzled Sherlock's inner thigh up to his knee.
They stayed on the front step of 221b until it started raining, and they both rushed inside again. John made them tea. John wasn't sure, but he thought it might be the start of something.
He kissed down the smooth length of Sherlock’s stomach, dotting it with little moist presses of his lips. Sherlock struggled to get the shirt off, as much as he liked wearing something of John’s, having bare skin to rub against John was more important at the moment. He emerged to find John in the same position he’d been in last night, between Sherlock’s spread legs.
"Oh?" Mycroft asked, raising an eyebrow. "I will give them, if my dear brother asks for them. And will take Mummy out to the theatre."
"We should sleep together," Sherlock announced. Then, he waited for John's reaction, pen poised to note it down. For science.
"I... hate my hair," Sherlock said. "I've always hated it. I've wanted to cut it off for years and years now, but I didn't. My mother loves my hair. Everyone loves my hair. People like my hair more than they like the person attached to it."
"But what am I supposed to say?" Sherlock asked. "When everyone asks about it? They will ask about it, of course, because they all love my hair and how long it is... was. Everyone will want to know why I cut it all off. They'll think I'm even more of a freak than before! At least before now, everyone always forgave me for being weird because I looked like a girl. Now what will they all say?"
It was such a petty revenge, and it really set John's jaw grinding. What kind of person would force someone into an uncomfortable situation, especially one they weren't used to?
The pain hadn't had the least negative effect on Sherlock's erection. It was straining out from his body, and as John looked, it twitched slightly. The flushed head was exposed and dripping precome into a tiny little slick puddle underneath him on the sheets. John grinned and ran the crop up the length of it, and Sherlock whimpered and tried to thrust against it. John swiped the crop through the sticky precome leaking from his cock and then brought it up to his face to rub it along his cheek, smearing the thick fluid across his skin.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, and John's blush continued to suffuse his face, right up to the tips of his ears, which glowed like beacons. It was fascinating to watch, and it almost distracted Sherlock from the information he was learning from this.
“Hello,” I said, putting on my most charming smile. “We’re here for the couples retreat this weekend and wanted to know if there were any events in town.”
It was around 6 that he and Gladstone went to dig through the dumpster behind the local pub. If John was lucky, he'd sometimes find half-eaten burgers or leftover fries.
Sherlock immediately ducked down to crouch next to the body. Mid-50's man with obvious cholesterol problems who had been viciously stabbed several times in the back with... a very small, thin edged object. Probably a nail file. But the stabs were very shallow and superficial. They weren't what had killed the victim.
The two of them chatted amiably for a short while as John made his way toward the stables. Greg seemed like a good sort, and John actually wouldn't mind a travelling companion.
One of the store's managers came to stand over the shoulder of the cashier. Seemingly emboldened, the cashier stood up straighter.
The man frowned, then tipped his head to the side. "I know you, you're the chap always sitting with that big German Shepherd at the corner."
John carried on with his day as usual, sitting in his usual spot and carrying on his usual hobby of people-watching. But that was the day that John saw the most unusual of people pop up out of the crowd and come closer.
Sherlock was shining the light from his mobile at the barrels and muttering to himself. John followed and looked down at the barrels as well. They were all stamped with their manufacturer and the date on the ends. Most of them, John recognized as local London beers, and one Cornish cider. However, the one in the corner made him frown.
Well, second thing was to go visit Mr. Fielding in the hospital again. This would be infinitely more trying without John, but needs must. He wanted to take a taxi, but there was no way to direct it without coming across as a complete nutter. He wished that John was with him again, and decided that he would take transit.
But Sherlock didn't want to stop. In fact, his entire body seemed to be thrumming with the need to be in John's arms again.
“Yes, I’ll meet you at the fountain in the garden once I find Xavier,” Malcolm said. “We’ll both be there.”
"I thought it was obvious," Sherlock said, in a slight endorphin daze from being so close to John, and his warmth, and delicious John scent. "I want you to stay with me as long as possible."
Sherlock could hear John and the other alpha arguing through the door and groaned low in his throat. The primal part of Sherlock thrilled with pleasure. Two alphas were fighting over him, and he stifled a mewl with the back of his hand. There was a part of him that wanted to simply open the door to incite them to further confrontation.
There was a noise on the stairs, and Gladstone bounded up them, looking all sleek and clean as well. John knelt down the hug her, and she wagged her tail. Two people followed her up the stairs.
Sherlock snorted and rolled over. He knew who Shakespeare was, which was good enough for the spirit of British pride, wasn't it?
Sherlock let this all out in one breath. Then realized that he’d gone and done what he always did: spewed out someone’s life story when they hadn’t asked him to.
“I don’t take much stock in celebrities,” Sherlock snorted. “I don’t believe half the stories I’ve heard.”
"Shush, Lestrade, don't bother my network," Sherlock said, waving a hand in his direction. "Why don't you sit down, John."
Sherlock wandered in to look in the oven, although there was no possibility of the biscuits being done yet.
He got up sedately, and had a wander around the kitchen, just running his fingers over the crop again and again as he waited. In truth, the waiting was probably just as torturous for him as it was for Sherlock. But he had more patience, could wait for an entire day if it would only make Sherlock more pliant, more desperate for him at the end of the wait.
Before he could answer, one of the chemistry professors came in and asked after Sherlock’s graduate thesis draft. Sherlock glared over the professor’s shoulder as Wilkes hastily left.
Sherlock made a small noise in his throat and hunched down further. John chuckled and came to sit next to him.
"Who has not wak'd to list the busy sounds of summer morning, in the sultry smoke of noisy London?" Sherlock replied.
And tripped. Sherlock stumbled, and his dart flew off into some high corner and disappeared. Sherlock squinted after it and saw it stuck next to the exit sign.
Sherlock blinked rapidly, but did as he was told, managing to get an arm around John's shoulder without being too awkward about it. However, he was still noticeably stiff against John's side. John nudged at Sherlock with his hip as a reminder, and Sherlock visibly attempted to relax, leaning back into John.
"Be well aware," Sherlock suddenly said. "Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke: The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde."
