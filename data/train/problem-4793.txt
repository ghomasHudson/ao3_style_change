The bright light hid Steve from sight again and seconds later the dragon stood in his place. He bent down and Tony climbed on the long neck, his butt resting on Steve's shoulders. He wrapped his arms around the neck and held on tightly.
‘I want two hundred and a good reason,’ Steve said, looking once again at the painting, like it was the most fascinating thing he had seen in his life.
‘If I was wrong and it’s a hot girl, I’ll gladly take over from you,’ Rhodey said. ‘We’ll come up with an excuse.’
Fury coughed to get their attention. ‘If you can manage to listen for a little longer, thank you very much. I want you to start training together, starting today. You can use the gym here in the building and in the basement is a practice room where you can use your powers and go all out. Find out about each other’s strengths and weaknesses, so you can help each other out in the field.’
Tony flew to the Shield headquarters and demanded to see Nick Fury. Shield was an intelligence and security organization and Tony was officially working for them. He didn’t get paid, he was a billionaire, he didn’t need it, but Shield offered him protection when he was doing his duties as Iron Man. They sent field agents to help him out and cleaned up after him. Officially Tony was the bodyguard of Nick Fury, director of Shield, but in real life things worked out a little differently. Being a ‘bodyguard’ had saved him from getting banished though.
‘I’ll put on the suit and I’ll do it, you make sure you stay far away with your doggies and be safe,’ Tony sighed.
Tony flew up the stairs. At the top he stepped into a big, white room, with a lot of light. It was so bright that Tony had to let his eyes adjust for a moment. The entire castle was dark, but the ceiling of the tower was almost completely made of glass. Now that he could see again, Tony looked around. There was a desk with a chair, a bookshelf, a couch with big pillows, a coffee table, and a very big bed with curtains.
When the waitress left Steve remembered that he had to answer a question. ‘You asked how I know Pepper, but I don’t know who or what Pepper is,’ he confessed. Better to tell the truth.
Agents swarmed the place to check if the robot really was done for and to clean up. The press also turned up, taking pictures and filming the robot. Tony noticed them and shook his head.
'No problem,' said the man with a bright smile. 'Shall I carry the bags, then you can open the door.'
Tony blinked a few times, trying to understand what Clint was telling him. ‘Does that have anything to do with his true love’s kiss?’
'Stefanie, that guy today, have you seen him? The one with the leather jacket? He came to you a few nights ago.'
Steve walked into the living room and was surprised to see both Sam and Bucky watching television. There was some sort of sports game on and they were both so into it that they didn’t even notice Steve at first. Only when he took the beer from out of Sam’s hand and took a sip did his friend look up.
'I'm sure you look great in a negligee, but I'd be a terrible plumber,' Tony said. 'I'm afraid I can't make your secret fantasy come true.'
Steve snorted as he threw the banana peel in the bin. ‘You should have hired a star cook if you wanted sushi. What about spaghetti with meatballs instead?’
‘There is nothing wrong with Range Rovers,’ Steve laughed. ‘I’m not driving you around unless you admit that.’
'Yes, his wife is there as well and if it's just Rhodey and me she fears we'll only talk about our drunken days at MIT. So you have to come and keep me on reigns,' Tony laughed.
‘Anthony, you’re not going on a date with that guy,’ Obadiah said strictly. ‘You’ve had your fun, let’s go.’
Tony jumped up and got the bikes off Steve. He ignored his own scratches and kneeled down next to his boyfriend.
'No, no, don't worry about me, I made a few very stupid choices in my life,' Steve sighed. He told Olivia the story he had told Ronan. 'But I guess working for this guy isn't much better. He might protect me from clients, but who will protect us from him?'
By the end of the day Tony ended up on his couch, eating pizza, drinking too much beer, and watching television. He didn't even notice that Clint walked in, until the archer dropped down next to him on the couch.
Julia chuckled. 'Most new guys are nervous and we have to help them out. Within a week you walked around like you owned the place and became like a big sister to almost all of us. You helped us out so many times, I want to help you catch this asshole.'
Still Tony didn’t give up and started with the construction of the wings. He formed the outlines, making sure he could attach feathers everywhere, so there wouldn't be any holes. He made the wings big, really big, with several leather bands he could tie around his arms. Proudly he looked at his own work. He might be ten, but he was a smart boy, his teachers told him so very often.
They ended up with a camp site. Steve set up the tent. He had only one air bed, but he promised Tony he could have it, if Steve could have the pillow. Tony could only agree.
‘I had the most orgasmic pastry ever, but it’s been a few hours, so I can eat,’ Tony said as he entered the kitchen and sat down at the table. ’What’s for dinner?’
'Captain, no time to adjust, we need you,' Fury said. 'A robot has attacked New York. Follow this agent. Your uniform and shield are ready. Get changed, we'll drop you off with a helicopter.'
‘Sorry, I couldn’t help but overhear,’ a familiar voice said, and once again Clint dropped from the vents.
Steve had often been sick as a child, so he couldn't go outside much. It had been a miracle they met that day. Or maybe it was meant to be. Jarvis took him to Steve's home and they played there. Or when Steve couldn't get out of bed Tony would read him stories or they'd watch a movie.
‘Stop yelling at my door and come in already,’ Tony shouted from inside. When Rhodey walked in, Tony came out of his bathroom. ‘I’m not that much of an ass that I would forget about your date. I still don’t know why I agreed to this.’
‘Then are you here to gloat?’ Tony asked. ‘Because I can have any person I want, you know that, right? I just chose to be a disgusting engineer for now.’
‘This is….’ Tony started as he looked at the drawing. ‘…just fucking perfect! I don’t think it could be made of iron in real life, he’d need something stronger, but this is something an engineer could actually build. This is going to inspire all those kiddies to build cool robots! Work this out into something bigger and we’re going to use it everywhere!  Steve, great job.’
When Mauro opened the door Tony  pulled his tie straight, stood up straight, and followed the baker into the room. Seven contestants stood behind big workbenches, eagerly watching the door to see who would enter the room. Tony smirked a little when he heard the gasps. He loved the attention. He took his place next to Buddy and smiled at the contestants and the cameras.
'I'll try to find out more about him. Her. I'm confused about this. Him, I guess,' Tony said. 'What does she look like?'
Steve dropped his backpack and peeked into the car as well. It looked pretty bad. Overheated motor, but there was probably more damage, it was hard to see with the smoke.
‘Well, he is nice,’ Steve defended himself. ‘And he doesn’t look half bad. I’m just going to give it a try. I know you’ll be there with a box of tissues and a pile of corny DVD’s if he breaks my heart.’
'Why do you think he doesn't want you?' Steve asked. 'You fought with Natasha and you could keep up with her pretty well. You're strong and fast. I'd want you on my team if I were him.'
‘I did,’ Steve said. ‘You told me to hurry. Is this about my contract ending next week? Because I knew that was coming. I really enjoyed working here and I’m already searching for another job.’
‘You know, when I heard the alarm go off, I really didn’t expect some tiny guy stealing my fruit,’ a voice said from behind him. Steve almost choked on the banana. He quickly turned around and found the owner of the penthouse standing there, his arms crossed, a smirk on his face.
After that kiss Tony had given Steve a piggy back ride to the car. It had been the first and last time he had been able to do that. Tony went to MIT after that summer, so he could only see Steve during breaks. Tony remembered how he hardly recognized his own boyfriend when he came back weeks later. Same face, but Steve had grown taller than Tony and he had gotten a lot of muscles. He had looked so happy and healthy. He had grown from adorable to super hot. Of course they called each other every week, but the sneaky bastard had kept it a secret, to surprise Tony.
‘It sounds too good to be true,’ Steve said unsure. ‘You know what, I’ve got nothing to lose, even if this is just a thing to stall time before the cops are here. I’ll take the job. Food and money. It would be stupid to say no to that.’ He took another bite of his banana.
Steve laughed. 'There aren't many big cities in New Zealand. And more importantly, you miss out on a lot of fun things if you drive past all the villages. If I had a car I would go to all those little places that other tourists miss out on!'
His company, Stark Industries, was taking over the world. Whatever kind of machine you needed, you could buy one with the Stark Industries name on it. About 60 per cent of all computer, phones, laptops and tablets that were sold were from Tony’s company. But they also produced laundry machines, hair dryers, microwaves and televisions. There were engineers that dedicated their time to creating hospital equipment and they even had a department for mechanical limbs. Tony’s stuff was sold all over the world and his factories were everywhere, giving people in many different countries jobs with proper payment.
'Alright, I'll take it,' Tony said. 'I bet you fifty bucks I'm faster on running shoes than you are in heels. Oh, Ronan is handcuffed, his guards are brought outside. One of them is on the floor, he's not moving. Some sexy redhead worked him to the ground.'
'Hi,' Tony answered. 'Could have known you were Sam's friend. You're both too nice for your own good.'
‘Maybe she just made a mistake and she meant you’re great for her,’ Tony said, a frown on his face. ‘Just go, and if it’s a guy you tell him ‘sorry mate, Pepper made a mistake’ and you leave again.’
'Are two playmates not enough for you?' Steve scolded the dog. The animal immediately started licking his face.
For a moment James stood still to look at him, but then he nodded. ‘Yeah, sorry, I guess that text was a bit unclear, I just didn’t know how to tell you. I still don’t know how to tell you.’
Tony put the mug in the kitchen, stepped in his shoes and walked to Sam's door. He had already knocked when he remembered he looked like crap. His hair was a mess, there were unidentified stains on his clothes and he hadn't tied his shoes. He just hoped he would look rough and cool, instead of sleep deprived and generally hobo-like. Tony gave a toothy grin when Sam opened the door.
‘Maybe we should split up,’ Tony said, looking around in the huge hall. The insides of the castle didn’t look medieval at all. Retro, yes but not medieval, there was electricity. All a bit old fashioned, but maybe seventy years ago was the last time they redecorated.
'I have six new identities ready, all we need are pictures,' Clint butted in. 'So we can get two more if we want to.'
‘Technically, I got another date out of him,’ Rhodey said. ‘Since you were acting like you were me.’
‘I’ll take a look at what they got, you check if the spark plugs are affected,’ Steve said. He walked into the house and searched through the room where they kept all kind of equipment. Eventually he found some boxes with car parts on top of a shelf. Everything that looked useful he brought back to Tony.
It was late and most people of the night shift had left, the morning shift had taken over, so it was a surprise to see Steve sitting in the changing room. He was leaning against his locker with his eyes closed, but when he heard the door he sat up.
And they really did work, because a few minutes later the motor started again. Steve beckoned the others to come outside again, while Tony took his place behind the wheel. Clint had a hard time saying goodbye again to the doggies, but Natasha dragged him outside. They all got in the car and Tony drove them to the airport.
'Poor you, all alone,' Tony said, winking at Steve. 'Need me to keep you company until he gets back?'
Steve took a deep breath and pulled his shirt straight. He could stay a little longer and see how things would work out. For Bucky of course. If things didn’t work out with the girl he would still have a backup date. Steve knew he was being stupid. This guy was his type, the dark hair, the way he carried himself, those clothes, Steve wasn’t sure if he could handle seeing Bucky date this man. He wasn’t the jealous type, but this could definitely make him jealous. Maybe this guy was an asshole. That was totally possible, maybe this would be a terrible date.
Genius billionaire Tony Stark, owner of one of the biggest companies in the country and self-proclaimed best engineer of the world, was living in a town house. A terraced house, linked houses, row houses, he was living in a house that was squashed in between two other houses that looked exactly the same. Never in his life had he lived in a place like this, but it was his own fault that he had ended up here.
Now all he had to do was act natural. Like everyone else he stepped into one of the elevators. He got himself in a corner in the far back as they moved to a different floor. The penthouse was on the top of the tower. Of course this elevator wasn’t going to get him there, but Steve would go up as far as possible. Once he got there he would figure out what to do next.
'Rhodey! My man, my love, honey bear, you're back. We should celebrate, let's go for a drink, my treat, as always,' Tony rambled as he got off his chair and approached his friend. 'Tell me everything! Are those new weapons really that crappy? Please tell me Hammer did a horrible job. I need to hear it, I need some good news!'
Then Tony tried one big wing-like piece of cloth. They built a construction where the wind would go under the wing, pushing it up in the sky. Tony made a metal frame he could hold, making sure he stayed under the wing as well. At the first try the cloth ripped. They made a stronger version that broke apart, and a third version that refused to go up in the sky.
‘Can’t blame you for doing the same stupid thing I did,’ Tony said. ‘We go from James and James to no James at all.’
'Both of us?' Steve asked surprised. Most of the time Tony and Rhodey would go for a beer together. Steve was fine with that, they had their own friends. He would just steal Bucky from Natasha and go out for a beer as well.
‘Have you even called your crew to ready your plane?’ Clint asked. ‘Because if you didn’t, we’re not flying anytime soon. I’m not going to wait hours to wait for permission to depart and sleep in an uncomfortable chair when I can sleep in a bed.’
'Alright, now that everyone is here I like to start,' Fury said to a bunch of very loud people. 'As most of you know you're the only super heroes allowed at the moment. All of you together will be team New York, you'll be the official protectors of this city.'
'You're my hero too and I handled it!' Clint protested. 'Even if he heard or saw what was going on, he could at least listen to what you have to say.'
‘Yes sir, his name is Steven Grant Rogers and everything he has told you so far is true,’ a voice from the ceiling said.
'Bucky talked to him,' Sam said. 'Told him everything he needed to know. He also said he really enjoyed working with you.'
'Hey, Sam, my neighbor, my friend, my man, I ran out of coffee and desperately need some. Do you have some for me? Please?'
‘Thanks Stevie, you’re the best! Just act like you’re me, so I have a backup when things don’t work out with my colleague’ Bucky said as he jumped up and happily walked out of the kitchen.
Sam's mouth fell open. He looked at his friend, to make sure Steve wasn't kidding and then he started laughing.
'She believed him,’ Bucky said. 'I know she did. I think we need to try one more guy. We need a bigger chance that some of them want to testify in court. It won't be the first time we have four witnesses and no one who can actually help us to lock the bad guys away.'
‘No jacket,’ Rhodey said. ‘If you’re taking her for yourself, you still owe me 274 favors and I will make you clean my house. I’m not kidding here, Tony, you’re not going to steal a girl away from me, you did that too many times already.’
'He's the one with the super blond wig, it's almost white. He likes to wear purple lipstick and always picks huge earrings,' Steve explained. 'You'll recognize him and otherwise you can ask me.'
‘I tried to steal your stuff,’ Steve clarified, because it seemed like Tony had forgotten about the breaking in.
With both his parents gone Steve was an orphan and he would have to go to the same orphanage as Bucky. Tony didn't like it. Not at all. He had promised to take care of Steve, but now Steve was send to an orphanage! He was sixteen, why couldn't he live on his own? Steve could take care of himself, he had done so for months.
'Okay, thank you,' Steve said. He took one last look at the room, which was decorated in the same colors as the club. There was a bed, a couch, a chair, a table with champagne, some glasses and a bowl filled with condoms. That was it. It made a shiver run down Steve's spine.
And then there was Steve, the reason why Tony couldn't concentrate. Steve was their graphic designer, hired specifically for this project by Pepper. It was like she was giving Tony a present for coming up with this amazing project, because Steve was fucking hot. He was tall, had blond hair that looked really soft, full lips that made you wanna bite them (or maybe that was just Tony), and a body...oh Tony could talk about that body for hours.
'I work hard to keep it in shape,' Steve grinned. 'And I actually came here for you today.  I still have a week off, but it's your last day here and we have a bet running.'
'Stefanie, come to my office,' she said, before closing the door to the dressing room behind her. All the guys looked at Steve, who shrugged and got up.
‘The new black one I bought a few weeks ago, of course,’ Steve said. ‘I’m not completely stupid when it comes to clothes.’
'How are we going to do this?' Tony asked. The sled was barely big enough for all of them, and he wasn't sure the dogs could pull them all.
Tony never knew how Steve managed, but a week later Rhodey got a phone call. They would still break up, but whenever he was in town he could see his kids and have them stay with him. Steve had worked his magic.
'In my defense, I was an in the closet gay teenager with no friends. Captain America was wearing booty shorts as he punched Hitler in the face, it was a turn on,' Tony defended himself. 'But I’ll be a good boy and cheer the real one up. Or at least make him stop pouting and come with us.'
‘What the hell?’ Tony asked. ‘No, I’m not your true love. There is no such thing as true love. Can you let go of me already?’
‘You’re working on the ambulance?’ he asked. ‘How come I haven’t seen you before if you’ve been here for half a year already? We should have bumped into each other by now, and I’m pretty sure I would have remembered you if we did.’
So Tony waited. Sam was only in the office once a week, for their meetings, but he was always early. He and Steve would talk a little, about their war experiences or something, Tony didn’t know, but he did know they always grabbed some coffee while having their little chat. Yes, Tony had been spying on them, and no, not because he was jealous. Okay, maybe because he was a little jealous, he wanted to make Steve laugh like that. Steve’s smile was almost as pretty as his rear side.
Clint was surprised by that answer. Steve had been a nice guy, this didn't seem to be like him. Was Captain America secretly an asshole? Hero by day, villain by night? No, that just couldn’t be. His voice didn’t sound good, it was more like he was sick.
Steve wasn’t lucky. Apparently the important people had decided to stay home. They weren’t interested in art like this, or maybe it was the lack of press and attention that made them stay away. But with no really interesting people around, Steve decided to take a look at the art, before he would try to sneak out. If he could figure out what his classmate’s art made it worthy of a gallery, he could maybe make some changes in his own work.
'You're not secretly in love with me, are you? You have hearts in your eyes again,' Olivia said, looking into Steve's eyes. 'Because I'm sleeping with guys, but I'm into girls, so you don't stand a chance.'
When Tony finally reached the finish line, Steve was waiting, a big grin on his face. He wasn't sweating, not even panting, while Tony was completely out of breath. He lay down in the grass to catch his breath.
my eyes, so he wouldn't know what Deadpool meant. “Well.. They looked a bit.. bloody?” I swallowed hard and st
“They're on their way,” Daredevil stated, still distant, but he'd moved behind Deadpool. Closer, but with more of a chance to get away if needed. It was how they operated sometimes. If things could get insane at a moment's notice, Deadpool would step up and assess the danger and then Peter would try and remove it while Daredevil kept watch.
For the part of SHIELD, Fury supported me. They stepped in and made sure that the Tower was kept secure. Phil even stopped by to make sure that I was recovering well. My healing factor isn't as perfect (badass) as Wolverine's so it's been taking way too much time. I really just want to get healed and go back to what I was doing before I got blown up.
I cleared my throat.  “You may be wondering why I've called you here.”  I began in my best Hawkeye from MASH impression.  “Years ago, something dastardly happened and an evil corporation had a dastardly plan...”  Hey, I couldn't very well follow what Hawkeye had said in the series.  This wasn't a mystery novel.  I was quite ready to continue in that impression, it made things easier, when I heard a familiar sing songy voice as the door was thrown open.  “Honey~~ I'm home~~~~~!!!!”  Deadpool.  Everyone besides Matt and Phil tensed and groaned in preparation for the merc with a mouth annoyance.  Deadpool bound across the room, holding a paper bag and a handful of flowers.  He pushed Tony out of the way, getting right up to me.  “I heard what happened, Petey-pie so I brought you get well presents!”  His voice sounded sympathetic but animated as he dropped the bag and flowers on my lap.
I slipped my web-shooters on. 'Complete.' I smirked to myself with a small flutter of adrenaline bubbling up inside of me. It was then that I knew exactly what I was going to do.
Before too long, my body felt like it was on fire. Every cell felt like it was melting. My blood felt like it was liquid fire and screams and whimpers of pain were ripping through my throat like Wolverine's adamantium claws ripped through everything.
I hated to admit it, but when Steve came up and told me that I'd be staying in the Tower for a while, it made me feel relieved. I didn't feel ready to face the world as Peter Parker or Spider-Man. At least I didn't have to go to school. (Tony made sure to get everything I needed online though so… that part sucked.)
I took that as a compliment, especially during this time. 'Devious' was in these days. I don't know about anyone else, but
I'd forgotten that Wade had been through a place like this already. “It'll be okay, Wade,” I whisper, trying to comfort him. “I won't let them hurt you.”
One of the guards gripped my shirt and pulled me with him. I staggered to my feet, grimacing as my wrists gave a particularly nasty throb. “Peter!”
I have no idea how I managed to write this chapter.  I've been so distracted with my other works that this one (which is also my very first, sadly) has been set aside many times over.  So~ 'tis a miracle to have a second chapter up so soon.  Hopefully I'll be getting back into the action scenes sometime soon.
“Parker,” someone says, and I look. It's a man in a dark suit, expensive. I know it must've cost a fortune since I've seen something from that brand in Tony's line of costly wear. “I've been waiting for you.”
Coming up: Peter has to spill his guts (not literally, but perhaps he would prefer it at this point).
I swallowed a little and nodded as I put the comm in my ear before pulling over my mask. Bucky clapped shoulder and grinned. “Go get 'em, kid.”
He looked so crushed that he couldn’t do anything to help so I asked for a few tacos, which he was more than happy to dash out and get me, despite the disapproving gazes of my family. As he said, “What don’t late night tacos fix?” It made me laugh. I can always count on him to lighten up the atmosphere.
He was on his feet as soon as they pulled me to the door. “Petey!” he cried as a guard pushed him back to shut the cell door.
Tony sputtered, red faced and Steve just blinked in shock. Clint's jaw was hanging open and Natasha and Bruce just raised amused eyebrows. Bucky's face was schooled in a way that I recognized. 'Hide your thoughts and just act.'
“Nobody hurt Peter, Wade,” Steve asserted, sending him a look. Tony snorted and avoided Steve's eyes when he looked back at him.
“Do you… still want me?”  I ask, ashamed as my voice cracks at the end with fear.  That seems to snap everyone out of their shock.  “God, Peter, of course we do.”  Tony is quick to reassure and stumbles over his own tongue.  “Peter, we love you and this doesn't change that at all.”  Steve smiles softly at me.  “Yes, it does.”  We turn to look at Clint.  “You totally can't lose on purpose anymore when we spar.  I want to kick your ass fair and square.”  I can't help but crack a smile at that, neither can anyone else.  “Language!”  Steve snaps at Clint, but it's too soft to do anything but make us laugh.
“Hey there, Sweetie,” I crooned softly. She had blonde hair and eyes that made me think of Gwen. I held out my hand to her. “Is there anyone else here?”
I let out a breath I didn't even know I'd been holding. 'Thank fu-frick for that.' Not that Steve could read minds, it's just that sometimes it looked like he could read minds. That was supported by the fact that he narrowed his eyes a little, brows furrowing as he looked at me.
“Peter, listen to me. It's okay, you're okay,” Matt tries again. I want to laugh, because it doesn't feel okay. I'm so emotionally worn out from being being terrified, from being in pain.
The realization doesn't stop it, however. In spite of everything, Deadpool can always make me feel better. He was there when I panicked about moving into Avengers Tower. He was there when the day Uncle Ben died came around.
My wrists throbbed making me wince. I shook them as if I were shaking off water, but it didn't do anything for the pain.
“Clint and Nat ran into Doc Ock and Sabertooth and things got a bit out of hand,” Steve explained. I leaned back from Steve in shock, nearly falling out of his arms. Bucky's hands found my back and kept me from spilling out onto the floor.
“Who the fuck hurt Petey-pie?” Deadpool asked as he walked in from the elevator. He was followed closely by Daredevil who looked serious.
“So, green peppers, onions, and carrots okay in your omelet? Steve's making biscuits and Bucky's…” Tony looked at Bucky with a critical eye. “Bucky is lurking.”
“Thanks, Bucky,” I murmured to him. Bucky winked at me when Steve and Tony exchanged another look. 'Ninja.'
I want to say I remained calm, but that would be a lie. I feel like I dropped from a high rise the way my stomach swooped. I didn't freeze, persay. I just didn't move as fast as Steve would have liked, which was why he scooped me up in his arms and ran to the stairs.
Tony rolled his eyes, annoyed. “Yes, Deadpool. That's exactly what's going on.” Steve shot Tony a look. “Tony,” he hissed in warning. Tony sighed and shrugged, surrendering to his husband.
“It's okay, Petey-pie,” Deadpool murmurs in my ear, whispered. “We'll keep you safe.” He always seemed to have a certain amount of clarity in the most serious of situations when I was afraid. Matt always knew too, but Matt wasn't the one talking to voices in his head like Wade did. So these moments.. It made it a lot easier to close my eyes with a deep breath, letting go.
“Lucky~” I stepped into the light and hesitantly began to pull my gloves off, holding onto them with my mouth so I could outstretch my arms and flip over my hands. Wrists facing upwards, I was finally able to see.
“Lunch is ready,” Jarvis informed me. “Also Sir wishes to tell you that if you don't get down there, he's eating all the bacon.”
My fingers found their way underneath the reinforced spandex polymer and scratched against both wrists. I was starting to resemble a Chinese finger puzzle. Except it was both hands. And my own suit was the puzzle.
I paused as another gust of wind made me rock on my feet. 'Wait… 'city traffic'? 'March wind?' What…' I forced my eyes open with an unusual level of difficulty.
Sadly being blown up does not excuse you from homework. Or chores. Ultimately I wasn't grounded persay, but they are checking in on me way too many times for comfort. It's only 7am and I've already had half the team come and see if I'm “doing okay” which is adult speak for “we just want to make sure you're still there”. I don't hate their attention, but
I could see bits of the wall, crumbled on the floor. The furniture was upended, now that I actually looked more around at the common room. My favorite spot on the couch was smoldering from laser discharge. 'Fucking asshole,' I cursed Goblin.
I had been so pissed off that SHIELD could actually allow the alien symbiote to escape. Goddamnit! But injured or no, Venom still needed to be stopped before it had the chance to snack on anyone, so I'd webbed my injuries and set a plan in motion.
I blink. “What the actual fuck?” I blink again, but it doesn't change anything. “Did you seriously just..?” I raise my arm and what the hell, Deadpool had handcuffed us together.
I eye it with suspicion, like it would sudden come alive and bite me. It looks like it could be poison, so I figure my reasoning isn't that crazy. Aching stomach, I take it and sip slowly. It's bitter and slightly tangy, which somehow bothers me. It also doesn't taste like any soup I've ever had, kind of… 'Medicinal?'
Steve’s held his breath. For a few seconds he stood still, until someone bumped into him. He couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe that Tony Stark was waiting for him. Steve ran towards the other man and wrapped his arms around him. Tony grinned widely as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist in return.
Tony had to stop himself from walking over to his crush and smack his ass. They were in a meeting and Pepper was there, for whatever reason.  He had to stop thinking about those firm and round buns in Steve’s very skinny jeans. Tony couldn’t really focus on the rest of the meeting. Finances and lists of possible school  projects couldn’t keep his attention. To stop himself from thinking about Steve’s ass, Tony tried to think about Iron Man. It was a really interesting idea. He should do something with it. Maybe he could actually build a replica? Of course he could build a metallic suit of armor, he was Tony fucking Stark, he could do anything. He was going to build Iron Man. Steve would probably like it.
‘The soup kitchen is too far away,’ Steve said, while trying to show Tony his best puppy eyes. ‘I can’t walk that far and I have no money for the subway. I tried to sneak into the subway a few times, but they know a lot of homeless people try to get a free ride, so they check tickets all the time. I can’t go there anymore.’
Steve rolled his eyes. 'Don't make it your mission to find out if she's single tonight. I already embarrassed myself enough for one day, I can't deal with any more than this.'
Steve didn’t have time to answer, because a voice came from his radio. They had to get on their way to an incident where someone might have been shot.
Steve chuckled. 'I did, yes. But I didn't steal them. I got them from the people in the village, close to where I live.'
‘My date went very well, it was just perfect, Rhodey-bear,’ Tony sighed happily. ‘It was just coffee, but James is just amazing. I could stare at him all day and not get tired of the view. He looks better than those old Greek statues. A real piece of art.’
A few weeks passed by and he did crave donuts a few times, but he never had time to get them himself, so he sent a guy to get some at a nearby shop. Not as good, but they would do. He almost forgot the taste of Steve's donuts, until he got a call from the reception desk.
It wasn't too difficult to start the engine again. It only took them half an hour and they spend twenty five minutes searching for the problem and only five minutes to actually fix it. It had looked way worse last night, with all the smoke coming out.
Tony held his hand on Steve's back and pushed him. It worked, Steve was going up again. But the path got smaller and smaller and soon their pedals hit each other, their wheels crashed against each other and the two boys ended up on the ground.
Sam rolled his eyes, but let Tony in anyway. Sam walked to the kitchen, but Tony stopped in the living room, where mister muscly angel was sitting. The blond looked up and smiled when he noticed Tony.
Steve came home after a long day at work, only to find Tony sitting on the couch, staring at nothing. Steve dropped his bag and hurried to sit down next to his husband.
‘I hope you get to do a lot more ambulance night shifts in the near future,’ Tony said as he put on his coat. He hooked his arm in Steve’s and pulled him towards the exit. ‘Because that sounds absolutely amazing.’
‘He’s probably somewhere where there’s food around,’ Sam said. ‘I’ll check the shops, you check the offices?’
Steve had trouble holding Redwing, so he put the budgie on his head, where he happily made himself a little nest out of Steve’s hair.
‘You’re officially registered as a body guard,’ Clint said. ‘So you can go outside in your armor without getting arrested and thrown over the border. Everyone wants to be your sidekick.’
'I wasn't planning on kissing you until we had a date in New York,' Tony whined. 'Now I'm addicted! How can I go a month without that? You know I...'
‘There is something we’ve been looking for for a long time,’ Fury started. ‘Some agents found it, but they died on the mission and couldn’t report back to us. We don’t know exactly what is there, but we need it. You might be the only one who could get it for us, Stark.’
Oh, shoot me now. Glory be. Praise the pasta. Anything. If I wasn't awake before, I certainly was now. Awake and eager to swing through the city. “Oh Hell yes!” I could hear Fury cough a little. It sounded like he was more amused than annoyed by my outburst.
'Like Hell,' I swore, tearing at the symbiote's control. Freedom meant people would be hurt. Freedom meant people would die. 'I am Spider-Man,' I mentally told the symbiote, 'and I don't let bad guys win.'
I pout.  I know I shouldn't but damnit, I hate this place.  Tony and Clint snicker.  Of course those two would.  They hate this place as much as I do.  I've heard about how many times they land themselves in the Medbay.  I glare at them.  “Just remember the next time you get laid up, I'm going to laugh.”  I can't help but feel a certain sense of accomplishment as everyone laughs at those two as they look offended.
“Avengers. Tower.” Deadpool hisses with a dangerous tone, idly fingering one of his guns. The agents flinched away with a nod and a 'yes, sir'.
The sight that greeted my eyes made me shiver as I ignored arms shifting me and holding me against a warm body.
My eyes shot back to Deadpool. “Don't! I'll be okay,” I tried to reassure him. “I'll be back soon,” I promised him.
“Spidey? Petey-pie, you alive?” Deadpool asked, a tone of worry in his voice. It made me frown. I was fine, right? Just had a bit of a headache.
The call dies and I throw my phone on the bed in favor of a quick, hot shower. My back, where I got burned, aches just a tad, but it's nothing compared to the pain when I first got blown up. I'm Spidey. I deal.
“Wade~~ I'm fine.  Just a little winded--” I promptly ignoring Matt's scoff of disbelief as I downplayed my injuries.  Hey, I'd had worse.  “Nothing two days of rest here in the Medbay can't fix.”  Even Phil raised an eyebrow at that statement.  Seriously?  I do have accelerated healing.  I'm badass too.  Okay, so I felt more like a child remembering that my family was crowded around in the room.  I huffed and rolled my eyes.  I was happy when Wade remembered I was hurt and quickly jumped out of the hug.  “Ohmygod, did I hurt you Petey!?”  I shook my head, laughing softly.  “Nah, I'm good.”  Wade looked a bit like 'yeah right, like I believe that' behind his mask, but it was hard to tell.  Damn masks.
Warm liquid fell on my head. It wasn't wet like water. It was…. Kind of gooey. And I really had wanted to forget that feeling. A pathetic whine slipped through my mouth as the hybrid stretched over my skin, giving me goosebumps.
“That was lame...” I hear Wade mutter in the background. I thought it was aptly fitting. ...Noted, we don't have any tacos right now, and I think I just heard Wade's stomach growl, but still… What else was I supposed to say? Maniac 1 & 2?
Turns out the arrival of spies/assassins with demands for sonic equipment raises a lot of flags. Not that Fury wouldn't know if they were more subtle. Oh, he'd definitely know. Still, having Fury
Tony marched straight up to Bruce and I and his lips curved downwards in a thoughtful frown as Bruce showed him my wrists.
I didn't need to look at Matt to know that he wanted to reprimand me as much as he wanted to worry over me.  I was sure that my face was red with embarrassment and shame.  I muttered apologies under my breath sure that Matt would hear them anyways.  “So...” the voices of Tony and Steve reminded me of their presence.  “What are those?  Why do you know Daredevil?  Why are you calling Phil Phil?”  And there was Tony's rambling.  Honestly, I was slightly surprised he didn't interrupt earlier.  “Tony,” Steve scolded him, “calm down.”  Clint's voice picked up.  “Actually Steve, I want to know the answers too.”  My gaze swept the Avengers and they were nodding agreement, even Steve was.  'Oh boy.'  I exchanged glances with Phil and (well not exchanged, but I looked at) Matt.
Of course it was Tony. I swear ever since he and Steve adopted me, he's been more like a crazy uncle than a dad at times. Because I'd met them as Spider-Man I could never bring myself to call them 'Dad', but they didn't seem to mind. I did call Tony 'the crazy uncle' at times.
'We should get out of here,' he said.  'We don't want the press to make a picture of you like this. Want a ride? I'll fly you back to the headquarters.'
The only reply get got was a sob. Tony pulled over and parked the car. The last time Steve cried was when his mother died. This was serious and Tony knew why. He tightly wrapped his arms around his husband.
'Sam, we need to protect these guys,' Tony said as he walked into the office. 'They're not going to make anything official if we can't protect them. New ID's, new place to live, a new background, the whole shebang!'
‘Maybe you shouldn’t have named a white and blue parakeet Redwing,’ Steve joked as he checked his balcony. The only bird there was a fat pigeon, no budgie. ‘Sorry, he isn’t here. Are your windows still open? He might come back on his own.’
But thankfully, after two days of breaking his head on this ass problem, his best friend Rhodey walked into his office.
‘I’m a businessman and the company is doing pretty well,’ Tony started explaining. ‘So my friend advised me to invest in art. I didn’t know people who buy art have their own culture. It actually takes time to get taken serious in their world. Seeing as I got invited to this crappy opening I don’t think they take me very serious yet.’
'Your mother was a princess,' Steve started his explanation. 'The king became royalty by marrying her. I only know what my mom told me, but she said he wanted power and married the princess because of that reason alone. He became a prince, but when he didn't get his personal dragon he was angry. Also because, apparently, your mother and her dragon were great friends, maybe even lovers, I'm not sure. He killed the dragon when he was in his human form. Your mother was devastated, the dragons were furious. When the dragons came to talk about it, your father attacked them. The dragons didn't want to give up the bond with the humans, so they sent me. Not as a baby, your father might have killed me. That's why I came to you when I was ten. I had seen you before and my mother had explained me everything I had to do. But it had to be secret. Your father did try to capture me a few times. He let the guards wait until you were inside and they attacked as soon as you were out of sight. I always got away. Burned a few of the guards though.'
'Thank you for taking the time to come here,' said the man. 'We want our contestants to make pastries in only 60 minutes. We'd like you to give them a very vague order, anything is fine, ask them to make you something you like. They’ll actually have to think of a reason why they make a certain pastry. Afterwards you get to hear those reasons and you can try all the pastries. Together with Buddy Valastro, the head baker and host of the show, you decide who wins this challenge.'
Tony dreamed a little longer about the hot blond baker, until all the donuts were gone. He couldn't linger in the past, it was just a silly crush. So he went back to work and forgot about Steve Rogers.
‘Of course I’ll pay!’ Tony said, almost insulted, but Rhodey wasn’t listening. He just pushed Tony out of the door, handed him his car keys, and made him hurry up. He couldn’t be late!
‘Tell me first why you’re here already,’ Steve said. ‘You said you had a shot with this girl, why aren’t you at her place right now?’
Tony had skipped school, no matter how angry his parents were going to be. That day he had promised himself he would do anything to make sure Steve would never have to cry anymore.
'I tried to make it look sophisticated,' Linda defended her work. 'Something you could give to your business partners during a meeting.'
‘Stop talking,’ Bucky said. ‘You liked this guy and you had a great time last Friday. Don’t try to tell me otherwise, Nat told me so. You can do another date for me, until I can make a decision. You’re a great friend Steve, you’d never disappoint any of us.’
‘No, no, you can’t,’ Steve said as he sat down, Sam’s beer still in his hand. ‘I had to go on this date for you, and if things didn’t work out with your colleague, you would take over. You have to figure out if you want to date her by tomorrow, because you have a coffee date on Sunday.’
When about an hour had passed Steve sat a little closer to Jack, touched his arm when he talked and put his hand on his knee. The other guys noticed they weren't going to get any from Stefanie, so they left or turned to Lauren.
'No, I think you're cute,' Tony said. 'Okay, yeah, Captain America is hot, but, Steve Rogers is pretty cute as well. I wouldn't know which one I'd choose.'
'Go, have fun, make some friends,' Jarvis told Tony with a smile when they finally arrived at the playground.
'We could try again, see if the adoption agency changed their minds. We can totally have a child, we can find a way! If necessary we'll find a woman who will take money to carry our baby. Steve, you know I'll do anything for you. You'd be a great father. I know you would. I love you, Steve.'
'I was in Auckland for business,' Tony started. 'Only took two days, so it was a bit of a waste to fly here for just that. I haven't had a vacation in a long time, so I decided to see a bit of the country. Didn't think it would be this boring. I try to get from city to city, but they're too far apart!'
‘I just had to be sure,’ Bucky defended himself. ‘I know you love that old brown one and that is definitely a no go. I don’t want people to think I wear hundred year old leather jackets.’
It started as a lot of fun. They joked and laughed and enjoyed the peace. But it didn't take long before things went downhill. Literary, because skinny, asthmatic, Steve couldn't go any further and slowly started rolling backwards. Tony felt extremely guilty, he had come up with this idea, he knew Steve was in no condition to do something like mountain biking! But Steve didn’t seem to mind at all and decided they should just walk a little. Steve caught his breath and minutes later they were cycling again.
'Do you think he's angry because I said I didn't want him on the team until I saw him fight?' Steve asked as the three of them sat panting on a mat in one of Shield's gyms.
He approached the bunny and touched it. It was super soft. Steve buried himself in the big, fluffy, bunny belly. Yeah, that was nice.
'In all the magazines I see pictures of you with a cup of coffee, so I decided to make coffee flavored cupcakes, with a mocha topping and I decorated them with coffee beans.'
‘Told you so,’ Steve said, a happy smile on his face. He was at his favorite place in the world, with an amazing person. Things could only be better if James would actually know who Steve really was. But the moment the coffee was served, Steve forgot about Bucky and about how none of this was real. He wanted to enjoy it as long as it would last.
‘I’m Steve, nice to meet you,’ Steve answered. ‘If I’m your date, you should tell me a thing or two about yourself. Why are you at the opening of this exposition?’
Julia nodded, but didn't look at Steve. Sam told him to stop asking questions, because Julia might stop talking, but Steve knew that if he stopped now, they'd definitely didn't get answers.
He blew up his workshop. It happened about once a month, but this time it had been bad. It was an accident, and, thankfully, Tony hadn't been around, but an explosion had blown a hole in his penthouse. Not just his penthouse, also the floor above that, with the guest rooms. And the roof. The explosion was so big it made a hole in the roof two floors above the workshop. So yeah, it was pretty bad. He blamed one of his robots for doing something stupid, but it was never proven.
Stark Tower was even more impressive in real life than it was on the picture Steve had seen. The hallway was huge and light. People were walking in and out, half of them were on the phone. Steve could hardly believe someone lived here. Natasha walked to the reception desk and talked to the man who was working there. It took a few minutes, but then he pointed to a separate elevator and Steve and Natasha were on their way up.
‘It feels different on a bike,’ James answered. ‘Take the third street on the right. The way you feel free in a plane is probably the same as my bike feels for me. You have a lot more freedom than in a car, but you also have to deal with a lot more people who don’t know how to drive.’
‘Let’s just start over again,’ Steve said as he wiped the tears from his eyes. ‘I’m Steve, nice to meet you. Would you like to go out and have dinner with me?’
They were delicious. The donut itself was nice and soft, still a little warm, and the icing was super sweet, just how he liked it. He couldn't stop a small moan. Only when the donut was gone, he could think straight again. Tony looked at the baker and couldn't help smiling. The guy looked as good as the donuts tasted. The blond baker smiled back.
'Shame,' Tony laughed out. 'Not that I’d be able to do anything right now, my back is killing me! How can you sleep on the ground all night and then feel good enough to run around for an hour?'
Tony handed Steve the cup and the blond couldn't stop a laugh. 'How thoughtful, thank you! I'll let Sam know you returned it. He is running late at the supermarket.'
Tony closed the doors behind them, while Clint already moved on. They were approaching another big hall. The doors were wide open and there was more light behind them. Tony stayed behind a little, trying to figure out how the electricity was working here, so far from the rest of the world. When he heard something he stood still.
‘Yes, the arctic, so there was only a small possibility someone would accidently stumble upon this soldier. Pack your bags, we have a plane ready for you. There will be a car waiting for you when you arrive, so you can drive to the last of our stations. There will be food and blankets there for you and a dog sled that will take you to the place where we think this super soldier is hidden.’
‘Oh, right,’ Steve muttered as he looked at his pants that clung to his legs. He had completely forgotten. ‘I guess not then.  I’d invite you for a home cooked dinner at my place, but I think neither of us is ready for you to meet my housemates.’
‘So much for a holy night already,’ Steve muttered as he grabbed his bag and ran out of the door. Tony watched him go. It was so unfair that this man had a nice ass as well. Tony was definitely going to ask him out.
'You know what, if you help me fix my car, we'll go to those caves tomorrow. I'll pay!' Tony promised.
Steve held Tony in his arms for almost an hour, trying to stop his nosebleed, checking if he damaged his teeth, and cleaning his cuts. Tony looked terrible, but he'd heal, eventually. He was used to it by now, but it hurt a little when he walked. Steve hid the broken wings before he brought Tony back to the castle.
Steve sat on his bed and stared at his phone. He hadn’t moved for at least five minutes, his muscles didn’t seem to work anymore. He just couldn’t stop looking at the text message James had send him.
Tony looked down and noticed a boy with golden hair standing in the garden. He was looking up at Tony with bright blue eyes, looking scared. Tony frowned. Nobody was supposed to enter the gardens, except the royal family. How did this boy get there? Why hadn't the guards stopped him?
Tony chuckled. 'Great, I picked a guy as sassy as I am. Well, at least he's a great baker. Hope to see you again some time, Steve. You're a great guy, and you’ve got a great ass.'
'I'm sorry to hear that Scott, but I'm glad to hear that our club has a good reputation,' Ronan said, obviously faking pity. 'But if you want to work here we have to see if you make a pretty lady.'
‘A dog sled?’ Tony groaned. ‘Can this day can get any fucking worse?’ He sighed deeply. ‘Alright. I go to the fucking arctic for you, but I’m using my own plane.’
Natasha wasn't an option either. She was nice to people, but strict. Nobody touched her without her permission. If Tony tried to slap her butt she might find a way to kill him with her stapler. Why else would she keep a stapler in a paperless office?
‘How did you even know what flight I was on?’ Steve asked when they separated. They walked towards the parking lot where Tony had a car waiting.
'Shit,' Tony muttered. 'What do we do now? You can't cycle, but you can't walk either. We should at least get you off the road. Is it just your ankle? Everything else is fine? You sure? I don't wanna accidentally hurt you.'
Steve walked into Sam's house and called his friend as he stripped out of his leather suit. 'Hey Sam, you neighbor is here too. He heard we were going to play Assassins Creed and he wanted to join us.'
'No,' Nebula said. Steve looked relieved. 'I want to know about your sudden interest in the other guys and the man called Tony. What is going on?'
Next they took a piece of cloth and made a parachute-like construction. They tried what would happen if they tied a rock to it. They threw it from the top of a tree. Thankfully Tony hadn't tried it himself, because the rock fell on the ground with a loud thud. Steve and Tony changed the construction, but the next tests were as successful as the first one. The cloth was never strong enough to carry the weight of Tony's body. And as the years passed by, they couldn't try with Steve anymore either, because he was slowly growing taller and bigger than his royal friend.
'It's more comfortable than when I was in the army,' Steve smiled. 'You get used to it. A hot shower might help.'
'He didn’t kick you out like he did with us,' Steve complained. 'Oh shit, do you think he heard us talk on our first night here and he saw my... night form? Captain America was his hero and I let him down.'
'I bet you could do that too if you wore your armor,' Steve said, but there was an amused smile on his face.
'Worst night of my life,' Tony answered. 'Normally hot people only snuggle with me after sex. In a king size, super soft bed.'
'We were dumped in a van, with some others, who wanted to cross as well. After we crossed the border the van stopped and we were forced into another van. They separated the old from the younger people and brought us to an empty warehouse. I got separated from my sister. They raped me. I don't even want to think about the things they did to her. They forced me to sleep with guys.'
'Then I'll take you to the dressing rooms, they're in the basement. All of the guys sit together, so you can help each other with zippers or make up.'
But right now he was in a tiny town with two restaurants, three souvenir shops, two places arranged trips to the nearby caves, and a campsite with toilets, showers, and a pool. Steve was looking forward to it. He would pay for a place to put up his tiny tent, he'd grab some food and then he'd take a dip in the pool.
Tony looked out of the window and watched the green hills they passed by. As kids they weren't the most popular ones in their class, but they had been worse as teenagers. They were so awkward! Fifteen and in love, could things be worse?
Tony got a greeting in return and that's when he walked out of the door. He sipped the coffee and shivered. Not strong enough. Not strong at all. The first thing he did was empty his cup in the sink and pour himself another one before going back to work.
'It really is Tony. When you're searching through your toys, wondering about my size, pick a big one,' Tony smirked.
Clint rolled his eyes. ‘Yeah, sure, that’s just a lame excuse to get their hands all over each other.’
Suddenly the doors were kicked open and a bunch of policemen stormed in, guns up and shouting that everyone had to lay down on the ground with their hands on their head. Some of the guards grabbed their guns. Steve, Tony and the two others lay down on the ground. They didn't have bullet proof vests, unlike their colleagues. They couldn't take the risk.
Steve was walking towards the reception building when there was a loud bang somewhere behind him. It sounded like a gunshot, but when he turned around there was only a car and a lot of smoke. He quickly walked to the car and asked the driver if he was alright.
‘Who are we suing?’ a third person asked as he made his way towards Steve and the man. ‘Wait, Obi, what is that on your face? Are those scratches? Did the bird do that? Are you seriously telling me that tiny little bird did that? No way! There’s no way…’
Tony remembered being glad when he was finally old enough to go alone. It was pretty far and he had to take different subways to get there, but when he was 12 he went alone for the first time. He had been so proud. He didn't have to wait until Jarvis had time, he could go whenever he wanted. Steve got stronger as he got older, so they could go outside together again. They climbed trees, played ball games and bought candy with Tony's pocket money.
‘Natasha told me about your abilities,’ he said. ‘She kept in contact with us every time she left the castle. I know what you can do. I know it’s been a long time, but I have several agents who are prepared to help you catch up to this new age.’
'You did it in the comics too. Maybe the writer is someone from your past and we do know all the stories about you, we just don't know that they're real. Yet. Because the guy you'll be working for will want you back in the field. I'm sure he'll find a way to make you Captain America again. So bring your uniform.'
'Do it!' Steve ordered. When the pilot wasn't fast enough Steve ripped the door open and jumped out. He fell a hundred meter, before he safely landed on top of the robot. He slammed his shield between the two steel plates of the neck, hoping to destroy some of the important wiring inside.
'I didn't really pack a toothbrush,' Tony said. He really wanted to go home, but it was true that travelling in the dark wasn't the smartest move.
Until he found himself on the plane back home. His skin was tanned, his hair was getting way too long, his muscles ached, and he felt very relaxed, but also lonely. It wasn’t that he didn’t miss New Zealand, it had only been a few hours, but he already wanted to go back. But that wasn’t the loneliness he felt. He missed Tony. He missed Tony’s enthusiasm, his funny comments on everything they had seen, his complaining about not having enough space, his knowledge about everything, and the never ending chattering. Steve realized he had tried to fill his days with activities, so he wouldn’t hear how quiet it actually was without Tony.
I hear people moving and curiosity won't let me leave it alone, so I look up from Steve's shoulder and peer around the living room. Deadpool has his hand on Matt's shoulder, squeezing gently as he murmurs something to Matt. I want to hear, but then again I really don't. Matt looks worried and that.. It makes my stomach drop a bit.
“What happened,” Steve demanded. I shrank back instinctively. He was angry. Worried but still angry. It wasn't directed at me, but the anger of Captain America is a terrifying thing. Almost as terrifying as that one time Tony had gotten so drunk he'd actually slipped away and came back wearing a black silk dress with a thigh high slit. I shudder at the memory.
Matt Murdock in his Daredevil uniform and Agent Phil Coulson.  I was stuck between cringing and crying in relief while I noticed my family was clearly surprised and confused.  I heard them ask why Daredevil and Agent Coulson were there.  Phil muttered some response that I didn't pay attention to as Matt walked up to my side, dodging the Avengers to get closer to me.  By the small smile on his face I could tell that he was picking up on my obvious relief.  “Came to make sure you didn't swing away from the topic.”  I rolled my eyes and huffed feigning annoyance.  Leave it to Matt to make a Spidey reference in his pun.  “Seriously?  That's the best you got?”  I quipped back at Matt playfully.  Phil had been talking to the Avengers but his attention quickly returned to me.  “Well we know how you are in sticky situations, Peter.”
“That's okay. I'm going to take good care of you, alright?” I smiled at her, but it didn't have the same effect when she couldn't see it. “How's about we get you out of here and go find your parents, okay?”
My head shoots over to him, eyes wide. He pulls his mask up so I can see his mouth and he repeats, “We're going to be okay.” It sounds like a promise.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “You're the one hovering.” Bucky waved the fry pan making Tony duck away to avoid getting burned. “I'm the one cooking, Stark. You're just taking up space.”
I was able to smile a little in return. We had both been through so much and he'd survived, I survived. We'd be okay. I was sure that I'd wake up with nightmares again like I did after Carnage and Venom. Horrible, terrifying, violent nightmares that frightened me and would cause me to lash out at anyone nearby.
I wanted to look them in the eyes and just see how they would react, but… I didn't want to admit my own doubts, even to myself.  I kept my eyes down, letting them the focus fade out as the white of the medical sheets fill his sight.  “I knew what I was doing.”  I began.  It was a ridiculous way to start, as the Avengers voices murmured words of disbelief and possibly about my stupidity.  “I'm serious.  You would do the same--”  Tony interrupted.  Of course, he'd interrupt.  It's hard for Tony to keep his mouth shut.  That was a known fact.  “Yeah, we would because it's our job!”  Tony protested my words.  I held up my hand, shutting him up.  “It's my job too!”  My voice squeaked, embarrassingly as I raised the volume of it.
look at your anatomy soon.” The way his face looks, so eager and sick with desire, makes my stomach roll with anxiety and worry.
A faint tingling caught my attention, snapping me from cursing the seasonal weather. “Oohh.. Spidey, there'd better not be more..” I muttered to myself.
Matt choose to sit on one of the recliners instead of beside me, but I didn't blame him in the slightest. It was quiet now, but when Deadpool came back with his piles of food.. Anyways, at least Clint sat to my right, nudging me. “Wanna play Mario Kart until the food's ready?”
I must've zoned out because I felt hands on my cheeks, through the torn spandex and they were calling my name. I felt sick as a wave of hate rushed over me. Oh God, if they didn't do something I was going to tear them from limb to limb and fucking
My stomach fell as they settled around me, asking if I was okay, what hurt, and if I needed anything.  They were worried about me.  They care for me.  The realization made my heart clench with the familiar emotion of love.  Steve's big, strong hand was gentle against my cheek and Tony's rough hand, soft against my singed hair.  Bruce was looking over my medical chart, while the other three looked like they wanted to kick the doctors to make me better faster.  I choked up as tears fell from my eyes, streaking down my cheeks.  My lips opened and closed as I kept apologizing.
Maybe it was something I said, but the next moment, I felt something connect with my cheek. My ears rang as my eyes slid to the offending hand. “You hit like a baby,” I blurted out. I never did know when to shut up. Why would that change now?
I can't count the times I stole away to Bruce's lab, where things are kept chill for him. Not even Deadpool would dare to tread in Bruce's lab. Oh my safe haven. I haven't seen Daredevil since I got to leave the Medbay, but then again he would find the noise level of the Tower to be absolutely aneurysm inducing. Super senses, Deadpool, and the three most volatile Avengers do not make a good combination. Even I'm getting a headache.
It was hard to ignore that voice when I was so tired and with that infernally amazing hand running through my hair, so I listened and let my eyes fall shut. 'Sleep… I can do that..'
I frown, ignoring the drawl of Dr. Vanquil as he continues to talk about how 'fascinated' he is with the life form. Why hadn't Tony and Bruce picked up on this sooner? Was it just not masking the DNA at that point?
My heart stutters in my chest as another icy needle is plunged into my arm, sucking the blood from a vein in another attempt to gather data from the black veins. Biting on my lip, I force myself to ignore the panic and pain. They don't know I'm Spider-Man, but even as Peter Parker I'm not about to let myself fall apart in front of them. I'm stronger than that. I have to be.
My senses screamed, danger from the doctor's emotions and possible intentions. My teeth dug into my tongue without my consent. I wanted to punch something, to feel something solid crumble beneath my fists.
The next thing I knew I was jolting awake, alarms ringing in my ears as footsteps pounded into the room. It was doctors and nurses – they kept telling me I needed to calm down, but I wasn't sure I could.
'Let me talk to my parents, I'm sure you can live with them,' Tony said. 'Jarvis is there, he will look after you and I'll be home as often as I can, alright?'
'Whatever!' Clint huffed. 'You think he'd make me a legal hero when he can have Captain America? No way in hell, I don’t stand a chance. I doubt he'll hire anyone else. The Captain and Iron Man are probably more than enough for him.'
For a moment he considered going home earlier. A month was a long time, maybe he should just stay for a week or two? But Steve decided against it. He'd worked hard for this vacation and he would probably never see this beautiful country again, while Tony might have been a simple summer love. He didn't hope so, but that was how summer love worked, right? Tony was a billionaire, he might not want to be seen with a guy like Steve. It was okay in New Zealand, where no one paid attention to them,  but not in New York. Steve was just another jobless guy after all.
‘ARE YOU STUPID?!’ he shouted. ‘I stood right next to that! You could have fucking killed me! You’re the most useless sidekick ever!’
‘Tones, you’re back,’ Rhodey said from where he was lying on the couch. He sat up, turned off the television and grabbed another beer, which he handed to Tony. ‘How did things go?’
Steve laughed. ‘Work related. Like you said, my contract is ending and I have a few ideas I wanted to discuss with you. Like Iron Man comics.’
Clint made it a challenge to win from Steve, but soon they lost sight of him. With more people and more luggage it took them longer than they had planned to get back to base. Tony wanted to complain, he was so cold it felt like his toes were about to fall off, but just one look from Natasha made him shut up. They were really happy when they finally arrived at the shield base. Tony opened the door and found Steve waiting inside with steaming hot coffee. Natasha and Tony dropped their bags and joined Steve inside for coffee, while Clint let the dogs in.
'Tony,' Tony introduced himself. He noticed the game controllers on the table.  'You guys are going to play some games? Tell me next time. I modified my Xbox and some of the games. They're way more fun to play now. You can borrow it sometimes, if you want.'
‘Steve, come to my office right now, I’ve got something to show you,’ Tony said over the phone, trying not to sound too excited.
Tony grinned widely. They made love all night afterwards. They didn't stop until the sun came up. Tony hadn't slept at all when he had to go to his meeting, but he was more energetic than he had ever been. Pepper had been so surprised!
‘It’s silly,’ Steve said, rubbing the back of his head and looking at his shoes. ‘It’s some kind of weird prophecy someone gave me before I went in here. A guy said I would find true love once I would get out again, but maybe he just tried to comfort me, because I had to leave the girl I liked behind.’
'Tony, we can't take in every orphan just because we have enough space,' Maria smiled. 'We don't even know this boy. And you are at MIT, making new friends!'
'Steve, are you alright?' he asked softly. He couldn't see Steve's face, the man was looking out of the window.
'I think I'll start searching for a more artistic job,' Steve agreed. 'I just hope Ronan will let me go.'
‘Sure,’ James said. ‘I know a really nice play a few blocks away from here. I could text you the address and we could go there.’
'Alright,' Nebula said. 'Stefanie, try not to let one customer bring you down. You look good, you're doing great. Now hurry up and get ready for tonight.'
'No, I wanted to talk to you first,' Steve said, comforting his friend. 'He is searching for guys who want to testify against Ronan in court. It's a big thing, so I wouldn't just give him your name. He did promise a new identity, a place to live, far away from here, and he will find any lost family members. So if you want to think about it, that's the deal.'
'Do you even have to ask?' smiled Steve before he lifted Tony up bridal style and carried him to their bedroom.
There was only one place left where Tony hadn’t searched: the tower. Hopefully the genetically engineered man was there. If he was really as good as Fury suggested, he might have been hiding from Tony. Even with the suit he couldn’t scan an entire floor, so there were always places left to hide. He would have to do another round on the floors, but first the tower.
Okay, this was the first time he had seen the man, but Steve was really polite as he introduced himself, he asked interesting questions, and made funny comments. Tony decided he was perfect. He wanted to know everything about Steve. He wanted to know how he looked underneath those clothes, he wanted to know how long he could hold his breath, he wanted to know which of his parents was responsible for the gorgeous blond hair, he wanted to know his shoe size, he wanted to know fucking everything.
This could only mean one thing: James found out that Steve was lying to him. Why else would he send a text like this? All their texts had been jokes, complaints about boring work, and random pictures of cute things they found on their way about their daily lives. James had never been this serious and if he wanted to ask Steve out on another date he would have called.
Bucky couldn't stop laughing. He laughed until there were tears in his eyes. 'Things like that only ever happen to you!'
'Whenever you feel like it,' Steve added. 'If you don't feel like it today, tomorrow is fine too. Or next week, whenever.'
Tony laughed. ‘You have humor, and that for an old man. Just keep working, so we can get into the plane and warm up. Maybe I should fly us to my house in Malibu. It’s nice and warm there.’
'There is a buffet waiting for us? You'll go on a trip around the world with me? No, you're running for president?' Tony asked. He had spotted Steve and somehow he couldn't stop talking.
'Right now?' Steve asked, peeking outside through the only window in the room. 'But it's getting dark outside. Should we really wander around on the snowy fields in the dark? We might get lost.'
'Wait, it's dark. Why are you big?' Clint asked surprised. When he saw all three of them smirking his mouth fell open. 'True love's kiss! Oh my God, is that why you are half naked? You were going to do the do! What the fuck, you pervs!'
Without a word she attacked them again, making Clint end up on his back on the floor again, while Tony flew up, out of her reach. He tried to shoot her with the repulsors, but she was too fast. She moved like she was it was a game of parkour. She used the walls and furniture to jump and turn, only to get Clint back on the ground again the moment he got up.
'Doesn't matter, because I do,' Steve said, leaning towards Tony. 'Even if it doesn't work, it might still be nice.'
Steve came home from work and sensed something was wrong. Tony's car was outside, but it was too quiet. Normally Tony had music playing, he was singing or talking to himself and his robots.
‘What the hell is that?!’ Clint asked as he appeared next to Tony. ‘Is that lava? Is that seriously lava? In the arctic? What the hell!’
Steve knew he should have brought a treat. Something to lure the parakeet with. Although seeing the amount of pigeons, he might have been attacked and robbed from the treat before Redwing even noticed. There was nothing else to do than to keep searching and keep calling. Steve walked around for over half an hour and was about to give up, when he saw a man waving his arms, like he was trying to get rid of a bug. Something bigger than a bug: a bird.
'Sounds perfect,' Tony said. He was very good at multitasking and he heard every word while he was ogling Steve. 'Bruce, Clint, I want you to take a look at the floor plans of all three workshops and write me a little report with what you think of it and if it needs any changes. Is there enough science? Is this what kinds want? I need it by the end of the week. Natasha, contact everyone who might be interested in investing in this project. We need more money if we want to make this work, especially if we want to spread this over other cities as well. That's all! Meeting is over, dismissed.'
‘I don’t know,’ Tony admitted. ‘Some kind of force field. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It keeps the cold outside and the warmth in there. Maybe it’s some sort of magnetism, let me try.’
‘If you don’t shut up right now I will have some of my agents set up a very difficult boot camp for you for the rest of the afternoon,’ Fury threatened. Nobody dared opening their mouth again, even Steve, who probably wouldn’t have any problems with the boot camp.
With the clients and the guards gone there were only employees left. The people who worked behind the scenes to clean, the bartenders and the bouncers were taken away, so only the prostitutes were left.
‘I’m Tony Stark. I’m a businessman, I was never in the air force, but most other things I told about myself are true. I came to our second date because I really liked the first one and I wanted to learn more about you. I’m really sorry I pretended to be someone else, but I couldn’t continue like this. I couldn’t lie to you anymore. I like you, and I really hope you don’t hate me right now.’
“You know, Doc, not sure you want to play this game, if you know what I mean,” I told him, swallowing my doubts. As easily, or as easier, as I had defeated Carnage, the feeling of being used and toyed with, of wanting to hurt and destroy wasn't something I wanted to feel again.
The feeling of separating from the hybrid was like.. being skinned, like someone was peeling your skin from your body. Every single part of my body exploded with pain and I screamed. My screams and the symbiote's seemed to echo out.
It looked like they were shocked when I apologized.  Like they didn't believe it was my fault.  But it was.  I needed them to understand.  They needed to know.  “Peter?  Peter, are you okay?”  They asked me, concerned and uncertain as to whether or not they should call a doctor.  “N-no, wait,” I called to them as Clint turned to run out the door.  “Hold on, give.. give me a few...” I took a few deep breaths, trying to gain control of my panic.  What if they made me stop?  What if they were ashamed of me?  Oh god…  'Wait.  Snap out of it Peter!  They love you.  They'll understand.'  I shook myself from my thoughts.
I stood up, stretching my limbs. If I was going to be doing some extremely awesome stunts (Be jealous Clint!) then I was going to need to be as limber as possible, which, I admit, is more limber than the average human. ('..I am
It turns out that rest in the Avengers household is not all that it's cracked up to be. Especially when Wade keeps jumping through windows with Mexican food to help me get better. Tony, Clint, and Bucky running through the building, yelling threats at him does not help. There is no peace and quiet here.
Daredevil raises an eyebrow at me and I give him a sheepish smile. Mind-reader. “Yes,” Daredevil answers and I turn my head away slowly. Yikes.
When Deadpool stood and stalked over to the pilots I instantly missed his presence. “Head to Avengers Tower,” I heard him growl at the pilots. “But sir, our orders are -”
Phil made a pun.  I could hear Matt snort laughter as I groaned, ignoring the confused and curious looks and whispers of the Avengers.  “Really Phil?  You too?”  Despite the deadpan face that he put up I could see a hint of playful amusement in his eyes.  He may have been freaky emotionless when I first met him, but once I had gotten to know him, I could see that he just hid it better.  He tossed something from his hand at me and lightning fast (which actually was stupid and hurt) I snatched what he'd thrown in midair.  As I recognized the objects in my hands, I eyed him curiously.  Secretly I was delighted to have my webshooters, but did he have to give them to me now?  “Next time you feel the need to jump off a building after a perp you might want to remember those.”
A hand smelling faintly of chemicals runs through my hair. “What happened, Pete?” I wince as my chest twinges a little. “I don't know,” I tell Tony in a cracking voice. “Everyone was gone.. I couldn't.. couldn't hear a thing...”
I swallowed as Bruce took my arms in his hands and inspected my blackened wrists. “When did this start?”
I think this chapter might've turned out okay?  I've really got to get my head back into this so I can figure out what direction I'm going to go from here though.
I raise an eyebrow, smiling a little. “Imagine all that cheese...the way the meat drips with seasoned oily goodness...”
Daredevil was smirking, amused. Bastard was like Xavier when it came to reading my mind. He always knew things he shouldn't. Made it fucking hard to prank the guy. I still haven't quite succeeded yet.
“Is it story time, Doc? I like the one where the the Spider goes free and gets to sleep in his own bed. Your beds here are terrible. I'm sure you must agree,” I rambled.
“Okay,” they nodded slowly. They moved around Deadpool and Daredevil and reached out, gripping my upper arms in a not quite painful grip but one that could instantly immobilize me. I nodded to Bruce minutely.
Now you might be thinking 'day out on the city, finally! It's just what Peter needed', but you were wrong. I was wrong. After all the negotiating and discussion about going out and being Spider-Man, it turns out I should've just told Fury 'no'.
‘He must really like you then,’ Rhodey answered, pushing the lasagna in Tony’s direction, so he would get some food too. ‘But I don’t want you using my name for this anymore, it can only end with a lot of drama. You either tell this guy your real name, or I will.’
Meanwhile Steve and Clint had gotten the dogs inside. The wall mechanism didn't work anymore. Steve had made the hole bigger, so he could carry the sled through as well. They brought everything inside and closed the door firmly behind them. Since the wall was gone they locked the place up. Steve sat down on his knees and hugged the dog closest to him. He buried his nose in the warm fur and laughed as the dog started licking him. Soon the dogs were all over him and Clint, happy with the attention they got.
‘My own shirt is still dry,’ Steve said as he unzipped his coat to show it. ‘Let me try those sweatpants.’ He zipped up his coat again and pulled Tony towards the rain. Tony quickly grabbed his umbrella and opened it. It was difficult to hold it above both their heads while they were holding hands, but neither of them really cared much about getting wet.
Steve blinked once, twice, before he started laughing. He couldn't stop laughing. All her nervous feelings were gone. This was the biggest coincidence ever. When he calmed down a little, Steve took his badge from his bra and showed Tony he was a cop too. Then it was Tony's turn to laugh.
‘All big and muscly again, I see,’ Clint joked as he sat down next to his new friend. ‘Have you decided if you’re going to tell director Fury about it?’
Steve laughed. It was a lame joke, but with all the nerves gone and all this hopeful energy racing through his body, all he could do was laugh. He just couldn’t stop anymore and when he was practically slapping his legs from laughing so hard, Tony joined him. The whole situation was just ridiculous and they’d probably look crazy, laughing at a closed ice cream shop in the rain, but they couldn’t stop. It was minutes later when they were both catching their breath.
