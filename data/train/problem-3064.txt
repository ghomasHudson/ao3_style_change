The first aim of his fist was dead on. Dean’s face was whipped to the side from the blow. Another punch came, followed by another. Blood trickled down the elder’s bottom lip. Dean made no attempt to fight back or push Sam off of him. Dean deserved this; this was his punishment. If only it was more because he deserved so much more. Sam continued to yell and hit until he was out of breath. The heavy pounding of his heart rang in his ears as a side effect of the adrenaline coursing through his veins.
So far their search has come up empty. The building was just a regular old production factory. By the look of the machinery around them, the place seemed to have shut down in the last year or two. There was no sign of suspicious activity; no sign of any black goo or the monsters it comes from. Damn it! Maybe Crowley had his information wrong. Or maybe the demon was leading them on some wild goose chase for his own sick pleasure. Either way, it was a waste of the hunters’ time.
The green-eyed male was shocked. He did not know what to think. Castiel was so angry at him. The Winchester was not sure if he ever saw the angel as mad as he was now.
"No, but maybe we can follow thing one and thing two," Crowley replied as he spotted two Leviathans in the parking lot.
Dean knew it was too late to sneak the three of them out of the motel. Besides, it was not like he could get to the door anyways. "No time," Dean responded, "Please get in the closet."
Sam took a step away from his brother as regret filled his very being. Dean fell to the ground panting. How could Sam apologize to his big brother?
‘Sammy?’ Dean questioned in his mind. Why would he be dreaming about his brother? The sight before him began to fizzle out, and with a sudden jolt, the experienced hunter found himself lying on the couch with his brother shaking him awake.
Still, there was nothing the humans could do as the Leviathans continued to take over hospitals and even break into the political world. The battle was over before it even began, and the Leviathans were going to take what was rightfully theirs.
Dean stood up from the couch and stretched even further; god it sucked getting older. However, Dean could focus on a case. Anything was better than those blue-eyes that always haunted him. “Ok,” he responded as he turned to face his sibling, “what is it?”
For the last six months, Dean wanted nothing more than to see his brother again, but he still had to keep Sammy safe, which superseded his desires. "I can't Sammy."
And it is not Dick Roman. I wrote this as season 7 aired, and I decided not to make any changes. So no Dick Roman.
The hunter stared at the demon with a deadpan expression. “Anyways...” Bobby tried to bring the conversation back to business.
Bobby leaned back in his chair, keeping a safe distance from the sneaky black-eyed bitch of a demon. “Did you find anything to stop the Leviathans?” Bobby asked. He knew he would never learn about the demon’s source of information, but if the demon uncovered useful information….
Sam look absolutely horrified. Here he was punishing the one person who always took care of him. Dean did not deserve this. Lucifer continued to evilly smirk like he already won the war.
But what could they do? How were they supposed to stop the Leviathans. They killed Crowley, the King of Hell, like he was nothing. These creatures were far older than demons. So maybe there was not a way to kill them. With Leviathans spread out like they were, they could not just shove the monsters back into Purgatory.
When Dean's eyes locked on to his brother's hazel ones, Sam continued, "We know about the two of you."
Six months have gone by since Bobby and Sam returned to their temporary home without Dean. Six months since the idiot Winchester gave himself to save those he cared about. Couldn’t he see it was a trap? It was a trap all along. Bobby should have realized it. He cursed himself for not connecting the dots sooner. The attacks that always wounded the hunters but never killed him, and it did not help that it was Sam and Bobby who were facing the Leviathans. It was all a message to Dean. Chipping away at the already broken individual. Singer cursed himself for his stupidity. Dean was barely managing, and now he was the perfect prey for those damn Leviathans. The worst part of it was that if the Leviathans did not want to be found, they would not be found. It was not like demons or angels where there was a summoning spell. They were screwed.
Two hours later, the three hunters pulled into the town that was being terrorized by a coven of witches. They stopped at a motel and checked in; it was still early in the day. “Ready to go talk to the witnesses?” Sam asked.
"You mean to tell me you never noticed how close those two were?" Crowley loved pouring salt in the wound.
His ears picked up soft groans from the other room, breaking him from his internal debate. It was not Bobby, the old hunter slept like a dead man. Worried, Sam walked out into the other room.
Sam glanced at his pseudo father figure and put a hand on his shoulder. "I know Bobby," Sam offered some comfort.
Dean was barely watching the cheap sci-fi movie that was playing on the TV. He had his very good friend Jack Daniels with him, and that made his day just a tiny bit better. He had forgone the usual flask or glass he usually drank his whiskey out of. Instead he chose to chug it down straight from the bottle. Every time he closed his eyes, the elder Winchester would see the angel who had wormed his way through the hunter’s well-guarded heart. Dean couldn’t take it; Cas had betrayed them. Then the stupid angel had wanted to make things right. Now there wasn’t ever a chance for that, for Cas to make everything right again. If only the Winchester had acted earlier. He could have prevented all of this; he could have saved Cas. Taking another swig of alcohol, Dean felt the burn down his throat as he acknowledged this all fell on his shoulders. If only he paid more attention to Cas, none of this could have happened. Well maybe the whiskey will give him the numb feeling he so desperately wants.
Castiel licked his lips and shrugged his shoulders. "What can I say. I enjoyed everything the angel was. I have all his memories and feelings."
Bobby continued to use his peripheral vision to glance back and forth between the Winchester brothers. He was worried about both of the: Mr. Lost Puppy, and Sichzo Big Bird. And that was putting things lightly. But the aging hunter knew of nothing that could fix the boys problems at the moment. They were at an all-time high with crap they had to deal with. The greying man thought back to the problem at hand, those damn Leviathans. How to stop them was still a mystery. Hopefully Crowley was getting close to figuring out how to get those monsters back in Purgatory for good. Bobby silently prayed that the damn unreliable, self-appointed demon king was not pulling his chain. There was no doubt that former Crossroads demon was untrustworthy. But Bobby agreed with Crowley on one thing though, the hunter was sure those damn Leviathans were up to something. A few weeks ago, that one monster had the chance to kill the hunter, but it didn’t. Singer figured the thing was trying to send a message. But what was it, and to whom was the message for? He assumed it was one of the three in the car, but which of the three hunters in particular? It seemed like the Leviathans hated all three of them pretty equally if the past encounters were anything to go by. But Bobby felt like he was missing something. There were so many questions but little answers. They needed the answers before it was too late, or else all will be lost.
Sam jolted awake as he pulled away from the harsh grip of his nightmares. He glanced around to make sure that he did in fact break free from the cage. So far no sign of Lucifer, but the day has only just begun. With a sigh, Sam got out of bed. He paced a few steps, mentally debating if he wanted to go for a run. Ever since the wall had been broken containing his memories from the cage, the younger Winchester took up running to clear his mind. When his feet hit the pavement, it felt like everything else faded away, and the memories from the cage were pushed back into the far reaches of his mind.
The man choking Bobby looked over at his companion with a sick and twisted smile on his face. “What do you think Chaz,” the guy called out, “think this old man will make a tasty snack?”
“Sleep okay Sammy?” the older Winchester asked in a slightly worried tone as he realized it was still late, or early depending on the perspective. Sam sighed. His brother was always more concerned with Sam’s wellbeing than his own. “I’m fine Dean,” Sam immediately responded. And it was true; he wasn’t any better or worse. “It’s you I’m worried about,” the younger Winchester added.
If looks could kill, Sam would have killed Castiel twice over. "Where did you take him?" he demanded answers.
The other Leviathans did not need to be told twice. They listened to their boss and left the two alone without any word spoken.
Sam sighed and felt the gut wrenching feeling of failure. "I saw him, Bobby. It was..." Sam struggled with finishing his words.
Dean raised an eyebrow. What did Cas want with him? If he wanted to kill him, well then they should just get it over with. It is not like he had much to live for anyways. The waiting was just too much for him; he did not wish to suffer anymore. And if there was anyone who could take his pain away, it would be Castiel. “Cas…” the hunter muttered.
Well that is the end. I keep going back and forth on whether or not I should do a sequel. If I do, then I would go into much more detail into Dean's new life with Leviathan!Castiel. But I don't know.... Would you guys like me to continue this? Please let me know!
Castiel's eyes locked onto the three men who had been inside the closet. "Hello again Sam. Bobby, Crowley," the Leviathan greeted.
The deep eyes of Castiel stared at the broken hunter in front of him. Finally after all this time, Dean Winchester has returned to him. The former angel was not kidding when he promised the Winchester that he will be back for him. But the fragile human needed to be broken; Dean needed to surrender himself to the Leviathan so that he could remold the Winchester into what the monster wanted him to be.
The older Winchester knew if he turned around that he would get the full power of Sam’s irresistible puppy dog eyes. It was the one thing Dean could not say no to.
Then he ended the call. Starting the car, Sam pressed on the gas and raced toward the next town over. They needed a new plan and fast in order to save Dean.
But the hunter did not care about his own safety. Sammy and Bobby will be safe, and that is all that matters in the elder Winchester’s mind.
And Dean was one to follow orders. With a shout, Dean came untouched, shooting his seed across their bellies. Castiel followed his lover over the edge and filled Dean with his seed. After the aftershocks passed, Castiel placed soft kissed along Dean's collarbone and jaw.
Castiel placed his hand on the mark scarred onto the hunter’s shoulder. Dean gasped at the sudden tingling. Never before had Castiel touched the mark and caused such a sensation within the hunter. An unreadable expression could be found on the dark haired man’s strong face. Then that twisted smile appeared on his lips. Dean remembered that smile when the Leviathans first took over the angel’s body. Cas closed the gap between the two of them. Dean wasn’t sure if the man in front of him was going to fuck him or kill him. And truth be told, the hunter was terrified of both options.
Standing across from the human was the undeniable form of Castiel. The vessel of Jimmy was hard to forget. The jet black hair, the pale skin, and the unforgettable crystal blue eyes were unforgettable. Dean did not know what to think. Here he was standing in front of Cas again. Sure his dreams may have hinted that the angel was still somehow alive, but actually seeing the proof was a completely different thing.  Here was the one being Dean had given himself to unlike anyone else in his life.
Dean inwardly laughed as he turned the page of the book he was reading. He and Cas had acted like two virgins who barely knew anything about sex. It was funny considering the hunter had never been nervous with anyone else. Hell, he wasn’t even that nervous when he first had sex. But then again, it was never as special as it had been when he was with Cas the first time.
Dean nodded his head absently. The other Leviathans may not have attacked him, but that did not me he was unscarred. But they were not to blame for his pain. The two men in the room were the cause of the Winchester’s heartache.
They sat there for the next few hours researching. Dean could not help himself to let his mind wander. He kept seeing Castiel everywhere. In his dreams, and every time he closed his eyes. Neither Bobby nor Sam knew how close the angel and his charge got. They decided it was their secret to keep. Dean thought back to the first time things changed between himself and his angel.
“The Winchesters are in the next town over,” the creature stated in a voice that lacked emotion, “should we make a move?”
Furthermore, those monsters still had Dean. Sam could not risk it all with his brother's life still on the line. Was Dean too far gone to be saved though? Even Bobby was beginning to have his doubts. Dean would do anything for those he loved, and the idjit loved that angel.
Sam and Bobby did not even stand a chance either. Another male appeared out of nowhere and shoved the taller of the two hunters across the room with one powerful shove. The first male, who had knocked Dean out, smiled wickedly and headed over to Bobby with cruel intentions in his gaze. The hunter tried to move to give himself time to come up with an attack plan, but it was not enough. The man grabbed the hunter in a bruising choke hold. Singer gurgled and choked on all the air he had in his lungs. It felt like this guy was going to crush his trachea with a single squeeze. Black dots began to flood the hunter’s vision. He should have known this was going to be a trap. Now they would be lucky if they could get out of this alive, and it did not seem like no one was going to save them.
Sam's eyes narrowed in frustration, but there was still confusion visible on his face. "I'm not leaving you again Dean," he responded, "Come with us." Sam offered his hand to his brother.
All of Sam’s attention was focused on the hallucination that was the devil. Lucifer, in Nick’s body, had finally stopped clapping, but the sadistic and mocking smile still remained on his lips. The devil’s borrowed blue eyes briefly glanced at the bloody figure that was Dean Winchester.
Next thing the hunter knew, he was pressed up harshly against the wall. The only thing in his field of vision was the rage filled eyes of his lover. “You were the one who went to that whore!” the Leviathan’s voice was getting louder and fueled with untapped rage.
Sam could not see the haunted look in Dean’s usually vibrant emerald orbs. Dean did not want to Sam to know; did not want his brother to know that every time he closed his eyes he saw
Dean flinched as he heard Lisa being called such a name. He was still hurting from her loss, but he knew that she was not the one for him. He may never loved her the way she deserved, but that did not mean she deserved all the suffering she endured because of him. After all, she could never compare to the way he felt about Castiel. But still, Cas had no right to talk about her like that.
Sam closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip while clutching his hands so tight that his nails broke skin.
He then glanced at Sam. The young hunter was just now starting to get back on his feet. Sam hadn’t even had a chance to gather bearings before the Leviathan was on the attack. The thing delivered a powerful blow to the human’s ribs; Sam was sure that at least one or two of ribs were broken from the blow. But that was not the end of the brutal attack; no it was just the beginning.
After getting the rest of the information, Sam hung up the phone and hit the gas. He was going to find Dean.
With a sigh of frustration, Sam realized he now had more questions than answers. He reached into his jeans pocket for his cell phone. His movements were almost unconscious at this point as he quickly dialed Bobby's number. The other hunter answered the call on the third ring.
Dean kept his attentions focused on the road. Occasionally, he would glance in the rear view mirror to check up on his younger sibling. His eyes didn’t linger on the taller male’s form for long; he did not want his baby bro to catch him. But Dean had noticed the guilt in Sammy’s hazel eyes. Dean firmly believed that Sam had nothing to feel guilty over. After all, Dean deserved what he got and more. Ever since Castiel’s decision to open Purgatory, the hunter felt so lost. He does not even know anymore why he still keeps going on and fighting. What’s the point anyways? The elder Winchester gripped the steering wheel tighter until his knuckles were white. He could not shake this feeling of dread that pooled in the pit of his stomach.  He hadn’t felt like this in a long time, and he prayed that he could keep Sammy safe.
Edgar nodded his head. The smirk never wavered on his lips. “Very well,” he spoke before vanishing with Dean.
Bobby looked up and spotted the self-proclaimed King of Hell as he took a seat across from the hunter with a look of disdain.
Dean closed in acceptance. He knew his fate was sealed. He felt the slimy Leviathan’s hand grip his bicep tightly. Then suddenly, the hunter felt the cool breeze of an air conditioner. The air felt nothing like the climate inside that old, abandoned building they were in. It was warmer now, and the AC was very necessary. Dean felt Edgar stiffen beside him. Curiosity winning out, the hunter opened up his eyes. What he saw in front of him made him fight the urge to face plant with the ground.
Instinctually, the three men knew better to argue, so the three of them climbed into the closet. Dean closed the door, and luckily they could still see the motel room through the slats of the closet door.
Immediately the attack on the hunters ceased. Both Bobby and Sam glanced around and spotted Dean and Edgar. Sam inwardly cursed. He knew his brother was going to something stupid, typical Dean.
Crowley smiled. “Don’t I always,” he replied in a semi-flirtatious voice before walking into the dingy motel room. He looked around with disgust clear on his features. “Can’t you find better motel?” the demon asked with a dramatic shrug of his shoulders as he seemingly wiped dust from the windowsill.
Sam stared at his brother for another moment with a worried gaze. “Bobby found us a case,” he stated, instead of demanding answers.
The human glanced back at the two men that were his only family. Dean had to do something. Nothing could happen to Sammy on his watch, nothing. Too much had happened in the past already. The hunter then glanced back at the Leviathan holding him down.
Sam's mind wandered back to Castiel, or the thing that took on the angel's appearance. The jury was still out if that was truly their angel. He physically looked like the angel, but his mannerisms were off. Gone was the shy, oblivious behavior. In its place, was a strange confidence in the angel's visage. Even Sam could feel the dark aura that surrounded the angel. It was something the younger Winchester never felt before around the angel. What if the Castiel that fought along side the Winchesters was truly gone? If so, then what was wearing the angel's vessel?
The younger man rolled his eyes at the other man’s mannerisms. Some things never change, and Sam was grateful for everything that was Bobby. “Dean is drinking,” the hazel-eyed hunter started.
The darker haired male eyes’ darkened with a dark sense of lust. The hunter looked back up into the other male’s eyes. Dean opened his mouth to speak, but no words would escape his lips. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. “I’m sorry,” he finally whispered.
Sam could not recall how long he stood in that empty hotel room. His mind was in complete disarray. From seeing his brother after months of searching for him to his brother's current state. Dean was so... Sam could not finish the thought more than different. Then there was the shocking revelation that Castiel, their angel, was still alive. Sam could not believe when his hazel eyes saw the trench coat wearing angel, who saved their lives countless of times. But was it the same angel who fought on the side of the Winchesters?
"Dean, please come with me." A look of confusion appeared on the taller sibling's face. "But Dean, if we can get you out of here, then we can regroup and fight."
He was pissed. He hated not being able to do something; it was not in his nature. Dean Winchester was a fighter through and through.
Later that night, Dean crashed on the couch. He insisted Bobby take the master bedroom to heal. The master bedroom had the largest bed and its own bathroom connected Bobby tried to protest, but Dean would not take no for an answer. Sam and Dean played rock, paper, scissors for the other bedroom. Of course Sam won; the eldest Winchester really needed to stop picking scissors. His eyes drifted close as he was pulled into the land of dreams.
Dean bit his lip in frustration. He has only been able to come untouched once since he and Castiel became lovers. Slowly, Castiel's thrusts sped up, and Dean felt himself building up toward his orgasm. Each time Castiel pounded his cock inside him, he always managed to hit that bundle of nerves.
Dean stared into the eyes of his family for a long moment; his own emerald orbs watering. His own lips began to quiver, and all he wanted to do was admit to this dirty secret. "They changed me," Dean finally admitted before closing his eyes.
Castiel felt no restrictions. Once they were alone, he moved into the personal space of his human. Yes, Dean was his and his alone. Castiel owned him. “Hello again Dean,” the monster greeted.
The fight in his Winchester blood kicked in; Dean narrowed his eyes; he was not the only one who did the betraying. “You say that like you are the innocent one,” he whispered in anger.
"You boys really need to find places with more class," Crowley commented with a smug look on his face.
Dean quickly scrambled to his feet and rushed to Castiel's side as far as his bonds would let him. "Please don't hurt him," he begged.
Dean looked up into his brother’s worried hazel eyes. He took a deep breath before sitting up; Sam must have been trying to wake his brother up for a while now. “What?” the older sibling groaned as he stretched his tired muscles.
Sam was heading back to the cabin he and Bobby were staying in for the next couple of weeks. The Winchester was on his way back from a false lead. The hunters were now searching for Crowley who was their only hope to stop the Leviathans and save Dean. But if the demon did not want to be found, the hunters were not going to find them. This was their third false lead in the last month. Damn it! Sam cursed himself and all of Hell. Why did Dean have to do that? Why did he have to give himself up? The hazel-eyed hunter blinked back the angry tears that threatened to escape. He wanted Dean back with him; he could not lose his brother again.
He saved the world because of love and he would do it again. No matter how you see that I think that’s beautiful.” Jack said.
“I did.” Crowley said, adjusting his tie and straightening his jacket. Both had gotten ruffled by the storm. “So how is mother? Still a bitch? Oh wait… I mean witch.”
Michael's eyes trailed to Chuck. Saddened by his own betrayal or on what Chuck had become. Maybe both
Dean had no idea what to even say to that. Nothing in his life could prepare him for those seven sentences.
When had Sam arrived? Dean hadn’t noticed. But it wasn’t just Sam… he saw Eilleen, Crowley, Rowena, Charlie, Benny and… Cas. His gaze lingered on Cas.
“Well.” He rubbed his chin. “I was just minding my business, thinking about how God screwed me over by cursing me to be the ‘bad guy’ and how no one ever believed me that he was just an giant manipulative a-hole when some kind of portal sent me to this beach.”
It all seemed to work perfectly. The angels didn’t want to fight God, but they could keep the world stable as Jack did the heavy lifting.
“Why would I be? Humans aren’t so bad.” Cas gave him the most lovey dovey eyes as Dean stood dumbfounded.
A fight like that would disturb the whole universe. Purgatory, heaven, the empty and hell must all be out of balance.
Dean agreed. If this was the final moments before the end. He was at least glad to have witnessed this.
Dean walked over to the other side of the car. If all goes well he would have lots of other times to drive the car.
It was relaxing, being just an arm away from Sam and Jack. It eased his mind. The world ending problems forgotten. For just a moment.
There was no way the surroundings had changed naturally. They were in a completely different state, maybe even country.
He gave the bunker one last glance before following Sam up the stairs. He turned the lights off and closed the door behind him.
“You are a terrible writer.” he insulted and went for a punch. The punch hit but did no damage at all. Dean on the other hand, felt like he had punched a wall.
So after mumbling about how he would love to watch them burn if it didn’t acquire so much effort he accepted. Giving Cas 5 minutes to warn Sam and Dean about everything that was gonna go down.
Dean had no idea how any of them were gonna sleep that night. By tomorrow they were either be death in the worst way possible or perhaps they wouldn’t even exist at all. Who knows what
A stray soul gravitated towards Jack. Like a butterfly making its way through a flower field. It was beautiful and familiar. Cas. Dean could feel it. Followed by thousands more. All lighting up and making their way to Jack like shooting stars.
“C’mon Cassie! You might have been to busy staring at your boyfriend, but I saw God and Jack in an apocalyptic battle. That’s clearly some family drama they have to sort out, I’ll wait this one out.”
The empty rumbled, its hold on them weakened. He could’ve sworn he heard a thunder just a second ago. If he listened closely he could hear wind howling and rain storming down. Except the empty didn't have any wind or rain...
Dean stood dumbfounded. Cas had been right there and just like that he had lost sight of him. Or better said: he has lost sight of
“You okay?” Dean asked without any sound. Sam nodded and sat straight. He mouthed: “Fine… you?” Dean replied at with a shrug.
This wasn't a dream. He really just confessed to his angel.  A dumb, selfless, clueless and reckless angel, but his.
“When I release all those souls back to that shithole you call earth, it will be the final drop. All those souls out of place will cause a lot of mayhem. You’ll need to act quickly if you don’t want the world to collapse.”
Dean felt happy. Unlike he had been in a very long time. He tried to keep the emotion down. Don't have false hope he told himself.
"My two most beloved sons: Michael and Lucifer, fighting together with my most beloved creations and their intended vessels."
He scanned his surroundings, searching for Jack and yelling his name. If Jack even heard him through the intense loud rumbling and rain.
"How perfect…" He chuckled, his eyes darting between Michael and something behind him, which turned to be Lucifer, stepping in frame.
I wanted to add a Bitch- jerk moment, but I couldn't fit it anywhere without it being odd, but besides that I think it turned out pretty great. I'm proud to say I finished a fanfiction for the first time ever and I want to thank you reader for reading. Hopefully this story made you feel better. Let me know what you thought + what you would add to the ending and have a great day/night.
He had thought that Cas was something he couldn’t have and now that he knew he could’ve… all this time. He would’ve rather gone without knowing at all.
“I’m disappointed guys. I tell you to make it entertaining and this is all you give me? Such a boring ending…”
Nausiau hit him as he warped to earth and crashed ungraceful on the ground. He groaned and lifted himself to his feet. His trenchcoat was smeared with mud, rain poured down on his face and his hair sticked to his forehead.
There was another lightning strike, but this time all around the beach. Dean counted at least 4 places the lightning struck.
How they convinced the Empty to go with their plan Cas didn’t really understand. Somewhere between telling it that when they were all gone he could go back to sleep and the world ending anyways had it convinced. Millions of angels and demons awake seemed to be torture for it, their power grew weaker and weaker. The Empty had told them that they could feel the movement of every single being like a spider in the middle of it’s spiderweb.
“Then came the situation with Michael and Lucifer.” He smiled. “Your story was supposed to end there…”
Dean took a deep breath and took the bunker in as it was. He trusted in Jack to succeed, but the possibility was always there that they wouldn’t make it back. Or perhaps only one of them wouldn’t. Dean hoped if it were that case that he would be the one to not make it back. He couldn’t handle another loss.
"It's over father." Jack said as he slowly lowered his head. Or he wasn't Jack. Something was off. His voice… different. Dean guessed if Chuck would be able to absorb Amara, Jack would be able to absorb Lucifer and Michael.
Dean gave them some privacy and searched the crowd for Jack. The fight wasn't near finished and perhaps he hoped he would bump into someone.
literal god could do. Even if they won… what next? All they could do is trust in Jack. Even though the kid didn’t trust himself. There was no nobler death than dying fighting for the sake of the world.
“You’re absolutely right. Let’s do that. I’m willing to forget all about his betrayal-” He eyed Crowley.  “-to work together.” Lucifer (not-so) humbly promised.
The wind and the rain stopped. The dark clouds disappeared and the sun came out. The light was overwhelmingly bright. Brighter as it should be. It wasn’t harmful though. On the contrary it comforted him.
Dean ripped a piece of fabric from his shirt- (not the flannel T-T) -and wrapped it around his leg as Chuck spoke.
Dean groaned as he regained consciousness. The car was upside down. Something smelled really bad. Dean’s guess was that the cars tank must have broken, leaking gas all over the sand and leather.
Cas noticed something in Benny’s eyes as he said Dean. He suppressed the lowkey jealousy and pulled Benny along.
“Yeah well loving me got him dead.” He turned his back to Jack and closed his eyes. “Like everyone always does.”
They entered and Dean clicked the music on. “The boys are back in town” started playing as Sam drove away. The bunker shrinking smaller and smaller in the distance.
The rain poured down with buckets. Dean felt his clothes grow damp in seconds and his shoes covered in mud. The sandstorm had made way for a rainstorm.
Cas nodded. Lucifer was right. No matter how it pained him to admit it. The enemy of my enemy really was his friend.
A flash of fear glowed in the human’s eyes as he gulped. May God help him for what was in store for him.
Bobby did not focus on the other hunter's weariness. Instead he continued to seek answers. "Then why isn't he with you?"
Sam and Bobby shared a worried glance but did not say another word.  Dean meanwhile turned up the radio and drummed to the beat of Ratt’s ‘Round and Round’ against the steering wheel. His brother was right. Anything to escape his dreams would suffice, and Dean needed something else to focus on. Already losing Cas was bad enough, but now with him haunting the hunter’s dreams… Dean was not sure how much more he can handle.
Crowley snorted. Figures that Castiel was still hounding after the elder Winchester. "I see somethings never change."
Sam snarled. "Are you even still the same angel, or did you consume him when you took over his vessel?"
The two men glared at one another for a long moment. The anger has burning inside them for such a long time.
A moment later, the waitress brought Bobby a steaming, hot cup of coffee. He muttered his thanks and blew off the steam.
Once when Sam retrieved the information, he made quick work heading to the motel room door. He stopped at room '108' and did a quick scan. The curtains and blinds were drawn tightly shut on the one window beside the door. The hunter could not analyze the perimeter he was about to breach. It sucked going in blind, but he had no other choice. Pulling out his lock picking tools, Sam unlocked the door and quickly entered inside.
. Dean was already hiding enough from his brother already. Sam just would not nut understand, so it was best to keep him in the dark. “Well what can I say, it’s happy hour somewhere,” Dean weakly responded before taking another swig of alcohol.
It all seems so hopeless, as they struggle to find ways to stop the Leviathans. Sam comes to a shocking realization about what happened to Amy.
Bobby was sitting on the couch with Sam redressing the bandages around the older man’s ribs. Not only did Bobby have two broken ribs, but the aging man suffered a dislocated shoulder and a fractured eye socket. Dean bit his lip to hold the anger he felt in as he glanced at his family on the couch. He felt guilty for not being there for Bobby. The hunter was lucky to be alive after the run in with that Leviathan.
With those words spoken, Cas broke the bonds that kept Dean chained to the bed, and the two vanished leaving Sam alone to process what he just witnessed.
When Cas's eyes locked onto Sam's hazel ones, he commented, "I see that you finally located your brother."
Before Bobby could respond, the bell over the door jingled, and Sam Winchester walked through the door. Sam's hazel eyes scanned for his friend, and Bobby waved the other hunter. As Sam walked over to the booth, his eyes narrowed at the sight of the demon sitting across from his surrogate father.
Dean bit his bottom lip. Oh yes, he knew. It had only been the focus of his haunting dreams lately. “I know,” he responded as he finally glanced up at the monster.
The bottle of whiskey fell to the ground from his loose grip, and Dean watched the bottle roll across the floor. His head was feeling a little bit fuzzy. Maybe he should have not drunk that much that fast. He closed his eyes and shook his head, which did nothing but make the dizziness worse. FUCK! Oh well. At least he wasn’t feeling those heavy emotions anymore. Both Castiel and Amy’s faces were gone from his mind. He barely registered his brother’s figure moving closer to him at a paced rate.
Castiel's jaw was covered in blood, and he still had a mouthful of his meal. He gestured for Dean to join him, and the ex-hunter was quick to move over to his lover's side. Castiel pulled his hunter to him and joined their mouths in a hungry kiss. Dean moaned as the Leviathan fed the blood to Dean through the kiss. The two licked the blood away from their lips and jaws when they broke away from their kiss.
Bobby leaned back as well and crossed his arms across his chest. “Look at all that has happened,” he spoke.
Castiel shook his head and walked toward the closet. Edgar was sudden to enter the motel door with two other Leviathans as Castiel continued, "I know they are there."
Blue eyes locked onto green ones, and Cas was quick to grab his slave's face in a tight, painful grasp. "And why should I?" the being's sole focus was on Dean.
Dean pointed to the side of his forehead and continued to shout, "The Leviathans. I am linked to all of them. I can tell you where all of them are!"
He found his brother tossing and turning on the couch. The older Winchester was muttering though Sam could not make out what. Suddenly, Dean’s eyes snapped open, and the glassy green eyes were watery from unshed tears. “Dean,” the younger Winchester muttered. The older sibling took a deep breath and willed the tears away as he moved into a sitting position. Sam sat down on the edge of the couch and placed a hand on his brother’s shoulder. The taller male knew something was up. His brother just did not cry for anything. Dean’s usual guarded expression hid the emotions that could have been found on his face only moments ago. Looks like Sam was not going to get any answers just yet.
Dean swallowed and looked into those eyes he always lost himself in. “Hey,” he replied in a cracked, weak voice.
Dean blushed violently before he wrapped himself in the bed sheet. Once he dressed semi modestly, Dean once again asked, "What are you doing here?"
“Really Sam, breaking the one thing that keeps you grounded makes my work so much easier,” Satan continued to goad the hunter.
Crowley, Bobby, and Sam quickly ducked for cover, but they maintained a visual. They recognized the two Leviathans. One was Edgar, and the other was one of the Leviathans that attacked the hunters. The unnamed Leviathan nodded his head as he accepted his orders from Edgar before turning around and walking away. Edgar watched the other Leviathan until he vanished before he turned around and headed back toward the motel. He stopped at room 23 and knocked before entering.
With a sigh, Sam moved away from his brother’s still comforting presence and headed to the cabin’s kitchen, or rather what could be called a kitchen. The fridge was broken, the sink was completely rusted, and the table was barely standing up. But Bobby managed to sit there with his books piled on the old wooden table. The Winchester sighed and took a seat across from his adoptive father figure. Like Dean, Bobby did not acknowledge his presence by looking up from the old, slightly smelly book. Sam cleared his throat; he needed someone to voice his worries to. And since Dean was out of the question because it was about him, that left only one choice.
It was hard for Bobby and Sam to admit defeat. But what else could they call this? The Leviathan that was once Castiel left the two hunters alone in the motel room. With their tails tucked between their legs, Bobby and Sam returned to their current hide out. They still had no new leads on the Leviathans' locations or a way to stop them. It was completely and utterly hopeless. It disheartened the two hunters, who worked to successfully avert the Apocalypse, that they might have lost this fight.
"I know," the Leviathan responded before turning his attentions toward the demon. A look of dread appeared on the demon's face. "You will not be missed though, and my body still wants you dead," Castiel admitted. The Leviathan's jaw unhinged, and Crowley was swallowed whole. When Castiel finished his meal, he frowned. "Demons always taste disgusting."
Sam tries to keep himself sane even though he keeps hallucinating Lucifer. Meanwhile, Dean is having nightmares, and they are still no closer to finding a way to stop the Leviathans.
"What is it Dean?" Bobby pleaded for answers, "No more lies or half truths. Please don't hide from us anymore."
Both young men were grateful for the interruption. Dean needed an escape from his suffocating thoughts while Sam was appreciative for the distraction. If he could focus on something else, it was much easier to ignore Lucifer’s imaginary presence. Both Bobby and Sam moved to sit at the table where a large pile of thick and dusty, heavy tomes rested. The dirty blond male grabbed a couple of the books and sat down on the couch. He preferred his own space to do the tedious task of research. This is how they spent most of their days now when they were not working on a case. There had to be a way to stop the damn Leviathans. They could not be invincible.
Castiel's hand reached between his lover's bypassed Dean's cock for the moment and went straight to his lover's entrance. The smile on Castiel's face widened when his hand brushed across the plug inserted in his lover's entrance. "I am glad to see you followed orders," the Leviathan spoke before pulling out the plug.
Edgar watched the two hunters, the only human threat to the Leviathans' reign. As long as the hunters stayed ignorant, they remained safe. Their leader was whipped, and wished to keep the two humans alive to make his little mate happy. Edgar would rather his leader break the ex hunter completely.
Sam's eyes practically jumped out of their sockets as he took in his brother's form before him. Dean was completely and utterly naked. More than that, the dark blond male was covered in bite marks and bruises that were in various stages of healing. The thing that made Sam Winchester sick was chain connecting Dean's left wrist to the bed.
Meanwhile, Dean still remained with the Leviathan that was once his angel. The Leviathan continued to twist Dean more and more, wiping away Dean's humanity. Dean and Castiel shared a meal together consisting of flesh and blood. Dean's hunger for human food dwindled down as the need for flesh and blood increased. It was clear to the former hunter that he was no longer entirely human. But he could not leave; no it was too late for that. The Leviathans played on his lingering emotions for the former angel, and Dean fully surrendered. He just hoped that one day Sam, Bobby, and even Castiel could forgive him.
As Edgar grabbed the Winchester, Dean began to buck in his hold. "No!" he shouted, "Don't hurt them, please Cas!" But Dean could say no more for Edgar vanished with the Winchester.
devious smile appeared on the demon's lips. It seemed that Sam had no clue about the true nature of the relationship between his brother and his angel.
Edgar looked down at him with interest in his dark eyes. Dean couldn’t believe what he was about to do.
Bobby muttered a curse underneath his breath. The demon barely gave the hunter any answers! Well at least they were close to getting an answer to stopping those damn Leviathans. But who could have the power to send them back to Purgatory? The Winchester brothers walked into the motel room as Bobby thought about the answer. The older man glanced at the siblings with disbelief in his eyes. Sam was soaked to the bone, and Dean had blood all over him.
I originally planned this to be a two-part story. I am not sure if I should continue this into a sequel. What do you guys think?
Remember this is a reimagining of season 7. I wrote this when the second episode of the season aired. I hope you guys like this!

“Then it’s settled,” Dean states with a heartfelt smile. “But don’t go anywhere, alright? Like, ever again, you hear me?”
He watches it all play out, again, and again, and again. He’s tried everything to change it, to speak, to move, to do
did it. Sam lost, because he thought it would take "At least another 10 years of intense eye stares before one of them breaks.” Sam had witnessed too much of it to not believe they could go on like that, almost forever. But Eileen had jokingly bet that it would happen “After one of them dies and comes back alive, again.” So.. now he owes her.. a kiss on the cheek. Eh, a win-win situation, really.

“Huh, okay, I’m pretty sure I know where it is and we’re not that far off. Sammy and I will look it up and make sure though, but we’ll be there in like one hour, tops. Then we’re going to get Eileen,” Dean says, content.
that way I guess.. And I did think about it.. quite a few times actually.. I just kinda assumed that, you know, you with your angelic, feathery ass.. that you
Sam and Dean have been on the road for a few hours now. Although, to Dean, it feels like an eternity. They’re going to get Eileen, which is great.. It is.. but there’s a nagging sensation at the back of Dean’s mind that he can’t get rid of. He’s been trying to place where exactly it stems from, but all he’s been able to figure out is that it seems to be spreading all throughout his body, as well as the fact that it gets worse every time he looks over at Sam.
were? And you’ve left us so many times.. and I don’t blame you for that.. But I thought that maybe you didn’t care, that you didn’t
...” he whispers to the ground, shaking his head hopelessly, as tears begin to break the surface tension. Slowly but surely growing in numbers, trickling down his face, more and more at a time.
? Then does that mean he-? “How do I know that this is actually you?” Dean asks imploringly, breaking his own train of thought. What he wants most of all in the world, in all of the worlds that have ever existed, is for Cas to be back, but he has to make
The line is quiet at first. Sam looks over at Dean questioningly, Dean shrugs in response. He’s about to hang up, but before he gets that far, when he’s removed the phone from his ear, hovering over the ‘end call’ button, the person on the other end speaks.
“Yeah, Cas, what is it?” Dean gets worried for a second, thinking that something may be wrong.. again.
“I’m fine, Sammy, don’t worry about it,” Dean responds in a would-be light tone, putting on a fake smile, which his brother reluctantly returns. A few moments pass by without either of them saying anything. The only sound to be heard is the consistent humming of the Impala’s engine, and the semi-regular
He sounds almost as groggy as Dean does, but there’s no mistaking it. A few seconds pass by, although they feel like years, and Dean can’t find the words to respond. “It’s good to hear your voice,” the angel continues, maybe in an almost too casual manner.
“After I used the scythe to cut out my own grace, I used it to kill the Empty.. And I’ve thought about it, and I would argue that ‘the Empty’ more accurately portrays its name now.. since it’s, you know, actually empty,” Cas tells Dean, with a smirk.
“Cas?” Dean asks disbelievingly, having put the phone back to his ear by now, clutching it with both of his hands, still worried that
. It was.. um... At the time I couldn’t really process what was happening, or what you were saying, ‘cause it was just a bit too much, you know..  I mean, you were gonna die, man..” He shakes his head as his vision gets clouded by tears. “You know I’m not good with all of this.. emotional stuff.. but I want you to know that...” He clears his throat, attempting to make his voice sound clearer, more sure of itself, but alas, failing miserably. “It meant
says it, after all this time, he feels like some of the weight he was carrying has been lifted. Relief washes over him and he smiles, a genuine one this time. But as fast as it appeared, it disappears again, almost like Chuck used what was left of his godly powers to trick him again, ripping the rug out from underneath him. The star’s
is what feeling free is really, truly, like, then he can’t wait to feel that a whole lot more from now on.
It’s familiar in a sense, because Dean has felt this way several times over the past decade. The feeling of loss that’s so profound, so deep, so unforgetting, unforgiving, infinite. But he still doesn’t get it. They were supposed to finally be free, they beat God for.. Earth’s sake. The biggest hurdle, the last boss, the epic finale, they beat it all,
Dean sobs. And he knows, he’s known deep down, for a long time. The same phrases keep flashing before his eyes over and over. He can hear
Sam on the other hand, is doing just fine, he’s been texting with Eileen almost constantly since they got in the car, and he is, to an extent, happy. They did it, once again, saved the world and all that. Brought everyone back.. Well, almost everyone. Dean was the one who said that they were ‘finally free’ before they left, but Sam knows that’s a bit too good to be true. It’s been four hours now, and Dean has spent the entirety of it, with a pained expression on his face, staring straight ahead at the road. That, to Sam, doesn’t look like someone who’s ‘finally free’. He tried talking with him at first, but he soon got the message Dean was trying to send, more on a mental wavelength than a technological one this time. His brother was not in a mood for talking, and when Dean doesn’t want to talk, Sam has learnt it’s better to leave him be, until he’s ready to open up about it. Although, this time, he’s pretty sure he knows what’s wrong.
second his mind starts to drift it all plays out before him again, and he can’t make it stop. It hurts the same amount as it did the first time, but no matter how much Dean wants to, he can’t change it. No.. he can’t do this now, he needs a distraction. So Dean finally decides to turn to Sam. Maybe it won’t be so bad this time, and hey, they should actually stop and get some food soon anyway. He sure could use another drink by now. When Dean turns his head, Sam huffs a quiet laugh at his phone.
“I just want to confirm that, yes, we are in fact, ‘a couple of dumbasses’.. as you so nicely put it.” Dean can hear the air quotes even from one state over. He rolls his eyes in mild exasperation.
“Are you okay? Where are you? Are you hurt? Wait- hold on, Cas, I need to tell you something.” He was not going to let this chance slip by. Not ever again.
be. He feels the anger flooding back, all of the emotions he doesn’t understand, that he hasn’t gotten a hold of, and he can’t take it anymore. By some divine power, which certainly isn’t Chuck, Dean stands up with such force that he surprises even himself. Sam looks up at him with a startled expression and asks, “Dean, what are you-”
The pain seems to be itching its way deeper, burying itself into the core of Dean’s soul. It’s not like he thought he could run forever, but he sure as hell thought he would get further than this. All of the hurt is tearing at the edges of the wound, making the hole bigger, consuming whatever good that was left there, devouring it, leaving Dean..
As soon as his eyes start welling up, Dean shuts it down by clearing his throat and blinking the tears away.
He’s taken back, to a place he recognises very well, and even though it’s not a pleasant occurrence, he’s gotten used to it by now, but so far only in his sleep.
It’s getting dark now, and when Dean takes a step outside, he’s greeted by the gentle breeze of the wind, and fresh air filling his lungs. He sighs heavily and thinks,
After a couple of shallow breaths, he does feel like the words are easing the anger a little bit, but to Dean’s distress, they give him just as much heartache. It seems like they’ve opened up the wound again, and no amount of rage can distract him from the gaping hole that’s growing and growing, somewhere close to his soul. He feels
This time Dean can hear that Cas is crying too. Dean blushes, embarrassed, but in the best way possible.
Dean looks down, suddenly getting a rush of anxiety. He takes another shuddering breath, trying to calm himself, collect his thoughts. But it’s hard when he could have sworn that he, for a second, could see the blue star changing its gaze. Making it burn right through his eyes, straight into his soul, challenging him, no.. not challenging him,
Dean wakes up, surprised. His phone is buzzing, someone’s calling him. It’s not a number he recognises, but he picks up like usual.
, Dean thinks, and the feeling gets more pressing than ever. If he was being honest, he’d admit that he’s a bit taken aback by it. Because whatever emotion it is, it hurts.. and it feels like.. like envy. Sam raises his head, their eyes meet, and Dean instantly has to look away again. As soon as he saw his brother’s smile fading that quickly; the happiness that Sam was exuding now changing to something completely different, pity maybe, he couldn’t bear to keep looking. Dean didn’t realise that his own expression spoke louder than anything he had put into words before this, but he did notice his eyes starting to burn, and he felt uncomfortable, vulnerable.
Sam and Dean were alive? Cas perked up, maybe he could find a way to go back. Surely the empty wouldn’t be able to hold millions of awake angels? Sam and Dean must have done something to wake them all up. It wasn’t just a coincidence.
They had been driving for 45 minutes when it happened. One second they were in a countryside, nothing but grass and farmland for miles, the next second the surroundings changed into white rocks and trees.
It was unnatural in a supernatural world. There was a balance holding everything together and it was crumbling.
“What the hell?” Dean mumbled as he looked out of the window. The weather was great, sunny and almost no clouds. He wondered if Chuck had done that on purpose.
Crowley looked over to Cas. “Oh great, so we are gonna team up with the guy who killed me? Wonderful.”
Lucifer gave him a little wave. “Heya Cas.”  he looked down at the knife and smiled. “I don’t think that’s going to work here… You see, I’m already dead.”
Jack threw his head back in his neck and his eyes lit up like flashlights. Not a second later Michael and Lucifer dropped limp to the ground. Dean took a step backwards and bumped into Sam.
“You lose.” Sam said with a (bloody) toothy smile. Both him and Dean turned to look at Jack standing next to the impala.
"What do you say Luci? Joining forces at last?" Michael smiled at him. Their history forgotten, at least for now. Lucifer's shoulders relaxed and grinned back. "That's what I've always wanted."
Cas stared. He was ashamed to realise he had almost forgotten about him. But to be fair they didn’t really have a good relationship during purgatory. He didn't trust Benny then… but now he has come to respect Benny for all that he had done for Dean.
All things combined Cas felt as alive as ever. His coat grew heavy as it soaked. He held up a hand to see through the rain.
Sam jumped up in an instant and stabbed Chuck where his heart was supposed to be. Dean gave Jack’s shoulder a rough push and he woke up with a small gasp. Dean pressed a finger against his lip and eyed towards Chucks direction.
“Delightfull.” Crowley chirped in and stood up from his… chair? Glaring daggers into Lucifers soul with his arms crossed.
Dean had to admit it wasn’t easy to be so open about his emotions, but with all that had happened he was due for a change.
He prayed to Castiel to get his feathery ass over here so they could have a proper reunion. Dean doubted Cas could hear him. His voicemail was probably packed with hundreds of angels. Castiel had become one of the most popular angels after all.
"I- was fighting Chuck… spiritually. I've never experienced something so intense, beautiful and confusing before. The things I saw- I wouldn't even know how to explain."
"DEAN!" He yelled again and this time Dean's head whipped around. Cas wondered if he hurt his neck with that movement.
The world rumbled as heaven, purgatory and hell followed not long after. The barrier between the living and the dead was officially gone. Anyone could cross in or out if they wanted. Angels swarm towards the stray souls and escaped monsters, picking them up in an instant and thinning out the crowd.
“... no” Sam responded. He couldn’t see Sam’s face as it was blocked by his hair (they really need to cut it.), but Dean didn’t spot any life threatening injuries.
Jack had his hands on Chuck's head, absorbing God’s powers. Chuck tried to break from the hold and threw a punch to Jack's jaw that failed. “You will-” Chuck struggeled and gave Jack a headbut that Dean felt meters away.
“I do.” He smiled. “I believe in you more than I do in myself. If anyone in this world can do it. It’s you.” Dean said, conveying as much confidence in his words as he could.
“And guess what?! Turns out that after all this time you have opened your eyes and me, the oh-so-generous guy that I am, have decided to help you.”
Oh hey, so you are the kind of person that reads notes too huh? I see u and I appreciate u. Hope you enjoy this chapter <3
Dean woke up feeling great. He felt semi-great when he remembered what day it was. He put on a bathrobe and followed the smell of bacon and eggs to the kitchen. Sam and Jack already chatting at the counter.
“Oh and one more thing.” The empty said, standing before them in his Cas form. Except this time Cas didn’t look at an exact copy of himself. The other Cas looked like a corpse, his skin pale and blueish with dark circles under his eyes. Cas’s best guess was that the Empty was exhausted and it reflected on his form.
He smiled as he noticed the figures of Sam and Dean. He swallowed the lump in his throat and yelled. "Dean!"
Sam rubbed the fresh scar on his palm. Lucifer was not real, and the human was now out of the cage. The devil can no longer get to the younger Winchester. Sam was safe. He kept telling himself this over and over. Eventually it will sink in, and he will no longer suffer. Just like Dean. Dean managed to deal with his forty years in the pit, and Sam will be able to do the same thing. He was a Winchester damn it. He has been through whatever life has thrown at him with a give ‘em hell attitude like his brother, and he always made it to other side. Sam will get through this as well. He had to keep telling himself that and believe.
The sound of clapping brought him out of himself. Sam turned his head to the left and saw Lucifer standing there with a smug grin gracing his thin lips. “Bravo Sam, bravo,” the devil mockingly congratulated.
“After everything I have done for you, the only return I get is betrayal after betrayal,” Castiel lowered his voice as he moved away from the insufferable former hunter.
Bobby whispered back, “Not much. Seen some Leviathans around a lot lately, and unless they are in places like hospitals they have to be up to something.”
The one called Chaz eyed Bobby before looking at his partner. “Maybe, but you know that you can’t just yet,” Chaz responded as he licked his lips.
Castiel quickly tossed his lover onto the bed before climbing over him. Their lips met once more in a hungry embrace. Dean moaned as their tongues danced, and he ran his fingers through Castiel's dark locks. Castiel broke away, and he was quick to strip his body of the clothes he wore.
Both Crowley and Sam nodded their heads. For now, all they could do was wait. Hopefully, it would not be long until they could act.
Dean nodded his head and squeezed his brother shoulder. Sammy was really making progress in all honesty. The green-eyed hunter knew in time, Sam would increasingly get better.
Sam turned his head when he heard the door open. He offered a small smile to his brother. Rather than greet his brother, Dean grabbed his flask and took a large swig after dropping the bags onto the table. Though the younger Winchester knew his brother wasn’t looking, Sam glared at his sibling. Dean has been drinking a lot lately, more so than normal; it was just like when he got out of Hell. Sam knew his brother was hiding something, and considering all that has been happening, he hasn’t pushed the subject. But one way or another, the younger brother was going to get the truth.
The hunter leaned closer to the other male, his interests peaked. “Is it an amulet, charm, or spell?” Bobby questioned with such curiosity.
Edgar glanced at the other Leviathan that joined him at the table. The creature was in the shape of a young woman with dirty blond hair and dark brown eyes.
Dean stood from the couch with a huff. He went to his duffel to put on a pair of pants and a t-shirt on. “You got nothing to worry about little brother,” he spoke with a stiff posture.
Standing in the doorway, Bobby watched the scene with pride shining in his grey eyes. The bond between the Winchester brothers was stronger than ever. Bobby knew neither of them could get past the hardships they are facing without the support of the other. The aging hunter cleared his throat to make his presence known. The Winchester brothers’ heads snapped to Singer’s direction. “Are we going to stand around and braid each other’s hair, or are we going to get some work done?” Bobby sarcastically commented as he marched into the main room. It was time to get down to business.
Sam wiped his face to hide the angst he felt. "Bobby, it was like Dean was a different person," the Winchester began.
Sam nodded his head. "He wasn't our Cas though. He tried to go after me, but Dean convinced him that I wasn't a threat. Then he took a chunk out of Dean's neck and disappeared with Dean," Sam finished recalling.
Licking his lips, Dean explained. "I can't go with you Sam. He will know I'm gone." He reached for Sam's face. "They are better at torture than any demon. It's not safe."
Sam eyes swept the area all around him. He had to admit his brother was right. Didn’t look like there were any Leviathans here or ever been. Fuck! And the younger Winchester was hoping to at least knock those things back a bit.
Sam had noticed his brother’s little momentary slip up. This was not like Dean; he never lost it on a hunt before. The younger Winchester was not kidding when he admitted his brother on the hunt scares him. Dean will get so focused and driven, and he won’t stop until they stopped whatever evil they were after.
Dean turned around when he noticed his brother’s unusual quietness. The sight of his younger sibling struggling so got an immediate reaction from the elder Winchester. Dean immediately put a comforting hand on Sam’s broad shoulder. “Hey, this is reality. He is not real,” Dean comforted while gathering his brother in his arms.
Dean thought with some amusement. He closed his eyes as another wave of dizziness attacked. He opened his glassy green eyes and looked straight into his brother’s angry hazel ones.
Crowley moved to sit down at the table across from the hunter he had personal dealings with in the past. “Well a little birdie told me some news that you might like to hear,” the demon began.
Immediately, the hazel eyed hunter was listing all the reasons why he did not need to go to Bobby's but rather straight to this new lead. "I got to go there Bobby," the Winchester confessed with a tight expression on his face.
Meanwhile, Bobby checked his phone; he had one new text message. He opened the text before looking back at the Winchester boys. “Go ahead without me,” Bobby stated, “Find out who the witch is and use the spell.”
Instinctively sensing he was no longer alone in the room, Dean was quick to open his green orbs. He blinked several times as he shook away the cobwebs in his mind. Glancing toward the door out of instinct, Dean came face to face with his brother.
Sam’s phone ringing brought him out of his thoughts. With a sigh, he pulled out his cell phone and answered. It was Bobby.
An hour later, Sam was pulling into the motel from Dean's credit card. Parking the Impala, Sam scanned for any immediate threats; when he found none, he raided the trunk for some protection. The hunter had no idea what he was up against, so he had to be prepared for anything. He grabbed the demon blade, the angel blade they stole from Balthazar, and a sawed-off shot gun. With those weapons, Sam slammed the trunk closed and headed for the front desk.
Dean stared at the hand offered. Most of him longed to escape with his family, but it is too late for that. He flinched away from the offered gesture; his eyes lowered to the ground. "I can't go with you Sammy," his voice shook with the truth.
Bobby looked at the old resourceful book pertaining to hints of Purgatory. There had to be something about the damn Leviathans somewhere. But so far the seasoned hunter has found nothing! It was infuriating! But then again, the Leviathans have been trapped in Purgatory since before there were even demons around. Bobby shut the book with a frustrated grunt. He had no idea what they were going to do. Nothing was going their way. And now there was no extra help. No angels to guide them to the right path… nothing. The hunter rubbed his face in weariness. Feels like now they were helpless, and there seemed like no hope. How can they win this one? Maybe this time there was not going to be a win from team free will. Maybe this really was the end.
Sam crossed his arms. He watched as Dean reached for his flask on the table and took a large gulp. “Oh yeah, then why are you drinking first thing if you are so ok?” questioned the younger sibling with slight indignation.
Hunting instincts kicking in, the elder Winchester spun on his heels. But he was too slow. Whoever it was, hit the hunter hard across the face knocking him out instantly, face first, onto the cold floor.
There was a heavy sigh on the other end of the call before Bobby began, "Got a notification that one of Dean's aliases used to check into a hotel."
Crowley folded his hands on the table and the smugness could not be wiped from his face. "Well I think I found a way to shove those nasty Leviathans back into Purgatory."
It took a few minutes before Dean began to stir back to consciousness. He shook his head to clear away the dizziness that was clouding him. Man that was definitely going to leave a bruise, and he will need to have Sam check him to make sure he did not suffer a concussion.  By the way, Dean inwardly questioned, where were his brother and surrogate father? The hunter looked around and a look of horror marred his handsome face. Sam was being used as a punching bag, and Bobby was on the brink of unconsciousness. Dean had to do something. He needed to get up and fight. He couldn’t lose two of the people that mattered most to him.
Bobby realized at once what they were dealing with. Leviathans. Well it was safe to say they were completely and utterly screwed.
“I can’t believe we are on another witch hunt,” Dean nagged as he pulled out onto the state road with a squeal of the tires.
Dean rolled his eyes at the lack of agreement from the other two men. What could he say; Dean hated witches!
The other two Leviathans watching were practically shaking in excitement as they listened to their prey’s words. They will be honored for they had accomplished.
Dean took a step back from his brother. It was the hardest thing he had to do, but it had to be done. "Sam," he warned.
Castiel seemed pleased by his lover's answers. He sat up in bed, and the dark smiled returned to his lips. He pulled his pants back on and commented, "Then you know that lovers should never keep secrets from one another."
“I know Bobby, but it’s gotten so much worse ever since he confronted me after Amy….” Sam had stopped speaking after the realization hit him like a ton of bricks. He jumped out of his chair and headed back into the living room with a determined and angry look at his face. He needed to discuss a few things with his brother.
Dean's legs tightened around his lover's waist when Castiel began to slowly pull out. Castiel decided to shut his lover up with a kiss. The pace his hips set up was slow but brutal. Castiel made sure to brush again Dean's prostate with every thrust. As Dean's hand crept toward his leaking member, Castiel slapped his hand away.
At that moment, the Impala’s engine roared in the motel’s parking lot. The demon and the hunter looked back at one another. Both agreed it was best for the demon to avoid being in the Winchester’s presence for the time being. Dean was liable to send Crowley back to Hell after what happened to his angel. “
Bobby arrived at the diner ten minutes early. As soon as he sat down, the aging hunter was quick to order a cup of coffee. It seemed like everything kept going from bad to worse these past couple of years. Bobby sighed with such a bone deep weariness. When was this all suppose to end? Who was going to be left standing when this does all end?
, tells Dean that he may not only be talking about Dean’s bad sleep schedule. That, he elects to ignore for now, but he doesn’t see any point in arguing with him either. He only wishes that he actually could sleep.
, but he can’t. Dean’s forced to watch the worst scene of his life repeating itself on an endless loop. Like Chuck planted one last trap by jamming the replay button on his favourite show, Dean’s despair. But he knew that this was inescapable, the question was always just until how long. His subconscious, where he desperately tried to bury all of it, has inevitably caught up with him. And Dean realises that it’s all because of
