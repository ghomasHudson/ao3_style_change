“-and you couldn’t even bother to show up for him? I know you had something going on with Steve, but not being there for your kid-”
“Do you want to?” Tony asks. He studies Steve’s face, searching for an indication that he’s against the idea. All he finds is uncertainty. “Hey,” he says, squeezing Steve’s hand again until their eyes are meeting. “We can do whatever you want. If you want to try again then we can.”
“‘M fine,” Tony directs his attention toward the window, scowling at the scene he finds. Being seen by the press when he was clearly sporting a baby bump was the last thing he wanted. He was dealing with enough as it was. “Can we just go? I knew this was a bad idea.”
Steve is ripped from his thoughts when the elevator dings and the doors open. He spins around when a tall woman with red hair enters the living room. Her head is cast down, manicured nails clicking away on a device Steve can’t recognize.
Tony takes control again and their lips meet in another heated kiss. Tony doesn’t waste anymore time, knowing they were already pushing it. Sooner or later someone was going to look for them.
But not to him. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. The light in the room didn’t offer much, but it was enough to illuminate the bright hair on her head. She squirms, small whimpers escaping her when she’s forced to endure the same harsh treatment the room has to offer. Steve brings her closer, hoping the natural warmth he produces would be enough.
Steve pushes again, groaning when he feels himself stretch. The baby’s head emerges fully, followed by a gush of fluid, and Steve collapses back, panting hard as he tries to regain his breathing. “Tony...please…” Steve begs, wanting him to take away the excruciating pain.
“He is and his name isn’t Tony Junior,” Steve says, chuckling when the alpha frowns. “Jarvis did give me a suggestion though.”
Peter glances around at his family, noticing that still one important person was missing. He hates that he begins to fear the worst. His dad wouldn’t bail on him. He had been there for the ceremony, and there was no reason why he wouldn’t show up now.
Morgan is up two hours later. Tony hears her first and his eyes shoot open, immediately landing on the alarm clock sitting on the nightstand beside him. He rolls over, preparing himself to wake up and attend to his fussy baby.
Happy is busy at the island preparing a plate, and he peers up when he notices Steve’s presence. “Hey. I ordered some food in case you were hungry. Also Tony called.”
The room is colder than the rest of the apartment, but the change in temperature goes ignored. The first thing Tony notices is how clean and organized the space is. It was obvious that this room was off limits. It’s not packed away in boxes like the other rooms Tony had seen on the tour.
“You and him...I enjoy it too. You beat yourself up but in reality you’re a good father. Better than you think. Pete loves you. And so do I.”
Tony hangs his head, quiet sobs escaping him. He wishes he could go back and do things differently. Leaving Steve alone, especially when he was in a sensitive and fragile state of mind was Tony’s mistake. His biggest was not paying more attention to the signs earlier.
“I know he doesn’t. I know it’s going to take time. But I’m willing to wait. I already hurt him once and I don’t want to do it again. If Steve knew that I’ve already made him cry…” Tony sighs harshly and scrubs a hand over his face. He doesn’t want to think about Steve and how disappointed he’d be with him.
Steve wants to accept that a child was not in the cards, but he can’t help but yearn for one. He said no more trying. And maybe right now they would take a break. Maybe they just needed some time until they were both ready.
Tony chuckles and leans closer until he’s close enough to rest his head over the bump. His eyes fall shut and he rubs his hand in small circles. “Hey, Pete. You better be good for, mama.”
Peter opens the compass and his eyes flood with tears. The picture staring back at him wasn’t of his own face, but of himself and his papa.
He doesn’t shake him awake this time, and instead, he crawls into bed with him and holds him close. His behavior shocks him but he can’t pull away from the omega. His alpha won’t let him.
“That’s okay.” Tony sits down beside Steve, his eyes immediately landing on their son. “We’ll figure it out.”
“He’s just upset,” Bruce says when he notices the look that crosses Tony’s face. “He’s not blaming-”
“You know he’s not gonna respond.” Comes a familiar voice. Steve glances up, his face lighting up when he finds his best friend entering the room.
It wasn’t going to be easy to start over, but it was the best choice. Steve was still fragile and it was difficult to say just how long he’d remain in that state. He was improving, growing stronger and stronger every day. Little by little more of himself was coming out.
There had been a point in Steve’s life where he was sure he’d never know what true happiness felt like. When he was growing up sick, frail and in a world where alphas came first, he still had moments of happiness and joy. He had a best friend and a mother who loved him. It didn’t matter if he was suffering from poverty, another case of pneumonia, or from the bullies that tormented him on a daily basis. As long as he had the people he cared about most, then nothing else mattered.
The thought of calling him again enters Steve’s mind, but then so does the idea of a letter. Steve was old fashioned, there was no point in denying that, and maybe it was time he reached out to Tony in a way he was more familiar with.
“Hey. You can do this. I promise you’re stronger than you think. I never could have done what you did. I’m not as strong as you.”
Flash takes this moment to reach for his water again, wondering if there was someway he could drown himself in it.
Steve can’t even begin to imagine what went through his pups’ minds all these years. He’s grateful Harley and Sarah are younger. Perhaps they don’t remember much of the abuse. But James was older. He must remember some things. His protective attitude wasn’t just an alpha trait.
Tony smirks and spreads his legs a bit, showing off the bulge in his underwear. That sight alone is enough to send all of the blood in Steve’s body down south. His own cock stirs in interest.
Tony grips the edge of the sink, his knuckles nearly white from how hard he’s gripping the surface. His shoulders sag and his head hangs between them. The tears he’s been holding back can no longer be contained and they spill from his eyes, running down his face and creating wet tracks along his cheeks. His shoulders shake with each sob that rips through him.
“Do you want me to try?” Steve asks, holding out his arms. Tony shakes his head and continues to rock and speak soothingly to their son. Steve sighs and drops his arms to his side. “I feel so helpless.”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and glances back down at the test still in his hand. Tony had suggested he read the results. Steve had been nervous at first, afraid of getting his dreams crushed again. But now it’s starting to sink in, and he couldn’t be happier.
Peter huffs and adjusts the strap of his backpack over his shoulder. He takes one last glance at the tower, then he heads in the opposite direction.
Once the appointment is over and Tony gets his next one set up, they leave hand in hand with bright smiles on their faces. They were having a boy.
“Steve, darling, Bruce is here.” Tony continues to rub Steve’s back, making sure to add more pressure where Steve needs it most.
Tony pulls away, another sigh escaping him. “I want to keep kissing you and maybe a few other things, but this isn’t really how this part is supposed to go. I think you’re the only one I’ve fucked after a breakup.”
Steve hadn’t realized how hungry he was until the smell of freshly baked pizza filled his nose. His stomach growls and he’s practically drooling when Tony opens the first box to show off a large Brooklyn style pepperoni pizza. It had been JARVIS’ suggestion.
“I just feel...I don’t know. Maybe it’s almost time. I know you like to be prepared and this needs to get done anyway. I probably won’t be in medical long and I have no idea what I’m going to need,” Tony says, frowning at the items he’s packed so far. He has an outfit for their son to come home in, a change of clothes for himself, toiletries, and one of his tablets.
Steve frowns and glances down at his blood covered hands and the mess he’s created in the room. He peers up at his mate again. “Tony...Tony, I’m sorry. I didn’t-”
The team is ready and beginning to load the jet. Tony lingers behind, that sense of hesitation clouding his decision to leave. FRIDAY has already alerted Tony that his teammates were waiting for him.
The door to the master bedroom is slightly ajar. Tony stops when he comes to it, his stomach twisting into knots. He’s almost afraid of what he’s going to find once he pushes the door open. He slowly presses the door forward. Then he sees him.
The faucet has stopped running, indicating that Steve was finishing up his nightly routine. The light switches off and Steve appears, still grinning. Tony narrows his eyes at him, suddenly wishing he could wipe that silly grin from his boyfriend’s face.
Tony from the beginning had been an alpha that Steve admired. They had their fair share of struggles like all couples do, but at the end of it all, Steve was going to choose Tony no matter what. It had been Tony who rescued him and their young pup, Peter. If not for him, Steve’s not sure what kind of horror him and his pup would’ve faced.
The sobs are soft, almost as if Steve was trying to keep quiet, but Tony could hear them and his heart breaks at the sound. Knowing that sleep was never going to come, he throws the blanket off and heads toward Steve’s room.
Brock Rumlow and Jack Rollins. The two were always assigned to retrieve him. It was their special orders to make sure he was kept in check. They were the most respected among the team. They were Alpha’s right hand men.
“I know that!” Steve finally raises his own voice. “I know he’s young but so was I, Tony. We both were.”
The last thing Steve wants to do is panic, but he can’t help the uneasy feeling that washes over him. This was all wrong. From the very moment they knew they were expecting, Tony had promised to be there for more than just the birth. And for the most part he kept that promise. Tony did everything and anything to prevent himself from missing a single moment. He had been there for the gender reveal, the first kick; nothing was missed.
“What kind of pain? Do I need to go?” Tony is already jumping to his feet. He stops when Steve assures him he’s fine. “Are you sure? Is this it?”
“I know,” Steve turns back toward his mate, “but I’m willing to do it again. I’m going to need someone to talk to.”
“Hey.” Steve finally finds his voice. He doesn’t open the door, keeping his belly still hidden from Tony’s view. It would be easier to probably open the door all the way and shout ‘surprise!’ but that wasn’t how Steve had wanted to do this.
Okay so let me start off by saying that I had a few different ideas for my alternate ending, but a while back one of my wonderful readers brought up Tahiti and I couldn’t help but want to know what it was ( I didn’t watch Agents of Shield 😬) But then I liked the idea of a fallen Avenger coming back to life and I just had to take a stab at it. Now mind you I never watched the show and kind of went off what I researched. I kept things vague because well…I don’t know what I’m doing lol not really. But I didn’t want Steve dead…especially when my brain came up with a sequel of sorts. We’ll see if I can write a follow up 😆 I mean I have to, right? Steve is alive and everyone needs to know about it. Especially Tony and Peter.
It’s the sound of muffled voices that stirs Steve awake. He’s almost tempted to ignore the noise and go back to sleep. His body is drained from the hard labor and birth. He didn’t want to sleep for another sixty five years, but another hour or two wouldn’t hurt.
Peter takes a deep breath to calm himself, then as casually as he can, makes his way over. He stops when a larger man comes out from the building to greet his dad. They’re talking about something Peter can’t quite hear as they make their way up the steps and toward the doors.
Steve and Tony share a look before Steve is answering the question with a nod. He glances down at his son, a smile forming over his face.
“You good?” Steve looks over his son, frowning at what he finds. He’s seen his son sick more times than he can count, and each time it broke his heart. “Sweetheart, you can stay home.”
“She’s getting so big,” Steve says during another visit. He reaches out for her, smiling brightly when Tony grants him permission and passes Morgan to him. “Hi, sweetheart,” Steve coos. He gets one in response.
Tony lies back and Steve hovers over him, their lips never parting. Steve breaks away to attach his lips to Tony’s neck, emitting a soft sigh from his husband. Tony groans and tangles his fingers in Steve’s hair, tugging harshly when Steve bites and sucks along the sensitive skin on his neck.
They don’t make it to the kitchen. Steve’s phone dings on the way, forcing him to put his son down so he can check the message. Nick’s name appears on the screen and Steve sighs.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers to their son as he continues to stroke the baby’s cheek. The tears haven’t stopped since they both discovered that their son had died in the womb.
Tony grunts when he reaches his release and he spills his third load inside Steve’s body. Steve follows soon after, moaning out Tony’s name when he comes.
Steve couldn’t relate but he remembers putting it on for the pups before. He’d rather hear Elmo than the snotty pig.
Peter glances at his dad, hating the big ugly bruise decorating his left cheek. The blood from the wound flows steadily down his face, droplets of red forming on the nice button up Tony had worn for the occasion. He wonders how his papa would have acted if he had been there. Peter knows exactly how. It’s what he plans on doing now.
He smiles fondly at the memories of gathering in the common room while they ate, talked, and laughed. They were more than just a group of superheroes. They were friends. They were family.
“Shit!” Tony gasps and both hands cradle Steve’s belly. “You’re-wow. How did this happen? I mean I know how but I didn’t think it would...sorry, I’ll shut up.”
His mind is whirling, unable to fully comprehend the situation. He shouldn’t have a baby. He wasn’t pregnant...at least, he thought he wasn’t. And yet in his arms was the son he never knew about.
Tony rises from his chair and crosses the conference room to grab a couple of water bottles from the mini fridge. He returns to Steve’s side and offers his mate one. Steve gladly accepts it.
Tony jumps up and glances over his shoulder at the piece of furniture. “Sorry,” he mutters and sits down on the sofa across from Natasha. “I didn’t know.”
His fingers dig back into his pocket and he retrieves his phone again. He hovers over the contact information for a moment before finally making the call and pressing the phone to his ear. It rings and rings; his leg shakes the entire time. Then, finally, the other line picks up.
The towel Bruce had wrapped him in is adjusted; Tony makes sure his son is warm and comfortable until they can properly clean him off and dress him. Tony doesn’t touch him at first, still unable to shake the mixture of shock and awe that’s running through him. He backs off, giving Steve a moment to properly bond with their son.
A small smile forms on Steve’s face. He takes Tony’s hand and leads it to the place he was beating himself up over just minutes prior. Tony doesn’t rip his hand away or grimace in disgust. He smiles that smile that let’s Steve know that everything is going to be okay.
“Hey,” Steve greets and sits down beside his mate, leaning in close to bury his nose in Tony’s neck and inhale the familiar scent. “I missed you today.”
Tony huffs and rolls his eyes. “Fine. Speaking of your pants…” Tony’s gaze drops down to the hem of Steve’s jeans. He runs a finger over the band before dipping it inside. “These are a little snug on you, huh?”
“Shit! Are you sure?” Tony rushes toward him, one hand falling to Steve’s middle and he feels it harden underneath his fingertips.
Pepper smiles softly and lays a hand over his shoulder. Her touch was nice and offered comfort, but it didn’t compare to Steve’s touch.
Steve only cries out in response. The contractions are coming one after the other, not once giving Steve a chance to catch his breath. Another one is beginning to build and when it peaks, Steve can’t hold back the small scream. Tears blur his vision and he shuts his eyes to hold them in, but a few escape and roll down his face.
They were supposed to go again during the summer. There were a lot of things they were supposed to do. Plans that had been made. Now it was all broken.
“Sounds good to me,” Tony eventually answers the question. He’s occupied with the dough, his hands in the glass bowl and sticky. Steve can’t help but giggle when Tony makes a face. “What?” Tony narrows his eyes at Steve.
“No.” Tony shakes his head. “That wasn’t your fault. I know you probably did everything you could. Steve, you need to understand that you had no control. Don’t blame yourself.”
Steve didn’t know why he believed that something would show up on the screen once the technician pressed the transducer to his belly. His entire focus is on the screen. He can’t bring himself to look away, a part of him hoping he’d see the tiny form in the center.
Steve catches the sad expression on his son’s face and he sighs. He rests both hands over Peter’s shoulders and their eyes meet.
Steve hasn’t stopped looking at his son since he was placed in his arms for the first time. It still hasn’t sunk in that he had just given birth. The proof was right in front of him, but yet he still struggled to fully comprehend it.
“-and I felt bad for almost killing him. God knows I don’t need a lawsuit. I invited him back to SI-”
“So good,” Tony praises as he places kisses along Steve’s jaw. “You did so good, Steve. You’re so perfect.”
“Good.” Steve kisses him again then he crosses the room to serve his own breakfast. That tune he was humming starts up again.
“Hey.” Sam sets down the knife in his hand and crosses the room to get to his husband, taking him into his arms. “That’s not going to happen.”
Steve smiles at the thought of another baby. He had been unsure about bringing another child into the world, but now he didn’t feel as scared. His world wasn’t dangerous anymore. He didn’t have to worry about Hydra. He was safe now.
“He isn’t. I mean, I don’t think he is anymore. There hasn’t been any sign of him. Nothing. I’m pretty sure he’s given up.”
The atmosphere in the room shifts, and a heavy, uncomfortable feeling looms over them. Peter finds himself no longer hungry and he sets the plate down on the counter. Tony hasn’t bothered to serve himself anything; his appetite was gone too.
Peter nods and sits up. They don’t say anything at first; Peter is too scared to open his mouth and Tony is unsure of how to break the awkwardness between them. They never used to be this way. Peter never used to fear having a conversation with him. Tony has himself to blame. He shouldn’t have been so hard on his son. Not when Peter needed him the most.
When Saturday morning rolls around, Morgan doesn’t bother getting out of bed right away. She can already hear Harley fussing about something and dealing with another one of his tantrums wasn’t something she was in the mood with. She listens for her dad, hoping he hadn’t left for his meeting yet. Maybe she could beg him to spend time with her first and deal with Peter’s training later.
Getting to the clinic was easy enough. Taking the bus wasn’t anything new; there were times when he’d prefer public transportation over Happy driving him around. This time Peter couldn’t risk asking Happy to drive him. His secret would be out, and that was the last thing he wanted.
Steve sighs. “I know. But it’s only because I have to keep you safe. Who else is going to fight the bad guys?”
Tony’s chest rumbles with an alpha purr. He brings Steve in for another kiss, then places kisses on each corner of his mouth and then along his jaw and down to his neck. Steve shudders when his bond mark is teased and his fingers find purchase in Tony’s hair.
Peter decided at that moment that nap time was over and it was lunchtime. He fusses and whimpers in the car seat, tiny hands flailing in discomfort. Steve carefully takes his hungry son out of the car seat and adjusts him in his arms. Pepper steps in to assist and get the younger pup in a comfortable position for Steve to nurse.
“Come in.” He grants the person access, not surprised to find his papa the one behind the door. “Don’t,” Peter warns when he catches the smirk on his papa’s face.
They would need a bigger home. Somewhere private and secluded, safe from any harm. Sure Hydra and Pierce were gone but there were other forms of danger in the world. Tony wanted his family safe.
When it’s time for Tony and Morgan to go, Steve makes sure to hold their daughter close and make sure she knows how much he loves her.
Steve sighs and hunches forward, burying his hands in his face. His time spent under Tony’s care was short and already he was screwing up. He’s honestly surprised he hadn’t been thrown out yet.
Bruce finishes the exam and leaves the mansion, promising to see them both in another month. Steve is already looking forward to the next visit. They were the highlight of his month.
The alarm is piercing and the corridors are lit with an eerie red light. But Steve ignores it and pushes forward, determined now more than ever to regain his freedom. For years he had been abused, tormented, conditioned to obey every order Pierce gave. But Steve was done following his orders. Enough was enough.
“I’m not saying you shouldn’t. But if you’re going down that route then…” Tony trails off and he pushes the cart further down the aisle until he’s found what he’s looking for. “You’re gonna need this,” he says, picking up a box and showing it to Steve.
The outburst is surprising and leaves Tony confused. They’ve had conversations in the past about Steve pumping. It had just been an idea, and at the time Steve had seemed to consider it. Now, though, Tony was learning that he had been wrong.
“Sit down,” Sam says again, his voice calmer. This time Bucky does and he takes his original seat. Alpine jumps back into his lap to resume their cuddles. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap.”
“I know, baby. Almost done,” Steve soothes. He focuses on the tiny buttons, brows furrowed in concentration as he works them closed. They snap shut and he pulls away, frowning when he realizes he missed a couple and Peter’s leg is visible.
“We’re broken. Tony, look at us. He’s here with you one week and then with me the next. That’s not what I envisioned.”
“Actually,” Bucky chimes in and everyone’s attention falls on him and the fussy baby in his arms. “This one is a handful.”
Steve rolls his eyes again and moves onto the next bathroom, picking up a bit of laundry Peter had left behind from his morning shower.
He stays a little longer, talking to his papa about the rest of the family and how they’re all coping. He finds comfort at the grave, and he swears he can feel his father with him. It doesn’t compare to having the real thing, but Peter would take what he could get.
“Good,” Rumlow appears pleased and he shoves Steve forward. The omega quickly catches himself before he can hit the floor. “Take this one and the kid. I’m not done yet.”
Pepper lays a hand over his shoulder and rubs the spot soothingly. “It’s going to be okay. No one said this was going to be easy.”
“I don’t know,” Steve sighs and accepts the mug. He doesn’t drink from it. “Maybe? I know you wanted to get more stuff.”
“Not your fault.” Steve sniffs and wipes again at the tears that continue to roll down his cheeks. Tony frowns and scoots closer until their knees brush together. Steve doesn’t flinch this time.
Tony frowns. He’s starting to second guess himself. Was it really an excellent idea? Pepper knew about Peter, but introducing her to him would be...interesting. Pepper would probably love him instantly. Happy would be confused and probably ask a million questions. Then there was Rhodey…
He flinches when strong arms wrap around him. The touch is familiar and comforting that Tony can’t help but lean into it. Steve rests his chin on Tony’s shoulder and holds him tighter.
“It’s okay. I know this isn’t what we expected, but we’ll figure it out,” Tony says, and he directs his attention on his sleeping son, a small smile appearing over his face. “He’s perfect.”
“I’m just gonna go…” Peter adjusts his backpack and steps around her to leave, only to stop when she calls out to him. He turns around to face her. The frown is gone, and in its place is a sad expression. He knows where this is going.
“I’ll catch you up with new games. Drinking ones are my favorite but obviously we can’t do those...yet.”
Tony smiles and rises to his feet, then rounds the desk to get to her and take her hands in his own. “It’s yours, Pep. You deserve it.”
But Peter knew how broken up his papa was. His father was good at wearing a mask and pretending that he was fine, but as Peter got older, he started to see the mask crack and break apart. Whenever he asked, his papa always assured him that he was fine, but deep down Peter knew his father was hurting.
It shouldn’t be starting. If anything he was sure his ruts were over and a thing of the past. He blamed his age and the amount of stress his body was constantly under. He can’t even remember the last time he had one.
“Honey!” Tony calls out, only to be greeted with silence. He sighs and moves through the apartment, following the cries of his daughter.
Steve takes this time to explore the rest of the penthouse. He didn’t get much of a tour on the day he first arrived. At the time, all he wanted to do was clean up and get some sleep. But now that he’s refreshed and opening up, he can’t help but want to look around his new home.
He can no longer take being away from his family and he makes his way inside. The first thing he notices is the silence. Steve can’t help but frown from it. Usually someone was still up and making some kind of sound. But there’s nothing. Almost as if no one was home.
But when Steve wakes up that morning, he should’ve known his mate would twist the plans. The right side of the bed is empty and before Steve can ask Jarvis where the alpha was, Tony is coming into the room with a tray of breakfast foods.
Being away from Steve doesn’t get easier. The days pass slowly, and though Tony has his daughter to keep him sane, it’s not enough. A piece was missing, and Tony wasn’t sure when that piece would be coming home.
“Come here.” Steve holds out both arms and Peter giggles as he puts down his blocks and crawls over. Steve smiles brightly and lifts Peter into his arms, holding him up until Peter is in the air and giggling again. “You’re so big!” Steve coos and brings Peter down to kiss his nose.
“Not so strong now, are you big guy?” The alpha mocks. He pulls his arm back and slams it forward, connecting his fist with Steve’s jaw. The pain that radiates through his face is nothing; he’s been through worse.
Tony positions himself between Steve’s legs, laying a towel near him for the baby to eventually land on. The amount of blood he sees makes his own run cold. He’s seen Steve bloodied and bruised before, but this was different. This was more terrifying.
Steve nods and does as he’s told, knowing better than to disobey orders. Tony leaves soon after, shutting the door on his way out. Steve heaves out a sigh and glances around the room, deciding it was good enough for him and his pup. They’ve been in worse places.
Tony doesn’t travel far. He purposely avoids the upper levels, not wanting to end up in Steve’s private quarters. The last time he had stepped foot in Steve’s apartment, it had not only been the last time he saw Steve alive, but the worst fuck up of his entire existence.
Sam smiles and takes Bucky’s hand, intertwining their fingers. They only take two steps before Bucky is gagging and rushing for the sink. The room fills with the sounds of his retching.
Steve quickly shakes his head at the idea. Even if he tried to talk about it, he wouldn’t make much sense. It wasn’t something he understood himself.
Steve sighs and shifts in his seat. “I already tried,” he says, deciding it was better to be honest. “He didn’t really give me a chance to explain but...I don’t think it would have mattered anyway.”
“Yes!” Sam cheers and brings Bucky back into his arms, smothering him with kisses. “We’re having Little Sammy!”
The objective of the mission was simple: rescue the hostages and take back the Stark weapons that were stolen. It seemed simple enough, and though it had been easy to sneak aboard the ship, that was where the simplicity of it all ended. At least, for Steve it did.
After Tony’s cleaned up the mess the best he could, he takes Harley into his arms and lets the pup rest over his chest. Harley purrs the moment he picks up on the steady beatings of Tony’s heart, the sound lulling him to sleep almost immediately.
The kiss is unexpected, but Steve welcomes it. He welcomes Tony’s touch, not realizing how much he needed it until now.
“Is he moving?” Pepper asks, coming over to feel for herself. Tony takes her hand and leads it to the spot where the baby was currently kicking and rolling. “Oh my gosh. He’s getting so big!”
Their sex life was one Steve considered good. They rarely had a dull moment and if they did they worked hard to fix it and make it better. Usually whenever one of them was in the mood, the other didn’t hesitate to get on their level.
Peter sighs and glances down at his lap, fidgeting with his fingers. Tony peers over at him again, more guilt washing over him at the sight he finds.
“Hey, it’s...I guess I can’t say okay because honestly I don’t know. But I can assure you this one is in good hands. You’ll get a chance to raise this one, be a mother. I won’t let anyone hurt you or this baby.”
But Tony wasn’t that kind of alpha. He wouldn’t hurt him. He promised he wouldn’t. Steve just had to have faith in that.
“Stay down, Omega,” Pierce orders. He turns toward the other alpha and gives him an order. Steve growls again when the alpha gets too close. “Give him the pup!”
“I know.” Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s, eyes falling shut and enjoying the closeness. “We can’t.”
“I’m scared,” Steve whispers. Tony runs a hand through Steve’s hair and leans down to kiss his forehead.
“You’re the best,” Tony says when Pepper helps him discard the dirty tie and adjust the new one around his neck.
Tony hates how broken Steve is. Knowing that they have a baby was a shock, but what he was feeling didn’t compare to what Steve was going through. He wasn’t the one who had to carry and birth the baby. Steve had to do it all and without knowing.
“Papa, you look just like me!” Peter exclaims and he rushes over to give Steve a hug. Steve smiles down at his son and wraps his arms around him.
Steve straightens up and wipes at his nose. Natasha is still watching him warily. He doesn’t have the heart to tell her that he’s leaving. He doesn’t want to hurt anyone anymore.
He makes his way to the cemetery, swinging from building to building, completely undetected from the city dwellers just feet below. The feeling he gets when he’s high up in the sky is exhilarating. He doesn’t feel any stress or any pain from his hectic life. Being up means he’s free and at ease, even if it’s only for a little while. If he could have it his way, Peter would never come down.
“Tony, it’s not like that. And even if it was, it's something I need right now. Nothing else is working.”
“Nothing! At least, I don’t think I did. Okay, sit down. You’re making me uncomfortable just standing there and silently judging me,” Tony says and he gestures for her to sit down in the chair in front of the desk.
“Petey,” Steve takes over and their son turns toward him. “Remember how we talked about the baby growing in my tummy?”
Steve releases a small sob and Tony pulls him close, wrapping him in his arms and allowing him to cry into his chest. He cradles Steve’s head, fingers gently running through his hair.
Steve’s jolted awake by a loud bang. He sits up quickly and does a scan of the room, finding that he’s alone. His brows furrow in confusion. He remembered Tony being with him.
Peter frowns and plays with the cloth cape on one of his action figures. He makes it fly through the air, adding in his own flying sound effects. His attention is back on his papa again when Steve moves through the room in search of his helmet.
babies. Jesus. What are we gonna do now? We didn’t buy double of anything. Where’s this kid supposed to sleep?” Tony asks.
“Thanks, Happy.” Peter shoots the bodyguard a quick smile, then he takes Flash’s hand and leads him up the stairs.
Peter is just as shocked by his uncle’s words. He never believed that his uncle would ever hurt him in any way, but he never thought he would hear his uncle agree with him on something like this. For years all Peter heard out of his mouth was his distaste for his dad. Maybe now he was coming around.
“Okay,” Tony says, his eyes bright with tears. “If you want to think things over...take as much time as you need. I’ll be here. I promised I would.”
Bucky smiles and nods his head in agreement. “I think so. We kept him alive so that has to count for something.”
Tony steps in to intervene, only to pause when Peter stops crying. Both parents watch in amazement as Dodger calms the fussy newborn.
Steve scoffs and shakes his head. “So we’re back to this? I knew it. I knew you had a problem with it. You’re the one who offered every single time! How the hell was I supposed to know that you didn’t want to get up? I’m capable of getting her.”
If there was one word Peter would use to describe dinner with both Flash and his parents, it would be mortifying. And maybe that’s not even a good enough word to describe it. It was awkward, cringy, terrifying. Peter could go on and on, but he chooses to suck it up and hope that the dinner doesn’t end with Flash being beaten to a pulp and thrown off the roof.
“Just tired. And...Tony and I are in a fight. Don’t worry about it,” Steve quickly says when Bucky opens his mouth to speak.
With both of them taking a break from saving the world, they find themselves with more free time. Of course any time they do get ends up being spent preparing for their son. Steve didn’t mind. He wanted to be ready for when their baby arrived.
“He’s looking good,” Bruce pipes up. His presence had nearly been forgotten since he announced the gender to the two parents. “Steve, keep doing what you’re doing. Your son is in good hands.”
“Okay, kiddo,” Tony quickly steps in to silence his son’s rambling. “I think it’s time to let him sleep, hmm? He had a busy day.”
A simple pumpkin and scarecrow would suffice in his opinion; those were the symbols of Fall. What he didn’t understand was why Tony had to decorate their home from top to bottom in orange and black colors and skeletons and spiders. He wasn’t surprised anymore to find their home looking like Halloween had thrown up in every room. Being married for nearly 7 years made him practically immune.
The words are like a painful punch to the gut. Tony tries again to reach out for his son, but Peter turns and runs, disappearing from the lab.
“I don’t think Dodger will mind. Will you?” Steve smiles and frees one arm from around Peter to pat the dog’s head.
Steve rolls his eyes and mutters something that suspiciously sounds like ‘jerk.’ It’s not the worst thing Tony’s been called by his significant other, but the name calling still hurts.
Steve chuckles and buries his face in the crook of his mate’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent. “You scared me,” he mumbles against Tony’s neck.
There’s another moment of silence between them. Tony can’t for the life of him think of something to say to make the poor kid feel better. He knew this kind of pain and comforting words didn’t make it better. Nothing could fully erase it.
He’s barely making it the door when the knocking starts. The frantic knocks are worrisome, but it’s the loud cries that have Tony opening the door as fast as he can.
He figures Steve is following his nightly routine, and that the light would shut off when he was ready. Tony allows his eyes to shut, only for them to open a few seconds later when he picks up on a sound coming from down the hall.
Tony’s lack of response is everything she needs to know, and she invites him in. Having been in Natasha’s private quarters a few times over the years, he’s comfortable enough to move through the space with ease. His destination is the couch and he places Morgan down on the floor, hunching over to unbuckle her and take her into his arms. He sits back with her in his arms, a sigh of relief escaping him.
Tony inhales sharply and clicks away at the screen of his tablet. He likes the idea of keeping the nursery simple, though there was a chance of Steve wanting something else. Their tastes in decor were very different after all.
Tears gather in Steve’s eyes and he has to turn away to hide them. Tony notices and takes Steve’s hands in his own.
“It’s okay to be curious,” Bucky says softly and gently smoothes out the wrinkles he’s created in the tiny shirt. “And yeah...the baby…I lost it.”
“It’s okay. And he’s...alright.” Peter frowns. He hates that's the only word he can use to describe his dad.
Steve smiles softly. “Yeah, I guess. I’m just...nervous. He’s so tiny and what if something happens?”
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve pants when Tony’s lips find their way to his neck. Steve moans and runs his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“When you were getting ready. And don’t worry I packed everything he’s going to need. It’s only for a couple of hours.”
Tony scoffs. “You don’t think he’d try? Just because my mark is on Steve’s neck doesn’t mean he’s free. That asshole would challenge me if given the chance.”
“Then why does it feel like it is? I was there on that stupid mission and I ran away like a coward. I’m not a hero. I’m not an Avenger. Papa was wrong about me.”
“No.” Tony sighs. There was no point in trying to lie anymore. He did still have some lingering feelings for Steve. “I guess you’re pretty hard to forget. It also doesn’t help that we have a baby now. Kinda makes things harder.”
Tony slants back in his seat, scrubbing a hand over his face, wishing the tears would stop coming. A part of him is beginning to regret listening to the message. It was like pouring salt on a wound. A wound that will never close.
Steve is fast asleep when Tony pushes open the door to their room, making him feel worse about having to disturb him. Morgan is still crying, the sounds she produces stirring Steve from his peaceful sleep.
Steve takes a deep breath and blows it out, then he bears down again. His back arches and his body lifts off the seat. He groans, voicing the start of another contraction, and he pushes hard, screaming when he stretches wider. Then finally, the head slides out completely.
There’s a moment of hesitation before Jarvis is following through and pulling up everything he can on Tony’s request.
Peter shakes his head. He’d have to go to the nurse’s office and then risk his parents being called. His papa would probably have the flexibility to pick him up and he was the last person Peter wanted to see. His papa would smother him when all Peter wanted was some space.
Steve is fast asleep by the time Tony returns to him. He sits back down beside the omega and allows his own eyes to fall shut. His hand brushes against Steve’s, but he doesn’t pull away. The touch was nice.
I finally got around to updating! This chapter mostly focuses on Peter and of course I said I’d explain what happened with Sam and Bucky. The next one will have Tony and Peter interacting better than they did.
“You okay?” Tony mumbles besides him. His eyes are open and Steve wonders how long he’s been watching him.
The beginning of the day started off with a big breakfast prepared by his uncle Sam. Peter had devoured the waffles the second the plate stacked with them was placed in front of him. He might have enjoyed them a little too much because his obnoxious eating didn’t sit well with his uncle Bucky. The morning sickness was kicking his butt hard.
He doesn’t turn for the glass of scotch, even when it promises a drunken haze. But that was what put him in this situation in the first place. All he did was get drunk and do stupid things. That would at least explain his memory loss.
He keeps close to his mate, leaning in enough to nose around the crook of Tony’s neck and inhaling his comforting scent. It helps. Just like it always has.
Steve nods, understanding what Tony was getting at. “Yeah,” he says and he glances down at Peter. “He’s almost done.”
Steve sighs. “I hate letting him down. You know once this baby gets here it’ll be harder for us to spend time together.”
Steve attempts to untangle himself from his alpha’s arm to attend to their son, but Tony beats him to it.
“Guess Jarvis wanted you to be reminded of home,” Tony chuckles as he places two large slices on a plate for Steve and then for himself. They stay seated on the sofa; it’s more comfortable this way.
The pup only frowns and cocks his head. “Ma-” is all he can say. It brings a smile to Steve’s face anyway.
“Okay.” Tony nods. He doesn’t want to push. Just because Steve was back home didn’t mean that he was back to normal. Steve was still delicate.
Steve smiles at those words. “I’m lucky to have him. And you and everyone else. I couldn’t do this otherwise.”
Tony places another kiss on the bump before pulling back to work Steve’s sweatpants down his legs. Steve lifts his hips to help, watching with darkened eyes as Tony removes the rest of his clothing. Steve’s cock springs free, resting against the underside of his belly. The head is red and leaking, smearing the precome.
Dodger is excited when Steve enters the apartment first. He rushes over to properly greet him with slobbery kisses. Steve laughs when Dodger jumps up to try and lick along his face.
Steve forces himself not to think about the man who hurt him. He was gone. Hopefully for good this time.
Steve nods and turns so that he’s now facing Tony. He catches himself leaning closer and Tony follows. They’re so close to each other now. But the kiss doesn’t happen.
Steve scoffs. “I guess we’ll see. You know you’re missing a lot, right? What about the nursing stuff?”
Tony rereads over the document again, needing to make sure that his mind wasn’t playing an awful trick on him. The results are the same. He was having a baby.
Natalie returns a few minutes later with coffees. Tony drinks most of his before he deems himself ready to sign. It’s painless and only takes a couple of minutes, but then it’s done and he is no longer CEO of Stark Industries.
Tony rises to his feet and bends down to give his son a kiss on the head, then he leaves the room in search of his missing husband. That uneasy feeling in the pit of his gut returns, and despite Tony’s best efforts to push aside the feeling, it can’t be ignored.
“He’s not there,” Natasha corrects as she sits back against the sofa and crosses her left leg over her right. “He was in the training room last I saw him.”
“You feel so good.” Tony presses more of himself inside, groaning at the tight heat that surrounds him. Though he’s nervous about having a baby, he can’t deny that making one was the best part. He almost hopes this one doesn’t take so he can have an excuse to fuck Steve again. But then he’s reminded he’d have to be the one to carry the baby if this doesn’t succeed. It would be his turn to get fucked.
Their friends are gathered outside of the room in the small waiting area. They all rise to their feet when Steve appears.
The beta is doing his best to console the upset pup while Harley and Sarah play a game of who can scream the loudest. Harley is deemed the winner.
“Okay.” Peter nods. “Are you afraid of people seeing us? I swear I’m not some weird stalker or anything.”
Peter winces and rubs at the aching spot, whimpering when the muscles contract. He leans back against the wall and breathes through it, his eyes falling shut.
“I think he’s good,” Tony says and he glances back in Steve’s direction, finding the omega on the verge of passing out. “Go to sleep, Steve.”
Tony emits another growl, this time for the approaching beta and jumps up to his feet. The syringe is gripped tightly in the beta’s hand as he comes closer. Steve finds the courage to rise and he puts himself between the threat and his mate, baring his teeth in warning.
“You’re so perfect,” Tony whispers and gently runs his finger along Steve’s swollen lips. He parts them even further, taking Tony’s finger into his mouth and sucking softly. Tony’s breath hitches in his throat and his cock twitches with arousal. He had wanted to take it soft and slow, but now he had the sudden urge to fuck Steve into the bed. “Fuck, honey,” Tony moans.
“Now why would I do that?” Steve grins and offers the ice cream to her. Natasha happily takes another spoonful before the rest is consumed.
It’s disappointing. It’s sad. It’s the worst thing that could have ever happened. Peter can’t find a costume.
With a shaky hand he takes the bottle and screws off the lid. He’s terrified. He wants to throw them down the drain. He wants to get better and not rely on them anymore. But everything he did to get better wasn’t working. He was never going to be himself again. The old version of him was lost forever.
“Not good,” Tony replies honestly. His eyes drift to the little boy passed out on the couch. “How’d he do? Good, I hope.”
Flash’s grip loosens now that he has Peter’s attention and he drops his hand to his side. Peter eyes him suspiciously, waiting for him to say something mean or hit him. Maybe even both.
Morgan’s cries are louder, but it’s not just the sound she’s making that worries Tony. His ears finally pick up on Steve-he sounds upset. Tony pushes the door to the nursery open, walking straight into a scene he thought he’d never have to witness again.
Natasha smiles softly and rubs her hand along his shoulder. “Yeah. Are you okay now?” She asks and Steve nods his head. “I’ve never and I mean
“Honey,” Tony says cautiously, coming closer to try and help. Steve refuses to look up at him, instead keeping his head cast down and eyes locked on Morgan. “Steve-”
“Yeah. I don’t see why not. You’re a good guy. I mean at first I thought you were an alpha. It’s not a bad thing I swear!”
The frown on Tony’s face only deepens. He sets the dish in his hand aside, no longer worried about the mess he created. Steve was more important.
“You won’t.” Natasha rises to her feet and comes over. Tony would allow her to hug him if he didn’t have his daughter in his arms, but the soothing circles she rubs over his shoulder was enough. “Let me,” Natasha holds out her arms and Tony places Morgan into her arms. “You need to sit down, Tony.”
Peter doesn’t notice him right away, but once he does, his face is lighting up and he runs over. Tony has to back up so that they don’t collide with each other.
So when he comes home one afternoon after a failed attempt at Halloween costume shopping with their 5-year-old son, Peter, he can’t help but shake his head at what he finds. Their apartment is once again ready for the holiday. Ghosts, spiders, skeletons; anything and everything creepy was hanging from the ceiling or decorating the walls. The stairs leading up the upper floor were covered in webs and fake spiders.
“Then don’t hold back. I trust you. I know what kind of alpha you are, Tony. You’re one of the good ones.”
“Uh.” Steve takes a moment to think before answering. “To be honest I haven’t had the chance. I’ve been a little occupied.”
He drums his fingers on the steering wheel as he waits, an exasperated sigh leaving his lips when the traffic barely moves. He sends a quick message to Steve, hoping FRIDAY would relay it if Steve was too busy to answer.
“Is currently stepping in for your conference call. Sir, I’d like to add that she is not pleased with your absence.”
Tony wraps a hand around Steve’s cock, stroking him in time with his thrusts, urging him to come. It’s too much and with one more hard thrust, Steve is screaming Tony’s name and coming, spurting ropes of cum over Tony’s hand.
It had been a shock to learn that one of his teammates had a wife and children. Fury had kept Clint’s family a secret, just like he had been doing with Steve’s. It made Steve feel better about bringing a child into his world. He knew his son was in good hands and out of harm’s way.
Tony smiles at those words. “I missed you too. We all did. Especially this one,” Tony gestures to the pup dozing off in his arms.
“Fuck,” Tony moans when Steve wraps his mouth around his cock. He grips Steve’s head, and threads his fingers through the blond locks. Steve hums and takes more of Tony into his mouth, moaning and bobbing his head. “Shit, Steve, that feels good. Yeah, baby like that.”
“Not really. I’m sorry. I just-when you talk about him it just seems like it’s not really...nice. Did you hate him that much?”
He doesn’t let Steve take full control. Tony liked to be the one to take the lead and give his partners an unforgettable experience. Maybe that was just his ego talking but he didn’t have a reputation for nothing.
Steve snaps his hips forward, unable to hold back the groan that escapes him. He curls around Tony, leaning down and resting his forehead against Tony’s shoulder. “You feel good,” Steve murmurs and presses kisses along the back of Tony’s neck. “So good.”
He could count on one hand how many times he’s seen Steve cry. Steve wasn’t the type to let his emotions show. It was easier for him to express his anger than it was when he was sad. Crying was something he did when he was alone and able to let his walls down.
After Morgan has had her fill and she’s burped, it’s not surprising to find her yawning and eyes fluttering shut. Tony is careful when he takes her back to her crib, hoping she remains asleep.
He finds out the reason behind the laughter when he enters the living room. There’s a white cat in his uncle Bucky’s lap, meowing and purring as it crawls around him, rubbing its head against his uncle’s face.
And I couldn't resist Nat and Steve interactions along with Stucky ones. I love both of those friendships.
Just like Sam had said, Peter catches up to his cousin and lifts him into the air, the toddler squealing in surprise. Peter laughs and brings Steve down so that he can kiss his cheek.
“Always. He’s taking after Tony. He loves building things and now cars apparently,” Steve replies and slips the car back into his pocket.
He’s agitated when he’s woken up to be burped and cleaned, but then he’s relaxing again and falling back to sleep.
Somewhere beside him Natasha groans and rolls over. She had insisted they sleep together, her reasoning was she would be faster at attending to Peter. Steve knew it was because Sam and Bucky took the couch. Whatever the reason, Steve was happy to have her close by.
An idea pops into his head. He immediately argues with himself over it, trying to convince himself that it was a stupid idea. Maybe even worse than being a stowaway.
He refuses to eat and drink. All he does is lock himself in the bedroom and sob until he’s too exhausted to do anything else. Tony hates it. He hates it more because he knows he’s responsible for Steve’s pain.
Some members of the team struggled to believe that Tony was here to stay, while others were willing to welcome him back if it meant Peter would be happy. Peter’s happiness would always be a priority of theirs. It always has been.
He blames himself for ending up here. Disobeying was what got him locked away. It was punishment for his actions. No omega was to disobey their alpha.
Pierce rises to his feet and adjusts his suit, then he makes his way over to the seething alpha chained to the wall. Tony has to fight every fiber of his being not to look up at the man that just destroyed his whole world. He’s gripped roughly by the hair and forced to look into those cold, blue eyes.
“I need to lie down,” Steve responds. His eyes travel down to the floor, widening at the sight of the blood. “Tony! Oh my God. There’s so much. Tony, there’s so much.”
Steve lets out a small sigh and leans against the counter, folding his arms over his chest. “It’s going to be...a lot. I know this isn’t something you signed up for and we broke up-”
“I don’t understand.” Pepper sniffs and Bruce quickly hands her another tissue to blow into. “He was fine! We talked and he was so excited to come back and his son-”
For the past few weeks he had been working hard at building himself up and picking up the pieces that had been broken. The pieces weren’t perfect; some were jagged and unable to reconnect like they used to, but Steve was trying to put them back together. The finished result wouldn’t resemble its past self, but it would be whole again and special in its own way.
It takes another minute for Peter to decide, then he’s taking a deep breath and opening the door he vowed would stay shut forever.
Sometimes he regrets accepting the serum and the experiment he went through. He never would have ended up in Hydra’s hands if he had just accepted who he was. But what good was it to dwell on the past and the what ifs? The past was the past. And this was now.
“Whoa!” Sam jumps up to get between Peter and Bucky. He’s hoping violence wouldn’t break out, but he wasn’t about to take any chances. “Pete, that’s enough.” Sam points a warning finger at his nephew.
Morgan calms down the moment Tony has her out of her wet diaper and in a fresh one. He coos and smiles as he dresses her, chuckling softly when she smiles back at him. It’s a small smile, and he’s unsure if it’s a real one or just reflexes, but it brings joy to him anyway.
Steve sighs heavily and turns around. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to the Captain’s protruding middle.
“How are you two not married yet?” Sam asks one day during a morning run. Steve does his best to ignore the question, not wanting to talk about his love life during one of his breaks. He loved his son, but sometimes he needed a break.
“I’ve been blaming myself. And I know everyone else has too. I know my own son has been blaming me.”
The alpha that Steve is forced to call his own is nothing like the stories he grew up hearing. His mother always told him that one day he’d find his mate. Steve had been wary. No alpha would ever want him. He had been a small, sickly omega. He wasn’t good enough for any alpha.
Steve chuckles and happily takes their youngest pup into his arms to feed him. Tony helps adjust Peter and soon he’s latching on and nursing.
He wraps his arms around his daughter a little tighter, ready to put up a fight if he needs to. The alphas don’t approach. They step aside, allowing two other people to enter. The beta in the white lab coat enters first-Steve recognizes him from a previous delivery- followed by another familiar face. This face strikes fear in him.
“Sorry. I didn’t mean-I make jokes when I’m...uncomfortable. They’re stupid and it annoys everyone but it’s what I do. Sorry, kid.”
I swear I’m taking it easy and I’m starting to feel better. I managed to get enough chapters written for this story so I’m ahead, but I’ll try and work on my other stuff too. I’m just having so much fun with this one 😛
“You don’t really have one. I got it,” Tony tells him, then he’s getting out of bed to attend to their son.
He was the one who screwed up. He was the one who pushed Steve and everyone close to him away. It was his fault. His mistakes.
It was still an issue he had with himself. He used to only see himself as the skinny guy or the invincible Captain America. But that wasn’t who he really was. He was just Steve.
“We both will,” Steve says and he turns back to his son, gently picking him up off the changing table. Peter doesn’t fuss or cry, completely content being in his father’s arms. Steve lays him over his shoulder, keeping one hand on Peter’s head and the other on his bottom for support.
“Can I see?” Pepper asks and Tony flips the screen to show off his sleeping son. Pepper coos in response. “He’s getting so big! Aww he’s so precious. You’re spoiling him, huh?”
Steve curses his body for reacting to the alpha’s touch. He tries to fight it, but his body continues to betray him and produce slick. He bites down hard on his bottom lip to stifle a pleasured moan. He wouldn’t allow it to feel good. Only Tony made him feel good. Only Tony was his alpha.
The dog wags his tail, panting happily with its slobbery tongue hanging outside of its mouth. Tony grimaces at the mess the dog is making. “Cap, he’s...how do I put this lightly...gross. Yeah, smelly and gross. You gotta take him back.”
It’s surreal being on the same mission as the Avengers. The closest Peter’s ever gotten was when he’d eavesdrop from the ceiling during a brief. His father would be furious if he could see his son now, walking into a secret base and ready to fight the bad guys.
It’s not until Tony is informing him that Happy was outside does Steve have to let his son go. They both kiss Peter goodbye, tell him they love him. Then together they leave.
But the anger he’s feeling right now isn’t just from the mission going wrong, but because Steve was the most stubborn, most infuriating man in the entire universe. He not only refused JARVIS’s scan, but medical help altogether. Steve was two things: stubborn and stupid.
“I don’t know how you can say that. This is my first time holding him. I don’t have any of this figured out yet,” Tony admits.
For the most part they were happy. They were getting along and trying to grow and learn together. But everyday wasn’t sunshine and rainbows.
“No of course not. Sorry. I swear I’m not trying to ruin this for you. I want you to have control over this place.”
But Tony wasn’t a big, mean alpha. He was loving and kind. He would never hurt anyone. Especially his family.
Steve shakes his head vigorously and he whimpers. He scoots away again until his back hits the wall. He brings his knees up to his chest and wraps his arms around them.
“I’ve never been so sure. It was always going to be you, Tony. After everything we’ve been through…”
Steve doesn’t appear bothered in the slightest about their son’s early arrival. Tony figures it’s because Steve has done this before and knows what to expect, or maybe it’s just his natural instincts. Omega’s were hardwired differently; they were the ones having the babies for a reason. Tony was already proving with his internal panicking why he wouldn’t be fit to be a mother.
“It just feels different. He’s not here when he’s supposed to be and then my dad…” Peter trails off with a sigh.
“Uneventful,” Tony replies and he slips the photos back into the envelope. “You still up for breakfast?”
“Not really. I think I’ve already done that. Forget it. I’m sorry for wasting your time.” Tony rises to his feet and Alexander does the same. Tony leans in to shake his hand, only to retract it when the other alpha gets too close and sniffs the air. His eyes go black for a moment before they’re turning back to his natural color.
Steve winces. It was his fault that Tony was away from his job and friends. He was the reason why Tony was robbed from his old life. A horrible thought enters his mind, and he wonders if Tony would be better off without him.
It was going to take a lot more than one training session to get Peter ready to fight along the Avengers. He was just a kid, inexperienced and lacking any of the proper skills to be a part of the team. But Steve knew with the right training that his son would be ready to take his place beside the best.
The pain was excruciating, but it was evident that it was impacting others a little more. Bucky is silent, just like he has been ever since the night he lost his best friend. At the funeral he had finally let out his emotions, but it was obvious he was still holding back.
“I’ll get off them,” Steve whispers into the dark after they’ve finished and they’re wrapped in each other’s arms. “I know you want another baby.”
You guys! This is the last chapter 😭 Oh man has it been a roller coaster. I had been anxious when I first started writing this and now it has become one of my favorites. I’m really going to miss it 😔
Steve’s stomach tightens when his lips meet the alpha’s thin ones. The sensation of feeling his lips against his own isn’t new, he’s felt them before.
Peter doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say. The words “I’m sorry” didn’t seem right. He had hated when that’s all anyone would tell him, and he figures his uncle might be the same way. Those words didn’t ease the pain.
Steve gasps and he glances up at Tony, finding the alpha smiling and holding a small box in his hand.
They fall silent for a moment. Steve keeps his gaze locked on Peter, and gently traces a finger along his chubby cheek.
“Petey,” Steve sighs and puts his son back in bed and pulls the blanket over him. “It’s bedtime. We can play tomorrow okay?”
Steve keeps himself busy in the kitchen, using the cake he’s prepared for Tony as his distraction. He can hear the cheery voices of Tony and his friends in the other room, and the sound is enough to bring a smile to his face. He was glad Tony was enjoying himself. He deserved it.
He’s reminded of the one person he technically could refer to as family. Tony Stark wasn’t a part of the team anymore, but he was still Peter’s dad.
“He’s ready to go,” Tony announces and carefully lifts Peter off the changing table and cradles him in his arms. “Uh-oh. Papa’s going overboard, Petey,” Tony tells his son when he catches Steve stuffing the bag.
“Thank you,” Steve smiles and accepts the beverage. He takes a drink and his nose wrinkles. “It tastes weird.”
He gives up on the door, knowing his attempts at breaking free would fail. Maybe if the circumstances were different he’d be able to get out. The serum running through his veins gave him a superhuman strength. He wouldn’t dare break down this door now, not when he was trying to keep his pup safe.
Tony Stark would never be like the parent Peter had lost. Tony proved he could be a decent father when he tried, but he’d never be like Steve. Their relationship would never be like the one Peter had with his papa.
The rest of the pups are just as happy. James and Harley are getting their fill on muffins, juice, and other goodies they find. A part of Steve hates them ruining their appetite, but the other half tells him to let them enjoy this.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers and glances down at his lap. Tony touches him again, hooking a finger under Steve’s chin and gently lifting it so their eyes can meet again. “Tony, I’m-”
Tony frowns. “No, I can’t say that I’ve seen him. I’m really busy and don’t have time to get out myself. But I’ll keep an eye out. What does he look like?”
The warmth disappears, emitting a disappointed cry from Steve. Tony strokes Steve’s cock and ducks down to take the head in his mouth, sucking softly. Steve’s hips stutter and with a cry he comes down Tony’s throat. Tony hums as he swallows every single drop of Steve’s release.
Steve relaxes slightly and steps fully into the living room. He nears the couch, only to stop when he realizes he hasn’t received permission to sit down.
“You did good,” Tony praises and leans closer to connect their lips. He pulls back slightly and his attention is drawn to the cuffs still tightly secured around Steve’s wrists. He removes them and Steve’s arms fall to his side. “You okay?”
Finally, the finger slips out and Steve is able to catch his breath. The sound of a belt unbuckling reaches his ears and Steve’s eyes widened.
That was another thing he was used to. Charities and nonprofits were always trying to get him to donate. And a lot of the time he did. He was a billionaire, he had more money than what he knew what to do with. This new organization-he had already forgotten their name- was no different.
“I can’t train you or anything like that. It’s not up to me if you become an Avenger or not. I’m not exactly one anymore. But I can make you that suit.”
“It’s a lot, yeah. But I’m happy to do this, and to be honest, a little scared. I don’t know what I’m doing either, but we’ll learn as we go. We’re not going to get this down in one night.”
Tony reaches down between them, running the tip of his finger against the hole that he desperately needs to bury his cock in. The scent is stronger now, smacking Tony in the face with its intensity. Tony wants to drop down to his knees and lick up the slick that’s pouring out. He wants a taste of this beautiful omega.
He decides to ask those questions later, instead focusing his attention on getting the baby and Steve some care. The facility isn’t equipped for babies. It never occurred to Tony that the team would need such resources. Having children in their line of work was risky and not something that crossed his mind. It was impossible to juggle both.
Becoming a parent is one of the most extraordinary yet terrifying experiences Steve has ever had. Steve had no clue how to be a mother. He was never given the chance to try.
I hope you all enjoyed this update! The next one will have some of Tony’s pov and then him and Peter will meet up again. Thank you so much for reading! I love you all! ❤️
Steve frowns in confusion. Nick made sure the Captain’s memories hadn’t been erased. He wasn’t trying to revive an empty vessel, but the person that left too soon. He can only hope that it has been a success.
Now that he can get a good look at his son, he studies the barely developed features. He can make out Steve’s nose and lips on their son’s face.
“Not if it means losing you. He’ll hurt you, Tony. You think you know him but you don’t. I know you’re smart, but he’s obsessed with me, the baby, power. Tony, he won’t stop until he gets what is his. He’ll kill whoever gets in his way. And if that’s you…” Steve chokes back a sob. “Please. It’s not worth it.”
“So beautiful.” Tony’s smile brightens and he pulls Steve closer so that he can kiss him the way he’s been wanting to for weeks.
“Don’t worry about it. Having kids is supposed to be messy, right?” Tony opens his arms and Steve carefully puts Peter in them. Tony smiles at his son and adjusts the towel. “Hey, kiddo. You get to hang out with me now. Papa is tired of you.”
He slips himself free from the alpha’s arms, letting them fall limp on the bed. Steve crawls off the bed and quietly moves around the room, picking up his discarded clothes and slipping them on. His body is still covered and sticky with the alpha’s release.
Nick Fury wasn’t exactly the person Steve had imagined telling about the baby, at least not right away. But Nick was the director and had every right to know. Steve just didn’t imagine telling him anything until he was ready.
Steve spins around, revealing his red-rimmed eyes and tear streaked face. The bitterness in Steve’s scent is stronger now and the first thing Tony wants to do is rush over and comfort him, but the warning growl Steve emits has Tony stopping in his tracks.
“It’s okay. I’ll get them the best therapist money can buy. And you too. I know talking about this won’t be easy but you have to talk to someone. I’m not enough, but I’ll still listen. I’ll still comfort you.”
Peter gasps and quickly scurries out of the tent, taking Tony’s hand and dragging him toward the direction of their home. “Come on, Daddy! I’m hungry.”
Tony comes closer and the pups quickly get out of the way to make room. They stand off to the side, smiling and giggling excitingly. Peter gets too into it, his giggles rising in volume, and it’s not until Sarah shushes him does he quiet down.
“I love you, too.” Steve smiles. He shifts so that he’s on his back and Tony is leaning over him. Steve cups Tony’s face and brings him in for a kiss.
Building a nursery was a big one. The spare room in their apartment was currently being remodeled into Peter’s room. The walls have been painted a light gray and new carpet was put in. But that was the only progress they’ve made. A theme for the room hadn’t been decided on yet.
He hadn’t spent that much time with Ned since the funeral. It was easier to lock himself away and pretend that he didn’t lose his father. But pretending would only get him so far. He needed his best friend now more than ever.
“I-I’m fine…” Steve sniffs again and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his shirt. “I’m okay. I guess it’s just hitting me. I have a son...two sons.”
“It’s okay,” Natasha soothes. Her own eyes are full of tears. She hugs her nephew tighter and his fighting stops. He clings to her instead. “It’s okay, sweetie. It’s okay.”
Steve growls and lunges after him, but then someone is yanking him back and forcing him against the wall, his head hitting the hard surface with an audible thud.
He reaches down between his legs to investigate, bringing his hand up quickly when he brushes against a hard mass. His hand comes back sticky and covered in blood.
“You love me?” Steve asks, his tone laced with uncertainty. His brows draw together and that smile he once wore has been transformed into a frown.
Peter huffs and crosses his arms over his chest. “I don't want to talk. I just want my brother back!”
Tony throws an arm around Peter’s shoulders and together they make their way toward the entrance. Tony stops abruptly and frowns.
Steve lowers his shield when the round of bullets stops. With his weapon out of ammo, the man turns quickly to retrieve another. Steve moves forward to disarm him, only to be too late and he’s roughly pushed backwards from the intense blast that's shot in his direction.
The alpha moves closer to get a better look at the newborn pup, and his nose wrinkles in disgust when he gets a whiff of her. Steve growls again and brings his daughter closer. He knows what’s about to happen next.
He loved Morgan more than anything. She was the missing piece he was looking for. He’ll never regret having her.
Tony is careful when he takes Steve’s hand, not wanting to wake him from the only good sleep he’s going to have for a while. He soothingly smoothes his thumb over Steve’s knuckles, his fingers then gliding over the spot where he plans to put a gold band one day.
And they’re there for the most exciting appointment. The room is crowded with the Avengers in one room. The doctor appears nervous to be in a small space with the Hulk, but Bruce promised he was okay.
Pepper nods and sets her glass down. “I want to apologize for how we first met. I probably came off a little...unwelcoming. At the time I thought you were just another one of Tony’s booty calls. I’m sorry I judged you.”
All of the fear and anxiety seems to vanish the second his son is in his arms. There’s a hint of it that still lingers, but the love and devotion he feels for his son outweighs everything else. He’d do anything for his son.
“Better?” It’s a stupid question to ask, he knows this, but he’s got nothing else. He’s never seen Tony this sick before. Even after witnessing Tony come home drunk after another Stark event.
“You could’ve come back after Peter was born. Or after all the letters and phone calls. Steve never gave up on you, even if he should have.”
“Wait!” Steve calls out when Tony turns to leave. “Don’t go. Please. I’m sorry but I’m a little-please…”
, he tells himself but the frown on his face remains. How Steve fails to notice is beyond him. Perhaps his husband was just over the moon excited. They had been thinking about starting a family for a while now. Correction. Steve had been thinking about children. Tony made up his mind long ago that he didn’t want kids.
“Big. They miss you,” Steve replies as he gathers up his notebook. “I swear I’m going to invite you over. It’s just with the move and unpacking.”
Steve huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “Me too,” he says and glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. An amused look appears over Tony’s face and it’s then when Steve realizes what he’s said. “I mean not me wondering about the question...the guys...they’ve been harassing me…”
“Anything. I’m sorry I’m the worst boyfriend ever. You can punish me if you want.” Tony waggles his brows and this time Steve does get away from him.
Out of all the past encounters he’s had with Steve, that was the night he wishes he could go back to. Different scenarios play in his head, each one always having a happy ending. Tony would give anything to have that moment back again.
Steve is currently sprawled out on the couch Tony usually uses for a bed when he can’t muster the energy to drag his ass up the stairs. The blanket he’s stolen from upstairs is draped over his lap, having slipped off from the constant movement Steve made trying to get comfortable.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Whatever. Tomorrow you’re doing most of the talking. Maybe I’ll drag Pepper up here to help. She’ll probably want to meet him.”
Finding the time to sit down and talk with his mate wasn’t an easy task. Their youngest pup was constantly begging for their attention, throwing tantrums when he didn’t get his way. Harley could still be a handful, and it was obvious Peter was learning by his brother’s example.
But the other half of him wants his dad to tag along. It’s been years since the team has been together and deep down Peter yearns for them to reconnect and they become a real family.
Tony doesn’t reply and instead gives his mate a look over. The wounds on Steve’s face have already started to fade, and the bruises have changed from ugly purples to pale yellows and greens. The skin around his eye is slightly swollen and the gash on his cheek is already healing nicely.
Steve is sitting near the edge of the bed, working the tension and aches out of Tony’s feet. He can’t help but grin to himself from the sounds Tony produces. It reminds him of another activity.
“Okay, okay. No need to get defensive. I just thought it was weird. I mean what else can it be? You don’t gain weight.”
But a baby. A baby that was his. It was life altering that was for sure, but he’d get a family. For the longest time he had been afraid to have that. He didn’t want to end up like his father or worse.
Happy makes a noise of annoyance. “It doesn’t seem like that from where I’m standing. Has your water broken? Are you dilating?”
It wasn’t the only unusual thing he’s experienced. The past few months have been odd. He found himself fatigued more often, and on a few occasions he’d feel sick to his stomach. Those symptoms were worrisome, but he had pushed those aside too. He blamed the stress from the breakup and the amount of work he’s been having to do with his teammates.
But even if Steve was out getting some space, Tony didn’t like the idea of him being on his own. He didn’t want to accuse Steve of being unstable, but as of late his emotions had been a mess.
He was alone in the communal living room with a movie playing. It had only been put on as background noise while he tried to work on his latest sketch, but somehow or another he found himself intrigued by the movie playing on the screen.
The door to the training room opens and Sam steps inside. Judging by the look on his face, Steve knows he’s needed. Peter must notice too because he sighs sadly.
Tony knew better than to ask Peter about the night Steve died. He was curious and wanted to know more, but at the same time he wasn’t sure if he could handle the details. Steve had died protecting others. That’s all Tony needed to know.
“Please, Tony. Do something!” Steve fights with the cuffs again. He doesn’t want to be released, but he wants Tony to stop teasing and just fuck him already.
Steve winces and nods his head. “A hell of a lot worse. Trust me, it’s fine. I’ve done this before.”
“Did the baby…” Peter begins to say and then quickly stops himself. “Sorry. It’s none of my business.”
Steve nods and rests his head on Tony’s shoulder. “I hope so. I’m tired of feeling like this. I want things to go back to normal.”
“Yeah!” Peter nods at the memory. “It’s so tiny like a little seed and it’s going to get bigger and bigger until it’s big enough to come out!”
“I’m almost done here. Sam and I-” Steve winces when he realizes he’s forgotten to introduce his friend. He turns around to face Sam and apologizes. “I’m so sorry. I wasn’t deliberately trying to ignore you.”
Steve waits another second, hoping his son would be comfortable enough to come forward, but when he doesn’t, he sighs.
Tony never gets down on one knee and spills his whole heart out. There’s nothing, no signals whatsoever. Steve had misinterpreted everything, and he can’t help the feeling of disappointment that washes over him.
“Sometimes, yeah. It wasn’t supposed to really happen, but I’m glad it did. I wondered if Peter was for a reason and...yeah I think he is. We were falling apart before him and now-”
He was a father first, and soon to be husband. In just a few months he’d be tying the knot with Tony. It’s something he never envisioned happening. Their relationship had ended and they were supposed to have remained friends. But that didn’t work out, and then having Peter changed everything.
“You’re lucky you get to do it though. I wanted this more than anything.” Steve rubs circles over the bump. “Thank you for giving me a son. Thank you for doing this for me...because you didn’t have to.”
“Oh...yeah. Get some sleep, honey.” Tony keeps his arms wrapped around Steve, letting his hands fall to his middle. The muscles aren’t as firm as they used to be; the baby weight hasn’t been shed yet, not that Tony cares. Steve was perfect no matter what form he was in.
“And did nothing!” Bucky snaps and jumps to his feet. “Look at what happened because of us!” he gestures angrily at the door.
“I like this one.” Steve comes over to show Tony the shade of blue he wants to paint the room. Tony makes a face and Steve frowns. “What? It’s simple.”
Tony grunts above him. He can tell Steve is close, not just from his declaration, but by the way he clenches tightly around him. It brings Tony closer to the edge.
Tony nods and pulls the bottle away from Peter’s lips, emitting a whimper from his son’s pouty mouth. Peter searches for the bottle, growing agitated when it’s no longer in his reach. Steve takes the fussy baby into his arms and begins comforting him, holding his son close to let him smell his scent. Peter still whimpers, his cries growing louder.
“My name is Natasha Romanoff. I’m an Agent for SHIELD and have been tasked to...keep an eye on you.”
“No,” Peter replies, then he’s frowning. “I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a kid? He was gone a lot but I don’t think it was for dates.”
“Anyway. I was going to take you to my penthouse but I think a drive would have to do. I don’t need questions.”
Pierce isn’t even trying to hide. He’s standing near a tiny bar, a drink in hand. Steve hates how much this scene reflects the last one he had with the alpha. But this time Steve wouldn’t run away. This time he would plunge the knife inside the alpha’s body.
For a moment, Steve hesitates. It would be easy to walk away now that the alpha was contained and without aid. Steve could walk out right now with his mate and son. He would be free.
It’s not until they’re at Peter’s locker does Ned shake his arm gently to get his attention. “It’s not about the ba-you know. Flash is coming.”
It’s not just Steve excited about the news. The whole team is happy and looking forward to the new family member. Natasha is keeping her fingers crossed that they have a girl.
Their relationship wasn’t perfect, in fact it was far from it. It was always going to be rocky and eventually crumble, but Steve had hope. They had managed to become friends, and maybe if they worked hard, that friendship would progress to more.
“Hurry up,” the alpha orders and turns away to let the omega dry himself off. Steve makes sure he’s quick about it, not wanting to be exposed for another minute.
It was just the depression, Tony knew that, but he and depression go way back. He knew it wasn’t just a roll coaster of emotions with depression. There were other, and sometimes, worse side effects.
The pain is unlike anything he’s ever felt. It didn’t compare to the time when he lost his parents; not even close. It was a different kind of hurt. Not that he didn’t grieve when he lost his parents, but it had been Steve that saved him from his pain. It had always been Steve.
Tony sighs when his daughter continues to express her displeasure. It was times like this when he wishes Steve was here. He wonders if Steve’s absence is the reason why Morgan was upset.
There’s no response and Steve’s eyes flutter. A wave of panic washes over Peter and he clings tightly to his father, bent over him and sobbing into his chest. Peter lays his head just above the star in the center, his ears filling the soft beating of his father’s heartbeat. It reminded him of a lullaby, bringing comfort and washing away all of his worries. It soothed him when nothing else could.
Ned doesn’t bring up Peter’s suspicious behavior, but as soon as they’re at the tower and Peter is leading him toward his room, Ned cracks.
He was given a chance to have a mate, pups, and the simple life he had envisioned for himself. It took time for him to overcome his traumas and the past that haunted him occasionally, but with the help of his mate and new best friend, Steve was himself again and living the life he desired.
But their relationship was rocky, probably on the verge of crumbling if it hadn’t already. It had been Peter’s choice to step back and ask for space. He had rushed into a relationship with his dad too soon without taking the time to think if having a relationship with him was what he truly wanted. Maybe Peter had only wanted to find his dad because the only parental figure he had was ripped out of his life. He needed that void filled.
“No no I get it. And by the way I am capable of hanging up my own suit. I do care about this family.”
Tony begins picking up, then he goes in search of Steve and their son. It’s not difficult to find them. Steve is in the bathroom giving Peter a bath. The door is slightly ajar, and Tony pauses behind it, listening to Steve talk and coo to their son. He can’t help but smile.
This time Peter does look up and he regrets it almost instantly. Flash doesn’t even acknowledge him, not that Peter expected him to. They only crossed paths when Flash decided to harass Peter.
“Back away,” Rumlow orders and pushes Tony into the room. Tony staggers momentarily and Steve rushes toward him, only to back off when Brock points the gun at him. “Back away.”
“Eh.” Tony shrugs and takes another sip from his glass, wincing at the bitter taste. “It’s not all fun and games, kid. It’s dangerous, you’re always having to watch your back.”
She picks up on his voice, and she throws the blankets off. She hasn’t missed him yet; he’s still drinking his morning coffee.
Tony smiles and kneels down to be at their level. Harley gets to him first, crying out ‘daddy!’ and hugging him tightly. Sarah takes a little longer to get to her father. Her tiny legs and imperfect motor skills hold her back, but once she gets close enough to him, she gives up on walking and throws herself into his arms, causing the alpha to laugh and hold her close. He greets them both with a kiss.
Steve has been up against Natzis, waking up in a new world, otherworldly beings, some of the worst mercenaries on the planet, but none of those terrified him as much as the sleeping boy in his arms.
“You’ve been well cared for I see,” The alpha says as he carefully examines the omega. “Not a single scratch or ma-”
“I never should’ve done it.” Steve sobs and clings tightly to Tony. “I just couldn’t-it was a part of him and I just-Tony, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
It happens a few more times, along with the cramping. He brushes it off to avoid working himself up over nothing. He couldn’t be stressed and worried now, not when his son was going to arrive at any time. He needed to be there for Tony.
Steve is careful when he takes his daughter into his arms. He’s immediately transported back to the night he gave birth to her, alone in a dark room with no one to aid him. She had been the reason why he decided to fight back against Hydra.
Another boom echoes, the space filling with thick, gray smoke. All Steve can think about is his team and if they had gotten out before the second explosion.
He can’t decide if he’s more angry or devastated over the test result, perhaps a bit of both. But right now, the anger is winning and he throws the stick in the trash.
“Just trust me on this okay? I know what I’m-I kind of know what I’m doing. Right now everything’s good and I’m working on finding him a safe place to lay low. Obviously he can’t stay here forever.”
Steve sneaks out of the room and rushes back toward the table where their forgotten plates of food remained. He grabs the knife from his own plate. He sets his gaze down the hall, an idea forming in his mind. One stab with the knife and it would be over. His abuser would be gone.
He traces a finger along the gray blob, noticing the small shape of a head already forming. He tries to remember the posters he had seen in the doctor’s office so that he can compare his baby to the ones posted.
He was getting better now that he was away from his tormentors and in a safe place. There were still days, like the one today, where he questioned himself and his existence. But getting back to his old self was going to take time, and Tony promised he’d be there every step of the way.
“No! No, dad, everything’s fine. I’ve been busy. School’s almost done so I have tests to prepare for and then I’m training with Auntie Nat.”
“Super fast, huh?” Steve smiles and ruffles Peter’s hair. “I want to see more of that speed tonight when you’re brushing your teeth.”
“We’ll figure it out,” Tony says. Morgan continues to stare up at him, finding comfort in the familiar voice. “Listen,” Tony sighs. “I don’t know how long papa is going to be away but...it’s just going to be you and me. I’m not him obviously. I know you’re annoyed with me because I’m probably doing everything wrong, but I’ll do my best. And then soon papa will be back and we’ll be happy again. Sounds good, right?”
Steve’s brows furrow and he picks up the wadded up tissues. He unfolds the tissues and gasps audibly at what he finds. He picks up the pregnancy test and stares at the two pink lines.
Steve continues, “Maybe one day you’ll get to see it for yourself. If you choose to. I’m not going to push you into being a father. I think I pushed enough. You left because of me, and I’m sorry. If you choose to stay wherever you are, I won’t hate you for it. I won’t tell our son that you’re a bad father...because you’re not.
“Yeah. But not too crazy, right? I told Natasha that it was and...I don’t know...I feel bad about it. I’m terrified, but at the same time I...I love him so much and...sorry, I’m not making any sense.”
Steve is ready to ask what ‘here’ was, but he’s never given the chance. Tony is already getting out of the car and walking around to open Steve’s door. Steve takes his offered hand and gets out.
It hurt. The pain was worse than anything Tony’s ever felt before. He knows JARVIS means well, but the videos are torture. He can’t take it anymore.
Now, his poor excuse for an office has been transformed into a room he doesn’t recognize. Tony had cleared away the bit of belongings he did have, and replaced them with items strictly meant for their son.
And don't worry Steve will get his heats back. I mean how else are they supposed to have another pup? ;)
“I need you.” The desperation in Tony’s voice is almost unrecognizable to the alpha. He usually didn’t beg like this, didn’t have a reason to. But being near Steve was doing something to him.
Steve was happier; Tony has never seen his husband so happy. The smile that appeared on his face when he first stepped through the front door of their apartment was one of the brightest Tony has seen in awhile. And the tears Steve cried had no hurt behind them. The pain was gone.
He doesn’t thank her and instead rushes toward the door to the separated room. It’s locked and he reaches for the badge to scan himself in. The door remains locked and he curses, one hand coming down roughly on the metal door.
Two years later and the pain wasn’t as severe. The world had Captain America back, though not the Captain they remembered. Sam Wilson didn’t hesitate to take up the shield and fight for what was right. The Avengers had a leader and their team was no longer broken. Even Iron Man had decided to take his place among them.
Sam winces. “I’m sorry, man. I get worked up when I hear about assholes like him. It makes me want to kick their ass. I won’t because that’s unprofessional but it doesn’t mean I don’t think about it.”
Then when Steve started to show, they couldn’t help but get their hopes up. There was still some hesitation but they held on and continued to do so. It paid off because soon Steve was entering his second trimester. They made it through the difficult part.
“Dammit!” Tony huffs and pulls himself to his feet. “Fine. No coffee but I need sleep. For once in my life I just want to sleep.”
“They’re asleep,” Steve says when he returns. He grabs his pajamas from the ottoman and begins changing, his back purposely toward his mate.
Tony dismisses his husband with a wave. “Don’t worry about it. I don’t even care about that. I’m just glad you two are okay.”
“I really am sorry,” Happy says after a few more minutes of silence passes between them. “I was a jerk. You’re actually not a bad guy.”
Morgan finally gets the chance to work on her science project and tries going on morning runs. She hates them and vows never to do them again. She helps build Peter’s new suit and she’s asked to help with the next one or whenever a new upgrade is needed. It makes her feel special.
Steve glances down, his jaw clenching and fingers gripping his own knife tightly. He looks up when the alpha continues.
“It’s okay,” Steve assures, but he can tell his words do little to break the tension in the air. He doesn’t want his friends to act like they’re walking on eggshells around him. Tony’s name wasn’t going to be forbidden.
“No,” Tony shakes his head angrily. “You didn’t. I hurt you. I said I wasn’t him but I’m not any better.”
Steve huffs out a small laugh and his eyes flutter open. “You’re a terrible liar. I could hear you pacing for thirty minutes.”
“You’re okay. You, me and mommy are okay now. And...your brothers and sister. I’m sure you’ll love them. I haven’t met them yet but they seem like good pups. If they’re anything like your mother.”
“Tony,” Steve starts to say, the name weighing heavily on his tongue. “I know it’s been a while since we’ve...well...you know. I gave up a long time ago on reaching out to you; I knew you had moved on and I tri-I did the same.
“Yeah. I’ll worry about it later. I just want to take care of everything else and get back to you as soon as I can.”
“Yeah?” Steve sniffs and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his sweater. “Then if I didn’t mean it then why...forget it.”
Peter is ready to protest, too hesitant and terrified to let his dad take him. The rest of the team would discover that Peter had been lying and sneaking out to meet the one person they weren’t fond of.
“I know. But you need to heal and this might help. What is the one thing you wish you could’ve said to him?”
“He’s still young and he still needs his dad. It’s nice to see you getting excited over your son. It’s sweet. Don’t screw it up.”
“You could’ve gotten some coffee or a muffin. The break room on the first floor has those tiny blueberry ones.”
It’s also the last push he needed. He wanted to meet his dad and find out what he was really like. Maybe he wasn’t such a bad guy and just deserved a chance. Peter believed in second chances. And maybe his dad needed one.
“It’s okay,” Steve soothes, hoping to coax his son back to him. He stretches out a hand and James eyes it for a moment, then he takes it. Steve smiles. “I won’t hurt you. Mama will never hurt you.”
Steve’s legs are forced open and the alpha crawls between them, pressing Steve deeper into the mattress. Pierce’s lips are on him again, his tongue forcefully making his way into Steve’s mouth. The omega fights back, using his strength to push the alpha away.
“Let me have my fun,” Pierce says and he pushes himself all the way in. He sighs in pleasure when he’s engulfed in a tight heat. He doesn’t even give the omega a chance to adjust before he’s thrusting his hips. “You feel just like I remember. Still tight after all those alphas, after all those pups.”
“Is she okay?” Steve asks. Tony’s eyes flicker up to meet Steve‘s, then they’re settling back on the wrapped hand.
Sam is with him. Bucky had decided against the idea. It was nothing new. Bucky was never a morning person to begin with.
Morgan snaps him from his thoughts when she squirms in his arms and once glance down shows her face contorting in distress. Tony waits for the crying to start, but when she relaxes and drifts off to sleep, he can’t help but sigh in relief. His goal right now was to keep her content so that his husband could get a few hours of rest.
I really wanted to do a few fluffy chapters before some of the angst comes in. This family deserves some happiness 😊
“Don’t.” Steve warns. Another growl is building in his chest. Omega’s were usually not the defensive type, unless it came to their pups. All of Steve’s instincts are screaming at him to protect his pup. “She’s mine.”
“He never said anything bad,” Peter continues, “he’d only talk about you if I asked. He wanted us to meet one day. I think he was hoping it would’ve been sooner and...under better circumstances.”
“That’s okay,” Steve assures and rises to his feet. “You guys have time. And your dad and I are here if you need anything, okay?”
Steve glances down at himself, completely forgetting that he had borrowed something of Tony’s. That’s when he notices the slightly faded logo.
He finds the strength to lift himself up and turn his body around. He stumbles for a moment before catching himself and leaning back against the edge of the bed. His gaze drops, eyes landing on the doctor kneeling between his legs. But it’s the infant in her arms that steals away all of his attention.
“I know you do. It’s been too long since you’ve let me do this. You’re always fucking other alpha’s. It’s my turn.”
His stomach rumbles again, reminding him of why he had gotten out of bed in the first place. Steve leaves the bedroom in search of two things: food and Tony.
Tony can’t help but reach out for the photo, only to pull back when he hears Peter return. He turns around to find his son laying out medical supplies on the coffee table.
The phone call was what made Peter decide to sneak on the jet and help. He knew a little bit about his dad and the history his parents had, but he’s never seen his papa call or beg his dad for anything. It had always been the two of them and that was enough. They didn’t need anyone else.
“Hey maybe tomorrow if you’re up to it we can go shopping. The kid’s gonna need more stuff,” Tony says.
The tears stream down his face and he uses the sleeve of his shirt to wipe them away before he’s noticed, but he’s not quick enough, and he glances up when a hand rests over his shoulder.
Peter tries to open his eyes, squinting at first before fully opening them. Tony smiles at him and gently wipes around his pouty lips.
“And what about all that stuff you said? Was any of that real? Answer me. Since you’re standing here demanding if the feelings I had for you were real then tell me if the ones who had for me meant something. Did it?”
“We all feel like that. I’m sure Tony’s told you all of the times he’s had that same thought. I know I’ve had them.”
“Easy, Nat,” Sam steps in, making sure to lay a hand over Bucky’s chest. He’s still unsure about what his husband will do next, but he’s not afraid to put himself between Bucky and his friends. He’d be the only one to calm Bucky if he needed to.
Steve keeps his eyes on his daughter’s, hoping she would be enough to distract him from those tormenting thoughts.
It was Tony who got to experience all of those things. Steve had been by his side through it all. It wasn’t the same as going through it himself, but it was still an experience he’d never forget.
And I’m not saying Steve is innocent because he was involved too. He got screwed over yeah but in the end is was miscommunication from both of them.
Alexander Pierce. Hydra. They were the reason why Steve decided to fight for others. They were the bullies he couldn’t stand. But they were also the ones that beat him down and broke him until he couldn’t remember what he had even been fighting for. Steve wasn’t a savior or a hero. He was just an omega. He had failed everyone. He had failed himself.
There’s that word again. Tony still felt nothing. His heart didn’t flutter with joy when the doctor let them listen to the baby’s heart.
Now that he’s closer, Tony is able to get a whiff of him. He’s an omega. The scent is tinged with fear, making the alpha’s nose wrinkle. But underneath the tainted scent, he’s able to detect the omega’s natural sweetness.
Steve takes a moment to catch his breath and he tips his head back, focusing on the simple task of breathing. Tony finds his hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.
Steve glances toward his left, eyes landing on his mate’s sleeping form. Tony is fast asleep, undisturbed by nightmares and past experiences. Steve can’t help but envy him for that. They both had gotten their lives back, but it seemed as if Steve was struggling a little more to regain his.
“I do it!” Peter tries again to take the bag. With a huff Steve gives in before Peter decides this is the morning to scream. He keeps one hand on the bag to help pour in the chips.
“Must be all that super serum,” Sam jokes as both he and Bucky finally catch up. Bucky glares in his direction and elbows him hard in the ribs. “Ow! What was that for?”
