“You didn’t even think to talk this through with us, first?”
after Tony's own parents had died.
Y'all. This chapter felt like the mental equivalent of me beating my head against the wall. For the life of me, my brain could not write this chapter in a reasonable amount of time. But it's finally done, it's here, and it can stop being a pain in my ass. This one is a bit of a sweeter chapter but don't worry if you're a fan of angstier or smuttier chapters. Chapter 5 is going to have plenty of both 😉
Perhaps it was the wine loosening his inhibitions or the shock of the evening’s events wearing off, but Steve realized that the courtesan wasn’t just handsome; he was gorgeous, with his dark wavy hair and, much to Steve’s surprise, solidly built. The courtesan was shirtless aside from the gold body chain encircling and accentuating his torso. He looked more at ease in Steve’s rooms than Steve was, his hands at home in the pockets of his crimson silk pants. They were not quite the same shade of red found in Brooke’s crest, but close. The color suited his tanned skin well. In the firelight, he reminded Steve of one of the creatures of old, like a phoenix or a griffin, something powerful and dangerous, but you couldn’t help but be drawn in for a closer look.
“Fuck,” Steve hisses. “Just like that.”
He dressed quickly with Peter’s assistance and murmured his thanks when the boy set his meal before him. Cook had spoiled him today with baked salmon, a hearty loaf of bread, and soft creamy cheese as a spread. He didn’t miss the longing way Peter stared at his plate as he cut at his salmon.
Thor’s exit was just as flashy as his entrance; as he called out Heimdall’s name, the Bifrost in all of its multicolored beauty engulfed the god, scorching the earth on which he had stood. The scent of ozone and something metallic which Steve couldn’t help but associate with magic lingered on the air.
“Sir, may I remind you that you’ve been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.”
"You're not worried someone will come looking for us?" Tony asked from beside him.
Steve groaned, one hand taking himself in hand and jerked his cock until he was cursing, come spurting from the tip. The first rope hit Tony right below his eye and Tony was coming again—he didn’t even
He delighted in the way Steve shivered, his fingers frozen where they hovered above his keyboard.
"What? No!" He says, raising his hands. Hell hath no fury like a Pepper scorned. "I'm here, in the flesh. I just got...distracted. I guess I haven't really taken a day for myself."
. Life wasn’t kind because in the middle of the night, Happy Hogan had been caught in the crossfire of an explosion in the heart of Hollywood. No, life wasn’t sweet, nor was it kind. And Tony had the sick feeling that it wouldn’t be for a long time.
With his other hand, Steve seized Tony by the jaw and forced Tony to look up at him. “Say it,” Steve rasped. “Say you’re my bitch and I’ll fuck your face like you’ve been gagging for it all day.”
“No,” she says slowly as if to weigh her words. “He wants you too much. I don’t think he could give you up even if he wanted to.”
The thought of doing what he pleased with that
Natasha has risen out of her seat, pacing the length of the boardroom, trying to make sense of it all. “Okay. Let’s say I’m HYDRA,” she says. “I have a super-soldier at my disposal. I try to replicate my serum to create more soldiers, but the trials aren’t successful. I still want an army of enhanced soldiers at my disposal.”
weren't nice," Tony counters. Steve rests his hands on Tony's hips, a stance of theirs that's quickly becoming one of Tony's favorites. He'd die before he'd admit it out loud, but he likes the size difference between him and Steve. Especially when the other man is leaning down to kiss him.
Steve has a beard now, Tony thinks idly, watching the other man from across the patio. Dark brown hair hides a jaw so defined as if an artist had spent years painstakingly crafting it out of marble. He’s wearing a Yankees cap, and oh that must
"Did not," Carmen says, and Clint has the good sense to look bashful. "This is normal for us. Especially when someone hasn't reached out in
“Why?” Steve asks. “I’d rather you just tell me.”
You may have noticed that the chapter count increased
Okay, it did. But Steve would never admit that.
Part of Tony wants to latch onto his arm, pull him through the glass and the rubble of his penthouse suite, and into his bedroom and never let him go. He stomps that urge down with steel-toed boots.
“I’ll convene with Asgard’s sorcerers as soon as I return,” Thor cut in. “Thank you, Widow.”
“Tator,” Rhodey finished.
” Every fleeting touch a "
“Do you ever let anyone else talk?” Steve finally blurted out, throwing up his hands. “I’m not here to force feed you or drag you off to bed. Although, I’m definitely considering it.”
The future—the
He stepped closer to the edge of the cliff, standing in between the two pillars and held his breath. Every fiber in his being was telling him to look down but Steve couldn’t. He couldn’t bring himself to look down and see Natasha’s body lying prone and broken like a puppet who’s strings had been cut.
Rhodey stays when Sunset Bain works her deadly magic on Tony and sinks her claw-like nails into his back, taking his dignity and Stark Industries secrets with her.
“I’m sure he’s a natural at riding,” Rumlow said with a smarmy smile that made Steve’s skin crawl. “Can’t be that different from his profession?” How could a man like that be a knight and personal guard to his father nonetheless?
"That's a relief," Clint says, actually sounding relieved. "Who else is gonna call me out on my bullshit?"
"I'm holding you to that, Stark."
“I managed to wrestle it away from Loki before he disappeared.” Steve strode towards the closet, praying that his suspicion was right. He felt around blindly before his hands curled around the staff of the scepter.
“Consider it an order,” Steve said, his tone brooking no argument. He pushed his plate towards Peter again who slowly, carefully reached for the loaf of bread like he expected Steve to snatch it back.
“Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate—”
Steve practically pins Tony down with his gaze. Tony wets his lips and finishes with, "We trust each other. Alright?"
have to talk about anything or answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable, if you don’t want to.”
A wave of melancholy washed over him as he realized that he had missed this. He had missed
And Natasha…Natasha had wanted him to let them go. To let
Steve buries his head into Tony's neck. "I almost lost you," he says, his voice breaking.
“And if I don’t?”
The sorceress, once again in those same sunshine yellow robes, stared at him from across the sturdy wooden table, her hands folded primly in front of her. Like last time, Steve hadn’t even needed to knock, the door to the Sanctum opening up for him as if through…well, magic. He had been escorted by a young woman, another sorcerer, he assumed given she was also wearing robes and the familiar ring he had noticed both Doctor Strange and the yellow-robed woman wore. His escort had referred to the yellow-robed woman as the Ancient One and suddenly, Steve had a deep understanding for Tony’s dislike of all things magic.
“I could show you a whole new world,” Tony said when they broke apart for air. “All you have to do is say yes.”
A band of scouts dressed in traditional green hunting livery entered the clearing and declared their findings as if summoned. There
At first, he felt nothing, like he had been severed from his body completely. Then someone started screaming.
thinking about the status of their relationship.
Tony shrugged and rose to his feet on shaky knees, Steve’s eyes burning into him like smoldering coals the entire way. He plucked a few tissues from the box sitting on Steve’s desk and wiped at his face before Steve’s come could truly start to dry. “We both got what we wanted, didn’t we?” Tony asked, zipping up his suit. Hopefully no one would make any mention of the suspicious stains along his groin.
All chaos had broken out with Rhodey then teaming up with Steve to damn near try to drown Tony in ketchup.
"It is scary," Tony admits. "It takes immense bravery, too, which you have in spades."
, I suggest that you go check that fic out first as it sets up the events of this fic.
grown comfortable. Too comfortable. All of this time spent living in the bubble that was Stark Tower, Steve had forgotten about his mission. AJ had said he deserved happiness, but what had Steve done in this timeline to make that a reality? In that moment he knew what he had to do. He had a phone call to make.
About halfway through the movie, he grows tired of Tony’s unending stiffness. He just wants Tony to be comfortable. He says so, leaning close to Tony to whisper in his ear. “I’m not gonna bite.”
“But I didn’t,” Steve muttered to himself before realization struck him. His eyes shot to Bucky, who was easing out of his seat and towards the door. “Bucky!”
Steve's response is instantaneous. "Don't pull away from me."
“I told you I wanted to fill you
Steve's eyes flit up to meet his, and Tony's surprised to see that they're red.
Rhodey had took one look at them and shook his head. “JARVIS, am I the only adult in the tower?” he had asked.
he could come that fast let alone untouched—stars bursting behind his eyelids. Both of them were moaning now with no shame, Tony filling up his already soiled suit—God, explaining the stains to his dry cleaner won’t be a fun conversation—a second spurt landed right on Tony’s tongue, the salty taste of Steve’s come engulfing his taste buds. Tony took Steve back into his mouth who cried out at the sudden onslaught of stimulation, one final last rope of come filling Tony’s mouth. Tony swallowed around Steve’s cock head, taking the load like a good slut and Steve pushed against Tony’s head half-heartedly.
“I’m going to finish my report,” Steve murmured, “and you’re going to sit on my cock like a good slut. And maybe, if you do what you’re told, I’ll fuck you just like you need. It’s up to you.”
. For so long, after they had thawed him out from the ice, Steve remembered feeling like a passenger in his own life. His days prior to the Avengers had been filled with him training, always getting ready for the next mission that never came, never allowing himself to properly grieve over everything he had lost. And then they had been brought together, whether it be by fate or through man-made machinations, and Steve’s life had had a purpose again.
“She’s organizing a week-long carnival in upstate New York for local orphanages. Think you or any of the others would be interested in working a booth?” Pepper says. “Having all of the Avengers show up would drum up a lot of publicity.”
In a technical breach of etiquette, Tony greeted Steve last. He couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Pepper was unimpressed. “Sure.”
with perhaps a little too much force, as his desk rattles when the book lands. “That’s false. My ass is definitely my best feature.”
Natasha and
Confusion rippled over him. Why in the world would Pepper and Tony fight over
He walks further into his living room, and Steve rises to meet him until they're standing chest to chest. Tony has to look up at Steve, but Steve's never held it over him like others. It should scare him, how small Steve makes him feel. But Tony doesn't feel helpless.

“You better.”
On a bitter, cold December’s night, Howard and Maria Stark are killed in a car crash along some deserted back road and something in Tony
“I don’t think you’re,” Tony began before suddenly pausing. “Did you just say fuddy-duddy or did I hallucinate that? It’s very possible I could have hallucinated that. I haven’t slept in 36 hours.”
He’s fucked.
Tony blindly grasps for the drawer of his nightstand, rooting around until he finds what he's looking for: a bottle of lube.
His head jerked to the side, trying to find the source of the voice.
A numbness settled deep inside himself like a stone pit had been dropped into the bottom of his stomach. Annihilated. The universe had
He had stood back like a coward as Tony had taken his dying breath, a litany of
Steve flushes but lets Tony go.
“How about a nice vibrating cock ring, hmm? Slip it on you early in the morning. Maybe a long-distance remote to go with it, keep you hard and ready all day long.”
Steve was always so sweet, so gentle, but when they were in bed? Tony got to see a side to him that few ever did. Steve craved control and didn't back down from a challenge, and Tony would gladly give it to him.
Tony’s eyes shot open as he flipped over in his bed. He was sweaty and shaky from the dream but nothing filled him with more terror in that moment than seeing the Mark 42 poised over Pepper, ready to strike. Tony rolled out of the bed, gesturing with his hands and shouted, “Power down.”
Despite being dead for 21 years, Howard’s voice came back to whisper in his ear. “Stark men are made of iron,” Tony muttered to himself.
“That’s what I’m doing right now! I thought…I thought you’d be happy for me.”
"We strike fast, and we strike hard, leave them absolutely no time to recoup. HYDRA, no doubt, has a number of facilities at their disposal. We find them, and we burn them to the ground. Any operatives who surrender
"Fuck, fuck fuck, how are you so fucking
Steve doesn’t try to block that day from his mind. It would be doing a disservice to both him and Tony. They had gotten off on the wrong foot in the beginning, practically itching for a fight. And now…Steve doesn’t know what to call them now. All he knows is that Tony drives the cold away. With his blinding grin and his near manic energy and his big brown eyes, whenever Tony directs his full attention at him, it’s like he’s laying out in the sun.
She waved her fingers lazily and her teacup refilled itself (black tea this time with a dollop of honey).
Steve’s foot moved his foot rhythmically up and down and up and down Tony’s clothed cock as he spoke. “He told me how you used to suck him down and
In other words, not a snowball’s chance in hell.
“I hope you got a good night’s rest. His Majesty, the king, has arranged for a hunt later this morning.”
“You like when I call you a slut? Oh, but it’s just for me, isn’t that right?” Steve’s voice had taken on a wild edge like he stood on that precipice that separated humans from beasts. Tony's fingers ached from clutching at the corners of the desk, but it was a good ache, one that he welcomed. No doubt the rest of his body would be deliciously sore as well. He’d just make Steve massage him afterward.
," she says, slapping Tony on the arm twice for emphasis.
"I broke the bastard's spear in half and ran him through with my sword," an annoyingly smug voice said. Great. Rumlow would be accompanying them on the hunt. Following the sound of the voices, Steve's palfrey trotted gracefully into the clearing. All conversation ground to a halt as Steve came into view. So much for going unnoticed.
"Trust me," Steve says, grinning. "I can do this all day."
Instead, Steve rolled his eyes affectionately, slid one hand up to cup the back of Tony’s neck and ushered his head down. He caught Tony’s lips easily, their mouths slotting together like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Steve grinned into the kiss as Tony reached up to cup his face.
A million emotions slammed him all at once. Anger, fear, so much fear, but…there was hope too. Just a sliver, but he would hold onto it with all of his will.
," he says, hating the desperate chord in his voice. "Wreck me, worship me, do whatever you
"God, these guys are like roaches," Clint says, cutting through the silence, tossing his tablet down on the table. "They could survive a nuclear winter."
Carmen couldn't have picked a better day for a carnival; It's not too hot out for it to be August nonetheless. A slight breeze ruffles Tony's ungelled hair, sending his bangs into his eyes. He smooths the hair back with a huff. So much for keeping it casual today. His brief irritation dissipates when he looks, truly looks, at his surroundings.
That one had been last week. And true to word, Tony hadn’t received any more voicemails. He just replayed the same ones over and over and over until he could practically repeat them verbatim. Was it weird? Maybe. But he was Tony Stark. He was allowed to be eccentric.
Later on, he does the same with his shortbread, dipping the sweet buttery biscuit into his coffee. Tony takes a sip from his coffee, barely suppressing the grin of satisfaction that hasn’t left his face since Steve took his first bite. The taste of the whiskey melds sweetly with the butter of the shortbread and lights a fire inside of him in the best way.
And so Tony cooks. His head spins the entire time and his hands tremble as he flips the omelette and everything down to his marrow is screaming.
for Tony. One more word out of Steve’s mouth and he’s done for.
draw him? The man was literal art in motion, calling attention to himself even when he wasn’t trying. Tony Stark could walk into a room and it was like all of the oxygen was his to own.
“I believe so, Colonel,” JARVIS had said.
Bucky caught Steve’s inquiring gaze and swallowed. “The more, the merrier.”
embarrassed. The only ones who saw his freak out were the bots and JARVIS, and they’d never tell anyone. They like Steve too much. Maybe it was a little silly of him to panic, but being friends with Tony Stark meant heart attacks on the daily. The man’s lack of self-preservation was truly astounding.

He kissed Steve wholeheartedly, his surprisingly calloused hands cupping Steve’s face, and all thoughts of Lady Carter fled from his mind as swiftly as a spooked horse. Steve quickly moved past his initial surprise and matched Tony’s enthusiasm, kiss for kiss, his hands finding home again on Tony’s ass.
to give Steve the satisfaction of hearing him moan. No, Steve would have to work for it.
“Lies,” Tony sputters, a flush pinking his cheeks. “Nothing but lies fall from your mouth, Rogers.”
Tony inhaled again, trying to shove the nightmare down to the deepest wells of his mind despite his therapist's advice.

"It's going to take more than a bunch of neo-nazis with delusions of grandeur to kill me."

. The words rang in his ears and Steve felt a hollowness inside him. He was always
"You bet," he replied, his voice muffled by the helmet obscuring his face.
Once again, I do not own Marvel or anything associated with it but if I did, this is what I'd do. Be prepared for (bad) comic book science/magic.
Tony arches a fine, dark brow, “You? Punctual? The man who slept in the ocean for nearly seventy years?”
His eyes snap up to Steve. Right. They were having a conversation. Tony’s self-loathing can kick in later.
"Solomita?" Natasha asks. "Fashion designer Carmen Solomita?"
“You experience things and then they’re over and you still can’t explain them. And that…that bothers me. It bothers me to my very
Tony mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like “Stupid super-soldiers and their stupid enhanced strength,” but he closed his eyes nonetheless, his long dark lashes casting shadows on his hollow cheeks. In what seemed like mere seconds, Tony’s breath evened out and Steve knew that he had truly fallen asleep. He really
pressing his lips to Steve’s and it felt like coming home. Steve tilted his head up into the kiss while his arm crept up and around Tony’s waist. In one fluid motion, Steve rolled so he was on his back. Tony let out a (very manly) squeal as Steve maneuvered him so that he was straddling Steve’s hips.
?" King Joseph himself could have walked into their meadow at that moment, and Steve still wouldn't have stopped fucking Tony. He might as well have been a feral beast driven only by his most base desires, and right then, he needed to
“Hey. Hey!” Tony said, getting the bot’s attention. “What are you doing in the corner? You know what you did. There’s blood on my mats, handle it.”
"And I told you I would not mock you," Tony replied. "You are handsome."
Tony yelped as he injected himself once more.
“I’m using that against you the next time you’re in the workshop at four in the morning.”
He doesn't know why he's telling Steve this. It's not a case of Tony being self-centered, looking at fan art of himself (and the other Avengers). It's just...kids are so pure and
an annoyingly tempting voice spoke in the back of his mind.
"Because I can," Tony says. He lets the water run down Steve's back, washing away the suds before he turns him back around to face him. "Because I want to," he whispers like it's a secret. "Is this okay?"
Rhodey gently placed a hand on his shoulder. “You okay?”
"Enough, you guys," Steve says, backing him up. "Stop messing around."
“Seeing you fall, today...it brought me low."

day. Despite not having spent the day fighting off an alien invasion with the others, he figured his brush with death by migraine more than made up for it. He was ready to curl up on the nearest relatively soft object and go to sleep for another seventy years. Only the sight of his teammates kept him awake, but just barely.

Seeing her bravery, Jackson cleared his throat. “I also served in Iraq. Para-rescue. I got shot down deep in enemy territory. The bullets had nearly caught me in my femoral artery.”
Some days his grief for everything he had lost would creep over him like an immense black storm cloud and engulf him whole until he could barely drag himself from his bed. It was on those days he missed his timeline the most. He missed
Steve was a prince, and theirs was a traditional kingdom. All his life, he had been raised with the notion that he was greater than the average man, meant for more than plowing fields. So for a peasant, no matter how lovely, to call him by his name like they were equals…
“No,” Pepper jabbed a finger in his direction. “You’re spying on me.”
"Anyway," he says pointedly, "can you point me in the direction of my booth?"
“That’s because you burn it, sir.”
“I don’t want to harp on this…but did you like the custom rabbit?”
Stepping past a stray Chitauri body, Steve mounted the steps of the building ready to knock when the door opened on its own.
He looked over at U. That was most definitely smoke. A fire had broken out, probably from one of the suit pieces and where was DUM-E? Still sweeping away in the corner. Of course.
The meeting does end up being important and, if possible, puts Tony in a worse mood.
If his father were to listen to what he had to say, Steve had to play by his rules. As much as it pained him, he carried his new eagle-pommeled sword and had the stablehands saddle the snowy white palfrey for today’s hunt. He hoped his father would consider it a sign of goodwill.
"Don't apologize for being decent," Steve murmured. "Save for Bucky and Dugan, no one else would have bothered."
“Bucky has the super-soldier serum,” Steve explains. “Or at least a modified version of it.”
“So…” he said slowly, “you saw me coming. And us having tea. But not…not the hemorrhaging.”
But where Tony went, others usually followed. Not like Steve could blame them. He’d follow Tony anywhere, too. First came Rhodey who had walked in on him and Tony in the penthouse mid-food fight. Steve had been
about the Time Stone but for the life of him he couldn’t remember. He just remembered the pain. And her kneeling beside him. And then the darkness came.
Tony arches a brow. “The same could be said for you. What, you left all the kids at home while you’re running errands?”
“Sensitive?” Steve says against his skin.
Tony whooped clapping his hands together as DUM-E did celebratory laps around the workshop. “Damn, I’m good. Knew all she needed was a choke.”
It doesn’t hit Steve until later that Natasha probably organized the whole thing from the start.
Mere seconds later, Steve's landing near them from seemingly nowhere, looking ready to kill. His eyes looking over Tony, "You okay?" he says, his voice rough.
“I like being alive more,” Clint said.
Tony responded at once. “Of course I do.”
“Yesss,” Tony drew the word out. “I missed you and your fingers stretching me out and your dirty fucking mouth.”
Steve trails off. Tony doesn't want to think about what his death would do to Steve. On many occasions, Tony had learned to never trust people who said they didn't have a dark side because chances were that they were lying. Steve had been his exception. Steve, who held him when he was lonely and drank hot chocolate with him on the nights when his demons got to be too much. How could someone like that have a dark side?
Steve should have let him go. After all, it had been his idea to send him to an inn, but...the courtesan's words had stung, and Steve had always been too stubborn for his own good.
HYDRA's dark secrets come to light putting the Avengers on edge.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said and he knew he was apologizing for far more than what he had said on the Helicarrier. “I had no right to say that you should stop pretending to be a hero.”
"I saw you
It’s odd, living by himself again. Of course, Tony brought his bots with him, and he integrated JARVIS into all of his personal residences. Still, there was no Pepper to remind him of some upcoming awards ceremony, no Rhodey to get into trouble with. Happy went with him because wherever Tony went, Happy followed. Tony’s sure Happy would have followed him into battle if he could. But Happy doesn’t stay in the tower, and Tony doesn’t expect him to. He knows Happy has a life outside of chauffeuring (and he hasn’t missed the looks between Happy and Pepper whenever she’s in town. He’s happy for them.)
“No, sire,” Peter said immediately, his voice cracking at the end.
Tony finds Steve in the communal gym, pounding away at a punching bag like it had insulted his mother. Tension radiates off Steve in waves, the muscles in his back taut. Tony deliberately makes a noise when he enters; as pent up as Steve is, the last thing he needs is to think that anyone’s sneaking up on him, and Tony doesn’t fancy being broken in half by his…
Tony catches up with Pepper and an old friend needs his help.
“Can Thor really fly?” Bruce says. “I feel like it’s more of a controlled fall. He throws his hammer and lets the weight of it take him where he needs to go.”
“Look for the choke,” Tony said. “Once you find it, open it. Keep the throttle closed otherwise you’ll flood the engine.”
Tony never thought Captain America would be so handsy, but he was quickly learning that Steve Rogers and Captain America were two different people.
He knows he still has time left on his break, but for some reason, he can't bring himself to care.
With Mjolnir in one hand and the briefcase in the other, Steve looked out towards the horizon while Bruce fiddled with the time machine. The sun had reached its peak since the early morning, casting sunspots across the tranquil surface of the lake. Steve's sense heightened ears picked up the noise of nature; birdsong, and chattering and squeaking, all sounds that had sorely been missed in the past five years. In the back of his mind, he remembered a conversation that had happened so long ago he had nearly forgotten about it.
“Okay, first of all, hard assery is most definitely not a word,” Steve retorted. “And second, I like you too.” Steve placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder and lowered his voice, “I know you like it here but Tony, you love Pepper don’t you?”
"You sure you're okay?" Steve asks, scanning Tony from head to toe. Steve can see through him so easily, his skin might as well be made of glass.

"Game plan. Right. We're here to work." Carmen clears her throat, a flush still staining her cheeks, and flips through some of the pages on her clipboard. "Okay, Tony, you're easy. You're running the basketball booth."
Peggy had listened intently as he explained himself as well as he could.

He can't help but chuckle to himself. Talking to Carmen was always so fun. She had the same (admittedly dorky) sense of humor as him. He remembered the days when they sat in the back of their homeroom, laughing at each other's stupid jokes over the morning announcements while their teacher gave them death glares. They kept in touch after graduation but not enough for Tony's tastes.

It’s nothing for Steve to pick Tony up, who only shifts in Steve’s grasp before settling. Steve lays him down face up on the navy blue sofa he called home whenever he came down to visit Tony. Tony stops snoring now that he’s sleeping like a normal human being, and the knot of tension in Steve’s chest loosens just a little. The next morning, Tony stumbles down to join the other Avengers for breakfast. He looks like he got a full night’s rest, his hair flying every which way, the bags under his eyes a little less defined. Steve makes fun of his snoring, and Tony vehemently denies it.
"And you couldn't ignore it."
Once again, the thought of calling Ross crosses his mind. Ross wants all of the Ex-Avengers of course, but if Tony gives him Steve, without a doubt the general would be jumping for joy.
Brad Pitt), but Steve is the literal epitome of human perfection. It could just be the childhood trauma rearing its ugly head, but Tony feels small underneath Steve. Unworthy. Useless. He’s thrown back to the present when Steve rolls his hips and slides his cock against Tony’s.
“It’s gone. Along with everything on your person.”
Now Tony’s pouting and look, Steve prides himself on being a gentleman and considerate, but he can’t help but lean forward and kiss the pout from Tony’s lips. It’s only fair after Tony kissed his cheek. Tony’s lips are soft and
Tony makes himself known, knocking on the wall.
Immediately to his left was Thor, who was gladly scarfing down what he deemed the “exquisite Midgardian cuisine,” followed by Tony who even without the appetite of a super-soldier, god, or a Hulk, managed to put away two sandwiches and was well into his third. Bruce had (thankfully) been provided with spare clothes and hyper-focused on his food, leaving just Natasha and Clint, who were sitting next to each other on his right-hand side.
and that's because I have a complete lack of self-control! 🎉 I'm not even going to try and guess what the final chapter count is going to be but I'll try not to go over 10.
It was like he had been completely submerged in water. The world had dropped from beneath his feet and he was sinking or falling or both, both Rhodey and Erin’s voices coming out muffled and distorted. He couldn’t move no matter how hard he willed himself too. His hands and legs—everything—had shut down. Everything except his heart. No
Tony looks up at him with fondness and lust his eyes. His lips are swollen and pink and his chest heaves slightly. A very large, very horny part of Steve practically purrs in satisfaction that
"You like them, don't you?" Pepper says. It's not a question.
“What was that about not wanting Dodger in your workshop?” Steve had said in a matter of fact voice.
“Searching the Nine Realms for Loki and dragging him back to Asgard, if it calls for it.”
“Excellent performance, sir,” JARVIS says. “Truly, Oscar-worthy. She didn’t suspect a thing.”
Rumlow’s smile dropped from his face as he gripped his reins tight in his hands and spurred his horse onward to catch up with King Joseph and the others.

Tony nods at her. A
Tony winced. He had made Mark 15 about three months ago. “Um…yeah. Sure. You know everyone needs a hobby, Pep. Even geniuses.”
It was Friday, movie night, and Tony had been in the workshop for twelve hours straight. Steve knew something was
Steve smiles, a bigger one than the last one. His thumb has slid under Tony's shirt, rubbing circles into his hip. "Thank you," he murmurs. "It's just... I'm worried about the mission."
"But just as handsome," Tony teased, prompting Steve to flush.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but I didn’t see anybody else carry a nuke on their shoulders into an interdimensional wormhole.”
“Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist,” he had answered quickly during their spat on the Helicarrier, brown eyes dancing with fight and fury and something he could only describe as
Comments, kudos, and bookmarks are much appreciated. I always love seeing your guys' reactions even if it's just a string of emojis. Truly, they make my day.
Tony gives him that blinding grin and Steve wants to kiss him again.
"And what of it?" Steve says like he's challenging him.
"No, because I actually have faith in our teammates. Clint's not gonna peg a kid with an arrow just because he feels like it. He's not the type."
Tony doesn't want to put him on the spot, but he knows Bruce will just try his best to brush his problems under the rug.
"It's gonna be okay, Buck," he murmured, squeezing Bucky tightly.
"They got close today," Steve says. His brow is furrowed, a scowl twisting his features. All of Tony's hard work, trying to get Steve to relax, down the drain. "Too damn close."
There’s a sadness to Tony too. It’s one Steve recognizes because he can feel it in himself. It feels like the Atlantic Ocean flooding his mouth and sapping the strength from his bones. He sees it in Tony when he thinks no one’s looking. He sees it when someone brings up his past, the drinking, the parties, the carelessness and a rotten taste fills Steve’s mouth when he remembers what he said on the Helicarrier.
Before we get started, just a friendly reminder that I don't own Marvel or anything related to it and this fic is just for funsies.
“Cognitive behavioral therapy? Emotional support animal?”
“Come on,” Tony says. “I’m not letting you freeze tonight or any other night.”

Steve stared at Tony.
“And what would you like to do for date night, sir?”
Tony expects for him to blush like he did earlier after his standoff with Romanov. But instead, the bastard
Natasha arched a brow. “And the scepter, where is it now?”
If possible, his frown deepened. He threw back his covers and stalked behind the partition dividing his wardrobe from the rest of the chambers. Peter had laid out a simple linen tunic dyed green and brown trousers. His hunting boots stood by his wardrobe, cleaned of mud and polished to perfection.
Friends didn’t palm each other under the dinner table.
Oddly enough, no. "No," Steve gave voice to his thoughts. "Not at all."
“You’re late,” she had said, her voice breaking at the end.
“I’m waiting,” Tony teased, and his mind was made up. Why deny himself pleasure indeed, especially when it was being offered so enthusiastically?
“Your Highness, my Lord,” Robb said, bowing at Steve, then Bucky. “The courtesan as you requested has arrived.”
Steve nodded his thanks and finished off his wine. He hoped it would do its job well and dull his mind. Marriage and heirs and thrones could wait until tomorrow.
"For the scouts to return," Dugan said. "They think there's a herd of deer nearby. Everyone's itching to take down the stag."
Thanks for reading! See you soon (maybe 👀).

“Thank you,” he says and pockets the flash drive. “I really do appreciate it.”
“It’s okay,” he says, and he means it. Because Pepper is still his and he’s still hers, just not in the way they had originally wanted.
"I'm not gonna bite, you know," Steve mutters when they start to ascend. He won't meet Tony's eyes. "I...I know you're afraid of me."
A fierce jolt of pride runs through him at the sight of Natasha and Clint wielding the batons and bow he made for them specifically, and he fights with a renewed sense of purpose. The HYDRA agents storm them all at once, but what's fifty men and women to six pissed off Avengers?
“The Iron Patriot? Could that be any more of a propaganda piece?”
Sometimes the food didn’t taste great, he’ll admit that. But it didn’t taste terrible either. It tasted

The courtesan said his name, sending a thrill of excitement through him. He liked the way his name sounded on his tongue.
Dropping their towels, they slide into bed together, tossing and turning until they’re somewhat comfortable, both of them unused to sharing a bed after being alone for so long. Tony curls up into Steve's side, tangling their legs together. Steve's hands stay at his sides, not pulling Tony close but not pushing him away either, making his stomach twist.
Steve hums and wraps his arms around Tony’s waist like he’s afraid Tony’s going to vanish into thin air. “Good,” he says and presses a kiss to Tony’s neck.
" Tony thinks, as they push forward. Thor wields Mjolnir with grace and finesse; it might as well be an extension of his arm. It's the hallmark of a person who's spent half their life spilling blood. Tony's the same when he has a gun in his hands, and this modified Chitauri gun is no different. Aiming and firing with the intent to kill, his weapons are all too happy to listen. And Steve, Steve fights with a dancer's grace, lethal power behind every one of his attacks.
“Thank you,” Steve says, his voice a rasp.
“She probably wasn’t the only one,” Bruce says. “There must have been hundreds of people at that fallout shelter, especially in the dead of winter.”
"Damn right," she says. "
The video started. At first it was just a solid black line but as Steve tried his best to heed the AI’s advice and pay attention to the video, it unfolded itself until suddenly Steve was looking at a triangle, then a square, then a pentagon, and so on so forth until it collapsed back into a single point.
Steve’s hands are so
It wasn't a question, but Steve answers anyway. "No. I couldn't."
The others are too far back to see Tony and Steve. It's easy up here, easy to forget that Steve's Captain America and Tony's a barely functioning former alcoholic with a slew of mental issues.
“I…I had to force your current conscience into your younger self’s body…it was the only way,” she said quietly.
“There’s this French saying,” Tony says, when he pulls away. His eyes shine in the dark of the night. “Mise en place.”
“I like the first one,” Chris said, biting her lip. “Hell, you all know why I’m here already, what else do I have to hide?”
Despite his body heat, Steve’s words leave Tony cold and shivering. He had been prepared for Steve to beg him to stop, to step away from the suit. He hadn’t prepared to think about sharing the same fate as Bucky; Battered and broken, only to be put together worse off than he was. A mindless puppet forced to commit countless horrors. And if HYDRA did it to Bucky, what was stopping them from doing it again, especially since their precious asset was on the run? Who’s to say there wasn’t already an army of brainwashed super-soldiers somewhere, ready to usher in HYDRA’s new world order?
"I can explain!" He throws his hands up to stop Rhodey's lecture in its tracks. "Someone at SHIELD knew when we were going to strike on the HYDRA base."

"God," Steve gasps into Tony's throat as he pulls out of him. Tony's right there with him, his skin hot to the touch, his legs still shaking from the force of his orgasm.
“Very good, sir,” Jarvis says with a soft smile. “You’ll be a master in no time.”

“And the left side…those are things that remind you of you?”
“But we lost
Shrugging he said, “What can I say? It grew on me.”
“The stone. I need the stone.”
Chris had spun the scissors in her hands a few times, a nervous tic Steve assumed, before explaining, “I served in Iraq about a year ago. I was a combat medic and…my unit….we were…we were scouting ahead and,” she paused.
"Are you sure?" Steve may be a super-soldier, but Tony's not going to be the one stuck explaining to Fury that Captain America was out of commission because of a blowjob gone wrong.
Tony tilted his head. "Just what would shake that admirable control?"
.” Steve punctuated each word with a hard thrust against that wonderful bundle of nerves. Tony bit his fist to keep from screaming. Was his dignity in shreds? Sure. Did that mean he wanted to stop? Hell no. But he wouldn’t give Steve the satisfaction of seeing him beg just yet. He needed just a little bit more, that push right over the edge of a cliff. His cock pulsed against his stomach, leaking pre-come.
The second time is purely a coincidence.
“What do you mean?” Bucky asked, brows furrowed. “Regardless if it was in bad taste, he’s still your gift. You can do as you please with him.”

“Steve, whatever you’re thinking—“
"Everything okay, Steve?" Tony says, giving him his most blinding smile.
Steve backs him into the tile, turning them away from the direct onslaught of the shower.
“Making mistakes is a part of the cooking process, Tony,” Jarvis says, stooping down to look him in the eyes. “Sometimes those mistakes make for the best meals. Think. How many meals do we have now that were made by mistake?”
Giving him a once over, Steve decided that he looked good. Dissolving into dust aside, the past few years Bucky had spent just living his life in Wakanda had done him some good. Gone was the emaciated look to his face that even Zola's version of the serum couldn't hide. Although diminished in appearance, Steve could still see the bags under his eyes, though. Perhaps they would always be there.
Rhodey curses again, enough to make even Tony blush before scrubbing a hand down his face. "I'm going on leave soon," he starts, pointing a finger at Tony. "Don't you dare die before I get to see you."
"Tony," Steve breathed. Was Tony's face always so close?
He’ll thank her later. Right now, he’s got his hands full, and he’s in no rush to let go.
He’s a little breathless when he says, “Yeah, that might work.”
no one had decided to keep their distance.
Steve’s brows furrow. “Bucky,” he murmurs under his breath. “Bucky?”
“But you still want to keep that one?”
“Not physically. Just...shaken. It was like the Battle of New York all over again. Do you know what that’s like? The thing you trust to keep you alive being your coffin?”

Vaguely, Tony could register Rhodey talking.

Steve swallows hard like he’s holding back a shout. “I’m fine.”
“Does not.”
“My mom brought us some on Family Weekend, remember?“
“Of course not, sir,” JARVIS said. Steve swore he could detect a hint of amusement in the AI’s voice.
Tony had been upset that he hadn’t been converted (his words, not Steve’s) on his stance on 80s movies and took it as a personal goal to get Steve to fall in love with at least one 80s movie and thus the Avengers movie night was born. Tony had JARVIS curate a list of the highest rated 80s movies and every Friday night, Steve and Tony would take turns picking a movie from the list, with Bruce, Rhodey, and Pepper occasionally making appearances. In a way, it was so similar to his original timeline where Tony along with Natasha, surprisingly, had been horrified at his lack of pop culture knowledge and had sought to rectify the situation. He still missed his original timeline and his Tony and his Natasha and all the others but his movie nights with Tony, quiet, intimate nights where it was just

There’s a pause as they take the time to ponder over what he said, long enough to make Tony squirm.
“How do I return the stone?” Steve said flatly.
Tony answers immediately. “No. I don’t. Not in the slightest.”
Tony jumped up and whirled around, dropping the gauntlet and the screwdriver he had been holding. “Jesus,” he mumbled, his voice all tight and hoarse. “You scared the shit out of me.”

“Stark showed you his lab and you didn’t look back, did you?”
Steve places a big hand on Tony’s thigh underneath the table. It feels like a brand.
you'd be," Steve said. Tony didn’t bother to hide the little gasps and moans Steve fucked out of him. He felt so full, like with each thrust, Steve breached his fucking stomach.
Steve pursed his lips. Peter was almost a man grown and still so small for his age.
It’s moments like these, when the music they put on to drown out the sound of their moans is too loud, and Steve is clutching at Tony’s hips like he’ll disappear into thin air if he doesn’t hold on, are when Tony wants to say, “I love you,” again.
Dugan forged on, ignoring Rumlow. “By the word of his prince.”
He should have known Bucky would pull some kind of stunt. Despite their friendship, there was little love between Bucky and Steve’s father.
“My apologies, sir,” JARVIS said dryly, or as dryly as an AI’s voice could be. “Would you like me to shout it next time?”
The courtesan stilled, his back going ramrod straight. His following words were cold and filled Steve with dread. “I see. I…suppose I would like to stay at an inn if this is what the next week of my life is to be like.” He turned to the door, and Steve didn’t even know his name to call him back.
“Will you be joining us today?” Dugan asked.
, against the dark cherry wood floors.
Not too long after Steve parked his motorcycle, he heard a familiar, yet obnoxious purr of a luxury car’s engine and out strolled Tony looking far too good for someone who had nearly died twice two weeks ago. Bruce hopped out of the passenger seat, giving him a light wave in greeting, looking like he was trying to make himself smaller.
There's still a part of Tony that thinks he doesn't deserve it, such utter devotion, such attraction (he won't
“No, I suppose I don’t, do I?” she mused, then paused before saying, “Brita. You may call me, Brita.”
And just like that, Tony’s witty retort died on the tip of his tongue. For four months, he had nearly successfully blocked out any and all thoughts of the tower and its occupants from his mind, instead choosing to throw himself into his work. Until now. Unwanted memories ambled through his mind. There had been food fights and movie nights and many other activities one would have expected a group of teenagers to partake in, not fully grown superheroes. Tony never would have expected Steve to engage in any of those aforementioned childish activities but hell, as Tony looked back, Steve was usually the one to initiate them. And Tony…he guessed he missed it. He missed Steve. And Bruce too. And little Dodger who had somehow burrowed his furry, floppy-eared backside into Tony’s heart.
Deadly silence then a one-word question filled with so much rage, Tony would have cowered had he not known that it wasn’t directed towards him. “
“Okay,” Tony drags out the round. “Now, are you going to answer me for real this time?”
“You ate without me? On date night?”
Being friends with Rhodey, Tony decides, is like lazing around in the sun after a storm.
On Steve’s 101st birthday, he awoke to a pair of lips. The lips were soft, pressing feather light pecks upon his collarbone, his cheeks, his forehead…
“SHIELD is going to continue their search on Earth, but I don’t know how any facial recognition software is going to help find a man who can change his appearance at will,” Clint said, crossing his arms in front of him.
“Why deny yourself pleasure?” Tony whispered against the shell of his ear.
“You have to let us go,” she whispered. “Let us go or you’ll never find peace, Steve.”
“What do you think?”
"Alright. We'll meet you back here, okay?"
“No,” Steve began, sitting directly across from Tony. “I didn’t break anything. And I don’t need upgrades or anything like that.” Steve bit his lip. “Think of it as an apology. And a peace offering.”
Ever the man with a plan, Steve pulls out the bottle of lube Tony barely remembered purchasing on their way here, he was so out of it. Steve makes quick work of preparing him, drizzling the lube over his fingers and over Tony’s already wet entrance. The lube is cool against Tony’s heated skin.
“How about you, Bruce?” Steve asked. “You thinking about staying?”
Their lips slotted together like two magnets, instantaneous and unbreakable. Steve wasted no time slipping his tongue into Tony’s mouth. Tony moaned, winding one of his hands into Steve’s hair. Two weeks. He had gone two weeks without feeling Steve’s skin against his, without smelling the woodsy scent of his body-wash. He could function without Steve’s kisses but that didn’t mean he

, Rhodes.”
Whatever peace they have following the carnival quickly dies when HYDRA rears its ugly head. Again. Tony hates how devoted they are to living up to their namesake. He had hoped that they would take their time to regroup after the fall of SHIELD, but apparently, four months was more than enough time. HYDRA's power ran that strong.
Okay, that fucking
“I didn’t mean to offend you,” Steve continued. “I’m sure you are fine company, and I would like…I would like to experience it for myself.”
“Steve!” Tony said, slapping him on the arm. “You’re such an asshole!”
Steve closes his eyes and leans down. Tony instinctively meets him halfway and rests his forehead against Steve’s. He wishes he could go inside Steve’s brain and find whatever part of it blamed itself and set it straight.
A golden suit piece came to him, attaching itself to his leg. Almost immediately, another piece flew over at rapid speed, nearly hitting Tony in the head as it embedded itself into one of the glass panes protecting his old suits. Another piece jetted towards him and Tony, raising a gauntleted hand, knock it aside into a nearby set of pipes. He winced. Pepper was not gonna be happy when she saw that.
"And you're not him," Tony replies. He leans his head against Steve's shoulder, sighing when he feels Steve press a kiss to the crown of his head.
“…Captain Rogers would agree with me.”
Rolling his eyes, he says, “Yeah, don’t get used to it.”
“How the hell do you have such a good poker face?” Tony had said after Steve had won three games in a row. The dining room lights glinted off a stray fleck of glitter in his beard.
Tony had him, hook, line, and sinker. "Well how would you feel if your wonderful, amazing, ridiculously hot boyfriend came back after a life-endangering mission and only wanted to focus on paperwork," Tony said.
“I know,” Steve crooned. “I’m gonna make it better. Gonna make you feel alive.”
“Then Loki using his magic would be like him leaving his DNA all over the place,” Clint finished.
The rest of the party had resumed their conversations, trying not to seem like they had been eavesdropping.
She was waiting for him.

It's no great shock to him, not really. There's no fireworks, no lightning strikes, just a subtle shift in his paradigm, like someone zooming out on a camera.
“Really.”
“Okay,” Tony said.
“You look like you should still be in middle school,” Rhodey had said dryly, tossing his dufflebag onto the bed the opposite of Tony’s. “What are you, like twelve?”
“A fine name,” Steve stated. Tony looked up, meeting Steve’s gaze once more. He flushed, suddenly aware of how close they stood, and found himself backing away from the other man. Floundering for something to distract Tony from his awkwardness, he gestured to his table.
at the fact that
“And I may or may not have had a quick bite…I didn’t know if you were coming home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.”
Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck. “And I’m perfectly fine with that.” Before Tony even knew what was happening, Steve had spun his chair around to face him and pulled Tony into his lap. Tony yelped at the sudden movement, his hands automatically flying to Steve’s chest to brace himself. “Steve!”
Steve pulled him into a hug, burrowing his face into Bucky's long hair.
“You’d like that wouldn’t you? Sitting under my desk all day doing what you do best; warming my cock.” Steve said, his voice little more than a rasp at this point. His words had dark chills going through Tony as if someone had poured ice water down his back.
“And what do you want?” Tony whispered, that familiar thread of tension coiling in his groin. Judging by the bulge he can feel even through the thick layers of the stealth suit, fuck, Tony had a good idea of what Steve wanted, but he still wanted to hear him say it.
It wasn’t until one night, when he, Tony, Bruce, and Rhodey had been playing a simple game of cards, did Steve acknowledge that there
It’s not that he doesn’t trust her, per se, but he knows where her loyalties lie. If she got one glimpse of what he was really working on, she’d go running back to Fury like a good little agent. He knew how Fury operated now; Hill was here to help just as much as she was here to spy.
“That’s it,” Steve says.
“Relax, Happy,” Tony said.
“I believe Captain Rogers is suffering from a panic attack,” JARVIS replied.
“It’s not superhero business, I get it,” Tony finished blandly. His hand shook as his grip on the crayon tightened. It was
“Are you sure? Survivor’s guilt. Panic attacks. Avoidance. That all sounds relatable to me,” she said, sipping primly at her tea. “Just because you came about your trauma in a more unique way than others doesn’t make it any more or less valid.”
"I'm not sorry," Steve says softly. He runs a finger over one of the bruises he left behind on Tony's collarbone, presses a feather-soft kiss there. He does the same to the hickey on Tony's neck and the bruises on his hips and works his way back up to Tony's lips. Steve tastes like salt as Tony moans into his mouth. His cock gives a half-hearted twitch at the thought of one more round with Steve, but another orgasm might actually send him into cardiac arrest.
“Banner’s got a point,” Romanov says. “I want him to pay, just as much as you,” she admits. “But how would we even go about punishing a
Steve guided the head of his cock to Tony’s mouth. Tony placed a soft kiss on the head, licking lightly at the pre-come that had gathered there, making Steve hiss between his teeth. Steve’s pre-come was salty but not unpleasant. Tony wrapped his hand around Steve’s on his cock. He felt hard enough to cut diamonds in Tony’s hands and that submissive part of Tony
"He won't be king forever," Tony murmured, jolting Steve out of his thoughts.
,” he thinks with more than a little vindictiveness. Underneath the baseball cap, Tony can see the tufts of hair visible have been dyed a rich dark brown. Even though his eyes are shrouded by a pair of dark sunglasses, Tony knows that behind them lie a devastating pair of eyes blue like the Pacific Ocean at sunrise. Tony would know.
The bright blue glow of the arc reactor illuminated the hollows of Tony’s face. Tony’s unstyled hair, fell into his doe brown eyes that shone with unshed tears. Tony hadn’t even shaved, his usual neat goatee fuller and unkempt at the edges. “You think so? You think there’s a chance?”
Tony's lips part when Steve takes him into his hand, a soft gasp escaping them as he spreads the wetness of his pre-come along his cock. Heat pools low in his belly, and Tony finds himself spreading his legs wider, baring himself for Steve to use however he pleases.
“I’m just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell them to go out for a drink or something.”
Pepper was hyperventilating, her hands cradling her head.
"The sins of the father shouldn't fall upon the son," he says. "Howard wasn't daddy dearest, either."
"That's the one," he says, some of his initial anxiety ebbing away. They weren't saying no. Not yet. Or maybe they were just trying to let him down gently.
"And that doesn't worry you?"

“Right, right, exactly,” Happy said.
This was Steve’s life now. And he was thankful for the small moment of peace, no matter how brief it would be. It may have only been 2012, but Steve knew something much bigger than any of them could comprehend was coming. And he would be ready. He would have to be.
“You were fresh out the ice, Steve. I figured the last thing you needed on your plate was something like
It'd look weird if he takes too long to answer, so Tony says, "Yeah. Sounds like a plan."
"You know you love me, Platypus."
"He surely acts as if he will live forever," Steve said. "I'll be gray and toothless by the time I'm crowned."
“Okay,” Pepper said, taking a seat in an armchair and began to unbuckle her heels.
"Jesus Christ," Clint says under his breath. "She almost took him out."

“That’s not a no.”
space, and despite living with them for months on end now, Tony still needs his space. Even Steve never tried to enter the sanctity of his workshop. Steve.
“Of course.” With a wave of her hand, the cup instantly refilled itself, lemon and all.
“Of course you don’t. He’s not a blond with a big rack,” Happy quipped. “At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it’s like getting weird. He’s showing her a big brain.”
Steve held up his hands. “I’ll think about it. Just…let me figure this out for myself, okay?”
He’s not sure if it’s the knowledge of his forthcoming demise or something else, something more potent than he’s ever felt in his life, but she’s never looked more beautiful and the urge to say or do something has never been stronger.
Steve is only a little in love with him. In a friendly way.

“How did you—”
Tony’s eyes widen. “What’s that?”

," Steve's voice cracks. "I saw you fall, and I couldn't do a damn thing to stop it."
"You're not him," Steve says immediately. Tony knows it's not an insult.
“You’ve done it before,” Tony points out. “Look, I didn’t mean to snap, but,” he reaches for Steve’s hand, and Steve thankfully lets him take it. “We’re a team. Aren’t we?”

Before they can make it to Tony’s penthouse suite, Natasha ends up calling a meeting.

“A shame. An absolute travesty,” Tony said seriously. “
“Dogs are easier to take care of than humans,” Clint had replied, cuddling his pup close to him. Tony had just face palmed and waved Clint away.
it. "Don't tell her I said that."
Steve's hands are on Tony's waist, and he's shot back to the first time they stood like this, close enough to catch each other's breath. That first time had been an exploration—an adventure in learning each other's bodies.
“Does that answer your question, Tony?” Bruce muttered.
Steve’s cock was thick and heavy in his mouth and to his surprise, Tony could feel his own cock stirring again all hot and slick with come. Tony took Steve down slowly, his throat relaxing with a practiced ease until the head of Steve’s cock prodded at his throat.
Tony clears his throat, and Carmen looks up, her big brown eyes going wide before a grin breaks across her face and—
"Aw," Tony says. "It has wings on its helmet too."
"Oh, really?" Steve asks, bracing his arms on either side of Tony's head. "We're gonna pretend you weren't begging for it, huh?"
As soon as he speaks, Thor comes back into the command center, his face grave. "There's something you should see."
Italy is lovely, but Tony is so lonely. He’s never been good by himself.
“I was just trying to return the favor,” Tony had said, covered head to toe in flour and eggs. “Honestly, even I have no idea how I screwed up this badly.” Instead, Steve had just laughed until his stomach ached, ordered a pizza (Brooklyn style of course, Steve wasn’t a heathen), and settled down to watch a movie with Tony. Tony had pushed for
That feeling of anxiety was still there and perhaps it would never truly go away but AJ’s words would ring in his mind. “You are more than your trauma,” and “You deserve to be happy,” were constant mantras of his these days. He wasn’t healed completely, not by a long-shot. He still had bad days where he could barely drag himself out of bed. He had days where the guilt and the pain would well up inside of him and nearly made him choke but he was
had to show up early and ruin everything.”
And with that, Steve truly began to fuck Tony’s mouth. Tony relaxed his throat, breathing through his nose with ease as Steve settled into a brisk, brutal rhythm. Having already gotten Tony off, Steve only sought to seek his own pleasure, his cock plunging in and out of Tony’s mouth roughly. God, the
He had spent many summers there as a boy, with his easel and his charcoal, sketching to his heart's content. He would do no sketching today.
Rhodey stays and Tony loves him for it. And for the first time in a long time, Tony wants to cook.
"What did you think I was going to be like?"
“Hey, soldier?” Tony asked, stepping into the kitchen while looking down at his phone. “What do you think about
tonight—” he came to a halt when he finally looked up from his phone and saw the stricken look upon Steve’s face. “Cap?”
Bucky sauntered out of Steve’s chambers, briefly locking eyes with the man Steve was to be saddled with for a week. Their eyes lingered on each other, roaming each other up and down. The wave of bitterness at the sight crept upon him like a thief, surprising him with its intensity. He had the strangest feeling that the two were communicating an important message to each other. But what could a nobleman and a courtesan have to say to each other that
Rhodey’s lips quirk up ever so slightly into a smile, and then he’s gone, plunging Tony’s workshop into near silence. He finds himself looking forward to Rhodey's leave. It’ll be good to see him, take his mind off of everything.
He wants Steve to tie him down like he promised once and leave more bruises and bites, leave his
If Steve closed his eyes he could pretend. He could pretend that the boat they had pushed off the shore didn't carry a body, that the taste of dust and ash still didn't coat his tongue, that Tony was
Tony closes his eyes and does as he's told. Some of the tension leaves his body as Steve's voice washes over him.
“Yeah, there’s a giant brain, there’s a shifty character.” Happy shifted in his seat. “I’m gonna follow this guy. I’m gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.”
Steve’s head was beginning to hurt. His younger self’s conscience had disappeared entirely along with his future body…did he kill himself?
school and they’d all come oohing and ahhing before the day was over. Tony had closed his eyes and waited for the gasps and the questions and the sucking up-
At first, all he saw was the familiar round face of his guard, Robb, and wondered what he could possibly want this late.
“Your Midgardian traditions are so strange,” Thor says. “Interesting, but strange.”
3. I'm sure most of us have seen Iron Man 3 but I'm still going to do trigger warnings for Tony's anxiety attacks. In this chapter, the first one begins at
“Jesus, Nat,” he said. “We already have people trying to kill us regularly,
Nothing happened.
“She thought she was getting help,” Clint says so quietly, Tony thinks he might have misheard him. “And they slaughtered her. Like a dog.”
Whatever pain Rumlow had inflicted upon that poor girl had been given to him tenfold. His injuries had healed eventually. All aside from the raised scar in the shape of a spider emblazoned across his cheek. Rumlow never said outright who had done him in, but the spider made it all too obvious; it was Madam Natalia’s sigil. King Joseph had been furious, but without Rumlow's cooperation, he couldn’t persecute Brooke’s most well-respected brothel owner unless he wanted a revolt led by all of the menfolk in the capital out calling for his head.
,” he had spat like a snake shooting its venom.
Frowning, Steve entered in his override code and braced himself for whatever he was about to see.
Steve had an awful, nauseating feeling that if he were to reach out to the left of him, his hands would come into contact with the hilt of Loki’s scepter.
“What’s going on? Fill me in,” he said, picking up the bottle of Pinot Noir. Tony’s eyes read the label quickly; it had notes of blackberry, raspberry and was that—he squinted—that was strawberry. As in the one berry Pepper was severely allergic to. Date night was already off to a
“By all means,” Steve groaned, one big hand resting on Tony’s head.
“And what are those rules?”
Steve nods. "Easy enough."
"They'll be on their best behavior," Steve says. "Thor said he'll keep an eye on Bruce, and I know for a fact that wherever Clint goes, Natasha's gonna follow and vice versa."
was working just fine. Perhaps
“She’s been halting,” Steve had said, refusing to look Tony in the eyes. It was hard to ever since the incident at dinner. He knew the others didn’t fault him, but he couldn’t help but be embarrassed.
“Think I might take a page out of Barton's book. Settle down and build Pepper a farm,” Tony had said with a false grin.
At first nothing seemed off. Tony was hunched over his work desk fiddling with his gauntlet. Usually DUM-E would be sat right next to him, but the bot had rolled himself into a corner on the opposite side of the room. A half empty bottle of Jack Daniel’s sat on the table beside Tony.
And now his home was nowhere to be found. It had been completely and utterly decimated and putting it back together would be like trying to fit a million shards of glass back into a picture frame.
“Quite,” Tony finally says. “Not all of us have super healing abilities, Captain.”
“Knock yourself out,” he said, holding back a grin. Tony had asked him the exact same thing the first time around. He just couldn’t hold himself back around any nice machinery, and if that had been exactly why Steve decided to take his bike today, then who was going to judge him?
They’re annoying, Tony thinks. They’re annoying and loud and destructive and—
“The Accords were wrong,” Steve says, a muscle in his jaw working and Tony wants to slap him. The only thing keeping him from backhanding the other man is the risk of breaking something. He should slap him anyway.
He didn’t want to look. Because if he looked, and Natasha wasn’t there, Steve wasn’t sure what he would do with himself.
His mind went back to his earlier thought. Maybe he was dead and this was Hell and he was going to be forced to watch everyone he loved die over, and over, and
Steve was the first to arrive and he couldn’t help chuckling to himself. It seemed like even in this timeline, some things were never going to change.
end up having apple torte for dessert. As Jarvis tucks him into his bed, the smell of green apples and cinnamon linger on the air. That night, Tony dreams of hundreds of apple tortes falling from the sky. He thinks they
Rhodey's mouth closes, and Tony can practically see the cogs in his head turning, coming to the same conclusion he had reached.
Tony wasn’t worried. Really. The giant bunny waiting in the roundabout for Pepper wasn’t an impulse buy and actually something he’d had in the works for a while. And he had managed to make dinner without burning himself or the house down, and the salmon had ended up being pretty damn delicious if he did say so himself. Now, he was just burning off restless energy in the workshop. Mark 42 was upstairs with Tony remote piloting the suit. This way he could still be a good boyfriend (and host) to Pepper while also getting in a nice workout.
“Nailed it, right?”
Tony supposes that their day has come to an end; The sun has gone out of sight, the edges of the sky tinged with a thousand shades of pink, orange, and violet. They should eat dinner, and Tony needs to gather up everyone's armor and weaponry for some much needed updates and—
“I can’t! I don’t know how to flip the screen! And don’t talk to me like that anymore. You’re not my boss.”
"A promise, then," Tony states. "A pact. We protect each other. We take care of each other."
I hope I did Tony and Steve's first meeting justice and that you guys enjoyed yourselves with this one. Don't fret though, because there's more to come. Comments, kudos, and bookmarks aren't necessary but they're much appreciated. See y'all next time! ✌💖
Dugan shrugged. “Never been one for titles. Not all of us are little lords. I was a blacksmith’s apprentice before I was knighted.”
“Aren’t you glad you chose me over work?”
The party truly starts when Natasha lands the quinjet. Bruce emerges, already going green, and it's through him that they're able to bust down the doors and breach the base.
The muscles in his thighs trembled with the effort of straddling Steve for so long. He made to get up and fetch a towel, but Steve continued to hold him tight. Tony wriggled in his grasp.
He doesn't know how long they've been in the shower, but the water is starting to run cold, which is a feat within itself. Steve swallows around him, and Tony's coming down his throat with a shout. Steve moans around him, not letting up on him for a second until Tony has to physically push him away. He's never come so hard in his life and never within such a short period of time in between.
. They're blank slates before society, or their parents or both screw them over, and looking at their fanart makes Tony dislike most humans a little less. It reminds him of why he fights. At the end of the day, putting on the suit isn't about saving his own life, or the glory of it all, or even atoning for his past mistakes. It's about making sure that those kids who had enough kindness in their heart to spare a kind word and some art to a virtual stranger still have a world to live in the next day. Not that anybody would believe Tony.
Steve let his feet go wherever they wanted, thankful to be away from the others, if only for a moment. He could only withstand their boasting for so long. Was that to be his lot in life? A slave to traditions, to propriety? Having his every move be under scrutiny? Sometimes...sometimes he longed for a different life. A simpler one, where he spent his days capturing the dreamscapes of his mind on canvas. Had he a younger sibling, he would have gladly abdicated the throne.
Steve set a slow, even pace, letting Tony reacclimate to the sheer length of him.
Steve heard the hunting party before he could see them, their voices rising over birdsongs.
“Why?”
“Please, call me Steve.”
Steve. Rivals? Or was that too petty? Just what the hell
and ends at
"Motherfucker," Rhodey swears for the umpteenth time.
Mark 42 shrugged. “It could’ve been a cool Christmas present. Also, speaking of Christmas presents, did you see yours?”
"I know," Tony says, and the next few moments are naught but a blur. They kiss again and make their way to Tony's bedroom, occasionally stopping to feel each other up or get rid of a piece of clothing. When they finally make it to Tony's bedroom, they're both down to their boxers.
Tony deliberately avoids mentioning Siberia. There’s only so much rage within him that he’s willing to show. How no one has taken any notice of them is beyond Tony’s comprehension as by the end of his speech, he’s struggling to keep himself from shouting.
, that no one would mention Tony in front of him, so of course, the exact opposite happened. When had the gods ever answered any of
“A giant brain?” Tony asked, slightly more worried now.
Shaking her head, Pepper said, “I’m going to bed.”
“Spangles, what the hell are you doing?” Tony yelped when Steve bodily picked him up and tossed him over his shoulder as if he weighed nothing.
“You’re welcome. How often do you get to eat?”
She flips her hair over her shoulder.
, he thought,
," and "Stay with me."
"I think you annoyed Mom," Natasha whispers, and really, for a spy, she sucks at being quiet.
Rhodey stays. Rhodey stays and Tony flourishes under his attention like a long forgotten toy finally being picked up and played with again. He stays when Tony takes too long getting ready in the morning.
"Remember, you have to return the stones at the exact moment you got them," Bruce said. "Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities." His green visage still took some getting used to. It was startling to hear full, comprehensible sentences come out of the Hulk's mouth but Bruce finally seemed at ease with himself and really, that's all Steve could ask for him. That's all he could ask for any of his teammates. For them to have peace.
“Aw, I doubt that,” Rhodey had said. “I’m tougher than I look.”
“I said no, JARVIS!”
He speaks without thinking, something you'd think wouldn't happen so often to a literal genius. "Steve's been...Steve's been good."
“You and Pepper got into a fight? Over what?”
"Lucky for you," Tony hummed, "I forgive easily."
Natasha and Clint tie in Shoot 'em Up. Since Tony is on a team that consists entirely of children, they extend their competition to every booth in the carnival. Steve warms up as the day goes on, even joining in on their little competition along with Thor. Tony and Bruce are just content to watch.
Well, Steve had never been one for traditions anyway.
America, says, "Who the fuck needs a god when I have you?"
“How does an apprentice become a knight?” Tony asked.
“I don’t see why not.”
were the subject of far out comic books.
“Gladly,” Tony said, reaching out for his plate.
Tony clears his throat, catching Steve’s attention.
A second finger joins the first, stretching Tony to the point of discomfort. In the back of his mind, Tony had always
Steve unwinds the bandages around his hands, conveniently avoiding Tony’s gaze when he says, “I’ve been busy.”
It’s like someone poured ice water down his back. He had been hoping,
Tony tested the handle of Steve’s door. It twisted in his grasp, meaning he had left it unlocked. That was a good sign. If Steve truly didn’t want Tony to bother him, he would have locked the door.
