“You know, you're acting really weird,” Sam persists, gesturing with his plastic fork. “If you're hooking up with Jo, you can tell me, Dean. I know she's into you.”
“Yeah… um, you see, Bobby and I have a theory about that too,” Sam replies, pulling a face. “Turns out all three victims shared a certain, uh, personality type. Frank was a bully. The other two victims, one was a vice principal, the other was a bouncer.”
“Yeah, with me. If you wanna,” Dean affirms, feet shuffling just a little.
There’s a beat of quiet before Sam speaks again. “So, what, are you gay?” he asks a little stiffly.
“Nah, is Ash around?”
“Life threatening situation, you know, near death experience-- that’s scary,” Sam explains, his blue eyes widening a little. “Can you think of anyone who’s had a scary experience recently? Can you think of anyone who, I dunno, might have spent a summer in hell recently?”
FLASHBACK SHOT TO THE FIRST TIME HE LAID EYES ON THE ANGEL WHO GRIPPED HIM TIGHT AND RAISED HIM FROM PERDITION, CASTIEL. HE HAS BEDHEAD, A TRENCH COAT, AND A BACKWARDS TIE. HIS BLUE EYES ARE SOLEMN BUT ALSO WEIRDLY INNOCENT. WE SEE THE LIGHT FLASH, AND THE SHADOW OF HIS ANGEL WINGS SPLASHES ACROSS THE SPRAY PAINTED WALL BEHIND HIM.
“What do you mean, you’ll be back?”
“Leave or we kill you,” Sam says to Ruby in a quiet, dangerous voice.
“Right.”
He watches Sam head into the motel. Disappear behind the door.
Dean shrugs. He makes an “I dunno” shrug sound.
A surprised grin paints itself over Dean’s mouth, and his shoulders fall a little. “Yeah? Awesome.”
FADE OUT AS THEY CLOSE THEIR DOORS. ROLL CREDITS.
“That's right,” Dean confirms, markedly not wiping the glob of ketchup off his face.
“Symptoms are, you get anxious, then scared, then really scared, then your heart gives out,” Sam continues. “Sound familiar?”
“Well, look at you.” Dean half shakes his head. “Love ‘em and leave ‘em.”
“Cracking,” Dean repeats, half scoffing, a tear rolling down his face. He shakes his head. “I tortured people. Whoever they put in front of me. No matter how many people I save, I can't change that. I can't fill this hole. Not ever.”
“And why's that, praytell?”
“I was hooking up with someone,” he says. “Don’t worry about it. So-- whatcha got about this case?”
“I mean I’ll be back.” He reaches for the gear shift as if to punctuate his point, nudging it out of park and into drive.
THE SCENE CONTINUES. THE BOYS DISCUSS THEIR CURRENT CASE. THE COMPUTER STAYS ON THE BED, NOTABLY IN THE WAY THE WHOLE SCENE. THE CAMERA OCCASIONALLY CATCHES ON IT.
“Yeah, you're right. I wasn't like them. I was worse.”
the final seal.”
“I heard,” Ash replies with a slow nod.
Dean gives a sort of half chuckle. “Can’t get rid of me that easy. Least not for a year.”
“You’re too late,” Ruby says, her dark eyebrows knit together.
“I’ll buy you a drink first,” Ash says, dropping the screwdriver he’d been holding. He comes up to Dean, sets his hand on Dean’s shoulder, and leads him back into the bar.
SAM APOLOGIZES TO DEAN. THE BLOOD SIGIL ON THE FLOOR COMPLETES, OPENING UP TO A BEAM OF WHITE LIGHT. SAM LOOKS HORRIFIED; DEAN’S FACE IS WRITTEN IN DREAD. THEY EACH TAKE A HANDFUL OF THE OTHER’S JACKET. WITH A FEW WORDS, THEY RUSH OUT. ROLL CREDITS.
FADE OUT. ROLL TITLE CARD. FADE INTO THE ORIGINAL MOTEL. SAM IS SITTING AT THE DESK, HIS LAPTOP OPEN. IT’S THE NEXT MORNING. DEAN ENTERS.
“With you?” Ash asks, eyebrows lifting a little, clearly in surprise.
“Sam,” she says, almost whispering. She shakes her head. “You… you opened the door. He’s free.”
“In the back.”
He gets out of the car. He drops the keys into his jacket pocket, an unusual spring in his step. He rubs at the back of his neck before letting himself in.
“Don’t hurt yourself, Sammy. It’s not going to work. You blew your payload on the boss.”
“Hey, Ellen,” he says.
Dean almost chokes on a sip of his pop. “I'm not sleeping with Jo, Sammy.”
“Fine,” Sam exhales. “Yeah. Whatever. Uh, anyway, Dean... look, you know I didn't mean the things I said back there, right? That it was just the siren's spell talking?”
“Dean,” Sam says gently, the compassion pulling back over his features, reminding the audience that he really does care-- “you lasted thirty years. That’s as long as you’ve been alive. Nobody could ever blame you for cracking after your entire lifetime.”
“I didn’t want this!” She shouts back. “They cut me off! All of them! I’m marked a traitor, Sam, how am I supposed to know anything? Trust me, I’m just as surprised as you are.”
INT SHOT - CHURCH. SAM KILLS LILITH. WE WATCH HER VESSEL CRUMBLE TO THE FLOOR, BLEEDING OUT IN AN UNSETTLING STREAM OF DARK LIQUID. THE CAMERA SHIFTS, AND SAM STEPS INTO THE FRAME. THEN RUBY.
“Well, why me?” Dean asks, messing with his arm again. He glances down at it before continuing his question. “Why not you? I mean, you got hit with the spleen juice.”
Dean kind of scoffs. “No. I’m not gay. I love chicks, you know I love chicks. Do we really have to have this conversation, Sam?”
“No,” she insists, shaking her head, taking a step toward him. “I was trying to help you, Sam. I just wanted to help you.”
“You hooked up with a
“I wanted to
“Yeah, fine,” Sam says with an uneasy lightness.

SEASON 4, EPISODE 22, “LUCIFER RISING”. FINAL SCENE.
He glances over his shoulder as he goes. Ellen goes back to wiping down the bar, but he thinks he can feel her eyes on him anyway.
SEASON 3, EPISODE I DON’T KNOW, SCENE IN THE EARLY MIDDLE OF THE EPISODE
“So the theory Bobby and I came up with, it’s a little more complicated than just the victims using fear to get what they want. It looks like as long as fear plays a big role in your life, or even if you had a temporary experience with it in the recent past, you’re vulnerable.”
“What’s it matter?” Dean asks gruffly, rubbing at his mouth sloppily, eyes pointed downward.
“Did you really hook up with him, Dean? What, was he a hot chick until the stroke of midnight?” The words sound like a joke, but Sam’s tone does not.
He shakes his head again, rubbing at his face with both his hands. You can hear Dean banging on the door. In his anger, Sam reaches both hands into the air, and tries to exercise Ruby. It’s fruitless.
“Our very own outbreak monkey,” Dean remarks uncomfortably.
“Into dudes? Hell, yeah. Why?”
Dean nods, exhaling. “Well, that’s frickin’ super,” he huffs, the sarcasm thick.
“‘Kay. So… we’re good?” Sam asks.
Dean’s shoulders relax. He turns to face his brother again. “I’m all ears.”
“I can’t believe it,” Ruby says. She looks frightened, unsettled, uncertain. Slowly, she walks toward Lilith’s body.
EXT SHOT - IT’S MID AFTERNOON, CLEAR SKIES. THE BOYS ARE LEANING AGAINST THE IMPALA, WHICH IS PARKED OUTSIDE THE CITY. BOBBY IS REACHING INTO HIS CAR. HE COMES TOWARD THEM, HANDING THEM DRINKS IN GLASS BOTTLES.
“Yeah. We’re good.”
“You gonna tell me anything about what you were doing?”
FADE IN. INT SHOT, DEAN IS SITTING IN A MOTEL ROOM ALONE, SAM’S COMPUTER ON HIS LAP. HE’S TYPING SOMETHING INTO THE SEARCH BAR.
“Ruby? What’s going on?”
, Ruby, how the fuck do you expect me to believe you didn’t know? That this wasn’t your plan all along?”
“You were gone all night.”
“Nah,” Dean says easily. He drops his duffel back on the unmade bed.
“You gonna sit there all day?” his brother chides.
“More like twenty-four,” Sam corrects.
“You didn’t know?” Sam demands. “You’re a
The boys both nod.
“Yeah.”
“You boys are drivin’, ain’t ya?” Bobby asks.
“Castiel,” Dean whispers, barely a whisper, barely audible. He’s trying the name out. Feeling the way it rolls off his tongue. He blinks. Pulls air into his lungs. Glances toward his sleeping brother in the dark.
FADE IN. EXT SHOT OF A NONDESCRIPT SMALL TOWN. BOYS IN THE CAR.
Sam accepts his with a heavy exhale. “Thanks.”
“Nah,” he says. “You get a room. I’ll be back.”
“Hey yourself. Get you a drink?” She offers warmly.
Dean is quiet for a moment before replying, his green eyes pensive. He blinks. “Yeah, you could say that,” he half chuckles. “But I don't wanna dwell on the unpleasant shit that goes on in my sorry life. You wanna get this party going?”
EXT SHOT - DEAN PARKS THE IMPALA UNDER A RURAL OVERPASS, AND THE BOYS GET OUT. SAM COMES AROUND TO THE DRIVERS’ SIDE WITH A BAG OF FAST FOOD BURGERS. IT’S SLIGHTLY OVERCAST, A LITTLE GREY AND FOGGY. IT LOOKS COLD. A LIGHT BREEZE RUFFLES THE GREYING FOLIAGE AT THE BOYS’ FEET. SAM HANDS DEAN A BURGER. HE UNWRAPS IT SLOWLY BEFORE CLOSING IT BACK UP AND SETTING IT ASIDE. THIS CATCHES SAM’S ATTENTION-- THIS IS UTTERLY UNLIKE DEAN. DEAN’S EYES ARE TURNED DOWNWARD AS SAM GIVES HIM A ONCE OVER.
“What’s the point?”
CUT FROM DEAN’S TEAR-LADEN FACE TO SAM’S SYMPATHETIC FACE. THERE IS A MOMENT OF QUIET. A SENSE THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE. PAN BACK TO A WIDE SHOT, THE BOYS AND THE CAR, THE UNIT THAT MAKES UP THE HEART OF THE SHOW. ROLL CREDITS.
THE SCENE CONTINUES. SAM ALLOWS DEAN TO BRUSH IT OFF. THEY DISCUSS THE CASE.
“What? No, he-- Lilith, I stopped her, I killed her,” Sam insists, voice growing frantic.
FADE TO BLACK. ROLL CREDITS.
“You, uh, you wanna hook up?”
“What the hell?” Sam asks softly.
SEASON 3, EPISODE 1. SCENE 1. “THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN”.
“Alright,” Sam says after a hanging quiet.
When Dean answers, there’s a weird, airy lightness to his voice. Like he’s trying to hold onto something, digging his nails into it, desperately pretending to actually be in the aloof mindset he’s trying to portray. “You know, I felt for those sons of bitches back there. Lifelong torture turns you into something like that.”
Ruby shakes her head again. “We made a mistake. We were wrong. I-- I thought-- fuck. I can feel it.”
Ash stands up, wandering toward the light switch with a bit of a tipsy hitch in his step. The lights go off, and by the feeble light of the TV, you can see Ash sit back down on the bed and lean toward Dean, who is now shirtless. The scene fades to black as Dean’s hands find their way around Ash's back.
“Jesus,” Dean says, blinking. “What does that have to do with anything?”
Sam lets himself into the room, and Dean quickly closes out of the window he had open. As he does this, from over his shoulder, the camera picks up a brief but telling shot of what he was looking at; a gay porn website called asslesschapsxxx.com. Once it’s closed, he slams the computer shut, clearing his throat. His reaction condemns himself.
“Of course, me too,” Dean says quickly. His words don’t pierce through the twofold tension between them.
“And in that, uh--” Dean clears his throat, his eyes shifty, his hands uncertain. “In that vein, I was gonna ask-- you into dudes?”
“Cut it out, Sam,” Bobby intervenes. “Who a man sleeps with is nobody’s business but his own. Ain’t you got more important stuff to worry yourself about?”
Sam shrugs, sipping his drink again, dropping it. Dean’s eyes are still pointed downward.
Sam makes a face like ‘ugh, here we go again’, and the moment of compassion we saw from him comfortably melts away. For a moment, it feels like the status quo is restored; Dean with his boundless self hatred, his chronic broken heart; Sam with his onward and upward attitude, his logical and frigid demeanor. But then Dean continues speaking.
Gabe melted against his lover, kissing him sweetly, the fire of his heat no longer a burning pain, but the warmth of a fireplace, welcoming and bringing the scent of home. Gabe shifted over Sam, and slowly, achingly slowly, took Sam into himself. They breathed into each other a moment, each kiss an affirmation, their bodies barely moving. Gabe drew back slightly, staring at Sam with whiskey eyes blown nearly black with lust, but with adoration shining through clearly. He rolled his hips slightly, letting that slow rocking motion move them both, before twisting in a slow figure eight with each pass, feeling Sam's cock filling him completely, brushing against every inch in exquisite friction. Sam watched him intently, his powerful hands resting lightly on Gabe's hips, both of them knowing he could take over at any moment, overpowering the Omega riding him to take control. He kept his hands relaxed, but the flash of Alpha red in his eyes made Gabe smirk.
Dean pushed back on Cas’ shoulder until Cas rolled onto his back, then he proceeded to kiss his way lightly down Cas’ chest. Slipping the sleep pants down over his lover’s hips, he spent a few minutes worshipping at the altar of his body, namely the hip bones sharp enough to cut glass. When Cas was moaning beneath him Dean moved to the other, marking it with his teeth and lips, leaving a dark bruise in the hollow above it. He glanced down and saw Cas was half-hard already, and he crawled up his lover’s body to kiss him softly.
"Mmm, oh fuck, Cas!" Dean gasped, canting his hips and chasing the press of that finger against his hole. "Need you, sweetheart!"
“My Omega,” Sam said quietly, but in an iron tone. “You shouldn't have run. I could have hurt you.”
He yelped as Cas startled, tugging on the knot slightly, then his Alpha was sniffing at his neck and Dean knew what he was trying to convey.
“You’re going to be good for me, aren’t you my little Omega? You’re going to take your punishment, and you’re going to thank me for it, aren’t you?”
“Named for the angel of Thursday,” Cas responded to the unspoken question. “My parents named all of us for angels.”
"Get a room!" Sammy shouted from across the basement, and Cas broke into a low chuckle, his eyes luminous as he stared at Dean from mere inches away. Dean hauled Cas, unprotesting, to his feet and fumbled in his pocket for his keys.
Dean had little recollection of leaving the diner, simply dropped a few twenties on the table without asking for the cheque, and was dragged out by Cas. More long, slow kisses against Baby's side, Cas capturing his lips and staking claim to his mouth.
“And yet, she's calling, rather than texting,” Jo remarked, with a gleeful look. “I'd answer that, her Majesty is not patient.”
“Eat, Gabe,” Sam instructed gruffly, caressing his hands down Gabe's sides. Gabe whined at him, trying to shift his hips, but Sam clamped his large hands around his waist, and held him still. “Eat first.”
“I've seen you, but I don't know where. You had blockers on…” Cas examined the man in puzzlement, then snapped his fingers. “Dr. Bad-Ass Security Systems, right? Love the work you did at Milton's. Even the threat of the cameras you installed helped me ban a major problem assbutt last night.”
“Dean Winchester, how dare you not tell me?!”
“Cas covered it all,” she soothed, giving him a wink. Beside her, Jo nodded, her face giving away just what she thought about the situation. Charlie threw an arm around Jo’s shoulders and looked up. “Hey Cas, gonna show off your parlour trick?” she asked, her eyes full of delighted mischief.
“Upstairs, Baby,” Cas whispered. “I’ll get you out of your vest, and then I’m gonna fuck you into the mattress, how’s that sound?”
The was a blur of motion, and suddenly Dean’s arms were wrapped around his neck, his face pressed to his ruff as he shook. Cas couldn’t scent any tears, it was simply his Omega letting his fear and nerves have free rein for a minute. When finally he settled, he pulled back to look at Cas, and Cas sent a clear invitation.
“Zachariah Adler, lackey and bootlicker to one Dick Roman who happens to be the property owner for the establishment my brothers and I own. We own the building, but he owns the land. It’s a complicated contract and we're trying to figure out how to buy him out, so rocking the boat sucks. But there it is.”
“You do,” Dean murmured, tapping lightly at his own mating bite, his green eyes flashing golden as Cas felt his Alpha surging to the surface.
and he blanched. “I haven't told Charlie,” he said calmly. He certainly didn't whimper.
Dean wailed, his cock throbbing as he came, his hole tightening around his mate’s cock. Still Cas pounded into him. He stroked Dean through the last pulses of his release, groaning against his throat as he thrust, and Dean hit the release on the cuffs, bracing himself with one hand as he reached back with the other to tangle his fingers in Cas’ hair, holding him against his throat.
"Here you go, Mildred, six red roses," Charlie said cheerfully, and Dean scooted back from the counter so she could ring up the customer. Wincing as he stood, he walked around the counter and to Cas' side, where he stood sheepishly, running his fingers through his hair. Cas watched him searchingly, but the moment was gone, and Dean didn't know how, or if he should try to reclaim it.
” Gabriel demanded.
"Get your clothes off, angel." Cas tensed at the endearment, and Dean shook his head. "You're always gonna be my angel, Cas."
Cas nuzzled gently at the nape of his neck and reached around to his chest to undo the clasps on the vest. “Mmmm?”
"Are you going to kiss me?" Dean murmured quietly, ignoring the catcalls from their friends.
Cas' lips meanwhile, were trailing along Dean's jaw and working their way to his earlobe. "Mmmm?" he replied with a soft, distracted noise.
Cas growled against his throat, the scent of his arousal spiking around them, and the firm length of his cock apparent against Dean's ass.
“You're my Alpha, and my True Mate. You would never really hurt me,” Gabe sighed happily, nuzzling at his neck. “But you need to trim your nails, Samsquatch. How long until Cassie is here? Hmm, good thing Dean has a key, I don't think ten minutes will be enough for your knot to go down.”
Dean felt his cheeks flush and gave a shaky laugh. “You’ve seen my place…”

Yell at me here, or on tumblr at Imbiowaresbitch.
Sam hunched over him, his long torso allowing him to easily reach Gabe's throat, and he sucked a dark bruise over Gabe's scent gland. His free hand palmed Gabe's cheek to turn his face, Sam's lips landing hungrily on his. Sam shifted his hips, and began a long, deep roll, and Gabe whined against his lips, unable to do much more than take it as his Alpha claimed him, asserting his dominance.
Cas leaned in and kissed him slowly, and Dean melted against him, kissing him back lazily, their tongues twining. Cas broke the kiss to press his forehead against Dean's, and took a slow, shuddering breath.
Cas leaned back and fisted his hands in Dean's t-shirt, followed by a great ripping sound as he tore it in two. Dean's body jerked with the pull, and he felt his cock harden further with the demonstration of strength. Cas manhandled him onto his stomach and his jeans followed the way of his shirt, sparking a protest this time.
Much love to my beta, Dani, as always!
server for like-minded chats, friendly people, and inspiration for reading and writing!
“Sam, wait,” Gabe spoke softly. “I want to see your face. I want to ride you, but I want to face you, and to kiss you.”
The door closed, and Gabe sauntered down the stairs. Sam's eyes flashed red, his nostrils flaring. Within half a second Gabe was in his arms, and Sam was scenting at his throat, running his hands over his bare chest, then picked him up and rubbed his stubbled jaw against Gabe's.
"No," Cas replied, ducking his head to meet Dean in another demanding kiss, completely dissolving his resistance.
Dean couldn't even remember when he'd fallen in love with the angel. Had it been so gradual that he hadn't noticed? Had it been so immediate that he didn't know any other way to feel? Cas was everything, but Dean knew he didn't have a chance. Even with the man now human, Cas was just more than he deserved.
“Mmph, Alpha, please, Sam, need your knot. Want it hard!”
He got to Baby and unlocked the driver’s door. He whimpered, slicking instantly as the scents his Alpha had left shortly before nearly overwhelmed him. He started her engine, letting it idle for a few minutes as he laid his head back and replayed the last hour and a half in his mind. As his jeans started to grow uncomfortable, he sat up and rolled down the window, shaking his head a little. He pulled out of the lot and headed home.
“Sammy texted him, don’t worry about it, angel.”
“Well, if I'd had second thoughts before I scented you, the way you dealt with that drunk Alpha would have done it.”
“Dean,” Jo had re-appeared with a slice of apple pie, and said his name like he was an idiot, which he didn't think was exactly fair, “Charlie and I have been together since my senior year of high school. That was six years ago. What are you, twelve?”
Meg spun the bottle and it landed on Cas.
“See you in half an hour, Gabriel. Goodbye.” Cas hung up and wrapped his arms around Dean to scent him for a minute.
Gabe sighed and took another bite of his burger, and was rewarded with another slow rock of Sam's hips. He moaned softly, and clenched around Sam's cock deliberately, pulling a moan from his mate. But then Sam's hips stilled.
"You're only wishing she offers to do that for you. Fine, get outta here, bitch. Baby's a lady, treat her right!" Dean ordered as Sam rolled out of the garage, then turned with a smirk. He sauntered through the bunker to the kitchen and cracked open a beer, taking a swig, and pulled a second from the fridge.
"If you're done speculating on our sex life, don't you have a bridge to hide under, riddles to manufacture for small children, or maybe goats?"
“Cassie, he's what, ten hours pregnant at most? He's fine,” Gabe soothed, but allowed himself an eyeroll.
"Yeah, let's go…" he growled, pulling Dean in for a quick hard kiss as Dean started Baby's engine. Pulling out of the lot, Dean headed for Cas' house, only to moan suddenly as Cas' hand slipped up his thigh to stroke him over his slacks. In moments, Cas' clever fingers had unzipped his fly and reached into his panties, pulled out his cock, then Cas started to bend over. Before he could reach his goal his movement was arrested by the corset vest and he stripped it hurriedly. Dean was about to ask what he was up to when suddenly Cas turned in his seat and bent, dropping his lips to Dean's cock and flicking his tongue over the tip.
Lisa crawled backwards over Dean and he leaned back, trying to avoid too much contact, then he shuffled forward and spun the bottle. He settled back on his haunches with a grin that turned into a mischievous lip bite when it stopped on Cas. Cas, who was looking at him with a small, secretive smile, his eyebrows lifted in challenge.
“I can't believe you would suggest that I would only call--”
He did.
“That’s it, come on, baby, come for me,” Cas ordered, grinding against his prostate and sending Dean screaming over the edge. His legs slipped from around Cas’ waist as he shuddered, his heart thudding explosively in his chest, his entire being centred on where they were joined. “Oh, fuck, Dean!”
"Oh, god, Cas!" Dean moaned, finding his lips and claiming them gently.
"Can I?" he asked, his voice impossibly deep and Dean nodded, swallowing with nervous excitement. Cas's long, clever fingers quickly undid Dean's jeans and tugged them down his bowed legs, exposing pale pink, satin panties. Cas let out a choked gasp and dropped to nestle between Dean's thighs. His breath was warm against the satin and the skin beneath, then he mouthed along the base of Dean's cock and up the shaft. Dean moaned under Cas' expert touch.
Here's to my beta, Malmuses, who yelled at me for this one. 🤣
Gabe looked at him intently for a moment. “Does Deano need to be taken care of?” he asked, curiously. “He seems like the epitome of liberated Omega, though the fact that he looks like an Alpha likely doesn't hurt.”
“Of course. Chocolate or gummy worms?” Cas grinned, knowing his brother's heat preferences well.
Thanks Mal! 😘💖
Dean’s eyes widened.
“So, is this place always this busy?” Dean asked hoarsely, carefully avoiding the tired come-here-often line. “Do you know how long it's been open?”
"Yeah, Cas?" Dean answered, the fog of their breath mingling in the sparkling cold air.
“Hey Cas?”
Cas was suddenly standing, leaning over with his hands on the table. "I want a taste."
“Oh gods, Alpha,” Dean whimpered, the muscles in his shoulders standing out as he fought his body’s inclination to pull against the restraints. “More, please.”
Dean's eyes widened at the order, then he slammed them shut, just in time. Cas pistoned his hips into him twice more, then his body tensed, locking against Dean as he spilled over. The lightbulb burst as a brilliant blue flare of grace filled the room, Cas' cries pulling Dean over the precipice. He shuddered with a silent scream as he came over the feathers teasing his cock, then collapsed to the bed, only able to moan softly as Cas continued to rock into him slowly.
CONTENT WARNING:
Gabe moaned softly, leaking more slick at the orders from his Alpha, and he felt Sam twitch within him. He scooped up the burger again, taking a large bite, and purred as Sam rocked his hips lightly again. They fell into a pattern. Gabe would take a bite, and Sam would rock them together until Gabe was done that mouthful, then he would stop. Sam ate his own food in methodical bites, finishing long before Gabe, but showed no sign of impatience as his Omega slowly worked through the burger and pile of fries. When he finished the last bite, Sam move his palm to Gabe's stomach, and he gave a low, pleased rumble.
He rolled Cas onto his back, bending to kiss him fervently, a quiet moan escaping him as their chests brushed. Cas was like a furnace, his skin flushed and hot to the touch, and Dean pressed closer, revelling in his warmth. He kissed his way down Cas' torso, slowly worshipping every inch of skin until he reached those tantalizing hip bones. He brushed over them with his thumbs, watching as Cas squirmed under his touch.
” Gabriel asked indignantly.
“Just a black coffee for me, please Jo?” he asked, meeting her gaze steadily. She nodded and he gave her a smile. “Thanks!”
“I was hoping we could go another round in the shower, but now I really need to be clean. Thanks, angel.”
Clearing his throat, Dean grabbed his notepad and started making a list of plants that would do well for Cas with little attention, since he knew what it was like to try to get a new business off the ground.
From the smirk on the other man's face, he’d failed.
he thought to himself with a smile. He sang along with his music, and wondered idly about the drawer he was supposed to check when he got there. He pulled into the driveway and cursed, realizing he’d forgotten to get the code for the garage amid all the distractions.
Dean heard Cas distantly, but in his panicked state, all he could think was he had harmed their pups by shifting.
Dean and Cas settled in on the giant bean bag cushion in the corner, curling up together as though they'd always done it. Dean nuzzled at Cas' cheek, and Cas grinned, turning to whisper in his ear.
Sam howled as his knot locked into place, and the lovers cried out their release together.
Dean set his teeth to the tendon on Cas' neck lightly and Cas shouted his name, bucking underneath him. There was a sudden wetness between their bellies as precome spurted from Cas' dick and Dean chuckled devilishly.
"Alright people, spin the bottle!" Charlie announced and Dean nearly choked. Glancing around he saw Aaron eyeing him shyly and bit back a groan as Benny elbowed him in the ribs from his left, while Lisa giggled and leaned into his side from the right. He could smell the tequila on her breath and wondered just how many shots she'd done.
“Sam packed up some clothes for me, though I think he was traumatized going through my underwear drawer,” Dean explained with a wink as he eyed traffic before pulling out in a wide U-turn. Cas groaned, thinking of more satin and lace panties showing off that perfect ass. Dean gave him a look, his eyes dropping from Cas’ eyes, to his lips, then to his throat, where the mating mark stood out. The scent of their arousal started to take over the small space of the car, and Cas rolled down his window, hitting the fan in desperation.
Sam comforts Jo, Dean and Cas remain in the hospital, with Cas still in a coma.
“That's because you refuse to admit I have one,” she retorted, and turned on her heel to help the next table.
“I can't just call my favourite brother?” Gabriel asked indignantly.
Posting early because I'm dead on my feet and won't make it til midnight, and with all the lovely comments I've gotten, I decided to thank you, my readers, with an early post. Enjoy!

Thank you to Banshee for her help as my beta, I really appreciate it!
“Sam, what is your wolf telling you?” Gabe asked softly.
Dean watched as his best friend dug into a greasy bacon cheeseburger, moaning as though it were the most incredible thing he'd ever tasted. Maybe it was? Molecules and all that, when he was an angel, so maybe this burger really was a transcendent experience. It wasn't making life easier for Dean though, who squirmed in the booth opposite Cas and tried to think of anything but the quiet moans and sighs coming from across the table.
He blinked slowly, then gave the stranger a wry, cheeky grin of his own. "Thanks for the rescue, that guy was creeping me out." Dean checked out the stranger unabashedly, nearly drooling at the man's strong arms bare under a black and brown corset vest, his thick thighs encased in leather pants and heavy black boots on his feet.
Cas winked at her, raising his coffee in salute.
“It's a classic, even if it was recorded as a joke.” Cas shrugged with a wink.
Back to Cas and Dean, and more smut. This is a longer chapter, so have fun!
For the first time in several minutes, a sound escaped Dean that wasn't one of pleasure, and he winced as his head encountered the hard shape of a bottle…
“It's gonna be like this around you two idjits all the time, isn't it? Well, welcome to the family, Cas. ‘Bout time someone put a leash on this one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Kevin spun the bottle nervously, and the group laughed uproariously as it landed on Victor. Kevin's shoulders slumped at the crude teasing, but he crawled over and planted one on Victor anyway, earning him points in Dean's book. The kid (who was barely that at eighteen) was alright.
Song is Shook Me All Night Long by AC/DC. Credit where it's due.
Dean squirmed, clenching his cheeks to feel the plug bump his prostate again, and moaned softly.
"I want to feel you," he told Dean.
“Half an hour, if we leave now. Tell Sammy to forget about ordering ours, we gotta go in and sit. You have to try Ellen's pie and we can get a couple of beers.”
"Dean Winchester, you're clueless. Fast or slow, I'm gonna make love to you, because I'm in love with you, you ass."
Dean smirked at him from inches away, his verdant eyes lit with smug mischief. “Who do you think booked me on the bull? Crazy coincidence that he interrupted just before things got too hot and heavy in the office, and yet with time to let me ride on schedule, huh?”
Dean shot him a heated, coy glance from under his lashes, and stretched his arms above his head. Grasping the rails of the headboard, he lifted his hips and pivoted, turning gracefully onto his stomach. Cas growled softly, and watched as a shiver travelled down Dean’s spine, pebbling his freckled skin in a wave. Cas stared down at him for a moment, until Dean started to squirm.
“Home away from home. Ellen and Bobby more or less raised Sam and I after Mom died. Like I told you, Dad tried, but he’d pretty much checked out. I reminded him too much of Mom, I guess.” Dean shrugged, but Cas could see the wound was still there.
"Now! Now now
Dean and Cas try again to be intimate. The day of the BBQ arrives.
When Cas woke the following morning in a wave of arousal, sun was streaming through the blinds, lighting Dean from behind. All he could see of his Omega was the top of his head as he crouched over Cas, his mouth
“Oh fuck, Dean…” Dean popped up his hips and wiggled his ass for good measure, then felt Cas pull the panties to one side again and teased his cock over his hole.
"Where're we going, my place?" Cas purred, edging closer and nibbling at Dean's jaw.
Dean tucked his hands under Cas' thick runner's thighs and pulled him closer, sinking further into his body with a groan as the angle changed. Cas moaned against his throat, kissing his way down to his collarbone and bit him gently, setting Dean's nerves alight. Dean reached between them and grasped Cas' thick, weeping cock, the head blushing a deep red with arousal. Stroking his lover slowly, Dean thrust into him again, groaning at the tight heat engulfing him.
His Alpha nudged him with his muzzle and Dean sank to his haunches with a bark, his tail wagging briefly before curling to the side. He felt his Alpha's tongue lap over his hole for the first time and whined again, shifting his stance to raise his hindquarters. His Alpha had buried his snout against his hole, lapping at the slick still pouring from him, and the Omega was quickly reduced to whines and quiet yips.
He must have winced because Cas suddenly looked worried and reached out to brush a gentle touch across the back of his hand.
server for like-minded chats, friendly people, and inspiration for reading and writing!
“Was that the request or the suggestion?” he teased, and Cas gave him a shy smile that set his heart pounding strangely.
"Game time!" Charlie shouted, making Dean jump and nearly fumble his beer, and he took another swig, glancing over and seeing Cassie had joined the group of girls. That addition made him nervous; he and Cassie had been hot and heavy for over a year, but eventually she'd broken up with him with a sad smile, telling him he needed to follow his heart.
"What kind of pie?"
Dean arched under his touch, his nerves alight with pleasure. His hands found themselves in Cas' thick, unbelievably soft hair, and he stroked his fingers through gently. He pulled Cas up to meet his lips, soft and slow. The kiss seemed to go on forever, and Dean sighed happily against Cas' lips and nudged him back a little to speak.
As they lay together in the aftermath, Cas stroked gentle fingers down Dean's back.
A warmth spread in his chest as he met Cas' blue eyes. Cas understood. He got it. Cas loved him too! Pulling him in, Dean kissed him slowly, putting everything he felt for his angel into that kiss, and Cas whimpered softly. Chasing the low sound, Dean's arms tugged Cas closer, moulding their bodies together.
“You bet. Now, Charlie, it's nice to put a face to the name, as well as the lovely woman who assisted me when I booked an appointment for tomorrow.”
how you knew?!” Dean demanded, staring at Charlie.
“How long was I out?” he asked, stretching leisurely.
Sam caught him just as he crossed the doorway. He scooped Gabe up around the waist and deposited him in the middle of the bed on his hands and knees, and without warning, drove into him hard. Gabe was reduced to desperate mewls, and instinctively dropped down onto his forearms, until his face was pressed to the mattress, their combined scents filling his senses as Sam pounded into him. When one large hand wrapped around his cock, Gabe nearly collapsed.
“Damnit Dean, he’s got two and a half hours left on his shift, get outta here so he can work!” Gabe scolded, and Dean snorted.
“Ahh, you’re using me for my in-house laundry and spacious kitchen,” Cas teased him and Dean took a slurp of his coffee to think for a moment, then set it aside.
Without hesitation, Dean reached back and twisted the man's wrist sharply, the cry of pain from the drunken Alpha was a balm to Cas’ wolf, but a low growl escaped him nonetheless.
Imbiowaresbitch on tumblr, feel free to come yell at me.
Gilda joined them, then Pam, and Dean eyed them curiously for a minute before shrugging to himself. His eyes drifted back to Cas as a matter of course, and he saw that Kevin had joined the group. April hovered near Daphne, and Dean watched her with narrowed eyes. He didn't trust her, though Cas had no complaints.
Alpha,” Dean whimpered as he opened the driver’s door to reach back to unlock the back door. The moment it was unlocked, Cas was wrenching the door open and tugging him around to pull him into the backseat. A moment later he was grateful the t-shirt Dean had put on that morning had been just a plain black one, because in one pull he ripped the shirt down the front and was pushing the shreds down over his Omega’s arms, along with the loose flannel he wore over it. Dean’s body jerked with the strength of his Alpha’s pull, and Cas knew that even Dean's new lined panties weren’t going to save his jeans from the gush of slick that he could scent strongly in the confined air. Dean’s hands shook as he reached for Cas’ buttons, trying to be careful not to pop any since his Alpha would be going back inside.
Cas snickered at the indignation on Dean's face and stood to shake Bobby's hand. “Good to see you again, Bobby. How're the repairs coming?” Cas asked with a grin.
“Gabe, sugar, I do not need to know about my brother's sex life. But pregnant already? I dunno, Dean's suppressants were pretty strong, and he definitely shouldn't have had a heat yet.” Sam frowned, realizing Gabe shouldn't have gone into heat either. “Dean's always wanted pups. I'm just worried for him, that he's so caught up in having found his True Mate that he's imagining all of his other dreams coming true.” He sighed, heavily. “Listen, Gabe, is Cas a good guy? I mean, if he's Dean's True Mate, he'll treat him right, but… will he take care of him?”
Cas had had enough teasing, apparently, and with sharp claws digging into his hips to hold him still, Cas slammed home, then withdrew and set a punishing pace. Dean cried out, and found himself driven up the bed until he was able to wrap his hands tightly around the bed rails, and he pulled himself forward, forcing Cas to follow closely. He was mostly upright, leaning back into his Alpha’s thrusts, even as he was driven against the headboard. Cas slipped one hand from his hip to his hair, tugging sharply to expose his throat, and Dean let out a broken whimper at the sting of pain, even as Cas licked up the taut muscle over the side of his neck, and back over the mating mark on his neck. Cas latched onto his throat, sucking a dark bruise over his pulse, and his other hand slid from Dean’s hip to close around his cock, stroking him in time to his thrusts. Dean whined at the sudden touch on his cock, which had been neglected since they began, barring the bit of rutting against the sheets he’d done before Cas had moved him. The sudden feel of his mate’s hand, slick with precome, tight over the head, had him letting out breathy moans, each higher than the last as the heat coiling in his gut threatened to overwhelm him.
“What, I'm hungry!” he pouted, his eyes wide. Sammy was the true king of the kicked puppy look, but Dean could hold his own. Cas simply rolled his eyes to the ceiling, and was suddenly staring at him with luminous blue eyes, wide and nearly glistening. Cas wet his lips lightly, and said one word.
Drawing back finally, Dean looked at the mark with smug approval.
The boys are in the hospital
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm yours, Dean. All yours," Cas promised against his skin, kissing and sucking a mark over his collarbone that had Dean whining and squirming.
“Actually, Balth…” Gabe grinned, wiggling his eyebrows.
Dean's hips bucked at the small pain as he heard the lock click under Cas' other hand. He moaned as Cas slipped a warm hand into his back pocket, pulling him closer and slotting his thigh between Dean's legs. Grinding against the thick runner's thigh, he pulled Cas' head around to find his mouth, kissing him passionately. Cas groaned softly, his hands pulling at Dean and setting his blood boiling.
“And my little sister ratted me out.” Dean knew he was being unreasonable, but there it was.
I'm going to make love to you." Before Dean could think of a response to that declaration, one of Cas' hands slipped down between them and he rubbed a dry finger in a slow, gentle circle over Dean's hole.
“That I'm home.”
“Nope!” Cas replied, popping the P with a lazy smirk. He lowered the drunk to allow him to stand on his own, and waved at a large server going past. “Benny, please assist Mr. Adler in settling his tab, I know he has one running. Then call him a cab, and pass the word to my brothers. This is his last visit to our establishment.”
Dean's cock jumped a little at the husky order, the predatory look in Cas' eyes sending a shiver down his spine. He was fumbling for the doorknob behind him when it opened with no warning.
Cas could hear the eyeroll.
Sam licked over the mating mark suddenly, and Gabe cried out, his cock throbbing, his sac tightening against his body. His Alpha groaned as Gabe's walls tightened about him, but he never increased the pace, just kept to the slow, gentle movements Gabe had requested.
Heaven. It felt incredible.
"You want me to kiss your pride?" Cas confirmed with a teasing, gummy grin. "Isn't that parked in the driveway?"
Cas seemed to realise the same, and he stepped back, his shoulders slumping a little. "I should get back," he mumbled, and before Dean could say another word, he turned and disappeared out the door, jogging across the street.
“Sure, why not? We’re just business owners who’ve worked a single day after three days off thanks to our mating, oh, and won’t be in tomorrow either because of appointments. Speaking of which, when is your appointment with the midwife?”
“Huh. Ya know, if we can figure this out? We’ll have amazing Halloween costumes, Cas.”
“Dean. Backseat, and you better hope no one calls the sheriff on us, because I’m going to take you hard, and fast, and everyone is going to hear you screaming my name, begging for my knot.”
The claws, what the
She reappeared a minute later with a sly grin, and Dean braced himself for whatever she'd come up with. “Oh, I can take measurements of the master, I just don't know which one of you that is.” She winked at Dean and he grinned, shrugging.
Rather than trying to escape the next blow, he rolled his hips back to meet it, his back arching. He knew exactly what Cas was seeing, the black mesh of his panties letting the red bloom of each slap to his skin show clearly. Cas let out another low groan, Dean's name escaping his lips like a benediction. Or a curse.
“Whew!” Charlie exclaimed, wrinkling her nose at the sudden scent of arousal clouding the table. “Okay, I'm outta here, but my handmaiden owes me ice cream and a Mario-Kart marathon to earn my forgiveness!”
When next they woke, their wolves had let them shift back, and they were wrapped around each other in a tangle of limbs. Blue eyes stared into green for a moment, then Cas slowly, tentatively bent to kiss Dean, each movement careful and gentle. Dean’s lips opened for him without hesitation, and Cas scented him carefully, seeking any negative emotions. All he could smell was warmth, home, mate, and he knew they were okay. He disentangled himself from Dean slowly, and stood, pulling Dean upright with him. He slowly walked Dean backwards to the bed, and urged him up onto the mattress. Dean crawled backwards until he was nestled on the pillows, and Cas followed, trailing gentle kisses up his mate’s body until their lips met again. By the time he reached Dean’s mouth his mate was squirming underneath him, whimpering and panting.
“Sure, rub it in. What time are you gonna be home, angel?” Dean asked as he headed for the bathroom.
Dean smirked. "What're you talking about? Raiders, Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade! You've seen them all!"
that yet, but he's not an idiot.”
Dissolving into helpless laughter, Cas climbed to his feet and pulled Dean up with him, and they wandered through the house to the basement, where Charlie was kicking ass at Mario Kart, as usual. As they appeared in the doorway, silly smiles still in place and their hands linked, Dean met Sam's glance from across the room, where he was nuzzling at Ruby's hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
He tossed them to Sam with a wink, then admonished, "No sex in my car. Charlie, love ya, we're outta here."
Dean growled deep in his chest, tossed one of Cas' legs over his shoulder, and held onto his thigh, pounding into his lover hard and fast. The heavy slap of skin against skin echoed through the room with their cries, which climbed higher and louder the closer they each got. Cas spilled over first, his body seizing around Dean's cock with a soundless cry. Dean held on for a few strokes more, but then Cas bit at his throat, and the zing of pleasure-pain rocketed him over the edge. He came with a great groan, surrounded by Cas' heat, firing deep into his lover's body.
Dean popped off, his cheeks flushed with heat, and his eyes watering from the times Cas had accidentally bucked and choked him a little. Still, he smirked as he moved back a bit even as Cas whined in distress. "Oh, no, you don't, angel. Not yet." Shifting Cas' legs up over his shoulders, he bent and pressed a kiss directly over his tightly furled pucker. Cas jumped.
"Love them. Leave them on?" Cas murmured, then rolled them again, pulling Dean over him and hooking an ankle behind Dean's knee. His hand swept down Dean's chest and over his stomach, then stopped to tease at the waist of those pink panties. Dean gave a nod, his voice strangled by discovering this side of Cas, and then Cas' clever fingers pushed the satin down to catch under his balls.
Dean spoke without thinking. “Giving how delicious your shop smells, I can see why.” Charlie elbowed him sharply, and Dean shrugged. “It’s a chocolate shop; that’s a compliment!” He turned back to Cas, only to find the Beta strangely silent, his cheeks flushed. “I’d recommend bamboo or ferns, or other green plants that don’t flower indoors. Jade, English ivy, peace lilies, philodendron, any kind of succulent… even spider plants would give you plenty of greenery without adding distracting scents, so your customers would be able to smell the chocolate.”
It was running on five p.m. when the door chimed, and he turned with a smile that froze on his face when Cas entered the shop, looking nervous.
“Um, that was Dean. Obviously. Your brother is apparently his True Mate. And they think Dean is pregnant.”
"Oh, I want to," Cas muttered hoarsely, nipping at the cheek of Dean's ass with a sharp bite. Dean jumped, letting out a muffled cry, and Cas crawled up over him, pressing against Dean's ass with one leg, the rough denim teasing and tormenting him. Dean ground down against Cas' knee even as Cas reached into the drawer with one hand and pulled out the lube in a moment. "How're we doing this?"
Thanks to my beta, Dani, for her help and suggestions! 💖
He toweled himself dry and used a second on his hair before tossing both into the laundry room to join the sheets he’d stripped from their bed that afternoon. He climbed the stairs, the air conditioning chill on his still damp skin, and checked that the coffee maker was ready for the next morning. Dean hadn’t set it, and Cas paused, wondering. What time did Dean work tomorrow? He himself worked from two in the afternoon until ten, and he hoped their schedules would line up well enough. He realized suddenly he hadn’t checked with Gabe that Thursday wasn’t going to be a problem for him to miss. He grabbed his phone and fired his brother a message, then set it to silent. The morning would be soon enough for any replies. He crept into their room, and found his mate wrapped around his pillow, but with a grey bundle in his arms. He smiled softly, recognizing his shirt from the previous day. He’d have to make sure to leave Dean a few items of his clothing any time their shifts were horribly misaligned like this. As he carefully slid into bed, his hand encountered a silken bundle. Seeing it was a silk scarf, he grabbed it and moved to the bathroom, closing the door and turning on the light. Loosening the knot Dean had made in the black silk, he inspected the contents and felt his resolve to let Dean sleep waver as blood rushed south.
The giant black wolf with the intense blue eyes stared at him, and Dean whined at him, pleading. Cas, because it was still Cas, stalked forward and nuzzled at him, his tongue curling around Dean’s muzzle instinctively. The Omega submitted again to the Alpha.
“You have trouble with an Alpha, boy?” Bobby interjected, a scowl drawing down his brows.
Cas gasped. Only then did Dean remember his underwear. Soft pink satin, with peekaboo lace over the hips and a bow nestled daintily above his leaking cock, which strained and stained the delicate fabric.
Cas burst out laughing, most of his anger fading, and he steered Dean towards the door.
Dean felt his cheeks heat at the way Cas spoke his name, like a caress, and he pulled Cas in for another kiss. Step by step they moved through the house, careening off walls and tripping up the stairs as they continued to make out. Dean's plaid decorated the banister on the way to the second floor, and by the time they hit the upper hallway, Cas' button-down was three-quarters undone. Dean pinned Cas to a wall suddenly and his mouth found his boyfriend's collarbone, then trailed down his chest to tongue at a pebbled nipple.
Awareness flooded Dean as they carefully settled to the ground and Cas gently lapped at his newest bite mark. They made themselves as comfortable as possible while knotted and in unfamiliar forms, but as Cas wrapped his tail around Dean for warmth, he found himself letting loose a low rumble, as close to his contented purr as a wolf could manage.
Dean whimpered, giving off waves of distress, and Cas stroked his hair, soothing him. “I’m awake, love. No unconscious reactions, just me, telling you how I’m feeling.” Dean was shivering now, and Cas wracked his brain, then kissed the top of Dean’s head and nudged him gently to sit on his own. He pulled the light blanket from the foot of the bed onto the floor, and made it into a cozy nest. “Join me, my Omega. Come to your Alpha.”
“Yes,
It took Dean several tries and a rough clearing of his throat to get his voice back to an approximation of his regular voice, and then all he could say was,
“Two, actually. Condom broke this morning.” He sighed and ran a hand down his face. “Alright, it's lunch time anyway, but we're not stopping to visit while you two go at it. And Sam
“Wait, is
Yell at me in the comments, or come yell at me on tumblr, imbiowaresbitch.
A quiet step behind him alerted him to the presence of his mate, and he turned with a smile.
Much love to Malmuses for beta-ing, for your comments and support!
“I'm sorry, I tried instilling manners into him, but that boy never picked ‘em up. Least not how to behave around civilized folk.”
Cas gives Jody his statement as she patches up his hands, and Donna uncovers a surprise.
Dean's eyes fluttered closed and he sighed in contentment, until a shout from another part of the house shattered the moment.
“Fuck, man, you a vampire or something?” Dean mumbled, and Cas laughed softly, breathing heavily against his bruised skin.
“I did. She's in rut. So that's no bueno.” There was a pause, and when Cassie spoke again, Gabe could hear the smile in his voice.
“You have a bar and grill on speed dial, Samalam? How often do you guys order from there?” Gabe teased, but he was curious.
Cas looked down at his own chest, and chuckled. “You could say that.”
“Sleep, Dean.”
“Love you, Samalam.”
“Omega slut, you broke my wrist!” the drunk whined, clutching at it. “I'm pressing charges!”
“I didn't threaten anyone, did you, Cas?” Dean grinned, a sharp display of teeth.
Dean was apparently a glutton for punishment because his mouth opened, and he replied, "You should try the pie."
“Gabriel. Eat, Omega,” Sam growled, and Gabe's wolf rolled onto its back and whined, presenting its stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do I need to dig through my stuff and find my noise cancelling headphones?” he asked, sending his brother bitch-face number thirty-seven.
"Dean," Cas breathed, stepping closer and taking his other hand so they were face to face.
And Cas let go.
Cas rolled his eyes in turn and leaned in for a kiss. "Was that what you had in mind, Dean? A bit of nostalgia for when I didn't know what lube was?"
Love as always to Dani for her amazing beta skills!
Please, note the new tags. We have shifting, we do NOT have bestiality, nor will we. Both partners as human, or both as wolves, never one of each.
“Opinions on Zeppelin?” Dean asked quickly.
“Damnit, Gabe, you're driving me crazy,” Sam breathed. “Um, yeah… it's called the Roadhouse. Call Anna and order then.” And Sam heaved himself to his feet, his knot tugging slightly at Gabe's rim, making him whimper at the sharp pleasure flooding his senses again. Gabe clenched unconsciously, and Sam nearly stumbled, groaning softly. “
“Alright, Ash? Oh! Um, hey Ellen, Ash had to go? Yeah. No, no. Um...” Gabe grinned as his Alpha stammered like a pup caught in a lie, and decided to help.
Jo shrieked, turning heads all through the restaurant. She launched herself at Dean, who caught her and gave her a hug, laughing all the while. Ellen gave a smile and slung an arm around Bobby's shoulders, leaning her head against his.
“Mine,” the Alpha growled, and Gabe felt himself slicking slightly at his mate's possessiveness. Sam's nostrils flared as he stared down at him, and Gabe whined softly, tilting his head back to expose his throat, his wolf doing the same.
"I thought about using flavoured lube, but ya know, molecules," Dean told him with a breathless chuckle, then groaned as Cas took the hint, trailing his tongue down his crevice and circling the end of the plug.
The two men stood and strode from the restaurant. Dean walked quickly to Baby, knowing Cas would be close behind. But being pinned to the driver's door wasn't quite what he'd expected. Nor was having his mating bite nipped, which nearly took his legs out from under him as his knees buckled.

Dean's eyes dropped automatically and he wet his lips unconsciously at the sight that greeted him. His underwear was starting to feel uncomfortably damp, and there was no way Cas couldn't scent his slick. His eyes flew back to Cas’, who was watching him with a dark look.
Gratuitous fluff and smut. Get used to it, I got more where that came from. 😜
“Dean, what you do to me. Wearing my shirt like that, knowing you're in the panties I bought for you that match your eyes... you've been driving me crazy all evening. You think I couldn't feel your eyes on me when I was in the kitchen?” He thrust lightly against Dean's palm, and then was pulling back to slide down the bed, undoing his Omega's jeans and pulling them down his legs. The emerald boyshorts were straining over Dean's cock, the lace panels hinting at his hip bones and the satin cupping him perfectly, showing the thick vein up the underside of his cock, the ridge of the head. Cas licked his lips and his eyes met Dean's.
“Um, hey Bobby. We were just--”
Dean cuddled against his side a little awkwardly, but he fidgeted for a minute and then was reaching up to release Cas’ hands as well. He snapped them back on himself in front of Cas, and showed him the release mechanism, then dropped the leather cuffs off the bed with a thunk. He cuddled against Cas’ side again, then winced, drawing back as he glanced down. Flushing slightly, he removed the nipple clamps and tossed them aside as well.
Dean thought to himself. He looked around, trying to spot his brother to let him know not to wait up.
“Angel, you’re not helping on the mess factor,” Dean admonished, but his voice was breathy, his scent of
“I don't know if I can, that burger was huge!” Cas protested, drawing a gasp from Dean and a giggle from Charlie as she stood.
He thought back to the scenario to which he’d woken, and whined slightly as he found himself become aroused. He’d always thought he’d enjoy being tied up, but apparently his wolf wasn’t as enthused. Or at least didn’t like waking up that way. They needed to set some ground rules for how to proceed with the toys, so there were no further misunderstandings. He
Cas’ throaty chuckle went straight down his spine as he nibbled on Dean's earlobe, and murmured for him to continue, though he was somewhat more breathless than before.
“Be two minutes, angel.”
"Baby, you're killin' me. I can't leave yet, but--" Cas cut him off with another deep, claiming kiss and he bit back a moan as Cas ground against him. He could feel his dick responding and clamped his hands on Cas' waist.
Cas glanced down at Dean's plate, and his eyes followed his fork back to his lips. Dean couldn't resist a flirtatious flick of his tongue over the tines of his fork and moaned maybe a little louder than necessary.
Dean and Charlie inspect the garden with Cas, Jo joins them for dinner.  (fluff)
Dean turned back to Cas, looking for sympathy, and grumbled to find the crystal blue eyes filled with tears of mirth as his mate laughed behind his palm. Dean chucked a fry at him with a pout. Cas simply caught it and popped it into his mouth with a grin.
“Sure do, Samalam. You're taking such good care of me, Alpha,” he purred against Sam’s throat, “so good for me, so strong, my mate!”
Thanks Malmuses for beta-ing, and being there.

Dean jerked under his touch, whining desperately for more as Cas reached for his own belt, quickly pulling it loose and dropping it to the floor. He popped open his fly and lowered the zipper, and reached in to stroke his cock through his underwear. Dean’s eyes followed his movements, and his Omega licked his lips in anticipation. Cas pulled Dean to him in a desperate kiss, claiming, wordlessly commanding his Omega to obey. Dean melted against him, submitting to him fully and going pliant, and Cas’ wolf howled in victory.
he wondered for the hundredth time. He took another drink of his beer, watching absently as everyone was herded to sit in a loose circle on the floor and the coffee table was removed to leave an open space on the floor. Sam headed to the kitchen for more snacks and Cas dropped to sit cross-legged, then folded his legs in a lotus position easily. Watching him move so gracefully brought a lump to Dean's throat, and he washed it away with another mouthful of beer. It also made his knees ache in sympathy. Bodies were not supposed to bend that way! Cas met his eyes with a curious head tilt and Dean tossed him a wink, making his best friend grin widely and laugh.
"As you wish," Dean murmured against his skin, then laughed as Cas squinted at him.
Charlie was nodding furiously. “Totally true. Like this table? Absolutely full to the brim with male gorgeousness. Completely wasted on me, the giant lesbian, but there it is.”
Even as Dean cried out softly, his heart was thumping oddly as his mind replayed Cas' words. He started to reach for his lover when the click of a plastic cap distracted him, then the cool slide of a lubed finger against his hole drove all other thoughts from his head.
“I’m sorry if you were disappointed I didn’t wake you, Omega-mine. You were exhausted when you left the bar, Dean, and you were so soundly asleep when I got home, I felt it was better off letting you sleep.” A faint recollection of their conversation in the middle of the night came to him, like a dream of a memory, and he sighed. “I think I do remember us talking, but I must have seemed more coherent than I was. Baby, I’m sorry to have given you a scare like that.”
Dean tensed, then spoke sheepishly into the pillow. “I should get on that, huh?”
Jo arrived with their coffees and Cas thanked her quietly.
Despite Dean's comment about drawing it out, he found he couldn't wait. He crawled up to kiss Cas desperately, and Cas returned his fervour with a passion that matched his own. Even as they kissed, Cas was squirming against him and gasped as he rolled his hips to meet Dean's. The drag against Dean's jeans was driving Dean crazy, and he pulled back to kneel over Cas.
Jody and Ellen catch up, then Jody joins Donna at the crime scene. Gabe continues to support Charlie, and they return to the hospital to discover Dean has woken up. A tense moment when Anna and Jimmy arrive, then Dean's second midwife arrives. Her bark is worse than her bite.
Milton, I'm guessing that's where you two met.”
The wedding reception, then later.
For the first time in his life, he deliberately reached for his wolf, and the Alpha responded. This was their mate, Omega, mother to their pups. They would never allow harm to come to them.
Cas spent the next ten minutes going through Dean's mixtape collection. When finally Dean reappeared, he looked harried and sheepish. He slid into the driver's seat and sat for a moment, catching his breath.
Dean glanced up at him and found those blue eyes trained on him, wild and desperate. A slow, cocky smile pulled at Dean's lips, and without a word, he wrapped his lips around the head of Cas' cock, staring up at him through his lashes.
Gabriel spoke for Eileen, with Cas signing. Watching the graceful movement of his lover's hands had Dean squirming in his seat, missing half the jokes that had Eileen dropping a quick
-- bit into his Alpha's --
“Green, Alpha. So very green,” he breathed, casting a scorching glance over his shoulder. Cas secured his other wrist, and had Dean tug on them. This time Dean responded without prompting, a shuddering breath followed by a whispered, “
"So…" she drawled, "trouble in paradise?" She gave him a meaningful look, and Dean winced. He'd had Lisa leave him for someone else, and though they hadn't been mated, it had hurt. He wouldn't do that to someone else. Resolving to keep his interactions with Cas professional, he shrugged.
“Hilarious as ever. You're skipping out on closing?”
"Use your tongue," the guy said with a dirty wink and Dean groaned, falling to his knees and worshipping the man's cock with his mouth until it was fully hard. He stared up at the stranger, then deliberately took one of his hands and put it on the back of his head. Popping off for a moment, he gave a husky laugh.
Dean dropped the lube on the bed and dove for his lover, kissing him passionately. Cas opened for him, tangling their tongues as their bodies began to move together. Dean grabbed the lube and coated several fingers, then reached down to tease over Cas' hole. What he was not expecting to find was the wide base of a plug.
Sam looked up at his brother, wrinkling his nose at the faint smell of slick about him, and glanced past to the dark haired man in the AC/DC t-shirt leaning against the bar behind Dean.
Cas rolled his eyes at his mate, but a pleased smile hovered about his lips.

Dean blinked, then chuckled. “Yeah, no kidding. Look, I love the idea about the chocolate spider and pumpkins and that, so send over an invoice for the chocolates you already brought. I’ll cut you a cheque, and we can set up an ongoing order. Even with Halloween about to pass, something like chocolate leaves on sticks would go nicely in the bouquets anyway.”

Dean teased and turned his focus inward. He greeted his wolf, who was tired and ecstatic, and saw the bite in his mind's eye that hadn't marred the wolf's throat previously. His inner Omega nodded, content to rest.
“Dean, you alright?” Cas asked softly.
Not this time. It swept forward like a tsunami, wiping away his humanity, leaving only instinct. He flung his Alpha away and bolted for the door, running through the house and then out into the woods for the second night in a row. This time, his Alpha was hot on his heels, herding him, chasing and leading him where he wanted him to go with snarled commands. Dean knew Cas was as far gone as he was, but he felt no fear, only exultation. This is how they were meant to be, Alpha and Omega, and this was their time.
Dean runs his hands down Cas’s back then grabs his ass and yanks him forward and down. Cas’s thighs slip under Dean’s and the movement props his hips up at the perfect angle for their dicks to slide against each other.
Because this is not Charlie.
Dean wraps Cas’s fingers around the tether and forces his thumb down against the crown. With a click, Cas flashes out of sight.

“Don’t know if you drink, angel.” Dean pours a full measure of whiskey into the glass and slides it along the bartop. “But that’s all I plan on doing today.”
Dean spots the signs of a nitroglycerin blast and frowns as he circles the building from a distance. They had started stocking some modified automatons with nitro caps, but the charges should have been detonated much earlier, while the battle was still raging.
When Dean Winchester spots the angel for the first time, a violent shiver runs down his spine. He’s in a vulnerable position, crouched in the mud over a broken automaton with his hands caught deep in the gear works. By comparison, the angel on the boardwalk only a few feet away towers intimidatingly over him.
“Then I think it’s time for us to move to a more sheltered location.”
"We know Jack has been telling people how to get here," Sam says. He glances across the table, meeting Dean's eyes. "Maybe that's not all he's been doing."
“Hey!” Dean leans forward so that Cas can see him as he blinks dazedly. Dean reaches out a hand and gently cradles his face. “Yeah, it’s me. I’m here.”
Cas tips his head back against the wall, his eyes fluttering shut, and Dean mouths at his exposed throat, alternately scraping teeth against the skin and laving the sting away with his tongue. Meanwhile, his hands trail over Cas’s sides and stomach before coming to a rest at his waist.
“Dean?” Cas asks, breaking the quiet. “You once told me no one would know when the battle should end... That we would be trapped here because of it.”
Dean laughs. "Despite almost going into cardiac arrest several times while getting used to it, no, I don't mind. You did good."
“Yeah,” Dean scoffs. “I’m sure that would go great for both of us. Whenever you’re ready, just lead me to your camp, and I’ll have a nice chat with your commanders.”
"Uh, why would he let you do that?"
"How?" Dean asks dumbfounded while he steps through the ring of shattered glass.
The angel reaches up and with a faint click, a humming that Dean hadn’t even realized he could hear fades away. The light goes out, and the mask is pulled down.
"Does that mean you don't mind that I relocated your bar?"
Dean laughs and looks up, ready to rattle off some vague nonsense that won’t merit further discussion. But Castiel is watching him attentively. He looks almost concerned, and Dean feels something shift — some invisible wall that had already begun to crumble topples. He trusts Castiel with the truth, no matter how treacherous it may be.
In total, five loops pass before Castiel appears in Purgatory again. Dean nearly knocks the wind out of Cas, in his hurry to pull him into a hug.
For the first time in years, without Chuck pulling the strings, there just weren't that many monsters that Dean needed to hunt.
Together they build a home.
“A Bradbury loop becomes less stable the longer it is held open. Keeping multiple entities tethered to a loop long-term may have consequences we can’t yet understand.”
When Dean Winchester sees the land for the first time, Cas is by his side, their horses trotting in tandem. It’s a good spot for a ranch — plenty of privacy but close enough to civilization that they don’t have to feel isolated ever again. When the day is clear, airships can be spotted along the horizon, making port in Dodge City.
The Empty is loud, resonating with energy. Angels and demons that have slumbered for decades awaken and wander the dark, tormented by regret.
Dean tugs at the band of vials fastened around Cas’s chest. “What about these? Cas, can any of these help you?”
Castiel hums thoughtfully and takes a sip of whiskey.
Cas lets out a surprised gasp and has to take a moment to steady himself as he blinks down at Dean. But then he lowers his chest and pushes his hands under Dean’s shoulders to hold on. He kisses Dean sloppily and starts grinding against him with determination.
“Strictly speaking, I’m not permitted to remove it during a loop. That would undermine the psychological edge they’re designed to give us.” Castiel pauses before asking, “are you planning on turning me in?”
There's a warning flash of bright red hair just before Dean gets the wind knocked out of him. He stumbles backward, barely keeping himself upright as arms wrap around his chest.
Cas grabs Dean’s wrist, holding him still. When Dean looks up, Cas is breathing heavily but staring at him with focus.
Claire laughs. "Sure."
Will be sent to battle once again
A swell of blinding light passes across the angel’s mask, and Dean flings the hat over his eyes to protect himself from the searing blaze. By the time he chances another look around, the angel is moving away, leaving a crimson trail of blood as it drags the corpse out of sight.
Dean hums in acknowledgment. “I remember. Still believe it, but I guess it doesn’t seem like such a bad deal right now.”
But there's a hand-painted 'For Sale' sign sticking crookedly out of the dry grass, and Dean dials the sun-bleached number anyway.
Dean swears and goes still, willing himself to delay his rapidly approaching climax. He threads his fingers through Cas’s hair and tugs gently until Cas looks up and meets his eyes.
He guesses his orders weren’t meant to include Cas standing next to him while he works — or maybe ‘stay away from the enemy’ is just one of those ubiquitous rules he’s expected to know and follow without anyone explicitly saying so — but Dean stopped feeling guilty about it ages ago.
“So, how do we get out of the loop?”
“The storm is moving closer.”
Castiel turns back to his glass with an amused smile, and Dean allows himself a moment to study his exposed profile.
The darkening storm is leaching the color out of the town and Dean hopes it helps hide his blush as he lets go and takes a step backward. “Uh yeah, I’ll be right behind you.”
The inside of the mask is a curve of smooth copper and sparse leather padding, held in place with tiny screws. Dean pulls a matching screwdriver from his toolkit, and the first bolt is removed before he even thinks to ask permission. But when he glances up, Castiel is observing his work with interest, seemingly unconcerned.
“Dean, your automatons are constructed from a highly conductive material, correct?”
Castiel nods in understanding. “You believe the battle will loop endlessly because there’s no way to satisfy both sides at once.”
Anxiety twists through Dean’s chest as he considers the unknowable future waiting outside the loop. The loop holds plenty of things he would easily leave behind. But, there are other things safe inside the loop that he doesn’t want to risk losing.
Who stalks the damned and dead
Their family grows.
But, he knows what words he needs to say first, and he whispers them to Cas now.
Beware the graveyard angel
“Feels so good, Cas,” Dean says breathlessly. “Not gonna be able to hang on much longer.”
, knowing that the loop can’t reset and take that away from them.
Cas steps backward, his hands firm on Dean’s hips as he blindly leads them through an open door. Dean pushes his hat out of the way, letting it fall to the floor as they move, then he knocks Cas’s hat aside as well and slides his fingers through Cas’s hair. When he sighs, Cas licks into his mouth.
Dean is dragging an automaton out of the corral during the fifty-third loop when an explosion reverberates throughout Purgatory. There’s a cloud of smoke billowing up from Silver Street, and Dean sprints towards it.
The east wall of the assay office is collapsed, and the entire building lists dangerously to one side.
The elderly woman who owns the property just seems glad to finally be rid of it, asking a shockingly low price. She transfers the deed to Dean without a fuss.
Cas is missing from the loop after that as well.
Underneath the wear and tear, the building itself is surprisingly sturdy. It takes time, several months, but Dean steadily renovates. Replacing the floors. Painting the walls. Updating the electrical and plumbing.
“What? You gettin’ sick of me already?” Dean laughs, but it sounds defensive to his own ears.
Or your corpse infused with arsenic
"Well, almost anyone," Dean murmurs. The ache flares up again. "Angels can't exactly wander out of the Empty for a visit."
Dean pokes at a body splayed out on the ground. The skin is blackened and shiny along its right flank where it’s been badly scorched, and a patch of bright orange chemical agent has burrowed through the flesh of its left leg, revealing glimpses of bone. The other engineers have started sending in experimental weapons that might be more effective against the undead, and Dean is supposed to be recording the results from the battlefield.
When Dean returns to his anchor, covered in blood that isn’t his own, he strikes nitroglycerin from the battle plan and snaps at anyone who dares to suggest it be added back.
Around loop eighteen, Dean needs a break.
Of Cas.
“Seriously? You’re just handing it over? You know I’m an engineer, right? Isn’t that, I don’t know, disclosing classified information or sharing military secrets, or something?”
A prayer. A promise.
deserve to be happy."
,” Cas groans and snaps his hips forward, sliding through the slick mess until he reaches his own climax and then he collapses, nuzzling Dean through the afterglow.
The boarding house isn’t fancy, although it is cozy and clean. Dean feels bad about the muddy footprints he leaves on the floor until he reminds himself that the loop will erase the mess. He follows Cas down the hall, peeking into each doorway they pass. A sitting room with shelves of books and games. A dining room with a huge table surrounded by mismatched chairs. A small but well-stocked kitchen.
Somewhere far in the distance Sam wolf whistles.
“Ain’t exactly a celebration, Cas.”
“Are you a Mechanic? Technician? Artificer? The United Frontier Infantry is looking for engineers to develop and maintain our units of cutting-edge clockwork automatons. Serve in Whiskey Company under Captain Bob Singer.”
Infuriating —
"Wow. First of all, rude. Second, I have no idea. Figured the new god didn't really need to explain his reasoning to me." Charlie tugs at his arm, urging him forward. "Come on, I want the grand tour. You can stow the existential crisis for later."
“Oh, great. That’s a comforting thought. Thanks, Cas.”
“Well, you are
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean can tell its face is turned toward him, but each time he tries to look more closely, an agonizing stab of pain forces him away. The mask’s warding is overwhelming at this distance. So keeping his eyes forward, Dean leans over the bar and pulls a clean tumbler from the shelf.
Dean doesn’t try to move away. He watches the angel until the clock runs out.
On the first night, they stake out a plan for a house and then build a campfire in the bedroom. As they fall asleep under a blanket of stars, Dean holds Cas flush against his chest and nuzzles against his neck.
"You know, this place is actually pretty cool."
As they part, Dean rolls them, coming to a rest on top of Cas, and settling his chin against Cas’s chest where they can still look at one another.
"I don't know," Dean sighs. "But, it seems like maybe we've run out of ways to defy the natural order of things."
"I thought you were supposed to be good at this game. Losing your touch, old man?"
One night Dean is making his rounds and discovers Ash, Jo, and Pamela locked in an intense game of poker. Pamela yanks him into a chair and deals him in.
Jack's eyes widen in surprise and then his face falls. "Are you angry with me?"
"I'm glad." Jack smiles, pleased with himself. "I think there might be more I can change. I'm still working on it... But at least for now, anyone you want to see can meet you here."
Cas doesn’t reply. His eyes are closed and his head lolls to the side.
There shouldn’t be any reason for them to hurt one another here. The angel may be tethered to the enemy, but it seems as though its job is the same as Dean’s — recovering resources and intelligence to bolster their forces before another brutal round of battle can begin. They aren’t meant to be combatants. Not really.
Dean collapses back into the dirt to catch his breath. When a shadow blocks out the sun a few seconds later, he opens his eyes to find the angel standing over him again, this time holding out Dean’s worn Stetson.
As the next loop begins, Dean walks to the center of town and sits down on the steps outside Crowley’s. He waits for hours but Cas never appears.
Dean swipes outward with a hand, expecting it to pass through like Benny is some kind of illusion. Instead it connects. Benny is solid. Real. He rests a hand on Dean's shoulder and squeezes reassuringly.
And the man — Castiel is staring back.
When Dean first discovers it, the bar is nothing more than an abandoned farmhouse.
Whispers about angels make their way around the fire in the dead of night, but none of those stories adequately capture the creature that stares down at Dean now. It wears a pale duster that quivers in the breeze, the only movement betraying its motionless form. A bandolier filled with glass vials is slung across its chest, and it clutches a large syringe in a gloved hand.
Cas and Dean have lunch at The Roadhouse.
“So good for me, Dean, gonna come on my cock, baby?”
Cas obliged. With a low curse, he bucked his hips into Dean again, pistoning harder and faster until Dean shouted in incredulous disbelief, his cock hardening again under the onslaught to his prostate. Cas moaned out his name, sweat dripping from his hair and the tip of his nose as he fucked Dean higher on the bed.
Cas tugged on the plug, pulling it part of the way out of Dean's body, only to let go and let it slide back in. Dean groaned as he did it again and again, the stretch of his rim around the thicker part burning pleasantly, then the fullness as it sank back into his body.
Dean glanced down at the faded AC/DC t-shirt, and grinned. “That's more your speed?”
"Technically a quadrilogy," Cas murmured into his coffee, shooting Dean a teasing look from over his mug.
“That doesn't surprise me, I hear you've had practice.” Jo smirked, refilling their coffees as Dean choked on his burger.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean purred and slumped bonelessly against the stall door, his eyes still shut in bliss as he licked his lips, tasting the bitter-salt of the man's come. There was a click and his eyes flew open, staring in shock as the stranger slipped a cell phone back into a pocket.
“I, ah…” Cas scrubbed at his hair, making it stand on end adorably, then continued. “I emptied half my closet.”
Dean tilted his head back and his new boyfriend took the hint, kissing over his throat and down to his collarbone. He felt Cas' hands slip under the edge of his jacket, then Cas was shoving it down his arms, letting it fall to the floor. Catching on quickly, Dean squirmed free to bend and unlace his boots, then kicked them off toward the mat. Cas was stripping his trench and tossing it over the back of the couch facing into the living area, then toed off his boots as well.
Cas rolled his eyes and pulled Dean back into his arms, resting their foreheads together. "I always have been. Don't ask stupid questions."
"You're so beautiful like this Dean, skin all pink, sweating and shaking for me." Cas' voice was a low, husky whisper, and he groaned as Dean's body tightened around his finger. "Next time I'm gonna finger you 'til you come, but fuck, I need to be in you."
“Either than or Sam is on suppressants, which I am not,” Cas interjected, and Dean shrugged.
Fifteen minutes later Sam's knot had let them loose, and their hands had returned to normal.
Cas rolled his eyes cheerfully, pointing a fry at Dean, heedless of the ketchup dripping back to his plate.
Gilda met his eyes over Lisa's head and she winked. Dean grinned back at her, relieved. Gilda would keep an eye on her, on everyone, and make sure everyone stayed safe.
He felt Cas’ hand on his shoulder, but scarcely noticed in his panic. “Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Without waiting, Dean swivelled his hips, grinding down onto Cas, pulling a chorus of moans from each of them. Cas' strong hands gripped his waist and cupped the top of his ass, then began a slow push and pull, rocking Dean on his thick cock. Dean groaned low in his throat, lifting himself to slide back down, over and over. It started slowly, but within a couple minutes Dean was riding Cas feverishly, crying out every time that Cas' cock hit his prostate and quaking as he fought to keep his balance.

"Who" -
“Nah, I told you about our mom dying when I was four, right? And Ellen kinda--Oh, hey Ash, Sam here. Can I get an order for pickup? Dean'll be there in thirty to get it. Uh huh. Nah, I'll have a bacon cheese today too, need some energy. Yeah, side salad though. Oh, and what kinda pie you got, any sugar pie? Uh huh. Yeah. One sec.” He turned to Gabe, his expression like a puppy seeking approval. “No sugar pie, babe, but they have pecan, and it's Dean's favourite, other than Ellen's apple pie.”
Dean threw his head back in laughter, and arm in arm, they walked back to the kitchen. Cas broke away from him for only a moment as they passed the living room, stopping to put a record on before returning to Dean’s side. Dean grinned as an AC/DC guitar riff poured out of the speakers, and when the vocals started, he was singing along, using a serving spoon as a mic.
Jo burst out laughing, even as she sprayed a bit of neutralizing air freshener from a mini aerosol she pulled from her apron.
“Looks like I'm not the only one,” he taunted, leaning closer, taking in the other man's slightly spicy cologne. He was vaguely disappointed to recognize a popular scent-blocking brand, but he supposed it was only fair, he was wearing something similar. Besides, he didn't need to smell the Alpha to know he wanted him.
Dean groaned and kissed Cas soundly, delving past his lips to tangle their tongues, but Cas gripped his hair and pulled him back.
“I’m more tempted to be bad for you, Alpha. But I promise you’ll like it.”
"Fuck, I want you to fuck me," Dean groaned as they parted, and Blue-Eyes growled, kissing his way down Dean's throat and nipping at the skin over his pulse.
"Fuck patience," Dean grumbled, his body trembling. He reached for his cock, only to find his hands suddenly shackled to the headboard by Cas' grace. "Damnit, Cas!"
Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s short hair, scratching lightly at his scalp as he dragged his hand down toward the nape of his neck. Dean shivered lightly, and his purr slid through their bedroom, the scent of his arousal and contentment both increasing.
"A little slap and tickle is one thing, babe, but going in dry just hurts. Lube, as in lubrication."
“Hold on, my Omega,” Sam ordered in a low growl. He widened his stance, and carefully guided his cock to Gabe's entrance, still loose from the previous flash of his heat. He slipped in, and rocked Gabe in slow, shallow thrusts, deliberately avoiding sinking deep enough to reach Gabe's prostate. He grinned at the small whines and pleas from Gabe's mouth, but when his Omega started squirming and panting in his arms, he quickly thrust deeply into him, knowing he couldn't take much teasing. Sam captured Gabe's lips, sucking on his lower lip.
Monday morning for Sam and Gabe, then they head to Cas and Dean's to pull their prank, with unexpected consequences.
Sunday night for Gabriel and Sam, Gabriel's heat makes one last appearance. This is the night before the last chapter, sorry for the confused timeline.
“Well, sonofabitch.”
Cas stared at him for a moment, his cerulean eyes bright with unshed tears, a tremulous smile on his lips. He bent and kissed Dean passionately for a heartbeat, then moved back to toe off his boots. Dean quickly unlaced his own and kicked them loose, then pulled Cas back into his arms where he belonged.
“Our nest, is it?” Gabe teased, then yelped as Sam lifted him as he stood, his hands wrapped under his thighs and behind his knees, and the larger man effortlessly carried him upstairs. He took the stairs easily, each step pushing and pulling his cock in and out of Gabe's wet heat until he was whimpering and squirming.
We're approaching the end of the line people, thank you so much for sticking with me over the last two years, it's been an amazing ride! Just a few chapters to go!
Whatever Cas had been about to say was swallowed by a loud groan as Dean began twirling his tongue around the head of his cock. He sucked slowly at first, but as Cas started to squirm underneath him, he bobbed his head and picked up the pace. Soon spit and precome were trailing down his chin, and Cas' hands were fisted in the sheets, his body trembling beneath Dean's lips. "Oh, fuck,
“NO! Maybe… shaddup!”
Dean started to admonish Sam to be careful but Cas dragged him from the room and up the stairs. Dean stumbled up the stairs behind his boyfriend, his heart beginning to pound with what was coming. He giggled at the phrasing his mind produced, and Cas looked over his shoulder curiously.
Sam called his name and tossed the keys back. "I've… ah, I've got a ride." Next to him, Ruby smirked.
Dean hadn't merged with his wolf fully since he was a teen, one of the few things his father had managed to teach them well before he died. But he realized now that his wolf had always held something back.
Dean wakes back at home in their nest, and discovers his mate, Charlie and Jo in the living room, chatting. Cas shows Dean his newfound control over changing his hands. Jo and Charlie leave, and things heat up between the Mates.
!” came the unsurprising response.
“Dean. Colour?”
"Dean!" Cas cried out and tugged his head up to kiss him repeatedly. Dean succumbed to the onslaught and melted against his boyfriend, and Cas spun them, his fingers sliding up Dean's sides under his shirt and pushing it up his body. Dean reached down and pulled it over his head, then they stumbled down the hall to Cas' room. They fell onto the bed together, a tangle of limbs as they fought over the last few buttons on Cas' shirt, breathless with laughter.
Cas was human again. Needing to eat was certainly an inconvenience for the former angel, but it provided Dean with a unique opportunity. He dragged Cas to his favourite diner, about an hour from the bunker, and ordered for them both.
Gabe turned to face his mate, and the tenderness in his eyes caught him off guard. He reached a hand to Sam's cheek, and ran his thumb lightly down his jaw. Sam leaned into his touch, and Gabe leaned down to kiss him slowly, the urgency of his heat banked under the desire to care for his Alpha. Their lips met in a gentle touch, a slow brush against each other. They parted a moment, and Gabe rested his forehead against Sam's.
Cas sprang to his feet and helped Dean up, glaring down at his brother, who seemed completely unfazed by Cas' irritation.
“Behave, Omega,” Cas growled, knowing his own eyes were ringed with red.
Dean met his gaze for a moment, then pulled back a bit further, giving himself room. A moment later the large tawny wolf sat before Cas, and he greeted him with a kiss, licking over his muzzle. Dean whined, exposing his throat again, and Cas nosed at him, nudging him until he laid down. Once Dean was settled to Cas’ satisfaction, he curled up around him, licking at his ears and the nape of his neck, giving the gentlest of love bites to his throat. Dean finally settled at that, and Cas nosed at him again, this time licking a stripe over his belly, then meeting his mate’s gaze.
"C'mon Cas, need you. You can rip me a new asshole later, I'm a lot more interested in what you can do with the one I already got."
"Nevermind," Dean shook his head and they made their way to the front hall, fumbling with their boots and jackets, then heading out into the cold night. Dean slipped into the driver's seat and reached across to unlock the passenger door, then started up his Baby. Cas shivered across the distance, his breath steaming in the frigid air, and Dean lifted his arm in invitation. A moment later Cas was snuggled against his side.
Charlie and Jo meet Gabe.
from Zeppelin 1 is critically underrated.”
“Alright, baby. For you.”
“Why are you calling, Gabriel?” Cas sighed, moving away from the bed slightly, hoping to let Dean sleep.
want to press charges?” Cas asked, his tone softening from the previous outraged growl.
“Say please, my Omega,” Cas murmured, his voice low and teasing.
Cas burst out laughing as Dean grumbled that he'd be there. “What kind of car is it anyway?” he asked, his green eyes glinting as they headed for the restaurant.
Cas’ gaze flew to his, his blue eyes wide and startled, and his mouth dropped open briefly in a moue of surprise. His cheeks flushed adorably pink, and he licked his chapped lips nervously. A sudden waft of chocolate reached Dean, and he swallowed harshly, reminded fiercely of the scent that might have triggered his rut. It was missing only the honey, and he shook his head distractedly.
“Problem, Alpha? Don't like me on top, controlling the pace? Want to flip me onto my back and show me who's in charge?”
“Sure, Gabriel. We'll be along in about… hmm. Dean, how long will it take to get from here to a store, to the Roadhouse, then Sam’s to drop some lunch for Sam and Gabe. Sam's calling in the order so we won't have to wait.”
Cas is released from the hospital, Dean welcomes him home.
Cas gave a low, husky laugh that went straight to Dean's groin and had his cock throbbing, his slick hole clenching. The Alpha moved close enough to whisper in his ear, his breath hot against Dean's skin, “B-b-baby, you ain't seen n-nothin’ yet.”
“Dean, want you to make love to me," Cas murmured quietly when their lips parted. Dean moaned. They didn't switch often, but who was he to deny his lover anything, especially a request like that?
"Don't call it that, babe, please!" he giggled, not that he'd admit to giggling in his life. Dean glanced over his shoulder at his lover and watched as Cas huffed in response. "I want you to fuck me, want that cock pushing into me, want you to give it to me, come on, Cas, don't make me wait anymore!"
Cas reached past him, pressing against his body, and claimed the bottle of lube, quickly slicking his cock. "Dean… your mouth is going to get you in trouble."
Cas grumbled against his lips, but let his hand be removed. Dean smiled and kissed Cas softly for a moment, then reached down to caress his hip. Cas's legs parted at his touch, and Dean settled between them, groaning softly.
Dean snorted, then looked back at him. “Alright Sammy, don’t wait up!”
Toys. Butt plugs and anal beads. Flavoured lube. Well, that told him who might use the plugs, as Dean’s body provided its own slick. Two pairs of fur-lined leather cuffs, or would those be manacles? A blindfold, a set of nipple clamps, silk scarves. And near the bottom, a leather paddle. Dean stared at it, his body tightening and flushing with heat. Cas had promised to punish him for misbehaving. He glanced into the drawer again and spotted the receipt, dated that afternoon. A different warmth swept through him, that Cas would leave that for him to see with everything he’d bought, and know that they were just for the two of them.
Cas’ eyes narrowed and he could feel his inner Alpha wanting out to tear the drunk limb from limb. The guy was a real problem customer, but he was connected. Cas and his brothers didn't want to create a disaster by kicking him out, but they were all fed up with him, too. He took a steadying breath, but let Dean speak first.
He could practically hear Cassie rolling his eyes, and bit back a snicker.
"You like that?" he teased in a whisper, grinding his hips in a slow, aching circle. Cas' eyes were wild, desperate as he thrust back onto Dean and whined, his cock throbbing against Dean's stomach.
“Ours. Until Dean moves out, then we'll take that room. It's bigger so we can get a proper nesting bed, and the en suite is there.”
“Way to go Cassie!” Gabe burst out laughing, quickly firing off a text to his favourite brother. He snorted at the reply, rolling his eyes, but a huge smile was on his face. He tapped out a quick question, drumming his fingers on the counter as he waited for the reply. Sam offered him a glass of orange juice, and he took it with a grin.
"Yeah, sweetheart?" Dean replied distractedly, busy kissing over the jut of Cas' hip.
Dean decided silently, his dick jumping to instant attention as Cas continued to torture him, all unknowing. Small moans of rapture continued to escape the former angel, his eyes fluttering closed in pure bliss as he ate. When he was halfway through the pie, he seemed to notice Dean's transfixed staring, and a blush swept over those perfectly stubbled cheeks.
His vision greyed out as he struggled to breathe, to focus on his enemy, on the threat to his pack. His rage burned through the grey for a moment, and he saw Bart dangling in the air, his head at an unnatural angle on his neck, and pierced through the middle by a splintered branch.
Cas moaned softly against his rim, teasing and sucking at his skin. Dean found his hands were suddenly free again and buried his fingers in Cas' hair, bucking against his lover's face as Cas ate him out.
Dean was whining high in his throat by this point, desperate to come again, and he wrapped a hand around his cock, stripping it quickly in time with Cas' thrusts.
“Got the short stick, didja?” Dean asked, then winced at the tactless comment.
Cas started laughing in earnest, and reached with gentle fingers to undo the blindfold over Dean’s eyes. He peppered kisses along Dean’s jaw even as he laughed, nuzzling at his earlobe, and Dean felt a zing of pleasure travel down his spine. He melted into the mattress, and just let his Alpha tend to him, stroking his hair and laying gentle kisses against his skin.
The music was still throbbing in his ears as he opened his eyes again, unaware when they slipped shut, and Dean stared at the smirking face of the most gorgeous man he'd ever seen. Dark, sex-mussed hair, cheekbones that could cut glass and a straight, aristocratic nose. But all that paled under the intense blue eyes, the sexy, crooked grin the man gave him. Blue-Eyes glanced over Dean's shoulder and leaned in to shout over the music.
Dean and Cas wrap things up at the shop, and head back to Cas' place.
“Cas, wait…” he breathed, and felt Cas freeze above him. “Did… did you forget a condom?”
A sudden cough caught their attention and the pair froze. They glanced out Cas’ window to see a grizzled older Alpha in a stained ball cap, standing with his arms crossed, his weary eyes showing clear amusement.
Thank you to MalMuses for betaing this chapter for me!

“How did I sleep through that?” Dean demanded and watched as Cas lowered his eyes, his cheeks going rosy with a blush.
Dean vowed he'd never hurt him like this.
Cas knelt over him and worked his boxers down over his thick runner's thighs, and Dean couldn't resist the urge to reach down and stroke Cas' cock. Cas shuddered at his touch and Dean smirked, proud that he could make the angel shake.
“Whoa, didn't mean to interrupt, baby bro!” Gabe teased, a shit-eating grin on his face. His wolf yipped, its tongue lolling out in a wolfish grin at the prospect of playing with his den sib.
“Are you comfortable? Do you want me to continue?” he asked, but apparently Dean had had enough of his caution and restraint.
“Dean, colour?” Cas whispered.
Dean swallowed harshly.
And for my sprinting buddies in Writers of Destiel Discord, who were waiting so desperately for the next chapter. 😉
"I don't want to hurt you, angel."
“Castiel,” the man replied, grinning at Dean's expression. “Religious parents, named almost all of us after angels. Let's leave it at that.” He reached over and took Dean's hand in his own for a firm shake. As their hands moved apart, Dean felt Castiel's fingertips brush lightly over the pulse at his wrist, which had spiked at the other's touch. His Omega, his wolf, presented him with an image of baring throat and belly to the dominant wolf, before presenting something else entirely.
Dean ignored the “awwws” and rolled eyes from Jo and Charlie, focusing instead on the way Cas' lips wrapped around the tines of the fork. But even Cas’ reaction to the burgers hadn't prepared Dean for the low moan he let out upon tasting the pie. Dean felt his pulse skyrocket and a tiny trickle of slick escaped him.

"So… how can I thank you?"
“I’m not angry, love. I’m not feeling violated, or betrayed, or hurt. Dean, scent me. Trust your nose and my words, would you?”
Dean slowly thrust into Cas again, watching for any sign of discomfort in his expression. They'd hurt each so many times over the years, with fists and words, actions and lies.
He tossed everything into the hamper and headed for a quick shower. He wanted to wash away the blockers before his mate came home, and hoped Cas remembered to get rid of his before he came to bed. A few minutes later he walked through the bedroom with a towel around his waist, his hair still sending trickles of water down his back, and crouched in front of the drawer Cas had instructed him to look into.
“Not tonight, babe.” Dean laughed, smiling flirtatiously as the guy pouted and moved on.
Trembling with arousal, Dean pulled Cas over him and thrust up against him, pulling a groan from their lips. Cas pulled back to kneel over him and undid his belt, pulling it from the loops slowly. He dropped it to the floor with a clatter, then reached for Dean's.
"C'mon, Vic, you know I don't wreck my toys." What followed was a learning experience for Dean and he was only on the sidelines. He felt his eyebrows fly up and watched as Kevin stumbled over Sam's outstretched legs and back to his spot.
Eventually, he heard the door chime again, and glancing over his shoulder, saw the shop empty of everyone but Charlie. Sighing, he decided he might as well face the music.

"Can it, you two, people will think you're boning the way you carry on," Ruby told them tartly, and Dean watched as Sam's eyes flitted to the fiery brunette and a blush spread across his cheeks.

he growled under his breath, prompting a low, throaty chuckle from his lover. "You can wait a few more hours. And so can I," he reminded himself, despite the way his blood was singing through his veins. Dean hauled Cas back out to the dance floor to the relative safety of the public eye, though as they passed the photographer, Balthazar, he smirked and snapped a photo of them.
Cas was grateful for the loan of a truck from Bobby as he drove home that night, saving him time and the expense of an Uber. When he got home, Dean’s car wasn’t in the driveway, and he frowned for a moment, then eyed the garage. He hadn’t remembered to give Dean the code, but that wouldn’t have stopped him from going in through the house to open it. The moment he entered their home, he could scent Dean. Not just that it was their home, but his presence. The light in their bedroom had been off when he pulled into the driveway though, and rather than disturb his mate, he ran down to the basement to have a shower in the second ensuite bathroom. He did love his job, loved the banter and energy of the bar. He didn’t love getting home reeking of spilled beer and liquor. Especially with Dean pregnant, he wanted to wash away the stink, and the blockers they’d used after their fierce lovemaking in the Impala. Just thinking about it threatened to draw his fangs down, and he shook his head. He’d teased, or rather, promised his Omega that he’d be punished, but whether Dean knew it or not, he’d seen the exhaustion in his eyes by the time he left the bar. Especially given their intense encounter in the back of the Impala, maybe the best punishment for tonight would be seeing all the toys, but not being woken. If Dean had remembered to look.
Dean pulled Cas back into his arms by his belt and felt a rush of power as those deep blue eyes went dark with lust. "You want me in your bed, sweetheart?"
"Must you be so crass?" Castiel demanded, his face stern and unyielding. Dean figured it was time to up his game. Undoing his belt with one hand, he stroked over the bulge of his cock with the other, moaning wantonly.
He couldn’t help it. Dean just always had to make that cocky, smart-assed comment.
"Deal."
“Jo…” Dean started as an older woman with graying brown hair came over. She finished wiping her hands on a bar towel and immediately cuffed the blonde on the back of her head lightly. Cas watched in amusement as the young Alpha hunched her shoulders and backed off the overt hostility when scolded by her Omega parent. It reminded of him and his siblings when their father was angry, which was rare.
"What have we here?" Cas murmured, his already voice husky gone deep even for him. Dean knew that voice, the velvet over gravel whisper that sent shivers down his spine and made his cock drip with precome. The heat of Cas' body blanketed him then, and Dean nudged back against his lover, whining at the hard length suddenly nestled between his cheeks.
“Come on, don't be like that, little ‘Mega. I can smell your slick, but no way he's going to satisfy you. How about you come out back with me so you can see what a real Alpha's knot looks like?”
Dean's back stiffened as he watched his best friend scoop the saucy brunette into his arms and kiss her deeply. His large hands tangled in her dark curls, and she seemed to melt against him.
This is s rough chapter, in that it details some of the abuse Cas suffered growing up, both mental and physical. As always, please take care of yourselves.
many thanks to Dani, as always. :)
"Woah, wait a sec," Dean muttered as Sam dropped to sit in the circle across from him. "I'm not kissing my brother."
The white boxers made Dean grin for a moment, but the length tenting the front made his mouth water.
Dean snuggled closer and let out a soft, contented sound. "Hmm… shower sex, I think."
"You should show me some respect."
Cas lifted a hand casually and focused on it, a small frown of concentration creasing his forehead. Dean's eyes widened as Cas’ fingertips shifted slowly to claws.
"Try the key lime, Dean, I insist." Dean froze like a deer in the headlights, and unable to resist those cerulean eyes, leaned forward to accept the mouthful. The sweet-tart flavour burst across his tongue.
Cas was practically in his lap by this point, nipping at his lips and down along his jaw. Dean protested the loss of those lips against his own, then his head fell back as a low moan escaped him as Cas' mouth landed on a particularly sensitive spot below his ear. Dean slid back to one elbow, his other hand pulling Cas down against him, feeling Cas' arousal pressing against his own.
"Cas, need you, I'm so close!"

Jo considered him for a moment, then gave him a cheeky grin. “Good answer. Now what can I get you lovebirds? I know Dean's having a bacon cheeseburger and fries, but for you?”
Dean has his appointment at Novak & Novak.

"You want to fornicate?" Cas muttered and Dean couldn't help it, he burst out laughing.
"We're… we're at Charlie's," Dean finally gasped out, and Cas froze against him.
Cas climbed onto the bed and straddled Dean’s legs, bending and pulling his pants down to expose his pale pink panties. Cas growled at the sight and nipped at Dean’s cheek through the silk, then reached over to grab the lube from the bedside drawer. Cas tugged the fabric to one side and rubbed over Dean’s hole with dry fingers, making him shiver and gasp at the sensation.
Dean surrendered completely.
“Smartass. You know you'll be showing by then, right? Especially with twins. That's basically the halfway mark.”
Many thanks to my beta, Dani. 😁
My darling readers, I lost track and missed posting yesterday, mea culpa! I'm so sorry.
Cw:  please note Alex's story is condensed and retold here, so brief mention of rape, underage pregnancy, and domestic violence leading to miscarriage.
Dean looked at him in surprise, and grinned.
Still sporting a huge, gummy grin that did strange things to Dean's heart, Cas thanked their waitress and speared a forkful of his pie. He brought it to his lips and wrapped them delicately around the tines, groaning obscenely even as he licked a bit of meringue from the corner of his mouth.
Dean snorted at him, but settled down with his head on his paws, and Cas flicked his thick tail around them to offer the warmth. Dean slowly drifted off to sleep, and finally, finally, a low rumbling purr started. Cas gave a huff of relief, and resolved to talk to him again when they woke. He wanted his mate to be certain that they were okay.
At first he thought they were headed to the lake again, but instead, Cas chased him to a creek leading away. They followed it, teasing each other with puppyish energy, until they reached an ancient willow, its boughs heavy over the water. It had shaded the ground underneath enough that little grew below it, just grass and moss.
“Why, is my answer a deal breaker?” Cas --
Cas' eyes held his for a long moment, then flicked down to his lips as he spoke. Dean tried not to read into it, but his throat was suddenly parched. He grabbed his beer and took a long swallow, averting his gaze from the former angel.
“Wait, Cassie!” Gabe stared at the phone. “He hung up. Sammy, does the Roadhouse have sugar pie?”
"Dean, you feel incredible," Cas murmured, linking their fingers and pulling him down for a slow, gentle kiss. They spent several long minutes exploring each other's mouths, tasting, teasing, enticing, and inviting. Cas' hands slid up Dean's spine and tangled in the short hair at the nape of his neck. He tugged softly and Dean moaned, his hips bucking a little faster, a little harder. He slid one hand down Cas' side to his hip, squeezing gently, then Cas was hooking his leg up and around Dean's waist.
“Alright, too much testosterone in here. I gotta open tomorrow since Sam's off for Gabriel's heat, so I’ll see you tomorrow, Bossman,” Charlie said with an eyeroll, reaching down for Jo’s hand to pull her to her feet. “Cas, thanks for the amazing meal. And your place is amazing. We're invading for a movie night in that home theater, you know. Wasn't sure if Dean told you. And we're
“Fuck, Cas, I want you in me, Alpha. I have an idea for another time, but for now...
Cas bent to deposit his empty beer bottle on the floor and then snuggled back against Dean, and they cuddled in the oversized chair for a few minutes, lost in each other and the newness of… whatever this was. Dean started to panic again, wishing they could just talk about it, but then Cas turned and nibbled at his ear again.
"Dean…" Cas moaned his name softly, and the sound when straight to his cock. Never had he imagined so sweet a sound, and he'd pictured worshipping Cas' body often enough.
***Dean leads Cas on a chase into the woods, where both mates shift fully before mating and trading bites.
“Oh, shit,” Cas’ eyes widened, “I'm surprised they didn't come get me with a shotgun.”
good-looking, not sexually-appealing good-looking. You know when someone is attractive, whether you want to have sex with them or not.”
“Has he?” Dean eyeballed the bartender and shrugged. No accounting for tastes. Dean strolled over, clapping his brother on the shoulder. “Sammy! I'm heading out.”
Dean took full advantage of the exposed throat and mouthed his way down to the hollow below the clavicle, tugging Cas' shirt to one side to reach. Those long, clever fingers roamed up his back again and tangled in his hair, pulling him closer even as his hips rolled against Dean's in demand.
"Can't wait to get home with you, Dean," he murmured in a low, husky voice. Dean tensed a little, glancing around to see if anyone was paying attention. If anything, they were being studiously ignored… "Because I really want to suck your--"
Dean whined, squirming even more, desperation entering his scent. “
Dean jerked back, staring at him in disbelief. “Why’re you apologizing to
Dean ran up to the house and unlocked the door, only to be met by a glaring, protective Alpha. Cas watched Dean pause, his posture stiffening for a moment, and he fought his wolf’s instincts to protect his mate, knowing it was likely just Dean's changed scent that was riling Sam's Alpha. A minute later, Dean was jogging back to the Impala with a duffel over his shoulder, which he chucked into the back seat.
“Nah, too much paperwork. But I may start wandering other bars, and if I see him pull that shit on another Omega, it won't just be his wrist.”
A sudden commotion at his side reminded him they were at his workplace, and he froze. Charlie snickered next to him as she bustled behind the counter to wrap a bouquet for her customer, an elderly Omega who watched them with amusement.
Cas seemed to sense his hesitation. He brought Dean's hand to his lips and gently kissed his knuckles, and Dean felt his mouth curve in another goofy, love-struck smile.
"Cas, Cas…" he panted. "So tight, so hot…" As he sank deeper into Cas' trembling body, he checked in with his lover. "Is this okay?"
“You got that right.”
” he cried out. He would have collapsed if Sam hadn't wrapped his arms around him, pulling him upright to rest back against his chest, even as Sam throbbed and continued to fill him. “Claim me! Want your mark!”
“Boy, don't make me get the hose. You know I'll do it!” he threatened gruffly, but his eyes twinkling with repressed laughter.
Ash gave a sideways smile and shook his hand.
“Dean, I love you like the brother I never knew I wanted. You and Sam both. But I swear, you're an idiot.” Cas bristled at the insult to his Omega, but Dean took his hand, soothing his thumb over his knuckles. “Of
The drive back to the bunker was interminable, the heat between them boiling at a fever-pitch, Cas' hand tracing figures on the back of Dean's neck that raised goosebumps as he drove.
Cas slid into the passenger seat as Dean slipped behind the wheel. Dean glanced over and met his eyes, his breath catching as Cas' gaze dropped to his lips.
He wrapped a towel about his waist and wandered towards the stairs, just in time to hear Sam answer the door with a growl.
Cas helped him out of his pants and panties, the silk a lost cause, and kissed his way gently up Dean’s thighs. Well used to his lover’s gentle touch as well as his passion by now, Dean let his legs fall apart and Cas gave an approving noise as he wiped over Dean’s skin gently with the cloth. When he was as clean as he could be without a shower, Cas hauled him upright and peeled him out of his shirt. He let Dean fall back onto the pillows and helped him squirm under the blanket, which Cas balled up and chucked aside to deal with later. Tangling together under the sheet, Cas turned off the light before Dean managed to muster up his next words.
everywhere.
She reaches out for it almost guiltily. “Thank you.”
Tired of torturing himself with his memories, he gets out of bed and goes to take a shower, mindlessly turning on the water and undressing. He is there, but at the same time, he isn’t. Everything is a blur. He knows he’s doing something, but it doesn’t feel real. Nothing feels real anymore.
“He doesn’t get it from me, that’s for sure.” They both laughed on their way to follow their son.
Dean chuckled, “Well I couldn’t have made it without you, buzz, you did really good.”
“Move on,” he mumbles.
“Just even doing ‘the basics’,” he quotes, “Is a step in the right direction.” Dean doesn’t reply. He eats in silence, Sam watching him as he does.
After that surprisingly helpful therapy session, Dean needs a drink. They’ve run out of all the good stuff at home. He pulls into the first bar he sees, and it's a dive.
Again
“... No?”
Dean reached a hand around his husband and tickled Jack’s side, earning a cackle in response. “Morning, buzz.”
Dean doubts her, but he doesn’t say anything of it.
“Dean? What’s going on? Are you okay?”
“It hasn’t been a
He can see the stubble growing into a beard from where he has left it unattended. There are enormous bags under his eyes, discoloured with faint purples and browns. His face is skinnier, more sallow, and clearly uncared for. He stares at himself in disgust.
I just KNOW that dean would go into cas' room and just. sit there.
After spotting the flashing sign of a particularly enticing one, he pulls in the parking lot. Stepping out of Baby, he stops.
he joked as he grabbed the requested item. “Better?”
He guided his hands through it, but overall, it was pretty good. After they picked out the few shells that made their way in they mixed it all up, proud that they had an edible batter. Jack went to lick the spoon and try it before Dean stopped him.
Hours later, Dean has himself under control. Well, physically, at least. And even that’s strained. Mentally he’s screaming, crumbling, falling to pieces. No matter how much glue he tries to use, he can never stay together. One little thing can shatter him in the blink of an eye.
“Alright, well.” Dean claps his hands. “I’ll probably be out for a while so just call me if you need something, okay?” He looks at Sam, waiting for confirmation.
The dam finally breaks and the tide of tears rushes down Dean’s face, drowning him. “No. I didn’t. I just let it go on day by day, year by year, and I never
It was the finality of it all. Knowing that Cas loved him and Dean wanted to say it back, but it was caught in his throat. The words wouldn't come out no matter how hard he tried. It was seeing Cas get taken. Seeing him get consumed by the empty. Seeing him die for the umpteenth time.
“Alright, I uhm.” He clasps his hands together and looks down, focusing on his shoes. “I lost someone recently. And we were close, and I mean
He pulls his fist back, and seconds later, the mirror is shattered.
And, bless her heart, the woman in front of him is

“Your ‘usual’ is pretty fucking bad, Dean. So this?” He motions to the entirety of Dean. “Is

What?
“So?” Dean looks away and stares out the window.
He downs the first drink in seconds and fills it up again. And again. And again.
“Yep!”
He sobs though no tears came out. He considers that he might have run out by now. It feels like all he does anymore is cry. His body is so dehydrated he can't even cry. He needs to drink some water. He heads for one of the half-empty beers instead. He drinks it and the taste is gone, he can only feel it slide down his dry throat.
“Years,” he says simply. There’s no denying it now. “It wasn’t instant, I don’t think. More like it had just been building and building until it was just so intense that it just— hit me, I guess. It was like one day, he was like family, or that’s what I thought of him, at least.” He clears his throat, desperately trying to keep his tears in.
Another strangled sob escapes, leaving him shivering even though he isn't cold. He falls asleep hours later and is consumed by bittersweet dreams once again.
He hangs his head as he waits. At least he has enough sense to call Sam instead of risking driving Baby. He could be black-out drunk and would still know better than to drive Baby. He’d never put her in danger like that. It pains him to leave her in this parking lot, though. Yes, it’s safer than him driving her, but it’s still not ideal.
hoping --
“Coming, kiddo!” Dean shouted back.
The dancer shifts her head from side to side, tilting her neck. It reminds Dean of Cas. “Well, did you ever do anything about it?”
I'm a slut for dreams turning into nightmares sorry
“No, I don’t think you can.”
He punches the mirror again.
idea.”
“Sam?” Dean stumbles as he makes his way outside and sits on the curb.
Dean smiled. “Good job, that’s exactly what we need!” he exclaimed softly. “But we need a few other things too.” Jack nodded as they went through the cabinets to find everything else. Once they had all the ingredients, Dean placed them on the counter and grabbed Jack a stool to stand on so he could see what they were doing. “Alright, here we go.”
“Ok.” He helped pour everything into the bowl, smiling as he did so.
you know what I mean?” She nods. “Well, uhm- right before he uh… right before he left, he- he told me that he loved me?” It comes out as a question, as if he still can’t believe it.
“Fine. I’ll be there soon.”
He finds himself in a private room with a beautiful woman right in front of him. And he tries, he tries
She mulls over the question, “Then you’ll just have to live with it. You’ll have to try and get through life, doing what you can when you can. And that’s okay too.” She gives him a sincere smile and Dean is glad he came to the club.
He goes back to his room and drinks his coffee. He doesn’t finish it, leaving it on his desk instead. It goes cold.
"I'll find you. And until I do, I'll keep prayin'."

“Well,
“You look like shit.”
“You’re not into this right now. You wanna tell me what’s wrong? I won’t charge you for this, considering I’m not doing anything.”
The closet is always empty. He's checked it many times since Cas left. Every time he does he hopes there will be an extra trench coat or an extra tie, hell, even a shoe would be nice, just something of Cas' that he can touch, that he can
The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else, right?
Jack nodded fervently, “So good, momma, it’s delicious.”
“No, no, I’m still gonna pay you,” Dean insists. “You’re amazing, I just—“
He knew the answer was
“Exactly. Now, I’m not saying it’ll be easy. Lord knows it won’t. And, in all honesty, it’ll probably be one of the worst things you’ll have to go through. Being in love with someone that long and losing them is a big toll, but you have to remember what he would want for you.” She lays a comforting hand on his shoulder and Dean leans into her touch.
“Da! Momma! Hurry up!”
“Of course you can, buzz. C’mon.” He held his hands out and Jack jumped into them, allowing Dean to carry him. Cas sat down at the table, watching them fondly as Dean guided them around the kitchen. “First you need the ingredients. Do you remember any from last time?”
There are empty beer bottles on the desk next to the mixtape. Those are from Dean. His late-night drinking occurs in this room now. He knows that it only hurts him to come in here, but he can't help it. It's one of the only things he has left. The last trace of Cas he'll ever have.
She must’ve noticed because after one more impressively intricate spin, she stops and sits down at the edge of the stage.
We finally get sam's attempt at therapy fcbhkas
He hears Sam sigh. “Where are you?”
Dean trips over his own feet, nearly causing them to topple over. “Yeah, what’s new?”
“Uh… eggs! And flour! You need eggs and flour,” he stated confidently.
“Hmm,” he considered his wide range of options, his momma was always willing to make him food, one of the perks of having an amazing cook for a parent. “Pancakes!”
Dean looks at her, tears already pooling in his eyes. He gives in, needing to talk to someone who didn’t know the full story, someone who didn’t know Cas, and someone who wouldn’t say that they
“Did you love him back?”
Jack hopped onto the bed, “Wake up, Da! Wake up, Momma!” Despite the harsh startle, Cas laughed again.
The call is ended before Dean can give his thanks. “Bitch,” he mutters even though he knows Sam won’t hear him.
“Are you sure you wanna go out? You’ve kinda been cocooned in your room for, like, the past year.”
“I’m sorry I’m such a mess,” he apologizes, feeling embarrassed.
“I know that it hurts,” his confidant starts. “But, you have to think, what would he want for you? Would he want you to be stuck on him forever? Or would he want you to move on?”
“I need it. Like you said, I’ve been inside for too long. Gotta get out there and spread my wi—“ he cuts himself short, unable to finish the word. “Well, you know what I mean.”
The only thing that does, however, is the pain. The aching in his chest and the numbness in his mind. He can ignore them for a while, if only for a short period of time. But they always come back. He could be putting on his shoes and get hit with the longing and grief of losing Cas so intensely that it causes him to stop and abandon what he’s doing. He would sit there, drowning in his emotions for hours, unable to move, unable to do anything, unable to
“You don’t wanna do that, bud, it won't taste as good as the other ones.”
He sighs as he sits in the front seat, relishing in the familiar feel of the upholstery. Running his hands up and down the wheel, he groans, leaning forward and resting his head on his hands.
to be clear-- i have never been to a strip club or a bar chsjlmdz im really just going off movies and other fics at this point so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Of course we can. What d’you want?”
“Look, dude, are we gonna go home or are you just gonna keep trying to fuckin’ diagnose me?”
“He’s so hyper, I don’t know how he does it,” Cas sighed the sigh only dads can make as he got up and stretched before grabbing his robe and handing Dean his.
ugh, ANGST
Sam stares at the table, eyes unfocused. “Yeah. Yeah I get it.” He doesn’t say anything after that, just sits and twiddles his thumbs.
Dean opened his eyes and was greeted with one of his favorite sights. Cas-- his husband. That was another one of his favorite things. It was so much fun to say, the way it rolled off his tongue feeling so natural. ‘This is my husband Cas,’ he would say to everyone he met, always the first thing he stated.
I'm not gonna have access to my laptop over spring break so im just going to post this now, I havent written the next chapter so idk how long it'll be til the next update, but hopefully not too long :) enjoy!
He heard Cas chuckle, “I love you too, De-- oof!” He was cut off by a small crash to the chest.
He walks to Cas' room with apprehension flooding through his veins. He walks in and sits on the bed, there's a crumple of the sheets where he always sits. He stares around the room, empty except for a few things. There are little trinkets on the bedside table. Little bees and flowers that Jack got him. There are birthday cards on the wall, though nobody actually knows when Cas came to life so they just chose a random day.
“It’s okay, hun,” she interjects. “People come in here all the time just to have some company.”
“Ok, so what we’re gonna do next is add in the milk, eggs, and butter, ok?”
“What now?”
“How long?” She asks.
He walks in and plops himself down on a stool and motions for the bartender. “Whiskey. Double. Whatever’s strongest.” The barkeep nods and grabs what he’s requested before sitting it down in front of him. As he’s walking away Dean stops him. “Leave the bottle.” He does and Dean’s left alone again.
Dean nods as he takes a few steps backward before fully turning and making his way to one of his most prized possessions-- Baby.
but that doesn’t stop him from walking in. All he has to do is forget about Cas for a little while. Just something to distract himself from the pain.
“Good morning, Jack.” He took the child into his arms, cuddling him. “Did you sleep well?”
“A classic, for sure. Can’t go wrong with the classics, can we babe?” Dean asked as they all started climbing out of the bed.
“It’s very good,” Cas added, his plate nearly empty.
“And then the next, I knew I was in love with him. I
After he’s sure he’s scrubbed off at least 5 layers of skin off, body pink from the heat and distress, he steps out, grabs a towel, and stands before the mirror. He wipes a hand through the condensation on its surface. He looks over himself for the first time in a long time. It isn't just a fleeting glance like it usually is, no-- this one is a full-on inspection.
He pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket, fully intending to pay her full price and then some. She holds out a hand, “You don’t have to do that, really, it was a nice break.”
“It’ll get better, I swear.”
“Yeah, Dean, you can’t forget the syrup,” Cas teased, a small smile on his face.
“You’re not a mess, hun, you’re just grieving. And that’s perfectly normal. All you can do now is try and move on.”
Dean thinks. He chuckles bitterly. The thought of Cas lying beside him while reading invaded his mind and it only makes Dean feel worse.
“God, I hope so cause if I’m dreaming right now then I really won’t be able to handle this when I wake up.”
The closet is always empty. He's checked it many times since Cas left. It's always bare.
“No, no, I insist. You deserve it.” She looks at him hesitantly. “Please,” he begged, “Please, just take it.”
anything about it. And I just— I regret that
“And, yes, Sam, I want to go out.” Dean grabs his jacket off the rack, tugging it on. “I need it. Like you said, I’ve been inside for too long. Gotta get out there and spread my wi—“ he cuts himself short, unable to finish the word. “Well, you know what I mean.”
“Yes!” Jack jumped out and ran to the kitchen, too much energy for that time of morning.
“Yeah.”
It takes Sam a while to get there, but he finds Dean eventually. He looks disappointed as he gets out of the car to come and help Dean. He’s too drunk to care.
The bed smells like him. He never really slept in it, due to him being an angel, but he obviously laid in it from time to time.
“Oh,” Dean lets out a bitter laugh. “You have
It’s 3 am and Dean can’t sleep. He goes to the kitchen to try and get something in his stomach. He doesn’t know how long it’s been since he’s eaten an actual meal. On the days that he doesn’t come out of his room, Sam leaves a plate of food by his door. It sits there, uneaten until someone throws it out.
his mind reminds him.
“Yes!” Dean didn’t know what it was about kids that made them so excited to crack eggs, but they did, and Dean couldn’t help but indulge Jack. Just a little.
months!
gone!
and after that, it was all I could think of.”
it's been a little while so sorry :/ anyways,,, here's this :)
Sam lets out a long sigh as he starts the car. They don’t talk after that.
because no one did. Not really. So, he decides to talk.
Jack gave him a smile filled with food and it made Dean smile too.
And he can’t stop it.
“You’ve got this,” he mutters to himself. He’s tired of staying inside. It took him three weeks just to work up to this point. He’s finally ready to leave the bunker.
“Good morning, Dean.”
He drives for a long time, debating on where he should go. Motel, hotel, bar,
“No, Dean, I mean it.” The conversation gets paused as he helps maneuver Dean into the passenger seat. Once they’re both in the vehicle, Sam continues. “You’re worse than usual.”
