“Evidently!”, Sherlock returned the smile of his friend. He couldn't wait to get going, couldn't wait to feed his brain, couldn't wait to make an impression. Although he was aware he had already made  one. It was quite interesting that John was susceptible to what he was doing. And for what reason ever it felt good to see this reaction on him.
He felt tears well up in his eyes, tears of anger and betrayal.
Sherlock had to think a moment about the words he would choose to make John understand: "It was... like nothing and everything at the same time, relief, pain, excitement, power and fear..."
“you're the last one who has to be. You gifted me the few wonderful memories I have...“
“Maybe you should switch it on?”, John suggested.
John looked up at Sherlock's face, the hesitance and... Whirlwind of emotions that seemed to sweep across his face, John was beginning to pick up on little markers of what Sherlock was feeling, but only when he felt them strongly. The small crease above his eyebrow from worry, the crinkle under his eye from fear. Both were currently in use. He realised with a pang of guilt that he hadn't really taken in the words Sherlock had used to express his feelings. The one time Sherlock opened up, and he glazed over it to talk about bloody Moriarty and himself. It seemed that his narcissism was so large he was now subconsciously focusing on the subject of himself.
“So, what now, my not-expert?”, he grinned for he was, despite his nervousness, more happy than he had ever been before.
"No... No, It's ok, I'm going to bed now, so... Yeah." John said, unsure of what to say. Why didn't Sherlock pull him back? He wanted to hold him desperately, but after that little blip, he was hesitant to do that incase he appeared pathetic. Everything just felt awkward, why did it feel like that? Hopefully it was down to the situation, and the lack of sleep they had. Please pull me back, John thought, I'm sorry for misunderstanding... John turned around to go to the far side of the bed, he always slept on the left side, even when he was alone, he didn't know why, he just... Did. Perhaps it was his brain training him to be ready for when he could share a bed with someone he loved, and now he was.
“Jim Moriarty. He ambushed us”, Sherlock started to explain, told the story in their favor, “He decoyed us into a trap, set in the restroom and... John shot him in self-defence.”
Sherlock looked away now and he wouldn't turn his head for anything. Tears were starting to form in his eyes, caused by the words John expressed, he couldn't let him see that. He couldn't stand John being mad at him, especially because all he wanted was for him to be happy. Probably he should get him another girlfriend, somebody that would make him happy. There had to be somebody that would stay longer than the previous ones. Thinking of John with somebody at his side hurt badly, but he had to be happy.
"I love you too."
He felt back to himself, but he still wanted to be safe, and with Sherlock offering his support, it gave him some security.
"John..." He went for the hug now. He didn't care if he'd be pushed away. John needed this.
She inclined her head as acknowledgement, and rested back into the pillows, her energy spent. At least Harry took care of her, even if she didn't for herself. Her eyebrows lifted slightly. "So you're this Sherlock Holmes they mention on the box? Hmm... You look taller on the telly."
"Okay. This is not about me. Are you alright?" Sherlock would have felt bad if they would have discussed his bad social knowledge again while this was about John. He knew he wasn't alright. But he didn't know how else to ask.
He held his arms out to balance himself, and gradually left the support of Sherlock's torso behind him. It was like regressing back to his infant years of wobbling around on his chunky legs, trying to stay upright. Not that he can remember that, of course. Sherlock probably could. John managed to stand upright independently, now, all he had to do, was see if he could walk. An ache resided in his thighs, but it didn't threaten his stability. They had regained their confidence in themselves, or at least, they did while he was standing. He stared at the wall and inhaled deeply. The sense of anxiousness brought him back to his first day of army training, the fear and weight of every pair of tall, muscled eyes resting on his short, stocky physique. No.
Nevertheless he followed John into the bed. He was pretty sure now that he had made a mistake.
Of course Sherlock had noticed that John had wanted to touch his scar and he would have said something about it if his eyes had rested on it for longer. He knew that John was uncomfortable with Sherlock kissing his shoulder. Was he supposed to feel the same way about the scar? John's hand was a bit cold, but still he stayed silent. It was a miracle to lay next to him, in such a position anyway. "You're safe, I promise", Sherlock whispered and placed a kiss on John's head again.
John blinked as the male listened to him, able to feel his cheeks turning a burning red and he groaned, allowing his eyes to roll "Obviously im going to get changed! Wait... when on earth did you actually pay attention to what im wearing... scratch that, Dont answer" he said, cheeks still an embarrassed red as he turned away from him. John breathed in slowly, allowing his eyes to close as he calmed down his racing heart, able to feel it pulsing in his ears "Is there anything you need me to do before I go to get dressed?" He asked, finally allowing his head to turn so he could look over his shoulder at Sherlock "And drink your tea, it will be getting cold" he said firmly.
~ John's point of view~
"Not enough time.." John muttered, half to himself and half to Sherlock.
„Yes“, he replied with his brain being on autopilot. The most necessary things could be done like this, conversations that needed only 1% of his attention could be performed while he would still focus on what was really important. There surely was the danger that he could give answers that the one he talked to wouldn't acclaim to, but mostly he could avoid that and so the other person would think they had his attention.
“John, what are you doing?”, Sherlock asked in wonder, although he was happy about being close to him it was kind of surprising, too.
John travelled his lips down to Sherlock's, and felt the hot breath pour onto his neck as he moved from Sherlock's agape mouth. It gave John encouragement, was he responding to his hips? As a test, John made his hip rolls stronger against Sherlock's.
Sherlock: *looks back up at John* Alright then. You're right. I should have done this ages ago. I thought it wasn't the right time, and now it still isn't. But you're right John, as you're always right, these chances don't last forever. I know you just lost Mary, and I know you're not open for anything new yet...
"Oh yes, I remember, I remember now." John said. That felt like such a long time ago, like he was a different person.
Then they heard a cough from outside their stall. The man who had entered!
"No, no, I'm fine Sherlock," John sighed, nevertheless getting into the bed, "I think it was just the last drugs exiting my system."
Sherlock's heart got struck by an ache when John started to talk about his ex girlfriends. He knew that he was with him now, but still... it was a mix of hurt and jealousy. But he listened carefully anyway and understood why he had hurt his love.
"You know exactly what it means." John said before exiting Sherlock's embrace and standing up. "I'm going for a shower." He added shortly.
Sherlock didn't know how but his body longed for John and moved against him in a way. It made weird moves but he couldn't help it, so he ignored it and kept focusing on that intense kiss, on John's fingers in his hair and at his ear. How was his skin so sensitive that all of this sent waves of pleasure through him.
"The 'go fuck yourself' room, it's right next to the 'piss off' Bathroom." She said smiling, and in the process she put her middle finger up on her right hand, obviously still pissed off from the previous incident.
“It's complicated, John”, he started, “It's a cocktail of emotions and I can't really sort them all out... it's fear, excitement, helplessness... love.” For this last word he took a break and looked at John.
John looked into Sherlock's eyes, his wide pupils darting back and forth to make sure that he was indeed real. And not his mind playing tricks. Sherlock's hands mounded around John's face, the feel and the warmth that radiated from them... They had to be real. His chest felt light, as if his lungs had disappeared, but his heart had leapt up into his mouth, throbbing frantically. A cold sweat had broken out on his forehead. He collapsed into Sherlock's arms, chest caving in as his gave into the sobs forcing their way up his throat. He didn't let himself cry. "Don't leave me... Don't leave me..." John whispered, voice wavering.
John grinned as Sherlock handed the police ID over, nodding firmly before continuing to pull the detective out of the streets. "Its going to be a long drive" he said, eyes scanning the streets for someone who was parked but in their car. John hummed quietly and pulled out his gun from his back pocket, having spotted a fairly new car parked on the side of the road with the owner sat inside on his phone. John tightened his grip on the gun and used the end of the barrel to tap against the car "POLICE, OPEN THE DOOR" He shouted, pressing Lestrades ID up against the glass so the man could see but he kept the picture hidden with his finger. John smirked, feeling a buzz of excitement run through him as the terrified man got out of the car with his hands raised. "We need to use this car for a very serious matter, Step aside, It will be returned to you shortly" He said, Glancing over at Sherlock, motioning for him to get in and he made sure to keep his gun pointed at the male "Step away sir..." He growled before suddenly jumping into the car and slamming down the accelerator, Quickly driving away from the stunned male who still stood on the side of the road. John grinned, clearly breathing heavily as he threw his gun onto the back seat "Holy..I just stole a car!" He gasped, looking over to Sherlock
Sherlock covered the room's length in a matter of strides, and he was about to walk out of the door, when John caught a glimpse of his shoes put neatly on the mat.
When John finally was there Sherlock just let everything happen. He let John hold him, and when he saw his smile he just... he couldn't help but cry because it wouldn't be okay.
Sherlock was surprised by John's sudden words; he had only done what had felt right. He had had to support John. Was this how normal people worked? He shook off this thought and focused on what was happening. “You're welcome“, Sherlock said, and he didn't only because he had learned it as the common response to a phrase, but because he felt it. He'd never leave John's side.
They walked around a corner and could then see the River Thames. It was still possible to see where the police had taken the corpse out of the water and it would be very easy to find information here.
Sherlock: Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert to become randomly attached to-
Now Sherlock definitely couldn't keep his tears back. Those words that John uttered, wanting for him to come home, knowing him so well. All he wanted was to lean against his chest, be held, and be able to cry. He sobbed and tried that John wouldn't hear it. But he couldn't lie anymore.
Help me!
He avoided the topic of that... thing on purpose, because he didn't want to disgrace himself any further. John must have thought of him as an idiot already, which made Sherlock furious in a way, because these kinds of things simply had never mattered to him and he hadn't actually thought of the things that John's sister could have done. Why would he? It wasn't of any importance.
Sherlock saw John take some tissues out of the box, and the pang of guilt manifested itself. Why had he done that? It was all over John now! Embarrassment came crashing down on him and suddenly he felt uncomfortable. He craned his neck to watch John lean over.
Then he returned to reality. There couldn't be more, not until... yes. Moriarty again. He had to be defeated. That stupid sand case was no longer of importance. There must have been a way to provoke Moriarty, to make him leave the shadows. Sherlock couldn't wait no longer. The fight had to be fought, for John. He wanted to be with him. Yes, he was scared of loss, but he knew that John would never leave him, he'd fight until death. And death would be the only thing that could part them. So he had to defeat death.
When he finally got up he realized that he and John hadn't decided on a hotel to go to. They had been interrupted before they even had the chance to talk about it... But even if they had... Sherlock wasn't really in the mood for... what they had planned to do earlier. Not now. A hug would probably be nice... he didn't know why, but right now he really longed for John to take him in his arms and take care of him. To protect him.
"You know damn well what I just said..." John growled, a waver of emotion caused it to tremble.
When John didn't continue walking but kept standing in the hallway Sherlock was confused for a moment, but he could puzzle the pieces together. “So, are we going to your old room or do you have to ask Harriet for permission?”
"Ok..." He mumbled hesitantly.
“Then you surely have figured out by now what this really is about?”, Moriarty asked.
He then slowly lifted his head: “You didn't mean to come back...”
He sat down with a 'humph' and settled his cup down on the covered table with a solid thump. He looked up at Sherlock. The detective hadn't got much sleep last night, that much was evident from the bags developing under his eyes. He would've been worrying. That was one of his specialties, worrying. And it was John's job to worry about HIM.
"It's just the recent events have come down on me all at once. It's probably just my heightened emotions talking at the moment, and before you say anything, no, I am not letting you go off without me and no I am not letting you give yourself in to Moriarty."
John obeyed and increased his speed, which caused the bed springs to groan and creak. Sherlock didn't care, he was on the final stretch. As he felt it reach its climax, he panted heavily, before feeling himself topple into pleasure, a strangled moan escaped his open mouth. His member erupted onto John's stomach, spreading white seed across his tan skin. His eyes widened, it was like nothing he had ever felt before! Never had he experienced such physical enjoyment, yes he had felt it mentally, but that was nothing compared to the waves crashing over him!
John could feel his mind becoming sharper, his mind more alert. Yes, he felt like shit, but it was better than before, when he was nearly exploding from frustration. But, he would welcome a bed with wide open arms, and the chance to touch Sherlock again, perhaps not in an entirely innocent way... Oh, but they needed to make sure that he was ok first, that was obviously Sherlock's number one priority; making sure John was safe. He supposed, it was his priority also, after all, it was his own life. Maybe it was a one time thing...? Like a migraine or chickenpox. What was the time? John realised that he had lost all sense of that word since they stole the car, which they would have to return. It was quite disorientating, and he knew it would be hell to get back into the swing of sleeping nights and staying awake through days. He looked over to Sherlock. He had his eyes on the road, focused. Preoccupied? Worried? Most definitely.
Johns heart ached when he listened to the detective speak. The male swallowed carefully and he shook his head, Slowly coming to a stop "No... no im not doing this" he breathed, slowly looking up at Sherlock with sad eyes "In all honesty Sherlock, I was expecting that we would be spending time together, not just bloody investigating this case"he said, clenching his fists and glancing away from him "Go enjoy your deductions, im staying here" he said firmly, looking up at Sherlock with angry and hurt eyes "I dont want to get wet" he lied, glancing away from him before sighing "Just come back here when you are finished looking" he said, stepping back away from the detective before turning away from him, ignoring the burning pain in his chest, tears filling his eyes "I dont know what I was expecting.." he grumbled and stepped away
"We need a plan."
No time or reason to think about that now. He had to act like he didn't understand, like he didn't know what was going on. So he just walked down to the river. It would be hard to focus now that all he could think about was John's pain and it felt like his own heart was a mirror to his companion's. But John would be safe and that was all that mattered.
So, no breakfast. But that wasn't too surprising anyway. Maybe we could get something to eat while going to Scotland Yard. I knew I couldn't stop Sherlock from going, so I would simply have to join him. But I would make him some tea. Mrs. Hudson couldn't as she was in hospital now. He surely would work on something while I would get dressed and that was easier with a nice hot cup of tea.
“No need for that now”, Sherlock ripped the paper to pieces, “I have the real thing. I've got work to do.”
The pain, the noise, everything, he begged it to go away. God, please! He curled up on the floor and buried his head to his knees. Just make it stop! Kill him, make him unconscious, just anything! His teeth sang. The pain was somehow increasing, John was bordering on blacking out.
John looked over to him and gave him a gentle smile "Ah.. Boys right?" He asked, tilting his head to the side and studying his face for a few moments "Is that why you walk about in a sheet all the time? Trying to draw me in?" He asked, a small smirk on his lips and his cheeks turned a slow pink colour. He rested back into the chair and sighed "We are just going to a cafe, it will be nice" he said, the male clearly in a far better mood compared to before, his heart pounding as he thought over his feeling for Sherlock, licking his lips slowly before chuckling, shaking his head "Ahh... Emotions" he said simply, glancing across to him. "Ever loved someone Sherlock?" He asked
"Do you think we can move to the bed now?" He whispered lowly, making sure that he breathed deeply.
“I did it so I wouldn't have to deal with those tedious farewell rituals”, I replied knowing that it was only partly true. John would have shouted at Mycroft, how he could possibly let it happen, He would have shouted at me, how I could possibly go, how I could listen to the bloody words of my brother. There would have been a lot of shouting and although it was a part of him that I tended to enjoy for some reason, I wanted his smile to be the last thing I'd see of him.
The detective winced as the sudden touch interfered with his far off thoughts and gave him a fright. John, of course. “Yes?“, Sherlock replied and tried not to show that he had actually gotten a fright.
Sherlock: Now you do.
The deep moans of pleasure that emanated from Sherlock's mouth kept John at it, and whilst inside his heart was pounding hard, on the outside his lips were being soft and gentle... Two extremes in one body, mentally and physically. Sherlock's obvious state of arousal made John quiver with enjoyment, both of them were satisfied with what they were doing.
“Oh Sherlock! Time is passing, tick, tock, tick, tock, but is it a clock?”
“I don't know what is wrong”, he continued, trying to calm him down, trying to find suiting words, but he had never been good at that, “But please, please don't be like that.”
“As I said, Moriarty's back.”
John felt the slight brush of Sherlock's stiff member against his leg as the detective lowered himself down beside him so that they were lying next to each other, legs intwined. His hairs stood on end from the shiver of pleasure that ran through him, he imagined Sherlock on top of him, riding him, the feeling of...No, none of those thoughts tonight. If Sherlock didn't want that sort of love at the moment then John would respect his feelings. John rested his upper body on top of Sherlock's chest. Throughout all of this, their lips never broke contact. He secretly wished that he could take his underpants off, they were.... Restricting. His hands cupped Sherlock's face and he kissed him harder to blank his mind from any selfish or mood-wrecking thoughts. They moved up into his dark hair and teased the curls. It was soothing to John, he pulled gently, so that it wouldn't hurt Sherlock's scalp.
"Do you want to be top or bottom?"
“That you can't tell your henchmen to kill me or my companions anymore? Yes, tears me apart in fear”, Sherlock replied and sat down on the chair in front of the laptop. I walked towards him and stood behind him then, my hand always on the gun in my bag.
She didn't move.
"Right..." Sherlock replied and let John go. He was looking at him and had no idea what to say or what to do. Comforting... he wasn't an expert in comforting...
"Maybe." He giggled slyly, trying to suppress his grin, and failing to do so.
He bit his lip when the talk went to John's uniform. It was an image he deeply admired and... and John was aware of it! If he wouldn't use that against him he would be... kinda disappointed. And he did use it! Sherlock was speechless for a few seconds after the words his soldier had spoken.
"We went from London to my mother's, stayed the night, woke up mid-day, went downstairs, sat down to talk about our plan and I collapsed." John reeled out the past events tiredly.
“A very tired genius who just had a nice distraction by his boyfriend“, Sherlock sighed and let himself sink to the bed again, but he sat a bit away from John.
There was no reply. I entered the living room; he sat in his armchair.
Then he left the restroom and closed the door behind him. People were already approaching him, but he stopped them by lifting his hand. “Please, stay calm everybody. My partner and I” John had followed him and opened the door just in the right moment, “are from the police. More officers will be here soon. I recommend to leave the building immediately.”
Sherlock looked down on John lovingly as he leaned against him and decided to put an arm around him. This must have been the right thing to do, as Sherlock had wished for the same thing earlier. So he held John now and hoped that it would make him feel better.
"What are you trying to tell me?" He whispered.
Sherlock took a deep breath. He didn't want to pick a fight. Not with John, not as they were so happy. "We have to stop him once and for all." He had used the we on purpose. They would have to do it together. Not only because John wouldn't let him do it alone, but because he would be lost without him.
He lifted the list of drugs Sherlock had taken. It was more of an accusation, although Mycroft would have actually been glad about anything that could keep his little brother from a relapse.
“You remember what happened so far? Prepared Baker Street and the restaurant? Especially the restaurant...”
When he had closed the door behind him he leaned against it for a little bit and took a deep breath. It was just all too much, he had to think about everything now. Have some quiet time for himself.
When he looked up again John had already placed himself on the bed and looked at him expectingly. It was very tempting. How often had he imagined this and now the moment was here. Sherlock climbed into the bed awkwardly, then he looked at John.
"This might have very well killed you!", Sherlock raised his voice unwillingly and looked at John now though, his eyes were mirroring how desperate he really was, "I know what pain my... death... had caused you, and I can only admire the strength you had, surviving all that time... because I don't think that I would...if I ever... lost you..."
"Well, that's what we're here for!" She said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes, John could tell that she didn't just mean it in a joking way, "Will you be needing a room with single beds or, a double one?"
“Sherlock, there's no body here”, Lestrade said who stood behind him, “What has happened?”
Sherlock smiled at the cute faces John were making, trying to move but he couldn't. So he just pulled him over and held him in his arms. Sherlock carefully stroked John's wonderful hair and holding him like this... he knew that he belonged to him. That he was his alone. "I'm yours too", Sherlock whispered and placed a soft kiss on John's head. He would fall asleep any moment, if he hadn't already. And Sherlock would soon, too, eventually.
“Oh I believe you, Mr. Watson, I do”, Jim purred, “But don't you think I would come in here with an insurance?”
“Yes, of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?”
“Where's the key?”, I wheeled around and looked to every corner of the kitchen. No key...
Sherlock followed John outside, then he took the lead. The touch let a warm shiver run over him and he wondered what that had been.
Sherlock stroke over John's arm carefully, then he nodded, "Alright. No hospital, I think that's for the best. You can't get up, but do you think I can lift you?" He had talked kind of fast as John's words had fastened his pulse and had the blood go into his head. He was all that he wanted now. To just lay there with him. It was... a good feeling to be needed, to be loved.
John's thoughts probably were fixed on the case of the house, how his mother could give it to him and how he had never visited her in all these years, touched by the loving and praising words that she uttered. Sherlock on the other hand had found another aspect to be quite interesting: The behaviour of John's mother. She loved the adventure as well as her son did, and her using the word 'boring' let Sherlock at least lift an eyebrow.
"Yes."
Sherlock watched John attentively. His tears slowly became less and less and his body seemed to calm as well. Seeing this burst of emotions on his love hurt the detective, he knew that by now as he had observed his own emotions during the last minutes, but it didn't let him think bad of him. He was just sorry that this was his fault in a way, and John being able to show emotions was part of why he loved him. He was, and Sherlock didn't know a better word for it, "alive". Not as cold as ice, but highly emotional, be it anger, sadness or joy. John had all those emotions in him and the way he showed them was not only interesting, it was also heartwarming.
"I am.." he said, "But I don't want to shoot you again." He whispered.
Sherlock took a deep breath before he entered the apartment. He didn't know what would await him in there and it scared him. He even feared that John could have collected the things that were the most important to him and had left... For god's sake, that had been exactly what Sherlock had wanted! So why couldn't he simply accept it?
John swallowed nervously as he watched his detective rush from the room, the doctor able to feel a slight ache in his heart as he was left in his bed by himself. "God... Its like waking up after a one night stand... They just rush off" he grumbled miserably, hearing the shower switch on. John shook his head and slipped out of the bedsheets, deciding he would act normal and do what he did every morning, make tea. The male pulled on his dress robe and made his way outside, doubt beginning to settle in his mind as he wondered whether Sherlock had regretted the night before. And quite frankly, John was fairly hurt at the detectives quick disappearance. John made the pair a cup of tea each before taking a hold of his own, making his way over to where his chair was positioned in the living room. John knew that this was all new to Sherlock, and that what they had done the night before would lead to there being a greater risk of Jim attacking, capturing and possibly killing John. He slowly closed his eyes as he tried not to think of it, sipping at his tea carefully before allowing his eyes to snap open when he heard Sherlock open the bathroom door "i made you tea Sherlock... Its on the kitchen counter" he called to him
“Careful!”, he said, ready to hold me if I would fall out of the bed. What an interesting coincidence. John would catch me if I fell. Didn't he always?
Sherlock moved slightly, insecure if he should hug John or not, and kept his hand in the air, still thinking about it. He didn't know if he'd want to be touched or not.
I opened the door and started to look around immediately. If there was a bomb or something (yes, the organisation Moriarty didn't want to kill me, but that didn't mean they wouldn't hurt me or John) I had to find it before we'd get hurt. They surely have put some hints for me, and they also left some they didn't know of. But many things seemed to be just normal. The books on my shelf were all in the same order as before, the pictures on the wall and the armchairs haven't been moved, John sat in one of them, the lamps were just as I had left them and... John? John was back here! Memories came back to my mind, memories of all the great times we had, and each one started with us sitting there... and now he did again. I felt like in one of those flashbacks I had watched over and over again in my mindpalace, but this time it was different. It was real! But it somehow felt surreal too. I was tended to touch him to know I wasn't fantasizing... what was the big deal about it anyway? He would just think about it as part of my method, another freaky quirk of mine. So as I moved on walking through the room, I slightly brushed his shoulder with my hand and wanted to let go and continue as I realized what was different. One of my laptops stood opened on the table. It was still switched of, but I know I hadn't placed it there, so it must have been some of Moriarty's henchmen. Before I let go, I shortly felt John's hand on mine, as he asked in a tone I interpreted as worry: “Sherlock, what's wrong? Have you found something?”
Sherlock considered himself married to his work. And it was true. He loved our investigations, he didn't even try to hide his excitement (which I admired so much) at all. So if there was something that could drag his attention away it was a case.
Sherlock: Him.
“Hand me the newspaper! Now!”, I shouted, barely able to keep standing, my balance getting worse and worse.
John had reached the third door in the hallway when he began to experience....inconveniences with his trousers, walking became harder. The buildup to getting into the room was making his insides tingle with excitement. He wanted Sherlock right there, in the hallway wall even, but his legs would not allow him. Their room was the next door along so it wouldn't be long to wait. Sherlock had disappeared into the room already, and had left the door wide open for him. When John was standing in the doorway, he could see that the lights were still off, perfect for an ambush. He looked around, feigning confusion at the lack of a Sherlock in the room.
Mary: I think you know, John
John: *looks at him with knitted brows*
At once, Harry's eyes lost all of their concern, and she turned in the doorway, flicking her gaze over John with an air of disinterest. She waltzed back into the living room, saying over her shoulder. "All of that noise, just for some headache? Just take some goddamn aspirin instead of giving everyone else a sore head."
Moriarty took a gun out of his pocket and pointed it at John; he walked around them slowly, just like a predator surrounding his prey.
John smiled slightly as he watched the male before his eyes widened as the detective broke down in his arms. He felt an ache in his chest and he pulled him in close, wrapping his arms around him tightly before nodding "Yes Yes, That's fine... We can head back to the flat, it will be much better" he muttered, slowly taking a hold of Sherlock's hand before making his way slowly towards the main road to where a taxi would pick them up "Everything will be okay Sherlock... I promise" he whispered into his ear, gently kissing his cheek before trying to flag down a taxi, keeping his lover in as close as he could, wanting to comfort him.
John scratched the nape of his neck.
"Right then." John sighed, readying himself for the walk down the hallway.
"The.. blood? What blood, John?", Sherlock asked and kept his eyes on John. Seeing him in this state was horrible.
Sherlock: What?
John nodded slowly as he listened to him before letting out a slow sigh "Get some rest then... Its going to be a long ride" he whispered, slowly gripping on to the steering wheel of their stolen car before turning off down onto the motorway, Getting out of London as quickly as they could. John had a plan, Somewhere safe they could go... Away from Moriarty. John rubbed his eyes and glanced out the window, Looking at London one last time before pressing down the pedal to speed away.
John nodded his head. "Yeah, I want to know what's going on in your mind palace, all these little feelings you file away, tell me them."
The pain... God, The pain was unbearable, it was like his skull was being split in half! It filled his entire head, and made it impossible think about anything else. Claws were scaring his mind, clenching down on his brain. He could hear his heartbeat smash around his mind, the thudding only worsened the pain. What was this?! Make it stop! He tried to open his eyes, but the light was blinding and felt like it was frying his corneas. Black spots had swarmed his vision. In the short time he had them open however, he could see a black Sherlock-shaped blot next to him in his vision. Sherlock! He swatted his arms around to try and find the solid side of Sherlock. The pain grew with each moment his head didn't have anything pressed against it. Soon, a pressure built up in his face. He let out a broken sob. From somewhere near him, he could hear Sherlock's greatly muffled voice, panicked and loud. The ringing blocked most of it out, it drilled into his head. Make it stop!
The hotel looked significantly older than when John had first entered it, which was with one of his previous lovers, a relationship that was as long as a butterfly's life span, but it was a good memory nonetheless. It would make things slightly awkward for John.
Sherlock lay his head back unknowingly and let out another moan, this touch of John's sent pure excitement through all of him. it was his body reacting now, not his mind. This wasn't only a movement of enjoyment, it also granted John better access to Sherlock's neck if he wanted to continue. And Sherlock wished he would continue. His breathing had fastened and deepened and was accompanied by deep tones that escaped his lungs, showing how much he loved this.
“John, you have no idea how boring it is here. Harry keeps me cooped up in the house like some sort of rare specimen whilst she goes out every night to some bar to keep herself hydrated with beer and wine. I know she's waiting for me to die, so she can take the house as soon as I stop breathing." She grumbled, glaring away at the sides of her bed. "Too bad, I'm giving the house to my only child who isn't a walking beer bottle." That would be John, and this would be his first time hearing of this news. He blinked in surprise.
I opened the cupboard to get the cups, but there was something strange. A piece of paper looked down on me. “Forward to John” it said... That confused me. I opened another door of the cupboard, and it was the same there... and the same in all the other ones... in the last one I found a letter.
She took a visible gulp, and remained hovering in the door frame. "What the fuck happened to John?"
"I believe it was my own muscles that caused me to pull the trigger."
“I haven't been talking about you. There are ghosts way more dangerous, laying further in the past. People who were able to do things you couldn't even imagine. Compared to them you are just... boring!”
“You know me so well, honey”, Moriarty smiled, still holding the knife against John's throat, but they had made some steps towards me, “Continue, if it pleases you.”
Sherlock wasn't even able to speak. He looked at the ash, human ash obviously, but it was impossible that it was Jim's burnt body.
Fear spread on top of his pain.
Emptiness. Sherlock's mind was completely empty. Did... did he just...? Did he hear correctly? No. No it couldn't be. He imagined things. His mind was playing tricks on him again. Or could it be the truth? It was. He hadn't taken anything. He had heard what he had heard. Sherlock had to repeat that in his mind to make it clear. John loved him. He loved him. Love. How could anybody love him? Who cared? John did! Or didn't he? Of course he did, he had just said so. It was impossible for Sherlock to have a clear thought.
Sherlock thrummed his fingers on the table. He was getting impatient. What if John wouldn't understand and he had just ruined whatever was about to be built between them? No. John was smart. He would come.
“Please tell me what you would like me to do”, Sherlock said breathlessly when John had taken off his jacked and opened his shirt, as he wanted to return to John what he was doing for him. He wanted to give him some pleasure, too. And he really had a thing for his commands.
Chapter 1 The Game is on
He looked at John first, like he was checking if this really was what he wanted, then he leaned over to his neck and placed his lips on the soft skin. He started to kiss it gently, carefully, but did it more intensely when John demanded more. Sherlock bit it carefully and sucked on the skin, doing his best to please his captain.
"I told you... John, I told you that I wanted to keep you out of this... you will only get hurt if you're with me."
Just as quick as the nausea came, it was gone again, and left John feeling ever so slightly dizzy. He stood up from his hunched position, pressing his hand against the wall. He must've been quiet enough not to disturb Sherlock, which said something. Sherlock was like a bat sometimes. John wiped his lips and took a large sip of water to flush out the taste. He moved it around his mouth before spitting it into the sink. After that, he quickly got dressed back into his clothes, like nothing had happened, and walked back into the room.
"Oh so what?! Do you think I care? After all, he inherits fucking everything in THIS GODDAMN FAMILY ANYWAY!" She screamed, spitting in his face.
"Why, because I'm only your helper?" John muttered bitterly.
Sherlock continued talking, probably his voice could calm John a bit... although he doubted it. He had seen it somewhere before but as he himself who usually was so controlled had gone through hell already, he couldn't even imagine what John was going through especially because he was affected directly.
"You're stronger than you think, and anyway, I'm here now, aren't I?" John looked reassuringly into Sherlock's eyes, he patted his hand softly, "Now, can you come and help me walk? I don't think I can quite stand by myself yet."
I shook my head and went to the kitchen, well, if you could still call it kitchen. Not much had changed since I had moved out, except that Sherlock had gotten himself even more equipment for his... experiments. I was almost scared to open the fridge, anything could await me in there. I opened it but... it was empty. Of course, Sherlock had wanted to leave. Keeping anything in there would be ridiculous. Although six months were nothing... He surely could have found an experiment that could have taken that long...
“Stay with me! For god's sake, Sherlock! Stay with me!”
John watched Sherlock as he swiftly put his suit jacket over his arms in one graceful move. He noted how his body twisted, the tug of the shirt on his torso. He felt a sense of pride come over himself at the sight of his boyfriend (if he could be called that) and the comforting thought that he was his, and only his. They really seemed to be an odd couple, but John didn't care. Harry slammed on the door again. "Come on! Hurry the hell up!" She shouted. Someone had a bad hangover then.
He had noticed Sherlock's little smile, and felt his cheeks redden with slight embarrassment, and happiness. Sherlock hadn't objected to him potentially leaning against him, was this progress?
"And don't think I haven't noticed that you like being commanded by such a... strong soldier”, Sherlock heard John say and blushed immediately. He knew his most guarded secret now, but if he wanted to share it with anyone, it would be John. As the soldier suggested putting on his uniform, Sherlock couldn't help but imagine it, and he couldn't get that image out of his mind anymore. It was the most attractive thing he could think of.
He liked what John looked like though, it was kind of cute.
John felt a smile stretch his lips and he shook his head, chuckling quietly.
“Yes“, Sherlock replied and looked at John, looked at him carefully, observed his features to kill the horror with beauty.
"John..." How did this happen again?
John found it adorable how embarrassed and inexperienced Sherlock was with this side of him. A teenager, unsure of what or how to do this. It was like he was just discovering his own body, a mystery he had never explored before. John placed his hands on the sides of Sherlock's face and lifted it up to his eye level. He pressed his forehead against Sherlock's whilst maintaining his beautiful gaze.
Blowing a hole in my life, Eastern wind,
"Yes, you think I don't know that?" John chided, clenching his fist, "But why did you change subject so quickly? I was on about Harry yelling at us, not bloody Moriarty. And what did you mean by 'you know you can't'?" John was thoroughly confused, Sherlock's mood had gone from good to bad in a snap. Honestly, he was a little wary, scared even, of this sudden change.
Sherlock enjoyed cleaning John, he could have a look at every centemeter of him again, the wonderful perfection he consisted of! John was such a handsome man... He then went and got a towel. He dried John. Then he climbed into the bed and under the cover himself. Now, what position should they have? Could he just.. go to John and.. well, lay on him in a way? Or... hug him? Or what should he do?
“I simply don't like people treating you badly, that's all”, Sherlock replied, still staring down at his sleeves. Of course he could have ignored her like he usually did with basically everyone, but this was different, it was personal, it offended John. And he couldn't just let that through. Mess with him? Call him a freak? It hurt, like it would hurt everybody, but it was acceptable. Hurting John on the other hand was inexcusable.
“No, John, don't say that”, Sherlock said in shock about the words, “You can't die. You have a life here, with or without me, you can't do that...”
John frowned slightly in hesitance, and made a doubtful noise. He didn't feel comfortable falling asleep, much less in a car miles away from any hospital. But, he was so tired.... He felt on the brink of tears from his frustration.
"We should go downstairs." John said calmly, although he made not attempt to remove himself from Sherlock's side.
John's smile spread into a grin.
Sherlock had sat down at a corner in the very back of the restaurant, where most people wouldn't see him, but John would know that he was there, smart John. He would come. Although Sherlock would never doubt his intellect, John was driven by emotions too much, ordinary, beloved John. And those emotions could stand in his way when it was coming to understand, to remember the cameras. But Sherlock had explained it in the message. If he hadn't understood, he would as soon as he got it. But what if he wouldn't read it? If he was so mad, so broken that he wouldn't open the message?
“It would be for the best if we didn't”, he said and saw the sadness reappear to John's eyes, so he added: “But if we found a secret place in which it would be impossible for him to attend then I don't see a reason why we shouldn't.”
Sherlock had come out of the car more calm than before. He hadn't slept, but his mind had drifted far away and that had calmed him down in a way. He had been able to think about everything properly while he had banished the thought of the possibility that even this car they were in could have been attacked.
I arrived at the door that now was spread all over the floor in small splinters. I sighed with relief as I saw her leaned against the wall, covered in some pieces that used to be protective pillows before, and like a miracle she wasn't injured but coughing.
“Like her, the receptionist“, he replied and made a move with his head to the woman.
Sherlock jumped up the second John had left the room, barely able to contain his excitement. He rushed to the coat rack, grabbed his coat and scarf, put it on. To the kitchen, where he grabbed a few things and stuffed them in his pockets. His view fell on a tray which he took to check his looks. He ran his hand through his hair to rearrange it. Not that he was interested in anybody's opinion on his looks, but they were one of the many ways to manipulate a person. Maybe he'd need to do that. Also John... steps on the floor. He was returning already! Sherlock dropped the tray immediately and ran back to the front door. He arrived just in time and the second John entered the room he turned up his coat collar and watched the reaction from the corner of his eyes.
"Though, it's probably because of John, bless him, he's got my short height but his father's tall attitude." She laughed, a wheezing sound.
Sherlock: Why?
It took about 2 hours to reach John's safe place, which took the form of a small house in a country town. It was situated in a normal street, with normal people who had normal lives, something Sherlock and John didn't posses. Through the darkness of the night, bright lights shone through the clean windows of the house, which, to the relief of John, meant that someone was home. He pulled up into the driveway, and hopped out of the car quickly, Sherlock seemed to follow suite. John was on edge. He was certain that they were safe here, but paranoia still whispered to him at the back of his brain. It was like his mind was working at triple speed, ideas and thoughts branched from one another. He wondered whether this was what Sherlock's mind felt like, constantly crowded and restless. The urge to hold Sherlock was unbearable, he wanted to please him, to calm him and to soothe him. Anything to get him to feel safe from Moriarty, even if it was rough sex or foreplay. At this point, he just wanted to forget about everything. He skipped over to the side door on the house, and knocked gently. In between all of his panic and agitation, there was a slither of hesitance. He hadn't been to this house in years, the people inside had nearly faded away to ghosts in his memory, washed away by life with Sherlock. He felt the presence of the detective behind him. The man was breathing harshly, and although he was silent, John could tell that the alarm bells in his mind palace were blaring. God, how he just wanted to kiss and hold him right there on the brick wall... He turned his head around to talk to him, but as he opened his mouth, the door in front of him opened, and he whipped back around. That little slice of hesitance grew until it was all he could feel. In the door's entrance, stood a young, blonde woman. John let out a shuddered breath, and a silent exchange of words were said between them. She glanced over at Sherlock, before returning her cold eyes to the doctor.
Moriarty knew what they were doing. He knew that they had admitted their feelings for each other. He had seen what they had done. How would it simply be possible to win against him? He was a superpower, the storm at the harsh sea and Sherlock and John just a small boat that he wanted to see on the ground of the ocean.
John's eyes narrowed as the male stepped forwards, the doctor flicking the safety off the gun before adjusting his grip slightly "I swear to god, I am not afraid to shoot you, Moriarty" he growled at him, cracking his neck before glancing across to Sherlock who was just watching Jim, completely unsure of what to do.
John's heart almost jumped out of his mouth when he heard Jim's voice echo within the bathrooms. He instantly removed his hands and looked up at Sherlock, meeting eyes with him and giving him a soft smile of reassurance "It will be okay" he whispered to him alone before he quickly did up his own shirt, being sure to keep the top collar undone so that Moriarty could see the marks Sherlock had left from kissing and nipping his neck. John sorted out his own hair before turning to the door, watching Sherlock open it first and John followed him out, arms crossed as he stood next to his lover, patting his coat pocket briefly to make sure he had his gun
Sherlock created a timeline in front of his eyes. He noted the events that John mentioned on it. “Let's see... London was too long ago, that can't be it. When you collapsed it was already too late...“ he deleted those dates and zoomed in on the timeline.
“ 'Morning, where's the corpse? No time to lose, the case is incredibly exciting!”
“Mrs. Hudson!”, I screamed, running towards the door we had found her behind before. Why hadn't we freed her when we had had the chance to?! Why had we listened to that lunatic?! “Mrs. Hudson!”
"Have I been asleep when you weren't some time? Did you eat anything I didn't?" He added silently "Am I just used to the drug...?"
“I probably should tell you what made me feel like... that. What made me lose control. As you're asking to share my thoughts and feelings with you. I just don't want to endanger or scare you more than necessary.”
“Are you sure? Maybe you should...”
It indeed was a surprise to the detective. He made those mistakes over and over again, hurt people without even knowing that he did and only knowing that he did by their reaction afterwards. But to hear those words from John... it brought the exact happiness that he had described earlier to his heart and also his face, for he couldn't stop the smile that started to form itself. It was a slight, weak, fallen smile. What was the suitable answer to those words? He didn't know. Anything he'd say would come out either stupid, provoking or saddening. Wouldn't he be holding John already he would have hugged him. Being close to him seemed to be the right solution. "Thank you for that, thank you for being with me although you know what kind of arse I can be...", Sherlock said quietly, but still with the slight smile.
Suddenly we heard screams from downstairs. Choked cries, like through a gag, behind a door. Mrs. Hudson!
He took in deep breaths as his chest grew heavy. "My, my sister tried to kill me.... She tried to kill me!" He said, voice breaking slightly.
John:
John: I'm gonna make a deduction.
John couldn't help but feel regretful for making Sherlock feel awkward, he didn't say anything but it was written on his face plain as day. The way he avoided John's eye, the gripping of his hands and the biting of his lips were all signs of an embarrassed Sherlock. It was clear that he didn't like to be embarrassed by his lack of knowledge in the whole sex area, but he needed to know why they couldn't stay in that room. John wanted to hug him and apologise, but at the same time he didn't want to apologise. One thing was certain; he wanted to hold Sherlock, not intimately, but in a completely innocent way, like how elderly couples do. They had been through a lot, and John hadn't felt the reassuring warmth that emanated from Sherlock's bare skin, it was his soother. In the house, there were only 3 bedrooms, so it wasn't rocket science to figure out which one was the spare room, aka John's old one. John opened the room and was greeted with a woosh of dusty air, something Sherlock would find comforting. "Here we are." John sighed, trying to elevate the awkwardness between them. He wondered whether the bed had any covers on it, and luckily for them it did, big thick things that could probably squash you like a slab of Tarmac. He felt Sherlock shuffle in beside him, and the silence indicated that he was either observing his surroundings, or silently expressing his distaste for the room. John turned around to face the detective, who kept his gaze to the floor. His eyebrows knitted together with regret, and he couldn't take it anymore. John wrapped his hands around Sherlock's waist, underneath his warm coat, and pulled himself towards Sherlock, burying his face into his chest. Damn his height....
“I'm sorry...”, he said, several times actually, “John, I should have told you earlier, I'm so sorry...”
Sherlock was helpless. He had never experienced anything like this before... Well, John had broken down earlier.. yes of course! Long term consequences of a drug. They had caused a nightmare for John. One that was frightingly real. "I'm not ever leaving you, John. I'll stay with you forever", Sherlock said and held him, he carefully ran his hand over his arm, tried to calm him with his touches. "I'm here, can you feel this? I'm carressing you. I'm here. I'm with you John and I will always be. I love you."
"I have no idea", Sherlock replied in all honesty. He had thought of something, yes, but it was ridiculous. "I thought of a motel, but how on earth am I supposed to get you in there? Whoever the owner might be, I surely cannot just carry you inside."
I couldn't help it but walked into the room and sat down next to Sherlock on the bed. I placed one hand on his shoulder very carefully. I didn't want him to wake up, he had to rest. But I needed to be this close to him now. He would never know, and I would have the insurance that he was still here. I looked at him. He was such an astounding man. Always a fighter, surviving somehow.
He was relieved that there was an elevator, he wondered what would've happened if there weren't. Sherlock would have probably carried him, scooped up again. The thought put a faint smile on John's face, which widened as he thought of himself carrying Sherlock that way, it was a ridiculous image.
No, don't think about that. Focus on the fact that you are still here, with Sherlock, don't be such a wimp!
John heard the muffled distorted voice of Sherlock beside him, and nodded absent-mindedly, anything to make himself feel normal, or give the expression. He felt cold.... Like the warmth had left him a cadaver, ready for dissection by Mr. J Moriarty, the napoleon of crime. Today's focus: the brain. If you press on this bit here, you can induce fear, pain, and even kickstart a mental breakdown if you're lucky. It seemed that Moriarty had a natural flair for causing all three of them. John had gotten over the first hurdle: shock, and was making a quick journey to the second: realisation. Realisation was like a cancer, it set deep in your body, and ate it's way towards guilt. It turned your bones to ice, hard and brittle, ready for guilt to come along and break them. For John, it bared resemblance to the frog and boiled water experiment. If you place a frog in water, and gradually heat it, the frog's body adapts to the temperature, until ultimately, it boils to death before it realises what was happening. Realisation was growing, heating up like the water. But John was still cold. John was cold, like the man in the bathroom. Only, John was still living.
John shrugged.
Sherlock still knelled next to John when he stopped wincing. His first thought was that this was his end.. which he wouldn't accept just like that. But John was still breathing. He was breathing. Breathing meant: Alive. "John...", Sherlock said and pulled him closer to him, pulled him on his lap and held him tight. It was only when a tear fell down on John that he realized that he was crying.
He could walk, but the ache limited his speed. A tortoise, gradually ambling along at its own pace, that's what he was, at least, at the moment. Sherlock glided into the elevator beside him and pressed number two on the buttons. The doors shut with a slight scrape. The familiar feeling of going up settled in John's abdomen, and he leant back on the pole lining the elevator, it was cool on his spine. From the corner of his eyes, he saw Sherlock watching him with interest and affection. John couldn't stop the small smile from appearing on his face and crescendoing with a chuckle. They were like teenagers all over again. Heat rose to his cheeks and he felt himself start to blush.
