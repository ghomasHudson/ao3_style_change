“Frankly, I don’t care what you do with your free time”, Cas says, his tone getting snappier like it always does before a fight.
at the altar”, Dean shoots back, gesturing at his very sexy, even if very homey look of a t-shirt and a pair of college pants. He squints up at him, when Cas doesn’t answer, “Would you
Longer hair gets tangled more often, and every time they as much as get the comb out, Jack runs for the hills and hides underneath his bed.
I wanted to, Dean wants to say, but he can’t bring himself to. He just stares at Cas, his hangover easing just by looking at the man in front of him, smiling at him.
Cas lifts his head from the pillow to see Jack on the doorway, tiredly rubbing his eyes as he stands there, holding Rebecca Rabbit by the ear.
“Dean—” he starts, but Dean chickens out before he can say anything else by grabbing the empty plastic cup hanging between Cas’s fingers.
“I’ll take care of the decorations, then”, Cas goes on, changing his tone back to a more formal one, “Is that it? I think we need Jack for the details.”
The man by the door looks like he’s been caught red handed, the way he stops to stare at Dean. “Oh, you’re still awake.”
Most of the people get up to go outside, to the bathroom or to get more drinks, a few stay behind, chatting with each other. During the game it was pretty easy to ignore whatever the fuck happened at the balcony, and Dean figures that avoiding being left alone with Cas really helps. That, and getting more drunk.
It should sound ridiculous, and it does, given that they just started dating like two minutes ago, but it doesn’t, not really, because it’s Cas, and for him it’s even worth to be embarrassed and a little scared sometimes.
All their kids are already old and brave enough to play on their own, but as the snack break is done and Dean’s sent his thank you to the higher powers that made Jack actually eat his food, he’s happy that the kid is content to play right next to the table so he’s able to stay with the adults.
Dean stares at the man, who’s kneeling in front of the silly little flowers, frowning at Dean from underneath the cowboy hat, crooked on his head.
Cas smiles at him, guarding his eyes from the sun with his hand, when it shines directly to his face, “Come on, Jack, let’s go!”
When they’ve finished the birthday song and Jack’s blown the candles with Dean’s help, it’s time to cut the frankly hideous and has-too-much-going-on cake that Jack fortunately seems to adore.
He’s pulled back to reality, and he focuses his gaze back to the man in front of him, giving an apologetic smile, guilt weighing him down a bit. Anna was right, Mick is a lovely and a kind man, who deserves his full attention. He’s not being the perfect date right now, and Mick probably notices it.
“Happy birthday, Jack”, the two wish as Jack accepts the gift. Dean puts him down and as soon as he’s on the floor, the kid runs to the living room to open the gift, the adults following him there.
But Jack spots the sandbox, so eventually he has no other choice but to step into this world, before the boy rips himself off the belts holding him in place and escapes to the sandbox on his own.
Dean annoys everyone during decorating the Christmas tree, up to the point where Bobby leaves the living room to get himself a beer. Ellen does the wise thing and stays out of it completely, but Sam and Jo try to put up with Dean’s habit of changing the places of the decorations the second someone hangs something up the tree.
Dean nods, but doesn’t leave just yet, too busy watching Cas as he rolls up the sleeves, revealing a pair of muscly arms. Dean’s favorite part about dates is when the clothes are gone, but whatever outfit Cas chooses he’s going to be just fine.
“Yes, it’s—getting better now, hopefully”, Cas says, even if it’s not true. He hasn’t really been thinking about work, and even if he was, they’re still not in the clear with bureaucracy around the situation Mick’s referring to.
There’s sounds coming from Jack’s bedroom, telling him that the boy’s awake, and he rushes there before he starts crying. He finds the boy on his bed, rubbing his eyes on the sleeve of his dinosaur onesie, looking like he just woke up. Jack holds his hands out when he sees Cas at the door, and he grabs the boy in his arms.
They drive back to their apartment in a silence that would be comfortable if Cas wasn’t fiddling with the hem of his shirt, looking thoughtfully either at his hands or out of the window, at anywhere but Dean.
The man in front of him is biting his bottom lip a bit from keeping himself from smiling, because he knows what Dean’s asking, or desperately trying to ask, and it’s already lifting some of the tension off Dean’s chest.
She puts the controller on the coffee table, throwing her feet next to it as she leans back on the couch, “Good to see you smiling so much.”
“Hey, if you don’t take it, I’ve got a queue of chicks and dudes to call”, Dean grins, leaning against the car he’s supposed to be fixing, “Miss you too, you know.”
It’s easier to blame Cas than to face his own stupidity anyway, because that’s what he really wants to ignore; not only the fact that he let his feelings creep up on him, but he let himself believe those feelings could be reciprocated.
“Is it wrong to sometimes hope that the moment he’ll actually leave for college would come sooner?” Dean asks.
“Probably not”, Cas says, but he’s already starting to give in, because Dean’s hand is travelling up his thigh, “I think he’s unfixable.”
“Yes it’s—I wish I could invite you in, but—” he leaves the sentence unfinished, not knowing how to end it.
“I’d describe it as beautiful more than boring”, Cas simply says, lowering his eyes to the kid in his arms, continuing before his words even properly hit Dean. “I think I’m gonna sleep as well.”
Cas guides them towards the bed where they manage to land without tripping over on the way there. Dean, lying on his back, awkwardly wiggles himself out of the shirt Cas has kindly already opened for him, before working on the buttons of Cas’s shirt that he’s still fully wearing.
This particular Saturday morning, Cas only comes to the kitchen to get the coffee before returning to his room to drink it. He does it three times, and after the third time he returns fully clothed, leaving his empty cup into the sink.
The thing about letting your guards down is that sometimes he forgets to build them up again. He silently waits for the girls to follow up on his blurted confession, waiting for the eventual joking or gentle laughing, but it doesn’t come.
Dean arrives in time for the bedtime, but the damage is done. Secretly Cas enjoys the fact that it lands on Dean to deal with, when he’s listening to the two of them fighting in the bedroom so loudly he can hear it all the way to the kitchen where he’s working.
The quiet sound of kitchen cabinets being opened, and plates being placed on the table is distant as Dean stares at the man sleeping next to him.
Hell, they slept on the same bed not that long ago, not that Dean allows himself to think about that anymore, or how he hasn’t slept quite that well since.
It’s already dark when Dean parks the car and nudges Cas awake before opening the car door. Cas gives him a confused look like he wouldn’t remember where he is for a second.
“We’re not using these, Dean”, Cas complains and puts the pile of plates back into the shelf and grabs other kinds of plates.
“Trouble in paradise?” someone asks, and they snap their attention to an older woman who’s talking to them, eyeing them slightly amused.
“It’ll be a few hours, tops.” He almost jumps when Dean arrives at the kitchen door, giving a quick nod at the man before he disappears again, the sound of the front door letting him know that he left.
Now that Dean’s gotten past the cringy, nervous part, he can get cocky again, “Don’t get too sappy, it’s not like it was a proposal or anything.”
When Dean had ogled Castiel’s ass the first time he had seen him, he thought of him as someone he would be happy to fuck, but after the dark haired man listens to his ramble about the new Call of Duty being released without ever playing a video game in is life, Dean thinks he might be falling in love with the dorky, gorgeous but cute guy.
He’s about to take Jack back to the bedroom, when he hears the soft rumble of a car engine as someone pulls up their driveway.
Dean’s starting to regret the last few drinks, especially the ones he’s poured for Cas, who’s currently leaning heavily against his side, struggling to get up the stairs.
Dean spots Cas in the living room one evening reading a book about how to raise children, but he’s pretty sure the answer is not gonna be on the pages.
“I don’t know about that one”, Cas chuckles at the compliment, “I miss working closer with other people”, he admits.
“Of course, wouldn’t miss it”, he says as he holds her close. He glances at her baby bump when they let go of each other. Her stomach looks bigger than before, even if they saw each other just a few days ago, “Sure he’s not gonna suddenly join the party?”
Meg looks like she wants to pull all her hair off one by one, the way she throws her head back, groaning.
Dean holds the book open with one hand, when Jack pulls his arm close to him, hugging it and the plushie close.
It takes a minute, but soon enough Dean’s at the door as well. He crosses the room and sits on the edge of the bed as Jack’s eyes light up and he climbs to his lap. Half asleep, Cas looks at the sleepy look Dean has with his hair pillow pressed and college pants on. His outfit looks so quickly thrown on Cas wonders if he sleeps naked, which is a thought very out of place.
Donna looks at the two of them with a gentle smile, hints of jealousy in her tone, “Little Jack’s still an angel.”
Despite Cas very kindly pointing out that it’s not possible, ever since Dean left the house, he’s lived in the blissful, fake reality where he would never have to see Cas ever again, but yeah, there is the fact that they literally have a child together.
“Yeah”, Dean answers, but doesn’t make a move to get up, because doesn’t want to, he’s content just being there with Cas and losing any little amount of sleep he’d be able to get.
When he’s gone and it’s quiet again, Dean gets a knee to his groin, and Cas’s hands on his shoulders, firmly pushing him away.
The sight of their kid sleeping in the dim light, his mouth hanging open a little, has them stopping there just to look at him. His overgrown hair tangled and a mess around his head on the pillow, his tiny fingers are wrapped around Rebecca’s ear as the plushie itself is hanging on the edge of the bed. The lamp on the bedside table paints everything with a warm, soft light that adds the perfect filter to the quiet, calm view in front of them.
“Take your time”, Bobby waves a careless hand, “There isn’t that much work to do anyway.” He heads back inside, chuckling to himself as he goes, leaving the two of them with the toddler.
There’s something about Benny that seems to sour Cas’s mood for the rest of the evening. Ever since he arrived, Benny and Dean have been geeking out over the grill together, smiling and standing close to each other, like they’re in their own little bubble and the rest of the crowd doesn’t exist anymore.
He hates the situation, but they’re just gonna have to survive, for Jack. It’s not his fault his mom died, and he’s stuck with two idiots who have no idea how to take care of a toddler.
Jack climbs to the bed and Dean tucks him in before sitting down on the floor, taking the bedtime story book that the kid had chosen for tonight.
He notices the entrance to the section Sam means on the second floor, to the right from the beautiful, marble stairs, closed with a red ribbon. “Fuck. It’s closed.”
Charlie grins, clearly enjoying his frustration, “I was busy texting my girlfriend, whom I’ve asked to date me face to face.”
The walk from the kitchen to the bedroom is messy and it takes time, because they can’t stop making out like a couple of horny teenagers. When Cas almost pushes him against the hallway wall the second time, Dean takes his own head out of the horny cloud long enough to grab Cas by the arms, promptly pulling him towards the room they’re headed to.
“I don’t”, Cas says, not looking at him as he brings the cigarette to his lips, inhaling the smoke. He tries to blow it away from Dean, who is smiling down at him when he finally agrees to look up.
He closes his eyes again, enjoying the way Dean feels, his back against his chest, a hand holding his, their legs tangled.
“Come on”, she levels him with a look when he pretends to not understand her, “Even an idiot could see you two being weird. And I’m not even an idiot.”
The touch of Cas’s lips against his is brief and gentle, something you could easily miss if you blink, but it still manages to set a fire in every nerve ending in Dean’s body. It would be embarrassing, if Dean wasn’t busy melting the last bits of his brain that’s still left inside his skull. Cas leans back a bit, but he lingers in Dean’s space, blue eyes glued to his, so bright and beautiful, and before Dean can stop himself, he’s licking his lips quickly, and just to return the gesture and nothing more, Dean presses his lips against Cas’s, with a bit more pressure to it, but still gentle.
Cas closes the book in his lap, putting it next to him on the couch. “Me neither, it’s a painful memory.”
Cas is there with Meg, leaning against the railing, bringing his cigarette to his lips, inhaling the smoke. He blows it out, licking his lips before he brings the cigarette back to his lips again.
been quite the opposite. They’re still parents to a four-year-old, no matter in love they might have fallen. He’s tired because it was his turn to wake up early this morning.
The way Dean instantly flicks his eyes away and bites his teeth together answers Charlie’s question without him saying anything about it.
Cas feels a fond smile growing on his lips when he turns around to see Jack, wide smile on his lips, legs swaying under his seat while he holds the phone against his ear, nodding at something Dean says to him.
Jack’s voice is muffled against Cas’s shirt, but the refusal is loud and clear, tiny ponytail bouncing from side to side as he shakes his head.
“You sure?” Dean asks. Cas follows the conversation near him, trying to hear Sam on the other end of the line.
Dean just grins his most annoying grin as he grabs the fabric Cas offers and decides to drop it for the moment.
“We could cut it like mine”, Dean grins, running a hand through his own short, but slightly overgrown cut, “You’d look like me!”
“Yeah”, Dean agrees with a nod. And he does, but as he looks down at his hands, somehow Cas’s choice of words doesn’t feel like enough, “Yeah, me too.”
the redhead exclaims, letting out an unbelieving chuckle, “That must’ve been a top three awkward morning after for you.”
Cas lets his fingers gently run over the orange flowers, wondering how long they’ve been there. The bouquet looks quite fresh, so Dean’s probably been there the last time it was Cas’s turn to take care of Jack. He doesn’t know for sure, because they haven’t talked about it. They don’t talk much about anything.
“I am not judging if it is a conscious choice”, Cas starts, “but you’re still wearing the pins on your hair.”
This is not the first fight they’ve ever had, but there’s a different level of hurt and anger in the air than there’s never been before. Cas has no idea how this conversation ended up where it is now but being filled with anger is somehow easier to take right now than to face the heartbreak behind it.
Mrs. Kline’s hopeless, loud cry hits Cas’s eardrums like something sharp and cold, forcing him into this reality.
draining one of you for the spell is enough, and I do not want to listen to two any longer. So”, she concludes, smiling, “I’ll kill one, take one with me.”
“Dude”, Dean points at the bed, “There’s not enough space for both of us, thing’s tiny as hell.” Maybe the two of them will fit but there’s not enough space for Dean’s huge crush on Cas. He leaves that part out.
They’re all snuggled up on Cas’s bed the next evening as well, because Jack seems to like it best to be there between them, listening to a story. This time it’s Cas’s turn to read, but Dean’s still there, on the listening end this time.
The way he says it makes Dean want to ask more, but he doesn’t know how, or even if he should at all.
“Wow!” he exclaims, and Dean has to grab him by the back of his jacket to keep him from falling, when he gets excited. He can’t help but smile when the kid turns to look at him, his face happier than ever.
The kid’s showing him a packet of hair ties and pins, which indeed are decorated with different characters from Peppa Pig, and Dean realizes what a huge mistake he’s just made.
“See you”, Cas says, way too late when Dean’s already out the door. He walks across the house to Jack’s bedroom and opens the door a bit to get a glance at the sleeping boy, who looks so tiny and relaxed under the dim light of the bedside table lamp.
They have no idea how to deal with any of it, and toddlers can definitely smell that fear, Dean’s now sure of it. It’s a constant competition of which one of the three of them is in the worst mood, and there’s a new winner every minute. You can’t even escape to the bathroom, because the kid will follow you even there.
“You’ll see him in the morning”, Cas assures, “Good night, Jack”, he wishes and tries to tuck the kid quickly back under the covers, holding in a groan when Jack ignores him and sits up.
They manage to do half of the shopping together before they can’t compromise over the vegetables for the barbecue, and after Dean makes a totally funny joke about eggplants, Cas takes off with Jack to continue shopping on his own.
He turns back to Jack, clasping his hands together when he leans his arms against his thighs, “I just like Cas so much I want to sleep in his bedroom”, he tells the kid. Flicking his eyes briefly at Cas, he continues, “Actually, I like Cas so much I might want to kiss him sometimes.”
either”, Dean says, turning the volume down a bit as a car explodes on the screen, and the kid’s already asleep.
“Since there’s no suitable close relatives, we would take him into custody, and search for a family”, she explains, “No one wants to adopt older children”, she straight up states, but gives them a reassuring smile, “but I’m positive it would be a quick process for him, because there are families waiting to adopt all over America.”
“Peppa got presents”, Jack tells Dean, “Look, it’s Rebecca Rabbit!” the boy exclaims next, struggling with all the r’s in his words, grabbing his own plushie from the floor. Dean hums something back, and glances down on his phone, reacting to Jack’s comments here and there.
“Not when I’m in charge”, Dean says, giddy simply seeing Cas walking and talking. He slams the door shut as Cas glares at him from the car.
Dean’s too drunk and confused to process information anymore, and Meg seems to read that from his short circuited expression.
They’re making out so urgent and dirty it doesn’t take them long to be hard and out of breath. Dean leans back from the kiss, but keeps Cas flushed against him, knuckles white from holding the fabric of his shirt in his fists.
Dean taps his fingers against the kitchen isle, getting up, “I should probably get some sleep before work”, he speaks, not to Cas anymore.
“We’ll see you tomorrow”, Dean tells him and he’s missing the kid so much already he can’t even be embarrassed about reaching over to smooth a hand down his hair, while he’s still trapped in Cas’s arms.
“Who’s in a better mood?” Dean asks as he appears to the kitchen right that second, surprisingly soon, a towel hanging low on his hips.
Dean wants to bang his head through the wall, but he can’t take his eyes off the two, feeling a slight relief when Mick doesn’t kiss Cas.
“It’s a timetable”, he says, turning to look at Dean as he pops the cap back onto the marker. “We’ll write everything here, so we don’t have to fight about it.”
“I wish”, he says, his drunken body splayed on the couch next to Dean. He takes a sip from his glass, rolling his eyes, “Dean was just being annoying.”
, Cas!” he shouts, and Cas shuts his eyes like it would prevent it from being real. Dean shakes Cas’s hand off himself, “Kelly’s gone!”
“been to lakes that much”, he blurts out, “Have you, Cas?” he asks, cheeks burning and voice going up an octave, somehow hoping that no one notices that, “Yes, we should go there today”, he continues before Cas even gets to give him an answer other than a confused look.
so my own favorite scene of this story is the one where dean caught cas smoking. i've written the first draft of that scene like waaay before this story was even a proper plot idea and just random scenes and ideas and what ifs. it's literally one of the reasons i started writing this story properly, because i needed this fanfic to put the smoking scene in hahah. and it's just crazy that now it has all this story around it and it's out there!
Cas rolls his eyes but marks it down on the fifth column on the board, and all the way to Saturday too.
“The first movie is simply—" he stops as the smug smile starts to scare him, “Why do you look at me like that, Sammy?”
“Taking care of a child doesn’t require two adults at all times everywhere”, Sam elaborates, “Like right now, he’s at work, right?”
He gets up and tries to put Jack down on the bed, but the kid won’t untangle his hands from around his neck. “But I want you here too”, he whines, hanging from Dean’s neck. Dean looks up at Cas for support, but the man just stares back.
They do as they’re told and grab random drinks from the tray. The way Cas’s face completely twists from the amount of alcohol in his cup turns Dean’s insides around more than the taste of his own drink does.
“That was amazing”, Dean speaks quietly, smile in his tone, “You good?” he asks casually, while he gets comfortable under the covers.
“You were a child when Sam was this young so I think it might cloud your memories of the time a bit”, Cas points out while he types something on his computer, “I think Jack suffers from a late case of the terrible two’s.”
Dean is outside with Bobby and another man who works at the garage, when they arrive there. Dean and his coworker are working on something under the hood of the truck they’ve got parked at the front yard, with Bobby watching them work, coffee cup in hand.
Jack’s still sleepy, so he’s content curled up in Cas’s lap while he makes the final edits on the computer, before turning it off completely.
The kid is cranky all through the morning, not really concentrating on any toys he’s playing with, and way before lunchtime Dean texts Jody that they’ll skip park today.
Dean smiles a wide, proud smile when he does, “You teach Cas that while I’m gone, right?” Then, with a quick nod to Cas, he leaves.
in everything, and apparently, he expects Dean to be like that too. He sure likes to point out all his flaws, had the nerve to comment on his climbing skills earlier today at today’s activity they were holding for the younger group, rubbing his own
“Ha! We’ve had both of those before, so”, Dean counters, satisfied with his proper argument against her.
As soon as they hear the front door shutting, Cas opens his mouth, tone sharp, “What the fuck was that?”
They have to break their usual day at a time schedule, because Cas has some extra work shit going on and he needs to focus on that, so Dean’s spent two and a half days straight with Jack.
“In his defense, has he really seen people other than you or Cas?” Sam counters. “I’ve met him only a few times and rarely too, he just needs his time.”
“Okay, I have one now. Never have I ever… Passed out, naked, I might add, with a guy, to my friend’s bathroom, making the said friend think I
Jack goes on to explain something about Mr. Rhino’s vehicles and the two just smile and nod along as the kid rambles, hands glued to the steering wheel.
! your comments and kudos always make my day AND they get me through the times when i struggle with editing the chapters <3 two more to go!
“Now, you two”, Sam says pointedly to get the other two men’s attention from wherever they’re trying to glance after Jack, “You don’t have to worry about him. Go have fun.”
“Ah, but you’re not joining because it’s Dean’s turn, isn’t it?” Charlie asks, or rather points out as she walks to the kitchen isle, pulling herself a chair.
There’s still some light coming from the windows of Bobby’s house, so not everyone is asleep just yet. Dean grabs the key from where Bobby keeps the spare one, underneath the ugly, broken elf statue that has creeped Dean out since he was a kid. The front door makes a familiar sound when Dean creaks it open, the feeling of coming home making him smile instantly.
Dean was as much responsible about it as he was, so he doesn’t understand why he would get that pissed off about it.
They get the check after dessert, and Mick insists on paying even if Cas tries to pay at least his share of it. It’s already dark and quite chilly outside when they leave the restaurant, the wind feeling cold against his face when they’re walking down the street.
Dean drinks most of his coffee in the comfort of his bed, listening to the other two talking while they get breakfast. Jack is mostly explaining something constantly with Cas getting short comments in here and there.
Bobby just waves him off, snorting, “Quit worrying about it. You see me working my ass of here right now either?” he asks, nodding towards the paper he was reading instead of working. He gives Dean a look, “Ain’t exactly rush hours.”
Jack gives them a quick look before climbing on the couch again, his light brown hair bouncing on his head as he jumps down. He almost misses the cushion he’s trying to jump to, losing his balance for a second.
“Fuck”, he sighs and Cas frowns at him. He turns his gaze to the blue eyes, apologetic, “I was gonna make you a dinner tonight, Cas, I’m sorry.”
All of Dean’s friends are working on Friday, or have other plans already, so he was going to stay at home anyway. But now that Cas is going out, it somehow pisses him off that he can’t, if there’s an opportunity coming up.
They had just bought new ones with animal patterns on them, and the kid’s literally been waiting for the moment someone injures themselves so he could get his hands on the package.
He gives Cas’s hand a squeeze, and Cas hides his face against the back of Dean’s neck, breathing him in.
Sam, the asshole, has set mistletoes up all around the house, like traps. Dean is torn between his stupid wish to get stuck under one with Cas and pointedly avoiding them all like the plague.
Even the huge cardboard cutout of Princess Leia, that Charlie has in the corner of her living room, has glittery ribbons around her, and a party hat on.
“It’s my birthday!” Jack screams to his ear, bouncing with each word, if by some miracle Cas would’ve forgotten that during the night.
Andrea chuckles quietly, glancing down at the empty beer bottle she’s fiddling in her hands. Dean’s pretty sure he’d seen them switch bottles when Benny’s was empty, but he doesn’t point it out, because it’s none of his business.
“Sure”, Cas says and he’s really glad to have something to keep his head from his thoughts. They hang up quickly after that, and after a short moment, the doorbell rings and Cas opens the door to Sam and Jack.
“Not that I’d see myself getting married in general”, he starts, and looking like even the idea of it disgusts him, he continues, “Cas would be my last choice.”
He’s already dreading the way Dean will shrug this off with his easy smile and some joke, and they’re back to being just friends. In his drunk, horny brain Cas had thought he could do this, and maybe he really could've, if they'd only had sex and that's it. But now, with Dean pressing an affectionate kiss to the back of his neck, wishing him good night as he intertwines his fingers with Cas’s, he’s not sure if he’s able to go back to normal after all.
Dean bites down a smile at Cas’s cursing. There’s a group of teenagers walking past them, so into their own thing that they don’t pay attention to the fact that they’re walking straight towards them. Without thinking about it, Dean grabs Cas by the arm, and pulls him flush against himself, away from the teenagers.
He walks further down the hallway, out of Jack’s earshot, “I can leave if you want to see Jack, I understand if you don’t want to see me.”
”, he complains anyway, making a show of rubbing his pained ass, but Cas doesn’t even bother to look at him as he stands up and goes to his backpack to grab a pair of sweats.
Jo shakes Cas’s hand, and introduces herself and Charlie, before a smirk rises to her lips, and Dean knows he’s screwed:
Dean feels his breathing getting heavier, keeping himself up on one elbow, the other hand making its way to the dark mess of hair, tugging and pulling whenever Cas does something with his tongue.
“No way, small world!” Charlie beams, but when she glances at Dean, her smile drops, “And that’s making you murderous why?”
“Thanks, Cas, that’s the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me”, Dean mocks because the alternative would be too embarrassing.
The drive from Sam’s apartment to Charlie’s is short, so it doesn’t take them long to arrive at the party. Cas is about to get out of the car, but Dean stops him before he does, reaching to grab something from the backseat, handing it to Cas.
Cas swallows, he notices the corners of Dean’s eyes getting wet already, and he looks down on his lap, chuckling sadly, “It was after your birthday party, and she was feeling
His eyes betray him pretty fast, finding a different brunet further down the hallway, currently chatting with Meg.
, where i post my writing too, especially shorter fics! also... i might have something more planned for this au as well, so... let's just say there's a lot of chaotic ideas left in my brain for this little family, that didn't make the final cut of this story ;)
It might seem like it’s no big deal, but it feels surprisingly huge having Jack step out of this bubble they’ve been more or less just the three of them these past months. They stay there, looking at Jack who keeps eyeing the two of them constantly.
“Only free night I got this week”, he says, even if it’s not true. He could probably switch with Cas, but he and Jack left the bedtime story in a good spot on naptime and he promised to read the rest of it tonight. Plus, he doesn’t want the hassle, “Take it or leave it.”
“Neither of us is seeing anyone else”, Dean points out as he picks the loose thread from the armrest of the chair.
They’re both a bit out of breath after the short match, Dean can feel the fast rise and fall of Novak’s chest underneath his hand.
The others are laughing, and that’s the last straw, if they’re having fake fights in this fake relationship, he’s not going to be the one to fake lose them.
“I think the message will go through”, Dean assures. He eyes the already finished cards, set aside while the glitter dries. “Everyone’s gonna love those. Everyone’s gonna be covered in glitter, but they’ll love it.”
The four-year-old is completely unaware of the impact of his words, and that’s probably a good thing. He lifts his head, looking briefly at them both, smiling wide.
Cas enjoys the short break from the mess in his head, when he gives all his focus to Jack when the kid excitedly tells him about his sleepover at Sam’s, going into every little detail while jumping from topic to topic. Staying on top of all that really leaves no room for anything else in his brain.
“I bet you are”, Meg smirks and shakes his hand quickly, before turning her attention back to Cas. “
“Because she doesn’t have the rings”, Cas explains for her, earning a wave of purple light shot at him, making his face twist in pain, as she curls her fingers.
Cas is stuck in the afternoon traffic and checks his watch to confirm to himself that he’ll be late for sure.
Except it’s not a fucking home, it’s a house of his dead best friend, where he’s supposed to live and take care of her child, with a guy he’s not a fan of, who definitely doesn’t enjoy his company either.
Dean lets out an easy chuckle, because it’s not like Cas was wrong, “Don’t worry about it. We’re good?”
Dean turns to look at Cas for support. He’s already facing him and has been quiet during all this. He has this soft look on his face and Dean wants to kiss him so badly.
He stops shifting and looks at Cas, only a silhouette of his profile visible in the dark. “Why do you ask?”
Cas is the first one to snap, just as Jack pushes his cereal bowl away from himself, loudly disagreeing with the fact that he should eat something to not be that cranky. In fact, they all should probably eat something and maybe take a nap, but Dean gives up for a second, and lets Jack out of his personal prison which is the kitchen chair.
Mick frowns at something next to them on the ground, and Cas realizes he’s staring at the box full of Jack’s outdoor toys.
“She often came to stay at your place?” Dean asks, tentatively as if to test if he’s allowed to continue the conversation.
The boy peeks from behind the curtain with interest, like he always does when Dean starts with a tone like that, like he’s about to tell the best thing ever. Dean waves the basket at him.
While Jack goes through his mental breakdown and gets mad at his toys, Dean packs them lunch in a container and grabs Jack with him to the garage, where they keep the stollers. Once he’s figured out the belts and everything else that there is to figure out about strollers, they’re out and heading to a park near the apartment.
Everything seems to have slowly fallen into place now that they got rid of the switching places. Jack seems more content than before, and it’s easier for Cas to stay at his own place if he needs to, because he knows he can also just stay there and be around Jack even if Dean’s there too.
“Are you baking a pie?” Cas asks to make conversation. Dean hums as he pours more ingredients to the dough.
“And I told you I believed you. We also covered the fact that you weren’t crying, it was allergies.”
Dean wants to take it as a joke, but the soft tone in Cas’s voice and the honest eyes he’s giving Dean are making it impossible to shrug it off.
He was so blacked out by fear when he saw Cas there, blood on his head, that it’s just slowly coming back to him now.
If he wanted to argue, he could’ve just stayed at home. But he doesn’t want to think about that now.
Dean feels the terror flashing his face, because he’s an asshole who literally has no other excuses in his back pocket but the being busy one. He’s desperately putting together a new one or trying to figure out a way to let her down without fucking everything up, like he always does. He’s an ass, so he has no idea why the fuck this chick would even want to see him again.
He tries to focus back on the moment to come up with a funny comeback about how their kid is the wingman of the year actually, but the alcohol is clouding his head.
“Okay that’s enough, you can solve that out later”, Jo says, holding her hands up, “What’s the next game?”
No, this is something people are probably born with, and he or Cas just don’t have it in them, but he’s too tired to step into the room and start an argument with Cas over it.
“You’re the best”, Cas counters, unable to stop smiling. He’s been smiling so much these past months that Meg had said she’s starting to worry for his sanity, after she’d had enough making fun of his sappy love life. It took her surprisingly long to get all her jokes out of her system.
Dean’s a professional. He’s been told he’s very good at his job, he runs into burning buildings in a heartbeat, no fire is too much for him, and most importantly: he’s always been able to keep his cool, and focus on the job no matter the pressure.
Dean bites down a smile and any comments he might want to say to that, “Yeah, she should be more careful.”
Which, to be honest, makes Dean quite relieved. They haven’t moved in yet, but he can’t imagine life under the same roof with Castiel Novak to be anything else than completely horrible, so it’s comforting to know he has his own place to escape to. They just have to get through the start, and then evaluate later if it’s the best to have two homes for the kid, according to the social services.
“Good”, Bobby just says to him, before looking at Dean, “It's good weather outside and I just cleared the way to the lake”, he nods towards Cas as he continues, “You should take your man there to see the view.”
, Charlie points out, disapprovingly glancing at Dean before looking at Cas, “and he’s dragged you down with him, I see.”
“I wanna sleep here”, Jack mumbles and crawls closer, snuggling against Cas’s side. He presses his face against Cas’s chest.
They spend the waiting time talking, once even having coffee Castiel has brought from home. Dean isn’t sure if the flirting was mutual, but he notices himself trying to flirt as much as he can, without being too forward, in case Castiel isn’t really interested.
Cas drops his eyes, letting out a sad chuckle, “I know I’m not horrible at it, but sometimes I just wonder…”
The man has dark brown hair that was the right amount of messy to look sexy, stubble around his cheekbones, serious gaze and these beautiful, blue eyes. Dean shamelessly stares at the man as he walks over to one of the free washing machines, the green eyes following the t-shirt covered back all the way down to the guy’s ass as he leans down to grab stuff from his laundry bag.
But soup helps everyone, so that’s where Dean starts. He braces Jack more comfortably on his hip, and searches for ingredients from the fridge.
Eventually Jack stops crying and starts to calm down in Dean’s lap, and slowly but surely he falls back asleep, his tiny face pressed against the crook of Dean’s neck. Kid’s got snot and tears all the way down on his chin and the front of his pajamas, making the skin on Dean’s neck damp as well.
“She’s Jo”, Cas passes on the message to Charlie. Jack leans closer again, whispering something for Cas to pass along. “Jo, from the park.”
Dean explains the situation to his brother, trying to keep his cool but eventually rambling down to the detail of his messy hair and the way he tilts his head when he is listening to Dean ramble about something stupid and meaningless but still making the effort to listen and how he laughs at his stupid jokes and how he probably isn’t into him but he has to check anyway because he just has to.
Cas wants to point out that Meg is literally making this place unsuitable for them if the flirting goes any further, but there’s enough drama going on in his own life right now for him to start that conversation.
“Would you like some cupcakes too?” Jack suddenly asks, glancing at the door, “Dad?” he prompts, when Dean doesn’t react immediately.
They walk past this cute, small ice cream store that sells Cas’ favorite ice cream and since they have a few minutes before they have to run to the car to get Jack, Dean buys some.
Dean opens it and reads through the colorful cardboard inside. “You know, you can also just text people to invite them over to get drunk and give you presents?”
Cas is really professional at bedtime story reading apparently, his voice is so low and quietly calm Dean is fighting sleep from the first page forward.
Dean holds a hand up, and it takes Jack a moment to remember what Dean wants him to do, but eventually he gives him a high five, his hand so tiny against Dean’s.
“All good, they’re running some tests, but he’s gonna be fine”, Charlie explains as she walks over to him. “Meg was on shift, told her not to release him without letting us know”, she grins.
The way Cas says it sounds like a neutral statement, an observation, and Dean realizes he didn’t think how Cas would feel about that at all. The tone of his voice doesn’t give anything away.
”, she argues, “I pay taxes, I do good things. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a little power and immortality on the side.”
They get to buy some candy, because it’s Friday, and Jack starts crying because the store has run out of the nougat he loves.
He’s wanted that for so long that right now, in the hours so late at night it’s basically morning, he wants to give in, lean in, one hand against the cool surface of the kitchen isle, the other pulling Cas by the neck, and simply just press his lips against Cas’s.
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that, but he abandons the dishes and turns his attention fully to Cas. The man’s staring down at the washcloth he moves around the surface.
Dean gives another hopeless look to Cas, and Cas blames his tiredness of it, but he just shrugs. “You’d fit there”, he says.
There’s free space on the other side of the room, but Dean sits down before he can second guess himself.
He’s supposed to be in the fucking room for his sick kid, but he can’t because his brain is a mess, and he hates himself for it.
“Do you know who that blonde girl is, though?” Charlie asks, aiming for a nonchalant tone, but Cas thinks there’s more to it.
Eventually though, after a long battle of evening routines of brushing teeth, changing into pajamas and choosing the bedtime story, and countless toilet breaks during it, the kids are asleep, and Dean closes the bedroom door behind him as quietly as he can.
He jolts to sit, and checks the time. Fortunately for him, Cas is super early with his messages, and he still has time. He’s not home but he’s pretty sure the apartment he’s in is close to the bar, based on the vague memories he has of coming in here.
It’s about a week after the funeral, when Dean thinks maybe there’s a light at the end of this tunnel, as he puts a small bowl of Cheerios in front of Jack, and he actually agrees to eat them. Even if he picks them up one by one from the bowl with his tiny fingers, he’s putting them into his mouth, chewing and swallowing, and Dean doesn’t care if he’d use his damn toes to do it.
“It will be”, he promises, “Especially from a disposable plate that you’ve spent five hours choosing.”
“I’m not hooking up with him”, she confirms once and for all, “I saw him naked once, on accident, and let me just say that was an awful experience to
Dean is the one to blink himself to consciousness first. He's sitting down on the floor, but when he tries to move, he realizes he's bound to the wall he’s leaning against, his hands trapped to his sides even if there’s no visible rope around him.
The bottom half of Jack’s face is painted brown with the chocolate ice cream. Dean had gotten a few different one’s because he didn’t really know what Jack would prefer.
Dean had managed to stop by a food stand to buy them some sandwiches to eat on the small walk to the toy store, to avoid the hunger souring the mood for either of them. According to Cas, both him and Claire handle being hungry very poorly, and he tries to keep that in mind.
The smoke hits in a thick cloud when Dean opens the door, running inside. He hears his own voice breaking when he screams, “
“Eat”, he demands, nodding towards the plate when Cas doesn’t do anything else but stare at him. “It’s pancake time”, he announces again, “We can’t leave this table until we’ve finished all of these, right, Jack?” he asks, smiling to the kid, tickling his cheek a bit and it gets a giggle out of him.
Cas gets the short end of the stick that morning, when he’s woken up by that tiny person climbing to his bed. The kid crawls over him with excited sounds escaping him as he jumps on top of Cas.
At first, they were always at home, days spent trying to survive from one small crisis to another, all the way to the point when Jack finally went to sleep. After that, the two of them spent the first few hours avoiding each other, before going to sleep as well, and then waking up if, and when Jack woke up in the middle of the night.
Now, the kid hides his face to the crook of Cas’s neck the second Dean grabs the bottle from the kitchen isle.
Dean doesn’t get to enjoy the warmth of the thought for too long, when he spots a tiny amount of blood on the corner of the kitchen table, and the sick feeling in his stomach is back instantly.
Dean keeps on shouting, pouring it all out on him. Cas wishes he could get angry, or cry, or shove Dean back when he shoves him, but he can’t.
In his defense, he asked Dean if it was okay for him to go and he said he had no plans, so he doesn’t fully understand what his problem with his date was all week.
“You know why, man”, Dean tries to dodge the question, but Cas’s determined face doesn’t give up, not even in the dark where Dean can’t properly see it, “You were gonna spend Christmas alone in your apartment, and I would’ve felt like an asshole being here with everyone while you’d be alone”, he mutters, playing with a loose thread on the corner of his blanket, “And Sam was gonna bring Eileen, so it’s not like he would’ve kept me company all this time, so.”
“I’m just searching for more spoons”, he explains his reason to be there, opening another drawer like it would make it less weird.
Cas assumes the rules of complete silence are not applicable at this part of the library, and they’re the only ones there anyway, so he takes the book Jack is handing to him and lets the boy crawl to his lap.
He was thinking about it constantly during the day, so he forced himself to say it out loud as well. Talking about Kelly hasn’t gotten easier, but he’s trying.
The guard has a slightly doubtful look on his face, as he eyes them both, and this has got to be the stupidest
“Uh, I can take the couch downstairs”, Dean offers, not looking at Cas, who has stopped next to him on the doorway.
The first guests to arrive are Sam and Eileen. Despite Jack being very comfortable around the two, the kid’s suddenly a bit shy when he’s asked to come to the door.
The note isn’t signed, but Cas of course knows who’s written it even without a signature. He smiles fondly as he runs his fingers over the messy handwriting, pressed to the thin paper so hard with a barely working pen you can feel the letters on the backside of the paper.
They surge towards the redhead, but as she raises both her hands, a purple glow floats through the air, slamming them against the opposite walls.
“Speaking of Cas”, Benny starts, “he seems— less awful than you used to describe him”, the man says, nonchalantly glancing at him. Dean peeks over his shoulder at the man in question, sitting at the stairs, before shrugging at Benny.
The social services must be happy that this all got taken care of so easily and cheap, but it’s not like they can give Jack to them without
It’s easier to speak now that he’s not looking at Cas. “Probably wouldn’t be any good at it if you weren’t looking after my messy ass anyway”, he says, even if what he really wanted to say was that he couldn’t do it if it wasn’t for Cas.
Dean gives him a once over when he arrives at the kitchen door, leaning against the frame. He’s wearing black dress pants, hugging his legs all the way up from his ankles to his crotch. He has the dress shirt Dean’s embarrassingly complimented, sleeves casually rolled up, but overall he looks fancier than usual. He’s shaved his face and done his hair, and it’s looking more put together than the mess it usually is.
“You wish there was”, Dean mutters smugly, “If you don’t stop joking, I’m actually going to marry you and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
Charlie just hums, not reacting to his joke. Dean flicks his eyes away when she just keeps on staring, letting her figure stuff out on her own.
“You are the pickiest person ever when it comes to movies”, Cas explains, “There’s no way my choice would satisfy you.”
The tension in Dean’s still body builds, and Cas can feel it without even looking at the man next to him. Like a bomb, it builds.
Being at Bobby’s, away from home, and the holiday vibe helps Dean to ignore all the thoughts that nag at his brain, and he just selfishly lets himself be in that bubble with Cas and take what he can out of the situation, and he’ll just switch back to normal when they go back home.
kinda guy. He doesn’t know Cas that well, other than what he’s learned about him by running into him during hunts. What he does knows is that the man is determined to go by the book, following a clearly laid out plan, always.
“There’s no harm in moving it by a week and just have a regular barbecue then”, Cas sighs, and aggressively presses the buttons to turn the machine on. When he looks up, he’s met with Dean’s most annoying grin.
Jack’s started to drop their names from his vocabulary completely during the past months. The kid’s called him Dad more often than not, and it might’ve taken a hell of a ride to get there, but the d-word, surprisingly enough, is the word Dean prefers to be called over any alternative.
But from what he’s understood from Sam and the lore, he doesn’t want anyone accidentally getting their hands on all four rings, because if one can do that much damage, the consequences are massive if someone, who knows what to do with them, gets all four.
He has gotten those out of Dean a lot more lately. Dean doesn’t want to think about it, so he quickly agrees.
“Can we please start acting like adults again and stop this game?” he asks instead, making a show of putting his drink on the coffee table.
It’s Friday, and Dean’s trying to keep himself busy by packing all the stuff Jack’s going to need at Sam’s. They’re going through all his toys to choose the favorites to pack with him, the pile getting quite big already.
“When that tiny sunshine gets angry you can hear it through the whole house”, he explains, pointing at the kid, when the others frown at his reaction.
“I guess I haven’t felt like asking anyone to come”, he explains, and just because it sounds much heavier than he expected, he continues, “It’s a long drive, and you know how annoying I get with the music and speed limits”, he grins, “Wouldn’t want to put anyone through that.”
He tries to ignore the only possible answer there is; Dean regrets it much more than Cas thought he would. Dean can’t even shrug it off, simply because he hates that it happened in the first place.
They had played with his toys for a moment and then Jack had spotted Sam’s course papers and markers on the coffee table and wanted to draw, and that’s what they were doing when Dean arrived.
Dean turns to glare at Sam, but he’s secretly happy for his brother to break the moment, because it was getting a bit too much for Dean to handle.
Novak’s cheekbones clench as he bites his teeth together, and Dean is waiting for the angry lecture about ruined clothes and how hard it is to wash paint off clothes or something else the perfect, nerdy Castiel Novak will probably lecture him about.
The heartfelt laugh that escapes Castiel’s lips and the look he gives Dean is worth cleaning off the melted ice cream from the seats tomorrow. Dean puts his arm around Castiel’s shoulders and pulls him close.
He is, even with his crazy work hours. He’s amazing with Jack, patient and always interested in whatever Jack’s going on about, Dean can’t understand how he does it. And
“I am ready to go”, the kid announces and gestures at the ties he’s thrown around his neck. All six of them.
Dean’s surprised to find Cas awake already, the other man’s hunched, sitting form catching him off guard.
Bobby just looks at him with a calm, neutral expression on his face. The way he said it was so nonchalant, natural. Unaware of the short circuit of Dean’s brain, Bobby just turns around to pour himself some leftover coffee from the pot.
“He is not a hookup”, Cas repeats, trying to keep his voice down since Jack is still sleeping, “He was in the neighborhood and just came over for a second”, he explains, and Dean can hear the anger rising in his tone. He opens his mouth to protest, but Cas speaks over him before he can even start:
“Because I couldn’t imagine a reality where you’d reciprocate my feelings”, Cas answers honestly, eyes flicking down at his feet, “I couldn’t face that, so I tried not to.”
A few days later they’re at the store, when Jack bumps into Dean when he’s walking behind him. Could be just because Dean stopped so suddenly, but as he looks down at the kid pushing his hair away again, it reminds Dean of the conversation they had earlier.
“I didn’t know you have a—" she starts, looking at Dean, eyes hardening. She frowns to herself for a second, “Wait, we met—" her eyes flick at Jack again quickly, before she looks at Cas.
Cas doesn’t dare to even breathe when he balances with Jack snoring quietly against his neck and the tote bag full of books on his left shoulder. He’s carrying Jack’s little bag in his left hand as he holds the kid with his right.
“Dean Smith”, Dean cuts him off, offering his hand to Rowena while placing the other one to the small of Cas’s back, “his husband.”
“See?” Dean says as he gives him more soup, “I am tempted to make him try all the foods he hates, just to see if he would eat them.”
“It was nice getting to know you and put a face to the name”, she smiles, and Cas returns the expression.
“Well”, Dean states, trying to sound eager about the idea, “Cas definitely makes a better Papa Bear than I do. I think he’s got the voice for it.”
Dean’s feelings for Cas are no surprise, he’s admitted to himself he’s in love with his best friend a long time ago, but now Cas is looking at him like
Donna is deep into the baby bubble, “Oh no, who could butcher such a sweet thing like that?” she talks and gets up to pour herself more coffee.
Cas has met Sam a few times before when the younger Winchester has been visiting Dean, and he looks taller each time, which shouldn’t be possible since he’s turned twenty-one this year and should not grow any more.
“I do make mistakes outside of camp, too”, he points out, shrugging and some of the sadness of Novak’s eyes wash away when he frowns.
Jody says she can relate, and tells some incident she’s had with Owen, and it manages to bring a smile to Donna’s face.
Dean ignores him, keeping his eyes firmly on the news article he’s pretending to read, but he’s forced to look up when he feels Cas’s demanding eyes on him.
“His name is Rubble”, Jack says, pointing at the dog Sam’s holding, before showing his own, “This is Skye.”
Dean follows Bobby through the garage, all the way to the back door that leads to the yard behind the garage building. There, in the middle of all the other junk, is a busted-up tractor, looking like it’s going to fall apart in any second. It still gets an adoring sigh from Jack when he sees it.
Dean is already disagreeing, but he knows he has to agree to get Cas on board. He doesn’t do it right away, just to build some more tension between them as they stand there in the crowd, having a staring contest. “Fine.”
Cas turns to look at the other man. “Look at him”, he says, pointing at the kid, now lying on his stomach on the ground, eyes huge as he looks inside the castle, itching to touch even if he was told not to. “It’s more than that.”
Dean smirks because it’s easier than letting Cas see the real emotions he’s under while Cas watches him. “I guess I’m not that good.”
Dean’s cursing this stupid job underneath his breath. That fucker can’t be dead, he can’t die on this stupid job, because it’s the first one they’ve actually managed to work together this long without even trying to kill each other.
“He’s asleep already”, Cas confirms, gesturing somewhere behind him, towards the bedroom, “It definitely wasn’t easy, but I did it.”
For a second Dean thinks he should just go inside and wash his crush away with the bed sheets, but he also knows he would hate himself for not at least trying. A tiny, flirty smirk grows on his lips, almost on its own.
Kelly comes back and puts an end to their bicker before it properly even starts. “Okay, knock it off, you two”, she laughs, and they do, but not without glaring at each other for a second first.
“There’s nothing to process. There’s no way I am suitable to take care of a pet, let alone a child”, Dean says, “There has to be someone else.”
The nurse comes in and they put Jack to the hospital bed in the room as she takes his temperature, checking some other things from Jack’s files.
Jack admires his drawing like it would be a real piece of art, letting out a loud “Wow!” as he points at each stick figure with his glittery finger, naming them. “It’s very awesome.”
“I’m sure Dean takes them off whenever he showers as well.” Cas pats the edge of the sink. “We’ll put it here, and you’ll get it back the second we’re done.”
Jack doesn’t know how to read yet, but a book about insects they’d found had him hooked for a good half hour anyway. Their little garden has taken up more and more space outside each day, and while Cas takes care of the flowers, Jack seems to be more interested in the bugs he finds there.
“Stop being a horny drunk, Sammy, that’s disgusting”, he mocks, and Sam lets go of Eileen to shoot his brother a bitchface, to which Dean only answers with his best ‘annoying big brother’ smile.
“She’s meeting people, alright”, Dean mutters under his breath before he can stop himself, “Seems to be quite close with Cas.”
“Let’s just play the game”, Dean grunts, turning towards the screen to put an end to the conversation. Charlie stares at him for a beat before sighing and pressing play.
Cas is rarely at the house alone, usually at least Jack is there with him, and the silence feels so still he has to turn on the TV to have sounds around him. He can’t concentrate on watching anything, and the noises do little to silence whatever is going on in his head anyway.
There’s this weird feeling in his gut when he thinks about Cas. They’ve formed a surprisingly good parenting team even if Dean says so himself, and after the very rough start that he doesn’t want to think about, the man is actually a dream to raise a child with. Their schedules work together, and they agree enough about the rules in parenting.
They haven’t hated each other with a burning passion for a while now, but it still catches Dean off guard when Cas’s smile warms something in his chest. He ignores it, and busies himself with picking Jack up from the strollers.
“Don’t be silly, I know who you are, hunters”, she spits the word out like saying it would burn her tongue, “All it took to confirm it was a little eavesdropping at the charity event, some magic”, she explains, “Little nudging you to the right direction, and you dumb little things walked right into my trap, like ducklings.”
Dean’s literally hard in his jeans, hands on Cas’s ass, the man on top of him leaving kisses on his bare skin, but they still find the time to
At some point during the evening Cas has sent him a text saying he has to stay overtime because they are understaffed, and he’s the only doctor available.
Before Dean’s even finished with his coffee, Jack’s pulled the plastic container closer to him, eating the snacks while he watches the kids. Jody gives him a knowing smile and a small nod when Dean looks up at her.
Dean stops to stand next to Cas, looking at him from head to toe. The man is wearing a tux similar to his, and he’s combed his mess of a hair neatly back, looking much more put together than he usually does. The pissed off, icy blue eyes and the low growl of a voice are the same as always.
, Meg says, something weird in her tone. Dean doesn’t have time to think about it too much, because his focus is on Meg’s hand that’s still on Cas’s arm, because this chick won’t stop touching Cas, apparently.
He knows she’s really happy for him, but he knows her well enough to know that showing it appropriately isn’t her style. And maybe feeling like you’re constantly living the happiest moment of your life only to have that moment to be followed up with a new happy moment can seem a bit crazy.
Dean frowns, and glances at the man on the terrace stairs again. He’s looking at their direction but quickly turns away, chugging his beer. “What makes you say that?”
“He doesn’t know that because we’re”, Dean flicks his eyes away, realizing how dumb it’s gonna sound, “we’re, you know, sneaking around.”
“See you in the morning”, he says before he leaves the room and walks down the hallway to his bedroom.
Cas pushes himself up from the table and closes the laptop, “If it makes you feel better”, he laughs quietly, rubbing a tired hand over his face. He crosses the kitchen to wait for his turn to prepare himself a snack after Dean’s done, continuing, “though I would expect you to be a bit better at handling the changes in your emotions than our three year old.”
The list of movies stops moving on the screen as Cas stops scrolling down, turning to level him with a look.
Dean’s taking a break from work for now, because Bobby’s the best employer and uncle in the world, but Cas is getting back to work full time soon, and to be honest, Dean wants to get out of the house as well.
checking up. They’ll meet up with the shrink a few times. It’s to support them and to support Jack in this situation. He’s just turned three, so Dean’s not sure how much of this he actually understands, but he’s happy the kid’s looked after by someone other than him and Cas too.
“That’s what they told me when they dropped me off, the paramedics”, Cas clarifies, “I thought they were joking at first, but they really thought we’re dating.”
Dean’s an idiot when he’s desperate enough, letting his guards fall down to enjoy the moments this whole day has been full of. It feels like a good idea for that second it happens, but it fucking sucks when the moment ends, because it always does.
There’s a toddler running into his arms the second Dean steps into the apartment. He grabs Jack mid run and holds him high above his head, before letting him drop for a second only to grab him and hold him close, as the toddler giggles from the adrenaline rush.
Dean swallows as he stares at Cas, already regretting his choice to pair Cas’s already too hot outfit with the freaking hat. He needs to stop thinking with his dick.
Dean’s fear must be painted all over his face, because suddenly there’s a warm hand holding his, and he turns his attention to the gentle look on Cas’s face.
He really wants to kiss Cas, he wants to kiss Cas like he’s never wanted to kiss anybody. He kisses people in the search of the high it brings, in the heated moments, but right now, Dean can’t think of anything else more grounding than kissing Cas could be.
She’s standing too close to him too, but considering how Cas seems completely unbothered by all the unnecessary touching tells Dean that he’s used to having her touch him like that, and there’s another ton of bricks of jealousy to the face right there.
“What? He’s my friend too”, Charlie shrugs, “Besides, I thought you’re past the whole ripping each other’s heads off -thing? It’s not like I invited you with the same piece of cardboard, yours is prettier, I promise.”
“It was my birthday a week ago, so does that mean you’ll take care of that?” Cas asks, pointing at the dirty pile of plates.
“I can take the dishes”, Cas suggests. Putting Jack to bed should be a piece of cake, you basically had to carry him to the bed and if you’re lucky he’s asleep by the time he hits the surface.
This is the second time only this fall Dean’s in the principal’s office, sitting next to Claire, who doesn’t even pretend to look ashamed. Dean sighs as he listens to the principal and the teacher explain what his daughter did wrong this time.
Cas pushes himself off the door frame and sits down on the barstool by the kitchen isle, not giving his hilarious joke the reaction it would’ve deserved, “I said I’m drunk, not blind.”
Dean’s watching after her and misses the way Meg walks up to him. “He’s calling a cab, so you might want to hurry.”
Dean doesn’t have time to ask about it when the others join and the conversation switches to something else.
“Because I have, Bobby”, Dean says, eyes hopeless, “At first I thought I’m an okay guy for this dad thing, but I don’t know, lately I just”, he lets the end of his sentence hang in the air because he doesn’t know how to finish it.
“Thanks, Jody”, he mutters, and pushes himself to stand. He hears Jody assuring Jack that he’s staying close by where he can still see him, while he gladly takes the second to himself that she offered.
“What if Jack hates me?” he blurts and blinks at himself, “I–I mean what if I’ve fucked up, and, and Jack just–”
The kid’s section is the only one with color on the furniture, standing out from the rest of the architecture, which is more suitable for the building itself, old and earthly colored.
When he’s gone, Dean has no idea where he is, but he doesn’t ask. ‘Cause that’s the thing, it’s not really his business to even know. They’re not in a relationship, hell, they’re not even friends. They’re just two guys raising a kid together, which is as weird as it sounds.
Dean parks the car and they walk upstairs. He commands Cas to the couch while he opens all the windows and the balcony door to get as much fresh air in as possible, but needless to say, the smell is still awful.
Charlie beams when she opens the front door to them, sounding slightly drunk already. She’s wearing a black costume with thigh holsters and her hair curled.
“I’ve told you I should be the one who cooks”, Dean says, aiming for a joke, but Cas just still looks guilty.
“There’s never time for that, there’s stuff”, he answers weakly to Charlie, holding his fingers up for his list of excuses he’s come up with already, “There’s Jack, work, schedules, there’s playdates, getting groceries and cooking dinners, you know,
“The kid lives with you, Dean”, the redhead deadpans, “He’s a pretty smart kid, too. I mean, you guys share
He’s just feeling good and safe around Cas. He loves him, he loves their kid, this family they’ve formed. And that’s not to say there aren’t any crappy days or fights or sleepless nights sometimes, because of course there is.
“You should all be in the picture! Family portrait”, he explains as he pushes Dean back in front of the table too, when he’s trying to escape. He takes his phone from his pocket, “Where’s Cas? He was here just a second ago.”
“What was that?” Sam asks suspiciously, eyeing the door and his brother, "If I didn't know better I'd say you two are starting to get along."
about it. “We are the parental figures for him, so it makes sense he has learned to use a word like that.”
But Dean’s fine with it, really, because he’s realized that there’s as many ways of being a dad as there’s Dads, and on a good day he’s starting to find it pretty easy to believe he’s not like his father was.
He squints a bit when he opens his eyes, careful not to move his body at all, a habit he has when he knows he’s waking up somewhere other than his own bed and might need to make a quick and quiet escape.
“Me too”, Mick says, a charming smile playing on his lips, and for a moment Cas lets himself live in a world where anything behind the front door doesn’t exist.
Cas is already staring at him with an expression Dean can’t really name. Dean expects Cas to comment something jokingly, but he doesn’t. Instead, his lips curve slightly into a smile, but it’s not an amused one.
“Cas here thought we’re sleeping together”, Charlie reveals, and that gets a similar reaction out of Dean than it did from Charlie.
He turns his attention back on the two next to him, “I’ll build you guys one too, should you ever want one”, he says casually.
“Okay that’s enough, Jo”, Dean cuts her off, moving to stand between her and Cas as if that would protect the other man from hearing more. Jo has a playful grin on her face as Dean glares at her, “Why don’t you take your crap to the guest room and settle in?”
Dean drops his eyes, shaking his head, “I’ve really started to see the similarities”, he argues weakly.
The restaurant Mick has picked is cozy and intimate, with soft, dim lighting and small wooden tables, beautifully set food with an expensive wine list to go with it.
“Good”, Cas says, trying to be fine with the answer he got, even if he’s desperate to know more, to have Dean tell him how he’s doing in more detail, like he used to, “That’s good.”
“I don’t like you either, but Sam wants us to work together”, he snaps, lowering his voice after that, “The ring is in section F.”
Jody places a hand on his shoulder, and he looks up at her. She places a coffee mug in front of him.
Now that he really thinks about it, his stupid daydream about happily ever after with Cas makes even less sense. Hooking up is basically what the first interaction between the two was about; Cas was literally some random person at a bar he was trying to hit on.
“Maybe I want to take my time”, he starts to explain, but he doesn’t sound like he’s reasoning it to Dean, “maybe I’ll date him for real and I didn’t want to rush it”, he continues with a bit more heated tone, like he’s frustrated, “There wasn’t anything holding me back, maybe I was just tired, and didn’t feel like it”, he goes on as he steps closer to Dean.
“You joining me here was really nice”, he says, when the laughter fades away and only just tugs the corners of his mouth to a smile, because it’s his turn and he’s running out of things to say. His hand finds the small of Cas’s back, on its own and without Dean’s permission to sneak its way there.
He wants to add that if Dean would want to hang around him for more than short moments at a time, he might remember how tall he actually is, but when he glances up, Dean’s smiling at him.
“That’s the spirit!” Charlie praises when Dean puts the empty cup back on the tray, “If you liked it, there’s more in the kitchen.”
He trails off, and Bobby doesn’t say anything for a moment. He just stares at Dean long enough to make him feel weird and anxious about it.
Cas just nods at that and says goodbye to Charlie. The two of them make their way to the front door as Cas disappears somewhere in the direction of Dean’s bedroom.
Cas nods, pulling his notebook from his bag. He grabs a pen, “The guestlist is probably the easiest part”, he says as he makes notes.
hi! a little bit late again, i'm sorry. i was just trying to write some cute little misunderstandings, but these two snowballed it to another level.
Fortunately, Jack yawns, getting tired even if it has been quite a show so far. He falls asleep before the story is over.
They share a helpless look as they weakly try to get the kid to the same page, but the kid’s not an idiot, he’s not going to agree to it.
Dean freezes and under the hand that’s resting on Cas’s shoulder, he feels the same taken aback reaction on him. They both look up, eyes meeting above Jack’s head.
If they can avoid Jack turning into a monster like that, when there’s actual witnesses going to be present, they’re doing everything they can to keep it that way.
For a second, Cas actually thinks about grabbing Mick by the arm and pulling him out the back door, but it’s a stupid panic thought, and too late anyway.
Charlie clears her throat to get everyone’s attention, stating that she’s never made out with a man, and that fortunately makes them both drink and stop with the staring.
The kisses get more urgent and Dean pushes Cas gently on his back, throwing a leg over him, straddling him. The man under him lifts his head and Dean takes it as an invitation and places his lips on Cas’s neck, just below his ear, where he starts a trail of wet, hot kisses down the skin of Cas’s throat.
The grief lands over them at that, heavy and painful. Cas feels it in himself, he sees it on Dean. For a second, he wants to get up and sit next to Dean, share the weight of it with him.
Dean tries to ignore how good it feels, being pressed against him even with the blanket between them.
“I don’t know, Dean”, Cas starts, leaning heavily against the door frame, “I would say I am intoxicated enough to not be considered lame.”
Dean hands her the flowers, “If he’s anything like his mom back in the day, a grand entrance to a party would be very suitable.”
Dean was annoyed about Cas’s night out, and he didn’t enjoy seeing all the smooching at the front door, but he enjoys seeing Cas like this even less. Like something’s bothering him, and he’s trying to hide it.
And if he would be completely honest with himself, which he’s not, having Cas pressed against his side feels quite nice.
Fortunately, the man in question seems to be more functional than he is and takes the tote bag with Jack’s stuff from the hospital, picking him up. Jack’s content in Cas’s lap, so he carries him out of the building when they’re ready to leave.
. He shoots his eyes up where Cas is already staring. “I mean—" Dean stammers, “Not that they know that.”
Waiting is the worst and comforting at the same time. You’re in a constant lack of information, but there’s no bad news if there’s no news at all.
On the other hand, if he tells him and it’s out there, it’s Cas’s embarrassing problem to deal with, so maybe he should.
“Anytime”, Dean gives the man his signature smirk before he goes back to the uncomfortable seat to wait for his own clothes.
The title the caller introduces herself with is so long, that Dean doesn’t catch her name, but it’s someone from the child protective services, calling because of Jack. She’s calling him because he’s the godfather, and after a quick but complicated explanation she asks if he’s available to come to the office tomorrow.
“Yeah”, Dean agrees, “And when you love someone you don’t mind sharing your room with them”, he adds, giving Cas’s hand a squeeze.
“Okay”, Dean says with a firm nod to no one in particular. He stands like he’s getting ready for a serious mission, “Let’s do it.”
Jack propped up on one arm, Dean opens the fridge door and puts the stuff from the table there, one by one with his free hand.
Cas’s smile gets a little brighter at that, and they both take generous gulps of their cups until they’re both coughing.
Jack instantly sits down in the middle of the aisle and opens the book. It’s colorful, with beautiful painted pictures filling up most of the pages, and only short paragraphs on each page. Jack starts pointing at the animals he spots there, naming them as he goes through the pages.
Dean answers quite quickly based on how fast Jack is introducing himself with an excited, “Hello, Dean, it’s me!”
The rest of the sass and the teasing smirks are gone when Dean settles on top of him, moving as slowly as he could, giving the man under him time to adjust. It gets intimate in a different way when Dean rocks his hips, their sweaty foreheads against each other, Cas’s fingertips running up and down Dean’s back, nails scraping the skin here and there.
They’ve waited for so long Cas has no idea how long it’s been. He would place his guess in hours, but it feels like days. He’s watching Dean walk around in circles, face hard as a stone, hands in fists so tight his knuckles are white.
“Hi Bobby”, Dean smiles. It hits him right there just how long it’s been since they’ve seen each other, when Bobby pulls him in a tight hug, patting his back with a strong hand, like he always does.
“What do you mean?” he plays dumb, which is ridiculous because Charlie is his best friend, and he’s too tired to constantly keep his guard up.
The kids disappear the second Dean spends too much time picking the right kind of steak, but he finds them quickly as Claire accidentally makes a bunch of oranges fall to the floor when she pulls one from the center of the pile.
“Shame, it’s a nice change to your usual lumberjack look”, Cas mutters and Dean’s not sure if the man is mocking him or saying he looks good. Dean prefers his normal look over this stupid penguin outfit, thank you very much, but Cas looks gorgeous in his black tux, even if he would look more like himself with a messier hair.
“She owns everything in that section, including the ring”, he explains, “and they’re planning to empty that section this week. She probably has the ring at the party next week.”
Dean wants to ask about the sleeping arrangement, but he can’t think of a way to ask that’s not fucking embarrassing. Cas answers Bobby’s question for them because it takes him too long.
A tiny voice speaks behind him, and Dean lifts his head from where it’s hanging, another ugly wave of emotion arriving, but this time instead of anger, it’s guilt.
No reaction. Dean sees a little bit of blood on Cas’s hairline, he must’ve hit his head bad. He tries to rip himself free without succeeding. “
Dean’s just being a good friend and Cas could’ve said no if he wanted to. It’s just that Cas was going to spend the holidays alone in his apartment and you should spend Christmas with family, or at least some people and there’s people at Bobby’s and it’s chill, and Dean had been so scared Cas would think it’s weird, him inviting him there, but Cas had just said yes. They came up with the schedule for the trip, and that was it.
Dean lets out a frustrated huff and looks up, ready to tell Cas to fuck off. But when his hard eyes meet the blue ones and he opens his mouth, what comes out instead is:
of them”, the kid rats out, and the two of them can’t keep it in any longer and just start laughing.
Cas’s eyes get so soft at that as he stares at Dean, and he hopes the man would just grab the stupid juice and they could be done with this.
Dean nods, “No, yeah, I know that.” Thanks to Cas being there. “But thinking about that night made me realize that, uh, and this comes way too late I know, but I—I never apologized to you”, he explains, forcing himself to look into Cas’s blue eyes, “I was just so angry, and I took it out on you, and it wasn’t fair.”
Dean’s cooking dinner when Cas finally comes home. He looks tired and stressed, bags under his eyes as he glances at what Dean’s making, when he comes to the kitchen.
“I suggest we figure out the work hours, and use this to generally book time away”, Cas continues, “I know it seems stupid, but we have to do something about this.”
“I don’t know if we’re doing the right thing here”, Cas says, to the sky like a confession, “I don’t know what the right thing is. I just miss you so much–we all miss you.”
“Dean!” Jack snaps him from his thoughts, slapping his thigh with a toy truck, “It is stuck”, he says and Dean grabs the toy from him, already hearing the uneasy tone on his voice, which indicates a tantrum coming.
were uncomfortable. How hard is it to choose comfortable seats for a place where people have to spend time just waiting for something?
Rowena MacLeod is obviously rich, because she’s able to host charity events at old museums and own stuff in rare collections, but Dean still whistles a bit when he looks at the mansion-like house in front of them. There’s a lot of ground to search during the night, but it’s fancy.
It’s a warm Saturday afternoon, and the driveway is already packed with cars when Dean arrives at Kelly’s house. He parks the Impala further away from the house, behind some grey Prius. He takes a quick peek at himself from the rearview mirror, but there’s not much he can do about his appearance, since he’s coming straight from work. Reaching towards the leg space of the passenger side, he grabs the orange flowers he got for Kelly before getting out of the car.
of them, so she wouldn’t get upset –  paired with the Paw Patrol cups and some napkins that had flowers and butterflies on them.
Cas hands him the bed sheet he’s picked up from the dryer, sighing, “Why are you so interested in this?”
“Should we—” he starts, breathy, just as Cas says, “We should—” grabbing Dean by the wrists and walking them backwards out of the kitchen.
Well, not just that. They’re best friends and have been for a long time. They lived together before, and it’s not like Dean had anything left when Cas told him he’s gonna move for the new job. There are fires everywhere, he might as well put them off in another city, where he gets to see Cas as much as he’s used to.
They come back inside just in time to see Charlie gathering everyone to the living room, announcing she’s up for a game.
The flirty expression on her face gives away the true question behind the one she’s just asked. Dean returns the smile, chuckling a bit. It’s a simple question that used to have a simple and sure answer, but it’s not anymore, and Dean knows why.
“Yeah, okay. I guess I’ll make time”, he chuckles and sits down on the slightly wet, cold grass, staring more at Cas than the flowers.
He manages as much as to fill the sink with hot water when he hears a gentle knock on the front door. He closes the tab, listening if he heard correctly, when there’s another knock.
“Yeah, maybe I should”, Cas snarls quietly, but so close he might as well brush the words against Dean’s skin, and it wouldn’t make a difference.
They walk past a few shelves to get to the one Dean was looking for. He stops the cart and checks the selection of hair ties next to all the other hair products. He grabs a packet of black, elastic hair ties and turns to explain to Jack his plan to solve the hair problems, but when he turns around, Jack is deep into whatever is on the bottom shelf.
Listening to the conversational sounds coming from Dean’s room all the way to the kitchen because Jack had left the bedroom door open, Cas waits for the coffee. When it’s done, he pours it into two cups before he can second guess himself.
They all have different ways to deal with the waiting. Kelly’s father stays silent most of the time. Mrs. Kline cries, desperately arranges things, and Cas focuses on trying to calm her down every now and then, grounding himself in trying to ground her.
The annoyed, but very green, and very real eyes stare back at him as he catches his breath slowly. It takes Cas a second to realize what just happened, but he’s very glad he’s under the blanket, because being stared down by Dean after
He feels Cas’s eyes on his side profile so intensely he has to turn to look, “Look at the camera, you’re ruining the picture by being weird”, he says, but his tone is too soft.
the biggest!!! thank you!!! to everyone who's read this story, and to everyone leaving comments and kudos! thanks for being with me along the ride, making my days with your comments and helping me through the writing struggles <3 i keep coming back to your comments whenever i need something to make me smile :)
“You can thank Jack you’re even allowed to be here, this cute thing makes up for you mocking my delicious drinks”, she jokes, tapping at the card full of C:s.
“You know what you do have, though?” he asks and before Novak can say anything, he flicks his brush at him, “Some paint on your shirt.”
Cas doesn’t push it, like he never does when he knows Dean’s gonna say something but for his own stupid reasons just can’t right away. He just looks at Dean like he always does, patient and calm.
He remembers many afternoons spent at Bobby’s garage, a smaller business back in the day, but similar to the one he has now. Those are one of his happiest memories from his childhood, even if, as he got older, he knew that the reason behind all the hours spent at the garage was his parents’ nasty divorce.
“It’s PB&J, Cas, not a Michelin star dinner”, Dean cuts him off, half forcing him to take the plate, before taking a new piece of bread for himself, putting all his focus on it.
The kid’s whole face lights up with a smile, “I’m very important”, he states contently, with his almost-four-year-old’s confidence, and it gets a chuckle out of Dean.
Cas wakes up to a birthday song early on a Friday morning, before his alarm even goes off. He opens his eyes and lifts his head from the pillows just in time to see Dean crouch a bit so that he’ll fit through the door with Jack on his shoulders. He’s balancing a tray on one hand and he’s holding Jack by his feet with the other, singing loud enough to cover for both of them.
Novak’s keeping his always so serious gaze on his work on the wall, making long strokes with the brush. Dean looks at him during his short walk back to the bucket. He has gotten taller since last summer – but he’s still shorter than Dean, at least – and his jawline is getting sharper, voice growing lower each summer.
Dean is definitely not imagining that right now, as he can’t help but turn to look at Cas. The man notices him staring, and Dean raises his brows expectantly.
, Novak?” he manages. Before the other boy can answer anything though, Dean strikes back on reflex, painting a white line across the shirt he already stained a bit.
The grin on Dean’s face falters a bit, because it's weird for Sam to associate Cas with Eileen, but okay.
Cas could date Mick. He’s a good man and they share enough interests to have things to talk about, he’s handsome and polite.
He laughs at Cas’s dead serious tone, “Okay, I know we have the house and the kid already, but can we date like, at least a week before we start to discuss marriage?”
He grabs a glass of champagne from a waiter right before he reaches the bar, plastering his best grin over his face.
Cas turns his attention to Jack, so he doesn’t look so guilty under the younger Winchester’s eyes. The kid is glued to his leg, and he crouches down to his level.
“You have to take it, kid”, Dean says, but his tone is understanding of why Jack doesn’t want to, “You’ll get to drink all of this juice afterwards, promise.”
Dean says something that makes the kid giggle, and they talk for a short moment before Dean probably tells Jack he has to get back to work, because the kid answers with, “Okay! I miss you!”
Jack is too busy stalking the other kids at the jungle gym and back at the sandbox he’s once again dragged away from, he completely ignores the plastic container Dean’s trying to hold in front of him. Dean tries to offer the snacks gently at first, but eventually Jack gets annoyed at him waving the container at his face and he places his tiny hands firmly on Dean’s arm, pushing it away.
“I hope you find it worth it”, Cas wishes without looking up from his book anymore, “I’ll see you tomorrow morning, eight am.”
“All magic”, Rowena confirms, making a gesture with her hands, “Well, this one”, she corrects herself, “The charity event? Real.”
“No”, he admits, annoyed that it wasn’t enough of a reason for Dean, “but he will if you keep that up, and I have to work,
“Yeah, well. It’s probably taken anyway now that it’s finally working again”, Dean says, hand stretched out for the keys Sam hasn’t handed to him yet.
“I know, but I kind of changed my plan last minute”, she says, and it’s not uncharacteristic for her, “I want his godparents to be people who are close to me, and who I love and not just because we’re related”, she explains, “and if I’m being completely honest, maybe sharing that helps you two drop this weird beef.”
Dean calls Sam when they’re making their way back to the bar where he met with Cas earlier. “So, that was a bust.”
There’s a shaky breath on the other end of the line, and the crying makes it hard to understand what she’s saying.
“Anyway”, he finishes, and sips his beer so he’ll stop being embarrassed. He feels stupid for being at the bar, even though it is his night off and he should enjoy it.
Cas looks taken aback, and as Dean desperately tries to find a way to correct what he just said, Cas’s eyes harden, and he suddenly backs Dean against the railing.
After fighting silently with Sam at the corner of the entrance, earning a few weirded out glances from people, Sam forces him to
Mick looks at him, smiling, and Cas returns the expression as the conversation moves on. Cas is doing his best to focus on the moment and enjoy it. He does a surprisingly good job at it as they move to more interesting topics, and time flies as Mick is telling him about his current research project at the university.
As Cas turns around to get himself a cup from the shelf, Jack climbs on one of the barstools to grab Cas’s phone from the kitchen isle.
Cas chuckles at that, even if he’s pretending to ignore the two, staring down at his own absentminded doodle, where three stick figures are staring back at him.
Jack eyes them both, but Dean can’t look at him. There’s so much Kelly in him, and he would cry, and Jack doesn’t deserve that.
The next time they met at the laundromat, Castiel made a comment about knowing now to choose another machine, thanks to Dean.
Dean’s super close to calling Sam for legal help when he negotiates with the toddler, and he’s ready to live with mud everywhere if it gets the kid out of the bathroom, but as Jack examines Rebecca a bit more, he too realizes that the mud is inconvenient, and it smells bad.
“I have my boyfriend I could do that with”, Dean counters as he takes the remote to channel surf. Cas lets him do that after all the suffering, and because he wasn’t really paying attention to the show that was on.
“I swear to God you two idiots are the most fifteen-year-olds in their first relationship I’ve ever met”, she muses, taking out her phone when it makes a sound, “Which is hilarious considering you’re dads”, she continues, reading the message she’s gotten before typing something back.
“You chose this shirt”, he reminds Dean, who lets out a frustrated groan, dropping his head against the mattress.
When he returns to the couch, he sits down a bit closer to Cas than before. Cas doesn’t seem to notice, or mind.
The way Cas looks at him reminds him too much of that time under the mistletoe, and his smirk falters a bit under the power of that look.
“Yes”, Dean answers and feeds Jack the last spoonful, putting the plate on the coffee table. He gets up from where he’s crouching, “but I ain’t feeding you too”, he jokes, lifting the blanket to slide underneath it as Cas takes his freedom to go eat.
They drink the stupid little juice boxes in silence, eyes flicking at everything but mostly they’re just staring at each other, sitting so close to each other their legs brushing constantly, whenever one of them shifts.
