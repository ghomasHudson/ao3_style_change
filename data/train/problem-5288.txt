Castiel had been wrong before. What intelligent adult hadn’t? But he had never, ever been more wrong than he’d been at the door. Or any time he’d pondered the potentially beneficial uses of hypervigilance.
“Alright, lay it on me,” he prompted.
Cas dropped a small kiss on his forehead and angled Dean’s head so he could look him square in the eye.
When they joined Sam, they saw he had pulled up YouTube. They ended up watching Queen music videos instead of a movie, all three of them in awe of Freddie and what he could do. Sammy had more or less missed all of that, and Dean had heard the music, but never really seen the videos. They followed one music video to another and were surprised to find that they’d been at it for almost two hours when Cas finally got up, stretched, and excused himself, again thanking them profusely for his gifts.
“You may be on to something, but an acronym isn’t going to work when everyone’s name starts with a consonant. Besides, we want it to be different, not difficult.”
She nodded and turned to leave.
it's technically only half a date, really, but I wanted each of the two very important things that are happening here to have their own chapter to stand out in.
“Yes.”
“Yeah, sorry. When I said I notice things, they’re not usually the kind of thing that will be useful to you in tracking down a killer, or whatever. There was a glint. A cruelty in the glance. And it was directed at the child, even when they were looking at you.”
Garth Brooks concert. It didn’t strike him as an event their particular brand of extremists would like to disturb. Some sort of interchurch picnic at the park. Too short, too spread out. Take Back the Night event on campus. That did sound like something they might want to disturb, but it wasn’t usually that well attended. It was more of a fly by event. The people that came didn’t normally stay long.
“It’s actually well past lunch time.” Sam corrected. “Are you hungry? I could fix you a salad or something.”
The text came in just as he was trying to talk himself out of showing up at the garage with lunch.
“That’s an expensive costume. That – that didn’t come out of some cheap Halloween party store, Charlie.”
“Dean, all the questions just… faded away. You looked happier than I’d ever seen you, relaxed and at peace. Your fingers were drumming along to the beat on Baby’s steering wheel, the sun was playing across your face, spotlighting your freckles, adding highlights to your hair, and you looked –“
“Maybe?”
Cas walked back into the room, still with the towel around his waist.
“You got a coat? It’s going to get chilly by the time we’re done eating.”
“Hell, yeah. If I’m going, I’m going all out. Just need to find a Solo costume.”
The location wasn’t great. A lot of open space, hard to find cover if it became necessary, or a safe place for backup to standby within easy reach. There were security cameras around, but Dean pointed out at the appointed time they wouldn’t be much use, they’d be west of the cameras, as would the close to setting sun.  They’d had a look at footage from the day before around the same time and yep, they could expect silhouettes at best from those. They’d have only the hidden body cams the officers would be carrying to rely on. They had decided where to stand, which way to face, and a million other details Cas didn’t have time to stay for. Eventually, they met up to get a late lunch.
“I see this guy walking by down the sidewalk, and he just stops like he remembered something and turns into the parking lot. He kinda weaves a little maybe, not like he’s drunk, but more like he dropped his keys or something. Anyway, he finally gets up to my door here and he’s all, buddy, you need to switch buses.”
“What kind of rule?”
When they weren’t fixed on the lyrics, his eyes came right back to Dean, over and over. He’d thought he was looking for reassurance of the am-I-doing-this-right variety. In retrospect, he was probably looking for a reaction. Dean kept drinking, doing his bit as the supportive tipsy friend.
Cas just shook his head.
“That was the BEST -”
“You were so good with him, Dean. You heard him out. Nudged gently here and there, but you didn’t make his choices for him. You told him they were his choices to make. You did it for Sam too. Saving people and killing things, that’s your job. Helping people be the best version of themselves, that’s what you do. You didn’t tell them who they were, you helped them figure it out. Watched out for them while they worked it out. It got me thinking. That maybe you could do the same for me.”
He decided to start with a two-block area, and carefully traced a red line two blocks in from the coastline. After stopping a moment to consider, he filled the area with red wiggly lines. There were a few small lakes. They were not being searched, and Cas pondered whether to eliminate a two-block area around them. The call had said water. Lakes would qualify. But these were small lakes, not likely to have waves or otherwise be noticed by someone theoretically being held inside. Still, if he was planning something he didn’t want detected and there was a lake nearby, he would have made that distinction clear. He decided on a solid maybe and pulled out the yellow marker.
“Hello, Dean.”
“You know that’s a gay bar, right?”
Since I fell for you, (or You Don't know me) by Lenny Welch
"I love you," he whispered into the darkness, as if he couldn't quite believe it.
Cas stopped, then heard himself chuckle at the look on Dean’s face.
“The boy has short light brown hair, and light eyes, probably gray or amber, but hard to tell. He’s wearing jeans and a Ninja Turtles t-shirt with a blue hoodie. He looks about 7, maybe.”
He found the clinic where it always was, parked directly in front of the door and left the car running. When he walked in, he didn’t bother talking to anyone. He imagined Dean was in the room that passed for both an ER and an ICU. He knew exactly where that was. At least, he used to. Striding through the clinic purposefully, he found that he was being watched by a number of people. Mostly in shock.
“Cas -” he cut in. “What I needed was a punching bag,” he swallowed hard. "And we have one, in the workout room. Yeah, I know you did that for me before, and I know you could handle it. I have never forgotten who you are, at your core. But that doesn’t mean you should have to take any of my bull, whether or not you can. You deserve better. And maybe I was a little too used to taking my shit out on you. I needed a reality check. Knowing you could leave if you wanted to… I never thought you would just…”
“I’ve been kind of a jerk lately, so I thought I’d get you a gift to make up for it.”
“I think it works better in a car.”
Cas tilted his head, confused for a moment, but copied Dean’s gesture.
The omega nodded prettily, and Cas gave her a celebratory hug, before beaming one more blinding smile into the room, and then instructing everyone to pair up and practice that move with their partner until they could do it just like that.
“Lisa’s great. Ben is about to start 4th grade and his best friend just moved away, so he’s decided he wants to go to his friend’s new school.”
“Very. How roomy is it?”
Cas nodded with a smile and Dean reached for a piece of apple. It was the apple he wanted to gobble up. That was why he undoubtedly looked like a starving man looking at a feast. He needed him some apple. Yeah, this could work. But he was so busy psyching himself up he sort of fumbled the apple, his fingers slipping and getting caramel sauce all over them.
Dean’s eyebrow shot up.
He didn’t realize he had actually voiced the thought until Charlie answered him.
“I didn’t fall. Nothing happened to me. At least, not accidentally. I wasn’t a victim of circumstances. It wasn’t sudden, or out of my control.”
“I’m sorry, who?” his hands stopped fussing with the ingredients and he looked up at Cas. “Who was maybe an angel?”
“Is shared humor a necessary component of romantic relationships?”
“More than I want my next breath,” he finally answered.
“I tried so hard, but I always seemed to end up failing you. And now it seemed I was going to choose my pride over your – over you.”
“I want to smell like you all the time, and I want to smell myself on you when I scent you.”
“Is that-” Parker leaned into the desk for a better look. “Son of a bitch! That’s the guy from the stakeout.”
He ran his fingers through his hair, messing it all up again.
“Dean, we didn’t exactly get off on the right foot and I think before we go any further maybe we should clear the air a bit.”
So, it's been a few weeks, starting with crazy overtime and ending in the ER, so apologies for the late update and the less than inspiring formatting.  I'm told I have to take a few days off, so there should be another update in a day or three.
It was his day off, but now that Cas was thinking about it, he had to see it. He went into his office, locked the door behind him and cleared his desk. His map was in the bottom drawer, where he kept it for when he needed a visual of the area. He’d had it laminated years ago, so he could scribble and mark it up as it suited him, and just wipe it all off at the end.
Cas had smiled then, mostly amused, but also delighted.
“Let’s go.”
And now Dean got restless. Was Cas going to call? He found himself getting up and starting to follow Cas out of the room, then stopping short and pacing. He was going to sleep, that was all. Sure, he’d slept most of the day, but well, he was hungover, that was to be expected. He wasn’t calling, was he?
They headed for the door, discussing what they’d be having for dinner now that they couldn’t hit the food court. Eventually, as they walked out into an unexpectedly late afternoon, Cas decided on Mexican food, from his favorite restaurant.
The crowd that had been focused on Vader now looked to Solo, and back to Vader, who was turning to move away. Darting forward, Dean scanned the crowd.
His omega? His
“I’m not on probation.”
“Does it have lyrics?” Kevin asked.
He felt the air movement as Castiel inhaled deeply.
Sam offered Michael his hand politely, leaning in as Michael shook it to add significantly, as he squeezed perhaps a little harder than strictly necessary.
“I have to go,” he snarled at Garth. “Lisa needs help with something.”
“Okay, we can work with that. If he’s worried about her, maybe she’s worried about him.”
His head disappeared again, and he focused the camera on each of the band members.
It felt like the closing door dismissed Detective Novak for the day. He tucked his badge and gun in the compartment hidden in the arm rest and yanked his tie loose. This time, when he looked at Dean before setting out, he stayed there, sharing the delighted amusement he found in his eyes.
“I’m cool,” Dean snarked from his well-ventilated Han Solo costume. “Princess?”
“You spend a few years travelling the world alone and moving back into your father’s house just doesn’t hold any appeal, I guess.”
What was he worried about now? He nosed reassuringly at Castiel’s scent gland and dropped a few gentle licks around it.
“You’re safe here, I promise.”
“To the beginning,” he finally said. Their bottles clinked together, and as the music went on in the background, he found himself getting lost in the possibilities. It was Castiel’s voice that brought him back to the moment, repeating, through a smile.
Dean’s head shook.
He kept turning back and forth, the shrill voice getting more shrill every time.
“And what’s in this wing? Why does it need a hospital?”
“What’s happened?”
“Get her out. GET her OUT. GET. HER. OUT.”
Dean smiled at the memory, and at the irony.
“Give me up? Waste my time?”
“Thanks for the support,
“Man, I haven’t seen you in ages! Where have you been?” and Garth’s delighter smile hugged him as surely as his arms did.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know your name yet.”
“You’re not living here?” Kevin seemed surprised. But it was Dean’s snap to attention that Cas answered.
“I take it yours didn’t,” it was meant more as an acknowledgement than a question, but Dean answered anyway.
“Hi, everyone. I’m not anywhere interesting today, just my new apartment, so if you’re not interested in a bit of a personal update, feel free to go on to the next video right about now.”
“Some of you have asked about this before, but I never really gave you an answer. I think it’s time. In many of my videos, I am playing something on the guitar. You’ve asked me what it is, and tried to identify it, but I never said.”
Truth be told, if he thought they were just going to frighten the girl, he’d be less worried about it. He’d heard too much of their racist bull to be confident that was all they would do with an opportunity like this.
“Everyone keeps telling me stories about your Jimmy. He’s quite a guy.”
He’d decided to go for a drive to clear his head. 50 miles later, the road had relaxed him enough to figure out a few things. He turned onto the interstate and headed for the nearest town, drove around until he found a music store and bought every Queen CD they had. Then he went to find a small stereo and an mp3 player.
Cas chuckled, grabbing Dean’s shoulder.
Cas and Dean snickered at that, making Michael bristle.
“I understand your motivation. But there must be a better way.”
“I’m afraid that’s privileged information.”
That’s what started the conversation that ultimately started the fight.
The man nodded like he understood everything, and signaled the bartender.
Cas got up, and Dean was able to think again.
Dean straightened up, as half a dozen people he hadn’t known were in the room closed in around Castiel and leaned over him. Dean heard him gasp, as you would if you’d just had the air knocked out of you by getting dropped on your ass, hard. A few moments later, there was a cough and then –
“What do you want to do exactly?”
“Ready to go?”
Castiel’s voice faded out and the song played. Dean watched it twice before looking down. It had been maybe 10 minutes since that notification came in. There were already hundreds of views. He made himself look at the video again. The way they looked, in their regular jamming at Benny’s clothes, the way they moved and played together. They looked like they were having a great time. They looked good. So good, in fact, he heard himself saying it out loud just as the song came to an end the third time he played it.
“Sir,” he started to say. But Cas didn’t even fully turn around, his posture and his tone dismissing the man entirely and daring him to continue to waste his time.
Looking up from the open file, Castiel shook his head.
“I also told him I was onto him and here with a cop, so he better use them to settle up and tip his waitress.”
He went back to his office, grabbed the papers all over his desk, and left. He had things to do. He should go to the venue and talk to the organizers. Look for potential hot spots where someone might hide, or where they might hide something. Like a bomb, or a gun. Familiarize himself with security procedures and personnel. Check out the layout of the building.
The moment he lifted the lid, the scent got impossibly thicker and mouths started watering all over the room.
“O, but I can brother. The deal was no contact.”
And Garth let it go, the same way Benny had. Kevin, already getting set up, carefully avoided eye contact and the topic both. Which is probably why when Cas called bullshit, all 4 of the others stared at him as if he was out of his mind. But Cas had grown up with Dean’s temper and dealt with it when it was fueled by puberty. He hadn’t been intimidated then. He wasn’t about to start now.
He saw a man stand up, then crouch to surface later a few seats down the aisle. He would put money on that being the guy they wanted. The other guy, the one that dropped his popcorn, he never got a very good look at. He had light colored hair, as far as he could tell. Average height, probably, though that was hard to judge while he was sitting down. He seemed fit, healthy. Alert. Restless. He seemed to be really focused on the movie. The kind of guy who came here to watch a movie and not to make a scene and ruin everyone’s evening. He must have seen something when he dropped the popcorn.
“He said this bus wasn’t safe to drive. I asked if he was a passenger and he said no, he was a mechanic. So I told him what we’re supposed to say, you know, if people ask about safety stuff. The buses are checked out between long trips, and so on. There’s like a little script that we kinda memorize. I can get it for you if you like. But anyway, I was just getting started when he just shook his head and went off again, down the road.”
“I like it.”
Dean had no response to that, so he didn’t offer one.
He should go after her, shouldn’t he? But if he was honest with himself he didn’t want to. He wasn’t doing anything wrong. He was just watching a video of his band playing their first original song. He was excited about that. She should have been too. They’d been together long enough that he deserved better than this. Lisa should know he could be trusted around an ex. He’d never given her any reason to be jealous. And so he stayed, and he tried to go back to looking through his music collection. He found he was no longer in the mood.
There were many places in Eden he quite liked. Jimmy’s room, where he had lived for a couple of weeks was one. In that time he’d found a few treasures left behind deep in the bottom of a drawer or pushed to the back of the closet. A blurry photograph. A hand drawn picture. A broken toy car that Dean felt compelled to fix.
Cas. He’d never really needed anyone before. He’d never felt like he could. Needing things he could handle. Needing people? He had always been a loner, and content to be alone. In his own life, in his own bedroom, in his own bed. Not like he’d had a choice before. He had a choice now, though, and he was afraid.
He felt it pressing down on him, some need to say something, to do something, but he wasn’t sure what, wasn’t sure how, there was just instinct. Deep-in-the-gut instinct, the kind of drive that was usually only  a part of his rut.
“It’s been years since I fell, Dean. Grace or no grace, I am no longer an angel. This is my body now, my true form. And this body is male. While Jimmy lived in it, it was drawn to women, it seems. But now that it’s mine it seems rather more interested in men. Or at least in one man. That would make me gay.”
Dean could see the calm reassurance Cas had meant to offer slip for a moment, and he made himself wait, letting his scent speak for him.
The next time he saw Cas, it was half-way through day 6. He’d been sneaking around scrounging for food and beer, and had walked out of the kitchen to find Cas about to walk in. Cas looked vaguely, cautiously, hopeful, and Dean felt like absolute shit. And then he turned and scurried away like a rat. He was going to fuck this up so badly he wouldn’t even have Cas as a “brother” when it was all said and done.
“So, I was thinking maybe you’d like to try out the back-”
Castiel’s arms pulled Dean closer, held on.
“We got it, Cas.”
“Nope. But I think I know how I can find out. I’m going to make sure he sees me going to the bathroom. He might follow me and I can maybe get some answers. At least a name.”
“I’m not,” he managed to say.
“The truck is out of control, ma’am.”
“But the new nurse has always been a woman, ergo, Dr. Sexy’s type.”
“There’s no shade and the line is about 4 days long.”
“You wanna go with me to Comic Con?”
. They ended up taking Dean’s order of cannoli to go. They split that sitting on the hood of the Impala when they finally made it back to the station.  It took a while.
So Dean sank into the couch in his living room, and not even watching the comments roll in brought him out of his funk.
“We did.”
Then remembering he meant to use the bathroom he asked Cas to get him a nurse.
Cas waves his hand dismissively and snuggles closer into Dean’s warmth.
And that’s when his mouth ran away with him and solved his problem without his permission.
On autopilot, his hands went to Castiel’s knees, stroking gently, nudging his legs apart so Dean could get closer. It wasn’t close enough. Slowly, his hands made their way up Castiel’s thighs and around to the back of his hips, nudging the towel off in the process. He heard a strangled moan, and then Cas was leaning in for a kiss. That was a hell of a good idea, so Dean dove in, giving as good as he got. Castiel’s hands tightened in his hair just as his own hands tightened on his hips, and again Dean’s instincts took over and pulled Cas closer, the towel forgotten entirely already.
The bad news was that the camera angle provided very limited information. He could tell they were all men. Two appeared to be of average height and one somewhat taller than that. He could list what they were wearing, and roughly what their hair looked like. But that was all he had so far.
“How did I do?” Dean asked, suddenly remembering all the times he’d been a complete dick to Cas over the years.
If Charlie smirked a bit at that, well, she had a vivid imagination. Cas was not leaving without the ACDC tee for one. Plus there were a few more things he’d need. He wouldn’t be hiding this time. He should take the valuables out of his safe, clean out his fridge. He had no intention of coming back any time soon. There was no need to leave a mess.
“I thought we were here to fight for freedom, not to scare little girls.” The detective tried again to deflect, leaning in to stage whisper it to Jones.
He picked them out of the crowd soon enough, all camo pants and bad attitudes. They either always dressed like they might just casually walk through Fallujah on their way to the mall, or they coordinated their outfits for his benefit. He honestly didn’t know which was more pathetic. He angled his body so that they would be in view of the camera and kept his own eyes on his food.
“Uh, sometimes our students need medical attention. This wing teaches
He froze the video in that critical spot. It was hard to be sure, but it seemed that popcorn guy would have had a great view of their shooter when he dropped the popcorn the second time. Maybe even when he dropped it the first time and cleaned up his mess.
“Cas…” he whispered. “I need you.”
Dean has some clearing of the air to do as well.
“Advanced aerobics is great, it is. Everyone should know some of that. But I think it’s important to note there are a lot of things around most omegas that could be used as weapons, if they know how. Kitchen knives, mop handles, skillets… just off the top of my head. A few solid moves with those could give an omega an important edge, especially if they’re outnumbered.”
He was halfway through his emails when he was startled out of his skin by the sound of the door opening. Nobody else was ever here this early. He collected himself before he looked up to find Benny walking up to his desk.
“You look much better.”
“So what are we looking for?” Charlie called out, not quite keeping up.
“Beats me, man,” Dean ran his hands through his hair and tried to shake it off.
He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. That was the signal that the team had everything they needed here. Castiel pulled out his phone, made much of checking his messages (really turning off the camera), and announced he had to go. He was needed back at the station.
“Two, you looked so different and so put together and it felt so
He’d made it quick, to his credit. He knew Cas would be the kind of guy to look for answers, to find a way to stick with him and make it work. He’d hold a candle for Dean as long as it took, he knew that. Dean couldn’t do that to him. Already Cas had been talking about taking a gap year and getting a local job, save up some money before going off to college. He was only doing that because Dean was a year behind him in school. Castiel's parents had money. He didn't need to save for himself. He was doing it for Dean. Because they’d been best friends since the day Dean and Sam had found their way to this town and since that day Cas had been there for Dean and Sam every day, more so every day, until a year later he might as well have been Sam’s other parent.
“My delivery instructions say to leave it the basket just like this on his desk. Also, can you make sure that it’s clear of any papers or unvarnished wood or any kind of leather or-”
Charlie looked. From where they stood they could see two R2-D2 droids moving around among the people in the food court, and at least one in the vendor booth area they had recently left.
“Anyway,” she went on, relieved she didn’t have to voice it, “Jimmy came in a few minutes later. He heard some sort of struggle going on, so he came right for us. I’d tried to escape into my room, so that’s where he’d trapped me. When Jimmy saw what the man was doing he just… couldn’t help it. He got so angry. He really tried to follow the rules. He tried to get the alpha off me, but he wasn’t strong enough at that point. The alpha shrugged him off like he was a pesky bug. But Jimmy kept at it until the alpha had to let me go to deal with him. I scrambled out of the room as fast as I could to get help. When I came back, it was too late. The man was dead, and Jimmy was just sitting there, covered in his blood.”
Dean flipped the tape and looked at the cover. For side B there were no notes, only tracks. The first one was “The Impossible Dream”.
Determined not to waste any more time, he tested his strength, and found he was good for a short walk, if not another hour of pacing. He headed for the doors, determination in his stride.
“You ever notice how people don’t really know what a kidnapping is?” she said, in an aside, to Bobby. “Maybe we should do an infomercial or something.”
“I’m not good at this. The closest I’ve ever had to a relationship, you know, aside from dad and Sammy”
“The mixtape?” Sammy jumped in. “You know, the mixtape Dean made for you? That mixtape?”
The idea presented itself that they had been talking like people who know each other, thus far. The man had not demanded to see his badge, not had Castiel pulled it out (yet). They had recognized each other, and both remembered the first time they met well enough for this brief, stunted conversation to suffice. This was odd, right?
He got up then, walked out of the room declaring he needed a drink. Sam sat in silence for another moment, then disappeared to his room with a lore book under his arm.  Dean sat where he was, thinking about every time he’d ever made eye contact with Cas and followed that up by picking up a waitress, and suddenly he couldn’t bear the weight of all those small moments. He needed to apologize, even if it was Dean Winchester style. And so he sat there, waiting for Cas to come back.
“Charlie, I think this is the guy from the theater.”
“Isn’t that part of the thrill?”
“And yet when Mr. Holt calls to tell us what the voices are saying we don’t rush right over, do we?”
Naomi sputtered in outrage, and turned towards the door, no doubt to make what would have been a dramatic exit, except that Donna and Benny were standing there, shoulders against the sides of the door.
“Sam. Am I … am I a jerk?”
He shook his head then, as Kevin gave an understanding nod.
He sat at the bar and looked around. Well, it was certainly colorful. He didn’t really go to bars much, but he didn’t see what was especially gay about it. He reached for his wallet, intending to pull out enough cash to get himself a drink. That’s when he realized that he walked out without his coat or his wallet. Of course he did. He had only meant to go for a walk.
“You know I don’t actually get hungry, right?”
“There, see?” she pointed through the bit of clear plastic that stood in for R2’s “eye” camera.
“What if the plan was never to blow up the mall at all, and they just wanted a building that could stand in for a convention center? What if that’s why they’re not here?”
“He had an incredible voice. And talent, sure. But angel?”
Ah. Time to get chewed out then. Tonight he was more fit to handle it, so Dean braced himself.
She hid her trail anyway, because what kind of a hacker would she be if she didn’t? She probably didn’t need to worry about it, she decided, a couple of hours later, when she finished printing the evidence they needed. After all, if they tried to prosecute her, all this would have to come to light and well, that just wouldn’t go well for Novak Aviation.
“That narrows it down to only about miles and miles of coastline.”
There, that was reasonable, right? And safe, since he’d more or less done that last night. He saw that Cas was still listening, so he continued.
“Dean - ”
“Dean, we need to – talk.”
It was more than a few minutes, but eventually, Cas disentangled himself and resumed the tape. When Dean heard the twang of a country song, he sat up straighter. He looked delighted. Stunned, maybe a little shocked, but definitely delighted.
Cas was perhaps, too amused by their reactions, but as he was bending over the bundle, unwrapping the pastry, and nobody was looking at his face, he didn’t try to hide it. The perfectly golden crust came into view, and the hand that had removed the basket, or one just like it, produced the pie server that had been tucked into it.
Thus far, he hadn’t really eliminated much. Although, a lot of what was eliminated was the sort of area where they’d normally look for criminal activity. The sort of area you go to when you don’t want to be seen. Of course, if Miller was involved with the terrorists as Brown had suspected, whatever they were planning, they’d want a well populated area to unleash it on. Which was pretty much what he had left.
“Cas?”
Dean opened his eyes lazily, his body more relaxed than it had ever been. He should have felt trapped. The wall was still at his back, and everywhere else was Castiel. Cas was slumped against his front, his weight holding Dean in place. Cas’s thighs were under him, cradling his body where it rested just off the floor. Cas’s arms were around his waist, keeping his body close, steady, safe. Cas’s knot was inside him. He arched his back ever so slightly, just to feel it tug, and felt a languid smile break over his face.
Dean didn’t know what Cas was planning, but he was pretty much up for anything that would put a smile like that on Castiel’s face. This seemed promising.
Now that he was hearing himself say this stuff out loud, it kinda sounded dumb as hell, actually. But he was committed now, so he was going with it.
He was hurt. He was maybe even in real danger, if that thing was poisonous.
They were mostly dry by the time they broke the kiss, and Cas let the towel drop from Dean’s shoulders, sliding it gently down his back until it reached his waistline. Then Castiel’s gentle smile turned hungry, his hands fisted in the towel and he pulled, bringing Dean’s body snuggly into his. Dean went, his lips poking at the hot coals in Castiel’s kiss.
Cas stood as tall and still as he could, unintentionally looming over the desk, fire and brimstone in his eyes.
“IT FEELS LIKE FLYING.”
I could just about touch that star
Her eyes jumped to him in what read suspiciously like concern, and she jumped up to produce the water.
“Not my first rodeo, Cas. Keep an eye on his father.”
It was too early to sleep and he knew that if he didn’t keep his mind busy he would fall apart. So he tinkered with his videos and ultimately decided that he needed to store them somewhere other than his phone. For starters, because what if he lost his phone? He didn’t like cloud storage, as a rule, and that had limits too, so it hardly seemed like much of an improvement. And also, because he always seemed to end up recording fairly long videos, and even if he did ultimately trim them down to a reasonable size, he needed the room to accommodate the initial recording. That’s how he ended up uploading them to YouTube and falling asleep while he waited for the slow, slow motel wifi to get it done.
“See you later, Dean,” Garth returned.
“Good morning, indeed. Best morning ever.”
Was there going to be a date portion? Dean had said “It’s a date,” but people say that when they just mean that the proposed time and place are acceptable. Not that he could recall a man saying it to him in that way ever before. And Dean had mentioned dating a guy in the past.
“Both.”
Abandoning all thoughts of paperwork, Cas headed for his office, dropped the equipment he was still carrying and started looking for Dean. If the car was here, Dean was probably here too. Cas probably wouldn’t have found him if he hadn’t decided to take a shortcut by going to look at the security cams. Dean was on the roof.
“We’ll work on this in my living room for a bit while you guys… talk.”
“Just a thought. It’s what we’re here for, after all. To figure out what our best options are.”
“Fair point, I think.”
He had not actually considered the evidence in that light yet. So he spread the file contents out on his desk and dove in.
“You should cancel that,” Jody cut in. “We’ll wait, then.”
“Mr. Novak, Mrs. Novak. You are wanted in connection to several felonies in my jurisdiction. Be advised that if you are seen in the area you will be apprehended and held for questioning.”
Cas was standing under a tree, overlooking Lawrence. Dean recognized it immediately. It was a good place to think, up there on that small hill, just far enough out of town for peace and quiet.
“I’m driving home in a bit. Hey, you’re not driving, are you?”
“You GOTTA get her OUT,” he was all but shouting. “We can figure out WHY later, dammit, get her OUT. NOW.”
“So now what?”
“Is that…”
“Also, I don’t know how to slow dance.”
They went inside, Cas settling by the kitchen island while Dean washed his hands and went back to the chicken he’d been working on. There was a roaster waiting on the counter and some kind of sauce simmering on the stove top, and everything smelled delicious.
Looking for something that could be remotely familiar, he clicked into that list and browsed through. Zion. Denali. Katmai. Death Valley. Yosemite. Rocky Mountain. Everglades. Grand Canyon. Yes, Cas had said something about this one, hadn’t he? He pushed to play and relaxed into his seat to wait out the ad.
“It sounds really creepy, right? But it’s just that he’s trying to learn to identify smells. He never learned, I guess, growing up. He can pick out the big ones, you know. Fear, arousal, happiness… But the more subtle feelings he struggles with.”
They called off the search for Miller. Cas had sold it to the brass by making the case that if they stopped searching, and just pretended they’d more or less forgotten Miller even existed, whoever took him might reach out to them with some demands, or somehow make a move that would allow them to find him. It would at least be unexpected, and the perps might be provoked into making a mistake they could use. They held a service for Brown. Full honors, broadcast live on TV. No mention at all of Miller was made in any capacity.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Nurse Frank is not going to be Dr. Sexy’s new girlfriend.”
He pulled Cas into his lap then, held him close. It hadn’t hit him until just now how close he’d come to fucking it all up beyond fixing. He felt his body start to shake at the thought and suddenly he had to say the words out loud.
“These days, mostly people just share playlists. Same idea, really. The songs are just online.” He hesitated before finally admitting, “I might have sent her a YouTube playlist,” and then after clearing his throat, “of those videos that show the lyrics cause, well, you know.”
“What do you mean? How is a glint directed at someone when the eyes are directed at someone else?”
“Yes. Wouldn’t you like to tell me? What’s the point of doing anything at all unless you’re trying to make a point? I’d hate to get it wrong and piss off the Mandalorians or the Emperor.”
He hesitated for a moment.
So, Castiel's adventure ended up taking more than I'd intended of the chapter, so I'm splitting it up. Look for the aftermath tomorrow.
“Who’s to say we can’t do both?” Jones replied. The other man (his son, maybe?) snickered. And Cas started looking around for anything that could get this kid out of here. He did not want to blow his cover, such as it was, but he wasn't about to let them do anything to the kid.
Cas wasn’t sure how much he should tell the captain about all this. He still couldn’t actually prove Miller was anything but a victim here. Passing along his suspicions might well get put him in the hot seat. Or at the business end of a bullet. But if Miller really was planning some sort of attack on Comic Con, how much could Cas do without the support of the station? Could he even get the weekend off, given that there was a big event and Miller was still missing? And if he could, could Cas, Charlie and Dean alone stop him?
Frank looked kinda dazed too, he was noticing. And kinda soft and delicate. Dr. Sexy probably thought he was looking at a girl. He heard himself smirk. And quickly glanced at Sam and Cas, only to find them both glaring at him.
He was updating his case file with the new information on the mystery man when his door opened.
“I want to move into your bedroom.”
I'm not going to lie, I've been wanting to get to this one for about two weeks now, hence all the quick updates. There may be another one tomorrow, but likely not for another week or so now that I got this far. I hope you enjoy reading this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it.
The omega still had not moved when Cas turned to the watchman again, his voice all calm assurance.
“I could have handled everything and shrugged it off if we could work through it. What I couldn’t handle was the feeling that you didn’t want me around anymore. That there was no working through that.”
Something about getting the message. But the way he said it… Like he’d just said something important and they didn’t know it. Like there was a clue, but he was sure they wouldn’t see it. Another Vader crossed his field of vision, this one escorted by two Stormtroopers. The crowd had decided there was nothing interesting left to see here and was dispersing. Charlie was still talking to the station. Cas had removed Chewie’s head and was repositioning Vader while reading him his rights. A barely contained C3PO chirped and walked around like he was looking for someone. Luke, maybe. Or –
The hand on Castiel’s hip slid around to the small of his back, and Cas leaned closer in response, eyes fixed on Dean’s lips now, drawn like a moth to a flame.
“No. I’m sure the child is fine. I just want to see for myself that she made it to safety.”
Cas looked into Dean’s eyes, wanting him to know this was important. Real. That he meant every word.
“We need a shower.”
The child looked immediately crestfallen, and Castiel pretended to be annoyed by it.
“It’s warm now, though.” Dean piped up, not about to let such trifles as not actually being hungry right now get between him and warm, fresh, delicious pie.
He was looking at security video now. Scanning the people walking into the room, stopping now and then to note the people that might be concealing a rifle. There weren’t many. This time of year most people were wearing light and cool clothing that might possibly conceal a handgun, but never a rifle. By the time the doors closed for the movie to start, he had three suspicious characters. Three suspects. That was the good news.
“I’m not calling you a liar or anything,” Cas clarified, “but I’m going to need you to prove it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And yet, when his phone rang and he saw Dean’s name flash on his screen, there was no mistaking the rush of adrenaline.
“I’m celebrating tonight. Wanna come over and celebrate with me?”
Dean couldn’t get past those few words until a nurse came in and, addressing him politely as Mr. Winchester, began to ask him a number of questions and direct him through a number of exercises. She declared he was doing much better, but still weak, and that he would now be put on a protein rich diet to build his strength. Dean crossed his fingers for bacon, but it turned out to be some kind of meat broth for today. Seems he had been out for quite a few days and would have to work his way up to solid food.
“Hey man, you okay?”
“Why, because he’s gay?”
His latest case involved a sexual assault for which there appeared to be no witnesses. Despite the fact that it happened close to campus at a time of day where dozens of people were normally around. Students on their way to and from campus as well as residents coming home from work, walking their dogs, enjoying a beer on a balcony before dinner. Officers had already canvassed the area, of course. But they’d come up empty and Castiel was hoping it was mostly because people didn’t know they had seen something significant rather than because they didn’t want to get involved. Or worse, because they were protecting the assailant.
The name of the game today was “no touchy”. Dean’s self-control couldn’t handle another session like the last two. If one of them ended up pushed against a wall today, Dean would lose his mind and things would happen that should definitely not be happening at the place where he was hoping to find gainful employment. Where Cas had already found it.
They started to get somewhere when Cas wanted to know why the boy wanted to hang out with the girl that made him sad and why he can’t see that clearly the girl next door is a better mate, even though he appears to return her feelings from the start, if the video Sam pulled up on his phone was anything to go by. That required an explanation of teenage hormones, and how miserable boys that age are willing to get if it has a chance of getting them laid.
“Not especially.”
Dean had rolled up, parked in the nearest available spot, and was now sliding out of his car. And sure, he looked nice. He was about to go knocking on strangers doors, of course he didn’t want to be messy and covered in engine grease. Did he look nice? He probably should have done something with his hair. By this time of day it usually looks like he might have been in some kind of accident, but the only thing that will keep his hair under control all day is hair gel, and well, he didn’t want anyone to think Castiel thought this was a date.
“You’re killing me, Cas. When did we hear Disney songs, anyway?”
She’d not encouraged the question, but neither had she stopped him, so he continued.
He called the resident mechanic to check out the engine and called the station for an expert to come look at it as well. Then he made his way to where the passengers and the driver were waiting.
When he was finally satisfied that he had it right, or as right as he was going to get it, anyway, he carefully wrote out the track list on the cover, adding a note here or there as appropriate.
He seemed lost in thought for a moment. Dean swallowed and chimed in.
“While you think about it, I thought I’d show you some of my treasures. I have travelled light for 5 years, but I did buy myself some special things and mailed them to my father’s house instead of carrying them with me. So, in return for your kindness and good advice, I’ll show you some of them now.”
The fridge alarm started flashing and beeping, and with an exhausted sigh Dean finally reached for a beer and closed the door. Before he could say anything else, the doorbell rang.
“We – we didn’t fight.”
“Something’s wrong,” Dean said, leaning closer to peer into the camera feed.
“Just… keep in mind that it’s very rough.”
But his eyes were already scanning for the source of the noise. He couldn’t see anyone walking around in the area in front of him. He shuffled, accidentally tipping his popcorn. Not having been raised in a barn, he leaned down to clean up the mess, and if that allowed him a discreet way to look behind his seat for whatever was happening, well, that was entirely coincidental. Thank goodness for modern theaters with a dozen aisles and enough space between pairs of seats for teenagers to make out in privacy. Nothing. Nobody seemed to be standing. He could relax.
And truth be told, it wasn’t much more than that before Charlie was coming back in with her laptop.
And right on cue, the staff had announced the egg rolls were ready and they were off. Muttering about what a spoilsport he was, Jones and his (buddy? son?) allowed themselves to be led away, looking for a service door.
“You’re going to get us in trouble with your mother.”
“Not necessarily,” Dean had explained. “It’s rare, especially in teenagers, but you can fall in love with your best friend. It’s the best, when it works, but high risk.“
“I’m afraid so,” Cas deadpans.
It was about 3 hours after Dean had stomped into the garage certain that his day was going to be shit. He was standing on top of the world.
Great. What this situation needed right now was a stray kid.
Dean hesitated, but Cas gave him the time to choose his words as carefully as he liked.
“Speaking of…” Dean turned to Cas. “My probation is over a little over a week. The next hearing is my last.”
“Sam, thank you for checking in. I’m afraid we got… a bit distracted.”
Shorter chapter today, and not particularly inspired, I'm afraid. Sorry about that. I should have probably waited but i needed a distraction from well... today. I might revise this at some later time and make significant changes, I might not. I suppose it depends on how I feel about it when I'm not such a nervous wreck.
“Dean, wait!”
“I have a plan that could get us – uh, some old junkers to fix, demonstrate the skills. And then we could maybe… have a restored car that we could send someone off in, if they needed wheels. Not everybody, obviously, but if there’s one with young pups maybe, or an injury or something.”
“Got it, she repeated.”
“I’ll wait. It’s” she smirked “kinda personal, if you catch my drift. I’m not supposed to deliver it to anyone else.”
“I don’t know that smell. What is it?”
“You are scary sometimes,” he mumbled.
“That’s right, little omega. You
“Cas, I get that you’re frustrated, and I want to help, man, I told you before that you’re family, but-”
“Because in December they’re made of love, Dean. Of snow days spent sledding with your best friend, and making snowmen in the yard, and snow forts. Of quiet memories and looking forward to a white Christmas. Of standing at a window with the ones you love, enjoying the beauty as it falls down around you, and freezing noses, and hot cocoa to warm them up. In February it’s just that annoying thing that’s going to make you late for work. It’s dangerous driving conditions, and damage to your paintjob, and mud under your boots.”
Dean flinched slightly. He had hoped this conversation would wait till later, but well… at least it would be over with and he could stop worrying about it.
It was the middle of the night, and Baby rolled away as quietly as she could be expected to. Cas stood there another minute, watching her disappear into the darkness.
“I’ll be there in 10.”
Dean turned in his chair, facing to the side, acting out a conversation.
“Well, this one does. So, I was thinking a few days ago that I wanted a way to offer help without pressuring you to take it, or a way for you to let me know discreetly that you need help, or that I’m pushing you in a direction you don’t want to go. A way for you to tell me you need me to behave like an alpha. And also a way for you to tell me when I’ve crossed a line and need to get the alpha under control.”
There was not a single bit of evidence that placed anyone besides Miller and Brown at the scene of the shooting. Or even appearing to approach the scene. No traffic cam footage, no tracks, no prints, no parking lot security film, nothing at all. The immediate area had been canvassed, and anyone found in the area had been questioned, and there was nothing there either.  It was entirely possible that Miller killed Brown and then just walked away. But why?
“I don’t know if I ever thanked you properly for that. I don’t know if I could have gotten through it without you, man.”
He had some breakfast, the happy, lazy mood he’d woken up in completely shattered. He found that his morning exercise walk had turned into pacing up and down the hallway for an hour, and he decided that this was good. He was irritated, and restless, but clearly his strength was improving if he could pace this long without collapsing. Still, he went back to his room, and sat on a big lazy chair in a discreet corner. Hopefully, she wouldn’t be able to see him through the window. He really didn’t want any more insight from her right now.
“Thanks,” he awkwardly nodded. “So, what’s good besides the garlic bread?”
The boy only nodded, but he could feel tension and relief fill the boy.
He took another step closer, Chewie’s faint protests in the background completely unnoticed.
Dean looked at his hand, found the syrup, and cleaned his finger. In the movies this was always the sexy bit. He should have locked eyes with Cas, then fluttered his eyelashes or something and licked his finger like it was something else entirely. He couldn’t, though. It had always seemed so- fake.
Had Cas told them about what had happened between them? He found that he was suddenly mortified, but before he had time to examine that, she had continued.
“It wouldn’t have, if I’d had one,” he ruefully shook his head. “you don’t pick up hypervigilance at the school’s book fair.”
He felt the joy of it cut through the tension. He was in love with Cas. Cas was in love with him.
“Actually, about that -”
“I know, it sounds pretentious, but my followers started calling me that somewhere between Salem and the Grand Canyon and it stuck, so I decided I might as well embrace it.”
Sam’s head popped into the doorway.
Between the four of them, they’d had more close calls and miraculous returns than anyone had any right to dream of, much less expect. The sort of thing most people called a second chance. But this felt like it was the first time Dean had a real second chance. A chance he could actually make use of. He wasn’t going to waste it.
“I, uh… ”
“Want to kiss me some more Friday night?”
“And really, pie is a dessert, which comes after a meal,” Kevin added.
“Thank you for being there for Sammy when I wasn’t.”
Aziraphale and Crowley were perusing comics across the open area and beyond them was…. Beyond them was the food court. Good place for a bomb, really. It would be packed at certain times. Lots of trash cans you could walk right up to with a bundled-up bag of something and leave it without arousing suspicion. But no, that was too easy. What kind of message would that send?
Dean had asked for the carnitas burrito, and even though Cas was more of a carne assada man, he got carnitas as well. Just for a change is all. No need to read too much into it. They ate in front of the TV that night, laughing at Knight Rider reruns, and if Miller didn’t come up, well. The point had been to be available to be asked, if Dean wanted to know.
“I’d better save some of these for the next time I need some advice,” he chuckled. “Thanks, everyone. Thanks for being there for me. See you again soon.”
“Dean -”
Cas broke the kiss, dealt with the towel, and led the way back into Dean’s bedroom, and into Dean’s bed. He seemed determined to keep it soft and sweet, all gentle hands under the covers and petal soft kisses. Dean wanted to chuckle, make some wisecrack about hesitant teenagers making out for the first time, but none of it feel uncertain or juvenile. It felt tender. Vulnerable. Life-changing. Almost terrifying, in its own way. Each touch seemed calculated to reassure and soothe even as it stoked the fear. He knew in his bones there was no turning back from this.
“He is. I just wanted to thank you,” that was Parker, working her way in.
That got Castiel’s back up, so he set the guitar aside and stood up, matching Dean’s belligerent tone.
This was also Garth’s assessment when he arrived a minute later and saw the way Dean was pulling his guitar out of its case.
“Yeah, sure. Sounds good.”
Dean nodded. He would have nodded no matter what excuse Cas provided right now.
They hadn’t been strangers in a while, but the moment you sink a blade into a guy only to watch him tilt his head at you like that was a quaint human peculiarity kinda sticks, he’d found. He’d been fearsome, Castiel, Angel of the Lord, with his booming voice and his wings flaring behind him. Or at least their shadow. He’d have to see if he could get a look at the real thing one of these days. If that was even possible. And here he was now, Cas Winchester, eating food he couldn’t really taste to bond with his family.
It had been two days since he’d fallen into an exhausted sleep while Dean fell apart on the roof of the station. Curled into a ball had turned into collapsed on his side, and rocking had turned into visibly shaking, as if he was breaking down. Cas had meant to watch him all night. He’d been woken up when the morning shift had taken over. His eyes darted straight to the rooftop, which was now empty. He checked the parking lot and found Dean’s car gone. On his own car, he’d found a note.
“Maybe I’m just yours, Dean.”
“Why are you here?”
They were tossing name ideas around when a knock on the open garage door made them all stop cold and turn to look. Garth stood up, knocking over the can of Tab he’d been sipping at, and sending him scrambling to clean it up. Dean stood up slower.
“So far I like the sound of that. Does it come with benefits?”
Somehow, they pulled it all off. And with skin to skin contact the urgency seemed to fade. Hands gentled and took their time exploring. Lips brushed everywhere they could reach, seeking out sensitive spots, stopping to nuzzle, to scent, to worship.
Dean gets that. The only one he’s ever given the best part of himself to (well, before Cas) was Sammy. And yeah, now that he was all grown up it sometimes was just like that. The best he had to give was not what Sam needed anymore. Or even what he wanted most times. Some of it was leftover habit from when they were kids and Dean was taking care of him. But he knew that all those times he cut deals with demons or Death or whoever would deal to get Sam back, he was doing something Sammy wouldn’t want. It did bother him a bit, to know his brother didn’t want his gift. But he gave it anyway, gladly, with no regrets.
Cas extended the t-shirt he’d been wearing all day.
“I’m Detective Novak. Can I have a few minutes of your time?”
"We haven't lost yet," Cas agreed.
“He gives the music anyway, because it’s his special talent, it’s what he’s good at, it’s the best part of himself and it’s the very best thing he has to offer.”
Dean forgot to be irritated by the interruption. He was cool with her being here and talking, as long as it was Cas they were talking about. Should he encourage her to talk? It probably wouldn’t take much, considering. But it felt underhanded and wrong somehow, to pump her for information. Still, he could hardly be at fault for what she might say if he just let her talk…
“A shooter is a threat,” Detective Novak pointed out.
“It also has the best view. So, some survival advice for you guys. Find your rock, and cling to it.”
It had been rough, the first week. But if there was one thing Castiel was well used to, it was being hurt and left behind by the people he loved. He was a pro at compartmentalizing by this point in his life. A month in, this was really the only time Dean was inescapable. When he set up the phone to record and sat in the moment, holding the guitar he’d bought to play in the band he’d joined with Dean, wondering if Dean had been here when he travelled around with his father, wishing he was here now, thinking about showing him where he’d been since he’d left, he couldn’t shut Dean away.
“I have a delivery for a Mr. Castial Novak?”
“Yes, but the threat is in the anger in his eyes, not the pigment.”
“Why are they purer in December, Cas?” he couldn't help asking.
“I was hoping you’d say that,” Dean slid his arms around Cas for a moment, then made himself let go. “We don’t have much time. Any second now -”
Half a cup of coffee later, he was cooking up some bacon, eggs ready to scramble next to the stove and a few slices of bread waiting by the toaster. Should he make something for Sammy? Pancakes, maybe? He could whip up some batter and toss them on the griddle when he heard Sammy come in and head for the shower.
He made himself shut his mouth. If he really focused, maybe he could make himself shake his head. It might be easier if he closed his eyes. He closed them and shook his head slightly.
“Yes, that deal.” He snarled. “This is contact. The deal is broken.”
It was weird, waking up without a sense of urgency.
Cas waited, for all the world a man ready to take his well-deserved punishment.
Dean’s eyebrow shot up. If they were going to make new rules every time someone was upset it was going to be an awfully long list.
“But – but paper covers rock.”
Dean looked up, prepared to tell Cas about his idea. But his mind went blank again and he heard himself tripping over his words.
“But if they try and he fucks it up - ”
“I’m just saying, he always sleeps with the new nurse, Dean.”
He turned, determined to make his way through the crowd.
He got to Cas just in time to stop him from closing his bedroom door and shutting him out entirely.
“Dean your boyfriend?”
Cas offered to do the dishes, being the only one that hadn’t cooked, and Sam went to pick out a movie, leaving Dean standing in the kitchen. After a moment he grabbed a kitchen towel and started drying the dishes in easy silence while Cas rambled about how much he enjoyed his new mp3 player and some of the songs he hadn’t heard before.
“And he was under a lot of pressure to be straight. That always confuses things. I used to think I was asexual, you know. Angels are supposed to be. I was always told that I was, and I was too busy training the garrisons and fighting monsters to give it any thought. And then I had sex and, even though it didn’t turn out the way it should have, I guess, it was the first time I had any reason to wonder if maybe that wasn’t exactly true. And what wanting to have sex even felt like.”
“Those things are meant to be background noise. It would have to be really close to the phone to be heard that well,” Cas reasoned.
“Wanna make out on the couch like a couple of teenagers?”
“I’m fine,” Dean’s voice sounded as exhausted as he looked, and Cas actually considered turning around and coming back tomorrow, but Dean had said he was fine, and this time Cas believed him.
“Well, I was checking because I found myself worrying about how you were doing without Sam. And, honestly, for my own sake too. You and Sam were the only ones who’d ever encouraged me to question and make my own choices. When the questions got too big to hold back, I popped over to check on you,” he shrugged. “I was invisible because I didn’t really have a good reason to be there and I was… well, embarrassed, about the way things had gone down.”
Everyone suddenly started moving, calling into radios, and reaching for gear.
He settled into a deep reclining seat, and carefully placed his drink in the built-in cup holder. He had maybe a minute to figure out how to balance his coat and his popcorn before the seat was due to recline. He spent it arranging and rearranging both, determined to keep his attention on his own space tonight.
He reached for Dean’s hand now, pulled him closer, and Dean went, gladly. He didn’t stop until he was in Castiel’s arms, nuzzling his neck, breathing him in.
Dean’s hands reached out to settle on Castiel’s hip and waist, gently, slowly, allowing him time and space to slip away if he wanted to.
“I wasn’t really a fan of the opening, to be honest. But then I heard this. Listen,” he urged.
“You know, the guy that yelled fire and got everyone out a few days ago.”
“I was under the impression it was our job to serve and protect. And that we do that partly by answering every call and thoroughly investigating what we find when he get there.”
He squeezed Dean’s shoulder.
“Maybe we could make do with a comforter until we have a mat?”
“I’m Sheriff Mills, and this is Deputy Singer. We need to have a word with Mr. Novak in connection with an assault that happened in our town a few weeks ago.”
That air of loneliness that he had been fighting from the beginning suddenly won, and he turned away. That was it, that was the video. He couldn’t believe it was only about 10 minutes long. It seemed like he’d been watching for days.
“I’ve got it, really. On the desk, clear of everything.”
I'm a bit nervous about this one. Cas sings an original song here, and I've never written a song before, so let me know what you think. I've got another one on deck, but I don't know. It's weird when I can't really convey what that sounds like in my head. If it doesn't work, let me know.
“Detective Novak. I’m Harry, head of Security. Thank you for coming so quickly.”
“Well now, Jody, that’s an excellent question.” He made a how of thinking about it.
“Really, Sam?
"Of course. We wouldn't dream of bothering the alpha with such trifles," he snorted.
Within minutes, the station was frantic with activity. Every available officer was called in and organized. Waterfront real estate was scrutinized, and portioned out, and groups of officers sent to look at potential locations where Miller could be held. Cas managed to get out to “interview witnesses” just before getting dragged into joining the search.
“No, sir.”
“I think maybe I have an idea about that.”
Dean’s eyes were all over the feed. The intensity of his gaze was strong enough everyone in the mobile command center could feel it. But only Cas could see the way his body was increasingly tightening, bracing, locking up, preparing.
“Dean,” Cas started. He had no idea how to finish that sentence, so he hesitated. “Can you be any more specific? Anything at all? Why officer Brown specifically? Why not both of them?”
Eventually, Castiel got up, taking the t-shirt with him, and went searching for a bottle. Of course Dean would do something like that. Of course he would.
“Excuse me, ma’am. Sorry to bother you. You should move your car -”
Cas took another bite, and they ate quietly for a few seconds.
“What do you mean, you’re gay? You’re an angel, what does that even mean? You’re only into other angels?”
“I’ve been looking for you, trying to make sure you were okay -”
“Don’t be absurd! Just ask him.”
“You don’t have what he needs here. The risk of leaving is no greater than the risk of staying.”
“Dr. Sexy is about to start.”
“Just remember Cas is a great guy that would never hurt someone on purpose, okay? Especially not an omega. Even if he’s being a bit weird, there’s no reason to be afraid of him.”
“No, not exactly. More like how to use herbs and spices wisely. Say, for example, how some herbs will naturally inhibit alpha hormones, or how a sprig of this of a pinch of that might make someone drowsy or irritate their stomach lining. You know, so omegas know how to avoid
“I want to check it out. Unofficially,” Cas clarified.
He registers the way Castiel’s whole body stutters when Dean swallows him down. The way he goes all pliant and needy when Dean pulls back, the seal of his lips generating suction as he moves. The way he moans Dean’s name as if he can’t help it anymore. Everything is a blur after that until Castiel’s hands close around his head, his fingers sink into Dean’s hair, and Dean finds that he’s grinding against the bed.
“There are like dozens of rooms with locks in this place, you know.”
“I know what it means, Cas! I just can’t believe you would
“I really don’t have a lot of time right now, I have to go back to work in a minute but…” Cas sat on the edge of his bed and faced him, squaring his shoulders.
“I know,” he winks. “Sorry, I had to. It’s the law.”
“Now, omega! Inside!” And Castiel pointed furiously towards the back door.
“Nevermind, sit down and don’t go anywhere. We’ll talk when I’m done here,” she finished sternly.
“I didn’t do great in school, as you might guess. There just was no room left for algebra.” Dean stretched, rubbed at the back of his neck. “We moved around a lot, chasing new jobs and hallucinations. And then one day in my late teens dad just up and disappeared. As bad as things had been up until then…” Dean shook his head, words failing him entirely.
“Yeah. Like the phone is on speaker and they set it right next to the phone.”
“What if you had been wrong and there was no gun?”
“Fair enough,” Garth chimed in “but toss in some drums and other instruments – if you’ve got a good start, all you really need is the right arrangement.”
He leaned in again, this time brushing slower, closer, stopping to nibble and tug at Castiel’s lip. A shudder ran through Cas, his body melted into Dean’s and a soft moan came up to meet the kiss. He made himself pull his head back for a second, studied the dazed but eager look in the blue eyes before him, the way his lips had parted slightly, the way his heart was racing against Dean's ribs.
It took some doing, and a bit of time. Just gathering the things he needed without alerting Dean to the surprise he was preparing was tricky. Finding the tracks was easy enough online, once he’d finally settled on the ones he wanted, but figuring out how to get them from his phone to the tape without sacrificing all of the sound quality was beyond his skills. Fortunately, Sam came back with Eileen, and after a couple of days to let them settle in Cas finally asked Sam to help him figure it out.
“Charlie!” Dean interrupted. “Later.”
“Don’t tell me who I am, Dean. You don’t know jack shit about who I am or what I am into. You never have. You never wanted to. From the very beginning it was all about what use I could be to you. That’s why now that I’m fast becoming useless you don’t bother to hide your disdain.”
He was half way up the stairs when he head Cas following. He picked up the pace. He just needed a minute alone to get himself together, that was all. Just a minute. Just had to get to his room.
“O no you don’t. You had your chance, now it’s my turn, and you’re going to listen.”
Dean glanced over at Cas for a second, making sure he didn’t look long enough.
“That didn’t hurt, did it?” he joked.
In the last few months, Castiel had abandoned all thought about what he was and wasn’t supposed to do. In fact, he did at least half a dozen things he wasn’t supposed to do on the daily now. He found it quite fulfilling and literally liberating. So as he drove up to the walls of Eden less than two hours later, he did not concern himself in the slightest that he was about to do something he was not supposed to do.
He pulled up to the gate and rolled the window down. The old man who came out to talk to him looked only vaguely familiar, but he recognized Castiel, because he approached the window with the expression of a man who was about to tell him, as kindly as he possibly could, to fuck off.
“I know. If it was easy, I wouldn’t have called you. There’s got to be something we can do here, Cas. We can’t let that kid leave with the man.”
Cas came through the kitchen door and gestured for the omega.
They all snorted at that, Dean and Benny striking a pose and cracking each other up, and they really did look exactly like a group of old friends goofing around in their garage, having fun. The essential garage band.
He did not, in fact, know where to find Dean. He’d followed once everything had finally settled down. But Dean wasn’t home. And he wasn’t answering his phone. Cas headed back to the station. He wasn’t going to sleep, and Dean wasn’t going to answer, so he might as well go back to his desk and try to distract himself with paperwork.
will take care of
“O, you know… detailing. Removing difficult stains…”
He stuck the apple into his mouth with all the grace of a moose in heat, licked the caramel from this index finger, then glanced at Cas. Had he seen that? He hadn’t seen that, right? Apparently, Cas had seen because his eyes were locked on Dean’s hand.
Dean nodded.
“Yeah,” Garth continued, since Dean didn’t seem to be willing to take the lead here.
He laughed a bitter laugh.
“I think you’re right,” Kevin agreed.
She plastered her very best customer service smile on and stepped up to the desk.
“Makes sense. And we can modify my rule like that too. Omega for when I have to behave like a typical obedient omega, and Dean for the rest of the time.”
He set Dean to taking care of the kitchen and went to gather his valuables, the backpack and some of his clothes. The tee, of course, and the jeans. But he couldn’t quite decide what else to take. If he was going to help people like Benny and Ellen with their businesses, he’d probably need a suit, but the ones he owned seemed ridiculously over the top. He looked towards the suits hanging in his closet.
“We’re going in, right now,” he announced.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck and sighed.
“Do you know what you’re going to do yet?”
Dean thought.
Castiel’s smile turned coy and well… naughty.
“You teach cooking and cleaning?” Dean sounded even more skeptical now.
It seemed critically important to agree on what music would be playing, what Cas should be wearing to something like that (he’d never attended before), or what sort of street vendors would be there and what kind of food was likely to be available. None of which prepared him for the sight of Dean Winchester in a leather jacket and tight jeans. Or evidently, prepared Dean for the sight of Castiel in tight jeans of his own, one of his usual work shirts hanging loose with a couple of buttons undone at each end, and his never quite neat hair made intentionally (dare he say artfully?) messy.
“If it could be dangerous and Charlie’s going, yeah, I want to go.”
“Right, later,” she agreed.
The nurse seemed to have gone home without bringing dinner, and Dean had decided to wait for Cas before venturing out to look for a cafeteria or vending machine of some kind. As it turned out, Cas brought dinner with him, and they went in search of a comfortable spot to eat in, instead. They ended up going back to the same room where Cas had been teaching earlier and sitting on the mats.
And that was an honest to goodness wink. Castiel’s smile grew wider, as he turned to drive. He reminded himself to keep his eyes on the road. For different reasons this time. He needs to get them there safely. It’s a date. It’s a
He felt the amusement that had been building in Cas since Michael came in fade fast, replaced with anger.
Dean sat up in bed with a groan. Well, his day was off to a great start.
“Mr. Winchester, I’m actually here because I have some questions about two other incidents. You’re not a suspect in any crimes,” now that he thought about it, that wasn’t technically true, but nobody had any intention of charging him, so Castiel didn’t correct himself. “but you are a person of interest. We think you may have seen something that can help the investigation. I’d like you to come down to the station for questioning.”
Bobby snickered but otherwise said nothing.
So Castiel leaned in for a moment, locking eyes with Dean.
“Her? Officer Brown?”
“Yes,” agreed Sam. “Plus you brought him across state lines. That never improves a criminal case.”
There was a grove hiding most of the village and an area that had probably been meant for a garden but had turned into a beautiful meadow nobody wanted to disturb. There was a bird bath in the meadow, and on that first day he had stopped to look at the birds in it and imagine what they were saying to each other.
“No, really, that was GREAT. I really thought you were scared when you turned that way… ” he stopped, having just noticed who was standing by the door. His smile went wider, and he nodded, then returned his attention to his student.
“It was just… stupid, really,” Dean took a deep breath, resolving to just get it over with. He grabbed both their cups and went to the sink.
“Hey, man. You need to transfer to another bus. This one is not safe to drive,” he’d told the driver.
“It sure helps, Cas.”
Dean’s crestfallen glance at his feet, before his eyes came back to Castiel’s, spelled out “I know. I’m so sorry I was such a royal ass.”
am. Or used to be. I can’t really say anymore that I am, since I stupidly ran off like I did.”
What had he told them? Where had they discussed planting explosives?
But Dean just laughed and dropped a kiss on top of his tilted head.
Dean made himself focus on Castiel’s eyes, on the love shining out of them. Was he holding his breath? Why was he holding his breath?
Cas glanced over at Dean before returning his eyes to the road.
Dean chewed the words over as he chewed the last couple of bites of his food. For someone without human limitations, as Cas had been when they met, what do time and place even mean? What do you even dream about?
“So what do you think?”
When he opened his eyes, the first thing he noticed was the world’s worst hangover had indeed arrived. He wanted to stay still there forever, but he had to move, because the next thing he noticed was that his pillow was wet and his phone was lying next to him. Dead, apparently. Moving very slowly, he plugged it into the charger and made his way into the bathroom. One glass of water and a couple of aspirin later, he shuffled into the kitchen to get some coffee started. It was when the smell of the brewing coffee hit him that a realization started to dawn. At some point, somewhere between listening to Dean’s messages and finishing off that bottle, he’d made a phone call. He’d drunk dialed someone.
“I was here, and I could hear you talking. I… I heard you tell the guard that girl was your omega and it just – I don’t know. I was mostly pissed at myself that it bothered me to hear it. I know you weren’t actually claiming her, but -”
“Excuse me, ma’am…” she called from the desk. “Can I use your bathroom?”
In the background, he could hear the captain speaking to the officers, and officer Brown’s feed began to pan sideways, like she was slowly turning around.
“You can’t expect a guy to properly taste a pie like that. There are rules about these things.”
“I’m not sure yet, exactly. I spent about a month on campus auditing a bunch of classes when I flew in, and I’m taking some Music and Multimedia Production classes, but not joining any specific programs for the moment. Honestly, I’m a bit intrigued by the Culinary Arts program. But I don’t see myself cooking professionally, so I’ll probably just take a few electives from there and buy a lot of specialized cookbooks,” Cas shrugged. “I’ll see what happens after the first semester.”
They were well on their way to another full page of crossed out notes when Benny hit on it.
. He missed going to the Roadhouse and talking to Benny about his restaurant. Looking forward to going to work and looking forward even more to going home to Dean at the end of his shift. Another hard pull on the bottle and he was reaching for the phone he’d stashed away and turning it on.
The security guards arrived, and informed Cas there was a black and white outside, and more on the way. In his peripheral, Miller glanced towards the stage area where later the light saber battle would take place. Dean began to move in that direction.
What would he do when Cas was at work?  He’d have to see what there was to do there. But if he was honest, he thought maybe be would prefer to come to work with Cas and find some way to make himself useful
He fast forwarded to the part where the crowd was exiting the theater. He was hoping for more information but in the crush of people, he couldn’t spot a set of clothes on an average guy with no face.
A smile broke over Dean’s face as he kept asking.
“I do love it. Working with cars and working for Bobby,” Dean considered. “But I’d think about it, I guess. Depends on what I’d be quitting for.”
He liked the little apartment he had over someone’s garage. It was quiet, and safe, but it left him too much time to count the days and wonder if he was waiting in vain. It had been furnished when he moved in, but he’d bought some personal items to make it feel more like home. Never more than he could pack in a matter of minutes and easily carry, or course. Enough to leave his mark on the place, as it were.
Cas shrugged.
Without turning around, he answered all of them.
He sat up straighter at that. Maybe it was because his life had always been about keeping people alive, or because he had died and returned so many times. So the concept of not wanting to live under any circumstances was foreign instinctively. But then he thought of how willingly he’d sacrificed his life for Sammy… He’d not wanted to die, of course. He wanted to live even as he walked into his doom. But humans must inevitably die sooner or later. And what if he didn’t have to die, but Sammy or – or Cas did. What would it be like to go on for eternity without them?
“The memory, not the song, just to be clear.”
“Ah… he doesn’t want to be. That’s… that’s the problem.”
Their eyes locked. All the information that mattered right now was in the other set of eyes. They said it hurt, but it’ll heal.
“And now he’s interested in a guy.”
“I don’t suppose there’s any harm in telling you, since he brought it up, and it’s not exactly a secret when everyone knows. They don’t talk about it, bless them. I think it still feels wrong. Jimmy was kind of a favorite around here.”
“I think maybe he was an angel.”
He really wished he had Sam’s bitchface proficiency at moments like this. Best he could do right now was glare.
“What Sammy?”
Dean stood up, turned almost casually around to face the few people still in the RV.
“Dean. Dean Winchester.”
He was there in 8, though it took him some 5 minutes to find Dean in the food court.
“Here’s to making a difference,” and Dean held up an imaginary beer bottle.
“I suppose,” Cas agreed.
“Listen, Cas. That was not fair!”
“You don’t owe anyone any explanations,” Dean pointed for emphasis.
The leap of awareness alone, for a being created to be a war machine, programmed to follow orders without question, to disregard himself for someone else’s cause, was astounding. It took Dean most of his life to break free of the expectations of a deadbeat dad that was never there. Cas had Chuck, instead of an absent father. Chuck who ran the whole world. Who was everywhere and knew everything. Literally wrote his reality into being. Yet Cas was able to see himself as more than a cog. To fight for himself.
“My what?” she shrieked. “My son was not kidnapped, he got on an airplane and flew here on his own.”
The moment Cas sat down, Dean shifted his seat.
“Dean - ”
And they stood there, together, until the next song started.
“Hey, look at that guy!” Dean laughed.
The second the words were out, Dean turned beet red. Castiel either didn’t notice or did a fair job of pretending not to.
As it turned out, that Friday night was Cruise Night. It took all of four texts to work out their plans. Cas would drive to Dean’s after work. They’d go cruising down Main Street in Baby, radio blasting Dean’s best classic rock tapes. They’d find somewhere to park, then make their way back to Main Street, to get some food from the street vendors and watch other classic cars drive by. Cruise night in their town was well attended, as a rule. Cars came from all over the state. None as awesome as Baby, of course. But still, he was led to believe there were usually some truly amazing sightings. None of which explained why, by his phone’s count, they’d exchanged 73 messages in a few days.
“Delivery for Mr. Novak,” Donna chirped.
They were standing by the Impala. Dean had just dropped Cas off after their date and now he had to do the very last thing he had ever wanted to do. He straightened Castiel’s perpetually messy hair for the last time. He could feel the weight of it settling on his shoulders. Why? Why couldn’t he have this? Why couldn’t he ever have what he wanted?
“The protesters. They’re always across from the entrance.”
“You said – You said you had things you needed to learn, and you wanted my help. I said I’d help, but then I didn’t. That was because in my head you were saying that so that you could pretend not to know what you were doing when you tried to hurt me at some later time. It’s not you. My brain just does that. With everyone. All the time. The truth is, there’s nothing you could have said or done that would have made a difference then.”
“I’m going to fail again, Cas. It’s bound to happen sometimes, and it’s not going to be fair to you. I can promise I’ll fix it, I’ll make it up to you, but I can’t promise I won’t fuck up again, Cas. I’m trying, as hard as I can. I could use your help. I don’t deserve it, not after I didn’t help you. But, I… I trust you, even if I need to remind myself sometimes. Your scent is the closest I’ve ever been to being able to just relax.”
“Well? Are you going to open it?”
“An alpha rule? Alphas don’t have rules.”
“I used to, at first. But not anymore. Let me break down for you how those conversations usually go, alright?”
“Listen, I can get a bit cocky with the hypervigilance sometimes. I - ” he cleared this throat “I can feel the arousal blasting from you like heat from a radiator, and it feeds my own. But I am aware that arousal isn’t consent, so if at any time I get carried away -”
And now Cas turned to face him, and suddenly he had that righteous angel of the lord look in his eyes again.
A collective moan went through the room when everyone got a taste of the pie, and Cas finally dug into his slice. Nobody said another word for a few minutes as the pie steadily disappeared from the plates. Then a fork clattered onto a plate and everyone looked at Dean, who had finished his slice and was now eyeing the one slice left on the pie pan.
The man moved, his coat coming open in the process, and the man moved as if to reach an inside pocket.
“I had to figure out how to keep us safe, but that was the same old, same old. I dropped out of high school, got a job, no biggie. The real bitch was wondering where he was, what he was doing, and if he’d gotten anybody killed yet. It was my job to keep the world safe from John Winchester. And I didn’t even know where he was. I had never felt so helpless in my life.”
“What- what suit?” Cas hesitated.
“Easier than making a hundred phone calls, don’t you think? How’s next week?”
They hadn’t made any grand announcements, but Sam was no idiot and he had eyes.  So for the next few days he gave them plenty of space, and did not ever ask himself what they were up to. Still, it was Dr. Sexy night again, and they were MIA. He was asking himself if he should go knock on a door and remind them when they came into the room, dressed to go out.
Three more steps and Cas was reaching again. Dean lunged forward. Almost there. Then he heard a grunt, and before he knew what was happening he was pinned against the wall.
“Are we considering this place, then?”
“Count on it.”
“What’s that?”
“Hard to miss, really,” Dean agreed.
And then he was getting back into the car and driving out of Eden without looking back.
The smile got impossibly bigger and brighter and Castiel’s eyes sparkled so strongly they were almost blinding.
“What is this?” he asked. And without waiting for an answer went on. “This is very good. Might even get me to eat veggies if you play your cards right.”
He showed the picture to a few of the locals who were waiting for transit buses. He struck gold 10 minutes in.
He smirked to himself and strolled on past the fake ID lessons and found what he didn’t know he’d been looking for. Cas was sort of hunched over, a determined look in his wide, unsettling eyes. His mouth was slightly open, his nostrils flaring, and he was moving, slowly, threateningly, circling an omega standing alone in the middle of the room. His full attention was on the omega, and Dean allowed himself to lean into the door frame to watch.
How bizarre was that? That the most we worried about now was getting his feelings hurt, or Sammy and Eileen not working out, or Claire or Donna or some other of their friends running into the sort of trouble everyone ran into? Normal, everyday stuff. He should be terrified but he’d beaten god. How terrifying could old age be? Taxes? And he could have all the things he’d never been able to have before to look forward to. He could get a pet without being afraid of not coming home to take care of it. He had a future now. A real one. He was going to get old. How terrifying could death be, when he knew in his bones he'd die of old age in his bed someday and then he’d wake up in Heaven and Cas would be there. Forever was a real thing for Dean Winchester and it was like a game he couldn’t lose, as long as Cas was there.
He asked himself if maybe Cas had been about to ask him to go back to his own bed, but then Cas curled into him, almost clinging, and Dean held on. Tomorrow. They’d talk tomorrow.
Ellen had skipped the biscuits and gravy. She could make a lot of pancakes in a very short time, and she was going to be needed at the table, away from the kitchen. She didn’t know what this was about yet, but Charlie had said it was about Cas and Dean, and that meant it would get Ellen’s full attention. Something about the way Cas left had reeked to high heaven, and her boy was a pitiful sight these days.
And he walked out without another word.
“I was just back from the Empty, and we were in Dodge City, and you were walking around like a kid on Christmas morning, with your cowboy boots and your cowboy hat. We split off from Sam and Jack and it was just you, me, and Baby for a while. Playing cowboy.”
And now Cas was lecturing about sex stuff? Cas? Who had had sex like once in his entire existence? This clearly could not stand. But before he could jump in and put Cas in his place, Sam jumped in.
Dean made himself move then. Put just enough distance between them for eye contact, his hands gripping Cas just as tightly as he was holding on. Maybe they’d just have to be the rock to each other’s limpet for a while, because Dean couldn’t tell which was which anymore.
Michael reached for the phone on Castiel’s desk, his face a mask of defiance. He found Castiel’s hand in his way. With a smirk, he turned to open the door and leave the office. The smirk fell right off his face when Jody and Bobby walked in, instead of Michael walking out.
Dean’s body slipped into autopilot. He buried his nose in Castiel’s neck, driven by the need to scent Cas, to make sure that he still smelled like Cas, with no trace of that other omega. Carefully he searched, nuzzled at the neck, brushed his lips against the scent gland, wanting to read it with all his senses. Just Cas, it was just Cas. It should have soothed him, but it somehow felt wrong, and he rubbed against every part of Cas he could reach, needing to mark him.
“Cas is… special, I guess. Kinda mysterious and he does weird things sometimes, but you need to know he’s the nicest guy and he’s not at all creepy. He’s just been through a lot.”
He’d eventually let curiosity overtake caution. He’d gone to Jane’s house for dinner, as he tried to do once in a while. They’d chatted about this and that, and somewhere around clearing the table he’d brought it up.
“What, why?”
“O, come on” followed, and then some vague noises that sounded like gagging.
“I suppose it wouldn’t help things if I said I didn’t actually do that. I didn’t say there was a bomb. I said the bus was gonna blow. Which it was. But yeah, I did make it sound like a bomb threat, because I wanted them to actually do something about it.”
His body had far fewer questions. His hands moved over Dean’s body without hesitation, guided by the noises coming from Dean, the smells he suddenly was so close to, the reactions of the skin under his fingertips.
“To the beginning.”
There would be people from everywhere in the state at least, and probably tourists. Weekend long event, lots of enthusiastic fans. People would come to the event and stay in the same place all day. Lots of lines, sessions, shows, games, stores. They wouldn’t just congregate in the large building but in various groups throughout the building. Some would be wearing costumes. Costumes that often included weapons. Handy, if you were trying to sneak in a real gun or 5. Some that were just oddly shaped. You could hide anything in them.
This had to be some sort of human hangover after effect thing. It had to be, right? For a second there he actually thought Dean had asked to… no, that couldn’t be right.
“You’re wearing clothes under this? No wonder you were griping about the heat.”
“What…? How.. uh. This crust is -” Dean stuttered.
Eventually, they arrived, and Sammy was off. Cas was still holding the tape, turning it over and over in his hands. It was making Dean nervous, honestly.
“Plus, I don’t even think you’re really gay. Dr. Sexy isn’t a real person, he doesn’t count.”
“No, sir. I mean, not headed to your door. I was following that omega there. Out alone after curfew, acting suspicious.”
she lived with for a time,” but then his smile faded as he continued “and how she’d ended up alone in her 50s and had been alone for almost two decades when we met. She was happy enough most of the time, but when she was at home, in the quiet moments…”
That was it. He could get his brain to engage, he knew he could.
“Get the damn pie out of the fridge and taste it, or leave me the hell alone, Dean. Choose.
Behind him, Brown’s feed was now showing horizontal street lights and vertical sidewalks. Something dark was oozing into view along the edge of the screen.
The video started with Cas standing near the edge of the canyon. You couldn’t really see the trail, but Dean knew it had to be there. He was far from all the touristy areas, not another person in sight. No glass walkways, no cameras. Just Cas, and the stunning scenery. And then he was fast descending into the canyon as if on the wings of an eagle (or an angel), and he was looking up at the towering walls, the colorful layers glowing brightly in the sun. He still hadn’t spoken at all.
“What?” Charlie popped up.
He made his way back to the nurse’s station, and noticed a sort of supply room behind it, well stocked. And to his right, the first thing that seemed entirely out of place. Double doors. But not like hospital double doors. More like the sort of double doors you’d expect to see leading to a board room. He tested the doors and found them unlocked.
“Cas?”
Why was he going on about Lisa? Really? He’s gonna bring up an ex right now?
“I mean, he hasn’t
“Actually,” Dean chimed in, “We might not be able to prove kidnapping and blackmail, but forgery and larceny we certainly can prove. You should meet Charlie. She’s a librarian. Bit of advice, don’t mess with with a small town librarian. They have access to basically all the world’s knowledge and Charlie could break into Fort Knox on her lunch break. Unfortunately she’s all tied up right now recording this conversation.”
His fingers began to close files and put away papers even as he listened.
“I’ll be damned. He beat me to college after all. Good job, kid,” Cas chuckled before he walked out.
“I’m glad you decided not to turn into my full time my boy toy-”
How many times had he kept his feelings to himself through the centuries? How many people were there that truly knew him?
“O, yeah. I remember. I read that the driver had some kind of medical thing. Heart attack or a stroke. Something like that.”
Dean’s brow arched.
“It’s because grandma makes it just the way you like it. Nobody else would find it so perfect, because they don’t like it exactly the same way you do. Each time she fed you, she wanted to know how you like it. And you’d say it’s great, and she’d kinda pick at that until you ended up saying maybe it seemed a bit much at the end, and then the next time she’d have added a bit of something, or taken something out, and she’d keep tweaking it until it was exactly right. It’s like that. Except, I don’t need to ask you what you like, because your body tells me immediately. And my hypervigilance takes note.”
“No.” Cas replied, simple and final.
Like a man who has been waiting for this very moment, Bobby stepped up now, facing Naomi squarely.
Slowly, he traced the flesh under his fingertips, found his way in, and felt the shudder that went through Dean when he did. He made himself explore for a moment, his fingers pulling Dean closer. Later he would try to figure out how he lost the last shred of reason. Was it Dean’s whimper? The hardness of Dean’s erection pressed into Castiel’s? The wetness around his fingers? He didn’t know, and he couldn’t bring himself to care.  He lost it, released Dean’s ass just long enough to undo his own pants, and then he was angling Dean’s hips and burying himself deep. All the way in. Dean’s legs locked around his hips, and without further ado, Castiel fucked him into next Tuesday, right there, against the wall.
He had been here a total of 5 months now, and he was no further along in deciding what he wanted to do with his future. He was still waiting. He supposed fixing up cars would work. Mechanics are needed everywhere. That was as far as he was willing to go with that particular train of thought.
He lightly slapped Castiel’s shoulder, and Cas retaliated, pulling him closer and leaning over him until they were almost horizontal on the couch.
It had to be the biggest cat tree to be found anywhere. He was fairly certain that it took more room than that huge cedar Lisa had put up last Christmas. The cats were going to love it.
When Dean woke up, Cas was still clinging to his side like a limpet. For someone who never used to sleep, he had become a champ at it now that he was human. He seemed to have a slight snore that sounded more like a purr, and Dean allowed himself to stay in that not quite awake but not fully asleep state for a few minutes, enjoying the warmth of Castiel’s body. After a few minutes, though, he had to get up.
Dean dropped into the seat next to his.
“Sam is making dinner. Chili dogs alright?”
“My friend is a policeman. He’s taking care of things now. We’re going to wait in here while he does his thing, alright?”
“Always saving people from themselves, even on dates?”
“If you’re fine, why are you on the roof?” he insisted.
When they got out, Cas wrapped Dean in a fluffy towel. Dean’s warms were wrapped in the towel with him, and Castiel’s hands holding the towel closed between them created more space than had been between them in some time. Dean’s put out frown was so adorable Cas had to pause to drop a few sweet kisses on Dean’s lips. The kind that lasted forever and glowed with the tenacity of hot coals but held more warmth than heat.
There was a theme in this already, two songs in. Loneliness.
“She’s working on Princess Leia.”
“Benny, what are you doing here?” she glared.
Dean frowned, dropped the knife he’d been using to dice onions, and walked up to the sink, placing himself where Cas had been, and looking out the window. Where had he gone in such a hurry? As it turned out, not far.
He drank again, his foot tapping along to the beat as the song began to fade out.
It was mid afternoon. And it had been early afternoon on a Monday when the man had been here. Most likely, he was working today. He might be on a run, answering a call, but he might work close to the depot somewhere. Within walking distance, since he was on foot. If he worked nearby, maybe some of the staff or local regulars might have seen him around.
“I forgot she was here, actually,” Cas sidestepped, “I’ll go get her from the safe room. We should get her something to eat and get her to the center and on her way to safety.”
He couldn’t help thinking the answer to that was probably
“It certainly would,” Charlie agreed.
“You commuting from here?” Cas returned his attention to Kevin.
“Okay, let’s start with the basics. What do they look like?”
Dean ran his hand through his hair again, closed his eyes and asked himself if he could hold his shit together for a bit. He really could use a workout.
He was about to follow the other men into the bar when he noticed another bar, a few doors down.
She picked her words carefully now.
He took a step back then.
“No, I’m a mechanic. You need to turn off that engine.”
“What’s up?” Cas responded.
Dean nodded, pretty sure he wouldn’t be able to get any words through his clenched jaw, and disappeared into the bathroom.
“I get it. You’re into Dr. Sexy, that’s why you want him to be bi or into pans or whatever. But Dr. Sexy is straight as an arrow. He’s not into dudes.”
Cas made a hang on gesture, walked out and returned with the player Dean and Sam had gotten him, along with one of the CDs. He placed everything carefully, slid the CD into the player and selected the right track.
“I thought I might never see you again after that day. Walking away was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”
“I was only ever meant to be a tool. A hammer, as you said. God’s shield. But there was so much more I wanted to be and I didn’t know how. I didn’t belong in Heaven anymore, but I didn’t belong here yet. I felt that nobody knew me at all. Like nobody wanted to. Nobody could even see me. It’s lonely, not knowing who you are or where you belong after billions of years of trying to work it out. In a way, that was the day I fell, you know. Not officially, of course. But by the time I left you and Ben, I had effectively switched sides. I had decided that I was going to trust you to lead the way. You became my moral compass, as it were. It was only a matter of time after that.”
She turned on the flashlight on her phone and moved around to get a better look inside.
Cas opened the door the rest of the way and stepped inside.
One hand slid up his arm, brushed the back of his neck and gently lifted Dean’s face.
His eyes went back to the TV, and now that the crisis was over and everyone was going back to what they were doing before the alarms went off, Dr. Sexy was watching Frank walk away. And he looked confused. And his confusion was confusing the crap out of Dean.
It seemed like a good idea, even if they had no ambitions beyond rocking the local harvest festival, so they set up the phone on a stand, and played it for the camera. Then they played back the video, raw the first time, then again after Cas had made some edits. It looked good. They looked good.
That night even the cold shower didn’t help. What on earth had possessed him to insist for so long that he wanted a room of his own? He was a stupid, stupid omega.
“He’s dead. I never got the details,” Dean reached for the box, “but a couple of years later I heard that he’d finally gone after one of his monsters. Guy shot him dead in self-defense.”
Dean took a moment to look through the first door, and it looked exactly like every classroom he’d ever walked by.
Castiel’s face rubbed up and down on Dean’s shoulder.
So they’d made much of looking at the restaurant, scoping out what kind of clientele favored it. Not for nearly long enough. If he’d been really trying to help them, he’d have had some tips for them. As it was, he was happy to agree with them that their 10 minutes of looking around was good enough to determine who was likely to be hurt if something happened to the food. Having arrived at the conclusion that all the red-blooded Americans were eating at the BK or some other such string of letters, they decided to approach the counter to get an idea of how this kitchen was set up.
He wondered if everyone could see it or if it was just Dean, because he knew those eyes so well. His smile was peaceful, quiet, easy. He adjusted the camera until the screen was filled with the towering walls, and the absurdly starry sky in the gap between the two sides of the canyon. There were footsteps then, and Cas played quietly for a few minutes. Dean didn’t recognize the tune. Maybe an original, judging by the way he hesitated sometimes, as if he was still working it out. The music stopped, and then it was morning.
Dean’s eyes shifted to Castiel’s lips and he unconsciously leaned closer, breaths mingling for a moment.
“Tennant?”
“In a way, I’ve been scared for so long I don’t even know it anymore. And yeah, that made it hard to see you as you are. But I was not afraid of you. I had no reason to second guess everything you said or decide that you had ulterior motives. That is on me. And so is what I did before I ran away.”
“I told you before hypervigilance is not something you pick up at the market. It comes from trauma. From years and years of childhood trauma. I’m not…” he hesitated “I’m not going to spill every detail for you, it’s not a pretty story and most of it is done with anyway. But you should understand the basics, since we’re-” Dean finished that sentence with an awkward gesture between them, then took a fortifying swig of his beer.
“That video of Cas at Katmai was just -”
He’d sat down on a fair size boulder, and it had been warm from the sun. He hadn’t realized how badly he needed the comfort. He ended up sitting on the grass, his back against the warm rock. When he came back the next day he brought a blanket to lay on, and lay down on the grass, with the warm rock at his back. He ended up dozing off and when in that moment between full sleep and alertness, he thought he was back home, with Castiel’s warm body behind him, and the scent of crushed wildflowers and morning dew all around him. He’d been coming here every day since. When he could, he lay down for a nap.
“What do you want?” James Earl Jones’ voice asked from Vader’s mask.
don’t want to be bi. Maybe he can’t be bi, because you don’t
“I’d imagine that that was more about keeping me feeling suitably obligated to stay in a job I didn’t like than the money. Still, I probably should have determined from the beginning exactly how much she was owed.”
Later, he’d think of all kinds of snarky remarks. They had known a scrawny kid. He’d grown up, bulked up. He had stopped the constant hormone blockers, so he had grown rather more imposing too. He was wearing fancy leather shoes and a suit. And he was walking through them as if they didn’t matter in the least. If he had time for snark right now, he would enjoy flaunting all that. But he had bigger fish to fry. He burst through the doors of the ICU room and headed for the only bed that was behind a privacy curtain. He shoved it aside, and sure enough, there was Dean. Pale. Sweaty. He didn’t look good at all.
“What do
“You didn’t get the luxury of time to figure it out, like I did. When you weren’t taking care of me, or hustling pool, or saving people and killing things, you were learning how to make fake IDs or making up stories to explain away the monsters. You’ve been playing a part or another almost nonstop since mom died the first time. Sometimes it seems like you don’t know who you are under all that. And maybe it’s time you found out. Take the time to really figure out what kind of man you are, and what kind of man you want to be.”
“Cas? Dean?” they heard Sam call out.
He ran his fingers through his hair, not that he could make it any messier if he tried.
And then he felt Castiel’s arms close him in, his body pressing Dean against the wall, and Castiel’s lips, gentle despite his body language, kissing him senseless.
“Because I don’t think I can drive safely and I NEED TO BE ALONE right now,” Dean snapped.
He sounded all scratchy from sleep, but there was conviction in his voice when he slipped his arms around Dean’s waist.
Dean took the tape out of the box and popped it into the tape deck. His eyes went back to the cover as he waited for the music to start. Cas had made notes, it seemed. Side A was marked Memories, and under Track 1 it was noted “Salt and Burn, Colorado, before the fall,” which really wasn’t a lot to go by, but as soon as the music started, Dean remembered anyway.
There are now 7 people in his office, and they’re all nodding like that was worth a try.
“I already have,” Vader said over his shoulder, then turned again only to find a tiny Leia who had stepped into the circle blocking his path.
“I wish I knew, Dean.”
“That nobody knows that
“I’m… not hungry, thank you.” Cas pointed at the laptop. “Is this for a case?”
It was the longest 5 minutes of his life, but then Cas was escorting the bomb squad to their location, and one officer was lifting a model’s head off. Several other officers were coordinating the evacuation of the building so it could be swept for any additional threats. Dean was pretty sure they wouldn’t find any, but it couldn’t hurt to check it out. Comic Con would resume first thing in the morning as usual.
They had been out on a milk run in Idaho for a couple of days and returned earlier today. Dean had picked up pizza, and they had only waited till they arrived at the bunker because Dean refused to allow greasy fingers in the Impala when they were going to be home in a few more minutes. They were exhausted and starved, though, so they ate standing up in the kitchen, huddled around the island, pizza in one hand and beer in the other. Then Sam had gone to write in his diary or whatever he did when they came back from hunts, and Dean had settled in front of the TV, where he could finally relax with a couple of episodes of Dr. Sexy. He was behind and catching up with Dr. Sexy’s adventures was the perfect way to relax into a sense of, well, home.
He spent the better part of 5 days pacing in his room, afraid of how badly he was going to fuck it up even as he knew that hiding out the way he was doing right now, after that kiss, was in fact fucking it up. But what did he say? What did he do? He hadn’t been this unsure of himself when he was a teenager. Although, he’d probably been an insufferable teenager.
They sat at the kitchen table to wait, each of them nursing a beer.
And yep, sure enough, right on the stage was a life-size R2-D2 model, with LED lights in all the relevant places and rigged to make all the right noises. Dean bent over the model looking for some way to get into it.
She began to tell him all the reasons Dean should not be moved. He was hurt. He needed to rest. His vitals needed to be checked on every 30 minutes. Castiel sighed, raised his eyes to the ceiling.
“You gotta pull her out.”
Everyone moved then. People started looking around, irritated, confused. The man was also looking, his eyes darting around, as if he wasn’t quite sure how to handle the disruption to his plans.
"For kissing you. For saying your name as I lose myself in you. For other things, too" and he'd glanced significantly down between their bodies.
And assuring Dean that he’d be back in a few hours to explain everything, Castiel was out the door.
Castiel made himself stop panicking. There was some kind of plan afoot, clearly. A plan that involved him, somehow. He couldn’t mess it up. He couldn’t look away, his eyes drinking in Dean as if he couldn’t get enough.
“You said my scent helped you relax so I thought…”
He stopped the tape then. Tomorrow was soon enough for the other side.
Now there were words he could relate to. But this was supposed to be about Cas. So he made himself search for the words.
“I’m glad you asked. Proof they’re robbing Cas. He said they’ve been taking part of his pay as reimbursement for student loans, but according to what I’ve found, even at predatory interest rates, he paid them off like 3 years ago. Also, I got into his computer remotely, and recovered copies of the documents they gave him, with the altered dates.”
“That could be motive. But we don’t know that he is one of them.”
“Have you figured out love yet? Cause I could use some pointers. I keep making lame jokes that anyone else would have dumped me for before our first kiss.”
“As you can imagine, as soon as the crowd cleared out, we had people in here. None of our alarms had detected smoke or indeed any signs of a fire, so we were pretty confident it was a false alarm, but we still had to check it out.”
But Cas was already out the passenger door, and in another moment, getting into the back seat and shoving the bags of treats into the front again.
Dean nodded, though none of it made much sense at all.
“Excuse me?”
Unable to keep the snark out of her voice, the nurse informed him that he’d been sedated to stop him from moving. Castiel closed the passenger door carefully, walked around to the driver’s side and got in the car.
“What did you do?”
“Well, I can’t do anything about Dean being a dick, but I’ve been there and there is one thing that makes everything better. Rainbow jello shots. How’s that sound?”
He dropped the gentlest of kisses on Castiel’s lips. Their last kiss. It should be sweet enough for Dean to remember the rest of his life, but small and forgettable enough not to weigh Cas down any longer than it had to. He hoped he got it right as he dropped his eyes to his shoes. He couldn’t bear to look into those eyes while he broke the heart he could see so clearly right through them. Wide open to him, and full of trust.
His mind helpfully supplied all kinds of things he definitely shouldn’t do –
“Let me think a minute,” and after a moment “We need some information. What do we know about them?”
He finally noticed what he was eating. He didn’t know what it was called, but it looked like a real homemade meal, with vegetables and everything. Seemed he’d already started.
Most days he rushed right through the area, but today he felt his steps slow of their own volition, and before he was even aware that he was doing it, he was turning his head this way and that, looking for it. Something sounded funny. He followed the sound to a bus that was loading. The sign by the door said it was headed to Cleveland. Leaving in 10 minutes, if it was on schedule.
“Sammy’s great. He’s off at Standford. Nerd got in a year early.”
“Your favorite?”
Turned out he didn’t even need a list. He started walking in the direction the man pointed in. Less than a block away there was a shop. Singer Auto. An about to slide under a sweet, sweet old T-bird, was the greenest pair of eyes he’d ever been lucky enough to see twice.
They arrived at the top and then Cas was on screen again, and he finally spoke.
He handed Cas a small box, which turned out to have the CDs, and pointed to the player in the corner. Then he explained they were loading the songs in the mp3 player, so Cas could take them with him anywhere.
“Well, if you won’t tell me,” Cas whispers as he reaches the other end of the trail and nips gently at Dean’s earlobe, “I’m just going to have to investigate.”
“That’s him.”
“I wanted nothing more than to just fix it, somehow. Find the magic word that would bring us back to the way things were before – before everything went wrong.”
She referred to her notes then, told them everything else Cas had told her. By the time she was done, everyone had abandoned their pancakes. For a moment, nobody seemed to know what to say. Then Benny shoved aside his plate, and bluntly pulled them all out of their funk.
He watched the officers arrest the man and load him up into the back of a cruiser. Another cruiser, with the boy’s mother, would be meeting them by the front door soon. He went back to the food court, where he found Dean and Dennis sitting at a table eating ice cream.
“New rules like what?”
“Don’t hide from me, Cas.”
“So I was thinking…”
He had to admit, this was not the reaction he had expected from Dean. Was he even still paying attention? Cas turned his head to see what Dean was looking at. As far as he could tell, just a few people outside a sporting goods store.
“You’re a good man, Dean. You taught me everything I know about being a man. But you didn’t have anyone to teach you. And I think you never really learned some of the things you taught me.”
Charlie cued up a 911 call.
“I was coerced. Threatened.”
. He was never supposed to see him again. He couldn’t - Why was he here?
Dean scooted closer to his laptop and pulled up YouTube. He looked for that ridiculous name and found it immediately. Apparently it was pretty popular. Enough to be a verified account. Dean followed on to the channel. He had almost a quarter of a million followers. Well over 200,000. There were hundreds of videos. Dozens of playlists. Dean scrolled, baffled by the enormity of what he was uncovering. Wonders of the World. Southern Europe. South America. City Christmas. Country Christmas. National Parks.
“You can talk about food poisoning without me, right? Let’s work the angle you need me for.”
“That’s why I’m here,” Cas confirmed. “I need more music in my life.”
Well before Cas walked into the garage, the smell of something delicious flooded the room and got everyone’s attention. Which is why when he came through the door, everyone was staring, slack jawed, in his direction. Also why they ignored his face, his guitar, and in fact everything else to focus entirely on the basket in his hands.
The next track should need very little in the way of elaboration, so Cas strolled to the kitchen in search of a drink. Dean looked at the tape cover and smiled. It listed “When the going gets though,” the only annotation being “karaoke night”. That was enough. There had really only ever been one, and Dean remembered it clearly, though he had pretended to be too drunk to recall it.
Yeah, so this was a new thing that was happening since Cas came back. It’s like he hung out with the kids from the wrong side of town and picked up an attitude and a whole new vocabulary somehow. Dean was not too fond of surprises, and Cas had been a constant in his life long enough that he didn’t appreciate this kind of change.
“Ah,” Cas knew the suit he meant now. It was one of his best, perfectly tailored, and it suited his skin tone. With the right tie, it really made his eyes pop too. He nodded, the puzzlement in his expression asking the question for him.
“It’s more complicated than that,” but he wanted to try to explain it anyway, or at least part of it, so we added, “It’s not about them so much, really. Sure, if I see someone in trouble or about to do something stupid and I can stop them, I will help, because people are worth saving. But also, because that is who I am. Whatever else I am or have been, I
He watched Cas eat another slice, and then his feet were moving closer. Maybe it was because they were at this weird intersection of “I’ve loved you forever” and “This is so new” but these small things drew him to Cas like a bee to a flower. He made himself sit down, though, because he’d like to think he wasn’t the kind of guy who turned a snack into a make out session. At least, not every damn time. He could be that kind of guy, right? His eyes followed Castiel’s fingers to his mouth again. A quick glance showed him Cas was watching.
He settled into the same spot he’d been sitting in, glancing at Dean with the kind of smile he’d only ever seen in chick flicks before. Cas produced a knife and efficiently cut the apple into wedges, removing the core as he went.
“Shut up, it was great. I danced! Cher is fun, even if she’s wrong about kisses, and I found a song that sounds like flying.”
Some cheerleaders had turned up dead, of apparent suicide. All in the same school. Small town, middle of nowhere. They’d been between major hunts and passing through, or close enough, and decided to stop and handle it. Cas had just started riding with them more on smaller hunts and between hunts, pretty much, on a regular basis. It took some doing but they finally figured out that what the girls all had in common was a sleepover.
Cas gave a shy smile, nibbled at his lip, then shook his head.
“Smell that? That’s blissed out, happy omega.”
He was confused, is all. She was there, he could smell her perfume, and hear her voice, and her hand on his arm. And actually, now that Dean thought about it, her eyes were blue too. When had blue eyes become so common? Seemed like everyone had blue eyes all of a sudden. Anyway, he clearly was thinking about Nurse Kelly when he was looking at Frank, that’s why that music was playing and why he looked kinda dazed.
Dean shrugged. It was safe there. But it wasn’t home. And sometime between being dropped off in Eden and waking up in the hospital room, Dean had found himself falling, and falling hard, for the Cas he was discovering. He wouldn’t pass up an opportunity to get to know him better for all the bacon cheeseburgers this side of the Mississippi. And this time he wasn’t going to fuck it up with his second guessing and overthinking.
“Kelly, Pam! Party at my place tonight. 8 o’clock. You in?”
When he looked up again, they were in the bathroom. Cas was slipping out and setting him down on the cold granite counter. He turned on the shower and made quick work of removing the clothes they were still wearing. When he looked up at Dean again, his head was adorably tilted, and Dean couldn’t help tilting his own in response.
“You’re in denial. Face it, Dean. Dr. Sexy is hot for Nurse Frank. He wants the D.”
“The closest I had to a relationship was Lisa, and if I’m honest the only reason I did that was because Sammy made me promise and I thought he was gone. Like, gone gone. Forever, gone. I think I kinda loved her, but it was never going to work, and maybe that’s why I tried. She was a picket fence kinda person and she had the kid, and I’m-”
“Is this the man?”
“Dean!” Cas finally broke through.
“Yeah, well, what do you know about Dr. Sexy? Or dick?”
Dean’s eyes closed tight, and he made himself breathe normally.
“It seems that we underestimated how… attached you had become to your new home,” Naomi surrendered. “Since you seem to be so eager to return, why don’t you go ahead back. We’ll let you and your… friend get reacquainted, as you said. And maybe we can speak again after you’ve settled in."
