"Yeah, and? What’s it to you Meg?" Ruby says, straightening as Meg talks to her. Castiel bites his lip, trying not to laugh, anyone on these streets should know now to try to pick a fight Meg. She'll always win and she usually fights dirty.
“This is a lot of food for one dude Cas.” He says, taking one of the heavier bags.
Dean drives like he hasn't in years. It was so easy in his twenties to cruise for 8 hours. Sometimes more. Only stopping for snacks, he could eat at the wheel and bathroom breaks and gas. Now Dean ends up stopping in diners to give his back a break. Paying out a small fortune to sleep in slightly nicer hotels. The kind with good mattresses so he can get his four hours without agony.
------
Dean smiles. “Yes, yes I did. I’ll call you when I land.”
“Even if it means your life? C’mon man be realistic, this isn’t my first solo hunt. I’ll be fine.”
Dean shrugs, "I don't know man. I lost my shit when you were dating Ruby."
Dean rolls his eyes, hoping the rain hides the flush in his cheeks. "Flattery will get you nowhere."
“Okay,” Castiel says holding the gun warily, he’s used to a more compact weapon. “So wait you can shoot a ghost?”
“Why won’t he just come home?” Sam asks.
The man smiles warmly, clearly aware of the effect he has as he prowls through Castiel’s little store. Stopping at the counter, he awards Castiel with a close-up view of his hypnotic green eyes and a flash of straight white teeth. He’s possibly the most attractive person Castiel has ever seen. “Hello Castiel,” he greets, his voice curling into a seductive growl. “My name’s Dean.”
Cas rolls his eyes, jostling Dean like he's being an idiot. "Of course I am. For the first time in eons I am truly happy Dean. Chuck isn't taking that away from me no matter what he does."
“I’m not, don’t worry I have a thick skull.”
From the corner of his eye, Castiel watches as Dean smiles smugly at whatever expression has found its way onto his face. “Cas,” he says proudly. “Meet Baby.”
"Fucking hell," Dean says again, watching Cas's ass in the mirror as he walks back to his bike. It seems coming here wasn't a bad idea after all.
"Yeah, but it wasn't my flexing that got his attention," Meg says smirking. "Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through and take care of yourself."
"Hey, Dean!" Sam says smiling, because yeah, he actually is a morning person. "I thought I heard your voice."
Dean rolls his eyes, “C’ mon you big baby.” he teases. Castiel might be a stoic lawyer but he also a dramatic bastard. “You’re a kickass lawyer with enough power to accidentally compel someone. Of course, you prove it. You just have to believe in yourself first.”
“Okay,” Castiel says biting his nail before writing something down on a legal pad.
"Yeah, I know," Dean sighs, "I'll think about it, man. We should get some sleep and then call Bobby back in the morning. I'll -" Shaking his head Dean closes his eyes, he doesn't want to see Sam's expression when he admits this. "Cas has been screening my calls, but
You may have noticed the chapter count went up. It's because I'm a sucker for a ciff-hanger. Theres two more chapter of this story left and maybe an epilouge. Thank you all for reading to this point were almost there and your kind comments are what have kept me going.
"Those will kill you; you know." A deep voice says from Castiel's right. Castiel jumps and looks over to see none other Dean Winchester. Castiel drops his lighter.
"Because he planned it that way. If he didn't involve himself I'm sure you and Sam would have defeated her eventually." Cas says like he's stating the obvious. He shakes his head. "But that doesn't matter anymore Dean. As much as my father believes otherwise, he isn't the be-all and end-all. You and Sam have always defied fate, I don't see why this should be any different. We can write our own ending Dean."
Dean sighs. “Guess I should get out of your hair, then?” he asks like he thinks he could ever be unwanted here. Like Castiel wants him to go.
Castiel looks away and Dean shakes his head. He doesn't look at Kelly or Jack again. Doesn't even try to puzzle out the expression on Castiels face. He just grabs his coat and leaves.
So Dean never tried to put down roots as a kid. John lived on the road. Dragging his two kids along on an endless road-trip, so he'd never hurt again. John never made any friends and Dean always wanted to be just like his father. Besides, he loved the open road. He loved going somewhere new, even if Sam bitched about missing his teachers or his friends. He didn’t do the detachment thing, not like Dean and John did, but maybe that was for the best. Of the two of them, Sam handled John’s death a lot better than Dean did. Dean resented John for dying. He hated him for leaving Dean with a busted-up car and a godfather determined raise then under one roof. Dean wasn't built for a steady home or people getting in his way. He was made to be alone—or so he thought.
“Contracts can be complicated. The angel who wrote this deal clearly didn't understand that.” Castiel groans his hands migrating to run through his hair. For once ruffling his slick appearance. He sounds more annoyed than when he tells Dean off for bringing him the wrong sandwich. “You have to understand Dean it takes years to learn how to write a contract correctly. Not that any person making a soul deal cares about that. Often a deal fails because the writer doesn't know actually makes them successful.”
Sam shakes his head, “Nothing. Just glad you two are getting along, is all. Are you ready to go?”
"She's in the pool-room," Zeke says with a scowl, which means Meg is definitely here and being her usual self.
Inside his room Deans lets his mask slip because if he didn't wear it, Sam would see right through him. The same way Dean can see how '
"Why? Is it working?" The guy asks, raising an eyebrow and
“It's complicated.”
Dean seizes the opportunity. "Tell you what," He says, fondling Castiel’s balls. "You make me cum before you do, I’ll tell you my name. But if I make you come first you defect."
Sam goes to say something else, but is interrupted by the fire roaring to life in a burst of green flames. Instinctively, Dean jumps back, pulling Eileen and Sam back with him as a shadow falls from the chimney. From the flames, a man rises. Absentmindedly, he beats ash of his dark tweed suit, brushing lightly over his gold cloak, then looks up. Dean's breath catches as bright blue eyes shine from under a messy mop of dark hair. The green light reflects elegantly off his jaw before it recedes. Leaving the beautiful man, smiling softly as he adjusts the cuffs of his jacket.
“Bye Charlie,” Dean says, hanging up. He turns to Sam and sticks out an accusing finger. “You're early.”
“Claire I'm freaking out because I care about you. Demon deals can be tricky and you’re just a kid.”
“Isn't he that dreamy lawyer from Chicago?” Charlie says, her tone doing a whole 180.
“I slept pretty well last night.”
"Okay," Dean says, trying not to blush at Cas's words. He shakes his head instead, biting back a yawn.
Looking up at the sky, Dean takes a deep breath and lets the rain wash over his face. He's grateful Rowena managed to find a spell for his glasses so they don't get splattered with rain. It will make flying in a storm like this a lot easier. Dean takes a deep breath, listening to the thunder echoing in the air.
Cas blinks, his wings dropping to his side. "You love me?"
He can't deny it. Cas has a nice dick and Dean wants to keep enjoying it. Which is definitely something he didn't plan on. Biting his lip Dean looks down at the phone screen, squinting at Cas's profile picture. Dark hair; eyes so blue Dean thought he photoshopped them at first and a jaw to cut glass. Cas has it all. Dean thought so the second he saw that photo. He just wasn't expecting the butterflies in his stomach that came after meeting the guy in person.
"First we're going to go to a diner," Cas says, biting his lip. "I'm sure Sam hasn't eaten in a few hours and all we have here if stale bread. None of us can think about this on an empty stomach."
around Deans neck.
Daphne’s eyes start to water, the truth she’s already suspected finally confirmed. Despite the lack of skin on skin contact, he still sees the after-image of her. The fading spectre of her soul, revealing her pain, her desire for revenge. Any other day, he’d probably pick at that scab on her soul. Needle at that her need for revenge and that brief burst of attraction, just to spend hours lost in her body, trying to make both of them feel better. It wouldn’t be the first time he's slept with client, and Daphne’s certainly beautiful, in that elegant way that reminds him of his old life. Exhaustion makes him pause though, he still feels the lingering fatigue in his bones. The kind that makes him think this trance hasn't fully finished yet. He’d never force a lover to see him like that, virtual stranger or not.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You - You pretend to be the FBI?”
"Hey all," Castiel's neighbour says to the crowd. His voice is almost as deep as Castiel’s. "My names Dean Winchester and we are Impala."
Rage rushes through Dean his grace flaring white-hot and Sam immediately jumps. "You alright there, Dean?" He asks, ignoring Rowena as she casts a reversal spell over Bela.
“How the hell am I supposed to believe that?” Castiel says lifting an eyebrow.
The guy blinks up at him, looking slightly affronted at being addressed. “Err... I really don’t… I mean... I swear it wasn’t a sex thing!” He answers hurriedly, cheeks blazing.
“It almost killed me. I’m not letting it get away with that.”
"Yes, I know, of my feelings..."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Castiel says rubbing at his throat. “Jody adopted Claire after a home invasion went wrong. Claire's parents were killed. I think she wants to keep Claire away from as much violence as possible.”
Dean ducks his head, avoiding Cas's gaze. "What? Can't I do something nice."
"We should
“No, I suppose you don't, not about the meeting anyway.” He says, picking up his papers. “I'm going to take these files to my office. Once you've walked Cerberus, we’ll go meet Kelly for lunch.”
“You heard me just fine.”
"So, could have you," Castiel says looking away. "But you didn't, you didn't even give me a real chance Dean."
"You think he left on his own?" Dean asks. It's not in Cas's character to just up and go, but Dean has a hard time imagining someone capable of capturing him. Cas is old. Older than Dean by a couple of centuries. His magic has only grown with his age. It would take someone pretty powerful to knock him out.
Dean laughs, “Nope, I mean Bobby's mortal, but he makes up for that by being the surliest bastard alive.”
"Yes, I did,” Naomi says primly. “With miss Kline’s current financial situation, it would be impossible for us to accept Jack. Even with our scholarships. I fear many of the specialised schools will have trouble accepting him for the same reason. That is if his current living situation doesn’t change.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. It's easy sometimes to think Cas is painfully awkward. That he's naive and vulnerable, hell even Dean falls for the act sometimes. But as he stands down facing Amara, with nothing but his glare. Dean understands that Cas, even painfully human, is the angel that took on hell and won. He won't back down in front of her and Dean knows he won't quit either. Sam clenches his jaw, rolls his shoulders back, looking at Dean like it’s the last time. Dean supposes there could be worse things in life than dying with these two at his side.
“Other creatures?”
Benny's place is good for meetings because it always feels relaxed. It’s probably a charm to make people leave their issues at the door. Like those fancy coffee shops on Overland. But it’s cheaper and Benny cooks like a God so it's way better in Deans opinion.
"Christmas Movie Marathon," Dean says, smiling brightly.
Dean groans, kissing Cas
"Who's Becky Rosen?"
"This,” Cas says, then kisses him softly.
When she wakes up, Deans going to tell her how she's saved that Jacks life.
“You sure you need that, Charles?” Dean asks, keeping his distance for fear of being shocked. “You seem fully charged to me?”
Dean gets to his feet. Blinking at Cas and knows he’s impossible. “Cas are you God?”
"Sam -" Eileen says, watching as black smokes blocks out the widows. Around them the cabin shakes, pictures falling off the walls and pans rattling in the kitchen. The kitten's screech, darting into the bedroom and under the bed. Pulling away from the hug Sam reaches for his hip, pulling out his gun and aiming it at the doorway. Cas reaches under the couch, pulling out his angel blade and standing in front of Dean. Dean's stomach turns as the smell of dead roses fills the air.
"You want me to drive this thing?" Cas asks looking down at the car with a genuine light in his eyes. It shouldn't be as adorable as it is.
“That's disgustingly sweet.”
Dean shrugs finally freeing the first of many, many knots from the lights. "Sorry man they just aren't my thing."
In any other situation, Castiel would condemn him. If Dean was just a man living in his town Castiel would throw him in jail without thinking twice because that's how the law works. But Dean is outside of Castiel laws, he’s a hunter who kills monsters for fuck's sake. Who is Castiel to judge him for just doing his job, for protecting his family from the awful out there when up until tonight he didn't know those awful things existed. A million thoughts run through his head, there’s so much he could say here, condemning words, congratulatory phrases. He uses none of them. “I’m glad Sams doing okay now.”
“Yeah” Dean sighs, “Except y’ know it didn't work. The guys still alive.”
For fifteen years that car has been Dean’s home. He drove Sam to college in the thing, the two of them sleeping on the bench seats as Dean promised he wouldn’t turn into their father. He's picked up hitchhikers, taken dates into the back seats, and slept in her more times than he can count. His car is his connection to the world and it's how he reaches out to those closest to him.
"I guess not," Castiel says smugly.
"Can you picture Cas on vacation?" Sam snorts, shaking his head.
"Of course, dad made the deal," Dean scoffs, unable to hide his bitterness. "He had practically forgotten about us at that point. I was already stealing shit to keep Sam fed so I guess he figured we wouldn't notice if he was sent to the cage. Maybe he thought mom being back would fix our problems too, I don't know."
"What suspicions?" They all ask in unison.
Sam laughs, “Oh, he's legit alright.”
Dean almost groans. In all his worry about losing Claire, he forgot how official The Severing can be. Because all things that fall under Angelic law are super pretentious. Meaning an actual Archangel needs to sign off on it. Unlike Gabriel - the Archangel of spells - Raphael is a stickler for formality. And is a goddamn stickler for formalities and customs. Meaning that while Virgil may not actually be Raphael. But he is still here to make this process worthy of Raphael's oh so demanding standards. Sometimes Dean hates angelic superiority.
Castiel perks up, a genuine smile breaking his face. "Are you saying you will keep doing this until you win."
"Its mutual by the way," Dean says stupidly shy, considering he's wrapped around Cas like a koala. Cas blinks in surprise then he kisses Dean again.
“What kind of work?” Dean asks narrowing his eyes. The term work could mean a lot of things, especially in contract law.
Dean swallows, hearing a ringing in his ears. A phantom metallic taste lingers in the back of his tongue like fresh blood and dead roses. "You don't think?"
"Lydia..." Dean starts, unsure of what he even wants to say. She’s not actually wrong about that. What can he say, he's been busy lately. Well, more busy than usual. He thought that Lydia, being a businesswoman herself, would understand the job. He thought she’d be more lenient about his long hours and business trips than his other exes. But it seems that was just wishful thinking on his part.
Dean scoffs, “Seriously, I’ll wipe it clean and it will be good as new, stop fussing.”
"Is not."
"Excuse me?" Naomi asks, the white glow of her halo shining.
Dean wakes up to an empty bed that smells like sex and stale saffron. Castiel is nowhere to be seen. Groaning Dean lifts his pounding head and grabs his glasses off the nightstand. It's a Sunday, so Castiel should be here. Yet when Dean pulls on his boxers and wanders downstairs, he's nowhere to be seen. Dean refuses to get upset, not yet anyway. He's had fun sex before and had his date leave in the morning without a word. He shouldn't be this hurt just because it's Castiel that's walked out.
“How the fuck did you find out about that?!” Dean yells his voice shaking.
He smiles, big and wide, and sticks his hand out. “I’m Garth, Eileen's cousin. You must be Sam's brother Dean, right?”
“I know. You don't want to imagine the things I’ve arrested people for.” Cas sighs like he's shaking off the bad memories. “Thankfully I’m not working tomorrow night.”
Castiel rolls his eyes and settles against Dean's side. "Shhh, Dean. It's my favourite."
Clearing his throat Dean looks back at the pen and turns it on himself. Scratching the silvertip over his skin and staining it with blood and golden grace. Castiel sighs, pretending to be disappointed. The Jackass.
Dean had barely walked into Sam’s little New York apartment before she pounced, asking him who he was texting and quizzing him on all these details about Cas’s life, all while drinking him under the table. Only to ask him for more details while Dean was nursing the mother of all hangovers. Sam, the bastard, had only looked fond and told Dean that he wants him to be happy, because somehow Sam, of all people, still believes in Disney movies. Dean kinda hates them both, but they are known to give some good advice occasionally.
Doug shrugs, looking uncomfortably at his prisoner. “Grave desecration.”
Dean shakes his head. “Thousands of years at witchcraft - and wizards still don’t trust pens.”
"Yeah, but it's not like I win the lottery for absent fathers."
“Why because you fell?” Castiel questions, his tail sharpening into a terrifying point.
"Why did you invite me here?" Castiel asks once Dean's back is turned. Dean spins banging his knee of an open drawer.
Dean licks his lips, suddenly itching to grab the notebook out of Cas's hand. "Cas?" He says slowly, "Does that notebook have a drawing of your true form in it?"
by the end of the week so keep your eye on that if your currently reading and if your not but like my writing and are interested in prophet Cas I'd recommend you check it out.
"You were?" Dean asks his voice going up an octave. "So you've like been to earth before."
"Thank you, Dean," Claire says, her smile blinding. Dean decides right there and then that no matter what happened between him and Cas. This moment right here is worth it.
Sam rolls his eyes. “C’mon,” he says, lifting his giant legs over the wall. Dean sighs, following Sam as he navigates the small village with ease.
"Gross Gabe," Sam says scrunching up his nose. Gabriel winks, pouring sugar into his cup.
Dean scrambles. He tries to fall back into his car, hoping like hell he can just get inside and drive away from the thing but it's no use. Between one breath and the next, the creature has appeared in the field directly beside Dean. Its body towering over him, a humming noise fills the air, almost like a whale song. Dean damn near pisses himself. Slowly the alien reaches out with one of its long fingers and pokes him in the centre of his head.
“She’s speaking to you again?”
With an annoyed sigh filled with false embarrassment, Claire tucks into her pie. Taking a bite before she starts fidgeting, twirling her straw until the cream melts. “So, I did something stupid.”
“We argued about why I hated demons and the stupid chores he wanted me to do. Then he asked me to testify on this archangel case he's working on. When I said no, things just kind of exploded.”
“No Dean. I'm keeping it and I'm holding up my end of the bargain.”
“I take it this is the one?” Castiel asks.
Castiel smiles ruefully. “You make me a terrible lawyer.”
Dean taps his fingers against the chair, stomach-churning at Castiel’s smug smile. “Wait,” he says softly, he knows a threat when he hears one. “I’ll do it.”
"What was that?" Castiel asks, still looking at Dean’s mouth. If Castiel wasn't wearing heels, Dean would probably be a little taller than him. He looks a bit older too, if the lines around his eyes are anything to go by. Fuck he's handsome.
Cas moans against his mouth, his lips hot and slick and holy shit Dean is losing his mind. He runs his fingers through Cas's hair, gripping it tightly as Cas's hands slide down his waist. Then down to his ass, Dean groans pulling away a little to kiss down Cas's throat. Cas makes a humming noise grappling at Deans thighs until Dean hoists his legs up. Wrapping them around Cas's thick waist. Dean nearly comes on the spot. He kisses Cas again, greedy and desperate until he needs air.
"Doctor in your preparation for this case. Did you notice that only one parent - my client Nicolas Lightbringer – has the means to send Jack to your school?"
Dean sighs and emerges from his nest. Hitting the thick curtains of his bed away and pushing his hand into the light. He doesn’t quite open his eyes to the glare of the sun. It couldn't hurt him anymore, but old habits die hard. Fumbling blind, he grabs his phone and swipes the screen. "This better be good," He says, his voice too thick with sleep to sound like a real threat.
"I can handle myself," Bela snaps, pulling her hand back from her mouth. Her nails bitten down to stubs.
Dean sighs, giving the kitten one more indulgent pet. “We better get into town before the rain starts.”
Ruby huffs her heels clicking on the pavement. "Yeah, whatever you’re such a bitch Meg." She yells over her shoulder.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “What did you two go toe to toe over the coffee supply?”
Castiel blinks, squinting at Dean through the sun, "Dean-" he begins but Dean cuts him off by walking away.
When he looks back, Dean's staring at his bookshelf with mild interest. He points at a picture frame. “Is this you?” he asks, stunned. Not that Castiel can blame him. The photos from years ago, back when Castiel was an angry teen with dyed black hair and darker clothes. Mildred's arms wrapped casually around him at some fair. Castiel flushes and grabs the whiskey from the kitchen. “Unfortunately, yes.”
Dean laughs so hard he snorts as Castiel 's puppy eyes get wider. “No one ever believes me till she does that.”
Castiel shrugs, shoving eggs in his face.“I'm prepping for an angelic custody case on behalf of the mother. It's going to court, which is ridiculous because Jacks father suddenly remembered he has a son. Of course, it was only after Jack started to exhibit traits typical to an archangel.” Castiel says bitterly, this father sounds like a piece of work.
"It's the black one," Crowley says as Dean walks towards the gleaming behemoth parked at the end of the row. God, his Dad would love this thing. He strokes his hand along the sleek lines and perfect bodywork and aches to put his past to work and pop the hood.  He hasn't felt that urge in years, but this car is something else. Dean lets out an appreciative whistle.
Shaking his head Castiel pats her back softly, “You know I’d do anything for him, Kline.” He whispers into her hair, barely loud enough for Dean to hear.
“Ummm - yeah. Seeing as that’s my job.”
Applying to college had been a dumb idea, to begin with. Castiel barely finished high school for crying out loud. At the time it didn't matter. Not when his dad had Castiel’s whole life all mapped out. Now, though at twenty-six, he's one step above homeless and selling himself on the streets. His father would be so proud.
Castiel glares at him. “I'm getting the first aid kit,” he says, marching for the door.
"Yes, what?" Cas asks, his forehead creasing. Dean kisses it softly, feeling the lines smooth under his touch.
"That’s not my point,” Dean licks his lips, watching as Cas's gaze lingers and fights a smile. Now is not the time. Not when Deans trying to get Cas to stop being dumb and believe in himself. “What I’m trying to say is if you can’t find something in the books. Chances are no one’s come up with an idea yet. Whatever idea you have its probably the best chance we've got.”
Dean rolls his eyes, “Yeah, whatever Sam.” He says ending the call before jumping out of the cab to help Cas with the groceries.
Dean really hates how smart this girl is. “Ugh, you’re not helping.”
"This isn't a break, you gave me twenty dollars," Castiel says smirking again.
' his little brother is while when wearing bruises under his eyes. They make a strange pair, the world's famous Winchester brothers. Whose insides are only held together by duct tape, whiskey, and spite these days. Dean hopes teaching will help Sam realize everything not helpless. Those hunters that died during Michael’s raid had left him raw and wrung out for days. But Dean remembers what he was like before. Strong, confident. A real leader in a room where everyone saw that spark, Dean saw in him his whole life. Dean wants his brother to have that again. He deserves to have it again.
Claire looks up at him. Hope guarded behind her eyes. "Yeah, it did," Dean says reaching into his pocket. "I've got your potion right here."
“Yes. At Sam’s request, I plan on brewing a hangover cure for everyone tomorrow. Specifically him, as he also has to put up with my brother who will insist on buying Sam every drink imaginable.”
Inside the small reception area a small fire blazes, making the wood-paneled room feel homely and inviting. Just like the streets, the hotel is decorated for Christmas. Two pine trees are glittering in each corner, one red and silver; the other gold and green. An older woman sits at the counter, in front of a wall of keys. She smiles when she sees Sam. “Made it there and back in one piece, I see.”
Castiel rolls his eyes like it's such a tremendous task to help Dean out. "Cerberus, get over here." Castiel orders and even as pissed as he is Dean has to smother arousal at that tone. With a huff, the dog steps off Dean, hitting every vital organ he has and narrowly missing his balls. It then sulks back to Castiel, tail low.
Cas pulls back with a soft chuckle as Dean flushes.
"Yeah, you got that right." Dean scratches the back of his neck. "I think I need to see this exhibit, so we can figure out what's up with him."
“What is it?”
"We need to talk," Castiel says, panting after running to catch up with Dean. His eyes slowly tracing over Deans wings. "I didn't realise they were so -"
"Yes right, work." Cas sighs, sitting at the table and picking up the nearest stack of papers. Clearly not reading a single word.
"Look Krushnic, just cause I'm some all-American pie loving boy. It doesn't mean I won't bring out the pliers and pull your nails out," Dean says, slamming Castiel’s head back against the metal again. "Life can be made a lot easier for you if you just give up right now."
Castiel remains silent, watching the road. "No. I - I don't know," He says suddenly like it was torn from him. His fingers drum against the wheel. "I have no clue what I'm doing Dean. I've never made a work-trade deal before. I didn't realise a compulsion could come on as easily as that and I was too emotional to stop it."
“I figured you would want something to take your mind off everything,” Sam says, sounding annoyingly understating, he's probably been planning this call all day.
"My brother thinks because he created the universes, they all belong to him, but I know better now. You aren't his playthings or his entertainment. You are all -"
Castiel nods grabbing the salt and throwing it over the coffin lid. Dean shoots again but before he can get off another shot he's thrown backwards. “DEAN!” Castiel yells as the ghost advances on Dean sprawled against the opposite gravestone, empty-handed.
on Earth is done. He needs to know if his heart is going to break.
The drive after that is astonishingly silent. Cas radiates a dark cloud of depression and judgement from the back seat, shrivelling up whatever hope Dean has in him. When they hit Missouri, the rain starts, creating a heavy sheet to match Cas’s mood and Dean's tired eyes are squinting to see anything.
Seeing Cas suddenly seem self conscious makes Dean grab his waist pull him closer. "So?"
Dean leans back in his chair glaring at the trio. “Why do you all care about this anyway?”
“That still doesn’t explain why you need me.”
"Cas it's no secret that I don’t like your plans, right? But I don’t think Chuck liked them either,” Dean says, smiling at Cas softly. He always hated it when Cas lost hope. "After you left, I started to try and reason with my brain. I tried to think of moments where it was obvious you wouldn't betray me. And I was thinking about the apocalypse and why Chuck didn't just end everything then. But then I realised he probably would have if you didn't surprise him."
"I am talking about the roof," He says defensively.
"We got over it." Sam sighs, pushing his hair back from his face. "Chuck's decided he's done with us now and every time I think about the things he did. The things he did to us or made us do to each other. It makes me sick Dean. Having you around knowing that Chuck did those things to you as well, it helps sometimes but Cas -"
Dean sighs, making a deal could get him fired so no one in the office knows about it. Except for Charlie who apparently knows everything about him. Even the worst things in his life. “How did you find out about the deal?”
"Really?"
Faintly he hears Jody say, “-puty? Deputy Collins?”
eases when he falls onto his bed. He falls asleep looking at his phone.
Then Benny had come along.
"That was different Cas you we're trying to save the world."
Dean looks at both of them, “Is this about Bela.”
Dean lifts an eyebrow, both at the pronoun Cas used, and the fact that Cas’s ex was a common mortal. It means nothing, of course - Dean has no intention of trying to get into Cas’s pants. No matter how gorgeous Cas is. He’s got a plan, and he’s sticking to it. So instead of asking about his ex or pursuing anything flirty like he wants to, Dean asks, “What about you? What're your plans?”
Dean scoffs, "A child's comfort is everything. Especially for an archangel Fledgling like Jack." He says. His voice shaking with rage at Nick and Crowley not understanding that. "The Archangel Gabriel taught me that. He's also decided to personally see to Jacks mentorship as long as Kelly has custody. Because he believes that Jacks education shouldn’t be put above his mental wellbeing."
Dean sits up straight, he's been waiting for her to say something since her cryptic comment in the office. “Stupid like that time you accidentally dyed your hair green. Or stupid like that time you thought you could control being a vessel and almost killed yourself.”
Cas frowns for a second, thinking for a second. "I'm not entirely sure now that I'm contained in this vessel. I think a boat might be too large, but if it was compact and just as heavy that might be my upper limit."
Dean forgets sometimes that Cas is Sam’s friends too. “I- “
"An hour."
He's adorably flustered and for once Castiel wishes the situations were different. That Dean was just a hot guy he could ask on a date, but that’s not how it is. He sighs. "Well, you know, you could pay me. That's one way to break the ice."
Deans a great performer he tips the mic just right, bounces and dances when he can, and he sings like a rock god. His band works well together as well. Dean seems to half dance; half compete with the long-haired guitarist when playing the bass. Nodding or dancing beside the redhead on the keyboard and stamping his feet with the girl playing the drums. Castiel ends up taking one of his two allotted shots of tequila. Meg whooping in the corner. Forcing himself to look away, from the gorgeous sight, Castiel serves the thirsty and sweaty crowd their IPA beer. He's swimming in drink orders in no time, but he keeps his ears tuned to the band.
Since meeting Sarah in his freshman year, Sam wants everyone to find love. He can be more invested in Dean's love life than Dean sometimes. Its why he's put off coming out to him for so long. Until now Dean just seen the guys he meets as hook-ups, Sam had no reason to get involved. But now Deans actually interested in a dude, and if he wants to bring Cas around to place, Sam should probably know that Dean’s not as straight as he pretends to be.
Castiel waves his hands in the air. For once at a loss for words. “This morning was the worst thing I’ve ever done. I wasn't thinking clearly. It's not an excuse but Kelly phoned me in tears. Crowley had set a court date and I acted irrationally, selfishly and I manipulated you.”
Sam rolls his eyes and grabs the suit bag off the door. “The only way you’d ruin my wedding is if you lost my ring or sleep with one of the bridesmaids.”
"Or I could go with you to Bobby's, give Cas his space." He says heading straight for the coffee machine.
Charlie sips her coffee, considering him. “Fine, there's this kid, and she's in police custody. Terrible home life which y' know lead to some murderous intentions. The usual."
Doug huffs something like a laugh, adjusting his grip on his prisoner’s arm. “Naw, just a weird one?”
"Cas babe, this movie is in black and white." Dean groans, rubbing his hands down Castiel’s back.
“Yes,” Castiel says, smirking as he fixes his tie. “I also need you to take out the trash and clean the rooms of all the clutter. You will walk, feed and clean up after Cerberus and make my evening meal.”
"I wound up in Phoenix the first time I tried, but I got here eventually." Cas shrugs, his feathers shifting along Deans spine. He looks up at the sky with a wistful expression. "I missed it out here."
After all, it's not everyday that people wake up from a freak accident with psychic powers, or so Missouri claims, anyway. He's just thankful to her for trying to help him in the first place, for teaching him everything she knows. How to use his gift to help people, as well as warning him about the types of creatures that would use him for it. A part of him aches to call her now. To explain the fear he feels at seeing a beast in his home, even if it's just on canvas. He promised her that he would try to take care of himself for once, though. She can’t baby him, not anymore.
Castiel looks up, surprised by the empathy in Dean's voice. “What do you mean?”
"Are you defending me? You of all people?" Dean yells throwing down his brush down and turning to face the forest. He can't concentrate on roof repair right now. Cas sighs doing the same thing. "Why?"
Dean shakes his head, pressing a kiss to Cas's palm. "Or you’re just a bad cook."
Dean flips him the bird, trying to ignore the way his stomach drops when Cas laughs. Dean's gonna miss him so much he already aches with it. He sighs, “We better get back and put this stuff away.”
Expecting death Dean looks over the beast's shoulder. Castiel stands in the doorway, his shirt is partially undone, a blue tie loose around his neck. He's grinning from ear to ear. Dean should have known this demon had some sort of diabolical plan for him. But really, being ripped apart by a hellhound is a bit brutal. He could have just shot Dean or something if he wanted him dead.
“Yeah, well, while I will miss little Optimism around here, I can't say I’ll miss your surly ass.”
Dean sighs, "I know you can, everyone knows you can but that doesn't mean you have to." He says, turning in the chair. "Jody's a good person and she's going to do what's best for you. Whatever that may be."
"прекрасный." Castiel comments, leaning forward so he can mouth along Deans chest. Dean moans louder when Castiel catches a nipple between his teeth.
“Fine don't tell me. Can you at least let me out of here so I can do my job?"
“So why the hell did you order it?”
Castiel nods, "Of course I was there for it."
Sam is a walking talking example of hippy and liberal. With a haircut like his is hard not to be. Hell, since he started interning at that civil rights law firm, he's more liberal than ever. Dean doesn't think Sam will be mad at Dean for liking dick. Deans saw his brother make out with dudes before for fuck's sake. It's not that part that scares him. It's just that he knows Sam will make a big deal out of it.
Dean knew this guy was shady, “This guy gets criminals less jail time?”
"Yeah, I can't think of any other reason why I watched The Mummy so much."
Cas sticks out like a sore thumb among the suits and silks. People are staring at him; which Dean thinks is a little unfair. He knows a lot of celebrities that wear outfits like Cas's, and they definitely stay in places like this. Yet, these guys are looking at him like he's a freak. The part of Dean that grew up poor, rails against it. Crowley has spent a decade trying to iron that part out of Dean. He can't risk Dean offending someone that may be good for business later. Thankfully, it's one of the few of Crowley's lessons that has never stuck. Dean diets, he wears designer suits and rarely drinks, but he never stands for smug pricks. Despite the scrutiny, Dean wraps his arm around Cas's waist and guides him through the crowd.
"Stop avoiding the question, Charles," Dean says walking past page after page. Little information boards placed beside every case. He stops when he gets to the center of the room and sees the exhibit's name.
He feels more like a pirate in some purple banner novel rather than a hooker on the streets. But it’s not a bad look and it’s not like Castiel cares what type of clients he picks up. Maybe tonight he'll seduce a nice cougar instead of his usual fare. Shaking his head at his reflection. He scoffs and grabs Meg's eyeliner and his heeled boots as well. Wondering how he can make a pirate fantasy play out. Does he need to stop by Guy's place and get a net? How would that even work?
Dean white knuckles the steering wheel, rage boiling over his pain. “So, what, you're just gonna go up there and try to fix it. After everything they did to you? After everything we’ve been through?”
Dean shakes his head, pulling away from Cas and getting his shit together. "If I have it my way, we won't lose at all."
"Krushnic," Dean says, sizing him up in return. "I'm here to ask you some questions."
Jack looks up at Castiel, smiling brightly and gap-toothed. His white fledgeling wings ruffling, "Hello uncle Castiel." He says, almost as formal as Castiel.
“Dean Bloom.” The guy says. Castiel writes it down then, asks each of the personal questions like his Age, Date of Birth and Hometown systematically. Dean answers just as quickly, letting Castiel know he's 29, born on the 1st of December and despite his accent, he’s from New York. Castiel raises his eyebrow at one, but figures he can check Dean's I.D. later on. Castiel puts his hands on the table and looks Dean in the eye. “So Dean, why exactly were you digging up a grave?”
“Of course, it is.” Dean sighs, trying not to panic. Claire isn’t his charge anymore and that means letting her make her own mistakes. But couldn't the kid at least have given him some time before giving him a heart attack? “What did you do?”
"Dean-o," He groans, rubbing his face. "You better have a very good reason for waking me up at this time of the morning."
“The bike?”
Dean licks his lips. "Well, yeah. Unless you — ah — want to call me. For, well, anything else, really."
“Okay," Sam says sounding reluctant, he always was a goodie-two-shoes. "What's the demon's name?”
Castiel shakes his head. “You don’t have to,” he says, then considers what would happen if he didn't go in today. Jody would probably come looking for him, especially if she thinks he’s sick — and Castiel can only imagine her rage if she saw him playing hooky with last night’s prisoner. He bites his lip. “At least not right away. Have coffee with me?”
"Because you don't want me that way!" Cas yells like it's been torn from him. Years of pain suddenly clear in his voice. "I know you don't Dean. I know my feelings make you uncomfortable."
“You're not driving the Impala?!” she asks, just as Sam sticks his head in the doorway. Dean puts his finger to his lips. “No - I, ugh, just don’t trust airport parking,” he covers smoothly. As Sam rolls his eyes, Dean glares. It's an incredibly touching reunion.
"Room service," Dean says licking his lips. Castiel closes his eyes trying to resist the temptation of Dean’s mouth.
Still, he can't help but think Crowley's little shindig is a bit premature. Cain Corporations brought in a lot of business, building ships. For years, it was the gem of the South Bay. Now it’s getting more and more defunct by the day. It’s only a matter of time before the place folds, but Adam Cain is reluctant to sell it to anyone. Even investors.
Dean breathes out a laugh, "Dean, if we're doing this, please call me Dean instead of that Mr Smith, crap."
Dean wakes up an hour before his usual alarm and hates everything. Making the deal was bad enough but this is a new kind of torture. Castiel had insisted Dean came to his house early. To start his first day in his service nice and prompt.
“Try me.”
Dean rolls his eyes at the obvious line, stepping out of Cas's personal space. "Hardy-har you've already made your sale Cas. Now come inside."
Jody says nothing about his swift exit but Castiel keeps up the pace anyway. Rushing to grab a dustpan and broom. He spends the whole time dreading the thought of the ghost making another appearance. Looking over his shoulder while rummaging through the maintenance closet then speed walking down the hallway. When he re-enters the cell room Jody is mid-lecture, standing military straight with her hands on her hips. “ - The fine Deputy Novak is going to write you will be used to pay the damages you made to public property and your damn lucky I'm not giving you community service along with it.”
"I assume they are as happy as most teenagers ever are," Naomi says, her feathers bristled.
Castiel has the balls to look offended. “Excuse me?”
"And let me get this straight you. Miss I'm going to end reality for revenge is suddenly on our side. I'm not buying it." Dean says, not caring if it gets him killed. Amaras offer is too good to be true.
Sam gives him a small smile. "I guess we'll have to order something instead. To celebrate and all."
Dean sighs. “Is he fighting to stop them from using it?”
“Yeah, Yeah, I'm the dream,” Dean mutters, face still flushed as he takes off his foggy glasses. He leans over Castiel’s lap to place them on the nightstand. Castiel kissing his neck the whole time.
“I couldn't agree with you more.”
"I've been better," Charlie says her shoulders slumped. "C'mon in, I've got tea inside."
Seeing Castiel smile has become Dean's new mission. He's usually so stone-faced but when Dean presses, he can see the humour behind Castiel’s eyes. The amazing way he beams every time Jack starts up a conversation. How he smiles softly at Dean when he Dean makes a bad joke like he's holding in laughter. Dean’s become addicted to the way his eyes crinkle when he laughs. They're becoming friends and it comes with feelings Dean would rather not dwell on. Deans got a crush on a demon and he has no clue how he's going to deal with it.
"I will," Sam says, sighing down the line. "Look after yourself and Cas too. I don't know what's happening right now but we'll make it through this. We always do."
Dean is a simple man of simple tastes. He likes burgers and pie; he isn't picky about his beer and he likes pretty girls and strong guys.
He tries not to panic. Cas could have gotten called into work. But Dean had his truck. And the Impala is still parked where Dean left her. Cas would have said something if there was a monster in the woods. But it’s possible something grabbed him that he didn't know about. Chuck could have fucking come back and got him for Christ’s sake. Dean forces himself to breathe, refusing to spiral as he pulls out his phone to call the bastard. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a light coming from the basement.
Sam laughs, "It’s sort of funny, man, from what I know of Castiel, he’s just your type. If he wasn't a demon, I probably would have tried to set you guys up years ago."
“No,” Dean says because he knows angels have and probably will always hate demons. “It has nothing to do with anything angelic, it's just bad experiences. I’ll work on it.”
“He's right though, isn't he? You turned down that waitress from Queens?” Sarah asks eagerly, because she is far too invested in his love life. Dean shrugs. He has turned down more people than just the waitress — Sarah and Sam just hadn't been there to see it, so he’s not mentioning it.
Dean swallows and straightens his tie. "Okay," he holds out his hand, "Well would you like to join me for an hour, Cas?"
"Do you fear that this standard of care will not be met if Jack is sent to live with his father?" Castiel asks. Crowley scoffs quietly but doesn't object, glaring daggers into Castiel’s back instead.
“Why weren't they talking to Mildred?”
Dean raises his eyebrow, “That sounds kinda pretentious.”
Castiel rolls his eyes, ignoring Deans concerns. "Of course, I'm sure."
Castiel freezes. “It can come back?”
“Yeah,” Sam sighs rubbing the back of his neck. “Adler’s keeps saying the kids going to find a way to beat the test. He's petitioning for a compulsion to be added to make sure all the memories are completely true. Bela will have re-live everything exactly as it happened. We can't numb her reactions to anything.”
Castiel makes a grunt that could be a greeting, highlighting a section in his book.
Dean groans, his post-orgasm high completely gone. He should have left Cas’s place last month, when he had the chance. He had already forced himself from the warmth of Cas’s bed, going out into the car because waking up to the hand-shaped bruise on Cas’s throat was enough for him to feel sick. But then he remembered the panic in Cas’s eyes when Dean mentioned demons, and figured he owed the guy something, even if it was just a stupid sigil on his welcome mat. He didn't plan on Cas waking up, or him wanting Dean around long enough to have coffee and exchange fucking numbers. He wasn't prepared for him to start texting him all the time, like that was something people did with Dean.
"What did I promise?" Cas asks, sliding his hands down Deans sides. His voice is gritty and deep, in the way Dean has learnt from the phone means he's turned on. Dean really likes that fucking voice.
“Yeah and look where that got me. I prayed to him every fucking day until I was 19 . Then he let me get hit by fucking lightning! And when I was screaming and restrained in that fucking hospital, begging for God to take away this curse -- he did Jack-squat. God is an asshole.”
Dean shrugs avoiding his eyes. He's not sure if he trusts himself to be alone with Castiel after everything that’s happened between them. Castiel meets his gaze and Dean knows that both of them are thinking about last weekend.
Sure he has his phone and he finally caved and downloaded that zoom thing Charlie was bugging him about, but it's not the same as having someone here. Every five minutes, Dean feels like setting the old barns on fire and hitting the road. But he stays, waiting for this goddamn thing to be over so he can be free again.
"Yeah, it was," Dean reluctantly nods and holds out his arm, "Now are you coming or not."
“I know that!” the prisoner snaps, glaring at his shoes.
"Happy Halloween, Owen," he says, then looks up at the girl. "How much shit did Jody give you for that outfit?"
Dean swallows. "I'm friends with the lawyer working on his son's custody case and he asked me for advice to help win the trial. I was there yesterday watching as that guy tried to prove he deserved to raise a kid."
Dean winks. “I just thought we should get acquainted before the pat-down.”
“Good,” Castiel says with a hesitant smile. The padlock falls and Castiel puts out his hand, Dean grips his hand firmly as he stands but doesn't let go. Castiel looks down at their intertwined fingers then at Dean's beautiful eyes, saying nothing. Dean clears his throat and pushes open the gate into the cemetery. Reluctantly Castiel let go and grabs his torch of his tool belt instead, shining it over the headstones. “Which way?”
TW for this Chapter - Mentions of Child abuse, in regards to Belas home life
"Nice to see you too Gabe," Dean says hiding his laughter, "You know it is past 10."
“Sugar should help you come around.” He says, smiling as Elizabeth comes over with their pie and chocolate milkshakes.
Above him, there’s a delighted laugh. “Well, Cas, Looks like you just hit the jackpot,” Dean says, his mud-caked face smiling down at him. With an almost childish glee, Dean grabs the other shovel and carelessly drops down to join Castiel in the hole, splashing mud on his face.
"Yeah, well, that's how I know."
Driving has always soothed something feral in Dean. Calmed the wild vengeful part of him that hungered for blood. It’s always been the time he’s been his most calm. The most centered. Despite all that driving away from Stull is the hardest thing he’s ever had to do.
"It’s fine Cas, people do it like this all the time I'm just used to having a crew with scaffolding." He explains. Cas's shoulders get higher.
Castiel taps his thumb against his file. He was not expecting the prisoner to be this attractive. Forcing himself to ignore it, he turns to Doug and watches as he puts a duffle bag on the counter. It clunks loudly enough for Castiel to raise an eyebrow. “Hello Doug,” he says, trying not to look at the prisoner. “Busy night?”
“Dagon?” Dean says remembering the name from last month’s news. “Wasn’t she that demon who kidnapped kids?”
“Well then maybe you can charm Sheriff Mills into giving you a citation and a stern talking to.”
(See the end of the chapter for
said. His hands wrestling with Deans belt buckle.
“A… A friend said I should do this. She, ugh, she said it’d be fun.” Castiel doesn't call her out for lying. It's obvious, even without his gift, that she is. People like her don't spend $200 dollars on fun unless it's a vacation. Instead, he glares at her through the candle flames, reaching his arms out to circle them, palms side up. “Give me your hands,” he orders, and she follows without question.
Moving his hands to his pockets, Castiel pulls out Dean's wallet and what looks like a ring in a ziplock bag. He pulls it closer, noticing the thick gold band and black seal at the top. A signet ring, then. “Did you take this from the grave?” Castiel asks, figuring robbery makes more sense than the hazing bullshit.
"You told me to go for it!" Dean says, raising an eyebrow.
Dean jumps turning around to see Cas standing by the entryway. He's wearing just his shirt and slacks which basically means he's naked. Dean swallows.
I'm going to add art to this and last weeks chapter soon because I got my photoshop sorted but I didnt want to delay this any longer.
Cas blinks at their joint hand in shock and opens his mouth. Dean shakes his head, silencing him. "I'm tired of us always yelling at each other. I'm tired of keeping secrets and hurting each other. I mean, I let you think you we're a danger instead of just telling you about Gadreel. I let you think I hated you instead of telling you why I was scared of Chucks plans. I can't keep pushing you away when I'm scared Cas. I know that now."
"I want to fix my own place, Dean," Cas says gruffly, even as Dean shakes his head. He won't let Cas near anything until its clear. The guy may be older than dirt but it's terrifying how new he is to all of this human crap. Dean doesn’t know if he still carries any angelic immunity. But he doesn’t want to drag Cas to the nearest hospital when he gets sick.
“So, Bela’s deal failed because killing her fathers is chump change compared to her soul?”
“Or noble,” Castiel says, bumping their shoulders together.
"Dean if this isn't safe, I can get someone else -"
“Keep ordering like that and me and you will get along just fine,” Jo says a smirk on her cheery face as she walks away.
Castiel sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, "We'll take my car." He says, walking to the garage.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Another time," He says, tapping his fingers against the wheel. "If I go in Bobby will try to convince me to stay and I can't right now."
“Dean, he's asking you to come and see him.”
Dean pulls of Castiel’s cock, licking at the latex covered tip for a second as he meets the Soviets eyes. "Not many men willing to suck dick in Russia?"
“Yeah, I mean Bobby's not exactly young anymore  so he's more of a network for other hunters at this point, helps us with research, pretends to be our boss in the FBI that kind of thing.”
"You don't need to Dean." Cas reaches forward and kisses Dean softly. Dean grips him tight, tears welling in his face.
Cas laughs. “Good to know,” he says as Garth starts to take down the ladder and walks further down the hallway, laughing.
Sam kicks him under the table and Dean kicks back, fighting the urge to laugh. Despite Sam being away from school, they always managed to stick close, mostly by using a magic mirror, that John’s only friend, Bobby, gave them for Christmas. But he still missed Sam when he was at school. It’s gotten better since Sam’s been able to apparate but it’s moments like this he misses the most.
"This whole household is filled with nosy jerks," Dean says rolling his eyes. Sam shuts the door in his face.
"You remember how to drive a stick?" Crowley asks his smile sharp. He always found it amusing that Dean's father owned a Salvage Yard but Dean gets driven around in a limo. He doesn't seem to realize that, that is exactly the point.
, the woman is clutching her cross. The elevator opens, revealing the operator who stutters when he sees Dean. "Good evening, Sir." The guy says not meeting his eye. "Penthouse, right?"
Sams's eyes brighten as he looks towards the door, pushing past Dean to go look at Cerberus. Only to stop mid shove to glance at Deans' neck. "Is that a hickey?"
“Do you want to do what you promised me last night?” Dean asks, placing open mouth kisses against Cas’s throat.
Dean grabs the contract and reads the first page. He sees his name, Castiel’s and Claire’s buried beneath the legalise. Even with his years spent doing paperwork half of this makes no sense, but the gist is there. “Where do I sign?”
Castiel pulls his hand back as if he's been stung. "This is what I mean Dean. I don't want to influence you into testifying just because of what happened."
Dean stares at her. "Psychic?" He guesses, trying not to flush at what she might have seen in his head.
The Car ride is thick with tension and Dean can't decide if it’s a good thing or an awful one. He gives Castiel directions to his place. His hands fisted in his slacks so he doesn't reach out and touch Castiel’s skin. "You can park here," Dean says when they finally get to the entrance of his apartment.
"Ah-" Dean waffles, rubbing at the spot that now that Sam brings it up, stings like fuck.
Dean blinks, “No -”
“Almost, just need to put my bag in my room.”
Castiel swallows. Jesus Christ, he’s actually going to get paid eight hundred bucks for this bullshit. “Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night? I mean, I could just blow you and be on my way.”
Castiel does, putting both it and the wallet on the table along with Dean's duffel bag. Unsure as to why Dean's acting so shifty, Castiel steps back and searches Dean's other jacket pocket. He pulls out a cheap zippo and a packet of matches but no cigarettes. “Were you going to sell whatever else you found in the grave?” He asks depositing the items.
Sam sighs, blowing out a long sigh that ruffles his hair. "No, I stopped at the bunker first, I had to get a few things. But I'm fine, just tired, there's been a lot of shit going on."
“You really think it could get that bad?” Dean asks biting his lip. Jack's such a sweet kid but Dean's heard of Archangels who conquered cities. Hurting thousands for more power. He knows that none of them are considered stable, only power crazy. He dent want Jack to end up like that.
“And what, you couldn’t hold your horses long enough to not kill yourself by flying?” Dean says trying not to get his hopes up that maybe Cas is in this with him. That, despite what he said earlier about Sam and what he did in that alleyway, Cas still has faith in him. “What happened to your plan to drink yourself to death?”
Cas looks back at Dean and frowns. "I thought you were allergic?"
“It is Dean, right? I am pronouncing that correctly. This new language you’ve concocted is very different from the last one.”
Dean snorts pouring coffee into the biggest mug they own. The handles chipped, and it's the ugliest shade of green Deans ever seen. Cas found it in a garage sale, when Dean had stopped to look at the owner's collection of tapes. Dean had bought it for him without saying a thing about how ugly it was. After all, coffee was the only human thing Cas still had a taste for. His stomach churns. "You say that like me and you haven't had massive blow-outs."
"I did," Eileen says, shrugging a little. "I've been trying to talk to Sam since, but no one teaches a hunter how to deal with the ghost stuff."
Dean looks up, his cheeks flushing, "Ah - Because the penthouse is the best and I like the best."
Strong arms wrap around Deans waist and interrupt him from his musings. Cas's stubble scratching over his shoulder as he presses a kiss to Deans neck. "G' morning." He mumbles, voice thick with sleep.
"I have a better option," Castiel says, biting his lip. "I just don't think you'd be amenable to it after this morning."
Dean coughs, "Yeah me either. It's good to see you Cas."
It takes a few hours. Sam had only seen Ruby do this once, but he's always been a fast learner. They end up using Cas's mug as a way of connecting to him. Sam mumbling the incantation over and over again until it takes. The map finally catching fire, making Dean jump, and rush over to the smouldering remains. When he sees what it's on it, he starts to laugh.
"Oh," Dean finally says understanding why Sam's acting so anxious. "You're trying to get that Summer job, aren't you?”
He's kind of surprised to see Castiel surrounded by papers on his day off. His corporate get up is still there a bit more relaxed than usual. The guys practically Fabio with his shirt unbuttoned like that. Dean is not equipped to deal with that kind of bullshit this early in the morning. Who the hell does Castiel even think he is anyway? Giving Dean a crisis like this. It’s just not polite. Dean can't just not look at the guy's chest when it's just out there like that.
But Cas was something different, something Dean had never heard of before. "A Warlock,' Cas said over his ale. An Irish brogue clear in his voice. Dean had questions and Cas had answered them all. Watching Dean as the drinks flowed, their knees knocking under the table.
"Dean nothing is getting out of Minnesota unless they have a four-wheel drive and a snowplough upfront," Sam says reassuringly. Dean would feel guilty about the joy that hits him. He trusts Sam to keep safe. And if it means in the meantime he's got a perfect excuse to stay with Cas then that's just how it is. Sam laughs when Dean sighs in relief. "I'll be fine at Rowena's by myself. I just need to know what Eileen needs. I don't want to abandon her Dean."
Dean rolls his eyes, “No but -“
"I said I'm fine Cas!" Dean snaps face flushed. The current boards jammed. He bares his teeth and tugs at the nail again. Cas mutters from the ground. Vague Enochian phrases that don't sound too polite. He used to do that a lot when he helped Dean out with cases. Always after Dean pissed him off. His stomach churns, fixing the roof is supposed to be helping this for fuck sake. He's trying his best not to be an asshole and he's failing. Looking up at the grey clouds overhead, Dean stifles a groan because Cas is right. It’s going to pour. He keeps ripping off the old boards.
“None of it,” Charlie says, waving her hands even though she’s supposed to be fucking driving. “I’m just saying if you apologize for being a dick, maybe even tell him why -”
Dean clears his throat, ignoring the way his face heats just at the warm sound of Cas’s laughter. Between last-minute adjustments to Optimism and nerves about Sam’s wedding, it’s been a while since he so much as looked at another person with any sort of lust. Nevermind this tongue-tying attraction he feels just from being in Cas’s vicinity - and worst of all, it’s something he's just gonna have to ignore. Mostly because he doesn't want to be that dick at Sam's wedding, but there is also the fact Castiel is a wizard. Dean hasn't had the balls to flirt with a wizard since Cassie Robinson left him heartbroken after telling him he wasn't enough. Wizards just don’t mix well with Squibs, everyone knows that.
"Someone left them there, Charlie, I couldn't leave them out in the cold!"
Dean stumps his toe against the counter and drops his spatula. His face flushing. "I - Ugh - thank you." He croaks, unsure how he responds.
Castiel narrows his eyes, glaring at Dean's scarred hand and shrugs. “Probably not.”
Entering the bullpen Dean watches with pride as Sam hauls Nick into the cells. Crowley barking at his heels. There's no sign of Castiel or the Kline’s but Raphael is following Gabriel into an interrogation room. Dean hopes Kelly got to watch the bastard being cuffed. He smiles at the thought, watching as Nick smacks the bars of his cell. Jack will never be raised by this man and its all because of Bela. He wonders what Nick would do with a child, considering what Alistair did to her. Is that why he was so obsessed with Jacks powers? Dean shivers at the thought.
“If I keep messing up his plans, then why did he keep bringing me back?”
“Gabe informs me it's the dimples, Rowena thinks it's my ass.”
Cas groans, "Yes, and you know why. Now go to sleep Dean."
“Yeah, well, we’re friends,” Dean whines. “I call Sam every night.”
It’s then that Cas’s technique changes. Every time Dean pulls at Cas's hair. Cas caresses Dean's skin with his hands touching every inch of him. Every time Dean bites his neck, Cas responds with hot and soothing licks over Dean's collarbone. He places sweet kisses to Dean's cheek and behind his ear. Cas meets every act of Dean's aggression with an act so gentle Dean's trembling beneath him pulling at their underwear so he can fist their dicks together while scoring his nails down Cas’s back.
"Chucks time is up," Amara says, raising her brow at Dean. "Despite what he likes to believe we aren't the be-all and end-all. There have always been other forces at play. The kind of cosmic laws I barely understand but one of those is fundamental. Death is inevitable and Chuck is meant to die. He hasn't grown, he hasn't adapted and because of that, a successor came around to take over for him. Jack Kline is the new God."
