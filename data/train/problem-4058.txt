Cas leans down and presses a kiss to Dean’s temple, surprisingly tender. “I want to find out how much you can take.”
They can’t figure out this fucking curse. Cas is still as a corpse but still breathing, heart still beating, limbs still warm to the touch, but he won’t wake up no matter what they do.
Dean didn’t realize how tense he still was until all the tension leaves him in a rush. Cas is still his Dom, and in this moment, that’s all that matters. “Thank you,” he says, and Cas seems to lighten a bit.
It takes more than one waiter to bring out the plates of sushi rolls, and Dean stares at each of the rolls suspiciously as the plates are set down, but he makes the mistake of glancing up when Cas says
“You’re very beautiful,” Cas whispers, and Dean closes his eyes against it, though there’s nothing he can do to stop the flush spreading from his cheeks down to his chest. “I’ve wanted you for so long.”
Cas squints at him for a moment, that truth-stare that makes Dean flush under the scrutiny. If he weren’t already lobster red from his face down his chest. “If that’s the case, can I join you? Do you want a beer?”
Dean is on his feet before Cas finishes speaking. He can feel Cas’s eyes on his back as he crosses the yard, and Cas watches him with the same intense gaze as he returns.
Castiel is pretty fucking mixed up, too. He thought he was happy as an elite Andalite soldier, but he’s never belonged the way he does with these humans.
“I’m in the middle of creating another masterpiece and my weed guy shows up. So we’re smoking and having a grand old time, and he says he was at Dean and Cas’s the other day and I say, wait were you at Dean
Cas hums in agreement, but Dean’s already distracted, thinking about all the things Cas does to him when he’s the one spread out underneath. One of the best is when Cas pauses a beating to kiss his neck or his temple or the base of his spine. On impulse, Dean leans down and nuzzles into the soft spot behind Cas’s ear, leaving a barely-kiss there. Cas’s shampoo smells like a windswept day at the beach, hot sun and cool water.
Dean said something cheeky via text just to rile Cas up, so he’s not entirely surprised to find Cas in his kitchen when he gets home from work. “Honey, I’m home,” Dean says with a grin.
As soon as they escape, without even bothering to keep his voice down, Dean says, “Isn’t it fucked up that omegas are expected to cover up our scent so alphas don’t lose control but
"I, uh. Made you some hot chocolate. I know you’re a coffee guy but this is a house recipe I’ve been playing with and I just thought you might like it so —” Dean realizes he’s rambling like an idiot and cuts himself off, just holding the mug out to Cas.
Their panel runs long — after a long day attending talks themselves — and they walk back to the hotel in rigid silence, Dean’s jaw clenched. Cas is tense next to him, too, and Dean feels like an asshole for telling him it will be fun.
car when they could’ve been in the Impala, but Cas made it clear he was driving and Dean wasn’t to argue. Which is why Dean also tries to hold down his grimace when Cas presses a hand to Dean’s lower back to guide him into a sushi restaurant.
he’s teasing, his heart falls and lands crooked. He’s not an idiot around other Doms like he is with Cas,
“Cool.” Dean stands, tosses his backpack over his shoulder. He has a feeling Castiel might shake things up a little, brush off the dusty shelves of boredom. “Talk to you soon, Cas.”
“Because you’re ace or because you like to wear women’s underwear? I appreciate both of those things.”
Despite the wings and the grace and the almost-invincibility, Dean is endearingly, infuriatingly human. Even at that first moment, with Cas’s knife sticking out of his chest, Dean grinned like he was greeting an old friend and said, “Heya, Cas.” They were both lost—or found—after that.
Dean grimaces. “Point taken. This one’s only empty because of me,” he says, wiggling a tentacle at him.
Dean’s hands are stained navy and leave a streak of it across Cas’s shirt when they curl together in bed, but Cas doesn’t seem to mind. He just traces his fingertips along the edge of the collar, over and over again, a soothing habit he never gives up, no matter how many years pass.
dean is a hunter, only makes it to the grocery store at weird-ass times because he’s always out chasing down wendigos or whatever other baddie is menacing them that week (or on a bender)
Even though he’s smiling, Dean’s heart sinks and his mouth goes dry. “Yeah? What’s up?” He’s proud that the words come out even instead of sounding terrified of another
Cas laughs and pushes up Dean’s shirt so he can kiss the dimples on either side of his spine. Dean swallows, then shudders as Cas starts to press kisses across each of the many marks on Dean’s ass and thighs. With each kiss is a word like
Michael’s house is an opulent monstrosity, and it’s a long walk down pristine cream-colored carpet before they make it to the master bedroom. Michael’s wife hired an interior decorator when they moved in, and it’s obvious. It looks like real people have never slept here.
After three hits that will be welts by morning, Cas pauses and runs his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Color?”
Cas wraps his hand around Dean’s cock and strokes, tight, all the way over the head and back down. The sound of their lovemaking — because it does feel that way, even if Dean won’t say it — is even more obscene while they’re still surrounded by sunset light through open windows.
Dean manages half of a weak smile, mostly still reeling with the throbbing heat spreading over his ass. “Just a sec.”
“I know it’s a dick move to do this without even talking to you but — it just —” Cas is staring at the kitten. “It just happened,” Dean says lamely, gesturing at the cat.
Dean’s alarm sings and he groans, a mix of stress because there’s more work to be done and relief that the day is over and he gets to talk to Cas again.
The implication seems to be that Greebo looks good all the time so there’s no need to comment on it, but I generally look like shit so you’d like to call out that I don’t today.
“You hungry?” Dean says, and for a moment, Cas’s heart stops, but then he continues, “I made burgers.”
Cas takes a shallow breath and Dean squeezes his bicep. Dean’s heart pounds as he says, “We can make it work. I’ll take the couch or something.”
Cas reaches down, not to stoke but to hide himself from Dean’s eyes. Dean squeezes his knee, hoping it’s reassuring, and says, “Ok, then I suggest you flip over.”
“Relationships aren’t transactional,” Dean says, parroting something Cas has told him more than once.
Cas’s hand speeds up, makes Dean moan, makes Dean paint his pleasure between them, Cas’s cock still deep and throbbing.
Castiel laughs, and even though it’s reserved, it’s a really good laugh. “I haven’t conquered that one yet, though it would be interesting to see how the tentacle color aspect is translated. I suppose it’s back to DuoLingo for me.”
Cas looks over at him. Just a regular look, at Dean’s face, not a leer at the lace on his chest. “What’s it?”
Dean pours moans into their kiss as he comes, slow like the tide rolling in. He floats in it for ages, not minding if he’s pulled under, until Cas asks, “Can you get up long enough to take off the blanket?”
“Fantastic.” Cas gestures towards the dresser in the corner that houses all of Dean’s various toys and implements. “Choose something, please.”
Cas was worried, but agreed easily enough to a drive into the Hill Country. They don’t talk at first, just humming idly along to Bad Company, Cas watching the traffic pass out the passenger window. When they’re finally clear of the city limits, Cas lets out a long sigh like he’s been holding his breath for days.
“Do you like wood?” Cas asks, the paddle dropped to the side for him to squeeze and knead at Dean’s already tender flesh.
Grab or hit or kiss or urge towards the bedroom. Instead, Dean’s putting away one of the beers and then collapsing on the couch alone.
“Dean,” Cas breathes. “This is — this is incredible.” Cas gets up, comes closer to look at it. Still sounding a little unbelieving, he says again, “This is
“Ok,” Dean says, glancing up. Cas’s smile makes his shoulders feel lighter, and he finds it in himself to tease Cas for ordering what sounds like the entire menu for them to try.
This time Dean kneels purposefully, even holds his hands behind his back, gaze tipped up at Cas. “To clarify,” Dean says, “Me too. I’m—I’m in love with you, too.”
Dean takes a deep, slow breath, humming in contentment, before he fully realizes where he is and who he’s wrapped around.
Dean hates this. He’s not a sub who likes humiliation, and this feels almost as bad. “I’m always good.”
After giving his own cock a loose stroke, Dean squeezes Cas’s ass again before spreading his cheeks to reveal his hole. He likes the way Cas tenses in anticipation just before Dean licks, soft and light, just a taste.
Tentatively, Dean settles back down with his head on Cas’s shoulder, Cas’s arm curling around his middle. Cas presses his face back into Dean’s hair and says, “I like your scent.”
Something clicks. Something seems clearer now, maybe just Cas’s adoration, but all of Dean’s doubts about himself fade a little to the background. It makes him brave enough to say, “I have something for you, too. I mean, it’s dumb — but awhile ago, you said that you might want to have one of my paintings, and maybe you don’t anymore, so you can totally trash it —”
“Ok,” Dean rasps. He shifts his hips so Cas can reach hands between him and the counter, working his button open and zipper down, but otherwise is still.
Dean grins when Cas bursts into laughter again. Cas’s laugh is so goddamn good, rough but melodious, and Dean feels particularly pleased to make him laugh now, when so many other Doms would one-eighty into punishment mode.
—but Dean insists and Cas doesn’t put up too much of a fuss. Cas leaves the kitchen altogether, and a minute later music starts to play from one of Dean’s speakers.
“Oh. No. Thank you. But no, I–” Is Cas nervous? Cas is never nervous. “–I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I’d like to suck your cock.”
“Yeah, you’re – you’re asexual. Right? That’s what you said when…” He can’t finish the sentence, flushing red in embarrassment even in the silence of his own apartment, nothing but heartbeats.
That pleased little hum again, then he straddles Dean’s thighs, taking a long moment just to look him over. Dean blushes all the way down his chest under his Dom’s appreciation. It’s even better knowing that Cas loves him.
Usually he goes up to the front to greet clients when they arrive, but there’s a knock on his door at 1:18. Dean takes a deep breath and puts on a smile. “Hey, I’m Dean —” his spiel cuts off because it’s Cas. “Are you ok? What’s wrong?” Dean says in a rush.
They eat tacos sitting on the floor of their hotel room, sharing chips and guac and bickering over which Discworld books are best. Cas loves Tiffany Aching —
They sit next to each other on the couch, knees bumping. “I meant to give this to you over the weekend,” Cas says. “But I was — a coward, basically, afraid that you wouldn’t want it. But I.” His hands are unsteady as he picks up the box and he fiddles with the latch. “You can say no. I understand if it’s too soon, or if you don’t want —”
“It can wait,” Dean says. “This is good. What we’re doing. This is helping.” He hopes Cas doesn’t realize this is mostly just like a lot of the other times they hang out. Most of the time he ignores the urge to
Dean doesn’t die immediately. He’s thrown clear of the Impala and lays in the middle of the road, staring up at the bright blue sky for what seems like forever but is really only a few minutes, and then he’s gone.
But it’s eleven before he has to use one. Maybe he’s supposed to comfort himself that she wasn’t human, but she looked it, long mouse-colored hair and mud-colored eyes. Nothing special to look at until he pulls the trigger. The bullet hits home and she goes the floor.
The hotel elevator is full, mostly stinking alphas, and Dean holds his breath as long as he can on the way up. He’s pretty sure Cas is doing the same next to him.
Cas watches Dean’s face as he fucks him through it and Dean watches back, eyelashes fluttering as his cock gives a final jerk. Cas’s fingers come out with a wet sound that is less sexy now that the haze of pleasure has mostly abated, but Dean still feels uncomfortably empty without him.
Before Dean’s stop comes up, he buys the phone case for Charlie, and leaves a little note for the artist:
Rhythm or not, Cas moans and purrs and thrusts his hips back and forth between Dean’s mouth and his hand, chasing that high, a sheen of sweat across his lower back. “There you go, sweet omega,” Dean murmurs, stroking tighter and slipping his thumb in a little deeper at the same time.
Cas takes a step closer, almost pressed along Dean’s back now, and says quietly, “In my closet there’s a rattan cane leaning against the wall, directly on the right when you walk in.” The rough of his voice
Shakily, Dean makes it to his feet, steadied by Cas’s hand at his elbow. Cas bundles up the comforter, then guides Dean back into the bed. Dean collapses into the sheets, letting out a long sigh. His eyes fall closed and he doesn’t manage to move all the way through Cas carefully wiping him clean, but he does blink them open to watch Cas unzipping and slipping out of his jeans. He wears ridiculously hot underwear for someone uninterested in sex.
Cas waits all the way through his next hit before saying anything. “Do you really want to know? We don’t talk about this.”
“Hey,” Dean says awhile later, twisting to look up at Cas. The tv is chattering but he doesn’t remember Cas turning it on and hasn’t taken in a single word. “What does it feel like, Dominating someone?”
“Why not?” Dean says, shrugging like it’s nothing. Like his heart isn’t ready to pound out of his chest.
Dean wakes up with an omega tucked under his chin, bare in his arms. Their scents have merged on the air, Cas’s spinning clouds and Dean’s meadow at dusk, and Dean takes a moment to revel in it, a purr starting to rumble in his chest. It’s been a long time since Dean has marked, and been marked in turn, like this.
Dean hurries, bare feet leaving brief footprints in the grass as he crosses their backyards. Last year they took down the fence between them to make one big space—big for the city at least. Cas even talked Dean into flower beds on his side so they match.
“Several,” Cas says, and sets the timer on his phone to seven minutes. “Show me what the cool kids did in closets.”
these are just some thoughts about team free will as animorphs that i posted on tumblr awhile ago and wanted to archive here.
Cas takes a deep, shuddering breath, then slowly lays on his back, throwing his arm over his eyes. “Just — just a second.”
Cas is familiar with the en suite by now and takes only moments to grab and wet a washcloth. Dean reaches for it but Cas shrugs his hands away, carefully cleaning Dean himself, then leading him to the bed and urging him to climb in.
Dean almost goes to his knees. He would’ve if Cas asked, right in the produce section. But Cas only told him to wait, so he does.
The guy looks down at his phone like he didn’t remember what it was, then squints at Dean. “I designed it.”
“Is he ok?” Charlie asks, and then she squints at the screen. “You are full of shit, Dean Winchester.”
In his art room, Dean looks the painting over a final time. He hates it and loves it at the same time. He loves it, because here is a physical manifestation of the way he feels about his dom, but he hates it, because he doesn’t have anywhere near the skill to hope Cas will truly like it.
They lose Charlie. And Ash, and Meg, and then Mary, eviscerated by Visser II while Sam and Dean watched, impotent.
Cas gave up on holding back his laughter two beers ago, and now he can’t stop, especially with the way Dean seems to glow under Cas’s joy. His smile grows wider, his impressions more exaggerated, the fish get bigger in his stories.
In the distance, a roar that makes Cas’s heart stop, then beat double time. “What you failed to say,” he continues in a whisper, “is that the dinosaurs are
Cas smiles and gives Dean another smoke-filled kiss, this time lingering through the exhale. “So what’s on the agenda for tonight?”
Dean uses his hand to finish Cas off, and this time most of it manages his cheek and lips, sliding down his chin, and Dean greedily laps up what his tongue can reach. Cas stares down at him, reverent, and swipes a thumb through the mess before pressing his finger into Dean’s mouth.
Just as abruptly as the kiss started, it ends, with Cas grabbing Dean’s hair and shoving him to bend across the kitchen island, ass in the air. Dean hides a grin in his arms as Cas presses one hand on the back of Dean’s head and the other at the small of his back. “Stay there.”
The casual possessiveness of it makes Dean shiver. Cas gives Dean an appraising look and says, “I’d like that massage now.”
Cas doesn’t even appear to read the text before he goes to night mode and drops his phone back on the coffee table. Dean does the same, then shifts closer to Cas, laying his head on his shoulder. “Ravish me, huh?”
He sits still, his spine as straight as he can get it. He tries to breathe, he really does, but the air doesn’t come.
Cas and Dean connected two rooms together, so when Jack has bad dreams or needs something, he can knock and be let right on through.
All three sets ruffle, as though speaking their disagreement, and he scowls at them. All three flap a couple times, first the top set, then the middle, then the lower set, and they burst into flames.
Dean laughs, and god, Castiel could listen to that sound for the rest of eternity. “Still tired, Cas? It’s eight.”
He offers a tearful nod, another few wet streaks painting his face. Dean closes his eyes, allowing two more tears to fall as he nuzzles into Cas’ hand. The injured one. The left hand.
“Uh, yeah, sure Cas. Come in.” Dean stands back, holding the door open for Cas, and Cas smiles, stepping through.
“And, well, I told them I didn’t get it fully either,” Claire laughs, and Cas understands, suddenly.
“They’re beautiful.” He whispers, and Cas leans his head back, letting it rest against Dean’s shoulder. His upper set of wings curves upward, as high as they can go, the tops touching and forming a malformed halo around their heads.
Dean explores while he does his own, probably shitty, version of wing grooming or something. He watches the way the feathers react to him, feels the way they push back into his hands for closer contact.
They sit like that for a while. Maybe full minutes, maybe a half hour. Maybe five hours, maybe ten. Cas loses time again, like he’s apt to do whenever Dean’s around.
Dean underlines number nine twice. It was the very first song he played for Cas, and where this mixtape came from originally. How had he forgotten?
“I’ve been running this bunker for ten years, since I was sixteen. My parents died, and since I had the most power, and maturity, they entrusted it to me with the helpful counseling of my two brothers, Gabriel and Balthazar.”
“So, um, congrats, both your kids are trans.” Claire says, and the words are brash, they should be said with a smile, but she sounds terrified, her eyes down.
“Good. If you have any questions, if you think for even one second I wouldn’t approve of something, ask me.” Cas turns, ready to leave and get Sam’s face, his resigned, cold expression, out of his head.
“-and I swear to… something, that if you use bandages to bind or you don’t take breaks like I told you, I will stab you.”
Dean hasn’t been in long term relationships often, (well, ever) don’t get him wrong, but that is usually the absolute
Cas feels Dean’s fingertips graze just under his cheekbone. Not tugging, not pulling, just… gently pressing.
Cas glances over his shoulder towards Charlie, who nods, and the man- Dean’s eyebrows furrow further into his frown. “Help you with what?” Cas asks, his eyes returned to Dean.
Cas’ knees dig into Dean’s hips, and Dean rests now on one knee, his back arched toward Cas. His lips are open, and one hand is still supporting Cas’, but the other is on Cas’ shoulder now.
He reaches the common room, sitting back and looking around. Benny always did say he had the ‘cop look’. Far too observant, blocked off, seemingly uninterested. It was a skill, certainly, and Dean, well. He’d mastered it.
Jack’s grin just brightens, but they shake their head. “No, I like my pronouns, or any other ones, and my name. My mom gave them to me. But I think some new clothes would be cool! Could we go shopping?” And with that, Sam goes over to Jack, clearly noticing the way Claire’s head snapped up, their eyes wide. Sam takes Jack away, discussing all the things a 3 year old nonbinary nephilim should be discussing with their Auntie.
So Dean works silently. He cleans Cas’ wound (which leads to the momentary intrusive thought of Dean using his tongue instead) and puts gauze over it, taping the gauze down with old scotch tape.
Cas smiles and nods. “I’m going to need you to trust me, though. The way there isn’t exactly… ideal. But the house, it hides and protects The Sanctuary.”
Sam opens the door to his bedroom, bleary eyed and confused. His eyes are tinted red and his face is still a bit pale, but of course, he’s not the only one.
When Kaia joined the ranks, and started dating Claire, she became a daughter too. More like an in-law, sure, but she’s his daughter too.
He glances at Charlie, and she nods, but she stops walking. She steps back, resting her back against a pillar and kicking up her leg. “Good luck.”
He wants to have the urge to scream. So badly, he wants to. He wants to hate Dean, but he can’t. He can’t hate him.
“Of course, Cas. Um, actually, would you mind… staying? I have my laptop, we can play movies, listen to music?”
Of course, it doesn’t last long, and both Sam and Cas laugh as Dean and Claire both shove away with cheeky grins, flushed.
But, of course, Dean doesn’t say a word. He seems to lose himself in the moment, and he sits there, up on one knee and staring at Cas with those green, green eyes.
He clenches his teeth together, and even as air fills his lungs, he can't breathe. It feels like he will never breathe again.
Cas closes his eyes, and when Dean’s hands leave him, he begins to ache again. Empty. His heart drops and he stares at the floor.
Cas is staring at the small bee with adoration in his eyes. The same look gets shifted to Jack, before Cas says, “I’ll take them to checkout!”
Dean looks Cas up and down, before shrugging. “Same to you, I guess.” He says, the tone slightly teasing.
Dean paces around his bed, smirking as the cool screen of his phone presses into his cheek. His expression comes out in his tone and he sits on his bed.
“I’m,” Cas pauses, thinking for a moment, “I’m glad they’re getting past their differences, I suppose.”
“Shut up. Look, man! They’re like, the cheapest little souvenirs and… you know, I don’t know when we’re coming back.”
He’s wearing his big overcoat along with his suit. It’s not something he generally wears around The Sanctuary, usually just wearing it outside.
Dean thinks for a moment. It doesn’t take him long to figure out Cas is referencing his wings. He had been curious about them, after all. If it won’t lose him any points, maybe now’s a good time.
Dean speaks Zeppelin. He’s got it all down. The problem is that he can’t get it down to thirteen. And because of this, he can’t even start with one.
Dean is getting easier to be around. At first- after the initial aftershock/afterglow of their getting back together- it was hard. It was scary, and tentative, and Cas could feel it from Dean too.
Dean finally walks over, his footsteps pounding the floor in certainty. He kneels at Cas’ feet, setting a little box beside him on the floor.
Cas understands, he does. But he has a feeling that Dean and Sam have been through a lot together. He has a feeling their bond much surpasses his with his brothers.
He presses kisses to the bends of each wing, feeling them shiver beneath his touch. He kisses the tips of them too, and it sends sparks of electricity through his nervous system.
“Which of you are with me?” Dean asks, his stance proud and tall. He puts on a mask that screams confident, and sure of himself.
For the rest of the day, Jack holds a fixation on the airborne and the waterborne animals, but the owls are a point of extra excitement.
“Yes, Dean. Like in the Bible. If you really want to see my wings, though, we’re going to have to go somewhere open. Like a clearing. Preferably covered, because they’re fairly noticeable, but probably not inside any building. Well, not any building that we don’t want burning down.”
” Dean clears his throat, and he watches his father’s face turn purple with pure, unadulterated rage. Among the crowd, though, it seems like… maybe he’s touched some hands. Maybe someone’s agreeing with him.
“Yeah, man, totally. Don’t worry about me. I was just wondering, uh, you know, I’ve always been able to see, like, the shadows of your wings, but I’ve never seen them. Could I see them?” Dean asks, fiddling with the drawstrings of Cas’ sweatpants. They’re women’s sweatpants, Dean knows, but when he questioned Cas about it, Cas just shrugged and grinned, claiming they were “softer” and “thinner for the summer, Dean.”
He thinks of how Dean holds his gaze, every day. Like a staring match, between children. But much more intense, while still somehow being tentative and careful.
picked one, but I got some for everyone! Eileen, Auntie Rowena, Auntie Charlie, Uncle Gabriel, Uncle Bobby, I got one for all of the angels except for Aunt Naomi because Cas really doesn’t like her, I got one for all the hunters… well, the ones I know, and all of you guys, too!” Jack sets down his pile, before picking out a little bee, a black owl with giant eyes, and a lion.
Cas steps forward and hugs Dean, his arms wrapping around his middle and his eyes closing. Their heads rest on each other’s shoulders, and they stand there. Dean mostly supports Cas, and eventually they break.
Cas doesn’t know about Dean, but he’s nearly asleep. He’s never been good at sleeping, but the urge almost overtakes him. It comes over Cas in waves, but he resists it as long as he can. He resists it in hopes that Dean will say something now. Anything.
Because he’d give anything to Dean. He’d give anything for him. Just to see him live another day. Just to catch a glimpse of the man who’d lasted decades in hell without even considering picking up a blade. The man who’d taken an angel to a brothel to get him successfully deflowered. The man who’d taken the job up for himself after a fit of laughter in an alleyway.
Dean knows Cas loves making the rounds. He wants to help people. It’s his biggest flaw, and one of the reasons he’s utterly perfect.
Cas takes his hand back, but his smile also remains, soft and gentle. Understanding. “Don’t be nervous. You’ll be okay. I think they’ll like you. Although I should warn you, there are… many, many people down there.”
“I’ve been busy, Love. And forgive me, I know it’s implausible for you, but sex isn’t constantly on my mind.
Surprise, Bitches! Starting now, updates can be expected on Mondays and Thursdays. So, I'll see you then, and I hope you enjoy. <3
Dean flips to his back, letting out a sigh. Benny doesn’t bother questioning it, though. Dean is glad, because he doesn’t want to examine his own actions all that closely either. “Yeah, I guess.”
At the end of Chapter 15, you guys can hop into my inbox and, if you'd like, I will explain why these next few chapters are short. Unfortunately, that will require spoilers, so, end of Chapter 15, kay? Anything else, though, you can send here or, as always, @angelfamilydrama on tumblr!
Dean pauses, thinking through the words sticking on his tongue, on the roof of his mouth, chewy and thick, but impossible to swallow down.
Alright! That is the last ~2,000 word chapter! The next two are over 3,000, so come prepared! Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!
“No. Meg’s got a leak in her bathroom, nothing she can’t fix, Crowley’s still a little bitch, um… Gabriel’s annoying. Nothing new.”
The wings are still the same size, just not as bright. No, these ones fit the nighttime more anyways.
“Well… yeah, I guess.” Dean looks back to Cas. “Isn’t that obvious? I mean, it shows whatever’s…” he hesitates, and Cas tilts his head, trying to beckon the words out of Dean’s mouth. “It shows what’s goin on in someone’s head.” He says, taking a sip of his water.
Cas shoots Gabriel a look, and he puts his hands up. “I know, I know. I groomed ‘em this morning, though, so it was a good time. See?” Gabriel turns around, spreading his wings slightly.
So Dean still helps his baby brother through nightmares, until Eileen takes over. Not only because she’s already in the room, but because she understands far more than anyone else involved could.
“Shit-,” he hears Dean whisper as he shifts up, sitting beside Cas and wiping the blood away with that same makeshift cloth. “I’m-,” Dean starts, but he doesn’t finish. He doesn’t finish, Cas knows, because the last time he tried to say it he’d been shushed.
He watches a young girl playing with building blocks, floating above her head. He hardly swallows a natural scowl, but, well, it is quite the endearing scene.
“Okay, okay,” Dean interrupts them finally, hands up, “I called you here for a reason, I promise. You gonna listen to me, or do I have to clap like a kindergarten teacher?”
The wings smell like Cas, that otherworldly static with a hint of thunderstorm. When the world buzzes with electricity, but you can’t help but go outside and soak it all in. The smell is just more intense here, and Dean buries his face in the feathers of the middle set and just breathes.
He reaches his destination, room 983, and he glances around, eyes scanning the hall, before he knocks. Three sharp raps on the wooden door.
Cas is excited now, Dean can see it in the flint in his eyes. He’s hesitant, embarrassed maybe, but he’s excited.
Sam gets introduced to the inhabitants of the Sanctuary, but Dean feels a sore, heavy weight on his chest as Sam learns more and more about the place Dean's been living in.
He’d never seen Dean with his hairstyle as spiky as this is, but Sam looks like she’s going to cry, so Cas assumes this is an old style of Dean’s.
Dean lets out a huff of a laugh, and they enter the ticket booth line. Dean knows he’s adding to their wonderful little family portrait, but he can’t help himself anymore; he takes Cas’ hand, smiling over at him. Cas returns the smile, raising his eyebrows slightly.
Gabriel pokes and prods for a bit, not really letting the topic change but not pushing it completely on Cas.
“Thank you, Charlie.” Castiel says, before turning on his heel and walking toward the bedrooms of The Sanctuary, eyes squeezed shut and lips pursed.
He puts his hands on the mass below him - Dean’s chest - and pushes down, his body leaning back into a lazy ‘u’. His eyes widen and he looks around.
“Oh. Um, I have a friend, and he told me about this guy that would help people like… well, like me. He gave an address and a name. Um, James. That’s you, right?”
Dean, who takes Cas’ hand in his, stares at it for a moment, then opens the box. Dean starts simple, though. He takes off Cas’ jewelry (and only receives a minor grumble in return), and presses a kiss, soft and gentle, to each section of newly exposed skin.
Dean’s taller than Cas, technically. But in this moment, he feels so small, burying his head in Dean’s shoulder and wrapping his arms tight around Cas.
And every time he does it, Cas lets out a soft laugh, biting Dean’s lower lip lightly, before returning to the kiss. It lasts a little longer than the last time they’d kissed, but it only stops when Dean has his hands up the back of Cas’ shirt. His fingers hit a dip in the skin, and Cas pulls away, eyes wide.
Dean nods. “I’ll need it.” He mutters, before making his way into the station, swinging the door open.
They’re starting with something like Dean’s, and Dean still glows with the same fatherly pride he had walked in the front door with.
Cas and Dean make their way into The Sanctuary, and Dean gets to meet the inhabitants and Cas’ friends.
Dean finally pulls away, only to spread his arms as far as they’ll get, pressing his chest against Cas’s back as best as he can.
The words just seem to pour gasoline over the fire in his soul, and he looks away from Sam again, his hands shoved into his pockets.
“Cas, you know this isn’t good for you. Please? We can talk to Charlie, Gabe, whoever you need. Whatever you need to convince you this isn’t right. It’s not good for you.” Dean tugs Cas over to the bed, and Cas sits down with him.
“Well, kid, you got somethin’ you want me to call you?” That’s all he says, but he’s smiling at both Jack and Claire like they all share a secret.
Dean walks over, his footsteps falling in sync beside Cas’, and Sam does the same. Dean glances over and yep, sure enough, Jack is on the other side of Cas, looking inches away from grabbing his dad’s wrist and dragging him toward the Zoo’s entrance before them.
After dinner, they walk back to the common room, before Cas offers to take Dean up to the small house atop the bunker.
“They’ll heal,” he says instead, his eyes growing large and sad as he stares down at Dean on his knees. Dean, who stares right back.
“I’ve never found a single place like that in all my twenty-five years, but I’ll let you know when I do. We’ll have to move The Sanctuary there, but, like, just for telepaths and empaths and such.”
He watches a boy with a cat, openly holding a conversation. Dean’s eyebrows furrow at that, but they’re out of sight quickly.
But he has to. Dean pulls away, his palms to Cas’ chest. He doesn’t say a word, standing and watching Cas, eyebrows upturned on the inside.
“She had you, Cas, and that was enough for a bit, but,” Charlie shrugs, and Cas nods, knowing full well what she was going to say.
“Hey, baby,” Cas whispers after a long while, “you’re going to have to move. My, I-” His hoarse voice flees and leaves the room silent, but Cas thinks Dean understands.
, we’re still working through things. Neither of us should push things or force them into happening.” Cas gently cups Dean’s cheek, stroking his thumb over his cheekbone. Before long, though, his sincere moment is over, and he’s tugging Dean backwards.
I hope you liked this chapter! It is a short, more succinct one, so it can be of limited taste. Now, these next chapters can be a little heavy (in my opinion), so if at any point you feel stressed or upset while reading them, just let me know! I'll be happy to summarize them for you. Beside that, though, let me know what you thought! Either here, or tumblr is much appreciated. <3
It goes on until Dean sets down the blade. He sets it on the nightstand, and Cas realizes that he’s been walking backwards with Dean this whole time.
Jack, meanwhile, is hopping up and down and talking to Sam beside him about whatever he had just found.
Cas gestures for all the people to relax, sit down where they can, and they all do. He takes a place at the front of the room, sucking in a long breath.
“I’m going to start going around for devices tomorrow morning, the first room at 7am sharp. Everything should be running as normal, but we are going to have to be much more careful and safe. We can’t risk another infiltration. And, I’m going to have to ask something from you all.”
He wakes up at 10, sometimes 11, and in Dean’s arms. Or with Dean in his arms. Or, hell, back to back. He wakes up with Dean, and being in that moment is all that matters. Dean promises now, that he’s never going to leave before Cas wakes up.
He starts to run his hands down the length of Cas’ wings, his breath caught and dying in his throat. The feathers react to his very touch, ruffling up and tickling his rough, calloused hand.
“Dean,” Cas whispers, and he watches Dean’s lips twitch until his mouth lay open, the room still void of sound.
He watches Charlie grimace, and he feels a sharp twinge of pity. That earns him a glare, and he puts up his hands.
Despite the intensity in his eyes, Cas regards Dean with a soft expression. He turns from Dean and walks away, around 4 feet separated from Dean when he turns back.
Dean picks the movie, and Cas, he falls asleep, curled into Dean’s side and at peace for the first time since last night.
With that, his attention turns back to Dean’s work with a wince. (Pain’s still new to him, even after all these years of half-angelhood.) Dean’s applying old Super Glue to his wound, sealing it together. As he holds it, he looks up at Cas through his eyelashes, and Cas can’t help himself. His fingers grip into Dean’s hair and pull the man up, before shifting that same arm to rest behind Dean, pulling him close.
“Eh, all powers are the same to me.” He shrugs. “They might be different, but in the end they’re really just the same.”
“I’m worried that you don’t want to have sex with me anymore.” Dean whines stubbornly, his arms crossed over his chest. “We hardly sleep in the same room anymore, and we haven’t
“Hello Dean,” Castiel says, and he’s smiling. A real, genuine smile that, now that Dean’s thinking about it, he hasn’t really seen before.
“Okay.” Sam says finally, resigned. He looks blocked off, lacking the vulnerability he’d had just last night.
Dean doesn’t move away. He sucks on the area and kisses it until it’s bruised and swollen, grace gone and hiding from his desperate cling.
It took work, and help, and Dean. It took a lot of Dean. But Cas is finally starting to realize something he should have a long time ago.
Alright... Well, say goodbye to Cas! My Love, My Life. And say hello to Dean! And, of course, say good luck to Charlie, on her mission to find him. (You could say hello to me too, here or on my tumblr, but that's not near as important; Charlie needs the luck)
“They’re fine. Always fighting, per usual, but Lucifer’s getting better at putting that stubborn ass chin of his up and letting it go. The same for Michael.”
But if Dean needs a place, and he needs a grasp on his powers, and he needs to be a part of the community they have, well.
Cas is sleeping when he comes in. He does that now; sleep. He sleeps for two hours, three at best, and only after a joint or two, at the very least, but he sleeps.
They see Dean and Cas make eye contact in the mirror. Cas smiles, and Dean wiggles his eyebrows up and down.
Dean still happily talks to Kevin, and he’s getting used to Kevin’s telepathy that used to scare him so much.
“I was a kid when I met you, Dean. I figured you just looked like that,” They say, crossing their arms. “You look like a dude. Ya’re handsome too, I guess,” They mumble out that last bit, sitting back fully and crossing their arms.
Now, Claire knows scars. Intimately. She knows what most scars look like, and what they will look like depending on what happened.
He drags the tip of the blade along Cas’ palm. He watches light glow from the cut, and he licks the blood dripping down from it as he brings his mouth to the center.
Castiel and Dean talk, and Cas gets to know more of Dean and his power. A question lingers in Cas’ head, though. Should he let Dean into The Sanctuary?
Dean looks up into the rear view mirror, catching a glance of Jack in the back seat. Dean can’t help but smile, watching Jack with his arms wrapped around a child’s backpack(absolutely dwarfing him inside) and grinning. The backpack is Paw Patrol themed, because of
A young woman walks with her frien- girlfriend(they’re holding hands, apparently). She has giant horns sprouting out the tops of her head, almost two feet tall, including curves.
He glances over, and, lo and behold, those electric blue eyes are staring at him. Straight into his soul.
“Well, okay. Jacko here,” Claire throws an arm around Jack, but smiles at him despite her tease, “started talking to me a while ago.
Dean would definitely benefit from time in The Sanctuary. Cas could probably help him with controlling himself and his power.
First, I want to thank my beta, Mads. Yeah yeah, I'll keep this one quick, I promise. But Mads helped with every last aspect of this fic. It wouldn't be what is is without them. So, while it was my idea, and I wrote it, if you're thanking me, you should thank them too. And I have to do it myself, of course, so, thank you, Mads! For everything.
Lips, pink and soft, that curl up into a half smile, half smirk. That move so quickly and happily when talking about something he enjoys.
In the middle of Cas' breakdown, and finally, the aftermath, he can finally begin to feel again. One of the things that he's feeling, though, ifs the cracks in his gentle porcelain.
There’s not much spirit in the end. They have to take it where they can. They have to take it from each other.
“You have a day, you can work with Eileen on it. In fact, if she vouches for you having powers, I won’t question it.”
Finally, he reaches up, tucking a strip of hair behind Cas’ ear. He shifts forward, pressing his forehead against Cas’. The force with which he does it makes Cas rock backward and they both gasp, wrapping their arms around each other as they right themselves.
He looks at the ground, then meets Cas’ eyes again. He does this a few times, before turning completely and walking out the room.
Jack is growing up steadily now. He’s a good, healthy kid. And sweet, too. He’d never do anything to hurt Dean, Cas, or anyone in The Sanctuary.
Cas gets everywhere. All the vacant rooms are scrubbed, all the sheets are changed, hell, he even scrubs blood off the sparring floor.
Sitting at the top of Dean’s old, slightly crumpled (he got frustrated) page of notebook paper is a title.
“I’m perfectly fine just hanging out. But, I’m gonna go make some more coffee, kay?” Charlie stands up, holding a hand out.
Cas’ eyes soften as he replays the last ten minutes and remembers exactly how Dean had showed up. “Dean, do you want to talk about why you need my help?”
Now it’s not just his wings he can’t feel. It’s not just his grace that’s stopped flowing through him.
He calls over Sam, before handing him the lion. “You have the same hair.” He says, smiling brightly.
His feet hang over the armrest and his head rests on his arms, and he knows for a fact that he will be in pain in the morning. He just cannot and will not move.
He watches Dean’s face shift and twist into shock and what Cas would usually file under terror. He’s fairly used to people being scared of him. There are people in The Sanctuary who genuinely run away from him. Usually newcomers.
Cas flushes very lightly, his mind grazing over its own thoughts for the last twenty minutes. “Uh, well… long day. Too tired to really… move. And I don’t know, I’m thinking.”
Cas wakes up… however many hours later, and he’s now laying down fully, curled up around Dean. Dean’s awake, staring at the ceiling. When Cas stirs, looking at Dean with blinking, tired eyes, Dean smiles. It’s warm, his lips curling up and creating an expression that both sets Cas on ice and burns him from the inside out. “Morning, Sunshine.”
He does, but it’s a simple peck on the lips. It’s smile ridden though, and Dean can feel just how loving it is.
“Cas, I, um, I know we’ve only known each other for a month or so, but I really enjoy… getting to spend time with you and stuff, and I was wondering, well… God, I sound like some stupid teennager, but, I like you. Like, a lot, and… If you’re not into guys, or whatever, that’s cool, but-”
But, as he walks through the forest, weaving through tall, thick trees, he’s sure this won’t be the last they see of it.
Alright, I’m going to try to keep this short, I promise, but I’d rather it be here than at the end end. So, I just want to give a big huge thanks to those who agreed to beta read. On tumblr, that’s @heteroheavencar, @sorakhhikari98, and @a-really-tired-really-gay-bitch. All of your input was so valuable, and your support meant a lot. And in a fully different category is Mads, @supernatural-gay-undertones. Mads here helped me with almost every aspect of this fic other than writing, and this fic is just as much due them as it is to me. I could personally never thank them enough. And, as to a short note on the fic, this fic truly is my baby. I’ve had the idea for probably a year now, but only recently did I decide to write it. I’m so glad I did, though, and I’m so proud of it. I know you haven’t read anything after this chapter(yet, of course), but I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy.
“Yeah, I guess. And then your brothers are doing fine, getting a lot of the shopping done. Although there seems to be a shortage of toilet paper in the nearest store, so they want to head out and take some friends, see if they can find some somewhere else. Every time we take in someone new, though, I get more and more worried we’ll run out of supplies.”
But Dean stares at the blade he has in his hand after he takes it. He twists it and he admires it, like this is the first time he’s seen it.
He takes some alcohol (actual rubbing alcohol!) from the box, pouring it onto an old rag that used to be flannel.
“Well Linda’s been at it for years,” She laughs, shrugging, “so she’s not having any problems. And Kev’s getting the hang of it. We should watch him, though. It gets loud in that kitchen. Being an empath in those kinds of environments sucks, I can’t imagine being a
I hope you guys enjoyed the first quarter of My Sanctuary. Please, let me know what you thought! Either here or @angelfamilydrama on tumblr, I would love to hear from you!
Instead, he got Cas’ wing immediately pushing up into Dean’s hand, the feather’s ruffling. Cas glares at his offending limb, and Dean realizes the wings have a… mind of their own at times.
His lower lip is bitten to the point of being nearly purple in the dark, and his teeth still dig into it.
“I’m sorry for your loss, Sam. Truly.” Cas says, and he lets out a soft breath. The moment of vulnerability, though, is wiped away as he meets Sam’s eyes again. “But you must understand. Sam, I need to know that I have your utmost respect, trust, and loyalty.”
“That’s… huh. Wow.” Sam blinks, and she turns around. Jack sees her smooth out her skirt at the knees, and they know she’s thinking.
“Seriously, I’m sorry. I’ve just… I’ve been doing this forever. Even before I took over, I was doing maybe half this workload at ten. So…” Cas shrugs.
“Dean, don’t cut them,” Cas says, standing over Dean’s shoulder as Dean holds hair clippers, buzzing, over Claire’s head. Sam and Jack are in the doorway, being a lot less invasive of the moment, but Cas couldn’t care less.
“AM?” Cas’ eyes widen farther and he begins to get up, but Dean presses into the middle of Cas’ back, keeping him there for a moment.
“I don’t particularly know, nor care. Gender has always been a human concept to me. I didn’t even fully understand when I was human myself. It was always this thing that humans created to identify themselves one way or the other. Except, there’s no ‘or’ for me. It’s one and the other, and everything in between and outside of that. But I suppose, yes. If you were to assign me something, genderfluid would work.”
“It’s quiet up there. I have a room here, but I’ve got my own stuff up there, so, if you’d like to come up, I think I’m going to clean a bit. You know, if you’d like to keep me company.”
Sam walks over to them with the coin purse, and he pulls a flattened, oval penny out. He hands it to Jack.
“Yes!” Dean says, and he looks excited, leaning forward in his seat, until his eyes widen and he backs off. “I mean, um, yeah. I’d love that. Thank you, Cas.”
He checks on Claire and they talk a bit, and Claire seems extra prickly. Cas doesn’t prod, though, just gives her a gentle smile and leads her into pleasant conversation.
Jack’s phone lights up in their lap (they don’t like the sound of the beep or the vibrations) and they have a text from Claire.
care, but hey. There’s no reason to not ask, and he’s rewarded(or so Cas thinks, he assumes) with Cas wrapping his arms around Dean’s middle, pressing a kiss into his collarbone. They look like a couple already. Hell, Cas seems to have no inhibitions. Which, is cool and all, for him, but it just means more time like this with Cas.
Jack, who had been practicing with Cas (although Dean didn’t know this at the time), raised his hand and said, “H-Hi… Dean.” Before grinning wide and jumping in his spot a little, tilting his head back at Cas as though to request approval.
“Cas, look!” Jack yells from in front of them, pointing toward a cage. Cas is smiling beside Dean knowingly, like he already knows what Jack is looking at.
“Castiel, what are you doing here? I mean, come in, I just…” he steps back, opening the door further for Castiel.
So Cas’ guests leave. His placeholders, his replacements. They leave, and make way for the original. They make way for the one who took shape in Cas’ heart and left a hole for them to fill.
“I know. And um, how’s everything with…” she makes a face, sticking her hands out and waving them slightly.
He thinks of the brush of Dean’s skin, their hands touching as Dean casually brushed his hand over Cas’ at lunch that day.
That night, all those weeks ago, changed something. It changed the air. Dean’s guilt is so palpable, but it never once gets spoken. He makes up for it with those things he’d denied Cas so long.
Dean looks at Sam beside Jack, absorbed in his phone but also incapable of holding back a smile, just like Cas.
Dean lets out a small huff of laughter, nodding. “That’s good. That you’re taking a break, I mean. ‘S well deserved.”
It’s tender, and their lips barely graze each other’s. It’s soft and it’s loving and Cas tries so hard to throw his everything into it. He tries to do what Dean does so effortlessly; portray exactly what he’s feeling through just one simple action.
He’s well aware things get overwhelming for Cas, so he waits for the other man to make his first move.
“Oh.” Sam lets out another, softer breath, and Castiel very pointedly doesn’t look at him, his eyes fixed on a bedpost across the room. “Cas, I’m so-“
“Of course. It helped me, so.” He smiles lightly. “And yes, I know you’ve had your powers for a while, but everyone’s always improving.”
Because nothing will ever be as addicting to him as the feeling of Dean Winchester surrounding him. Taking in his very essence. Letting in the thing that is now as close to his soul as it can be.
“The middle set, of course, is for flight.” He says quietly, before returning to silence, holding the position with a stiffness Dean hasn’t seen on him in years.
, of all people, reported Dean for anything, that might make him the world’s biggest hypocrite. Incredibly selfish, too. So he shakes his head, before continuing his gentle look, allowing and encouraging Dean to continue.
“Still.” Sam pulls a penny out of the dispense box, holding it up to show Dean with a childlike grin. “I just think they’re neat.”
At first, Sam had been upset that Eileen couldn’t make it, but he knew Eileen liked her independence. So Sammy made his way to the car in a sulk, resolved to teach Jack in his practice: Third Wheeling. All of that is forgotten now, it seems, because he’s looking at the zoo with bright eyes that Dean hasn’t seen in years.
Eyebrows simultaneously rise as people see the stern look on Dean’s face. “I understand if I’m fired, arrested, whatever. I get it. But… In this life, you have to choose something to stand for. You have to choose a line to draw. And this is mine. This is what I choose, and I’ll die for it.”
An hour later, Dean walks out of his room, heading for the common room. Generally he goes there before dinner, watches people, gets a feel for his surroundings. He has no doubt Castiel will find him, since technically they’re… dating?
Dean lets out a light chuckle, watching Cas help Jack take the stuffed animals to the counter. Cas pays for them all, already discussing names with their son as a grin finds its way onto his face.
Cas allows Dean to tilt his head to the right, and their eyes meet. Neither of them break the eye contact, one of Dean’s hands resting on Cas’ thigh, the other on his face.
! Now I am.” Dean says, before sighing. Cas watches the tension leave Dean’s shoulders as Cas steps forward, taking Dean’s hands.
Charlie makes her way back into the living room in a similar fashion as Cas had earlier, her steps careful and her eyes focused on the mugs in her hands. Her lips press into each other, before she bites her lower lip with focus. Finally she reaches the couches, smiling and handing Cas his mug.
A knock cuts him off. At first it’s three raps, urgent, then two soft knocks, as though the person had given up on being stubborn before the door had even been opened.
He doesn’t remember the tears ever ceasing. He doesn’t remember moving. One moment, his tears are soaking into Dean’s shirt and Dean’s are soaking into his. One moment, they’re sitting side by side and clutching into each other desperately.
people use for those with magic. Granted, some people in the magical community are okay with it. But he’s seen one too many people wince at the words that the rule was bound to be instilled.
Cas puts the car in park, just how he’s supposed to, and he gets out. Dean follows, his eyebrows furrowed. Cas gestures for him, smiling.
He sighs, before steeling himself and starting to make his way through the crowd, to where he knows Charlie will be standing.
“No, I guess not. Or at least if you were, I’d hope you’d tell me. I think I’d make a pretty good post-homicide therapist. Or I could at least help bury the body.”
All the while, Dean runs his hands up and down Cas’ back, pressing just hard enough to leave white trails all along the plane of skin and muscle. Dean watches it fade away with a smile when Cas’ head is lowered.
Dean, trying to suck in everything he can get from Cas’ palm. Dean, his eyes closed and his chest rumbling with a soft groan. His legs wrap around Cas’ waist to hold them close together. Pressed together in every way. Physically, emotionally, spiritually.
Gabriel is in the gym, and Cas sees him when he goes to check on the drying floor. Gabriel’s has his wings spread, his back against the wall. He looks down at a ruler, also against the wall, chuckling under his breath like an idiot.
Well that was fun, wasn't it? Talk to me here or @angelfamilydrama on tumblr! I'd love to hear from you, and I hope you enjoyed <3
“It was alright,” Cas says, “I enjoyed it at the time. Although, I’m very comfortable with this body now, I’m not sure if I’d still like it today.”
He hopes Dean takes it for tonight, for their last night together, for every night before that and every night that could have been. He hopes Dean will take it for the future, for every pound of weight that’s added to Dean’s shoulders.
The ache in his chest comes back when he sees Charlie flinch back, and it grows even more when he sees the sad, pity-ridden expression she wears.
“Hiya Cassie. Yes, indeed I am. Eight and a half feet.” Gabriel tucks his wings in, putting his hands on his hips. “Pretty impressive, if I do say so myself.”
Kevin, too. Linda protects him with a passion and both Cas and Kevin adore and admire that. But Kevin, ever since he walked up to Cas and Charlie asking questions about this and that, Kevin’s been sticking around. And yeah, Cas considers him and loves him like a son.
Dean furrows his eyebrows, leaning in close to Cas’ ear and whispering, “what does he mean?” Because, well. He can’t help it. Generally, he’s used to the kid’s randomness, but this one seems to make sense to Cas, so…
“Yeah, yeah, I know. But it gets worse when you’re stressed. If anyone should know, it’s your best friend.” Charlie raises her eyebrows, pointing at herself.
“And how’s Alfie?” Cas asks, walking through the small doorway that connects his kitchen to his living room, holding two mugs filled almost to the brim with coffee.
“I’m glad you’re doing better, Charlie. I’m assuming it’s helping?” He asks, tilting his head slightly.
The thought makes his eyes widen and his eyes shoot up from where they were settled on the cup he was filling.
Dean meets a new girl in The Sanctuary, and discovers a new power he hadn't heard of before that forces him to confront some things he isn't so fond of.
Well then. Some internal Dean for you there. How fun. Anyways, talk to me!! Here, or @angelfamilydrama on tumblr! (Yup I’m gonna say it every time)
Cas shrugs. “I did… a lot of work yesterday. There wasn’t much to do today. Which, wow, that’s the first time I’ve said something like that since I was fifteen years old.”
“No. Don’t tell me he’s a good person.” He turns back to face Sam, his jaw set. “Don’t tell me he means well, or that he wasn’t trying to hurt us. Your brother is a police officer. He threatened me and those I love and protect. Even if he did care, by some miracle, he won’t come back, and he’ll die regretting it.”
Cas comes around Dean’s front again, and his eyes are glowing bright. They’re blue, but so shrouded in light that they almost look white. They flicker, between that and his usual color, but the inherent otherworldliness of it doesn’t escape Dean.
“PM?” Cas asks, eyes wide. Three hours? He’d completely missed dinner, he still had to go check in on Michael and Lucifer, he-
Cas pulls Dean’s shoes and socks off. First the right shoe, followed by the right sock, then repeated on the other side. Cas runs his hands up and down Dean’s calves, before standing up fully, smiling at Dean and kissing him gently as he tosses the shoes aside along with his.
“I understand if you want to leave after hearing that, to be… completely honest with you.” Cas says, offering Dean a kind smile and pulling back the hand that he had forgotten.
He glances around, before rolling up his sleeves, muttering, “okay, I can just…” before walking up to the vacant room nearest him and walking inside.
“What? No, kiddo, why would I be upset? I get it.” Dean’s smiling, but there’s a tightness in it that Cas recognizes. Cas simply nods at Claire, a little subtle thing, before rubbing his hand over Dean’s knee.
Dean’s heart starts to pound and his limbs ache as he makes his way up the steps of the station. He sucks in a long breath, though, and steels his face.
Okay I promise I will stop talking. It's your turn, if you'd like! Please, I'd love to hear from you, I'm sure you know where by now.
He can only reach for the bed stand and hand his blade to Dean. Put his life in Dean Winchester’s hands, yet again. And he can do nothing but smile brightly about it.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean asks in between kisses. He can do so because they’re still slow, luckily. If he’d waited much longer he wasn’t sure he’d have even gotten through the two words before having to return to the warm comfort of Cas’ lips.
Sammy’s healing. He’s doing good. Dean checks in on him every day, and he’s slowly coming to terms with who he is. Eileen is helping. She’s not a monster, so why would
“I like seeing your face.” Dean whispers, cupping Cas’ cheek and lifting his face gently so he can see.
Now, for you guys. I cannot tell you just how grateful I am for every last one of you. When you first clicked on this fic, you stole a tiny piece of my heart. From the silent readers to the ones who would regularly converse with me (you know who you are), I love you all and I am grateful for you.
“Ah.” Gabriel nods knowingly, his voice wise and cool toned, before he broke the ruse, pulling Cas into a headlock and rubbing the top of his head with his knuckles. “So you like Deano!” he laughs, and Cas struggles, pushing against Gabriel and groaning.
Cas shakes his head, smiling. He knows she knows better. He’s been working on eradicating the casual names that, well, that
“Anything else?” Benny asks, and Dean nods, before making a face, clearly realizing that no, Benny cannot see him.
Cas looks at Gabriel, then runs off, answering the phone and shooting out a quick, “One second, let me get to the house, better service there.”
“And does Jody know?” Dean asks as he switches back to his spot, settling into the couch. This is gentle, and he hopes his sympathetic smile speaks for him. He’s never been all that good with words, but his actions have always worked for him.
Cas’ hands, he now realizes, are clenched in the shitty mattress he sits on, his arms straight as a pole beside him.
“What are they all for?” Dean asks, running his hands along the length of the lowest set as far as he could.
No, Dean stays. He stays, and then he leans in, hugging Cas as tightly as he can. It threatens to suffocate Cas, but it’s not really a threat.
Hello! I’ve decided to put the mandatory thanks and long note in the end notes, so I’m going to let you jump right into this! I really do hope you enjoy just as much as I did.
He hops on top of it, before looking around. He can clearly see everyone right now, and god, it hurts.
Dean laughs as he’s pulled through the trees, weaving through them at Cas’ will. Cas knows where he’s going, or so it becomes apparent after a few minutes. He’s going in a very specific pattern, and he knows exactly what he’s looking for.
“Never, not once in a million years, would Cas hurt any one of you unless you threatened his people. If you threatened him, he wouldn’t hurt you. But if you laid a hand on any of those people I mentioned before, even
Cas closes his eyes, though. He breaks the contact for the first time in all their years together. Because he can’t help but tilt his head back and suck in a shaky breath.
“Kaia’s actually been here nine months as of today. She’s doing much better than when she first arrived, and Claire’s definitely been helping.” Charlie sits back in her seat, and Cas watches her, nodding. “She’s happy. They both are. Ever since she and Kaia got together, Claire’s been a lot happier. More content, less… prickly. Less angry for sure.”
“Professionalism, Cas.” He mutters under his breath, shaking his head. And he begins thinking like a
He checks in with a young telekinetic, a 14 year old boy named Daniel. He says when his binder hurts his chest, he loses control of his powers, so Cas sits down with him and researches some new options for binders, as well as time frames for wear to make pain less likely. He also promises to check in on him when he’s on his next rounds. By the end of their session, they’ve found one to order, and Cas does just that. Lucifer will certainly yell at him for the random money loss, but he doesn’t care much for Lucifer’s opinion this way or that.
in you, right? Some of you were just raised in it, and I was too, but you have to understand. If you could meet them, you would… you’d understand. There’s a telepath boy who just likes to cook and read. His name’s Kevin, and while he’s a little bitch, he’s really very kind. And honest to a fault. There’s a man with the power of deception, and he’s an
Finally, Cas’ hand rises from Dean’s back and rests in his hair. It sits there for a second before he takes a hold of it and
Cas never stops touching Dean. Whether it’s a brush of knuckles or pressing his entire body down on Dean’s, he can’t stop.
Dean seems like this is a chore. He’s still soft with Cas, pressing his hands everywhere and exploring with his eyes. But his lips move tiredly. He wants more, yes, but he acts as though it’s not priority number one. Which is, again, new. New and terrifying.
A smile that takes over his whole face, when Cas does something that makes him all the more irresistible.
Dean cuts in here, leaning forward. “You ran an entire bunker full of magical people when you were sixteen?”
“Nothing new to report, really. Castiel… Cas, the plan with him is working. I should have gone into acting, I’m fantastic at improv.”
“In your dreams, Lafitte.” With that, Dean laughs, adding, “Clearly I’m a taken man.” Before hanging up.
They’re moving up, away from the wings, into the sky. As they do so, separating from the wings, they start to fizzle out, like they’ve lost their fuel.
“There’s a girl, too. Her name’s Charlie, and she is a hell of a bitch. I love her, I really do, but she can be terrible sometimes.” Dean laughs. “She’s an empath. She feels everyone’s feelings. Everything you feel, she feels. It all hits her times one thousand, and she can still hold her head up and grin. She plays DND and she can hack into any system with fancy abbreviations out there. She’s wicked smart, in a way that I’ll never be. Probably in a way none of you will ever be, and I mean that with love, but she really is smart.
It’s a while before anyone breaks the silence. Cas doesn’t know what to say, he’s just staring at his children, wishing he knew the acceptable way to respond. He wants to hug them both, to tell Claire that it’s okay, that he’ll never be upset with them, especially not over something like this. No, Dean or Sam are better equipped to handle this.
He’s shaking, and he realizes that he’s crying too. He realizes that he and Dean are sobbing into each other’s shoulders, each clutching the other’s back. It’s a painful hug, literally. But god, isn’t it fitting?
“They’re not, Dean. They’re odd and broken, I can’t even fly with all three anymore, nevertheless my flight set.”
“Thanks kid,” Dean says, and he ruffles their hair. “So, what do you want to be called? Sammy’s a bit invasive but it is a good question.”
Cas thinks about everything he has to do, everything he wants to do. He’s sure Charlie’s feeling it all as he runs through, but he doesn’t care much, she’s definitely used to it.
“Crowley being a little bitch is indeed, not new.” He laughs softly. “Alright, then. What do you want to do?”
Dean breaks it first, shrugging and looking off to his left, toward the doorway. “It’s just my opinion.”
The pounding in his chest is rapid against his ribcage, so hard he can feel it with just a hand on top of the skin.
Kelly is a single mom, about six months pregnant, and Cas takes care of her as though the child is his. (It’s not, but he has a couple sneaking suspicions.)
Claire’s still looking at Dean and Cas, their eyes wide and their brows furrowed deep into each other.
Cas takes his blade from the table and hands it to Dean, putting himself yet again at Dean’s mercy. Even as he feels the light inside him fade. Even as he feels the connection to his home- no, his old home- tug away. Even as his wings go numb, he holds eye contact with Dean, placing the blade in his hand.
Dean tilts his head, still holding his questioning expression as he awaits consent. He doesn’t move away from the wing, either, though.
Dean leans backwards, hands on his lower back. His spine pops pleasantly and he sighs, closing his eyes. “Babe?” He asks, turning around from the mirror to look at Cas, who sits on their bed cross legged with black sweatpants on.
“As I’m sure…” he clears his throat, and for a second he glances at the floor, before returning his gaze to the mass of people, “As I’m sure most of you know, we had an intruder, recently. I’m sorry to say, that… Dean was an undercover cop.”
Claire and Jack (the actual troubled teens, if you ask some people) sit across from them on a black wooden coffee table, their legs folded up underneath them and their hands folded neatly.
With that, the both of them stand up, shooting each other a glance. They begin to make their way through the old house, exiting the living room and finally reaching the small entryway that Cas wouldn’t exactly call a foyer, but also wouldn’t know exactly what else to call it. Cas shoos Charlie off to a corner, before finally starting toward the door, arm outstretched toward the handle.
Cas was the most powerful child in The Sanctuary when he manifested at nine years old. He’s a historically powerful person, but this baby killed his mother when he was born.
Cas’ brain has, essentially, gone blank. There is nothing running his body. Well, nothing other than that godforsaken urge to kiss Dean. And, well, since that’s the only thing running it, of course it wins out.
The smile he smiles when he messes with Cas, one corner higher than the other and his eyes glinting.
It scares him, honestly. Having so many people out there that just know. But at the same time he thinks it’s great. If someone needs help, if they’re having troubles with their very existence being illegal, Castiel will always help.
It makes Cas painfully aware of the other hand. The right hand. The hand that, all those years ago, had (sort of) burnt a print into Dean’s left shoulder. That hand now digs into Dean’s back, only easing up when Dean pulls away from his other hand.
“You’re dating the leader of the organization we’re tearing down. I’m actually required by law to fuck with you about it.”
He speeds up just a little bit, but not by much, and pretty soon he’s turning into the Kansas City Zoo. It’d been a bit of a drive, but nothing like the ones he’s taken before, so it’s no issue of his.
It’s not like he needs a house, to be honest. Who wants that when they’ve got an underground bunker that rivals the size of the largest mansions in the world?
Dean shoots a glare over his shoulder. His leg is up, his foot on the bed as he straps his thigh holster on. “I don’t know if I’ll need it.”
Dean steps forward, taking hold of the top set of wings and prying them away from Cas’ face. It doesn’t take much work at all, and Cas meets Dean with no resistance.
Dean doesn’t even get a chance to hear him. John is making his way to Dean with a hand raised, but Jody and Donna are between him and Dean within moments.
Cas keeps going until finally he sighs, closing his eyes. “Sorry, you said hang out. And I’m thinking about all the work I have to do.” He says, opening his eyes and sitting up out of the slouch he had entered at… some point.
He hands the owl to Dean. “This one’s my favorite… but I got a dolphin. So you get this one! The wings are just like Cas’... I thought you’d like it.”
Cas moves his arm, settling it above his head and looking at Dean. “What are you doing up at this hour, Dean?”
Gabriel pauses, seemingly concerned. “Did he do something? Something to you?” Cas looks over at him with wide eyes and Gabriel holds his gaze.
“Could I do that someday?” Jack asks. It’s not that Jack necessarily wanted to be a girl, but the option wouldn’t hurt.
“Dean, it’s fine. Don’t worry about me.” Cas plasters on a smile, tilting his head up and kissing Dean lightly. This one is empty, out of it, but Dean accepts it.
“Pretty sure. I’ll go out and meditate on that.” Charlie’s lips quirk up in a smile, and Cas’, despite himself, do too.
“Cas, please.” Dean says. “C’mon, let me help you, at least. You’ll get everything done in half time. So let’s make a list, at the beginning of the day. Ten things max in the beginning, and I’ll help you. And when you’re done, you can make rounds, or you can be done for the day, okay?”
“A slow takedown. Get Ca-Castiel out first, it’ll go down in hours. He’s the glue.” Dean picks at his nails, thinking. “Lucifer, Michael next. You already have someone in custody. Name’s Alfie.”
. It took me a long time to realize that. Longer than it should have, but I did in the end. They have feelings. They’re solid, emotional people and they’re being repressed. Pushed into the ground.”
Cas kisses Dean Winchester, and he kisses him like it’s the last time. Like Dean may never let him again.
Thanks for reading, m’loves! I hope you enjoyed, let me know what you thought! You can also find me on tumblr @angelfamilydrama
Cas eventually settles into the kiss, his hands clutching the front of Dean’s shirt desperately. Dean leans back, his arms supporting him from behind. Dean kisses him with a passion that Cas easily reciprocates and raises, and the sparks in Cas’ soul light aflame.
Cas decided to take the kid in. Dean wasn’t allowed to touch him for years. When Jack was two years old, though, Dean was finally allowed to pick up his son.
He wakes up late, yes, but they’ve both been acting like he hasn’t been crashing into their bed at 1am.
He couldn’t bear to feel one more person reach out to touch him, or hear their concerned tones, or see their sad faces.
“What? No, no, Gabriel, he’s fine. He’s… perfect, actually.” Cas shrugs, looking down at the floor as they walk, now in the hallway.
“Yeah. I’m just, um… I wanted to say I’m sorry. For everything that’s happened this past month or two, I’ve bee-”
It’d be too good to be true, of course. Once his grace is gone, once Dean takes the very last bit, Cas will be just like everything else. Nothing left to give Dean.
Ever since he met Cas, he’s been humanizing him. Every time he calls him Cas, the Angel inside falls away to just this… this person. Human. Like a best friend he grew up with, a man he’d see at the movies or chat with in a coffee shop.
Dean opens his mouth, and he sucks in a breath, and Cas braces himself. His shoulders tense and he can feel his heart pick up in beat.
Cas gives him a long look, then pushes his mug across the glass table. “I would like a refill, please.”
I’ll write until the words leave — or my husband starts threatening to. Sometimes I’m up all night with a story and sometimes every word is exhausting.
Dean rushes to change into his hot-date underwear and kneel next to the couch in the time it takes Cas to walk from next door. Cas lets himself in as always, but he pauses when he sees Dean waiting on his knees.
Cas approaches, leaving the cane behind, and gently takes Dean’s face into his hands. “Do you need the cane now, or can it wait until after dinner?”
Cas gives him a final lingering kiss, then pulls back to dispose of the condom before draping himself over Dean’s chest, uncaring of the mess. He kisses just over Dean’s pulsepoint, and he must be able to hear the thunder of Dean’s heart, even when he tucks into the crook of Dean’s neck.
Cas leans down to kiss Dean, tongue tracing the same path as the crop across Dean’s mouth. When they part, he stares into Dean’s eyes for a long moment before he asks, “Choking?”
Castiel shushes him, tells him he won’t remember anyway. This seems to upset Dean even more: he doesn’t want to forget. “I love you,” he whispers. He’s never said it to Castiel before.
cas has really rough social anxiety and can only go to the store in the middle of the night when there aren’t so many people
No. I might need some help tho if you wanted. I haven’t scened with anyone since you and it’s getting to me
: in the middle of having sex for the first time, dean realizes cas isn't enjoying it. he makes them stop and talk about, cas breaks down
“Our friendship is—different,” Cas says. He hurries to fill the moment of silence after that with, “But you’re right. We could.”
I’ve noticed a very clear difference between the majority of your social media accounts and the ‘roguecjmilton’ Twitter. Namely, there’s significantly less of your husband and kitten on the others.
Dean has to physically bite his tongue to keep from protesting, but he can feel himself blushing red down to his chest.
And their fearless leader, Dean, whose presence has Cas’s borrowed body reacting in ways he could not predict. Cas tried to ask Jimmy about it – it’s Jimmy’s DNA, after all, so maybe he had some insight – but Jimmy blushes crimson and changes the subject so rapidly it makes Cas’s head spin.
Cas relaxes by the time their food arrives, back to his usual quiet smiles and dry jokes and complete obliviousness to Dean’s attempts at flirting. Which is probably for the best, because Dean is clumsy and stupid around good-looking men, even more so with Cas, who is so gorgeous it hurts. Dean is desperate to know what his scent is like underneath the heavy spray of blockers he covers himself in. Dean is a creep because he thinks he might get to find out when they settle in for bed.
Cas rolls his eyes as he sits up, but he does as requested. Dean greedily takes in his hipbones, his thighs, the jut of his cock with the barest swelling at the base. Dean licks his lips and says, “Or…”
“Cas, buddy,” Dean says, flopping in a chair next to the bed. “We’re not finding anything. But I’m going to get you out of this, ok?”
about being at Cas’s feet, even just sitting. Dean half-hopes Cas will feed him, too, but he ends up balancing his plate on his knee to eat instead. They talk and laugh like always, but it’s charged a little with Cas smiling down at him from above and not slightly below. Dean can’t stop thinking about the cane waiting in his kitchen.
Cas looks startled, but they reach the front desk before he can respond. “Hey,” Dean says, flashing a smile to the redheaded beta behind the counter. “We’re with 42Star. A couple of rooms for Winchester and Novak.”
so he’s always taking care of his friends, but—well, he doesn’t jump up from the couch because Charlie’s beer is almost empty. That question helped guide a lot of the way he acts around Cas:
Including John and Jimmy’s uncle/legal guardian, who did strangely stop roughing him up quite so much several months prior.
The hits are muffled a bit by the cloth, but Cas rains down blows without mercy until Dean’s chest is heaving for breath and tears are staining the couch. Pain is different like this. It’s bright but not blinding; warm but not scorching. It’s bliss like no other, and Dean finds himself hoping it’ll go on for hours.
Castiel’s voice is grave, because he never knows when someone is making a joke. “No, of course not.”
“You better be,” Cas says, pulling off his t-shirt and throwing it at Dean’s face. Dean tosses it towards the hamper and misses, but then he’s got a faceful of Cas’s sleep pants, too.
Cas pauses the video, trying not to look guilty or embarrassed. “I was trying to understand the appeal.”
“Honey, you’re in trouble,” Cas says with an answering grin, stalking up to Dean and pulling him into a searing kiss.
The second time, Dean is back on the bicycle of deepthroating, taking all of Cas with practiced ease, no gagging even when Cas puts his hands in Dean’s hair and holds him there until Dean goes a little dizzy with need for air. Despite Cas’s iron grip on the back of his head, Dean manages to pull off and says, chin tilted up, “Come on my face, Cas.”
He opens the box, and inside is a collar, leather such a dark brown as to almost look black, with brass hardware.
Cas rolls onto his side to pull Dean close and starts to run fingers through his hair. Dean’s a little surprised by it—he’s not sure why he needs aftercare over a massage—but isn’t going to ruin it by pointing that out.
Cas looks down at him. There’s a brief softness that passes through his eyes, just like always when Dean kneels for him, and then he furrows his brow. “Dean?”
“No,” Dean says, muffled in the bedding. “I can’t believe they let those misomegist pieces of shit get away with those questions.”
, his thoughts repeat. Just scratching itches, nothing personal. The glow Dean had been basking in dims.
Dean hands over the cane and goes to put the asparagus in the oven. He can’t stand the stuff, but Cas is into it so he usually makes it along with salmon anyway. “Are you keepin’ secrets from us, Castiel?”
“Hands and knees,” Cas says. Dean shuffles to get unresponsive limbs underneath him, but he manages. The new position makes his skin pull in different ways, pain flaring from the welts and bruises down his backside. “Touch yourself. I want you to come.”
It’s a beautiful day, so Dean lets the dog outside to lay in the sun while he goes through his Saturday morning cleaning routine. Once he finishes the kitchen, he glances out the back door to see how Indy is doing, and — she’s gone.
Dean tilts his head up. Their mouths are close, enough that Dean can see the faintest white line of a scar just over Cas’s top lip. Just as Cas starts to close the distance between them, Dean’s alarm begins its morning shrieking.
“Well, you know. Omegas are over-emotional.” Dean turns his head so Cas can see his grin. “I like when you get feisty.”
Dean scowls and Cas glares, but they break into a laugh at the same time. When it dies off, Dean says, “So what was last night about?”
they both sneak glances at each other. trenchcoat, along with green eyes, have become the most interesting thing on your commute.
“Because I—I—” Dean goes to his knees, more a collapse than a kneel, though he doesn’t feel the jar of the hard floor vibrate up his thighs. “I can be better. Just tell me what to do.”
“I know,” Cas says. “You’re one of the smartest people I know, actually. But sometimes I wonder—what are you even getting out of this?”
They cuddle together until Dean’s stomach gives an enormous rumble. They eat, and they watch bad tv, and Dean goes home to sleep alone.
“Apparently.” Cas sits up and stretches his arms over his head. Dean’s mouth goes dry at the enticing flex of his upper arms and shoulders, but he turns away quickly, dragging himself to the en suite.
“All right,” Cas says, taking another sip of his beer. “Point stands: better than your tacky boxers.”
Peering close at the canvas, biting his lip in concentration, Dean remembers that Cas used to be a client. It seems fucking ridiculous that Cas used to pay Dean for what he gives eagerly, and now he’s staying up too late to work on a painting so every intricate detail is as perfect as possible with Dean’s level of skill. Which he’s suddenly wishing he had more of, just for this one stupid painting for a dom that used to be a client.
Cas sits at the kitchen island while Dean starts pulling out ingredients. A weird silence descends for a few minutes—Dean half-wonders if Cas is the kind of Dom that prefers his subs silent—but then Cas says, “Charlie mentioned the two of you were LARPing last weekend.”
Instead of offering up his hand, Cas tilts his head to bare his throat, holding Dean’s gaze as he does it. Dean wants to play it cool, but he knows that the rush of his pleased and
“Dean.” Cas takes another one of those deep gathering-resolve breaths. “Last night was different. It was—”
He promised Charlie he would go on at least three dates, so here he is, waiting at a burger place for Number Three, who looked a little awkward in his pictures but seemed nice enough, and he didn’t mention Dean being a cecaelia at all.
There’s an angel waiting for him. Castiel, with bright blue eyes and mahogany hair and huge black wings. He’s a warrior, he tells Dean, but all angels pay their dues introducing new people to Heaven.
Cas slaps Dean’s hand away with the crop, and then—deliciously harder—brings it down on the head of his cock.
Still, when Dean strokes himself in the shower, the first thing he thinks of is Cas’s clever hands. Pretty hands with long, delicate fingers, pretty hands that have turned Dean into a sobbing mess with pain but still manage to touch him tenderly. There are other ways he could turn Dean into a sobbing mess, and Dean imagines it now, Cas’s fingers sliding in deep while he whispers
Cas rolls out from under Dean’s arm to stretch, the sheet pooling around his hips as he arches his back. He gives Dean a sly smile when he catches him watching, but Dean just rolls his eyes.
“We’ve watched fifteen seasons of Dr. Sexy together twice and you never guessed? I think that’s on you.”
Maybe Dean’s just bored in general. Every day feels like a repeat of the last; he feels like he can’t escape Tuesdays and never quite got the hang of Thursdays. He spends 105 hours praying for the weekend and then 55 hours not knowing what to do with himself. He feels like he’s seen everything there is to see on tv, even his favorites stale. It feels like there are no good books left. Thanks to some bacterial infestation, the lake isn’t swimmable.
Dean follows the commands without the conscious decision to. If it were anyone but Cas, it would scare him how quickly he is to respond, how deep he can go. But he knows he can trust Cas to ease him back to the surface.
“I would like to offer you a proposal,” Castiel says. After a beat of silence: “Though, to be honest, it didn’t go very well the last time I did this.”
Sam knows. One time they came up with this hare-brained plan for him to morph a fucking Yeerk (Meg, actually) and take control of Cas in order to get them through new Pool security. Neither of them had realized that Sam would, of course, be privy to Cas’s consciousness the same way a regular Yeerk invader would.
It seems like it takes a long time before Cas joins him, but Dean would wait forever, no matter how much the hard floor makes his knees ache. Dean keeps his gaze down as Cas finally approaches, but he can
“I’d like to use my belt, if that’s ok with you.” His voice is calm, but Dean spots a slight tremor in his hand as he reaches out to cup Dean’s jaw in one of his warm palms. “And I’d like you to look at me.”
Dean laughs and stands on shaking limbs. “Me too, actually. I was going to make ‘Steve’ give me a break in an hour to shove some food in my face.”
Cas is silent in the elevator and the walk down an endless hallway to their room. He takes three tries to get the door open, and then they’re walking into a nice little suite with a king bed taking up half the room. There’s a chair but no couch.
Dean pauses outside the door to Cas’s closet. As familiar as Cas’s home is, Dean’s never been rummaging in his closet, and it feels like both a thrill and a violation. In the end there’s not much rummaging anyway—Dean spots the cane right away, and then he’s rushing out the back door with it and back across the lawn.
there are at least three more chapters, but no timeline for finishing/posting. sometime in my lifetime, presumably.
“Really,” Cas says, and then it’s just the sound of their mouths meeting and Cas’s fingers working in and out of him, the sound of his wetness obscene. Dean’s keyed up enough that just that alone tugs him closer to orgasm.
“Yeah. I mean, it’s not any good —” Cas’s hard look cuts him off. “I know, sorry,” Dean says, flushing. “Do you want to see it?”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas says, like he always does when Dean makes a request, like he always does when Dean needs something. And Dean fucking needs.
The bus slows to a halt, but Dean hesitates before standing. “I’m serious about hanging out sometime. If you want.”
When he did forget himself and jump up just because Cas needed a refill, Dean pretended he needed the restroom or a glass of water, and does Cas need anything while he’s up?
Dean’s Heaven is all endless stretches of highway, mountains up ahead but never reached, diners with amazing pie and dingy hotel rooms on the side of the road. Cas rides in the passenger seat of the Impala in between battles and they eat pie and sometimes lay in the grass, just staring up at the night sky, making up constellations together.
Dean tastes like bitter wine but his kisses and touches are so sweet. Cas wonders if Dean kissed like this in high school, or if it was later when he learned how to make his partner vibrate with wanting without touching anything but mouths and hair.
The message from ten minutes ago is a picture of Cas and Greebo, Cas’s face only half in the frame to center the ever-growing kitten. Dean can admit that Greebo is pretty cute for a cat, but it’s Cas he’s looking at, his grey eye glinting in the sun from the picture window in his office, his hair unruly, his mouth tilted up into a small smile.
Something about Cas’s flippant tone makes Dean bark out a laugh and then say, “Fine, Mr. Chopsticks Savant. Teach me.”
The first one wasn’t even a question. “It must be difficult to work in a technology field when omegas are empirically proven to be worse in STEM subjects. I’m sure it’s discouraging to know your options for advancement are limited by your gender.”
Cas gives Dean a warning look and then steps back, eyeing him up and down. “Bed, please. Clothes off, on your back. Make yourself hard for me while I get something from my house.”
Dean grabs Cas’s hand and leads him inside to the bedroom. Cas doesn’t believe in making his bed, but the blankets and sheets are more chaotic than usual, mostly just a tangle at the bottom of the bed. Dean squeezes Cas’s hand reflexively and asks, “Rough night?”
“Something happened with Cas,” Dean says, trying to sound sad. Like maybe he told Cas about his feelings and was rejected just like he’s always feared.
Cas is watching a little more intently than necessary. He licks, swallows, and sucks next, grimacing.
Dean told Cas just last week that they should make a cardboard palace for Greebo, and this is just more evidence for the genius of the idea.
When Dean wakes, it’s to paramedics surrounding him, the worst pain he’s ever felt, and loss itching at the back of his mind.
“Guess that ship has sailed,” Dean says. It barely hurts, because he locked away whatever feelings for Cas he started to have months ago. A Russian doll of locked treasure chests, ensuring they never escape.
Dean flashes Cas a smile and tries not to blush under Cas’s watchful eyes as he dresses in a pair of purple lace panties and his civvies. “Where to, sir?” Dean says, shoving his feet in his boots.
Dean pulls a little tube and lighter out of his pocket and presents them to Cas with a flourish. Cas gives Dean that big, gummy smile he loves so much, and opens up the tube to shake out the carefully-rolled joint into his palm. “You spoil me.”
Dean swallows and nods, but his entire focus is on Cas’s other hand, sliding from the small of his back up to his hair. Cas kisses the back of Dean’s neck, softly, then drags him to the bed and shoves him chest-down over it, ass canted into the air.
The next round of hits criss-cross over existing burning lines across Dean’s ass and thighs, and the pain is
“If you ignored the cat memes to be more productive, then you wouldn’t have to stay late so often. You could be here with me.”
Dean takes his time smoothing his hands over Cas’s shoulders and down his back, following with his mouth. Cas is all hard muscle flexing under golden skin, a soft gasp dropping from his lips as Dean kisses the base of his spine. Dean gives Cas’s ass a quick squeeze before pulling back to rid himself of his own sweatpants and boxers before he makes an even bigger mess of them.
Dean sits back on his heels, giving himself a few strokes while admiring the way Cas is so wet and soft that he could probably take a cock with hardly any effort. Not for the first time, Dean wonders if this is what it feels like to be an alpha — powerful in the way his omega presents to him, the way his omega pants and shivers after he’s accepted pleasure. Dean could sit and stare at him all night.
“That’s true,” Cas says. His hand twitches, scratching at nothing on the thigh of his jeans. “I — need to tell you something.”
The last four hours of Dean’s shift are blocked off for a new client. That’s either awesome or shitty, no inbetween. After reviewing the client’s profile again, he decides it’s going to be pretty shitty. It’s going to be rough and exhausting and Dean might end up popping ibuprofen like candy the next couple of days, when all he really wants is to make Cas dinner and make him smile.
He thinks it should feel awkward, jerking off while Cas just watches, unaffected, but somehow that makes it even more thrilling. He keeps his eyes on Cas, even while he moans and tilts his head back as the heat spreads outwards from his groin.
Cas starts to get tense again as they head back to the hotel with aching feet and sun-pink cheeks. Dean doesn’t ask, even as Cas’s jaw clenches on the elevator ride up to their hotel room.
I didn’t sign up as a writer to teach people anything. I like to tell stories. What people get out of it is up to them.
The Monday after their getaway, it’s past midnight and Dean is staring at Cas’s painting. He thinks it might be finished. Or maybe not. Maybe he needs another few weeks to try to correct some of the mistakes. It was dumb of him to take on something that feels so important, but in the end, he decides he’s done it: the angel has been chiseled free and stands defiant in dark paint, a warrior hiding a gentle soul behind razor-edged feathers.
Can’t believe I had to find out from OUR WEED DEALER that you and Cas finally got it together!!!!!! Omg I hate you I’m so happy for you
Just when Cas is about to make another snarky comment, Dean spreads his hands across the top of Cas’s shoulders. The oil makes Cas’s skin shine in a distracting way, but Dean forces himself to focus, gently prodding to find the knots. There’s not a lot of them—probably all that yoga—but Cas groans when Dean circles his thumbs over one of them.
A thunk as the paddle falls onto the counter, and then Cas is leaning over to kiss Dean’s temple, cheek, the corner of his mouth. “My good boy. Don’t apologize.” He strokes his fingers gently through Dean’s hair and asks, “Can you stand? I want to get you cleaned up and into bed for a bit of hardcore cuddling.”
When Dean welcomes him back in, it’s to wrap his arms around Castiel and cry and say how much he missed him. Dean’s tears do not come lightly; Castiel knows this.
Dean’s face burns hotter but he gets up, back into the chair, staring at the food so he doesn’t have to look at Cas.
Dean licks salt off the back of his hand, tosses back the shot, and then sinks his teeth into a lime. The gold tequila sits warm in his belly and the lime sits sour on his tongue.
Dean stares at him, like waiting for a punchline, and then says, “Yeah, I guess so. I live pretty close if you want…?”
Castiel isn’t used to appearing human and he doesn’t know how to control his vessel, doesn’t know how to hide the affection in his gaze or the way he hugs Dean, openly, when they meet after a long time away. One day, Dean reaches across the seat and puts his hand in Castiel’s and they drive all day like that, just a comfort-touch between them.
The sun is warm and they lay perpendicular on the dock, Cas’s head pillowed on Dean’s stomach and Dean’s on a foam float. Everything feels still and calm, surrounded by the sound of birdsong, the occasional splash of a fish in the lake, leaves rustling together. Dean’s stomach rises and falls with his breath and he pets Cas’s hair absently.
Cas pauses to slip the end of the crop through the precome puddling on Dean’s stomach, then he lifts it to run across the seam of Dean’s lips. Dean parts them to taste the must of leather and salt of his own wanting and Cas gives a pleased little hum.
Cas’s smile is a little shaky, like he truly believed Dean might say no. Like he doubts that Dean has dreamed about this. Slowly, Cas opens the box again, and very carefully takes out the collar to buckle it around Dean’s neck.
Toothbrush in his mouth, Dean wonders if the almost-kiss was just the kind of moment that accidentally happens when everything is hushed and soft in the early morning or if a second chance will come around. He lets himself hope.
Dean is… a little mixed up. He always though Jimmy was pretty cute, but Jimmy was smack in between Dean and Sam in school and Dean could never come up with a good reason to interact with him until the whole aliens-taking-over-the-planet thing, and now an alien is wearing Jimmy’s pretty-cute face, and despite Dean’s better judgment, he’s kind of really digging the alien, too.
“Really?” Dean says, tossing them at the hamper and missing for the second time. When he focuses on Cas again, his breath catches.
It’s probably for the best that another panelist was quicker to the mic than Dean and Cas, or Dean may never be invited to speak publicly again. “I’m not sure if you’ve heard of Bela Talbot,” the other panelist said, knowing very well that all of them had, “but she’s an omega who will achieve the first commercial manned space flight while Elon Musk is still trying to keep his rockets from exploding at launch.”

Dean could say all that. He has an inkling Cas has never been told what a good Dom he is before and he can picture the way Cas would fail at holding down a smile to hear it. But Dean can picture the other things that might tumble out of his mouth along with, and he knows Cas would flinch away from Dean’s true feelings. Dean’s pathetic attachment to him.
Cas meets Dean’s ridiculously dramatic car and then his wonderfully cozy home. At the end of the night — or the beginning of the morning — Dean says, “I’m not completely sold on the kissing thing, but would it be cool if I hugged you?”
“Nice,” Cas says, nodding at the mug. “I would say you could put a cat palace in your house, but you’re not allowed to have him over again.”
Dean looks up immediately, breath catching at the sight of Cas looming over him, head tilted as he examines Dean. Dean swallows and says, “Yeah, that’s good.”
Ash hooked up with one of the zookeepers at the Kansas City Zoo and manages to sneak them in to acquire their first morphs, Cas wearing Jimmy’s face as they sneak from exhibit to exhibit.
His whole life, he’ll dream of what it felt like to end her, the way bodies sound when they hit the ground.
Dean turns his phone over on the table, and then again, like a nervous tic. “Like I said, I didn’t mean to lead you on. "I'm uh. Also ace.”
After I finish each book, I consider applying at McDonald’s. But really, I pay my bills doing something I love that I couldn’t
Dean scoots a little closer and leans in, just nuzzling against Cas’s neck at first. He smells incredible, like a yellow-skyed April, and Dean wants to bury himself there forever. Cas makes a soft noise in the back of his throat like he wants Dean there, too.
Dean drinks his beer. Watches Bobby Flay for a minute, shoulders still a little hunched, not sure what to say. “What happened with Meg?”
Dean doesn’t want it to stop. He wants to go down, under, blackout, bruises around his neck, but Cas lets him breathe as the final spurt of come coats his fingers.
Cas wants to tell Dean to fuck off. Wants to wallow in drugs and anxiety instead of love, because it’s easier to be sad than to belong. He takes a deep breath and makes himself say, “Thank you.”
Cas is a runner and catches up, then passes, Dean to bound up the porch stairs and fling open the door. Their boots pound across the hardwood floors, and in the bedroom, Cas grabs Dean and spins him around to shove him into the bed. Cas climbs on top of him, both of them breathing hard and laughing.
for the anon prompt "two gray ace characters are dating and one of them develops sexual attraction towards the other but the other isn't there yet (and maybe won't ever be)"
Dean settles on the floor on the pillow that is always waiting for him there and accepts the pipe when Cas hands it over. He takes a long hit, holds it until his lungs start to protest. Things are always a little soft around the edges when he’s at Cas’s feet, but the weed hits him hard and fast and he sinks deeper.
Dean really hit the jackpot when it comes to being Cas’s roommate. He doesn’t make Dean listen to him fucking people all the time; he can’t cook for shit but always offers to clean up after dinner; he doesn’t wake Dean up at crazy hours or make the whole place smell like popcorn day and night.
Cas nods and keeps running his fingers through Dean’s hair until he manages to get himself upright on shaking legs. “Dammit,” he says, looking down at his jeans pooling around the top of his boots.
In the end, Castiel convinces Dean. Dean will be back, Castiel says, in another thirty or forty or fifty years, and Castiel will be waiting.
Cas reaches out and brushes his fingertips along Dean’s jaw, almost like he’s not sure Dean is real. Dean knows the feeling and turns his head to nuzzle against Cas’s palm, hoping the touch of his submissive will help ground Cas again.
on the way to meeting Dean at a comedy club. That phone call was the scariest moment of Dean’s life.
Cas snorts and kneels to untie and tug off Dean’s shoes. Dean’s no help at all, just staring at Cas below him. Cas, submissive on his knees. No—Cas, on his knees but still all Dom, because Cas doesn’t have to put on some performance of Domination, like all it takes is macho posturing to be good for a submissive. Even if it weren’t for the tell-tale grey eye, he just radiates it. He’s nerdy and loves cats and cries when the love of Dr. Steamy’s life dies on Dr. Sexy and bends at Dean’s knees to help him take off his shoes, but he’s still the most
Cas smiles. “Good, because I’ve got the embarrassing giving-praise kink. It’s always been easy with you.”
“I’m sorry, sir, we’re booked. I can check with the other locations nearby, but considering the festival...”
Dean likes kissing, and Cas is a good kisser, so he’s more than content to just make out against the side of the bed for awhile, Cas’s shoulder and neck and cheek warm under Dean’s palm. Cas is the one who slides his hand under Dean’s t-shirt, huge and rough — Dean wants to know all his stories, how an algorithm guy earned his callouses — and leaving shivers in its wake. Dean can smell his own arousal on the air as much as Cas’s and it’s a thrill just like always, someone blooming for him. It’s even better with another omega, though Dean doesn’t generally admit to being anything but a three on both axes of the Kinsey scale.
Cas sits up and gives Dean a smile far too wide for someone who’s been comatose for months, but Dean falls into it like he always does.
The back door opens and Dean jumps, turning off his phone screen like he has something to be guilty about. Cas says, “Somehow I’m out of beer. Can I borrow some of yours?”
Cas doesn’t ask Dean to kneel. The rest of Sunday morning coffee is just like it always is—except something unnameable is different. A low-frequency hum between them, pulling Dean to Cas and tying him there in soft rope.
Cas doesn’t make him wait long. He looks over Dean as he approaches, the cane light in his hands, but it’s not the kind of look Dean is used to when he’s laid out bare for the taking. Cas is still devouring him, but in a subtly different way than previous Doms—it’s something about the way his eyes don’t pause at Dean’s ass, like each inch of him is equally delectable, not just the parts that lead to orgasms.
The pain is an awful—wonderful—thud mixed with a whistling-sharp smack. By the third hit, Dean knows his ass is going to be polka-dotted from the holes drilled in the wooden paddle.
Dean manages to wait until they walk into the house before he says, “Are you fucking kidding me, Cas?”
“You were supposed to be at Meg’s!” Dean says, a little shrill, because it’s the first thing that comes out of his mouth. He fumbles for a pillow and manages to cover the pink satin and lace on his crotch, but that doesn’t do much for the bra thing on top. He tries to cross one of his arms across his chest, but that’s not helping either.
“Mmhmm. You’re never catsitting again.” The cane comes down hard across the back of Dean’s thighs, and suddenly he’s aware of his cock starting to harden between his stomach and the comforter. Like Cas can tell, he asks, “Is that better for you, honey?”
“Absolutely not. This is going in my living room so I can brag to anyone who will listen about how talented and kind my sub is.”
Cas pulls off Dean’s socks and sharply smacks the bottom of one of his feet. Dean squeaks and jerks and Cas laughs. “See what happens when you’re a brat?”
Dean nods and Cas’s eyes narrow, head tilted as he considers what to do with him. Dean will take anything. “I hurt you earlier,” Cas says, “I should make up for that.”
Dean grimaces. “Point taken. This one’s only empty because of me,” he says, wiggling a tentacle at him.
Jimmy has imagined riding in the front seat of Dean’s monstrous car, though never with Sam ducking in between them from the back seat, pointing into a construction lot. “Did you see that? What the hell was that?”
Dean blushes but still rolls his eyes. “You caught me. I’ve got that embarrassing praise kink thing.”
Cas is awake but sluggish by the time Dean finishes his head-to-toe massage, and he gives Dean a goofy-soft smile as Dean lays down next to him. “Good?” Dean asks.
Dean feels it the moment before Cas’s magic explodes. He manages to raise his hands before the house — the entire goddamn
Cas is standing by the couch with the remote in his hand. Dean pauses in the threshold between kitchen and living room but Cas glances over before Dean gets to stare at him too long: hair breeze-swept from an afternoon by the pool, grey eye glowing in the light from the tv, mouth pink and plush.
The pause lasts forever and Dean chugs beer, hoping the alcohol will clear the cobwebs in his brain. He wants to ask Cas to say it again, just so he can savor it, just so he can jerk off thinking about it.
“I think I’ll let it go this time,” Cas says. “But I do prefer you don’t lie to me. I already know you’re a huge nerd anyway.”
Cas is dying. His heart is pounding a galloping staccato, or maybe it’s not beating at all, and his lungs have closed like a vise. He hiccups around an attempt at breathing, thoughts spinning and spinning and spinning —
“Nah,” Dean says. “It really is stupid.” He does something he’s never done on the bus before, holding out his hand in the human custom. “I’m Dean.”
“Fuck this,” Dean says for the upteenth time, shoving another book with another worthless antidote away.
Dean’s eyes go to the ground as soon as they walk in. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the hostess grabbing a couple of menus. “One dom, one sub today, sir?”
“There are a lot of mistakes,” Dean says, shrugging. “Maybe I can do something better now. But I worked hard on this. Wanted to make it right for you.”
“It’s ok,” Dean says. It is. No one has done this to him since back when he got picked up on streetcorners for a couple bucks, but being marked by Cas feels… right. It’s like the handprint never left.
Cas is really good at hurting Dean like this, and Dean is really good at taking—loving—it. Dean wears the bruises with pleasure, a secret between him and his Dom, and he knows these will be deep purple by morning. It doesn’t take long to get him drifting into the atmosphere, fingers clenched around the edge of the wood slab countertop on instinct to keep him from collapsing to the floor. He knows Cas asks his color again, and he knows he answers
“Dude, I’ll give you my number. In case you want to geek out with someone who won’t understand most of it.”
He doesn’t expect Cas to respond, but he sits there in silence for awhile anyway, just staring at the wall above Cas’s inert body.
He could call Bela. He could call Ash. He could see if Aaron’s in town. He can’t even think of any good reason not to, but he still finds himself texting Cas instead.
The angel has been chiseled free and stands defiant in dark paint, a warrior hiding a gentle soul behind razor-edged feathers.
Cas doesn’t really believe him, doesn’t relax until he’s gently cleaned Dean up with a washcloth until all traces are gone.
Still kneeling, Cas tugs down Dean’s boxers so he can leave them in a puddle on the floor along with his jeans. Dean’s steadier than he lets on, selfishly enjoying Cas’s arm around him as they make their way to the master bathroom.
“Bed,” Dean agrees, bad knee cracking as he stumbles to his feet and then falls backwards into the sheets, grinning at a rather disheveled Cas.
The crinkles around Cas’s eyes might as well be laughter, and Dean says, “Shut up,” but then, “You too. You know that, right?”
[laughing] That would be impossible. Writers are fickle, but readers moreso. I never know which books will land well, but to be frank, I don’t care. The worst thing an artist can do is create to impress other people.
“Dean,” the guy says, like he’s tasting the shape of it. He takes Dean’s hand and gives it a quick shake. “I’m Castiel. We’re well met.”
After a final kiss to the soft round of Dean’s ass, Cas spreads his cheeks and runs the hot-wet of his tongue over Dean’s hole. Dean gasps, and soon he’s clenching fists into the quilt for an entirely different reason, whimpering and moaning as Cas licks him open slow and thorough.
Slowly like the ebbing tide, Dean comes back to himself. His pillow is cool under his cheek. Cas is sitting on the bed next to him, stroking his hair and murmuring.
Jimmy is kind and funny and flamboyant after a couple of beers or a joint, and Cas is serious and literal and accidentally hilarious pretty much all the time, and they wear their identical bodies completely differently and Dean thinks he should probably make a choice and stop flirting so hard with aliens who don’t grok his innuendo and boys who flush so pretty when they do, but he’s never been particularly good at denying himself things he wants so he just… enjoys what he has, and ignores Sam’s disgusted eye rolls every time he references his dick in front of Jimmy or Cas.
I’m sorry to break this to the critics, but queer people exist, and we deserve to exist in stories, too. We deserve to be visible.
Cas kisses the round of Dean’s shoulder. Dean’s purrs intensify and he gives Cas a smile, weirdly shy considering what they were just doing. To cover it up, Dean says, “I can’t believe I ended up in the wet spot.”
Cas nudges Dean off his shoulder and then leans to grab Dean’s stash from the side table drawer. Dean watches Cas’s hands as he packs the pipe, thinking about all the places he’s been touched by them now.
Carefully, Cas takes the canvas from Dean to set it up against the wall, just so he can throw his arms around him and hug him tight. “Thank you,” Cas whispers, and Dean thinks he might be a little choked up, like Dean’s stupid painting is worth crying over.
After the breakup with Lisa, Charlie scolded Dean for being shitty at communicating in personal relationships.
Cas takes the hint and they’re kissing, the brush of lips turning into the slide of tongues, the kind of long, languid makeout Dean hasn’t had in forever. They kiss all the way until Dean is back on land again, shaking sky or sea out of his hair.
Cas backs up off the bed, bending to unlace Dean’s boots and tug them off. “Guess that means we’ll have to take it easy the rest of the weekend,” he says lightly.
“Dean,” Cas says, taking Dean’s face between both of his hands. “None of this bothers me. If you’re aroused by things I do to you, I’ll consider that a compliment. Now go.”
The instant, visceral image of a paddle in Cas’s hands makes Dean flush. He nods, not trusting himself to speak.
“I’ve paid plenty of attention,” Dean says without meaning to. His face goes hot but Cas doesn’t seem to notice, peering out the window at the Hill Country sprawling underneath them.
Dean opens the bottom drawer, one he rarely ventures into with clients, and pulls out a thin black cane, the rubber smooth under his hand.
Cas grimaces. “I must have been more inebriated than I’d thought because for a second I just—” He looks down, shaking his head. “I forgot you aren’t my sub all the time.”
“No,” Cas says, and now he sounds almost incredulous. Giddy, too, huffing out a laugh. “I haven’t been with anyone since I realized — well, not for a really long time.” He uncovers his face, smiling up at Dean. “Is that what it’s like? Being an omega?”
“That’s very serious,” Cas says, grabbing Dean by the hips and flipping him onto his back. Dean squeaks, the scent of his arousal — his
After that, Cas doesn’t apologize. He doesn’t even ask, just jerks Dean off his cock by the hair and paints him white. Sometimes when he’s fucking Dean, he’ll pull out and come all over his lower back, dripping down his hole, somehow more obscene than if he had actually come inside Dean. Sometimes he jerks Dean off and then makes Dean suck his fingers clean, taste his own bitter pleasure.
“Hello,” Cas says, giving her a little wave, but something isn’t right. Something makes Dean tell Charlie
Cas looks out over the field where the shadows of cactuses can barely be made out. The moon makes both of his eyes look grey instead of just the one. “It’s difficult to find a casual submissive when you’re not interested in sex.”
Cas cries out as he comes, covering Dean’s fist in hot pulses. Dean keeps licking his fluttering hole through it, knowing he’ll be fantasizing forever about the way Cas keens.
Sometimes Cas sees Dean and forgets how to breathe. That’s certainly the case when he walks into their bedroom and sees Dean kneeling on a pillow next to the bed, hands clasped behind his back.
“I’m not sure how we got here from abiogenesis,” Cas says. “I believe it’s last call — would you like to continue this elsewhere?”
It takes three tries for his card to scan, and he gives a grateful smile to the ever-patient driver when it finally does. The bus starts before he gets the card back in his wallet and he stumbles, nearly dropping his books into a kid’s lap. “Sorry, sorry,” he says, pulling his books tighter to his chest and glancing around the bus, gaze landing on the only free seat, just vacated by a xenophobic asshole.
Cas laughs, and Dean can’t take his eyes off him as he prowls into bed, cock hard and pretty as he fits into the V between Dean’s thighs. He’s quick to rip open the condom and slick himself up, and then he’s filling Dean with the slow, shallow thrusts that make Dean insane, going just a bit deeper every time.
Dean suddenly smells unavailable. Not mated, not exactly, but claimed, and Cas is expected to act like he’s not gutted by it.
“I want it to be like that,” Cas says, and Dean laughs before leaning down for a sweet, lingering kiss. Softly running his thumb across Dean’s cheek, Cas says, “Now, how do I make you feel good?”
“You don’t get to beat me up and not even cuddle me afterwards,” Dean says, reaching for Cas’s arm. “Come on.”
“Dean. You couldn’t have known,” Cas says. “I have feelings for you, and last night was—it was intimate, wasn’t it? I can’t compartmentalize that.”
Dean blushes, looks down. “I’m glad you like it. I was worried you’d hate it and, you know, put it in the back of your closet with the Simon Says one.”
Dean doesn’t even notice the pleasure grow intense, intense, intense, until he’s crying out as he comes, making a mess of his t-shirt and the comforter.
Cas rolls his eyes. Dean grins out at the open highway. He can’t have what he really wants with Cas, but this is pretty fucking great, too.
“Let me recap the fuck out of this,” Charlie says, gesturing at him with a half-smoked joint. “This dude you’re really into, who you used to bang, and I’m not going to ask if he’s a client because I’ll lose my shit, I swear to —”
And because Dean is drunk, he leans further forward and brushes his lips over the place his hand just touched, just a barely-there caress of Cas’s cheek.
Cas drops the remote and takes two predatory steps towards Dean—Dean’s heart stutters then gallops ahead—before halting abruptly, the surprise flashing across his face morphing into something grimmer. “I need to go.”
Cas responds with the eye-roll emoji a few minutes later, and Dean grins the whole time he’s pouring two mugs of coffee and walking through their yard. Cas is waiting at the table on his deck, and he calls out, “We’re not making a cat castle!”
there are a lot of open seats, so green eyes sits with one between him and trenchcoat. trenchcoat looks up and gives him a tiny smile. green eyes smiles back but doesn’t say anything, just puts in his earbuds and drums his fingers on his thigh to the beat.
Dean rubs his cheek against Cas’s, pulse starting to slow. They bask in each other, the warmth where they’re touching, the aligning of their heartbeats, the softness of their breaths.
Cas is gone before Dean makes it to his feet, which is for the best considering how much his over-eager fingers struggle with his bootlaces. Finally he makes it to the couch and goes down on his knees again.
Dean’s bored with all the bus posturing. All the men who stand instead of having to sit directly next to other men, but feel free to take reign of multiple seats with their spread legs when the seats are occupied by women. All the humans sneering at the sight of tentacles or horns or cloven feet. The elves who sneer at everyone as if the entire bus experience is below them.
Dean would’ve met a woman. Married her, built a white-picket fence, never felt shame. A woman who is soft and sweet and doesn’t hurt him for fun or put him in a collar like she has the right to own him. A woman who would never refer to him as a possession.
Dean tugs Cas down for another kiss as Cas’s hand drifts down Dean’s body, mapping the hard of his sternum and soft of his belly and velvet of his cock. Dean spreads his legs, tossing one knee over Cas’s hip, wanton and shameless.
