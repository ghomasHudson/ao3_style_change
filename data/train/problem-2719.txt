Come on,”  Heat creeps onto John’s cheeks.  He clears his throat, shaking out the paper and raising it to cover what he’s certain is becoming an unmistakable blush.
I shake my head.  I feel empty, numb.  Don’t want to think about it, so I push it down, down.  Can’t tell him now, I only want to sleep. I stand up and move like a ghost to the bedroom.  Five minutes later, John follows.
“You’re upset with me,”  John spins around, ready to spit words he’ll later regret, but when he sees Sherlock’s face he lets his mouth snap shut.  The man looks nearly frantic.  “We’d agreed not to walk away during important conversations, John.
Our lips meet again and again.  The kiss has evolved—has quickly turned predatory—the journal cast aside as we devour each other on our bedroom floor.  I push John back, back—yank down his trousers and toss them carelessly aside. I free his cock from his pants and swallow him down, hungry and dissolute.  I watch him writhe and squirm as he hardens against my tongue, body beginning to tremble and hips jerking lightly. I pull off quick and reach for the drawer, toss the lube at him, hands scrabbling at my trousers.  “Sherlock—” He says, sitting up, eyes wide.
My hands slide down to his arse now, and feeling bold, reckless, I slip one finger down, down, and press hard against his tight hole.  He shouts my name—stunned—as he comes—violently—between us. The sound of my name torn from his lips sends me spiraling wildly after him.  Clutching on to each other, we ride out the waves, rocking slowly as the tide washes us out to sea.
“Shall we order?”  He asks, grinning widely.  “Oh look, they have fish and chips.”
“Anything else?”
My mother throws her hands in the air and exclaims loudly when we walk through the door of their cottage.  Kisses John on each cheek and hugs him tight. I want to roll my eyes at her overt enthusiasm, but the sight of them together causes something new to bloom in my chest.  Here they all are--my given family and my chosen one--together at last.
I stand abruptly, spinning in a slow circle—perhaps—”Call her,”  I blurt out, glancing around to find them both staring at me, confused.  Always ten steps behind. “Isla. Call her,” John looks at Ben, who shrugs.  I watch as he scrolls through the contacts list, locates her name and hits
I step toward him and kiss his temple, hand on his cheek.  “I was living in that same haze. I think we--” A soft thump on the floor above.  Both our eyes shoot upward, then back at each other, alarmed.
And maybe some distance—the sort of distance that they both know full well is temporary,
They spend the day sipping mulled cider and chatting—discussing the wedding, recent cases, the blog.  Mrs. Holmes doesn’t hesitate to bombard Harry with questions about John’s youth and what he got up to.  Harry doesn’t hesitate to respond in kind, much to the delight of Sherlock.
“Think he’s left already?” John asks, shivering slightly in the brisk early evening air.
He looks back at me thoughtfully, and then, a slow nod.  “All right, then. You text her, I’ll text Greg? We can ask Mrs. H. when she gets back.”
god, all right.  What, then?  What?”
ETA: Just noticed that with this chapter I surpassed 200k words posted on AO3!  That feels...worth mentioning?  Wouldn’t have even kept writing after the first story if it weren’t for all the feedback and encouragement, so thank you to this community for this hobby.
“We were planning our matching outfits for the inevitable wedding.  Surely Myc and I will be best men?” I roll my eyes. Not about to discuss a fictional wedding with a very smug looking Harry on Christmas.
John isn’t quite sure how long he’s been sobbing in the snug circle of Sherlock’s arms.  At some point they’d sunk down to the floor, still clinging to one another—and really it’s getting a bit ridiculous now.  John pulls back slowly, immensely relieved, but mostly feeling like a proper fool.  He lets himself drop from his kneeling position, arse right on the probably-filthy kitchen floor.  He leans back against a cupboard and determinedly does
I had also taken a moment earlier to ask John if he was all right with it.  In all of my anger and blame yesterday, I had failed to see that he wasn’t really given a choice in the matter.  He may have made a mistake when put on the spot, but it isn’t as if he chose this.
Eventually, he visibly surfaces, coming alive beneath John’s hands and meeting his lips—the full force of his desire evident in each eager kiss. With a contented groan, John falls back, allowing Sherlock to press him into the sheets, responding without much thought—revelling in the ease of this connection, the heat of him, the thin layer of slick sweat forming on their bare skin, the tendrils of warmth rapidly growing and blooming throughout John’s body.  Gradually, they sink into each other, lost to the world as heat grows, hips writhe, chests heave and fingers seek.
At the sound of his name, his lids flicker open to carefully peek up at us.  His eyes roam over my face with no reaction whatsoever. He looks bored and detached from his unfortunate reality.  Can hardly blame the man. When his eyes lock on John’s, however, he abruptly sits up straight, plastic chair wobbling precariously.  “You’re John Watson.”
After two weeks of silence and increasingly desperate voicemails and text messages, never once returned—Mycroft had intervened.  He’d scooped John off the street during one of his Tesco runs and made him listen, made him understand why Sherlock had left him.
“I want to see the garden,”  She beams.
“And that concerns you?”
Needs the audience for his incomparable genius, yes—but more than that, he craves companionship.  For most of his life, he’d convinced himself that he could never have it—had filled that metaphorical hole with a seven percent solution and far too many bloody cigarettes.  But then there was Dr. Watson.  And Mycroft prefers even this feigned death to the half-life he’d been living before John had shown up.
(See the end of the chapter for
They stare at each other, only breaking their shared gaze when Angelo swoops in with three plates—John’s favourite, Sherlock’s and Rosie’s—and the two of them devour the whole of it, followed by indecently delicious panna cotta which John demands to be added to the menu in addition to the cake that they’ll still need to figure out.
“Don’t you dare ask me if I’m sure.  I want this,” He pushes his arse back into me, a clear demonstration that he indeed does want it.  This motion strokes my erection where it stands against my stomach, and I let slip a low moan. He’s surprised me, yet again.  John hasn’t been quite as keen on prostate stimulation as I have—it’s generally a bit overwhelming for him. Not entirely sure why we’re doing this at all, but he’s insisted that he wants it.  I look up to see that he’s turned back to glare at me. I must have hesitated a moment too long. “Sherlock,” He sighs.
John ponders this for a moment.  Sherlock generally accepts whatever feeble dose of Paracetamol John allows him for whatever aches he’s acquired from an unsuccessful experiment or errant criminal.  Obviously, John doesn’t keep anything stronger in the flat.  Evidently, Sherlock isn’t hoarding any triptans or he’d have taken them.
And now again, since he’s returned.  Inching, slowly, for
I look at him now, standing in this place he reluctantly chose as his home, and see exactly the state I left him in when I fell off that roof and out of his life.  I wondered once--staring at the back of his head on that bench by the lake--if he had been lost, as I had been. I see clearly now that he had.
Any and all feedback is deeply appreciated.  xo
managed to love.  And so I say nothing.  My light sobs continue, along with the deluge of tears that I can’t seem to quell.  I bring my hands up to grasp his, arms crossed in front of me to twine our fingers together where they rest on my sides.  He responds by hitching a denim-clad leg over my hip, pulling me in even closer, and bringing his lips to my ear. “I’m sorry it took me so long to get here,”  His voice is light, barely a whisper. I tighten my grip on his fingers. Perhaps this is what I’ve been waiting to hear. “I don’t know what I’ll be able to give you—if it’ll ever be enough—but we can have this.  I know that I want this,” I want this too. What is it that he thinks he can’t give me? Sex? I don’t need it. I’m essentially indifferent—not opposed, nor convinced that it’s necessary for a functional relationship.  Love? Perhaps he’s afraid he can never match what I feel for him. He likely can’t. He’s the only man I’ve ever cared for—I don’t expect him to have that same kind of devotion. It isn’t normal or healthy, and it’s something I had to accept long ago.  I let go of his hands and turn toward him. He loosens his grip to allow me to shift within the circle of his arms. Our faces now centimeters apart, I can see that his emotions are as close to the surface as my own. Perhaps this experience has been cathartic for him as well.
—a laughable claim, considering he’d loved the man from the start.  How must that have felt, what damage has it done?  What lasting effects has the sum of John’s actions had on the most profound relationship of his entire bloody life?
“Hi,”  I linger behind him, slip my arms under his, palms flat against his chest.  Rest my chin on his shoulder and press my lips briefly to his cheek. “What is it?”  He sighs, leans into me. Holds up his phone.
All of the clothing is 1970’s style, and the journal contains a wealth of information.  Her name was Linda Elizabeth Jones, and the address she’s written in neat, looping script on the first page is the very same house that we now stand in.
“Good,”  Sherlock grins as he turns automatically to help Rosie—who has grabbed onto his arm for support in her attempt to clamber into the tub—by lifting her first high in the air, then dropping her gently into the blue basin.  “How is it, then?”  He asks seriously, peering down at her tiny form swallowed up by the ridiculous vessel.  John watches all of this with great amusement.
Until Sherlock.  Even through the grief and the rage and the fear and the hell that his life has been for the last two years, he’d never stopped loving Sherlock.
He, it seems, had been grieving, too.
I think of last night, of the roles I’d chosen for us in the moment.  I hadn’t planned on taking things so far, so fast. Barely twenty four hours had passed since our very first kiss, and I skipped about ten steps in between.  Had planned to take things slowly—to be certain that he wanted this sort of physical intimacy. He’s never had it before, never
“Doesn’t matter,” He whispers, letting one hand come to rest protectively on the back of Sherlock’s neck.  His fingers knead into the tense muscle beneath them, feeling Sherlock melt further into him, feeling him sigh contentedly, feeling his body pressed warmly against John’s own.  He loves him.  God, he loves him.  “We know now.”
“I just don’t understand,”  He says evenly.  “Why didn’t you talk to me about this?”
He’d liked it, and he’d told Sherlock as much.  He had not, however, expected him to remember such a mundane statement, or even to be listening at all.
“My feelings about--interpersonal relationships, in general--have changed, in my years away.  Now that I’ve returned, it’s--important to me, to hold on to them. I am not an easy man to care for,”  I hesitate, not entirely sure what I’m trying to say here. “I can’t lose John. Over this.” I sound a bit desperate.  But that is the real issue, I suppose. How many panic attacks, how many tears, how many black moods will it take to drive him away?  A person can only take so much.
John is watching me from a few yards away, amused.  He’s leaning against a tabletop—arms crossed, ankles too.  We’re on the third floor of the Yard, waiting for Lestrade to wrap up.  Apparently we need to sign something or some other such nonsense. It’s nearly eleven, and the entire floor appears to be deserted, save for Lestrade, who’s puttering about in his office.
“Mm,”  John says, watching with no small amount of amusement as Sherlock darts toward a particularly tall, narrow tree sticking out of a massive pile of similarly tall, narrow trees.
“Fine?”  Sherlock cuts him off, his entire pompous being seeming to return to his body in a rush as he suddenly comes back online.  “You say that far too often, John.  It’s fine, it’s all fine.  I don’t want you to—
John blinks, swallowing thickly and trying to process this sharp turn and the words that have just been tossed at him without preamble.
“John,”  Sherlock breathes.  John clears his throat, tries—he really does—not to cry.
“No,” I don’t.  If his mates warned him that two men showed up asking questions, he’ll be waiting for the advantage of darkness to return to the flat and pack his bags.  “He’ll show up soon.” I’m sure of it. What will happen then, I don’t know.
“What was?”  His tone is sharper now, his usually calm demeanor cracking, bits of panic showing through.  “Tell me.” Irene is sobbing now, standing slumped in abject misery, hands over her mouth. I spare a second to glance at John, whose face reflects her pain.  I pull him closer and he leans against my side, arm winding around my waist, eyes never leaving Irene.
“Anderson—”
“Isn’t that for your benefit?  So you can go back, when—”
“Hey,”  John whispers, aeons later, once the sweat has begun cooling and the mess between them has been transferred to John’s plaid shirt and tossed to the floor.  Sherlock lets his eyes drift open, turns his head to watch John where he lies beside him, under the same duvet.  “All right?”  He asks quietly, for the third time tonight.  Sherlock finds his hand beneath the covers, weaves their fingers together.
he supposes, is the answer.  There have been countless times over the years—from the very start, as he says—that John watched an expression of absolute surprise flit over Sherlock’s features as a direct result of something John himself has done or said.  He thinks this, but says nothing.  Sherlock seems to see it anyway.  He smiles.  “Of course you do,”  He sighs, sliding a hand up to cup the side of John’s neck.  “You anticipate exactly what I need, even when I haven’t realized I may need it.”
“Let’s have sex,”  I stop abruptly, one foot still slightly in the air.  I sway a bit where I stand.
, they called her.”
“I want to show you something,”  He rumbles, lying down on John’s right and fishing some sort of paper out of his jacket pocket.  Opening his eyes, John accepts the unmarked envelope that’s hovering over his face, glancing at Sherlock before removing the well-worn paper inside.  He takes a deep breath when he sees what it is—immediately recognizing the tidy, looping handwriting.  Holding the letter carefully in one hand, he wraps the other around Sherlock’s restless fingers and begins to read.
“What would you have me do?  I can’t force my affection on him, he doesn’t
“Yes, well.  Can never resist an opportunity to whip up a trifle.  My favourite, you know.”
“Sorry,
“Of course I’ll take her, when have I ever said no?  We can go to the zoo.  Greg will be at the Yard all bloody day and night anyway,”  She pauses, considering.  “Everything all right with you two?”
“Alcohol doesn’t suit you when you’re in that state.  Now we know,” Oh.
“What do
He rolls his eyes.
“It’s not luck, Sherlock.  It’s love. And it goes both ways.  I know what you did for me. I owe you my life.”
“As I’d already told Sherlock before the two of you flew off to America, I don’t
“Why are you opposed to using Hal’s advances for our benefit?  It’s the obvious next step,” I knew he wouldn’t like it, but it isn’t as if anything will happen.  It’s simply a way to manipulate him into giving us more data. Isn’t that why we’re here, after all?  The client wanted us to befriend him—to get a glimpse into whatever he’s up to and then take him down.  Whoever they are, they knew that he’d be taken with me. Somehow they were aware that he’s an admirer. John hesitates, brushing my hair back from my forehead.
“Sherlock,”  He tries gently, framing the man’s jaw with both hands.  “It’s all right—you don’t have to answer right now.  And whatever you decide, it’s—“
“Whatever this is, I’m not up for it.”
“John,” I whisper into the silver-gold halo of hair my cheek rests against.  He hasn’t moved from the circle of my arms. His breaths are coming slower now, softening shaft still buried inside me, and his wet cheek still pressed against my neck.  He says nothing, but slides a hand up my back to squeeze my nape lightly in response.
I accompany John to his therapy appointment.  I am in no way convinced that this is something I need, but John wants me to meet Ella--and really, I will do nearly anything he asks of me.
“Have at it,” Says Charles.  And away we go.
“A piece of you,”  I correct. “Proof of our time together,”  He looks down at me, where I still kneel on the floor, his eyes now shining—his mind clearly racing.  And then:
That—is the point.  A push.  A place like this will encourage them both to confront what Sherlock suspects (hopes) is a long-desired but ultimately unobtained intimacy, giving them no choice but to be proximally close, to exist inside the same small bubble for a few days in a way that simply isn’t possible anymore within the familiar walls of 221B.  Not when one of them has made a habit of fleeing up the stairs whenever the air around them becomes a bit too heavy with all things unspoken and the other can’t seem to say anything of value at all.
“I do know that,” There’s no humour in Sherlock’s tone.  He means only to reassure, to comfort.  John opens his eyes.
“And you’re here to learn to prevent these nightmares, episodes and thoughts?”
“It’s okay--Sherlock--stop, it’s all right,” He’s got his hands on my biceps, trying to hold me down.  “
John gives as good as he gets—pouring everything he’s been holding back into this precious union—shedding the last of his reservations and allowing himself to get lost in it.  Limbs tangle, hearts thud in tandem against the walls of their serried chests.  He can hardly breathe through the flood of shared relief that surges between them—the desperate slide of tongues and warring lips as they tenderly tear each other apart.
When we leave the restaurant, Rosie hugs Molly and Lestrade goodbye, then grabs my hand as they walk away.  I glance down and meet her trusting blue eyes—John’s in miniature—and feel my heart swell with gratitude for this family that I’ve somehow found myself a part of.  We share a long look, her eyes holding a wisdom beyond her five years of life. We have these moments every now and then. Tiny snippets of connection—as if she knows that I doubt my place in their lives from time to time, and is seeking to reassure me.  When my eyes shift back up, John is watching us, an odd look on his face—as if he’s weighing his options. Without warning, he steps forward, brings his palms up to my face, and kisses me soundly. I feel my arm come up automatically, five fingers grasping the fabric of his jacket—the others still wrapped around Rosie’s tiny hand.  I close my eyes, tilt my head slightly. Completely out of my depth, but entirely open to this experience. John pulls back, presses his lips to my cheek, then gently brings our mouths together once more. I open my eyes when he takes a step back—my lips slightly parted, mind reeling, senses exploding.
“Oh?”  John responds distractedly, adding milk to his own tea and putting away the last few dishes from the drying rack.  He supposes there’s really no point—they’ll have to be packed up soon anyway—but it’s in his nature to clear up the clutter.
When Sherlock turns his head just-so to steal a glance at the man who sits stoically at his feet, he finds steely blue eyes already on him.  And this time when John stares and stares and stares and stares and says nothing aloud but holds everything unspoken in his gaze, Sherlock doesn’t look away.
“I’ll never leave,” He finds himself saying—voice firm, unyielding.  “Even if we hadn’t—I’ll never leave him.”
“John wanted us to meet, so here we are.  There are no expectations, so don’t feel like you need to speak about anything in particular,” Is this where John learned to read my mind?  She’s watching me carefully, making emotional deductions, no doubt. A skill I seem to be incapable of learning.
John whispers, turning his head to press his lips to my pulse point and sending a chill through my body when his tongue skims my neck.  His words broke a long silence between us—we’ve been lying here for ages in our driftwood sanctuary, covered in sand and clinging to one another.  I’ve never known such contentment—never felt such certainty. But the air is growing cold—and the fireworks had stopped long ago. “Come on,” He rolls off of me, crawling out into the open night and holding out a hand to pull me to my feet.  We take a moment to brush the sand from our clothing before locking eyes for the first time since our mouths first met.
“How?”  I can’t help but ask.  A body, then? A note? Any sort of tangible trail that we can follow?  There must be proof—Irene is no idiot. When she looks up, her expression is open, if a bit bemused.
I hurriedly break the kiss and swallow him down.  Tongue darting rapidly--tasting, savouring--cheeks slightly hollowed as he hardens in my mouth
And now he’s saying—what?  That there may be hope for us, after all?
“I look ridiculous,”  I hate these trousers.  Who decided that denim was an acceptable material for such a thing?  I also brought along a pair of lace-up black leather boots to complete the look.  My feet feel like they’re in a vice grip, having not yet broken them in. I let out an exasperated huff.
“I want to,”  He mumbles, shuffling in as John automatically wraps his arms around the small of his back.   “I didn’t think I cared.  Didn’t think it mattered.  But it does, John.  I want to tell them—everyone—and I want to give this a name,”  He seems to hold his breath, then—a sure sign that he’s unsure how John will respond.
I let them fuel me, surround me—bury my face in his neck and let go.
When Sherlock comes back online, he stands rather abruptly, taking John’s hand.
“Say please.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Sherlock breathes, pulling John’s bottom lip gently between his own.  John quietly groans, pushing his fingers into Sherlock’s disheveled curls, letting his eyes drift open to peer up at the man who holds his heart in his hands.
“You just decided to attempt an interrogation?”  He follows her, leaning against the door frame and watching her dash about.  “And what was in the bloody package anyway?  You’ve not mentioned a gift,”  She glances over her shoulder where she now stands at the sink, then returns her gaze to the stack of dishes in front of her.
“You’re to eat these, young man.  I don’t appreciate how thin you’ve gotten—there’s no reason for it when you’ve got me just downstairs.  I’ll be up later with a roast and we’ll have a proper dinner—send you off in style,” Her tone doesn’t leave room for argument and John nods once, giving her a fond, if a bit long-suffering smile.  It’s the first time in months she’s seen any sort of expression beyond a deep, unending pain or momentary confusion on his weary features.  She smiles back, pecking him on the cheek and following him to the door.
When the door clicks shut behind us, John sets the boxes on the desk, turns to me.  He looks as though he’s about to speak, but changes his mind. Strides forward, wraps his arms around my waist, presses his cheek against my chest.  My hands immediately come up to rest on his back. Pull him in, breathe him in, let him in at last.
Lestrade shows up (finally) around eight.  “All right, you two?” He hangs his coat and shuffles around the booth to sit next to John, plopping down the pint he had ordered on the way in.  “Sorry to keep you waiting,” He pauses, looks up at me intently, and says, “So tell me--what do you know about spontaneous human combustion?”
so with the requisite bit of huffing and glaring, John did.
“You thought I shagged you because I was upset over Mary?  Sherlock.  Did it feel that way, really?”  He knows that it didn’t, and suspects Sherlock is aware on some level that he’d never bloody do that.  He is a bit surprised that Sherlock is even aware of Mary, but he really shouldn't be.  Of course he bloody knows that John had attempted to begin dating again.  He probably also knows what a spectacular failure it had been.
Heart in my throat, I can’t help but question what I’m hearing.  Why, then, did he essentially cut me out of his life for
“A slide,”  Sherlock is just behind him.  John can feel a hint of breath on his neck and the heat of him at his back as they slowly spiral their way upward at a pace set by a clumsy three year old.  He’s still not grasping how playground equipment fits into the conversation.  Bit distracted, to be frank.
(All of this is piled on top of)
But it hasn’t.  They haven’t.  John hasn’t said a word.  He’s followed Sherlock around London as he’s always done—but passively now, barely present at all until the adrenaline kicks in and he has to be, for a while.  He spends his days at the clinic and his evenings wandering around the flat, reading or sipping tea or staring into the void, more often than not just retiring early, up the stairs to his own room.  Up and away.
“That’s quite a step up for you, then, isn’t it?”  She’s giggling, shaking her head.
“Irene Adler,”  I say bluntly, watching him for signs of recognition.  He knows her, that much is clear. I watch both of his perfectly plucked eyebrows creep up his forehead.  “Friend of yours?”
“Fear of
“I—had a bad night.  He’s had his bloody underlings trailing me for months, and one of them evidently called my sister to come fetch me.  I don’t know if Harry’s in on his little campaign to protect me or if Aoife just called her because they’re old mates.  Anyway, I woke up on Harry’s couch to find Mycroft sitting there like a bloody statue, speaking in riddles and behaving like a complete tosser.  Told me he wanted to
XOXOXOX
How long has Sherlock felt that he isn’t able to have this, that he isn’t worthy of it—of love?  Has John contributed to the restive doubt that’s haunted him for all these years?  Yes.  Yes, of course—is the short answer, the unbearably painful truth.  They’ve spent years working to get past the cruel words John has directed at him in his lowest moments, the violence he’s inflicted upon him, his determination to remain distant once Sherlock had returned from the dead.  They have worked through all of the major ways they’ve wronged one another, all of the big moments in their lives that have defined the dark side of their friendship.
The moment they step outside onto another red brick pathway, Sherlock drags him to the left toward a large garage—clearly built ages after the rest of the cottage, which looks like it was plucked right out of the Irish countryside.
cottage—entirely hidden from the street by the small forest that seems to make up the front garden.  John lets his eyes roam, taking it all in.  Two stories, four large, paned windows—two on each floor.  The house is made of dark, weathered stone in the same style as the surrounding wall, and sports a thatch roof covered almost entirely in lush green ivy.  The arched front door is made of heavy wood with simple, hand-carved floral patterns within six inlaid squares and a half circle up top.  It had been painted blue at some point, but the colour has faded almost completely, leaving it looking well-loved, if a bit cheerless.
Two hours on a train, ten minutes in a cab, and we’re traipsing up the stairs to 221B.  Mrs. Hudson pokes her head out to ask us about our trip, and we respond in exasperated fondness as we continue to inch our way upstairs.  John puts the kettle on, I build a fire.
be like this,”  He laces their fingers together, reading the understanding on Sherlock’s features and finding it suddenly a bit easier to vocalize his thoughts.  “Um—another thing I feel should be said aloud while we’re on this topic,”  The doctor in him insists.  “We’re both clean.  Obviously, we’ve never discussed this.  But I have access to your charts and I know you’ve found your way to mine,” He’s opened his laptop on more than one occasion over the years to find his own medical records staring back at him.  “Just—if we—I just wanted to acknowledge that,”  Christ.
“Can we get out of here?”  John says as soon as they’re gone.  He doesn’t elaborate, but I can see that he’s feeling overwhelmed.  I nod. He unlinks our hands and slides out of the booth, waiting for me to rise before heading for the exit.  As we walk past the stage, I realize that the man singing is Ben. His voice is lovely—I take a moment to wonder why he lip syncs during his shows.  We wave on our way out, and his words follow us through the door.
“Where’s this coming from, Sherlock?”  He closes his laptop, sets it aside. Leans forward in his chair.  “I know that yesterday—everything that happened with Jones, being so close when he—it was—a lot.  But we were careful. And we were never in any real danger—”
and bloody
“Yes, well.  We’ve got the ceiling for it,”  That
“Can I really?”  She asks, face lighting up.  John glances at Sherlock, who gives him a look that says
They really have a
“Yeah, Sherlock.  It’s been good,”  John agrees, laughing quietly.  “Bit of an understatement, from my end.  I—should tell you—I’ve—or well, I

I can still hardly believe it.  It’s true that they rarely leave their cottage in Wales these days, and my childhood home sits empty—but it’s an extremely generous gift, and I’m quite touched to be on the receiving end of such a sentimental bequest.  I’ve no idea what John will think of it, though. He’s already uncomfortable with the concept of family money, and has yet to accept that he’s a part of ours. To be handed the deed to a Georgian cottage in North Yorkshire is going to be quite a shock.
“We do have lives outside of detective work.  Obviously,” Hal grins, his expression challenging.  I’d like to knock him sideways off of his self-assembled pedestal, but I’ve got a job to do.  “This area is glorious in the summertime. Surely you know the appeal, as you’ve chosen to take up permanent residence,”  He shrugs.
“She’s always referred to me as your boyfriend,” John points out, turning to fix himself a new cup.  It’s true.  Donovan has never missed an opportunity to imply that they’re a couple, in her playfully snide way.  Her entire demeanor toward them has softened considerably over the past few years (in no small part because of Sherlock’s own transformation, John is sure) and she retired the ridiculous and cruel nicknames long ago.  But some things will never change.
“Fine,” He nods.  I hope that it’s true.  “And you? I trust you and John had a nice time with our parents?”
“Quite,”  Sherlock grins, panting lightly and looking like he can hardly believe his good fortune—grey eyes alight in way they've never quite been before.  “Home, I think.”
It’s glorious.  Like something from the storybooks I’d rejected as a child.
“Boys!”  He exclaims, arms held out as if gesturing toward a game show prize.  “I believe I owe you my gratitude. I
“Yes,” John says, and smiles.
The rest of my people stayed with me as well.  Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, Molly and Mycroft. Taking up residence in some neglected room of my mind palace, their voices calming the violent waves in my head.  Reminding me of what's important, of why I jumped. How could I take on this impossible task if I hadn't something to return to, a community to protect? I'd discovered the value of sentiment, at last.  But it was never meant to take so long.
“We don’t really
“Yes, well, moving
“John,” Sherlock whispers, letting his forehead fall forward to rest against John’s own.  And oh god, he’s said it all in that single syllable, hasn’t he.  He’s said it all.  And when he rolls his hips back experimentally, John tries not to fall.
“No!  John—”  Molly is up and in front of him in an instant, reaching halfheartedly for his wrist to stop him.  She quickly thinks better of it and lets her hand drop, positioning herself in front of the door instead and swallowing nervously at the look he shoots her way.  “Just—wait.  Please,”  She breathes.  She glances up to see Greg standing in the kitchen doorway, staring at her as though he hardly recognizes her at all.
I slide my hand up to his chest, palm resting comfortably against warm skin.  Let my head drop back to the pillow—exhaustion creeping in once more. Nose buried in his silver hair, I tumble—like a boulder off of a cliff—into sleep.
In this universe, none of the things that lead Sherlock to realize that Vivian Norbury is actually
John clears his throat, glances up from where he’s been staring at the fairly large and weighty but altogether unassuming brown box and meets her eye.
“Where is Isla, Irene?”  He shoots back, clearly growing impatient.  “How does she factor into all this? Why are
Here she is.  8,500+ words of extremely indulgent, obnoxious fluff.  Oh, and some smut.  With a Christmas theme.
“Don’t apologize, John,” I stick up my arm, a cab instantly gliding up to the kerb.  “I’m happy to have met her,” And I am. She’s been an important part of John’s life for years now.  I give the driver the address Lestrade texted me, and we pull away.
I rest my hand against his heart, willing my own to slow, to match his steady rhythm.  His fingers pull gently through my hair, and I find peace once more as I drift back into sleep.
“If anyone is undeserving, it’s me.  He’s given me everything, and I’ve—” He cuts himself off when Molly rests a hand on his bicep, turning to meet her empathetic brown eyes.
territory when he’s cleared the table, washed his bowl and Harry’s, dried them, put them back in their cupboard and still received no response.  But then—
I know now that I’ll be ready to face whatever will come.  Letting my cheek rest against his silver-gold hair, I’m as content as I’ve ever been.  Calm. Quiet.  I close my eyes.
But apparently, there’d been a case.
“Stop,” John blurts out, voice slightly raised and cracking pathetically.  He clears his throat, lowering his tone.  “Just stop.  It isn’t—it’s not an option.  All right?  It’s not an option.”  And it bloody well isn’t.  Sherlock made that clear from the start, and it’s John’s own problem that everything he’d trained himself to push down, down, down and ignore for a damn
“What’s this, then?”  Greg asks, sidling out of the kitchen clutching the box she had painstakingly wrapped in thick brown paper and tied with red twine.
“Must.  Not sure,”  He hasn’t told her of their—breakthrough—last night.  He isn’t sure why.  She’d be thrilled to hear it.  But he feels as though he wants to guard this information like something impossibly precious, to hold it safely in his chest until they can explore it, define it, see what
The two of them manage to trip through the back door and spiral gracelessly up the staircase—elated, nearly giddy—helplessly clutching onto one another.  Once the landing is firmly beneath their feet, however, all sense of levity evaporates—a heady fog settling over them as Sherlock takes John’s hand and leads him straight down the hall to his bedroom.
“Honey, I don’t know shit,”  No surprise there. “Things have a certain way of happening around here.  You’ll know what I mean soon enough. I found an envelope of cash and clear instructions to take you to Hal.  I’m not about to question it.” I already know what he means. I’ve been blindly following instructions as well.  He pulls a black t-shirt over his head, and nods toward the door. “Let’s go find that pompous son of a bitch.”
“Yes.  But you know what I mean.”
“Carry on, then,” I say, waving a hand to dismiss their inanity as I stand to join the others.  I try not to think about marrying John. If I’m being completely honest with myself, it’s because I desperately want to, and I can hardly stand the potent joy that courses through me at the thought.  John has said that it’s too soon after Mary, and I won’t be bringing it up, for fear of overwhelming him. So I try not to think about it.
We stand under the torrid stream of water, steam rising on all sides of our very naked bodies.  This is the first time we’ve showered together--now I wonder what on Earth we were waiting for. It’s lovely.  I reach for my shampoo, lather it on my hands. Instead of running it through my own wet mop of curls, I slide my fingers through John’s soft mane from where I stand behind him.  He sighs as I work it into his scalp, his muscles relaxing, all tension seeping out of his body and down the drain.
my partner—but it’s—“
“You think he
John grins at me over his BLT.  “Must be something we can do in the meantime,” There he goes again.  Reading me like a book. “Find out where he works somehow? Or--I don’t know--”  He trails off. Pops a chip in his mouth. I’ve already tried to find out who employs him.  He’s unfortunately quite adept at flying under the radar--a skill that generally pairs well with a guilty conscience.  Ruth didn’t have any knowledge of how he spends his days. She wasn’t interested in chatting when he showed up at her flat last December.  Sent him away, shocked to have heard from him at all. He had slipped a note under her door with his phone number and address (
“Thought he’d been buried in it,”  He mumbles, glaring down at the bartop.  “Not that we’d bloody know—closed casket and all.  No one wants to look at the body of a man who’s just lept from a bloody rooftop.  Thought it’d gone with him to the grave.”
I smile.  “All right,”  A nod. “Tom seems nice,” Her face immediately turns bright red.
Is it that simple?  Blame it on the alcohol, really?  “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock has managed a small fire with the nearly diminished stack of chopped wood he’d found out back by the ramshackle greenhouse.  He glances up at John, looking rather smug, and they share a quick smile, John ducking his head to hide the extent of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh please,”  She scoffs.
may be.
Sherlock had managed to say a record number of times while relaying his brother’s texts to John, but he’d agreed to take on the case nonetheless.
“Come with me,” I cut him off.  He can spew nonsense for hours when he’s angry, and apparently time is in short supply.  He falls silent, lips going still—but his eyes say it all. Complete incredulity. Disbelief with a side of rage.  He stares at me for a long moment, the silence between us growing tense, almost painful. I feel my heart beating wildly in my chest, palms flat on the table, bracing myself for what’s to come.
“The blog, you know.  I couldn’t just stay silent.  Had a pretty strong opinion on the matter, if you’ll recall,” He’s shuffling his feet, clearly anxious.  “Anyway, it wasn’t just me, there were loads of people who knew you weren’t actually a fake. Anderson started a bloody club to discuss exactly that.  Well, that and their theory that you weren’t dead. Which obviously they were right about…” He trails off. I want to kiss the tension right off of his face.  But that’s not on, is it? Still not clear what his stance is on such public displays. I settle for lightly squeezing the back of his neck, and he leans into me, briefly.  Bumping his shoulder against my chest. A shy smile, then.
John opts for a direct approach.
.  Not anymore.”
“Want to spend the day with Molly?”  John asks on a whim, the words leaving his mouth before he can even think it through.  He hasn’t spoken to her about potentially taking Rosie today, but to be fair she’s never once said no—and it happens to be her day off.  Molly has been something like a friend, something like a third parent to Rosie from the very start.  An invaluable presence in their lives.  And she has made it known time and time again that she is just as thrilled to take her as Rosie is to go.
Molly titters nervously, then congratulates us profusely.  Mrs. Hudson is beaming, eyes glistening, apparently lost for words.
The long arms wrapped around his back tighten, fingers threaded through his hair clinging desperately.  The lithe body beneath him moves to match his momentum, a choir of eager gasps and urgent groans between them as the force of their writhing forms builds toward a crescendo.
“We’ve been told this is where to find Kenneth Jones.”
But Sherlock slows, gracefully easing his way into what John knows somehow, intuitively and definitively, is the third and final movement in this intimate concerto.  The piece representing the present.  His ears perk up, already recognizing the tune.
“You think I’m trying to leave you.  You believe I’ve done this because I’m not happy here,”  John swallows, unconsciously taking a step back.  Sherlock follows.  “You are an
“I thought you should have them.  God knows I don’t cook—couldn’t if I wanted to.  Not like she could. But you two have—” She waves her hand toward the kitchen.  “—more ambition. And skill.” She smiles. John looks near tears. His eyes have gone a bit watery as he hugs her and whispers his thanks.  “Love you, boys,” She says, grabbing her coat and opening the door. “Thank you for today. Happy Christmas,” And she strides out into the night.
“Neither am I,”  John grins a bit sheepishly, waiting for Sherlock to look at him.  When he does, his eyes bare a wicked glint.  “Obviously,”  John adds, swallowing at the brief flash of heat he sees in those sharp grey orbs.  “But for the record,
meet Sherlock’s inquiring eye.
“I never minded her, actually.  Competent.  Intelligent.  Braver than most.  She could’ve been a decent match for you, had you not mucked it up so thoroughly”  John huffs, elbowing him in the ribs.
“Idiot,”  John says fondly, shoving Sherlock toward his bedroom.  “You knew I’d do that.  Always picking up your bloody mess.”
Finally!
“Sherlock, you don’t have to do this.  Can we not, actually? Can we not do this?” John has been curled up in his chair since he walked through the door two hours ago.  I glance over at him. “I don’t want to know any more. Not now, not yet. It’s already too much.” He’s overwhelmed. I don’t know how to help him, so I’ve been gathering data.  It’s what I do.
“You’ll have to play nice,”  John shuffles over and drops down beside him, sitting close and wrapping Sherlock’s hand in his own, leaning heavily against his side.  Sherlock presses his lips to John’s temple, then rests his cheek against his crown.  John can feel him smile.
“I’ve let you down,” John sobs quietly into his neck.  Sherlock holds on tighter, deeply unsettled by the revelation that he’s felt this way, evidently for a very long time.
Otherwise, he gives me space.
“John?”  He breathes.  A question.  A request for permission.  He lets the pads of his fingers drift down, dipping just beneath John’s waistline.  He says nothing more, watches as John struggles to keep his breathing steady, his eyes remaining firmly closed, his lips parted and panting.  He waits.
It takes us thirty-eight minutes to reach the address Ben had texted.  The drive, I will reluctantly admit, was beautiful. The coastline is quite striking—rocky cliffs and vibrant flora—all framed, of course, by the sprawling sea.  With John behind the wheel of our little convertible—the sea breeze infiltrating our nostrils and ruffling our hair—I’ve nearly forgotten the black mood that’s been looming over my shoulder the past two days.  As it turns out, they’ve rented a modern beach house, right on the water. Bright white, with floor to ceiling windows and an angular roof. Entirely different from our own little cottage, but rather lovely in its own way.  The moment we pull into the driveway, Ben and Adam waltz out the front door to greet us, blue cocktails in hand.
“Sorry,
“What’s he up to, then?”  Harry is watching him, a bit fondly and more than a bit exasperatedly, from her perch on the bed.
She claims she piled clothing atop her body and set it ablaze.  Watched to be sure it caught, and fled. Overall, a poorly formed plan that nevertheless got the desired result.  Esme Knoll is, indeed, quite dead.
“Tell me what you mean by that,”  I say firmly. Everything about this feels suddenly—off.  “He
—each time he’d allowed John to see exactly how glad he was to have him by his side.
“Try not to get kidnapped, I won’t have time to rescue you before dinner.”
Mycroft!  Get in here!”  He disappears. “Babe!”  We hear distantly. John turns to me.
“So tell him we did,”  John’s voice is calm—his doctorly side making a swift reappearance.  He places a hand on my back, and I glance over at him. When he meets my eyes, I see within them a silent plea:
“Indeed,” It’s a two hour train ride to the Berwick Station, but could be worth the trip.  “While this woman is clearly an idiot if she thinks she’s hearing ghosts, I must admit I am intrigued,”  Letters in the wall? Bodies in the cellar? This is at least a six. “Shall we take a trip?”
Sherlock breathes slowly through his nose, wills his heart to calm, attempts to quiet his mind a bit—to tamp down the swell of anxiety and let instinct float to the forefront.  This is fine.  This is good.  This is comfortable, even, if he’d just let it be.  It’s what he wants—has wanted—for ages.  It’s the closeness he’s craved, and it was John who’d initiated it, even if he is now quite asleep.
come out of his mouth—well…
Once our glasses have run dry, our guests take their leave.  We show them out with promises to see each other again soon. We hear the click of the front door downstairs, and John and I are alone at last.
John had gone to the loo when we’d arrived back—and now he walks out purposefully, grabbing my hand and pulling me toward the couch.  He pushes me down onto the cushions and crawls right into my lap, straddling my thighs. His arms snake around my neck, cheek resting against mine.  He’s startled me, a bit. His movements are intentional, deliberate—he’s got something on his mind. My arms gather him in, winding around the small of his back.  He sighs, breath hot against my jaw.
John’s free hand comes up slowly, unenthusiastically patting her on the back before dropping back down to his side.  She doesn’t let go quite yet, pressing her cheek against his soft knit jumper and trying to form a single safe sentence.  She wants to erase the lines from his face, lift the circles from his eyes.  She wants to tell him that
—to press into his skull and his temples and his brow with deft fingers, all at once—so carefully and effectively.  With such purpose.  Even through the haze of pain, Sherlock had become instantly terrified that if he showed any outward sign of
been ages since we’ve seen each other—the last time was the night everything blew up between John and myself.  I’d attended her dance recital and then disappeared from her life. Two months must feel like an age to someone so small.
He’d love to blame Anderson; he really would.
Rosie chooses this moment to abruptly fling open the door just beside them.  John turns, startled, to find her grinning from ear to ear.
“Come on,”  Sherlock breathes, kissing him urgently—fusing them together, warming John down to the bone—before breaking away, his gaze heated, intense.  “Let’s go to bed.”
he thinks, smiling to himself.  The bastard.  John has been insisting his old one is fine, just fine, for years now.  It isn’t, really—it barely functions.  Perhaps another reason why he has been rather uninspired to open it and set fingers to keys.  He approaches the desk, noticing a folded piece of white paper sitting atop the box.
Molly gives him an incredulous look.  The pizzas are nearly finished baking, and we’re on our second bottle of a nice Pinot Grigio John picked up on his way home from the shops.
“For the record,”  John begins, pointedly ignoring the jumper that now lies in a heap on top of their cart full of fairy lights and baubles and books and Christmas crackers and toys and two tiny festive dresses.  “You had me before all that,”  He slides his palm down Sherlock’s forearm, grasping his hand tightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
For now, though, here's a bunch of explanation in the form of rambling dialogue and (naturally) a bit more confusion for you!
“A doctor
“Ben,”  She nearly whispers, face crumpling, walls crumbling, at the sound of his voice.  I watch on helplessly as she tries and fails to fight the tears that have now spilled over to stream down her cheeks.  “It was my fault,” She breathes.
He’d done these things so that there would be no doubt—even to John, who remains infuriatingly thick when it comes to such things—that he’d meant it to be a date.
“Hey, family.  Happy bloody Christmas,”  She shuffles inside, throwing her arms around John’s neck and glancing around the room behind him.  “Well,”  She hasn’t stopped beaming.  “Here we go.”
She squawks.  “He’s obsessed with you, you’ve got nothing to lose.”
than we’ll ever need.  Knows that my parents adore them—would be thrilled to do anything they can for them— “I needed to be realistic.  I can’t let your family support us indefinitely. Everything you did after Mary died—I’ll never forget it, but I needed to stand on my own two feet.”  This is so typical of him. Stubborn as ever, refusing to ask for assistance when he needs it. And why? Because of some sort of misplaced sense of pride?  He watches me as I turn this over in my mind. Sighs again, drops his head—eyes to the sky. “I don’t expect you to understand. You’ve never had to—to worry about it.  Any of it. You’ve got a safety net—you can do whatever you want for a living.
“You’ve helped him a lot, while I was away.  He speaks highly of you.”
“Here we go,”  John says, shooting Sherlock a look that’s half grin, half cringe.  He flings the front door open to reveal Harry, sporting her own bright, beaming grin on her face and the most horrendous Christmas jumper he’s ever seen.  Her (still mostly blonde) hair falls just past her ears, a bit shorter than the last time he’d seen her.  She’s wearing her usual black skinny jeans and combat boots, but she looks—well, good.  Healthy, even.  “Harry,”  He says, a bit belatedly.  “Happy Christmas.”
Maybe it’s all been building up to this moment in time, lying on the floor side by side, each (finally!) seeing through the veil they’d pulled shut between them the very first night they met.
“Impressive,”  He says, whistling quietly.  Ben turns to face us, leaning back against the worktop containing his vast array of supplies.
“Let’s assume that’s true, then—that Mycroft isn’t full of it.  Why did he tell you now?”  John shifts, looking more than a bit uncomfortable.
what triggered the sudden wave of immutable emotion—but he hasn’t quite faced it yet.
Right on cue, my mobile pings from the kitchen table where I left it to charge.
She hadn’t been bold enough to give voice to these thoughts.  He’d brushed her off anyway, heading straight into her office and slamming the door behind him.
He kisses him again.
“All right,”  I say, because it is.  I understand—of course I do.  It’s just one of the many things he’s done to save me.  “You shot Hal’s brother. What do we do now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
we’re still changing in separate rooms and taking turns in the loo.  It’s all been quite innocent so far—and I’m not sure how to bring up the fact that I don’t mind in the least if we see one another in a state of undress, or let our hands roam beneath the confines of our pyjamas.  It seems that John may not be completely comfortable with the idea yet, so I’ve said nothing.
Flick open the button, whisk down the zip, free his solid cock from the confines of his pants.
Greg is no idiot.  He’s a bloody detective.  A good one, too.
,” He says determinedly.  I feign annoyance at his enthusiasm—groan dramatically and close my eyes.  He shifts his hips—a strategic move—stirring my wearied cock back to life. I try to ignore him, ordering my mind back into the depths of sleep, but I’m distracted by his persistent grind.  When I crack an eye open to glare up at him, he grins. Rolls his hips forward, back. Playing dirty. Leans down, down, to whisper seductively in my ear, “Happy Christmas.”
they’d said.  Interesting.
I want you too, John.  This thirty-one hour drought is the longest we’ve gone without jumping on each other since we began this thing between us.  One would think that thirty-four years of celibacy would have better prepared me, but now that I’ve got him, I want him all the time.
“No,” He breathes.  “I’m—not upset. I shouldn’t have walked away.”  He looks as if he wants to say more, but can’t quite find the words.  He reaches out for me, pulls our bodies together. We wrap each other up in a warm embrace.  I don’t understand any of it. We’ll have to sort it out in the daylight. For now, I hold him close and we sleep.

“All right?”  I glance up from where my head rests on my forearms, having dropped it at some point out of resignation.  The doe-eyed waiter hovers at my side, looking me up and down. “Your friend running late, then?” I scoff.  Late. It’s nearly half one and I haven’t gotten so much as a text message, let alone the man himself. Should have known he wouldn’t actually come.  It seems as though I’ve well and truly destroyed things between us this time. I’ve spent each of the eighty eight minutes I’ve sat here waiting thinking exactly that.
I shouldn’t be surprised that it was so bloody good—I shouldn’t be, but I am.  I’d expected there to be more of a mental barrier surrounding the fact that he is very much a man.  Thought it would take me ages to overcome it. But, alas—wrong again. And as it turns out, what I feel for him seems to defy such trivialities, now that I’ve let myself feel it.  I am constantly aware of the bond we have—in my inordinately romantic mind’s eye I picture our hearts connected by tiny threads, being pulled tighter and tighter as we’ve gradually let each other in.  The threads are barely visible, now. Soon we’ll be so closely bound that I won’t know where he ends and I begin. Perhaps we already are.
I start a pot of coffee and take a brisk shower.  When I return to the kitchen, John is standing at the worktop, milk and sugar in hand.  We have fried eggs for breakfast and smile at one another over our mugs as we quietly sip our coffees.
“Yes—yeah,”  Swallows again, watches as Harry grapples with a smile.
“What can I say, I have deep feelings for Mother Earth.”
“Did you hear my stomach growling or do you just know me that well?” He finally asks as we remove our coats and take a seat at the bar.
He moans into my mouth, hardening fast beneath my persistent fingers.  Good, perfect, yes. This isn’t meant to last. I break the kiss and drop swiftly to my knees, pulling him down with me until he’s sprawled across the stairs.
He takes a moment, leaning against the solid wood at his back—completely, utterly overwhelmed.  Rosie appears at his side, excitedly tugging at his sleeve until he drops his hand for her to hold onto.
“Hello,” Sherlock rumbles, breath gently ruffling John’s hair.  The crowd around them is shouting, cheering in a deafening roar.  Must be midnight.  He feels a light pressure on his temple and smiles to himself, wondering if Sherlock has succumbed to New Year’s tradition.  John turns, tucking his nose into the crook of Sherlock’s neck, tightening his arms around the man—probably to the point of pain.  He’s met with an equally desperate grip, the two of them clinging to one another in a silent declaration, the long-restrained warmth in John’s chest springing free and expanding wildly and irrevocably.
Is it, though?  Replaying the events of last night, I barely recognize myself.  Solve one bland case of a stolen dog and I revert right back to my old, manic ways?  Add a bit of alcohol and I’m suddenly entirely insufferable? I’d thought that I was beginning to change, grow.  But here we are.
The doubt remains.  He couldn’t even face him this morning.  He’d woken at dawn to Sherlock lying nearly on top of him, overwhelmingly warm, and snoring softly into John’s neck.  This is startling for several reasons, one of them being that he’d been a bit distant the night before, shuffling closer when invited, but keeping a fair amount of space between them.  And that had been fine, if a bit worrisome for John, who’s convinced himself that this will somehow end in regret.  He’d slid out from under him and made his escape to the kitchen to regain his bearings.
We share a grin as we fly around sharp turns with ease and laugh when we plummet down a steep hill and our stomachs drop.  In moments like this, I can only recall the good times we’ve had—the easy bond that we’ve shared from the start. I often think back and wonder what it was about him that allowed me to let him in so immediately—to show him a side of me that I obstinately hide from the rest of the world.  When I recall how entangled our lives became from the start, it’s easy to forget how off-kilter we’ve become.
The response is immediate and immense—Sherlock’s body coming alive in a way that would have dislodged John entirely if broad hands weren’t still clutching him close. He releases John’s bum to blaze a trail up his spine instead, tugging at his hair until John leans back.  Lips and teeth and tongue—barely a moment to process the hard, frantic kiss before Sherlock is falling back, pulling John along on top of him.
There really is a little shed there that they've named
“Nothing like that,”  He hesitantly meets my eyes.  “Look, I don’t know anything. He tells me to dump a vial of something into your coffee, and I do it.  That’s how it works with him,”
Of that, he is sure.
He huffs.  “Is that not obvious?”
is the protector, the shield, knowing full well that stature hasn’t got much to do with strength.  But Sherlock is strong too, and there’s no denying that the feeling of security this position brings is something he could get used to—a physical representation of the sudden turn his life has taken.  Secure.  Safe, even—to an extent.  He sighs, stretching his spine and then settling back in against the warm body in front of him.
times as a result of the work.  Will we never learn? Can no one in this world be trusted?  Henry shakes his head, staring at his hands where they lie on the table.
“Lestrade,” I say, in the tone that always urges him to divulge whatever he’s holding back.
Sherlock whips his set of keys from his pocket, several new ones now present on the simple ring he carries with him.  When the gate swings open, John and Rosie follow him through.  There’s a short pathway made of the same red brick as the drive, and trees towering over them on all sides, covering the entire space in cool shade.  Directly ahead is a cottage—
We spent the rest of yesterday evening wandering through shops and perusing the small farmer’s market.  We found a taco truck for dinner and walked down to the river to eat. We’ve always done things like this together, but now it’s different.  Now that he knows—without question—what he is to me, we’re never quite comfortable in each other’s presence. I can feel his slight unease whenever we’re alone together—it’s always there.  I just don’t know what to do about it.
Am I wrong?”  Hal’s voice is a poor impersonation of innocence.  What is he playing at, exactly? He’s clearly been trying to make John uncomfortable all night.
“No worries,”  She beams.  “Have a nice evening, then,”  She disappears without another word.  There was a time when he’d have accepted the invitation—would have jumped at the opportunity to spend the evening focussing on someone,
Without hesitation I fly out the door, dodging a dumbfounded Lestrade on the way.  I see John rounding the corner at the end of the hall, so I sprint in his direction, mind spinning, trying to process how this went so wrong so quickly.  I catch up with him a moment later as he starts toward the elevator. Grabbing his arm, I spin him around to look at me. “John?!” I’m a bit panicked, I realize, my heart pounding dangerously against my chest.  As he turns to face me, his eyes full of fury, I can only shrink back, thinking of the rage and fear and whips and chains that gave me this recurring panic in the first place. I take a step back and whatever he sees on my face causes his expression to shift instantly to one of horror and regret.  He covers his face with his hands, then drops them, steps forward and pulls me into a tight embrace.
“Mm,”  He shifts as Sherlock turns a bit, lifting his head to softly meet John’s lips before curling further into his chest.  John smiles, pulling him closer and settling in.  “Tomorrow.”
It isn’t long before I feel myself slipping away—sinking into sleep within his quieting embrace.  I feel his lips brush my temple as my mind goes offline—it seems I’ve found, in him—at last—a way to silence the noise.
“Don’t be an idiot,” John interrupts with a snort.  “That was no cat.”
“I don’t even know what was in that box, to be honest,”  John’s eyes widen slightly at that.  Surprised, then.
“Is it all right?”  Sherlock asks, looking mildly worried.  John lets out a burst of laughter, face immediately crumpling beneath the waves of emotion roaring through him—eyes suddenly stinging.  “Are you going to cry again?”  Sherlock’s tone is so serious, his expression so concerned.  John giggles, grabbing for his hand.
I press my lips to the top of his head.  Unlink our hands to wrap my arms firmly around him, holding him in place where he lies above me.  “So am I,” I say. And I am.
In a flurry of spatulas and wooden spoons, we dance around the kitchen until our opus is complete.  We dine together--the three of us. All smiles and bright eyes. A different day, a fresh start, a new beginning.
“You’re asexual,” John says, rather than let Sherlock continue to stammer on, but there’s a question in the words.  He’s not sure he’s got it quite right.  Sherlock nods, because while he resents the necessity to give it a name, it’s close enough.  “I guess I’d assumed as much.  Until recently, I’d been under the impression that you hated to be touched.”
“What on earth brought you to that conclusion?”  I find myself asking, taken aback by her candid words.  It’s unlike her to show so much of herself—or, well—at least emotionally.
“Why Morocco?”
“No, I suppose not.”
.  And either response would be true--but I’m here to solve my problems, not just to imply that I may have them.  “You know who I am? What I do?” He nods. No use pretending when my face is plastered all over the news. Will save me a lot of preamble.  I’ll be blunt. “I’m here because while I was off feigning death for two years, I was captured, tortured and interrogated. Even before that, I was living in solitude with a constant sense of unease.  Now that I’m back home, I’ve managed to find myself in a relationship with the man I’ve loved through all of it,” I pause, unsure how to phrase the last of it. “--and despite being hardly able to believe my good fortune--I’m a bit of a mess.” I conclude, lamely.  But that about covers it.
“Glad you could make it,” Lestrade walks toward us, snapping a dirty pair of gloves off of his hands and shoving them into his pocket.  “We’ve made next to no bloody progress since yesterday.” I flick my eyes around the modern kitchen we stand in. Clean, organized. I walk over, open the fridge, a cupboard.  Well stocked. I turn slowly, taking in each possible point of entry to the house—(front door, window, window)—pace through the open-plan living room—(window, window, back door, window)—the loo—(none)—and finally—
“Of course I do,”  He leans up, kisses him hard, weaving fingers through dark curls in an effort to keep him close.  Closer.  Never close enough.  “Of course I bloody do, Sherlock,” John breathes against his lips, before letting him go, watching as he straightens his spine, standing at full height but remaining within John’s orbit.  “This is something I’ve thought about for a long, long time—longer than I care to admit.  It should have been you the first time ‘round—though I know that neither of us was ready for this then,” It’s still incredibly painful to consider how much they had to go through together to find their way here.
“I—“  I cut myself off when he stands, takes a step toward me.  I look up at him with wide eyes as he wraps his fingers around my wrist and pulls me gently to a standing position.
“What are you suggesting?”  A lopsided grin begins to form on his face now, and I feel a bit flustered.  Unsure how to ask for what I want.
Oh, God.  Is this it?  Is Sherlock going to be the brave one, stepping over the line and walking headlong into this?  Or is that wishful bloody thinking and this is something else entirely—John inhales deeply, preparing himself for anything.  Preparing himself for the worst.
“Good morning, everyone,” I choke on the piece of toast I’d been in the process of ingesting as Mycroft strides in through the front door.  “I trust you’re all well?”

I scoff.  “Please,” Not sure I could ever fully explain that one to him.  But it certainly wasn’t love. Infatuation, perhaps. Something like that.  A compelling adversary. And she did have a certain--something--underneath the desperation and false bravado.  A certain warmth.
Perhaps he’s just cataloguing each sensation, quietly accepting what John has to give.
“Sherlock?” I’m pulled from my light doze.
he thinks resignedly, as he opens the familiar document, determinedly not reading a word of it as he scrolls to the bottom and sets fingers to keys, as he so often does.  As he so often
“John,” Sherlock begins, then clamps his mouth shut, squirming restlessly against their aged carpet, inching a bit closer, perhaps unintentionally, their arms now pressed together from elbow to shoulder.  John looks at him again.  Sherlock’s eyes are still closed, head tilted slightly toward him.  A line has appeared between his brows.  There is a hum of something potentially momentous building between them now.  John swallows.
His hands migrate down my abdomen until without hesitation, he grips my erection—stroking firmly, slowly.  I gasp into his mouth, eyes flying open. I’d known this was coming—of course I had—but I wasn’t prepared.  Couldn’t have known that his hands were capable of communicating more than mere words ever could. Couldn’t have prepared myself for this heady combination of overwhelming affection and physical pleasure that is now threatening to stop my heart.  He breaks the kiss, studying my face as his hands continue to move—one keeping a firm, steady rhythm along my shaft, the other gently tracing my jawline. A question in his eyes:
“I know that,” Her tone is gentle, kind without a hint of condescension.  “He knows it too, now.  He just wasn’t ready to accept it,”  She hesitates for a moment before continuing in a hush.  “He doesn’t think that he deserves you,” John’s heart sinks.
“Sherlock—things are good, yeah?  They seem to be good,” She peers down at me, waiting expectantly for a response.  I watch her for a moment. She actually wants to know.
.  Same as it ever was.
“Gentlemen,”  He says brightly, the two men turning toward us, smiling broadly.  “This is John and Sherlock. This holiday means nothing to them and they’ve still managed to show up,”  John and I share a look, eyebrows raised. Interesting introduction. Americans really are a bit odd.
evolving into a crushing, insurmountable mass with each day that they’ve ignored it, shunned it, let it steadily grow and get entirely out of hand.  Now Sherlock’s gone and shattered it into a hundred thousand irreversible pieces—
“I’d like to follow up with him about catering the wedding,”  He still gets a giddy thrill each time he says it—
He studies me for a long moment.  “It’s not—it’s not that I’m holding anything back from you.  You’ve made it very clear that you’re here to listen, when I need you to be,” He swallows, inhales deeply.  “And I love you for that. Mary made a fool of me. She was a liar and a fraud. The thought that I didn’t see her for what she was brings all the self-hatred that I had put behind me back in full force.  Any grief that I should be feeling for her is swallowed up by anger--and I don’t want to be that person anymore, not ever again,” He brings his hand up, smooths it down my arm and lightly takes my hand. “Above anything else, I’m happier than I knew I was capable of.  And madly in love, if you hadn’t noticed. I’ve been trying to focus on that, with you,” He looks away for a moment, and when he turns back he looks hesitant, wary. “I—have a therapist, you know. Ella. I stopped seeing her ages ago—when I met you, actually. But when you died, I—I’ve been going once a week for years now,” I’m not entirely surprised to hear this.  John has grown a lot in my time away. He’s more open and aware of his emotions than I ever knew him to be. I give him a small smile.
The case in this chapter is based on
His heart pounds out a frenzied beat against his breastbone, breaths heavy and nerves frayed—still, his legs carry him forward.  They carry him, without protest, home.
encouraged me to respond,”  A pained expression on his face.  He had called me an idiot for not pursuing her, but I had been grappling with the fact that I was falling in love with
“Eat,” We’re seated side by side at the rail on the front patio of a tapas restaurant—just down the street from our final destination.  It’s only eight o’clock, and we’ve still got an hour left of this strained conversation before we can go find Maude. I tear my eyes away from the people on the street I’d been deducing to glare at John.  “Please,” He adds. What does he care? Why must he mother me? I pop an olive into my mouth and return my gaze to the street. “Sherlock—”
Sherlock doesn’t respond.  John curls up under his gran’s old quilt on his mum’s old couch in his sister’s tiny flat and shivers himself to sleep.
“Hello,”  Sherlock murmurs, turning his head to peer up at him.
“And now?”  It’s John who speaks up first.  His voice is steady, determined to understand.  “Who’s side are you on now?”
He almost looks like he belongs here, in this bright, buoyant state.
Dinner?
“As I said,”  She’s addressing John, peering at him unwaveringly and unapologetically.  “I was playing for the wrong side. I won’t make that mistake again.”
The door opens straight into the main living area, bright and expansive—hundreds of squares of coloured glass form two massive windows that sit high on the back wall, casting their kaleidoscopic light across the warm wooden floors.  Directly below them sit two even larger paned windows that show off the flowering back garden, forming an explosion of colour when you walk through the door.
We decide to make homemade pizzas for dinner.  A far cry from our usual cuisine of choice, but Molly and Lestrade will be thrilled that we’re not forcing anything pretentious on them, and Mrs. Hudson has never turned down Italian.  We’re lacking a few ingredients so John offers to run to the shops for supplies. I again get a flutter of panic in my chest, thinking about hidden dangers waiting to snatch him away from me, but we have to part at some point.  I don’t argue.
“A new flat,”  John says abruptly.  “I want to get the fuck out of Baker Street, and I can’t afford to,”  Mycroft is completely silent for a full ten seconds before he speaks.
We’ve sat down for dinner, Lestrade finishing his long-winded explanation of the ongoing case that’s driving him up a wall.  A series of bank heists by a group known to the Yard as the Waters gang. Apparently they leave no evidence, always disappearing without a trace.  Boring.
I lie sobbing in John’s lap, now—curled up with my tear-streaked face pressed into his lovely burgundy jumper.  He’s wrapped his arms around me, holding me as I shake, chest heaving. “Sherlock,” He breathes. “I didn’t mean to upset you.  I only wanted to show you what you’ve always been to me,” His palm brushes across my back. Up, down. I hadn’t any idea that he had written to me while I was dead.  I can
He stares at the words, reads them several times, confused.  Looks down at his bag where it sits innocently beside him on this nearly empty train.  There is indeed a zip pocket on the side.  Too small to be practical, he certainly never uses it—has never really noticed it at all.  Slowly, he unzips the top, tugging it open to peer inside.  A standard white envelope, folded in half.  When he pulls it from the pocket he sees his own name scrawled across the front in Sherlock’s chaotic hand.  He lets out a shaky sigh.
you, John.  This is what I want,” He’s quiet for a moment.
“Not why I’m here,”  She says belatedly, wishing he’d look at her.  He’s stopped to lean against a light post, eyes fixed resolutely on the pavement.  After a moment, he nods.  “Come over for a cup of tea?”  She tries lightly, knowing that he’s only come here to avoid Baker Street and its ghosts.  Or
I’m pulled from my memories when a tiny piece of dumpling hits me in the cheek.  Rosie giggles, and she and John share a familiar grin. I know that look. They’d been trying to get my attention while I was far away, mind stuck deep in the past.  I raise my eyebrows—really, I’m still regularly surprised that I’ve managed to find people who actually want my attention. I’d spent thirty-four years of my life feeling certain that I could never have this.
“Yes they’re for you.  For
The room is large.  Considerably larger than the space Sherlock has chosen for himself next door.  Certainly the master bedroom, and entirely empty but for the floor-to-ceiling built-in wardrobes on either side of the window seat, mirroring the one in what his mind has now affectionately coined the Bird Room.
“Good,”  He says with finality.  John knows that he’s being teased—knows that particular tone of voice all too well—but curiosity is getting the better of him.
“Mm,”  Sherlock mumbles, already half asleep.
No but really this ended up being more soft smut.  Domesticity and household duties will resume in the next chapter (don't you dare think that I've forgotten about that slide installation).
I wave my hand around a bit, feeling suddenly quite buzzed, then take another long swig of my pint, chasing that feeling.
is all.”  He looks straight at me as he says this, a slight smirk on his face.  Hateful.
No longer willing to feign interest in this fatuous tripe, I set down my tea and slip my hand under the blanket—fingers trailing suggestively against his warm thigh.  He snaps his eyes away from the screen and they lock intently onto mine.
I sit bolt upright, toss the duvet aside.  Straight out the door and up the stairs. When I get to John’s (old) room I hover in the doorway for a moment, watching his sleeping form.  What was that, last night? What kind of madness overcame me? I hadn’t behaved like that in years.
He says, turning to Rosie, who looks a bit stunned but is nevertheless beaming up at him.
him—like this—
While they sit around the kitchen table, eating their pasta and sipping their drinks, Greg yammers on about the case he’s been working on for the last week, attempting to catch John’s interest with a gruesome murder, to ignite that old flame.  She watches quietly as Greg asks his medical opinion on various wounds found on the body and decomposition rates, then tries to tempt him into reminiscing about cases from their past.  It simply doesn’t work.  John nods and smiles, but mostly he stares down at the table and pushes penne around his plate.
he’s tired of hearing that.  He’d thought they were well past putting their feelings for one another into tidy boxes labeled with useless words.
—and she had failed entirely at her attempts to get through to him.  Of course it would be hard for him.  Of course it would.  It’s never
Sudden doubt.  A crippling wave of uncertainty.  Why? Oh. I’m entirely out of my depth.  Now that I’ve found myself in control, I’m rapidly losing my nerve.  John watches me falter, sees my hesitation as my hands slow and then stop.  He stares up at me, breathing steadily, then pulls me down against his body.  Lips on my temple, my forehead. Hands once again sweeping over my back—shoulders to tailbone—and I will myself to relax.
“Yes,”  He rasps, clearing his throat and beginning to walk again.  “All right.”  John smiles.
His mind is still back by the creek, if he’s being honest—his muscles still humming with the sensation of being wrapped around his best friend, being allowed into his space so wholly.  Whatever that was, it was new for them.  They’ve embraced before, sure, but not like that.  This time was intentional.  A statement.  Each time in the past that Sherlock had permitted such a thing, John had been mid-breakdown—a perfect example being the scene in the kitchen earlier today.  He can think of just one other time when Sherlock had willingly hugged him, and he was a blubbering mess on that horrible occasion as well.  And then there was the wedding—but that—he tries not to think about that.
“I miss you,” She says, her expression turning serious.  She’d said this yesterday, as well. It
Sherlock couldn’t find the energy to be annoyed with his brother’s meddling.  John had begun coming around after that.
—from anything he’s experienced before.  “Anyway, it clearly doesn’t matter much that we’re both a bit out of our depth,” Sherlock gives him a small smirk.  John reaches for his tea to hide the flush on his cheeks.

Now I watch Rosie picking apart a dumpling and eating only the bits she deems worthy.  I smile at her discerning nature. It will serve her well in life. Meanwhile, John is shoveling spring rolls into his mouth, looking down at his jumper as several flaky crumbs tumble onto his chest.  When he glances up and sees me watching him, he grins.
“Blaas in the oven, dear.  They’ll be done in a tick,”  She infuses as much cheer into her voice as she can muster, though the look on his face does not make that an easy feat.  She bustles around, digging jam out of the fridge and snatching the butter dish from the worktop to place on the table in front of him.  She can feel a certain tension in the air.  He has something to say, and she’s not sure she wants to hear it.  Busying herself with the dishes, she keeps her back to him, checking the rolls repeatedly, though she knows full well that they need another ten minutes.
I’ve been

interested in this conversation.  I raise an eyebrow.
“Ah,”  Sherlock drops his hand from where it had lingered cupping John’s jawline.  “I see.”
John’s mind supplies the well-known, well-loved, much-sung and oft-listened to lyrics.  His feet carry him forward until he stands just before the man who’s currently accosting his senses from every bloody angle and gently pressing at the tender ache in his chest.
to live again.  But god, now this.  Now, it seems, it’s only a matter of time.
John is still sleeping soundly when the sun begins to rise.  He looks quite young when he sleeps. Face smoothed out and free of worry.  I wake him by sitting at his side, running my fingers along his temples, through his hair.  He stirs when I press my lips to his forehead, then the space between his eyes. “Time to get up,” I whisper when his eyelids flicker open.  “
In his mind’s eye they don’t look like lovers.  They don’t look like flatmates or colleagues or two grown men lying on their sitting room floor either, despite the reality of it all.  They look like children, maybe—confused but aloof—two humans with an indefinable relationship, who don’t much mind the perceptions of others anymore.  They look like two people whose fates have been woven together rather quickly and quite irreversibly through many shared traumas and some sort of unnamable bond.
“I’m trying to say—I don’t know how far I can go with this.  I don’t know if I can be everything you want me to be,” I don’t want him to be anything he’s not.  I only want him to be
She chimes enthusiastically, then immediately yawns, stretching her arms upward, hands balled into tiny fists.  “With honey.”
And thank you to everyone who's left such generous, sweet comments.  They genuinely have brought me back around to writing.
“All right,” I smile. “Come on, then,” I grab him by the wrist and hoist him out of his chair.  We plop down on the couch, and without hesitation he pulls at my shoulder until I’m lying with my head in his lap.  His fingers go straight to my hair. “You like this.”
“Defenders?” He immediately looks down to hide the flush rising up his cheeks.
I completely lost control.  What if I hurt him? A surge of dread rises up into my gut.  I’d never let myself go so completely before. I open my eyes.  John is dozing, breathing steadily below me. I slide off of him to lie at his side—propped up on one arm, I watch him carefully.  Run my palm down his spine, then back up, up, brushing through his hair with my fingers. His eyelids flicker open.
Sherlock hijacks his phone, staring intently at the screen, scrolling up and down through the photo gallery repeatedly, reading through the
“Now what’re you grinning at?”  Harry has resurfaced from her bedroom, staring in mock horror at John smiling softly at his mobile with a tear-streaked face.  She shoots him one more look of disgust, followed by a quick smirk as she drops down in the armchair opposite, elevating her ankle on the coffee table with a groan and a cringe.  “You look like a swooning bloody princess.”
I push him back, climb on top of him, watching as his eyes go dark.  He likes this—being dominated. I’m surprised. Delighted. I let my fingers drift over his chest, thumbs circling his nipples, feeling them peak beneath my relentless touch.  He stares up at me, panting quietly, a startled moan escaping as I run my palm over his (leaking) cock.
We retrieve our luggage from the (conveniently open) boot, and head inside, glancing out the window as the car drives off the moment we shut the door behind us.  All right, then. I take a second to wonder if they have taxis here, before being promptly distracted by the interior of the cottage. It’s a bit larger than it looks from the outside—high ceilings with wooden beams, packed bookshelves lining the walls, a large sectional sofa and a flatscreen television mounted over an antique credenza.  Decorated tastefully—full of character, bright and warm. We meander into the small kitchen, poke our heads into the loo. Glance at each other a bit awkwardly when we confirm that there is indeed only one bed.
Whatever was in that box was something that belonged to Sherlock—something that Molly had kept, had wrapped up and tucked away and given to John in a moment of desperate hope and a bit of pity.  Whatever it is, she now fears it may send the man even further over the edge.  Or into the abyss.  Or out to sea.  It’s unclear where John’s head is, these days.
John has gone on exactly three dates since Mary’s death.  He hasn’t told me about them, but he knows that I could see the signs each time.  Each halfhearted endeavor to find someone new has failed, with zero interference from me.  It’s been over a year now, since his last attempt at dating. Perhaps he’s given up. I haven’t asked.  He’s an excellent father to Rosie—she seems to be his main focus, these days. Rosie and the work are what he has now.
“Happy Christmas.”
“One is encrypted, we have a team working on it now.”

“Talk, then.”
“Thought you two might like a cup of joe,”  He says, smiling broadly. I lift my head from John’s chest to see him rubbing the sleep out of his eyes—just waking up, then.  “Sorry to wake you. Late night?”
Why hadn’t the bastard spoken up sooner if he was unhappy with their life together?
The three of them sit in contented quiet, John letting his eyes drift shut and his mind wander.  He’s beyond grateful for this life that they’re building together—this domesticity that’s always come so easily, but now with all the rest of it properly acknowledged and potentially given a name.  He decides to draft a new blog post for the public.  Perhaps less of a love letter and more of a you-were-right-about-us-all-along.  It’ll be a relief to live openly.  A final nail in the coffin of unnecessary shame that has plagued him for most of his life.
“What?”
He’s never touched John, not really.
“Well if you must know, until very recently I’d assumed he was asexual and probably also aromantic.  I wasn’t about to turn our friendship into an impossible, embarrassing mess over my own one-sided attraction.”
me.  “But I think I’m ready to try.”
“Anything else I can get you, lads?  Tempt you with a lovely panna cotta?”  Their round, frilly-aproned waitress hovers at the table’s edge, stacking their empty plates in one hand and gesturing enthusiastically toward the dessert case with the other.
He can’t help but laugh.  He’d assumed Sherlock was well aware of his attraction to men, as John had nearly thrown himself at him and then vehemently denied it during their first case together.  He hadn’t even been conscious of what he was doing, not really.  The attraction was so immediate and so unlike anything he’d experienced before.  Everything about Sherlock is unlike anything he’s experienced before.
I step forward, grab his arse through his trousers and roughly pull our hips together.  He backs me up against a strong wooden potting table and begins a slow grind, pinning me between his body and the hard surface behind.
—anticipating.
“Sherlock,”  His voice is quiet, contemplative.  “What is it that you want?” He’s been quite direct tonight.  Not holding back. “From me, I mean,” I know what he meant. I’m hesitant to answer that.  I want whatever he can give me. Anything. All of it. But I refuse to put any more pressure on him than I already have.
The case in this chapter is inspired by the horrifying case of
Ceasing his combing of damp curls, John moves the thumb of his left hand to the crease between Sherlock’s brows.  Another known pressure point.  He waits for Sherlock’s pained scowl to relax a bit under the pad of his thumb, then presses firmly, moving in slow, tiny circles.  His fingers move to do the same against the man’s other temple, both hands deftly working in unison to create what is likely an overwhelming distraction for the great brain beneath them, if nothing else.
seeing what I could get away with,”  Sherlock says plainly, apropos of absolutely nothing.  John rolls his head sideways against the wall to look at him.
they say.
When they crawl into bed later—after several rounds of cards with Harry, after hearing about her recent struggles with sobriety, her new sponsor, her new love interest and the slightly nicer flat she’s hoping to move into next week—John is grateful to be alone.
John says nothing, plopping a tea bag into his mug and turning around once more.  He takes a moment to study Sherlock, who is fidgeting a bit, slowly turning the stolen cup of tea between long fingers, staring right back at John as though willing him to understand what he’s actually trying to ask.  John is at a loss.  Sherlock has never shown any sign of annoyance at the term, but John is quite certain that he doesn’t actually
“John,” Sherlock hasn’t looked away.  John lets his head fall to the side once more, doesn’t allow himself to break when their eyes lock and hold.  “You know now.”
But all that’s there is relief.  Relief, affection, gratitude. Everything I feel for him, reflected sincerely back at me.
, as they so enthusiastically referred to their planned outing.  Not really my scene, but--at least for now--where John goes, I follow.
“Oh, wow,”  Molly breathes.  Then:  “Oh—wow,” When she sees the two of them cuddled up on the sofa, blinking themselves awake.  Her smile is rather unsettling.  She’s got her mobile out and several photos snapped before either of them even realize what’s happening.  Sherlock lifts his head to glare.
John lets out a moan that turns quickly into a stunned shout as my shaft settles deep within him.  My eyes go wide before I clamp them shut—completely consumed by the feel of him. Surrounding me. Despite our preparations, he’s
“Thought we’d decided to go easy on him.”
I pace around the living room of 221B, as I’ve been doing for the last hour and a half.  John has been determinedly ignoring me, seated in his chair with his nose in a book. Probably one of the absurd mystery crime novels he’s dug back out now that his own detective has come back to life.  He’ll need them to entertain himself if my insolent brother continues to prevent us from taking part in any of the interesting cases--
“I think that if I don’t try to move forward, he will grow to resent me.”
