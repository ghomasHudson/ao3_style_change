Greg put a hand on Sherlock’s knee. “So concentrate, then. Who is doing this? Help us find him. We’re at a dead end with Pearce. Unless we want to believe an eight year old kid set this up.”
He knew how to leave Mary, he’d been doing it since the moment Sherlock returned. But how could he leave his child? Where did one learn to do that?
, laughed when they found out about the pregnancy. She drank him under the table, and fucked him on top of it. And Mycroft bloody Holmes had nothing to say about any of it. This was between him and Mary.
Kate rolled her eyes. She was going to die in London. Probably in this flat. Probably on this couch. Just because these two idiots kept confusing actual life threatening situations with the plot of a regency romance novel. She looked up and John had crossed the room and was standing above Sherlock’s chair.
The screen morphed into icons against a screenshot of the London Eye. She sat up, leaned her elbows against the arms of the chair, and went to work. She was wide awake now. She finally had something tangible to work with.
“Yes.” He looked around, people were starting to stare. He couldn’t do this to his sister. “No. Let’s go inside.” He looked back at Lauren and Harry.
She wrapped her scarf around her neck and buttoned her coat. She had one hand on the door knob when she stopped and turned back. “John? You can stop worrying now. He’s fine. Everything’s going to be fine.”
Sherlock sank into the only chair in the room and leaned forward, head in his hands. John rested his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and felt him lean into him. “Sorry,” Sherlock said, his voice shaking. “Sorry.”
I dream about my mother kissing me good night. When I ask her if she loves me, she hugs me tightly and whispers in my ear, “To distraction, silly boy.”
A shadow crossed his face. “I always hoped I was reason enough. I miscalculated. ” He cleared his throat and continued. “No matter how much he protests otherwise, he is still tied to Mary. I have little experience in this area, but I’m not naïve enough to believe that he never loved her, that part of him still doesn’t love her. And John has a strong sense of duty, of responsibility. To Mary and the child.”
She thought about Chloe, waiting at home, probably fixing dinner, or finishing paperwork, or sneaking in an episode of Real Housewives of Some Dumb City . . . she smiled thinking how fast she always reached for the remote when she heard Kate coming through the door. Dreck, that stuff. Chloe was fascinated with it – told Kate it reminded her how lucky they were. How good they had it. Their life seemed perfect in comparison.
“Sherlock, there’s something useful in that brain of yours, I know it. Can’t you wipe the knowledge that it’s John and reboot yourself?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and continued speaking in a low voice. “It is imperative that Mary believes that her secrets are safe, that you have forgiven her.”
Sherlock lay crumpled on his side on the floor outside the door, one side of his face painted the colour of blood. Only it wasn’t paint, was it?
At the rehearsal, he’d offered to walk Harry down the aisle, but that had only set her off on a ten minute rant about patriarchy and white male privilege and how, since she didn’t belong to anyone, no one needed to give her away.  “You’re the best man, arsehole, your job is to keep track of the rings and make a brilliant speech at the reception. Do I need to write it for you?”
“Don’t lie to me –” John shouted, his fist slamming into the table, almost splintering it. “You said things. Things I chose to believe . . .”
Sherlock smoked three cigarettes on the way to Earl’s Court. He googled David Sutton. Boring. Pedestrian. Looked up his latest scientific articles on PubMed. The one thing that gave Sherlock a glimmer of hope was the fact that Sutton had written an article last year for the Sunday Times about famous Victorian poisoners. The leap from that to shooting John in the leg was cavernous. But in the absence of any other leads, it was a leap Sherlock was willing to consider. He looked at his watch.   Almost midnight.  He tore the watch off his wrist and stuffed it into the pocket of the Belstaff.
She smiled at him and picked up her pen and notebook. “Okay . . . how have you been? I read the newspapers – your detective is back and you’re married to the nurse you met at the clinic. I recall you were just getting serious when you stopped seeing me. How’s that working out?”
John stared, his brain stubbornly refusing to draw conclusions, to understand. He turned and left. Walked stiffly to the corner and caught the first bus that came by. He didn`t know where it was headed, anywhere was better than here. Half an hour later, he got off and hailed a cab back to 221B. The cab turned the corner onto Baker Street and he felt the familiar tug in his chest. Ever since Sherlock had first shown him the flat, he knew it was where he belonged. It was where he felt safe. It was where the nightmares had finally dulled to white noise. It was home.
No matter what Sherlock’s rationalisations were, John was still hurt. It was a hurt he knew he’d get over eventually, but the question was still there – as brilliant as his plan may have been, how could Sherlock have gone through with it? How could he have lain on the pavement, while John . . . He closed his eyes against the memory.
Kate went into the kitchen, took plates from the cupboard and opened a bag. “I brought Indian. Hope that’s alright.”
“God,” John managed, his erection flush against his trousers. He stood up facing Sherlock on the opposite side of the bed, his fingers scrambling to get his shirt undone and trousers and pants off.  The hotel room was chilly and he shivered as the cold air met his hot skin. They fell back onto the bed together and Sherlock drew a wet line of kisses along John’s collarbone and John thrust his hips, rubbing their cocks together. Sherlock wrapped his warm hand around John’s cock and brushed his thumb over the tip.
“It’s just that I knew Sherlock was dead on his feet and he’d end up back in hospital if I didn’t get him to lie down.”
Sherlock held a glass under the tap. John walked behind him and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s chest. Laid his head against Sherlock’s shoulder.
Greg came around the desk with the slip of paper. “Yeah, I know. Mycroft rang. And now there’s this.”
The clerk pointed to a hallway to the left of the main lobby. “Your room is in the back, facing the woods. Non-smoking. It’s a lovely suite.”
I stare at myself in the small mirror over the sink and trace the lines around my eyes, the grey in my beard and I wonder what Sherlock would think if he could see me now. Does he still imagine me the way I used to be?  When he holds my face between his hands, does he catalogue the wrinkles and creases?  Does he know I limp when it rains? That I only pretend to eat what he calls his special stew?
She opened her computer and read through the files again. She recognized just how flimsy the evidence looked at first glance. It was hard to put into words the feeling she’d had – a kind of electric hum – the first time she’d stumbled across a possible link between Moriarty and the dead MP, Peter Goodale. The police had never identified a suspect and had always assumed his murder was a carjacking that ended badly. “Does a carjacking ever end well?” she’d asked the detective who’d led the investigation ten years ago. She sighed, closed the computer and tried to shake off the feeling that Sherlock Holmes would see her for exactly what she was. A complete amateur.
John wakes early and stares up at the ceiling he can't quite see in the dark, and thinks about the day ahead. Breakfast first, then he has to pick up Sherlock’s present in town.  He’s found an early edition of John Hooke’s
Sherlock had one, but he wouldn’t – couldn’t – ask it so he shook his head and walked away.  At the lift, he leaned against the wall, found his phone and dialed the lab. He could only communicate with Molly by text or phone. Face to face, her sympathy enveloped him like fog and he couldn’t breathe. She picked up on the second ring.
. No spaces.” Sherlock paused. “Lestrade’s team is going through my old cases – looking at anyone who was just released from prison, that sort of thing. I believe he –”
She felt a surge of pity for Sherlock. “Why are you protecting her? I can’t imagine you’re doing this for John.”
“Nice outfit, sir,” the driver pronounced solemnly as he held the car door open for John. “I’ll turn up the heat, shall I?”
An hour before it was time to get dressed, she pulled him into her room and showed him the pearl necklace she was going to wear. “It’s the something old bit. It was Mum’s, do you recognise it? Wanted to show you first, so you can get any blubbering out of the way. You’re a sentimental twat sometimes.”
Sherlock dips his head and sucks on my bottom lip. I press against him and cup my hand around his neck. He pulls me closer and slides his tongue into my mouth. He also knows how to shut me up. Just when I am about to pull him to the floor, he releases my mouth, his hands on my shoulders.
Mrs. Hudson joined her at the sink. “It’ll do you no good to wonder about that one. He’s been a mystery since he showed up at my husband’s second trial – calling the prosecutor an idiot, stealing the trial notes – I thought he’d escaped from the mental hospital.”
A week later they got a case. Lestrade roared up the stairs with a file and a mission. Two dead prostitutes, one dead vicar. Three missing left thumbs.
John reached into his pocket for his mobile. “That does it.” He held the paper out to Sherlock. “I just saw you last night. You know what the bloody date is.”
When Sherlock saw the gun and the small hand holding it, he estimated the probability that the boy would actually try to shoot him at less than 10%. In the unlikely event the boy pulled the trigger, he estimated the probability of being hit, given the distance between them, at less than 2%. So he stood his ground.
me. For the last year, you wouldn’t even allow me in your house. You blocked my texts. In the parlance of relationship nonsense, this is what I would call progress. ” Clearly, Sherlock had interpreted John’s enthusiasm a few minutes earlier as just shy of a marriage proposal.
We’ll never trade the set of Harry Potter books we found in a cupboard in the kitchen. Neither one of us had ever read the books or seen the films. I meant to, but had never gotten around to it and Sherlock of course had never even heard of them.  And as proof that the universe still has a sense of humour, the last book was missing. When we’re bored, Sherlock and I like to guess how it ends.  Sherlock insists that Harry and Voldemort must die, or else what was the point of it all? I think it will end well, though I fear for Snape’s life. I can’t believe he’s quite as wicked as he seems.
“Mrs. Hudson?” Even as he said it, he knew it couldn’t be. She’d been gone almost twenty years now. He’d attended her funeral. Wept real tears.
“Sorry, sir.”  He transferred the pile of Sherlock’s dirty clothes from the chair by the dresser to the end of the bed and sat down. He was two sizes too big for the chair and he sat on the edge, looking uncomfortable.
John came out of the kitchen with his cup and sat in his chair. Pulled out his phone. Shook his head and held the phone up to Kate. “Mycroft. He’s called at least a dozen times. I’m surprised he’s not calling you too.”
Sherlock stood up straight. He shoved his hands into his pockets to keep from hitting someone and let Mycroft do what Mycroft did best. Suggest everything, promise nothing. Soothe without substance. Speak above and around and between until there is nothing left for the opponent to do but give in.
The nurse, clearly not happy to be intercepted, removed her latex gloves and dropped them in the waste container by the door. “Not my patient. You’ll have to ask at the desk.”
They slid into a corner booth near the kitchen. The waiter dropped two menus on the table and kept walking. Two half-filled glasses of tepid water followed a few minutes later.
She was beginning to understand his methods too. She rocked back on her heels, thought for a second. “You’re keeping tabs on her. Cloned her phone. Probably hacked her computer too. You know she didn’t send the text because you would have seen it. ”
Now it’s Sherlock’s turn to bump into me as I stop to let that particular image go. It would be so easy . . .
“I know my brother’s methods. Once he is clear of here, he will attempt to negotiate an exchange with Magnussen, a détente, if you will. He is working under the misguided notion that Mary matters more than –”
The burning sensation crawling up John’s chest had nothing to do with the poison.  He swiped Sherlock’s hand away and shakily stood.
Sutton pointed his gun at John and Sherlock shouted and leapt toward Sutton. Sutton moved his gun back to Sherlock and he saw his finger squeeze against the trigger. Sherlock dove left, covered his head and closed his eyes.
As they turned the corner onto Baker Street, two things hit Sherlock at the same time. There was a familiar car from the Yard in front of 221 B, and John had slowed to a crawl. He turned back to John.
“He’s not dead,” he said out loud to his reflection, just to know how it felt to be able to say those words and have them actually be true. He switched off the bathroom light, and went to bed. He had no idea what was going to happen next, but for the first time in a long time, not knowing didn’t feel like standing on the edge of a cliff, waiting for the next strong wind to send him crashing onto the rocks below.
and her long brown fingers flew when she talked. She was nervous, stumbling over phrases like hepatic encephalopathy, serum aminotransferases and bilirubin levels.
John looked down the alley and suddenly Sherlock appeared beside him, pushing him up against the wall.  John felt the press of the bricks against his back and Sherlock’s curry-tinged breath across his face.  John didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.  Then Sherlock’s lips were on John’s and he was kissing him, his tongue in his mouth and all John could think was that he didn’t know how it happened, but he was kissing Sherlock back, and it was fierce and hot and nothing, nothing like kissing anyone else.
Sherlock looked at John as if he were a dog that had suddenly learned to speak. “You’re happy about this? I don’t understand – ”
She’d texted home that she “got nothing.” Sitting alone in her hotel room later, typing up her notes on the laptop, she realized that wasn’t strictly true. Sherlock’s reaction to hearing the missing girl’s name – Anna Ashcroft – was strange. As if he’d suspected something and her name confirmed it. And why had he sent John out of the room first? And why was it impossible to find a decent pizza in this town? She tossed the take-out menus back in the desk drawer.
He closed his eyes and the patter of the raindrops against the train window pulled him back to another time, another storm.
Sherlock ignored him and continued typing. John folded his hands in his lap. He stared at Sherlock’s head. He looked at the picture above the fireplace. Unfolded his hands. Sighed.
His sympathy was fading under Sherlock’s refusal to admit he’d made a colossal mistake. “I can and I have. I am sorry.”
“Then it won’t be hard to do this. Stay away from John until the job is finished. Another six months, a year at most. Surely you can wait that long.”
John followed Sherlock through the bedroom door and stopped. Pulled his hand from Sherlock’s. Sherlock continued toward the dresser, turning on the lamp.
He rolled his eyes. “I shall retire the day a simple Google search replaces the science of deduction.”
She threw him a dirty look, grabbed the file she’d been reading earlier and took it back to John’s chair.
The black sedan idling at the kerb ten feet ahead should have surprised him, but didn’t. He stopped, hands on his hips. Kate was right – his life
Read out loud like that it sounded nothing like Chloe. She leaned forward, elbows on her knees, head in her hands. “I am an idiot.”
John answers that he’s quite sure it’s all going to be marvelous. Sherlock’s fingers tap out S-O-S in Morse code against the frosted window.
Instead he leaned forward, his hand curving around the back of Sherlock’s head, smoothing though his hair. Sherlock pulled him closer and kissed him. As if it was the most natural thing in the world, as if no time had passed and they had always been standing together here in the middle of the living room of 221B. Kissing.
Sherlock retreats and I collect the rest of her information. Her name (Charlotte Ivan), her sister’s name (Fiona Miller), sister’s mobile number and employer (Shipton Building Society, Holborn). Because it
Sherlock held up a hand. “That case was a three at the most. Even John would have solved it.” He smiled. “Eventually.”
John shook his head and laid his empty glass on the table. He bent forward and cradled his head in his heads.
“Hardly.” Kate sighed and tugged at Sherlock’s scarf, still around her neck. “I guess I should go and let you two have dinner. And you probably should stop at Babies “R” Us or something.” She smiled at the look of terror on both their faces. “Good luck. With everything.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand again, held it to his chest. “I know.” He lifted John’s hand to his lips. Kissed his palm.
John returned with a pillow tucked under one arm. “He’s asleep,” she said, trying to hide the disappointment she felt.
No one spoke. John concentrated on his drink. Sherlock concentrated on watching John drink. Kate concentrated on not banging their heads together.
The morning before the wedding, John reluctantly dropped off a sleepy Rosie at Molly’s. “It’s only three days,” Molly said, pushing him out the door. “Go, or you’ll miss your train. She’ll be fine.”
He's angry with me. He says I've given up, and I have, but not in the way he means. I've given up pretending that anything else matters but here and now and him.
“You’re late,” Sherlock said when she entered. He was back in the leather chair. “And you brought coffee. Excellent.” He held out one hand and she reluctantly handed it over.
He thought about borrowing Harry’s Volvo, but then he’d have to explain where he was going and why he was going, and most importantly, why he was going alone.
John understood then that Sherlock had always been there, in the corner of his mind, in the tracks of his memory, right there close enough to touch. He held onto him, trying hard to steady his voice. “Where else would I go?”
“Until we know exactly what’s causing this, all we can do is manage the symptoms.” Her tone was apologetic, sincere. Pessimistic.  “His breathing has become more laboured over the past hour, so we are considering intubation. We’re still hoping a liver becomes available, but the longer we wait . . .”
that makes bloody sense, that actually points to a way out of this, I am going to see my wife.” He held up his hand as both Kate and Sherlock opened their mouths. “No, you don’t get to talk. It’s my life, Sherlock. My wife. I have to fix this somehow. My way. I have to . . .”
The smell of peppermint was doing odd things to John’s stomach, but he forced himself to drink a little.
Toronto. New city. New job. And in three months, if she survived the wedding, a new wife. Everything she wanted. Sometimes though, it was all a bit . . . much. So she escaped to The Scone Witch to drink tea and eat scones and just breathe.
She leaned forward and tapped on the glass, trying to get the driver’s attention. “Stop the car.” She looked at Mycroft. “This is bullshit. Stop the damn car.”
Sherlock did the washing up while John wrote up case notes from the clinic on his laptop. After he was done, he made tea for John and brought it out to him.
Kate was tempted to follow her, to shake loose whatever else she knew. But just then Sherlock’s phone vibrated. She looked down at the text –
“Thank you.” In her head, she ran through the list of reports and proposals she’d submitted in the last few months.
Charlotte Sinclair, or Dark Raven, as she asked to be called, sat in John’s chair, sipping John’s tea. Sherlock paced between the door and the table. John sat in Sherlock’s chair, trying not to notice the girl’s dirty fingers wrapped around the teacup. The way her leg was always in motion, the sores on her arms, her perfectly straight teeth.
Sherlock takes my shoulders and spins me around. I really just want to tackle him to the floor. It’s become a problem – shagging in inappropriate venues. And the supposed murder scene of a supposed whistle blower is surely inappropriate.
Bryant. Fixing them some kind of weird celebration/condolence breakfast. Surely Sherlock would never allow . . .
Greg rolled his eyes and pulled away from the curb. Kate stared up at the windows of the flat, hesitant to go in. Greg was right, if she crossed the threshold, she would be forever tossing her hat into the ring. She’d be firmly picking a side. Thankfully, Mrs. Hudson opened the door, took her suitcase and hustled her up the stairs.
She walked back into the room and handed John the scissors. He took them and turned his attention to Sherlock. He quickly stitched the gash and covered it with gauze and tape. He shined a light into Sherlock’s eyes and grabbed his wrist, checking his pulse. Pressed the back of his hand against Sherlock’s forehead. “You’re warm. Maybe we should restart the antibiotics.”
The shot helped. The charge nurse shooed everyone from the room except Sherlock who refused to leave. Over the next half hour, the pain in John’s belly went from a paralysing nine to a manageable two. Sherlock retreated back to the window, staring outside. It had started to rain again.
She took a nervous sounding breath. “Sherlock and Greg dismissed Bellamy as a dead end. But I don’t think he is.”
Mycroft took a step in front of Sherlock’s chair, and looked down at John. “Tommy Pearce came home from Afghanistan with a giant chip on his shoulder and developed a nasty heroin habit within six months. He was found dead three weeks ago in an alley in Brixton, heroin overdose.” Mycroft paused and turned to Sherlock, raising an eyebrow.
John nudged Sherlock over and climbed into bed, turning on his side, an arm over Sherlock’s chest. “You’re an impossible child.”
The room depressed him. The bed was unmade, the old blanket and single pillow lay across the sheets like an afterthought. After Sherlock had died (John had never learned how to switch out “died” for “fallen” in his head), he’d stripped the walls, packed his boxes, drawn the curtains. Moving back into this room had left him with the odd feeling of falling back in time. Back to the wrong time.
Her phone vibrated in her pocket and she pulled it out. Probably Chloe. Maybe work. She didn’t recognize the number, but answered.
“I knew you’d understand. Apparently Anna’s work is very confidential. For the government, you know.  She told me not to tell anyone she was here, but I knew you’d want to know.”
The pub was just the same. Same cracked vinyl chairs, same greasy tables, same pickled eggs. Same jar, most likely.
“Oh, come on, you know what I mean. If this were just some case I brought you – some random poisoning of some random citizen . . .”
John said, “Kiss me, for fuck’s sake,” and even though you knew it was because he wanted you to stop talking about trace elements and carpet fibres and blood types, you kissed him and it was brilliant but it was all teeth and harder than it should have been and you bit John’s lip just to hear him gasp.
Surprisingly, it was Sherlock who kept the interview going. "This is coming to a point soon, I hope.”
“No, I just don’t feel like playing anymore.” John leaned against the table. “So, are we taking the case?”
Dr. Reynolds. Their doctor. In Sussex. He could feel the information in his mind palace shifting, reorganizing, rebooting. Suddenly there were entire files on Sussex, Dr. Reynolds, bees, John . . .
"If I agree, will you help me to my chair? This visit is the first interesting thing that’s happened in ages. I may have been shot, but I will die of boredom if I’m forced to lie here much longer.”
Sherlock takes a long sip of tea, staring at me lecherously over the cup. The lecture won’t last long if he keeps that up and I am about to tell him so, when he sighs and puts his cup down.
St. James’s Roman Catholic Church was cool and dark and smelled like candles and furniture polish. John followed Sherlock to a pew at the back of the church, genuflected quickly and slipped into the empty seat. Outside the confessional, an old woman waited her turn, her white hair covered by a red polka-dot scarf tied at her chin. A teenage boy, who looked like he was on his way home from a football match, waited behind her. “Small boys, small sins,” Father McCrory had always said before giving John his penance. All it took were three Hail Marys and a few words from the priest to wipe the slate clean. But that was before Afghanistan. Before Sherlock. How many Hail Marys would he need now?
She stood and wiped her eyes. She ran a hand through her hair, squared her shoulders and knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door.
John returns from his "talk" with Mycroft. John and Sherlock have a conversation. Kate tries to stay out of the way.
“Probably,” Sherlock says. “You never did learn how to keep still.”  His hand opens and closes around John’s cock. “Like now.”
“I don’t know. I doubt it.” Sherlock stood unsteadily. “But a timely visit to an out of town cousin may be in order.” He got as far as the fireplace, stopped and put a hand against the mantle to steady himself. He leaned forward, breathing hard.
“Stop moving.” Sherlock put both hands in front of John’s head for protection and John stopped struggling and placed his arms on either side of Sherlock’s chest. He felt an odd giggle percolate in his throat and he let it escape, nudging Sherlock’s hands away from his face with his head. Sherlock just looked at him, not moving.
“I arranged to meet you at the Scone Witch because I wanted to tell you about Sarah. I also told you we didn’t know where was Mary was.”
“Yeah, looks like Kate beat me to the take-away. Taj Mahal?” Greg smiled. “The naan was right out of the oven.”
He fumbled to turn on the lamp, his heart racing. In an instant, the room went from night to day. Everything was where he’d left it, the bottle of Jameson’s on the table, his overnight bag by the door, Sherlock’s scarf folded on the sofa. Sherlock standing at the window, a lit cigarette between his fingers, staring out into the darkness.
John tried to keep his voice calm. “Did anyone actually talk to Pearce? Or is all this theoretical?”
John leaned over and kissed him again. Slower this time. He stopped, sat up and unbuttoned his shirt and tossed it on the floor beside the bed. He stood for a minute and stepped out of his pants and jeans.
The M4 was busy so he didn’t make it to the hotel until well after lunch. He thought more than once about turning around and going back, but to what? He needed to at least try to make a life without Sherlock.
Greg’s heart ached for him. They’d been through their share of shit together, but he’d never seen Sherlock so . . . defeated.
“I missed you too.” He smiled. “Ask my therapist. You cost me a lot of money.” John lifted one hand and reached across the space between them. He brushed a stray curl off Sherlock’s face. “You need a haircut.”
After thirty minutes, Sherlock turned and held out one arm. “Now, John. All of it.” And with far less bravado, he added, “Please.”
“Their parents? I don’t know why it seems so odd that Sherlock has parents. Everyone has parents. Are they –” She wasn’t sure how to put it.
“Yes, I remember.” John unlocked the door and held it open. “Fine, fine.”  He was too tired to argue.
The oil lamp sputters and the room is dark. We fall asleep, his foot pressed against my ankle, his hand against my back.
They shook hands briefly. “Sherlock’s forgotten his manners, I’m afraid. I’m Simon Lockwood. An old friend.” He glanced at Sherlock. “We were at uni together. And you are?”
Sherlock nodded slowly and let John lead him back to bed. He stopped, and John thought he’d changed his mind.
Something Pearce said to him once was nagging at the back of John’s mind. It would probably turn out to be nothing, but at the moment, it was all he had.
He’d been back at the flat since the night he’d found out the truth about Mary. He knew he’d have to make a decision eventually, but until then . . .
The episode ended (exactly as Sherlock had predicted) and John carried their empty plates out to the kitchen. “Tea?” he called back at Sherlock.
He leaned down and softly kissed Sherlock. Sherlock pulled John down on his chest, whispering, “See, I feel better already.”
going to cry in front of Sherlock Holmes. “Chloe’s French. From Montreal. Her English is really good. Better than my French.”
“Fucking hell . . .” Kate squirmed in her chair. It had to be telepathy. She hadn’t said a word. “Contrary to your giant ego, I came to see you about Moriarty.”
“Oh, right. Hold on then.” He went to the keypad on the wall by the door and punched in a series of numbers. Sherlock pushed open the door.
They ate side by side on the sofa, plates balanced on their knees, watching The Great British Bake Off. Sherlock found it surprisingly entertaining even if it was clear from the outset who would be the week’s star baker. John chose not to be enlightened. Typical.
John gave up the struggle and sat on the edge of the bed, his hand still held in Sherlock’s. “What do you want, Sherlock?”
He paid the bill and drove her back to the hotel. He parked in front of the hotel and held up his warrant card when the doorman told him there was no parking there. “Sorry, sir.”
Sherlock gave the taxi driver the address of Wing Fa. He saw John’s surprise; they hadn’t been there since the night John shot the cabbie. Sherlock stared out the window, tapping his fingers against his legs, reveling in the breathing, living thing that was London, cars like blood vessels speeding towards the heart, the hum in the concrete, the beat like a pulse beneath the pavement, the warmth of the buildings.
What if Mycroft were right? That Sherlock’s shooting hadn’t been a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time after all? What if Magnussen
“His flat’s about forty minutes from here in decent traffic, but I’m afraid there’s been a change of plans. He can’t see you today.”
He reached down and slid his pants off. Sherlock rolled away for a moment, tossed his pants to the floor and rolled back. They fell back together, as if that moment of space between them had been too much. They pushed against each other, every bit of skin touching, ragged breaths filled with a need long buried, hot and desperate kisses, the friction threatening to overtake them as they thrust against each other, slick with heat.
It’s a snowy Christmas Eve in Inverness when they arrive. Harry picks them up at the airport and doesn’t complain that their plane is three hours late and they’ve missed the dinner she spent all day preparing.  She’s pregnant again, almost six months, and it looks good on her. When she meets them at baggage claim, she looks beautiful, and John has to swallow before he leans in and kisses her cheek, pulling her into a rough hug. He asks how Clara is and she laughs. “Busy. Tired. Happy about the baby.” She tilts her head to grin at Sherlock and John’s glad they agreed to come.
“You weren’t outside, so I decided to park the car. We can talk here as well as anywhere.” He sounded annoyed.
She waited on the sidewalk for another fifteen minutes, during which she managed to convince herself that she had given the London office the wrong terminal, the wrong time, the wrong day. She was in the middle of sending another text –
Mycroft could only breathe a little, but it was enough to push out the words, “Oh, do make up your mind, John.”
We rise early now. He brings me tea and we drink it by the fire. For an hour each morning, before the pain grabs hold, we have our old life back. It's enough to see me through. He understands that now. When we lose this time, this one good hour, which will happen soon, I know, we’ll learn to say good-bye. One heartbeat at a time.
Vic Bellamy lay on the crumpled sheets, face up, eyes open, arms outspread, greasy grey hair fanned out on the pillow around him. An open envelope of white powder and a bent spoon lay on the nightstand. A needle, half full with what John guessed was heroin, protruded from his left arm
There was the smell of bacon. And no Sherlock. And the smell of bacon. Even his pedestrian deduction skills could suss this one out. Was he going to find Sherlock in the kitchen, cooking bacon in a proper skillet, apron wrapped around his naked ass? Did three of his best fantasies just merge?
“Good lord, John. I always thought these sorts of places were apocryphal. Who would suspect that people actually pay money to drink here?” He used a handkerchief to pull out the chair. “May I?”
She looked at her watch. 5PM. Wondered how long it took to get to the airport from here. She would need an ATM. And roses. This trip was going to bankrupt her. She made a decision, collected her purse and briefcase, and walked down the stairs and out the door.
“Oh, for the love of God. You didn’t force me to choose, I chose a long time ago. The only thing keeping me there was the fact I couldn’t allow a psychopath to raise my baby.”
The grip around his neck loosened and the car door held open for him. John looked back (and up) and his pride was relieved to see that Anthea’s replacement was clearly military – tall, wide and well-trained. John straightened his jacket and stepped into the car. The door closed and Mycroft smiled at him.
Kate rolled her eyes. If this were a novel, she’d toss it against the wall because it was too ridiculous. She turned and walked into the kitchen. Found the scissors under a box of microscope slides and a badge case. She opened the case.
Six months turned into twelve turned into eighteen. Each time he thought he was approaching the finish line, Mycroft moved it further out of reach. “New evidence,” he would say and Sherlock once again found himself on a plane to a new cover, new city, new country.
“Oh, John,” she said, refilling her glass. “It’s not in your nature to be happy. You must know that by now.”
Sherlock sputtered something and sat back in the chair. Both Greg and Kate busied themselves with the cartons of food.
“OK, no tea.” He laid a hand on her arm and she jerked away. “Just sit and tell us what’s happened.”
She didn’t recognize the voice. Older woman. Maybe from the 2005 homicide she’d started on last week. Young woman, found in Nepean, strangled . . .
“Then it’s settled.  For as long as I can manage it, we do this together. I need to get dressed, hand me my trousers.” He reached back to untie the hospital gown.
John kissed her on the cheek. “I don’t know what’s worse.” He squeezed her tight and whispered, “I’m sorry about Sarah, Kate.”
And then Sherlock did something unexpected. He lifted his hand and cupped John’s face. He stroked his thumb along the ridge of John's eyebrow, let his palm glance across his cheek. Sherlock stilled his hand and looked into John's eyes.
Sherlock leaned forward. “What do you plan to do with this . . . insight . . . about Mary? You must know you’re not the first person who has stumbled upon the truth?”
John was stationed in Afghanistan when his when his father died. He understood nothing about death by then, except that it was random and cruel and inevitable.
He nodded and stepped out of the car and went to the back to open the trunk. He was not what she expected a British cop to look like – clearly, she’d been watching too much PBS. This one was more George Clooney than Inspector Morse.
She wasn’t sure if he meant leave the hospital or leave London. Both, probably. “I will. When John gets back.”
John closed his fingers around Sherlock’s wrist and swallowed hard. He was worried his voice would shake. “Yeah, I know.”
She nodded and turned away, then stopped and looked back at him, “This is your fault, you know. You made him believe it was all a great game – chasing murderers and solving puzzles – he was besotted with you. Head over bloody heels. Did you even notice?”
The black sedan was still parked in front of 221B. She’d noticed it earlier when she’d looked out the window while waiting for Sherlock to change. As she closed the door behind her, the back door of the sedan opened and a man – tall, well-dressed, familiar – stepped out.
“My turn to offer condolences.” He looked at Sherlock again. “My sister’s reserved a private room at the Savoy for lunch. She’s going to play mater as long as she can. Why don’t you come? Bring Tom of course.”
He choked again. “Why didn’t you say it wasn’t tea?” He wiped his mouth on his sleeve. “Wait. Is this my Glenfiddich?”
Sherlock covered John’s hand with his and pressed it against his chest. “A new scar for your collection.”
Sherlock poured a cup and took it to the table. He moved aside the newspaper to make room and saw the cigar box lying open underneath. He closed it quickly and set it on the counter behind him.
She rearranged the file and re-tied the blue ribbon. She paid the bill and stepped out into the snow. She was suddenly inexplicably homesick and leaned up against a blue Volvo, its windshield covered with frost. Her bare hands sunk into the snow on the hood, and she felt her fingers numb and freeze. Something twisted in her chest and she half-sobbed, covering her face with her frozen hands. “I miss you so much, Sarah.”
She’d requested this case three months ago. Her superintendent in the Cold Case Unit had told her to submit her proposal in writing – so she did – ten pages of annotated and footnoted brilliance that was half fact, half conjecture. For weeks she waited for him to at least acknowledge he’d received it. When he didn’t, she added “useless fucker” to the long list of reasons why she hated him. Other offenses included his taste in ties (red, always red), the way he slurped his coffee, and number one on her list for the last year, his refusal to even consider her transfer request to Toronto.
The figure in the door moved slowly into the room and sat down in the armchair opposite the bed. Graham stirred, then settled back to sleep. Sherlock breathed carefully, his heart racing, and lifted his hand slowly towards the lamp.
Sherlock started to explain something about the old patterns and the balance of probability, but John held up his hand.  “She called me,” John said.
It took Sherlock a month in Bogota to do what had to be done. His cover, as an expat Brit looking to make less than legitimate deals in software security, certainly suited his complexion. Mycroft, who had laid the groundwork ahead of Sherlock’s arrival, added a recently deceased wife to his backstory. It was cruel, but it gave Sherlock an excuse to act as miserable as he felt.
Sherlock bent down and kissed him. John reached up and pulled Sherlock closer, letting every remaining bit of doubt wash away in the heat of this moment, and it was about as close to perfect as either one of them was ever going to get.
Kate sat facing him in Sherlock’s chair. John sipped his tea and looked past her out the window. She turned on the phone, scrolled through the texts, and tried to come up with something to say. Something safe that wouldn’t piss him off or let some secret slip. She’d never cheated on any of her girlfriends, but she imagined this must be what it was like. She had so much to keep straight – John didn’t know about the baby, but he did know Sherlock had cloned Mary’s phone and was having her followed. She couldn’t remember if she’d told either of them that Mycroft admitted that Mary worked for him too. She knew for sure that John had no idea just how much Sherlock loved him.
Sherlock heard a noise from the kitchen. Both he and John turned as the noise became Mrs. Hudson, carrying the vacuum, a red tea towel draped over her shoulder.
She recognized the BMW as it turned the corner. He didn’t get out this time, just leaned across the front seat to open the door for her.
“It’s Jim. Jim from IT . . .” he began in a voice she didn’t recognize, but was stopped by a coughing fit that became progressively more violent. John circled behind Sherlock’s chair and leaned over him, one hand supporting his chest while the other rubbed circles on his back.
Sherlock snorted. “Faith. You of all people should know faith is irrelevant. What we need is a line of inquiry – a misstep – a small deviation in his plan. And we will find it.”
“If your sister insists on inflicting her children and their pedestrian desserts on us, there needs to be wine.”
“She found the heroin connection.” Sherlock’s shoulders dropped. He scraped a toe along the carpeting. “She tried to tell me . . . “
Sherlock pulled back and looked at John. “But now I need you to think about everything you know about Pearce – his time in Helmand, his associates, his habits . . .”
“I promised to behave so I will,” Sherlock says. “It’s my Christmas present to John,” he whispers, loud enough for John to hear.
He was two beers and twenty pages in when he lost his struggle to stay awake. The papers slid noiselessly to the floor and his head dropped to his chest. When Mrs. Hudson came up to check on him two hours later, she gathered up the papers, tossed the empty take-away container and left him to sleep.
Kate waited until she heard the bottom door slam, then went back to the kitchen table and lifted a small container from the take-out bag. “Cookies, anyone?”
Sherlock turned and pulled John to his chest. The smirk on his face made John’s chest feel hot and his concern fade. Sherlock took one of John’s hands and pulled it to his mouth. John’s eyes closed as Sherlock kissed his palm.
It was John’s phone alarm, going off at six am in the pocket of a pair of trousers lying somewhere between the bedroom and the living room, that woke Sherlock the second time. He nudged John awake, then breathed a sigh of relief that he was still here. John groaned and slid out of bed. A long thirty seconds later, the alarm stopped.
After ten minutes, she realized that, unlike Sherlock’s, Mary’s phone was a digital filing cabinet. Hundreds of songs and pictures. Twitter, Dropbox and Facebook accounts. Forty names on her contact list. She’d completed 130 levels of Candy Crush, had downloaded every version of Angry Birds. Two episodes of
Sherlock stared at the empty coffee cup on Greg’s desk. Greg wished he could figure out a way to coax the sociopath out of the man. It was obvious to him that Sherlock was drowning in emotions – probably unfamiliar and unwanted, but this was John. The tether to the hot air balloon. Greg didn’t want to think what would happen if John . . .
Ella’s phone buzzed and she glanced at the screen. Looked at John. “Apparently we’ve gone three minutes past our appointment time.”
Kate looked at Sherlock, who sat back heavily in the chair and closed his eyes. She wanted to punch John. Didn’t he understand what he did to Sherlock every time he said that?
. She wondered if Lestrade knew Sherlock had his credentials. She wondered why she didn’t walk downstairs, hail a cab, and catch the next flight out of Heathrow.
Kate wondered how much whiskey it would take before Mrs. Hudson would tell her everything. Everything she knew at least. “Yes, that’s why I’m here. Partly . . .”
“I accept the compliment. Now, I know you are just waiting to spring more questions upon me so . . .”
“Christ, how old are these? It’s like biting into sawdust.” He got up and drank from Sherlock’s cup.
. And what did Sherlock do with that information?Took a header off a rooftop in front of him. Let him grieve for two years. Let him marry someone else.
“World’s worst timing, Sherlock,” he shouted. “Too bloody late.” He turned and headed down the steps.
“Do you ever dream about Sherlock?” she said. She’d clearly waited a long time to ask that. For two months they’d pretended that Sherlock’s death wasn’t the reason he was back here.
“On your kitchen table. And if you start rubbing your hands together in glee or some other kind of bullshit, you will never see it.”
John sighed loudly. “Yeah, okay.” He hurried to catch up. “You did notice it’s raining?” He turned up the collar on his jacket.
A strange noise escaped him, as if the air had been sucked from his lungs and burst from his throat. His military training, ingrained on a cellular level, kicked in and he was off the bed and across the room before Sherlock had turned from the window. He stood, fists at his side, breathing, willing his brain to confirm the sight before him. He watched Sherlock stub out the cigarette, and take a step forward.
She opened the link and stared at the page, smiling.  It was an entry (a rant, really) about the exorbitant price of infant formula. But what interested her more was the picture at the top of the page. It had been taken in front of the fireplace at Baker Street. John stood, holding Violet, who had a firm grip on what looked like a tiny skull. The front of John’s shirt was covered in . . . something. Mrs. Hudson stood next to John, beaming, with a matching stain trailing down her blouse. Kate zoomed in and examined Mrs. Hudson’s hair. Yep, a piece of peach. Or pear. Hard to tell.
But then last week, after she’d finally accepted that her proposal was dead, in the middle of her investigation into the disappearance of two women from the Akwesasne Reserve five years earlier, he called her back to Ottawa and into his office.
Sherlock slid his hand down John’s chest, reveling in the feel, the smell, the familiar of John. His John. This life. Their life. Together.
When they broke apart, their gasps were loud in the deserted alley. Sherlock was pressed up hard against him, his leg shoved between John’s, rocking against his erection. Sherlock’s hands clutched at his hips, at his trousers, at his arse.
John took one arm and Kate ducked under the other shoulder and they carried/dragged a shaky Sherlock to the couch. John walked into the bathroom and came out with towels and a first aid kit.
“It wasn’t easy, but the budget approval just came through.” He paused and she realized he was waiting for her to thank him.
When they pulled apart, John’s hand was pressed high on Sherlock chest, just below his throat, feeling one of Sherlock’s collarbones with his thumb. He slid his hand down Sherlock’s chest and felt the outline of his scars through his t-shirt. John realized then he was looking for the changes in Sherlock, the same way Sherlock had searched his face a moment ago.
John had come home with the puppy five years earlier. He said it was for Sherlock’s birthday, but he was the one who’d always wanted a dog. From the start, Bella tolerated Sherlock, but loved John with a devotion that stalkers could only aspire to.
He shrugged. “I guess. I’m going to lie down for a bit.” He sat on the sofa and rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. He lay back and was asleep a few moments later.
He’d also become his sister’s special project. After years of infrequent phone calls and even more infrequent visits, his grief had mobilised her into action. It was unexpected and unwanted and after six week of sessions with Dr. Thompson, mostly unwarranted. John had stepped back from the ledge and was once again doing what he did best – carrying on.
“You were away for two years. Did anyone know the truth?” the reporter asked. She was young and eager and held the microphone in front of Holmes, staring up at him as if he were Jesus Christ risen from the dead.
“Sherlock Holmes. Of course, of course. I thought you looked familiar. I’ve seen your website – your work is fascinating. We can talk in here.” He led him into a small office opposite the lounge.
In the living room, she checked her watch. Just past one. “John, that restaurant downstairs? The sign said they do sandwiches. How about I get us a couple? Compliments of the Canadian taxpayer.”
The door blew shut behind her and when he got up and looked down the hallway, it was empty. He turned on the light in the hall and returned to his bedroom.
You hear footsteps in the choir loft above you and for a short stupid second, you think you’ve been followed, but logic tells you that’s impossible. There is no one left to follow you.
“But please, John, for Sherlock. Just read it. You’re upset now because of things you didn’t know. I’m giving you the opportunity to acquire that knowledge. To make a decision based on what you know, not what you think you know.”
He had no idea what she was talking about. She looked at him strangely and changed the subject. “You’re staying with Lauren and me and her parents, God help me, at the house tonight but we’ve booked rooms at the venue for everyone tomorrow night. You can use Lauren’s car while you’re here.”
“Mostly. Just don’t expect too much. And do as John says. You piss off his keeper and you’ll be back on the street before your tea gets cold.”
. She’d kill for a cold can of Diet Pepsi. She walked over to Sherlock and held out one hand. He ignored it. “Mr. Holmes. Inspector Kate Bryant. RCMP Cold Case Unit. Thank you for seeing me.”
She sat opposite him in John’s chair. She knew he wanted her to go away, but she didn’t have much time before John came back.
“Girlfriend.” Sherlock slumped back into the pillow. “Of course. This morphine makes me dull.” He looked hard at Kate. “Murder?”
He leaned over and opened the night table drawer. Empty pill bottles, two pencils, a credit card. And tucked in the corner, a yellow and black striped bracelet, like the kind hospital patients wore. He took it out and stared at it a minute.
“What indeed . . . I fear she has stirred up quite the hornet’s nest. She has far more in common with Sherlock that you might imagine.”
A loud ping stopped Sherlock’s typing. They both looked toward the window. Another loud ping followed by an even louder whistle compelled Sherlock out of the chair.
. He scrubbed a tired hand across his face. He’d just finished another long shift at the A&E. He needed to go upstairs and shower and change. He’d also promised Mrs. Hudson he’d move some boxes for her.  The same boxes he moved for her every few days. He understood it was her way of checking on him, and he did his best to be patient. He wasn’t the only one missing Sherlock.
I gasp and my knees almost buckle as he slips his other hand under my belt, and down my pants, almost reaching my cock, straining against all the fabric.
Sherlock paused when he got to the top of the stairs. He could hear someone in the kitchen and opened the door to find Lestrade, filling the kettle with water. He took three cups from the cupboard and set them on the kitchen table. “John’s gone up to change. I suggest you do the same.”
He breathed slowly, willing his brain either back into REM sleep or up into actual consciousness. As he ticked off any number of reasons for this neurological episode, he heard the sound of a Hoover clicking on, faint, but familiar. He held a breath as he listened for what he knew would be the turning up of a transistor radio, adding to the noise. Why Mrs. Hudson couldn’t just wait until after the hoovering to listen to her music . . .
He nodded, not sure how he felt or what else there was to say. “Next week, then,” he said, looking for something to break the silence between them.
Sherlock backed up to the middle of the room, holding up both hands in mock surrender. “Do you plan to hit me again?”
When there was no answer, she leaned down and grabbed John by the arm. “You need to go upstairs and make sure he’s all right.”
He sat in his chair, logged on and found the blog. He scrolled down the page until he found March 28th. John must have posted the entry this morning while Sherlock was still sleeping. He skimmed it – John’s writing skills were appalling – how he managed to make a living as a crime novelist, he didn’t know. There were several comments – from Harry and Mike Stamford and a few other names he didn’t recognise. He knew he’d written a comment but he couldn’t find it.
He understood that happiness was a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken. So he learned to hoard small moments of joy—John’s laugh, a puzzle solved, his bees in summer. He saved them like collateral to borrow against in hard times . . .
Sherlock smiled. He was an arrogant ass. “I am not on drugs, Mycroft. You have at best a mediocre police force that needs to be shepherded all over London on a lead. So be a good brother and go away.”
The lift doors opened and he was about to step in when Harry stepped out.  She squared her shoulders when she saw him, wiped her eyes. He had put off telling her, but not for the reasons Lestrade had accused him of. Telling her to come was admitting he couldn’t fix this. He stepped into the lift and held the doors open with one hand.
But tonight, he’d sit in his chair and finish the last of Sherlock’s best whisky. And tomorrow, he’d begin to learn how to forgive himself for all the things Sherlock had done.
Kate’s phone buzzed. Which just made her more angry. She glanced at the screen – an alert from Air Canada that Chloe’s flight was an hour late. This day was never going to end.
The vicar reappeared two weeks later.  He was leaning awkwardly against the wall, holding two Starbucks cups in a cardboard tray, when John stepped out of a cab in front of the flat.  “I thought –”
Three shots rang out. Sherlock opened his eyes to see Sutton pitch face first into the carpeting. He turned around to see John collapse into Bank’s arms. Sherlock kicked the gun away from Sutton and crawled back toward John.
Together, they made a plan. Fiona would go on holiday and Maureen would report her missing after two weeks. Before Fiona left, they set up the crime scene at her apartment together. Maureen would meet two weeks later in Portugal. Knowing Washburn’s assets would be seized when he was arrested, they planned to live off love and Maureen’s small inheritance from her grandmother. Life was less expensive there. The police, already suspecting Washburn of extortion, would also charge him with Fiona’s murder. And to be sure that everything went according to plan, Maureen hired Sherlock Holmes and scattered crouton-sized bread crumbs for him to follow. Cue the happily ever after music.
Thanks again to peg22, my very own cheering section and Greek chorus and everything else I could have ever wished for.
And as always, to peg22 for holding my hand and filling in all the empty spaces on the page and in my heart.
But he still has one weakness. Biscuits. So I’ve learned to bake. I collect recipes from magazines and borrow cookbooks from the library. One afternoon, not long after he came home, Mrs. Hudson walked into the kitchen, saw what I was trying to do, and took pity on me. She rolled up her sleeves and taught me what “creaming the butter” and “folding the batter” meant. We made lemon shortbreads that day – biscuits that have set impossibly high standards for everything I’ve attempted since. I glanced over at Sherlock in the middle of a bite and I’d never seen him look quite so happy.
“English, yeah?” Greg ran a hand through his hair. “Anything we can use? Like a fingerprint on the dart, maybe a chemical map to the whereabouts of these arseholes? I’ve seen Sherlock pinpoint a suspect to within a block just by scraping dirt off a pair of trainers.”
“You know him. I’d say it was a fair chance he’s pissed off someone who has the knowhow to manage this, wouldn’t you?”
Only John wasn’t lying. He really hadn’t come here to confront Mary. He just wanted to see her, talk to her, and convince himself that he hadn’t imagined her. He needed to remind himself that whatever else she had turned out to be, she was also Mary – the woman who blushed when he called her beautiful, cried when she watched
They headed back to the street, almost running, the puddles splashing up around them, the sound of their laughter swallowed by the rain.
Sherlock brushed John’s hand away. “I’m fine.” He struggled to swing his legs off the bed. “I require a cup of tea and a shot of morphine.”
“Yeah, I read your report. But Moriarty’s dead, has been for more than two years now.” He shook his head. “You’re chasing a ghost.”
He rolled to a sitting position, careful not to disturb the miracle between his legs, and noted as he did the continued lack of any pain whatsoever. He reached for his cane, and came up with nothing. He sat up straight and stared at his dresser. His old dresser. His dark blue dressing gown hung on a hook on the door. He didn’t own a dark blue dressing gown. Not since . . .
“Just listen. Is there any way Mycroft could know the baby isn’t John’s? Would he tell him if he knew?”
A long four hours later, after a dinner of roast not-beef and curried vegetables, a series of  speeches (John’s was surprisingly brilliant, and although not maudlin or sad, it still made his sister cry), he made his excuses (tired, headache, estranged lover/best friend waiting in his room) and took the lift upstairs. He stood at his door, unsure what to expect. That Sherlock would do what he did best – disappear, send a cryptic text – or maybe he meant what he said about changing and was actually waiting for him.
Sherlock stood in front of the wardrobe, fingering a purple silk shirt and admiring his taste. God, he missed having somewhere to go. “Fancy a little dim sum?”
“Because I don’t know what you’re up to and I know it’s all going to come crashing down around us and despite that, all I want to do is take you into the bedroom and fuck you for the rest of the day.” He leaned in and kissed Sherlock hard on the lips.
Sherlock stands at the end of the bed and slips out of his robe. Yes, he still managed to find a robe. It’s terrycloth and says Manchester United on the chest, but it’s a robe. And when he turns away from me and it hangs at his elbows, and he gently shakes his arms and it falls to the floor, I am hard in a moment. I tear off whatever clothes I have on like the fire brigade.
She let go of the bannister. “We both know I can’t really stop you. Not forever. Probably not even for an hour. But we need to talk about what will happen if you show up and throw Moriarty in Mary’s face.”
Sherlock stood and turned to face John. “Yes, it is the most ridiculous, ill-advised, shortsighted thing the two of us will ever attempt. I predict the probability of failure at an all time high. The presence of Mrs. Hudson adds a scant twelve percent on the positive side, but that doesn’t really swing the pendulum any closer.”
I duck under his arms and walk to the apartment door. “I’m not convinced Fiona Miller was murdered anywhere. I think Fiona is exactly where Washburn says she is – on a beach in Portugal. Probably right now in the company of one Charlotta Ivanovna
They talked for the next few minutes – about how Mrs. Hudson’s Bakewell tarts would fare on The Great British Bake Off and a cold case file Lestrade asked Sherlock to look at. All the while, Sherlock did his best not to touch the dusk-coloured mark on John’s neck, just above his collarbone.
John perched on the edge of the bed facing him. Sherlock crossed his legs and his hands moved to their usual position, fingers steepled, elbows cocked.
” folder.  He managed to delete twenty or so before he closed his laptop with a sigh and leaned back. He’d need to go a lot further than Edinburgh to get through them all.
He continued to cough, a terrible wet sound. He lowered his hand from his mouth and it came away bloody. She felt useless, standing there watching Sherlock struggling to breathe. If John didn’t call 911, she would.
Sherlock started to speak but was interrupted by a coughing fit, more violent than the one she had witnessed the day before. John moved quickly to Sherlock’s chair, leaning over him, rubbing his back, talking calmly to him. “It’ll be okay. Just try to breathe.”
The woman sits, hands in her lap, worrying the zipper on her handbag and waits for him to say something. Finally, she retrieves her billfold and counts out five £50 notes. “Is this enough? I can get more.”
She held up the can. “I’m good.” Kate walked back into the living room. She felt even more out of place than ever. John puttered in the kitchen, waiting for the water to boil, and she stood halfway between Sherlock’s chair and the door. Her suitcase was shoved behind the couch, her purse stuck under the coffee table, her Diet Pepsi cans standing in a perfect row.
Sherlock’s phone vibrated and she dug it out of her pocket. Chloe. She was in Montreal with her mother – which Kate knew she would pay for later. She felt better than she had in days when she read the final bit of the text –
Sherlock slowly pulled himself out of his chair and moved to sit beside John on the couch. It left him sweating and breathless and she knew from the way he was holding one arm tightly across his chest that he was in considerable pain. His other hand rested on John’s leg.
John rolled his eyes and waited as the server brought two glasses and two bottles of Tsingtao. “I said, do you think Moriarty shares a connection with Shan that we missed?”
She’d retrieved her belongings from the hotel and called Greg. Nothing was missing – well, nothing except two pairs of panties. She didn’t want to think about what that meant. Greg had picked her up from the hotel, fed her a decent breakfast, and dropped her and her suitcase at 221B after a dozen sidelong glances and a few hundred words on why staying with Sherlock was a rubbish idea. How it would compromise the objectivity of her investigation . . .
“Your son was well on his way to ruin before he met John.” Sherlock reached across the desk and grabbed Sutton by the collar. “What’s in the poison?”
“Fine. Vacant lots on either side of us.  A park bench covered in graffiti. No trees. One building that escaped the worst of it.”
“Talk to me about this pressure point,” Kate said. John was throwing her dirty looks, obviously wanting her to wrap this up. He emptied the glass into the sink.
Harry touched his shoulder and he opened his eyes, she was telling him to come back inside. She had black smudges under each eye and he was touched that she had been crying, if not for Sherlock, then for him. He held out his arms and she stepped into his embrace. It was only later, during the reception in the church hall, when he heard her talking to Sally Donovan about “that selfish fucking bastard” that he realised it had been the rain, not grief that ruined her makeup.
Sherlock shook his head. “When I was . . . away . . . I couldn’t tell you because it was too dangerous, and then it was too late.”
John froze. Because it dawned on him that he had been three steps away from ravaging Sherlock in his sleep. And also because that voice, the one he’d heard countless times in his dreams, the one he thought he’d never hear again, raked against his chest, making him hard in a moment.
“I suppose.” John didn’t look convinced. “Shouldn’t we talk to Lestrade?” He moved his plate away from Sherlock’s hand.
lies open on the night table. Chekhov? I pick it up and thumb through a few pages – God, how I hated that play. As a sixteen-year-old, I played Yasha in the world’s worst production of
Kate stared at both of them. What the hell had happened here since she left? They almost looked . . . happy. They had no reason to be happy. Nothing had changed. Unless . . .
Some nights, lying alone in his room upstairs at 221B, unable to sleep despite the whiskey, he had let himself imagine a life with Sherlock and the child. A girl, he thought. Emma or Claire or perhaps Violet. After his grandmother. He saw her at three or four, blue eyes and blonde curls, sitting on Sherlock’s lap, one small hand resting against his cheek. Harry had done that when she was young, nestling into John as he read to her – first the Peter Rabbit books, then the Paddington series, and later, although she was perfectly capable of reading it herself,
I dig my phone out of my pocket and push a cup and a file off the menu for Taj Mahal. “Well, if that’s not the cherry on the top of this day. I’m now quoting Mycroft.” I shake the menu at him. “Last chance. Order or shut it.”
Damn. “Sure. Past my bedtime anyway. Good night.” She slipped past John, grabbed her suitcase and headed upstairs. She paused when she heard John speak.
“Good morning, John.” Sherlock murmured into John’s ear ten minutes later. His legs were stretched across John and his fingers were laced through John’s hair.
Harry was waiting for him at Edinburgh’s Waverley Station. She didn’t complain (too loudly) that she had to park four streets away and traffic was shite and she’d thrown up twice that morning, “
“She asked if you and I were – well, you know. It seemed important to her, for some reason . . .” He looked up at Sherlock. “You don’t give a shite, do you?”
Her head hurt. She stood and stretched, and found some aspirin amid the loose coins at the bottom of her purse. She dry swallowed four pills and pocketed enough change to buy a large coffee at the cafeteria.
Sherlock inched a bit closer to the desk, keeping his eyes on Sutton’s hand holding the gun. “How much?”
He felt an arm tighten around his neck and the point of something hard press into his back. He was carried back to the car a few inches off the ground, gasping and choking.
Sherlock took a taxi home, stopping under Vauxhall Bridge to set things in motion. He was dismayed to find that no one had ever heard of Freddy the Torch, but he found three familiar faces he could trust. He realised he was running against an unseen clock of his own making. Each step smudged his past – the present – which would in turn fuck up the future. Or would it? He opened the window and let the smells of London refocus his resolve. It all hinged on one fact. One string to be unraveled so it all could be set right.
And when Sherlock asks, John will find he’s lost any ability to speak so he’ll nod and Sherlock will kiss him long and slow like they have all the time in the world.
She went still and felt the pieces sliding into place. She came back into the room and sank into John’s chair. “Oh my God. It was Mary, wasn’t it?”
Inside, after hugs all round, Harry collapses into an armchair by the fireplace and Clara leads them upstairs to the guest room. The room is small and narrow but the bed is big enough for both of them and it’s covered with a faded patchwork quilt John recognises from his childhood. He pauses at the door and asks Clara, “How is Harry? Really?” They both know he means “Is she coping?” Harry hasn’t had a drink in almost five years – not since before the twins came along – but the question’s always there, simmering beneath the surface of things. Sherlock throws John a disapproving look – it’s one of the few things he and Harry have always had in common – living down past sins.
The bride was what she expected – not beautiful, not young – mid-thirties probably, attractive in that straightforward, familiar kind of way. The bride and groom looked genuinely happy. So how did John end up living back at Sherlock’s only a few months later?
John waited for Greg to add the word “really” at the end. It seemed everyone did that now. As if the question wasn’t sincere without it.
I pull the drapes closed and the room is black except for the green glow from the clock radio on the nightstand. He sprays the bed and a few seconds later, large splashes of bright blue luminescence appear in the centre. It only lasts a minute and the room is dark again. He sprays the floor beside the bed and there is a large ring of luminescence around a dark unlit centre.
“Stop all your melodramatic posturing, John.” Sherlock stood in front of him, in a t-shirt and pants. “You’re drunk and I’m practically an invalid. We both need sleep.” He turned and slowly climbed into bed.
He’d done it. He felt his chest grow warm. He tried to remember something from the past. He saw 221B, decorated for Christmas, Mrs. Hudson dancing with Mycroft, John’s hand on his thigh . . .
“Oh my, no. They’re dears, the both of them. Mind, Sherlock could do with more space in his head for manners, and less in the fridge for earlobes, but I wouldn’t have anyone else upstairs.”
Every evening now, she sat by the door with the leash between her teeth and waited for Sherlock. They both agreed he was a poor substitute for John, but grief had finally made them friends.
“Sounds barmy when you put it like that. I’m just saying I need a little distance before I can talk about . . . things. I have some decisions to make quite soon and I thought . . .”
he tells him. Sherlock goes narrow-eyed and cranky, but he's always a little bit cranky, so no surprise there. He packs, though, and when John sees him slipping brightly coloured, badly-wrapped Christmas presents into his suitcase, he stops folding his own jumpers and trousers and watches, grinning just a little bit in the dim light of their bedroom.
John watched him swallow the pill, took the glass and set it on the bedside table. They sat quietly for a moment, then John leaned forward and raised one hand to brush a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead. His hand lingered against Sherlock’s cheek and she saw him lean into it. “You promise me, the minute the pain is too much –”
John hesitated, then reached in his pocket for the key card to his room and held it out. “Room 309.  Wait for me there. We’ll talk when the reception is over. We’ve waited this long, another few hours won’t matter.”
Sherlock watched in fascination as John turned three shades of red. And then turned to Mrs. Hudson, cheery and vibrant and very much alive.
“No. Never.” He knew he’d said it too quickly, too abruptly. “Look, I’m . . . I can’t. Not yet.” His face burned with embarrassment, like a schoolboy caught cheating. He stood quickly and grabbed his coat. “Sorry . . . I’ve got to go.”
When Sherlock came out of the bedroom, John was sitting in his chair, Lestrade had pulled a kitchen chair next to him, a file folder open on his lap. He looked so . . . well, young. Everyone was just so . . . young.
John said, “If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it right,” and you didn’t know if he was talking about the new case or the heat of his hand low on your back.
John walked Charlotte out. He locked the door behind her and slowly climbed the stairs back to the flat, sweating and breathing hard. He arrived just in time to hear Sherlock shouting, “Of course this is about me!” He swore and threw the phone against the sofa and it bounced onto the floor.
“It weren’t me that saw it first – someone showed Zed and he showed me. I promised to give him half of whatever –“
John rubbed his palms against his trousers. “I mean it, Sherlock. I want . . . I need . . . we have to take her home.” He paused, and then added in case there was any doubt, “to Baker Street.”
“I know you told me not to wake you, but this is worth it.” John tossed the paper toward Sherlock, who caught it without thinking. He pulled himself up onto an elbow and stared at John. Sherlock reached for his glasses that he knew by now would be on the bedside table.
“It must be Mary.” Kate stood and began pacing. “If I were able to prove she had a hand in Peter Goodale’s murder, and she found out . . . we know she doesn’t react well to feeling threatened . . . Sorry, John.”
Sherlock ignored her and looked over at John. “If it is Magnussen, then we can assume he knows exactly why Kate is here.”
He would have made an excellent poker player. If she wasn’t looking for it, she would never have seen it. The slightest intake of breath, a small narrowing of his eyes. But it confirmed what she suspected – he didn’t know. At least not for sure.
These images weren’t memories, but it almost seemed like they could be. Blurry afterimages, so close to reality, déjà-vu like pictures of an alternate universe, as if these moments had taken place while Sherlock’s back was turned, like he had just missed them.
“We’re going to A&E. Now.” He turned to her. “Kate, call 999. Tell them I suspect a PE and possible DVT. It’s 221b Baker Street.” His voice was calm, controlled and she saw the army doctor he used to be. He held the glass of water up to Sherlock’s mouth. “Drink this. It will help.”
Eventually Sherlock bought a small cottage a few miles from John’s. They managed to narrow the geographic and emotional distance between them with a weekly lunch or a pint at the local. Until John suffered a heart attack six months ago and Rosie confiscated his car keys.
In those short months between first having Sherlock and first losing him, John had tried hard not to think too much about what was happening between them. They had never talked about it, especially not when Sherlock was hiking up John's shirt and skidding his palms along his chest. He never questioned how Sherlock knew the spot on John’s neck that would make him shiver, or the way Sherlock kissed John and it felt like the sky was falling.
– engraved on the inside of the ring.  “I saw it on an old 70s cop show. It was corny but it suited us.” She closed her hand tightly around the ring. “I don’t understand. If all this came out – what did you say – eighteen months ago, why did I never hear about it?”
Lestrade pulled out a folded paper from his jacket. “So, nothing on the envelope except your prints and the guard’s. So far. Preliminary, you understand. Artist is Canadian, from Ottawa. The show created quite the stir over there. Creepy stuff that. Still, no connection to Sutton we can find. Oh, and he says he has no assistant. We’ll confirm that, but I don’t see why he’d lie.”
“Look at it from his point of view. He believed, rightly or wrongly, that you’d wait for him. You didn’t. Instead you proclaimed to the world that you were in love with Mary Morstan. You married her. And if she didn’t turn out not to be who she claimed, you’d still be living with her. Choosing colours for the nursery.”
Two years of Sherlock’s life lay spread out before him. And every piece of paper, every email and letter, asked for Mycroft’s reassurance that John was safe. Two years. All for him.
John spoke first. “Sit down, Kate.” He led her to the bed and she sat on the edge, still staring at Sherlock.
He drank the whiskey quickly. Before he could get up to order a second one, a well-manicured hand set down a full glass in front of him.
The drive to Orchard Lane Primary School in Hackney should have taken twenty minutes. Instead it took a long forty minutes in rush hour traffic.  Sherlock had found the boy who was holding up the message in the YouTube video.
“Of course – Moriarty – I should have –” he said and then closed his eyes again. “Say nothing to John yet.”
Sherlock nodded, then asked “Will you stay? Tonight, I mean. I gather all this –” his hand made a circling motion around them, “— indicates you’ve forgiven me. Again.”
Molly shuffled through her files. She’d avoided eye contact with him since he and Sherlock had come to the lab looking for answers. John recognised that look from Afghanistan – the helpless guilt of the living in the face of the dying.
“I will assume Chloe is your girlfriend, not your sister,” Sherlock said. “Siblings are usually more relieved than angry when plans are cancelled. In my case, at least.”
She knew he was only half-listening, he kept glancing down the hallway towards what she assumed was Holmes’ room. She’d watched him pour the tea, and noticed the tan line around his ring finger. Like he’d recently worn a wedding ring long enough to get a tan, but not long enough to leave the characteristic indentation that comes after years of wear.
John’s face fell for an instant, and he tightened his jaw and composed himself, blanking his expression, moving his hand away.
Anyone who reads my blog knows Sherlock is brilliant. The most insignificant details mark a path that only Sherlock can follow – dust on a man’s shoe, a rare flower that only grows in one narrow lane in all of England, the faint scent of cherry blossoms lingering at a crime scene. A hint of mud on a woman’s calf.
Sherlock sat straighter in his chair. “There are seven possible outcomes to this plan. Each with its own probability.”
Sherlock nods and searches his face, looking for the truth – or perhaps the lie – hidden there. Like he did that time when John said he twisted his ankle, because it wasn’t the right time to tell him it was broken, not with McNeil still waving his gun around and two flights of stairs between them and the police. It wasn’t until McNeil was on the floor, hands cuffed, cursing them and their mothers and Lestrade and the whole fucking constabulary, that John slid down the wall with a ragged “Sherlock?” on his lips.
Sherlock felt John’s hand through his pajamas. Warm. Real. He stared at John’s neck. Tanned, no wrinkles, a bit of brown chest hair peeking out from the top of his shirt. He sat back down.
“Distract, distress, discombobulate . . .” Sherlock opened his mouth but Kate held up her hand. “No. No. Not until we talk about John. About what you’re going to do about John.”
John sighed and moved his hand down to Sherlock’s hip. There was a long, thin scar there. He ran his fingers over it, tracing it slowly.
“This is tedious and getting us nowhere. “ Mycroft lifted his mobile to his ear. “And we have no time for tedious.” He walked between John and Sherlock and turned toward the door.
Kate almost laughed. It was like being cared for by a textbook. But she did what Sherlock said and she began to feel her heart slow. Her breathing calmed. She opened her eyes. Sherlock was studying her with what looked like actual concern.
John’s hand shook as he lifted the not-quite-clean glass and downed it all in one shot. He was glad the burn in his throat made it momentarily impossible for him to speak.
He reached out and hung onto John’s shirt as wave after wave crashed against his brain, laying waste to his carefully constructed mind palace.
Kate took the glass and held it in her hands. Stared at it. Looked up at John, who was looking at Sherlock, who was looking at her. Great. “So I guess this is the part where you two genius detectives tell me the plan.”
There was something going on between John and Sherlock that she couldn’t put her finger on – probably nothing to with Moriarty, but it left her with the unsettled feeling that she was missing something important – like watching a movie filmed through a dirty lens.
His eyes slid shut and his head dropped to his chest. Too many weeks with too little sleep had finally caught up with him.
“Only peripherally. Although my brother will always assume that he is the epicentre of any situation.”
“But children, John. There will be small children.” He sighs. The sigh of a wise man surrounded by fools.
“I read on your blog that you served in Afghanistan,” she said. By then, they were sitting on the couch drinking Mrs. Hudson’s tea from white china cups. The shortbread cookies were good, an Oreo would have been better. But if the only way to get to Sherlock Holmes was through John Watson, she’d play nice. For a while anyway. “My brother served there. Almost seven months. Helicopter pilot.”
“She’s good, John,” and squeezed his hand. “Really. If you must worry about something, worry about the weather. Harry’s got her heart set on an outdoor wedding. Seen too many rom-coms, I suspect . . .” She tilted her head. “You haven’t said a word about it. Does that mean you’re really okay with it? You’re not angry?”
He leaned up shakily on one elbow. “Hallucinating. The only logical explanation.” He reached for the lamp again, found the switch, but it wouldn’t turn on. His breathing sounded very loud in the room. The only thing louder was his heart beating in his ears and he wondered whether he might actually be having a heart attack. Is this how John had felt? He’d never thought to ask.
Sherlock sighed. Rubbed his head. “First we must all agree that the most important part of this plan – any plan – is that Mary not know about Inspector-“
There was an uncomfortable silence. Kate fought the urge to walk down the hall and wake up Holmes herself. She’d passed the nervous stage and was quickly moving to impatient.
“He’s not returning her calls or texts and I want to know why. In my experience, there is nothing an expert likes more than being asked his opinion. Find out everything you can about him.”
“Excellent.” He reached in his jacket pocket and handed her an envelope. “I’ve taken the liberty of arranging your flight home. You will leave tomorrow morning.”
“You’re not. You’re concerned for . . . the boys . . . and you want to help them. I want to help them too.”
She got into the car, buckled her seat belt and they headed away from the airport and onto the highway.
Kate glanced at the menu and settled on egg salad on rye and a Diet Pepsi and tried to ignore the pressure building behind her eyes. She’d quickly gone from a comfortable seat in the balcony to centre stage in this little melodrama. She went looking for her shoes and kicked aside her messenger bag, which she had dropped by the door when she first came in. A thick file slid out onto the floor, loose papers spilling haphazardly across the carpet. A colour photo of Sarah’s smiling face stared up at her.
He didn’t know. Close enough to Sherlock Holmes to stand beside him, but not close enough to know the truth.
He startled Mycroft who had been leaning against the wall, his phone at his ear. “I beg your pardon?”
In the cafeteria, Kate paid for the coffee and ham sandwich and carried her tray to a corner table by the window. Away from the chatting nurses and the worried mothers. She checked Sherlock’s phone for new texts – there was only one.
, John learned that it was the small things he missed most—over and over. The adrenalin rush of a new case, dark curls against a turned-up collar, a cashmere scarf dropped carelessly on the table by the door– the memories held him back, stopped him in his tracks every time he started believing that he really could begin to start over.
“The one Mycroft gave me? What was it – his Christmas list?” He slipped into one of Sherlock’s robes and looked down. It came depressingly down to his ankles.
“Not enough. You’re wearing make-up today, something you don’t normally do, so I suspect you’re trying to hide the evidence of a sleepless night. No doubt spent wondering why I recognized Anna Ashcroft’s name.”
John dropped Sherlock’s wrist, pulled both hands away and stepped back. Crossed his arms. Frowned. “What did you take?”
She thought for a moment that he was going to tell her, but then she watched him shut down, retreat back into his head. “You should leave,” he said.
She wrapped one of John’s scarves around her neck and tucked her still-damp hair into Sherlock’s ridiculous hat, the one he wore in the interview she’d seen on YouTube. She looked around for her purse and noticed the file still sitting on the table. The one John said was from Mycroft. It was heavy, at least three inches thick, a blue satin ribbon tying it together. She found a Tesco bag to protect it from the snow and tucked it under her arm – she’d read it while she ate breakfast.  Most likely none of her business, but what the hell?
He’d been home from hospital for two weeks. Mrs. Hudson continued to hover, making tea and touching his shoulder each time she passed. They’d never identified who poisoned John or sent the nursery rhymes or left the antidote at the gallery, but John suspected whoever it was would be back, sooner or later.
Kate sighed. She scrubbed her face. Recited the facts. Looked at her shoes, her hands, watched the monitors. She knew every syllable by heart. As she went through the forensics she wondered if Sherlock would find it all so mundane. Hate crime. Brutal. Unfortunate. Unsolved.
“It’s odd.  It’s as if I can see the city. No details, just lights around the shapes of things.  Tell me what you see. Exactly.”
He breathed in and let the cold air fill his lungs. Some days he felt like a plant kept too long out of the sun, wilted and faded. He whistled again and heard Graham bark in the distance.
Lestrade walked down the hall and sat in the chair next to Sherlock. He held out a large Starbucks coffee and a muffin. Sherlock took the coffee and waved away the muffin.
He’s still sleeping, torqued into some improbable shape, like a body washed up on the shore, one arm thrown up over his eyes to block out the morning sun. He hasn’t moved in more than an hour.
“Yeah, well that’s a story for another day.” He buttoned his overcoat. “I should get going. Early court date.  Call me if you need anything.”
John shrugged. “I managed not to blubber into my mash, if that’s what you’re asking. I did wonder at the time why they seemed to be handling it so well . . .”
“DS Donovan. Lestrade got called away, so he told me to fetch you and take you to his lordship’s flat.”
Sherlock’s phone pinged and he reached into his coat pocket. “Lestrade.” He read the text and held out the phone in front of John.
She saw him hesitate, but he stood and turned back to face the stairs. “Sherlock?” he shouted. When Sherlock didn’t answer, he swore loudly and took the stairs two at a time. “Sherlock!”
“I’m actually an excellent liar. But I really have no idea why you want to talk to me. Or why we have to have this conversation here. Unless this is a kidnapping. Are you kidnapping me, Mr. Holmes?”
Sherlock opened his eyes and squinted at John. “Decided to stay?” He tried to sit up, but John held him down with one hand against his shoulder.
“I might.” John shook his head. “You bloody bastard!” He started pacing back and forth across the room, carefully stepping around Sherlock each time. If he touched him, he’d have to kill him.
You stand to leave but it’s too late, you hear voices in the vestibule, so you sit back down and watch as a stranger’s coffin is carried down the centre aisle by six men in ill-fitting grey suits. A weeping woman follows behind, white hair pulled back under a black lace veil. She’s carrying a bouquet of white lilies and takes small, halting steps that remind you of a bride. She lays the flowers on the coffin and collapses into a pew in the front row. There are more mourners. A priest. The smell of incense.
“Thanks, but no. I’ve got to head out. Call me if you need anything,” Lestrade said. She wasn’t sure who he was talking to.
“She withdrew £500 at a cash machine in Brixton the day before she supposedly went on vacation.  Nothing on her credit card since and she hasn’t made any calls from her mobile. No record of her on any flights out of the UK in the past three weeks.”
He felt sucker-punched. He leaned forward, hands pressed flat against his thighs. He was trying hard not to feel like he was being crushed from the inside, trying hard to remember how to breathe.
Kate’s uncovered more of the truth than Sherlock or John want to admit. Oh, and then there’s the case.
He let go of the bed and stood, a bit unsteady. “If you even think of using it, I will haunt you for the rest of your life.”
That was when Kate noticed the man standing slightly behind Holmes off to his left. Roughly the same age, shorter, nice looking in a comfortable sweater sort of way. She restarted the clip and concentrated on him this time. Throughout the interview, he didn’t move, didn’t take his eyes off Holmes. He reminded her of a political wife – the kind that stands beside her husband while he confesses to the world that he can’t keep his dick in his pants. When Sherlock Holmes had answered, “Only a select few,” she saw him flinch and look away for a moment. She replayed a few more times to be sure.
Kate took another drink. This was the part she wasn’t sure about. How much did she trust Greg Lestrade? He’d been straight with her – as far as she knew. And what she knew for sure could fit in a goddamn teacup. This case was a giant knot and she still hadn’t figured out who was at the centre of it. And if he and Mycroft Holmes were – well, whatever they were. . . She decided to throw it all up in the air and see where it landed.
Half an hour later, he stood outside his house, hands deep in his pockets, staring up at the bedroom window, searching for the words he would say, and a sharp pain filled his chest – as if someone had wrapped a wire tightly around his heart and was tugging it from a great distance.
“I’d suggest you change your tone. I am a businessman. Nothing more. There has always been a lucrative market for my products. Ask your brother. Any fool can make a poison, the human body is so fragile. The real art lies in creating the antidote.  On occasion, a customer wants proof of the efficacy of one of my new . . . recipes. I simply suggested several names.”
John came back a few moments later, sleeves pushed up to his elbows and a damp line across the bottom of his jumper where he’d leaned against the sink. He sat beside Sherlock and turned to look at him, head tilted and eyes narrowed, as if he were trying to make a decision. He took a breath, leaned in and kissed Sherlock hard, open-mouthed, all tongue and teeth and heat. Sherlock’s hands found the edges of John’s jumper and tugged it, separating from John just long enough to get it up over his head. Sherlock’s hands crept under John’s shirt, running along his ribs and stomach.
I hear him come in and he stands behind me, his hands on my shoulders. Our faces are side by side in the mirror and his eyes are as blue as they have ever been. He smiles and raises one eyebrow and I am transported back to the bathroom in Baker Street and I half expect him to start grousing about the steam on the mirror or the staleness of the biscuits. Instead he massages my neck and I lean into his touch and he whispers everything that matters and he takes my hand and leads me to bed.
He wasn’t going to last long. Sherlock stroked him faster and John’s body became one long line of tension until the first wave of orgasm hit. He leaned back, lost somewhere between coming and dying. After an eternity, John rolled over and watched as Sherlock took his own cock in his hand, rolling his fingers over the tip, looking at John, his eyes dark. Wanting.
“Yes, you will.” John gave Sherlock a look that was almost a smile and Kate knew they weren’t talking about morphine any longer. Sherlock’s tumble on the landing and the blood and that long moment between scared to death and just scared had done what an hour of talking could never do.
Sherlock took a drink. “Hardly need to leave the flat for that anymore.” He stared at John over his glass. “Admit it. You came home because you missed me.”
John turned and poured the whisky and Sherlock walked back into the living room and took off his coat. They met again at their chairs and Sherlock made a mental note to remember this moment as the most perfect one. Of both his lives.
“It’s not giving up. You can’t do anything about Mary. Don’t give her a reason to do something about you.”
He set the dishes on the table and kissed her quickly on the cheek – she reminded him of his mother sometimes, the fussing, the endless pots of tea, the backbone of steel. Only his mother never once smelled like weed.
“Ha. Though if I – you – solve many more murders as quick as today, I’ll make Superintendent soon enough.” He scratched his head. “How the bloody hell did you know about the neighbour?”
Sherlock reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded white envelope. He opened it and lifted out a gold ring. He held it out to her in the palm of his hand. “Diorio always wore this on his pinkie finger. Do you recognize it?”
“The reservation was made in May, a few weeks before . . .” It was strange how his life was now divided into “before” and “after.” “With everything going on then, why in hell was he making hotel reservations in Dartmoor?” He didn’t add that the reservation was for the Empire Suite- king-size bed, Jacuzzi, minibar.
Since that weekend at Gidleigh Park, when he’d believed he’d drunken himself into a two-day blackout, he’d tried, if not to be on the wagon, at least to be running close behind. He’d always liked to drink – everyone in his family did. He’d learned to love the burn of scotch against his throat, the slow fire it fueled in his gut. The first time he kissed a man – in the alley behind the Pig and Whistle – he was drunk on Canadian Club and the dangerous feeling of his hard-on pressed up against another man's cock.
“Don’t be stupid. He doesn’t know anything but he’ll act as your liaison with Scotland Yard. We’ve arranged for you to meet with Sherlock Holmes. It wasn’t easy, so don’t waste the opportunity.”
He put his hand on Sherlock’s knee and Sherlock leaned his head against John’s shoulder. John rubbed Sherlock’s back and said something Kate couldn’t understand. Sherlock murmured something back and suddenly Kate became very aware that she was superfluous. She watched as John nodded and carefully pushed Sherlock back in his chair and stood.
Of all the things that John knew about Sherlock, it was this restlessness that had surprised him most. But now he understood that for all his confidence, Sherlock walked a tightrope. He ran, leaped and performed his daredevil stunts over an abyss that threatened to dash him to pieces.
“Where were we?” Sherlock asked between sips of tea. “Chloe is your girlfriend.” He paused and she nodded. “She led you to believe she was arriving tonight but didn’t. She claims she never sent the message. Is this correct?”
John stared at the file on the table. Another whiskey gave him the courage to open it. Two more to read through it all. Emails and letters and texts. Comments left on obscure websites. Transcripts of phone calls. Starting the day after Sherlock jumped and ending the week before he came back. There was a gap of six weeks halfway through the first year – a month after Gidleigh Park, John calculated. Followed by surveillance reports of a drugs rehab centre outside Ottawa. After that, the correspondence continued as before. The tone changed towards the end – Sherlock seemed angrier, more desperate that it was taking so long. He accused Mycroft of keeping him in the field for reasons that had nothing to do with Moriarty.
is your plan? I don’t know if I can . . .” John’s voice collapsed. He looked up and Sherlock was watching him, and John caught his breath, because Sherlock looked perfect in that moment, all pure blue eyes and dark hair and clean hollows and suddenly he felt a small warmth expanding in his chest, finding its way through his veins to his heart, settling into his blood and bones. He trusted him.
After the funeral, he bought a new leather strap for his father’s watch and wore it every day. Sometimes, in the evenings, when he was alone and it was finally quiet, he would hold the watch against his ear and remember.
John put his hands up and scrubbed his palms hard across his face, like he was trying to shake a bad dream.  “Molly rang.” Sherlock’s face brightened a bit, until John added, “No joy there, I’m afraid. You?”
Sherlock pulled him toward the bedroom. John felt like he was pulling him toward something they had let get away – something they needed to find again. Like a future.
John sat in the white armchair for an hour each week and told Ella Thompson everything. He filled the hours with tales of his childhood, his training at Bart’s (equal parts terrifying and exhilarating), the first girl he ever fucked (also equal parts terrifying and exhilarating). And today, because he was tired and running out of things to say, he told her about the corporal he met in Afghanistan – the one with enough shrapnel in his right leg to spend two weeks in hospital at Camp Bastion, but not enough to be invalided home. The one he’d played cribbage with each evening on the ward, the board propped on the sheets, drinking weak tea and counting 15-2s and 15-4s until the head sister sent John back to barracks.
John watched Sherlock’s neck muscles contract as he drained his beer and found himself reaching across the table to brush a stray piece of rice from Sherlock’s silk shirt. Sherlock smiled at him and John had the strange feeling that Sherlock knew exactly what he was thinking. Which was confusing, because he didn’t know himself.
“I had hoped that when you discovered the true nature of your wife’s . . . nature, you would understand the delicate position you are in. As well as the danger you continue to put Sherlock in.”
He sat on the bed to think where it might be. Sherlock had a habit of shedding things in the nearest available space. It explained, but didn’t excuse, eyeballs in the coffee mugs, dirty dishes in the fireplace, orange peels in the umbrella stand.
She turned to look at him. She really didn’t know him, but she was going to miss him. Holding a bouquet of roses in her lap had made her sentimental. “Thank you. For all of this.”
John took the paper and stared at Sherlock. “Seriously, what the hell are you on? Do I need to call Mycroft?”
We found this place by accident. Sherlock was badly hurt and all I was looking for was a peaceful place for us to die. I didn’t plan on living without him. I’d done that once and knew I couldn’t do it again. I laid him in the back seat of Mycroft’s Bentley and drove all night. And somehow ended up here.
By seven, with the building still intact, Sherlock had reason to hope his plan had worked. He wasn’t certain it would be enough, but it was something. He wanted to shift forward in time, just a week or so, so that he could see how it would all turn out.
Kate watched from what even she was now calling Sherlock’s chair. Dug her phone out of her pocket. Read the text.
Ronan wore a pirate’s striped jumper and a patch over one eye. “It’s Peter Pan, we’ve been practicing for ages.” He pushed the eye patch up into his hair.
Greg saw Anderson walking toward his office. “Yeah, okay Molly. I’ll look into it. We’ll check out John, too. Although I’m not sure what good it’ll do. Let me know anything else. I’ll be on my mobile.”
John cleared his throat. “They invited me the first Christmas you were dead. I almost didn’t go – but I felt sorry for them.  Almost as sorry as I felt for myself.  I bought a plum pudding at Harrod’s – then momentarily lost my mind and pretended I’d made it.  I suppose I wanted them to think I was getting on with things . . .”
John leaned forward and ran a hand up Sherlock’s thigh. “You deserved that.” He set his whisky glass down and moved between Sherlock’s legs. “And I deserve this.”
At first, John put all Sherlock’s fidgeting down to impatience. But there was something else there, in the way Sherlock’s eyes followed him as he paced around the hotel room. And then he understood that Sherlock was nervous. For the first time since they’d met, he wasn’t taking John’s devotion as a given. He was actually afraid that John might not forgive him. The cold weight that had been pressing down on John’s chest for the last four months began to lift.
John sat on the bed. “There was no trace of Mary or Moriarty in Ottawa. Honestly, I don’t think Moriarty was ever here. She left the baby with her parents, as I guess you know.”
She reached over and turned on the bedside lamp. Sat up and opened the laptop and found the pictures of Anna Ashcroft. She found John’s blog and pulled up a wedding picture of Mary. Placed it side by side with Anna’s graduation picture.
She dialed. Gave the operator the details. Felt her own heart pounding in her chest. “They said five to ten minutes.”
When the news was over, Sherlock took his violin out of the case. He pulled up a chair in front of the window and folded himself into it, picking out short melodies, a little Saint-Saëns, a little Kreisler. His fingertips squeaked on the strings, and he closed his eyes. It had been a long time since he picked up the violin, the arthritis in his hands had made playing more painful than pleasurable.
“And the only reason you’re not in jail is because Mycroft saved your ass. That must have killed you – accepting help from your brother.”
John stood and brushed the loose tobacco from his shirt. “No, Harry’s promised to read me the next chapter of
John’s phone rang while they were eating. He glanced at the number and shut it off. “Sarah,” he said. “I broke it off with her today.”
No need for small talk, apparently. “Yes, thank you. He’s sending it up the chain. Should have an answer back from him in a couple of days.”
Sherlock smiled and bent down, sucking a trail along John’s neck, dipping into the hollow of his shoulder blade. He felt John’s hands on his hips, pulling, and he lifted a knee, pressing it against John’s crotch. John moved a hand onto the back of Sherlock’s neck, guiding his head back to John’s mouth, thrusting his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock moaned against John’s lips.
He undressed and brushed his teeth. He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror for a moment, wondering what Sherlock saw when he looked at him. The last four months had taken a toll. If Harry was to be believed, at least.
, Mycroft whispers.  You had a plan. A week to get your Bulgarian up to speed, a week to make contact, two weeks to get what Mycroft needed.
The shadows were long and low when Sherlock woke up in his new favourite position – naked and tangled in sheets. He reached over for John but the bed was empty. He felt a moment of panic until he heard noises from the kitchen and recognised the sounds of the toaster, the hiss of the kettle. He checked his phone. Four o’clock. A little more than two hours until he’d find out if what he’d done last night had made a difference. If there was a still an explosion, he’d have to start over, find another way.
John got up and leaned over Sherlock. He brushed his thumb across the tender, insomnia-dark skin under Sherlock’s eye, and said, "Good. Then it’s settled. Now stand up and kiss me. Properly.”
“Finding out about Mary’s connection to Moriarty pushed him to make a decision. But he is still torn, whether he admits it or not. I recognize that I could pull him in my direction if I told him, but I’ll not have him by default.”
“And now?” Kate always felt like Mrs. Hudson was on the verge of telling her something very important, some little tidbit that would explain it all – especially why Kate was still here, gossiping over tea and cakes like a proper English lady.
His stomach cramped again, worse than before, and he doubled over, fighting waves of nausea and dizziness. “Jesus bloody Christ,” he hissed through the pain. He closed his eyes and felt a prick in his arm and for a short, stupid minute he thought it was another dart and he tried to pull away, but then he felt Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder and Sherlock’s voice in his ear, whispering to him shakily that he would fix this.
“Are you in pain? Does your head hurt?” John lifted himself onto an elbow, laid his hand on Sherlock’s cheek. “Dizzy?”
But it was all lies. His and John’s and especially Mary’s. He should have known. Another miscalculation – only this one sent him to hospital. Twice. He didn’t think John would ever get over it. John came back to Baker Street. But not to him. The chance that it would end well flew out the window the minute he’d allowed Mycroft to erase the past. Their past. The present, built upon a truth within a lie wrapped in another lie, would have to be enough. The only person Sherlock Holmes had ever cared about was John Watson. Surely his happiness, whatever form it might take, was enough.
