“God, okay.” He licked his lips. “I kinda like both of them and I don’t know what to do about that.”
You could give me a few specifics, like which realm it’s in. Without that I can only give you the vague “go with your gut advice.”
Clairel grinned and left to search the bookshelves. The man had a fond look on his face as he watched her side to side with the other kids, chatting. “Do you need any help with anything, sir?”
Dean took a deep breath, braced himself against the table. “Yeah, it’s just a lot coming up all at once. They’ve been really supportive of me the last year, you know with everything, and so I’ve got a lot of emotions tangled up with them. I know I’m gonna like them regardless, because I can’t imagine being that close to someone and it not translating to in person. It’s just
He looked up and there was Castiel Novak, his head inclined towards the empty armchair next to Dean. He hadn’t seen the guy in months and suddenly here he was like the ghost of Christmas present about to show him the sad state of his store. “No.” He nodded and sat down, tea in hand, much to close for his comfort. “What exactly are you doing?” Okay and maybe that was harsh, but he’d already been stood up, he didn’t need his business rival to make a bad evening worse.
“That’s a lie, but okay.” The store boxes were every, a path created to the bedrooms and the kitchen. The store’s sign leaned against the bar between the kitchen and the living room. He drifted to the fridge and poured himself a glass of orange juice. “Why are you here?”
“I get it. Whatever you do, Mom would be proud. And I’m proud of you to. Keep me updated though! I don’t want to have to hear on the news that you got arrested in front of Milton Books.”
He stood up from the table, rattled the silverware. “April, this has been lovely, but you have to go.”
ImpalaGuy: Sure thing. But how will I know who you are amongst all the other guys with golden retrievers?
Dean leaned back in the couch and made sure Kevin was upright. NYC418 was right, he had a lot of great people to look after him. The next couple months were going to suck, but he had a lot of people looking out for him.
He went up to the counter and ordered another slice of pie and a refill on his coffee. The barista smiled and put extra whipped cream on his pie. Was it that obvious that he was stood up? He dropped his change in the tip jar. If he was going to camp here for a large portion of the night he could at least compensate the staff. He settled down in an armchair instead of the table he originally sat at and snuggled down. Maybe it wasn’t the night he expected, but it would be nice.
I want you to know Honey glowed when I told her what you had to say about her. She’s very receptive to endearments and compliments. I have to make sure to curb them or it will go straight to her head. A dog might do you some good. They’re non judgemental, force you to get up and leave your bed, and make fine listeners. They also cannot be emotionally burdened by what you say and will only ever give you love in return — at least that’s been my experience with Honey. She’s a gentle, sweet soul, who will only trash your apartment when there are treats hidden everywhere. One of my acquaintances hid them to earn her trust, which completely backfired as Honey had no idea of who planted them, but only knew my apartment had suddenly turned into a magic doggy treat dispenser. It also explained the vomit I found in the back of my closet.
His father clapped his shoulder. “Now, now, aren’t some of them already closed down or sold? Already scaring them off before you open. That’ll weed out the weak.” He chuckled.
He shuffled and dropped his gaze. “My parents always gave me the impression I couldn’t do any of this without their prodding and meddling. I assumed I was a weak leader.”
His boat bobbed in the water, a soothing reassurance that everything would be alright, eventually. The view out the windows was cluttered with the other boats docked in the mariana. Honey ran the length of the sitting area, sniffing every nook and cranny. She had been on the boat a long time, back in her puppy years, and was thrilled when he took her there. Say what he will about the opulence of the boat, but he appreciated it at the moment. It was nice to have the comfort a hotel room wouldn’t provide and none of the questioning bunking with Meg or Gabe would cause. He continued to put off returning to his apartment and talking with April. Five, coward.
He stood up to hug her. “I’m still happy for both of you. We should celebrate.” He walked to the kitchen and pulled out the good whiskey from Christmas. Charlie sat the tumblers down on the counter. “To you and Dorothy.” He held his glass up. “May you have a long and happy life together.”
Still to soon, Milton Books glowed in the dusk, yellow eye windows peered out. He pushed the door in and the smell of coffee and paper hit him. Neat displays with rows and rows of books enticed his eyes. Signs for different genres, subjects, types, and specials jumped out. People whispered and laughed. He drifted amongst them. It was — jarring, a bit unnerving, but happy. He hadn’t stepped inside a Milton Books before, all of his perceptions came from a quick peek through the windows and from the man who headed this one.
“Maybe I should just cancel? If I can’t even make it through our conversation, how am I going to make it with them?”
Claire plunked out a melody on the piano, much better than she was last year. Jack sat on his lap and wiggled free to rush to the dessert table. She finished and stood up. The adults clapped at broke off into small groups. “That was very nice, Claire.”
“That’s the point. I want people to feel welcomed. This will be good for the area.” Castiel glowed with pride.
Steve nodded. “Claire is my grandfather’s daughter and Jack is my father’s son. We are...an American family. I love to spend time with them. Family’s important, you know?”
“I’m sure you did better than you think you did. Go on and get the counter ready for open. I’ve got the front.” Dean shooed Kevin away from the floor.
ImpalaGuy: It’s not like I purposefully forget. And sometimes the depression and anxiety make it worse.
“No, really. There’s a difference between thinking you’re having a little last hurrah before settling down and being coerced into a marriage you don’t want. I thought you were just unsure about April. You’re okay with her, but you’ve always been an awkward dude. Or that you weren’t a fan of PDA. Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Yeah, so like, I get it. It’s never really relevant except to the person you’re fucking, you know? It’s one of the reasons I bothered you until we were friends. I saw you eyeing the frat boys on the lawn.”
“I do.” Charlie reached out and Dean handed her his mug. She placed it against her face and groaned. “Warm.” She took a sip. “I got caught up in my campaign last night and stayed over. Dorothy is such a great DM, made sure I got the good blanket before I passed out. You should join us. We’re almost done and you can take that time to build up your character sheet.”
He rubbed the back of his neck. “It’s nice of you to offer, but I don’t think we’re looking to go that drastic.”
“Meg,” he gripped her shoulder and pulled her to the side. “You can’t say things like that out loud. And besides, we don’t know anything personal about each other. How could I engage in “cybersex” if I know nothing of consequence about him.”
He made his way to the front, suffered through the line, and stepped back into the cold. Right into someone. He jostled backward and flung his arms out to stay balanced. The other person was bent over, a few groceries tossed. “I’m so sorry dude. Need help?”
He pushed himself up against the headboard. Ever since the disastrous “romantic” evening, April flitted between cold shoulder and too close for comfort. Her efforts to find a comfortable spot in their relationship drove him insane. It didn’t help that when he called her the next day she apologized for the surprise, but not the action. Said she would tell him if she would do something like that again. She didn’t get it and he didn’t know how to say it. He held her at arms width, not knowing what she would do next. “No, I didn’t feel well, so I took the day off.”
He cringed. Good to know her mother was cut from the same cloth as his. Well, it could be OCD or some other kind of condition. Or not. It was hard figuring out which part of him was the asshole and which part the guy who invited his relatives (they’re not his niece and nephew, but it felt more like that then his brother and aunt) over for holiday decorating. Was that even okay? They had their own lives. They might not turn out like his.
“Tortellini soup.” He threw out the onion he bled over and began to cut the other half he saved. “Can you check the freezer for chicken broth? I’m pretty sure there should be some left over from that roast chicken we had a couple of weeks ago.”
NYC418: A lot of things, but honestly I’d rather not focus on them specifically. I’d rather talk about anything else than that.
He pulled away. “Hey, you’re a great guy. If they couldn’t see it through all of your communication, why would they agree to a new meetup? They’ve got to be as excited as you are. Take the chance, I think it’s going to be good.” Oh dear, he didn’t know Dean would be so worked up about their meeting. But to be fair he completely flaked on you him the first time they were supposed to meet, well he didn’t, but Dean didn’t know that.
ImpalaGuy: I don’t know if I’ve ever told you, but thank you. It’s meant a lot to me these last couple of months
“That sucks.” A tickle in the back of his throat. He covered his mouth with an elbow and turned towards the sink. Goddammit, why did his body have to embarrass him in front of a handsome guy? He coughed up gunk into the sink and turned on the water. He angled his head back towards Castiel. “Told you I wasn’t well.” A loose cough bent him over the sink. “Jesus. You sure you want to be around Typhoid Mary?”
Dean sighed. “Well, we’ll keep doing our best. Thanksgiving’s in two weeks and that’s the real test. Hopefully we’ll keep on track with our holiday sales.”
Dude, that was so cheesy. Like, mac and cheese levels of cheese. But it’s good to hear you and Honey are in a more permanent location.
Cas knows better than to interrupt with platitudes. Dean’s always shied away from kind words and sympathy.
“I had to chuck out your soy milk the other day, it got bad. And I swear I saw dust on your computer. Dust, Charles.”
Castiel pulled his groceries closer to his chest. “Dean, I’m not apologizing for my success. It’s business, not personal.”
It was a mixed bag with Sam back in state. Plus side, no late night calls or penny pinching for long distance. Downside, a well meaning brother in his business that can’t be fixed with the push of a button.
Dean ran the numbers again and groaned. It was all speculation. He had no idea what would happen when Milton Books opened. Maybe it bring more foot traffic past his shop, it was definitely going to take a chunk out of his sales, but it could also bring a revival of locally owned businesses. He rubbed his fingers along his sore eyes and pushed his glasses up his forehead. He had to think of something.
He brushed her away and straightened his coat. “Okay, okay. I’ll do it. You should probably go home. I don’t know how long this will take and I’d hate for you to wait out in the cold.”
Honey pawed at his leg, her nose nudged at his pocket with the dog treats. “Hey there, girl.” He patted her neck and she barked, tail wagging.
“Yes.” She rolled her eyes and pushed him towards the door. “I know you’ve got a spat with him and whatever, but won’t it be worse when he logs onto AOL tomorrow and gets some shitty e-mail about why you weren’t there.”
Eggs. Sugar. Flour. What else went into making cookies? Maybe he shouldn’t make cookies for Thanksgiving. Wait until Christmas instead. He would have an extra month to prepare, make sure he had all of the supplies and ingredients. Perhaps he could ask ImpalaGuy for help. He was obviously well-versed in the art of holiday baking, whereas he had no skill in it whatsoever. However, it meant he had to return the items. He pushed through the crowd towards the baking aisle and stopped.
“I know. I know.” Dean wobbled up a smile. “And they’re pretty cool.” Another deep breath. “I’m gonna be okay. You know, they live in my neighborhood. There’s a chance I’ve seen them before. Imagine that, I’m at Starbucks or walking down the street and when I meet up with them I’ll realize I’ve already met them. God, I hope I wasn’t a dick.”
“Not for a bit. I don’t want to break our lease, but Dorothy and I are going to be looking at apartments soon. She wants to get out of her shoebox ASAP.”
Castiel held the door open as they spilled out onto the sidewalk. A black car pulled up to the curb and Claire and Jack fell out and ran across the sidewalk. “Cas! Cas! Cas!”
“Spying on your,” he furrowed his brows. “No, I was just having a nice day out with Claire and Jack.” Castiel glared at him and snatched the spoon.
That’s fair. I don’t even know where my own feelings lie right now. Maybe a break is what we need while we both figure out ourselves. Please take care of yourself. I won’t let myself have such a large ego that I’m the only one you can confide in, but I know it’s been easier for you to confide in me, a somewhat stranger, than friends and family at times. I feel privileged to have met you and got to know you.
“It’s simple. I want to run my store. Unlike you, I can’t solve all my problems by waving money at it.”
“Yeah, Dean’s got himself an internet friend. They’ve been talking back and forth for, what, almost a year now?”
Dean opened the register and counted out change. “Milton Books is moving in down the block. It’s gonna suck, but we’ll get people to stay with us. Can’t beat our charm.” He winked. “Well, Claire, you take good care of your nephew out there.”
Castiel watched Gabriel leave and stayed leaned against the wall. His mother stepped out of the sitting room and smiled. “I was surprised April came with you. I thought you were going to her parents?”
His mother nodded. “That’s what I heard. Susan told me Mary Winchester’s store looks like it’s going to stand its ground. What’s it called again?”
Two pizzas, an order of cheese sticks, and one and a half movies later, Charlie snored from the couch. The TV flickered blue light across her face and she frowned in her sleep. He tucked the blanket around her and picked the phone off its cradle. He stepped into his room and dialed. One ring, two rings, three rings, “Hello?”
Do you ever get the feeling that you thinking to fast and if you just slowed down you might be able to understand everything that’s happening without freaking out? I wasn’t always like that (or at least that’s what I say. Friends and family have told me otherwise), but the older I get the more everything bothers me. Slow walking pedestrians, people who put ketchup AND mustard on their fries, rain when you have no umbrella. Maybe something happened when I wasn’t watching, but even my employees are getting on my case and they’re not THAT older than me. Got any advice?
They said goodbye and Dean placed the phone back in the cradle. He popped into the office where Bobby sat, glasses perched at the end of his nose. “How’s it looking, old man?”
The waitress returned with their orders — burgers for both of them — and flashed Dean a smile before she left. Cas squirted ketchup to the side of his fries. “The problem is that I thought I was doing that for years. You put your business face away when you get home. I don’t know anymore if I want to keep that up. It’s frustrating, it’s exhausting, it’s —” He stabbed a french fry into the ketchup. “It’s too much. And I don’t think I want to do it anymore. Look how it turned out with you. Where’s my boundary between business and personal when I saw you in and out of it? Where’s my line? I think I’d rather give up the whole mess and just be
NYC418: I can’t even say I’d do the same for all my friends because I don’t. At least not in awhile.
“Just think about it. Don’t deny yourself over something with a fairly easy solution. If neither of them want to date you, you’ll still have good friends, and we can go get trashed at a bar. I’m gonna have your whole life turned around by summer if it’s the last thing I do.”
Steve sat Jack back down on the floor and pulled out his wallet. He handed over three twenties. “I hope so.”
He puttered around, humming as he opened shop. Soon, frazzled parents with young children would come in looking for anything to keep their little readers busy and distracted. It wouldn’t be the same as the Saturday rush, but the beginning of school year always brought new readers and their parents in search of a book to spark their kids’ imagination and a love for reading. Dean was eager to be the person to get a kid hooked on literature.
“Yeah, but don’t you miss the social aspect of the store? You’re like the biggest extrovert I know.” He paused. “Maybe not extrovert. But you like to be around people on your terms.”
“You killing yourself over math.” Bobby sat down at the table across from Dean’s piles of past sales numbers and notebooks worth of future projections.
“Well, beyond the third degree and jabs, I enjoyed spending time together in the cafe. Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment, but I don’t have many friends. The high powered executive lifestyle doesn’t leave much in the way for making friends. Deals? Sure. But not many friendships are made without some financial gain to come with it.”
Castiel pocketed his phone and sipped on his coffee. Not as great as what he could make at home, but every drop helped him stay awake. He shifted as he waited for Meg to show up, slightly late as always and most likely with an outrageous tale. The building had come along nicely — paint finished last week, furniture was scheduled for the end of next week, there would be the tour for investors the week before the store would open, then the ribbon cutting ceremony and it would be operating by the time holiday shopping would begin.
“I don’t think I would have been much better, but.” Her foot slide up the side of his calf, only about half way. “But it is good to know. About the omelet thing. I would hate to put you in an uncomfortable position.”
The omega presses his chest out, shoulders straight. “Yeah, not the first knot-head I’ve met.” He drops his laundry bag and his pockets jingle as he reaches for change.
He looked at the back of — something. His lack of baking skills told him it was a bar of chocolate, but what would that be doing in the baking aisle and not in candy? Or at the front of the store? It didn’t matter. What was important was that Dean didn’t see him. A confrontation in the grocery store was the worst outcome he could think of happening. He bypassed the aisle. He could buy what he had now and leave. They were basics. He could use them for something else. Only the eggs were perishable anyway. He hurried to the front and hoped Dean would be preoccupied long enough so he could leave unnoticed.
Okay, now I’m not trying to be crude or whatever, but I thought you didn’t like your old girlfriend, so how would she take up so much time? (It’s cool if you don’t want to say anything, that’s pretty personal).
His mother patted his cheek. “Yes, thank you dear. We should be headed off.” His parents and their respective spouses walked towards the entrance, largely leaving Castiel by himself.
Jesus Christ. “I’m about to meet the man I had cybersex with, of course I’m gay.” What was the relevance? Was there relevance?
She pushed his face towards the lines of televisions. Images of the front of Milton Books flashed by along with the picketers in front. Cut to a shot of Dean Winchester himself addressing the crowd. “Milton Books is only a corporate entity with no heart here. Do we want the neighborhood to lose it’s locally owned shops and business to make way for corporations? Or do we want to keep businesses local? Do you want to save The Shop Around the Corner?” The crowd cheered.
“I don’t really know you from Adam, so it’s not like there’s a whole lot of people I can spill your secrets to.” What good would Castiel’s secret be if he didn’t know anyone in his circle? And it wasn’t like the secret would be something terrible like insider trading or other shady white collar shit.
for sure. Start there and tell me when you need more. Man, I wish we could do movie nights. You should see the ones my roommate and I have with our friends. It’s a lot of fun.
“There’s nothing in the fridge. Or your pantry.” The door shut and April came back in the room, mug in hand. “When do you ever eat?”
The taxi pulled up to the curb and Castiel payed, helped usher April out and on her feet. She wobbled a smidge, on the border of buzzed and tipsy. “Oh Castiel, my strong man. Mmmm, I have so many plans.”
He beamed and sat the plate on the side table so he could sit on the couch. “When will we get to eat?”
“There is the general public, though I don’t think any mildly embarrassing situations about me would make headlines. I’m not that important.”
“You know that’s not how that works.” He shrugged his robe off and sped through his bathroom routine. Where did all the time go? Well, NYC418 is where it went.
He angled his water glass towards him. “I’m teasing you. I know you’re just nervous. It’s okay, you’ll do fine.”
“You’re insufferable.” Honey whimpered at his feet and he picked a piece of sausage off to feed her. “I’ve had Hannah clear my next Saturday so I can go shopping. And yes, I will get someone to move my furniture for me.”
“But you do! You did when he just heard the alert. Don’t tell me if it’s not from you won’t be a bit disappointed.”
His walk towards the subway. His favorite coffee shop. Even as he stepped out of Milton Books. Dean Winchester was everywhere. After the news segment he had seen a slight rise in hostility towards the store. That slight rise in hostility being the picketers outside the store front. Catchy chant, but otherwise a limited annoyance. They didn’t block the doors and didn’t bother the customers. If there had to be a protest against his store, he could handle this.
“You were this close to full blown elevator look.” She hovered her pointer and thumb over each other. “But you only dated girls in college, so: bi.”
“Cause here’s the thing: you’ve won. I’m sure you’ve heard about the store closing already, so I don’t think we have anything left to discuss.”
“Mmmm, your dick’s gonna be so hard when you see me in the lingerie I have picked out for our one year anniversary. My friends have told me I should dump you already, get a man who would actually take care of me. They’re not wrong. I should have. But dating’s such a shit show. I can settle for you.”
The door banged open, a noisy entrance to match Gabe. “This has got to be books. It’s too damn heavy to be anything else.”
He placed a hand on Dean’s forearm. “Hey, you’re getting worked up. Deep breath. Tell me about them.”
“Yes, Hannah, this is Castiel. Could you please reschedule my meetings? I won’t be coming in today.”
— set him back into a swirl. He never would have thought he’d fall in love with Cas, but the more he got to know him the easier it was. And now he would be making his decision.
He took it back and folded it up, shoved it into his back pocket. “That’s great kiddo, now go check shelves.”
He shoved his feet into his shoes and jammed his coat down on his shoulders. “Char, I’m leaving.” She grunted from the couch and he shook his head. He needed to talk to her about her sleep schedule. Man, was it getting fucked in the last few weeks. A brisk chill wound around his neck and kissed his face. Today was going to be okay.
“Cas has been e-mailing him for a little over a year now. The two dorks refused to share anything super personal, but when they decided to meet in person Cas couldn’t tell him he was there for him.”
Ouch. They were making teenagers sooner and sooner. He grabbed the mixing bowl and set it in the water. “I’d like to think I’m different.”
“No reason to get cynical from the get go. Got any positivity in that angsty ass of yours?” Bobby picked up a pen and tapped it against the stack of notebooks. “Or have you already thrown in the towel?”
Dean hummed as he walked up the step ladder to hang lights in the display window. Since Thanksgiving passed, the holiday season officially began. Carols wavered in the background, Krissy had left to pick up treats and Kevin was in storage looking for the lost box of ornaments. Bobby would be back with a tree at some point. Just him and the store. There’s a hush layered over the store that only seems to appear late at night, different from the pre-open quiet. The quiet where he feels closest to his mom.
As they left, he noticed Castiel at the edges of a group dominated by April. He swirled his champagne in its glass and sighed. He glanced up and caught Dean’s eyes. He look almost — regretful?
“Not bad. I thought after a while I would get used to the weather, but I’m still surprised I can go out and not have to wear so many layers. New York winters will do that to a person, though.”
“You’ll never know if you don’t take it.” He sighed. “And I’ve never seen you be so hesitant on anything. What happened to Dean “Give’em Hell” Winchester?”
Maybe it’s more about what you make with the leap day. Do you plan anything special? Is the act of existing on that day special enough? Though I think I like the idea of a worldwide celebration. What if we took the day to do something nice, something for the betterment of humankind. I know I haven’t been the best I could be in the past, I’ll be making it up for a while, but this could give everyone the opportunity. It’s a nice thought. We’ve got two years to plan. Why don’t we make it special?
He leans forward and kisses Dean softly, gently, completely. Dean lifts his hands to cradle the back of Cas’s head. Cas can think of no sweeter reunion.
I understand if you don’t want to message me anymore. First, I don’t meet with you and don’t even tell you why. Then, I cheated on my girlfriend with you (though to be honest by then the relationship had run its course, but that’s not an excuse. I had all the information and you had none.)
She smiled and took his face in her hands. Her rings were cold against his skin. “Oh, I’m so proud of you. I knew you would be able to accomplish this one day. You’ve learned so much from me. Once this is all settled and down we can talk about your next project. I can’t wait to see what you’ll do next.” She patted her husband’s arm. “Didn’t he do a nice job?”
“April. She said you’d be with her parents.” She shrugged. “She told Nanny Tess when she visited your parents.”
“Krissy came into the store today and,” he sank into the couch, “she dragged us all out to see the new Milton Books they’re building. In my neighborhood.” He tugged the throw blanket over his shoulders. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
“You’re ungrateful.” Cas shakes his sweatshirt sleeves. He should be used to the jokes that come out of Claire’s mouth, but he thinks it’s worse since Dean decided he should be able to one up her.
NYC418: I put more thought and consideration into it than I think any other fashion choice in my life. It’s not just a tan trench coat
“Well, that’s the beauty of therapy. You’ll get there eventually. Now, tell me how boat living is like? I didn’t even know if you still had the key to this beauty.”
I’m a quarter of a way through a sock, so I’m gonna say knitting is not regulated by season. How else are you supposed to finish everything by the time fall and winter come around?
“It’s looking like it. We might even be able to open the last week in September. Cross our fingers.” He passed her a thin packet of construction notes. “My parents more than likely will want their own private tour before the investors, so we’ll need to make sure to notify them on time or they’ll have the month booked solid and “can’t possibly squeeze me in right now.”.
“Hey, simmer down. Is one week even a good measure? They’re new. They’re shiny. Once the newness all wears off people will see it for what it is: large, impersonal, and a product of the man. Who knows? Maybe once the holiday season starts you’ll see your numbers go back to normal. People love to go to little shops to go the extra mile. To say “I loved you so much I didn’t just pick up a present for you at the check-out line while I bought something for me.”
“I can’t remember the name of the book, or the author, but I do know the author is a man. She said it’s about kids who are orphans? But it’s not
I’ll start with that I feel we’ve shared enough personal info that me explaining the in’s and out’s of my last relationship is not the deepest we’ve ever gone, but thank you for respecting the outcome of my decision. My relationship with my ex was...interesting to say the least. We had been together prior to meeting you, but when we started interacting, we had only been dating for a couple of months. My parents adored her (and if I’m honest nudged my towards her), so it was inevitable I’d spend more time with her. By fall, she had practically moved into my apartment, but still occasionally spent time at her place. And what should have been a time when we got closer, I never felt more farther apart. We both have demanding jobs we’re dedicated to, so I didn’t expect us to spend anymore time together, but we were almost latched at the hip at social engagements. She tried to keep us together, but I was too much of a carpet to tell her I didn’t think it was working. I didn’t realize until we broke up that most of those social and work engagements were for her, so suddenly I had all this time. To be fair, I was also working on a major project at work at the time, which was also finished around the time I broke up with her. Hence the free time, the hobbies, and knitting.
"Still—figuring out I was beta and not omega was the best thing that ever happened. All the discomfort from my presentation kind of melted the more comfortable I got declaring myself as beta."
“Ahh, if it isn’t my favorite little brothers. And Aunt Claire, you’re looking beautiful as always.”
“Wait, wait, hold the door.” Kevin ran up behind him, coffee in hand, wiggled his way through. “Morning, Dean.”
“I thought I studied enough, but question twenty-two I wasn’t one hundred percent sure. And I could have made stronger points on my essay, but the overall argument was solid.”
He slowed down and glanced over at Meg who paced at a leisurely walk. “Normally the nature calms me, but there is nothing calming about this gym setting.”
Castiel sat down at the table. April brush her hand over his arm. Mother and father beamed from the end of the table. Gabriel shook his head.
“Not the point. Let’s go see. Show us Krissy.” Dean pushed his way through his employees and back out onto the street. They followed her and it was too soon for his liking that the looming building facade emblazoned in red appeared: COMING SOON: MILTON BOOKS.
He pet the petals of one of the flowers. “I know we haven’t had great interactions, but I was hoping to put that behind us. I know it might not work, but I thought we could maybe, be friends?”
“Yeah, they’re pretty great. And I think that’s why I’ve built it up so much.” He groaned and laid his head down on the table. “If I could just skip ahead to when I’m supposed to meet them, that would be great.”
Bobby snorted. “Yeah, yeah, I got it.” He faced Dean. “One, Mary says she loves you. Two, she says exactly what I said earlier: do what makes you happy. If fighting for her legacy does, do it. If closing shop to pursue your dreams will make you happy, do it. Your Mama didn’t want you to shackle yourself to this store out of guilt or some missed place idea that it would keep her alive. She’s always wanted you to follow your dreams. So, what feels right to you?”
"yeah, sure as hell won't miss the smell of antiseptic" Sam said, the smell still lingering on his nose. They drove in relative silence to Deans house. As they got out of the car John opened the front door and went to the car to help them out.
"uuhh, we bought pie, I didn't know what else to bring and Gabe here says that no one can say no to his pies, it's apple I hope you like it" he says
"OK, here goes nothing" Cas says as he takes a deep breath, he knocks on the door, the muted voices inside go silent and he hears a muffled 'come in'. He takes another deep breath and his hand goes for the handle and turns it.
"it's not that bad, we'll just say its a coincidence that my boyfriend happens to be the brother of the man you helped at the accident scene" Gabe says making it seem as though it's that simple.
"yeah, I like him Sam. I've never felt this way about anyone before, but then again what if it's too soon Sam. Am I moving on too quick?"
"OK, we're going back, this is going to be way more awkward than it was gonna be initially" Cas says
"WHAT!! that's one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. You know how hard it is to even get an internship there" Dean sputters
"Dean, don't try to talk, let me get the nurse OK" Sam says as he dashes to the front desk to get a nurse, a few moments later Sam comes back with a nurse in tow
"OK, let's go, what do I have to loose" he says forcing so much enthusiasm in his words he wonders if he's trying too hard to convince himself
"my brother. My grandfather was grooming him to takeover from him one day. He was the firstborn grandson and my grandfather didn't have any sons, so Michael was the 'heir'. When my brother died, my mom and grandfather shifted their focus to me. My grandfather never really had that father-daughter relationship, he always wished he had a son" Cas says
Cas was shaking, Gabe even had to take the pie from him before he dropped it. A lot of scenarios were  running in his mind, did Dean remember him? did he like men? What if he was married and had children what would he say he came to do when he gets to his room? The evening just after Gabe left, he called Martin - his colleague, to ask the name of the man they helped at the accident scene. He had told him his name was Dean Winchester. He hadn't stopped thinking about that name the whole night. He doesn't even when he fell asleep.
"so your boyfriend has a cousin that handsome and you don't tell me Sammy. Greedy much" Dean says as soon as the doctor is out of earshot
"it was, but Ellen swooped in and we've been his kids ever since." Dean says with a smile on his face "but enough about me, tell me about yourself" Dean says changing the topic
When the food was cooked Gabe set the table while Cas was making the finishing touches, he dished up for both of the and they sat down and ate in relative silence until it was time for desert.
"I'd like to go on a date with you too. It's getting a little cold wanna go inside?" Cas asks already standing
"how are you in a relationship for that long but know nothing about your boyfriend, that's a little weird"
Sam gets a call when he's at work, Dean's been in an accident and he's currently on his way to surgery. He gets his coat and rushes out of his office, before going to his car, he tells Darla his assistant to cancel all his meetings for the day and any call that is important should be referred to his personal cell. His at the hospital in under 30 minutes and called his dad who he finds at the hospital with Bobby. They wait for what feels like an eternity before a doctor comes out wearing a grim face, Sam starts to panic did something happen to Dean, did he die. Sam didn't want to imagine a world without his brother in it. His brother who raised when their dad was away working or passed out drunk on the couch.
"I think you should take the poor guy pie when you go see him, I mean who can say no to pie right? Gabe said
"Mr Winchester my name is Kerry I'm you night nurse, good to see you're awake, how are you feeling are you in any pain?"
"I studied, got my qualifications and handed my degree to my mom then I went on to become a paramedic."
"I just want to go to bed, I'm too tired. So if you're having some sort of party, move somewhere else" he said as Sam pushed him towards the front door
"damn, it is a cutthroat industry but I've never seen anyone drop dead" Dean says looking at Cas questioningly
" yeah, I'll go see him tomorrow, I'm scared though Gabe, what if I get there and he has a wife what would I say I came there to do? I mean no paramedic just visits a patient they helped. Gabe I don't think I could stand the humiliation." Cas said, finding a way to pull out
"it's not too far from the truth, well it kind of is, but Dean Winchester is my boyfriend's brother" he says
"well we were getting there, we said we'd introduce each other to a few relatives and then the accident happened so that had to take a back burner" Sam said, sounding a little sad
"ooooh yeah, I seem to remember those blue eyes, it was a bit hazy but I can never forget such beautiful eyes" Dean says, Cas' cheeks turn red at the complement
"Sammy go get some paper plates and forks, please go with your boyfriend, I'd like to talk to Cas" he says looking Cas straight in the eyes
"well my name is Castiel, I'm 27 years old and I'm a paramedic. You have that now you go" Cas says with a smile on his face
"I'm sorry about your brother. On a lighter note, would you like to go out on a date with me. I really like  your company and I want to know more about you." Dean says taking Cas' hand in his
Castiel made his descent slowly into Hell, fighting and breaking free from the different creatures and cursed souls that were clawing at him, screaming in agony. Ever since he had accepted his mission, his mind had been constantly reeling with questions and doubts as to why he had chosen this path for himself. Better angels than him had tried and failed to infiltrate the dark depths of Hell, why did he think he would do any different?
“Is that blood?” he questioned frantically before leaning to inspect Dean’s foot. He forced Dean to show him the wound, which had started bleeding more than the hunter had realized. “What the fuck Dean, what did you do?” Sam demanded, as he tore one of the bedsheets to start wrapping around his brother’s foot.
Cas’s face brightens at the suggestion, “That sounds like a great idea. Should we leave now Dean?” He turns to face the hunter, a hopeful look on his face. Both the angel and his son looked like two freaking puppies begging for treats. Dean could never say no to that.
“Did they notice anything weird at the scene? Strange smells, drops in temperature, anything?” Dean inquires and goes to join Jack by the boxes of evidence.
The memory filled Cas with some much needed warmth. The endless sea of darkness that surrounded him now always felt so cold. He did not know how long it had been since he was dragged here by
As they neared the waterfall, the sound of roaring water became louder and louder. By the time they were able to make their way behind the stream, the sound was practically deafening. A perfect hiding spot for a monster hiding scared children.
each other again. Dean dropped the bag he was holding and made his way towards the angel. They stood barely a hair’s breadth away from each other. Cas’s breath hitched as he stared at the hunter, eager to close the distance between them, but refusing to make the first move. He needed to know Dean wanted this. He needed to know that it wasn’t all in his head.
With a faint smile, Cas leaned closer until his lips touched Dean's. Saying in a brief touch, more than he could ever voice. Though he knew, he still needed to try and he had a lifetime ahead to do just that.
Cas realized what he had done and quickly sat up to check on the hunter. He held on softly to Dean’s arm. “Are you okay? I'm sorry” his voice soft, afraid he might scare Dean off. The hunter chuckled, like Cas could ever do anything to make him leave. He smirked at Cas, “I’ll be okay when you’re inside me.” Those simple words seemed to ignite a flame inside the angel and he quickly bent down to take a bottle of lube out from the bag near the bed. A bottle that Dean would later remark as being conveniently placed, earning him an eye-roll from his lover.
“Come on Jack, you have some flying to do. I can help you get started.” He said as he unrolled the bundle, and handed the string to the boy. He guided him through the basic principle, and as usual, Jack was great at picking up new things. New hobbies and passions for kite-flying included.
After the pizza had come and gone, and their chatter began to die out, Jack and Sam decided to very pointedly call it a night.
Cas pressed his lips against Dean’s neck, aiming for a strategically placed freckle he had seen there. He took soft nips at the skin and revelled when Dean tilted his head to the side to allow him better access. The hunter’s hands had found their way to Cas’s hips, and were urgently trying to untuck his lover’s shirt.
Dean meets Jack’s hopeful gaze and rolls his eyes. “Alright, fine. But we are going to the hotel to change out of these monkey suits first.” Dean grumbles.
“Man, we have been through a lot of shit, but...” a small sigh escaped him as he reached for the beer they had bought earlier. He offered one to Cas and one to Sam before taking one for himself, “It’s good to see that at least one of us is still happy.” He feigns a cheer by raising the beer in the air and takes a swig.
The ice cream parlor was a short drive from their hotel. They arrived to find several families sitting in front of the parlor enjoying their delicious, cold treats on a hot summer’s day. It was like a scene from a fifties movie. When they walked into the parlor, they were immediately hit by the delicious smell of warm waffle cones. Most of the tables were occupied by couples smiling and feeding each other ice cream sundaes. Dean and Cas stood out like a sore thumb.
“Heads up, one of the gremlins is on the move.” Dean tenses, keeping an eye on the bathroom as the kid keeps walking steadily towards it. The tension broken, they both spring back into action.
He stands in front of his brother’s room and bangs on the door. “DEAN!” he screams at the top of his lungs, his voice strained from the exertion. As he prepares to bang on the door again, it suddenly swings open in front of him. Sam releases his grip on his gun when he sees his brother standing in the doorway. He is still wearing his sleep clothes, hair slightly tousled and eyes barely open. He definitely just woke up.
“Looks like we have the rest of the night to ourselves” Cas whispered conspiratorially into the space between them. Dean couldn’t help but get lost in the former angel’s gaze as he wrapped his arms around him a bit tighter. He could feel Cas’s warm body against his and he truly never wanted to let go again.
Chuck often wondered what his life would have turned out like if he had never decided to dabble in the literary arts. To the false prophet, his life ended the day he wrote “Supernatural” on his empty Word document. He had created everything, yet no creation had ever cursed him more than writing the Winchesters into existence.
"Hell Cas, I need- no... Dammit I.. I love you Cas. So, I am begging you here, don't leave us just like every other godforsaken person I have ever loved. Don't you dare leave."
“Alright, so the kid said she was being held in a cave?” Dean asks, looking at the pictures of the drawings that Crystal had sent them for reference.
Sam huffed. “If only we could do that with large bodies of water.” He takes a moment and sighs. “Okay, we haven’t found much yet, but what you are describing sounds like something more powerful than a ghost. There’s not a lot of things we know that do mind control. That should help narrow the list.”
He was jarred from his thoughts when he heard his name be called. Closing his eyes, he focused on the sound inside his head, trying to pinpoint its source.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack’s eyes were wide with fear bubbling behind them. He worked his mouth open and closed, trying to speak, but found he had no words. Sam stepped closer to him and pressed his warm hand on his son’s shoulder. It was a reassuring weight and it helped Jack ground himself.
Her room is bright purple with flowers painted all over the walls. Her toys are neatly piled in a bin at the far end of her room. Maria is sitting on the floor drawing when they come in. She doesn’t acknowledge any of them as they walk in. Crystal gives one last glance at the men and gestures for them to go ahead. Cas walks in first, dropping to sit on the floor next to the child. Maria stops drawing and looks up to the angel expectantly. She has beautiful curly hair and big, brown eyes. For a moment, she reminds Cas of the children’s movie Dean made him watch about a small doe.
Sam came running down the hall, his hair dripping water from his recent shower, making his clothes stick to his body. “Jack, I heard a commotion, what’s go-
Castiel's eyes widened at the recognition. He struggled to try and understand what the man before him was. As if noticing his inner struggle, the man continued: "Before you go all crazy at me with questions, Yes I am an angel. No, I am not a Cupid but yes, I have your mission"
Dean blinks once, twice, trying to come to terms with what just happened. He was sure that Cas was going to… He snaps out of his train of thought at the angel’s question. He nods slowly, swallowing thickly. “Yeah, uh. It’s enough Cas.” He clears his throat and steps away from the angel. He tries to find solace in cleaning the blade, trying to wash off the evidence of their own private ritual. Even as they settled in their own beds and tried to lull themselves to sleep, both the angel and the hunter felt the atmosphere around them had changed. Dean dreaded having to face tomorrow and tried to drown himself in restless slumber.
''Okay so, this is what's up little bro, since now you have some angel mojo in you you've got some responsibilities. Don't worry nothing too difficult just a silent promise.''
The hunters moved further down the cave, each with a knife and a flashlight in hand. They scanned across the cave walls, looking for any sign of life, or maybe another tunnel they could follow. Their map could only take them so far, from here on, they had to rely on instincts alone.
Cas looked down at his feet as if he was searching for something he had dropped. Then he raised his head and his eyes met Dean’s. The hunter held his gaze. “I shared this with Dean years ago. And yet...” A soft smile decorated the angel’s features.
“Great, we can get some nougat. I would love some nougat right now.” Jack added with a toothy smile.
That is when the real trouble started. Dean failed to notice the strand of cheese before he took the bite he promised he would. Which is how he found himself inches from the angel with a literal cheesy smile plastered over both of their faces. It was like some twisted version of Lady and the Tramp. Dean didn’t need a map to figure out he was definitely the tramp in this situation. Cas was too perfect to be anything other than the lady.
Dean’s eyes were fueled by rage and grief; they were unfocused, as if the mere sight of the former angel was enough to light a dark flame within him. Cas held up his arms slowly, willing the other hunter to calm down as he slowly stepped to place himself between Dean and his son.
The entity huffed and narrowed its eyes. “You’re right, I tried that two decades ago and yet, here you are still
Dean would make sure of it. As he woke to the new day, pulled from his dreams by his phone ringing, he swore tio himself he would kill Garth. It was waay too early to be up. Especially after such a late night party last night. However as Dean reached for his phone, he frowned. It was Sam. Normally, he would be delighted to hear from his little Sammy, but it was early and that gigantor brother of his wouldn't call so early other than in an emergency.
“Uh, morning Cas.” The hunter mumbled as he shot up from their shared bed, nearly knocking over the bedside lamp in the process. He clears his throat and takes a scared glance down at himself. Still clothed. Good. “I'm gonna, uh. We need to. Yeah,”Dean stammered and proceeded to lock himself in the bathroom to get ready for their day.
As he had grudgingly started to accept his fate he felt a tug, a strong pull and a barely audible whisper, one dragged whisper saying: "Very Well..." He thought himself as insane when he thought he saw a flash of a golden... Feather? But he had no time to dwell on it because now he was falling. His confusion only grew at this, why had this happened? Who had he wronged in his life? Was he going to hell? His chest was closing in his fears doubled when he saw dim light ahead of him, he tried to breathe but it was like he had forgotten how.
” She invites the hunters into the room, and the detectives share a look before sighing and turning to them. One of them is tall with black cropped hair and hazel colored eyes. His partner is shorter, built like a linebacker, with a tattoo on his left forearm.
!” He tried to remember the little Spanish he knew from his high school days but held up four fingers just to be sure he got it right.
Cas offered the recovered card to him, a shy smile on his lips. “I guess it's been too long since I was able to simply exist like this.” His voice held a certain warmth to it, one that his small smile betrayed even further. He was happy. It had been too long since Sam saw him like that.
“I wasn’t going to mention it,” Castiel continued lamely, his intense gaze resting on the hunter’s blushing face. The freckles were even more obvious under his quickly reddening cheeks. Cas tried fruitlessly to remedy what was quickly becoming an awkward situation. Dean simply cleared his throat and nodded before quickly continuing on their path up the tree.
“Rise and shine, sunshine!” Dean exclaimed, suddenly eager to yell now that Cas was actually awake. A small warmth grew in the angel’s chest when he heard the endearment Dean had used so many times before.
Both angels knelt before the plants, taking in the other wild specimens growing with abandon. Each inch that they claimed felt like another inch that nature won over humankind. A small space that these delicate flowers managed to carve for themselves in a world that made it impossible to breathe. Cas found a kindred solace at the thought.
The dirt path wound around the entire rainforest and was frequented by many spelunkers and tourists. It was a popular path because of how closely the canopy covered the road. Large, oak-like trees towered over everyone that walked in the path, even over a giant moose like Sam. Gigantic spade-shaped leaves bent down from the weight of the morning dew collecting on their surface. Drops of water falling could be heard all around them and gave the whole space a constant illusion of rainfall. The air was crisp and cool, which only served to refresh them as they walked. The sun glimmered against every raindrop and made the entire forest seem resplendent.
Castiel could not meet her eyes, which meant that she had her answer. Hannah sighed and turned to face forward, just as the Council leader began to speak. At the sound of the man's echoing voice, Castiel looked up.
"Shut up," Dean growled. "Let me make this simple for you Cas. You may be an angel, but you are much more than that to us. To me."
“No, I’m not tired. I can help, I can be-”  Jack trailed off into yet another yawn, his arms stretching over his head, “-useful.”
It was dark, raining, the road slippery. The windshield barely visible, headlights of the car shining uselessly through the night. Castiel was driving, no, he was speeding on trying to get to his job as a museum inspector. He would identify all the new arrivals and authenticate them. A new shipment had arrived early in the night and he couldnt wait until morning so he caught himself driving in this late night storm.
“Yeah, we are okay. She was about to take another poor kid, but I think Cas stopped her.” Dean added, sparing a glance in Cas’s direction.
Gabriel smirked and snapped his fingers. Castiel felt an unidentifiable tug at his back and a sudden burst of wind behind him, though when he looked back all he saw was black. Midnight black feathers covering the wings that portruded from his shoulder blades. A strangled gasp almost whimper fell from his throat and he looked back at Gabriel in an expression of horror as the archangel smirked and spoke again. His voice was merely a rumble in the white noise Castiel was hearing but he still caught the archangel's words.
Dean and Sam turned to him then, a million questions and worries running through their heads. Jack kept staring at where his father used to be, and uttered a single word. One word that suddenly made the pit in Dean’s stomach drop even lower.
Dean’s mouth went dry, the tell-tale warmth in his chest returned and he could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage. “Uh, what do you mean Cas?” he asked dumbly. Barely able to maintain a straight face once the angel was close enough to smell his cologne.
“Well, I guess you angels aren’t as all-knowing as you thought” Dean teased, his brow raised in Cas’s direction.
“Cas, are you okay? CAS!” the boy’s voice broke on the last syllable. His eyes wide and scared. He looked as terrified as Dean had looked every time he had held Cas in his arms as he died.
?” the hunter stopped solidly in his tracks, almost colliding with the former angel. His eyes widened and became glossy with unshed tears, he sprung forward and pulled Cas into a hug that nearly broke his spine in half. Cas couldn’t help the soft smile that appeared on his face as he hugged the enormous hunter back. They were so close, if only he could make Dean understand.
“They are not yours. You stole them.” Dean prodded, trying to get closer to her. She turned to face the hunter again, but kept a close eye on Cas, rooting him to the spot.
The sound of a phone ringing pulled him out of his train of thought. He stalked towards his phone, dreary of whom the caller might be... His suspicions were confirmed. "What do you want Garth?" He rasped, far harsher than he had meant.
Cas blushed even further as he slowly brought his hands up to cup Dean’s jaw. He stared into those earthy-green eyes and smiled before pressing a chaste kiss against the hunter’s lips. “You are a work of art Dean,” he murmured softly as he slowly caressed the hunter’s cheek with his thumb, “the only thing I will miss about being an angel is being able to bask in the glory that was your soul. Nothing will ever shine as bright for me.”
Sam cleared his throat and snapped Dean and Cas out of their impromptu staring contest.  “So, uh I found a website for a place called
“Well Cas, it looks like we are getting close to the end of our little field trip”, Dean joked, trying to come across as nonchalant, but failing miserably.
He could hear the phone ringing through the thin walls of their motel, which meant that the phone was certainly working. Sam quickly stood, startling Jack who had just taken a seat by the small couch to watch TV with his coffee.
“A couple of months probably. I don’t know man, I ain’t a cop. They just ask to put up the posters and I let them.” The cashier didn’t meet their eyes anymore. He kept cleaning the countertop in front of them, his interest in Dean seemingly lost.
Cas took a moment to really listen, his head tilting slightly to the side as he concentrated. His grace was weaker than it used to be eons ago, but every day he was slowly gaining a bit of his strength back. Regardless, he couldn’t sense a presence, or hear the screeching that he had come in contact with the day before. Just as he was about to tell Dean, he heard it. A small, fragile voice asking for help. It was far away still, but Cas could hear them clear as day.
Gabriel started eating a new lolipop. "Well you sure dont dance around the point do you? Well to be able to bring yoj back into a vessel on Earth without your soul burning to a crisp in the fall I had to alter it a bit."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas nods solemnly and moves to get out the car. Sam follows suit and they make their way to the house. It’s a humble, single-story house in the middle of Vega Baja, a beach town. The house is worn down, but it still has a comforting vibe to it. You can hear the ocean closeby, a sound that Sam will never get used to. A lady answers the door after the first knock. She has short, grey hair that she has tucked away behind her ears. She eyes the men suspiciously, opening the door just a crack.
“Is sleeping on top of another person more comfortable than sleeping on a bed?” The boy asks, his entire attention dedicated to his father.
Dean looked nervously towards where the young guy had disappeared. He was a little on edge after hearing her scream, but when nothing exploded, he decided to ignore that part of his brain. He shook his head, and she went back to preparing the cups of coffee.
Cas blushed as he reached for the menu that Sam was handing him and took his time reading it. It had been years since he was human, so he wanted to enjoy the best perk of mortality at its fullest: food. Yet, after reading the menu three times he still couldn’t decide on what to order. Even as the others started giving their orders to the nice waitress, Cas struggled to make a decision. However, when he heard Dean order, a sudden clarity came over him. Once the waitress turned to him, he just gave her a cheerful smile and said, “I’ll have the same thing my boyfriend ordered.”
“Nothing. I tried calling and you didn’t answer. I got worried. I’ll let both of you get ready...” The words rushed out of Sam’s mouth, eager to leave before he exploded in glee.
Sam and Jack sat beside their hotel room’s table in companionable silence surrounded by various lore books strewn across the floor. Father and son typing away on their respective computers trying to find the monster that was plaguing the little community. . Though he wished the situation was different, Sam was grateful to be spending time with their son,
“A bonding ritual? What like marriage?” Dean asked incredulously. He left the food on the table in favor of walking toward his brother and the angel.
They spent a long while talking and catching up until Charlie's phone rang. She answered with a bright smile. "Thanks for calling LARP Supplies and Beyond, this is Charlie speaking"
A shadow came over the boy’s eyes as he chose his next words carefully. “Dean hasn’t been the same since we lost you,” he muttered with a hint of sadness.
"Why? We won Cas, we’re free." Sam countered, getting a little bit closer to the angel, almost as if he could make him stay just by staring him down. Castiel was afraid he might succeed.
“There were seven kids taken from different locations, but always near some form of water,” Edgar mutters joining them at the board. “First kid near a river, second kid the ocean, etc.” He pointed at each location on the map.
With a steadying breath, Jack finally met Dean’s eyes as he questioned “Well, do you remember when I died and went to Heaven?”
HEY GUYS! Its been a while but feels really nice being able to update! So here without further ado.. the new chapter! (BARE WITH ME THIS PLOT IS A BIT LENGTHY)
”. They are shape-shifting river spirits that use songs to control the minds of their victims, normally children.” Sam says, over his laptop.
“What the hell are you?” Dean demanded as he stared at the monster’s glowing blood. She grinned, and tried to take a few steps forward, but hesitated when Dean raised the blade in her direction once again.
“They had one in the kid’s room facing the bathroom, which is where the kid disappeared. We checked the footage, but there was nothing on it.” Edgar plays the clip for them anyway, tension evident in their shoulders.
It was supposed to be only one game. That’s what he had agreed to. One round of some hipster card game that Sammy insisted they should get during their last supply run. “Cards Against Humanity is a millennial tradition Dean, we need to get this.” Sam had begged, and Dean could never say no to those puppy dog eyes.
The angel shakes his head, feeling his cheeks burn with what he now understood was blush. They sat in companionable silence for a while, nothing but the warm sun and soft breeze hitting their backs.
He remembers hearing Sam chuckle at his brother, but not making any move to correct his words. They all knew it was true. Through thick and thin, through hell and high water, they would always be there for each other. Cas still wishes they could go back. The fondness that the memory brings him, fills him with pride, even to this day.
The entity paused, making the throne in front of it disappear with a flick of its wrist. As it turned around to face Cas again, its semblance changed. It was no longer a formless void of goo, but a version of himself. Cas recognized the long coat and messed-up hair, it was himself from over 10 years ago. As if he had been plucked right from the night he saved Dean Winchester for the first time.
“And what does that have to do with you suddenly realizing personal space is a thing?” Dean probes. “What about today huh? With the ice cream and the staring?”
“I don’t, but judging by your expression for the past hour, it looks like you could use a break.” Cas challenged as he held the hunter’s gaze.
“Servitude? What, so whoever took the kids was looking for a couple of handmaidens?” Dean looked between them, his fists clenched at his side. The thought of someone taking innocent children was bad enough, but making them slaves? Something about Cas’s face alerted Dean that there was something else.
He would tell himself whenever he felt that dangerous spark get near. That unbridled happiness that he kept at bay from the Empty’s grasp. They had defeated God, but the vast unknown still awaited him in Death. Billie had made certain he could never forget that. Yet —even with that deal looming over his head— Cas still allowed himself these tender moments with his family. That is what they were now, a family.
Dean hazarded a glance in the angel’s direction. They were walking side by side on a particularly long branch. The exertion from climbing had gotten to Cas. His cheeks were slightly flushed and his hair was starting to stick a little to his forehead. He had taken off his trenchcoat two branches ago and tied it around his waist. He was rolling up his sleeves as they walked and Dean’s mouth suddenly went dry at the sight of Cas’s strong forearms.
Dean doubled over laughing at the angel’s awkward retort, much to Cas’s chagrin. He walked towards the angel and wrapped his arm around his shoulders as he breathed in “Oh buddy,” Dean said between laugh-filled breaths “we need to work on your flirting.”
“Hi, Dean” Jack managed to say through a yawn, as he stretched his arms over his head. His face broke into a soft, dopey smile once he laid eyes on the coffee sitting on the table. He made his way over as well and grabbed a cup of coffee with both hands. He relished the warmth on his fingertips and took a deep breath. In spite of his sweet tooth, he loved coffee. Dean smiled at the kid and reached out to ruffle his blonde hair while a small warmth bloomed in his chest.
From the front of the store, a young man stopped cleaning the tables and ran towards the counter. He stared at Dean for a couple seconds before facing her. “
Escape. He still needed to get out of here. He needed to reach the surface again. The corridor he had been walking through was an expanse of nothing no matter which direction he faced. Unless, he didn't face the corridor. What if he faced the walls?
Castiel sighed. He knew something like this would happen. He steeled himself, preparing for the news. "What else?"
. With the family I see.” Mirna smiled brightly at all of them as she set Dean’s plate in front of him. She had an air of caring and strength about her, and she reminded Sam of Missouri. One glance at Dean told him he felt the same.
“That sounds lovely, Dean. I am glad to see you are enjoying yourself. You look oddly charming with a sunburn” Cas caught himself before he could let out any other compliments and put some much needed distance between them. He sat by the bed and fiddled with his trenchcoat. There was a strange look on his face. A look that Dean couldn’t quite place. He was hiding something. It seemed like they were all hiding things from each other these days.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean whispered under his breath. Cas smirked and moved slightly forward to place a delicate kiss on the top of the hunter’s cock, “Trust me, that is definitely my intention, Dean.” His voice sounded wrecked with arousal and Dean had to bury a hand in the angel’s hair just to compose himself. That only served to excite him further once the angel moaned at the slight pull.
.’ It's a brand new ice cream parlor in San Juan. It seems like a place that would attract a considerable amount of children and well...”
Sam shook his head, still trying to contain his laughter. His eyes were shining brightly, he was happy for his brother. The hunters stayed in Sam and Jack’s room, talking about other details of the case before they all parted ways to start packing. Sadly, their vacation would end tomorrow. That night, they all slept soundly. At peace with the work they had achieved, and the lives they had saved.
He was getting desperate. The warm memories he kept replaying in his head were becoming dimmer as he tried desperately to hold on to them. Every hug he had ever shared with the Winchesters or Jack, every laugh throughout his 10 years of knowing them, his first kiss with Dean; all of these memories slowly fading away from his grace. Each moment of fondness was being slowly replaced by sickening fear and dread. The memories he had tried so hard to hide, the ones he ran away from whenever he was alone, were all coming back to haunt him. Each memory tied to a visceral pain that trembled across his body.

Every thrust into Dean pushed him dangerously close to the edge. Until one particular thrust had Dean seeing stars. Cas noticed how the hunter’s breathy moan turned into a guttural scream and quickly readjusted his hips to hit that precise spot again.
He could feel himself rising. It felt strangely reminiscent of pulling Dean out of Hell. If Hell was a giant puddle of black Jello instead of a den of horrid monsters and iniquity that wanted nothing more than to kill him slowly. However, the warmth that spread across his body and slowly pulled him closer to what Cas hoped was the surface, reminded him vividly of Dean. Reminded him of putting his hand around his lover’s shoulder, marking him with their newly formed bond. A mark that, though not physically present anymore, was still seared onto Dean’s brilliant soul. Cas loved getting lost in the memory of it.
He was expecting a boring, bald and short man with a temper but instead... Oh instead he got Jimmy Novak.
“This rain forest was nominated to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World." Cas beamed, his eyes scanning the canopy above them as they walk. "Even though it didn't win, I believe it still holds its own small wonders." The angel adds as he caresses the leaves hanging closest to him. Dean stares at his friend and smiles quietly to himself, content for the first time in years. "We have our own wonders too.”
Cas takes a moment to orient himself. He had woken up slightly earlier, but when he noticed Dean resting on his chest, he decided to let him sleep. He had looked so peaceful, he didn’t want to risk waking him by moving. What the angel didn’t understand was Dean’s reaction. He seemed nervous to have woken up like this. A part of him would go as far as to say he looked
“Jesus, Cas, could you have any more layers on?” Dean groaned when he noticed the former angel’s undershirt beneath his dress shirt, making a point of tugging against it dramatically, almost as if he could will it away with one thought. When Cas was still an angel, he could have, but he pointedly ignores that thought.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Dean,” the angel began as he set the last plate on the counter next to him. He turned to face the hunter fully once he was convinced he had his attention.
Castiel turned towards the beat up doors of the bar and took a steadying breath. As he pushed in the bar, he was surprised by what he found inside. There seemed to be just a normal crowd, drinking, playing pool, talking, etc. He had expected something a bit more... Angelic? He shook his head as if to clear his thoughts.
Jack finds a teddy bear in one of the boxes and turns it around. A small string was hanging from the back of the bear’s collar. He pulls on it and finds a zipper which he opens. There was a battery pack inside. “Dean, why would a stuffed animal require batteries?” The detectives turn to look at what Jack is holding and scramble over quickly to take the bear out of his hands.
“Alright, then let’s go find the monsters and save the kids,” Jack exclaimed, practically falling out of the backseat. He was held back when he felt Cas gently grab his arm. “We would Jack, but we don’t really know if these cases are ‘up our alley’, so to speak.” The angel’s face was open, trying his best to help Jack understand.
He closed the gap between them, and the moment their lips touched, Dean felt a sun’s warmth burn inside him. Eleven years of waiting for this moment. Eleven years of
“Alright, so what monsters do we know that are crying women that drag kids into caves? Cause that don’t sound like anything I’ve seen before.” Dean said around a mouthful of his sweet plantain burger.
And just like that, it did. For a second at least. Then the memories came back in full force, punching the breath out of his imagined lungs. There was no physical body in the Empty. Souls were left bare, struggling to remain in the shape of the vessel they had last adhered to. Another painful reminder of how they tried fruitlessly to hold on to their life. To save what remained of  themselves.
Cas sighs in defeat and moves to stand when he feels a slight pressure on his right hand. He follows it and finds Dean’s hand covering his own. “Let’s stay a little while longer?” Dean whispered, his voice weak and unsure. Whatever air was left in Cas’s lungs is knocked out of him. Cas is overcome with emotion, trying his best to fight against the tears. He nods, and Dean released a breath he did not know he was holding. They stay like that, sitting peacefully next to each other on the blanket, hands clasped and relishing in each other’s company. There’s a lot they should talk about, but for now? For now, it’s just them.
Castiel followed as Gabriel led him out the double doors of the room, walking into a long white hallway with bright lights and painting on the walls. AS subtle yellowish paint covered the walls, made everything have like an old mansion feel. He recognized some of the paintings and sculptures along the walls from his time working as the museum curator. He wondered what his job as an angel would be now. Was there a museum in Heaven? Was he in Heaven anyway? Why had he been saved and brought here. He thought back to his life, he had not been very special, led a normal boring life always waiting for a big break.. but somehow he didn't have any regrets.
“What are you talking about Cas?” Jack says tilting his head slightly as he inches slightly closer to his father.
,” she adds, and at that moment a marking carved on her chest lights up. The same two circles and a line crossing through them. “I will
“Here you go.” She placed it between the coffee cups with a warm smile. “No one can stay sad with one of Mirna’s famous
“This doesn’t seem fair,” Cas teased as he flattened his palms against Dean’s chest, “you still have too many clothes on” he practically purred into Dean’s ear, sending a pleased shiver down the hunter’s spine. Dean nodded and pulled his Zeppelin t-shirt over his head and tossed it haphazardly to the side.
One leaf falls delicately on Cas’s head. The angel grabs it and stares at it with a small smile on his face. At that moment, fleeting rays of sunlight cut through the canopy and fall on the angel’s face. For a brief moment, Cas looks downright angelic, shiny halos and all. The last of Dean’s hesitation is gone then. “Cas, can I ask you a question?”
The tugging became insistent, trying to pull him further in, but his grace prevented him from falling.
“Very funny Cas, uh let's dig in!” Dean shouted a little louder than he needed to as he opened the first box and the delicious smell of the pizza flooded the room, making Jack’s mouth water. It made him forget all about the joke he did not get. The boy grabbed a slice and a beer before he settled in his usual seat next to Sam.
Dean is sitting next to the angel. He noticed Cas was staring at the table and followed his gaze. “Is the menu that interesting?”
. They had both seen the state that Dean had been in once Cas disappeared, and the worry kept gnawing the former angel’s heart. He never wanted to see Dean that low again.
Some of the parents mulled around them at the station, thanking them profusely for their efforts. The pure joy in the children’s faces made up for every drop of bloodshed. They had helped reunite families. Cas looked at his own makeshift family. Dean and Sam clearing up some final facts with the detectives, and his son Jack, who was currently at a vending machine buying a candy bar for one of the kids. The angel felt his heart glow as it filled up with love and pride. Each of them had their own wayward story, but they had managed to find a home in each other. That is something he would never give up.
That’s when it happened. As Dean saw those fiery dots in the sky, a memory that was buried deep from years of disuse came back to the forefront of his mind. He remembered the day the angels fell, and the fireballs he watched tumble from the Heavens as he stood outside of that cursed church. The day that going back to Heaven had been officially burned from Cas’s destiny. There was no going back for him after Metatron. Yet, after all these years Dean had never quite realized it. Deep down, he had tried to ignore the weight of the sacrifices that Cas had made for them, as if ignoring them would make them any less true. Yet, the truth was that their goofy angel had gone to bat for them in more ways than one. Without hesitation, and -hopefully- without regret. His train of thought brought up a question that he had not thought to ask after all these years.
He tossed the flake of paint aside and made his fourth attempt to get out of bed that day. It was already 11:37pm according to his clock, but time didn’t really matter either. He had spent the last 12 hours tossing and turning under the covers, unable to sleep or focus on anything for any period of time. His sweat-stained t-shirt clung to his unshowered body, since the trip to the shower didn’t seem worth it. A waste of energy to get clean just to get dirty again. It wasn’t like soap could remove his stains, he was dirty and rotten to his core.
Hey guys! Sorry for taking so long to update! Finals have been busy! I'm going on a trip so I might delay a bit again but this story definitely continues. I'm taking a break from My Dearest Blogger because of some writer's block. But feel free to check out the content I have so far! Thanks and Happy Holidays!
“What brings you to Puerto Rico? A honeymoon?” she asked with a wink as she wiped her hands on her apron, before coming to ring him up on the register.
“And here I was thinking that you had a thing for that pizza man,” Dean teased as he wriggled his brow.
Dean stilled and a smile slowly crept its way onto his face. His baby brother was having a baby. A gush of pride went through him. He remembered going to Sam's graduation from Harvard Law, listening to his brother explain to him his new job at the museum. It never made sense to Dean what could make a person literally devote their life to dusty books but that was Sam did and he was happy, so Dean was too. Now he was going to be a father, he was going to have a child to protect, just ike Dean did when his mother died and his father gave up on them.
That is how they spent four hours of their family game night, going back and forth with who was the funniest and relishing the peaceful atmosphere. Cas would be lying if he said he didn’t enjoy this particular game just because of how it made Dean laugh. Everytime the hunter picked his card as the winner, their eyes would meet and for a brief moment the angel could swear he saw Dean’s soul get slightly brighter. Every time he laughed, his laughter echoed in the large war room and completely engulfed Cas in that blissful sound.
Dean’s tears came unbidden as he captured the former angel in another searing kiss. He tried to press their bodies impossibly closer as he let his hands roam towards Cas’s naked back. He had never felt this kind of unconditional devotion and love in his life, and he realized that he was probably going to become addicted to this feeling.“I love you too, Cas” Dean mumbles between kisses and is immediately rewarded with an almost-sob from the former angel.
She handed him the white box with the four coffees balanced on top of it. “You know what? Wait here.” She took a napkin from next to the register and reached for one of the top pastries in the glass case. It looked like a swirled puff filled with cream and covered with chocolate and powdered sugar.
Cas made his way to the bed hesitantly. He placed one hand on Dean’s shoulder and sat next to him, their thighs touching. “I know this must be difficult for you. Especially now that-” Cas looks briefly at Jack over Dean’s shoulder, “now that you understand what it means to be a father. We will find whoever or whatever is responsible. I promise.”
It was as he kicked the soul of a chained headless man off his shoulders, that he felt it. The intensity of the burning went beyond anything he had ever felt, yet it did not harm him. He felt a strange, ethereal pull pulsate through his entire being and just mindlessly followed its origin. There, in the midst of horrible darkness and despair, he saw it. The brightest soul he had ever laid eyes upon, the soul of Dean Winchester.
Cas looked at Dean once more with that furrowed expression and squinted gaze that could only be categorized as ‘fucking cute’. “What do you mean?” Castiel asked incredulously.
Dean shrugged as he turned towards his son, but could not quite meet his eyes. “Both, I guess?” he added when he realized Jack was still firmly looking at the road.
He admits it was not the most elaborate of poems but it always boosted his ego, if that even is possible anymore. Yeah, Dean had always been really popular which is why in moments like this he questioned where all his luck had gone?
poured into a single kiss. The angel sighed into the kiss and the entire moment felt like coming home for the very first time. Every nerve ending collapsed in that moment, short-circuiting Dean’s brain to only register this moment. He felt Cas’s hands caress his back, pulling their bodies closer. There were eleven years worth of words said in just this one moment.
Cas disappears from their table and suddenly appears in the bathroom before the child reaches it. The faucet opens of its own accord when he appears and water starts running down the sink. He can hear something from under the sound of running water. A screeching, ear tearing sound that reminds the angel of wailing. The sound is paralyzing, even to his angelic ears, yet no one outside of the bathroom seems to hear it. He struggled but managed to close the faucet and made the screeching stop.
Cas had initially disapproved of playing the game with Jack, saying he was still too young to understand any of the context. Yet, the moment Jack had placed the cards: Donald Trump has nominated
Cas returned to the table holding two ice cream pops. He slid the chocolate one towards Dean, actually intent on having the hunter try it. Dean met Cas’s eyes and tilted his head towards the family close to them. “Those two seem about six years old right?”
“I know what you are doing” Cas spoke in a smooth, teasing voice that went straight to Dean’s groin.
It was hard to argue with his own mind, especially when he knew it was right. He had been a mess these last few weeks, but one hug from Cas and he, he was
Dean wished he could say that they were now on even footing. Yet, as he took in the sight of Cas’s shirtless, strong, and tanned chest, flushed cheeks and eyes drowning in lust, Dean finds himself completely positive that he had died and somehow went to heaven.
"Hey Dean!!" Charlie answered in her bright tone. Dean couldn't help but smile and feel a little relief at hearing her usual cheerful voice. "Hey Charlie." He rasped not realizing how sleepy his voice sounded before then.
Gabriel picked up some sand from the box. His never ending grin on his face. Some sand ran through his fingers. Castiel stared intently as if the sand held all the answers he was looking for. Gabriel looked up at the angel and materialized a blade from thin air. The angel recoiled scared now of the archangel.
. For a moment, Dean could have sworn that Cas was staring at him. Yet, as soon as he tried to meet his eyes, Cas turned his attention away to the apparently fascinating window.
As she speaks and slowly works through telling her side of the story, Cas translates for Sam. “I was at the beach with my
Mirna nodded her knowing approval, happy to see Dean enjoying himself. She finished giving everyone’s breakfast order and quickly left towards the kitchen, but not before winking in Sam’s direction. A gesture that was not lost on any of the other men, and they teased him endlessly for.
As the next memory tried to creep up on him, he focused all of his effort into thwarting the memories. Even as the pain began, he closed his eyes and brought his grace towards his brain. The closer he got to focusing his energy, the more insistent the bad thoughts became. They started cycling over and over in his head:
“It...it means ‘lost or missing’ in Spanish,” Dean muttered while turning his attention to the cashier once more. “Say, how long has this been up?”
The sun is starting to set and it paints the horizon in a warm, orange glow. The waves curl slowly over themselves in the distance, creating ripples of white foam at their base.
Once they returned to the car, Dean called Sam and filled him in on what he had seen. They agreed to meet up either at the hotel or a diner to get something to eat once they had finished interviewing the victims. They could decide later, per Sam’s request. Dean hung up the phone, looked at Jack sitting in the passenger seat and grinned.
Later that Christmas day, Chuck would walk into his living room once more, and find the Dean and Cas ornaments sitting proudly upon Castiel’s perch wrapped in each other's arms. As it was meant to be.
“I- I just can’t Sammy,” his voice trembled and his eyes filled with unshed tears. “We were so close to-” he tried to continue, but his words failed him.
Castiel nodded understanding his mission. After downing his drink, Balthazar stood and looked at Castiel as if he was examining his looks closely. "Oh you'll be perfect for it too. Your eyes are a plus, the dirty trenchcoat? Well, it will do I guess. Good luck Cassie"
Dean nodded in agreement but didn’t quite meet Cas’s eyes. He walked out the door with his friend in tow. Once they were back in the car, Cas reached for his phone and called Sam, putting him on speakerphone.
Jack’s head tilted slightly and his brows furrowed. “Why would someone take children and not kill them?” A sudden, tense silence overcame the car. It was suffocating.
A huge scream tore from Cas, screeching and jarring, it almost reminded Dean of the first time Cas had tried to reach out to him. But, this time it felt wrong, jagged and painful.
, Dean thought as a cold chill raced down his spine. Each of the boys crossed the stream and jumped into the cave entrance. Sam dove in first, while he cursed and hissed at the water’s cold temperature. He took a moment to tie his soaking wet hair back and away from his face. The rest of the hunters followed suit with their own string of profanities.
, just so you could stand there and-” his voice was steadily rising, unable to keep the emotion out of his words, “-and doubt me? No, I don’t think so Dean Winchester.”
As Castiel turned to leave the brothers alone, he felt a hand grab onto his sleeve. When he turned around he felt arms wrap themselves around his vesse- his body. Dean was holding on to him like he never intended on letting go.
Cas rolled his eyes, but couldn’t keep his smile from lighting up his whole face. He drew his chair closer to the hunter’s and reached for the slice. Cas held the pizza close to his face and took a huge bite which oozed delicious cheese all over his face. Even as he gave the slice back to Dean, the cheese stretched along refusing to be cut.
“I am not sure. It felt like your brother shocked me, b-” Cas began to explain, but at that moment Dean woke up with a start. He shot up quickly, nearly hitting Sam’s face and startling the three men. His eyes were opened wide and frantic, and he quickly turned to face the angel. “Cas,” he said breathlessly. The burning in Cas’s arm intensified at the sound, and he finally pulled back his sleeve. There, he uncovered a set of words etched underneath his skin. The same words that had taken over Dean’s mind.
“Go away Jack, please leave me alone” a rough, sad voice came muffled through the door, and something broke inside of Cas. He recognized the voice as Dean’s, but he seemed far away, like his voice had lost its familiar warmth. Jack turned to his father once more, his eyes wide and afraid, almost as if he was begging him to do something.
“CAS, what the hell is wrong? Talk to me” Dean shouted, trying to keep his hold on the angel, but he dropped to the floor and hunched over his stomach. The screams only got louder. Sam and Jack burst through the kitchen door, a terrified look on their faces. That’s when Dean saw It.
Both hunters were practically immobilized by the sounds, dropping to their knees with their hands pressed tightly against their ears. For a brief moment, Dean was reminded of the last time he had felt like this. The pain he had felt when Cas tried to contact him in his angelic form. Somehow, the screeching that filled his ears now was worse. The angel, however, wasn’t affected. The screeching buzzed in his ears, but he was able to pinpoint the source of it.
The hunter sighed, “Heaven, his powers, his garrison, everything he ever had.” His voice kept getting quieter as he spoke, barely coming above a whisper near the end, as if voicing his doubt would make his worst fears come true.
She looked towards Dean and her smile fell a little. "Yeah I knew Cassie, he was a really good kid it's sad how he-"
Most ornaments ignored the human entirely, but he fascinated Dean. It was living proof that existence was more than just one single day of the year. There was more to life than just a singular tree they decorated. Dean longed to see that world. To find a purpose, his reason for being. Hell, maybe he could even find their creator one day. Dean had a couple things he would like to ask them… and maybe tell them.
Castiel turned towards Hannah, who was speaking to an angel seated beside her. He smiled, memorizing her grace's shine, knowing fully well it might be the last time he saw it. He gently grabbed her hand and watched as her head twirled rapidly in his direction. She seemed to be about to ask him something, but looked into his eyes and stopped. She knew. She had always been able to read his expressions and she knew. She tightened her grip on his hand, and let go, a faint smile on her face as she nodded minutely. That was all Castiel needed.
And so -after a beat- Cas closed his eyes, let his grace seep back within him and took a step into the unknown.
“We already ate ice cream, Dean. I am not sure I am in the mood for more food?” Cas says as his brow furrows in confusion. He stares at the seafood shack in front of them.
He meets the hunter’s gaze. “I love you, Dean. I have known that for years, but it is only recently that I have come to accept-” His stomach drops, afraid of saying what he knows out loud. “Accept that you don’t feel quite the same way. You said it yourself.” For a second, Dean seems to be about to protest, but Cas can’t let himself hope like that anymore.
With a joyful sigh, he responded, “I wouldn’t have it any other way” before diving in for a kiss. The moment that their lips touched, Cas was reminded of their very first kiss. The electric waves of joy and pleasure that erupted from him now paled in comparison to anything he had ever felt before. Because this time he knows, this is his forever. There are no more secrets or burdens between them. They are finally free to be as they are, together and loved, for the first time in decades.
She was cut off and her glassy eyes widened. "Oh yeah I see. His brother? Okay he had mentioned some distant family. Oh I see, well sure you can! We are always glad to help here! Alright see you then! Bye!"
Dean takes over the computer so he can read for himself, standing perhaps a little too close to Cas. A fact which is not lost on Sam, but he decides to ignore for now. “Alright so you found a lead at Blockbuster?” he asks, suspicious.
Cas was the first to stir. He felt detached from his vessel, his grace fighting to bring him back from his involuntary sleep. Sam and Jack’s voices briefly registered, but they seemed thousands of miles away from him. His entire body seemed to burn from a strong heat that was coming from his arm. He slowly opened his eyes to find a bright light that shone above him. Jack’s blurry face came into view, and his voice got louder.
“Sounds like a plan to me” Dean adds with a smile, and braves the distance he never thought he would cross.
“Back when I lived in Heaven, there was one human’s heaven I particularly enjoyed visiting. An autistic man and his perfect Tuesday afternoon. He would fly kites and enjoy the summer breeze. I enjoyed watching him at peace.”
“No idea, maybe some kind of weird vamp nest?” Sam suggested over his laptop, taking a swig from his beer. “Maybe it-” a small snore interrupted him. They all turned to look at the bed nearest to the door. Jack was sprawled out over the sheets, a book laying open on his lap. His chest rising and falling softly. He looked almost angelic.
He loved Cas (still did) and they were so close to having everything they ever wanted. Everything Dean had only dreamed of.  How could he carry on after he knew what he had truly lost?
for Dean. His job as an ornament was simple. All he had to do was look pretty and keep order in his portion of the tree until the clock struck 12 again and Christmas was over. The ornaments were free to roam around the tree and visit each other, as long as the humans were not around and they returned to their respective spots in time. The younger ornaments would run and play while the older ornaments, like Dean, made sure that nothing fell too far out of place. If he did his part to keep the tree alive and ordered just as he had found it when he woke, then all the ornaments would live to see another Christmas.
“That’s a nice theory Jack, but I am afraid that sirens don’t normally attack children,” Cas says as gentle as possible, trying to be supportive of his son.
Sam held him through it, muttering comforting words in his brother’s ear. They were mostly nonsense, but they had helped him when he lost Jess, so he imagined they would help now. Dean eventually ran out of tears, leaving a dry-heaving hunter in their wake. His eyes were closed shut, his face contorted into a permanent frown. Sam gathered his brother into his arms and let him rest against his chest until his breathing evened out, and Dean collapsed into a reluctant sleep. Sam waited until there were slight snores coming from his brother before settling him against his pillows and tucking him in. If he was awake, he would have growled at Sam that he wasn’t a child. But, right now it was just them and Dean didn’t have to pretend anymore, he just needed to rest.
“But first” The angel pushes the dessert closer to his friend. “Try this, it’s very delicious.” He takes his own ice cream and takes a sizeable bite from it.
For a moment, Cas looked up at his normal spot on the tree before turning to stare out the window. “It seems that we are” he finally responded, his voice small.
They stood there for a while, until something seemed to snap Jack to action. He broke out from his father’s embrace and pushed him into the bunker hurriedly.
Cas sighed, easing back once he felt confident Dean wouldn’t run away. “Yes. In order to break the deal, the entity insisted I could never go back there, and the only way to ensure that was-”
“Yeah, judging by the description caves seemed the most logical assumption. I actually looked into it and there aren’t that many caves on the island.” Sam added, opening up his laptop to show them what he had found so far.
Cas let out a small sob, before making his heartfelt promise: “Never again” he wrapped his arms tighter around his hunter, relishing in his warmth. “I’m going to outlive you Winchester” he teased around a teary-eyed laugh.
Cas steeled himself, trying to bury the fear that was rising at being so near this monster, “Let me go back” he demanded.
“Oh, nothing. Watching an Angel of the Lord playing playground parachute against the wind is something I didn't know I needed.” Dean sputtered through what could only be described as maniacal laughter.
Cas rolled his eyes, his smile growing slightly, “I think we both know I wasn’t referring to the pizza” his voice had dropped an entire octave which only made the warmth in Dean’s chest spread further.
“Alright smart guy, enough.” Dean grumbled at Sam. “Did your research find anything about this having harmful side effects?”
Sam grinned to himself, content to see the smile return to his brother’s face. He had missed seeing him be so at peace. Jack, on the other hand, was elated to see his dads finally enjoying and expressing their love for each other. The boy had a seemingly permanent toothy grin whenever Dean and Cas would exchange a look, or a small touch across the table. If they noticed the pictures Jack kept sneaking of the two of them with his phone, they surely never mentioned it. And if said pictures found their way into a picture frame on Jack’s desk, right next to the frames of his mom, Mary and Sam, well they didn’t mention that either.
he thinks. Never has he seen such beauty condensed into one place. One location filled to the brim with new sounds and familiar tastes. Well, at least this is what he wishes his heaven could be. Not one filled with dick angels that couldn’t care less about Earth. He shakes his head. He promised he wouldn't think of work. For all of their sakes. Chuck knows they need the break.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Cas briefly touched his fingers to Dean's temple, the hunter opened his eyes, seemingly in awe and shock at seeing his friend alive again. Dean could feel the angel's grace run through him, healing his cuts, bruises and broken bones. Meanwhile, Cas could sense the gears turning in his friend's mind, analyzing how the angel - who only minutes ago had been blown to bits - could be standing in front of him once again.
Around dinner time, Dean got up and announced he wanted to go get pizza from Ronny’s. Jack perked up at the prospect of more junk food, and Sam just rolled his eyes and told him he would call to place the order because, “that’s the only way we are gonna get any vegetables this time”.
His peace didn’t last too long. One second he was reminiscing of humble beginnings, and the next he was staring straight into the eyes of the entity itself. He had made it to the surface, the air that surrounded him now felt strange, like he was surrounded by wind that had a mind of its own. It blew around him and through him, as if he was not there at all. But Cas knew he was, the entity looked too pissed for this to be another illusion.
“Since when do you need to stretch your legs Cas?” Dean asked raising his brow. Cas met his eyes through the rearview mirror.
Cas followed his gaze back up the hunter’s legs with his hands and stopped at his hips. He held onto Dean’s hips, burying his thumbs into his navel. He was so close to Dean’s dick, that every small exhale made him twitch.
“Any ideas on how exactly to do that Cassie? HMM?” the entity rested its arms on Cas’s shoulders, almost as if it was considering how to swallow him whole and make him disappear.
A/N: Okay so I have to apologize for the last chapter and clear some things up. Just a disclaimer, this story is a work in progress for me, though I have the major plot points worked out so please bear with me.
Cas and Dean knock on his hotel room door 5 minutes later, both of them fully dressed in the clothes they had been wearing when they left. Sam eyes them curiously but lets them pass regardless.
This has been a PSA. Remember to like and comment! I love any feedback or recommendations you can give :)
“I fell from my post because I became...distracted.” Not the whole truth, but not a lie either. It was the best he could do right now.
The entity turned to him then, a blade materializing from nowhere as he lunged for Cas and held him in a vice grip. He stared at the angel for what felt like an eternity, a permanent grin on his face. “Or, I could just kill you again here, right now, and be done with you”.
Dean’s blood was rushing to his ears, buzzing loud enough to almost drown out the rest of the world. He only had eyes for Cas at that moment, and his fingers twitched as he ached to touch the angel.
“Well then, it’s settled!” Sam interjects, putting the remnants of their snack break back in his bag. “Let’s go, we need to make it to the cave before dark.”
Castiel's memory is still a blur. He remembers laying a hand on Dean's arm, but after that it was all just pure light. He snapped back into being on a different existential plane than Earth. He tried, hopelessly, to communicate with Dean, to ask him to come with him to Heaven, but his voice was lost as shrill screams that made the human wince and scream in pain.
While he walked, he looked up to the night sky and relished at how the stars shone so bright. Science told him that they were simply just giant balls of gas being consumed slowly through space but he always liked his mother's version more. His mother had always insisted that the stars were actually angels watching over him, protecting him. When he had learned in the 6th grade that stars could very much burn out, he couldn't help but wonder if the so called Angels could burn out too.
“You were right, Dean. Driving by the coast is very liberating.” Cas turns to look at him now, catching the hunter red-handed staring back at him, making his cheeks flush.
A waitress with strawberry blonde hair came to deliver Balthazar's drink, lowering herself a bit more than necessary into his space and leaving with a wink. The angel before him smirked in her direction before turning his attention back to Castiel. "Are you a mute love?"
When Castiel met Sam Winchester, it was nothing like he expected it to be either. He had glanced into Dean's mind, seen Sam through his eyes, but he was still not prepared for the sweet and kind soul he met that day, the day he had been assigned to stop the raising of Samhain. To him, Sam was the boy with the demon's blood, Lucifer's true vessel. In Heaven, Sam was considered dangerous if left unchecked, but when Castiel shook his hand, he felt no danger. Sam Winchester was a kind man, just like his brother.
Dean stopped solidly in his tracks, rendered speechless for a brief moment. Cas climbed up and held his hand out to help Dean up as well. He had a soft smile that Dean was quickly getting addicted to.
At the mention of volunteers, the room visibly stilled. No one dared move, less it be mistaken as interest. Angels knew their place, they had heard the stories of angels sent to Hell who never returned. None dared to risk it, not for some lowly human they knew little about.
, I’m kinda new ‘round here.” He gestured at the beginning of a sunburn forming on the bridge of his nose from falling asleep on the beach the day before.
Charlie recognized that Dean wanted the subject to be left alone so she did. "Yeah I don't have much else to say but listen Dean, I would love it if you could come by today? I want to see you, it's been too long man."
Dean managed to somewhat stumble through an introduction and sit back down while Charlie further discussed business. Turns out Jimmy was looking for a potential person to use in an ad for a new car he was selling at his car company. He wanted one of the drivers from NASCAR, and to be exact he wanted Dean.
Sam gave his brother a horrified look, his eyes betraying more than he intended them to. “Don't. Move.” he ordered before leaving hurriedly to collect the first aid kit. When he returned, he found Dean in the same spot he had left him, still as a statue.
Jack closed his eyes and waited for Dean to explode. He knew he would, that was what he did every single time Cas did something “stupid”. Yet, the screams didn’t come. He opened his eyes hesitantly and found both hunters staring at him. Sam looked concerned, but a wave of understanding came over him. He knew.
There’s a brightness in Cas’s eyes that intensified at the thought, almost like he knew what his friend was thinking. “No, that’s not-” Dean sighed and shook his head, a small grin on his face.
Castiel looked around the room, adjusting to his new senses, everything still seeming brighter...but he was getting used to it. He looked at his new vessels arms.. his hands went up to feel his face.. a slight stubble growing on his chin. It was surreal how...human he seemed. He was suddenly snapped out of his trance when Gabriel called out to him.
Dean sighed in relief when Cas finally sank into him. The hunter felt full, like a final puzzle piece had finally locked into place. They both sat in companionable silence for a moment, letting it all sink in. Their profound bond vibrant among both of their hearts, pure love coursing through every pore, every breath. Nothing could ever top this moment. This was paradise.
Cas had muttered into the comfortable silence between them. Such a simple, yet meaningful phrase. A small assurance that everything was going to be okay. They were finally on the same page. Dean could feel the soft fibers of Cas’s trench coat against his palms, and he couldn’t help but spread them a bit further. Cas looked at him as if Dean had hung the moon just for him, like he wasn’t the literal angel between the both of them.
It seems to be a trailer for something, but what catches Sam’s eye is the woman. The monster is a ghost of a woman that is terrorizing children, seemingly shocking them to stay still. Interesting. It’s a trailer for a horror movie.
Jack is sitting in the passenger seat, contently looking out the window. “I enjoy watching the palm trees go by. There’s something different about driving here.” His voice is pure awe.
“It looked like you were happy. Were you not happy?” Jack’s eyebrows furrow and his head tilts to the side in confusion. Sometimes he reminds Dean a little too much of Cas.
Their son’s face lit up with a sudden spark of joy. “Are we here?” Cas chuckled and nodded. “Yes, look.” The angel pointed towards the car’s dashboard and the boy followed his line of sight. He gasped and immediately jumped out of the car, giving Dean barely enough time to finish parking. The sky was a beautiful light blue that was littered by small, moving dots of color. Each dot was moving pleasantly in the strong breeze, being pulled along by their attached strings. Jack followed the strings down to the many families looking up at their kites. He smiled wide as he turned back to his own makeshift family walking towards him.
“We can go to a museum,” Sam suggested without taking his eyes off the TV. “These are really good by the way. Thanks” He raised the half-eaten
Their drive started out rather quietly, both just content to be in each other’s presence. The silence between them had always been comfortable. They understood each other wordlessly most of the time, putting into their actions what they had never been able to put in words. Of course, until two weeks ago. When the dam of their love finally had finally broken and let their pent up feelings flow over them both, drowning them in the relief of finally understanding what they meant to each other. But then the Empty had come and separated them.
Jack hesitated by the door. He wanted to say something, anything to help comfort his dad. He was about to apologize when Sam placed a well-meaning hand on his shoulder again. He met the long-haired hunter’s gaze as he shook his head. Jack understood. If there was one thing Dean needed right now, it wasn’t a hollow apology. It wasn’t being alone either, Jack thought,  but that was what Dean wanted. After all, want and need rarely overlap.
“I-, I did” Castiel confirmed, looking at his shoes with an unreadable expression. He didn’t seem to want to elaborate on what had gone wrong and Dean certainly wasn’t going to push him. Dean didn’t know what he should say, so he kept quiet and waited for the angel to give him instructions. Or whatever it was that Castiel usually did.
After stopping for some breakfast, they decided to split up. Sam and Cas would go to interview the victims with their families. Meanwhile, Dean and Jack were at the San Juan Central Police Station, trying to get some more leads on the investigation.
Jack took a deep breath and could almost taste the delicious pizzas from their favorite store in town. There was nothing that quite hit the spot like Ronny’s. “Yeah, I can't wait to get back already. I'm starving!” Jack smiled, as he switched on the turn lights to indicate he was going to make a right onto the familiar road that led them home.
"That's one of the best pies I've ever had. Thank you so much Cas " Dean says after he takes his last bite.
The nurse checks his stats and gives him pain meds as soon as they set in, Dean is falling asleep again.
" no no no, you're not backtracking, you're going there tomorrow even if it means I have to drag you there myself" he said
An hour later Sam was sitting at his brother's bedside, Dean's face was marred with bruised and his face sad swollen his hand was in a soft cast and his fingers were also swollen, it was too quiet for Sam, his brother was never this quiet, the only sound in the room was the heart monitor, the only sign in there that kept sane Dean was alive and although injured and had a long recovery ahead of him he was alive nonetheless.
"well you just confirmed it now and you should have seen the way you lit up like a Christmas tree when he walked in"
"well my  mom died when Sammy and I were young so she kinda took us in when our dad was  working out of state" he said
"so, do you visit everyone you help when on duty?" teasing, he knew very well what this meant and he was grateful he didn't have to go looking for the blue eyed man who lived in his mind rent free.
A few hours later Dean was on his way out of the hospital. He had his bag on his lap as Sam wheeled him to the car.
"no Dean. I think you should get to know Cas. What happened with that scumbag wasn't your fault, you gave that relationship all you had and he threw it to your face. Plus I have a feeling Cas likes you too, so just take it one step at a time and see where it takes you" Sam says
