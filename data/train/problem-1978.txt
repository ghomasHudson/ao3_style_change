SURPRISE THREE GARRIDEBS MOMENT.
“Mnm,” Sherlock responded, language failing him. He knew he wouldn’t last much longer- he took hold of his own cock, stroking himself vigorously, unable to stifle the continuous moans leaving his mouth.
"You can?"
"Brilliant," Sherlock said, before he could stop himself.
“I was wondering about that,” John said suddenly.
There's a lot of dialogue in this chapter and I'm sorry if it seems ooc- but then again no I'm not because fuck Moftiss I can write these characters however I want to! This took so long because I ran into writer's block the size of Texas- I really just wanted to get this finished, so this is what I have. Thanks for reading this story, I hope you've enjoyed it.
John thought about that moment a lot, about how Sherlock was there in the shadows, listening, about how he heard John's shouted arguments echoing off the high ceilings, about how John's silence in the wake of the Woman's last accusation was even more deafening.
For an instant, Sherlock's entire face fell, more shadow than light in the warm, flickering glow of the candle. John might have thought he was seeing things if not for what happened next. Sherlock reached out and touched John's sleeve- more than that, he put his whole hand over John's forearm, stilling John's hand and making sure he had John's attention.
It was a Friday night, and Angelo's was packed. Sherlock must have called ahead, though, because he and John were shown to a table (
“I named it the
John sat up and clicked on the lamp as Sherlock closed the door, dumping his Belstaff and scarf over the nearest stack of chairs.
“Victor, put the gun down, or I swear to God-” John was saying.
“Shower?” John asked quietly. “We should get cleaned up before we fall asleep.”
after my mum and-” a pause, a cough, wet and dry at the same time, “-nd after you.” Victor’s eyes were glassing over- they had stopped searching, having never found what they were looking for.
“Did you get caught?”
, John thinks, less so with malice and more so with unbridled affection.
Sherlock had opened his eyes and was smiling again, a small, private smile meant for John, though Mycroft was no doubt aware of it. John ignored him and smiled back at Sherlock.
"I had known Victor little more than a year at that point. He was by no means at the top of our class, but Hurst offered him a spot in the inner circle nonetheless, which I considered odd, to say the least. He knew the challenges that would face him if he joined, but he was convinced that being in Hurst's class was the thing he needed on his transcripts for university- his father's money was new, his influence not as far-reaching as the fathers of some of our other classmates. He had much more ambition than I did- enough ambition for the both of us- he didn't want to be in the class unless I agreed to be in it as well."
Sherlock took the initiative and put the kettle on, and then sat at the table to watch John cook, eyes darting away whenever John looked at him, clearly waiting for John to make some comment about how hell must have frozen over if Sherlock was actually helping with breakfast for once. John wasn't about to spoil this pleasant domesticity with sarcastic remarks, though, so Sherlock would just have to be happy with John's silent gratitude.
The case had been brought to their attention by none other than Mycroft himself. John had been home at the time, had just come from work, in fact, so there hadn’t been any fuss, no helicopters at countryside crime scenes come to whisk him off to some palace or another. Mycroft was simply
Sherlock sighed- he had been so fond of these shoes.
For his part, John didn't look all that surprised. He must have expected an answer similar to that, Sherlock supposed, what with Mycroft's hints at Hurst's past wrongdoing and the acidic advice to Sherlock about holding on to anger. John was so much more observant that anyone gave him credit for, John included, Sherlock especially. He made a note to tell John just how remarkable he really was, should he ever gather up the courage to make himself (
"-loved you? God, I don't know. Since I killed a man for you. Since you cured my limp. Since 'Afghanistan or Iraq'."
John spent the next few minutes staring intently at the garment bag and resisting the urge to open it. A silly urge to resist, really. This suit was made for him, after all. He wouldn't have to check to see if it would fit- he didn't doubt that Mycroft had sized him up the moment they'd first met. And the party wasn't for several hours yet anyway. There was really no reason to do anything but sit and finish his breakfast.
you to talk about something that's obviously difficult for you to talk about. But if you do want to talk about it, then of course I'll listen. Of
John still hadn't taken his eyes from the paper, though he'd stopped reading it the moment Sherlock had spoken. That detail, however small, was immensely satisfying.
“That was a long time ago, Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice was barely louder than a whisper, and John was officially convinced that there was something else going on. “It has been said that holding onto anger is akin to drinking poison and expecting another person to die.”
“Well, alright then.”
“Please, John. I want to feel you. I
"Observant." Sherlock shrugged, reaching into his pocket, his shoulders- his whole body, really- bouncing with his movement. "I wasn't hungry."
Most of the pieces were already there- almost all of them, in fact, certainly enough to satisfy most people's curiosity. John, of course, had more curiosity than most people- part of it was just the way he was, but there was no denying the fact that the other half of his desire to know came from his relationship with Sherlock. John liked to think he knew Sherlock better than anyone else (barring Mycroft of course), but when it came to things like this, to matters involving Sherlock's past and Sherlock's emotions regarding said past- John was just as hopelessly lost as anyone else would be.
“Victor Trevor has escaped.”
“I love you too, Sherlock.”
“An assassin.” John leaned back against the wall. “You want Sherlock to help stop an
“Sherlock, don’t be rude,” Mycroft hissed.
“Sherlock,” he forced out, blood following the words from his lips, “Sherl-”
Sherlock intended to tell John
“Sorry?” Why?”
Sherlock could sense the moment Mycroft arrived, materialising like a spectre at the top of the stairs. Sherlock immediately stood, sneaking into the bathroom and pushing the door ajar so he could catch a glimpse of Mycroft’s impending interaction with John.
love Sherlock, or if it was all some game to her, the ultimate battle of wills and wits. He often wondered what might have happened, if she were still around, if she were still alive, if she and Sherlock might have- well. It didn't much matter now, he told himself, mostly as a way to tamp down the admittedly ridiculous jealousy he felt over a dead woman. He had to try (however failingly) to convince himself that Sherlock hadn't really felt anything for her either. Sherlock just didn't feel things that way, for anyone. It had been months since that rainy day in the cafe with Mycroft, since John had lied to Sherlock about Irene getting into witness protection. He never had the sense that Sherlock was the least bit upset about it, and he'd certainly never mentioned her.
“I was working a temp job, substituting for regular drivers- ended up on a two day assignment- posh, some business fuck or something, don’t remember the name. Reminded me a little of my dad at first, which I didn’t like. But whatever, we struck up a conversation. He turned out to be nice enough, not your usual six-figure arsehole. I mentioned my money troubles to him in passing, just in passing. Never thought it would lead to anything.”
John pushed his bloodied fingers against Victor’s throat, his already paling wrist.
“Excellent.” Sherlock was up and out of the room at once, presumably to go and get dressed. This left John with a half-finished drink and an ever-growing list of questions.
He was so close- any longer, and he would fall apart completely. But then John pulled back suddenly, and that was far worse. Sherlock reached out blindly, pulling John down on top of him, kissing him desperately, mouth and teeth and tongue. John returned the kiss with equal fervour, breaking away only when breathing became an absolute necessity.
"Yeah. I'm your friend, Sherlock- I'm not going to force you to spill your guts about every bad thing that's ever happened to you." It was John's turn to reach out, to put his hand on Sherlock's arm, the warmth of his palm bleeding right through Sherlock's sleeve and seeping into his skin. It made Sherlock feel shivery, almost, like his hands might start to shake if he let them. John looked at Sherlock the same way he touched Sherlock, with a warmth that reached Sherlock all the way to his core. His hand rested there for one long, glorious second, the warmth remaining even after John moved away.
“I was in deep with a bloke; we’d pulled a couple of jobs together, basic smash and grabs. I owed him some money- nothing too serious, mind, but he’d got it in his head to roll on me if I couldn’t pay him.”
Sherlock laughed a little, wiping at his face with the back of his free hand.
“Move back,” Sherlock ordered, already pushing John away, untangling himself and tipping John flat onto his back. John looked up at him, speechless.
John paused, choosing a careful transition to his next question. "I wasn't going to ask this before, but it seems relevant to the case, and I'd at least like to
“Not intransigent at all, no,” John said under his breath, rolling his eyes and smiling at the way his words made Sherlock pout. “What’s this about?” he asked Mycroft. “I’m assuming it’s not anything really important, or interesting, otherwise you’d have gotten him to say
a genius.”
John's train of thought was suddenly derailed by the smell of food. He blinked back to reality just in time to see a steaming plate of mushroom ravioli being placed in front of him. It occurred to him that Sherlock must have ordered for the both of them while John was off in his own little morose world. Something warm flared in John's chest- the idea of Sherlock ordering for him in restaurants played into every single domestic fantasy John had ever entertained, the simple kinds of daydreams he so rarely allowed himself to have.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, falling back on his seat, leaning heavily against the altar, closing his eyes as sirens rose in the distance. “He has been for a long time.”
"You reckon she used the fat from her boyfriend's hands?"
He paused when seeing one email that stood out.  It was titled simply, ‘Who put Bella in the wych elm?’ Followed with a picture of the graffiti over a local obelisk that was put there to mark where they used to burn witches during 1558 – 1736. He sighed, carding a hand through his thick dark curls. Well, it was only graffiti, but he had a good feeling about this. One he couldn’t quite place yet, though, but at the least he could make up an excuse to bother John. God knows civilian life didn’t exactly suit him. The poor doctor would be dying for an escape soon.
Sherlock’s smile only broadened. “John, you’re turning me soft,” he murmured, still unable to wipe the grin off his face.
Being allowed to be involved Sherlock's life had consumed him. Extraordinary heights and infuriating lows. The life he'd shared with the detective had been consuming, but he'd loved it, craved for it, and he still did. After all these years, John still found it difficult to describe them, their relationship. The meaning of their partnership was something subtle, a rich uniqueness that did not let itself be categorized or even analysed.
“No, that would be a shame, wouldn’t it? And who would want to cut off your arse? I think most of the people you meet want to cut off your head. Shame if that were to happen, though. Those pretty cheekbones would be missing a face to sit on.” The doctor remarked, savouring the feeling of having out-mastered his friend for once. Sherlock was visibly growing flustered, practically squirming in his seat. The way his eyes focused and unfocused at him made John think the detective’s brain must currently feel like those funny abstract paintings. Melty watches and all that.
The boy audible swallowed. Poor kid hadn’t even seen the worst of him. Or of Sherlock. “I-. I went to church.” John remained silent, staring directly in the boy’s face who tried desperately to avoid looking at him. “W-when I came back. I saw you standing at the memorial. I thought you were going to kill me.”
Of course, his planned composure disappeared the moment Sherlock turned up,
“John-,” Sherlock sounded agitated, his face unreadable in the moonless night. “They know something’s going on. They’re not exactly trying to hide from us. The email, the open church door, the graffiti. They want us to
Not in obvious manners or words, but in intrusive, derailed actions that caused the detective to jump off a building to save the people close to him.
. "How do you feel-" About me staying here? About me moving back in? About me helping you catch these deadly, severing witches?
, someone who is not from our community. Therefore, Felicity and Matthew are not married and Matthew is not my son in law." She returned to her tea, before adding, "But of course, you two know yourself that there are other ways of being married to one another. One doesn't need an official document, a ring, or a blessing from one's mother. Sometimes, just being in each other's aura and mind is enough."
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
“Sherlock?” He grabbed the man’s face with both hands, talking softly. “I’m going to check your body right now, I need to see where you’re hurt.”
“Why is that weird? Who was she married to?”
Malina looked up from studying the two cups in her hand. "No, dear. Felicity does not run. No, I believe someone took her, but I have no proof of it. Nor have I seen or heard anything that might lead me to her whereabouts. And believe me, I do pay attention," she looked back at the dried tea leaves on the bottom of the ceramic. "Do you boys see how perfectly aligned these leaves are? Here, compare them to mine." She shoved the two cups towards them, placing her own in the middle.
"Tea?" He tried to suppress his exasperation.
“You ok?” He squinted at Sherlock’s chest, seeing nothing out of the ordinary, only that Sherlock was breathing somewhat superficially. “Witches almost ate you alive,” he muttered. Looking outside his window, he silently grabbed Sherlock’s right hand. He held it for a few moments, before grabbing it with both his hands and placing it in his lap.
“You can stay. I’ll do anything you need to make the place child friendly. Rosie is always welcome.” Seeing the vulnerability in those green-blue eyes, John realised everything had shifted. The squeezing tension was slowly slipping. While they probably didn’t say everything they should’ve, the intangible difference between them was closing as their lives entwined again. John tried to swallow down the whirlwind of emotions he was feeling all at once. Sherlock’s face showed an expression that was brutally raw and real. True, honest emotions that were often concealed behind a facade of indifference. Suddenly, the dynamics had changed, radically. Sherlock wanted them both here, in his flat. This flat, that was often too dusty, too full of the carcasses of his failed experiments. And John did not care. At that moment, he actually considered leaving his clean and somewhat spacious apartment. To leave behind the small garden Rosie could play in. All for
“God I can’t believe you sometimes. You’re trying to make me uncomfortable. I get how you feel when I do experiments on you.”
“Don’t do anything. Just leave him alone,” was Sherlock’s only response, the low timbre sounding dreary and distressed.
The gleam in Sherlock’s eyes returned and John dared to think he looked slightly impressed by his suggestion. “Yes. Definitely. He’s got a clear motive for killing her- oh but it’d draw more attention to unfriend the mother in law. Interesting.” Sherlock stood up, discarding the paper in the bin before tugging on his coat. John did not even have time enough to feel smug about the concealed compliment. If Sherlock got his coat, one just followed suit. Well, John followed suit.
John was not a man of many words, never so eloquent as the crazy, delirious madman in front of him. Instead, John was a man of action. Especially if words failed him. So, he kissed him.
"Oh, so drawn to one another, but so imperfect, undesirable and unwanted. It's perfect."
“Well, it’s not my fault he can’t fill in the blanks."
"Don't you dare come any closer for I will most definitely kill you."
At the crossing, John ignores the red light and has to stop from being run over by the mother fucking limousine.
Who the fuck leaves a severed hand on a desk? Not even the decency to put it in the fridge-
“Are you saying someone should cut off my arse and make a candle out of it?”
Sherlock stood in front of the window, playing his violin with those long, musical fingers. He painted such a dramatic, beautiful picture that it made John sad to know that he was probably the cause of him turning to the safe haven of his music. He recognized the soft melody as his favorite song. The one that left him to feel at ease, comforted. He knew what the detective was doing, he was reassuring him somehow. Of what?
After a small pause he added in a soft whisper, a smile on his face. “And I am so fucking attached to your arse. It would be a real shame.”
His lips parted, he wouldn't last much longer at this rate. He felt Sherlock’s whole body tense and shook before realizing he trickled over John's hand. He had reduced Sherlock to a panting, writhing mess and, just like always, John followed suit. Losing himself so uncontrollably should have been scary, but he knew he was not alone in this physical madness. Coming down from this extraordinary high, he realised he’d never experienced something this intense and forceful before. He pressed a long kiss to Sherlock’s temple, just right above his ear, before withdrawing himself carefully and draping himself on Sherlock’s left side. “Well.”
Best flatmate?
John had stormed downstairs, ignoring Mrs Hudson’s troubled face and voiced concern for them. He’d ran outside, past the wall Sherlock had pushed him against. Had kissed
The smell of coffee filled the air when John descended the stairs and, when he entered the kitchen, he saw that Sherlock had already taken his regular seat at the kitchen table. Like John, he was dressed, sipping coffee while reading London’s news.
“We have remain in our position. We can’t let them notice us until something substantial-.”
“I suppose I did.”
The man ignored Sherlock’s burning anger and addressed the naked woman near the tree, “Shouldn’t we sacrifice something off him too, before we give him to Mother Nature?”
"Do you- um."
And everything fell into place again. He truly didn’t know what the future would look like for the two of them. He didn’t mind either way.
Sherlock let out a sigh of relief. “What a weird day.” He mused, looking up at John. “Before you leave, would you mind undoing the rope?”
Still, no movement nor sound was coming from the couch's direction.
Sherlock was just
Alright.
“What do you want, John? I want you around. It’s just sex- it doesn’t have to be anymore than that.” The detective sat still, avoiding looking at him when he continued in a softer tone of voice, “It doesn’t have to matter.”
Once seated at a small table in the front of the restaurant, John caught himself fiddling with his fingers - noticing how foolish he might look to anyone watching him. He tried not to stare outside, dreading that Sherlock would catch him sitting already in place like the well-trained soldier he once was. This whole evening already felt like a battlefield. John was particularly afraid of stepping on the mines that lay scattered around him and Sherlock, setting off an entire explosion of unshed thoughts and feelings. Though, the worst thing that could happen was that Sherlock would end up with one black eye, maybe two. John laughed at that. No, he was not going to do that. Sherlock would not be able to rile him up. John was going to be composed tonight.
They approached a sound of police sirens and a very pleasantly confused Lestrade. Judging by the looks on their faces and how flustered Sherlock seemed, they must be aware that something most definitely had finally happened. Their smiles were infectious, as Lestrade easily returned it regardless of the state the doctor and detective were in.
Malina stared at Sherlock for a few minutes before returning her attention to John. "He is scared and extremely confused, but happy you're back in his life."
"We'll be the judge of that, kid," John said, smiling tightly.
John sighed. No point in arguing with Sherlock or with himself. He knew he was going to show up at the restaurant anyway. He decided he would end up five minutes later just to spite the cocky bastard.
The primitive part of John's brain wanted to take and ravish Sherlock over the kitchen table. Right.
“Dull, dull, dull.”
Before rationality could sink in, before he could voice his doubts like -
Running as fast as he could, John stopped when a familiar smell penetrated through his nostrils.
John bent forward to place his drink on the floor.
“You have to promise to never leave again. If you come back and go again, I’m not sure I can deal with that.” Sherlock was opening up again. A brief glimpse behind it all. He was swallowing his pride, what little he had left of it.
“Maybe they’re unionising and going on strike.”
And trust Sherlock to make his emotional display explosive. Bleeding in John’s arms, blue eyes ablaze, searching for John’s acknowledgement, Sherlock had opened up and let John in. And John was happy to barge in when giving the opportunity to do so.
Sherlock flinched at his touch, sort of wanting to pull away as if he was caught off guard. Eventually, he unwillingly looked into John’s eyes. "I'm not a mind-reader, John. You're happy clearly, slightly annoyed at me as per usual. You can tell I'm over-complicating everything because it's what I do. And if I wasn't quite so tense you'd want to try and bring up the fact I've done this before." He held his gaze, his eyes tracing over every line in his face.
Sherlock and John find themselves in an unwanted tea leaf reading.
"Well, see, that's where you're utterly, horribly wrong." John hissed, pure outrage tainting his features. He glanced at Sherlock's pleading but frowning and confused face.
"Perfect answer."
Sherlock laughed for the first time that evening, oblivious to the fact that it was massively inappropriate to do in this sort of situation, even though that knowledge never stopped him before. “We just need to find
"You want some tea?"
Out of the blue, Sherlock laughed quietly, “Can I expect to see this side of you every-time we get chased then?”
. Sherlock was so fucking needy. Putting his hands on his shirt while still plundering John’s mouth, Sherlock waited a moment as if to ask for permission. He didn’t need words right now. There was nothing he could say that his body couldn’t convey in a much more intimate way. Sherlock radiated warmth and power, and John never appreciated how perfect he was. As always, he found himself to be like-minded like Sherlock. Both wanted to savour each other forever.
“Don’t. She won’t. She’s safe.” Sherlock’s voice cut him off, sounding determined. “Alright- motive. Great. We are going on a wild goose chase- duck chase.
Irrevocably.
what’s the expression again?”
“If you’re ever struggling you can always stay here. Rosie too, of course. I wouldn’t hate the company.”
“Right. We’re sorry to interrupt you like this ma’am.” He felt himself shift in Captain mode too easily. “It’s fine my boy,” the older woman’s voice sounded way too soft to fit the stereotype. “Call me Malina. D'you lovely lads want some tea? Something stronger perhaps?” She nervously shuffled towards the kitchen, straigtening her white blouse as she went.
"Why would you want to over-complicate what happened just now? Obviously, you enjoyed it. Obviously, I enjoyed it. Forgive me when I'm wrong, but my conclusion here is: I am head over heels and, apparently, most certainly, not straight." He snorted at that. "Took me, let's say, more than four years to work that one out.”
They didn’t say anything for a while after that. Savouring the sweetness while it lasted, not spoiling it with a joke or comment, but just letting it exist. After some time, Sherlock stood up, whirling around in the small space of the kitchen. “You should head to bed. Tomorrow will be a bit hectic.” He left John with that promise of excitement. Sherlock smiled at him ever so slightly that if you were anyone but John you might’ve missed it - before he left the room. Soft footsteps taking the place of conversation.
Sherlock loved him.
Getting back on top of him, John pushed Sherlock's legs a bit upward, granting him the access he desperately needed. "This is probably the wrong time to ask whether you've done this before, isn't it?"
They slipped back into old habits too easily.
John meant it as a joke, but he remembered seeing the blood on the statue. Seeing blood was never promising. Or to Sherlock, it actually was.
Sherlock poked his head into frame, waving a little before he lay back down on the couch with his eyes closed. He seemed to be more distracted than normal which distressed John a bit. The doctor wondered if Sherlock ever thought back at the woman’s words and whether they were lodged inside his head like they were in John’s.
Sherlock tousled his long limbs over the edge of the sofa, grabbing his now crumbled clothes with his hair disheveled, cheeks still rosy- this time from embarrassment more than anything, John surmised when he turned his back to find his retreat into the small bathroom.
"I am honestly not sure, Sherlock."
No, Sherlock
“I just need a bit of time.”
Underneath their pictures, Latin words were scribbled in atrocious bad grammar. Not that John’s Latin was superb, but he’d been forced to study the language to some degree.
Suddenly, three shadows appeared in the living room, gathering together. They had not seen the figures enter the building, so that was quite odd. John wondered whether it was possible they had used a back entrance to the building. The shadows all moved around in the same pattern, some growing larger as they moved away from the source of light. "They're dancing, aren't they?"
John silently wept hot, painful tears, realising he probably lost his best friend, his best man, his partner. For good.
Sherlock remained silent, his eyes unfocussing before closing them completely. “Considering the state you’re currently in and how your partner left this appartement, I ask you. What do you need me to do?” If Sherlock wanted him to, he could harass the ex-army doctor, kidnap him back to Baker Street, or do worse.
- married to Michael Matthew." John's voice sounded steady, calm. "Can you tell us anything about their relationship and your relationship with him?"
“Poor Bella. You reckon she was a shoplifter?” John’s humour was horrendous when drunk. And when he wasn’t drunk.
“Mystery solved.”
Sherlock scoffed, surprisingly not moving away to break the contact between himself and his companion. John still couldn't see his face in the gloom of the shed, which made him feel uncomfortable and unnoticed.
"Mmm, not yet. The best part is yet to come. So. We need to find Felicity. Find a member of the occult. Pull on the thread. We probably need to start looking for Wych Elms." Of course, it wouldn't be that easy. She could be placed absolutely anywhere. In order to find her, they needed to find an inner member. Someone who's willing - or stupid enough - to help them find the location.
“Never imagined we would be investigating occult criminals.” It was actually quite endearing to see Sherlock trying his best to make sense of whatever was on his screen.
“I see, and you have been so desperate to get his attention, mmh?” He was eagerly scrolling through Sherlock’s pictures, files and messages he’d sent to his brother. “I see you still haven’t had dinner with that woman.” He pursed his lips. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to delve into this. He was a noisy teenager. He hadn’t even done this with Mary’s phone.
“I was thinking-“ A sentence that should be avoided around Sherlock, “- maybe we also want to pass by her mother’s place? Yesterday, I noticed that she and Michael were not befriended on Facebook.” It had been quite fascinating and saddening to see how devoted the mother was in finding her missing daughter. Ads, blogs, live sessions, she had done everything in her power to find her daughter Felicity. “Interesting, isn't it? To unfriend your grieving mother-in-law although you both should want to be searching for the same person?”
Wait.
A painful cry escaped his lips as he almost toppled over because of his haste. He was breathing erratically, leaning on his thighs to suppress the pain, the hurt, the fear, the loss. In his derailed, hurt state, John does not even hear a car stopping next to him. Upon looking up, he sees the familiar black limousine with the back window rolled down.
Venturing further into the house, the smell of burned meat and smoke took John by surprise. It almost seemed as if someone was barbecuing in the house. He followed in Sherlock’s footsteps, first ending up in a dimly-lit kitchen that was scattered with an abundant amount of flowers, leaves and what looked like weed. John was not familiar with the science of plant biology or phytology or whatever. To him, they were all just plants. He peered out in the dark hallway, noticing that the door to the living room was thankfully closed. His heart was racing now, hammering in his chest and throat. No sounds were emerging from the adjacent room and John turned around just in time to see that Sherlock had set foot in the direction of a small flight of wooden stairs.
"Poor woman." John did not know whether he was referring to Felicity or to Felicity's mother.
“Fine by me. I reckoned you’d already pestered Lestrade to give you the bloke’s address. When I woke up, I had three missed phone calls and several text messages of him complaining you would not fill him in on the details.” Funny how he’d slept through that all.
Air rests on his skin, warm and heavy, and, for a moment, John is afraid Sherlock is second guessing himself. But they can't go back now. Not after this. They can't go back to normal. Sherlock doesn't say anything, but the look in his eyes is enough. It's a begging, fiery look that draws John closer.
“Open relationships- anyway, the difference between work and pleasure. Just because you’re old fashioned—” Sherlock paused for a moment, his eyes darting over the husband’s features. The clean-shaven man was dressed in a buttoned-up plain flannel shirt, staring back at the camera with a meek, forged smile. “Married young. Oh. He seems relatively conservative. Now that
“I— I’m —”
Silence.
His days at the clinic had been dreadful, boring. A fact that he felt reflected in the renewed tremor in his dominant hand and in the nagging pain in his leg. He had tried to ignore all that too. He even considered moving to a different city, to start anew. Being able to forget everything and anything that has to do with a certain consulting detective.
Sharing a cab was quite eventful again. Not only because John felt the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through his veins at the thought of unravelling a mystery, but also because he was very much aware of Sherlock's proximity and how they both had apparently decided to avoid making eye contact during the entire ride. Forty minutes later, they arrived at a nature park full of caravans. The place smelt of burning campfires of grilled food. Mandalas painted on the back of caravans. Sloppily done, but with gorgeous vibrant colours. Scattered around the sometimes colourful wagons stood small, wooden houses. The benches and grills out front reminded John of summer camp, and how he'd been way more open-minded back then than he was now.
“You blush quite nicely.” John wiggled his legs from side to side.“I have never experimented on you. And don’t play coy with me,
Looking up from his toast again, he saw that Sherlock was watching him more closely. It was then that John was able to see the bags under his eyes. “You, my friend, are definitely a lightweight when it comes to drinking-”
John sighed unevenly, sitting up straighter in his own chair while he regarded his friend. What had the woman meant by that? The only prominent, very salient thing in John's mind had been moving back to 221B Baker Street. How he desperately wanted his old life back. And, maybe, something more than just that. The only problem with that thought was that he did not dare to think or dwell on these desires, let alone express them to the person in front of him. He was just not sure to get any type of 'feeling' across without setting the detective off. Especially not in a sober state.
Snapping out of whatever trance he’d been in, Sherlock jumped up, advancing towards the door.
"Where is he off to then? Mrs. Hudson said he left Baker Street this morn- What did you just say?" John stopped in his track, covering his other ear to make sure he’d understand every word Greg was telling him.
“No,” John said a bit too loud, boldness taking hold over him. “Not just the cases.” He made sure to maintain direct eye-contact with Sherlock’s wide, blazing eyes when he tried to force the words out of his mouth. “I-“ He gestured between himself and the detective. “You know.”
He cared.
“Well. My advice, get some new leaves when you get out of jail.”
“John? Are you alright?”
"How the hell do they - whoever they are - know that we are here tonight?" John hissed, becoming gradually frustrated at being out in the cold, freezing air, hating he left his incredible green curry for this. "What are we looking for?" He inquired again, not caring that he sounded like a small child because his muscles started to constrict painfully.
chihuahuas. John turned around to raise his brow at Sherlock, who turned around to mutter to him, “John Lennon fans presumably.”
"Need me. How?"
“You’re thinking very loudly, it’s hard to concentrate.” A smirk formed on the detective’s lips. “What
Quickly scanning the room, Mycroft recognised the trails of a lost physical fight. The doctor and Sherlock had fought, then, he surmised. Looking at his brother, however, he did not see any bruises forming, nor did he see any signs of blood.
About 15 minutes later, John found himself standing outside 221B Baker Street again, looking at the building that had been so familiar before. It pained him to realise that he had called this apartment
This is the final chapter, we hope you enjoyed it!
“I haven’t had good reason to. Are you really reading my texts? You’re like a jealous wife.” Sherlock joked, swivelling long limbs over the couch to stand up.
. And his noisy brother. John was sure Sherlock didn’t have much personal information on it. Possibly a few secrets about the British government tucked away somewhere. Typing away a few scandals on Sherlock’s phone, he remarked, “It surprises me that your brother hasn’t intervened already, to question you about our renewed partnership.” Somewhere, in the back of John’s mind, he filed away that he’d just acknowledged he was willing to give it a shot again. They really couldn’t part from each other. It was infuriating. He was attached. Maybe the both of them just needed the adrenaline- but it amazed him non the less that they always came full circle.
John could see it still hadn’t clicked in Sherlock’s brain, his gaze revealing a vulnerability that John was not familiar with on the detective’s face. He followed Sherlock’s eyes towards their discarded clothing on the ground, realising the detective felt exposed and wanted to cover up whatever had just transpired.
. A verbal fight then. It was a start.
Having spent the last minutes in the bathroom, John re-entered the living room dressed, terribly debauched, and somewhat angry at the way things had eventually turned out. He worried that their actions had set something off that they were not yet ready for.
“That’d be lovely, thank you. The tea, that is.” John called after her retreating form.
As the car pulled into Baker Street, they walked into the flat, Sherlock’s movements not as smooth as they normally were. He evidently laid himself down on the couch, small red stains printing themselves on the leather.
“Go grab it.” It sounded like an order, but John didn’t fucking care. He was acting on pure instinct, suppressing all rational thoughts. Sherlock literally jumped off the sofa, giving John time to remove the rest of his clothing. He followed Sherlock to the kitchen, smiling fondly at his frantic search. “Top shelf, left is where I left it.”
John stood up from his seat and sat himself down on the coffee table in front of the couch, hoping he would be able to reassure Sherlock. "I know." He paused and let out a small breath. "I'm sorry".
"Selina joined some sort of association or club, whatever. I wanted to impress her, so I got one with her."
. John was no fool, however. True, he was not that quick or clever like the person in front of him, but he did have eyes, thank you very much. He did. He had. For the past years, he’d had eyes too. Sherlock’s reaction screamed avoidance, an obvious telltale that he missed John too. Good.
A shot rang out, echoing through the woods and causing the naked asshole to topple over in the damn, fucking hole.
"No, we need the detective as bait, my dear." John recognised that voice. Where had he heard that voice before?
“Did you just sort of propose to me?”
“Extraordinary.” He frowned at her now, quickly glancing down at Sherlock if he understood what she meant by that. Sherlock, however, was looking at him with a face like ‘take her out, John. Right fucking
Ask him.” He bellows before disappearing underground.
Malina.
. Society cannot prescribe whom we must befriend, trust or even love."
Second, he’d missed the danger terribly.
“I didn’t flee- that’s just how I leave. Same way I left the police station today. I wasn’t offended because I’m not—”. He fell silent again.
“I just didn’t expect it from you.” Sherlock pushed his legs against the arm of the chair, sitting upright to face him and cracking a smile that didn’t last. “No. I suppose I don’t. What do you want? Apart from continuing your mediocre impression of course.”
“Please-”
. He’d said that aloud, hadn’t he? He looked at his drink, blaming the innocent liquor for his blunt openness.
"How?" He gritted through his teeth.
John interpreted Sherlock’s silence as an approval to devour him further. “Good choice.” His voice was shaded with longing and he found that they were both floating through a world without the confinement of overthinking. John wanted to unravel Sherlock. To stop his brilliant brain from working by putting him in a hazy state of bliss. Sherlock looked perfectly obscene. Eyes animalistic and piercing, hair a mess, his pale cheeks and long neck flushed with colour. The detective tilted his head to the side, a further invitation for John to explore.
"We'll be in touch." Sherlock stood up abruptly, leaving the caravan. John followed him after apologising for the detective’s poor manners, feeling grateful Sherlock had gotten them out of that peculiar situation.
Heed the tags: the rating has gone up for this chapter. Quoting my dear friend and co-writer kamala, this chapter contains 'poetic porn'. I hope you enjoy it :)
They passed by their hiding place and jumped over the fence. Well, John tried to jump, but he did not possess Sherlock’s physique. Hands grabbed his then, pulling him over the tall fence. Voices trailed after their retreating forms and John silently cursed their stupidity to have entered such a cursed place.
Creeping forward, he stopped when he heard and saw three women and one man walk around a small bonfire, stripped naked to the day they were born. John couldn't quite make out their faces, but their bodies betrayed that two ladies were remarkably older than the other female, and the male also showed some significant signs of deterioration.
Sherlock mother fucking Holmes was.
Apparently, John had to blow off steam too because he pushed Sherlock back against the wall, kissing him fiercely in return. And then he noticed too that - apparently - kissing Sherlock was fucking arousing, and that Sherlock - apparently - wasn’t so a-sexual John and the entire fucking planet thought he was.
“Who said one of us had to be good?” Sherlock eased back in his chair. Cheap threats weren’t a good look on him. He would leave that to John. If Sherlock wanted to freak the kid out he could tell him everything he knew about him. Picking out every detail he could find to paint a picture of his life within seconds. Instead, his friend gave John the spotlight for a moment, not breaking his stare from the young boy’s face.
with a bad taste in his mouth.
“I do love you, John.”
- he was hauled inside, being aggressively pushed against the door before he was kissed in a manner that should definitely be illegal. Sherlock’s tongue explored and conquered his mouth, sliding obscenely, erotically against his own.
,” He gestured again between himself and Sherlock.
As they pulled up to the police station, a small smirk formed on Sherlock's face. "Obviously, I take it that the police have failed to do anything of importance and have just detained him for the time being. Wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't even done that. So. We can scare him a bit. Just enough to put him on edge." Returning Sherlock’s smirk, John’s authoritative side peaked out, surmising he’d be perfect for this.
"Michael is an underdog," she said, flatly. "Reformed Christian. At least, he was raised to be one. Suppressed by his father and his uncle. I believe he still holds a management position in their family business. When I met Michael, I knew he was a sweet boy, but years and years of being dogmatised changed him. One way to take back control was by controlling and dominating the people that were closest to him. Felicity in particular." Malina tried to make direct eye-contact with Sherlock before she continued, "If you believe that he is behind her disappearance, then you are sadly mistaken. Michael wouldn't hurt a fly." Sighing, she let Timbo jump off her lap. "Felicity is a very open-minded girl who so happens to enjoy life. Her spirit drives her to meet dangerous people. She is very keen on everything spiritual, something that is perpendicular to the Christian belief. I don't know who took her, but I believe she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
That’s it. Sherlock was fucking experimenting on him again because John had complimented him about his nice, fat arse. “I’m the swine, you say?” He whispered. “How dare you.” John felt his head start to throb, meaning that he was definitely ready to go to combat. And to combat he went. Sitting up straight and trying to remain in that position, he practically growled. “I pay you a nice compliment about your fucking arse and all you do is make fun of me. Fooling me.” His left foot shot forward, hitting something next to him on the floor.
He is going to hell or to paradise. John did not really know which ticket he'd bought to get on this mind-blowing ride. Either way, he was going to enjoy it. Straddling Sherlock, he reached down, finding the desired destination with ridiculously much ease. Now, earlier in his practice, he'd found the action always a bit embarrassing. Especially to the patient. John always wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible. Being in this current situation and in his current state of mind, John does not know how he could have been so fucking wrong.
Calm.
"Wait. Hold on." John pulled on the detective's elbow to turn him around before entering the cab. "
Third, Sherlock was fucking
"You wanted to see me?” He hated how he so easily returned the detective's smile. God, he truly had missed this.
The deranged woman approached John from behind, who rearranged himself so that he had all three women under gun-shot.
. He'd already decided where they were going. He just wanted John to confirm him. "You want to stake out tonight at the trailer park?" Or maybe he just wanted to test John's stupidity. Both were high possibilities.
“That’s it.” John yanked his hand away only to get the rest of Sherlock’s clothes off. He sat up, pausing a moment to get his frantic heart under control. Looking at Sherlock, he felt like he was the predator who’d killed his prey before the hunt. “You’re sure?” If they were going to do this, they could never go back again to what they had been before. If it wasn’t already too late for that.
Mycroft told his driver to turn around to Baker Street. When he swung the door open to the dusty, cluttered apartment his brother occupied, said brother poked up his head to stare daggers at him. He’d seen his brother in many states- the most prominent one of them being a drugged unconscious state- but never in the more than 40 years he’d been alive had he seen his brother this devastated.
"Precisely," she said, having seen something flicker across his eyes at that very moment. "You're not a shy, ignorant man-"
"Do explain, dear." Malina voiced, sounding intrigued.
“Good.” John nodded and averted his eyes. “I mean, that’s good.”
that will lead up to Felicity. Though I’m not sure she’ll have made it this long.” The blood on the hands was probably hers. It was put on that statue relatively fresh so she couldn’t have been harmed too long ago. They may have time if they hadn’t killed her.
Drumming his fingers on the table, the detective remained quiet for as long as he could bear before ignoring Johns enquiries completely, “I think I should mention the church adjacent to the memorial just got bought out by some new wave religion- vaguely pagan inspired. Isn’t it funny what people believe?”
“Amazing. Brilliant.” He let out, staring in those aquamarine eyes in front of him, clutching on to Sherlock’s coat.
"I already know why you are here and I will tell you, I can handle anything you need to tell me." She took a sip of her tea and John followed her example.
“Soft?” John chuckled. “Don’t know whether a man wants to hear that,” he winked. Sherlock probably didn’t get it, but that was ok. He got up groaning, cleaning the dust from his knees. “Well, I’m going to take you to bed- I mean.” He smiled, licking and biting his lower lip before continuing, “You,” he pointed at Sherlock, “are going to bed. Sleep. Rest. Whatever.”
“Yes,” John said as he dragged the shrieking woman back to where Sherlock was standing. “Can you walk? We can also leave her here, and I can carry you back.” He was rattling now, because it was nerve racking to see Sherlock again, especially in his hurt, bleeding state. He walked up to him, letting loose of the woman’s arms. Standing in front of him, he touched the detective’s face. John was going to say something reassuring, kind. How he was glad Sherlock was alive. How fucking much he’d missed and hated him at the same time. But John was never very good with words or feelings, let alone at ignoring feelings that resembled anger.
Speaking of cases, John found himself checking his phone too often nowadays. Desperate for any kind of sign something exciting, dangerous,
. Sherlock found them a case. And an interesting one at that. John felt himself smiling.
, John cringed at hearing his own voice sound so broken. "I don't think I can - How did you phrase it? 'Chalk it all up to adrenaline to forget that we just fucked?' "
John began tapping his hand on his thighs. A telltale that revealed his inner turmoil. Reaching for the bottle again, he glanced at Sherlock, who was watching him, no,
"And you, my dear," she smiled sadly at John, "-have to take action before it is too late.
John marvelled at the ease by which Sherlock picked the lock. Within seconds, his slender fingers had unlocked the five pin tumbler lock attached to the door, allowing them inside. He followed Sherlock's slender form with quiet, gentle steps, feeling his side pocket to make sure he could easily grab his gun if needed.
John and Sherlock sort of cheat death again and, this time, Sherlock does act on his feelings.
“John. I
And there it was. Sherlock cared. John knew he cared and that the detective trusted him to read the subtext. He repaid his friend with a soft smile. “Thanks. That means a lot.” Afraid of biased judgments, the deranged man claimed to detach himself from his own feelings, clarifying that it helped him to see, observe and interpret without petty emotions getting in the way. John got that. He understood it. But he didn’t believe that Sherlock did not care, did not feel. It had been clear from the moment he had ripped off John’s semtex vest to the moment he hauled him from the depths of an old water well. That had to mean something. If it didn’t to Sherlock. It definitely did to John. He took in a deep breath, trying to figure out just what to say next. The silence this time wasn’t as suffocating. It just let the moment hang in the air.
They entered the interrogation room and John noticed that the boy they’d captured last night was in fact, a boy. A lanky figure with black, messy hair and a narrow face. For just a second, John wondered whether Sherlock had looked like that when he’d been a teenager. The boy followed their movements with hawk eyes, expecting aggressive tones and meaningless probing. “Alright lad,” John said as he sat down across from the boy, putting his hands flat down on the table. “Here is what we’re going to do to get you out of here. First, no no no- let me finish,” the boy closed his mouth indignantly at John’s imposing tone. “First, you’re going to explain who you are and what you were doing there last night.”
"If we wanted you dead, you'd be dead." The flatness to Sherlock’s voice made it sound more threatening than if he was angry. Moriarty had said something similar to him once, John recalled and he shivered slightly at Sherlock’s words that were uttered in his low, baritone voice. This demeanour was known to John, viscous, practical, cold, resolute. If he hadn’t known the man behind the words, he would be a tiny bit scared. The stranger in front of them, though, had turned pale, gaping at Sherlock with fear in his eyes. "Why would you go to church in the middle of the night?" There was probably a corny have you got something to confess line in there.
"Want to go over the details with me?" John knew he was sort of nagging now.
John was a little taken aback by Sherlock’s sudden reassurance. He knew he cared for Rosie, if John was allowed to use the words ‘care’ and ‘Sherlock’ in the same sentence. “Going on a wild goose chase? Sherlock, with you it's never a foolish search. Wild, often, crazy and undirected, yes. But never a waste of time.” He did not know what had gotten into him tonight. Maybe it was the setting, the familiar smell of the flat, or his flatmate who probably thought John had gone on a bender. “You want to harass the poor guy first? What about the boy trapped Lestrade has detained?” The doctor watched his ex-flatmate ponder on his last words, his face showing an expression John had not seen before and, thus, did not recognise on the detective’s face.
"Not an addict just a user," Sherlock said a little softer than usual as he slipped in the taxi. He quickly said the location of the police station, it was a half an hour ride away. "Do you believe her? Her whole spirituality thing. Seems to have caught you off guard."
"And you feel the same way."
"Well. that was interesting."
Wrapping his coat tightly around him, the doctor stepped in the mild spring breeze, relieved to see that the sun had not set yet and that the nights were getting longer and longer. Making his way over to the tube, he texted Molly while avoiding bumping into London’s busy crowd. John was so indebted to her. Without complaint or hesitation, Molly always agreed to step in and take care of his two year old daughter. If it weren’t for Molly’s extreme thoughtfulness as well as her unrelenting helpfulness, John would be out of his depth, not being able to manage his work and his life. His co-workers already assumed he had moved past the grieving face, falling for his Barts’ pathologist. Little did they know that Molly’s interests lay elsewhere.
? None of his words actually made sense to John. Fat on hands? He knew a lot of body parts that contained more fat than hands. For instance, Sherlock’s arse
Looking up, he swallowed audibly, quite nervous for his blunt presumptuousness. Perhaps Sherlock didn’t really want any of the things they'd just done or John had just said. "I-." He started, but he had absolutely no fucking clue what he was supposed to say - or needed to say right now. "It's OK if you don't want this."
"Fucking hell."
John was not gay.
“I haven’t had the pleasure of his company in a while. Got busy. Something about Brexit and Boris Johnson. Politics are tedious when you could see how easily they are manipulated.”
Eventually, John’s shirt was being pulled off and he felt Sherlock’s hands exploring- no,
. Was it going to be like this when Rosie would be at that age?
Fiercely.
“Light. Now.”
“Yes, there you go. I am going to shoot the handcuffs now. Please, hold your hands out for me.”
Sherlock had already pulled out his phone, photographing everything in a rapid fashion, causing his coat to billow behind him.  “Search the whole room.
"Yes. Definitely. First, we investigate the boy, possibly the husband but I doubt he'll say anything interesting. He seems to want to sever ties to whatever is going on. He mentioned her only once when she went missing on Facebook- he's since been posting. Also, he sounds dull and I don't think he's worth the hassle."
He straightened himself, gathering the rest of his clothes that were scattered all over the fucking living room. "Alright. Let's just-".
“Morning. Thank you for making coffee - and toast?” Smiling, John sat down, noticing the frying pan with burnt eggs on the kitchen counter. At least Sherlock had tried, but John guessed his distracted brain had ruined his attempt to make proper breakfast.
Sherlock reached for his laptop, boney fingers dancing over keys. He scrolled through emails, trying to see if there was anything that caught his eye.
“He didn’t know.”
He heard Malina sigh behind him again, "My dear, we do not care about our lives. We care about making up for the pain we have caused our planet, our nature. We are, as we should say, a wanted, unlucky match."
. “You talked about Bella’s fatty hands. Believe me, there is more fat on your arse than in anyone’s hands.” In the spur of the moment, John did not bother worrying about whether talking about one’s best mate arse didn’t exactly seem like a very strictly heterosexual thing to say to a close friend. Then again, Sherlock might believe him if he’d were to suggest that that was just a norm he never knew about. That the lads at the pub normally went around comparing arses.
It was getting later in the afternoon, the sun descending and basking the forest in a warm, afternoon glow. He tried his phone again, only to realise he had no signal between the large, dense trees. "Shit." He groaned once again, coming to a halt. John had no idea which direction the detective had gone, so his attempts to run into any direction would be meaningless and foolish.
Burned meat.
Well, that thought abruptly disappeared when he heard his phone chime.
John imagined them staggering over to the police station, trying to convince the officer they were detectives. Fumbling for badges. They'd probably look a little insane.
"Touch extreme isn't it?" Sherlock had mentioned it was a symbol of some sort, which could only mean that it must have some significance to both of them. Especially if he was willing to have his skin carved to have it. "What does it represent? Who did it?"
Roaming his hands over Sherlock’s chest, he felt his right hand return with a dense stickiness. “You’ve been stabbed in your left side. It’s not too deep, but we don’t know what else they’ve hit.”
. Him.
John was kissed. Thoroughly. By Sherlock. Who was- Who is-
“Closer to death? My god, I’ll remember you of what you just said when you’re that age.” John turned his face towards Sherlock, noticing once again the other’s proximity. The smell of brandy, cologne and tobacco filled his nostrils. “Have you been smoking again? That way, you’re closer to death too.” He returned his attention back to the screen in front of him. “Isn’t it also odd that only one prostitute went missing this last month?”
John quickly glanced towards his bound friend, whose face turned ashen upon recognising him.
"Say 'hi' to Daddy. Hi Rosie, I am here." Facetiming was not something John preferred to do, especially not with a hyperactive toddler. Sometimes, John had to video-call his patients, who showed him the most unattractive parts of their body that were surely not supposed to be transferred by means of technology, let alone face-to-face. But, as a doctor, he was doomed to endure it all, being a little bit relieved he was watching them online rather than offline. "I am terribly sorry, Molly. I promise you I will be back tomorrow." He was such a horrible father. He knew it. "Want to say 'hi' to Sherlock?" To be honest, John did not know whether he was saying that to Rosie or to Molly.
“Late-life crisis? I mean- you don’t typically get people kidnapping old women. They’re closer to death- not as useful.” The detective peered over John’s shoulder to look at the pulled-up screen. “Anyway- why three? If someone is trying to bring attention to themselves - the graffiti, the email. They seem hell-bent on perfectly replicating the previous crime. It’d be a bit odd to just throw some old women in the mix.”
full steam ahead
John shrugged. “You weren’t supposed to leave.”
“They really rolled out the red carpet for us, yeah?” John joked, laying back down himself. Even with the cots shoved together, the two of them were still separated by about one foot of impassable space. Unacceptable, but John really didn’t think one cot would hold them both. A travesty, really.
“We should, however, still be considering the fact that Sherlock Holmes is an accomplice to Victor Trevor.”
“Mycroft.” John stopped in the doorway, and unconscious decision on his part to stay on the side of the room closer to Sherlock. “Has something happened?”
John begrudgingly lowered his weapon, turning his attention to the tape around Sherlock’s wrists and ankles, grumbling all the while- “gave you a concussion, dragged you through the woods taped your arms and legs, but no, not a threat, it’s all fine-”
“Doctor Watson,” Mycroft greeted, tapping a rhythm on the handle of his umbrella.
“I did,” Sherlock closed his eyes. “Victor had woken up one time to sneak back to the dormitory before morning bed check. He thought it would be humorous to leave me behind.”
Sherlock shrugged, evasive. "There really isn't. We'll have to mingle with dreadfully boring people for several dreadfully boring hours, whilst some dreadfully boring criminal tries to commit murder in the middle of a crowd."
John felt instantly too cold as he moved away from Sherlock, leaning back across the bed to reach for the nightstand drawer. He shivered and winced at the stretching of the muscles in his injured leg, but he ignored it in favour of the arousal he felt when he looked back at Sherlock, who had leaned up on his elbows and was studying John with darkened eyes, hair falling haphazardly across his forehead.
. The best, in fact. I’ve never known anyone better.”
John frowned. “I don’t think that’s funny. Not at all.”
“I really do.” Sherlock kissed the scar again, and John relaxed a little into the touch. “It’s a part of you.” He kissed his way slowly down John’s chest, mapping John’s ribs with his hands.
The waltz came to a crescendo and then slowed; it reminded John of a flame burning out, the final bright flashes before the inevitable fade, until all that was left were glowing embers, pulsing with low, warm light. Sherlock's playing was perfect, as always, able to evoke such imagery in John's mind. The waltz itself, however, seemed to be missing something.
“No.” John stood. “I need a moment. Excuse me.”
“Are you alright?”
Later, John would only recover a scattered few memories from those harrowing moments. He would forget what was said, the gunshot, the fall- but he would recall Sherlock’s voice, his hands, his eyes.
"Right," John nodded, then remembered that Sherlock couldn't see him. "Bye."
“He obviously had help, from the outside.” Sherlock was still looking at Mycroft, but now with an inquisitive tilt to his head. “The question is, who was it that helped him?”
The suit was without doubt the nicest thing John had ever owned. He laid it out on his bed and stared at it for what felt like ages, trying to guess how many months rent it was worth. It was incredibly bespoke, nothing like John would have chosen, though he did like how it looked. Navy blue with a light blue pinstripe, a three button jacket and even a waistcoat, navy blue minus the pinstripe, a tie to match the pinstripe. There were round, gold cufflinks to pin into the sleeves of the crisp, white shirt. The brown Oxford shoes were shined within an inch of their life- he could count his own eyelashes in the reflection.
oops there's more plot
“This year's gala, however, is already proving to be a different sort of affair,” Mycroft continued. “I have it on good authority that there is to be an assassin present at tomorrow night’s
"Yeah. I was spiraling, Sherlock. I was going nowhere- had no direction to go in anyway, even if I could have gotten myself going again at all. And then I met you. If I hadn't, well- I don't like to think about what I might have done."
When they stepped out onto the pavement in front of Baker Street, John immediately rushed to the stoop. It took Sherlock a moment longer to see what John saw- the front door had been forced open.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What-” Victor shook his head. “Sherlock-”
"That's just the story of how we met," Sherlock points out, obviously still confused, though he has moved closer to John again, close enough that John can feel his body heat and count his eyelashes.
, at the very least.”
not going to ask?"
That should be it- the end of it- but John could only help but wonder if anything like this could ever really be over.
Sherlock took one last pull from the cigarette and stepped forward, leaving the still smoking stub on top of the headstone. His fingers lingered on the cold marble and he tapped out a silent rhythm, a goodbye, a last kiss of sorts. Then he turned his back and walked away. It began to rain.
have asked me to.”
"Beautiful," John said as soon as Sherlock lowered his violin. "Beethoven?"
“If I say no?” he asked, well aware that it might not be a feasible option.
“Yes.” Victor nodded. “It was.”
God, it's a good thing this story didn't have a lot of readers, because otherwise that ending would totally seem like I was building up to completely re-write The Reichenbach Fall. In 2021. Ten years after it happened. As if the show deserves it. Oof. Can you imagine?
“I will be in attendance, of course, watching out for anything out of place,” Mycroft explained. “There will be intelligence officers as well, but none of them are so observant as Sherlock, nor myself especially. I will have eyes on the crowd, and Sherlock will be shadowing the target.”
But Sherlock hadn't responded to John's roundabout inquiry- he had wished him a happy new year and turned away to his violin. John had taken it for what it was- a blessing and a curse. Sherlock would never return John's feelings, but he would never punish John for them by cutting John out of his life. Being in love with someone who might not actually be capable of love at all was punishment enough, it turned out. Still, if he couldn't have Sherlock's love, John would rather have Sherlock's friendship than go back to being as alone and as lost as he was before that day at St. Bart's.
HELLO. I swear to God I am going to finish this thing, but another small arc for this story has wormed its way into my brain, so bear with me.
John had never before been so adamant when denying the rather commonplace misconception about his and Sherlock's relationship. But now, away polite society, and believing Sherlock couldn't hear him, John had held nothing back. Sherlock had hardly been able to stand it.
“I swear on God’s name that if John had died,” he whispered, “you wouldn’t have left that room alive.”
John, who had chosen that moment to take another sip of his coffee, nearly choked in surprise- not only at the implication of what Sherlock was saying, but at the look on Sherlock's face when he'd said it.
"Sherlock-" John had finally,
, as Angelo always put it, the one in the corner next to the window, candle and all) the minute they walked through the door. John had given up protesting Angelo's long-standing assumption that John and Sherlock were a couple, an assumption which had dwindled to quiet smiles and knowing looks but was still very apparent. It was almost encouraging at this point, knowing that at least one other person thought there might be something more to the relationship- it certainly wasn't doing anything to dull John's sharp-edged, almost painful hope that someday, by some miracle, the assumption might actually be correct.
,” Mycroft snapped. “We do not know the full extent of the assassin’s intentions. We have no way of knowing how many lives are at stake here, and no way of apprehending the suspect but during the act of attempted murder. One cannot prove murderous intent.”
"Ha ha," John retorted, clearly taking Sherlock's compliment as sarcasm. "Revenge is the most basic motive there is. Anyone could have figured that out."
“Lestrade?” John squinted as the lights flicked on. “What are you doing here?”
How could he ever resist?
! We’ve been given a second chance! Let me make it up to you.”
“How did you escape?”
A gasp and a shiver raked through Sherlock’s body when John tore his mouth away, as if it pained him, only for his lips to leave a burning trail down Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock tilted his head back, laying himself bare for John’s advances, murmuring affirmations and pleas as John deftly slipped open the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt, mouth following his fingertips to Sherlock’s collarbones, his chest.
intent, brother mine. I have no
There was blood crusted on Sherlock’s forehead- it flaked and fell as he blinked awake, looked around. The taste of it was dry on his lips- he squinted in pain at the throbbing bass drum banging away behind his right eye.
“Sherlock?” John asked, lifting his head, catching Sherlock’s stare and pulling it back down from outer space. "Do you want me to stop? If it's too much-"
“I go where you go,” John answered. “Jail included.”
He realised, with a start, why he was so unerringly curious, what it meant that Sherlock had been so affected by loss in the past- it would be definitive proof for what John already wanted to believe- that Sherlock was more than capable of loving someone. It filled John with a strange and terrifying sort of hope, though he had no real reason to be hopeful. Just because Sherlock had feelings once didn't mean he would ever have them for John. And besides, John had already resolved to stay quiet on the subject, to not ask Sherlock out of respect, out of his need for Sherlock to be able to trust him.
, put down the paper, as well as his mug. He crossed his hands on the table in front of him, tilted his head down and looked at Sherlock through his eyelashes. The blue of his eyes was stormy-coloured in the gloomy light that came in through the kitchen window. The same earnestness that was present in John's voice last night was present now, but it was tinged with a kind of firmness that reminded Sherlock of the way John talked when he was taking charge of a situation. It sent something like a shiver shooting up Sherlock's spine.
"You're really not going to ask?"
“You overpowered and abducted me.”
- a file already bursting with well-worn memories of everything from commonplace hellos and goodbyes to raucous laughter to half-hearted complaints and even,
Mycroft and Martin shared a silent moment of contemplation.
“What?” This from both Victor and Sherlock, their heads simultaneously swiveling in his direction.
Sherlock was already up when John came downstairs, which was remarkable in and of itself, since it was still before noon. He could tell Sherlock had slept, at least, and not been up all night- there hadn't been a case to keep him awake, and he had his pajamas on underneath his dressing gown. The dark curls on the one side of his head were flattened, and he stood with a slightly more relaxed slant to his shoulders, swaying gently as his fingers pulled the strains of a sweet if somewhat sorrowful waltz from the strings of his violin. John was relieved, and only then did it occur to him that he had been worried about Sherlock losing sleep over this Hurst business.
Thanks, peeps, for your words of encouragement on chapter one!
"It was a long time ago." He shrugged, though it was ineffective weapon against John's genuine concern, something that annoyed Sherlock to no end whilst simultaneously making his heart jump into his throat. If he didn't know any better, he'd think he was ill. He had thought he was ill, in the beginning, before he had allowed himself to consider the obvious fact that he had fallen in love, clichés and all.
On this night, John falls asleep with Sherlock in his arms, sweat cooling on their skin, moonlight and the city's glow streaming in through the window of Sherlock's bedroom, pooling in the sheets around them and spreading across the floor. John drifts off slowly, exhausted in the best way, an enormous weight lifted from his shoulders and the warmth of Sherlock's body melting him into the mattress. It's bound to be the best sleep of his life, he thinks, his last thought before unconsciousness takes him.
“I’m saying come with me! Let’s disappear, run off together, and no one will know where we’ve gone! You’ll be safe, and we’ll be together, like we used to be. Like it’s
Sherlock took John’s hand, throwing him off balance, inadvertently causing his hips to shift. Sherlock’s breath hitched, and John gasped.
“Well, the last time we did him a favour, I nearly died. I think he owes me.”
) using Irene's re-emergence as a pretext for the real issue. He had braced himself for one of Sherlock's great deduction soliloquies wherein every single thing John had ever said or done to indicate that he had feelings for Sherlock that far transcended the mere platonic bond of flatmates, of friends, would be laid out before John in vivid detail. John had assumed it would all end right then and there: at worst with him leaving Baker street- and Sherlock- behind, or at best with an awkward agreement to forget the feelings ever existed in a desperate scramble to keep their friendship as it was.
“Angelo’s,” John decided, sensing Sherlock’s restlessness in the wake of Mycroft's visit, his need to get some air and clear the cobwebs from his head.
me.” Sherlock looked at him, then, with a look John hadn’t seen since that night while he was bleeding out on the kitchen floor. “No one’s ever defended me. No one. Not even him.”
“I would hate to see any collateral damage incurred as a result of your absence. It would be a shame for any more lives to be lost in the matter.”
“Are you alright?” John was asking, suddenly beside him, free hand prodding at the bloodied side of Sherlock’s head while his other hand kept the gun squarely aimed at Victor’s chest.
. I am merely refusing to help simply because
John kissed him once, softly, smoothing back errant curls from Sherlock’s forehead. “If you want to wait-”
have at present is the intent to do
"Over the course of our partnership, such as it is, I have often observed that your curiosity is piqued to an even higher degree when the question at hand concerns myself or my past. I haven't the faintest idea why, of course, but there it is. Last night, you were practically bursting with the need to find out the truth, but this morning you haven't said a word. Which is why I reiterate- you're
John slicked his fingers, nudging Sherlock’s legs apart as he moved in close to his body. Sherlock felt the callus on John’s left thumb stroking the inside of his thigh, just before the first stretch of John’s finger pushing gently inside of him. He gasped a little but leaned into the touch, letting himself fall backward, bending his knees upward, lifting his hips, anything to let John get the best angle.
“Yeah- yeah.” John looked up at him through heavy-lidded eyes; he gripped Sherlock’s thighs, blunt nails digging into tender skin, the sting of it sweet, spurring Sherlock on.
Ten minutes later, there was tea and coffee and toast and eggs made just the way Sherlock liked them. There was absolute silence in the flat until halfway through tea and coffee and toast and eggs- John was beginning to think that Sherlock had retreated into his mind palace, until-
It was easy enough to steal a police car. Once John had nicked a set of keys from the desk of a soon-to-be-sacked constable, he only spent a minute in the parking garage, clicking the fob and following the beeps and flashing lights.
When the world had righted itself, Sherlock slumped forward, just as John rose to meet him. The tumbled sidelong over the bed, legs tangled, skin sweat-slicked and burning. John found that he couldn’t stop touching Sherlock, running a hand down his arm, his side, roaming back up the plains of his chest. Sherlock was the same, tracing the veins in the crook of John’s elbow, pressing his thumb to the pounding pulse in John’s neck.
“I’m here now, thought, aren’t I?” he said, palms upturned, pleading. “I could have run again, but I came back for you- that has to count for something.”
Sherlock was blushing, from the tops of his cheekbones to the center of his chest, which was rising and falling in quick, shallow breaths. John's eyes followed a soft, thin trail of hair that began below Sherlock's navel, darker and curling as it got lower- until John's eyes landed on Sherlock's cock. It was a little like the rest of him- longer than it was thick, hard and flushed an even darker pink than Sherlock's face.
It was then that Sherlock hit his mark. The tip of John’s cock made contact with Sherlock’s prostate, sending a jolt of electricity up his spine the likes of which he’d never felt. He nearly screamed, letting go of his cock and planting his hands on John’s chest to steady himself as his climax overtook him.
True to his word, Sherlock remained intact, though his cheeks were redder now than John had ever seen them. He kept his fingers laced with John’s while his free hand rested on his own chest, almost shaking. His cock was laid across his stomach, leaking now, rocking with John’s every move.
“Our people are on it,” Martin said, which wasn’t really an answer either. “The two of you will be safe here until we find Trevor.”
Sherlock scoffed. “Don’t be stupid. You’re the most important person I’ve ever met.”
"When did you realise?" he wonders, pulling back just far enough to look John in the eye. "How long have you-"
"I do." Sherlock's eyes didn't leave John's for a second.
“Your brother sent me to collect you and get you to a secure location.” He spun around, a grave look on his face.
"I ran into an old friend from uni one day, said he could help me find a flat mate. Took me to the lab at St. Bart's, our old stomping ground. And there was this bloke, with fantastic hair and incredible cheekbones who opened his mouth right away and told me stuff a stranger couldn't know, invited me to live with him and-"
"You are a naturally curious person, John. It is something we have in common. I, of course, have the intellect and drive to satisfy that curiosity, while you employ the method of following me around while asking incessantly inane questions."
He was unarmed, but Sherlock didn’t doubt that he must have a weapon stashed somewhere nearby.
Sherlock could only nod in response.
"Oh, Sherlock." John reaches out, pushing Sherlock's hair back from his forehead, drawing his thumb across Sherlock's cheek. It's remarkable, really, in the worst possible way, how little Sherlock actually thinks of himself when the whole world (barring John) sees him as some kind of egomaniac.
This was enough to break John out of his trance- he seized Sherlock by the hips, lifting him up just as he pushed him back, leaving him spread on his back across the bed once again. John wasted no time getting out of his own jeans and pants before divesting Sherlock of his remaining clothing. And then they were naked, the both of them, John kneeling between Sherlock’s legs, knocked breathless by the sight before him.
wished he could shoot Victor right now. And Mycroft, too, while he was at it.
Victor simply squinted, tilted his head as if Sherlock had spoken in a different language. “Why would you say no? Don’t you see? This is the perfect solution!”
"Nightstand, second drawer."
On this night, John is woken up by Sherlock once again, just not in a way that he ever has been before.
“Did you honestly think I would leave with you?” He whipped his head up to look at Victor, bringing on a new wave of dizziness. “Didn’t I make myself clear? You’ve been dead to me since we were seventeen, and that’s not going to change.”
Sherlock doesn't answer- he simply presses forward and kisses John, putting his cold hand to the back of John's neck while he breathes his next question into John's mouth.
me. In bed. From the second we got back from the crime scene, until the second Lestrade broke down the door.”
The Essex morning was chilly and grey- it seemed that more rain would be coming along shortly. Sherlock abandoned the car by the entrance to the service road- it was a police vehicle, and so fundamentally conspicuous, but there was nothing for it. He hadn’t had much of a selection to choose from when he’d made his escape from the NSY. he should have taken the extra minute and lifted the keys to Lestrade’s boring sedan. Something to remember next time.
“Two years, give or take,” Victor’s posture was relaxed, but not contrived. His voice was even but not measured. The truth, then, most likely.
By this point, Sherlock’s frown had progressed to a full-blown scowl. It occurred to John that Sherlock’s shortness of temper had less to do with John being a simpleton and more to do with this Hurst fellow.
Sherlock attempted to run the math in his head, but found that this part of his brain to be nothing but a deep, dense fog. He leaned his head back and found that it helped, a little. The grey light was filtering through the clouds, casting vague and jagged shadows of a collapsed ceiling and sharp branches, yet to bloom.
“The Deputy Head of Mission to the American ambassador- a man called Hurst.”
Sherlock was up from his chair immediately, almost leaping over the back of it to get to the window. There was the creaking of the seventeen steps, the distant sound of the front door opening and closing, and then Sherlock pouting again and sticking his tongue out at what John could only assume was the back of Mycroft’s head as Mycroft retreated down the street.
"Hurst is an unrepentantly cruel man, if he can be called a man at all. He is a
such thing.”
The room Mycroft had cornered him in was as nondescript as rooms could be- small, windowless, dim and obviously unused. It might as well have been a prison cell.
.” Sherlock rose and crossed the room in a frenzy, tearing Mycroft’s coat from its hook by the door and pitching it into Mycroft’s lap.
“There is a gala being held at the American embassy tomorrow evening. It is a yearly event during which all of the ambassadors stationed here in London gather for a night of music and banal conversation. Dinner, dancing, an open bar, dozens of people, all of them
"Only if they want to get away with it." Sherlock had barely touched his food, which made John all the more curious as to why Sherlock had even suggested dinner in the first place.
It might have been a side effect of the possible concussion, but Sherlock found himself absolutely dumbfounded by this turn of events.
“Well, that clears that up, then.” Martin looked at Donovan, at Anderson, and she was clearly not impressed. John felt deliciously vindicated.
“How trying that must be for you,” said John. “All that free food and alcohol. Sounds awful.”
The cab ride home was quiet.
Sherlock obliged, lowering his hand, only to cry out when John crooked his fingers, sending white sparks flying at the corners of Sherlock’s vision. He continued to curse under his breath; the discomfort had faded, and all that was left was the promise of what was to come.
“The news of Victor’s escape broke overnight,” Lestrade explained. “But they also somehow know that Sherlock is missing. They’re making a lot of assumptions.”
John had had so many blood tests lately, he would know if he had anything. It wasn’t as if he’d had sex at all in recent months. And there was Sherlock, naked beneath him, begging-
to wear.”
“It’s fine,” John said, truthfully. “More than fine, but you really don’t have to-”
"So, tell me again about this party tomorrow. I'm assuming there's a little bit more to it than 'pin the tail on the assassin'."
"Your leg," he pointed out, eyeing John with concern, even as John settled back between his legs, lube in hand. "Your doctors haven't cleared you-"
“You’re not so bad yourself.” He reached up and pulled his hands through John’s hair, mussing it thoroughly. Ever since the incident, when the back of his head had been shaved for surgery, John had been wearing his hair in a crew cut- sheared close on the sides but a little longer on top. This hairstyle had been the source of endless fantasies for Sherlock in the past few weeks. It must have been close to how John had worn it when he was younger, before Sherlock had known him. A little younger then, leaner, fewer scars. But the same heart. The same hands.
“Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Nora Martin.” Mycroft gestured to the woman, who smiled coldly. “She is the liaison from the American Justice Department.”
One night,
And now he was being forced to save that person's killer. Being forced by none other than Mycroft, who was currently favoured for 'worst brother of the year' award in John's mind, after sending Sherlock into the path of the hurricane known as Irene Adler, and now this. There was a sudden surge of righteous protective anger in John's chest, the same kind he felt last night at Angelo's when Sherlock explained what Hurst had done, when John had seen a very real grief flash in Sherlock's eyes, despite how Sherlock might have been trying to hide it.
.” He said
John was liking her less and less by the second.
“Sherlock, love, I’m sorry-”
“The camera footage in the courthouse was erased.” Martin sighed. “So, we’re starting at a disadvantage.”
Sherlock gave John a look that very plainly said ‘
John leaned over and kissed Sherlock’s temple. “Of course, if they do try anything, I’ll just call Myrcroft.”
When John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock, stroking it in time with the thrust of his fingers, Sherlock let out what he was sure was the most embarrassing sound he’d ever made; It was somewhere between a yelp and a whimper, if such a thing was even possible.  He reflexively clapped a hand over his mouth, stifling the continuous stream of moans that wanted to escape. Every second of John’s prolonged touch was heaven, was torture. He never wanted it to end- but it still wasn’t enough.
And found Sherlock smirking in amusement.
John looked at Victor, then back at Sherlock. “You’re not going to-”
“I was completely enamoured with him at that point,” Sherlock explained. “There was nothing he could do that I wouldn’t find a way to justify, to rationalize. I’d never really had a friend before, let alone someone who was romantically interested in me. I didn’t know it should be any different.” He glanced up, saw John’s sour expression, and shrugged again. “I do now, of course.”
One thing was for sure- John now had confirmation that Sherlock did in fact have the ability to care about someone in some kind of way- or he used to.
“How long was I unconscious?” Sherlock pulled himself further upright, leaning back against a crumbled piece of wall, which he hoped would hold his weight. He was too dizzy to stand, he knew that much, and he had no memory of anything beyond the drive here.
"Thanks," he said belatedly, the waiter having already gone.
"Sherlock?" John called.
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but someone else's voice came out.
It would be another house before he would reach his destination- the thought of the long road ahead had Sherlock’s foot pushing hard on the pedal, mind racing along with the landscape past his windows. He’d never liked driving, never liked the focus required, how it took away from the equal focus required for planning his next move. Driving was merely a skill he’d acquired merely because of the undeniable probability that it would someday prove useful. It was the same as being sociable, or having knowledge of the solar system- others might deem them necessary, but Sherlock could only quantify them by their immediate usefulness.
John began to pick up the pace, moving to deeper thrusts, groaning as Sherlock’s muscles clenched around him. Somewhere else in his brain, in whatever part of it that wasn’t addles but his approaching climax, John could feel himself tiring, the pain in his leg beginning to flare. He gritted his teeth but didn’t slow down, pleasure driving him to the edge of his limits.
There’d been one too many daydreams of meeting John back then, perhaps in a pub; John in fatigues, on furlough with his army friends, carrying on casual conversation with them while eyeing Sherlock from across the darkened room, his intent clear in his eyes. Disappearing to the men’s room, knowing John would follow, crowd him into a stall and force Sherlock to his knees. Or take him against the wall, perhaps, never getting out of uniform.
“Very well. Good day to you both,” Mycroft said, and departed.
It had rained that morning, making the ground soft and slippery and soaked, though the sun was in full view when they covered the casket with the still-damp earth. Sherlock had ruined the knees of his best trousers, caked them with the newly-disturbed dirt that had turned to mud and stayed under his fingernails for days afterward.
“John.”
John wanted to ask.
“Is this really necessary?” Sherlock raised his hands, bound with silver tape. His ankles were as well. “Am I to be your prisoner?”
“And John’s coming too,” Sherlock demanded- he had pulled his knees to his chest, resting his chin rather heavily atop them, a very classic Sherlockian sulking behaviour.
"There you are," John murmured, and Sherlock very nearly gave into his whims.
"You play piano?" Again, not surprising. John would never be shocked at the limitless talent Sherlock seemed to possess. Sherlock could secretly be a one-man orchestra, and John wouldn't bat an eye.
“About earlier,” John said, “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I could never be ashamed of that. But I’m a little protective, if you’ve noticed, and I was upset with myself that I’d done something that might hurt you.”
"I'll go," Sherlock offered, and off he went.
“Crime scene,” Sherlock blurted. “I was at a crime scene.”
John was laughing now, and Sherlock steeled himself, pressed his palms hard to the tabletop and let it wash over him, the sound of it chest-deep and soothing, a great wave breaking across the shore.
“Insatiable,” he teased, and pulled himself away- every cell in his body screamed in protest, reaching back toward Sherlock- but he went anyway, limping a little as he made his way to the loo.
Victor barked out a laugh, swaying in and out of the shadows above him.
"You never said why," Sherlock answers, after a short moment's pause.
"No. I simply don't think he cares one way or the other," Sherlock explained, as always, like it was the simplest thing in the world. There was something else in his voice, though, something that rang with a hint of the anger that he had so blatantly displayed earlier. "Attempting to kill someone in a crowded room with the express intention of remaining anonymous is ambitious indeed, incredibly so. Something like that would have to be perpetrated by someone with a great amount of expertise in this area, someone who would have planned their crime well enough to keep any sort of law enforcement from finding out about the attempt the day before it was set to happen. No, getting caught would neither hurt nor help this killer's cause. They simply want Hurst dead by any means necessary, and they want a lot of people to see it happen."
"That reminds me," John interjected around a mouthful of pasta. "Why are Mycroft and his boys involved in this? Shouldn't it be a matter for embassy security or the American government or something? This party isn't even technically happening on British soil- definitely not within the jurisdiction of the British Secret Service. Or MI6- well, maybe MI6."
Sherlock blinked and John smiled. It was a bright, fierce thing that Sherlock wanted to touch, just to know how soft it felt; a thing he wanted to kiss, just to know how sweet it tasted.
The tears Sherlock was holding back had started to flow. “My apologies, John. I suppose I’m not accustomed to being around people who truly have my best interests at heart.”
He hadn’t changed much. Outwardly, perhaps- his hair had been dark when Sherlock had first known him, the only grey pushing in at his temples. His beard was longer now, more bushy than the close-cropped style he’d had in those days. The skin around his eyes was smooth, too smooth for a man his age- botox then, or some such injectable- so his vanity was the same. So would be his pride, his boorishness, his manipulation. Some things, Sherlock knew, truly were constants.
“I had to work for it, of course, pay my dues- but good things come to those who wait, as they say.”
, or something like it, but between one breath and the next, he’d fallen asleep.
might entail. He moved slowly, cautiously, stepping closer to Sherlock, fighting the urge to reach out and touch him, to smooth the frown lines from his face before they got stuck there.
“Sorry about the accommodations.” Lestrade smiled apologetically. “We’ll take you back to Baker Street tomorrow so you can pack some things, and by then the safe house will be ready. If Sherlock hasn’t already solved it.”
“I need you to know, John,” Sherlock whispered, “that the way I feel about you- and subsequently the way you make me feel about myself- is incomparable. I could search for a thousand years and never find its like.”
"Ask what?" John replied without looking up, steaming mug to his lips and morning paper in his hand. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, equal parts impressed and annoyed at John's ability to get so far under Sherlock's skin with such a simple lack of reaction. How the tables had turned.
John imagined she must have won a lot of arguments with that line, but she’d never met Sherlock before. He wordlessly held out his wrists, as if daring her to try it.
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock said, watching John shake as he pressed both hands to the wound in Victor’s chest, despite the grim prognosis he’d already given.
Truth be told, John didn't know which one was worse- for Sherlock to love her, or for Sherlock to love no one. One thing John
Even in his sleep, John can sense Sherlock watching him, calculating stare glued to John's face, deducing who knows what. That state would normally be unnerving, but he isn't really bothered by it until he feels Sherlock slide away, not out of bed but just to the other side of it, just out of John's reach. It's then that John resurfaces.
If John had known her better, he would have thought that Martin looked a little disappointed. Mycroft and Lestrade both looked relieved. Donovan and Anderson just looked smug.
John smirked, sliding closer, his mouth pressed close to Sherlock’s ear. “And that wasn’t even me at full strength.”
"You're not going to ask me what happened." It wasn't a question, but Sherlock was admittedly a little confused.
“Will you be here when I wake up?” Sherlock asked, sometime later, drifting in and out of sleep with John’s arm draped over him.
"Why did you want to go to Angelo's? You barely touched your food," John asked absentmindedly, when they stopped on the front step so one of them could dig out their keys- neither of them did at first, thinking the other would be the one to do it.
John really,
John hadn’t been sure about Martin at first, but she was growing on him. And she would have kept growing on him if she hadn’t immediately followed up with-
Sherlock had heard the final rattling gasp of death before. He was still unprepared, however, for this one in particular.
“Victor,” Sherlock warned-
were hungry," Sherlock explained, glancing at John sideways, as if John were the sun and it would hurt to look directly at him. "And I didn't want you to have to eat alone."
Sherlock became aware that he had been staring into space when John started to rock back and forth, shifting in and out of Sherlock's field of vision in an effort to get his attention.
Back in the car, the mood was barely any lighter than it had been on the way over. Sherlock was back to staring out the window, but John got the sense that he was present, willing to answer John’s questions.
“Only if what you have to say includes the answers to my questions.”
I will. You don't need to wait for me to ask."
Victor smiled an empty smile. “James Moriarty sends his regards.”
“You two need to get dressed and come with me,” he said, pacing around, securing the room.
Mycroft sighed as well, a much more burdened sigh than Sherlock’s. “I’ll see that it’s taken care of.”
to do anything other than decline your request for my assistance. I have no
"After you kissed me and I asked you why, you said it was because you'd-"
When John looked over at Sherlock, he saw that Sherlock’s face was red, his eyes glistening. He was still holding John’s hand- clinging to it, in fact.
And now, onto the good stuff.
“No,” Sherlock realised. “Not-”
“Fine,” Sherlock sighed, “I’ll go. But I haven’t got a
“You’ve been in and out of it,” Victor answered. “A couple of hours.”
For a brief moment, it seemed like he should say something. He hadn't said anything back then, words refusing to come, knowing that the person he would be talking to would never hear his voice again. He remained silent, then and now- he'd already said everything there was to say.
Mycroft pointedly ignored him- for the sake of decorum, most likely. Lestrade, standing in the far corner of the room, frowned in Mycroft’s direction, and at the woman standing next to him. He was flanked by Donovan and Anderson, who looked strangely happy that all of this was happening.
"Do you
Of course, John has been woken by nightmares. He doesn't count those as being Sherlock's doing- in fact, the nightmares have become few and far between and faded almost completely since he moved into Baker Street. He believes he has Sherlock Holmes to thank for that.
, a week or so after the bomb vest and the darkened swimming pool, after yet another case with a different villain but a similar life-threatening climax, John decides that enough is enough. On this night, when he and Sherlock come home (mostly) unscathed, John barely hesitates before taking Sherlock by the shoulders and kissing him thoroughly, right there in the front hallway, consequences be damned. He hadn't planned far enough ahead to hope that Sherlock might kiss him back, but had he been hoping, he would not have been disappointed.
Then, what felt like only a few moments later, he was awoken by a bright square of light falling over his face- he looked up to see a silhouette in the doorway, in the unmistakable shape of one Sherlock Holmes.
The thing that bothered John the most was the one thing he didn't know- who was the person Hurst killed, all those years ago, and what was their relationship with Sherlock? True, John hadn't known Sherlock for a long time, not long at all in relation to the thirty-something years of Sherlock's life before John had come into it, but he couldn't imagine that Sherlock had ever been the type to make friends easily. Maybe he had been different, before. Maybe something had happened. Maybe this, losing someone in such a way, had been the thing that changed him.
Still, it felt like something was coming. John was enough of a storyteller to know when things were about to change. He could only hope that they would change for the better.
John forgot about the pain in his leg as he stumbled into the hall, gun ready, wearing only his pants. Sherlock came out behind him, wrapped in a bedsheet, rubbing at his eyes, mumbling curses.
"You have it memorised." Unsurprisingly- Sherlock had many pieces of music filed away in his mind palace. John imagined that music must be one of the easier things to remember.
"I found the whole experience tedious, of course. I never got on well with my fellow students, nor did I have any desire to do so. Halfway through my fourth year, a new student arrived. I always noticed when there were new students, but I could never be bothered to learn anything about them. But Victor-" Sherlock paused for a moment- his fingertips had been tapping on the tabletop as if it were a piano. "Victor was the first thing about that place that wasn't excruciatingly, mind-numbingly
“Yeah, well, objectively, you have no evidence that Sherlock has done anything wrong,” John fired back. “This- taking off after a hunch without telling anyone where he’s gone- this is normal for him. It’s not an indicator of criminal activity.”
“Well,” he looked back to Mycroft, “you’re not usually the type to just come ‘round for tea and a chat, and since nothing’s happened, apparently, that means you want something from him.” He pointed to Sherlock, who smirked but remained quiet.
John winced at the antiseptic swab on his skin. The paramedic, James, he had said his name was, smiled apologetically, fingers prodding and pulling John’s skin before pressing butterfly plasters to his forehead to hold the wound closed. The whole left side of John’s face was throbbing- he could feel his eye going black and blue already, and he knew he’d have a proper shiner in the morning.
“What time is it?” John asked, watching as Sherlock slid his cot loudly across the floor so that it sat side-by-side with John’s.
"Sherlock," he whispers, not opening his eyes, already knowing the answer to the question he's about to ask. "You up?"
John falls asleep smiling. Sherlock does too.
“Oh, I think he knew right away. About the accident, the forged cheques, all of it. All the more reason to follow the rules. Like I said, it wasn’t a bad deal. Once I killed Hurst, he was going to get me out of the country, and then I would be free for good. All I had to do was play along. Just a means to an end.”
. Dreadfully tedious, I can assure you. However, as someone who is in constant dealings with her Majesty’s international interests, I have been forced to attend this event for several years.”
“King David’s was an estate house, before it was expanded into a school. There was a cemetery on the grounds and a chapel, long abandoned. The only part of the floor left intact was the solid stone slab where the altar had been. Victor and I would sneak out some nights, to smoke. One spring, we fell asleep there.”
“So you lured me here to what? Warn me? It’s a little late for that.”
John had expected Sherlock to become more tense and less talkative the closer they came to having to leave. But once he had told John the whole story, elaborating on some of the details seemed to become easier for him. Not wanting to badger him, John tried to keep his questions to a minimum. He was really just glad to see Sherlock eating so readily, and for the second time in one day.
. Wanted to know if I was interested in doing business with his employer.”
Lestrade led John through the office, past the empty cubicles, dimmed and shadowed. Down past what looked to be a break room, into a private office with grey walls and no nameplate on the door. No windows, either. Half of the room was piled high with unused furniture, computer chairs and desks all stacked, collecting dust. On the other side of the room were two cots, pushed to opposite walls. Between them was a small table, a lamp, and access to an electrical outlet.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Sherlock appeared to be responding to Martin’s comment, but he was clearly addressing Mycroft. “He’s gone- he won’t come back for me, now that I’ve made it apparent how little I care for him. He avoided detection this long, it won't be difficult for him to do it again, especially if he has help. He’ll disappear completely. I’m not waiting around in an office for two weeks until you come to the same conclusion.”
“I don’t see why not,” Martin said.
"-fallen in love with you, yeah." Even in the dark, John can see Sherlock blushing despite his pensive expression. John can't help but smile just a little.
John often wondered if Irene Adler ever really
"And since he was your friend, you didn't want him to miss the opportunity," John finished.
"Of course I trust you, John. I should think that was obvious." He moved his hand from John's arm almost as soon as he put it there, but he held onto John's eyes, leaving John speechless and transfixed, lost to the world around them, deaf to the ambiance of quiet conversations and clinking silverware.
"Sherlock," John says again. "Is something wrong?"
“You should go lie down,” Sherlock was saying. “I’ll find you when I’m done here.”
“I forgive you.” John kissed Sherlock’s palm. “Christ, of course I forgive you. I’m on your side, Sherlock, always. I’ll threaten as many Donovans and Andersons as I have to.”
Sherlock’s shoulders dropped, and he felt the cold stab of guilt deep in his chest.
Victor looked stricken.
The gunshot was an explosion in a contained space, concussive and loud and muffled at the same time, sound bounced around and absorbed by the walls of Baker Street. Then there was the blood, the familiar warmth of it soaking into the leg of John's trousers. Then there was the pain, also familiar, and John was honestly just amazed that he made it through this many cases with Sherlock before he wound up shot.
“Um,” John began, for lack of a better segue. “You alright?”
When John had seen Sherlock in the suit for the first time, earlier at Baker Street, he had nearly been floored. There had been a moment of near insurmountable temptation, the kind one gets in a museum when standing before a great masterpiece. He wanted so much to run his fingers across Sherlock’s shoulder, down the line of his waist, like putting his fingers in the grooves of brushstrokes that had been placed so carefully, just so, the texture visible to the eye but so much more pleasing to the touch.
“Had help. Would have thought that was obvious.”
. It’s never enough.”
you trust me enough to tell me the truth."
.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Now, if you’re finished being dumbstruck at my apparently shocking admission of hunger- would you like to go to Angelo’s, or shall we order take-away?”
“John?”
The last time Sherlock had been here was the night before the last day of classes, the dawn of that fateful summer. The chapel wasn't that much different really. Twenty-odd years hadn't added much to its level of decrepitness. And yet, everything was different.
Before John could say anything, Sherlock swung a leg over John’s hips, sinking down onto his cock in one fluid motion. He moaned loudly at the feeling of John inside of him again, at this new angle, his own weight seating John’s cock further inside of him. He barely hesitated before beginning to rock his hips, careful not to jostle John’s injured leg anymore than was necessary.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, and Sherlock felt the heat of his own name soaking into his skin, just over his heart. The reverence with which John said it, the quiet in its wake- it was enough to make Sherlock’s knees go weak. He slid his hands up John’s arms, his shoulders, cradling John’s head in his hands and touching the scar- just a ridge now, under close-cropped hair, but Sherlock could feel the phantom warmth of blood, the cold kitchen floor under his knees.
It was several seconds before either of them moved or spoke, caught up in the unreality of the moment, the stillness and the darkness surrounding them.
"A little," Sherlock admitted. It was the kind of thing that would normally have been accompanied by a shrug, but the air didn't seem light enough for it just then, like it was weighing down on Sherlock's shoulders with whatever Sherlock wasn't saying.
The door swung open, and Sherlock disappeared into the darkness of the front hall. John followed, his smile lighting the way.
“Well, then,” he said a moment later, lips barely brushing John’s as he spoke, “you’d better get on with it, Doctor Watson.”
Sherlock was visibly conflicted. He had clearly underestimated Martin’s grasp of the situation. And then Sherlock looked to him.
“Sh-fuck,” John slurred, head fallen back, eyes closed and face flushed, ecstasy plain on his face. Sherlock bit his lip, tasting the sweat as it rolled down his face.
“When’s the last time you ate?” John asked, not really expecting an answer.
“Really, Lestrade,” he admonished. “How many times have I told you to stop letting Anderson speak in public?”
“What’s going on?” Sherlock demanded, no longer half-asleep.
, he supposed, giving into the collapse of his leg and falling back, the back of his head connecting suddenly with the nearest solid object -
"Piano?" John guessed. Sherlock nodded.
John had meant for this to lighten the air around them, to lift the conversation from its current depths- but he was pretty sure he'd failed, though not entirely, since Sherlock did smile for the briefest of moments.
"I can." John nods. "What happened was that you saved my life."
been one aborted attempt at a conversation on John's part, but Sherlock had ignored it, sure that it would only end in Sherlock's confession of his feelings, feelings which would ultimately lead to John's departure from Baker Street and the partial or (more likely) complete dissolution of their friendship. Sherlock had decided then and there that living without John's love would be tolerable, if only barely, but living without John's friendship- that would certainly prove fatal, one way or another.
John was so transfixed by Sherlock’s mouth and the words coming out of it that he didn’t even notice Sherlock pulling his belt free of its loops- not until he heard it hit the floor with a clunk.
“Who helped you?”
Victor collapsed a second later, blood bursting beneath the fabric of his shirt- such a small stain for such catastrophic damage. Sherlock was momentarily tempted to look up and behind, to try and spot the sniper, but he knew they would be gone soon, if they weren’t already.
Sherlock emerged from his room a little less than an hour later, dressed in pajamas and a dressing gown. No one would look at him and think he was going to a state gala in a few hours. John thought of the suit he had yet to see, the colours and the lines and what they would look like on Sherlock’s body. There was no doubt that he would look stunning. Even now, in the slouchiest of his clothes, a t-shirt with holes in the collar, Sherlock looked like a Renaissance painting, or perhaps Michaelangelo’s David, his marble skin pale and nearly translucent in the grey-wash light of the rainy afternoon outside.
John rolled his eyes, but he was holding back a smile. And there was that hope again, stubborn and fluttering in Sherlock's chest- hope that John might forgive him for this, that this might not be their end.
.” Sherlock sat up and spun to face Mycroft, his hands digging into the sofa cushions until his knuckles turned white. “I will do
’. John smiled and gave that look right back.
“Not from where I’m standing.”
“He’s not wrong, though, is he?” Donovan said.
“Every day for as long as you want me,” John answered, breath warm and real on the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
Lestrade and Mycroft were both silent, standing awkwardly, shifting from foot to foot.
“Allow me to prove
"Yeah, right," he muttered, turning toward the kitchen. "I bet you play a little piano the same way I practise a little medicine." He snuck a glance at Sherlock just in time to see the small, close-lipped smile on Sherlock's face. It was so unbearably soft that John had to look away. "You want eggs? I'm making eggs."
“Mister Holmes.” Martin extended her hand, but Sherlock ignored it in favour of glaring with hellish intensity at Mycroft.
“I wasn’t going to say no- you don’t say no to a man who can arrange for an accident like that. And it wasn’t anything serious- small favours, he called it. Deliveries, mostly, driving jobs, which I was already doing anyhow. And I’d been promised the thing I always wanted.”
“I will
John took hold of Sherlock’s thigh, lifting it a little, canting his hips and fucking Sherlock at a different angle. Sherlock cried out, and the hand on his chest twitched again.
“You were ready for me,” John remarked, adding a second finger alongside the first.
“John?” Sherlock listed his head. “Is this alright?”
John is no stranger to being woken up at odd hours by his enigmatic flat mate. He has been barged in upon during sleep no less than four times with declarations of the game being afoot, of cases that simply must be solved and twenty-four hour Chinese places with sesame chicken that simply must be eaten after said cases have been solved. On those nights, John has returned to bed in the early hours of the morning, barely being able to shut his eyes and calm his adrenaline-spiked heartbeat before his alarm goes off.
“I’m clean,” he said. “I haven’t been with anyone since before I met you. And after- after I met you, I never wanted anyone else.”
John was right, yet again- if the shaking gasps of Victor’s breaths were anything to go by, it didn’t seem like he had very much time left at all.
"Must be something important." Mrs. Hudson tapped the logo on John's garment bag. "This is from the best tailor in town." And with that, she scuttled back downstairs.
They’d made it inside, but barely got up to the landing before Sherlock was grabbing John and kissing him soundly, thoroughly, desperately. John stiffened in surprise, but quickly gave himself over, backing Sherlock against the nearest wall. Sherlock hummed into the kiss as John stroked his face, letting his cane clatter to the floor.
"I'm so sorry, Sherlock," John said, voice soft yet strong in a way that only John's voice could be. John spoke like this so rarely that Sherlock was a little taken aback by it. He closed his eyes, scrambling to capture the intonation and inflection, to fold it carefully and put it away in his mind palace in the file labeled
Sometimes it's the violin that pulls John from his rest, when Sherlock himself should be sleeping, when his playing becomes slightly less than perfect and he gets frustrated, drawing the bow violently against the strings, just long enough to wake John. Sherlock always seems to realize his mistake, however belatedly, silencing the violin's caterwauling almost as abruptly as he starts it, transitioning immediately into some soft lullaby or another, undoing the damage and sending John back to sleep within minutes.
, jokes made at the expense of the more moronic Yard members. John ordered dessert for himself and more wine for the both of them. Time stopped stretching and was pulled back in on itself, and they were suddenly to the bottom of their second wine bottle and mostly out of stories to tell.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, “only- I don’t think I can walk at the moment.”
“This morning, seventeen minutes after eight. Mrs. Hudson made muffins.”
“You weren’t supposed to follow me,” he said, despite all evidence to the contrary.
“We were hoping you could tell us.” This from Martin, standing in the doorway.
The car ride to the embassy was a quiet one. The more open, talkative Sherlock had retreated back into his silent shell, a distant and somewhat morose look on his face as he stared out the window at the cold, rainy street. The only sign of life was his foot, bouncing incessantly with a restless sort of dread that didn’t match the rest of his outward demeanour.
Mycroft was waiting for them when they arrived at Scotland Yard. He had sequestered himself in a large conference room on the uppermost floor of the building. He looked unruffled and nonplussed- dressed immaculately, not a hair out of place. None of this was unusual for him, of course, even at this ungodly hour. John had essentially come to the conclusion that Mycroft was actually a robot, engineered by the Holmeses as an immortal nanny for Sherlock.
Sherlock glared a little harder, as if it would let him see deeper into Victor’s mind. All it did was make his head hurt.
"Still," John protested, however gently, his eyes finally leaving Sherlock's face. "To have someone you cared about taken away from you like that, and to never have closure- it must have hurt. And that kind of pain doesn't just go away on its own."
There's a little more plot. I will try not to make you wait four more months.
“So you would
