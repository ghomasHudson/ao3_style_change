John leveled a stare at Sherlock. “You realize I didn’t need to be in uniform until we met the lift out of the base later.”
“As standard as standard can be here,” Nutsack finished.
“Aw, now. Cops never arrested me for that.”
“Yes! I know!” Nick settled back into his chair. “Towerblock, why don’t you take our new friends and show them their bunk.”
“Boss,” he gave a nod and headed out into the base.
John let out a nervous laugh. “Yeah?”
“John.” He cupped John’s face between his palms, eyeing him intently. “You. Cannot.”
His arms moved to cross over his chest. “Captain Medhurst, do you care to explain why you are bleeding?”
Towerblock flicked Simon across the forehead. “Not clever pissing off the one person that’ll keep you from bleeding out if you get shot. What’s your problem anyway? Loo is a right yoyo, and I don’t see you taking chunks outta him.”
“John.”
“Go on, answer it.”
Mycroft hummed. “Very well. I suspect Sherlock is nearer to solving this issue than you think.”
Nick dropped onto the nearest chair. “Please.”
“Gee?”
“Ah.”
“Sherlock,” John chided.
“FUCK OFF!”
“Hardly safe from accidental disclosure of classified information.” Sherlock continued to pace the narrow confines of the room.
“Ah.”
“I don’t joke.”
“I need you to… I don’t know,” John rubbed at the back of his neck. “Just…”
“The family resemblance is noted,” Sherlock said smoothly, extending a hand. “Except for the-“
Sherlock shuddered at the description. “Your good friend and WISWO feels the IED you delivered is an aberration of some sort.”
Mac whispered carefully in Rocket’s ear as he adjusted his rifle. Towerblock and John fired simultaneously, and it was exactly what Rocket had been waiting for: a glint. The tip of a scope or the barrel of the gun. Peeking out from the netting that had been hiding it. Mac hissed out a warning. Rocket shifted. “Aye, thir’s th’ bas.” And he pulled the trigger.
Sherlock managed to look slightly offended. “And why not?”
“He has managed to resolve the situation, in a manner.”
“Drinks on you tonight.”
The loud crack of high-powered rifle shot echoed across the yard.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched. “As much as it pains me to admit this, I haven’t hated seeing you again.”
John let out a long breath. “No one smashed it to pieces, so that’s good.”
“No. Frost. Here in Frost.”
John looked down at his shoes. “Burg-“
“Look what you’ve started,” John muttered.
“Not there, John,” Sherlock pouted. Dr. Watson blushed again.
Gee shrugged with her good shoulder.
“The British have been fighting here for over a hundred and seventy-five years. What exactly makes you think this is actually going to be stood down?”
“Shut up, Bird!”
“Aye.”
And if these boys don't start talking to each other, Martha Hudson will not be held responsible for her actions.
“Jiw jiw! I’m fucking Welsh!” Rhys snapped, breaking his near hour-long silence. “I’m piss tired of this shite, you gomping limbo.”
“Car,” Gee’s hand dropped to her sidearm.
Towerblock came in from the equipment room at the back and looked at the toilet with confusion. “What’s that for?”
“Me neither.” He clapped a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Try not to be dead for our reunion next time?”
John raised his brows but glanced at his empty mug. “I was due a refill.” He could feel Sherlock’s eyes track his progress to the coffee. But even the distance wasn’t enough to hide the rumble of Sherlock’s voice. Maybe it was how well attuned John was to the sound or maybe Sherlock had pitched his voice just so John could hear. Either way, it wasn’t a private conversation.
“I’m breathing perfectly fine. You’re the one who can’t.”
Mycroft blinked a few times, waiting for Dr. Watson to reach his seat on the sofa. No need to alarm the man further, or risk scalds while he balanced the two mugs. “You’ve already heard my input on the matter. I know how you despise repetition.”
“Every brand, really,” Nutsack answered. “And nine volt is the battery of choice.”
“Oh my God, look at the colors!”
He lost track of time and maybe, a little bit lost where he was, and when he finally made it back to the illusion of suburban perfection, it was late enough to be indecent. He tossed his jacket onto one of the horrible chairs, and dropped onto the hideous couch, and used one of the cheery throws as a blanket, settled in for something that was not even a close approximation to sleep.
“Get him on a board!” John snapped, then set a hand under Gee’s chin and lowered his voice. “Chin up, close your eyes.”
“Do you think I’m under any illusion that anyone thinks anything else?!”
“He’s got to see reason. He’s making everyone uncomfortable.”
“Listen here, Paddy-“
“Tell me he didn’t drive here?” Towerblock begged.
“Ah, and did the Detective Inspector make better use of the time than you were able?”
“I’m aware.”
“Bird, please.”
Simon stormed into his bunk, shucking his ruck roughly into a corner of the room. “Bitch,” he hissed under his breath.
“Oh.”
Sherlock twisted as Medhurst crossed the yard. “Captain Medhurst.”
Sherlock blinked at him.
“Didn’t say we had to get rid of the jacks, did he?”
“Oh God,” John huffed out a laugh. “Well… I would like to say he doesn’t deserve whatever this is…”
“Don’t.”
“Have you considered that one of Her Majesty’s Majors have rather high clearance as well?”
“No need, Gee. I’m fine.” Nick sounded breathless. “The Major is on top of it.”
John snorted, dropping his voice so only Sherlock would hear. “You having fun with your old ones?”
Bird crossed her legs at the ankles, letting her boots thunk down on the table. “Mac and Rocket are probably off lighting things on fire or drinking bleach or jumping off of high walls.”
“So… Gee is short for Mag Aoidh?”
Nick heaved a large sigh. “And it’s something that I personally have to see, is it?”
Screwhole dropped back into his folding chair and unpaused the game, resuming the play-action without a batting an eye.
“Yeah?”
John snorted. “Yeah. Can’t be cross about that.”
Sherlock stopped just behind John’s shoulder. “Bill Murray’s nephew then? You kept that quiet.”
“Doesn’t matter now, does it?” Simon asked bitterly. “She’ll get a medal for punching me in the face.”
All over Sherlock’s face. Blood. Streaked from his nose, his lip, a lac over his left brow. Blood. Ran down the side of his face. It looked like… looked… just like… No. John shook himself. Black eye. Lac on forehead. Slices in his shirt. Blood. His right knee was bleeding, his trousers torn. And the way he was standing, shifting, there was more. More blood. More injury. More that John couldn’t see and couldn’t put his hands on and couldn’t stop.
“They’ll kick me out. Sherlock, I’ll lose everything. Please. I’m two months from graduating.”
He started as Donovan appeared in the doorframe. “Jesus, are you trying to kill me?”
“Yes, why? Have experience with them, do you?”
“No, wait! Bird! Come back!” He only made it a few steps outside before colliding with Mary. “Christ!”
“It won’t happen again, Sir.”
“Right, well, no one actually likes Simon. So he doesn’t count.”
John flush pink, but tightened the hold he had on his own arms and closed his eyes. “No debate. Sleep now.”
“So… Work here done then?”
“Yeah. Them them.”
“Sarcasm doesn’t suit you, John.”
“No idea.” Nick broke off from his route to the DFAC in order to cut off the Colonel, but waved Gee on towards Sherlock. “Go get his aggravatingly necessary input.” He made it to the middle of the yard before the Colonel could reach the DFAC. “Sir?”
“You sleep when and
Gee lost her balance. The backwards stumble, the turn, the ache in her leg, all together it caused her knee to buckle and she only just managed to catch herself on her outstretched palms. The impact shot up through her arm and shoulder and she fell flat with a yelp.
It was a snapping sound, high and metallic, and Sherlock’s head whipped around as the members of Bluestone dove to the ground. But that was all he saw before he found himself nose-to-tire with the front wheel of the mastiff. “Christ, Sherlock,” John hissed, his hand planted firmly at the base of Sherlock’s skull. Another crack and ping as a shot ricocheted off the fender. “We bloody well just talked about this.” And John moved.
“Holmes!”
“Gee!”
“I studied with the EOD.”
He shook his head. “Initiative and a get-away car in the middle of a duck pond? Please. I’m too old for this.”
Bird laughed. “You’re funny,” she gave him a fake smile. “And I’m not interested.” Then she side stepped him and strode away.
Gee waved a hand in irritation. “Stop. Just…” She braced her palms on the table, taking some weight off of her leg. “Stop, yeah?”
John's pacing had stopped. It was eerily quiet upstairs and Martha fretted in her dressing gown, going into her kitchen and digging around in the biscuit tin for her cigarettes. She lit one, hand trembling and took a deep drag of the smoke. It was a comforting ritual, one she and Sherlock had often shared and John pretended not to notice. Maybe it could calm her nerves as her imagination spun any number of desperate scenarios.
“Problem?” John asked quietly.
She groaned and dropped her arm from her eyes. “Can’t I just bugger off and shower?”
“SHERLOCK!”
They glared at each other.
“Is that a loo in the middle of the Det?”
“Boss?” Towerblock asked. “Can we send them now? Loo needs…”
Sherlock dusted himself off and hummed something that could have been anywhere between an affirmative or negative.
He stood quickly and took a step back, drawing himself up to his full height and fixing his best look of cold indifference to his face. "It's the ex-boyfriend. Made a few dodgy friends down the pub on the corner. Known to be a dive where one can find white supremacist types. Britain First, EDL, that sort. The ex wanted some revenge, frighten his former girlfriend, who, by the way, is as they say 'way out of his league', the racists were only too happy to help. Although quite how a reserved but happy woman born in London to second generation parents of Indian descent represents a radical Islamist threat to British society is a mystery not even I can solve."
“Don’t do what?”
“Nick!”
“I wasn’t here, you git.”
“So soon?”
“Massage.”
“The tension is giving you a headache.”
She took a swig of the water and spat on out the worst of the soot she could taste. “Bird,” she croaked. “Loo needs an urgent evac to Bastion.”
“And what, precisely, is the point, Captain?”
Gee cringed and rather than being caught in Colonel’s tirade, tried to catch up to Sherlock. She’d hardly stepped foot in the DFAC when Simon cut her off, stepping in front of her so sharply, she nearly lost her footing. “Jesus, Simon!”
“Boss!”
“It’s a Peruvian chicken stew of sorts.” He paused to give a quick stir to the bubbling pot. “Spicy, with garlic, and cheese. Oddly Italian sounding when I describe it like that… My wife has found a new fascination with South American cuisine. I can rather see the appeal.”
“What do you want, Nick?” she asked tiredly.
John hung his head.
“You’re in a chipper mood this morning.”
“Loo? You good, kid?”
“You and I clearly differ in our definition of ‘well.’” Sherlock stood and crossed the sitting room to inspect John’s new uniform. His old uniform, actually. “As I recall, Bainbridge survived
“I’m sorry? What?”
“Yes!” Gee strode into the Det, shoving the last of her kit into the pack. “Captain Medhurst! Please, don’t let me keep you by making sure I can do something if you get yourself shot… Again.”
“Four times as busy since I got here.”
The sigh would be the last sound that Sherlock Holmes would bloody well make. Because Sherlock sighed as he came home as if he was sodding put out that someone was waiting up for him. Sighed like John was a nervous pet or a nagging wife or some sort of fucking burden and John was spitting fire as he turned around. His ears were practically ringing with his own rage. He was going to incinerate Sherlock Holmes with a single look. He was going to… He was going… to…
“Might be. Yeah. Probably yes. How are you?”
“Too long ago,” John sighed.
Blood.
John sighed and dropped onto his bunk. “Sherlock.”
John woke. It wasn’t with a start, or slowly and with a stretch. He simply came awake instantly and completely. The movement that had woken him repeated. And the entire weight of another body, a warm body, passively pinning him to the bed became the sole focus of his attention. It was a soft movement. Fingers curling and uncurling in the front of his tee-shirt. Unpredictable, lazy, unconscious movement. That he wasn’t alarmed, alert, hyper vigilant and hyperventilating should have been unusual. But there was a familiar smell – comfortable and normal – overlaying the desert and camp and military.
“I hear that’s bad for soldiers and cats.”
“Fine!” Nick snapped. “Bloody extortion!” he turned on his heel and stomped out of the med tent, straight across to the Det.
“Major,” Towerblock grinned.
Mycroft was ever grateful that his mobile opted to buzz at that moment. It was merely his assistant. Strict instructions to which she infallibly adhered: text on the reverse Fibonacci sequence from twenty-one minutes. Ensure escape where necessary.
“Holmes?” Nick cut in.
“You didn’t.”
“And the bits between?”
“In love…”
Mycroft stared.
“Alright, arm out.” He held out a towel to blot her arm and began laying the jelonet across the burns. He worked quietly, smoothing the gelled mesh up the length of her forearm.
He crossed his arms. “There are easier ways to kill yourself than what you’re doing.”
“We’re good out front,” Towerblock came back.
It was both a quick and lengthy call as Mrs. Hudson flustered through a worried diatribe from which John could only glean that Sherlock had left, gone off somewhere. And he was alone, and he wasn’t back, and it was so very late, and she was so incredibly worried. And even before he was fully awake, John was agreeing to come over. To go back to Baker Street, so that she doesn’t have to wait alone. In the back of his mind, he knows she will be in her flat, and he will be up in B, waiting separately. Together and alone. He pushed himself off of the couch, crammed his feet back into his shoes, and tugged his jacket on.
Gee glanced up, barely lifting her head above the line of her shoulders. “I can go.”
“Corporal Bird, as your superior officer, I demand you treat me with the respect I deserve.”
“Nothing you do is loving or gentle to yer balls.” Towerblock set the det wires down as Nick reached the nearest IED.
John shook his head. “Sherlock, I was discharged.”
She flinched. The expression was covered quickly by a wrinkled nose and a sniff, but it was definitely a flinch. “Maybe a month or so. Hard to say for sure.”
Silence.
John gave Sherlock a wry look, but lost the severity in the face of the mischief in Sherlock’s grin. “Oh fuck off,” John couldn’t bite back a smile.
“Then bloody spell it out for me,” John hissed. “Because I am this close to losing my temper.”
“Fine. All fine.” Oh good. John was fine.
“So. You see this car. Bird confirms it. You both shout. And then, instead of taking cover, and you were damn close to all the cover you’d need. You’re what? Out in front of the CVs?”
“Well, where would they get a brand new Fulton for this?” John asked.
Sherlock pursed his lips. “And respecting you enough not to insult your intelligence, do you honestly think playing upon a secondary school acquaintance is sufficient for me to neglect your level of clearance?”
“Why you’re spending so much time with Holmes the elder.”
“My head is fine. I’m still not sure about my balls. Check them for me?”
John let out a semi hysterical laugh. “Unconventional. Christ. There’s no way we can… There’s not enough time to redo… Oh God. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean…”
“I don’t know if you noticed-wait. No, I know you didn’t notice. It’s dinnertime. Everyone is here to eat.” John pointed a fork at Sherlock’s plate. “Which you ought to get back to.”
“You couldn’t call and tell me that I didn’t need to worry, you pillock?!”
“Who is?” Rocket flopped onto the rickety couch.
Then the car exploded.
“Wills.”
“What is it?”
Mycroft tucked his mobile back in his breast pocket and considered the burdensome tray clattering on the table in Mrs. Hudson’s wake. Ostensibly, she was just their landlord. In more practical terms, she was like their favorite grand aunt that doted and spoilt them with baked goods and attention, and had nothing even resembling a bark or bite. She’d scold them from time to time, but it held the same venom as a newborn kitten. She enjoyed their antics. Tolerated the noise and destruction. And tutted when things were not on the level. Handy having her phones tapped, though. It often allowed Mycroft the slightest peace of mind when he knew Dr. Watson would be overseeing the fallout of a particularly… destructive day. Then again, at her age, more excitement than necessary couldn’t be good for her. Mycroft cleared his throat lightly.
“John?” Spying him tucked into the corner, head down with Nuttall, Sherlock headed across the yard to the DFAC.
“His Humvee is here,” Bird answered with a shrug.
The corner of Mycroft’s mouth twitched. “Both.”
Gee released a heavy breath. “Thank God.”
“I can't even see you two. Can you move?” Towerblock asked through the coms.
“Literal?”
Nick stiffened and drew into a close approximation of parade rest. “Sir.”
John shut the door to the carriage quietly. Sherlock didn't turn around but John knew he'd heard him.
If he holds any more tightly to it, the skull will fracture. He lets her take it.
"John!" Sherlock shouts, despite the futile bells ringing in his head. Heart palpitations, squeezing the air from his chest as his heart frets itself away at all the possibilities of what could have been done to his soldier, to
"He isn't like us."
"M-Mor...Mor
Sherlock glanced down at the board; only a few pieces remained: a king and a rook to each of them, plus Moriarty’s still-centered pawn, unmoved since the game began. He moved the rook up.
“Why?” John asks, hands shoved into his pockets. “Too clean, too polite, too beautiful—?”
"You should not have." He said softly in a voice thick with darkness. "Love, it is a liability."
Sherlock huffs. “Obvious. This was taken a few days ago—”
“It’s almost morning.” He noted. “It’s good that you decided not to parse your words, John, or we’d have to take a break arguing in circles until tomorrow.”
"John, for God's sake, just eat the damn biscuit."
John smiles that stupid little knowing smile of his that sends warmth passing over Sherlock’s mind like sunshine bursting through the clouds on a foggy day.
John buries his face him his hands, grinding his palms against his eyes.
"He should have it engraved on the crest." Sherlock said dryly.
“I am like you, Mr Holmes. I do not find myself abundant in friends.”
"I love you too, you mad bastard." John smiles against Sherlock's temple.
“Not particularly.” John had answered, handing him the warm body as a trickle of red ran down his chin. “But I can’t very well have a five-course feast tonight, can I? I’d be dead drunk like the rest of them.”
It’s a new day.
She turns and looks at Sherlock, into his hard gaze as he stares back at her, a man with madness in his face.
"Sorry."
Mikheia nodded, unable to speak. John let him regain his thoughts.
"Ridiculous. Eyes can't die unless the rest of you does first."
Mikheia drops another stone into the bowl and looks up at him with raised eyebrows.
"He was supposed to get here two hours and thirteen minutes ago."
He strolled through the room, an observer in a museum of his own creation, marvelling at the preserved artefacts. Then he came to the end.
He told the inn that he wanted two beds. John had one at home; he would have one here, if he wanted. The inn keeper seemed to have had other plans. Or they were incapable of listening, that most basic human habit that many overlooked.
"Mikheia?"
The thrill of the regatta, the eve of carnival, the drink, the darkened corners, the masks pretending at monsters—it was a ripe opportunity.
With a vicious bark Gladstone obeys, throwing himself at the nearest Tenebest and burying his teeth in its neck in a gush of dark blood. As the wolves close in on him he throws himself into the fray in a spray of frothy red foam and bared teeth.
“The stag.”
John laughed. "Nervous? You?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Doubtful.” John answers. “People see what they want to with me, so he may not have been able to see me, but I would have seen him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Haven’t the foggiest, love.”
“I hoped—at your grave…” He stops, swallowing roughly. “I didn’t want you to be dead, and it seems that you heard me, so well—well done, you.” Another pause, another carefully levered word cracking on its exit into the ether. “I didn’t think my future included you in it anymore, but you’ve proven me wrong, and I don’t know your intentions in all this, but you were staring at an old tape of me
As it pass'd me flying by —
John is never alone.
“If it’s been sick, why didn’t you just end its suffering? It’s only logical.”
"John…"
Sherlock shuts his eyes. "Pink." He mutters.
say that wouldn't destroy the remains of their situation.
“Because, James Mortimer, I know what you are.”
The last shelf, started but unfinished as of late, is for John. Of course it is. He fears it will remain unfinished. Somewhere, crouched out in his cold escape, he can feel it. A fear that creeps up like an influenza, slowly and with a building heat. He might just be waiting for the day for the fever to come upon him, and he can crash through the roof of Enlightenment and bury himself so far down into the floor that he’ll never get back up. Maybe he can add another shelf for John. He’d like that, nothing and no one had ever been allowed more than one shelf before, in Enlightenment; if the shelf space was full, he’d simply built it upwards, reaching towards the ceiling. This was why the glass house of poisonous plants stretched its arms far higher than the meagre, squat case of 72 neatly placed tobacco samples.
As others saw — I could not bring
He stands, pushes his chair in, and walks out of the room.
For now. For now.
Moran laughs. Sherlock punches him in the centre of his face, sending his head cracking back into the mirror. The skull watches the bloodshed with blank eyes. Sherlock likes that it's taking such a placid attitude; he didn't need its judgment at a time like this. His grip on Moran's collar tightens as he brings their faces closer.
“I hope you don’t call her that in her presence.”
"Maybe I deserve it."
?” Sherlock yells hoarsely before he seems to collapse in on himself, rubbing the palms of his hands over his face as if he could hide himself away from his brother. “Mycroft, tell me where he is. Please…just tell me.”
Sarah chuckles, but it falls from her face after a moment. She glances around the diner—nearly empty at this time of day—and leans closer to him.
The rest of the trip had been uneventful, he and John orbiting around one another, only sharing glances and small conversation, for there was only so much of themselves they could reveal in mixed company.
"Never mind." He decided.
, he was just a boy. He didn't even look to be out of his teen years.
He had seen so much of the world in so short a time. German and Belgium in under a week, not to mention those they had passed through. He couldn't go back to Novgorod with its small walls and its concrete and its history. Not now.
“Toleration is a stepping stone to necessity.”
“I didn’t have enough time to do this last night.” John says calmly. He sounds like a doctor, stoic and concentrated. “I could only stow him here, where I knew he’d be safe, or leave him in the alley, where he’d be a corpse no one could explain. He got a good hit across my shoulder though, so I couldn’t fly him very far.”
Sherlock is perched upon the shaking memory of the same question, asked days, lifetimes earlier, to answer at first. His mind sways too much.
"Yes, we'll talk about it later! Can you get me out of here?"
Sherlock looks agitated, carding a shaking hand through his hair.
"I'm still waiting for you to push me away." Sherlock said quietly. "To tell me what I did to you was terrible, was the worst thing anybody could do, that I'm damned in your eyes and you'll have no part of me."
James Baldwin
"You're sure?"
One For Revenge
“Mycroft, it’s John. Long story short, please don’t think too hard about this, but a demon took the form of a human and fooled Sherlock into thinking he was your brother.”
"Watch out, layman's time—"
"A monumental admission, John." Sherlock said, looking over to grin at him. "I thank you."
However much power he gleans from his minor position in the British government, it unfortunately does not extend to airport security. Sherlock stands silently beside him in the queue, dutifully shedding his coat and shoes and placing them beside his carry-on in the plastic tray. Mycroft pretends not to notice that his eyes never leave the bag as it passes through the scanners.
Looks like he'd be escaping wearing women's trousers.
He had to get out.
“Is this what you’ve been thinking about? All those nights you spent locked away and brooding in your lab?”
?" Sherlock echoed with a bark. "She was more inclined than I was."
"John?" Sherlock's voice barks from below. "John—"
Now…what made him uncomfortable?
John tried to keep his mouth from falling open in shock.
The river blackened under the rising night; he could still see quite well, but he knew the rest of the soldiers would have a harder time of it. John stopped, unstopping his canteen as if he needed water, and took a long drink, the liquid cool and thick from the snow and ice.
John still seemed to have some resemblance of a life, which was good. He still called and met with old friends, there were still nights were he went out, but every night he dutifully returned, and that's wasn't an exaggeration.
The lights shut off.
The door swung open, revealing a large, low room, lit by gleaming candelabras.
“Melodrama was never your strong point, brother dear. You’d never shown or felt strong affection for anyone, so, naturally, when John came along you mistook dependency for love...”
John looked up at him for a long moment, something indiscernible in his face, the pensive crease in his brow.
“No, I don’t.”
"Holmes?" The man interrupts, a curious grin on his face. "Like—?"
“In the most economic sense, he was an available and effective resource. In the personal sense, I watched him waste away and I knew I could save him, so I did.”
Sherlock leaned back on his heels, letting his thumb stroke lazy circles on John's thick, heated flesh. "What grade would you diagnose yourself as having?"
"The hotel." John decided firmly. "Get back to the hotel."
"You make everything lighter." He says quietly, thumbs brushing the soft insides of John's palms as he lays his head against John's chest. "You mute the noise."
, Sherlock, as good as your little veil of melodrama might make that sound.”
“‘One moment’ seems to be the family motto.” Mycroft says monotonously, observing the titles of the books on the desk.
; teasing and peaceful, playing at the corners of his mouth.
“How's the job?"
"So what's that, then?" Lestrade asks, gesturing to the symbol painted on the man's chest.
The hum of the violin bow shifted abruptly into a fast-paced plucking, sending his memories flying back to gaslights, dirty streets, crinolines. He almost smiled, but he knew to give a full critique he couldn’t be compromised, so he reigned his attention back in, focusing in on every minute detail.
Irene frowned. “When were you going to tell him you were falling out of love? Then? Now? A hundred years? A thousand? You knew the two of you were going to dance around the topic as it rotted on the vine until something came along to make up your mind for you, and luckily enough I was travelling with Josephine on her way to Medevi…”
“To the blood!”
“That’s circular reasoning, love. You hate that.” John’s hand moved to stroke his forehead, and he began thinking of the feel of sunshine, a warm wind, the songs of birds, laughter.
Where to look? Billy was taken care of for the moment, but his blood was no good, even with the silver infection. Their kind could not drink from each other for sustenance—he patted at his coat, remembering the weight against his breast, and pulled out the flask, shaking it a little.
you can cause sometimes. And that's the worst part. Whenever your plans are involved, I'm already being set up to fall."
"No, I doubt you can stay out of the way."
He half-expected the boy to ask how he knew all these things, as John once did, but, again, he was surprised.
"I think it is perfect."
Sherlock headed towards the archway, mind still circling his memories in the hospital, a great unease blanketing his nerves. He'd been gone longer than he'd anticipated, although Mycroft's intelligence had been worth the trip two-fold. Leaving John alone had not been sitting well with him, especially after he had seen that photograph.
"As I said before, it was a combination. I called Mycroft to inquire if he could keep you in Bruges. He acquiesced, although he also misunderstood my request to mean that, so long as you remained in Bruges, anything could happen to you."
"I kill people for money! Wouldn't you call that a change?"
Sherlock waited until he heard the door shut to lift his head. It was a wonder he could even do that. But the promise that something of
"Address,
There's no point in hiding his feelings regarding John. Not anymore.
He told Sherlock.
John didn't know. Somewhere, being a mad genius alone in a corner, he supposed.
and alone that for one single terrible moment Sherlock felt like his heart might have actually stopped out of sympathetic grief.
A pulse of cold fear panged through him as he realised who John was chasing, a man clad in grey that Sherlock knew with unflinching certainty was the same man from Mycroft's photograph.
"Not exactly.” John says and Mikheia smiles, despite himself. Despite the situation. He’s alive and he might die and it’s just wonderful and
“I know who you are, Mr Holmes. I know who you work for.”
“Did you see anything?” John asks as the people begin to file out of the church, leaving them alone in the antechamber. His toes curl with the cold.

“I can’t wait.”
John had learned his lesson.
"Funny how that happens."
This chapter is for the first track, "I Should Live in Salt" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK-EF9fAHIY). The excerpt above is from an interview with The National's singer Matt Berninger, a wonderful human being and A++ lyricist. The things that voice does to you, man. The things that voice does to you.
"When you arrived at the door to Mycroft's summer home, bloody, barely-alive, and in a state that I never desire to see you in again, you managed to say Mary's name before you passed out. I became suspicious, so I called her and discovered, among the many other things she said in her upset and panicked state, that she was under Mycroft's payroll. She told me that Mycroft had ordered her not to interfere with whatever happened to you. She told me it was because I had called him."
He caught a hint of a smirk on Sherlock’s face and seized on it.
To remind him of what he'd lost? A memento mori? A souvenir?
He shuts his eyes.
"I have my ways of getting them to talk."
. By the look of things, the best thing to come from this trip had been the fact that he and John were having sex in a foreign location.
myself as a test, yes. Do keep up, unless that trip in the saddle has scrambled what's left of your brains."
Sherlock paused a moment.
"Expecting someone?" John asked. Past the initial impression, the whiskey was settling into his bones nicely, driving out the evening cold.
"Open your eyes and look at me." The hand moved from his jaw, pawing at the space under his eyes. "Open your eyes, John."
“No, I’m sure I heard it. Check from the balcony.”
The multilevel car park smelled of oil and dirt, as many tended to do. It smelled dark and damp, metallic, of thick rust and new blood. John could hear the Miljacka River thunder furiously behind it like adrenalin enhanced blood through a vein. He peered over the edge of the concrete lip. The river was dangerously close, as if the rising floodwaters would sweep the car park away soon. He hoped it had been built on good foundation.
John waited beneath one of the arcades, form shadowed by the flickering oil lamps. He sighed, watching boats passing against the night, just past the balustrade, so close he might reach out and touch them. Something within him loved the water, the immediate presence of it, it’s depth, the rhythm as it came forward, then back. It was a constant, something he felt lucky to bear witness to, no matter how much time had passed. This water was blue, not quite as clear as the southern seas, where the Aegan, water was so blue you could lose yourself completely, so blue it matched his eyes, there in the night, half-drunk, half-daring you both to jump off the cliffside and surrender to it, because you could, you could survive it, survive him –
John feels a wave of irritation, cinnamon and the burn of ginger, emanate from Sherlock.
“Their corporal form, perhaps, but not their essence. Angels and Nephilim do not exist in bodies in their realm, they exist in what I describe as projections of consciousness.”
"I can't help it."
He’s cut off as Azazel barrels into him, knocking him down into the road, and he curls into himself, using his knees to spring the demon’s weight off him and sending him careening into the gutter.
"Please, John, a pebble with the power to make your body live forever? Sounds a little too good to be true because it is; it doesn't exist. I learned a long time ago that there's no use looking for immortality in a little rock." She crouches to meet his eyes, her own bright with fervour. "It's an
"Then why—" John swallowed, his voice hoarse. "Why did you lie to me? How do I know you're not lying to me now or that you won't later on?"
Mycroft, upon being alerted by his reconnaissance team, finds the flat empty. He’s almost impressed by how long Sherlock has lasted.
“Croydon. It’s where—”
. It was worth many things. Worth this, worth what was to come, and worth everything else.
He stands in the middle of 237.
But no. No. The way he had felt under Sherlock's hands, warm and soft, the way the sheets still smelled of sex and sweat and
As the Golem stepped into the light, Sherlock lowered his gun. His hands were shaking.
John looked up at him. His curls had come loose from their careful containment, wild and backlight by the moon, and he had the mad, unbidden thought of the devil, here in front of him, in the night and the sand. This morning his greatest desire had been to fly for a moment with the wind in his hair, and now he was kneeling in some stranger's blood. Tempted to ruin by a brief moment of flight, and now he was crashing to the ground.
"I didn't." John answers.
"How do you take your tea?"
"No, John, I know that this is not the opportune time or place. I am simply stating fact. You are still angry with me for leaving you."
“The watch won’t even be aware of what’s hit them until well into tomorrow morning.” He huffed, then, as if to make a point, set all his gathered tomes and sheaves of parchment on the table so hard John imagined it would buckle under the sudden weight. “We’ll have this conversation now.”
. Like Itin,
Irene stares back just as stoically.
It felt very much like this.
"No need." She smiles, turning her eyes defiantly to Sherlock. "Not for this one."
Sherlock nodded. He didn't trust himself to speak.
"No, I don't. I want you here, always."
"Do you think you'll grow a beard again?" He asked. John grunted from below the brim of his hat. "I rather liked it."
“What is it?”
Sebastian Moran thought himself a common man. He paid his taxes. He liked children. He was polite, and rarely raised his voice at anyone who didn’t deserve it. A military man through and through. But it was the perverted morality that he’d shed like a stifling coat and now he could breathe again, like he’d cast off a fever. That breed of
They pause.
"Why are they here?" Sherlock asks as John rolls the dead beast onto its back. A shiny burn is imprinted in the skin above its heart.
Eurus jerked his head back up. "Look. Mycroft is being entertaining. I picked the wrong brother. On your feet," Eurus hissed at him. She snapped her fingers and a collar with a leash attached was placed in her hand. She locked it around Sherlock's throat and began to drag him towards their brother.
John had left him cuffed so held the cup up to his lips.
"Give him 10 minutes. Then I want Mycroft to speak to him."
"It may not be fair, but it certainly is fun." Greg caught Mycroft's ankle and started running the wheel over it. The government official tried to wiggle away, but only succeeded in making himself bounce in place.
Greg laughed outright and picked up the dice, rolling it. He sighed and moved the meagre 2 he had gotten.
"What?"
Hi everyone, I don't mean to be rude but I know what way this fiction is going. I know how close to its end I am. Those of you who are TELLING me where to take it, please don't. 5 years of hard work have gone into this fic and I'm determined to finish it MY WAY or not at all. That means it will not become a slutty fic. It will not become a 'lock Sherlock in the playroom' (seriously?) Fic. And it certainly won't become a slave Sherlock fic.
"Oh yeah… lets go to one we haven't seen yet."
“I told him not to enter my bedroom without specific permission and he hasn’t. But you’re right, the other rooms, so far, I have failed to mention at all.”
Sherlock didn’t take it and the doctor realised whatever was about to be said couldn’t be good, but then from what he had said so far he hadn’t really been predicting it to be the best experience Sherlock had ever had. He tugged at his curls roughly in order to ground him.
Greg’s voice interrupted his self-berating. “Lestrade, I need answers.”
Sherlock flinched and ducked his head.
“What caused you to go into Panic, pet?”
Sherlock managed to look over his shoulder, slower this time so he didn't hurt himself.
"Sir, I don't know what I can do or say to help."
They passed the men without incident and soon found themselves on the beach. The crash of waves sounded along with the call of birds, making everything seem peaceful.
Finn just closed his eyes again. “What about a private tutor?” Sherlock asked. “When you turn 5?” If he was honest, he didn’t want to let the boy out of his sight any more than Finn wanted to leave him.
"You would have outright refused to come in."
Something Mycroft did drew his attention away from the screen and he came in a sudden rush. He let his head fall back and he let out a long moan of satisfaction. When Mycroft pulled off of him, John looked back at the screen and the beginnings of afterglow fled. He rolled out of the way and let Greg and Mycroft carry on.
“You will do what you are told!” John snapped, but he didn’t raise his voice, he never did. “Or do I have to start adding to your already incredibly large tally?”
He was gone.
Greg grumbled from beside them. "What are you two doing?" He complained.
"What the-"
"What?" Mycroft laughed, knowing exactly what his little brother was going to say.
“Stop that, Finn,” Sherlock ordered softly. He made it to the bathroom and settled the boy on the floor as he ran the bath and kicked the door shut at the same time. When he saw Finn head toward it he flicked the lock that they had moved to about 5 foot so he couldn't lock himself inside.
"Time." It was Mycroft who spoke.
In no way was Sherlock's position meant to be comfortable but John hadn't meant it to be. He wanted some honest answers out of the brat, these stress positions seemed to be the only way that would happen.
. 10.6MB
John let his boy's head go and pushed him. He swayed in the bondage and began to struggle.
“Why do you keep saying suitcase?”
A small shiver ran through Sherlock, but beyond that he didn't move.
Mycroft smiled at Finn and rolled the dice, getting a six. "That's how it's done, little brother."
Sherlock barked out a laugh. “Why? You’ll get bored of me in a few days and send me back to my brother. That’ll be just what I need after you for a few days.”
“It is an involuntary reaction to well…”
“Before you ask, yes, I’ve had to do it before. Because the sub hurt himself the first time he lost control.”
He let it press all the way in to the hilt and tilted the machine just so, making it brush along his prostate. The second time that evening, Sherlock felt the spark of arousal wanting to settle in. He huffed into his gag, pissed off at the Dom for blocking off his speech.
"Typical." Greg pinched his boy's over sensitive nipple and laughed when Mycroft yelped. "I should use this on your cock later." He set the wheel aside and bent to suck a bruise on his boy's shoulder.
“Of course, pet, you’d still be by the wall if you weren’t.”
"Ha. You were knocked out hard too, then."
"This is for your own protection, Sherlock. Now stop struggling!"
Mycroft made an appearance, looking quite dishevelled and barely awake.
“You’ve added an extra 4 to your tally, by the way.”
Sherlock ducked but didn't say anything for a moment.
"I'm meant to be, Gregory. I thought that, along with the cuddles, we might try something a bit... sweeter than our usual." Mycroft licked his spoon again, very deliberately.
"What?"
Sherlock snorted. He wasn't a child anymore. He could cope very well on his own. “Why?! I coped with it alone when it was happening. Reliving it is hardly going to be any worse.”
“He’s just nervous,” John said with a smile.
John smiled. “Good boy.” He really wanted to just lean over and kiss him, but the boy was looking so awkward and out of place as it was. John didn’t want to confuse the lad further.
He caught the tail end of something that he immediately didn’t like, “… always was a useless slut.” The doctor caught sight of his defenceless sub on the floor, fighting to get back onto his knees. He glanced at John in fear and his heart shattered. The boy looked just as frightened of him as he did of the man who had laid him out on the floor in the first place.
Sherlock glanced down at his cock still trapped in its cage and then to the Dom who held the remote like it was the most powerful thing on Earth.
He assessed the roof beneath his dangling legs and was sure it would take his weight. It wasn’t being up here that was bothering him, chasing criminals all across London as well as avoiding Lestrade and the Met had its benefits; roofs were his favourite place. No, what was bothering him was the descent. Usually he had a plan, because usually he climbed up so would know his way down, he didn’t think he had gone up the inside of a building and down the outside before. He would have to try the drainpipe, which was a common tool he had in his arsenal.
When Sherlock tried to interfere he was grabbed by two guards and forced to his knees.
"Sherlock, why didnt you tell Gregory you hurt yourself?"
“Your mum won't get out of prison, babe,” John could immediately sense what was getting to Sherlock.
He was panting slightly by the time they got there. The sound deeply imbedded inside him moved and jostled completely new things and feelings inside him. Feelings he had never felt before. Feelings he wasn't sure he wanted to keep experiencing.
“I don’t care whether he likes it or not. It needs to be done or the past will repeat itself like it did last week.”
Sherlock stopped himself from laughing, but gave her a little shrug. He shouldn't have, he knew, but he couldn't resist.
He flinched and looked up.
“Crawl over here and sit between my legs. On your way, pick up my stick and the suitcase you disobeyed me for.”
Sherlock sighed silently. "Could you at least take the gag out, little sister?"
“So you thought you would steal mine?”
Just after lunch, John gave him an hour with strict instructions to be back within the allotted time and not to go into the playroom. Sherlock grinned to himself, this was his chance!
How could he forget? He managed to keep his mouth shut, though, he wasn't having John making this worse for him.
This time, when the doctor held Sherlock before the fire, he rocked him gently. "I hadn't planned to play so soon, but maybe we can do something light tomorrow. I think we both need it."
"God sake just let us down!" Mycroft snapped.
John slapped him. Of course that action made Sherlock jerk where he knelt and he yelled out.
"Well I do. Don't let them get to you, 'Lock. We'll be going home in just a few more hours."
“Um…”
Sherlock shrugged almost sheepishly. “I’m sorry, sir, but my number is on the website… the old website.”
He was distracted by his phone as it caught his eye. Sherlock was waving dramatically. He flicked it off mute.
"Get up," Eurus ordered the detective. "Now!"
By the time she finished with the chair, it was nothing more than splinters. She stood over the pieces, breathing heavily with her fingers tangled in his hair.
At that, Sherlock sighed and heaved in a breath instead.
Greg stepped in, but his sub didn't - he stood hesitant at the door.
For his part, the sub could feel John's eyes on him. The heat of their gaze warmed him and made him want to squirm under his scrutiny. To keep the attention, he managed to keep himself completely still.
“Now why would I offer you a reward and not give it to you?” John asked him the same question again because he was determined to get a more informative answer.
"Good, doggie,” Irene said.
“What?” John pushed the boy away to look into his eyes. “What on earth are you sorry for?”
Finn grinned. “They bigger than me?”
John stared blankly after his walking sub for a moment and then smiled innocently at the Californian looking rather bewildered. He slammed the cab shut and jogged slightly to catch his boy up.
“Go’way.”
“S-Sir-”
"You never told me he'd hurt himself!" Mycroft snapped at his Dom.
Sherlock almost headbutted the small bit of glass he was looking through in shock. It wasn't the same woman as before, this lady was older. Where was the younger one? Still in the box?
“19.”
. Everything that has the opportunity to hurt you further matters.”
John knew he had to move quickly, he got as far into the room as possible before letting Sherlock hear him and then he pulled the tight arm binder up over his arms, it had happened so fast Sherlock hadn't seen it coming to fight.
“Quiet. Or I will gag you.”
“I don’t like water.”
“Sorry.”
John smacked the back of his head.
“Then leave. Me. Alone!”
John let his head go and paced out of the room, leaving Mycroft in the dark once more.
The detective frowned in confusion. "Whatever you like, sir."
“John can I borrow you for a moment?”
“What?” The detective stared at it blankly.
“In my house, Sherlock, you follow my rules. For the first few weeks you will ask permission to do everything. You need the bathroom, you ask me. Go to bed? You ask me. Get dressed, if I allow your clothes, that is, you ask me. Is all that understood?”
Finn tried to take off again but John stopped him.
John could see clearly that the boy was just going to argue with him at every opportunity. He was fine with that. He knew yesterday had been too good to be true and he knew this sub was going to be difficult. It was what Mycroft had warned him about after all. At this point in time, he didn’t really care why the brat had attempted to escape again. He had assumed they had formed a connection yesterday and he was positive that was genuine and not some performance. Nobody could ‘pretend’ to be that scared when he went into Panic.
“For every 5 seconds you delay, your tally goes up.”
“Sherlock. He set it up. His attitude at the club, it was a plan. A plan that has succeeded and he has gone.”
“No ‘buts’. What will you do if you want to come?”
Sherlock stepped up towards him. “No. No, I do. I just... Mrs. Hudson will make a fuss.”
“And what is Angelos?” Siger asked.
His master's grip tightened and he ran his hand to the head of his prick, not needing lube, he'd leaked enough precome over the last several hours that he was slick enough already.
“Did you even make it back to the office?”
After completely disrobing, Sherlock turned away, his hands subconsciously moving to cover his cock. There was no point in being shy, he knew. John could do practically anything he wanted and he was here for at least three months - according to the Dom anyway. He just couldn’t bring himself to stand stark naked in front of the man who seemed to make him obey with a pointed look and a sigh.
The sub just waited as John stepped away.  He waited a long time. A very long time for Sherlock and then fingers were at his entrance. It made him flinch. One soft finger and then a second. John spent several minutes lubing his pet's arse. The intention was to be pleasurable, not painful. The detective huffed several times through the gag. It was just air.
"I don't doubt Sherlock would have had the same view point if he could speak."
"Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?" Sherlock whispered.
“You called me Sherlock,” he stated as if it was the most obscure thing in the world.
The doctor glanced over at the other Dom. "What do you think Mr. Lestrade?" He asked. "Do you think that means something? Or do you think it means something else?"
John's grin was almost imperceptible, but it was there. Something in Sherlock knew the look he was receiving from his Dom so he smiled internally, determined to be as well behaved as he possibly could be. Not for this woman, but for John.
"I knew it had something to do with you, you clever girl," Irene said with a smile. "Now about Mycroft." She walked over to the trunk and looked into it.
There was also the fact of how long he seemed to stay under. Whether that was a normal response for him in general was a hard thing to evaluate. At a guess, John assumed it was because of his past relationships with Doms that he had stayed under a lot longer than he would have done the first time on purpose. Whilst under, he wouldn’t have been that effected by much in his drowsy dreamy state. It would have made it easy for him to ignore people.
Between watching his Dom to check he really was there, Sherlock kept glancing across at Mycroft, he wanted to feel guilty for his position but decided not to, not with what he had just realised. Mycroft had gone after the consulting criminal to catch him, not because he knew his little brother was there, he hadn't known he'd escaped like several of the missed phone calls would have likely told him. Then he remembered what the older Holmes had said when he had mentioned this whole situation being about the government official, 'I know' he had said. But that meant... that meant he had known Moriarty would go after Sherlock. Would hurt Sherlock to get to him, which also meant Mycroft had to love his little brother a lot for Moriarty to use him as a threat. But not only that... he had put all his resources and efforts, including pissing off his Dom, into finding James Moriarty so he was no longer a threat. To either of them.
"I'm bored of you hitting him there, babe," Eurus said, sounding so far from normal that Sherlock choked on nothing. "Hit him somewhere else."
The doctor shook his head. "Oh no no, this is way more fun."
Sherlock shook his head in a frantic motion. "I can't because I don't know." Again he tried to look away, but before he managed it, John saw a single glistening tear in his eye.
He cautiously got to his feet and walked from the room, slow enough for Kate to follow. He hated walking slowly and the look on John's face was enough to tell him he'd done the right thing.
Once he'd placed some of his sharper clamps on Sherlock's nipples he backed up and ordered his sub over the bench.
“I’m sorry, sir,” he repeated.
Moriarty chuckled. “He didn't make it difficult.”
Sherlock pushed his hands into his pockets. “Am I not?”
Sherlock just accepted the situation mutely.
“Good boy. Go to the kitchen. Crawl. When you get there, put the kettle on and fill the flask. It’s in the cupboard in the corner by the fridge.”

John makes some unforeseen progress this time.
Wet grey-green eyes flickered up in surprise. “If I’m allowed, sir.”
Nodding, sheepishly, this time, Sherlock took it. John led him to the door and down the stairs. “How long is Baker Street, boy?”
Irene had been heading backwards to the chest, but she paused to think for a moment.
Out of shock, the detective’s head snapped up. “Sir?” he queried with caution in abundance.
John pondered that to himself. It was quite an achievement, the boy was only 24.
"Yes. So run from this one and we'll run into another."
“An hour? That’s insane-”
Eurus gave her odd smile, then backed away, wagging her finger and shaking her head. "I'll never tell."
All three children giggled. Greg and Mycroft didn’t do much better in hiding their mirth.
“I’m sorry, sir,” he repeated.
"What do I do with him? He's still in one of those moods."
"But, you said-"
"Thank you, Mycroft," John said, having noticed the government official's little trick. He held out his hand for the ginger. "And thank you, Greg. You want things tough, you little brat, then you can get things tough." He began easing the ginger into his hole without fingering him first.
With smooth, graceful motions, the Superintendent crawled between John's legs. He could already feel himself starting to relax and fall into subspace from John's single order.
For the detective it was yet another opportunity to work out where the Dom lived ruined. Would he ever know?
"Closest thing to a jungle floor we could get. You should have seen the guy's face when I asked for it to be put in."
The woman who answered the door comes in, collecting the sundried abandoned coffee mugs and plates into a stack on a tray, a dishtowel slung over her shoulder.
As Sherlock struggled with the creature, he regained his footing, unsheathing a blade he kept strapped to his garter for just such occasions. He waited for his opportunity, watching carefully as Sherlock grasped the thing around its squirming, screaming body, before he lunged forward, piercing it clean through with no harm done to his brother. It let out a loud, lingering wail, then fell from Sherlock’s arm, disintegrating to the floor.
Then he remembers that he lives in London, the eternal raincloud, and he can't be arsed to care anymore because if the weather really hinges on John's presence then he'd be perfectly happy for it to rain every day the rest of his life.
Sherlock frowned as Mikheia opened the door.
The voice is German, maybe, or somewhere thereabouts; Dutch, perhaps, or Belgian. Average tone, slightly higher than the normal male’s, and it’s not impossible for a woman to have a lower-ranging pitch. Inconclusive identity then. He won’t know who they are until or unless they want him to.
"I knew what I would be doing to you. I knew, and I'm sorry. You have to believe me, John. I've been—I've been quite inhuman since I left. I did things I'm not proud of, I hurt people because I couldn't control myself, I even went on a hunger strike because I thought some poor old woman in Hong Kong was trying to poison me. Turns out she just thought I liked tofu, and she was correct. I wish she had just
Equally unsavoury, but the prospect of John’s presence back in his life is sorely tempting. The prospect of injury to John’s person is not. The chance of his abduction, torture, or death is high. The risks rival the reward.
He sat on the sill, throwing his legs over, and looked back.
“I’ll get it.” Sherlock said, disappearing into the kitchen.
This is what Sherlock decides, after reading the text on Mycroft’s phone.
"Yes. I love it." Sherlock slurs. "Don't you?"
“No, I mean you
The tracks scream underneath them for a moment and Sherlock is reminded of the sound John made when he fell to him. He wonders what sound it would make when he left.
"Doesn't mean I'm not."
“I don’t like Bern.” He says into the quiet street, breath steaming in the air.
"This is Sherlock Holmes, a visiting investigator from—"
“I need your keys to the morgue.” He says calmly to Alkaev.
“And I can’t live a life without you, now that I’ve known what it’s like. We’re at an impasse, then.”
In his death, those responsible had sealed their own, for now Sherlock had no morality to live by.
“You can tell me, sir.”
"Want to talk about it?"
Stop that. There’s time later. Someone is following him, and doing it poorly. He’d found out why, but all in good time.
"I take it you didn't serve."
He stumbles out of the room, flailing feet dragging against the rough stone as his captor hauls him down a hall. He can hear laughter somewhere. He can hear screaming somewhere else.
He stands, shrugging on his impossibly long coat as he strides out of the room.
“Eh,” She shrugs. “Let the men have their fun, then maybe take a finger or two…but that’d hurt business, wouldn’t it?” She laughs, ignoring Lita as she bursts into great, terrible sobs. Sherlock closes his eyes, and sees that child staring at him.
"You're a terrible liar." Irene said, and they both shared a small, sad smile. The kind born from the deeper sorrows, of regret, failure, the irony of a hundred years of knowledge without learning a damn thing.
“Together.” Sherlock said.
“I will. I…John—” Sherlock stops, choking on all the words swimming in his chest. He’s awash in awe, in the relief he feels that this man is his, has chosen to be his and to stay with him, and he feels small in the tide. “I don’t know what happened tonight. I don’t…I don’t remember, to be honest. It was like I was watching myself hurt you, and I could do nothing. I—It was like I thought you were him. You were Moriarty, or he was here, I don’t know, but it felt
“Harry,” John began, “what are you doing here? I thought you liked L.A.”
"Black Down." Sherlock repeats. "When Bristol was being bombed by the Luftwaffe the nearby area of Black Down was disguised to resemble Bristol under a blackout so the Germans would bomb it instead of the real town. Quite similar to this, but, lest I fall into Mycroft's habit of naming plans that will ultimately fail after events in World War II British history, I will draft a second option, something that never seemed to cross his mind."
“What are you implying?”
A loud howl rings over the debris it caused.
She smiled, disappearing it up her sleeve. “What is it?”
"Privet, Mikheia. Tebe uzhe luchshe?"
“Moran.”
, Lestrade, do use your head. The fashion magazines on the table in the foyer are addressed to her and the decoration around the flat is quite obviously feminine—if you doubt that, have a chat with John on whether he knows about the colour schemes you see here because I rather doubt a typical man would unless it was their profession—and she clearly knew what she was doing, so she either had to hire a decorator or she was one herself. When the former is considered, it must then be speculated on what exactly her job was, as she would have had to make quite a lot of money to contract someone with tastes this refined. Certainly she could have been a banker or stockbroker or editor or held some other fanciful occupation, but when the fact that this flat is situated closely to Canary Wharf as well as that it is virtually unlived in, one can make the conclusion that the owner did not spend much time in it and instead worked on her contacts in the financial district to rope in more clients, of whose time she spent more of at their homes or a nice hotel than her own. Plus," Sherlock reaches into his pocket and draws something out. "It wasn't too much of a stretch to imagine. She has it written on her business cards."
“Blackberries, right. I’ll—yeah. I’ll go do that. Thank you Sherlock, I—you’re doing the right thing. John would want you to eat.”
"Yes, imagine that," John says. "An overprotective, control-obsessed Holmes."
“We need Quinn.”
and when Sherlock can finally feel the blood coming back to his brain, his face contorts in anger.
"Don't need one where we're going."
"You do, to be an agent. I am an independent criminal profiler the FBI calls in from time to time. I normally work with Scotland Yard, but recent events have called me here."
“Obviously not.” He murmurs. “‘M gonna sit now.” He half-stumbles to his chair, where he curls into himself.
"Disappointed?"
"Hardly anyone ever tells me I'm right. Usually their pride gets in the way."
John sighed and stood, tossing his book back on the chair as he walked over to get his coat.
"Do I need a reservation or something? You're making it seem like a five-star restaurant. And I don't want there to be a list, John, I really don't—"
Sherlock’s head swam, his thoughts trickling away, disconnected and slow. He’d heard John, heard all the things he said, he just couldn’t make
John continues to not answer or acknowledge that he would at least attempt to fight him in some way, and it is
She takes his hand and leads him back down the gaping hall to where Gladstone slobbers onto the floor and Mortimer fusses over the skull, nestled in the bowl of the laver next to a section of scaffolding pipe and a single feather.
He glances both ways.
He wiped at Sherlock's brow and his hand came away red. He looked confused, like the answer didn't fit the question. "I couldn't get the blood off."
“Which one do you want?” Sherlock asked, laying his head on John’s shoulder. They’d left the window open despite the spring chill, and neither had bothered dressing, not since Sherlock had climbed through the window the night before.
be clear:” he continued, “the reason I wanted to leave is not because I don’t love you, not because I don’t want to be with you, and not because I want to never see you again. I wanted to leave because being with you was killing me. Don’t give me that look, you know it’s true. You aren’t ignorant of many things, Sherlock, and certainly not about me, but you ignored me for weeks, made my simplest affections feel burdensome, made me feel as if I was an accessory to your life, following you around like that, listening to you and Irene. You turned our bond off for
That was unexpected.
"S16, the atomic number for sulphur. The sample on her hand was diluted with hydrogen peroxide as a kind of damage control, although it seems to have only partially worked as her palm
For a moment, for one moment, he has his finger on the trigger, ready to put a bullet into any part of Moran he can find, but then he catches a twisted scar—there’s too little body mass, not enough weight, too much hair—and he grabs Mikheia by the arms, or tries to, but the boy is slick to the elbow with blood.
“Oh, give me some credit, she was still the thing I was hunting and I still had a job to do.”
“No.” The voice replies solemnly. “You’ve got the wrong heart for it.”
“I didn’t intend to make it your first encounter.”
“Why, you gonna hit me with it? Smack some sense into me?”
A notion that his mind was trying to convince him was supposed to be comforting.
It's most definitely the crime scene they were looking for; the dogs made sure of that, but the blood doesn't lie. It's painted and pooled on almost every surface they can see.
Usually afterwards they would fall asleep, wrapped up together. They didn’t necessarily need it, but sometimes they needed a respite, a biological crutch to fall back on while they recuperated. Sex was always intense after they’d been apart; once in Amsterdam  after a long separation Sherlock had nearly ripped out his neck. No harm done, and John rather considered it the hottest sex of his life as well as his death, but it was one thing to have an otherworldly orgasm and quite another to have it ripped away from you and thrown into the next universe over.
John.
"Whenever you have a night terror and I run up here thinking you're being murdered when really it's just me who's killing you—you always seem surprised that I'm here."
In the distance, they can hear howling. The fight is over. Sherlock doesn't know who won, but he knows he doesn't want that storage unit to be empty.
Mikheia replied in a short, hearty bark.
“—so it is some other staining substance you wouldn’t be caught dead in. Jam, possibly, maybe even wine although you abstain in moments of stress because you fear mother’s problem is genetic, or—oh.” Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Someone hit you and drew blood, didn’t they? You’ve healed overnight, so it was only superficial, and I’m recalling that the print of your shirt is only available in a few neighbourhoods in Stockholm, so perhaps you’ve been here longer than previously thought. You’ve met someone here who was mad at you enough to punch you regardless of the consequence and either ruined multiple shirts or you were caught off-guard by their presence and rescinded a short trip in favour of a longer stay, because you’re attached to this person and you feel responsible—no, you feel guilty, like you owe them something and can only offer more of your time…”
"I have no idea what you mean." He sniffs, deliberately obtuse.
There will be no more after that.
?" John sits up and takes the rag off his face then instantly regrets it as light pours into his eyes and to him it may as well be molten lava. When his vision clears he sees that Sherlock has placed a worn-out, raggedy tiger in front of him that smells of the dirt and dampness of the Thames. It looks innocuous enough, sitting on its rump with all four legs sprawled in front of it. So John takes the scientific approach.
“It sounds vulgar.”
He stuffs his balled up fists into his pockets and turns away from her, hunched in his frustration. Leave me alone, just grant me that kindness.
…fine. But he stay away from my daughter.”
His damned
Later. They will talk later.
"Maybe." Moran smirks. "Does it bother you?"
“Get you a new friend.”
Sherlock felt himself smile against John as his head gently rose and fell with every breath John took. Combined with his hand, gentle and soothing in Sherlock's curls, Sherlock briefly considered the fact that he may have finally found the cure to his persistent insomnia before he fell asleep, thinking that, of all the places on the Earth, there was nowhere else he'd rather be.
Sherlock shakes his head, and leaves before they can ask any more unnecessary questions. He shrugs his coat on—more insulated but less stylish than his old one—and enters the night.
"Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll be fine. Watch your back, and make sure he keeps his gun out." John turned to Mikheia. "You'll be safe with her, and she'll be safe with you. If she gets hurt, it'll be on you, understand?"
Sherlock rolled his next words around before he spoke again. “You blushed just now, right at the ear. Who was it?”
John stared at him for a moment, then looked away.
"You will be emitted tomorrow since that's more of a flesh wound than a festering bullet." He said in that low, scratchy voice that made Mikheia think of darkness that pulsed with evil. "And unless you get on the train I tell you to, you'll find yourself with another bullet wound to worry about. And make no mistake, I don't miss twice."
"Well then that was one time too many."
It was the witching hour, a time most active in darkness where the only light shone from the stars above.
"Sherlock, I—no. I can't."
"Morning, John."
on us, Sherlock,” Lestrade snaps. “I’m sure you were just as amazed as I am when you met him.”
"Tomorrow is the 12th of November."
“I’m never going to get past this.” Sherlock mutters quietly and Mycroft fears that he can take him at his word.
"Are you mine, John?"
have good reason to pop Seb one, but that doesn’t mean you have to. And your aunt’s not too happy that she had to bring you in herself.”
John looked at him, an infinitesimal regret seeping into his gaze. He opened his mouth then shut it, looking at anything else but Sherlock.
“No,” he answered slowly, prickling at the edges, “but it’s not really your business, is it?”
"To be honest, I thought a quiet death would be quite boring."
"You know," Mikheia continued, "For a man very smart as you, you can be very stupid sometimes."
I want from you?"
"Yes, you did, and Ronnette Pulaski's too. I heard you. What you were looking for is not what I am looking for. Kindly refrain from reminding me of your irrelevant protocol for manicures. Thank you."
Mycroft stepped out to answer a suspiciously timed phone call, leaving the two alone.
"Neither do you, I reckon," Sherlock huffed, drawling out the words in a slow, ropey voice, as natural sounding as the postmistress or the bartender at the saloon, before he slipped back into his normal voice. "If I had to guess, I'd say...Indiana?"
John woke with a start, the slam ringing in his ears far longer than normal or needed. He did not miss or appreciate the irony that he had just overcome one concussion only to possibly enter another.
He'd tell Sherlock. Sherlock would know exactly what to make of all this, especially what had been written on the back of that bracelet—
He was
"Don't you think that's a little wasteful?"
John groaned, rolling over to look at the clock. “It’s only past six, Harry.”
John exhales heavily, suddenly feeling the exhaustion his injuries have caused.
If he had picked anything up from his time with Sherlock, it was his habit of people-watching, which was gleefully exacerbated by the agency; they took that basic rudimentary skill and taught him how to use it, moulded it to their needs. When he'd first started, he had the abstract feeling that Sherlock would have been proud of him, or as proud as he could be of anything that he'd had a direct hand in (somewhere John knew he'd claim all the credit and give the agency none they deserved).
John is still here, in spite of the dangers he brought down on everyone around him. And Sherlock tolerates him, still takes John along on some of the cases, still as brilliant and incredible as ever. And John is terrified. He knows what it's like to almost lose Sherlock, he's almost lost him so many times. He can't lose him again, and he cannot hurt him again. It's too dangerous to be close to Sherlock.
“Nothing. Go take that call.”
Screwhole grunted.
“Hey, Sherlock?” John asked softly.
“Sherlock Holmes. He’s not exactly combat trained, is he?”
Nick grinned. “You didn’t think you could sneak off without saying goodbye again, Wills?”
“Did you lose your appetite again? Because I’m finding myself famished.”
“Shout,” Towerblock offered.
“You,” Bird gestured broadly. “And what I can only assume is a serious war wound.”
“Did… Gregory, did you just giggle?”
“Not everyone has the same fantasies as you, Bird.” Nick smacked the top of her helmet as he passed. “Now, Paddy, why a daisy-chain?”
Lestrade blew out a breath and nodded, his kind brown eyes full of approval. Sherlock hated how much he craved that warmth, that recognition of his skills. Brilliant, John would’ve said, and Sherlock would’ve locked that sound and that feeling away deep, somewhere safe. He hated that he needed it but more than that, he hated that it was Lestrade and not John providing it.
“The Queen’s Army doesn’t negotiate with terrorists.”
“Aye?”
“Ah.” The lieutenant colonel nodded once. “Clever. Carry on.”
“Get in the mastiff, you dumb paddy!”
“It damn well does if it knows what’s good for it.”
Another smattering of bullets peppered the side of the building near Gee’s shoulder, the front end of the mastiff, and dangerously close to the IED.
“So… You think she likes girls.”
“I’m glad you’re amused at my misery.”
Return fire started and they were stuck between the two sides. Gee ducked closer.
He hummed and crossed his arms, stretching his legs out in front of him. “Well. We’ve been busy.”
“Yes?” It was clipped and impatient.
“Sherlock.”
“And just how old do you think I am?” He saw the corner of her mouth twitch. “Don’t answer that. God only knows when my arthritis will act up and you’ll be left with an ugly scar.”
The smile was one that he knew looked false. It was a political, polite society expression that spoke more to duty than any overt emotion. “Perhaps you had not yet removed your earplugs.” Pipes creaked and Mycroft was glad his estimate of Sherlock’s sleep was on the far side of perfectly accurate.
Gee sucked in her lower lip. “I underestimated them. Only took two days.”
“No. No way!”
“Learned from the best.”
“Strong coffee and a cold shower.”
“On fire… No, wait,” John held up a finger. “We can come back to that. RPG?”
“You asked to be notified of any high clearance, classified requests.”
“My problem? My Problem!” Sherlock gestured at it. “Are you actually blind?! LOOK at it!”
“Lance Corporal,” Smith said sternly. “Though I’ve never expressly explained this, NOT letting the ATO get shot is whatever rule comes before the first rule!”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and John’s cheeks flushed.
“B-but I don’t wanna lose a tooth!” she whispered shakily. “It doesn’t feel right, Daddy! Put it back!”
“John,” Mrs. Hudson ventured. It was half a statement, half a command.
Rosie’s eyes, already wide, began to fill with silent tears.
The little girl’s eyes lit up.
“No Daddy, look! I’m flying!” A whoop was punctuated by creaks and thumps as Rosie jumped off the couch arm and back up again.
His words echoed for a moment but the silence afterward was even more unbearable.
It took a few minutes but soon they were settled on the couch across from each other, John in possession of the backpack and letters and Sherlock wielding the sewing kit his mother had given him before University. John thought it was adorable that Sherlock had kept it for so long and said so, and this time it was Sherlock’s turn to blush and busy himself with stitching.
“Obviously.”
“Is it your backpack again? Daddy can’t look right now, can you show me later?”
“They’re married.”
He smiled to himself. Ah, Rosie. As difficult as it had been single parenting after Mary’s passing, he had to admit his daughter remained the light of his life. Her naturally inquisitive nature and dramatic flair was a joy to behold, and though her energy had gotten her into a few scrapes she was sooner to fight the furniture than to cry over the injury. Even better, Sherlock tolerated her and John had his suspicions that she had done more to melt his heart than his friendship ever could have.
“Sherlock, no, you don’t understand! You’re taking this all wrong, stop it!”
“You just lost your first tooth, dearie.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Eat first.” was his only reply as he pocketed his phone and re-entered his bedroom which had been his hideout for the past few days. John doubted the man would emerge for the rest of the day, or not until he was gone at least.
“No, you--”
John captured his face in his hands.
“You love Rosie a lot, don’t you.”
“No way,” John stared him down incredulously. “You can sew?”
“I think you wanna kiss Sherlock--”
“He did! It’s Holmes, remember?” John held up the otter in his other hand hopefully.
“Mrs. Hudson and I are having a woodland tea party!” she exclaimed, holding up two stuffed animals above her head. “We’re going to use her special tea set and everything!” She dropped the animals into John’s lap and returned to gulping down her now more soggy breakfast cereal.
“Wrong. What will Mrs. Hudson do with you? We’re both drunk.”
John sniffled and moved his hands around Sherlock’s waist, hiding his face in the other’s coat.
Rosie paused.
“I am not taking you to the clinic today. Now, please, get off that couch and finish your breakfast.”
An evening talk and a happy ending.
“So they’re brothers?”
Stuttering, he noticed John’s unshed tears for the first time.
“You don’t know a lot of things about me.”
John coughed and arranged the stuffed animals on the table in front of Rosie.
“Why didn’t the hedgehog get a last name?” John asked, brows furrowing slightly as he held it up.
An bright red backpack lay between the two men, a ladybug keychain dangling from the zipper pull. It was clearly new, empty besides a child’s book and a little plastic bag. John dumped the bag on the table unceremoniously, five letters spilling out.
“Not unless you crack your head open falling off that couch there.”
Mrs. Hudson took the little girl's hand in hers.
Sherlock finally spoke, voice monotone and void of emotion.
John sucked in a breath.
John ran a hand down his face.
“Do you mind?” he whispered to Sherlock, who had a mouth full of pins.
“No, you forgot something!” she laughed back, mimicking the gesture.
"I suppose just this once."
Sherlock pulled away with a huff and fixed an unfocused stare past John’s head.
Okay, definitely less affectionately now.
“I’d hoped you’d come around about the recent fight but I clearly didn’t know I needed to hear all that as much as I clearly did.”
“This,” he said, deliberately swinging something over John’s hands.
“Mrs. Hudson said I needed to name my animals so I named them John and Sherlock Holmes.”
“You have to show me.”
“What’s wrong, Daddy?”
Three days he had spent at the office late into the night, each more frustrating than the last. Rosie was coming up on six years old now, well past time she should begin school like he had, and yet... nothing he’d found seemed quite adequate for his little girl. He had hoped he could walk her to the school near 221B Baker Street, but unless he was to rely on Sherlock's funds (perish the thought) the school was well out of their budget, both money and time-wise. Each place he had visited was worse than the last, each website harder to follow, and as much as he hated the thought it was beginning to look like he’d have to move out to the suburbs to find a school that would fit, at the least, the needs of both himself and his daughter.
“The game is on then?” he asked, looking out the window at the street below.
“Actually, I do.”
“No, you!” the two Watsons argued back and forth, making silly faces as they went.
There was blood on Rosie’s lip.
“Almost as much as I do you.”
Sherlock leaned his forehead against John’s and scoffed.
With a sigh John tapped his little black box and his sub's feet were together in an instant.
John gave the detective's cock a sharp smack with the crop. "Get out of your Mind Palace right now! I want you to experience everything I do to you."
"Your little break certainly made you more creative," John noted as he did as Greg suggested.
"Mycroft, its fine," the detective assured him.
Sherlock froze. “It’s only a legal thing, Finn. You’re our son now just as much as you will be once we’ve signed the adoption papers.”
“Yes, sir.”
Sherlock nodded dopily, “Yes, sir.”
That earned two quick smacks, one on each cheek. "Comparing me to a Holmes? You're arse is about to glow bright red."
“Hmm. Near enough. You did that on purpose, didn’t you?”
“No, sir.”
“What is that?” Sherlock sounded confused.
Irene had the ball stretcher on Sherlock before he could blink.
“Uncle Myc!”
. 11.87MB
He reset the timer and returned to the living room.
"Food? Boring." Sherlock tried for another kiss, but Mycroft dodged it.
“Look, it doesn’t matter!” Sherlock couldn’t understand why he suddenly didn’t want to talk to the older man, it wasn’t even the conversation that made him tense, it was just being here, in his comforting arms in general. “Victor would cane me severely and Wilkes would lock me in my bedroom for a week. After the normal punishment. There, discussion had and it is really not that big of a deal.”
Mycroft thought of arguing, but eventually averted his eyes.
Enjoying the texture, John ran his fingers through Greg's hair. It was so different to Sherlock's, a bit wiry and thick. "Too much responsibility sometimes, isn't there?"
Mycroft nodded, but he wasn't convinced. After the ten minutes had passed, Greg gave him a slight push towards the playroom door.
Sherlock paused, blinked dumbly before dropping to his knees as John wiggled out from beneath him and got to his feet.
“I didn’t know what to do, sir. I couldn’t crawl and keep it upright.”
“Right, seeing as you’re already on your knees, we will practice how your present position is.”
Sherlock closed his eyes and let John get on with it. He still had the posture collar around his neck, and his hands were still cuffed.
“Have you been thinking about what you’ve done?” John asked from behind the kneeling boy.
The detective glanced at his now-fiancé, John was right, the more Finn settled, the more likely he was to act up.
"Thank you, sir," he said, unprompted.
“You can’t just pretend this didn’t happen.”
The pair went a whole 10 minutes without anything going wrong, but that was when Sherlock’s next stage of rebellion kicked in.
"Excellent." John turned as Greg came back in the house, his arms fully loaded. "God, Greg, let me help with that." He rushed and took two bags from the Superintendent's hands.
"I didn't mean to blow anything up," the sub said sulkily.
Sherlock let heavy lids fall shut and focused on the breathing of his Dom. His current Dom, not his past ones,
When he eventually obeyed, John held out his hand. Confused, Sherlock didn’t take it. The Dom shook his head once. “Fine. Kneel.”
"Will you tell Mycroft?"
John slapped him. "Try that again," he ordered, slipping his fingers back into his boy's mouth.
“Seeing as it is your first day with me, you may put them back on.”
But Finn looked unsure right up until Sherlock appeared at the top of the stairs. Then he fought his way to freedom and scrambled up them. "I told them! I told them, Daddy!"
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock repeated. He didn’t want John to double it because he hadn’t replied.
"Something to say pet?" John asked, tugging the gag free.
"Well, she is being ridiculous," Sherlock muttered, but neither John nor Mrs. Hudson heard him.
Mycroft slid off his lap and did just that.
The blond leant back in his chair, leaving Sherlock thrusting into nothing as he removed his hand.
"Posture collar?" John asked from his knees.
"Comfy, Mycie?"
Sherlock looked up at him confused. He glanced at the table and saw the empty dishes.
“Sherlock!”
"John, please. You can't do this."
John smiled smugly and it wiped that smirk from his face. “I’m talking about Mycroft Holmes. His brother,” he added with a point. “If you’ve been spending time with the DI at the Yard then I'm sure you’ve heard of him. What he is… what he does to vermin that touches his baby brother.”
Slowly, Sherlock opened his mouth with his eyes downcast. John pushed a piece of pizza between his lips, the sub didn’t comment as he chewed and swallowed.
Before anyone realised what was going on, Finn had given John the slip from the gallery and charged into the room, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s legs.
“I know, sir, but…”
“And why is that bad?”
Mycroft sighed. "You would get just as much, if not more attention from John if you behaved. Not to mention you might enjoy it more."
"At least it wouldn't have been me getting dirty."
Mycroft shoved his hands under his bum to keep himself from removing the blindfold. The Superintendent noticed. "Problem, pet?"
Greg raised an eyebrow. "I think you should decide that."
Sherlock grunted in discomfort but didn't speak, just tried to look at his brother.
John laughed. "Of course you do."
In the kitchen, John had cooked breakfast with the help of his sub. Together, they had made enough for the four of them and were setting it out on the table.
“I don’t know.”
John disappeared out of the room and Greg shifted slightly, moving his hands round behind and gripped his left wrist with his right hand. He kept completely still when John came back into view. He immediately spotted his flaccid cock and closed his eyes, keeping his annoyance hidden.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “I’m sorry, sir,” he whispered. He didn’t know how he could go back to ‘that’ person when ‘that’ Sherlock upset John so much.
John had told George to phone ahead for his staff to prepare tea and a late lunch in the den for the both of them. He carried Sherlock through and placed him on the sofa. He'd expected a few days of them being away so he didn't have anything planned. It didn't take long to realise spontaneity was never a bad thing.
"Keep still, boy," he ordered, moving to fetch the strap.
"Alright you two. Get out," Greg ordered when he pulled the car up at their destination.
“W-What are you doing, sir?” Sherlock squeaked. He had flinched as the Dom slowly worked down his pants and applied cold gel to heated flesh. The hot and cold clashed together, but it felt good.
"Oh, dear." Mrs. Hudson took Finn's hand and tugged him towards the kitchen. "Sit down, John. Finn and I will finish cooking." She gave the little boy a wink and he climbed back on the stool.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock whispered, wanting nothing more than to cry. But John had been right earlier, his attitude had put his brother in Panic.
“Does he know where you live?”
Moriarty laughed. “Petulant as ever. You should show me some respect.”
Irene smiled, her submissive, Kate, stood behind her and slightly to the side, head low. The smile seemed somewhat dangerous though, "A case? A criminal case? You're supposed to be training him to become a polite submissive, not chase him around London."
"But-"
Greg just rolled his eyes at the doctor who appeared at the door.
“You'll be wearing just a shirt and trousers for her visit so finish up what you are doing and I'll take you to your room.” That was unexpected, he supposed he didn't want him naked in front of this Irene woman.
For some reason, the detective hated that. It felt so… demeaning. He was sure if it was anyone except the current people in the room, he would never allow it.
"It feels good, sir?" Sherlock asked.
At Sherlock’s nod, John took his hand again. “Come on, then.”
“Sherlock didn’t do that to him,” John felt the need to defend his sub as he quietly gathered up the case papers that were still strewn across the coffee table.
Sherlock pulled out of John's grip and stepped out into the street, getting close to it.
Sherlock had also noticed the Dom back in his full suit again, rather than the more relaxed attire he’d become accustomed to.
At that, he rolled his eyes. John could call him that, maybe Lestrade, but not even Mycroft could get away with it. Irene certainly hadn't earned the privilege.
“We fought, John!  I’ve called you stupid, and disappeared for days because I don’t know how to deal with my feelings,” he spat out the last word, but with less conviction that before. “It’s been eating away at me, seeing you so upset because of me.”
“You really think I’m a good dad?”
“Really?”
“Have fun with Sherlock!” she waved back.
“It was mine! I love you most in the world so I gave them your names.” She ran to his lap and pushed their noses together, making a kissing sound, then ran back.
“You worry she‘ll grow up to be like me.”
“She’s getting too big to share a bedroom with me, and you know how Baker Street is always falling apart at the seams with all sorts of people! I just know she’ll waltz into meetings covered in mud and scream when you’re trying to study or dip her fingers into your experiments and get hurt!“ John rushed on, trying to finish before Sherlock inevitably spoke.
Sherlock didn't object, but after reading about halfway through the book John's voice began to give out to the strain of the night’s adventures. In a moment, Sherlock set the backpack aside and took the book, turning so John could see the illustrations as he read. John scooted closer and wrapped his arms around Sherlock and it was nice, more than they’d ever admit. The book ended in what felt like seconds after that but neither of them moved away.
“l… it would be inappropriate.”
Sherlock nodded.
Rosie turned, still gripping her father tightly.
Her eyes flashed between the trio. John stuttered and stepped forward, wiping the blood with his thumb. Mrs. Hudson snorted and slapped his hands away.
Rosie gasped excitedly and ran around to the back of her chair to her backpack, which lay crooked and half-zipped on the floor. Upon it, the first four letters were sewn on tidily with a steady hand, but the final letter made John grimace at the crooked placement. It was clear he hadn’t known what he was doing, but he was not about to let an argument stop him from giving his daughter a gift, especially not one that was quickly so beloved to her. Rosie hardly went anywhere without it now.  Currently it was a home to some of her favorite stuffed animals,  at least until she had a proper use for it.
“Come jump with me, Sherlock!”
“Sherl--you made me mess--” John flicked the pencil across the table..
“I wanna see claw bugs! Please Sherlock, can you show me claw bugs?”
“Are you going to?”
After a few quiet moments spent puzzled together in the fading dusk, John broke away with a smile.
“I--What did I say wrong?” frantically his gaze skipped around their surroundings. “I didn’t mean t--”
"How about some ice cream to celebrate? Would you like that?"
“The phone call was from Lestrade.” The pair had barely disappeared down the stairs and Sherlock was close, very close behind John's ear. He tilted his neck at the sound and didn't bother to turn. Even though he couldn’t see Sherlock, he could feel the excitement beginning to roll through his partner as he pictured the case in his mind.
He trailed off as Sherlock knelt before the pair, transfixed. He extended his hand and gently, almost tenderly pushed stray locks off her face, then carefully wrapped under her torso and lifted her off of John. Rosie made a small sound and turned into Sherlock’s chest, clutching his shirt lightly and the look that flashed across his face was so intimate John felt like an intruder until Sherlock lifted his gaze and locked onto his.
“John, I’ve been meaning to apologize.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and began brushing down the other’s coat. John patted down the roughed up curls and pulled at the collar Sherlock had left askew. Sherlock’s hands paused at his elbows, and John slowed to a stop.
“She adores you. You’ve taught her so much, Sherlock, sometimes i forget she’s my daughter and not yours.
“I think he likes you, Daddy!”
“She is very bright,” Sherlock had murmured after she’d fallen asleep in John’s arms listening to him play violin. “I have no doubt her mind compares to mine at her age.” John ran his fingers through her blonde hair for a few moments before replying.
“Bugs don’t have claws, they have legs!” Rosie argued back.
“I just don’t think this is the place she‘ll be the best she can be!”
“Have I taught you about skull fractures yet?”
Mrs. Hudson looked up for confirmation, then nodded.
“Oh the places you’ll go!” read John, holding up the forgotten storybook like a librarian.
“Rosie, no. For the last time, no, I do not want to kiss Sherlock Holmes.”
“And what about me is so wrong? What about our home is so terrible you have to leave?”
“John, what is this?” Sherlock’s voice floated into the kitchen where John sat scribbling notes. John hummed.
“Tipsy,” John corrected stoutly. “By the time we’re home she’ll never know.”
Thanks for reading ! Sorry the update took forever and ever, I had it saved on my laptop and just... forgot. Ah, life. Let me know if I missed any grammar/spelling errors : )
After a few minutes, it was Mrs. Hudson who spoke first.
“It’s two in the morning.”
Reluctantly, he heads into the parlour, ducking into the stairwell and back in again to avoid the mess in the kitchen.
"If you touch him again," He snarled. "Rest assured I will—"
John nodded. “I know that. I feel the same way.”
John is silent for a moment before he speaks quietly.
"Because I love you." He said it so simply, so matter-of-factly, as if it was common knowledge. "And not in the way that I love Mary. Not in the way that I love anyone else."
“So,” John says, crossing his arms as he leans back in his chair, “Start talking.”
"I know," John agreed. "I'm sorry to keep bringing it up."
“Are you still mad about Paris?” Harry asked incredulously. “Still? John, are you still mad?”
"What praise." John huffed, rolling his eyes. "If you don't mind, try to say something nice on my epitaph to memorialize my mediocre mind."
"I don't trust him with you." Lestrade says solemnly, his eyes grim. "The box is all you get. It's one way blind. He won't know you're there."
“He won’t tell me.”
"No thank you. I don't intend on staying long." Mycroft responds, his careful eyes following the man now straining to reach the top shelf of the cupboard. He is so
Sherlock was alive.
It's quiet outside, and the lake is shimmering and still with the lateness of the hour. Slowly scanning his surroundings, he makes his way around his house.
. You not only murdered innocents, you murdered a pure soul. No one will have you back now. Their blood is on your hands."
"I…thought I could be of some assistance."
Sherlock exhaled and shut his eyes.
"If it alleviates your suffering, you may care to know that I fared little better." Sherlock sniffed. "I lived my life before you and I lived it with you and I lived it after you, and only one of those periods was of any value to me."
He has his hand on the doorknob when he hears John call out that the tea is ready.
"Yes, I called him before you arrived because I was worried. It was the first time we had talked in nearly two years, since I called him in Shanghai for clean food. I asked him if he knew where you were, he said he didn't, and I told him to keep you in Bruges if he could, so you wouldn't run into any trouble. I called him out of a blind despondency to ask that he keep you secure, and he took that to mean that as long as you didn't physically leave Bruges then anything could happen to you inside and he wouldn't stop it."
Felix shrugged. “So, we will be armed then. One man against five? I wouldn’t bet on those odds.”
A broken syringe is lying in the rubbish bin.
He would have been worried if John had not been smiling, genuinely smiling.
Although the well had been closed,  some of the water still remained puddled, brackish and old. It was damp, widening into what had once been a small aquifer, the circumference wide enough for the two of them to stand side by side, giving them the advantage.
"Haven't you noticed my silences? My surrenders to the pyre as I toss bits of myself in? Haven't you noticed The Emptiness, Sherlock?"
"Rachel Wilson." The teacher glances up, repeating once more: "Rachel Wilson?"
He stops as twin gunshots echo nearby, cracking through the night’s quiet like lightning. He and Mikheia stare towards the barn, where the shots sounded.
He could feel John roll his eyes.
"You heard me." Sherlock said calmly. It was not a question because he didn't need to ask.
John shuts his eyes.
“Was he lying?” Sherlock breathes.
“Sherlock, why the bloody hell is there an octopus in the meat drawer, I—wait, what was that—SHERLOCK! YOU—OH MY GOD YOU ABSOLUTE WANKER YOU STOLE AN OCTOPUS FROM THE AQUARIUM, DIDN’T YOU? JESUS, what the fuck is wrong—OH MY GOD IT’S STILL FUCKING ALIVE JESUS FUCKING CHRIST—listen you two work at the aquarium right, you deal with…this—SHERLOCK, this is worse than the head cheese in the sink, honestly—do you hear me, this is WORSE, you absolute bastard—you’ve put me off coffee and now I can’t eat sushi ever again, what’s fucking next you posh—”
—you were saying?"
, was beautiful. The stars-behind-your-eyes, wipe-all-conscious-thought-from-your head kind of beautiful, like looking into the night sky and trying to comprehend your own mortality and insignificance. Except John felt quite significant at the moment.
Sherlock watches him go, a shadow in the dawn’s light, and wonders if he should be worried with Mycroft’s words. If he should look closer.
The sound of a crazed violin rent the air through the open door as they slowly came up the driveway. All of the lights in the cabin had been turned on.
Toying with her pencil, Molly glances back, to the corner where Will sits. Their eyes meet and together they look down at the empty desk.
The suite is silent. Traffic sounds through an open window somewhere.
"You think whoever killed her was an alchemist?" John asks, leaning on the other side of the table.
John had mourned for it already, cried alone in the back of an alley. Sherlock now cried in his arms.
It's a quiet breaking, a quiet crack widening on an atom, splitting it further.
“It’s there.” He said, pointing up, tracing a constellation. “Right in the middle of Cancer. Twice the size of Earth, 40 lightyears away.”
"Do you know why?"
Irene was waiting for them at the foot of the stairs, Orso standing obediently behind her.
“I’m not going to die, Sherlock.”
“What was the time right for?” John asked, and his mate shook his head. “Tell me.” He insisted, his years from the military cutting through in the command.
"No, I don't think so." He turned to the boy. He wanted to leave him with something, to know this encounter hadn't been imagined. Something to tell others. Maybe John would be a schoolyard legend. That'd be interesting. "Mikheia, my name is John. It was lovely to meet you, and thanks for helping me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm getting the hell out of here and changing these trousers."
"Good." Moran wheezed into the ripped bag of flour. "Very good, Doctor Watson."
.” She corrected, shooting John a look one would reserve for their father. She stepped forward, taking Billy’s hand in hers, bare.
Sherlock didn't know who he'd been begging to, whom he'd prostrated himself before to spare
“Mycroft hasn’t been known for his loyalty to me with matters that concern Moriarty.”
They both turned, one in inane curiosity and the other in reflex to the name.
"See, John?
He hadn't meant to be a hero that day either, but as John had sponged some genius off of Sherlock in their time together, so had Sherlock absorbed John's sense of goodness, if only a miniscule amount.
"Anyways, John, what was so important that you had to rush into the hall and hug me like I was the messiah come to earth?"
"John, John, let me help you, listen to me—" Sherlock pleads, finding it hard to manage all of this mess in so little space. "John,
As soon as the words are out, Sherlock wishes he could take them back, shove them deep down so John could never hear them again.
John raises an eyebrow.
Time seems to drain into one gathered knot, exisiting in this one moment of realization. Everything must have led up to this. He should have known…should have realized.
"How are you feeling?"
"Antique gunpowder, if the scent was unmistakably the kind your grandfather used, would have contained cordite. Cordite is a smokeless propellant used in World War I and II era weapons, although it has been since discontinued due to better technological advances. If it is ingested, it gives off a slight exhilaration, like you were halfway to intoxication. If taken in large quantities it produces a state of ecstasy and makes the victim see visions before instilling a raging fever, which soldiers used to get sick leave." Sherlock paused, his feet rooting in place. "Did you see anything odd?"
"John—"
If he was feeling like being particularly honest with himself, he could admit that it was why he'd accepted the job in the first place. The chance to taste war again, so bitter and salty yet so virile and alive as he licked his lips before pulling the trigger that effectively ended someone else's life and gave him a paycheck. It was never for the money though. Just the blood. Just the feeling that he was doing something useful again. The feeling that he alone (for the moment anyways) was purging the world of bad, was saving someone else's life who he'd most likely never meet, never shake their hand, lean in and say
But the girl sinks back into the ether she surfaced from, as quickly as she came.
There'd been no clean exit wound. Of course not, not at that distance. He was used to quiet entry, soft exit, at distances where you couldn't see the brain gush out of the hole you created, where you weren't close enough to distinguish blood and brain from bits of skull.
The look Sherlock gave him was more than enough proof that yes, he did think that.
He took one last, longing look at the rising sun, and turned away, following John to their bedroom.
Near the end, after Sherlock had managed to kiss every inch of John's body into a humming arousal, after he had clambered once more in John's lap and let John open him up, after they both had groaned and shared a messy kiss between them as John pushed up and in, they managed to make so much noise that the poor woman downstairs could hear them, although neither knew it.
John looked back up to Hanne, who had her hands up.
"I think it suits you well, you know." Sherlock said, watching John struggle and feeling his chest grow cold from John's brief absence.
"And so you did."
“I’d love that. Has Sherlock woken up? How is he—”
“You were in love with her. You were seeing her secretly, and no one else at school or her friends knew about it. She was the homecoming queen, she was dating the captain of the football team…how long did you think you could keep this relationship a secret?”
Sherlock returns his smile. Analysis: blunder. Pawn: active.
“She has a point, Petyr.” Mycroft says after a moment of silence. “He isn’t very indistinguishable. Quite
He doesn’t feel it when it happens. The spear had passed straight through him, clipping his wing and sending him dropping like dead weight to the ground. A clean strike; a mercy. As he falls, he wants to scream at the unfairness of it all. He was supposed to have another day with Sherlock. He was supposed to pick him up from the rubble of that flat and take him home, clean his wounds, make him smile.
“Yes.” Came the small voice, assertive and sure. “Yes, of course it’s worth it. This, us, is worth it. Always.”
The cab speeds off down the street as soon as they pay their fare, tyres screeching as it merges with the empty night that engulfs it.
John shut his eyes tightly and sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
John stares at him. His eyes are blue, the colour of the high-salinity Italian seas that Sherlock's only seen in pictures but harbours a childhood envy of.
understand?”
“What was his name?”
“No,” John sighs, pinching his nose, “I—the look on your face, in Stockholm. When you saw me. It was so clear that I wasn’t in any plan you’d had until then. I wasn’t supposed to be there, and, to me, neither were you. We were supposed to be together, in London, living out our lives and all that comes with sharing a flat with you. I was supposed to be convincing you to buy the milk or label your experiments or running after criminals with you, not punching you so hard you fainted.”
"If you would be so cold as to risk the life of your family, then perhaps you belong on my side."
"I'm a big boy, Sherlock." John said with a smile. "And I've got a medical degree, so it's not like I can't handle whatever wounds I get."
"Prurience." Sherlock shrugged.
"Sherlock Holmes." John repeats. His smile radiates something Sherlock can't name. "I've been waiting for you for a long time. I think we need to go somewhere less wet and well lit."
"Huh." Harry scratches her head. "I really thought that would work. Guess I can't do that."
“Don’t call him that.” Sherlock said lowly.
Later that night, they loaded him and Murray into the back of a commandeered Soviet truck, out of date and falling apart, and dropped them in the middle of the desert, with no food, no water, no supplies of any kind. Murray told him that he’d stripped them of their undershirts, managed to flag down a passing Blackhawk sometime towards dawn.
She bustles around the room for a moment before disappearing back downstairs, saying her offer of tea still stands and to get it before its cold. At the bottom of the stairs she yells up something about being careful when going into John's room, but he doesn't hear her.
“What did he say to you? Tell me everything.”
“What are you doing here?” He spit. “What is she doing here?” He asked John, who still hadn’t turned to look at him.
His mind, unoccupied when presented with such a tedious task, wanders.
A moment of silence settled between them. People laughed below as they stumbled home, stumbled into one another, stumbled towards their beds, their desires, their distractions from the cold fact of mortality.
“Stop being a deliberately ignorant, self-righteous
Quietly, John sidles up to him, case file open in his hands.
more than anything. Of all the times in his life that he could have died, he didn’t. Gunshot wounds, red-hot pokers, explosions, fires, a hail of bullets—this boy was a marvel. His coterie of injuries would soon rival John’s, and Sherlock’s, if he made it out of this intact.
Sherlock had never played nurse before, but he knew instinctually what to do. Taking an empty pewter canteen with him, he stalked the streets, quickly finding and baiting a young girl into a dark alley. He tasted her blood to be sure first, and she was clean, so he drank from her, filling the bottle as necessary and dropping her off, still alive, to be found in one of the pedestrian-heavy paths.
." He snarls before storming past Mycroft and slamming his bedroom door.
I can hear his smile through the darkness.
Mikheia had started a fire, if only out of habit. Watching the flames crackle that great, ornate marble fireplace reminded him of the days when the electricity bills couldn't be paid and his mother dragged out an old metal trashcan and set to work warming her children. He had worked harder, dishonestly and honestly, so he would never hear her scrape that tin over the floor again.
"Sherlock, we don't have to—I mean, if you're not ready—"
--//--
"Yes, you do. You do many things for many reasons; you are not a man who does anything because he simply doesn't know better. Why?"
Sherlock blinked, staring at the worn pages of John’s journal, but not reading, not really seeing. He'd already read it all, stared at the words as if John's secrets would peek out from behind the ink.
A dark figure, a dweller on the threshold.
Sherlock teaches John how to make crêpes that night, since basic ingredients are all he has in his cabinets and his mother though her sons deserved at least an amateur knowledge of French cooking.
He stares out into the maze of brick and soot that smears London's face before turning to Lestrade.
“Is there a button I can press or…” Sherlock tries to joke, but stops at John’s face. He’s in no mood. “Right, my apologies.”
"Long time, no…see." Moriarty says slowly and laughs. "Did you miss me, Sherlock?"
“Is it my turn to speak?”
She clips the tag off his toe and tosses it in the rubbish bin. She supposes the mortician will wonder why there’s a blank one in the garbage, but they probably won’t think too hard on it.
“Don’t you
He stared back down at the note.
They lay together, Sherlock's head tucked under John's, John's hand still tangling itself in Sherlock's hair like he couldn't bring himself to leave it.
“Right. Usually they’re an object close to the caster, something important, something they always have on them…do you remember anything Azazel had?” She asks as she rolls her neck, her gaze wandering around the room.
“Maybe if we had dinner, I could get to know you better.”
love with you.”
“Tell our dear Sherlock I say hello.” Moriarty smiled. “You’ll see me again.” He said, blowing a kiss at him. “Until then, Johnny.”
He knew he was behaving too rashly, he knew that something so fresh shouldn't be spoiled so fast, but he couldn't stop the shadows from rising where they lay. He felt dazed, stunned, like everything around him was in motion and blurred yet he remained still among it all.
"Why doesn't it? Why
To come back"
"At least there's no sugar in it this time." John admitted before eyeing his computer. "You could have asked to borrow that you know—"
“Here,” she said, coming back in. “It’s O. But listen, if you’re not busy, I—”
He wants this moment to last. Always.
"We told them who you were, John."
"Well, she's not subtle is she?" John cracked, taking the doctor's mask and tying it around the back of his head.
When would John
Surrounded by all of John Watson's belongings, of all the things that were once his and never will be again, Sherlock takes in a deep shaking breath.
Sherlock's chair topples back as he stands and, for a moment, he looks every bit as mad as other people reported him to be.
The weather comes on. Cloudy, with rain. How surprising, in London, in the springtime. Truly shocking.
“He did call, good deduction there, because he found out we were attacked last night and he was worried. He’s not as uncaring as you think, you know. And…well, we have a bigger problem.”
"You were too, Molly." He smiles, laying a hand over hers. For a moment it is only the two of them and though there once was three, they are comforted in the fact that at least they remained.
“This is why you don’t want us to move away, isn’t it.”
“Coooool!” John helped the distracted child reach the soap and washed their hands together, likely missing spots but nevertheless, it was an improvement. He reached for a towel and Rosie wriggled out of his grip, running with dripping hands to Sherlock and wiping them on his pants.
“Rosie, dear, I know this is something new and scary, but today’s a very special day!"
“Listen, Sherlock.” his voice broke and he stroked Sherlock’s cheeks with his thumbs.
“That’s quite something, coming from you.”
“Good morning!”
“You forgot something…” he wiggled his fingers up by her face.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Rosie, are you doing anything with Mrs. Hudson today?” he asked wearily before she grabbed her spoon off the milk-splattered table. “Anything fun?”
“I understand, John. You’re better without me.”
“Honey, Sherlock can’t come play with you right now. Can you please settle down? You don’t want to lose a tooth again, now do you?”
Okay, the blush was certainly reaching more than just the ears now. John tried to cover it but it was no use.
“But Daddy, I--”
The poor man looked less than enthusiastic upon his emergence into the kitchen and the chaos within. John doubted either of them had gotten enough sleep the past few nights.
“I say things I didn’t mean when..” he coughed. “my feelings take over. I want you to know that you are a good person, the best one I’ve ever known, and a great dad. And I want you to make the best decisions for you and for Rosie, not for me. I love her so much, and I--I--”
“Do  you and Sherlock kiss?”
John almost laughed at the absurdity.
John aimed a death glare at Sherlock, who forcefully put the cup in the sink and crossed his arms.
With a start, their eyes met and Sherlock tightened his grip.
“Seriously, how did I not know this?”
"And use your umbrella?"
John scoffed and ruffled her hair affectionately.
“Sherlock is my friend. You don’t kiss your friends.”
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed.
Sherlock took a few moments laughing into his coat collar before answering.
He looked up, arms still clung around Sherlock’s waist.
It felt like the air left the room all at once.
“Rosie,” he breathed. Sherlock remained still and watched John’s hands arranging the letters on the front of the bag.
The walk after dinner passed by quickly, spent hand-in-hand. Conversation was natural as the falling of the sun and unpredictable as the night,  John telling elaborate stories from his past, Sherlock theorizing about what he had most recently created in the lab, John jumping on Sherlock’s back to ruffle the dark curls he‘d always wanted to touch, Sherlock spinning in circles until they were both dizzy and giggling like schoolchildren. They stopped a few streets away from Baker Street to bring their breathing back to normal.
Sherlock unexpectedly appears looking handsome and acting a bit odder than usual. How do we reckon a trip to Angelo's restaurant will go?
“Ooh, don’t let him scare you!” she smiled, patting her arm.
“ARGHH, up you go, little bug!” John grabbed Rosie under the arms and carried her to the sink. “Time to wash your claws!”
The collective gasp of delight went unnoticed as Rosie began to spin, puffing out her brown corduroy dress and flapping her pink patterned sleeves. John swept her into his arms before she collided with the counter and tossed her on the couch, their laughter mixing with a small oof as her backside hit the cushions. With a command of “Again!” they spun around each other, two laughing stars in their own galaxy until their knees went weak and they fell to the floor, rumpled and undignified, only to begin a tickle fight. Mrs. Hudson chuckled.
“Oh, it’s not a bad thing! You were the one that convinced me to keep her home another year, anyway. Mrs. Hudson tells me that when we‘re gone, Rosie practically won’t stop making up stories about our adventures, and her love of insects is unparalleled, except maybe by yours...”
“My teeth are fine! You told me not to be scared if I lose any more!”
“I have a loose tooth!” Rosie bubbled. “And it’s raining, Mrs. Hudson! And look!”
“I spent this evening trying to forget all the bad that has happened these past few years,” he whispered.
“Rosie,” John warned. In an instant she was sat at the table, shoveling in cereal at the fastest speed her body would allow. Milk splashed over the sides of the bowl and onto her hands, which had been left unwashed. John poked her cheek, interrupting the food frenzy.
Sherlock rose gracefully and walked to the door, then turned, face still blank.
“I don’t reckon either of us blokes know how to sew…” John chuckled, rubbing his face with his hand.
“There are many bugs with claws, they just are not native to London,” Sherlock leaned against the counter.
“Ok, what’re you on about?”
“Auntie Hudson!” a flash of blonde pigtails launched itself across the room into the landlady, who gracefully handed the teapot to John and returned the embrace. Sherlock nodded his thanks from the counter where he’d been sat, reading.
A soft gasp filled the space between them before John pulled Sherlock’s face down to meet his.
