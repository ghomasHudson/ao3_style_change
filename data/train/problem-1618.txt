John nodded and swallowed. He stared at the coffee table as if his gaze could bore a hole through it. “I’d like to tell you about my childhood. Another time.”
She was just a mess of heaving sobs now and Sherlock, grabbing a firm hold of her shoulders, swivelled her around to look at him.
"ATLAS?" John asked coming into the kitchen the next morning to see Atlas alone at the breakfast bar. It was early, much earlier than normal for John to get up but Atlas didn't think about this as she deduced him. When she was finished she slipped off the high chair and walked over, wrapping her arms around his waist.
"I'll be off then." Mycroft said as he got up from the table to leave. He gave Sherlock a pointed look before nodding at John.
"Now, I have to get off to the surgery." John laughed, kissing Sherlock again. Atlas and Rosie came back in, John hugging and kissing both of them on the cheeks. Before doing the same to Mrs Hudson who gave a laugh.
"And so unfortunately, people didn't really like your mother." John said before realising that saying to a five year old that her mother was not liked by people. "We had you, but you won't remember her. You were too little." John paused. "I wish you could have met her."
"I do," Atlas said quietly before she wrapped her arms around his waist and lay there. "I love you."
"Papa! Papa! Hurry up!" Rosie shouted as John walked faster, Atlas and Sammy trailing behind. She was jumping and pointing at the buildings.
"She was going to get up and move around a bit at lunch. But..." Sherlock began but then stopped with a furrowed brow.
"I have something to show you." Sherlock smiled as he went up a set of stairs that creeped up the side of a wall. It was now Atlas noted the height of the ceiling in this section and it was now that she noted the balcony. Leading her up he revealed an empty balcony and landing. She looked around waiting to see what he would see, before looking over the banister.
"Hello. Hello." Wanda said as she hustled down the path in the direction of Sherlock. She cupped her sons face as he tried to push her hands away, but she wouldn't take it. "Oh Sherlock you look tired."
"WE can totally cook." Atlas imitated smirking as she looked at her dads. "Not like I cook most evenings."
"Okay." Atlas said, coming around persuaded. Looking around them she felt uneasy and that bubbling came back in her stomach. Her papa was over with Jo and Harry looking at houses and Rosie had gone to spend the day with Molly and Andrew. Atlas, despite knowing she had to make the memorial, just wanted to go home. "Uhhh, I'm sorry guys, but I think I'm gonna cop out."
"Motive." Sherlock corrected as she pulled away and he put his large hands either side of her face. Holding it gently.
"Do you have a Tesco club card?" The man at the checkout asked before John produced it on the car keys. "That'll be £156.78 please." The man said before John forwned. Tesco was forever an expensive shop. John put his card and frowned as it didn't take it. "Give it a wee wipe." The man at the checkout smiled. John did so before pushing it in, only for his card to be declined again.
"And I never thought you didn't have a heart." John said in return before Eurus broke them up with a snort and started looking for weaknesses that might go when the tank was full of water, and that was risky in itself.
"Shall we play Slow Seasons?" Atlas asked referencing the duet they had just finished the other day. She looked at her dad expectantly as she awaited an answer, however, he nodded giving her the conclusion.
"My partner, he doesn't...he doesn't really know how to be around people. It's just something he struggles with." John smiled, taking a seat on the bench near her.
Back in the present, John thought of what it would have been like now. If only then he could've kissed him awake and his daughter. How wonderful would the world have been? How perfect?
Stepping forward, they were welcomed in by a very drunk posh boy who beckoned them in. The stench of sweaty bodies hit Atlas first along with the smell of sick. Then the DJ must have started because the whole house began to shake under the weight of the music.
"Of course I bloody do, I don't think I deleted the cache." Atlas sighed before he put his hands either side of her face and wiped away invisible tears with his thumbs. It was his turn to give a sad sigh.
"Your aunt and uncle on your mothers side." Sherlock said before he reached into his pocket and pulled out a bag of ashes. Atlas inaudibly gasped.
IN the distance she could see his black coat, hunched over on a bench in thought. The frosty ground crunched beneath her feet as she made her approach carefully. Tentiavely she approached the bench, Sherlock could sometimes be touchy around periods of festivity.
"I'm not." Atlas replied as she admitted what she had been thinking. "I'm really..." Deep breath in. "Really not." Sherlock drew her into his arms and held her close. Tears fell down her face as she was held by the man she was proud to call her father.
“How interesting!” Her face lit up with a dazzling, white smile. The kind of smile that denoted interest. She could very well be his for the taking.
Sherlock walks to the center of the lounge. Overhead, weight shifts, a moan ripples through the floorboards.
“I haven’t...dated anyone since. There have been fleeting liaisons here and there. Attempts to feel normal. To feel close to someone.”
Victor. That man exuded carnal energy that suggested he was familiar with Sherlock in a way John would rather not think about.
He pressed another kiss to the top of Rosie’s head, and walked down the hallway to his home office to avoid the sudden, stifling air of the kitchen.
John sucked in the flesh of one cheek as he ripped his eyes away. “Well, it’s all fine.” Knowing Sherlock would remember that first night they ate together.
It was nice to share this. And, it felt like maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t as big a loser. Did he seem like a loser to these guys? He did the occasional Grindr hookup, but when they talked about clubbing and dating and random meetups, John had little to contribute.
“John, this has been a pleasure.” Mirai Chowdhury gave a firm handshake. She didn’t seem the type to smile easily. She was direct. Assertive. Wasn’t going to blow smoke up his ass, and John appreciated that. With a white coat over her business suit, sharp eyes, and rigid posture, she exuded authority, and somewhere deep in the marrow of his bones, he found comfort in it.
Fortunately, Doctor Chowdhury broke in and tugged him away from the group, saying, “Ah, another donor is right over there. I’ll introduce you.” John followed her with all the obedience of a dog, feeling like a child’s project for show-and-tell.
“I don’t think you’re a coward. After all, look at you now. You’ve accepted a public facing job. You’ve come back to Connecticut where the crimes occurred. That’s not what a coward does.”
Thoughts of William floated across his mind again and again like dust motes hanging in a ray of sun. On the drive home, John sank into an audiobook, but he found he’d lost the plot. Instead of following the story line, he replayed the previous night’s scene in his head. William’s booming voice, his exaggerated antics that swiped the unctuous smirk from Peter Lysenko’s face and replaced it with a rictus of flummoxed horror. It made John smile more than once to think of it.
“Howdy, John!” Bonnie Wooster called out to him. She was one of the friendly ones. The counter hid most of her bulk, so she appeared comically as a round, bespectacled face floating above the flat slab of grey formica countertop. It didn’t help that Bonnie reached barely five feet in height, and that John himself could only just claim 5’6”. She hefted herself into the chair and waved him over, grinning. He suspected she knew who he really was, though she’d never had an unkind word to say to him.
“After your grandfather died, the doll spoke to your grandmother. I don’t know what the doll said. But your grandmother told Harry and your mother that if she hid the doll away, she didn’t hear her as well.” Sherlock could well imagine it. The woman, alone in her home, whispers at the edges and in shadows, a presence lurking in the periphery of her life. Did she try to get out of the house as often as possible? Did she invite people in so she could take her focus from the whispers and instead to the conversation of the living? The human? Or did she spend her days pacing, pulling her hair, perhaps, shouting at nothing -
No one can be this good. It can’t be a con. And how would he have moved those things in the flat - moved the doll - when no one else was there? Sherlock was the only one home and
“And then quarantine. I realized that we were living like roommates. Not like - not like you and me roommates. But, like regular roommates who happened to share the same bed. It was stupid, really, now that I look back on it. She was never Mary Morstan - I still don’t know her real name. She never shared anything about her old life, even though I shared about mine.”
When I woke up this morning to comments of agony, I couldn't leave you all hanging like that. So here's this chapter a bit earlier than I intended. Hope it helps. <3
“Victor Trevor.” They shook hands. Victor Trevor had a firm grip with a large hand that engulfed John’s, and his voice was like liquid smoke moving through the air. John kept his chin tilted and his shoulders back as he assessed the man.
“Yeah. She figured it out. It led to a whole other round of talks about how we had to fix things, how we were going to make it right. She took a job as a part-time receptionist - and god, that must have been killing her. Still killing her. But, I couldn’t bring myself to care, really. We divided our time with Rosie, though she had the lion’s share. I think as a way to do penance, really, so I could go on cases with you. It wasn’t a happy existence, and it wasn’t fair to either of us.”
"No. She's a brilliant girl and she loves you John. The way she looks at you and the way you look at her. What about Rosie?" Jo asked.
"Looks like you may have broken that arm of yours." John said, only causing Rosie to wail some more and order Sherlock to get some tissues to wipe at the blood above her brow. "Atlas? What happened?" He asked the girl still scribbling on the sheet music.
"Have you checked with Mr Fraggerty?" Sammy asked her, she shook her head. "Right. We'll go once I meet Xerxes." He began to walk away before he looked back to John and Sherlock. "Its not her fault!"
"Because you look pale and it's turning cold," Sherlock said as she hopped in, next to the dog and leaned against him.
"Apart from a mortgage that we will have to pay off monthly." Sherlock said looking at John before they both huffed out a laugh. "And I bought it. If you need proof of the money and the saving accounts and stuff I can ask Mycroft-"
"I don't think so." John sighed, scratching his eyebrow before Wanda looked at him with a furrowed brow. "Atlas has a migraine, the end of it now. She was sick last night and Sherlock being the person he is hasn't moved from the chair in her bedroom."
"I think we need to see a doctor Sherlock." John said. "About Rosie's problem with being mute. I'm worried it's -"
"Atlas." The teacher warned before shooting her a look. Atlas did not make eye contact with John. She looked everywhere but at him as he started up the slides.
"No. I chose Ida." Sherlock said as he continued what he was doing, ignoring John's slight snigger of laughter. That earned him a whack off of Mrs Hudson as she resumed her standing position next to where John was sitting in his chair.
So as consequence of much expected delays the unit of four left at approximately 9am with the ambition of reaching Timothy and Wanda's for 12. Sherlock had insisted on using a map so he could plot the best route despite John's arguement that a sat nav or google maps would be much more efficient. The pair, from Atlas' observation, often argued like a married couple and often loved each other like a married couple. Throughout her time staying with them she would drop hints that they were
"Okay, okay." John said trying to reassure her as her breaths began to get quicker and shorter as she began to panic.
"Did it go well? Whatever you were doing?" John asked, plonking into the chair opposite Sherlock. He looked over to where Atlas slept and gave a warm smile.
"Just wondered if you liked the nickname." She smiled as she crouched to look at a bug. The dog's head reared in interest and he came trotting over to her. Atlas had to hold him back from eating the ladybug that Rosie was looking at. Swiftly, Atlas threw a stick for him to chase so that she could take a swift photo of Rosie squatting down at a bug. She got a total of nine that she placed in the folder she had named 'Rosie'.
"Yes, he has Rosie who I think, oh, she must be about five and then Sammy and Atlas. Now Sammy is maybe, seventeen I think and then Atlas is sixteen. She's younger than you Lily but older than Wendy," Damien explained. "And you will be nice to them. Atlas is actually quite poorly and both of them have been through hell."
"A bumblybee." Rosie exclaimed, excited by the little bug. Bee's were her favourite animal and always had been - thought everyone was certain that if dinosaurs hadn't gone extinct, a dinosaur would have been the favourite.
"She's Atlas." Sherlock said causing Sammy to laugh and John to do the same. "Are you worried about her?"
"You want to be a musician when your older, sweetheart. You need a cello." John smiled before rubbing her hand. "When your better we'll go to
"Tranqs." Eurus replied before looking at his neck, putting a hand to it and removing a snapped piece of needle. "That's how fat your neck is." Mycroft shot her a look before they both glanced over the small grey concrete room. This was not good.
"We know." Sherlock said before transferring Rosie over to John. "How's about we stay here tonight? Me and Atlas picked up stuff, so the house is stocked. And we have towels in. We can finish moving tommorow morning." Sherlock smiled, looking over to John.
Timothy and Wanda were already making their way down the pathway of the house when the group were emptying their car. They'd met Rosie countless times, the last time they saw her Wanda read her a lengthy book about the Pacific and pirates. However, Atlas remembered her falling asleep not long into it. Despite most four year olds being excitable, Rosie was partial to a nap even yet and Atlas sympathized with her. She often took afternoon naps aswell.
shape and he nodded once. "They're coming on Saturday so they might look in but I've made plans on Sunday to go out to lunch with them. Your pa has said that from now on, Sunday's have to remain clear so they can be
"All over," Atlas whispered in return before sitting up and looking at him. "Don't make that face, I'll be fine."
"HELLO John dear." Wanda said as she fussed him the next afternoon. The rest of the night had gone fine, Atlas had not thrown up anymore and he'd slept relatively OK. That was completely different to that of his partner who had only come out the room for coffee and toast at lunchtime - despite his own and Atlas' insistence that she was perfectly fine. Infact the migraine was lifting already, and she was starting to feel a lot better.
"They're lovely people," Atlas smiled. "And they make the best pizza. Gordon's dad was Italian and Beattie moved here from Italy when she was three after her parents emigrated from here to there. That's why they have a pizza place."
"You guys and Eurus are the only people who're ever going to understand," She mumbled as Sherlock rubbed her back. "I love you Myc."
"I know," John said quietly. "Oh god, Sherlock, I know." He kissed him then, it was, in all senses of the term, gross, (mucus and tears) but still, it was nice.
"Out." Atlas said quietly, dropping the spoon in the bowl regretfully. She'd thought there was more, she was sure. "Have you-"
"Your mother." John said, swallowing his anger to be dealt with later this evening when Sherlock got home. "Your mother, she had to travel the world and no-one really knew that she was doing it."
"I thought you said caring was weak. A disadvantage." Sherlock spat as he turned his head further away.
Now, he just nodded quietly to John, his eyes downcast. He reached out a hand to Rosie who took it as they followed Sammy out.
John came in ten minutes later, just as Atlas began to really struggle to keep her eyes open. Her head was still tucked next to Sherlock's chin and she gave a bright yet sad smile.
"Atlas," Sammy said stopping where they were going and pulling her to face them. "Just breathe. Don't worry about that. I'll be here and dad and papa and Rosie and Jeff and Redbeard and you know that Jo and Harry would defend you too."
"That's my pa." Atlas whispered in her ear, Aba's eyes going wide before she sat back in her seat. Exchanging a look with Sammy as the game began.
"He spoke about me and you." Atlas said jumping up onto the kitchen counter and looking at John. "I believe it was the banned word."
"Because, Rosie, it doesn't matter that some of us share blood and others don't and because you've made someone quite upset," John said grasping Atlas' hand as the girl blinked back tears.
"I got flour in my hair." Atlas said looking down at the tips of her dark curly bob. She was standing beside John as he cut up some red onion.
Another doctor, a more senior member, came into the room at that moment. "We need to run tests, ask you questions, your father needs to leave the room."
John’s ears burned. Woody had an impressive package. John had seen plenty of his pics. He’d sent Woody a few, too—no faces for him. Woody didn’t care, and showed it all, face and dick. He was a handsome bastard. Another reason John had almost asked to meet him. But those had been in desperate moments, after a bit of lonely drinking.
William. And goddamn, did the man look fine in a suit. The fabric wrapped and sloped around the hills and dells of William’s body like a second skin. John recalled a tall, slender physique with large hands and a well-proportioned ass, but this tailored suit exhibited a clear outline of an athletic build with a lickable, V-cut waistline.
“That’s—good.” William’s smile seemed pasted on now. His eyes were overly bright as he met John’s gaze.
John waited for a response. He released a breath of relief when it came, and wasn’t immediately prohibitive, or scolding.
“I - I’m sorry. No. What? You said to move the doll, so I did. What on earth would you want with her?”
He had told him that. But he’d also told him it was ad copy. Nothing too well known or too exciting. He wasn’t interested in giving them real details from his life.
“Yeah, well. That was another chapter in my life, and it’s a chapter that is firmly closed.” His voice was low. Hard.
John couldn’t hide his smile. “Okay, then. I better get back to my hotel and get changed out of this suit.”
“No. You nutter. No, you haven’t. I - I don’t want to talk right now. Let’s just. Let’s just do this for a while.”
This wilderness beyond the trail was his retreat for when his thoughts and feelings got to be too much. The little slice of valley was evergreen on all sides, and the boggier parts held the bare skeletons of dead trees in place. Woodpeckers seemed to love those dead trees with all their inimical, forceful drilling, echoes of shots ringing across the canopy. Nary a cloud interrupted the expanse of blue sky. The water’s surface was smooth and grey, like a pebble. Moss-covered stones freckled the edges, and reedy islands split the swamp. John had never seen another person here. Sometimes a moose waded through the murky pools, a silent and seemingly ageless sentry of a forgotten wilderness.
They stood on the third floor of Stamford Hospital. The familiar scents of floor cleaner, disinfectant, and latex stirred up old memories of his residency at Yale-New Haven Hospital. His best work had been in the ER, where blood, shit, and piss joined the scents of chemical cleaners. Some nights the emergencies were so by the book he could have performed blindfolded. Other nights, his heart pumped with exhilaration and his tongue curled over his lip as he clamped a spurting artery or glared at an interfering family member. The taste and texture of the surgical mask against his lips. The waft of a nurse’s lotion as they leaned shoulder to shoulder with him over a patient. His hands rubbed raw by the end of his shift with all the repeated washing. John Watson was a star in the ER.
To add to the strangeness of the land, the culture differed, too. Soda was called coke or pepsi, and never pop. It was difficult to find boiled peanuts, and his classmates actually
William stretched along the sheets like a cat in the sun, all glorious sinewy limbs and muscled torso. His cock stood at attention.
We, meaning humans. But honestly, if a human exhibits an ability, then it’s natural to that person. The idea of the “supernatural” is superfluous, and rings as sensational poppycock to Sherlock.
John sat in his desk chair and gripped the armrests until his knuckles were moon-white. “You can say that.”
John reddens as he follows the movement. “I’m leaving. Don’t go anywhere. Later on I want you to put that mouth to good use.” He points to the dissection kit. “You’ve got some apologising to do.”
Ella with her sharp brown eyes and buzzed haircut, she’d peered at him, scrutinized him with those eyes until he felt like a fish being filleted.
“Well, it’s settled then. You’ll move your things into my room and that way we have easier access to each other’s bodies.”
He’d help them manage health problems and connect to job opportunities. The thought watered a long-dormant seed of idealism in him: that people in the world are basically good, and sometimes just need that little push to help lift them out of difficult circumstances.
Sherlock looked perplexed. John tried not to squirm under the piercing gaze and turned to Victor. “Nice meeting you, mate.”
He’d gone around declaring his lack of interest in men enough before the fall, and had since married a woman.
Actually, no. They’d never let him live it down, no matter how smooth he thought he was. Those guys had experience, and all he had in the realms of flirting was anonymous internet innuendo and sexting. Flirting in person was far harder.
People in long, glittering dresses and tailored black tuxes milled in and out of the tall double doors leading into the venue. John showed his invite to a man who checked him off the list, and he entered the room.
Ah, of course. Just to top this entire night off. William wasn’t even gay, and Molly was into him. She was single, intelligent, and attractive. No wonder she dressed to the nines; she was dressing to impress, wasn’t she?
John stepped down the stairs and out onto the stoop of 221B. His skin crawled a bit with the idea of presenting this new person to the world. To his coworkers, at least. Getting divorced. They’d agreed to go public with their relationship once the divorce was final. It gave John time to wrap his mind around the fact that what he had desired all along had become his reality.
He met Ned’s gaze. “It was hell. And there wasn’t really a home anymore.  No family, no friends. My house was covered in paint and swear words and ‘killer,’ left by angry people who thought I helped my wife kill all those people.” He crossed his leg over his knee to stop it from wiggling. “I went from having a normal life, career, family, to nothing.” He didn’t mention the state of his marriage. “ I thought life was good. But...she...this person I thought I knew was not who or what I thought she was. And when I was acquitted, I had nothing but a lot of angry people calling me a murderer.”
John gave a shrug of his shoulders and returned to the puzzle, pressing one piece of a sloth leg to another.
The fight paused. Another voice, deep-throated and pissed, rose into the air. “Jacoby! Nasser! Let him go right now!” Swear words unspooled below their breaths as the men parted. Shawn Grady, the shelter’s Executive Director and a man John very much liked, entered the lobby. “What the hell is wrong with all of you? What are you playing at?”
“Fuck.” John almost fell onto the bed, grabbing the condom and knee-walking his way to William’s body lying in the middle of the mattress. In a moment, he’d removed a condom from its packet, and rolled it down on William’s cock. He followed it with lube, stroking and slicking as William’s head dropped back on the pillow with a loud groan.
She gave a slow nod, scrutinising him. He kept his face as blank and as pleasant as he could, though no doubt she would suspect something. She was too clever by half.
He guides Sherlock to the door. His hand hovers now at the small of Sherlock’s back. Sherlock can’t feel it through the thickness of his coat, but nevertheless, he knows it’s there. John’s hands are much smaller than his, but they’re potent. They can harm, they can heal, and they are another part of John, prominent among all the wonderful things that make up John.
It was telling that he couldn’t bring himself to ask about Victor, when Mary and his daughter were always in Sherlock’s thoughts, it seemed.
“No, no, no,” John’s saying. “That won’t work. I won’t do it.” At least, it sounds like that’s what he’s saying.
“You make your choices,” John said. “Listen, Spike might be an asshole, but that’s it. Tell him he’s an asshole. No need to bring in his race.”
“Are you talking to someone?” Sherlock moves slowly, leans on one elbow to get a better look. Just past John, he can see the shadowy figure of the doll in the chair.
He balled his fist on the arm of his chair. This old anger, he swore he would let it lie. Then this pandemic had thrown him for a loop, and he was locked down with his wife, and all the circling thoughts in his head were stirring up old issues that he’d thought gone. Like hikers walking over the den of a bear; what was once dormant was awakened now, and voracious.
“What I’m saying is I understand if you don't want that in your life. I’m giving you a chance to stop this. We could remain friends.” John offered it, but he held his breath immediately after. He knew what he wanted—a chance for a normal life with this man. This incredible, funny, brilliant man.
A mother keeps her eyes on the child, like being riveted to the vaulted acts of a tightrope walker. A mother is the net, spread thin and wide, waiting below - and now she’s spread so thin as to be unhelpful. Threads fraying. Snapping. Somehow, she missed him when he fell.
John shook his head and swung his arms as he paced. “Well, maybe sometime you should try asking me what would make me happy, instead of just assuming what’s best for me.”
“Do you know my worst?” It was out of John’s mouth before he could stop it. Their eyes locked. The room condensed to one fine point, like a drip from a tap—at a precipice of air and stainless steel, poised to fall and splatter across a porcelain plane.
This time, they would talk. About William’s interest in John because of his past. About his interest in true crime. About his seeming lack of dating history until John was on the scene.
Sherlock bites his lip. Listens as John’s feet pound against the floorboards of the steps. His chest squeezes with an uncomfortable feeling, like a jacket buttoned up too tight. “Wait!” He dashes to the bottom of the stairs. John turns to face him from halfway up. “You’re right,” Sherlock says, though he can barely look John in the eye. He realises he’s embarrassed. “Just...give me a few minutes. I must purchase a few crates to place my items in for storage. I suppose you’re right - the costumes needn’t be in my bedroom. I’ll put them upstairs. Not you.”
“Nah. Just that...he wants me to move in with him when my lease is up. Seems to think we’re well suited to one another, ‘
Fear broke out in a cold prickle of sweat along his neck. Most of his anonymous communication over the years had been from overzealous loons hellbent on shaming him into saying he was the mastermind behind Mary’s kills. But WV? It couldn’t be William...William Vernet?
The way he said the last bit tripped alarms in John’s head. “Well, no. But you are important to me.”
John shoots Sherlock a look that borders on laughing. “You’re a nutter. And I like that about you. But you’d give anyone else a heart attack and they’d have the police in on you in seconds.”
“Fine,” he finally admitted aloud, his words pommeling the air. “I’m going nuts. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’ve been living in this boring place, and nothing ever happens to me.”
The sight of William stole his breath. With the top buttons of his dark pinstripe shirt undone, he looked ravishing. Beauty marks traveled up his neck like a constellation of stars—a reversal, though; dark pinpricks on a moon-white expanse. He'd neatly rolled his sleeves a quarter of the way up. In those long hands—a musician’s hands—lay a bottle of red wine.
She lights a cigarette. With Siger gone out for the day, she’s not concerned about his disapproving stare. Draws the smoke into her lungs, revels in the dip of oxygen that dizzies her head. Sometimes, she could scream. Scream in the middle of this American suburban neighborhood with its rosebushes and its azaleas and its perfectly green lawns outside of immense brick houses, cottage-style all, but ostentatious in their splendour. Money couldn’t buy her son’s life, and she’s spent more than enough to prove it. Not that the insurance was any help - if she’d known this illness was coming, she’d have made Siger keep his job in London, rather than move here to this New England town to follow after a bigger salary. This is the kind of neighbourhood where people run and do yoga and wear lululemon even when they aren’t doing either of those activities. Where Lexus and beamers are parked in driveways, where people hire landscapers and housekeepers. No one smokes, except the men on occasion. Expensive cigars.
John releases a cry like he’s been sliced open. It’s the wail of a lost child. Sherlock holds him still, staring at the fake arm in his hand.
John walked out of the kitchen and rounded the corner to see William peering at his multiple copies of each of Sholto’s works. “You’ve read him?”
John wouldn’t say it out loud, but in that moment relief buoyed him as if the words were sunshine touching cold wintry places. Years of heaviness seemed to slip from his neck and shoulders like layers of thick, dead leaves raked from an old, near-forgotten garden. The words planted something new. Something green and vital.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I suppose I’m wondering about its effect on the aesthetic of the room. You don’t think it clashes with the bedroom of two adult men?” He glances at his grand little bust of Goethe on the shelf, and the Judo certificate hanging above his bed. Slides his eyes over the Periodic Tables on the wall, and the sleek lamps illuminating the room.
“Well, no. Nothing...special.” He thought for a second of Woody, but that was just letting off steam and dwelling in daydreams. Rodrigo had been two weeks of furtive couplings. Nothing had ever come of either connection. “But I would like to know more about you.”
"Atlas." John said before walking towards her. "Be careful." She nodded once before disappearing into the black of a door leaving John alone in the seperated room. He kicked the wall hard - exasaserbating a groan of pain - before shoving his hands in his pockets and looking toward the glass ceiling. And not before long the man had disappeared leaving nothing. Then the water started.
"Not a fan of that?" John asked with a smirk and Sherlock shook his head. Giving a little laugh, John, put a hand to Sherlock's back and rubbed with his thumb.
All talking stops. Floorboards creak as John heads for the door. Pops his blond head out. “Be right down!” he calls. It thrills Sherlock to no end that John will jump up for a case as if it were the cherry on a sundae.
Murmurs rose and fell throughout the party like the lapping of ocean waves on sand. He wondered how many conversations were about him. The internet was forever, and all of those photos were online. Him on the witness stand, haggard and ashen-faced, like he had aged a decade. He’d lost weight, and his eyes had a hollow look, more like he was the ghost of himself rather than a man in his prime. The lines in his face had only deepened since, but he knew in the dells of the internet there were photos of him as a young man, grinning at the camera while dressed in his high school jersey and holding hands with Mary. She smiled, but the smile didn’t meet her eyes. A lot of speculation wavered about that one—was that when he began controlling her? Was that when he’d slowly chipped away at her self-esteem, so that when he began fucking men, poor little Mary was so convinced she couldn’t go on without him, that she’d put up with it?
Once inside, John pushed William down on the bed, and opened the drawer where he’d placed a brand new box of condoms and a tube of lubricant. “Lie back.”
As they tumble into the flat, their lungs filled with laughter and their eyes filled with light, Sherlock is seized with a sense of profound rightness. John Watson is
“It’s good to see you, Molly.” His airways grew thick. He worked his throat muscles, quelling the lumps that kept trying to form. “I didn’t think I’d be back in Connecticut, ever.” A nervous laugh escaped him. He tried to cover it. “Did you even age?”
“You heard the man. Out! I better not see your faces for three days. Ned, you might as well go with John to the clinic. Your mouth is bleedin'.” Shawn herded Spike and his loudly swearing compatriots to the doors.
He collapsed over John. John couldn’t bring himself to mind the heavy weight over his body. The small bit of panic was back again, below his sternum, but he didn’t mind it. It wasn’t the same terror he used to feel. It wasn’t squeezing his chest.
The old hurt sparked up in a flare of anger, but he quenched it. “I—I can’t say that I’m not still a bit put out about that. I don't really know what else to say about that. You and I have been through a lot.” The midnight run from Hamish. The long ride to Connecticut, and the adjustments of living in a whole new part of the country. “But I want to see you.”
“Come off it!” William barked so suddenly that John jerked in surprise. “I may have...oddities, John. I—” His eyes stared off into the middle distance. “I know I have morbid interests compared to much of the populace. But if you use your brain at all, you’d see I am...unreasonably smitten with you.” William pressed his lips together in a thin line. “You hold a fire inside you, a fire in the belly that manifests itself as anger, but you...you’re a healer by nature. You like to take care of people, yet the circumstances of your life have stunted you. I see you for what you are—a person fiercely loyal to those around you, who would strive to make the world a better place. But you’ve been sabotaged by monsters and the absolute putrid dredges of society who dare to call themselves human.” William lowered his head. “I didn’t google you, John. I knew of Mary Watson, and I realized who you were that night at the party, right in that moment when I was deducing you.”
John gives a sharp nod to DC Reynolds. “We’re done here. Have a great night, mate.” His tone of voice suggests he doesn’t actually mean what he says.
The crowd was young professionals, at least younger than John’s thirty-eight years. Women in fashionable light sweaters, leggings, and heeled strappy sandals. Men in collared shirts or polos, wearing khakis or brand name jeans. John’d been no slouch to fashion back in the day, but his years in Vermont led him to collect more lumpy sweaters and flannels than the average person probably warranted. Tonight, he wore jeans and the same collared shirt he'd worn for the interview. No tie, no suit jacket. His black dress shoes. On the nicer side of casual, but he had the feeling he lacked the sophistication other men in this room flaunted with ease.
Plus, he couldn’t ignore a little something inside of him, like a spark or a seed...yeah, a seed. It had split under William’s scrutinizing stare, sending down roots and sending up leaves into a bright sun. John’s nerves were aflame. He tapped his fingers against the counter. Stared at the phone, hoping for a new text. None came.
They really believe in her innocence. Some of them really believe I’m the murderer, and that I framed her. They believe I still need to be brought to justice. Some of them...I think some of them were actually dangerous.”
“It might be a deal-breaker.” William’s face was drawn in a serious expression, but his eyes crinkled at the end of his deadpan delivery.
“She’s yours?” Sherlock sets down his pencil, quietly, carefully, so as not to grab John’s attention. He tries to keep the tone of his voice nonchalant, almost uninterested.
The fight has gone out of John, who sags against the wall. A thump echoes in the room. When Sherlock looks down, Rose lays on the floorboards between John’s feet.
He pauses. The shadows in the room thicken in the corners. The light from the windows dims into a foggy grey. Sherlock waits.
John snickered when a pic popped up to reveal Woody’s lower half. He was kneeling on his bed in a shimmering blue jockstrap, his pert ass bared, muscular thighs spread. That impressive package hung heavy between his legs.
Sherlock lets his voice drop into a lower register. “I’m not asking for a cuddle, John. I’m promising getting us both off to help us fall asleep, and I’m promising morning sex.” No need to speak of the softer emotions bubbling near the surface, warm feelings of bliss - chemicals rushing the bloodlines and stuffing him with uplifting neurotransmitters.
They ate the lasagna with a lot of chatter. William stole from his plate, claiming John had served himself the more choice morsels. It sparked a duel of forks at the table, and John laughed like he hadn’t laughed in years, laughter that must have been hiding deep in the recesses of bone and marrow. They quickly finished the bottle of wine, and John brought out his bourbon. He poured them each two fingers, and they sat on the sofa.
“Thank you for the opportunity,” John said as their handshake ended. “I hope to hear from you soon.”
Sherlock’s lips flattened and his eyes clashed with John’s, a hint of storm to them. “Why do you want to know?”
John strokes his curls with care, letting the strands twirl around his fingers. Sherlock is lulled to the edge of sleep. On the telly is some old Bond film. The rule during these films is Sherlock is not allowed to deduce anything or discuss the unbelievable parts of the plot. “It ruins the effect,” John told him. “It’s meant to be make-believe.”
His stomach clenched. Could he see himself with William for the rest of his days, laughing and fucking and bonding over terrible action movies? Maybe getting a dog and living together, making tea in the mornings and snuggling in bed at night?
"But you're my idiot," Sherlock said. "And I think we’ve waited long enough." He leaned toward John with a smouldering smile. "Take me to bed.”
Thank you so much for reading. This story was not in my plans this year, but it happened. I do have other planned Johnlock stories in the making.
“I’m going back, though. I have some issues to work through.” He clears his throat. It seems like it should echo throughout the room for as loud as it is in the dim quiet of the flat. “So. You’re very important to me. I know...I know we intended for this to be casual, and that we’d...we’d take it slow. But I thought you should know that you are important to me.” His eyes search Sherlock’s face. “Very important.”
"A little. Think it's the cold," Atlas whispered before she felt herself engulfed in a wooly blanket as the dog gathered at her feet.
"Your choosing her, it feels like your choosing her," John said. "And we both should be choosing her but I can't look at her. Not right now. And I can't forgive her as fast as you can."
"Okay, I didn't think you would think like that but I'm scared about the rest of papa's family," Atlas whispered.
"Pass me your coat, papa," Atlas said to John as she held out a hand to him and he handed her his coat. She tucked it down to her right and he smiled at his mum.
"Good morning!" Rosie said as she lifted up some greasy hands, exclaiming in weird excitement. Completely comfortable with the woman she, at last count, was incredibly wary off. "Your the nice one!"
"I'm in here," Atlas said as she called from the bathroom. The door unlocked and she stood and looked at him, before stepping back and picking up her toothbrush. Slowly, she began to brush her teeth, aware that he was watching her but when she finished she frowned. Her knuckles gripped the edge of the sink and she looked at her papa wide eyed.
Together they were sat eating and talking. John had missed a few cases so everyone were eagerly filling him in on what he'd missed.
For some reason, it brought to mind those few days with Irene. Aristocratic, intelligent, beautiful. She had everything, and while she wasn’t John’s cup of tea, she’d been Sherlock’s. Why had he wanted her phone, after all? He kept mementos from every case, but he was turned about by her in ways that John had never seen.
“In the trees,” he says, his eyes still closed. “Is it John there in the trees? I think he’s waiting for me.”
He put his laptop on the coffee table and turned the telly on. Dissatisfaction roiled deep in his belly as the telly droned. He didn’t hear a word of it.
William smiled. “Only if you’ll text me.” As he stepped away, a satisfied luminescence seemed to surround him. He slid into the crowd like water between stones.
The morning was glorious. John’d awoken to a sleep-tousled William, all soft smiles and warm skin. They managed to fit both of them in the tiny shower stall, and though they didn’t get much washing done, there was laughter, kissing, and mutual, knee-buckling release. After dressing, John walked William to the door, and kissed him goodbye.
“Then come see me,” she said. “I—I know it won’t always be easy. But this is the first step, isn’t it?”
As he walked up the steps and the seventh creaked, the voices in the flat paused. Sherlock’s deep rumble started again and was joined by a puff of laughter. John continued up onto the landing and headed to the lounge, where they normally saw clients.
John jerks his head, his face a cartoonish depiction in bemusement. He laughs as he pockets his phone and his keys. Pats his pocket where his wallet bulges. “Might need to get your hearing checked. I wasn’t talking to anyone.” He bumps Sherlock on the shoulder. “Where we headed?”
Sherlock changes tactics. “But you could be, and I’d reward you handsomely.” His eyebrows angle inward as his eyes grow hooded, a suggestive smile on his lips.
Sherlock shuffles to stand beside John, and takes his hand. “No. No sillier than a man named Sherlock.”
But god fucking damn, was it lonely. He got up, brushed his teeth, made himself presentable, and did whatever he needed to do to get through the day. When little cracks appeared in his armor against the world, he’d drive to one of Vermont’s other little cities and find a hookup through Grindr. A furtive blowie or handjob later, he’d be back in his car and headed home, convincing himself that the orgasm had been worth it. Back in his cold state of stasis until the feeling of loneliness crept over him again. He used the hookups as shields. “I can go back to living in society again at any time,” he’d tell himself. “Because there are people who like me. There are people who want me. I choose to live this way.”
“But I didn’t expect you. I didn’t expect this...attraction, and I didn't expect to be faced with the delightful complexity that is your person. I’d never felt so...stimulated until I met you. Our subsequent dinner proved to me that the attraction wasn’t just a fleeting sense of lust. I was very pleased when you asked me on a date. I am extremely attracted to you, not because of your circumstances, but because of your heroic response to your circumstances.”
William chuckled. “Oh, John. I thought I was quite the ‘hot shit,’ as the rabble says. I’m the smartest man in every room. But it’s a bit lonely in that corner. I have learned that people can be a safety net when you least expect it.”
Despite the icy fear that had encased his lower body, John licked his lips and shoved the words from his chest and out of his mouth. “I—I’m in love with you, you idiot. If you can’t tell by now, I have been for months!”
John didn’t feel like asking her any questions. He was still trying to distract himself from thinking about Sherlock. And Victor. His eyes drifted from the screen to the walls. Pictures of a smiling Rosie. Their wedding day photo framed and hanging in prominence on one wall. Happier times, as confusing as they were for John at the time. He'd made peace with his choices. Was still making peace with his choices. It was a process, right? Somewhere over the years the pain and anger had dulled, and in its place had been laughter and a sense of
He opens the door and gestures for John to get in. They rarely take taxis now, always checking the driver and then side-eying each other with smirks traveling across their faces. It’s a ritual Sherlock has become attached to.
“John,” he whispers, though the urge to shout is hot and volcanic in his veins. With a strike at the lightswitch, he floods the room with the overhead light.
John smiled as he leaned against his desk and laid out the open kit. “What was his problem this time?” Most of the guys were pleasant, but Spike had a chip on his shoulder the size of Texas.
for Sherlock Holmes. He presses John into the wall and captures his mouth with his. John moans against him.
What’s more, he’s not a fearful person - no jumping at strange shadows or odd noises. He’s not like the rest of the populace - suspicious of clowns or bothered by derelict houses, even if a horrific murder occurred there - that actually makes a derelict house all the more interesting, in his opinion.
John stared out the window onto the rough brick of the house next door. A cold grey rain fell between them, pebble-heavy drops forming murky brown puddles. All the houses stood so close together. Everything was too close. The walls of the kitchen seemed to somehow press an unrelenting gaze upon him despite the neutral palette - offensive anyway, somehow. Rosie’s complaints rattled him but he kept a lid on his temper. Mary...was Mary.
She lays the sage bundle down in one of his seashells, avoiding the label. How he loved cataloging natural items. That sharp mind of his so naturally tended to the sciences, and she’d taken great joy in encouraging him all his life. All the first thirteen years of it. The last year has been entirely different.
William blinked, his lips parted. “Sorry,” he said, and threw Mike a hapless glance. Like a child who knew they did something wrong. “Sorry, I got carried away.”
“I thought that if we weren’t going to date, we should be friends, and I didn’t want it to be awkward for either of us, so I put us on the same page.”
A good-looking stranger with a quick wit, taking down that goddamn boor Peter Lysenko, as if he were flicking away a pesky fly.
“A horse,” she said, as she smashed the paintbrush in the bruised looking purple and applied it to the white paper.
The muscle in John’s jaw grew tight. Victor and Sherlock. Victor ‘more than friends’ Trevor isolated with Sherlock for two weeks. Who knows what doors might open, what flames might get fanned.
“Despite the impression I’ve made earlier about my exploits, I feel I must tell you that I have actually been saving myself for marriage.”
The physical magnetism between them crackled with a tremendous force. The other night they’d barely said three words to each other before John was ass-up over the arm of the sofa, caged by William’s long limbs and his heavy weight. It made John come so hard he saw stars.
“But this final family included children.” John crossed his free hand over his chest and squeezed his shoulder. “The only way they knew it was her was because she’d been caught on the youngest child’s nanny cam in the teddy bear. She’d gotten away with it if she’d spotted the cam. She was...she was very good at hiding her tracks.”
The case turns out despicably easy. The man was pushed by his upstairs neighbour through not his own window, but the neighbour’s window. Sherlock gets the upstairs neighbour - Joe - to confess once he proves the downstairs neighbour - Craven - was in his flat by the shoe marks on the stairs. The two men had had a spat about the noise Joe created during his aerobic workouts. Thumping, thudding, rattling, and driving Craven to have it out with Joe.
“Goddamnit!” he shouted. His voice echoed once, and then the plant life absorbed any remaining echoes. A blue jay scolded him from a branch.
He flopped down on the bed and pulled his laptop to him. Flicked it on. Entered the chat with the guys. He could see they were online: Woody1981, luvahboi, JarJarDies, and Impaler1897. The cohort of friendly users who helped him to remain tethered when he had topsy-turvy moments of doubt and teeth-rattling anxiety overshadowing his days.
Sherlock harrumphed from the bed. “Aren’t I the one suffering from a respiratory disease?” But his voice was full of humour. “My money’s on the man -”
John bit his lip, then spoke. “Is that what eats you up? That not all of whom you killed were soldiers?”
And he should be thinking about that job, about moving and all the particulars that went with that. Not wasting thoughts on this guy who was probably in a thing with Molly, anyway. They might be dating, or on the verge of dating. Flirting with intention, with the promise of fruition. Molly wouldn’t waste her time chasing a gay guy. It just didn’t seem likely. And John’s sense of gaydar wasn’t all that trustworthy, if he was honest with himself. When he’d cheated on Mary, he thought of himself as a straight guy who enjoyed fucking guys. He had a girlfriend, right? Therefore, not gay.
“Harry told me that when your grandmother was dying, she told your mother and Harry why she hid the doll in the basement.”
“And what do you do, John?” The blue color of her eyes reminded John of Mary. Mary had been into the Gwen Stefani look, with bleach blonde hair and thick mascara. Nora McCaffrey looked at him with a playful, flirtatious sparkle in her eyes. Mary’s eyes would sometimes sparkle like that. Predator cavorting with prey before the pounce.
He’d never paid much attention back in high school, he had realized. He just thought her face was like that. Her eyes ever-penetrating, her mouth almost a permanent smirk. A smirk that never quite met her eyes. He thought that was just how she was. He never thought it could mean, maybe, just maybe, she was a psychopath.
Sherlock slides his left arm beneath John’s armpit and snakes up it over his shoulder to grasp John’s nape with his hand - a half-nelson.
DC Reynolds appears beside Sherlock. “Another one for the books, eh?” Reynolds is a likeable fellow with deep-set brown eyes and a shock of carrot-orange hair. “Brilliant, as always.”
John’s stomach chilled. He noticed that Molly’s face had turned pink. She started forward, said, “Peter—”
The word ‘EXIT’ crowned four doors at opposite corners in blood red lettering. Didn’t they seem too far away? Two stood on the other side of banquet tables dressed in white linen. A third lay close to the stage, with a podium and a banner for Stamford Hospital proudly on display beside it.
What was so wrong with him he didn’t see Mary for what she was? That she was missing something essential, something human. He’d married a psychopath, and he, studying to be a doctor, had had no fucking clue.
Ned’s frown grew deeper. “I don’t really mean to be racist. What he said pissed me off, so I said something to piss ‘im off.”
And he was off—John rubbed elbows with the Stamford wealthy and elite. He did his best to act casual, but likely appeared awkward. Able to smile, able to joke, but standing on the fringe of the group, as if everyone was aware he was the one who didn’t belong. Since it was up to him to ensure they gave money again, he nodded and thanked them for creating such an important clinic. He laughed at jokes, and listened as one man—old white men with glasses often looked the same to him, so he wasn’t sure which one it was—told a story that painted himself with all the golden light of a charitable giver to the less fortunate. It made John’s ears ring.
He stared up at the ceiling. Worked his throat. Forced the words out. “It didn’t matter, though. Everything was destroyed. I got a job as an overnight stocker for a grocery store, and then I had to move. I couldn’t stay with the Stamfords with their first child on the way. I was on the move for several years because Mary’s...
ATLAS settled against Timothy in the comfort of her own home, watching as he typed up more notes for the next book.
"I'll take her," Atlas smiled as May followed whilst Xerxes and Sammy held back. "Come on Ro." She smiled and led her to the cupboard under the stairs up the side of the room onto the music landing. Pulling out the box Atlas opened it and showed it to Rosie, who plucked bobbin of a dark green out and smiled. Running back over to Sherlock she handed it to him before Atlas came over with a needle and a little pair of scissors.
"No." Atlas lied. Truth was it did hurt, when she woke in the night from a nightmare. She would lie, hand on her side stomach, her other hand clapped over her mouth to avoid waking people up from her whimpering. Did anyone know it brought pain? No, she hadn't
Atlas quickly scarpered to the kitchen putting the kettle on to make hot beverages for their announced guests. She hadn't taken her manuscript with her leaving it on her seat, the title being written on the top of the paper with the beginning tune for Piano and violin duet. The title was
"It didn't all go bad," Atlas smiled. "Look at what we've got now, dad. We're in the best place we've ever been. I have two dad's, two siblings, a dog, a
"They cancel each other out." Atlas said excitedly as if she had cracked a really big puzzle and in reality she had.
"ROSIE'S speaking to Samuel you know." John sighed, smiling as he sat down opposite his partner. He smiled slightly as he eyes him up. Sherlock's hands were placed in thought, chin resting lightly. An eye flicked open and tracked John as he sat. He went back to his thoughts, John eagerly reading his book. However, this didn't last long as he looked up to see Sherlock looking directly at him.
"Me and Atlas narrowed it down to just those two. I've already asked for her help, but do you think it's alright if we don't tell anyone until we buy it, until you and Rosie see it?" Sherlock smiled, John nodding once.
EVERYONE had opened their presents and now it was only Sherlock's left. The box that contained the collar had been handed to him, but Mycroft told him just to wait.
"She's not been going long," John smiled softly a she moved away the blankets and anything that could put her in a tangle.
It was now, as he thought about Mary, he thought about what he would have done. All this time he'd believed that he would have stayed with her, loved her and Rosie, gone to see Sherlock on a weekend. But recent weeks had shone a different light on the scenario. As he thought about it now he came to the realisation.
Atlas woke with a start, her head and heart pounding and her lungs unable to fill with enough air to keep herself afloat. She looked around the room carefully, noticing with gratefulness that Sammy and Rosie were still sleeping. Slipping out of bed she opened the door and snuck out going down the stairs and into the kitchen. Panic rising in her chest, she clumsily pulled a mug out the cupboard, her hands beginning to tremor with the panic. Flicking the kettle switch, she dropped a teabag into the cup in the half light as the dog came to sit down next to her.
"We're going off on a little walk. We'll be back here in a while." Atlas smiled, before her and Sammy headed off.
"You don't remember?" John asked as Sherlock supposed his answer was no. He couldn't figure out who this unknown person was as she sat there, looking at him. She looked as if she was about to break down but she hid it well. Concealed behind a false complexion.
"Before you start it," Sherlock whispered. "You should know that it's...well yeah...some of it might be a little difficult to watch."
"Hello," Dr Young smiled, entering the room. Her face was stretched into a wide smile and her hair pulled back off her face.
If any of the lyrics through this is used for an actual song that you write, then please just don't. I actually wrote these songs, the lyrics mean a hell of a lot to me because I'm going through (hopefully the last of) a long line of shit. Lockdown is not bothering me. And nor is Coronavirus. I have just lost a lot in a very short period of time, and my songs are my emotions and how I describe it.
"Atlas has been to a party and Sammy came back here with her." Eurus explained. "She won't stop crying, John."
"Because I don't want them to see me. I didn't want to ask them to come home and spend even more time with me. It's not fair. They hardly see my sister or Sammy and it must be hard for them." Atlas said exasperatedly. "And I'm scared they hate me."
ATLAS took a while before she woke up and when she did, she was greeted by Sherlock's face opposite hers.
"Right, Atlas, just stay still a moment. If you wouldn't mind not touching her, just for a moment Dr Watson-Holmes?" Dr Young asked, looking at him.
"And I'm not coming back." Abayomi sighed, falling defeated onto an old classroom chair. They were in the room that the quintet and claimed as theirs just last week as for it was at the top of the stairs and forgotten about. Atlas had picked the lock and when Mr Fraggerty had found them their two days earlier had said they could stay. It was an unused social studies room after all - the room being far too small to be a classroom but too big to be a storage room. The quintet had coined it The Box because it was shaped, remarkably like a cardboard box.
"Oh sweetheart," Sherlock said with a small smile. "I'm not mad, go take a shower and I'll change your bedding." He reached out a hand and rubbed her cheek as he helped her to a sitting position. "Don't be embarrassed, okay?" He paused. "And don't worry about it."
"I'll take Redbeard through to the kitchen-come living space," Harry said. "Isla got a wooden extension onto where her original stone kitchen is and now it opens up onto this amazing dining with double doors into her garden. It means that kitchen is now this big seating area with a fire and-"
"IF we put a G7 in directly after the G it would give it a vibe." Atlas laughed, smiling as Sammy played just that. Together, they were writing music, happy upbeat music. The violin remained untouched for the time being, often coming in later - if at all for this particular song.
Atlas then joined Sherlock and Rosie further up ahead looking at insects, John hanging back to walk with the parents.
"We know." John said coming over with another mug they had missed when picking them up. "Don't we Sherlock?" All that could be heard was Sherlock snickering on the other side of the kitchen as he washed the mugs. "Just ignore him." John announced.
In my story, Atlas is a early learner, studying in Upper Sixth (allowed on due to her smarts) and is taking four subjects. As Atlas has come from Edinburgh, she studied under the Scottish school system and so therefore she has had to change over. Now, If i am correct a GCSE is the same level as a National 5. Which in Scotland is sat across the ages of 15 and 16 - some (like myself) will start that year being the age of 14. You then progress to sit Highers which are the same level as an A-Level at 16 and 17 - again some (like myself) will start the year being 15. An Advanced Higher is the same as 1st year university and to get into University generally requires just highers.
On the cab ride (which Atlas had insisted upon) to 221B Baker Street, Atlas explained how her dad may be an egotistical jerk and her pa may be a protective father. Or that it could very well be the other way round. She hesitated to mention Rosie but did so anyway, Sammy nodding.
"Just to move Peter back into th-" Sherlock started before he appeared in the doorway and...faltered. "I can...I'm..."
"Do you want a hug?" Sherlock asked before he opened his arms, his hands offered out. Atlas rolled her eyes, took his hands and pulled herself up. Hugging him tightly and itching her nose against the soft fabric shoulder, she sighed.
"Of course it's alright. Did you have a good lunch?" John smiled before Rosie squealed and hugged Mycroft's leg.
"Oh yes. I know Ida Atlas Elizabeth Holmes." A voice said, this time male as the ceiling opened to reveal glass and there was a man there. Lying face down causing Atlas to walk backwards and hit the cement wall at her back. Silence filled before Atlas came forward tentatively.
"You have some grey hairs." Rosie remarked as she looked in his hair. "A lot of flour." She continued to look before pulling his head up, her little hands on his chin. "Daddy?"
"Don't be smart." John quipped before he took a few steps back and looked at Atlas. Still boiling, he made his way towards the double doors and outside, whilst Atlas darted off to the lobby and she could be heard going up the stairs and into her bedroom.
"For what?" Atlas shrugged as she made her way over to John's chair and sat down. He wouldn't be up for quite some time and Rosie was sitting happily on the floor. She was around about four and was playing with some blocks of big Lego. Her blonde brown hair had yet to be brushed and Sherlock made a mental note to brush it for her. It was strange for him, but he found himself soothed when he cared for his best friends daughter.
"What?" Wanda asked looking at her son pointedly. "William Sherlock Scott Holmes you are normally up to something when you smile like that." Sherlock looked at her funny before helping make more mix - under supervision of course. He angled the bowl at her and she nodded as he stopped mixing and placed the bowl near. Mycroft walked in after, some time later, Eurus staying outside to continue drawing the river. She'd started it the day before and she was singing softly to herself in all her insanity.
"Atlas always knows." John laughed, before frowning when he saw his partners face. It was sincere and quiet.
"Atlas?" Rosie asked, sucking her lip again. "Can I have a cuddle?" She asked and Atlas smiled wider than she thought possible.
"Come and be sociable, love," He held her shoulder as she shook her head. "They're not scary." He ended up sitting down next to her on the floor as she could hear laughter erupting next door, Sherlock's laugh and Rosie's giggle. Sammy however, appeared into the living room and sat down by Peter.
Which meant...that meant the old baggage to things John hadn’t told anyone but Ella. Didn’t it? The hours and hours of sweaty, frightening interviews with police, the agonizing meetings with his lawyer, the time spent sitting in a prison cell awaiting trial while his mind went in circles of
“You absolute dickhead.” John wiped his eyes. “I can’t believe I’ve poured out my soul to you, and we’re fucking laughing.”
John almost blushed. “Yeah. I suppose I would.” He cleared his throat. “For whatever it’s worth, I am sorry that happened. Victor sounds like he was a good guy.”
After a while, he slips from the bed as quietly as he can, like a ghost floating across the floor. He closes the door behind him with a muffled
“I was just coming back from lunch and spotted you. I’m glad! It’d be nice to catch up.” Mike shoved his hands into his pockets. “So, how’d it go upstairs?”
“Hi,” Mary said without looking at him. She held a bowl and a serving spoon in her hand. Domestic life had changed her a bit. Her sharp edges had rounded, her hair had grown out in its natural colour, and crow’s feet formed around her eyes. Pretty, of course, but at times, John couldn’t help but look at her and wonder about her past disguises. Today seemed to be one of those days where the thought niggled at the back of his mind, and he shoved it away. Must have been the weather.
He had to push it back, force it back into the shadows, back into the limitless, innocuous sense of torpor.
“Fantastic. Molly’s having a shindig tonight at her place. Said you should come.” He brimmed with eagerness like a puppy brims with joy. Apparently, the years had not reduced Mike’s general zest for the good things in life. However, the thought of a party turned John’s stomach in a grinding, grizzling twist. “Oh, I don’t know, Mike.” Jesus, he still owed both Mike and Molly bail money. And walking into a party? This hospital lobby was the most people John had seen in years, and at least the space was open and the ceiling vaulted. He remembered Molly’s apartment. Tiny, and shabby, with ratty, second-hand furniture and too many half-finished crochet projects tucked into dusty corners.
“What would you like to drink? I came up with a signature cocktail for tonight if you want to try it,” Molly said. “It’s Pisco with kiwi and lime. I think people are really liking it.”
He didn’t. He put his hands on his hips. “How do you know that? Wait, it doesn’t matter. I do them because you like them, and I won’t if you’re just going to sit there while I carry everything.”
Jesus. He wished he’d made a better impression. He couldn’t quite put his finger on why—though obviously, the man attracted him. Not just physically, but the way William had vanquished Peter Lysenko like a goddamn knight on a horse made John’s toes curl. And the way William had made John laugh. And
John smiled into the front of Sherlock’s shirt. “Yeah. Yeah, this is you. And I love that about you.” It had been easier and easier for them, dancing a bit around the words, but both of them knew the love was there regardless. He leaned back. “Gotta go. I can’t be late.”
