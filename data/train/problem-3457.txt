“Well you don’t remember me,” Cas said in a small voice. “I’ll call Sam, maybe he can convince you that you’re here for your own good.” He stormed off to the other side of the cabin, which wasn’t really far enough to get a good storm going. He yanked open a drawer in the kitchenette, which was apparently where he’d been keeping a cell, and then slammed the drawer shut for good measure. He mashed his finger to the power button and scowled while he waited for Face ID to unlock the phone. Dean thought it was a wonder that facial recognition could work at all while he was pulling that face, but perhaps he always frowned like that. Cas jabbed at the touchscreen a few times, then handed him the phone. Dean stared at the screen that promised it was calling Sam until the ringing fell silent. He was debating whether it had been Sam’s real number the angel had dialled when screen went black. Raising an expectant eyebrow, Dean held the phone out for Castiel to wake it up again.
Dean looked down. “Damn, I’m missing the most important bits.” He jogged into his bedroom to grab the items he’d left on top of his dresser and rushed back out to Charlie.
As soon as they were both naked, Dean swooped down to kiss Cas on the mouth. After several long moments, he pulled away to lavish kisses elsewhere. He kissed and sucked Cas’s neck and then every inch of his chest, licking the soft skin before working his way back up to Cas’s lips. Cas grabbed his hair and pulled Dean in, taking control of the kiss, turning it hard when Dean had started it out soft.
“I'm very pop-culture savvy now,” Cas told Gabriel seriously. “And Dean’s been catching me up on all the old episodes before we watch the new season together.”
“This is not honey.” He squinted angrily at the bee bottle which, above the large lettering that said ‘honey’, declared itself to be ‘bee free’.
“It wasn’t like he did it all the time or anything. But I guess it was kinda like water torture, you know? Eroding our confidence one drop at a time. I started thinking I was stupid and Sam started thinking he was some kind of weakling. You’ve seen the photo of us on the fridge, right?” Cas nodded. “I mean, really, can you imagine that Gigantor thinking he's a weakling?”
The music there was rock, indie and alternative. Sometimes they’d play the odd Metallica song, but mostly it was more modern than the majority of what Dean listened to. He still liked it though and, right now, he wanted to listen to music he liked and maybe check out some hot guys who wouldn’t mind being checked out.
Dean rolled Cas over and worked his way down his torso, showering the smooth skin with kisses. Dean loved blowjobs, not just receiving them- though naturally he was a fan of that too- but giving them. He loved taking Cas’s hard length in his mouth and swallowing him deep. He loved how Cas always started out careful, not thrusting, not holding the back of his head down. But what he loved most was how, in the end, Cas always lost control. Cas would fuck into the welcoming warmth of Dean’s throat, pushing deep inside, grabbing his hair and pulling his head even closer as he thrust. At first, Cas had been so sorry whenever that happened, but after a while he’d realised that it was what Dean wanted, to be taken like that, to be the willing instrument of his pleasure. Dean could only trust tender kindness so far, he trusted wild abandon more, that was when he truly believed Cas wanted him. He lapped at the head of Cas’s cock before taking him in his mouth. Cas moaned when he sucked lightly on him. He held still though, the hand on Dean’s head didn’t grab or push, just lightly stroked his cheek. He hummed happily round his mouthful making Cas groan louder. He sucked and licked until he could feel Cas moving restlessly beneath him and knew that he wasn’t far from losing control. Much as he loved choking on Cas’s cock, Dean realised that he didn’t want that now. Later, he’d take his time worshipping Cas’s cock with his mouth. Right now, he didn’t just want sex, he wanted closeness and connection too. He wanted his whole body pressed against Cas. He wanted to be able to look into Cas’s eyes. He wanted to be able to kiss him while they made love. He moved his hand from the base of Cas’s shaft and slid it down between his legs, touching him lightly.
Cas glared. Meg smiled. He went back to the stove and put some butter in the pan to melt before turning to Meg.
Cas knew there was at least one more on this playlist, but Meg had obviously decided she was okay with Cain because the music changed to something more mellow next.
“Fuck, Cas.” What was he supposed to say to that? “And your parents just let you grow up in a place like that, all rules and hate?”
Gabriel was looking like his usual smug self again when he said, “So, how long do you think it would have taken you to figure it out, Deano?”
“Right.” Dean clapped his hands once, then rubbed them together thoughtfully. “Why don’t you sit down and I’ll get us some drinks. They’ve got whiskey here like any other bar.”
“Whatever,” Charlie said, waving off Dean’s comment like anyone reasonable would see that a character in
That normally only lasted a few minutes before his usual cocky persona kicked in. Admittedly, his brash confidence was ninety percent manufactured, regardless of whether he was talking to a man or a woman, but he felt better when the self-assured front was in place. He might still feel like a bumbling idiot on the inside, but it was so much better if he, at least, wasn't a bumbling idiot on the outside.
Cas showed him how to open the hidden compartment, which was set into a hollow in the wall behind the bed. There was holy oil and an angel blade in there, which was what finally made Dean shut his damn mouth, because this guy must be on the level if he was willing to show Dean things that could actually trap and harm him.
“Cute guy like you, Cas, you'd clean up. Not that I know what gay guys are into,” Dean added quickly. “But I'm pretty sure you'd be up anyone's alley... Or they'd be up yours if you'd prefer to bottom!" Dean smirks at Cas. “Yeah, they'd be into you.” He elbows Sam. “Into him, get it?!”
Dean wasn’t the only one with irrational fears. How did Sam like it when someone didn’t take those fears seriously?
“I don’t need to be looked after! And I don’t need some weirdo angel making calf eyes at me and acting all hurt because I’m not making them back! We had sex, that’s all!”
He had to ring Cas to say Merry Christmas, didn’t he? Christmas was about the people you loved... Or, er, the people you really liked and were maybe dating... Doing something with? Seeing? They definitely 'saw' each other, right?
Cas walked out of his apartment building just as Dean pulled up. He looked hotter than usual, although maybe that was just the effect of not having seen him for two whole days. He was wearing dark jeans, a Doors t-shirt and the leather biker jacket that Dean always thought he looked fucking sexy in.
“Oh... yeah?” Dean shifted on the bed. “So, er, what are you wearing?” he asked because he was pretty sure that was universal code for I’m-totally-up-for-some-phone-sex-if-you-are.
Dean decided to stay for one more drink and maybe a quick walk-through of the various rooms in the club, just in case he saw that guy again. He made his way to the upstairs bar. It was quieter than the rest of the club. The music that wafted from the speakers would probably be described as chill beats or something equally obnoxious. The more relaxed atmosphere was touted as a place to cool down after dancing for hours with your friends, somewhere you could hold a conversation over the softer music. It wasn’t Dean’s vibe, but it was less busy and easier to get a drink there.
Even the two cups of coffee he’d already had this morning hadn’t woken him up sufficiently. Perhaps that should be expected. He was emotionally exhausted in a way caffeine just couldn’t touch. Cas actually felt better than he had all week, but he was still tired. The persistent racing of his thoughts had slowed. The niggling sense that something bad was about to happen seemed to have finally vacated the home it had made for itself in the back of his mind. He was calm but drained.
Cas looked both anxious and expectant. He sat down on the edge of the seat, legs still outside the car, before Dean pushed him back, further inside and then down until his head hit the leather. He climbed in after, insinuating himself between Cas’s legs, one hand on his chest, stroking over his heart. He was still for a moment, just looking down at him, as if deciding where to start. Then he just dove for his mouth and kissed him hard, hands going to the buttons of that damn dress shirt he always wore, frantically undoing them, the last few ripping off in his haste, the buttons pinging into the corners of the car. Dean pulled back to watch his face before he moved onto Cas’s pants and undid them with equal speed. Cas shifted his hips up slightly so Dean could pull both pants and underwear down to his thighs. Dean took him in his hand and then he just froze for a moment, stared at the wonder of his hand on Cas’s cock. His hand. Cas’s cock.
“You sit.” Cas pointed to the chair that Dean was still half in. “I’m cooking for you for once,” he said firmly.
Cas lay there, feeling raw and dirty, not good dirty, but the cheap & used kind of dirty. He listened to the sound of water in the next room. Dean was hogging the shower and it didn’t seem like he was invited, so he cleaned himself in the blink of an eye with his angelic powers. That way he only felt grimy on the inside.
“People want to give us money to follow their husbands around instead of talking to them, I say we let them. It’s their business if they want to be idjits. It’s our business to investigate the cases we catch,” Bobby said.
Nothing was actually on fire, so Dean figured it was safe to leave Cas to it since that was what he wanted. He went to hang out with Sam in the Dean Cave. They ended up watching The Goonies, because anything that had the Rudy hobbit in it got Dean’s vote.
One side of the bed was still free. He stripped to his own boxers and got under the wonderfully un-scratchy quilt.
“Anyhoo, I found someone dreamy too,” Charlie told him, pointing to a pretty woman on the other side of the room.
He just smiled at Cas and walked over, putting his hand on the small of Cas’s back as they went inside. Sam headed straight for the bar to get them drinks, while they hung back near the entrance. Dean gave Cas a brief one-armed hug and settled his hand on his hip, gently squeezing him to his side. It was nice to be somewhere where this was unremarkable. He would probably be this affectionate with Cas in any bar, because, fuck it, he could handle himself in a fight. But as much as he was confident in his ability to stand up for himself, he appreciated that they were in a space where he wouldn’t have to. No one would make some asshole comment about them or try to start a fight just because they were two dudes here. Dean felt a surprising sense of belonging in spite of the cheesy pop music playing.
“Cas,” Dean said and scooched over on the sofa to draw the other man into his arms. Cas leaned on him as he stroked his back and whispered to him how strong he thought Cas was, what an amazing person he was, how proud Dean was of him. A while later, Dean continued, “So, I take it that you didn’t really get the jellyfish because you think it’s metal that it can live forever?”
Dean and Cas were still smiling at each other a minute later when the waiter finally bellied up to the table. The service there was as bad as the food. It was the same creepy guy as last time and Dean only just stopped himself from threatening to punch the guy in the face if he affirmated him again. He ordered the shitty vegan pancakes since there was nothing better on the menu, though without the bacon this time—vegan bacon was an abomination.
“Well, that too, but mostly I wanted to believe that if I DeLoreaned myself back to 1969, I’d have a shot with a young Robert Plant.”
Cas wiped at his face and realised it was wet. Dean must have noticed his tears at the same time because he drew Cas into his arms and held him close, stroking his back.
“I… we… um… not really...” Sam made a show of yawning widely. “I should really be getting to bed,” he said and made a speedy exit.
Cas was still looking at Dean like he wanted to fuck him into next week and Dean prayed he would, into next week, into next year, into the next decade and beyond. He was so glad to have this. To get to see the soft, silly side of this serious man. He knew Cas's willingness to joke was a sign that he was getting comfortable with him again.
the things that had happened to Cas still hurt him. They hurt a lot less than they used to at least. He could go great stretches of time without thinking about them at all. But, sometimes, something would happen to remind him of the old days and he’d discover the pain was still there, dull and faded perhaps, no longer sharp and pressing, but still there nonetheless.
a painting of the icon based on a still from a Western he’d starred in. The piece had a black and white Elvis frozen in a pose where he’d just pulled his gun, the barrel pointing out at the viewer. The image repeated three times and got fainter each time, like Elvis was becoming a ghost, or fading out of existence like Marty McFly almost did when he messed up his parents’ creepy meet-cute.
Sam was overreacting- the turducken hadn’t nearly killed Dean, only almost turned him into a mindless drone ripe for the slaughter. Anyway, it wasn’t Sam who’d almost been zombified, so he should shut up about it.
Not that it was any better the one time he had shared a tent with someone he knew was interested rather than disgusted. It was almost worse, to be in that tempting nylon bubble, to have the illusion of being in their own little world while the reality was that only thin fabric separated them from disaster. Lamplight could cast shadows that would condemn them. Noises could be all too easily overheard. Sleeping in each other's arms was impossible when anyone could burst into their tent at any time.
He slid one hand up from Cas’s back to his head and pulled him in for another deep kiss. Cas groaned and thrust against him lazily. Dean moaned in return and finally let go of his death grip on Cas to shove his coat down over his shoulders.
It’s not like you’re Sherlock. You knew my first and last name, of course you figured out who I am! Sam said you worked in TV. I thought he was dating an actor called Richard who lives in San Francisco, not a business owner called Gabriel who lives in LA!” Dean felt a little foolish, but he’d already found Cas’s brother—he had no reason to keep looking into Gabriel once he knew how to contact him. “And I thought you changed your name to Loki anyway.”
Dean’s own nerves dissolved under the confidence he got from knowing that Cas wanted him. So, he sounded a little cocky when he said, “I know, Cas, I know what you need.” And damned if he didn’t want to give it to him right here but he didn't want to fuck Cas in a bar bathroom. Well, ok, he
John had grabbed Dean by the collar and started yelling angry insults at him, quickly graduating to physical blows when Dean didn’t react to words. Even then, Dean hadn’t done anything, too numb to fight back against the sudden violence. Sam had grabbed John’s arm, trying to protect Dean, even though that wasn’t his job. John had backhanded him across the face before going back to hitting Dean while Sam sat, stunned, on the dirty floor where he’d landed.
Sam didn’t answer, just made a noncommittal noise and took a big gulp of whisky. Dean figured maybe Sam wasn’t sure if he was
“That does sound like something Meg would think was funny,” he said with a long-suffering sigh. “This ‘costume’”—Cas did actual air quotes around the word. Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen someone so hot be so dorky, it was kind of endearing—“was a lot cooler when I thought it was inspired by Bowie and not Puddles the bloody Clown.”
Cas finished the eggs, even though they were cold and rubbery, because the food felt like a peace offering from Dean this time. He appreciated the effort, but the eggs felt like they were sitting in a hard lump low in his belly and somehow, simultaneously, like they were obstructing his throat so he couldn’t take a full breath. Dean kept flashing him concerned looks across the table. Repentant Dean might actually be worse than remorseless Dean. There was something so impersonal about his regret. It felt like he was the kind of sorry you were when you broke a co-worker's coffee mug, rather than the kind of sorry you were when you broke your husband’s heart. This awkward solicitude was cutting deeper than the earlier disdain. He had to get out of there.
And Cas laid there, breathing hard, looking up at him, as if Dean would be the answer to all his prayers if he’d just move that damn hand! So, he did, stroking Cas up and down, hesitantly at first, then with a little more conviction when Cas began to moan. He knocked his hands away way all too soon and Dean was disappointed until he  realised  that Cas was reaching for
It started off slow and tender, and by the end, it was fast and still somehow just as tender. It felt like the sex was more emotional than either of them expected, or even intended, it to be. Cas was thrusting hard inside Dean, his movements forceful, but one of his hands was linked with Dean’s, fingers intertwined where they rested next to Dean’s head. Every so often, he’d lean down and kiss Dean or just look deeply into his eyes as he fucked him. Dean shoved his hips up just as hard to meet Cas’s body but squeezed the fingers of Cas’s hand in his gently.
“Nothing to be sorry for. This is how I like to wake up, with a big, hot, hard dick pressed against me.” He winked lasciviously.
“Thank you,” Cas said, smiling for a moment before his face fell and he tilted his head questioningly. “Wait, was that a compliment or do you think my home looks sterile and impersonal?”
“I was there. I promise you, you were totally willing,” Sam assured him with a smile in his voice. “Honestly, it was kind of cute how excited you were to get married.”
They finally entered the bedroom a moment later and Dean pulled Cas down on top of him on the bed, relishing having his solid weight covering him again. Cas kissed him thoroughly before moving down to suck marks along Dean’s neck. He continued moving lower until the progress of his mouth was hindered by the collar of Dean’s stupid mesh t-shirt and he seemed to realise they were both still clothed.
But maybe their failure had been the real reason for the task, or at least as much of a factor in sending them out as the idea that they could attract more young people to the Church.
“Right? It’s horrific, but the idea kind of got under my skin. That people would be punished for such a thing. What kind of sadistic God would do that? Make someone suffer so much in their life that they ended it, and then what, God’s mad that they didn’t pass some test? That the pain was too much for them, and then instead of their suffering being over, being welcomed into God’s loving bosom and comforted, they’re tortured for eternity.” Cas made a small, sad sound. “There were a lot of things that made me lose my faith, but that was a big one, the sheer cruelty of God. Either God doesn’t exist or he’s a being so unfathomably inhumane that I don’t want anything to do with him.”
The problem with coming your brains out was that it was a temporary thing. The come cooled, the tingles faded, your brain reconstituted itself and instead of thinking about how much your maybe-boyfriend turned you on, you realised that he'd never actually said that he missed you too, not really. Cas saying he missed Dean’s body wasn’t quite the same as him saying he missed
He sounded embarrassed, like he’d been caught doing something he shouldn’t, but Cas was flattered. Not everyone thought being a tattoo artist was a meaningful job, and it meant something to Cas that Dean was interested in his work.
Cas looked like the conversation was giving him a headache, even though Dean was pretty sure angels didn’t get those.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re hilarious and we’re leaving. Why don’t you try to find that guy you were eye-fucking earlier and see if you can get your own bathroom blowjob?”
He scrambled back into bed next to Cas and starting spreading peanut butter on a slice of toast. When he was done, he poured a ridiculous amount of syrup on it and handed it to Cas.
“That’s what I said, but I can hardly be blamed for the erection if you will climb on top of me and start wriggling around!” The infuriating man had the nerve to sound exasperated.
“I’m sorry,” Cas said sadly. “If I had realised the spell would mess with your head like this- if I’d have known what it actually did- I would have left you with Sam and gone to hunt the witch myself. I never meant to cause you distress.”
each other? It had started off as a one-night stand and while it was more than that now, he wasn’t sure exactly what it was. Perhaps it was just ongoing sex without strings, a series of one-night stands. He thought they seemed to be friends at least, so perhaps they were friends with benefits.
“In the time we’ve known each other, you’ve made yourself a better person, Meg. I've just had the privilege to witness it,” Cas told her seriously.
“I love you too,” Dean said. Cas glowed at that and went a little blurry. It took Dean a moment to realise Cas was blurry because Dean had gone all teary eyed. He cleared his throat self-consciously. “What would you call it then?” he asked, just for something to say, so he could focus on talking instead of crying.
By the time he set needle to skin, the atmosphere was surprisingly relaxed and Cas was deep in a very interesting conversation about bees with Cain. That lasted a while before they lapsed into a comfortable silence for the rest of the appointment.
“She was the bisexual badass who investigated crimes to help build a case for the defence lawyers. At least, she was a badass for six seasons, and then they ended up replacing her with that douche Jason in the last season. Fucking travesty!”
Cas did as he asked, thrusting even harder, over and over at that perfect angle. Dean cried out and came untouched for the first time. He gasped and slumped back on the pillow. Cas watched as expressions of desperation, followed by bliss, then sleepy satisfaction played over Dean's face. Then, he buried his head in the crook of Dean’s neck and moaned as his own orgasm overtook him after a few more thrusts.
“Are you kidding me? I didn’t know plaid shirts and cowboy boots were an option for a gay doll costume! I totally would have come as Gay Bob if I’d known!” Dean was going to have to find an opportunity to dress up as Gay Bob. Finally, an excuse to buy those cowboy boots he’d been wanting!
Cas thought he was one of the few people that Dean let himself be vulnerable around. It felt like a privilege for him to see the unguarded side of Dean that Cas was pretty sure he normally only allowed himself to show to Charlie and his family.
Sam made a face like he wasn’t quite sure how Cas taking on his memories of hell meant he had to eat turducken now, but, dammit, Dean was eating it, so Sam was eating it too and no one was saying a bad word about it to Cas!
He hung up. Then he just sat there for a long time before going back inside. He wasn’t going to make an escape in fucking PJs and slippers. The damn sheep skin mules were the only shoes next to the door, they fit fine but shoes with no back weren’t really suited to running. Besides, Sam had told him to stay put. He might not trust this Castiel guy but he trusted his brother.
“Pfft, I don’t run. And the added height gives me a more commanding presence, so foot soldiers know they should fear me. Right, Cas?”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut tightly in embarrassment for a moment. When he looked back at Cas, he was smiling at Dean. So, maybe Cas liked him despite the chronic case of foot in mouth that being around him seemed to bring out.
“—Abby will understand.” She raised her eyebrows suggestively. “And I have ways of making it up to her if she’s upset.”
Meg flounced out of the room, leaving the connecting door open. ‘Guided by Angels’ came on over the speakers and Cas looked at Meg to see she was fiddling with her phone as she walked over to Alfie. He wondered if she’d just added the song to her Spotify queue or it was a coincidence.
Dean wondered idly. No, that was dumb, and definitely something you’d need to see a doctor about if you were still alive, because if you thought your heart was orgasming that was probably a heart attack, or maybe a mental disorder. Dean’s brain didn’t seem to be functioning properly right now. Okay, heart orgasms were stupid, but he just didn’t have the words to express how this felt, even in his own head. Fucking Cas was so much more than cocks and come and bodies. He felt it in his heart, he felt it in his soul. Being with Cas this way was like being remade. Dean knew who he was becoming was so much better than who he had been. The problem was that you had to be taken apart before you could be remade, so there was a moment in the process of metamorphosis where he was just utterly broken. Cas held Dean together while he cried softly and told Cas he loved him over and over.
“Oh my God, your face, it’s even better than I expected!” Gabriel—Richard, whoever he was—crowed, before explaining, “Richard’s my middle name. No one but Cassie calls me Gabriel anymore.”
“I know you said you only wanted me for Christmas,” Cas said to Dean softly, “but since you already have me, I got you something else too.”
Cas looked flattered by the question rather than embarrassed for him, so Dean didn’t feel like he’d messed up too badly. But asking the question like that did kind of make him feel like the ditsy, awkward lead in a bad chick flick. Cas put down his cocktail and leant towards Dean, cupping the side of his face with one hand.
Yeah, that sounded good. As fun as making out on the couch was, Dean wanted to move to the room where the lube and condoms were. They scrambled up from the couch and made their way through the apartment.
book and if it could possibly live up to the wait. And if it would go in a better direction than the show had. Which led to them discussing whether they thought the prequel series,
Cas leant in to press a chaste kiss to Dean's lips and then stepped back. He laced his fingers through Dean’s and led him to a different part of the museum to see another of his favourite works. They walked around a few more rooms before deciding to call it a day.
Dean grumbled. As far as he was concerned, his reaction was totally proportionate to the situation. It hurt deep down in his soul to play a trashy pop song in Baby, but he’d do it, he’d do it for Cas.
They chatted companionably for the rest of the drive, one of them occasionally bitching when they disagreed with something the other said but good-naturedly, just arguing in the way that family argued. It was comfortable and familiar.
“But I didn’t even bring it this time. It was already here after last time. We always have lube, Dean.”
Leaning against the kitchen counter as he waited for the kettle to boil, Dean smiled as he watched Cas watch TV. It was downright cute, the way he focused so intently on the events unfolding on screen.
Cas clung to Dean for a long moment before he realised what he was doing and pulled away. Dean didn’t need to see him like this.
Sam wandered into the library while Dean was sitting on Cas’s lap. He looked a little surprised by his brother's position but didn't say anything. Frankly, Dean thought he should be grateful they had all their clothes on. Ever the nerd, Sam reminded them there was reading to be done. Cas, who was rather more diligent than Dean was at the moment, agreed that they should get on with the research they’d abandoned yesterday. Sadly, sitting in Cas’s lap wasn’t really the best position for getting work done, so they’d all gone to sit at the table. Dean sat next to Cas as they researched and it was the same as any other day except Cas's chair was closer to his and Cas's hand was resting on his thigh as they read.
Dean thought they were the best scrambled eggs he’d ever had because Cas had made them for him, but he didn’t want to say something that disgustingly cute out loud.
He gave Dean’s hip a warning squeeze, reminding him to stay still, before he released it in favour of taking hold of Dean’s cock. His other hand kept up its teasing as he leant down and took the head of Dean’s cock in his mouth. Cas swirled his tongue around the tip languidly. The dual sensations of hand and tongue made Dean moan and Cas smiled around his cock at the sound. He swallowed more of Dean’s length down as he slowly pressed a finger inside him. Cas pushed the single digit in and out gently until he felt Dean relax enough to take another. He moved his fingers unhurriedly, working Dean open while he sucked him. Cas crooked his fingers slightly, rubbing them more firmly across his prostate. Dean was panting and coming apart under his attentions. He made a desperate sound that was almost a sob. Cas drew back his head and removed his fingers carefully.
The day had been just as much fun as it was every year. Dean had helped Ellen cook up a feast of roast beef, mashed potatoes, gravy and various side dishes. Then he’d taken over the kitchen to make a metric shit-ton of mince pies.
Cas broke the kiss and looked down at him curiously, cautiously. The morning sunshine had limned his head with a golden glow and the sight made Dean’s breath catch in his throat.
It had been a comfort to Dean as a teenager—the idea that the rock gods he’d always assumed got all the women they wanted, maybe wanted men too, that maybe that was a thing, wanting men and women both. It had been nice to think he wasn’t the only one who felt that way. When he was fourteen and trying to figure himself out, he’d never met anyone like him. Or, at least, they’d never stayed in one place long enough for him to get close enough to anyone to have conversations about anything so personal as their sexuality. Thinking that maybe some of his heroes liked guys the way he did had made him feel less alone.
“I think I’d have to take it slow,” Cas said. “Draw it out and make it last. Tease you, touch your whole body before I so much as lay a hand on your dick. Run my tongue over every single inch of your skin. Suck your nipples until you’re squirming beneath me.”
to sleep, he had gotten into the habit of it. Mostly because he liked to curl up next to Dean. He would miss Dean when he was awake and Dean was sleeping, so he’d started joining him in bed for more than sex. It was peaceful. Sleep broke up the days so his life wasn’t just one long forever. He normally only slept when Dean slept, which was certainly more than an angel needed but still less than a human did. He always tried to keep Dean in bed longer, long enough for him to get a proper rest. Right now, though, he was going to sleep alone because it turned out sleep was also a useful way to take a break from arguing with your husband.
They hadn't had sex since their fight. They’d held hands, they’d hugged, they’d snuggled on the sofa watching TV, they’d slept in the same bed, they’d kissed, but they hadn’t fucked. Dean thought Cas had been keeping his distance because he was still reluctant to trust him. As much as the idea of fooling around with Cas was exciting, more than that, Dean hoped that Cas wanting to get naked with him meant that Cas felt safe with him again, that intimacy meant trust in this case.
Dean glared at him as he slid into the booth next to Cas. He switched his glare to Sam when he saw that he was grinning too.
“That's how it should go,” Dean insisted, shrugging. “It's not like you’re suddenly the expert in getting into the Christmas spirit just because you put up some lame tree.” He looked pointedly at the scraggly artificial tree sitting in the corner of the bunker library, the trunk wonky and the tinsel threadbare.
“Shut up, Sam.” Dean could hear his brother laughing his way to the kitchen as he ducked back inside his room.
Cas laughed again, and the sound was so warm and intimate that Dean didn’t feel stupid at all for his lack of phone sex finesse. It felt like Cas accepted the different sides of him. He was as happy to laugh with Dean when he was being awkward as he was to flirt with Dean when he was being sexy. His laugh turned into a sigh and Dean thought he could hear the sound of skin on skin on the other side of the phone.
The cheesy pop music had faded far into the background and all Dean could hear was the sound of his own heart thudding in his ears. His brain felt staticky and his fingers vaguely tingly. He leant across the table and placed a chaste kiss on Cas's lips. At least that was what he planned, just a light touch, a promise for more, later, when they're alone. But he couldn’t help opening his mouth a little, sliding his tongue between Cas's lips, just for a taste, a tiny taste... He could taste the damn stupid cocktail he’d brought him and he could taste something even sweeter that he suspected was just Cas. It wasn’t long before he felt drunk on the kiss and barely holding onto control. When he realised he'd dragged Cas halfway across the table, he let go of him and fell back into his seat. Breathing heavily, he stared at Cas’s dazed face.
Jesse made a thoughtful face like he was storing that information away for later before turning back to Dean. “I wouldn’t knock old married couples. You know they just leave places early so that can go home and fuck already?”
represented a greater cosmic truth than a real person and thus counted as the ‘actual’ Amy Pond. “Anyway, I’m taking the other Kaylee home. Excuse me while I go fuck myself.”
“C’mon, Cas, this is meant to be a party, a jamboree, a fiesta! We’re supposed to be having fun and making merry, and here you are, moping about like you’re the sad clown at a discount funfair.”
He pulled his bulky brown leather jacket on. Partly because its loose cut meant it fit over the first jacket easily and partly as a bit of a fuck you, because it was his dad's old jacket and, boy, would he hate it being worn with this gay ensemble.
“Sorry,” Cas said, looking a little abashed. “I wasn’t sure if you’d know. We got this place after we married as somewhere for us to come alone. I thought maybe the spell wouldn’t let you remember things like this, things linked to our life together.”
Bobby had paid over the odds for the twisted hunk of metal—an excuse to give John some money to help him look after the boys—and hauled the mangled car back to Kansas. Bobby had said that it seemed like the most convenient thing to do at the time since he knew someone with a truck who’d transport it to his junkyard for cheap, but Dean knew that wasn’t true.
“Me and Meg too. I was so annoyed. I mean it’s the twenty-first century and, what, the twenty-third on
Sam raised his eyebrows and then just sat there shaking his head, confused, whatever he was looking at on his laptop forgotten. Dean’s attention was all for Cas though.
Gabriel was sitting in one of the cheerful, little pastel green booths. He was wearing a shit-eating grin that rubbed Dean the wrong way. He gave them a jaunty wave while they stood there perplexed. A moment later, Sam emerged from the back where the restrooms were. He waved at them too before going to sit next to Gabriel.
But he was also just a man who knew what he wanted and what he wanted was to enjoy one of the few gay club nights that played music he liked, in the main room anyway.
“I think I’m going to go for a walk,” Cas said and blinked out with a rustle of feathers and a gust of wind.
He reached for the bottle and poured himself another drink. Hopefully the safe sex lecture was over, at least for now. It would probably continue to be trotted out perennially, though.
He woke about an hour later judging by the episode on TV. The screen showed Spike laying siege to Sunnydale High School.
Dean tore the wrapping off his own present and immediately regretted it. He shifted uncomfortably and tried to use the crumpled paper to obscure the gift while he glared daggers at his brother.
“You, uh, really gave the liquid dimension in that drop of drool.” Dean pouted. “You're very talented, but it’s not exactly flattering.”
Cas groaned as Dean’s come covered both of them. He pushed Dean flat on his back and shifted to kneel over him. Releasing Dean’s cock, Cas swiped a hand through the white liquid on Dean’s belly and coated his own cock with it.
Dean choked on his drink. Choked in a totally sexy way. Choking can be sexy, right? Well, maybe choking on a big, fat cock, choking on your beer less so.
“What the fuck?” Dean said as he looked back at the tunnel, which was now entirely black. “What happened to all the colours?”
Part of him wanted Cas to fuck him slow and gentle with all the tenderness he could sense in the other man, to look deep into his eyes as they joined together. And part of him just wanted Cas to flip him over and plough into him from behind, just pound him into the mattress hard and fast and almost impersonal because the immediate connection they had was disconcerting for Dean.
That didn’t sound like the husband he knew... but it did sound rather like the young man he’d first met years ago. The man Dean might still be if Cas hadn’t been in his life.
He sighed and it was like all the warm satisfaction gusted out of Dean’s mouth, leaving him feeling hollow and cold.
Cas flowed to his feet and smiled at Dean. He had a drop of come hugging his full lower lip. Dean reached up to brush it away with his thumb. Cas caught his hand before he could wipe it off on his jeans as he’d intended. Instead, Cas leant in to lick the come from Dean’s thumb. He moaned blissfully like it tasted of goddamn honey and sunshine or something. Dean wondered if that was what spunk tasted like to angels and they didn’t get the same salty stuff everyone else was stuck with. Maybe it was just what Dean tasted like to Cas. Or he tasted like molecules but Cas liked Dean’s molecules best. Either way, it warmed something inside him. Dean kissed him and tasted himself. He definitely didn’t taste like honey. But that was fine because Cas was still sunshine, bright and pure, warm and nourishing, the wellspring that made life itself possible.
The man raised his thumb and licked it as Dean watched avidly, then wiped it over the teardrop. The eyeliner smudged, leaving him with a smear of red sparkles across his cheek. Dean continued to stare, transfixed, before it occurred to him that this was definitely more staring than was socially acceptable. He tried to shake himself out of his daze and find something to say.
“Put your hands up,” Cas said, nudging him when the lyrics instructed those up in the club to do so.
“You know, you’re more likely to die driving the Impala than you are in a plane crash, and you’re not scared of that.”
The room wasn't really big enough to flatter the dark shade, but it did suit Meg. Cas thought the darkness would look cosy rather than oppressive by the time they were done. And if not, he was sure Meg would rope him into painting it another colour.
“So? I called you a twink when you were his age,” Meg said, continuing to go through supplies on the shelf in the corner.
“Can I buy you a drink to commiserate?” Dean asked, seeing his chance. They were still leaning against the bar, so he signalled the bartender and got them both a beer when Cas agreed to the drink.
“Right, right. I’m cool,” Charlie assured him and gulped in air. “Ooh, I wonder if she'd cosplay as the actual Amy Pond too? I bet we’d have so much fun at comic-con!”
“Hey!” Dean objected automatically and then made a face like he wasn't sure if he should be offended or flattered. After all, Wash and Mal were both equally awesome, but he couldn't help thinking that being a captain was just sexier. Captain Kirk, Captain America, hell, even Han Solo counted as Captain of the freaking Millennium Falcon if you wanted to be technical about it. Dean shrugged off the comment and stepped up to Charlie, poking at her dress. “Are you really wearing a hooped skirt to a club, though?”
It was stupid, just a flash of a familiar-looking man through the shop window. Cas knew it wasn’t him, but he’d still had to root himself to the spot and cling white-knuckled to the counter to stop himself from running outside and going after the man. Meg had to snap him out of the daze he was in when it looked like he was going to continue to stand there frozen all afternoon. He’d had to cancel his last appointment that day because his hands were shaking.
Dean liked the sound of that, not just the being fucked hard part, the home part, like he was going home to
Cas tuned back into the conversation to hear them talking about footwear as they walked over to the couch.
“I was a twink when I was his age,” Cas said shrugging. He didn’t have anything against the term. He’d been skinny, boyish and very gay when he met Meg at eighteen. The term fit. “But he’s not gay and I think he feels like you’re mocking him when you call him that.” Cas lowered his voice, not wanting to be overheard. “He’s not the most macho guy. Maybe he was bullied about it at school. And you know how teenagers are, calling people gay like it’s the worst insult they can think of.”
He writhed against Dean slightly, not having the leverage to thrust properly, as he clearly wanted to.
“You’re thinking of Thanksgiving, sweetheart. There isn’t normally a game on Christmas,” Dean said, leaning up against the counter next to Cas.
It was probably obvious to Dean that Cas wasn’t telling him everything about that period in his life, what the piece had meant to him personally or how he’d already been thinking about the idea that suicide was considered a mortal sin before he’d ever heard of
“Jesus, Charlie, are you trying to give me a heart attack?” Dean yelped as he turned to face her, a hand clutched over his chest.
“Fuck!” he gasped. “That was... fuck... that was awesome, Cas. Just give me a minute and then I’m gonna return the favour.”
“Okay, so this was several years ago, I saw this YouTube video by Caitlin Doughty. Have you heard of her?” Dean shook his head, so Cas continued, “She has a channel called
Cas sniffed it thoughtfully before taking a sip, which he valiantly managed not to spit out when Dean asked him, “So, what kind of guy do you think you'd like? Leather daddy, twink, bear, otter?”
‘I’m free tonight,’ Cas typed before he could talk himself out of it. He felt both guilty and glad when Dean replied to his text straight away.
“Dean... Dean, I need you,” he whimpered, looking absolutely helpless under the force of his lust, unsure what to do with feelings stronger than anything he'd experienced before, confused by unfamiliar urges.
“True, but, unfortunately, I couldn’t convince Cesar that he should blow me in the bathroom just because we’re young and not husbands yet!”
“Hey!” Dean objected. “I’m a complicated guy. I can have more than one reason for doing something. Maybe I think Cas needs to get laid and,
Undeterred, the drunk guy took a clumsy swing at Dean which he easily dodged. Dean stepped back instead of forward but he couldn’t help clenching his fists, unsure if it was in anger or preparation for a swing of his own. Cas put a hand on his shoulder. It was a light touch, meant to comfort not restrain. Dean could restrain himself. There’d been a time when that wouldn’t have been true, but he had actually matured, as unconvinced as Sammy was of that fact. He probably would have hit the intolerant asshole in his younger days, especially if he was with a guy he thought might enjoy having his honour defended. While punching him would be satisfying, it wouldn’t be a fair fight. He was a hunter, it was never a fair fight unless the homophobe happened to be a Navy SEAL. Besides, he didn’t want to end a nice day with his husband by getting into a brawl. He wasn’t sure if he was going to have a choice though because the other man took a threatening, if wobbly, step towards them. Cas reached out and touched the guy’s forehead, causing him to fall back and look dazed. Dean watched bemused as the man wandered away.
Cas continued on obliviously, “It’s three kinds of meat, Dean! The website said it was the perfect gift for the meat lover in your life.”
Dean may not have grown up in a cult, but Cas was aware that he wasn’t the only one who had survived a cold, uncaring and sometimes cruel father. Dean had a tendency to downplay what he had been through himself, but Cas knew his childhood had been difficult. And Dean wasn’t the only one who wished he could protect those he cared about against all the hurts of their past. Cas wished that he could have been there for Dean when his father was busy crushing his self-esteem underfoot.
“Thanks,” Dean said, taking a swig of his beer to wet his suddenly dry mouth before putting the bottle down on the bar. “Let me, ah, do the signature pose and see if that helps you get it.”
Hauling a broken old car across the state definitely hadn’t been the easiest solution. Even if Bobby hadn’t known any local scrap dealers or mechanics, it only would have taken a few calls to get someone to take it off his hands instead of paying to take it home with him. But he knew what the Impala meant to the boys, especially Dean. Bobby still denied it, but he’d saved the car for him.
Dean had spent a long time coming to terms with the different facets of himself. Yeah, there was the butch side (and that wasn't just overcompensating, a man could appreciate fast cars and frisky women just because he liked them), but there was also the side of him that occasionally wore panties and appreciated a good lavender outfit. The two sides were equally him and equally valid. And he rocked both those leather jackets.
They both stood there for a moment, smooshing their fingers into Charlie's petticoats, like the weirdos they were, until Charlie dropped her hand and raised her gaze to run it over Dean’s outfit.
“Sometimes.” Maybe it didn’t increase his serotonin, but it did make him smile. The tattoo had become something of a talisman. Cas had a tendency to reach for it in times of stress, gripping his left forearm with his right hand when he was anxious, or running his fingers over the inked lines to soothe himself, tracing the patterns as if he was counting beads on a rosary. It always brought him comfort. The tattoo was like a reassurance from his best friend that everything was going to be okay. “Most months,” Cas continued, “I managed to scrape together enough for my meds. They helped a bit until I could afford therapy, which was much more useful.”
Dean should have known better than to admit anything, especially when Sam was home. He should have been paying better attention to John’s mood, but John had only had a couple of beers. He was at the relaxed stage of tipsy, rather than the mean stage of drunk that Dean knew to watch out for. He should have remembered that John’s mood could turn on a dime, though, especially when he’d been drinking. It didn’t take much for him to get angry, even when he wasn’t six beers in.
“What? I was trying not to make a fuss, you jerk. I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable, okay? You never talk about this stuff.” Sam put a hand on his arm and squeezed. “But seriously, I’m happy for you and I'm happy you told me. And if you want to talk, I'm right here.”
“It is, but I like tattoo as a medium. Some art lasts for centuries, but that's the minority. No matter how talented you are, so much is luck and a myriad of other factors, most artists aren't ever going to be Van Gogh or da Vinci. Art can be ephemeral rather than eternal. What I do, it's not going to last for centuries—”
“Merry Christmas, gorgeous,” he said and kissed Cas on the nose simply because it was the closest place to plant one on him. The action made Cas cross his eyes as he looked down to where lips touched him and Dean laughed at the face he was making. Cas looked adorably confused and Dean pulled him closer for a proper kiss. When he drew back, Cas’s look of confusion had been replaced with a soft, satisfied expression that was slightly dreamy. Dean brought his hand up to gently stroke Cas’s cheek. Just lying here next to Cas, he felt more content than he’d ever been.
“Cas,” Dean sighed, his left hand plucking at his nipples as he imagined Cas’s hands and mouth on him. Cas perfectly playing his body like he was a damn maestro, like he’d studied how to make Dean’s blood sing at Juilliard.
“C’mon, Cas. Don’t look at me like that,” Dean said, ducking his head to avoid meeting his eyes, afraid if he looked too closely that Cas wouldn’t like what he saw.
he silently told his reflection. He’d get Dean back, he knew that, but the waiting was awful. Perhaps it was undignified for a being who was millennia old to hide from his own husband, but he stayed in the bathroom for another fifteen minutes pretending to clean up. Dean wouldn’t know the shower wasn’t necessary, so he stepped under the overly hot spray and stood there until it ran cold.
“No,” Cas said firmly, meeting his eyes for a heartbeat. “It’s not your fault. We’re both responsible. You should have said something, but so should I. It was just nice not to have you pushing me away...”
Bobby had come to visit them in the small town of the month to help out while they recovered from the accident. When he found out that John had been driving drunk, he’d lost his shit. It was one thing to risk his own stupid neck, but to endanger the boys, how could he do that? Of course, John had gone straight into defensive mode—he’d only had a few drinks, he knew how to damn well drive a car and the accident was the truck driver's fault, he could take care of his boys and it wasn’t any of Bobby’s business. Bobby had insisted John get help with his drinking and John had insisted that Bobby fuck off.
“No, that’s fair,” Cain said with an easy smile. “I don’t think the answer to hate and violence is really more hate and violence, but I can certainly understand the impulse.”
“Smell ya later, bitch.” She threw him a quick Vulcan salute and made her way back to Amy as quickly as she could manage while navigating a crowded club in a giant-ass dress.
When it did come, the touch was light, fingertips ghosting over his hole, soft amidst the frenzied passion of their kisses. The same hands that had shoved Dean up against the wall were gentle now. Cas drew back to watch Dean’s face as a single digit pushed inside him. Dean rocked down to meet the intrusion. Cas's fingers opened him up slow and sure. There was a tenderness Dean had never felt with someone who wasn’t already a lover, someone who was almost a stranger, though he didn’t feel like that.
He didn’t remember the cabin but maybe the place looked sort of familiar. He still didn’t know where anything was though.
“And it’s selected you? Sorta weird, how you’re the one thing I don’t remember... suspicious even...”
“Because you love me and you want to make all my boyhood dreams of a gorgeous guy proposing to me in a hot air balloon come true,” he joked, rubbing his hand over Jesse’s shaved head.
He could feel the angel’s eyes on his back as he stomped over to the bed and pulled the duffle out from under it. Dumping it on the mattress, he riffled through it until he had a pair of jeans and an olive-green shirt. He went to change in the bathroom because the angel was still staring at him. Dean felt a little less vulnerable when he emerged properly dressed. Wearing pyjamas in front of a stranger felt far too intimate, even if they covered just as much as jeans. Right, real pants accomplished, now what was he supposed to do? He looked around the cabin but there just didn’t seem to be much in the way of entertainment. There was small bookshelf against the wall opposite the couch. It was piled with books, a mix of novels and occult texts, but Dean didn’t think he could focus on reading right now. He felt restless and edgy.
“You do realise that calling him my boyfriend really isn’t an insult when we’re clearly together? I know we’re in a relationship. I'm not going to be offended if someone points that out to me.”
Since that night as the bar, without really discussing what it meant, they had fallen into a relationship. They had already been so close that, in some ways, not much had changed, but the changes there had been were wonderful. During the day, they were even closer than they had been. Cas always scooched his chair right next to Dean’s when they researched now. He curled up with Dean when they watched TV in the evening. He lay his head in Dean’s lap on the rare occasions that Dean actually had a chance to read a book that wasn’t research (the head in the lap thing was far too distracting if he was supposed to be working). There were affectionate touches and long looks that Dean knew there'd be follow through on now- when Cas looked at him like that, he was actually going to get laid. At night, they slept together, or Dean slept, anyway, while Cas watched over him. Sometimes they fooled around, sometimes they just cuddled, but they always spent the night in the same bed. Then, in the morning, they had breakfast together. Dean came up with new strange foods for Cas to try: bacon drizzled in honey, cinnamon toast crunch with hot sauce instead of milk and some expensive dark chocolate flavoured with chili peppers that he’d bought specially for Cas. Admittedly, chocolate wasn't even remotely a breakfast food but Dean liked starting the day watching Cas experiment to see what flavours he could actually taste. He was always so pleased to find something he liked and Cas had enjoyed the combination of heat and sweetness in the chocolate.
“You know you can take the finger off,” he said, bumping Cas’s shoulder with his own. Dean had only really bought the silly thing as a joke but Cas seemed to be treating it very seriously. He had switched the finger over to his left hand while he ate his hotdog but still had the foam digit pointing out towards the field insistently.
He put his phone on speaker and Cas kept talking as Dean squirted lube in his palm and spread it over his dick. His touch was gentle and unhurried, not wanting this to be over too soon. Cas’s voice was like a caress, raising goosebumps on his skin.
Pies aside, Dean wasn’t even sure if he should get Cas a Christmas present or if it was too soon for that too. It didn’t feel too soon to him, but maybe it would to Cas. It didn't matter. He probably wouldn’t get to see Cas to give him a gift before he flew out on Tuesday, anyway. A plane ticket would definitely be an inappropriate gift at this juncture, right? Dean just wished Cas was coming with him. And not just because he was flying alone since both Sam and Charlie weren’t flying out till Thursday.
Dean stepped closer. He took Cas’s hand and slowly drew him in. Cas’s look of uncertainty made something squeeze in his chest. How could he have made Cas doubt him like this? Doubt the strength of his love, the existence of it at all? Dean reached his other hand to Cas’s cheek, a light cautious touch because he felt uncertain too. He didn’t deserve Cas, doubly so because he’d hurt him, left him unsure of his feelings.
Dean shimmied out of his boxers and leant over the side of his bed to grab lube from his duffle bag. He found himself wishing he’d brought a dildo with him too. There were a couple in his bedside table at home. He rarely bothered with them when he jerked off, but pretending a dildo was Cas's cock sounded even better than pretending his hand was Cas's hand.
Sometime in the nineties, Mattel had decided that Barbie’s boyfriend needed to be cooler. They designed a new doll with a look inspired by the club scene. Unfortunately, nobody at Mattel had realised that the clubs they were taking inspiration from weren’t straight clubs.
They talked about Dean’s job for a while. A topic he was passionate about. Eventually, Dean’s nerves settled into a quiet hum in the background that mixed almost pleasantly with the excitement and anticipation he was feeling. He grew more comfortable as the conversation went on. Cas was easy to talk to—well, easy to talk to once Dean relaxed anyway.
Cas held the door open for him and Dean grinned at him before he went through. He pulled up short when he saw who was sitting opposite the door. Cas bumped into him and put his hands on Dean’s hips to steady himself before looking over Dean’s shoulder.
“Pops didn't approve of ‘those Hollywood types’.” Gabriel did some very Cas-like air quotes that made Dean smile. “I'm pretty sure he meant the gays, though equally it could have been liberals or atheists or whatever other godless people he'd decided were involved in entertainment.” He shrugged. “So, we didn't have a television growing up. Cas was a good kid who just put up with being bored, but I always snuck out to watch stuff at my friends’ houses. TV was an escape from what was happening at home, you know?”
At least there had only been one time when he had run after the other person shouting and grabbing his shoulder to turn him around only to find a confused stranger staring back at him a touch belligerently. It had been years since that happened though,
Dean shrugged. Plenty of people had it worse, Cas for one, going on what little he’d said about his family. But living with John had affected his self-esteem pretty badly, Sam’s too.
Cas leant over and kissed his smiling mouth goodbye. Then he spent all day wondering what he should suggest doing that weekend. What did people do on dates? How was Cas supposed to know when he very deliberately didn’t go on dates?
dick-” Dean's lips cut off the sentence, but Cas wanted to ask if it was just any dick Dean liked waking up with, or if it was actually
“It’s just toast and coffee but I brought peanut butter and grape jelly for the toast. I know you like PB&J...”
“Teardrop tattoos only mean you’ve killed someone if you’re in a West Coast gang,” he answered seriously. “And even then, only if they’re not drawn on in eyeliner,” he finished with a slight quirk of his lips.
but modern art needed to be taken on its own merits. Much of it had a beauty unlike what had come before.
pretty metal. But no, I lied before when I said that my tattoos don’t mean anything,” he admitted. “I guess the jellyfish was for similar reasons as the tardigrade. It represents survival and rebirth. The immortal jellyfish has this weird life cycle where it can regress to its infant stage and then grow up again. I kind of felt like that when I left home. It was starting over to such a degree that it was like being reborn.”
“So impatient,” Cas teased, smiling down at him indulgently. “If I promise to fuck you hard and fast later, will you let me make love to you slowly this time round?”
They both lay limp and panting for a long time before Cas pushed himself up on his elbows. He looked down at Dean and stroked his fingers softly over his cheek. Dean smiled up at him. Their bodies were still joined, but it felt like the connection went deeper than that.
bad.  Besides, Sam had no one but himself to blame for putting the mistletoe there in the first place. Unsurprisingly, the decoration was gone later that day. The mistletoe had reappeared the next day. This time it was over Dean’s doorframe,
“I didn’t say I didn’t watch it. Only that it’s not why I want a tardigrade tattoo.” Cas rolled his eyes. “Of course, I watch
Once his lust clouded brain started working again, Dean realised that he’d been sitting on Cas for a long time. Sure, he’d just been thinking about how much lighter he was but that was purely metaphorical lightness. He was still a pretty big guy.
Cas watched the interaction and found himself wondering if Abby did actually have a soft underbelly. He knew the exterior Meg presented to the world was similarly sharp-edged and vicious, but once you got close to her, you could see her true self beneath all that thorny pain. She was beautiful, a better person than she would ever give herself credit for.
Late on Christmas Day, Dean stripped to his boxers and flopped out on the single bed in his childhood—or he supposed teenagehood—bedroom. It was exactly as he’d left it when he moved to San Francisco. The walls were plastered with posters of Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Metallica and other old-school rock bands. It looked more like it had belonged to a teenager from the eighties rather than one from the twenty-first century. Dean didn’t need his own room at Bobby’s anymore, but he thought that Bobby and Ellen knew how much it meant to him to have a home to come back to and he appreciated it.
“Well, I was in the boy scouts as a kid. Pretty rough crowd, real troublemakers. Nearly started a turf war with the girl scout trope the next town over. Big plans to steal their cookie stash. Wanted some of that sweet, sweet Samoa money. Couldn’t find a getaway driver though.”
They had never convinced anyone new to join the Church. It didn’t seem like they had done anything meaningful at all. He wondered if his father had ever expected them to achieve anything on those assignments.
“Your duffle’s under the bed,” Cas told him, sounding perfectly reasonable in a way that rubbed Dean wrong, because how was he supposed to know where he kept his damn duffle if he had amnesia!
“It’s a guilty pleasure,” Dean snapped at Sam, then shook his head and pointed a finger at him. “No, you know what? I’m not guilty, it’s a great show!”
“Yes... No! Cas isn’t some hookup. We're...together... like a thing, with feelings and stuff,” Dean said, shrugging awkwardly.
Dean was aware of the lube still lying on the mattress. He thought about coating his fingers with it and pushing them inside Cas. But that was something he really thought you should ask before trying. His mouth was so delightfully full of Cas's cock and he didn't want to stop what he was doing long enough to have a conversation about doing more. Probably better not to overcomplicate things the first time round anyway, better to focus on one new thing at a time. So, he focused on Cas’s cock, taking a little more of it into his mouth. His hand was still wrapped around the base, so he only took in another inch or so. As well as this was going, he didn’t think he was ready to start trying to deep throat Cas like a damn porn star. Dean rubbed his tongue along the underside of Cas’s cock as he guided the head toward the roof of his mouth. He sucked lightly and felt Cas tense beneath him, so he did it again and kept up the movement of his tongue. The frequency of Cas’s moans increased until he made a particularly loud sound and Dean’s mouth suddenly filled with come. Despite this being the outcome Dean had intended, the burst of liquid still felt like somewhat of a shock, though a good one. He pulled back and swallowed hastily.
This chapter was going to be longer but unfortunately life happened, stupid life. Dean will be returning the favour in the next chapter though.
“There’s a word in Enochian,” Cas said, before making a series of garbled noises that Dean supposed counted as a word in the angelic language.
“And the weapons?” Dean forged on. “Or is this holy lube? I just squirt it in a demon’s eye and it burns ‘em?”
Dean wiped himself off with a t-shirt rather than crossing the hall to the bathroom and risking an awkward encounter. He didn't need to bump into Bobby while covered in come… again.
Cas went off and bustled around the kitchen, getting pie from the fridge, finding a plate to serve up a slice, putting coffee in an old percolator, and he didn’t stare at Dean the whole time he did it. Dean sat down at the small table and watched the angel for a change. Perhaps he should find him more homemaking stuff to do because this was almost comfortable.
“Do we though?” Sam asked sceptically. “Since when do we celebrate New Year? And since when do you actually care about celebrating it?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “I’m just saying. Air travel is extremely safe. You do stuff that’s more dangerous all the time without freaking out about it.”
Dean paled enough to make his freckles stand out starkly and Sam’s eyebrows jumped so high that they just about went off his face.
“I think I’d rather go the other direction. Everything is bleak as you walk forward, but when you come out the other end, there’s light and beauty you couldn’t see when you were going through it.”
They made their way to the bedroom leaving a trail of scattered clothes behind them. Once naked, Cas let himself be tumbled onto the bed under Dean. He revelled in the sensation of Dean’s body covering him, pushing him down into the memory foam. The mattress was somehow even comfier in the afterlife. Dean’s bed was covered in a plaid comforter that reminded Cas of his own bed back in the bunker. He wondered if that was deliberate, if Dean had wanted to feel close to him, to think of this as their bed and hope that Cas would join him here. He ran his hand over the soft fabric.
molecular structures incorporated into his honeycomb tattoo. They’re the neurotransmitters typically affected by antidepressants.
“If the ambience you're going for is dull, then it’s working,” Sam bitched. “If you’re going to play crap just because it’s seasonal, you might as well put on New Year’s Day by Taylor Swift.”
Of course, he’d offered to share it with Sam, since the Impala felt like it was equally his as a Winchester, but Sam had little interest in cars (weirdo) and felt like Dean’s investment in fixing the car outweighed his own stake in it. Sam told Dean the Impala was all his, but the sneaky deal-making lawyer-in-training had leveraged Dean’s guilt over having Baby all to himself and he’d ended up being Sam’s personal taxi throughout high school. Sam was a giant dork, so it had mainly been lifts to the library.
Cas returned the kiss gently. Dean was caught between the urge to savour his tenderness and the urge to push it away, to demand they fuck hard and fast, two bodies joining, nothing more. His heart got in the way though, his heart always got in the way. The walls came crashing down because his heart reached for Cas. He didn’t just want two bodies joining, he wanted two hearts meeting, two souls mating.
“Sometimes, a bee is just a bee, Dean,” Cas said, before continuing, “But, also, and don’t tell Meg I told you this,” Cas looked around the room like Meg might have snuck in to eavesdrop and lowered his voice, “it’s covering up a wonky bit on one of the hexagons. Meg hadn’t been tattooing very long when she inked this. Probably no one else would even notice the flaw in the linework, but she’s a perfectionist. It drove her nuts, seeing the crooked line every time she looked at my tattoo, so we decided to cover it up with a bee. But, if Meg asks, tell her I told you that it’s to thematically tie the tattoos of the honeycomb with the flowers.”
Since his input into breakfast didn’t seem necessary, Castiel shuffled silently into the bathroom. Dean had given Cas back his phone when he found his own in his duffle yesterday, so he took it with him into the small room. He turned the shower on so he wouldn’t be overheard and rang Sam.
Cas probably wasn’t seeing things. He’d thought he’d seen someone he knew. That was all. It happened all the time. It was just a coincidence, someone who looked similar. Nothing to worry about, but worry he did because that’s what happened when you had an anxiety disorder. So, maybe he was going a little crazy. Though he knew Ash would tell him not to call it that. Mental health conditions didn’t make you ‘crazy’, which Cas thought was a lot easier to say as a therapist than as a patient.
“No, no... I'm touching you. I need to concentrate- I can't concentrate if you're doing that,” Cas explained.
Terrible nineties pop filled the room, as annoying as it was catchy. Charlie continued to look confused as Dean clipped a silver hoop earring onto one ear and looped a necklace over his head. The large chrome ring dangling from the chain settled low on his chest. Dean moved his arms stiffly, one held upright and one in front of him, both bent at the elbow, like he'd frozen in the middle of doing the robot. He tilted his head slightly and unfocused his eyes, his expression going eerily blank except for the rictus grin plastered on his face.
Cas, still fully clothed, was lying on his side curled into Dean. His hand was tracing swirling patterns on Dean’s naked chest, which was moving up and down rather rapidly. Dean, who’d been looking up at the ceiling in a daze, turned to Cas.
It was too much with someone he'd just met, or maybe not enough with someone that it felt like he'd always known, with someone who felt like he could so easily slot into Dean’s life, like there was a space there just waiting for him.
Cas had disappeared shortly after the gift exchange and they’d left him to it. That was until a bang and something that smelled suspiciously like smoke had emanated from the kitchen. Sam and Dean had gone in to investigate and found Cas standing in the middle of the kitchen looking sheepish. Sheepish and adorable actually. God knew where he’d found it, but Cas was wearing a ridiculous frilly floral apron. Dean thought it suited him oddly enough. It felt very homey, Cas in the kitchen cooking for him in a silly apron.
Dean was back in five minutes flat with a wooden tray loaded with toast and coffee. He kicked the door open and shut, then carried it over to the bed where Cas was lying in the exact same position he’d been in when Dean left. Oh, he looked so good in Dean’s bed. Balancing the tray carefully, Dean climbed in beside him.
Dean was sure the guy was going to walk away then, but he just raised an imperious eyebrow at him and calmly said, “No,” before continuing conversationally, “So, since we’re getting to know one another, how many people have you killed and what are your gang affiliations?”
Camping was a favourite among his peers, but Castiel hated it. Rather than representing any kind of freedom, getting away to the woods had only meant the same rules were militantly enforced in a different location. The trips had been meant to promote wholesome male bonding and encourage embracing that fiercely masculine role of the all-American outdoorsman. It was all about toughening up and learning how to be a man. Unfortunately, the trips had only served to make Castiel realise he would never be the man his father wanted him to be.
They arrived at the stadium in good time, so Dean took a moment to buy Cas a baseball cap and one of those silly foam fingers. He brushed Cas’s hair back and plunked the cap on his head, then put the foam finger on him. Once Cas was kitted out, Dean led him to their seats and settled in.
Meg slept in his bed that night. She insisted that it was to escape the fumes, but Cas wasn’t convinced. Meg could be impulsive, but the sudden paint job seemed rather conveniently timed, not to mention that she could easily have slept at Abby’s place. Cas suspected that she’d heard him cry out in his sleep last week, but she didn’t mention his nightmares, so neither did he.
“Trickster TV,” Gabriel said, looking gratified. “It’s a production company. We’ve done a few different shows now, but the latest thing I’m working on is
“What on earth have you got to be sorry for?” Dean snorted and shifted his weight so he wasn’t lying quite so heavily on Cas. “I think you could do whatever you want for the rest of eternity and you'd still never need to apologise to me!"
The guy was just in a black tee and dark jeans, but he looked amazing in the simple outfit. The colourful tattoos on his arms stood out against the plain clothes. He was sporting an undercut, his hair messy where it was longer on top. Dean couldn’t tell what colour his eyes were, but even from this distance, they looked intense.
It had been a long time since Dean had woken up next to someone he cared about. A long time since he’d woken up next to anyone at all. His head was still foggy with sleep and his eyes were still closed but he could feel Cas’s presence next to him, radiating warmth and comfort. Waking up next to Cas was somehow simultaneously an absolute surprise and the most natural thing in the world. Dean snuggled in closer to the pliant body beside him and felt Cas’s arm tighten slightly around his waist.
“Bon Jovi rocks,” Dean defended himself as he turned the car key and Baby rumbled to life. “On occasion,” he clarified, pointing an emphatic finger at Sam and pulling away from the bunker.
There were a lot of memories in this place, Dean thought as he got out of Bobby’s truck and looked up at the old house. He was filled with gratitude that he could call it home. He walked through the door and Ellen called out hello when she heard them all traipsing inside. She hugged him as soon as he entered the kitchen and then told everyone to go wash up because dinner was ready.
“Well, he preserved her head and shoulders, but she had cuts on her skin from where she’d been pulled out of a river. He couldn’t get rid of them, so he disguised them by turning her into this sort of diorama. He added preserved snakes and made it look like they were strangling and biting her. It was supposed to be a representation of the way suicide victims went to hell and got punished for eternity for being fucking depressed. I guess laws about what you could do to random corpses or moral decency weren’t a thing in Italy in that day and age.”
That sounded like heaven. So, Dean put his head on Cas’s thighs and kicked his feet up on the far end on the couch. He looked up at Cas and yawned again.
Cas had seen Ash regularly for a couple of years and Ash had encouraged him to come back if he needed it. He didn’t want to need it. Cas had done the work—he was supposed to be better now.
‘Marvel at the blur of their tiny feet,’ she sang when they tidied up the shop before they left. ‘The world's greatest guinea pig athletes,’ she belted out while she tattooed a photorealistic skull on a big, burly biker who she’d somehow persuaded to sing the backup refrain of ‘guinea pigs!’ every other line, which was surprising enough in itself, but Cas definitely hadn’t been expecting him to do jazz hands on the final, triumphant
Mostly, the people who congregated in the foyer were sipping drinks, waiting for friends or just enjoying listening to the godawful music. The playlist for the room was described as ‘pop guilty pleasures’. It was true that they sometimes played one or two of Dean’s own guilty pleasure songs there, but mostly he thought the foyer was just the fire he had to walk through to get to the main room with the decent music.
magazine had been a problem. John hadn’t even gotten mad straight away. He’d held the magazine distastefully between his thumb and forefinger, arm extended as far away from his body as possible, like he thought the magazine might detonate at any moment, which was sort of the truth. That magazine had blown the three remaining members of the Winchester family apart.
“I’m fine, woman,” Bobby grumbled, but Dean could tell he secretly liked having his wife fuss over him a little bit.
Dean had been reading the same page for an hour. So, it was a relief when Sam finally said goodnight and went to his room. That meant they could go to theirs...well, Dean’s room really but somehow it already felt like theirs because Dean wanted to sleep next to Cas every night now.
“Right?!” Dean said, throwing his hands up emphatically and sloshing his beer about. “I mean, come on! That's pretty gay. They have to know what they're doing!”
Despite the whole don’t-ever-darken-my-door-again bullshit, John still expected a favour from his old friend. He didn’t have the money to fix the Impala, and John had been pissed that the local scrapyard had only been willing to give him two hundred bucks for it. So, he’d offered the car to Bobby, like John was doing
As it turned out, Dean hadn't done a lot more to Cas when they got home. After the drive back, the initial adrenaline and urgency of their first encounter had ebbed and Dean wondered if he ought to be taking things slow. He had taken Cas to his room and slowly stripped him out of his clothes, most of his clothes anyway. He had left their boxers on. They had gotten into bed and simply cuddled. Cas had seemed happy just to be close to him and Dean, well, Dean Casanova Winchester had actually been hesitant to take things further. He was kind of nervous... a lot nervous... sort of paralysed by fear in fact. Being God's gift to women didn’t really guarantee also being God’s gift to men, or, more specifically, to Cas.
Maybe Dean wouldn’t be as compassionate as he was if he didn’t know how it felt to be treated so coldly. Though it was hard to imagine that Dean wouldn’t still be the kind, generous man he was today, no matter how he’d grown up.
The kind of experiences that Cas enjoyed tended to vary wildly. He liked doing new things and spending time together but, other than that, there were no requirements. Cas loved both the sublime and the mundane with equal passion. Dean had seen him look at a mini golf course with the same expression of awe he’d had when he looked at the Grand Canyon. They had taken a trip to the famous gorge last year and Cas had been delighted. He stood staring at it for a good half hour before turning to Dean and saying simply, ‘It’s so big, grand indeed,’ and then suggested they get on with their hike. A month later, Dean had taken him to Tee-rific Mini Golf a few towns over. Cas stopped in front of the windmill obstacle and marvelled at it until the people behind them got impatient. ‘It’s so tiny and yet the sails really turn, ingenious,’ he said, smiling at Dean before hitting his ball through those spinning sails and getting a hole in one.
Dean ran a hand down Cas’s spine and made an appreciative noise when he rocked back impatiently, so maybe he was watching him after all.  He was gentle when he entered him. Cas felt full, all the way down to the very core of his being. Dean paused, luxuriating in the feeling of connection while giving Cas a moment to adjust. When he moved, he set just the right pace, and hit that angle that made Cas moan and let go of his worries. He had been overthinking things. They’d been together for years now, Dean didn’t need to carefully study his reactions anymore to know how to please him. It wasn’t long before he was clawing at the sheets mewling.
“No, but I’m sure your new friend wouldn’t mind giving you mouth to mouth if you need to be resuscitated!”
He could hear Dean humming in the kitchen. Apparently, sex was fine as long as it was Cas who was tricked into it, not Dean. No, that wasn’t fair, he hadn’t tricked him. Cas had just assumed that renewed affection was equated with restored memories. He leant against the sink, taking deep breaths and trying to regain his composure.
"Dammit, I'm not talking to the car, Cas! I'm talking to you. The car’s been here the whole time. Where were
“He said he was too close to the witch to come now. He... uh... also had some choice words for me. He pointed out that I may have been a dick-”
“Yes.” Cas took their joined hands, raised them to his lips and softly kissed Dean’s knuckles. “I was planning on finishing that old Men of Letters report I’ve been reading anyway. I’ll be in the library.”
“I didn’t mean in real life. It’s a joke on the show,” Dean explained. “People think Spike is imitating Billy Idol, but he actually had the look first. There’s an episode with a flashback to Spike in the seventies and he’s full-on eyeliner-and-safety-pins punk in it. I think it’s in season five.”
seemed like as good a distraction as anything else. As they watched it, they chatted about who was the sexiest vampire, Spike or Angel. They both fell firmly into the Spike camp. Dean would have put in a vote for vamp Willow too, but he didn’t want to spoil the surprise before they got to that episode.
Dean doubted he was really going for a walk since he hadn’t exactly strolled out the front door. He probably just wanted to avoid Dean, which made him feel like a jerk. He realised this was the first time he’d seen Castiel use his powers since that display of wings when he’d lost his temper. Perhaps, after his reaction to the shadow wings, Cas had been trying to put him at ease by acting more human. So now, he was either sick of making an effort for an ungrateful asshole, or too upset to remember to tamp down his angelic nature, which made Dean feel like an even bigger jerk.
“We can add another one to my Titanic tally. I think I’m winning now. If it can be called winning.” He shot Dean an exasperated look.
Dean’s most constant companion as a child, apart from Sam, had been his favourite TV shows. John was hardly home, when they had one, and had been more than happy to leave his kids to be raised by the television. As they travelled more and more, there hadn’t been much else to do when he and Sam had been left alone in motel rooms in towns where they didn’t know anyone and had no money to go out.
Dean liked penetration, but he'd never come from that alone before Cas. Something about Cas fucking him was better than bottoming had ever been with anyone else. Everything with Cas was better than it had been with anyone else. He wished Cas was there with him now. Wished he was there kissing him and filling him up. And Dean wished he was there to hold him afterwards so he could fall asleep in his arms.
He felt worse for failing to feel better. Unresolved trauma, Ash had called it. Leaving the situation might work for some people. Just having space might be enough for them to heal. But that certainly wasn’t always the case, nor was that necessarily the likely outcome. A wound that wasn’t treated could easily fester, and ignoring it wasn’t a solution. Which was fine in theory, but sometimes he hadn’t been able to do anything but ignore it and that was a hard habit to break when it had been his main coping mechanism for so long.
For a moment when he got here, Dean thought it would be okay, that he really had made it to heaven. Bobby had been sitting there waiting for him. He’d told him that Cas helped fix heaven. When he said ‘he'll be along,’ Dean had thought he meant Cas, not Sam. Not that he hadn't wanted to see his brother but it was Cas who was missing when he got to heaven, it was Cas that would make it perfect. Dean had faith that Sam was alive and that he’d be happy. He was in no rush for his brother to join him here in the afterlife. He was desperate to see Cas though. Losing him like that, seeing him taken and knowing he was going to the Empty, a dark place where Dean could never reach him, it was unbearable. More than anything, he needed to see Cas. He needed to know he was okay. He needed a chance to tell him how he felt. Even without all the unresolved issues between them, Cas was his best friend. He should be here. It wasn't heaven without him. He couldn't be happy without him.
A diamond-shaped space on Cas’s arm was covered in little hexagons. They were inked in black apart from a few coloured small shapes within the design. There was a purple hexagon with a pentagon attached and a couple of lines that zig-zagged off it following the path of the honeycomb pattern and ending in little dots. A similar blue hexagon was set to the side above it with a few blue lines coming out of it. Below and to the opposite side was a green hexagon with three lines branching out from the corners.
“I’m not sure horns constitute a costume for you, Pazuzu. It’s more like an aspect of your true form has broken through the veil.”
We’re filming it locally. That’s why I moved. We’re thinking of doing all our filming out here. It’s cheaper than LA without having to go all the way out to somewhere like Vancouver. I mean, who on earth wants to film in Vancouver?”
Bobby had always been protective, of course, but Dean hadn’t been accustomed to it anymore because they hadn’t spoken much since the falling out. John wouldn’t let Bobby see the boys and it had been hard to stay in touch by phone.
Cas smiled in the darkness. Dean liked it. Maybe this did qualify as a good idea for a date. He pulled Dean closer by his hand and gave him a quick peck on the lips.
Alfie looked less than impressed by this concession. Cas knew that teasing was just Meg’s nature and, in this case, she didn’t mean any harm by it, but he hated that it was making Alfie uncomfortable. Cas felt rather protective of him.
Maybe it was a little unusual for Dean to be this enthusiastic. Maybe it was even a little unusual for him to be this happy, but he was going to damn well enjoy it. Like Christmas, New Year’s Eve didn’t normally mean much to him. Despite all the new beginnings and dumb resolutions stuff people touted, it was just another day and shit usually stayed the same. Which was fine actually, because Dean happened to like how things were most of the time. But this year felt different. The future was unfurling in front of him. It was bright and good and full of Cas and love and happiness and things Dean hadn't thought that he'd get to have, hadn’t even really felt like he deserved. It felt like a new beginning. Sappy as that was, Dean was going to make the most of it. And making the most of it right now meant celebrating a holiday he didn’t usually care about, because it turned out he did care if he got to share it with Cas.
They both shook their heads at him before going back to what they were doing. Meg sipped her coffee and Cas stirred the eggs. He frowned down at the pan uncertainly, but seemed to decide the eggs were done because he took them off the heat and started spooning them out over three pieces of toast. He carried two plates over to the table to put in front of Dean and Meg. They both thanked him and Cas smiled and then went back to grab his own plate before sitting down. Cas made a face when he took a bite of the eggs and looked at Dean.
Sometimes they were ridiculed on general principle and sometimes they were angrily retaliated against by people they’d offended first. No one really liked hearing that they were sinners who were already damned, so it probably wasn’t surprising that most people reacted to the insult with varying degrees of hostility.
“Role playing? We’re not role playing!” He looked down at the guy, horrified, and belatedly realised what he could feel pressed against his stomach.
Why was there a picture on the bedside table of him, arm around some guy he didn’t recognise? And why were they wearing tuxes?
Heaven wasn't meant to hurt this much. Dean had begun to suspect he was actually in hell. Perhaps it had gotten an upgrade since he was last there. Now there was a hundred percent less flaying and hundred percent more pain. Purely psychological torture that cut so much deeper than Alastair's knife ever had.
“If I'm stuck here, can I at least have some real pants?” he asked and tried not to wince when it came out sounding like whining.
Meg smirked, not remotely offended. Cas had been teasing her about being a demon almost as long as she’d been teasing him about his stupid angelic name and choir boy past.
Dean respected his need to let the subject of their shitty childhoods drop and jumped on the new topic. “Order in? I don’t know about you, but I don’t have the energy to cook tonight. We could get Chinese. Or did you have your fill of that at Christmas?”
“Ooh, let’s listen to some queercore,” Charlie suggested enthusiastically. “There are more queer musicians out there than Mercury and Halford.”
Grabbing the lube, Dean set to work gently preparing Cas. He eased a lubricated finger inside him, moving slowly in and out until Cas’s body was relaxed enough to accept another. He pushed his fingers a little deeper, gently pressing to find the right spot. He heard Cas’s sharp intake of breath as he found his prostate and rubbed against it.
The clothes had seemed fine before he left his apartment, but now he was at the museum, and it was too late to do anything about it, he wondered if Dean would look at what he was wearing and feel like he hadn’t made an effort for their date. Weren’t you supposed to dress up for dates?
“They are practical—I went with the 3-inch heels instead of the 5-inch,” Abby said. “These are my fighting boots.”
the light. They were offered salvation and willfully turned their backs on it. Mocked those who tried to offer them a place in the Kingdom of Heaven. They judged you. They corrupted you. You were better off staying within the Church, where it was safe, where people were good and knew the truth. And did not question that truth.
Cas didn’t need to do a whole lot to get him off. It was enough for him just to stand there. Standing was good because this was supposed to be for Cas and Dean didn’t think that getting the angel to blow him in a skeezy bar bathroom was something he was doing for Cas’s sake. The idea seemed blasphemous somehow, or, at the very least, obscene. Of course, that kind of turned him on more. Normally, he’d be all over Cas and blasphemous acts. He really did love getting Cas all filthy. Lately, though, he was feeling protective. The idea of leading Cas astray scared him. What if he went too far, did something that crossed the line from fun debauchery to flat out degrading? There was something about Cas that was so good and so pure. He didn’t want to soil that. He didn't want to hurt Cas again.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “I must say you acquitted yourself rather well last night for someone who’s not good at this.”
Dean was driving himself just as crazy as he was Cas, so he withdrew his hand. He poured more lube into his palm and coated his length with it. Cas was watching him, so he gave himself a few extra strokes just to feel the heat of Cas’s eyes on his cock. Finally, he pushed inside him slowly. He paused for a moment, letting Cas hold him in his most intimate embrace. This was where he belonged, in Cas’s arms, in his body.
“Look, I know you’re not happy here but it’s getting late, let's just stay tonight. If you still want to, we can go back to the bunker in the morning. Maybe you’ll feel more comfortable there.”
“I only go by Loki professionally. A mononym gives me a certain cachet, like Lizzo or McG.” Gabriel winked before continuing, “And I used to live in LA, but I live here now. I still keep a pied-à-terre in LA since I have to go there so often for work. That’s probably why your little FBI friend found an address for me there.”
He had left home just before he turned eighteen and arrived in San Francisco damaged, socially awkward and utterly alone in the world. It had surprised no one more than Meg herself when she’d taken Cas under her wing shortly thereafter. On the surface, they seemed to be opposites, but dig only a little deeper and they were kindred spirits.
thing that made Dean realise he wasn’t straight, but it was certainly a contributing factor to his teenage bisexual awakening.
He was obviously delighted at the prospect of making future plans with both their brothers, especially plans that involved edible food. And Dean liked to think that the diner where they’d had their first date had a special place in Cas’s heart, just like it did in his.
“I’m not sure this music really fits your current aesthetic,” Charlie said, quirking an eyebrow at him.
“I’m not buying it. I don’t know you,” Dean insisted, glaring at the unhappy angel. Castiel was looking back at him intently, like he could make him remember with the power of his damn laser beam stare. Which actually...
Dean slipped carefully out of bed, doing his best not to disturb Cas. He stood in the bedroom doorway for a moment, just looking at him. Cas’s face was relaxed in sleep, making him look younger and less intense than the man he’d met last night, vulnerable even. Dean felt lucky to be allowed to see Cas like this, at peace, without his guard up. It was the sort of quiet, private moment that only a lover usually had the privilege to witness, and he wanted more of them.
t-shirt with an open black leather jacket over the top. His favourite chunky biker boots completed the outfit. They weren’t as high as Abby’s 3-inch fighting boots, but the extra height normally made him feel more confident.
Dean hurried to comply because he really, really wanted that too. Cas removed his own clothes with alacrity. He draped his body back across Dean’s as soon as they were both naked and captured his mouth again. Dean clung to him, pulling his body even closer before he realised what he was doing, it felt dangerous to be this desperate for Cas. It scared him to want someone so much.
me like one of your French girls’—people like saying that to tattoo artists,” Cas said as he stepped away from the stove to put bread in the toaster.
“Hey,” Gabriel piped up, “if we’re going to make it a regular thing, Cas and I should get turns to pick too.”
“Right, right,” Dean said distractedly and moved out from under Cas to grab condoms and lube from the bedside table.
“He knows I’m hella queer, right? Why would I use gay as an insult?” Meg asked, finally turning to face Cas.
Or maybe the fact that they liked each other, were having sex and went out together for dinner and drinks and other activities that could reasonably be called dates meant that they were actually dating, maybe they were actual boyfriends who just hadn't had the relationship talk yet. Hell, maybe Cas referred to him as his boyfriend to other people because that status would be patently obvious to anyone who wasn't Dean Winchester.
“Okay, let’s get into the spirit of things,” Dean said, grabbing his phone since he didn’t have what he wanted on cassette. “Siri, play New Year’s Day by Bon Jovi.”
Cas smiled and followed him over. Dean sat in the corner and Cas chose to sit in the middle next to him instead of the other end of the couch. He settled comfortably into the leather, pulling one knee up, elbow leaning on the back of the couch and angling his body toward Dean. He put his beer down on the low table in front of them while Dean held onto his so he could gulp it down anxiously. His habitual awkwardness with men had usually dissipated by now, but something about Cas made him nervous as hell.
He had a brief moment of fuck-what-was-I-thinking?! Before he remembered what he had been thinking, that Dean was good and kind and someone he could trust. Cas cared about him and wanted to spend more time with him. And he could damn well get past his anxiety to do so.
Meg watched him thoughtfully across the table. Studying his face, he assumed, for signs that he was spiralling again. Presumably, she found none since she nodded approvingly, like she was giving his plans the green light. While Cas welcomed the distraction sketching provided, he didn’t feel the same desperate need to bury himself in that distraction that he’d been feeling all week. He thought Meg had picked up on the change. She always did see right through him.
Dean was lucky he was married to an angel because no mere mortal would be able to tolerate his bullcrap. Cas had been forced to put up with more than normal lately. The amnesia incident, aka the most recent time Dean had been a total dick, had only been a few weeks ago and Dean was still mired in guilt. It wasn’t entirely his fault. You’re not technically responsible for the things you did under the influence of an evil witch’s spell, right? The problem was that even if someone had taken a few scoops out of his melon, well, it was still his melon. He might not have had all his memories but he still had his asshole personality. So yeah, the shitty behaviour, that was all him, only the circumstances were the witch’s fault.
Dean led a slightly bemused Cas over to the dancefloor. He had no idea when the last time he danced was, it felt like years ago. He was pretty sure Cas had never danced at all. Dean started moving and nodded at Cas encouragingly for him to do the same. He’d definitely never danced before. Cas was, well, he was terrible. He was an absolute fucking disaster. But he was a beautiful disaster and something in Dean’s chest went all gooey from watching him. Cas danced awkwardly, his movements uncertain and stilted, but with a hesitant smile on his face. Every so often he’d look at Dean enquiringly, as if to ask, ‘am I do this right?’ He really wasn’t, but Dean enjoyed watching him try.
Dean dragged him toward his small house and they stumbled through the door. Dean was still frantic and Cas let himself be pushed and shoved, unresisting under Dean’s strong hands. He pressed Cas up against the hallway wall so their whole bodies were flush once more. The distance from the car, with only their fingers clasped together, had been too much. Dean took Cas’s face in his hands and just took in his beauty for a moment. Dean felt almost afraid to look away. He tried to hold Cas with his gaze as well as his hands, still scared of him disappearing.
He remembered reading an article that said that the rippling façade was inspired by the mists and waters of San Francisco Bay, but, to Cas, the crinkled lines covering the white walls made it look like a giant wasp nest with windows. Either way, it stood out amongst the looming silhouettes of the tall steel and glass buildings around it.
—he was, but not only that, he had an air about him, like he was on some higher plane than Dean and all the other people down in the mud with him. He was looking out over the dancefloor like he was some creature from up on high who was untouchable for a mere mortal like Dean but, by God, did he want to touch him.
“Don’t be smart with me boy, you still gotta use protection with guys.” Bobby gave him the gimlet eye before turning to Sam. “And what about you?”
Despite the words, it wasn’t a threat. He just sounded fed up, like he couldn't believe he had to say this again. That eye roll really was too much provocation though. Dean shoved the guy, hard. Then threw himself at the other man while he was off balance, taking them both to the floor. The guy just lay beneath him, blinking slowly. Dean really needed to think ahead better because he had no idea what he should do with him now he had him pinned. Trench coat dude wasn’t even fighting back. Maybe he was dazed from hitting his head on the floor when they went down. Since continuing to pound an unknown guy- who wasn’t even defending himself- seemed wrong, Dean looked around for inspiration. There was a grey flannel dressing gown tossed across the foot of the bed, near where they’d landed, so he grabbed its belt. He wrapped the make shift rope around unresisting arms, folded between their chests, while the guy looked up at him with limpid blue eyes. He might not look concussed but he certainly seemed confused.
“What’s up, Sammy, what’s up? I’m stuck in the middle of nowhere with a sketchy angel who keeps telling me we’re married!” Dean blurted with a rising edge of panic.
Dean had loved Lisa, he really had, but that was different. The man he was when he was with Lisa was at most half of himself. He could be his whole self with Cas, love with his whole self and have someone who could love his whole self in return. The love he shared with Cas was orders of magnitude above anything he’d had with anyone else. He brushed his lips across Cas’s in a tender caress before drawing back.
He wished Cas was there with him, and not for sex, well, yes for sex, but not just that, to share the holiday with Dean, to spend Christmas together because Cas was fast becoming utterly essential to him and it just didn’t seem right to be celebrating important occasions without him there.
Dean finished his burger, since it was delicious and probably not poisoned. He glared at the angel who was sleeping peacefully in the only bed. Did angels even need to sleep? Who cared? He could sleep on the loveseat. He’d slept on worse.
“Fine!” Dean barked as he leapt out of bed and tried to muscle the other guy out of the way, expecting him to fall back, out of politeness, or instinct at least. The guy in the trench coat stayed exactly where he was, as if he were completely entitled to be in Dean’s personal space, and wrapped steadying hands around his upper arms.
kept a gun, a knife and flask of holy water anywhere he slept- just had a bottle of lube. Why the hell was there lube but no weapons?
Dean tugged Cas closer to kiss him. Cas let that continue for a few minutes before he pulled away. He worked his way down Dean’s body, licking and kissing. When he reached Dean’s waist, Cas stroked his hands down his thighs as he gently spread Dean’s legs apart. He knelt in the space he’d made between them. Dean watched him, breathing shallowly in anticipation. Cas coated his fingers in lube. His slick fingertips circled Dean’s entrance slowly. Dean whined and pushed his hips into the touch, but Cas wouldn’t let himself be rushed. He placed his other hand on Dean’s hip, holding him still.
Dean felt his annoyance at the brotherly betrayal lessen. Protecting your boyfriend, that was something he could relate to. He wouldn’t hold it against Sam... too much. He was pretty sure he could resist putting Nair in his shampoo at least—they weren’t teenagers anymore—but there needed to be some sort of retribution, didn’t there?
“Yeah, no, you don’t get to play the brother card here, dude. You married Cas so, by law, he’s my brother too. Anyway, I’m not taking sides, Dean, but you’re the one being a dick here. Cas is just trying to look after you.”
“You mentioned how much you liked the microbrew you had when you were hunting a shojo at that brewery. I thought you might like to make your own, so Sam helped me find the kit online.”
Cas was watching Dean with quiet concern. His expression was so gentle that it broke his heart a little. He knew that Cas was scared to upset the fragile truce between them. Worried that anything he said might be the thing that pushed Dean away again, made Dean push him away. He should never have let Cas go. How could he do that to his best friend? To the man he... loved. He was so scared to love him, could barely admit it to himself, never mind to Cas. He tried not to think about it as they sat silently at the kitchen table. Now was the time for drinking, not for thinking. He swallowed the last of his whisky and wondered why he hadn’t bought the bottle over to the table with him.
Sometimes Dean worried he was dragging Cas down to his level. He knew that Cas wanted to be treated like a regular person, that it meant a lot to him to be here on earth and live like a human. Cas loved mankind and he felt privileged to enjoy the heights of what humanity had to offer: love, family, friendship, art, kindness, ingenuity, a depth of emotion angels couldn’t normally feel and so much more. But Cas was also interested in experiencing the more base aspects of what being human meant. They’d never had sex in a bar bathroom before and Dean had wanted to give him new experiences. And this was what humans did, fucked in stupid places because they were horny and impatient.
“It was a compliment, sweetheart. I like the pictures. This is one of yours, right?” Dean nodded towards a sketch showing the head of a beautiful young woman surrounded by writhing snakes.
angels eat? If the answer to the latter was yes, then answer to the former seemed to be hamburgers, unless the hamburgers were just for Dean. It felt surreal, seeing an angel patiently making patties from ground beef, mashing potatoes and chopping lettuce and tomatoes. There was even bacon sizzling in a pan, spreading its delicious smell through the cabin. The whole scene was charmingly domestic and it made Dean twitchy. He was getting that feeling again, that suspicion that he was being lulled into complacency by someone serving him his favourite food.
“Hmmm, I still kinda would have liked to punch him, but not bad.” He took Cas’s hand again. “So how about that drink?”
“My relationships with my brothers were nothing like you and Sam. It didn’t feel like we were family, we were just opponents competing for the prize of our father’s love. Luke was his most beloved son for a time, but he was never very good at following the rules. He had his own opinions, questioned our father’s choices, how he ran the Church. Funny thing is, I really think Luke was trying to help father. He wanted what was best for the Church. But father just saw it as dissent. So, he moved his attention to Michael. And Michael was always so eager to please him. It worked for a while. And he certainly looked good compared to Luke, who was too opinionated, and Gabriel, who just didn’t want anything to do with the Church, even before he left. But Michael could never do enough to keep father happy. He was so loyal, and he tried so hard and it still wasn’t enough to make father love him. Instead of turning against him as Luke did, Michael just tried harder and harder. But there was no pleasing father. Eventually, as I got older, he turned his attention to me and I was the chosen one until I disappointed him too.”
Jo continued snarking at him for a while before they fell into conversation about the various challenges of being a PI. She might claim not to, but Dean was pretty sure Jo did look up to him, at least a little bit, because she listened intently to all his advice and asked him lots of questions about what kind of investigation techniques he preferred and the best way to interview someone who didn’t want to talk to you. They both agreed that the old good cop/bad cop gambit wasn’t very effective.
“I know you didn't, sweetheart, because you would never betray me,” Dean said, looking at Cas affectionately before turning back to glare at Sam. “Unlike my own brother!”
Dean stretched his neck up toward Cas. The playful atmosphere turned tender as Dean kissed him and then passionate as he thrust up and their cocks rubbed against each other. Cas rolled them until they were side by side.
“Yeah.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, still trying to get past that one. I mean, I know I'm not, not really. Plenty of things have proven to me that, empirically at least, I'm not a complete idiot. But I still
“Sorry,” Sam said again, looking not the least bit apologetic, while Gabriel laughed hysterically, leaning against Sam like he couldn’t hold himself upright otherwise.
It seemed unlikely that he was nervous about the tattoo since Cas could see a number of them on his exposed skin. Rather, Cas thought, the man was embarrassed about the tattoo he was here to get covered up. Cas had talked to him when he’d come in for a consultation last week and learned a little about his past.
Dean was glad he had Charlie to keep his mind off things. He was always emotional on the flight back to San Francisco. His anxiety was always sky high—pun not intended because he was too anxious to appreciate puns right now—but on top of that, he usually felt a little down. It made him sad to be leaving Kansas behind, even though he was happy to go back to California where he had a job he enjoyed, an awesome apartment and great friends.
They’d been in the air for a while, so Dean figured they were probably over Colorado when Charlie turned to him and said, “Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.”
Dean made a noise that might be an affirmative. That was how Cas took it anyway. He started moving around the kitchen in a flurry of angelic action. Dean watched while his back was turned. He was curious- what did angels eat?
“Shit, Cas, I didn’t mean to bring crap up. I get it, well, I kinda get it. My mom’s gone and I don’t talk to my dad anymore, wouldn’t want to, but at least me and Sam still have a home to go back to. We usually spend Christmas in Kansas with our uncle Bobby and his wife, Ellen. They’re not blood, but they’re family. Charlie comes most years too.”
“Cas,” Meg said sternly. He straightened unconsciously. It must be serious if she was using his real name. “You don't give yourself enough credit. You get awkward sometimes so you think that you're no good with people, but that’s not true.” Clearly overwhelmed by her own sincerity, she sighed and rolled her eyes in annoyance. “People like and respect you, Clarence. Deal with it.”
“You know I’m doing this for you, right?” He sounded frustrated too. “Tell me, Cas, what do you want?”
“Jeans that hug your ass like that and a Metallica t-shirt—I didn’t think it was possible, but you just got even sexier,” Dean said, looking him up and down appreciatively.
Cas grinned and unzipped his sweater, shrugging it off to reveal a Billy Idol t-shirt underneath. “Of course I like it. It’s a genre of music about rebellion. Plus, guys in eyeliner are kind of hot.”
“Why are you determined to be such an asshole?” Sam huffed a sigh down the line and Dean could imagine him on the other end, rubbing his forehead and wearing his long-suffering martyr expression.
"Well, I figured I ought to do it right. This might be my outfit for many Pride parades to come. It's got the whole get-up—the cock ring, the backup cock ring in case your partner didn't bring his own.”
Of course, it had been Dean’s fault that Sammy wasn’t safe. Sam didn't blame him for getting hurt or them running away as a result. ‘Better that we got out sooner rather than later,’ Sam had said, which only made him feel more guilty for not getting Sam out sooner.
“Oh my god,” Dean said laughing. “There should so be a mythical being that brings queer teenage boys their first cock ring when they come of age!”
Cas finally wrenched his eyes away from Dean’s face to look down as his body stiffened and his orgasm hit him. He watched as his cock spurted thick ropes of come over Dean’s own dick and torso, marking him.
“Doesn't mean it's not true,” he said, continuing to stroke Cas’s vibrant skin. “I get it, Cas, having scars. I certainly don’t think any less of you for it. I’ve got scars too.”
Dean always seemed so sure of himself, but Cas knew that only half of that was the confidence he’d managed to claw back over time and half of it was fake bravado. Dean hated being vulnerable, and admitting that he wasn’t quite the carefree man he pretended to be, well, that was something he couldn’t do around most people.
Cas smiled at him. He wiped his hand on a tissue from the box beside the bed and reached for the condoms. Cas sat back on his knees for a moment and Dean’s gaze wandered down the length of his body and then settled on his hands as he rolled one of the condoms down over his erection. He covered Dean’s body with his own again and gave him a quick kiss before drawing back slightly and shifting between Dean’s thighs. Cas looked down at his face as he entered Dean, thrusting gently inside him.
“I know I don’t have to worry about her,” Bobby continued. “She’s not gonna come home knocked up because she forgot to take precautions. I can’t say the same for you two.”
But what if Dean couldn’t find the museum? No, that was silly. He had GPS on his phone and the building was pretty hard to miss. Well, the two buildings really, since the museum was essentially two buildings smooshed together, the shorter red brick building that Cas had visited when he first came here and the new ten-story white building that had sprung up a few years ago.
Despite the insular nature of the Church, some of the other teenagers had tried to maintain a normal social life and snuck out to the occasional gathering with their heathen classmates but never Castiel. He hadn’t seen himself as a rebel. He was a good son. He followed his father’s wishes, his father’s orders, until he couldn’t any longer, until he realised how very little his father cared for him, until he was condemned and forsaken. Only then did he truly rebel and only when he had finally tasted freedom did he wish he had done it sooner.
They laughed and relaxed and ended up having to start the next episode from the beginning when they realised they’d spent the whole of it lazily making out on the couch instead of watching the show. The atmosphere was easy and light. It felt like they’d recovered from the earlier darkness of talking about their childhoods.
“That, and ‘You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor tattoo any marks on you: I am the Lord.’”
“Why? You said you're not interested in women like that, so here we are. Gay guys.” Dean gestured round the bar. "Gay guys as far as the eye can see," he said, looking at Cas very directly in a way he couldn’t quite decipher. Cas cursed the fact that sometimes he still-
“It feels like I’ve wandered into the White Witch’s castle in Narnia or something,” Dean whispered as they entered the tunnel.
“I don’t have a home to go back to, just someplace I grew up, and it’s not somewhere that I ever plan on returning to.”
Dean smiled at him, settled back into the chair and took a sip of his coffee. Meg walked out of her room and made a beeline to the French press and empty mug on the table.
Cas paused instinctively. This was the kind of thing he normally only talked about with Meg. After a moment he said, “I do think tardigrades are ‘cool’, but that's not really why I’m thinking about getting a tattoo of one.” He paused again. “It's because they can survive things nothing should be able to. Sometimes, I need to remind myself that I survived, that after what I've been through already, I can keep surviving.”
“So, how’s working with Bobby going now you’re a fully licensed PI?” Dean asked Jo once they were on the road. Jo had got her license only last month.
Maybe Dean didn't get the relationship, but it seemed to make Sam happy. Sam had worked so hard for years to become a lawyer and even though he'd achieved that dream recently, he'd immediately set a new goal. He was already focused on what he needed to do to work his way up in the firm and become a junior partner. It would be good for Sam to have someone who helped lighten him up.
“It’s the entirety of it. I didn’t want to wear a costume, so my friend practically held me down and drew it on me,” Cas told him, rolling his eyes.
“Spike definitely is,” Dean said laughing. “Do you know, he was only supposed to be in a few episodes before getting killed off? But the character ended up being so popular that they had to keep him. Gotta love a fan favourite.” He shifted to sit back up and yawned. “I think I need more caffeine. You want another coffee?”
The pie felt like a peace offering when Cas slid it in front of him. Which, even in his grumpy state, Dean recognised was a little unfair. It was probably him that should be making the peace offerings. After all, he was the one who had attacked the guy and accused him of being a liar with dubious motives for keeping him here. Cas hadn’t done anything except claim to be his husband and try to get him to rest. Well, that and stare a lot. Dean felt there was an unnecessary amount of staring. Still, perhaps he should try to be a bit nicer, a bit less suspicious.
Cas was flirting with him! It was totally corny and Dean was pretty sure that he was a bad influence on Cas if he’d started spouting lines like that but it warmed his heart. And maybe had an effect on certain regions lower than his heart. What could he say? He was easy when it came to Cas. Give him a cheesy compliment and he was blushing like a fourteen-year-old girl and getting boners at the drop of a hat like a fourteen-year-old boy.
An issue of Busty Asian Beauties was kind of an awkward gift to open sitting next to your new boyfriend. Sam was going to pay for this. When he realised it was a magazine, Dean had naively thought it would be a car magazine, or maybe Guns & Ammo. But nope, his little brother had brought him a skin mag. Worse, it was the first magazine in a subscription, so he got to feel this awkward eleven more times this year. Dean didn’t know how to act with Cas sitting right there. Sure, people who had partners still looked at porn, but it didn’t seem right to flaunt it in your partner’s face. Not unless it was something you were deliberately looking at together. And he had no idea if Cas would want to do that. Moreover, he wasn’t sure of the etiquette of looking at straight porn when you were in a relationship with a man. God, was porn etiquette even a thing? Dean didn’t want to make Cas insecure. He didn’t want him thinking that Dean would prefer to be with a woman. Dean still liked women of course. Women were great and dating a guy hadn’t switched off his appreciation of them. But he was perfectly content with Cas. He didn’t need anyone else, man or woman. He wasn’t secretly missing straight sex when the gay sex he was having was more than enough to keep him satisfied. Dean had come to realise that sex was just sex, regardless of the gender of the person he was with. And sex was even better with someone you cared about, which meant sex with Cas was the best sex he’d ever had.
After a while, Dean drew back slightly. As much as Sam had been supportive of his sexuality, he really didn’t need to see Dean grinding up against his boyfriend in their shared living space. And that was definitely where this was headed if he didn't slow down.
“Super gay,” Charlie agreed before tilting her head and pursing her lips thoughtfully. “Or they’re so straight they’re clueless?”
“It’s not something I would ever think of to do myself, but I really enjoyed it,” Dean said as they left the museum.
Dean stepped back and struck the same robot pose he had with Charlie, arms held stiffly, wide grin on his face.
“—in space,” Charlie finished. “Don't you worry, Captain Tight Pants, this dress will be getting an outing next time we go to a con. You can be Mal then. I always thought you were more of a Wash though.”
For those who didn’t watch The Good Wife- Jason was played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, so Dean dislikes the character because he looks like his dad.
Seeing Balthazar and then seeing Gabriel had shaken Cas. Even if Cas felt both reunions were ultimately positive things, they’d been hard on him. It was good to see him looking more at ease than he had in the week since he’d seen Gabriel.
“I better get going too. Someone has to keep an eye on this one,” Gabriel said, jerking a thumb at Sam, “or he’ll spend the whole day buried in briefs—and not the fun kind!”
“I’m really sorry. Can we just start over? I’ll try to do better and be less of a suspicious asshole. I don’t want us to be at odds. You seem like a nice guy, and hey, you’re dynamite in the sack!” Dean finished jokingly, trying to break the tension.
They went into the living room and Dean turned on the lamp in the corner, which gave the room a soft glow that was more relaxing than the harsh light of the kitchen. Dean put his own cocoa on the coffee table as they sat down on the couch. He turned to face Cas, looking at him intently and putting a hand on his knee. Cas held his mug in both hands and stared down at it rather than meet Dean’s concerned gaze.
“Appletini. Thought you might like it,” Dean said, shrugging one shoulder. “And maybe the situation calls for something a little more fruity.”
Dean sent him back a whole row of crying laughing emojis and Cas felt pretty proud of himself for the dumb joke. He smiled down at his phone and felt warm inside when he imagined Dean doing the same.
“Apologise to Cas,” Sam ordered. “Do it now and make it good because when you remember who he is- you’re gonna feel like shit for treating him this way.”
Dean laughed. That sounded like Jo. He was pretty sure she’d rather beat or intimidate information out of people than be the ‘good cop’. Bobby had always made him play ‘good cop’ when they interviewed people together too. Dean was only slightly better at it than Jo.
Like Meg said, tonight was supposed to be fun. He just needed some way to get out of his head, to focus on the present instead of the past.
“It’s a very nice gesture, Dean,” Cas reassured him, sitting up. “It’s not the same as when I was human but I have been eating a bit more food lately. I’ve found that I can taste it more if the flavours are strong, something sweet or spicy.”
“I know you ain’t gonna get pregnant, boy. Don't mean I don’t worry about you being careless with some girl.”
So, Bobby couldn’t call to check up on them like he obviously wanted to. Dean called him from a payphone occasionally, if he managed to find one, but the constant moving was an excuse to not call because it was hard to locate a working payphone in a new town.
Cas blinked at her, trying to shake off memories of his childhood. This unplanned trip down memory lane wasn’t helping anything. Bad enough that Cas was thinking about him again, he didn’t want to think about all the rest of it too. It was done, gone.
“How long do you think I could tease you before you came?” Cas asked, but he didn’t seem to expect an answer outside of the moan Dean gave him. “I love watching you come undone. I want to see you lose it. I want to hear you cry out. I want to feel your whole body shudder against me.”
“You need some sparkle. Be glad I only put a bit of makeup on you and didn’t insist on shoving wings and a halo on you like I wanted to.” She pinched his cheek below the teardrop. “You’d look so pretty with feathers, Clarence.”
“It’s a fine line,” Dean said shrugging. “Anyway, show me your outfit properly, you know you want to.”
“That's Poirot. Pierrot is the sad clown archetype that was popular in old pantomimes. Plus, there’s ‘Threepenny Pierrot’, the Bowie song. Pierrot was one of his stage personas for a while.”
The loveseat turned out to be damn uncomfortable and the cosy looking blanket was scratchy. He couldn’t pretzel his limbs up tight enough to be able to lie down properly, so he draped himself over both ends of the couch awkwardly for an hour before giving up.
“Yeah, of course, let’s spend the night in the love shack. Why the hell is there only one bed here any-” the sentence cut off abruptly, like Dean could hear his own unnecessarily snide tone and had actually made an effort to swallow the hostility. Not much of an effort, since that hostility seemed to be escaping through his eyeballs instead and burning a hole in Castiel.
“There is nothing wrong with you, Cas,” Dean said fiercely, putting down his mug so he could take one of Cas’s hands and squeeze it between both of his own.
“Just doodling. I’m trying to decide what to get for my next tattoo. I want to fill this space—” Cas held up his arm to display the bare skin on the back of his right forearm. Some of the jellyfish tentacles from the front wrapped around the sides slightly, but the back of his forearm was mostly blank. “—I just haven’t decided with what yet. I'm tempted to get a tardigrade.”
Cas was so close and Dean just held him there, on the edge or pleasure, refusing to nudge him over. He was fucking him a little too gently. He wasn’t touching him except for where they were joined and a hand on Castiel’s hip. The hand kept Cas still when he tried to thrust back against Dean harder. It took Cas a while to realise what Dean wanted.
Dean stretched out in the armchair and put his feet up on the coffee table too. It was his coffee table, after all, so there was no one to tell him not to. Maybe it should feel silly, sitting there in a lady’s jacket that he’d sewn a cock ring onto, but it didn’t, not with Charlie there, sitting on his sofa in full costumed regalia like it was a throne.
“I know that now, but at the time, I think I was still trying to convince myself that it was okay to be me and I suppose taking ownership of the epithet helped me do that. And it’s not like I could get a faggot tattoo,” he finished with a shrug.
Not to mention some of the DIY stick and pokes he’d seen when people occasionally tried to cover their own tattoos.
It was a fucking great costume and Dean was not pouting, not at all. Charlie shook her head fondly at the lot of them before pushing Dean towards the doors to the next room.
They made their way to short-term parking and piled into the cab of Bobby’s ancient truck. He’d been a mechanic before he became an investigator, so it was a point of pride for him to keep the antique rust bucket running.
“Day’s not over yet. We still gotta do the post-game beers. There’s a place a few blocks away I used to go to, let's head there.”
I tried to stick mostly to art that’s actually at SFMOMA, but I just couldn’t help giving Dean and Cas a dark corner to go make out in. The shipping container installation is based on
Dean felt overwhelmed, not just by the physical sensations that were causing his orgasm to feel like it was welling up from the base of his spine, but by the sentiments that were causing love to well up in his heart. His chest was so full that it seemed like those feelings would spill right out of his mouth. He kissed Cas again to stop himself from saying something he wasn’t ready to hear. When he came, it felt like the climax burst out of him, an explosion of all the emotions he was trying so hard to contain.
“Um, yeah, I think I'd like that,” Dean admitted and pushed the tray he was holding into Sam’s hands. “Can you take this to the kitchen? I'm just going to, uh, check on Cas.”
Thirty minutes later they pulled into a dingy parking lot behind a roadside bar. It looked much like the sort of places they normally drank on the road, slightly beat-up, wooden siding in need of a coat of paint, except this place had a rainbow flag in the window and the music that filtered out sounded more pop-like than their usual haunts.
Dean’s eyes sprang open. Cas’s face was only inches away and his bright blue eyes were already looking at Dean.
“He can’t hurt you anymore, sweetheart,” Dean said reassuringly, but they both knew that wasn’t true... or it was only true in the physical sense.
“What about you? I can’t place the costume,” she admitted, sounding a little sheepish because, to Charlie, not knowing something was like admitting defeat and she didn’t like to lose.
“C'mon Barbie, let's go party!” Charlie sang, oblivious to Dean’s inner musings. She grabbed his arm and hustled him out the door.
“Man or woman, it doesn’t matter. I have never loved anyone the way that I love you,” he told his husband seriously.
Meeting his wife had been the catalyst for Cain to turn his life around, to look at his own prejudices and actions and question them. He seemed appalled by the despicable things he used to believe. Cas thought the man’s regret was genuine and it seemed very much like he wanted to atone for his past. Cain was involved in a charity that worked with teenagers who were either actively involved in hate groups or at risk of becoming so. He was doing what he could to lessen the hate in the world.
“And I’m thankful for this, uh, lovely meal.” Sam had never looked less thankful in his entire life, but Cas beamed at his words anyway.
“I swear if Meg calls me a twink one more time...” he grumbled as put his messenger bag down and started shifting paperwork about on the counter, trying to organise his workspace.
“Come on, angel, get your head out of the clouds,” Meg said, her gentle words at odds with the rather hard punch she’d just landed on his shoulder.
“Just hurry up and fuck me already!” Dean said, reaching for the lube that had magically appeared on the bedside table and handing it to Cas pointedly.
It was the first time John had hit Sam. Dean usually bore the brunt of his anger, but they couldn't stay there if Sam was going to be a target now too. He’d waited until John had passed out in a drunken stupor, then Dean had stuffed what little they had into their duffels and hustled Sam out of the crappy short-term let apartment they’d been staying at for the last few months. They’d gone straight to Bobby’s, hitchhiking across two states back to Kansas to find somewhere Dean could be sure Sam would be safe.
Since Dean was less than forthcoming with details about his love life, Bobby took the hint and turned his attention to Sam.
“At least, she didn’t tease you about filing your nails between answering the phones this time, did she? So that’s progress.”
“And so Ellen jumps up and yells, ‘You stop that right now, Joanna Beth!’ And then turns to us all mad and says, ‘Which one of you boys wrote down the name of a porno for charades?’” Dean said.
“Hey, watch it, you idiots,” yelled a red-faced guy as he came round the corner and barrelled right into them.
His obvious desire quenched something in Dean, some need he had to be wanted. He knew Cas wanted him, could feel it against his hip if nothing else, but he thought it was more than that, more than the physical. As strong as the physical attraction was, it felt like there was something else between them, an emotional connection, a bond, something profound.
“I didn’t realise either,” Cas said, giving Dean’s knee a squeeze under the table. “Gabe and I mostly talked about the past when we met up. He didn’t mention Sam by name and when Sam called him Richard, I didn’t make the connection, even after Gabe said he goes by his middle name now.”
Cas knew that Dean appreciated his tattoos, but the man also loved his food and probably wouldn't eat ramen for months just to get some ink. Perhaps it was a little silly in hindsight. Or maybe not silly, it had been important to him at the time and still meant a lot to him now. But it was rather cliché.
“We have a tally at the shop for how many times people quote ‘draw me like one of your French girls’ at us, or ‘draw
The front door of their apartment opened straight into the living room, so Cas could see their guest when he glanced over his shoulder. Meg’s girlfriend, a tall, redheaded woman with a regal bearing. Privately, Cas thought she was rather haughty. But she made Meg happy, so Cas could put up with her attitude. Abby was wearing a dark pleated leather skirt, biker jacket, knee-high boots and her usual arrogant expression that Cas thought he saw soften slightly when she looked at Meg.
Meg made a thoughtful noise and started rummaging through her makeup bag where it was sitting on the side table. She turned back and grabbed Cas’s chin.
Dean and Cas sat back down to wait for someone to realise they wanted to leave. Dean kept trying to catch the creepy waiter's eye. Ugh, he was pretty sure he’d already caught the creepy waiter’s eye, but he was trying to communicate using his gaze that he wanted the bill. If it went on much longer, he was going to start miming writing a check when the waiter looked over at them and, dear lord, he did not want to be the obnoxious douche that mimed writing a check when they wanted the bill.
he decided, and grabbed the eggs, milk and butter because—screw pancake mix—he made this shit from scratch.
“Seriously? That’s not an answer! Why am I in a secluded cabin, with an angel I don’t know, who brought a shit ton of lube with him? I thought I was supposed to be here ‘recovering’?”
Cas nodded and let Dean manoeuvre his hand to grasp his cock more firmly. Dean placed his own hand over Cas’s and showed him how to touch him, a bit harder, fast strokes up and down with a little twist at the top so his palm brushed over the head of Dean’s cock in a way that made his breath catch in his throat.
Dean was more than happy to agree to that. Family was the most important thing to him and he wanted more of these meals shared with his boyfriend and his brother... and Gabriel too, he supposed. He might be kind of a dick—Dean wasn’t quite ready to let him off the hook for leaving Cas and he wasn’t yet convinced that he was good enough for Sam, but he made Cas happy and he made Sam happy and that was all Dean really cared about.
When Dean released him, Cas took a moment to look Dean up and down too. He was wearing another of his endless jeans and flannel combos with a canvas jacket. He looked just as casual as Cas, so Cas figured that at least he hadn’t made a misstep on the date outfit front. Now, if he could just keep that successful streak going.
The most striking thing about the apartment was that the walls were covered in art. Both Cas and Meg were artists, so it wasn’t really surprising that there were a lot of pictures on the walls. Many of them were just prints of artwork they liked, but a fair number were their own work, paintings they’d done or sketches of tattoos they particularly liked.
“I’m sorry. It's hard for me to remember you might not know these things,” Cas told him, managing to look as resentful as he was apologetic.
“No worries, I’ve got the fire department on speed dial.” She got her phone out of the pocket of her jeans and held it up.
They stayed for another hour. The meal was filled with warmth and laughter that nourished Dean in a way that vegan pancakes—that even decent food—did not. Spending time with the people he loved was sustenance for him. There was a simple happiness in just being in the presence of Cas and Sam. By the time they were finished, Dean thought he might even be growing fond of Gabriel. He was interesting, funny and could be surprisingly kind.
Cas smirked at him and then his smile softened with sincerity. He moved away from the counter to lean over the table and touch Dean’s face. “You’re beautiful when you sleep, Dean. You’re always beautiful. I like that I get to see the bits of you that other people don’t. Even the bits when you’re drooling.” He paused. “Sometimes, especially the bits when you’re drooling.” He ran his thumb over Dean’s lips.
It wasn’t that Dean didn’t top- he would enthusiastically take either part when they fucked- it was just that Dean
Dean hovered around Cas’s hipbone for a moment, not because he was nervous or anything, just because Cas had nice hipbones and he wanted to lick them. In this position, his mouth was only a couple of inches from Cas’s hard dick. In for a penny, in for a pound, he supposed... well, there wasn’t going to be any pounding just yet, but he didn’t only want to touch Cas, he wanted him in his mouth. He looked at Cas’s cock, part awe, part apprehension, wondering where to start. Dean had received plenty of blowjobs, it shouldn’t be too difficult to reverse engineer the process, right? His hand was still on Cas’s cock, he stopped stroking and held it round the base, angling it up slightly toward his mouth. Dean gave the head a slow lick. The noise of absolute rapture that Cas made at the first touch of his tongue sent a thrill through Dean. It also guaranteed that Cas was going to be getting a lot more blow jobs in the future.
“Well, that does put it in perspective,” Cas said. He didn’t sound entirely convinced, but he smiled when Dean reached out to put a hand on his knee.
There was a picture of Ed and Lorraine Warren, what looked like a newspaper clipping about the DeFeo murders in Amityville, a rosary with onyx beads and silver crucifix, a miniature book about two inches tall that Meg had sculpted with modelling clay to look like the Necronomicon, an old wooden cross, a frankly adorable tiny ‘Annabelle’ Raggedy Ann doll that Meg had sewn herself and a statuette of Pazuzu from
“Oh,” said Cas, whose face clearly showed that he hadn’t known that, or at least hadn’t felt comfortable letting himself believe that yet. “I love you too, Gabe.”
Cas was sitting across the room in his uncomfortable armchair when Dean woke up. He stretched and looked over at him appreciatively. Cas had put on Dean’s t-shirt from the day before, an old grey tee with AC/DC emblazoned on it in red. The shirt was a little loose on him, but he looked perfect in it. Dean didn't know why Cas was wearing his t-shirt when they were at Cas's apartment with plenty of his own clothes to choose from, but he liked it. He liked it very much. Cas wasn't the only one who could be possessive.
“I am a knight, but I’m not going to actually wear a full suit of armour to a club,” Abby explained, unzipping her jacket and revealing a chainmail bra. “I ended up going for the classic video game interpretation of female armour. Not exactly battle-ready, but I think my boobs would be somewhat protected against glancing blows.”
“Sweetheart, you gotta relax.” Dean put his hands on Cas’s hips and rubbed soothingly. “Loosen up.  It’s supposed to feel good- like sex,” he told him winking. Though as he watched Cas, he thought whoever had come up with that whole sex is analogous to dancing got it wrong, at least when it came to Cas, because Cas was an atrocious dancer, but he was amazing in bed. “Just let your body move to the music.”
“Your fingers aren't the part of you I want inside me and you know it,” Cas huffed but kept moving in tandem with those fingers anyway and moaning at the feel of them.
He only just resisted the urge to say something about how he was happy to be a little less upstanding if this guy wanted to go find somewhere to lie down. He didn’t want to come on too strong though. Well, stronger than licking the guy before learning his name.
Dean let Cas explore until he felt like he was losing his mind. The soft touches were both too good and not enough. He needed more, he needed harder. Dean retrieved his usual jerk off lube from his bedside table. He took Cas’s hand and poured a little into his palm as Cas watched him curiously.
Dean didn’t think the scenario was particularly unbelievable. Not given the fact that the only other time he’d been to a gay bar he had picked a girl up. He definitely hadn’t been trying to prove something or anything. She’d just caught his eye was all. Charlie had taken him along to a gay bar one night and they’d ending up playing rock paper scissors to see who got to try their luck with the hot bi chick they’d met. He’d won but Charlie had still gone home with another equally gorgeous woman herself.
Dean thought the pearl-clutching was because Sam was a prude and didn’t want Gabriel mentioning that they were sleeping together, rather than that Sam was offended that Gabriel was mocking him.
They spent the meal talking and laughing. Cas dug into his food with more gusto once he’d slathered it in hot sauce. Dean wolfed down the meat with hardly any hesitation. And Sam finished his turducken under Dean’s watchful eye (and maybe a couple of subtle kicks under the table when it looked like he might be going to leave food on his plate). Once they were finished, Cas got up and bustled around the kitchen. He fetched more beers and plates before getting something out of the warming drawer beneath the oven.
She had light brown hair that was up in two high buns and she was wearing a turquoise embroidered silk jacket over khaki overalls. Clearly, she had the same lack of awareness as Charlie did about what constituted appropriate clubwear because she was twirling a paper parasol with colourful swirling stripes over her head. She was talking animatedly to a blond guy in a Hawaiian shirt while shooting flirty smiles at Charlie.
This was the kind of design that made Cas proud of his work. Satisfied, Cas spent the afternoon reading the new fantasy novel that he’d picked up from the library but hadn’t been able to focus on this past week. Then, he ended the day comfortably curled on the couch next to Meg watching the latest show she’d picked for them to binge together. He was feeling almost like himself again.
“I got them at a Spirit Halloween, ergo, they’re a costume.” She poked her tongue out at him. “What have you got?”
Dean got mugs out from the cupboard while Cas put coffee in the French press. He leant against the counter as he waited for it to brew. Dean sat at the table and opened the sketchbook, eager to see what Cas had drawn. The sketch was of Dean sleeping, mouth slightly open, drool at the corner of his lips.
“Everything has a dark side perhaps, or everything good has a cost, or conversely, where there’s dark, there’s light?” Cas said thoughtfully.
“What? I’m secure in myself!” he said defensively. “I'm comfortable going to a gay bar. Hell, I'm practically a friend of Dorothy... Well, I met her that one time when she was dating Charlie anyway.”
Since those who’d grown up under the strict teachings of his father in their small, isolated community tended to be a little awkward (or a lot awkward when it came to Castiel), this didn’t exactly work well. Castiel and the others were unsure of how to interact with outsiders, something that was normally discouraged apart from these attempts to recruit new members to the Church.
Instead of going over, Charlie jumped up and down, waving wildly, to get their attention. A tactic that worked surprisingly well in the crowded space since Charlie was hard to miss with her bright red hair and pink, poofy dress. Jesse and Cesar pushed through the crush to make their way over.
Plus, Dean knew the places Cas liked to eat, and they were generally the places he liked to eat too. And, given Gabriel’s reaction to the vegan pancakes and the insane amount of sugary syrup he was currently consuming, his choice of venue probably wasn't going to be some shitty health food place. So, only a quarter of Dean’s family brunches would be inedible instead of half of them. It was worth welcoming Gabriel into the fold just for that.
Dean was sitting on the end of the bed with his head in his hands when Castiel returned. He rushed over to his husband, panicked. Was he hurt? Had the spell had unforeseen side effects?
Hello to the people who bother to read the notes! I thought I’d include links to the songs mentioned and some of the other stuff referenced in case people are interested. Let me know if you think I missed something you’d like a link to. Or let me know if you think I forgot a content warning I should have added.
Dean wasn’t crying, not really, he was just a little misty eyed. It was no one’s business but his if Cas baking him pie was a secret fantasy of Dean’s. There was just something about the man he loved taking care of him, making something he knew Dean loved just for him, that warmed Dean right the way through. The pie was apple and had a perfect flaky lattice top sprinkled with sugar. It was sweet and tart and so obviously made with love that Dean might have teared up again when he took his first bite.
Dean stopped pouting and started blushing instead. Cas smirked at him again and then went back over to get the coffee. He poured a cup for Dean and himself then grabbed another empty mug and put it on the table, presumably for Meg who they’d heard get home late last night. Cas dug into the fridge for a carton of eggs. His kitchen wasn’t as well-stocked as Dean’s, but he did have eggs and there was bread for toast.
time they did this trip, Charlie was a much better travelling companion than Sam. She held his hand without comment whenever there was turbulence and kept him distracted by drawing him into passionate conversations about all sorts of things.
It's on Netflix. And it has Anthony Rapp and Wilson Cruz in it. Queer men playing an actual married couple. An actual gay married couple on TV!”
“That’s okay, baby.” Cas looked sorta horrified at what had just come out of his mouth, like he wanted desperately to take it back. “I... uh...”
“So, what are you saying?” Sam asked slowly. Dean could hear his patience fraying and that only made him more frustrated.
Despite the eye roll, Dean could see that Sam meant the words. Good for him. He was glad his brother had somebody to love, even if that somebody was Gabriel.
Dean had shaken off his own shock then and fought back, landing a powerful right hook straight to John’s mouth. He’d laughed while rubbing his jaw and said he was surprised that a fag like Dean could throw a punch. Dean had squared his shoulders and waited for more blows to fall, but John just gave another derisive laugh and slumped back down on the sagging couch to finish his beer.
“Now this is more like it,” Dean said enthusiastically. “A sexy, rock ‘n’ roll cowboy! You know me so well, Cas.”
“Best Christmas ever,” Dean told Cas again, before falling asleep wrapped in his arms, cosy and content.
Sam leaned over to Dean while Cas and Gabriel were distracted ordering and said quietly, “Sorry I didn’t tell you our boyfriends are brothers. I really did only find out about it the day you met Richard. I would have mentioned it, but pulling one over on you was the only thing that cheered him up while he was waiting for Cas to contact him. Richard was really worried that Cas would decide he didn’t want to see him after all.”
“Fine, I’ll say I’m sorry,” Meg relented. “There you go again, Clarence, after all this time, you're still making me a better person.” She scowled at him. “You know I hate that.”
Cas looked confused but he followed Dean when he rose from the table. He always followed Dean. A bar bathroom was the least of the places he was willing to go for him.
“The last time I didn’t bring lube when you were recovering, you told me very firmly that you were an adult and if you still wanted to fuck with a broken arm, then it was up to you.”
“I meant don't fucking kill yourself! Don’t leave me. Don't sacrifice yourself for me." His voice broke. "I'm not worth it."
he said gruffly.  It threw him for a second, when the guy said his name like that. He hadn’t even been sure that trench coat here knew his name, but there it was, coming out of his mouth, deep and dark, full of warning and promise.
“Uh, uh, uh,” she said, wagging her finger at him. She turned away for a moment to grab something from the side table next to the couch and fiddled with her hair. When she turned back, she was wearing a pair of small, sparkly-red devil horns clipped into her dark waves. Cas huffed a short, begrudging laugh at the sight.
Dean was happy, after spending so much of his life as a nomad, to have the stability of not just a real home, but of a partner who shared it with him. Even more than the bunker, Cas was home to Dean. He knew that Cas was happy too. He'd smiled more in the past month than in all the years Dean had known him. Cas had become so much more than that cold, marble statue of an angel he’d been when they first met. Dean felt privileged that a relationship with him was how Cas wanted to exercise the free will that he’d fought so hard for. Cas was still pretty new to the whole human emotion thing. So, it meant a lot to Dean that caring for him, maybe even loving him, was what Cas was doing with his new found ability to feel things deeper than the average angel. Perhaps Dean was getting ahead of himself, they hadn't even been together a whole month yet. It was just, he'd already been feeling so much for Cas before they got together and he couldn't help hoping that Cas felt the same. As scared as he was to even think the word ‘love’, he wanted it so badly.
“I’m gonna grab some breakfast. I’ll be back in a sec. Why don’t you wait here?” Dean felt rather reluctant to let Cas out of his bed now he finally had him there.
Also, do people still know who Sarah Connor is? One of my betas put a note in next to that section saying they hadn’t heard of her and I was really surprised. I know the first terminator film came out in the 80s but the last one only came out a couple of years ago and the one before that had Emilia Clarke playing her! And Lena Headey played her in the TV show! I just think Sarah Connor is iconic in all her iterations- please come agree with me in the comments!
“I’m your husband,” he repeated. The possible kidnapper, the guy intent on holding him here against his will, looked unaccountably hurt. He was still lying on the floor, which made him seem small and harmless. Dean had to resist the urge to help him when he started to rise unsteadily, unable to brace himself properly on his bound hands. He took a step towards Dean once he’d found his feet. Dean made a noise and threw up one palm in a ‘stop’ gesture, the guy complied immediately.
“I think maybe that time I drank a liquor store ruined whisky for me,” Cas confided before asking, “What is it?”
That wasn’t totally inaccurate. It did look almost exactly like a giant, black shipping container, except it was up on stilts so you could go underneath it and there was a ramp leading up to it so you could walk inside it. It might not seem like art if you compared it to Monet’s
It was some of the best sex that Dean had ever had. Certainly, the best one-night stand he'd ever had. It made him hope that this wasn't just a one-night stand. He wanted Cas to fuck him again (and he wanted to know if Cas would let him fuck him back once they knew each other better. Maybe if Dean told him his middle name?).
“Funny, people normally complain about my smart mouth. You can call me anytime, you know, Cas? I could talk to you all night.”
Cas’s favourite thing Dean sent was a song called ‘Guinea Pig Olympics’. He’d made the mistake of showing Meg the video and she’d gone around singing random snippets of it to him all week.
“I told you, girl, good cop/bad cop don’t work when we’re both the bad cop,” Bobby said from the driver’s seat.
Dean grinned. “Yeah, that’s her. She’s pretty great, mead fetching notwithstanding. You should meet her sometime.”
The exercise was didactic. It reminded them of the chasm between The Blessed Children of God and other lesser mortals. It wasn’t just that these outsiders didn’t see the light, it was that they refused to be
Huge praise from the love of his very long life. Was that all he was to him? Cas felt adrift. It was like he didn’t know himself if Dean didn’t know him. He’d existed for eons, yet somehow, who he was, who he really was, was the person he’d become over the few short years he’d been with Dean.
Dean sucked in a sharp breath. He wondered what Cas had been doing, lying there naked. “Yeah? What were you thinking?”
Well, he was comfortable apart from when it came to breaking the ice with a hot guy, then he reverted back to being fifteen and feeling like he was doing something he shouldn't be. It was an automatic reaction, the old anxiety bubbling up when he approached a guy or they approached him. Then he was fucking awkwardly bisexual.
He had fond memories of watching the film together not long after they first met. It was one of the first mainstream films he’d seen. As well as being one of the first times he’d done something so normal with a friend.
“Anyway, a regular client of mine, Sera, came to me wanting a large, intricate piece inspired by death. She wasn’t sure exactly what she wanted, and it was a big step up from the first tattoo of hers I did, which was just a flaming pentagram on her ass. So, she gave me creative freedom to design something around the general idea of mortality and the macabre. That was what I came up with.” Cas shrugged.
“Whatever. Not important. How about you explain how I can I have amnesia when I remember literally everything else but you?”
