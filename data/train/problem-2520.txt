Anna’s arms are wrapped around him faster than Dean can think to hold back the sob rising from the bottom of his chest. She frowns, body warm against Dean’s, eyes glassy. Dean can see Castiel in her face, in the slope of her eyebrows and jaw and cheekbones.
TRIGGER WARNING on this upcoming chapter for homophobic violence and just like a fairly graphic depiction of violence in general. if you want to avoid that it's towards the very end.
He wants his sorrows to become strangers to him again, wants his father to be home, wants to open the door to Jimmy’s study with a cup of green tea and see his dad working at his computer, glasses balanced on his nose, smiling as soon as he catches Castiel’s reflection in the monitor. He wants his father back and cannot accept the fact that Jimmy is gone.
Dean looks up, over to Castiel. The darkness blankets around them like four walls closing them in to the light of the fire.
“Keep saying my name,” with his forehead pressed hard against the side of Dean’s face as he watches the movements his fingers are making at Dean’s shoulders, and Dean stutters out a laugh and says,
“How’s your breakfast, Cas?” He asks, instead of engaging. Cas glances down at his plate, and seems to soften.
been a cloudless day. Castiel shifts uncomfortably in his seat. “Need I remind you, you’ve been wrong on this matter before.”
“That was never the choice, Dean,” Castiel shakes his head, expression fierce, “and never the choice I presented you with. Don’t you dare. I know that’s how you understood it at the time—but let’s, neither of us, pretend your mind was in the right place to be able to understand, or accept, what I had to say entirely, ten years ago.”
“You’re only saying that to be nice,” Dean comments, though he smiles all through it, “but I don’t care. Hey, Mr Novak,” he turns to Jimmy again. “You know that story you read me and Cas last week?”
“You know, sometimes courage skips a generation,” Mary says, tears in her eyes. “You and Sammy have it in droves.”
Asking for instruction to Dean’s training grounds from a servant wearing slightly scuffed boots and a crumpled shirt, Castiel is shown down several corridors, and then out into a courtyard. He frowns at the clouded sky over his head—it seems far too overcast for what is so nearly summertime. In the distraction of taking in his surroundings, the servant has left Castiel, who vaguely remembers the skinny, scruffy looking man pointing him somewhere and saying something in the way of instruction before disappearing.
“Okay,” Jody grins over the laughter, “I guess that’s unanimous. So now—did—did you guys want to do your own vows, or…?”
So Dean stitches bumblebees around the mended hole at one of Castiel’s sleeves, turns the hole into a pot of honey, makes small weaves of sewn lavender along the frays of Castiel’s nightclothes, and over a patch at the knee of some trousers, sews the symbol of a silvery-green mugwort leaf, its feathery fanned fingers splitting into the shape of starlight.
He should’ve recognised the car, but his thoughts had been entirely elsewhere, and in the heavy rain, it was nothing but a pretty, blurry outline of black, anyway.
“Gods, I’m not certain that we can,” Gawaine shook his head, pulling a pained expression. He rubbed the short beard covering his jaw with his ungloved hand. “We’ve seen a lot of troublesome folk around these parts, and I’m not sure… What’s the guarantee that you’re not another one of these unsavoury characters we’ve been looking out for?”
Maybe he should start drinking protein shakes.—He’s muscular already, he’d like to flatter himself to think, and Dean’s said that Castiel is muscular before, albeit when he was drunk. But it’s not
“I don’t…” She shakes her head. “Dean, he—nobody knows how he—not delicate, but—he feels things,” Ellen swallows, “and these last months—nobody—”
love better than any of the rest,” he says quietly. Dean glances away sadly, shaking his head. His insides squirm with guilt and shame. He thinks about his harsh words, his lashing out, his cage of feelings which cause anger to boil up before tenderness has time to reach the surface, which cause fear and shame to overpower the courage love should set in him… No, he’s a poisoned mess of it: yes the mess is love, but it isn’t a good love.
the emergency contact for Sam, and if it were Ruby calling, she’d have called Dean first, too. So he assumes Mary calling him now is totally fucking needless and probably about a pipe that needs fixing.
nothing. David was everything. Years washed by like waves against soft sand and Michael spent every moment he could, every moment he was not caught in some princely duty, with his Beloved. He stayed in David’s home and met his family, befriended David’s younger siblings and won their adoration, was doted upon by David’s mother who, at first, seemed something startled by the presence of not only an Angel but a Prince among Angels visiting her small and crowded home, obviously enamoured with her son and sleeping in his bed. And it was a small and cramped bed for two people, one of whom had wings worth at least a third person in the small space. Michael wrapped them tight around David’s body every night. He’d do so anyway, no matter how spacious their sleeping arrangements.
“You think so?” Castiel asks, determined not to let Dean’s thoughts turn sour and sorrowful with regret for something Castiel has long since forgiven him for, and would forgive a thousand times over, knowing and loving as he knows and loves now. “I’m not so sure,” he looks up at the sky, squinting to see it through the folds of leaves above them.
Inside the croft, Novak has hung dried herbs about from the beams spanning the rafters. It’s just as Ellen does, only more, far more, than Dean has yet seen—inside Ellen’s kitchen, or anywhere. He can’t identify all of them, some are strange, wild, prehistoric looking things. Novak ranges in, dropping a small cloth bag onto the table. He hangs a blackened kettle over the hook at the fireplace, and pulls out a chair at the table, then pulls out another beside it for himself, and sits.
Corn reaping is gone. The golden fields are gone. Robert’s letter came, not a moment too soon: grasshoppers are shearing through the fields of Kansas farms even as the ship Dean stands at, stomach turning, bounces along the intrusive waves toward a port of a new city. What ravages will be left of Dean’s old home when they are done, he has now idea.
They have reached the gates of the palace, which swing gracefully open as Henriksen begins to climb the palace steps.
They return to the bunker and Dean—what can he say?—He runs in, ahead of Sam, ahead of Miracle, who they’ve taken with them. He runs through the crow’s nest, the library—no Cas, but that’s okay, he’ll be here somewhere—but he isn’t, he isn’t, he isn’t. His feet hammer at the floor like a pulse—down, down to the dungeon because—because that was where he saw Cas last, that was where Cas was taken. If Cas was to return, it’d be here, right?
Which, strange as it seems, feels like some kind of betrayal. It’s weird and irrational, but Castiel is hurt that his brother could be so friendly towards Dean, considering how much Castiel’s heart aches and his soul crumbles because of the green-eyed man.
“Of course not,” Lucifer smirks. “But I attempted your attack on Hera with them because I needed your brother.”
“We should get these clothes off,” Dean states, tugging off his jacket, then freezes, realising what he’s said. He balks, skin flushed, so flushed that it practically evaporates the remaining water off it. “I mean—”
“I don’t even know what’s right or wrong, any more,” Dean confesses, desperately. “Who says? Who’s telling us? I need someone to tell me.”
“Seriously,” he confirms, sitting back down on the mattress. Dean sits on a chair he has moved next to the bed. Cas glances up at Dean. “The last person I read this to was probably Dean, you know,” he states, warmth making those bright-blues dance.
that question,” Castiel chuckles, but he is already making his way into the living room to turn on the TV.
He watches the people from his balcony, wondering what it is they must think of him. They sprawl across the streets, small and busy as ants, their cries and shouts and chatter to one another muffled by distance and by their sheer numbers, so that all their speech is rendered to a general incoherence, a buzzing, thrumming noise that bounces off the thick walls of buildings and is carried up by the cold midwinter air. Crisp, this air bites at Dean’s skin, yet he’s strangely thankful for it. Wearing little more than his doublet and hose, somehow his flesh still sears with the mark, and ice seems like the perfect logical relief for him.
“Still bitter about that, huh?” Ellen asks with a teasing smile, but Dean simply blinks blearily at her. Mick snorts.
Dean’s seen it all before, so this one’s more for Cas than him, but it’s good to get reacquainted with the place. And with every room, with every kid, he gets more and more sure about his decision. He glances at Cas, a wordless question, when they’re down in the kitchen and Sonny is fixing them up some more drinks. Cas looks back, bright blues glinting, and his wordless answer sends Dean’s heart soaring, his wordless answer is
“It means,” Dean sighs, “fuck man, I don’t know what it means. It means we’ll have lasted longer than Claire’s past
It’s already cosy, Krissy taking no embarrassment in sitting elbow to elbow beside Castiel and smiling almost too amiably at him. Then, turning from cosy into snug—no, tight—the last face and voice appear at the trap door.
“Praise indeed,” Dean quips, as Adam loses a hand and exclaims in surprise and confusion. Mick takes his cards, smugly. Dean smirks and shakes his head. They move to an adjacent table and sit after Novak has pulled a set of dice from a nearby cupboard.
Of the loud buzz of conversation in their ears, of the Angels and Humans speaking to each other, of the dull clatter of silver cutlery on pewter plates, of the sound of goblets banging on thick wooden tables.
“I can’t imagine you as reckless,” Dean states, truthfully. “You’re the most steadfast thing I know.” He means it from the very soil of his soul.
So Dean sets himself upon the task of setting up the kitchen for the day. Little tasks. Little, accomplishable tasks to focus on, to easily succeed at, are used to occupy his brain. The dragging of a damp cloth against the counter is mesmerizing - easy, methodical - and it calms his mind. Perhaps the one benefit, of all the destruction he’s suffered under Michael’s will: it is easier now than it’s ever been to empty his mind.
He hadn’t known until then, when Michael made him really look at himself, and then haphazardly shoved it all back in - the pieces of Dean exposed, all a jumble. He hadn’t known until it was all over and every unspoken thought and unacknowledged truth was utterly, impotently clearer than ever.
A blurry, grief-addled year with Lisa Braeden living an absolute falsehood aside, Dean has not been without a war since he was four years old. Living in relative peace has not been as easy as a transition as one would hope. Decimated though Dean’s grasp on normal is, despite shaky hands and a perpetually foggy brain he hasn’t completely lost the ability to function.
There’s a shotgun under the metal prep table, a jug of holy water in the fridge. The deli is a small operation and no one comes back here but him. There’s a narrow channel hollowed out of each doorway’s grout, full of salt, and sigils painted then made to disappear before human eyes on nearly every wall. Dean may be retired but he’s not sloppy.
A rare depiction of Sam and Dean coping healthily with their father's drinking problem and the massive effect his alcoholism has had on their lives. Also, Dean's definitely crushing on Sam's Alateen counselor.
Rowenas face falls, pain apparent, “Oh Gabriel. My sweet boy.” She palms his cheek gently, “You really don’t...” she sighs, “You’ve seen so much. Spent so much of your life running. I- I wish I could-” she composes herself quickly. Rolling her shoulders, “We knew the warding wouldn’t last forever. And I can only guess without further investigating, that the presence of a third force has been eating away at it faster than we expected.
“You know,” Sam says, more searching for something to keep the silence at bay than having any big revelation, “with Chuck… not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own.” Maybe tomorrow that’ll feel better, but right now it just sits heavy on his tongue. “You know, just you and me going wherever the story takes us. Just us.”
There were no sigils or runes to be painted, no ingredients to be amassed, no specific timing they had to wait for, only a small incantation that took Cas less than two minutes to memorize. The lack of buildup felt anticlimactic and far too quickly finished, giving Dean no time to gather his thoughts as they headed down to the dungeon, where they’d decided would be the smartest place to perform the spell. He felt like he hardly had the chance to catch his breath between giving in and Cas’s firm, “I’m ready.”
Though Cas is much younger in the photo, he looks tired. Burdened. As do all the men in the photo. Obviously in the middle of a war, one would expect that. Claire looks over the photo more closely, not recognizing any of the other men or anything about the location.
water lillies, and they’re not wrong. But the higher classification is lotus or Indian lotus.” Cas stops, cutting himself off, dropping his head. Softly, “Sorry, sometimes I talk too much.”
Thank you everyone who’s joined us so far! Your comments, kudos, and bookmarks make my day!❤️ We meet one of our side pairings in this chapter but I don’t wanna spoil it 😉 AND the mystery theme is revealed!
Jack Novak loves his older sister, Claire, dearly. Their father and uncle always say they’ve been inseparable since the day he was brought home. Two year old Claire clutching to his tiny hand the moment they met, their fates were immediately sealed. Growing up side by side, making mud pies (together), building pillow forts (together), learning how to toilet paper the neighbors trees using Jack’s developing powers without so much as leaving their porch (together), and becoming the star pupils of their specialities (together). Although they definitely got into their share of trouble, Jack and Claire were best together.
“Woo hoo!” Dean bounces, waving Cas to the edge of the blanket. “Come on, I’ll share my sandwich with ya.”
“That’s a very detailed name Ms Lavender, or do you prefer Ms Opal?” Gabriel ask intrigued over Cas’ shoulder, arms crossing as he bites into an apple.
“Its not one of your adventure books Jack, I don’t think there’s a damn sequel.” She laughs brokenly, trying to calm herself down. “Oh my god. Oh my god.” Claire rocks forward, head in her hands. “Who the hell is Dean?”
She flips open the worn buckle, clearing her throat as she reads the first passage her thumb finds aloud. “November 10, 1996. Today has been trying. Let the record state, it is a diary your honor.” Slamming it shut dramatically as she bounds over to the old couch they’d found in the attic years ago. She flips through the book quickly, falling in between the boxes she’d thrown down, “Look there’s a bunch of entries and doodles. I didn’t know dad could draw. It must be from during the war or something.”
Gabriel’s eye strain before widening in shock, “Holy Mary, Moses, and Josè. Where’d you find that? Better question-“ he swipes it away before they can protest.
It’s quiet in the field beyond the inn. The midnight moon rising high and bright above him, stars illuminating the short grass. If Cas wasn’t so confused, so scared, he’d take a moment to enjoy the beauty of it. It’s
“Who’s Dean?” Jack ask quietly, heading back to the trunk to look more. “I don’t think I’ve heard Dad talk about a Dean.”
Cas feels it instantly. The power thrumming through his blood as he reaches across the field in all directions. Reaching across the night air for any sign of Dean or Jack...
"Yes Crowley," Bobby rolls his eyes, "We fixed it, just liked you said, returned it in the short time frame just like you said, and had it ready for the race this Friday just like we promised."
“MOMMA! Mom!” Dean skids to halt, practically colliding into a women sitting upon one of the benches. A bundled toddler in her arms. Dean throws himself over the empty seat beside her.
“No- I didn’t mean it like-“ Dean groans dramatically, dropping his hands against his sides, they both hit his hips as his head rolls back. “What’s your name dude?” He looks back at Cas, hands on his hips.
“I mean I’ve always been open to whatever. I love the human body, you know that Cas. Rather it’s male or female just doesn’t matter to me! But you… something was different about you. I wanted to strangle you the moment I met you, ya know,” he laughs.
“It was easy. You kidding, I just laid on the charm and explained that we were closing for Claire’s wedding. I transferred a few evac’s over to Garth and Beth’s. Though Garth and Beth will be here for the wedding,” Gabriel leans against the fence, scratching his head as he tries to remember everything, “They said one of the kids is gonna be holding the fort down. I lost track of which one though. Everyone was cool as cucumbers. Mrs Hastings did ask for pictures though.”
"Gotta give you that one boy," Bobby says leaning down next to Crowley and checking him over, "He's only knocked out, he'll come to in a little bit. I suggest you get outta here."
“Oh dear me, this is just absolutely picturesque. Your photos online don’t do it any justice.” She rest a hand on her chest.
, he thinks. Because truth is since they both went back to work 2 months ago it's been difficult. Weird hours, half awake conversations over take out, hell the last time he went to sleep with Cas in bed was before the wedding! Now he's lucky to catch an armful of his husband in the morning or maybe share a smile over coffee. Sure there's been two or three weekend days where Cas didn't have to go in and it would be just like it used to be. When Dean could watch Cas sleep in the morning and bask in sweet mix of pine and what else is it he always smells like?
Castiel's in shock, he turns around quickly to make sure there's no one else he could be talking to. He swings back around.
Cas starts to argue but it dies on his lips. The two of them walking in comfortable silence down the path. The purple ivy just starting to bloom with its little flowers, creeping up the trellis’ of the pathway. It’s quite serine. Cas is about to start up a light conversation with Gabriel about the cake he’s baking, when he realizes his brother is no longer beside him.
“Have you ever seen it before?” Jack coughs, running his hand along the weathered edge of the leather trunk. As Claire wipes away more dust from the side, stitching and patches adorning the corners and seams. A worn down padlock keeping it shut. The box had seen better days. “No, I’ve never seen this it up here before. Don’t you think I would’ve said something about the mysterious unmarked LOCKED trunk in our attic if I knew about it?” She shakes a lock, testing its strength.
“What happened to him?” Jack ask aloud, rummaging through book, when a word in one of the passages catches his eye. Winchester. He’d heard that name at the Inn before. Stories about two brothers and their own inn out west. “I think I’ve heard of him, maybe.” Jack squints, thinking hard.
Gabriel turns back, running a tired hand down his jaw, “Cas knew his mom, she was the next door neighbors daughter, the Klines with the farm. Cas and De-” Gabriel shakes his head moving on. “We knew her while she was pregnant. Her boyfriend died in a car crash and we sorta helped her. She didn’t make it though. Her parents were pretty old and had seen how good Cas was with Claire. So they asked if he would adopt Jack. All they asked was if they could visit him. Cas of course said yes and they lived there until they passed a few years ago. They were normal, average dairy farmers.”
"That, right there, was the owner of this big ol' operation. Balthazar Roche. Only one of the wealthiest men in town," Gab said leading Castiel looking for something.
"Ohhhhh no, no, no. Not on my watch. Come on, let's get ya somethin' to drink!" Gabriel beams dragging Castiel through the bodies towards the bar.
Sam follows Dean, "No way, something's been up the past few days with you. Come on man I'm your brother!"
“What if Dean had a reason to come back?” Claire ask quietly, staring at the trunk in the corner. Mind cataloging all the contents she’d seen; a handful of vinyl records, tshirts folded neatly, unmarked envelopes packed tightly stacked neatly in the corner.
with his irreplaceable older brother Gabriel who insisted on making him over and getting him out for a night. Castiel reluctantly agreed, like he had a choice.
She palms it carefully. The buckled shut book piquing her curiosity as she runs her hand over the rough cover. She can’t help but flip open the buckle and thumb through the pages. Eyes going wide as she realizes what she’s found. Dates, handwritten passages, drawings-
The door swings open. Claire’s standing in the doorway, still in in her pjs, “I know. You texted me, come on.” She pulls him inside, shiftily checking the porch before shutting the door and locking it once more.
“Hey boss man!” Gabriel calls out opening the garden fence. Making his way toward Cas with a broad smile.
“But I wanna share. Think of it like a thank you for playing tag.” Dean smiles, shaking the offered sandwich half.
“Where are my manners?!” She rushes forward, offering a perfectly manicured hand, “Ms Lavender Opal on behalf of
“December 24, 2000: Sam’s going to propose to Jessica. Deans so happy for his brother. I can’t help but find joy in the small things during these dark times. The love between Sam and Jessica. Claire’s smile and laugh. Dean’s bottle green eyes. Claire took her first steps today on the porch. She’ll be running in the fields in no time. Playing with the other children, tumbling along with the pack. I don’t know what was more beautiful though. The moment she started walking or Dean’s magnificent smile when it happened. Both-”
, breathing calming, trying to block out the distracting hum of the garden. The birds chirping, customers talking, a crying baby in the distance, the sound of footsteps, a passing breeze. Unconsciously reaching towards each passing sound, silencing them as they pass by, searching for
“Hey there little fella, you like irises? Me too.” He kneels carefully against a stone bench, content smile upon his lips, doing his best to not let his pressed pants touch the dirty ground. His chin in his hands as he watches the bee rest upon the cascading purple flower.
How Jack made it through the garden, horse stalls, and cottages, without absolutely blowing everything he’ll never know.
“It’s always the strictest parents,” Gabriel smiles ruefully, patting her shoulder. “Believe me, I helped your dad in and outta a lotta windows gumdrop.” Because of Dean Winchester, he thinks to himself.
. The roses many shades and meanings, their thorned stems. One winter in his mother’s garden he’d seen a rose bush in full bloom, though it was coated heavily in snow. The red roses peaking out here and there among the heavy blanket of snowfall. It’s ability to fight through the adverse weather, piquing his curiosity.
“No- stop.” Gabriel grabs him again, looking over Cas once more. Cas starts squirming under his brothers prying eyes. Gabriel had always been the more perceptive of the two. His and Cas’ magic were different. While Cas’ was more
... Dean focuses back on the road for a moment. Back ramrod straight, he turns off the radio and runs a hand though his hair. But god damn it, I need you Cas. And suddenly Dean knows what to do. It's crazy, but he doesn't care. He just put the pedal to the metal, turns on his tunes, and heads for his destination.
Claire finds herself upside down on the couch, bare feet against the wall, clutching a Led Zeppelin vinyl against her chest, cool empty glass against her cheek. While Jack’s on the floor, plaid flannel he’d found folded in the shirts tied around his shoulders as he reads, propped up against the couch.
And so on and so on. Cas didn’t want to though. He just wanted to be a regular child and have friends, but no. He had Gabriel, his big brother, his teacher. His mother’s voice echoed through his mind,
“Gabriel?” Their mother asks appearing suddenly from around the corner. Barely glancing their way, a young woman on her arm. “Would you mind joining me with Ms. Hawthorn on our stroll through the aviary?”
“You like that?” Mary smiles, wiping his cheek causing little Sam to laugh gummily, “oh yes you do.” She runs a hand through his tangled hair.
"Oh don't worry. I'm on your side. But tonight we're on a mission to pull that stick out of your ass and maybe get you a guy in the process! Now, drink!" He smirks holding his drink up.
Jack’s about to protest but something catches his eye, “Whoa,” he reaches into the tattered trunk, retrieving a picture, “Is that-”
He’d always thought roses to be an overrated flower in his youth. His mother seeing him for one use and one use only at a young age, forcing him to help her grow them in
“Cas has to stay on the path because his momma said so. So we’re go play tag over there.” Dean motions back where they’d come from.
“Can you reach that?” Claire groans, practically climbing up the rickety attic cabinet, trying her damnedest to reach the top. One eye on her brother, the other on her prize at the top of the shelves.
"The first time I woke up I panicked out of my mind! I was like who the hell is this guy! What is he doing in my head? What do his lips taste like?
They both get under the blanket properly this time, Cas wrapping his arms around Deans torso from behind.
“Good afternoon Gabriel. What can I do for you?” Cas continues trimming the bright emerald green roses. So into his task at hand, Cas doesn’t notice his brother’s hesitant hovering.
"For the love of everything that is holy! Will you just let loose a little?!" Gabriel says behind Castiel pushing him as they make their way into the crowded club. Castiel immediately tries to turn back around.
Cas tries to follow it but the bee flies off further into the bushes where he can’t follow. He falls onto the bench defeatedly, his head falling back, staring up at the clear sky.
Cas wants to bolt, to ran back to the irises and study their cascading petals. But Dean’s ear to ear smile, dimples pressing into his cheeks, a smidge of dirt on his offered hand from playing in the grass most likely, Cas deduces looking over the other boy.
Dean gets between Crowley and Bobby, "Whoa there Mr. Crowley, first of all we fixed your car. If there
"Whoa there, I know. Her birthday isn't for months, you know that. What's wrong with you? Wake up on the wrong side of the bed? Honeymoon stage finally over?" Sam teases.
“Oh my god,” Claire grabs the lock, “It totally fell off the shelf and happened to fall open, did you see that?”, yanking the lock down with all her weight. The old lock busting under the pressure, opening with a CRACK. Claire palms the broken lock giddily, waving it in the air like a trophy. Before Jack can stop her, she snaps the trunk open, smiling wide as she looks upon their treasure.
“Castiel?” An urgent familiar voice calls out from behind. The boy stands adrubtly, hands folding behind his back, “Castiel, where are-
But I now realize the warding is failing..” his breathe slows, coming to terms with his realization, “The warding... is failing...” he reminds both himself and her gently, placing his hands delicately upon her shoulders. “I’m now realizing that’s how they were able to find it. Jesus Christ what else is gonna happen...” he panics starting to pace. “
"For my real family. Sam and you are all the family I could ever wish for Dean." Cas says inching closer to Dean.
Cas jumps, almost falling over but he catches himself. Looking around wildly for the source of the voice. His eyes land on a boy standing near the ponds edge, a bright red tee shirt catching Cas’ eye. A stark contrast to Cas’ blue collared button up.
“That’s better. My name’s Castiel. That’s a beautiful flower you’ve choosen.” He smiles contentedly.
Dean’s eye practically leave his head, “YOU’VE NEVER- How’ve you never played tag? You know-”Dean taps Cas’ shoulder. Catching the older boy off guard, he stumbles back. “Tag you’re it.” Dean laughs giddily, feet rocking back and forth as he prepares to run.
“You have no business talking about my son.” Cas growls out, risking a step closer, “or my family. If we’re through here-“
Every table in their home had a tall vase filled with the white and red pristine flowers. Nowadays, when the light hit a rose wrong or pricked his finger, he swore he could hear her drawling voice distantly,
... Somewhere along the way Castiel had planted a half dozen rose bushes in a variation of bright unusual colors of his own devising, (white, green, blue, purple), in his garden.
“STOP-“ Cas growls, tears threatening to fall but he shakes them off quickly, turning towards his attacker, hands outstretched, palms open, and ready to fight. His magic thriving through his body now, amber glow evident. Power coursing through his palms veins, begging to be released.
Sam's? No one home. And even if Sam was there he'd been getting on Dean's nerves the last few weeks with the whole 20 questions gig.
“Good for you.” Cas tosses out dryly. “But I- I really don’t give a damn.” Cas tries to come across strong, but he’s taken off guard. His mind swirling;
“I run and you have to try and catch me. Gotta warn ya though I’m kinda awesome at this. When you catch me you just tap my shoulder and say TAG YOU’RE IT! Then
Cas starts, “No Dean I do not understand. Fortune cookies aren’t even a Chinese tradition, they were originally-”
"Go!" Castiel can barely get out the word he's laughing so hard. Dean is beaming, smiling from ear to ear as disappears back into the crowd.
“No, no! I didn’t agree to this-“ Gabriel panics but his niece and nephew look to him, puppy dog eyes on full display as they squeeze him tight. “Damn you two. Damn you both. And damn your father. AND the Winchesters. Fine. You find Dean, I’ll help you try to get him here. Try being the operative word. You’ll need me I promise.” He shakes out of the siblings clutches.
The photo is tattered at the edges. From someone obviously folding it dozens of times and carrying it along with them. The black and white ink starting to drift away at the middle and folds.
“CAS, HELP US!” Dean calls out brokenly, further away. Jack’s cries starting once more from the opposite edge of the field. Cas is torn, he doesn’t know where to turn. He hasn’t used his full powers in so long. Almost dormant, deep and buried within him. He digs down though, begging them to help.
is fine darling. Now, if you don’t mind, where are the nuptials taking place? I’m a very busy woman and we have so much to do Mr. Novak.” Ms Opal motions towards the home.
? Jack’s not- Jack’s-“ he takes a step closer, quietly. Jaw setting as he continues darkly, “Jack’s just a kid. A
“My family needs me, Dean needs me.” Cas grits, standing his ground. Moving his hand behind his back. Ever so slowly twisting his hand with practiced ease, raising the dirt behind his feet.
Sam puts his hands up in surrender, "Ok, alright, fine," He turns to leave but stops by the garage door and yells to him, "But Dean if you need anybody to talk to seriously-"
really. But I digress. They’re savages, and when they don’t need you anymore, you’ll be thrown out onto the street like yesterdays trash with no where to go.” They lean over Cas’ shoulder. “And we know all about your children. Fascinating really. Jack’s just a week or so old correct? What a pity losing his mother like that.-”
“Oh really?” Gabriel tilts his head, sauntering over to the shelves next to the table. “The bedsheets right here?” He points to box almost directly behind them on the shelves.
"Thank you Dean," Cas smiles. He’d always been fond of drunk-Dean. He was so carefree. Cas imagined it was what Dean would be like without hunting or the heartbreak he’d been forced to go through.
“THEY TOOK YOU TO THE LAKE!” He weaps, clutching the flannel, “Y-you we’re probably all bundled up like a- a little burrito baby-”
He's well into working and in his own world when someone bangs on the hood. Causing him to jump under the car and whip his head up too fast. The wrench clattering to the ground forgotten as he nurses his now most likely bruised forehead.
After a moment they get to one of the sides and Gabriel begins taking Castiel up a steel winding staircase.
“Of course not.” Gabriel sighs, “It tore your dad apart when Dean left. I’m reiterating here, it’s your dads story to tell you but… it wasn’t pretty kid. The war was getting uglier, I was there and I- I wish I’d done more. Losing someone like that… it hurts like hell. It took your old man years to cope. Wrangling you two helped steady him. Worst part is if Dean showed up on his doorstep, Cas would probably take him back. Of course not until after a long awkward stare off and an even longer yelling match, possibly a few punches. But as I mentioned earlier, they loved each other at some point. But that’s never gonna happen because those two neurotic lovesick fools are the most stubborn idiots I’ve ever met.”
"Dean you really should lie down and take something," Cas says starting to clean up the mess of bottle and boxes.
“Why would I think your hand would bite me? That’s very illogical.” Cas eyes Dean, head tilting curiously. Internal turmoil completely forgotten.
Today, Castiel Novak kneels in the garden behind the Beehive Inn. Jean clad knees carelessly caked in dirt and shirt rolled up to his elbows. His wide brimmed work hat keeping the midday sun out of his eyes as he tends to his roses.
“I guarantee there’s no baby pictures up there.” Jack laughs to himself, already trying to reach the box. “There’s just a few more boxes over there. If you’d just help me look through them it’d go ten times-”
, Gabriel could be in your mind in a flash. But the brothers had a long standing deal. They’d sworn not to use each other’s powers on one other, unless the situation was dyer. “First off we have plenty of tables already. There’s like twenty tables ready to be set up. So unless Claire and Kaia are throwing a real rager, we’re set. Now, you’ve got 10 pound luxury bags under your eyes and you’re running on fumes around here. You practically tore my head off earlier when I asked if you wanted coffee.”
It’s a tattered polaroid from years ago. A time neither Claire nor Jack can remember clearly. Five men—
"Dean!" Cas laughs taken back by any type of spontaneity from Dean, "What about work? And the Mustang? It's Wednesday! We can't leave!"
“February 10, 2001, Deans become distant-” Claire reads over the last word confused, “What the-” flipping the pages back and forth. Finding no passage between December’s lengthy Christmas passage which went on for two pages, going in depth about Claire’s first steps, the inn’s holiday plans, and the clipped February passage. She begins reading even faster, “April 5, ‘01: Sam insist everything will be ok, that Dean just needs space sometimes especially when he gets into a certain mindset but I’m not so sure anymore. I know how Dean is but... Naomi and the coven are getting closer every day. I haven’t told anyone yet but I feel them growing closer, growing stronger every day. Dean would be furious if he knew. But he has his secrets and I have mine. Soon it won’t matter though. Soon he’ll be across the country doing what he does best and I’ll be here. All that matters is that he’ll be safe. Ps: I almost forgot, Claire said her first word the other day, flower.
Hello again honeybees! Welcome back! Feel free to follow along on tumblr as well (geekiest-angel-inthegarrison). Enjoy!💛 Chapter 2 is now updated with the rewrite! (Sorry again for the slow updates work is a little crazy💛)
“NO-“ Gabriel laughs nervously, again waving his arms between the two of him. This is his worst nightmare. Yes, he’s absolutely had this nightmare before. Usually this is the point where Cas burst in and sends him out the window.
In the words of his best friend he decides with a smirk, “What the hell.” And heads for Dean. Cas finds Dean asleep on his stomach on his bed fully clothed on top the covers. Cas smiles taking the blanket from the chair in the corner.  He drapes it over his friend. He takes Dean’s arm that’s off the bed and places it on Dean’s side.
Claire’s already too engulfed in the diary to hear him though. But if she had heard Jack, she would went into a lengthy story about the time in her late teens when she’d been playing Fleetwood Mac in the barn while working on her knife throwing (the knife her Uncle Gabriel had secretly given her mind you). Only to have Cas burst in the doors, demand she turn it off, and leave as fast as he’d appeared with no explanation. No, Claire won’t mention the bizarre incident neither her nor their father had talked about since. She’s too into kicking her legs up on the armrest, leaning back against the forgotten boxes, flipping through the book. After a minute though she stops dead in her tracks as her eyes land on a passage, eyes wide. “Holy shit.”
Castiel returns sluggishly to the irises and his bumblebee. Sighing as he sits upon the bench neatly, one hand reaching out to run along the leaves softly. Slowly his breath calms. He remembers what Gabriel had taught him. Cas closes his eyes, steadying his breathing.
“Great. So dad and this, Dean Winchester, fought together?” Jack tries piecing together. Laying the diary gently on the table and staring at the open trunk.
Along one of the less crowded pathways, a young boy follows a bumblebee. His shining blue eyes wide and curious following the bee to its destination.
Anna winks at Cas shooing him out the door as quickly as she can telling him she'll email him with anything important and call if there's an emergency. Cas smils greatfully mouthing
"I was just wondering," Gabriel says innocently looking up at his now much bigger seeming little brother.
Sighing heavily, his breath raggedy returns to normal. Cas rest his head against the cool wood headboard. The same nightmare he’d been haunted by for weeks. He can’t seem to blame himself really.
"NO. GABRIEL. That is…" he looks at the man across the dance floor, his head thrown back in laughter as the the men and women around him talk, "no. I am not doing it." Cas says sternly and then turns back to the bar asking for another drink.
"Seriously... I'm not just getting drunk so I can get laid, Gab," Castiel says putting his drink back on the bar.
. We've never been better. I mean yeah we're not perfect but hell who is! But we're not on the verge of killing or leaving eachother like everybody thinks! We're just... different," Dean says with a huff.
Claire silently decides to back track in the diary. Reading some of the simpler, happier passages to her brother. They lose track of time drinking cheap whiskey and taking turns reading the worn leather bound book aloud. Jack finds out fast that he’s a tearful drunk, and Claire already knew she could hold her own quite well. Hours pass as the pages and passages fly by. The sun falling and and moon rising high.
Mary laughs to herself amusedly watching dean run off. Dean spends the twenty minutes doing his best to wrangle a very confused Cas around the grass. Cas who just wants try and understand the dynamics of tag. Dean who didn’t realize you could ask so many questions about tag.
“Wait, you’re telling me those flower came all the way from India?!” Deans eyes bulge, looking quickly to Cas.
. He’d sworn he heard Jack crying but now he’s all turned around- Why had he thought Jack would be outside in the first place? It’s so late and how had Cas ended up outside in the first place-
Patrons flock in every day to witness nature’s beauty for themselves. Children ran along the sidewalks, reading the plaques and watching the hummingbirds in awe. Couples walked arm and arm along the koi ponds edge. A few artist even sat upon the grassy knoll, the busy gardens a perfect subject.
Cas sits back on his heels reluctantly, squinting up through the sun over the brim of his hat, “Thank you Gabriel,” he groans stretching. Accepting the water happily and taking a long swig.
“Heeey,” Cas cries out, doing his best to press his wild raven locks back down, jumping out of his brother’s teasing clutches. “
Jack breaks out of his stupor, “What do you mean blank? It can’t just end like that Claire. For dad to lose someone he obviously cared so much for, a week or so after I was born-.” Jack swipes the book away, looking for himself.
“Jesus, are you ok? Jack?” She turns over, sitting up to check on her brother, who’s now cradling himself, “Have you had alcohol before?”
Castiel nods turning away to look anywhere but Gabriel. He just wants to leave, this place is insane. Gabriel was right though, Castiel had only been to one bar in his life. His 21st birthday. Castiel, Gabriel and some friends went out and it was anything but epic at least for Castiel. He honestly didn't get what the big deal was. He didn't know if maybe it was because he
.” His older brother ruffles his hair, sighing relieved. The lanky teen’s sandy blonde hair falling into his eyes as he leans over Cas.
Rowena can’t help but watch him walk up the steps and inside the inn, eyes following down his body. “Ohhh I hate it when he leaves but I love to watch him go.” She shakes readjusting her firey hair beneath her scarf, sweaping it to the side as she slides into the car. It seems her vacation is over.
"What happened?" Cas realizes people are beginning to stare and takes Dean down the short hall to his office, closing the door behind them. "Dean's what's wrong? Is someone hurt? Are you hurt? Is it Sam?" Cas runs his hand along Deans cheek and slowly brings Dean's face up.
“Wait wait wait.” Claire throws her hands in the air, “Hold up, dad, our father, was the rebellious child?” Her voice practically squeaks.
“I guess so. I always thought he was a general or a counselor or, I don’t know, something boring like a liaison.” Claire shrugs, “But look at his gun Jack. Mr Don’t Use Your Powers Unless Its Absolutely Necessary. And the guy who wouldn’t let me train with a pocket knife. CARRYING A TACTICAL WEAPON?!” Her eyes bulge, pointing incredulously at their father in the photo, before she sighs, “He looks so- I don’t know, not like himself. He looks rough, sad. But still, dad looks kinda badass.” Claire laughs quietly to herself, “What’s Camp Chitaqua though?” Pointing at the entrance sign posted behind Cas in the photo.
"Of course you are babe. Keep telling yourself that," Cas laughs patting Dean on the chest and going around to the door.
.” Cas bites out icily. Raising his hand, extinguishing the candles in basement with a snap of his fingers. Leaving Gabriel in the dark
“Gabriel?” Cas calls out to him once more, now heading back towards his brother. But Gabriel lifts his free hand swiftly towards Cas. Motioning for him to stay silent.
he thinks to himself. He's bending down to the car and working again when he hear's a car engine and car door slam. He looks up just in time to see none other than Mr. Crowley himself waltzing into the garage. Dean rolls his eyes and stands,
Gabriel sighs heavily, head high, composing himself, before rolling his shoulders and pealing his youngest brother away. “Stick to this path and study the bees. When I come back you can tell me all about ‘em.
“This looks like a crime scene. Claire-“ he looks to her quickly. “Claire, Does anyone know you have this?”
“Dean Winchester!” Claire puts two and two together, snapping triumphantly. “I knew the name was familiar,” she practically kicks herself. “He has the- what’s it called. Rocky’s Tavern. In Kansas or something. It’s wild.” She laughs fondly, before clearing her throat, “so I’ve heard.”
Claire carefully sets the photo down and glances over the trunks contents as well. Her eyes being drawn to a brown leather bound book in the trunks lid pocket.
. Falling back asleep a little easier each night. Tonight, he sighs, the weight on his heart bearing harder and heavier the closer Claire’s wedding comes.
He could still run. He knows he could make it the short distance back to the house. Back to his family. It’s dark, practically pitch black but he knows his way through the field. Warn them in time to-
Gabriel shrugs, accepting half as a win and opening the chips for himself, “I just rescheduled the last of the guest for next weekend. Wanted to check in and see what you needed help with next.”
to his daughter’s retreating form. She’d smiled brightly, practically tripping as she threw him a wink and disappeared into the inn.
"Besides you're the one works on the cars right? Did this hack job on my baby? You probably didn't even go to college. Still live in mom's basement? Or better yet maybe you live here? Hell, I don't know. I don't care," Crowley smirks, hands in his pockets.
Jack runs his hand along the photo, not feeling anything off putting or magic about it. It’s just an average photo. “It’s real... I think it’s... Is this during the war? I’ve never seen photos of him during it.” Jack let’s out softly.
Cas chokes out, coming back to consciousness blurily. Sweat coating his brow as his hands clutch his chest, pulling absently at his soaked tee as he tries to catch his breath.
"That's an order Dean! Get outta here, alright? There's no telling what this whack job is gonna say or do when he wakes up."
"Jesus dude! How many cups of coffee you have this morning?" Sam laughs coming around the front of the car laughing as Dean slides out slowly.
Dean laughs brokenly as a tear runs down his cheek. “Damn it Cas. You mean so much to me… I… I…” He looks up at Cas and slowly palms his cheek, “I need you.”
has a point. “They’re called Lotus.” Cas points towards the flowers among the pond. “The white and pink ones you like. Those are Indian lotus,” Cas says proudly.
Around lunch time Cas is sitting on the front steps eating the pb&j sandwich Claire had practically shoved at him. Saying, “
? Yes, on the average, children start showing signs of abilities at a young age. Usually between three and six years old. But I’ve heard of cases where humans have
Dean looks to his mom, fist against his chest waiting for her decision. “Yes, yes.” She agrees shaking her head.
The colorful lights swirl across the floor, shadows dance across the walls, it's just dark enough to keep faces anonymous except when the strobe lights hit them. Honestly to Castiel, this place is too high maintenance. It's three stories, used to be a warehouse or something and got remodeled. But now its completely decked out in velvets, heavy booming music, long cascading drapes, long busy bars line both sides of the warehouse. The bottom story is all one dance floor, a stage at the far end that Castiel can barely see. Then he looks up,
Cas very reluctantly shakes it. Honestly expecting his hand to explode on contact or worse, be hexed.
chair and goes to the opposite side of the bed. His jacket and shoes have been long gone for hours. His shirt undone the first few buttons after Dean insisted he ‘loosen up a little’. He sits lightly.
And that's when the mystery man looks up and looks straight at Castiel. They both freeze for a moment. Castiel pushes past a girl to get to the railing slowly. Neither has any idea how long they hold each other's gaze but Castiel is positive he can feel this guy's soul. Suddenly the mystery man blinks, shakes his head and turns to face a tall beautiful, blonde haired woman in a tight red dress. They both smile wide and hug tight.
"All true, and you can also add your love for baking pies, watching Dr. Sexy MD, and snuggling up on the couch. Very manly babe," Cas winks cutting him off. He puts on his trenchcoat and begins walking out the door of the office.
“I don’t like it when you work with mother,” Cas admits quietly, Gabriel barely hears the admission, the boy clutching tight as he hides in his face into his brother’s side.
Jack moves on, carefully looking through the trunks many contents. It’s filled to the brim with neatly packed books, photos, vinyl records, folded clothes in the corner. And that’s just what they can see without moving anything.
Jack rolls his eyes half heartedly, “Dad says I’m not supposed to use my powers unless it’s absolutely necessary.” He’s about to give up when his fingers catch the edge of the box. Jack reaches further, just able to pull the box down when-
“Yes-” Gabriel squints, ringing his hands, “yes and no. It’s more complicated than that. Because then you had the other side of the coin. The Winchester’s. Shifters who fought for humans and magical beings. Dean was the eldest son. Well him and your dad hit it off as kids and always kinda drifted together. Our mother and his dad hated it, despised it. So Cas told our mother he broke off the friendship, Dean did the same with his pop. Buuuut they didn’t. It’s a long story, your dads to tell. And again, I’m leaving out a hell of a lot. Eventually the war started, and your dad, being the total rebel that he is, kept meeting with Dean and eventually they ran away and started this ol’ place.” Gabriel gestures around them to the inn.
Cas’ finishing up his sandwich when an out of place sleek, black convertible Mercedes pulls down the dirt road. A woman gets out of the car primly, chiffon scarf in her hair and sunglasses perched upon on her nose as she takes in the inn.
Mary eyes her son, smiling warmly as Ellen tosses him his sandwich. “Ohhh pb&j. Thank you Aunt Ellen!” Dean unwraps the sandwich, tearing it in half, offering half to Cas.
Lavender swirls around, eyes landing on the older Novak with a coy smile, “Gabriel, my sweet, it’s been too long.”
Cas looks back towards the path, the irises, then back towards Dean with his beaming smile. Maybe he could risk one friend for a day.
"Alright, alright but only if you promise to drink. REALLY drink! I just want you to have fun," Gabriel smiles.
"What?! Yes! Of course! Why does-?!" Dean takes a deep breathe, "Why does everyone keep asking that?"
"Oh yeah," Dean laughs half heartedly, "Sam... he... he scared the crap out of me this morning while I was under the Mustang."
He's driving down the road, windows down Metallica low in the background, and he has no idea where he's going.
The garden’s loud hum now muffled, almost mute, besides the bees working before him. Cas does so, moving his palm a smidge closer to the bee. Only a few inches left...
He lets himself drift back to sleep with distant thoughts of calloused hands and emerald eyes, stolen kisses under oak trees. Happy memories filled with laughter, love, a little sunshine.
Something changes in Dean, Cas can almost feel him thinking. "I’m so sorry Cas," Dean says looking up at him through his long lashes.
Meet Castiel Novak, owner of The Beehive Inn, busying himself in the garden and totally not avoiding his brother. While Claire and Jack get sidetracked once again with their father’s diary and cheap alcohol. (*Note: Claire and Jack are both over 21 in this AU)
“Cough it up kiddos. What’s so good you got your mini dad over here involved?” Gabriel gestures from Claire to Jack.
“You’re a real peach!” Gabriel tosses him a thumbs up over his shoulder. Running awkwardly back up the path where they’d come from.
“Dad?” Claire looks over his shoulder, eyes bulging. “This can’t be real-” She laughs to herself. “Photoshop.” She declares. “An illusion. I’ve seen witches create fake photos like this before-”
“Among other things, yes. In the beginning, there was no need for our roles to be so inflexible. Humanity was much smaller then, much more fragmented. Did you know your species was on the brink of extinction at one point?” The first hint of emotion showed in Ramiel’s expression, a bit of amusement with the scholarly dispassion. “How strange it seems now, given how widely you have spread.”
“Castiel,” the angel said in reply, nodding his head gravely to the two of them. “And Dean Winchester, I presume.”
the proud parent and they’re the kids, and then he turns his grin on Sam. “I’ll tell them all you said hi.”
“Its hold on the soul is inexorable.” Ramiel continued as though he’d never been interrupted, though his eyes had narrowed a bit more. It was always strangely satisfying, drawing out such human responses of disdain from angels. “Which is why, as I am sure you know, should the bearer die, the soul is tied to the body, made twisted and dark.”
The surprised joy that skittered across Cas’s face was gratifying, and gave Dean a bit more determination to see this thing through. “Okay. Ready?” he asked. The arm that didn’t bore the mark came up, hand clutching at the sleeve of Cas’s coat in an unconscious attempt to brace himself.
Objectively, he’d had far better kisses, but with the way his head just went quiet and the hushed sense of satisfaction and belonging that filled his heart at the slow, contented press of Cas’s lips against his, he couldn’t recall a single one of them. When they parted, his breath was coming faster. His chest felt tight with happiness, like some long-estranged part of him had finally come home, and his face felt like it could split from how wide his grin grew. “Took us long enough,” he joked, seeing his own dizzy joy reflected in Cas’s warm smile.
The bitch face he got in return was one Sam would have been proud of. The effect was somewhat lessened though as alarm briefly overtook it before disappearing into more blinding light.
Sam teases him, squinting through the sun, “You’re just trying to cut out the middle man.” Dean squints back with an expression that makes Sam smirk. “If you grow your own food then you won’t have to go to the grocery store. One less human you have to deal with.”
I wrote this one really fast, since it came to me in a whirlwind, and really late at night so if there is any reprehensible grammar I apologize. If anyone likes this storyline let me know. There's a world in which this might become a thing.
Dean and Cas pose as a couple in order to scope out an empath. Which makes things all kinds of awkward when she mentions how clearly in love with one another they are. (This is all Sam's doing.)
This song references the Wild West tale of the actual Doolin-Dalton outlaw gang, but this story has nothing to do with them in specific. I'm just borrowing the period and atmosphere.
At the end, Dean had wanted to get out. He’d never thought the day would come that he’d outgrow the blaze of glory, hail of bullets destiny he’d always pictured for himself. He’d resigned himself to that eventuality. Dean had even glorified it in his mind to make it not so goddamned depressing. Heroic, even. But some time between being dragged through hell and burning one too many of his best friends, Dean just got tired. He started to believe that maybe, just maybe, they’d done enough. He dared to let himself wonder if maybe he didn’t have to end that way after all; he’d even allowed himself brief moments to hope that is was realistic that they could get out. It was hard thing to keep in mind after so many years of acceptance of death, but at the end, before Michael, he was ready to put effort into
. They seem to move at the same time, inching into the center of the bed and folding into and around each other like it's second nature until Dan is pressed to Castiel once again, his head resting on Castiel's chest. Castiel falls more easily into sleep than he ever has before with the solid, warm weight of Dean's body against his own.
Sam remembers being a vessel. He remembers pretty much all of it. The most horrifying part being that he remembers how right it felt. He hated it, hated him, but he also felt how true it all had been - that he was built for it. There were things he knew, implicitly. Such as the reality that Lucifer had an almost sweet, naive sort of affinity for Sam. He was a wicked, evil, violent thing, but he had his weaknesses. Sam was one of them. He felt... affection for him. And Sam knew that. Could feel that. It was, in part, an element of Sam’s success in overcoming him. Lucifer, for his many evils, chose not to make the act of possession torturous for Sam. He wanted them to be a unit, knew they’d be stronger together.
in that quiet way he does now, that he needs to go. There’s a desperation underneath the calm of his furrowed brow and strong set of his jaw that Sam is certain no one else could read quite so plainly. Few people truly understand Dean, and no one but Sam ever really knew him well enough to see him despite his well-honed pretenses. No one except for Cas. Castiel was the only other person who knew Dean like that and he is gone, and the hole left behind is so treacherously painful that neither of them can even acknowledge that he was ever there. But Sam knows he would have seen the desperate
He’s put himself in the situation where strangers approach him daily, and every day he has to fight a little less not to mutter cristo under his breath or god forbid just knife them on the spot. So far all they’ve done is order food, pay for it, and either sit down to eat or leave. They’re just people. Just regular people. Like Dean pretends to be now.
When Sam was fresh from Stanford, all anger and resentment, he couldn’t listen. He was smart, he’s always smart, but he was bull-headed and he’d rather ram his horns into you that let you get a word in. Now that Dean’s a person that isn’t good at arguing, he’s had time to watch his brother argue. There’s no shortage of fight in Sam, but he’s mellowed in his age. He’s gotten more cunning, more careful. And he’s patient.
Cas left the hunting life when he and Dean both realized that Dean, in his current state and mindframe, could never be the partner Cas deserved. Two years later, Dean shows up out of the blue, on a hot summer night, in the culmination of a decade long shared infatuation.
Castiel is on a mission. Sam can see it in his eyes. Dean seems oblivious as ever and Sam wants to shove him outside with Castiel in hopes that he'll get with the frigging program.
Full disclaimer: I am neither a doctor nor an amputee. This is a quickly written ficlet and therefore the research has been minimal so I have flirted with fact and written around what little I do know. Hopefully the depiction is character-driven and respectful enough that no one is offended.
For another two weeks Dean only barely wakes, hardly moves, doesn’t seem to receive anything Sam says. His expression remains vacant. His waking is unpredictable and it keeps Sam hungry and exhausted at his side until the other start taking shifts to watch him. They feed him, update him on what’s going on in the world, but after the first time one of them dares to try and gets a teary, livid tirade in response none of them attempt to convince Sam to take a night off. Sam refused to leave, just in case.
He listens to the rain hitting the shop windows, and the pavement outside, cracks the little window in the back so he can smell the damp air and hear the overrun gutters and he thinks of Cas.
Every morning he starts by cleaning. Maybe it’s redundant, since every night, he ends by cleaning. But there’s something comfortingly systematic about it. Tidying. It’s repetitive and simple. He sanitizes every countertop as well as the sinks, restocks all of his tools and cutlery from the industrial dishwasher, re-sets the things he needs from the proper storage places he had returned them to the night before. His brother seems consistently surprised by Dean’s very specific daily procedures but that too follows the well-memorized routine. Sam has spent more time in close quarters with Dean than any other person that has ever existed but still, he never really managed to acknowledge this part of him - the calm Dean derives from the default action of tidiness. Dean has always been organized to a fault when he’s been serious about something, and has always excelled at hiding it. With hunting, he was painfully orchestrated in his visage of carelessness. When he tossed something in the trunk, seemingly without looking, it was because he’d planned to; he’d done it a million times before, knew exactly where it would land. When he left beer cans around, or his socks in the sink, it was because he was playing his role. And that was just as important, it seemed to him, as his constant, methodical cleaning of their guns, or the diligent maintenance of the car. The sloppy visage of Dean’s devil-may-care character was always belied by how immaculately he was groomed, how tightly every shirt was rolled and stacked into his duffel, how prepared he was at any and every moment to bug out of any given motel room - every item, every bullet, every toiletry exact where he knew it would be. Dean had rarely spent time with anyone long enough for these compulsions to be noticed, and Sam was too close to him to really parse the specifics. These were traits grown from a lifetime of child rearing as a child himself, control within the chaos that facilitated otherwise painful processes; a lifetime of living in the shadow of a marine; a lifetime spent learning to smile through lies and wink through pain, a lifetime at war.
He worries about the future. The collective human future. And not in the specific, dire ways that he used to when the apocalypse seemed ever-looming and the threat of Croatoan or Michael v. Lucifer was legitimate and just narrowly missed. No, now he worries about politics, and smog and triglycerides. He tries to throw himself wholeheartedly into those worries because he thinks, he hopes, that it can distract him from the bigger issues.
It’s the fastest he’s been able to say anything since he didn’t die. Sam has a wayward seed in his hair, but he smiles big and bright. Dean rolls his eyes again, his cheeks warm.
He sleeps lightly, every sound rousing him quickly, with a hand already clenching for a weapon and pupils already dilating. The empty hours of his evenings seem endless without research or driving or investigating with Sam. He thought he would be relieved to be able to rest, to take the time to be lazy. But he lies awake at night, feeling like a useless coward. Feeling, in those quiet moments more than ever like he has betrayed his very purpose by choosing to be free. He wonders how many innocent lives have been ripped to shreds, how many other little boys’ mothers are stolen away, while he lays in his bed feeling sorry for himself.
. But ultimately, the challenge and the activity felt good. It wasn’t life or death, there was very little stress involved with studs and drywall. When he collapsed into his mattress those nights he actually slept, felled hard like a tree into his memory foam and out like a light within minutes. Restful sleep was such a rarity, Dean actually felt better despite the constant ache of his body. He felt stronger than he had in a long time. And he enjoyed the long hours with Sam, quiet though they were. It was nice to work alongside him. They didn’t talk much, hardly looked at each other, but they made a good team and Dean was comfortable. Also a rarity.
This is the last chapter of my (mostly timely) month-long ficlet challenge. Thanks so much to anyone who left kudos or comments. This is the first thing I've posted here so I really appreciate the feedback.
Also me: realizes I now have to write a ficlet inspired by it. "Uhhhh, ok... wait a minute... Crap."
It isn’t always easy to be himself, but every once in awhile it slips out - like a sneeze. A Dean-sneeze. Unanticipated and unstoppable and seizing his whole body. And brief.
“That’s the point!” Sam shouts, but the sight of his brother’s wide eyes deflate him and he slouches heavily into his chair, exhaling. “I feel like... without a case we’re just... not able to - Do you remember when you got snatched by that Djinn? You said you ended up in this imperfect Pleasantville where mom had never died. We never became hunters and,” he stares at Dean expectantly, “we never really clicked.”
He cooked for them. Cleaned their guns. Mostly stayed out of the way, but he couldn’t listen to the cases, the stories of death and blood and vanished people. He couldn’t even offer up his thirty years of knowledge because his brain had been through the Archangel scramble and somewhere between his brain stem and his lips everything went sideways and wrong. So he couldn’t help. And he couldn’t sleep with so many bodies milling around. He couldn’t relax. He couldn’t keep track of whether they should all be familiar, these people from the other world. He knew, objectively, that he should recognize at least a handful of them. Sam was a gracious and kind go-between, and even some of the strangers went out of their way to be friendly. But ultimately, Dean felt out of place.
To keep himself busy, to make himself normal, Dean opens a savings account. He sees a doctor, without anything being broken for the first time in over thirty years. He reads the news and tries to stay informed, he listens to NPR in the early mornings when he’s setting up the kitchen, and waits to switch to classic rock until the shop is open. He balances his checkbook and places his orders for the shop and is an all-around responsible small business owner.
Dean can’t stand the constant talking or even the living underground. He needs air, and solitude. He doesn’t want anyone around to see him wince when he gets up from sitting too long or flinches when he turns wrong, or when someone touches him and his skin burns.
And in reality, his rational mind had reasoned that Castiel could never stay. There were plenty of reasons why an existence after hunting would mean that Cas ceased to be a part of his life. It made sense, that after Dean gave up the fight, Cas would give up Dean. They were brothers in arms, and without a war to fight, Cas would be needed elsewhere. He was a creature of purpose. Much like Dean had always seen himself as being. Even knowing this, though, Dean could never picture life without him. He ignored this, tried to pretend it meant nothing, that it was just a side effect of so many years of familiarity.
Life kinda got on top of me, so I've missed a few days. But I'm too stubborn to take the loss, so at some point I'll end up posting like three chapters in one day to make up for it.
Even undead, Dean can't leave well enough alone. Demon!Dean returns to the bunker to wreak havoc on Sam and Cas.
It wasn’t difficult to orchestrate the little shop a scant forty five minutes away from the bunker. Dean’s head had throbbed as he had tried to read about business loans and taxes and property value, but Sam, steadfast as he’d ever been, simply absorbed the challenge into his daily duties of delegation and lore-scouring. They’d gotten good enough with the tricks Charlie had taught them that faking what they needed in order to look legitimate wasn’t as hard as it really should have been.
He’s a cook now. That’s his calling. His dedication goes into kneading dough and setting the oven. He sneers when Sam calls him, accurately so, a “baker”. To Dean, baking is a woman’s hobby, or a jovial fat man with a red nose and sausage-fingers. Dean’s not a baker. He’s a cook. And he tells his brother so. Sam looks disappointed, which serves to make Dean’s self-worth dip just a bit lower than where it usually rests just below sea level, but he says nothing. That hurts too. Sam used to argue; he used to roll his eyes and tell Dean why he was wrong. But that part of their relationship has fizzled, and amidst all the ruin of the past thirty years, Dean can’t stomach to untangle why. That way lies madness because he knows, he won’t acknowledge it but he knows, that this is his fault too. Sam’s new reluctance to speak up.
Neither of the brothers thought Dean would be the one to leave first, but ultimately it was too much. The noise, the bustle, the constant reminder of a war still waging. A war he was built for, and now could have no part of. A war leaving his brothers and sisters in arms battered and bloodied day after day, with him helpless to do anything but look on. He doesn’t feel like a man who can take care of people anymore. He isn’t sure he ever was.
dying. As they faced-off against Lucifer one last time, Dean told himself that he was done, that they were all going to be done, and he meant it.
The fake-dating/fake-relationship trope has been done a lot but you know what? I'll never NOT read one of those. I love all of them. Especially when they are in the SPN universe. But I've actually never written one myself. So I may have to continue this.
Sam put his own mug down, face immediately switching into business mode. “So, as soon as you called me, I had an idea.”
Cas actually laughs at that, a small, huff of a thing. "I would've thought it'd be obvious by now that when it comes to you, there's very little I wouldn't do."
Dean paused. “Kind of hungry?” he said automatically. What about him? It took a second to realize, but he felt…
The shadow lifts from Jack’s face, but the bruised feeling in Sam’s heart doesn’t go away. It stays there, gnawing at him as Jack steps into the doorway they open, and even drowns out the way Dean shuffles and paces and grumbles under his breath for every long minute that passes without it reappearing.
“I’m not sure coffee at this time of night is wise,” Cas says mildly, using his thumb to turn the page. He doesn’t even look up at Dean, and Dean is suddenly just so, so exhausted with this.
. It's only 8am and yes it's hotter than hell today especially in the garage but he's used to it. He's humming along with the radio, tinkering under the car when he hears the door open. He slides out knowing it's Bobby, the shop's owner and the guy who pretty much raised him and Sam.
“Hiya then! I’m Dean,” the green eyed boy smiles bright, interrupting Cas’ train of thought. Cas looks up again to find him offering to shake Cas’ hand.
Gabriel rears back eyes wide, “GEEZ- You read it?!” Looking to Claire, “You corrupted your brother, I’m proud of you BUT that’s for another time-” Looking back to them both, but obviously contemplating his next actions before sighing heavily. “Talk about a rock and a hard place. You’re dads already gonna kill me or send me into the next dimension when he finds out about this,” Gabriel massages his temple, “SO I might as well have fun before I inevitably die…” Gabriel collects himself, trying to choose his words carefully. Gods I knew this day would come but couldn’t I have got some damn warning? He chides himself. Huffing as he looks between the two persistent Novak’s. “The cliff notes version is… Dean Winchester... The Winchesters were an odd constant in our lives growing up. They were always kinda there. You know about about our parents. Well the Winchesters were sorta one of their biggest enemies. They were everything The Miltons weren’t. Fighters for the little people.” Gabriel sing songs, hooking his elbow, as he pacing anxiously. “You either loved the Winchesters or you hated them. Our mother tried to make alliances with them but Dean’s father refused every time. He wasn’t really the ‘alliance’ kinda guy. He hated magic users as much as our parents and family disliked shifters. Did I mention that?” Jack and Claire both shake their heads. “Yeaah. So you had two sides of a coin. One side was the miltons, rich elite prissy magical bags of dicks who thought they deserved everything, literally they wanted to rule over everyone.”
Imagined future within the universe of SPN wherein they rescue Cas from that Kentucky Fried DISASTER of a character known as Asmodeus and Dean gets himself good and riled up from having seen Cas in mortal peril after JUST having gotten him back.
Huh, Dean looks at him, all long limbs and calculating mind, sprawled across a wiry chair like he’s got the time to wait, to let Dean decide what he wants to say. Sam is patient.
So, I’ve failed utterly in posting every day BUT I have succeeded in writing every day which was kind of the point. Basically, at work we are in tech for a new show and I’ve barely even seen my apartment let alone the internet for the past week so that is my excuse.
Dean still wakes up in a cold sweat and has to stumble to the bathroom to wretch when he remembers that particular incident. He’d been fighting Michael tooth and nail, even shaking him off once or twice, for a few seconds at a time. The small victories hadn’t yet afforded him anything but the satisfaction of Michael’s furious irritation at Dean’s persistence, that slight inkling of confusion and doubt that skittered across his grace, as though he wasn’t sure how Dean - lowly, piddly, human Dean - could possibly overpower him.
He clears out a patch of grass in front of the house, tills it (he thinks) and glares very hard at it for an extended period of time. He doesn’t know jack shit about gardening and he’s pretty sure that isn’t something he lost in the Archangel Scramble.
In which Castiel is a weary, stalwart officer of the local sheriff’s department and Dean is the local badboy grifter who is constantly in trouble.
Dean is a man who breaks things. He’s a man who’s killed and tortured and he has blood on his hands and evil in his heart. He isn’t a person who should be pouring delicate French batter onto a stove top with exacting precision and patience. But here he is, doing just that.
After awhile Dean starts to move. Little impulses that don’t seem entirely intentional. But every once in a while he acknowledges Sam, looks him in the eyes. And eventually he can blink for yes or no, though he gets confused and overwhelmed easily. By a lack of memory, or too many questions.
At first he reaches to the small of his back, out of instinct, for a gun he no longer carries. There’s a figure, a man, outside his window - too close not to have been watching Dean, too still to be simply caught in the rain. Dean doesn’t move, pinned to the spot in a way the old him never would have been. He’s immobilized by the scramble of his former instincts, no longer readily available.
I was thinking, “You can’t post this using the same song as the previous one!” And then I remembered, yes I fucking can because who’s in charge here? It’s me. I just continued to listen to the same song, so, thanks for all the inspiration Regina.
Alex came down as soon as Sam called, put in for family emergency leave and taught Sam everything she could about how to care for him. She hooked him to stolen machines, catheterized him, defibrillated him the few times in that first forty eight hours that his heart gave out. She took Sam’s hand while she explained all of the damage that might have been caused, the permanence of it, the likelihood of it. And then she stayed with him, as Dean slept, still and skeletal-looking.  Sam was certain he’d be that way forever, but he kept on anyway, and Alex did the same - changing his IVs,  washing him and tucking blankets around him and talking to him.
Dean had enough ill-gotten cash that he didn’t have to set himself too severe a deadline. Though he worried that without the motivation he’d sink into apathy and rot in the house, the lack of anxiety at having to make decisions at a breakneck speed relaxed him. He’d been rushing in some way or another for the entirety of his adult life, and living from wall to wall and beer to beer eased some of the panic out of him. He worked sincerely, but not as quickly as maybe he once would have. He savored each project, each stumbling block. Then he would look up and so much more would be done - tangible visual evidence of his and Sam’s hard work that made Dean feel human and accomplished.
When the lightning strikes again, Dean knows where to look and it’s bright enough that Dean has time to register what he’s seeing.
In truth, his mind conjures memories of him all the time. But these quiet, lonely moments are when Dean lets himself sink into it. He hadn’t known until after Michael, after an archangel had ripped into his mind and torn everything out so he was forced to look at it, to look at himself himself, raw and without pretense or bravado or a place to hide.
He wants to try out the recipe for crepes he’s been researching. It doesn’t look too impossible, and they have the versatility of savory and sweet. He’s been wanting to try making them for over a year but has only just worked up the courage to attempt something that looks so... fragile.
Veteran Dean is home, but only mostly in one piece. He's not adjusting well and it seems like the only person he can stand to be around is their weird neighbor, Cas.
There was a period of time, in the beginning, when Dean had just been spit out by Michael and there was no way he was going to survive, that his body baffled him. It was as though he didn’t know how to use it anymore. With Michael gone, much of the angelic maintenance dissipated with his death, leaving Dean with the muscle mass of a coma patient and a sudden need for nutrients he hadn’t received in months. Sam will never forget the look of it, the nightmare transformation of Dean’s body collapsing on itself, crushing in with sudden starvation.
Dean has always loved making music. He’s only just barely, after four successful albums, three tours and seven years in the business become comfortable with calling himself a musician. He always thought he tinkered and got lucky. But, here he is, on the road again, with a full caravan of fellow musicians, technicians, drivers, and roadies criss-crossing America on what might be his biggest American tour.
For another two weeks Dean only barely wakes, hardly moves, doesn’t seem to receive anything Sam says. His expression remains vacant. His waking is unpredictable and it keeps Sam hungry and exhausted at his side until the other start taking shifts to watch him. They feed him, update him on what’s going on in the world, but after the first time one of them dares to try and gets a teary, livid tirade in response none of them attempt to convince Sam to take a night off. Sam refused to leave, just in case.
No, he’s pretty sure he never knew anything about earth and seed and growing things. He has an uncanny desire to learn, of a sudden.
Sam is alive, that’s true. But, much to Dean’s surprise, it seems like he’s not done after all. Dean can’t find in himself to hold all of the years of Sam toeing the line of retirement against him. Dean’s always understood that struggle, the innate desire to live a normal life, even when he refused to admit so out loud. He can’t say his heart doesn’t ache knowing that Sam didn’t follow him out of the life, knowing that Sam, even now, had to zig when Dean couldn’t help but zag. In a way - though it hurts every time - Dean is always ready for Sam to need something different. In a way, he wasn’t unprepared for civilian life to have less of Sam in it.
Dean worries about unusual things now - how much water he’s using, whether stocking plastic utensils at the shop is bad for the environment, how much of his hearing he’s really lost, if he should have opened some sort of life insurance policy for himself in case the past comes back to bite him and there’s no one left for Sam.
Sam keeps his room at the bunker empty, of course, set up just the way Dean painstakingly organized it. It stays closed, like an offering of respect to the Dean he used to be. The Dean he was, before he said “Yes”. Sometimes when Sam feels hollow without him there, he opens the door, flicks on the light and looks around. In that way, it’s as though his brother had died and Sam needs these occasional brief reminders to pick at that scab, to remember and see, physically, that Dean really was here.
They don’t talk to him. The survivors. Sam doesn’t go into detail but he sheepishly mentions one day, as vaguely as possible, that Dean may have been a little frightening back in the early days of his return to consciousness and upright mobility. Dean doesn’t remember a lot of that time, but he figures he must have been something. Because these people are from the apocalypse-world, but the older ones always look wary while the younger ones look outright scared to be alone with him. So no, Dean doesn’t have a great relationship with the horde of strangers living in his once-home.
“I- I don’t know. I’ve never heard Uncle Gabe or anyone mention it.” Jack shakes his head. Racking his brain for any mention of a Camp Chitaqua in his years of listening to survivors and Gabriel tell their stories growing up. He’d always loved talking to the guest and hearing about their adventures.
"Gaaaabbb, it's so comfortable here!," Castiel whines from the huge couch they'd found downstairs with some people Gabriel knew, "I wanna stay with your friends!"
“That’s ok.” Dean shrugs easily. “We’ll stay right here. I have to stay where my momma can see me too.” He swivels around, bolting into across the grass. He turns back, “Aren’t ya coming?”
Dean rolls his eyes and pulls Cas close, "For what! Doing my civic duty? I don't care what he does."
They’re quiet, almost missable. But Cas has been practicing and knows the hum of his bees anywhere. Cas smiles proudly to himself, but doesn’t lose his centre. Holding onto the bees vibrations at his core.
"Dean? Dean? What are you doing here? Is everything ok?" Cas says trying to calm down the man in his arms.
“It’s not gonna bite ya.” Dean shakes his head, urging Cas to shake his hand. “Come on plllleeasse?”
.” The body behind Cas runs their open palm along Cas’ shoulder. Cas flinches away, but they pull him back harshly. “Na-ah-ah! You see while you’ve been away playing house with the dogs and that good for nothing brother of yours, I’ve been training, as you should’ve been.”
'?" Gabriel says putting his drink down, "No! You drink up Cas! Because tonight we're on a mission."
He remembers Gabriel reciting. Cas feels calmness wash over him, at ease. Smiling to himself as he eyes the bee softly once more. “Hello there.” He leans upon the railing, kneeling on the bench. His palm gently reaching for the purple flowers, “it’s ok little buddy.” The bee leaps down, buzzing from bloom to bloom, inching closer to Cas’ palm.
“Pretty please!” Claire interrupts him, hugging Jack tight, throwing her arms around his waist, “You’re just so tall. OR you could just use your mind?” She wiggles her brows, blue eyes twinkling. “I mean I would but I’m just a plain old non magical human.” She pouts, bottom lip out.
Dust and dirt billow over the duo. Jack brings the large box over to the attic table. Claire runs over the table, practically tossing the boxes of mementos Jack had been previously going through onto the cloth covered couch, making room for the trunk.
Anna laughs and is about to comment when the the glass doors to the gallary swing open wildly behind them.
“My n-name?” Cas is borderline terrified now. Not sure if he should run or coach the boy on proper introductions.
“Hey it’s ok bud. I’ve just got a little work to take care of with mom. You just stick around here and I promise I’ll be back in a jiff.” He winks, standing and hugging Cas’ thin shoulders.
“Oh hell no. This is waaayyy too much power for you two knuckleheads. If your father had any idea you found this, and knew I knew, HAH! All three of our heads, ON A PLATTER.” Gabriel motions exploding, “Meltdown of the century.”
Dean turns around and comes back halfway yelling, "I'm dead serious! If I don't get a call back within 72 hours I'm gonna be so heart broken!"
Gabriel runs his hand upon the stones at his feet, palm outstretched, fingers twisting as he scratches his nails roughly into the rock.
Jack purses, fingering through the records, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, ABBA-, “Well we shouldn’t invade his privacy.” He stops abruptly, wait a second, he flips back. “Also we’re finding out a lot about him today. I thought he hated Fleetwood Mac.” Jack raises his brow, holding up a copy of Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors on vinyl.
"No, seriously listen. I like you. Like I have dreams about you. Since you know the whole," he lowered his voice to imitate Cas’, "I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition’ thing."
“I’m not a kid anymore Claire. You don’t have to tiptoe around the subject of my birth father, ok?” He slips a whiskey bottle off the shelf, grabbing two glasses and coming back. “I know he- I know he wasn’t a good man. He was troubled.” Jack struggles to get out. “Just start where you left off.” He drops into the arm chair, pouring himself a glass before offering Claire one.
He wishes Gabriel were here. His elder brother was so much better at hypnosis. He was better at everything it seemed.
Dean reaches out for Cas’ hand. Treating it like its glass, he grasps lightly. Afraid if he holds too tight Cas will shatter into pieces.
. Castiel let's out a breath he didn't know he was holding and let's go of the railing he didn't realize
"Stop being a baby! Just drink the damn thing! It'll make all the 6's turn into 10's, if ya know what I mean," Gabriel nudges him.
Dean feels where Bobby's looking on his forehead and feels the bruise coming up, "Sam, showed up this morning while I was under the Mustang and caught me off gaurd."
“Well you know, it’s a touchy time. The worst is at night. He had a nightmare two weeks ago that sorta kicked off everything and blew half the fuses in the house. I just fixed it without telling him because I didn’t wanna freak him out worse and blow the other half.”
"Hey, whoa! You're a loopy and gold digger drunk? Huh, who knew?" Gabriel says looking over Castiel then pulling him back away.
Claire and Jack tackle him into another hug, air struggling from his lungs. Gabriel’s panicking inside, yet deep down there’s a spark of excitement. It’s been too long since he’s got into mischief.
I just wanted to update anyone following along and let you know I’ll be slowly rewriting this over the next week or so. Hopefully after it’s rewritten it will flow much better! Thank you again for reading!💛”
“Just relax and listen. Actually, grab two beers. We need alcohol. I read half dad’s diary last night and just reached a mention of you-”
“Around the inn. I’ve heard the name Winchester, and in dads book he mentions,” he points down towards the opened passage, “The Winchesters. Do you think-“
. You really believe you belong here. I mean I’ve heard the stories about your little setup or whatever. But I just had to come see for myself-”
"Seriously dude? I just wanna hold you. We can do the good stuff when I’m running on all cylinders and Sammy isn’t having his own prom with the take out," Dean winks.
“Ewww please nooo.” Dean falls, sliding down Ellen’s side. He pops up onto his elbows quickly, hair going every which way, “Momma can Cas please eat lunch with us? Please?”
Another bee flying by catches Cas’ attention. Snapping him out of his spiraling thoughts. He scrambles off the bench hurriedly, heading straight for the pond. Cas smiles outwardly, practically skipping as he follows the new bee along its route to the lily pads. Another one of his favorite gems in the garden. The bee buzzes out into the array of crisp white, pink, green lillies. Cas hums letting himself sit down in the grass.
“You’re such a peculiar being Castiel.” They look over Cas in awe for a moment before clapping their hands moving on with a laugh, “
“When’s the last time you slept?” Gabriel grabs his brothers shoulders, stopping him fully. Looking over Cas’ thrown together, disheveled appearance. Cas’ sunken eyes, the same tee shirt as yesterday. Gabriel’s younger brother is usually quite put together, jeans and a tee shirt on a yard work day, but he isn’t looking too well-
"Yes. You ARE. I'm done with your mopy ass. I know what you're thinking and no, he's not out of you're your league thanks to my professional work on you! You actually clean up half well! Now if you were wearing that damned tench coat and your converse it'd be another story. BUT no, I SPENT
Claire flips the pages so fast they almost rip, flipping, flipping, until she reaches the end. Upon the last page there’s a simple passage.
?” The voice bites out, prowling closer. “Did you honestly believe we wouldn’t find you?” They laugh, “You were never even lost.” Now breathing down the back of Cas’ neck.
