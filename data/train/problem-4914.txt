“I’m just—I’m sorry. That’s all I can say.”
Dean is having a terrible day.
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean mumbles, voice gruff. He briefly remembers a time when he could just glance at Cas and look away, where he didn’t feel absolutely compelled to revise Cas’s features every chance he got, forever fearful that it might be the last. Dean often rationalises this to himself by thinking that losing someone as many times as he’s lost Cas will do that to you.
Sam and Eileen share their first kiss as an unofficially wedded couple, and Dean pretends not to notice Cas’ eyes on him in the aftermath.
just doesn’t have the same ring to it.”
A smile tinged with unconcealable sadness forms on Cas’s lips and he fixes Dean with a stare. Dean can practically see the cogs turning in Cas’s mind, and he braces himself for whatever profound feel-good speech Cas is about to spout.
The tender touch makes his heart lurch in his chest and Dean casts his eyes skyward, trying to suppress the burn of unshed tears that taunts him behind his eyes.
“Just checking in.” Luckily, Sam knows Dean well enough to realise that pity isn’t what he needs. Thankfully, there’s no soft expression or sympathetic head tilt in sight.
“I’ve finally managed to settle in somewhere else. I’ve put down roots somewhere I’m actually
“I’m scared.” Dean practically flinches at the way his voice sounds, quiet and on the verge of cracking. “I know it’s stupid, right? I don’t even really know what I’m scared of. It’s just, every time I look at you, or Jack, or Sam I just think—
“You think it’s
No. Please don’t go. I need you here. I don’t know how to do this without you anymore.
Dean flinches. He can’t see much of anything from his disadvantaged position down the hallway, hiding like a coward, but he can hear Sam’s voice crisp and clear as day.
Pulling away, Sam claps a large hand down onto Cas’ shoulder and turns to head up into the library. He gestured for Cas to follow him. “Come on. We should run through stuff before people start showing up.” Cas nods and starts to follow.
With a small shake of his head and a smile, Sam drops his hand from Dean’s shoulder. “Unlike some of us, I actually prefer to be coherent from time to time. Apologies.”
“I just—I know Cas leaving again can’t have been easy. Probably not the outcome you wanted.” Nevermind.
The dam breaks. He drops Cas’ hands and squeezes his eyes shut, tries to rid his mind’s eye of things he’ll probably never be able to let himself have—things he doesn’t deserve.
Nodding wordlessly, Dean doesn’t try to force himself to speak. He knows the attempt won’t yield any fruit; there’s not much of anything to be said, as it is.
“Yeah, I—I know, it’s just—“ mumbles Dean, “I had a nightmare. Bad one.” He leans back towards Cas, resting against his bare chest.
And it’s inexplicable that Cas looks hurt, but Dean feels regret all the same at his words. His shameless act of self preservation has somehow managed to upset Cas. Dean thinks for a moment about how he understands why Cas thinks he’s better off without him.
There’s a pause, infinitesimal, before Cas queries, “worms?” and Dean shakes his head in amusement, feeling a smile break out across his face, in spite of the topic of conversation.
Frowning, Cas steps out from Dean’s embrace and grabs his hands tenderly. His gaze locks onto the offending wound and he brushes his thumb over the bruising. “You need to be more careful, Dean,” he sighs, “I’m human now. I can’t heal you like before.”
me, okay? Just go. I’m doing you a damn favour here. You—you can find somebody else up there. Someone who doesn’t remind you of all the shit that’s gone wrong in your life.”
He’d picked up a job at a garage in the neighbourhood when he lived with Lisa. It was something he knew how to do without training or effort; the routine of fix-ups and oil changes and engine checks had been drilled into him for as long as Dean could remember.
“I—uh. I heard something about
Soft, tinny radio music and the aroma of cooking carry through from the kitchen, and Dean’s home.
Dean snaps, “jealous? Of what? Once a fortnight sex and never getting a damn minute to yourself? Yeah, man, I’m cut up.”
The real prize is that Dean even still feels a little drunk, dry mouth and all. Getting a drinksuddenly seems like the best idea he’s ever had, the bunker’s kitchen an oasis in the world’s driest desert.
He nudges Cas’ foot with his own and watches as he breaks out into a broad grin.
It’s while he’s checking for Eileen’s position that he regrettably catches Cas’ eye. He’s watching everything unfold, expression indecipherable, and Dean feels as though he’s been gut punched. Sam’s harsh voice cuts through the room, and they both look away.
It’s over far too quickly and Cas pulls away, eyes wide and transfixed on Dean’s mouth. His eyebrows dip and furrow, hands falling away from Dean’s face, and he
Tension starts to build within Dean, and he recognises the telltale signs of getting close to the end of his tether, close to lashing out and misplacing his anger. He can’t push it with Sam—not after their tiff—so Dean checks himself and draws in a breath with a tight smile.
Dean’s just been too chickenshit to go and see him. He’s terrified of finding out that Cas is happy, flourishing,
There’s a sudden curling in the pit of Dean’s stomach as Cas resituates himself, pressing them flush together. “Yeah?” he gulps.
There’s bits of pink silly string in his hair and down the back of his shirt courtesy of Claire, and it keeps tickling the back of his neck and making him squirm whenever he moves. She’s lucky he’s a little too far gone to chase her down in hopes of getting her back. Dean promises to himself that he’ll start planning his revenge when there’s no longer two of everything in front of him.
Dean knows there’s a bottle of something stashed somewhere in here, but can’t quite remember where. Just as well—he knows he’d feel ten times worse after guzzling it down; not that it makes the temptation any less rife. Staring at the same spot on the wall in front of him, Dean does his best to ignore the incessant pounding behind his eyes.
Dean feels a wicked pang in his chest. He thinks of all the times he’d felt as though something was missing whenever Cas wasn’t around, how he’d watched Cas die right in front of him and felt like a part of him had died alongside him, felt a gaping, open wound across his chest when he’d watched him walk out and not look back.
“I now pronounce you husband and wife,” Cas says with a wide smile, an accomplished finality to his words.
“Look, I can’t tell you what to do. God, if I could. What I
“No big,” she says cheerily. Dean hears Jody’s voice down the line, hears Donna’s jovial laugh and finds he feels a little lonely. “Just checking in.”
He's never been more relieved to set foot back in the bunker. However, the third step from the top of the stairway croaks an all too familiar complaint when Dean sets his foot down. “You're kidding me.” He stops.
He’s stepping back into the war room, standing beneath the metal railing when he hears the door open. Heart all but plummeting into his stomach, Dean cringes.
Such as with most things that weigh on him, Dean
Sam’s not far away, just floating around the room keeping up appearances and thanking everybody for coming out. It’s the kind of effort Dean hasn’t bothered to make in lieu of focusing on the few people here that he actually wants to see, so every time somebody he doesn’t recognise looks as though they’re about to try and talk to him, he turns tail and grabs another beer. Everybody has their routine.
Charlie and Dean are left alone, shrouded in silence. Not knowing what to say to her isn’t something that Dean’s ever actually struggled with before, because it’s
Cas laughs and leans into the touch, the side of his head lolling against Dean’s ear, “you smell like cars.”
Dean laughs, the sound empty and brittle, “he shouldn’t. I ruined his wedding day.” His throat thickens and Dean takes another swig of water before dragging a hand down over his face. God, he’s exhausted.
He’d stumbled to his feet on autopilot and hugged Sam first before moving onto Eileen and watching over her shoulder as his brother pulled his phone from his pocket.
better is like something heavy pressing down on Dean’s chest.
at video games, but she thinks she’s awesome because I let her win all the time,” Kaia admits with an indulgent smile before abruptly looking over at Dean and lifting her pointer finger at him, “tell her that and you’re as good as dead.”
His own venomous words from earlier try their hardest to play back in his head, but Dean somehow manages to push them from the forefront of his mind. It’s probably the greatest act of strength he’s exhibited in a while.
“This—me leaving—isn’t about you. It’s about me. This is just something I have to do for myself.”
Against all of his better judgement, Dean pushes himself upright and out of bed. It’s difficult to keep the urge to vomit at bay as the room starts to spin the second he sets his feet on the floor, even in darkness. The alcohol still pumping through his veins heightens everything, and Dean winces as the ice cold floor presses up against the soles of his feet as he stands.
“I love you,” he says, “I know I don’t say it enough, but I do.”
“I mulled over that decision for longer than I can express to you. For longer than you could comprehend. It didn’t come easily.” How Cas manages to keep his voice so irritatingly level all the time, Dean will never understand.
“Nobody...nobody deserves any of this shit. I’m lying to Claire and I’m lying to Sam acting like it’s all okay because I’m scared that if I don’t I’ll stop and actually realise you’re gone and just
“Why can't you ever just drop it?” scoffs Dean, rolling off the other man. He sits up and resituates himself on the edge of the bed, pulling his sodden shirt over his head and throwing it in the direction of their hamper. Even facing away from Cas, he can picture the puzzled expression on his face, and it makes him feel like shit. “Way to kill the mood. Jesus.”
Dean’s heart stutters, and he can’t stand it. “Hey,” he says, and marvels at the fact that his voice doesn’t shake.
“So there’s no chance? That’s it?” God, Sam’s finally reached pitiful, and his dejected, secondhand-sad face makes Dean want to curl up and die, puke and punch him all at the same time.
Angle permitting, he could kick himself twenty times over for pushing Cas away as many times as he has, and tries not to think about whether they could’ve had this sooner if he’d just got his shit together.
Dean scoffs, “not an eavesdropping thing my
“No—it’s, uh—it’s probably for the best that we forget about last night anyway. Too complicated.”
He yaps in agreement and Dean hears Cas laugh quietly. The sound makes his heart twist in his chest and it doesn’t scare him one bit. Dean smiles as he registers the fact.
The sigh that emanates from Sam tells him that he’d heard Dean’s words the same way. He claps his hands to his knees and pushes himself up. Dean knows he’s being difficult, and that his brother thankfully knows him well enough to leave it alone.
“Shut up. We got everything now?” Sam asks and gestures to the bags.
“Uh, Claire. Listen.” Voice barely a murmur, Dean cringes at how utterly weak he sounds. He wishes he had the stones just to come out and say it but knows there needs to be a certain delicate edge to his delivery that he just can’t seem to muster. There are only so many ways to tell a girl who’s had a life steeped in trauma and pain and loss that her only father figure is gone, and Dean can’t think of a single one. He cops out. “I can’t hear you. My connection’s crappy. Can I call you back later?”
Anything I may put in 1st POV is Dean's thoughts, I couldn't figure out how to do Italic on here so, bare with me.
“Brigitta.” Another girl with dark brown hair said.
Abaddon pursed her lips this time and leaned back into her seat before she stood in front of Dean. “Dean, it seems to be the will of God that you leave us.” She said as she walked around her desk to fully be by Dean.
Sister Sophia nodded and sang with Sister April, “He waltzes on his way to mass and whistles on the stairs.”
Krissy nodded, then looked down at her dessert for a moment, thinking. She wanted to see him again and especially whenever he was here to deliver something. “Father, may I be excused?” She asked.
“They get the fame; you get the money.” Castiel chuckled as he drove.
Rolfe sat beside her, on the opposite side of it. “Dear Krissy, I’d like to be able to tell you how I feel about you. Stop.” Krissy listened to Rolfe intently. “Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive. Sincerely, Rolfe.” He said with a small smile.
“If I could be of any help-”
“How do you find a word that means Dean?” Sister Kelly sang and looked at Abaddon with furrowed eyebrows.
Mick nodded and giggled a bit still, “Naturally.”
“Sister Jessica.” Abaddon said back, her eyes calculating.
Mick smiled lovingly at Castiel before he turned away from him, starting to walk. “I am amusing, I suppose.” He shrugged then looked at Cas again. “And I do have the finest couturier in all of Vienna and the most glittering circle of friends.” Castiel took Mick’s hand as they walked together. “And I do give some rather gay parties.” In this context, Mick meant great parties. Although, he did invite a lot of gay men.
The maid chuckled, “Two.”
“I will tell Captain Novak to expect you by tomorrow.” Abaddon told her. Dean nodded; he knew not to question this part. At least not the ‘expect you by tomorrow’ part.
“Mi Do.”
Castiel laughed softly, “In my natural habitat?”
“Shh.” Dean shushed her as he kept praying. “Help me to be understanding so that I may guide her.” The teenager sighed and looked down at her feet. “In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.” Now, Dean looked at Krissy to listen to her.
Dean pursed his lips before walking up a few stairs. “Winchester.” The Captain said quickly. “I want you to stay. I-uh-ask you to stay.” He said softly.
Dean huffed at that, an angry blush on his cheeks. He needed to make play clothes for them, one way or another. He sighed and calmed himself, running a hand through his short hair as he sat down next to a window. Dean closed the drapes as the thunder cracked more then he looked back at the drapes, admiring the green and white patterning. That would be good for clothes....
“Yes father?” Kristen asked her father, looking slightly guilty.
Abaddon shook her head, trying to calm him. “Only for a while, Dean.”
“And underneath his whimper he has curlers in his hair.” Sister April pointed out, angrily.
“Perhaps we should put a cowbell around her neck.” April said sternly, looking at the Reverend Mother and Sister Kelly.
“You’re not a woman?” He cocked his eyebrow.
“I’ve looked everywhere! In all the usual places.” Jessica said, frustrated almost, looking at Reverend Mother again.
Castiel lowered the cloth and cocked his head again at Dean. “Curtains?”
He ran about, twirling even. Dean wasn’t sure why, but he started to sing, he couldn’t stop it. Or that’s at least how he felt about it. “The hills are alive, with the sound of music.” Dean sang, a smile on his face as he walked about, his trousers were a bit dirty, but he barely cared. “With songs they have sung, for a thousand years. The hills fill my heart with the sound of music.” He stopped to admire the mountains once more, smiling as he pushed a hand through his brunette hair.
The Captain tilted his head, his lips thin at this point. “What gift?”
Dean was walking out of the abbey with a worn button up shirt, wool trousers, a wool jacket, boots, and a hat. He also had his guitar and any other extra clothes he had. Again, so much was running through his mind. He wasn’t sure if he was scared or nervous, maybe both though.
As the thunder cracked more, Dean went to the side of his bed to pray. At the abbey, they taught him to pray every time he went to bed and he did like it if he was honest.
“In the future you will remember that there are certain rooms in this house that are not to be disturbed.” Novak told him. But Dean wasn’t listening, not really anyways. All he heard was his voice, deep and gravelly, even having a bit of a Russian accent to it. Probably from yelling to his men during his time in the navy.
“But they’re children!” Dean argued, starting to get angry he wouldn’t listen.
“In a world that’s disappearing, I’m afraid.” Castiel’s voice was still hard and his words were short. Even his stance was rigid.
Dean laughed before he looked at her, nudging the girl a little. “So, we put in words. One word for every note. Like this,” He began to sing again, “When you know the notes to sing, you can sing most anything! Together!”
Sister Katherine joined in as well, pointing another thing out. One of the most important. “I’ve even heard him singing in the abbey.”
“Far!” Brigitta threw her apple as she sat up. It made Dean laugh.
“Together!” Dean said as he switched to dance with Kirssy now. “Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes, snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes.” He let go of Krissy and picked up Gretl. “Silver white winters that melt into springs.” Dean set Gretl on the floor and went over to the other kids. “These are a few of my favorite things! When the dog bi-” His eyes widened as he saw the Captain enter the room.
“Because I like you!” Gretl said happily. That did reassure him a little, that at least one of the children liked him already.
Now, the Captain, the Baron, and Gabe were at his house. Castiel and Mick were walking in the backyard on the path near the lake. Mick was wearing a nice red suit now; it was almost pink. Castiel thought one of the reasons he liked Mick was because he was a very feminine man and he barely minded what others thought of him.
Claire added, “Christmas!”
Thunder clapped again and Dean looked at the door as it opened, Gretl flying through it. “Oh, Gretl. Come here.” He could easily tell she was scared by the storm. He picked her up and brought her to the bed. “Where are the others?” Dean asked with a small smile as she sat down.
Dean shook his head then walked to be by the Captain, “Excuse me, sir, but when do they play?” He asked him. Children that are forced not to play aren’t really children anymore, are they?
Cas’ eyes widened, him and Mick going to the gate that opened to the lake. That’s when he realized that it was indeed his children in that boat. Castiel sighed and leaned against one of the gate’s pillars. The children then noticed their father standing there and stood up on the boat, “Father! Father!”
“I’m Brigitta.” The first blonde girl said. He was pretty sure her name was something else though.
“Sister Agatha?” Abaddon asked, nodding at what the other nun said.
“Why not, silly?” Krissy asked him, taking his hands as she looked into his eyes. For the first time ever, she felt like she might be in love. Even if that was a silly thing to think about, even at her age.
“Unpredictable as weather.”
Gabe stood up and looked over at Mick as Castiel went inside the house. “Well?”
The kids nodded and ran out to their own rooms. “Dean, you have managed to remember that I am leaving in the morning?” The Captain asked him. Oh, he used my first name, must mean something bad. Or I’m in trouble. Probably both. Dean nodded silently at that. “Is it also possible that you remember the first rule in this house is discipline?” As if I’m staying here for longer than I need to…. “Then, I trust that before I return, you will have acquired some?” The Captain said to him.
“Winchester. But I don’t mind if you call me Dean.” He said to the Captain, giving him a gentle smile.
He slowed down as he realized what song it was. “My heart wants to beat like the wings of the bird that rise from the lake to the trees.” It was beautiful. Castiel watched from the door frame of the living room. Mick and Gabriel were listening to the kids. “My heart wants to sigh like the chime that flies from a church on a breeze.” Cas’ face softened as he watched his children, love glittering in his eyes for them.
Krissy looked at Rolfe and said sincerely, “Don’t worry about father, he’s a big naval hero.” She then said with a smile, she was proud of her father. “He was even decorated by the emperor.”
Then something crossed Dean’s mind and he gasped, “Frau Schmidt! Do you think if I asked the Captain tomorrow about the material-”
“The sound makes me want to cry.” Marta frowned again, cuddling into Dean’s arms.
Gretl interjected, “A-B-C!”
Dean looked confused now, fiddling with his hands. “Um, Captain?” He asked Abaddon, a crease between his brow.
Dean counted the children. There were only six? The Captain kept blowing the whistle in a rhythm then the children started to march down the stairs. Once the whistle stopped, the children looked to be in order of height and maybe age. Then a girl came out of a hall, reading a book. She looked over the top of her book and sighed as her father came to her. She gave the book back and quickly got in the line.
“But how do you make him stay?” Abaddon asked out of frustration, a hand going to her temple.
Castiel’s jar dropped for a moment before he walked closer to Dean. “Are you telling me that my children have been roaming around Salzburg dressed up nothing but old curtains?” He asked, frustrated.
Hell, even Mick and Gabriel were. “I know I will hear what I’ve heard before. My heart will be blessed with the sound of music.” Dean walked up to hear them and he smiled softly. “And I’ll sing…. once more.” Castiel smiled at his children as they finished singing together, the children’s faces surprised.
Dean nodded and set his things down, biting his lip a little. This place was more than anything he’d even seen in the city. There was a great big crystal chandelier in the middle of the main room that lit up like a million suns.
“Mr. Winchester.... were you this much trouble at the abbey?” The Captain asked him, narrowing his eyes.
Castiel pursed his lips and nodded, “Yes, and I’m just an Austrian.” He begrudgingly smiled at Mick for the moment.
Dean’s eyes widened, becoming angry for a moment. Now, he was definitely not a damn dog. “No, sir! That will never happen! I am never going to answer to a whistle.” He said, completely disgusted that he would even try that. It would be so humiliating.
“He’s a darling.” Sister Kelly said.
“Well, how else will we get our father’s attention.” Krissy said to Dean as she helped Gretl with her food, shrugging at him.
“Kurt.” This boy had brown hair.
He put his hand in the water of the fountain and splashed the stone figure in the middle. “I’ll do better than my best. I have confidence they’ll put me to the test.” Dean started to walk to the bus again. “But I’ll make them see, I have confidence in me!” He stepped up into the bus and found a seat. I must do my best, not only for them, but for myself.
Mick looked at Castiel and frowned, “Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I’m in?” He asked him softly, rubbing his arm gently. Then they could hear the sound of children talking and laughing with each other. Castiel stood up straighter as he looked at the children whom the sound was coming from.
“On Castiel’s telephone, of course?” Mick laughed softly.
“La La.”
Sister Sophia shook her head before she looked the Reverend Mother, “But his penitence is real.” She smiled.
The three nuns walk to the square in the middle of the abbey and Sister April speaks up again. “Well, Reverend Mother, I hope this new infraction end whatever doubt you may have about Dean’s future here.” April never really liked Dean, who knows exactly why. Maybe it was because he was a troublemaker there but maybe it was because Dean could be the first male nun.
“He’s an angel!” Sister Kelly retorted.
Jack laughed, “No school!”
“I see.” Castiel nodded, pursing his lips out of discontent. “And where, may I ask, did these, um…” He held up Claire’s hat and looked at it, distaste in his eyes.
Then another girl, Brigitta, stepped up. “I’m Brigitta, she’s thirteen years old and I think you’re smart. I’m ten and I think your clothes are the ugliest I’ve ever seen.” Dean chuckled and shook his head, he wasn’t so sure if she meant it as a joke but, nevertheless, it was funny to him. Cause he’d have to agree.
“I can’t understand how you’re all so nice but do such bad things to others.” Dean said, chuckling a little. Although maybe he could sympathize with them.
Dean clears his throat, mind boggling for something to say to ease the tension. “So, how’s life? Still scoring at every God-given opportunity, right?”
Looking exasperated and laid a little bare, Cas sighs. “I wasn’t going to stay here, taking up your space, eating your food, in your way, when I’m nothing but dead weight to you now. You didn’t need it—or me.” He visibly swallows, clearly trying not to choke up, and steps even further away from Dean.
He remembers the glint in Sam’s kind eyes as he and Eileen tied the knot, remembers the muted buzz in his brain as he chatted with Charlie and Kaia and he remembers spitting harsh words in his brother’s face that left an acidic taste in his mouth.
The earth’s firmly back on its axis and his mind’s a lot more at ease than it has been for as long as he can remember. Chuck’s off the board, the world’s in good hands with Jack and everybody’s back where they’re supposed to be. All but one.
“Dun dun duh-duh, dun dun duh-duh,” hums Charlie, grin growing impossibly wider as she steps towards Sam. Her arms spread invitingly and he wraps her up in a hug with an amused groan.
Cas smiles sadly, defeated. “Not anymore. Not since I lost my powers.”
“Something smells good.” He pushes himself upright and pads over to him, wrapping his arms around Cas’ middle from behind. Nosing at the dip between his shoulder and neck, Dean inhales. “
Turning and moving to stand between his legs, Cas nods. “Yes.” He reaches up and cups Dean’s face in his hands. “So suck it up and eat the stew. After everything, I’m not losing you to a cheeseburger.”
It’s not that Dean had been wringing his hands with nervous excitement and barely controlled glee at the thought of marrying Sam and Eileen—truth be told, he hates speaking in front of others in any capacity—it’s more that he never expected that Sam would even consider asking someone else.
Close to the end, they’d been under Chuck’s thumb. Dean had damned Billie and anyone else who’d convinced Jack that he was capable of going up against him and winning. It’d felt like the world was crumbling around them, and in the middle of the bedlam and the mayhem, Dean had looked at Cas.
“If he’s sick, you’re cleaning it,” Cas chastises.
that.”
Looking away, Dean only hears him sigh. It’s not a noise born of pity, but it doesn’t make him feel any less like shit. Taking to winding the wire of his headphones up for something to do with his hands and a place to look, Dean consciously doesn’t look at Sam.
when he knows Cas is a hair's-breadth away rather than in a different state.
They head right through Oklahoma and make it to Dallas by the first night. The streets are quieter than Dean expects, and they quickly find a motel with a greasy spoon attached and a dingy bar next door.
Dumbly, Dean just follows him inside and Cas reaches past him to slam the door shut, shrouding the room in darkness.
, but there’s only so much a guy can do when the person they’ve loved for years kisses them when they were expecting a punch.
Cas’ mouth opens and closes, obviously trying to find the words and failing. His eyes are sad. Dean looks over his face, maps his features and as he watches Cas scramble to find the words, Dean damns the fact that regardless of how mad he is, being this close to Cas and watching as he tries to think of something—anything—to say still makes his mouth go dry and his palms sweat.
The door groaning open shakes him from his reverie, and Dean’s eyes refocus on Cas. He’s holding the handle in what looks like a death grip, face forlorn. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think Cas didn’t want to leave. He starts forward, though, one foot over the threshold before glancing back down the stairs.
Sam’s broad hand clasps around his shoulder and straightens him up, “one too many?” he asks with no real weight behind it, grin barely concealed.
“You don’t have to explain, Dean.”
’ pass between them as she grasps his arm again, lighter this time, a fleeting touch that’s gone as quickly as it came.
For now, though, there are party decorations and food platters seemingly everywhere waiting to be used. Dean potters around a little, trying to sort things into their respective places before giving the room a once over and sighing, defeated.
If he were around just about anybody else, Dean would probably feel embarrassed by how easily entertained he is, and just how enthusiastically he laughs out, “ha. Ring.”
. He sees Sam open his mouth, presumably to quip back, when Charlie steps up to the map table, fanning out some of the decorations waiting to be put up.
Two months have passed since then, though. He’s finally managed to stop feeling pathetically envious about the fact that his brother’s getting his happy ending whilst Dean’s is working for minimum wage in a crummy Gas-N-Sip two states over. Dean tries not to allow himself to dwell on all things Cas too often. He’s probably successful less than half of the time.
Cas nods. “Very easily. I feel at home.” It’s the last thing Dean’s expecting to hear. Warmth blooms inside his chest. Eyes fixate on him as he casts his gaze down at the floor and tries to process some kind of response. He’s not sure where the surge of courage comes from, but Dean just runs with it.
Sam peers past Charlie at him, meeting Dean’s amused smirk with an eye roll, and Dean can practically hear the ‘
He presses his lips against a strong shoulder and lets them drag, wanting a taste even through the dewy haze of the early morning. A hand winds its way into the short strands at the back of Dean’s head, and he forces himself to rise at the touch. Cas’s hand slides around to cradle the side of his face, and Dean can’t help but turn and nuzzle into the touch like an affection starved animal. He tentatively kisses Cas’s palm and looks up, levelling him with a gaze.
Dean’s mind races a mile a minute as he lets the words wash over him. Cas actually feels this way about himself—actually thinks they only kept him around because he was
“Not you,” Cas briefly lifts up the bottle of beer where it’s still dangling in his hand, “this.”
“Think Charlie’s bringing some stuff tomorrow morning, but pretty much. Gonna run this stuff into the kitchen.” Sam just sees him off with a curt nod and looks back towards the table.
The cool stone of the bunker’s wall presses up against Dean’s back when he leans up against it, thankful for the unwavering support in keeping him standing as he listens in.
Between Charlie laying all the food out in the kitchen, Sam hanging banners and Dean blowing up so many balloons that he’d been on the cusp of passing out, they miraculously manage to get everything set up an hour before the ceremony is due to start. They’ve cleared space in the library and set up a couple dozen dingy chairs, and the bunker doesn’t look half bad.
Dean pushes the thoughts away and dares to look back up at Cas. His expression is pretty much unreadable—nothing groundbreaking there.
“Charlie,” Dean says, “I’m good. I’m great. Seriously.”
“I’d love to,” Cas starts, and Dean can already hear the
The alarm shuts off abruptly and the darkness gives way to a soft light that Dean realises is now only being stifled by his eyelids. The stench of death and burning bodies has been overtaken by the crisp spring air wafting in through the window. Dean chokes out a gasp, relieved, and welcomes the smell, takes a deep breath and opens his eyes.
“Hey, is Cas there? Can I talk to him?”
“Wanna do something tomorrow? Breakfast, maybe?”
There’s Cas’s thumb skating across his skin again, and although it makes him feel like a teenage girl with a crush, Dean hopes he never loses the feeling of his heart jumping into his throat at the gesture.
, and he isn’t about to start now. “Today’s about Sam and Eileen, okay? Not about—just, drop it. Please.”
“Sam will forgive you,” Cas finally says, voice soft. It’s almost enough.
It’s like his skin is set alight as Cas grips his arm as he’s passing through the party guests, now awkward bystanders, on the way through to his room. Glancing back, he sees blue eyes framed by furrowed eyebrows and a devastatingly forlorn expression aimed his way, and just like that, it’s all too damn much. Dean yanks his arm back to his side and carries on.
“Jackpot,” he comments idly but with a smile all the same, eyeing the dying out sign above the entrance. He turns to Sam. “Up for a drink?”
Cas says nothing, stoic as ever. Dean watches more intently through the haze, hanging off his every move, as he goes over to the fridge and takes out a bottle of water. Turning back towards Dean, Cas steps closer, presses it against Dean’s palm and takes the beer into his own hand. The water bottle’s cold against his skin as Cas holds it there, waiting for Dean to grip it. He does, and then the moment’s over.
“You settling back in here alright?”
Cas--he can already hear the regretful apology before it tumbles out of his mouth.
Since they pulled the wheel on the end of the world, Dean’s more surprised than anybody that he’s actually been getting his eight hours most nights. In turn, his six hours due to his impromptu late night date with booze and corny noughties television has propelled Dean into some sort of state of unrelenting crankiness. The last minute trip to the store and almost-fist-fight with someone over the last pack of white balloons has only served to make him feel even grouchier, and now Dean’s just about over it.
Mostly, he worries. About everything. He worries about things getting lost, extreme weather, people crying off and hardly anybody showing up.
“You really don’t have to apologise. This...transitioning period, the adjusting—it’s been hard on everybody.” Cas’ ability to rationalise everything is enviable.
She ushers Sam to sit down, an effort to quell his nerves. “Think we need blood sugar over here. Dean, could you go get a soda or something?” she asks, voice low and collected.
“Awful as it probably sounds, I’m just glad Eileen couldn’t hear him,” says Sam. “Bad enough everybody else could.”
Even mildly pissed off, Dean knows that Sam’s got a point. No reason to let him know that, though. “What?” he feigns shock, “I’ve got fuckloads of propriety, decorum coming out of my ass.”
Twisting his head back to him, obviously amused, Cas rolls his eyes. “Like I said, I can’t heal you anymore. That means no more cholesterol zapping.”
For the sake of getting this agonising conversation over with, Dean lets the overly clinical
“Sammy, would you stop? You’re gonna give yourself a stroke,” he comments, taking a swig of his beer.
“Please, don’t say the word.” Sam practically winces.
The mattress groans behind him and Dean squeezes his eyes shut. He hears Cas shift, body moving against the crisp sheets. Then, there’s an arm curling around him and a weighted chin resting on his shoulder.
“Sorry for being such a mess. I’m gonna, you know, work on it.” Dean grimaces around the words as they leave his mouth.
“Come on, man. Hair of the dog that bit you and all that,” Dean tries to reason with a smirk that Cas probably would’ve found charming once.
Glancing over to where his teacup sits on the countertop, Cas sighs quietly. “It’s probably going cold by now. Talking helped, though. Goodnight, Dean.”
They sit in a comfortable silence, Sam sipping and savouring his beer whilst Dean all but chugs his. It’s barely a few minutes before he’s ordering another just as his cell starts to buzz in his pocket. The sensation of it puts him back in the bunker’s kitchen, back to the cold stone wall seeing his phone screen light up with Cas’ name. Dean feels a quick wave of nausea and rips off the bandaid, pulling his phone from his jeans. Claire.
that Cas is still here.
to feel that way?” Cas asks incredulously, but still manages to sound soft.
“I’m—yeah. I’m awesome. You were saying something about less clothes.” Dean leans down in a feeble attempt to catch Cas’s lips and distract him.
Not allowing enough time to overthink himself into a sinkhole had been Dean’s plan of action; he’d rushed through the motions without letting his mind wander, fearful of changing it. The plan of action in question left room for a few errors, though.
Dean watches his brother bend over backwards to keep it casual and feels a little conscience-stricken. He mulls the question over in his head and quickly figures that saying
What is this, a Hallmark movie?” groans Dean. “Anyway. I can’t just pack up and go. I’ve got a life here too.”
“I have a life there. I have friends, a job, a
“Just curious—what am I doing tomorrow?” Dean tries not to sound too excited, because honestly, he isn't.
Images of Cas’ name lighting up his phone screen flood his mind and it doesn't take long for the guilt to set in. Texts and calls have gone ignored for months, and Dean is suddenly hit with the realisation that he's going to have to see Cas and act like there isn't a damn thing wrong. It seems like the sort of thing that any sensible person would’ve spent some time preparing for--Dean, however, is anything but sensible.
because he presumes Dean to be hungover to a vile extent.
sounds in Dean’s head, and he can’t help but internally acknowledge how much he prefers Cas’ more recent words.
Dean nods and tries to accept Cas’ words, “it made sense to distance myself at the time, I guess. I’m still sorry, though.”
“Guess I’ve saved you the trouble,” he says as he breaks over the threshold.
He stands, grabbing a robe from the hook on the back of their door before turning back to Dean to shoot a parting smile his way.
“Yeah, and you told him I wasn’t, right? No harm done,” he says, concise.
Banishing the macabre thought in lieu of better, more promising things, Dean leans up and in. He bears down and presses their lips together, shifting his body above the other man’s, slotting a leg between Cas’s as they carelessly fall open a little. A warm hand takes root on Dean’s bicep and he shudders more than he cares to admit, pulling away. “Sometimes wish your handprint was still there, you know.”
Beads of condensation cascade down his bare forearm, and Dean watches as they slope down over the skin. He pushes away an intrusive thought of tracing the path of the water with his tongue and clears his throat.
Still staring down at the picture that is Cas’s consoling hand locked together with his, Dean reminds himself to be grateful, and he is. He’s grateful that Cas is here with him, alive, to be saying everything he needs to hear.
Shaking his head, Cas breaks himself from his reverie and says, “nothing. I just didn’t realise we were doing that.”
“You’ve heard you can’t kid a kidder, right?”
“Okay, obviously we wanted to tell you first, but I’m gonna go call people now. Hope Cas isn’t working.”
It’s been months since Cas’ grace burned out, since wearing the same clothes all the time became impractical, but seeing him in anything other than the tan coat and suit that Dean’s used to still kind of throws him for a loop.
His heartbeat thrums so loudly in his ears that he can almost tune out Cas’ voice sounding from behind him. The incessant pounding almost smothers the, “Dean, wait.” Almost.
Dumbly, he reaches over and the still-warm sheets shift beneath his hand. He rolls onto his back, sits up and tries not to look directly at the sliver of light flooding in through the doorway, open just a crack.
It’s not an hour after the happy couple have said their
There’s no plan or itinerary, just a week’s worth of clothes stuffed into an old duffel and a brief idea of a route. It’d been Sam’s idea—a little time living life as they always had, but in their own way.
He sighs, runs a tired hand down his face and jams his door key into the lock. The front door opens with an appropriate groan and Dean steps through, closing it behind him before toeing off his shoes in the entryway and dropping his work duffel at his feet.
hard to convince himself that he’s offended on his brother’s behalf--it’s a dick move for Cas to leave so soon after his wedding, after all. They haven’t even really celebrated. Dean also tries to not blame himself completely.
Dean’s nursing his third beer and watching idly as Sam rants to Charlie. Cas is late—only by fifteen minutes, but still—and it’s shaping up to be the straw that breaks Sam’s back. Dean only indulges himself momentarily by selfishly thinking that maybe Cas won’t even come; maybe he’s decided that it’s just too far for a wedding that isn’t even a wedding, before starting to feel bad for his brother.
Dean beams and snickers, chest tightening at the comment and the attempt at humour, and turns his head to kiss at Cas’ soft palm. “That because you love me?” he teases.
And that’s all it takes.
He laughs again, watery. “There’s so much shit that I need you to know, man, but I can’t say it like this. I’m not—I’m not gonna say it for the first time to fucking nobody in a shithole in the middle of fucking Texas. You deserve better than that. Better than me. Hell, you’d be alive right now if it weren’t for me. Ain’t that something.”
They get started immediately, figuring that there’s no time to waste with just the three of them left to dress the whole damn bunker by themselves. Grabbing a bulk-sized pack of deflated balloons, Dean peers around the table hoping to find a pump, lest his lungs give out before he actually gets to
There’s a question in Cas’ stare that Dean’s scared to answer—something akin to
“Do what?” Cas asks with an air of innocence.
Relief’s the furthest thing from what he’s feeling now, though. Cas’s tender touch makes regrettable reproach rear up inside him. Dean’s stronger than this. He’s fought monsters and demons and cosmic entities, his eyes aren’t supposed to sting when he’s dared to talk about his feelings with the one person who knows him better than he knows himself.
He frowns. “What?”
Irked, Dean rolls his eyes and heads down the stairs, carrying what feels like two tonnes of party supplies in what he suspects are
. Couldn’t just drop it all for me. I get it.”
“Awesome.” A look of relief shows on Dean’s face, but it’s fleeting.
is how you were around for so long, and just decided one day to pick up and go. No looking back.” Dean leans back against the island, gesturing loosely towards Cas, “I gotta say, though, you’re getting pretty damn great at that.”
Chest throbbing a little, Dean tries not to stare as he watches Cas and Jody talk. He’s nursing a beer and laughing at her words and Dean’s subconscious unhelpfully reminds him of when
Sam’s eyebrows furrow and he looks a little puzzled, either at Dean’s words or the fact that he’s switched so fast. “I don’t see it that way. Keep your damn voice down.”
So, yes, I’ll be leaving in the morning. I’d prefer not to leave with you angry with me, but that’s up to you.”
“I literally tightened this up last week. Why’s it crying again?” Dean shifts his foot back and the step creaks again under his weight.
“Okay, so we’ve got about six hours before
Without another word, Cas leaves the room and Dean is alone, the statement hanging in the air.
Dean glances over at the map table and sees a packed bag, registering that Cas is ready to leave any second. He’s ready to head back up to his perfectly rounded, compact life and Dean will be alone. So, he sees an opportunity to save face and jumps on it.
He’s one of the lucky ones—Dean knows this as surely as he knows his own damn name. The fight against Chuck caused more bloodshed than Dean was able to keep track of and more pain than he knew how to safely deal with. Families and lives were ripped apart and if he lets himself think, lets himself really dwell on it, a painful weight always seems to form in his stomach to accompany the realisation that when it really mattered, he was useless.
It’s the last thing Dean’s expecting to hear, so far off from anything defensive or desperate, and his head wrenches up to look at Cas. “What?”
“You know, he asked me if he’d done something to upset you. He thought you were mad at him.” Sam’s tone is wary as though he knows he’s stepping into eggshell territory. He’d mentioned this briefly after returning from visiting Cas, and Dean had felt just as gut-punched by it then as he does now.
not to dwell on it. However, as usual, his mind’s working overtime. The knowledge that Sam had passed over him pretty much instantly in favour of somebody who would make the whole thing flow better, look better,
Sam just gives him a look.
Dean pushes closer, chest throbbing at Cas’ words, but wanting to comfort him. “I get that shitty things have happened here, but it’s still home. You feel at home here. You said so yourself.”
“Hello,” croaks Cas, smiling small as he gathers the duvet up tighter around him, settling further down into its warmth.
Sam clearly figures that Dean’s drawn a blank, and coughs stiffly, “uh, I think he’s coming up later on. Haven’t actually heard from him yet, though. I’ll go call him.” He backs away from them, pulling his phone out of his pocket before disappearing down the hallway.
“Dean, if there’s anybody you can talk to about this stuff, it’s me.” One of Charlie’s small hands reaches up and bridges the gap between them, wrapping around his forearm. Dean lurches out of her grip almost instantly. Not knowing when to drop something has always been one of Charlie’s few qualities that he’s less than fond of. “You don’t have to—”
“Not here.
Dean turns, ready to exit stage left and get the hell away from this conversation into the smothering quiet of his room.
Going from seeing Cas as some dying, barely-there, broken thing curled up at his feet to this comfortable, laid back, untroubled
There’s too many things for Dean to feel guilty about to pick just one—whether it’s misplacing his anger, his brother’s overly cautious tone or the fact that his emotional constipation has given Cas a complex—so he opts for not dealing with any of it.
“Yeah. Like I said, lucky.”
“I am, though,” says Dean. “Grateful. I’m grateful for all the damn times you’ve pulled me out of shit, Sam too. Grateful that you’ve actually stuck by and helped when I couldn’t stow my crap.”
“What? That was our meet-cute, man.”
“You’re leaving in the morning.” It’s a statement more than it’s a question.
“Well, yes,” Cas nods, “I couldn’t find cover for tomorrow, so—”
Dean just watches for a second, Sam so deep in a world of his own that he’s not even aware of his brother’s presence. Shaking his head fondly, Dean just smiles and clears his throat. Sam looks up at the noise.
“Cas.” That’s just about all he can manage, mind racing a mile a minute. There’s so much to say and simultaneously nothing that could ever be enough. Cas smiles wider than Dean thinks he could even
“Why wouldn’t we be?” Dean asks, scoffing playfully, “s’what normal people do, right?”
Dean picks one up and shoots Sam a smile, “to being in charge of our own damn lives.”
. I’m sorry.” And so much goes unsaid.
else. Just you.”
is what they needed—
Dean advances on him before he can stop himself, decreasing the distance between them. “What about here?” he asks delicately, “you don’t think you’re needed here?”
Thud. Thud. Thud.
“Sam,” Dean warns.
Deciding that playing it off like it’s nothing is probably for the best, Dean just takes a considerable swig of his beer and chuckles. “Tell me what you really think, Sammy. Jeez.”
Even so, it’s been almost a decade since he did it for eight hours a day five days a week, and Dean is
Dean nods, still digging into his food, “s’our anniversary, dumbass. Taking you out. Steak dinners and dessert all ‘round.” It’s met with silence and Dean glances up to see Cas staring over at him blankly. “What?”
It’s odd; he knows Cas can’t hear him, knows nobody’s listening that matters, but it still feels wrong to leave it at that. It feels wrong and selfish and unjust and Cas is worth more than that.
Head falling back, Dean can’t catch himself before he’s saying, “you see what’s going on here?” to nobody at all with a humourless, stifled laugh. “You got me lying to
He drops his grin, reaches up to grab Cas’ hand where it rests against his chest and tugs him closer. “Hey,” he mumbles with his knees pressing into the outsides of Cas’ legs. Cas levels him with a look and Dean leans in, speaking against his lips, “love you.”
A hand pushing at his shoulder halts his movement. “Dean,” Cas presses, swiping his hand down the plain of his broad back, stopping about half way down, “you’re sweating.”
“But you came to it.”
Ghosts of whispers from a few hours before surround him in the morning haze. Dean’s reminded of hushed confessions mumbled in the dark, Cas’ mouth against the shell of his ear as Dean had skimmed a hand up the outside of his thigh.
harder than Dean remembers.
“Don’t remind me.” He presses a kiss to Cas’ skin, meandering up his neck to his cheek. “Hi,” Dean mutters, lips grazing against rough stubble. Again, Cas softly veers towards the feeling before turning his head and brushing his nose against Dean’s. Dean quickly catches him in a delicate, barely there kiss and smiles.
and Dean chuckles heartily.
There’s another murmur from the same direction as before, and Dean doesn’t get a chance to wonder who exactly it’s coming from when a guy he doesn’t recognise all but blares, “honestly, Sam, when you told us your brother was a drunk, I expected him to be the life of the party. Can’t say you live up to the hype, man—just stumblin’ in the corner there.”
Dean watches as his expression shifts from concerned to regretful, and won’t let it fly. “Hey,” he grips Cas’ hands in his, ignores the sting and urges him to look up. “You would if you could. That’s all I need,” promises Dean, earnest.
Their lips press together again. Cas’ hands settle at Dean’s shoulders, clutching at his top, and for the first time in months, it’s like the world’s properly resting on its axis. Dean’s pulled in impossibly close by Cas’ grip, and it’s all he can do not to moan pathetically when he feels Cas nip at his bottom lip softly.
This is the part where Cas retracts his words and sputters over an excuse for what he’d said, where he (rightfully) drags Dean through the mud along with Sam to appease him, where he says what he really thinks because as far as he knows, Dean is sound asleep rooms away from them.
, because Cas
“So, one of your best friends—no,
Sam sees his expression and tuts with an eye roll of his own. “It wasn’t like, an eavesdropping thing. I was waiting to talk to you and just...overstayed my welcome, I guess. I stopped listening when it started getting heavy.”
“It means you can be insufferably stubborn—too stubborn to see things how they are. I didn’t leave you, Dean. I left
The rest of the night flies by in a repetitive blur. Dean practically nests in his room, desperate to leave Sam alone and not step on his toes. Every couple of hours he slopes through to the kitchen, eats and goes back to his room. There are a few bathroom breaks interspersed where he makes as little noise as possible.
It’s the chance of a lifetime for him, and Dean
He still remembers the way hearing about it had felt. Well, kind of, since it didn’t really
Dean tenses up before he can help himself.
It can only be presumed that Cas hasn’t said much either. Dean thinks he’d know if Sam had anything to say—it’s likely he would’ve been cornered and coerced into spilling his guts by now. Sam’s attempts at using healthy coping mechanisms such as talking it out really chapped his ass sometimes. Luckily, he’s got off scot-free in the Cas department, though.
Sam’s quiet for a second, brows furrowed together curiously before they go up. “Wait—you—really?”
What he intends to say is something to the tune of
Another beat goes by and no one says a word.
you.”
“Hey, you okay?” His brow quirks and maps Dean’s features with a look, attention focusing on quivering lips searching for words.
He’s getting nowhere fast trying to nip this discussion in the bud. Dean opts for biting the bullet.
Dean’s still looking up when Cas peers over the railing and meets his eye. Cas’ movements stall for a second, flustered. He opens his mouth to speak, but any intended words are lost beneath Sam’s exclaim. “Jesus, Cas! Thought you’d bailed. Way to keep a guy on his toes.”
Cas shakes his head. “Someone else? Dean—there’s no one else. For twelve years, there has been
Voices sound from somewhere not too far, and Dean thinks he recognises one as Sam’s. There’s a whole shattered mess of crap for him to start piecing back together, and no sense in holding off.
“You know me—girls, girls, girls.” Charlie lets out a quiet chuckle.
It’s safe to say that the wind’s almost knocked out of Dean when Charlie all but tackles him, arms wound tightly around his neck. “Hey, kid,” he mumbles into her shoulder with a smile he can’t curb. She pulls back with a smile to match his, giving his short hair a quick ruffle before turning to Sam.
In the next breath, Dean’s vividly reliving a particularly mortifying night from about a month back. A booze-soaked memory flashes across his mind of his own grating voice whining down the phone at three a.m., slumped against the wall of a run down, seedy bar. A beautiful woman had tried to take him home, which usually would’ve been what marked a successful night. It wasn’t the same when his mind was fixated on one person, and wanting them and them alone, though.
Cas nods, small. “This wasn’t an easy decision. Especially not after last night.”
Sam’s voice carries up to him. “Hey.” He sounds distracted.
All at once, Dean’s done for. Large hands splay across the sides of his neck, skin warm, and Cas’ lips slip over his in a way that’s nothing like he’s imagined it to be, but everything he could want all the same.
He watches as his brother’s eyes widen and his mouth drops open a little, as if he’s trying to find the words. “Uh, actually, I’ve kind of already asked Cas.”
Barely a minute ago, he felt lighter and more laid back than he had in
Sam’s face drops and for what feels like the first time in his life, Dean can’t quite tell what’s going on in his head. There isn’t much time to wonder though, because the second Dean’s words start to play back for him in his head, he hears how cloaked in selfishness they are and feels like shit.
She blinks. “I’m sorry, is Sam Jack’s mother?”
She takes the phone from him, and looks at it closer. “Oh, he’s handsome. And you two aren't, you know…?”
Cas’ door opens. “I can hear you overthinking,” he says. He pulls the door wider and steps to the side. “Are you going to come in or do you plan on sleeping in the hallway?” Cas squints at him. Cas is wearing another one of Dean’s shirts, and boxers. Lord help him.
“Humor me,” Dean shrugs.
“Yep.”
Somebody thought he was married to Cas, and they’ve shared a bed the last couple of nights,
“I’m at work, buddy.”
When she was leaving she noticed the book he was reading was Dante’s Inferno. The book Dean was set on getting for their anniversary. She wasn’t sure why he chose that one out of her recommendations, but Dean kept saying, “Trust me, it’ll be funny.”
In one fluid motion, Dean stands, grabs Will’s arm with his right, takes the phone back with his left, and kicks Will’s legs out from under him.
Sam caught on. “Uh, yeah I have to go call Eileen, about… something totally off topic. Uh.” He noticed they weren’t even listening. “Yeah, okay bye.” They both made their escape. Claire did not have to look back. The suspicious quiet was evidence enough. She was just glad she didn’t have to read the next part in a book.
Dean threw on his jacket after locking up his chest. “I’m cooking dinner. The kid’s staying at my brother’s tonight. I think Sammy’s more excited than any of us.”
Dean’s brain short circuits. What? Oh fuck.
Cas always sighed, dejectedly, as he stood to go fetch Jack. If Cas couldn’t get him back to sleep he’d plop the child on Dean’s lap and leave with a small wave and a “have fun.” Later, Cas would find Dean on his stomach, talking to Jack as if he understood every word. Jack stood holding Dean’s hair for support, as Dean made two plastic dinosaurs kiss while he explained their dramatic and complicated love story. Jack laughed and bounced up and down until he’d eventually pass out on the floor next to Dean, and Dean wasn’t too far behind him. Cas let him nap for just a short time, before he ushered him to bed before he’d wake up with a sore back.
“And you’re a good dad.” Cas places his hand on Dean’s elbow. “He looks up to you.”
She laughs. “Well, Cas knows but Dean doesn’t,” she says. “Now let’s go eat so much ice cream, we send the old men into an early grave.”
Dean has to unbuckle Jack while Jack tries to help, so too many hands are in the way and it ends up taking slightly longer than usual much to Jack’s chagrin. But he eventually gets it, and hikes the smaller half-human onto his hip, grabs his bag and locks the car up.
Cas nodded. “Thank you, Sam.” He turned to Dean. “What do you think?”
Dean’s mouth just hangs open.
Yep, Dean’s a fucking window apparently.
“If it’s in his file, then yes.”
“Well, my work was light today, and Jack wanted to see the cars.” Ever since the phone conversation, all weekend Jack had been asking to visit his work. “Don’t worry, Johnston approved it. He’s only going to be here for about an hour before he gets picked up.”
Dean’s overthinking this.
His choice? Cas had told him his grace was failing and he didn’t know the cause. Dean and Sam stayed up late tirelessly researching and researching angel lore, coming up with nothing. Cas eventually told them to give it up. Dean protested that there was still more research, or that they could try heaven. Cas could ask Hannah possibly, she liked Cas. But Cas cut him off, said to let it go, that he accepted it and—Oh.
Dean, that was just a coincidence.
“Adopted,” Dean blurts. And now it sounds like they went and adopted a kid together, platonically. Which is essentially what they did. “Cas’ brother’s,” he adds. “He’s in, uh, jail.”
He makes an indignant noise and says, “Shit, haven’t I suffered enough?” He clutches his icepack a little tighter.
Castiel doesn’t look up from the papers. “Yes, I am aware.”
Cas would throw his ass back into hell if he woke Jack up. Or worse.
Cas smiles, going along with Dean. “I think he’d love that.”
He always wanted that life. And he really did.
Dean smiles. “I’m fucki—
And god, does he want him.
Dean stays lying on his back staring at the ugly popcorn ceiling that came with the house when they purchased it. There are little sparkles scattered throughout the ceiling, Jack calls them his stars.
“No way. I talked to him not too long ago.” Which, being as Dean steadily avoids Liam, could be months ago.  “He said he wasn’t married. He did mention a kid I think.”
“Your husband is a great employee, we’re happy to have him,” his boss says casually, and not like he just rocked Dean’s world.
Johnston claps a hand to Dean’s shoulder. “Sweet family you’ve got there, son,” he says, a little awkwardly. He tends to show he cares with actions rather than words, like when Dean has a rough day he gives him the afternoon off instead of asking him to talk about what’s going on. Dean appreciates that about him, he has enough people trying to therapize him. Johnston offers him one last smile before leaving to go to his office.
Cas meets him, where he stands up from crouching. “You’re very good with him.” A statement. Not a realization, but a reminder, for Dean, perhaps.
tell Sam I bought you this hippie shit.” Dean added the items to the cart and grabbed Cas’ wrist, which is attached to the hand that was inches away from grabbing the damn phone out of his pocket. Cas smiled, clearly trying to act innocent, and went to drop his hand. Dean held on, and moved his hand into Cas’ and laced their fingers together.
Dean received a call in the middle of the day. Almost every hand quieted and every head peered over to listen. Grasping at every tidbit of information they could get on this guy.
Except now he can’t stop thinking about Cas.
Surprise! Bet you didn't expect a second chapter of this! I sure didn't.
. “You’re coming in late today.” She said instead.
Dean spewed his beer everywhere.
Looking at the dark haired man in front of her, she would think he was a well-put together man. The way he holds himself, the way he dresses in a button down and tie, black slacks and a tan coat. Although his tie is crooked, flipped around, and his hair is untamed.
“The nightmares,” Dean explains. God, he sounds like a baby.
Apparently, Human Cas can’t sense Deans presence anymore, which they all found out the hard way. Seeing Castiel Former Angel of the Lord squeezing fucking Colgate directly on his tongue caused Dean to blurt “what the fuck are you—“
“I thought I’d be hunting ‘til I died,” he continues. “And I thought that’d be a long time ago, but here I am.”
Johnston stands a few inches shorter than Cas.
“Excuse me?” Emma’s mouth stays open. Haunted? Are they on drugs? No they’re probably just spiritual freaks for something.
Cas just motions again for him to come closer. Dean does.
“Lay down on your back,” Cas says. Dean’s arms almost fail him.
“No!” Sam and Dean shouted at the same time. Claire was definitely going to slip him the entire series,
Jack’s gaze follows her finger, suddenly remembering. “Oh, my sister did that!” he says, proudly. “She’s back home for a little.”
“I didn’t want you to feel obligated for anything, it was my choice in the—”
Dean looks down and finds himself asking, “why?”
“Does it matter?” he snaps. Sam gives him a bitch face. “Fine, about two months ago or so. They only started getting worse more recently.”
“Jack, don’t eat that,” Cas’ voice breaks through the tension. Is there tension? Is Dean just imagining it, and to Cas this is totally normal. Just friends.
Maggie slammed her hands on the table causing it to shake. Hannah kept her drink steady.  “No way. It’s Jack and he’s four. What would you know, Dean doesn’t even like you.”
“I thought you more than anybody understood it was time for us to retire. You said yourself we deserved it,” Dean says, a little defensively.
She hums. “And, uh, how does he fit in the picture then?”
Cas’ face is rough under his palms, his unshaven face scratches against Deans. Cas wraps his arms around his back. Dean moves his hand to Cas’ hair, flour from his hands transfer, dusting him in white. It feels like everything he’s ever done has led to this moment.
The picture is of Jack and Cas at the Farmer’s Market. Jack is wearing an adorably dorky yellow and orange striped sweater, with jeans tucked into little pink rain boots. The picture is fairly recent. Cas had Jack on his shoulders. They were both smiling at the camera.
Kathryn turns to him and whispers, “Riveting conversation.” Dean laughs.
Sam snorted. “You only say that cause you’re the one teaching him. Very humble.” He served himself the side salad that nobody else at the table had touched.
“I might’ve,” he relents. “But listen, he deserved it.”
“Hey Cas.”
“And say what? ‘Hey Dean, by the way, is your wife’s name Cas or is that your best friend? Are you even married? Also, is your son Jack or Sammy and is he four or in highschool?’”
“Not helping, Dean.” Cas continued to glare at the offending tubes of toothpaste. “I just don't get it.”
Dean doesn’t join Cas in bed later that night, either. He almost considers pulling an all nighter, but in his old age, he can hardly keep his eyes open. Naturally, he wakes up after a few hours.
“Sure, kid. One day I’ll show you around.”
“Well, I don’t have any books from this year, so you’ll have to bear with me, thanks.”
Dean faked a cough, awkwardly into his fist. “Uh, sure, I guess.”
When Dean went to sleep, Jack went to hell.
And below that he wrote,
“And maybe if you didn’t brush your teeth like a
“Sorry Han.” Though he definitely doesn’t look sorry. “I promise I’ll help you hide the body in the morning. Just don’t call me tonight, I’ll be too busy.” He winked.
Johnston kneels down to shake his hand. “Well, aren’t you a little angel?” He asks with a rough voice from years of smoking.
Hannah learned some more about their family from Cas, but gained even more questions. “Cas” was short for “Castiel” which was unusual. She asked if he was named after an angel, he laughed and said not quite, but that it was an angel name. She didn't know what that meant. He didn’t answer when she asked where he was from. When she asked how they met, he said he saved Dean’s life and in return, Dean saved his. He didn’t elaborate. He told her about his garden and his homemade honey. Apparently he had a booth at the farmer’s market, and he and Dean went there every weekend. Jack had a blast talking to all the other venders. Cas smirked when he said Jack charmed all the other venders into giving him samples. He got that from Dean, according to him. Jack, who they had adopted four years ago, was a big theatre kid, and learned puppy dog eyes from Sammy.  She also learned that Sammy was actually Dean’s little brother. And that he was planning a wedding for later that year. She eventually got pulled away when Maggie called her over. But she promised they would all have dinner together, and she’d bring her girlfriend. Cas nodded and they said their goodbyes and he turned back to watching the other two interact.
“He is gentle, he is wild.”
“How do you solve a problem like Dean? How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? How do you find a word that means Dean?” All the nuns sang and prayed. “A flibbertigibbet? A wil o the whisp?”
Claire asked Dean, tilting her head, “What kinds of things?”
“He’s a lamb.” Kelly argued back.
Dean went to close the windows, sighing. That thunder was so loud. He was in his sleep clothes, it wasn’t anything that special. A big white button up with matching sleep trousers.
“But it doesn’t mean anything!” Brigitta said as she sat next to Dean. No one only sang in just sounds.
“What’s gonna happen is going to happen. Just make sure it doesn’t happen to you.” Gabe shrugged. His brother seemed so sensitive at times.
Kurt went by them to talk, smiling happily. “I haven’t had so much fun since the day we put glue on Fraulein Josephine's toothbrush.” Yeah, no, definitely not a prank. More like needing to go to the hospital immediately.
Krissy came out of the bathroom with the sleeping robe on and interjected, “Telegrams!”
“Well, let’s just say I have a feeling I may be here on approval.” Mick smiled and bumped his hips with Gabe. He hoped Castiel would eventually marry him, soon though.
“Re.”
Krissy stood up now, watching Rolfe. “Totally unprepared am I to face a world of men.” She nodded at him before she went to stand next to him, whispering, “Timid and shy and scared am I of things beyond my ken.” Krissy ran a finger up Rolfe’s shoulder, teasing him making him lean away.
Dean chuckled and nodded, “How about we change his mind? I’m sure we’d be able to.” He said with a smile. “Now, what songs do you know?” He asked them with a hopeful expression.
Castiel laughed softly, his hand going to Mick’s back. “Trees, lakes, mountains--when you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all.” He shrugged.
Gabe sat up on the stones that acted as a railing for the porch. “But I’m a child. I like toys.” He smirked. “So, tell me everything. Oh, c’mon, tell Gabe every teensy-weensy, intimate, disgusting detail.”
Krissy let go of his hands and frowned, “Isn’t this why you’re here? Waiting for me?” Rolfe, or boys in general, were so confusing at times.
“Uh, why.... difficult, Reverend Mother?” Dean asked, nervously fixing a hair that was coming out of his cap.
Dean frowned; he’d hardly call that a trick. More like a heart attack waiting to happen. “Krissy.” He said as he closed that window. “Were you walking all by yourself?” Krissy hesitated before she nodded then shook her head when Dean looked at her sternly.
“Ladybugs!”
“Pillow fights!” Kurt giggled before he threw another pillow at Jack.
Dean shrugged, “Yes, but they were scared. And I can’t deny cute children some comfort. Especially more than you could ever do.” He said straight to his face, making some of the kids laugh a little.
* * *
“People tend to marry their best friend, dickwad.”
She pushed the highlighted phrase over to him. “And no he didn’t outright compare you two. But he did finish the phrase with, ‘you’re not gonna die a virgin,’ so.” She gestured with her hands. “I’m surprised you didn't get together that night, honestly.”
toothpaste. It has a cartoon fruit on it.” He crossed his arms and let out an adorable huff. And very ironically said, “I’m not a child.”
Jack frowns. “I give them my car.” He twists the mini purple car in his hands.
And best friends sure as hell don’t imagine
Sam starts again after Dean doesn’t respond. “You know, you kind of take after Bobby.”
“He’s Jack’s other dad.”
“Good. Keep it that way.” Liam threw his tools haphazardly into his toolbox. Dean cringed. “Don’t tie yourself down man. Just today my wife was bitching about how I missed dinner with her friends because of work.” He scoffed at the memory. “You know, the work that pays for her dinner.”
Dean’s ears were turning an awful shade of red. He pulled another beer out of nowhere.  Claire looked under his chair for a cooler or perhaps more bottles. Nothing. He pulled a beer out of his ass apparently. “Right.”
“Dean, why are you here?”
“Come on, I’m not that much of a hardass boss, am I?” Realistically, she probably could be, but only when her employees acted remarkably stupid. “Bring him. I want to meet him.”
Dean blinks.
He sets the gun on the table with a quiet
Damn it.
Dean turns back. “Hey, Cas. I’m fine, go back to sleep.”
“Yeah, he’s obsessed with getting me to eat healthy. Don’t know how we’re related. Ever since he read that stupid health text book--” Was Sammy his kid? “--he’s convinced I’m gonna die of heart disease and has been on my ass ever since.” Dean finally tore himself away from the car, and made his way over to his own vehicle. “He and Cas are ganging up on me. Doesn’t help, Cas is obsessed with gardening. My kitchen is now full of rabbit food.” Dean still sounded fond, despite the obvious indignation in his words. Liam didn’t like the sound of Cas. Didn’t sound like the kinda guy Dean would hang out with. Dean’s a Man’s Man. The kinda guy Liam would go get a drink with and shoot the shit.
Sam sits back down. “I’m happy for you guys.”
“You’ve lost hand privileges now.”
Sam continues, “I think moving in with Cas was the first time you really did something you truly wanted. The first time you allowed yourself some happiness.” Sam drains the rest of his coffee and places it in the sink. He turns to Dean and says, “Just don’t stop yourself from finding that happiness, from going after what you
“It’s okay, Claire,” he says sweetly.
“No, sorry to disappoint, but your eye-candy has other plans.” She offered her friend a smirk, and Maggie visibly deflated.
+ + +
“No?”
Claire flipped him the finger, mouth full.
Of course, he put those there himself, after throwing out all the alcohol. It had been a good thing at the time, but now he’s mostly bitter at himself. Bitter there’s no whiskey and bitter he even opened the thing looking for it.
“No, Dean. Why are you here? In this house, with Cas, raising Jack. Why are you here and not hunting anymore?” Sam says, holding his gaze. His own coffee, forgotten and cooling. A few birds begin to chirp as the morning starts, the sky a tad lighter than when Sam first joined him.
Liam pulled out his phone. “Okay fine, why don’t we just ask him.” He yelped when Maggie kicked his shin.
He tells her, “that’s Cas.”
“What the fuck, Cas?” Dean hisses.
Cas doesn’t answer. Dean’s used to seeing Cas in casual clothes. At first seeing him without his coat was like seeing him practically naked, like he needed to turn his gaze away out of respect. But just because it’s normal to see him in a t-shirt does not mean Dean is at all equipped to see him in just his
Will looks over at him, he adjusts the trucker hat he’s wearing. “No shit,” he says. “Didn’t peg you as one of them.”
“—But like they are.”
“How’d you get Cas’ phone huh?” Dean asks, smiling.
This is especially true, when her favorite (well, not favorite because she doesn’t pick favorites) student bounces in with a little yellow dandelion. Jack smiles widely and sets the little weed on her dark brown desk.
Dean smirked. “Yeah, Sammy. You joining us? We’ve got one left.” He gestured vaguely to the table.
Jack places the money in her hands, and the woman wraps up the strawberry jam with colorful tissue paper and places it in a brown paper bag with her business name handwritten in black ink.
Kathryn makes eye contact with him the moment he walks in the door. She smiles, then frowns, then turns her head to the side and just looks confused. He meets her half way when she sets her shit down and starts toward them.
The other line is quiet for a minute. “Right, I’ll let you go, say goodbye to Dean, Jack.” There is some more shuffling.
Carefully, Dean pours himself a glass of water, omitting any ice in order to stay as quiet as possible. Waking Cas is almost as bad as waking Jack, he really doesn’t want to deal with the consequences of either situation.
Discovering the Carver Edlund series had been a complete and totally embarrassing accident.
It’s almost as if the tides know Cas is meant to be an ethereal being. Instead, he's a human who needs sleep now. One who spreads his limbs out like a damn starfish.
“Cas?” Liam looked sharply at her. “No that’s the name of his best friend.”
Cas steps forward, invading Dean’s space. Cas’ arms hang loosely at his side.
Dean shakes his head.
Dean stares. “What?” he says again.
Dean frowns back. “But that one’s your favorite.”
Cas smiled.
Dean glares at Cas when he laughs at him. “Okay, little bee, let’s not kill him.” He picks Jack up off his torso and carries him out of the room, presumably, to get him dressed.
The next morning, Dean wakes in Cas’ bed without incident. He supposes. Cas isn’t there, and Dean is suspiciously close to Cas’ side of the bed.
He checks on Cas. Sleeping. Safe. Here.
Sam chokes and his eyes go wide. “Wh—What?” he whisper-yells.
“Aw, look at you.” She shoved him gently and laughed when a blush snuck its way up his neck. “Well enjoy your alone time.” She wagged her eyebrows. “You deserve it.”
Jack continues to bounce around from car to car, parading question after question. Most nonsensical, but Dean entertains each one.
“You mean when you were the size of a Chrysler building with like 100 eyes and a lionhead.” It was a touchy subject. Cas didn’t necessarily regret giving up his grace, but he still clearly mourned the loss. Everytime Dean or Sam would get hurt, his hands would twitch, wanting to heal them. On a rougher night, Cas confided he felt useless. Dean did his best to make him feel better, telling him he wasn’t useless, that they kept him around cause he’s family, with or without his angel mojo.
“Since when do you care about this stuff anyway.”
“We live together.” He’s not sure why he decided to share more. “We’re raising him together, but we’re just friends.” He’s trying so hard to explain to make it seem normal but he feels himself digging a grave and being found out. Found out? Found out that Sam was right and he is in love with his best friend? God, why can’t he just be normal about this.
Jack shrugs adorably. He is clearly distressed about having to lose his favorite car, but he feels it’s the right thing to do. For the pandas. “It’s okay, I have Baby.”
“I just thought I heard something, I’m going back to bed.” Dean knows Cas knows he’s lying. But Cas doesn’t call him out on it.
Dean places the bag of diner food on the breakroom table. He bought them both cheeseburgers. If he had to pay for it he got to choose it, too. Not that Kathryn seems to mind, as she smiles widely pulling her foam container out of the plastic bag.
Emma’s had parent-teacher meetings all week. It is one of the things about the job she dislikes, interacting with the parents. Kids, she could do. Parents were brutal. Despite Emma having a system to the meetings, parents could still get defensive about their child. By now, she thinks she’s got them down to a science. Parent comes in—introductions—compliment the kid in some way—discuss their work—throw in any concerns—show their cute art work—bam done. Essentially. That was the gist. Sandwich any bad between the good, and make sure you start off the meeting complimenting the kid. Parents loved that.
“Was that so hard?” Cas says,
“Me and Cas are sleeping together,” Dean blurts out.
Dean’s already out of his seat, walking around staring at the posters on the wall.
Dean’s smile fell. Hannah wasn’t sure if she said something wrong or if Dean just realized his whole family was coming to work and got weird about it. Or if he thought Hannah would be annoyed at him to assume his wife could also come.
. It seemed perfect at the time, finally in grasp. He had gotten that chance with Lisa, and look how that turned out. Except, really, it wasn’t right. It wasn’t
“I don’t understand why this is important.” Cas spoke as he flipped quickly through one of the many Supernatural books splayed out, with the map of the table peeking through. “I was there for many of these experiences. What is the purpose of reading through them?”
Monday rolled around. Hannah tried not to be too disappointed when Dean walked in 9am, alone. She knew he said they were coming around 3pm, but the questions had been nagging her all weekend.
“Do you think they support bees? Or that it smells like honey?” Cas’ expression darkened. “Or perhaps do you think it's made of bees?”
She gestures to her desk. She slides into her office chair, the two men infront of her situate themselves in the seats she brought in for the conference. Castiel sits, almost stiffly, not bothering to part with his overcoat, studying everything in her room with scrutiny. The taller one—Dean—relaxes back into his seat. Quite the odd pair.
Underneath,
“Sounds complicated.” She continues to swipe through photos. “Who’s the bio dad then?” She’s looking at another photo of the three of them. “He looks like both of you equally. If I didn’t have a basic understanding of biology, I’d assume he was both of yours.”
Dean perks up and reaches across her desk, knocking over a cup of pencils. “Oh, awesome,” he says as he grabs the fidget spinner she keeps on her desk for her students. He leans back with the toy in hand and starts spinning it.
Cas looked thoughtfully to the side. “Perhaps, it’s not totally accurate.” He looked back at Dean. “We are Jack and Ennis.”
“What?” she blurts.
“Wow look at you, man!” Dean exclaims. He kneels down to his level. “When’d you get so stylish?”
He does go to the kitchen and put on a pot of coffee. He also quietly pulls out some sugar and flour and starts “stress” baking again.
Maybe he needs to read that link Sam sent him.
“Man, I promise, it’ll be okay.”
“Come on, man. It’s not that bad. Really.” Dean browsed the selection before crouching to look at the lower shelving. “Look,” he pointed to a brightly colored, pink and green tube. “They have watermelon flavored.” He held the tube closer to Cas. “You like watermelon, don’t you?”
Dean had the knife in his hand next, with Jack in front of him. Dean woke up just before he carved into his soul.
Motherfucker.
Cas grabbed Dean’s arm and pulled him close. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s midsection and buried his face in his chest. “Thank you, Dean.” He spoke quietly.
“Very interesting comparison, Cas,” Sam chimed in. He smiled behind his beer.
“How many times have you taken that thing apart and put it back together?” Sam finally says, looking at the gun parts strewn across the counter.
Cas stays silent.
Cas finally looks at him.
Dean huffs. “We don’t know how I’ll be.”
Sam held up the mask and quirked an eyebrow.
He’s almost started to let himself believe in this little life he created, where he comes home from work everyday to his… to Jack and Cas.
Dean lays the dough over the filling, pinching the ends together. “Uh, yeah.” He sniffs. “There’s a chance I’ll have to start looking for another job.”
says, glaring at her. Glaring?
Cas studies him, eyes squinted and head turned just so. “It’s alright, Dean.” Cas’ gaze flitters from Dean to Jack and back to Dean. A soft smile creeps onto his face. “It was my choice, I do not regret it.”
“That’s a
Maybe it’s just easier to accept people’s assumptions than try to explain why two men, who aren’t married or in a relationship or gay—is Cas gay?—are raising a child, who refers to them both as dad.
She pulled herself back from her thoughts, and let the family be. She did have an actual job to do that didn’t involve prying into her coworkers life, after all. But not before texting Mandy everything of course.
“Well, I’m glad to have him. I won’t keep you, I can tell he’s excited. You boys go have your lunch and then Dean can give you the tour.” She smiled as Dean nodded and led them into the break room. Jack was practically vibrating the whole way there, asking Dean 100 questions about the cars, and the building, and his job. Each one Dean answered patiently.
It was gross.
They were definitely married now, though. “No, no. Definitely their wedding anniversary. He specified it was their first one,” Hannah said. She knew because she told him paper was the traditional first anniversary gift. A lightbulb had clearly turned on behind his eyes, the way they lit up. Cas loved poetry, he told her. But they had a pretty extensive library already. She promised to get some recommendations from her girlfriend.
Dean doesn’t look up at him when he enters.
He’s playing house with Cas, essentially. Right? But, yet, this is
She smiles back, because how could you not? “Hi, Jack. What’cha got there?”
Dean’s hands still, and he twists to face. He sighs. “You don’t seriously think this is in any way your fault, do you?”
“Cas,” Dean interrupts.
Dean looks away. He starts taking his gun apart again.
“Guys,” Claire interrupted, her eyes flitted over to Cas.
Jack waves, “hello!”
Dean chuckles in the background from where he’s flipping through children’s books.
“You’ve lost phone privileges.” He pocketed the phone before moving down the aisle.”And why do you type like that? It's damn sinful.
Cas wrote it down again.
Dean groans and rolls himself out of bed, his joints popping on the way to his bedroom to get dressed for work.
If they made instruction manuals on how to deal with this type of situation, Dean would buy like ten. Honestly, if he asked Sam about it, he’d probably send him like 5 links on dealing with your sexuality. And really this isn’t what he needs right now. He needs to deny it, because it isn’t true. Right. Dean and Cas are not married, so what is the point in letting them believe they are?
She stands and passes out their work for the day.
Cas pokes at the brown bag curiously. “What’s this?” he asks.
He slides to the next photo.
He hears Cas’ voice in the background. “Jack, where’s my pho— Who are you calling?” There’s a shuffle and Cas’ voice becomes clearer, “Hello?”
Cas tilted his head. “Yes.”
Bobby taught Dean how to fix cars. Bobby played catch with Dean for the first time since he was four. He made sure they were fed, even if money was tight. He always put Sam and Dean to bed with a promise to protect them.
+ + +
Cas continues to study him. “Did you have another nightmare?” Cas asks, like Dean is a little kid waiting at the foot of his bed for permission to join him.
Sam: i lived with him my whole life
Dean’s eyes widen, too. “Wait, no—not like,” he sputters. “Not what I meant.”
Fast forward to Claire staying up all night researching the series. She found them all online and yeah. While she did get some perspective about Sam and Dean, she was a little scarred when she stumbled on some sex scenes. She had to research what chapters to skip over because she was
Hannah set her beer down and took a seat next to Maggie. Maggie looked up and exchanged a smile for the other beer in her hand.
Most evenings, after dinner, Cas takes advantage of Dean being home and the cooler weather and tends to his plants. Dean has Jack run around and get all his energy out before bed. He loves to pick up his plastic toy gardening tools and help his dad. Jack walks to each plant, to “water” it with his pink watering can, touches its leaves gingerly, and then pats the dirt gently. Each one he does that to. Then when he finishes that chore, he finds sticks and leaves and buries them in his own little dirt pile. He uses his little plastic shovel to pack in the dirt and his can to “water” it. He beams proudly and Cas tells him he did a good job and that his plants are going to grow nice and strong.
Dean continued to sputter, while Cas seemed unaffected, continued to stare Dean down meaningfully. When Sam got himself under control, he said, “That’s quite the comparison, Cas.”
The next couple hours went on without much entertainment. The bell chimed close to three, and every head turned toward the sound. The double doors blocked the site of whoever entered the lobby. But eventually they crept open revealing a dark haired man, and a teen. They looked a little lost.
Dean grabbed his, Sammy’s and Jack’s choice of toothpaste. Jack’s was a white tube, also had the word “hello” written across but in red. It was apple flavoured, and specified it was for toddlers and was safe if swallowed. They started buying that brand for him shortly after the first time Dean taught him to brush his teeth. Dean told him to “spit it out” but Jack turned and smiled “I already swallowed it.” So Jack’s no longer allowed to use adult toothpaste, because he continues to think it’s candy. Man, whatever gets the kid to brush his damn teeth.
Jack nods and hands it over. Dean pulls out his wallet, when Jack tugs his arm. “I  wanna.” He makes grabby hands at the bills in his hand, so Dean hands him the correct amount.
The four of them all stared at each other in their absence.
Cas sighed. “I suppose.”
“Fine, how about lunch is on me?” Dean says.
Cas: Kiss My Ass
Cas makes them spaghetti and sauce that night, it's one of the few things he can make that is somewhat edible. They have dinner out on the back porch looking over Cas’ garden.
Dean coughs awkwardly and turns away, he lets autopilot take over as he makes his cup. “Don’t worry about it, it comes with the job.” He reaches for Cas’ favorite mug also and holds it up in a silent question. Cas nods. “What’re you doing sneaking up on people in the middle of the night? Your old instincts kick in again?” Dean raises an eyebrow and pours Cas’ coffee, adding the necessary honey and milk.
Emma chokes. This is an elementary school, for god’s sake.
“God knows why,” Dean says, still looking at Jack.
when it’s put together again, as Sam settles in the seat next to his with a fresh cup of coffee.
Dean takes the spoon from Jack before he chokes on it and throws it in the bin by the stall. Jack reaches over the table and grabs one of the red glass jars decorated with strawberry ribbons. “Careful.” Dean goes to reach for it, but Jack holds it closer to his chest.

was the textbook. How to Know Your Crush is Flirting with You 101 with Professor Claire.
Ignoring the tension between the others, James suggested Cas and Dean were dating but not married. James and his wife didn't get married until Sophie was 3, it's not unheard of. Which technically, he’s not wrong. If their son, Jack or Sammy, or whatever his name is, is four or in highschool, clearly they had a kid together before getting married.
She gestures to the door and they walk out with no further incident.
He pulls himself off the island stool when the last drips of coffee sputter out. He opens the cabinet to the coffee mugs and—
Everything catches up with him.
Cas gives him a look.
“I assume, like usual, you would like to keep everything bottled up,” Cas’ sleep-rough voice brakes gently through the silently agreed upon silence.
“Gee, thanks.” He pops open the bottle and pours two tablets into his hand. He doesn’t mention that he hasn’t had a sip of alcohol in almost a year and a half, but he accepts that pain relief anyway, because lack of sleep does cause him headaches now in his old age. “Anything new come in today?” He tosses the medicine back.
They fell into a comfortable silence as they worked. James hopped over to assist Dean on the Camry he was working on.
“Loves them. Likes working on Baby with me too.”
Cas has his green yoga mat laid out, and across from him is Jack’s much smaller yellow one. Dean notices the grey still-new mat Cas had purchased him, despite his reluctance to join, rolled out where the coffee table used to be.
. “No, I mean fuck, what the fuck.”
Eventually, when the easier poses are over, and Jack gets a little bored, he starts doing somersaults around. Cas continues lifting his legs above his head and turning himself into a human pretzel. Dean has long since flopped back onto his mat.
Once again thank you for reading! I appreciate all your comments on the last chapter! I haven't responded cause I feel odd bumping up the comment count with my own? Is that normal? Should I just do it anyway? Regardless, thank you!!
and a puff of flour floats between his fingers. “Amazing how you can manage to somehow blame yourself for the midnight screenings of featured horrors my psyche likes to show at night.”
Though it doesn’t seem that hard to explain. Maybe Cas just doesn’t mind.
“Uh yeah, I can’t wait. I got to get to work.” He stood up straight and gestured vaguely toward the garage. “My boss is an asshole and I don’t want to hear shit from her later.” He smirked but it didn’t reach his eyes. He left for the garage, the door swinging back and forth in his absence.
Maggie tapped her pen impatiently on her desk. God this was the longest shift. Yes, she thought that everyday. But she was certain she was right about it this time.
“Dean, did you talk to your boss or did you storm out?”
She took the proffered phone from Josh. “Um.” Pulled up on the screen was a quick google search. “Suprnatural boook” was written in the top search bar, below it, it read “
“Dean,” Cas says, quietly.
Dean laughs and gently takes the jar from his grasp. “Of course we can get it for him, but we have to pay for it first.”
Dean turned away from Jack back to Cas. “So this,” he gestured to the space between them, “comparing thing, this is you… flirting?”
When Dean looked up Cas was smirking. That little shit.
“Ah!” Claire lights up. Swiftly, she yanks open the driver door, turning off the engine, and hops out. Claire opens the trunk with the key, and pulls out a gray and black bag. The contents of the bag are undisclosed, but she eventually pulls out a plastic green square. “I knew Dean was a freak,” she says shutting the trunk.
Dean’s breathing hard, he blames it on the strenuous activity.
Unlikely.
“In the meantime, I will be trying not to strangle Liam, since
Dean ignores him.
She’s beginning to see where Jack’s sister gets it from.
Reading about her angel-possessed-corpse dad (Cas hated when she called him that) and her weird pseudo-murder-dad (Dean also hated this) flirting was almost unbearable, but not as bad as witnessing it live. And after realizing that both parties were utterly oblivious, she decided to meddle, so she wouldn’t have to witness the pining anymore. Just for that reason. Not that she cared if they were happy and sappy and in love.
“Okay.” Dean mumbles back, before pulling away again. Cas makes a small noise of protest.
“Married. I’m not married.” He holds up his left hand. “Guess all your dreams are coming true, cause I’m single.” He winks, and smiles but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
“What? I don't know. Definitely not that last one.” Dean scanned the products. “It looks like they spread Bee Awareness or some shit. Is this what you want?” He held up a shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Separate bottles. Definitely smaller and more expensive. But for Cas? Worth it.
life. Maybe he wasn’t ready then. Or maybe Lisa wasn’t right for him.
Dean turns and puts the pie in the oven. The heat from the oven is making Dean sweat just as much as Cas’ scolding gaze.
“I don’t know, I guess having somebody in the room helps keep them at bay,” he mumbles. “But that’s it, two dudes sharing a bed,
Jack runs out of his room, his little black converse patting on the hardwood. He would never admit it out loud, but Dean had almost shed real man tears the first time he saw baby shoes in the store, they were just so damn small. Jack has paired his shirt with a mini blue flannel, his sleeves unrolled, reaching his wrists.
“I am aware now, but I did not make the connection.”
Instead he just says, “Dean.” And Cas pulls him in once again. “Not now.”
No, no way, Hannah thought. If he wasn’t married, what was all the poetry talk about last week? “Well I helped him pick out Cas’ anniversary gift, so I think it’s safe for me to say he’s married.” Hannah’s fingers slipped gently across the table, feeling each individual ridge in the wooden table. Dean’s hands similarly scratched at the table when they talked last week.
Any retort gets knocked out of him when Jack flops his entire little body on Dean’s stomach. “
Dean’s going to sneak Nair in his brother’s shampoo the next chance he gets.
“Suspensions damaged.”
“A dandelion,” he tells her excitedly. “Dad says I’m not allowed to pick flowers without permission, but that dandelions are okay to pick. It’s for you.” Her heart absolutely melts.
“It’s what your dads pay to keep this house,” he pokes Jack’s side, “so you can keep all your toys in here.” Jack giggles. Dean places him back on the ground and runs his fingers gently through his hair—careful not to mess up the work Cas put into it—and gestures to the kitchen where Dean has Jack’s breakfast set out on the table. “Go on and eat, kid.” Jack runs off toward the table.
“Yes.”
“Oh wow,” Dean compliments. “This one’s definitely going to Louvre.” He smiles and passes the paper back to Jack who resumes his creating. “What about you, Sammy? What’cha got over there?”
“You know me.”
He fails.
Cas thanks Johnston for allowing Jack to visit, exchanges the Impala keys for the SUV keys, and pulls him toward the door. Jack attempts to jump the entire way there.
Cas frowns and looks away momentarily. “Well, I think being as old as I am, I’m entitled to some aging.” He jokes, halfheartedly.
Like today, he has a new little patch, just above his bee (this boy really loves bees). It’s a rectangle flag, with seven stripes of red, orange, white and pink.
. “You seem to know a lot about it. Are you sure you’re not a fan?”
“Lost count,” Dean says, because it’s the truth. Shortly after he had finished the coffee, he found himself opening the old liquor cabinet, finding it full of Jack’s juice boxes instead.
Cas and Jack arrive home when he's pouring the filling into the crust. Jack is conked out, his head lulled on Cas’ shoulder, from having fallen asleep in the car. Cas raises an eyebrow at the baking mess in the kitchen before turning to go deposit Jack in his bed.
.” Dean handed him a wrench. “It’s totally inappropriate for his age, but Cas lets him watch it when I’m not there. They think I don’t know, but I know.”
They sit together in silence, sipping their respective beverages. The nightmares started back about two months prior. There was a time, shortly after he moved into the new house with Cas, Jack, and Sam (who has since moved in with Eileen 26 minutes away) that his nightmares completely stopped. He isn't sure why, if it was the new house, the fact that they retired from hunting and his family was safe, or if whatever entity out there decided to just give him a damn break. But they stopped, and they stayed gone for two years, until two months ago.
Maggie's hands froze from where she was idly twisting her beer. “Uh, no, he’s four years-old.”
“Demon—” Cas starts.
Claire patted his arm as to say,
She nods and he goes to his seat. Emma hadn’t met Jack’s parents yet. But the way he’s always polite, has good manners, and obviously has rules set that he follows, they must be amazing parents. If she ever decided to have kids, she hopes her kid is like Jack. Maybe she should ask his parents for advice.
Cas sighs. “What did your boss say?”
Much to Emma’s surprise,
Dean stills. “Stop it.” Cas blinks. “Stop doing,” Dean gestures vaguely, “that. We have too many goddamn shrinks in this family.”
“Why do humans… Why do we require so many items for daily self-care?” Cas asked as they loaded the bags groceries into the back seat of the Impala.
Castiel ignores his distracted husband and continues staring her down. She feels like her every move is being documented, and she really doesn’t want to deal with a complaint.
looks at him. “It wasn’t my business, but when we first moved here… I used my grace so you’d sleep soundly.”
“You’re just jealous that when I tried to teach you, you sucked.” He took a bite of his own food and spoke. “Cas is a much better student.”
“You and Dean, huh?” Liam chimed in. “You two sleeping together then?” He gave Maggie a knowing look, as if he figured it all out already. Hannah knew better than that. The way Dean talked about his wife… she’s surprised Liam would even suggest that.
, and I found gray hair.
Dean laughed. “I will, I promise. First we’re gonna eat.” Dean turned to the others. Hannah couldn’t see her own face right now, nor could she see her coworkers’ faces, but she was sure their jaws were dropped. She tried to save face and school her expression. “Uh, this is Hannah,” Dean said. He waved a hand at her. “And Maggie, and that’s James and that’s uh Liam.” He pointed to the other workers who weren’t nosy enough to walk over, just nosy enough to stop working and watch. “That’s Rodney back there. And Danny. And lastly that's Cheryl.”
Soft, slow and almost desperate.
“No, leave him alone, it’s his anniversary, dude. Ask him tomorrow morning.” The music changed to an old country song. The bar had started to fill up with more of the Thursday night regulars.
“Oh thank god, I was afraid he called emergency services.” Cas pauses for a second. “How are you, Dean?” he asks, softly, worried.
She was on a pretty simple salt’n’burn one state over, in Minnesota. A small house in the suburbs, painted an ugly green. Looking so young, Claire had a harder time posing at FBI, so she had to resort to snooping and talking to locals. Specifically, she had an in with the teens around her age, more willing to gossip.
“He’s very smart,” she tries again.
The woman groans. “Ugh, no. Baby is the name of the car, Dean doesn’t like me driving it, he’s weird. Listen they normally get him in an ugly-ass soccer mom car.” Emma is very shocked this woman is in any way related to this polite, gentle little boy. “The number’s probably in there. I was too busy trying to get the damn car seat in here, I didn’t think...” She shoves her thumb back, pointing to the back seat. “Can’t you like, check my ID or something?” she asks a little harshly.
“Neh-fil-lem,” Jack pronounces each syllable carefully.
Jack kicks his feet frantically, back and forth, as Dean parks the car, the ugly gold SUV Cas made him purchase for Jack’s safety. Cas has the Impala currently, the deal being whoever transports Jack, drives the family-safe vehicle. Dean feels like a soccer mom.
Once he’s on his back, Cas kneels next to him. His heart is beating wildly and he’s positive Cas can hear it, even without his angel mojo. Cas hooks an arm underneath Dean’s legs and pulls his knees closer. “Place your hands under your hips. Right, now lift up, and hold yourself up on your elbows.” Cas’ other hand goes underneath him, right at the waistband of his pants, and the other arm straightens his legs so they are vertical.
“Well, Jack will be thrilled either way.” Dean stood up and tossed the tube into their empty cart. “So you don’t like mint, it’s not a big deal. Lots a’ people don’t”
“Sorry Jack-Jack, give me a minute.” The blonde begins typing on her cell. “I meant for this to be a fun surprise.”
“Ah, I see.” Cas drags his foot through the grass.
Kathryn ambushes him when he’s underneath a car with no escape. She crouches down, sticks her face under the vehicle right by Dean. “I can’t believe your husband was here yesterday and you didn’t introduce me.”
He was constantly looking over his shoulder. And as much as she tried, Lisa didn’t understand him and his past. It wasn’t fair for him to dump his trauma on her so he held it in.
‘I didn’t realize you were a dad.”
“Cas!”
“This is Jack,” he says, instead.
“Well, I don’t know about God. But I know why.”
Dean finally reached them. Before any of them could even speak or process, Dean pulled the dark haired man in for a kiss, when he pulled away he ruffled the kids hair. “How was school, kid?” Clearly didn’t realize he had an audience. Clearly didn’t realize he had effectively broken his coworkers’ brains.
He hears Cas mumble something before he crosses over into unconsciousness.
“Either put one on or kindly fuck off, Sammy.” Jack moved away to sit on the other side of Cas, and ripped open his own mask, it's supposed to be a puppy. Fitting. “We’re bonding”
Cas glared.
They spend the rest of the morning letting Jack run around and tire himself out, and having Jack use his Cute-Powers to persuade customers into purchasing some of Cas’ honey and plants.
Dean lays his legs back down. He misses Cas’ touch the second he loses it.
If Claire didn’t know any better, she’d say Cas was staring into Dean’s soul. Actually, she didn’t know any better, because he just might be doing exactly that.
“Is that your, is that—?” she asks, pointing.
James wiped his hands and began packing up his own tools. Dean enjoyed talking about his kid. It was one thing he and James bonded over when Dean started working at the repair shop a year ago. And, unfortunately, that was the extent of their similarities. Both being Dads with teen kids. But it was a good way to keep friendly conversation going during the long work days. When you got him talking, he could go on forever. He was damn proud of Jack, that much he was sure of.
He finds that putting Jack on his shoulders lessens the trips to other stalls, saving his wallet a little bit of heartache. He only goes to the stall if Jack grips his hair a little too tight and attempts to pull him toward the item of his desire like that Ratatouille movie he likes.
Sam: ask him why he spends so long in the shower then
“I’m sorry,” she says as politely as possible. Her years of customer service before she became a teacher are kicking in. “Is there an issue I am unaware of?”
“Yes, they are gay.” Cas wrote down,
She perked up. It was Dean Campbell, dressed in a nice dark green button-down instead of his usual grey cover-alls. He smiled politely at her.
The woman huffs, pulling out her phone. "Alright, let me check."
He smiles as he picks at his jacket. It's a light-wash denim, covered in little sew-on patches of different things he likes. His jacket presents, a little cowboy hat, wings, a panda, a dinosaur, a small purple… dog? Among other things. He wears it almost everyday, and occasionally he gets a new little patch.
“Ok shut up. And stop typing everything I say to Sammy. I don’t even wanna know why the guy knows my showering habits.” Dean turned from the shelving to see Cas frantically typing on his small cell phone. “Are you still typing what i'm saying? Are you typing this right now?” He walked over to where Cas was still typing and clearly ignoring him, and snatched his phone.
“I can tell you don’t believe me,” Sam says. Of course he can tell, because apparently nobody wants to go back to pretending Dean doesn’t wear his fears plastered on a big neon sign.
They manage to make it to Cas with only three extra stops after the jam lady. One of those he makes it out without purchasing anything, the others find him with three peaches and a cherry pie.
Her brows furrow and she crosses her arms. “What?”
doing that again.
He holds his breath.
“He wanted to look like you today,” Cas says, following Jack loosely into the room.
Liam pulled himself out from under the car. “He doesn’t have it anymore?” Dean shook his head. He ran his hand down the length of the car.
Cas insists he joins them this time. And Dean can’t get away with the “maybe next time” excuse he’d been using since they started this morning exercise ritual.
Jack Kline—who sits with his elbow resting on the arm of the couch and feet crossed, just like Dean. Who brings a book that he can’t read to breakfast, because that’s when Dean reads. Jack, who has an obsession with cars, and Dean’s not sure he knows where it came from, but he's not an idiot. He can take a good fucking guess.
It takes a minute for his brain to catch up with his actions, but when it does, he realizes Cas is now kissing him back.
Dream Jack was older, his hair the same color but styled similarly to Cas’. His Jacket was one of Dean’s and the look in his eyes was also Dean’s. Dream Jack sold his soul to save somebody, he never found out who. But the look on Jack’s face when he told him, told him he sold his soul... He was scared. But he kept saying, “it’s the right thing, Dean.”
“Mmm!” Jack hums with the spoon still sticking out of his mouth. “Yum!”
Cas takes his proffered hand, and responds, “Cas. Nice to meet you.”
Cas: “Are You Still Typing What I’m Saying.”
She stands when a pair of men enter her classroom. Jack’s parents were scheduled next so this must be them.
Dean sniffs. His fingers tap idly on the surface next to his gun.
Sam and Eileen’s car is in the driveway when he arrives home. When he enters, Eileen and Cas are signing back and forth to each other on the couch. Eileen giggles when she turns and makes eye contact with Dean. Jack and Sam are coloring on the coffee table, opposite of them. Sam is doing the best he can with those chunky crayons. Jack drags the crayon back and forth on the paper in harsh lines, no rhyme or reason to his color choices or pigment placement.
Dean bristles.
“Nah, just that Civic I mentioned yesterday. Owners dropped it off an hour ago. Have at it.” She puts her cigarette out against the brick building. “And cheer up, it’s Friday. You have all weekend to sleep that hangover off.”
, goes unspoken. Something grips and tightens around Dean’s heart about the size of two little toddler hands.
+ + +
So waking up and entertaining a hyper two-year-old at two in the morning is not Dean’s idea of a good time.
, “you didn’t need to lose your grace for me to stay.”
“You’d be okay with that? He’s pretty high energy, he’d be getting into everything.” Okay, maybe he was a toddler. And maybe bringing him around the shop was a bad and dangerous idea.
“Dean.” Cas sounds breathless. His hair is sticking up wildly, flour on his face and in his hair. Cas’ own hands clutch desperately to Dean’s t-shirt.
“Dean,” Cas scolds. “What did you do?”
“I’m sorry, but due to safety reasons, I can’t let him go with you,” Emma says. “Are you on his pick-up list? Or perhaps we can call your parents.”
It was such a human phrase, which made it that much sadder. A bitter reminder of what Cas lost.
“Uh thanks. I think that was Cas’ motive when picking it out.” Fuck.
“Thank you, Jack. That’s very thoughtful.”
and couldn’t seem to get over the fact. “No way,” he whispered.
“Cas, stop talking about me in Enochian.”
Emma shuts the door behind them and leans against it.
Cas pointed, “Burt’s Bees.”
Dean was wiping his hands on a burnt red cloth. Every worker turned their attention back to the pair that just walked in. James and Liam pulled their way toward the group, Maggie appeared out of nowhere, slipping through between the doors.
He turns away but stays rooted outside Cas’ door. He doesn’t know if he should try to get more sleep, or give it up and make some coffee.
She made eye-contact with Sam again. This time he gave her the bitch face. Ah. So he caught on. He smiled and shook his head.
“I knocked my coworker on his ass, but he was being a dick and I think I had every right,” he explains and turns a finger at Cas.
Because apparently his entire workplace thinks he’s married to a man.
But now he has that life with Cas.
Cas: “Are You Typing This Right Now.”
“Dude,” Matt hits Will on the chest and gestures to Dean. “Dude’s gay, he can’t think either are hot.”
Pulling out his phone, his heart beats rapidly when he checks the caller ID before answering. “Cas?”
The other man, Dean, is dressed more casually in a green button-down shirt and dark wash jeans.
Dean tries to memorize the feel of Cas. Like he might lose him, despite only just now getting him.
Dean coughs.
“For daddy!”
“What?”
When he finishes adjusting the shirt, he grabs Jack under his armpits, standing up, and settles him on his hip. “There you go,” he says. “Now you look like a real mini Dean Winchester.” Jack beams. “You ready to go to your first day of work, buddy?”
Cas narrows his eyes. Dean expects him to say, “What does that have to do with anything?” or maybe “Who?”
And he even politely turned her down by mentioning his wife again. Her face felt so hot right then, she willed the ground to swallow her whole.
“Castiel,” Cas—
Okay, sure. Guess they’re doing this in the middle of the shop. Dean pulls himself out from under the vehicle, holding his hand to his forehead. Kathryn disappears and returns with an icepack. He takes it without looking at her.
“Well?” Kathryn signals for him to talk.
“What? Nothing!” he whisper-yells, defensively. He looks away from Cas back to his pie. He’s still pinching the crust together, even though it’s already thoroughly connected.
“Oh, yeah. Well… He’s, uh, a good kid.” He looked thoughtfully downward, remembering. “You know, when we got him four years ago, I was so scared. But he’s a good kid. A great kid.”
. He’s got an honest-to-god house, not bunker, with both their fake names signed to it. A yard Dean mows regularly, and a kitchen where Dean makes them meals, and they all sit together like a real family.
Dean almost rolls his eyes, again. Almost. “It’s not—”
Cas leans against the cabinet, watching Dean as he cleans the flour off the counter. “Is your possible unemployment your excuse for stress baking or is it what your coworker said?”
“Though I guess you could say he is the mom.” Dean snorts. “Only reason he’s not here is because somebody had to watch Jack.” He glances around the room, before tossing the folder haphazardly onto her desk.  “I think he got the better end of the deal.” He begins spinning the fidget spinner again.
Cas sighs. He slides his hand across the table to meet Dean’s. Dean accepts the comfort. It isn’t often that he does, but in the witching hours, in the dark kitchen, nothing but the moonlight and Jack’s Elmo wall nightlight illuminating them, he lets himself believe he deserves some comfort for once.
“Okay!” Dean chimes in, scooping Jack up, as if that would keep him from spilling. Maybe telling Jack about his… angel-side wasn’t the best idea. But Cas insists he knows where he comes from. Well, not the Lucifer part at least, they’d left that out for now.
“Sure, she’s hot. But she’s not ScarJo hot,” Will says.
Jack nods enthusiastically.
Luckily, strangers can’t always understand Jack’s toddler babble, though it’s a language Dean and Cas are fluent in, so they’re often saved from any awkward explanations.
Dean looked to Cas. And, fuck, he was looking at Dean with sad, hopeful, puppy eyes. Dean better make a move before she’d put a gun to his head.
Dean worked in a cheerful mood all day. Perhaps the idea of your son visiting work was exciting. Hannah still wasn’t sure why he seemed upset after the conversation on Friday. She even talked to him later, he assured her they were still coming to visit.
“He says he ‘can’t believe you’re the gay sibling’ and that ‘you have Charlie’s hacked card anyway and theres no excuse for you to be dense,’’” Cas continued to use his airquotes on every word.
This time Dean does smack his head against the undercarriage. “Fuck!” he swears as the red-hot pain surfaces on his forehead. “What the fuck!”
Dean looks behind him, half expecting a little half-human-angel to appear right behind him, fully awake due to the ruckus he’s causing at two in the morning.
“Sure, I’ll have Cas bring him by after school Monday. He’ll go nuts.”
Dean laughs, “of course you do, kid.” He leads him to the next car, and reassures him he does not have to give up his favorite toy, though the pandas appreciate the offer.
“First wedding anniversary was a hit, then?” She tested carefully.
“With cars?”
He took the tape back, holding it carefully in his hands. “I see.”
“I heard you get up, and you never went back to your room.” Dean stares down at his coffee, but he can feel Cas’ eyes on him. “I figured you were taking too long to be simply relieving yourself. And then I smelled coffee,” Cas says, as he gestures to the coffee pot. “So I came to see if you were okay.”
“Sam is inquiring why you take so long in the shower then if it’s supposed--”
“And sleeping with Cas is—?”
“Yes, I do actually,” Sam almost laughs. “Dean, you
Dean tries to catch his breath.
Dean does not shriek. Let that be said. He does, however,
Cas: “I Don’t Even Wanna Know Why The Guy Knows My Showering Habits.”
Dean releases the breath he’s holding, as he watches Cas’ chest rise and fall. Cas is still there, he’s safe.
James finally broke the silence. “So we were all wrong.”
“Hi, Jack!” she says. “How old are you?”
. And he has a wife and kid.”
Jack’s voice pushes through the receiver instead of Cas’, “Dad!”
Will continues, “Come on!”
Dean snorts, “what, are we getting philosophical now?”
Kathryn sizes him up the minute he steps out of the Impala. “You look like shit,” she points out, leaning against the building, her arms loosely crossed, holding a cigarette.
“Those are his worksheets he’s completed,” she says nervously.
Cas raises an eyebrow before carefully unwrapping the item. “Where’d you get money from, Jack?”
“The Carver Edlund books,” he said, pulling out his phone. “The brothers that go hunt monsters?” He wasn't looking at her, instead he typed on his phone. Not in a rude way, but clearly trying to pull something up for her. “My sister is obsessed with them. You sure you haven’t heard of it?”
Dean doesn’t wake him up. In fact he doesn’t even join him at all.
Kathryn laughs, swiping to another photo. “I’m beginning to see why you haven’t shared much.” She mumbles to herself.
Jack happily complies. “Bye! I love you!”
“Thought you were a Dean stan based on, well…” He waved his hand. “Your... everything.”
But she didn’t have to. Because Dean got the message. “Jack and Ennis, huh?”
when he’s older?”
“Like Riverdale!”
He makes his way back to bed eventually, only to wake up an hour later. Tears claim paths down his face. He wipes them away furiously.
Dean rolls his eyes. Of course he knows, and of course this guy thinks it’s his fault.
“Uh, Dean from the book. One of the brothers, the other is Sam? And there’s an angel, too. Castiel… or something.”
She looks hurt, “I thought we were friends, dude. And I just feel like I don't know you. I didn’t even know you were married. If somebody asked me like yesterday, if you were married, I would’ve said no, because for two years you never thought to mention it.”
Either Cas leaves, or dies, or Dean pushes him away. Every night. Dean loses Cas over and over.
Dean laughed loudly. “I tried to get Jack into westerns.” His coworker shook his head, fondly. “But he’s much more into Star Wars. Can’t blame him, just wish he liked westerns a little more.” Dean leaned back over his engine with a new tool in hand. “That’s kids for ya. They break your heart and insult your taste.”
Emma catches up to Jack, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry, miss. Do you have your car rider number?” she says, a little warning in her voice.
Dean swallows. “I’m—” Dean points back to his own room. “I’m gonna sleep in my own tonight.”
“God, thank you, Han.” They both took a sip. “Dean’s not coming?” The others at the table looked at her waiting for an answer. Liam was across from her and James was on the side of her not occupied by Maggie.
