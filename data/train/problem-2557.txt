And it is. It’s John. The same John that has helped him on innumerable cases. The one he has fought with and laughed with and done mundane, silly things like eaten and done grocery shopping with. It’s the very same John.
“Is this about the stupid tattoo?” John asks condescendingly.
“Hello?”
“A plane ticket. Tonight.”
John laughs, stealing another kiss. “Brilliant.”
It’s not that I haven’t had any relationships. I have. Well, just one. SH
“Good.”
It is too late now to say anything more than I love you, I love, I love you.
“Don’t finish that sentence,” John warns, rage almost blinding by this point, gut clenching and unclenching in time with his fists. “You
Three days after that, Sherlock receives a text.
And suddenly, he’s alone, facing a door he had once opened too many times to keep count, a door he can’t seem to be able to find the handle to anymore.
Sherlock waves at the ocean several times.
“I’m glad I’m here with you. While…”
John laughs nervously. “You’re not making this easy.”
Sherlock chuckles, using both legs to throw him off balance. John lands boneless on top of him, now completely trapped. Sherlock’s lips are on his neck, teeth grazing the soft skin.
John bursts out laughing, bumping their shoulders together. “Am I really that obvious?”
“It’s just until we’re fixed,” John continues, heading for the kitchen.
“I could stop.”
“I couldn’t stand to go home and going to 221B was even more inconceivable. You brought me here then, too.” His voice cracks, the vessel that he has become threatening to spill over, threatening to open up and let something else in. He can’t allow that to happen until he knows what exactly that something is.
I really want to come home. Especially, now.
“We don’t have to have our breakfast,” John says, threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “We can just do this for now. Alright?”
I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be that upfront, you don’t have to tell me now.
“We don’t have to talk about that.”
“Fuck,” John curses silently, shaking his head and willing himself to chase the image of Sherlock’s naked body spread on their bed. “Get a hold of yourself, Watson.”
“Sherlock,” John says, and he sounds like the soldier, and the friend, and the confidante, and it makes Sherlock feel slightly less erratic. “This is what we’re going to do right now, love. We’re not going to solve this or argue it out. We’re going to go to sleep. Together. On this damn phone. You’re going to listen to me breathing and I’m going to listen to you breathing and eventually sleep will come and we’ll sort this out tomorrow. Alright?”
Emotionally, he’s getting there. He knows it won’t be an overnight process, and so he isn’t expecting it to be.  Much like he learnt in his one and only rehab stint, he has to take it one day at a time, and learn to release the past in increments that are accessible to him. Repressing it all in one go - as he has found recently - doesn’t help anything. Deleting people and places and incidents always seem to come back to bite him in the arse.
Sherlock stares at him for long seconds, barely breathing and his hands pressed against John’s lower back. When he finally moves, sliding closer and breathing out loudly against his lips, John realises he never wants to stop telling this brilliant man just how much he loves him.
“The restaurant we went to after we solved The Inexplicable Matchbox case,” John says, pulling up to the pavement and looking quite pleased with himself. “You couldn’t stop going on and on about their dessert for weeks after. That was one of the best nights of my life.”
“Or that. Yes.”
“I think I’m your trigger,” Sherlock says, using the voice he so often uses with clients. “I think the first time was because I refused your offer to come back to Baker Street for coffee after the case we just solved. I think you resented me, I think you felt betrayed by my refusal. So naturally, that’s where you went after getting drunk, that’s why you accused me of all those things.”
be had, in fact. You’re not the only one who’s new to this. It’s big and important to me, too. We’re both still learning, I think.”
“Alright. But?” John’s breathing has instantly calmed a bit.
John laughs this time, a joyful sound that he had no idea he could make, “I can see that. But I was hoping you’d miss me a bit more, kiss me a bit more.”
Cancel the bloody posh restaurant! Let’s do something fun. Last time before I’m off the market.
I’ll check on you, later, alright?
Involving Mycroft in my occasional drug use won’t get you anywhere - when has it ever? Don’t you think I can work around that? Hasn’t past experience taught you that? Your threats really mean nothing at this point, and only serve to anger me further.
“No, but I might do it. To be with him. I at least want to be asked.”
“Well, I suppose if I’m being honest with you, and with myself, probably since the beginning, or very close to it.”
“Good. Yeah. I think that’s for the best. To just focus on what we have now; on what we are now.”
“I estimate it’s around four years old, yes.”
“No! That’s the last thing I want! For you to have to come back because of me. Because I’m this way!” Sherlock hates himself, hates that he has no control over this part of him. The part where sentiment looks an awful lot like peril.
“Already?” Sherlock is surprised.
“You don’t know?” John asks incredulously. He feels shock and irrational anger. How dare he not know when he knows everything else? How dare he know not only that there are 243 different types of tobacco ash, but also the names and features of them all, yet not know this?
It’s the noise of something breaking that forces him to rush in, alarmed.
“You, falling for someone.”
“And that’s funny?” Sherlock asks, his own lips curling into a smile.
Sherlock is lying on his side of the bed, fast asleep, both arms wrapped around John's pillow. He looks so peaceful, and yet John notices the worried lines around his eyes immediately. A knot forming in his chest, John carefully steps closer, letting his jumper fall on the floor quietly. He smiles, one hand brushing away some of Sherlock's curls from his forehead, and with his heart pounding in his ears, he leans down to leave a soft kiss there. "I'm home, love," he murmurs, not actually wanting to wake him up.
“I wrote you an email, before, but never sent that draft. I don’t have the courage to say everything that I should say and not hear your immediate reaction. Is that okay?”
John is a ghost of what once belonged to him, all those years ago, before he had to leave. The hardest part for Sherlock is knowing that they will never be able to capture what they had and lost - or lost before they ever had it, actually. He isn’t sure that it means that they shouldn’t try, though.
Sherlock bursts into bright giggles despite the tears in his eyes, taking John by surprise. He presses his lips together, refusing to let another word out.
“Hmm. Might be true,” Sherlock teases, sniffing and staring down at his nails.
“Sorry, I’m usually busy recovering from the orgarms
“And? Do I measure up?”

“Sherlock…”
“It is? Why is it?” Sherlock frowns. “Because of us? Because of
I want you just as much, love, and it’s been killing me too. But I meant it, you can’t do this to yourself. We’ll get there, together. We’ll make sure it’s good, for the both of us.
“Whatever do you mean?” Sherlock plays innocent.
Morning finds John alone in bed.
“You know who we should tell first?” Sherlock asks, a small, private smile on his lips.
Sherlock looks up, studying him for a long moment. John doesn’t hide a thing, letting show just how eager he is to properly kiss him, eyes falling to Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock looks at him for another long moment before nodding towards the kitchen. They go without another word, John sitting down while trying not to think of all the breakfasts, lunches and dinners they have shared around this very same table.
The tears are rolling down his cheeks freely now, and he can hear John’s sympathetic sigh on the other end.
. Sheer, carnal desire.
And that’s okay - more than okay, in fact. My greatest joy in life is getting to see you experience happiness and fulfilment, even if that excludes me. I’ve done it before, and I will continue to do it.
John gives in to his attacks, his robe and shirt not lasting a second more. Sherlock struggles a bit more with getting him under the covers, but once there, John finds himself being pulled back on top of him.
She waits, patient as ever, looking right into his eyes. He looks at the rug instead, steadily avoiding being exposed.
John moved between lovers like the Mayfly Man at first, trying them on and earning his Three Continents moniker back but, ultimately, he couldn’t stomach it anymore. Waking up to them was like waking up to face himself, a prospect he couldn’t bear. Between the drinking and the fucking, he tried to drown himself in anything that didn’t involve being still with his innermost feelings. It worked for a little while but, eventually, it all caught up with him, an avalanche of guilt, pain and grief that he truly believed would never end, until it did.
The next morning, John had surveyed the damage, hands on his hips, questions on his tongue. He knew better than to ask them, instead sweeping the mess and storing the offending instrument under the kitchen sink, a place he knew Sherlock never had need to go, in their old life terming all the harmless household cleaning supplies kept there
Maybe he is going crazy, after all.
“John-”
“Harry. Enough”
“Bah.”
John falls in step beside him, Honeybee babbling softly in her carrier. She is restless; she hasn't left 221B much either. Sherlock understands. She meets his eyes and he smiles encouragingly. She mumbles and pouts and fights to turn around, so she can nestle in her father's chest. John places an arm around her tenderly and kisses the top of her head. "Hush, little love. It's alright. It's alright".
“I won’t go over this again.” They’re looming over each other now.
“If the fever does not go down at all in the next twelve hours, and if it rises above thirty-eight point six, yes. But I’ll be there, alright? Don’t worry. She’s going to be just fine. She was vaccinated for this year’s flu, so it most probably is just a rather nasty cold. Okay?”
“Fancy a fire?” He gets up, tilting his head, glancing at Sherlock’s impossibly pale bare toes.
“How is our little girl?”
“What did she think of the little one?”
He could get used to this again.
John shakes his head, his hands grab a rail of a staircase and he’s up the stairs, forehead against the soft smelling wood and he’s so relieved. Relieved he can smell this above all else. Relieved the unforgiving car engines haven’t washed this scent away. Relieved he is not so numbed by fear and alcohol yet...
“I’ve got to ask, are you sure this is going to work?” He brushes a hand over his head at John’s shell-shocked expression.
“Nothing.”
Sherlock’s head snaps, surprised at being addressed. John turns, securing his baby girl on her baby seat and she pats his face in a playful manner, trying to get a hold of his nose. He lets her, getting down on his knees to accommodate the angle, and she squeezes his nostrils closed.
Sherlock hears the door opening and closing, steps trudging on the stairs. He shoots up from bed, in a flurry of bedclothes flown aside, and rushes to the corridor. It’s a short flight; he pauses just outside his bedroom. When the blood thumping in his ears subsides, what he is met with is silence; there are no more footsteps.
Thank god for that, or he’d be crumbling by now.
‘I’m asking too much.’
“May I…” He’s the one taking the step closer. The one asking for permission. Any or none. It will do. He needs only ask. To know his footing. To regain it. Prevent his knees from growing weak. “May I kiss you?”
John reaches a hand, smiling softly. Gentle -even if calloused- fingers brush over Rosie’s bellybutton. She stirs and snuggles her elephant to her face.
They sipped on their tea slowly, quietly. Sherlock did not ask how John was. John did not speak. Sherlock waited for John to decide he was ready to get up first. John did but lingered.
He nodded again.
“Understood.”
“Should I repeat that I am not your housekeeper?”
He gets up and goes to spend his time better with the little flower that is currently bored of her markers, face pressed on the table, gurgling aimlessly. He’s accepting the little penguin’s fate for now at least, taking John’s advice, letting go.
Sherlock waited for him as he made some toast to help with the upheaval in both their stomachs.
“Woo?”
“I know...” John whispers, hesitant despite it.
Sherlock sits up, always careful with measured movements, nodding briskly. The worry isn’t gone, his eyebrows are knitted together still, but he seems satisfied for the moment. John goes and tidies all the shopping in the kitchen and fridge. He brings back a spoon. Sherlock is looking at the sleeping little flower conflicted. He can’t bear to wake her now that she’s peaceful again. John sits beside him.
And they leave the cosy space as Rosie waves excitedly at her new Doctor and Chloe sends her kisses at John’s utter shock and amusement and Sherlock’s highly raised eyebrows.
And they do. John cleans her up -she had some signs of diarrhoea but not much- and Sherlock prepares her food -a second portion of Mrs Hudson’s healing soup, lots of broth. She accepts the syrup quite easily after some healthy, tasty bites of chicken -welcoming the slight sweetness, John supposes- and then once again closes her eyes without a sound, but overall, she appears to be pleased with her care.
Wanted to be someone Sherlock
Angelo’s, the pool, New Year’s Eve, the hotel room, before the fall, at the Landmark, in the fire, by the bomb, at the wedding, at the drug-den, at Appledore, in the airplane, at Rosie’s birth, when he was high, when he was not, when he was lonely, happy, frightened, ecstatic, cold… His life told in kisses he’s never given nor received, a patchwork of moments missed and broken.
Fingers on lips. Back against the closed door. Chest fluttering like a bird’s.
Both. He hadn’t done it. He hadn’t jumped. John hadn’t. He’ll never know how falling is like. That’s why he knows when it’s fake. A dream. A nightmare. But he hasn’t known before. He never knows when he’s dreaming. Not until now.
“I’m here.”
“Where did you get all the spices anyway?”
“Do they?” Sherlock considers. “We’ll see.”
“Snoozing since I called you.” Sherlock swallows, looking back at the bundle in his arms with a frown. “She had a sneezing fit that exhausted her not twenty minutes ago. A bit of coughing, but not much. John, are you-”
Sherlock pours the tea and settles on his armchair, wrapping his dressing gown tight about him. Dawn has only just broken, and it does not seem like it will be a fair day this time.
There are many other similar lists with ways to find help, we just offered one as a start for anyone that may find it helpful.
Sherlock blinks. Honeybee’s appointment, with the children’s psychotherapist and speech therapist. John had arranged it some days ago and was both intrigued by the fellow doctor’s abundant qualifications and worried about the procedure in equal measure.
“Sherlock, you will let me finish this, ‘cause I’m coming for you next, alright?!”
It seemed a lifetime ago. Long, lean phalanges cupping over small palms, preventing her from typing nonsense on his laptop. John was surprised he could pinpoint such a detail, considering he’d been in constant hangover back then. Or was it after he… in any case, he had been in his first withdrawal then, whole body itching, he could barely remember what he had said to Ella that week -probably some bullshit of being able to do this alone- but that single detail… Sherlock and his little girl together… Was carved in his mind.
She puffs her chest out at that, like an offended peacock. Takes a glance of appeasement to make her ruffle her feathers down again. “But maybe it’s neither of you. Perhaps it’s just… The combination. How things turned out, in the end”
“It’s nice, isn’t it?”
John almost pouts to himself. He needs to amend that -he
“Oh. It’s… Wait-“ John sits up to reach better, frowning in concentration, the way he does when he types, when he makes breakfast, when he reads the paper. Sherlock can see him on the edge of his vision, but can feel his breath in his ear, taste the familiar scent of him, tea and wool, a whiff of his old cologne and a touch of earth and grass and musk. John brings his other hand to steady Sherlock’s head, warm palm cupping his temple as he’s working to remove the leaf without pulling at the messy, still gelled, curls. Sherlock wants to press into the touch, mush his face against the red skin of John’s hand, discover if it’s soft or calloused like his fingers.
Sherlock had told him about her first attempt at speaking. Her mother was gone then. They were searching, trying to get ahead of her, every time the GPS showed a new location, signs of movement, anything. He remembers how he came back from work grumpy and irritated, how Sherlock had told him about her blabbing the same syllable all day since John left, how that syllable had been ‘Da’ and how Sherlock believed she was trying to say ‘Daddy’, calling on John. He remembers how he had scoffed, said there were more important things to do than teach her to call him ‘Daddy’ which he would hate no matter when it happened. Sherlock had fallen silent and John hadn’t bothered to tell him that he would prefer ‘Papa’. Sherlock never told him anything else after that.
“There is something...”
He is smiling to himself.
“Uh-uh. Oranges”
He almost chuckles, getting some bandage tape from the first aid kit and cutting it with his teeth.
It’s barely a whisper, and has Sherlock start, before he tries to focus.
“Alright.”
“How was your day?”
Broken. Broken child from a broken home.
But no. He’s everything. Everything he’s been through. He is everything and now he’s here.
Also note: if you are struggling with depression and/or anxiety: hang on. We love you.
He is letting them down. He asked John to stay, and there is an ‘always’ he must honor. There is the company on sleepless nights which he must repay. Ensure the sharing of time and space over meals and tea, every moment that gives John solid ground beneath his feet. Spend time with his little bee, bask in every minute spent with her. He must
Not here. Oh, no, not here. He can’t do this here. Can’t let them see. Can’t let them find out in such a way.
“For your appointment of 10am?” She doublechecks, maybe sensing the hesitance in the air.
“She said a lot of things. She always does”
Sherlock opens his eyes, and scrambles for his phone. When the screen is unlocked, the photograph he took this morning of little bee with her elephant and elephant drawing greets him with its warm light. He opens his messages, breath held in his throat until the conversation loads. But there they are. He scrolls up, fast and then more slowly, each message sending a small jolt of liquid, bittersweet joy to his abdomen, small ruffling shivers at his spine.
John does.

He was right. He was right. Staying away was right. It will happen again. He will only do it again. How can Sherlock not see? He has to make him see. He
Sherlock catches him looking like that, utterly lovestruck, and gives a tender little smile, even kind of apologetic. John notes to correct that.
“John-”
Sherlock brings iodine and gauze from the bathroom, sits beside John, and removes the handkerchief from his left hand. It’s sticky with dried blood. He cleans the grazed knuckles and phalanges as best he can with a tea-towel soaked in lukewarm water, dabs iodine on the abrasions, and wraps the entire palm up with gauze. The nails are chipped and bloodied too, so he washes John’s fingers carefully, but there is not much he can do there except apply some iodine to the worst of the scratches.
Sherlock takes a step back, not wanting to scare the little cornered animal that John has turned into more -at least not more than he already has. He decides to let himself be seen, instead of looming over John from behind, as if he were a threat.
Over gritted teeth, over the tears slowly appearing in her eyes, he got to his knees and started trying to make sense of the destruction.
“No. Now is good”, he says, putting his phone away and uncrossing his legs. He leans a little forward in his armchair, trying to show he is attentive but not worried.
#we_feed_on_comments
“What do you mean what am
Silence.
“John. Please”
Although nothing can compensate for having to take care and fend off a drunken fool that lives in your home without asking.
He ends the call and turns his phone off. He’s seething. Anger pooling to every limb of his body. Energy boiling him alive. He can’t go to his seminar today. He fucking can’t. Shame drowns him. His last word outburst doesn’t even come close to make him start feeling any better. He is shaking whole. He can only grab his bag and run.
“How should I know?”
Sherlock doesn’t respond. John can feel his piercing gaze between his shoulder-blades, wonders if it could one day trail lower. He bites his lip, shaking his head, pressing harder against the poor sink.
“Oh…”
The two voices had stopped moving in tandem. Rosie’s crying got quieter, as John’s frustration blew harder about him. Sherlock flinched when it reached a sudden peak. “Enough! Enough, goddammit! Enough! Stop it!”
Physical damage touches the mental one.
Tangled and floating. The courtship begins.
? Well, he did not know, and it seemed that was how it had to be, today. Sherlock’s pulse hammered in his throat.
One… Two…
That kind of love. How could this be love? How could this be anything? They’re broken. Oh, so broken…
“John?..”
“Because she got to me. Because… Because she did
Oh, small checking in: update schedule is a chapter per week, and so far Thursdays have worked out nicely, so we are sticking with them.
“Hey, look at me.”
His body descends into autopilot, battle-weary tension seeping out to be replaced by needles pinching his every muscle into numbness. His mind travels to a time far gone, to 221B empty and silent. Not the silence of impending doom, but the one after it. With dust hanging in the corners of his vision, with a forever unoccupied armchair opposite his own, the one he looked and looked and looked at, trying to will the man who belonged there back into existence.
“I know. I guess it’s a miracle you haven’t told me to shut up already-”
She didn’t speak for a while. He looked down at his feet. She was watching him.
She took one good look at him.
“Now, now, let’s not be hasty.” A cutting baritone cuts the curtain of the world in half and John emerges, blinded by the light. “We all know who needs to reconsider, don’t we?”
The presence against him fills in, like the outline of a sketch being pencilled in with colour; from dream to solid man, from unattainable hope to reality. Their stubble catches and rubs and chafes. Sherlock’s breath catches hitches, and then a beam of light buzzes and bursts from his belly to the rest of his body. There’s so much he wants to do, to have, to
Sherlock looks down at a Honeybee securely strapped on his chest and can’t hold back a smile. She looks up, as if she has felt him looking at her, the back of her head pressing against his sternum. He smiles more.
“Of course. Yes. Okay.”
“I just don’t understand you at all.” She keeps on, avoiding his gaze.
“She left. Mum left”, John sighs “I was ten, I think”
“I am merely having a bath, John.” Sherlock strives for firm and collected.
Sherlock helps her out of her chair and walks beside her, as she trots to the fridge, drawing in one hand, pink stuffed elephant clutched tight by an ear in the other.
He takes it all in at once, blinking slowly in the darkness of the gloomy morning. John, three boxes, two suitcases, Rosie. John.
“Don’t we want Sherlock to tell us, mm?” He smooths out her worry with a smile and her eyes shine in recognition. She reaches a palm to Sherlock immediately, grabby fingers kneading the air.
It takes some moments, but he smiles. He is happy, like this. He can be. For as long as it lasts, it is a reality he wants to live.
that.
, is all Sherlock can hear.
He felt his throat tighten. ‘No, I don’t want pity, if that’s what all this is about, thank you very much’-
“Nno”
“Aren’t you being too treacherous for your age?” John tried to smile at her, making another attempt at tempting her with a spoonful of her fruit crème.
“Yes?”
“She’ll feel safer, right?”
And this time… This time John can reach. John is there on time. John can find him.
Sherlock can hardly breathe, lest the moment breaks instead of dissipating like the changing sunset hues.
But noble as it may generally be, in its wish to make things better, John’s responsibility hurt. Being ignored was straightforward. Being pushed away, denied, the same. Not-good. Wrong. He could be those things. He could bear it. But being treated as a living reminder of failure, of a situation in need of a fix-up, was worse. He wasn’t even not-good anymore. He was a means to an end. He might as well have had any name, any shape, any face. And so he had none.
“Are you okay?” His voice comes in pauses.
It would be Honeybee’s first bath in 221B in more than six months. Sherlock had checked that the water was at the right temperature, gathered her favourite bath toys and arranged them around the tub, found an unopened bottle of baby-safe, no-tears shampoo, which had remained in the cupboard since the previous spring. Rosie, oblivious, was playing on the towels he had strewn on the floor for her. When it was time to carry her inside the tub he did so gently, kneeling to lower her in, even though his not yet fully-healed ribs had screamed in protest. She had clung onto him like a kitten terrified of being drowned the moment her feet touched the water. Sherlock had tried to soothe her with his voice, but she had kicked and whined, burying her face in his chest. He had immediately scooped her up into his arms and cuddled her close, for as long as she had needed. She still needed a bath, but he wasn’t going to repeat the experience; he had to ease her into it, somewhere where she would feel safer, more in control.
“I’d find a way,” John replies, “Make a list just for me, things I could do on my own.”
He doesn’t bother trying to find a better lie. Sherlock will know. Probably already does, anyway.
He doesn’t ever complete the sentence, but John understands well enough, has had his own fair share of terror-filled nightmares involving Sherlock’s demise to know how difficult it is to just shake it off.
no point. Until now,” Sherlock is speaking more to his pasta than to John at this point, but John gives his leg an encouraging squeeze nonetheless.
“I thought I’d try it on for a while,” Sherlock replies, throwing him his robe. “Now, come on, time for presents!”
John brushes their lips together, “Tell me, love.”
“Five more minutes,” Sherlock whines, closing his own eyes.
Sherlock nods with enthusiasm, noticing the scalpels.
“Did you order Thai?” he asks, noticing the smell.
So no.
“Sholto?”
“John,” Sherlock says once more, feeling choked up and mystified.
win because you said “no, no, no” to me. I don’t -
“You won’t be once we get to Angelo’s, remember?”
Sherlock remains silent. John doesn’t blame him. He hadn’t thought saying it out loud would make his whole body ache like this.
John chuckles, not sure what to make of this statement.
“Hi,” John smiles, lazy, eyes drooping already. “Just came to say hi.”
Sherlock rolls his head to the side and cranks one eye open at the butt on the floor, grins slightly.
"Y-yes. Of course"
John snarls. No. Just a dream. Is it a dream? No. This is reality. His feet find flesh. His fists find hair.  A yank. A throw. A tuft left between cold fingers. Dripping blood. One lonely ebony curl. No. A step back and he’s on the roof again.
“Where’s Sherlock? Go get Sherlock! Come on, little Rose, where is he?”
“Oh? Like you make an exception for me?”
‘Pfft, what’s the point, hm?’
“Good. Now, if our little girl is feeling up to it, I have some games I would like her to play with me before you go.” Chloe leans forward with her warm smile and Rosie, having sensed both John’s and Sherlock’s relaxed moods, gives her a tiny smile back.
Her voice makes him snap back into focus.
“Isn’t this better?”
...In other words,  thus ends Part 1 of our story. Been a bumpy ride, but at least they have finally reached a point where they can begin to truly interact, talk, and get out of this loop they have been stuck in for so long.
“Ah…” A light flickered.
Honeybee’s eyes, azure jewels, followed him as his feet imprinted the dull route on the floor and carpet, over and over.
“Yes.”
“Better?” John wants to reach and brush Sherlock’s hair, he knows it calms him, but instead he pats and then holds his knee. Sherlock settles sitting properly with a small sigh of resignation.
This chapter meant to be even longer, but alas, we decided to move some scenes further down the line. Our initial writing plan for every chapter was 4k to 5k but we began to realise for the second week in a row, our lovely boys need more, need time, need love, and they are telling the story after all. So, poor us are going to have to adjust in order to accommodate both our boys and our Thursday updates properly from now on.
That is why the line shifts. Why John denied it as fervently as he could, why he always took a step away under scrutiny, why he was so resistant to as small and stupid a trend as product in one’s hair.
A strip of consciousness nudges against his mind. Sherlock clutches it and crawls onto his back again. The blanket has been kicked off the bed, the sheets are a vortex around his legs. His breaths come out in puffs, but they are slow, and even though he is hyper-aware of the way his heart is beating, when he can clench his jaw enough to think past the fear for it, there is nothing abnormal about its rhythm.
His morning pills await him on his part of the table, neatly arranged on a napkin. Sherlock stops arranging cutlery and plates, his gaze fixing on the four little tablets paraded like soldiers. He hasn’t thought about morning or evening pills in a long while. He always finds them like that, on the coffee table, or at breakfast. Even if he wakes up first, they’re there. It has been the matter of course since John told him that they are friends. And before that, even… Which means no more fumbling about, or struggling to remember them all, or being afraid to take them alone -he had developed an irrational fear of choking on them, not aided by his reflux syndrome in the least.
‘Yes, this could be very nice.’
“Hm…”  John is biting his lip. Sherlock’s eyes remain on him, like a caress. John takes a deep breath, his chest puffing. “I loved them because… I could lie down without thinking of… without hearing
We are all slaves of time though… and time… Time slides.
But what? How?
Sherlock used to be able to wait for this to pass. Now he just lies still.
“Dawaa.” She mumbled, and Sherlock conceded, and John watched his smooth eyebrows, scarce as they were, softening along with her smile.
He smiles, like he hadn’t for ages.
“There you are. It’s alright. Everything’s good. We’re not letting anything happen to her, mm?”
There is an important factor in answering this, one Sherlock has been wanting to avoid, but one which will never avoid him: what if the danger is
Maybe yesterday he crossed a line of his own.
He sees John, awake in the middle of the night with him, smiling just a little, just knowingly enough. Feels the warm cup of tea in his palms, the warmth with which it was given. Thinks how maybe if he goes to the kitchen again, John will find him. Will join him there, solid and patient, and wait through the night terrors beside him. There is no time to rationalize the thought. He grabs it and holds on for passage through the storm.
“It’s okay. We can make something else”, he soothes. “You must eat something. It’s not good to skip breakfast. So we won’t”
“What about this gentleman, flower?” He kisses Rosie’s temple, getting her attention. She makes an inquisitive noise. “Can Sherlock and Papa guess where he lives, do you think?”
Sherlock breathes in relief and begins to recount Honeybee’s schedule and activities for the day; when she ate and what and how much, how many times he changed her diaper, with what she played and when, for how long she napped.
until his face is submerged, and the pressure in his very soul is equal, until his ears truly can hear nothing but the beat of his heart. Slowing. Normal.
Of course, John is not stupid. He did not do it out of ignorance -most probably out of genuine emotion. Since he regarded Sherlock as  a member of his family, given his words tonight, he then took it for granted all this while that whatever he said and did had a very specific frame to be interpreted in.
“Sleep?”
He thinks he does, but ceiling and sun-less bright sky blend into one, indistinguishable, overwhelming. He is adrift, he is asleep. He is lying, he is sinking. He is trapped in the covers, he is taken under by the tide. There is no time to breathe, to cry out. There is only the endless crossing from one world to the other, or rather the interminable lingering on the threshold, neither here, nor there, and so in both places at once. Terror builds up in his arms, his legs, like white, frothy foam; he cannot open his eyes.
“Mm?”
“I meant every word.”
John chuckles, shakes his head.
“Yeah?” John’s tongue shoots to dab on the middle of his lower lip. Sherlock’s eyes follow its movement, how it’s slow and deliberate, sharing glistening moisture with the darker flesh pink of John’s lips.
The rejection just makes Honeybee turn her attention back to Sherlock, and she renews her efforts at trying to feed him.
“Want to watch something? Was thinking… maybe a film, this time? For the special occasion?”, John grins, remote in hand.
“Still, you… you’re not what she said.”
This morning has to be the best since that day. By far. John feels ten years younger, waking with the sun that has started to come up earlier as they approach the whimsical March that is sure to bring them some heavy downpours before allowing the temperature to rise -sulky month- and rejoicing at the thought his shift was an afternoon one. Cut in half today, not a full eight hours, arranged so he could attend his anger management afterwards. Making Sherlock a luscious breakfast at the start of a new week and having some time with his baby flower on her most energetic hours of the day were the biggest perks anyone could wish for, even more so; John.
“He’s got a nice range. Plus, the humour.” Sherlock says, shrugging.
“Hudders.” Sherlock rolls his eyes.
“I… I will be. Fine. I just… Sleep. Bad sleep, I mean. That is all. My capabilities are not affected, I assure you. Nothing is amiss” He kept pushing through his words, willing them to flow.
‘Cool down. Take a deep breath. Think it through.’
Sherlock smiles at them. Cautious.
“Let me go downstairs and check, dear-”
Deep blue swirls in Sherlock’s chest, deep and yet soft like mist, throbbing.
John turns, surprised to find Sherlock beside him.
He hears the soft click of the door opening, and turns around slowly to see Sherlock emerging from his bedroom door -of course- with small, finally sock-clad steps for once. He must really have been getting cold in the tub to wear the precious silken devils. He surveys John with pale eyes stormed by green reluctance.
This chapter is slightly smaller than previous ones, but we are trying to regulate our lives along with sufficient updates for you, so bare with us. We'll work hard to give you new chapters as regularly as possible even if they are smaller sometimes ;)
“The big ship sank to the bottom of the sea, the bottom of the sea, the bottom of the sea.” John bursts into a serenade with a smirk, Rosie hopping on his knees again, gracing her father with the delight she’s still inclined to hum with him into higher notes and quicker rhythms.
‘Cute.’ Especially when it seems to make him stop nibbling at his fingers and fidget, hands now resting on his lap, neat and steady. John is smiling and for the second time this morning Sherlock smiles back, small but blinding, and they are soon back to finishing their early breakfast, John going down to gather the morning paper at some point, Sherlock putting effort in eating a few more bites than usual, waiting for the familiar little murmurs through the baby monitor together.
“You don’t need to redeem yourself through me, John. If this is what it is, then please-”
John’s ears are heating up.
Eager eyes take the cover in, the first few pages. It’s a chemistry reference book, and a updated edition. Expensive, new copy… Sherlock’s eyes shoot up to John’s face.
“Of course”
“Oh god. Hadn’t thought about that” John groans. It’s impossible for either of them to forget her heartbroken face when her elephant was not there at breakfast the previous morning.
They look at each other.
Sherlock does not want to lose him. The knowledge aches, turns him raw from the inside. But isn’t he but a fraction of the man he used to be? A liar?
guilty. A coward. He deserves it.
” The way she says ‘them’ is bitter enough that Sherlock can feel it numbing out his tongue.
The fear is real. Engulfing. Asphyxiating.
“She’s here, she’s doing better, she’s alright.” John breathes, slow and soothing.
Sherlock nods, although he is not sure to what he has just consented.
‘Yes. We can.’
Sherlock glares.
‘Anything. Everything.’
“The captain said, ‘It will never, never do. Never, ever do. Never, ever do.’”
Who was he kidding? This wouldn’t work for long. Nothing could work in their circumstances.
He remembers John’s decision. How little bee should be examined, tested, to make sure she is alright physically, to determine the reason why she is a late talker. He swallows. Honeybee giggles as she has managed to stack the fifth block and gives him a wide smile. He whimpers and takes her in his arms, folding them around her like a cocoon, soft inside and hardened outside, against the world. He breathes her in, as if he could never smell her again after this moment, memorizing the way she feels, baby-soft, into his embrace. She is tiny, compared to him. As tall as his knee, maybe. The thought of strangers’ hands on her… of a stranger’s voice describing her, defining her, seeking for something to call wrong in her, a stranger’s eyes looking at her just like any other baby, unable to see her smiles, the way she clutches her pink elephant when she sleeps, how she always tries to feed her baby cream to everyone she sees instead of eating it herself. He shudders, curls his entire body around her. No-one will call Honeybee a freak. No-one.
He shook his head. It wasn’t yes or no, but it could be whatever John wanted to see.
“I’ll get some.” John’s ecstatic for an unknown reason. He clears his throat, sobering up.
Rosie makes a weird coughing noise, sounding almost like exasperation -the toddler version-, and hides her face in Mrs Hudson’s neck as John reaches to hold her. His hand recoils, rigid on his side, and he offers an understanding disciplined nod, refraining from taking her from such a loving embrace that she has, and wants, from the elderly woman.
It puzzles him. John knows Sherlock loves her and he takes excellent care of her when John is gone, occupied at the clinic or any other of his new scheduled responsibilities. On one hand, he’s clinging on the tight program, depending on its efficiency to be able and cope. It’s second nature to him, reminding him of his army days, keeping him intact and never leaving his hands empty while at the same time not letting him spend all hours at home with Rosie, as that would be pressing on both of them.
Sherlock gapes at him. John bounces on his toes for a moment, avoiding his gaze but smiling. Small and secretive. ‘I’m blushing, aren’t I?’
Sherlock shrugs, his eyes back on the TV screen. “Dunno” Greg had not asked him to help on any, and even if he did, there was nothing now that Sherlock could possibly help with. He does not want to speak of that truth. Not now. He wants to remain useful in John’s eyes. For a little bit more…
And the ripples it creates.
“I don’t want to press him.” He tuned to his own feelings on the matter, not wanting to compromise Sherlock’s privacy more.
“You are hardly to blame when I should-“
He gets on with breakfast, lost in thought. He fries some eggs and scrambles the rest, toasts some bread and leaves it plain, knowing Sherlock likes to spread his own butter. Efficient and quick, John has the tea done and ready along with scones -cut but not buttered, yet again- and marmalade on the tray, by the time the streetlights outside turn off to let the day commence.
“Hamish… I never quite told you myself.”
He had appeared harsher than he wanted. He knows, but he can’t take it back. He can’t let Sherlock get sick. Not with his immune system, they had worked so hard to repair piece by piece.
John can see the moment the atmosphere becomes rigid again. The air thick and achingly painful to take in.
John inhales, his chest puffing out like a balloon, and then lets the air go slowly, his shoulders sagging. “Sherlock, I…” He closes his eyes, pinches the bridge of his nose.
Sherlock’s eyes snap open. It’s dark in his room, dark and silent. Only the small light of his phone charging gives any semblance of contact with some part of the outside world. He can’t move. His own breaths weigh him down, sealing him up as if in a tomb.
A muffled gasp and a twitch, Sherlock has taken his hand away by instinct, biting on his lip. John lets the flashlight fall.
“So, you think it has been going on for a while?”
Freakish. How the voices can get mixed in his mind. Sherlock never called him that… He grimaces.
“Does she need to be hospitalised?”, he manages.
“You are pressing yourself more than you should”
No worry could be more morbid than this gut-hollowing feeling.
No time to think, now.
“I’m all ears, John.” Sherlock’s voice rolls intrigued. He’s smiling.
“Awaaa!” Rosie squeals, giggling. Her good mood is back.
‘You mad genius! It’s always you, isn’t it?’
Sherlock tries to breathe, to concentrate on the rhythm with which his chest swells and falls. It doesn’t work well, because it leaves his mind too much space to wander. Without the rigid constraints it used to have, it is difficult to check where it can go, impossible to rein it in.
Sherlock all but jumps to the ceiling. John pulls his hand away, fingers accidentally brushing over the small, sweaty curls of Sherlock’s nape -longer than usual; he hasn’t had a haircut since… who knows- and takes a step back.
It made him feel unclean, too big in his own skin,
The smile his question had provoked was small, and bitter. But it had been there.
“What?”
The door to 221B is open when John is not home, letting Mrs. Hudson come and go as she pleases. Even if her hip has been giving her a hard time lately, preventing her from visiting as often as she would have, she always likes to make her presence very much felt. If she is in too much pain, she will shout at him if they need anything from the bottom of the stairs and he will reply in the same fashion, leaning against the banister. Sherlock is grateful for the company when, and however, he has it. There is only so much he can do to spend the time, even with how demanding Rosie’s care is. Mrs. Hudson is a welcome distraction -and another human being to communicate with.
“STOP!” He’s the one screaming now.
“Really?”, John asked eagerly, but with self-conscious doubt in his voice.
“No, I know!” John interrupts. “I know she understands and- Just, hear me out a moment.”
It wasn't just him thinking all these snake-poison thoughts. John was there too, all these months apart. And he wasn't better, he wasn't happy. He was angry, and lost, was afraid of forgiveness. Thought
“Good. Again?”
‘I wish you were with me’
“I want her…” John hesitates, then they are facing each other, Sherlock’s head tipped a tiny bit forward to aid his view of John, and he feels so close and so accepting and pure that John’s heart starts losing ground. “I want her to love them because of…” He swallows, voice breathy. “Because of this.” He gestures between them, around them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Something is different. The voice seems clearer. He pays no mind, grabs at his hair tight and pulls. Helpless. Can’t even be decent and respectful enough to his own self anymore.
Sherlock hums. “Where’s the catch?”, he pouts, nose crinkling in that way John would otherwise find adorable.
“She seemed to like it”
“Alright, alright, little lady, there you go.” John kisses her forehead and transfers her to the older woman’s arms as she rolls her eyes at his affection all in good humour. “Have fun, will you?”
A crash. He turned around, startled. Sherlock was curled in the armchair, his eyes on the sight in front of John. He saw his jaw muscles clench. And then the grey eyes had flown away. He let his eyes trail lower. Lower. To the mess a few steps away.
He is not sure if it is because she remembers him, or because the gesture always made her happy, or both, but the little one squeals in delight and ‘boops’ him back, little lips kissing his nose messily.
that it will ever get abandoned.
He hears John’s steps. But he does not sit. He waits, stiff and still -with his arms at his sides, Sherlock imagines.
He had almost forgotten how this worked.
“Sherlock?”
John startles as the weight is lifted of his arms and Sherlock is now standing, tall and firm, Rosie held over his chest already. Sherlock nods.
Sherlock does not need to see her face to know she will have a button nose, and a pair of the coldest blue eyes.
“You love me,” Sherlock finally says, not really a question, but still sounding amazed.
“What good will it do,” John asks, feeling the first tremor of irritation coming up, “to make the bed in a time like this?”
Once John enters 221B, Sherlock is very nearly sweating through his jacket, too, but he ignores it in favour of deducing the man before him: well rested, slightly nervous, freshly shaven, date shoes, jacket slightly crumpled where Rosie had been held -
You asked what reading your last a paragraph made me want to do, remember?
John beams a little harder, lacing his fingers with Sherlock’s. “Yes. Married.”
I’m writing this letter after coming home, having just posted the previous and finding myself regretting it. I’m not sure I should have sent it to you, not when I barely took the time to read it a second time before putting it in the envelope. I was angry, and I’m sorry if I said anything that’ll hurt you. It wasn’t my intention. But at the same time, I do hope it will make you react. Because I meant it. We can’t let one day ruin everything. We said we were going to fight for each other, and that’s what I’m doing right now.
, he thinks, watching as Rosie tries to catch Sherlock’s attention with one of her toys. Vainly trying apparently. Sherlock hasn’t moved from the sofa since they’ve been back, staring at the ceiling and replying with groans and hums only. John smiles as Rosie turns towards him, frowning before crawling to her other toys, probably thinking she can find one that will interest Sherlock.
, let’s go, John!” He practically drags John out the front door and, as ever, John follows, patiently, understandingly, even if he does grumble a little bit.
John. SH
“John,” Sherlock moans, beginning to shake in his arms, “John, John,
John is about to take a proper look when a loud noise echoes in the hall. All three of them look at the door, silent.
We can find our way through this?
I doubt I could. I’m not good at this sort of thing. SH
“I would have neve-”
“What is it?”
“That’s ridiculous,” Sherlock blurts out, lifting himself up onto his elbow to look down into John’s eyes. “That doesn’t make any sense. We’ve both got baggage and, quite frankly, I know every bit of baggage you carry and I carry it, too. It’s
“I don’t want to be with you.”
I wasn’t supposed to tell you this, but he had a sniper on you. You were in danger. If I didn’t jump, I was risking your life, and Mrs Hudson’s, and Lestrade’s. I couldn’t do that. You have to believe me. It was the only way…
Sherlock sighs, eyes fluttering close as he leans into the touch.
“You asked why I was here,” he says instead.
Sherlock picks up his violin, plucking on a string for a few seconds before dropping it back on the chair.
A few minutes had ticked by where Sherlock thought of nothing, just the sound of John breathing next to him, aware of John’s eyes on his profile. He had felt safe and contained in the bed they had just so creatively put to use.
Sherlock’s eyes widen just a little, as if the promise of a ring wasn’t obvious.
“Don’t you think it should be?” Sherlock finally says. “Don’t you think it already is?”
Goodnogth John. SH
He’s just about to change back into sleeping clothes when Sherlock’s bedroom door flies open.
“This!” Sherlock gestures between the two of them.
Sherlock shakes his head, “You’re taking her with you.”
Sherlock wakes up with a fright. John is leaning over him. It reminds him of Serbia and hot flashes of iron, a cruel, scarred man’s eyes staring down into his as he tried to slumber through the pain.
“Don’t fall,” he smiles against his lips, marveling at the realisation that sex with Sherlock involves so much joy.
“Really?”
“What will be the first thing you do once you can freely be outside again?” John asks one morning.
,” he whispers urgently and John nods once, understanding what he needs. “Ink yourself on me forever.”
Sholto? SH
I can’t wait. SH
“Felt?” Sherlock asks, his own eyes stinging slightly now.
They go quiet.
It is always the same these past few weeks. People worrying over every little symptom, some leaving relieved when proven wrong, others going home with bad news to share. Sherlock knows perfectly well just how all of this is affecting John everytime he has a shift, and so he doesn’t ask for more, simply watches as John notices the changes inside the flat.
I’ll be there. SH
“We’ve also established that I’m an idiot and right now I’m not entirely sure I understand what you’re saying exactly.”
“I sometimes worry...” he began again after a pause.
“Hmm. That’s probably an infinity sign. With… morse code?”
Sherlock nods and John hurries to type a quick email. He puts his phone on the table between them, not exactly sure if he should wish for a rapid reply or not. Sherlock is still more playing with his food than eating it, but John takes a few more sips of his soup before asking, “So, how’s everyone?”
He arrives at the crime scene barely thirty minutes later, anxious about who he will see there and trying desperately to push it out of his mind. He can’t allow this to overtake the work. The work must be held above all, paramount to his continued existence. This is why he deflected sentiment for all those years. Hideous and heinous and
Sherlock hums his agreement into another kiss before standing up. John follows quickly, thanking the shop owner for the movie on their way out. Sherlock laces their fingers together as soon as they’re outside, and John lets him lead the way.
“Oh no, dear,” Mrs Hudson exclaims during their fight. “I hope you now communicate with each other at the very least.”
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock nods, his excitement contagious in the end. “I’m gonna need to research that as soon as we’re back in Lon—”
John Watson
John pulls him down for another kiss. “I love you. You know that, right?”
Sherlock glares at him. “At least they’re saved.”
I get to decide then, if not the way in which I’d prefer to handle my affairs?”
I haven’t told you about this ache that takes over me whenever you’re close. On crime scenes, in cabs or restaurants, at home or in the middle of the bloody street. I ache to touch you. To link your fingers with mine, to thread my hand into your hair, to kiss the skin of your neck. And to kiss you, Sherlock. How often I wish I could kiss you. Some days, it was all I could think about. Getting up from my chair and sealing our lips. Whispering against your mouth how amazing you are. Playing with your lower lip to shut you up in front of the tv. Waking you up, slowly, softly, in our bed, long kisses turning into much more.
Tonight they’re in John’s car. John behind the wheel for some reason makes Sherlock feel a little bit warm, as though it’s a prelude for things to come. The thought sends a little flutter down low in his belly, but he does nothing to block it. He’s allowed. For once in his life, he’s allowed to think like this. The whole ride to the restaurant, when John isn’t changing gears, he has his hand splayed on Sherlock’s thigh, firm and possessive almost.
“Yes, exactly. Exactly four years old,” John says purposively, holding Sherlock’s gaze with his chin up.
“What for?” Sherlock’s arm is already slipping through the sleeve of his coat, one of the only constants in all this time: the deep blue tweed with the red buttonhole and the man beneath it.
“Something?”
She all but throws them out with more congratulations and promises to invite them both out to properly celebrate after the New Year. Sherlock rushes upstairs to get both of their coats. John takes his hand as soon as they’re outside, one finger stroking where Sherlock’s ring will soon be. The cold air makes him shiver but Sherlock is already pulling at his waist.
I’m certain it’s more than me. SH
“We should think of a way for you to continue your experiments, since Rosie is going to walk soon,” John says, knowing just how dangerous it can all get once she does.
“Doubts. Fears.”
, Sherlock kisses him some more, slowing things down. John catches on immediately, the hand currently on Sherlock’s lower back now stroking softly.  And this is what Sherlock missed the most, just the feeling of John’s presence overwhelming him, taking over everything else, and letting himself drown in it. And so, without another word needed, they discover each other all over again. He lets John undress him piece by piece only to do the same with shaking hands. John doesn’t drag them to bed and Sherlock doesn’t complain, here and there is absolutely perfect as long as John keeps kissing and stroking and panting.
“No, no,” John says, shaking his head. “Don’t. They’ll be thrilled to see you.”
“You promised, remember.”
So you’re just not going to call me back, is that it?
Here’s mine: Mary was never the love of my life.
Sherlock’s free hand slides up his arm until it finds his neck. “Six months is a very long time, John.”
“Where?”
Sherlock doesn't reply, simply nodding, eyes now closed and lips parted. Getting the message quite clearly, John leans in closer, catching Sherlock’s upper lip between his own. The longing moan echoing in the room wakes up something warm in John’s body, and so he finds himself kissing Sherlock just a little harder, curious. The hand on his hip is now curled around the fabric of his shirt, a quiet demand which John answers with yet another kiss.
He never considered the fact that John wouldn’t be his to have when he did eventually make it. When he thinks about it now, he realises how stupid he was for thinking that John wouldn’t move on. He never belonged to him in the first place, so
Me too. I can think of a number of ways you could easily prevent me from being bored… SH
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes at him.
“I know,” John replies, kissing each eyelid softly. “I figured I’d save it for last.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I wish I wouldn’t have to, just like I know you wish it too. I wish I could whisper what I’m about to write against your lips, against your neck. Now even more than ever. I know I’ve made the choice to go, and I know you’re supporting me in that choice because you think of me before thinking about yourself. I’m not sure what to think about all this for now, and I wish I could find the words to explain how lucky it makes me feel, but at the same time, how worried too. I read your email so many times now (Julian made fun of me for hours after I received it), and I’m certain I could recite every word you wrote.
When they part, John says, “Been thinking about that all day.”
Sherlock comes first, arching beneath him, and John is quick to follow. He properly collapses on him afterward this time, breathing hard into Sherlock’s neck. It takes another long minute or two before Sherlock can finally talk again.
Another nod. “Too much to memorise to bother with sleep.”
Love you too.
It has only been a couple of months, but Sherlock is still surprised anew almost every day that John hasn’t lost patience with him and, most importantly, that he continues to make an effort to understand him and accept him for who and what he is. Even though John always insists that’s never going to change, a part of Sherlock is ever suspicious that it may well could. Today’s appointment could change that, somehow, if only for Sherlock’s own peace of mind. It’s silly and meaningless ultimately, but he needs to do this. For both of them.
“Speaking, yes.”
“That’s a good thing, love.”
“He is probably never going to make us pay for eating there ever again,” Sherlock says.
(...)
“As I suspected, most of the board members are involved, but now I have everything I need to make them stop.” Mark turns back to look at Sherlock. “All thanks to you, Sherlock.”
“How s-”
“Fine.”
“Think about it,” John says. “Now we have to shower. Together.”
“I will,” Sherlock smiles, his feet coming to brush John’s under the table.
“All I do know,” Sherlock starts, sobering for a moment, “Is that I couldn’t do this if… I wouldn’t be able to stand it if…”
Sleep well, maybe even dream of me ;)
Sherlock's hands are grasped around his shirt, holding tightly against him, "Home," he says, his voice breaking into a sob, and John presses his own lips against his face.
He reaches out with his right hand and clasps the back of Sherlock’s neck, his thumb rubbing little circles into the hairline. Sherlock leans back into the touch.
“Mycroft can arrange that.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
John Watson
Sherlock closes his eyes, nuzzling his face against John’s neck. “I don’t know.”
“But why?”
John holds back a snort at the obvious flirting, trying to catch Sherlock’s eye like they always used to do, silent jokes only they could understand. But Sherlock is looking back, still staring at the screen, cheeks flushed.
“Yeah,” John says. “Oh.”
But getting a door slammed in his face had cleared out his ideas of all fantasies and words entirely. And now he felt like the most complete idiot, travelling to an entire other continent to open his heart. He should have known it would end up like this. One look at Sherlock, and he had lost all of his nerve. Telling him everything had seemed so logical, he had nothing left to lose after all. Their friendship was hanging by a loose thread so, really, confessing his feelings couldn’t do more damage. And yet, it now feels impossible.
“Ready to go back to sleep?”
Sherlock nods slowly, “A solution.”
Sherlock stops on his way to the rhino area, eyes shining with excitement.
“John, wait,” Sherlock says, but it’s as far as he can go right now and, as the seconds tick by into minutes, John huffs out an unamused laugh and nods once, tearing his eyes off of Sherlock’s.
They don’t talk much for the entire walk home, this comfortable silence John had thought lost settling back between them. Sherlock finds his journal as soon as they get home, sitting down on the sofa and letting John take care of their food. He sets it all down on the coffee table, sitting next to Sherlock and reaching for the remote control.
John comes to sit next to him, reaching for the journal to read the complete list. “Some of these could be a challenge, definitely would help you kill time. But remember, pa-”
“Character building, I guess.”
“Yes. You and I both know how viruses work; being allowed to go out doesn’t mean it’s gone.”
“I thought she’d come with. I just assumed. I wouldn’t want her to feel left out,” Sherlock stammers, but that isn’t it. The truth is, Sherlock was counting on Rosie to break any tension or potential awkwardness. Her not coming with put the figure at well below 84% now, and he wasn’t prepared for this kind of revision. In fact, he’d have to spend a considerable amount of time coming up with a new -
John plants a kiss on his naked shoulder. “What are you writing?”
When John breaks the kiss a few minutes later, Sherlock grunts out his dissatisfaction, to which John smiles lightly and runs his hands through Sherlock’s hair, his eyes trailing a journey from his eyes to his mouth, which he captures again for a brief peck.
Sherlock can’t help but feel proud, and for a second or so he finds himself unable to say anything. It feels as if it’s been ages since they’ve actually talked, but John, being his wonderful self, is already asking him if he’s working on case, and Sherlock
hunt for the truth. Maybe he doesn’t appreciate it when it’s directed at him, sure, but he’s never outright refused him like this before. Which only serves to heighten Sherlock’s already-intense curiosity.
When are you planning to be back? SH
John smiles,“Thank you, love,” before heading for the kitchen to wash his hands and face.
looked after you when you were out of your mind and barely making sense.
“You’re beautiful,” John murmurs against his bare skin, meaning it with all his heart. Sherlock shivers in his arms, and John smiles as he kisses his way up his back and nape, pressing them back together. “You’re absolutely beautiful, Sherlock.”
He decides to switch gears: “I’ve got a case on, actually. Lestrade just called. Sounds promising. A seven, maybe an eight.”
“Sherlock?”
“Or Paris. Or Amsterdam. Or Cape Town.”
“For what?”
“Can we wake up like this again tomorrow?” Sherlock asks once they part, panting.
Sherlock grunts in agreement. They had already moved most of Sherlock’s furniture and clothing up to John’s room so that Rosie could have his old room - less stairs; plus, John’s room is bigger and gets more light, John had argued. Sherlock really didn’t care whose room they slept in each night as long as they were together, so he hadn’t objected to any of it. The only thing he had insisted on was that they get rid of John’s old bed and use Sherlock’s instead. When John had asked why, Sherlock had just shrugged, saying that his mattress was more comfortable, not wanting to admit that he didn’t like the idea that another person - any one of John’s previous, inane girlfriends - would have ever slept in their bed before him.
- grown beyond that. Beyond me.
Sherlock stands from the couch, done with self-exploration for the day. The conclusion is that he supposes he can’t fault John for not loving him back, but he doesn’t have to be glad of it.
I’m not perfect, but you know that already. I’m… inexperienced. SH
John is already waving for a cab,
They certainly never debrief after the news reports spell disaster, death, and more disaster. They turn off the television set, move it out of sight as they would usually do, and clear their throats, avoiding eye contact. They go to bed with knots in their stomachs and fire in their throats, but they keep it off their tongues, not wanting to vocalise it and make it any more stark than it already is.
“Sorry, what?”
brief
Not really. SH
Sherlock pauses a moment, considering, before fleeing.
“But still.”
PS: I have a mentor now - Julian. He’s quite clever and a very good listener, and I can say without a doubt that he’s helping me in a way I didn’t expect. I wouldn’t have been able to write this letter without him, that much is certain.
“Oh, come on,” Sherlock says, eyes narrowing dangerously. He takes a step forward, crowding into John’s personal space, and not in the welcomed way. “You know me better than that.”
“Fine,” he says, trying to get back up but slipping even more on the wet, muddy grass.
OK. SH
He looks like a hopeless, lost child and it tugs at Sherlock’s heartstrings more than he would ever dare admit, even to himself.
And experiences don’t matter. We’re doing this together. We’ll learn together.
“Sherlock?” John asks, bringing him back to the present.
“What can I do for you?” Mycroft ignores Sherlock’s comments in favour of speeding up the conversation.
“You did,” Sherlock points out.
“Brilliant! I loved it. Can’t wait to read more.” He hands the files over. “I edited in red so that it’s easier for you to see. Of course, I’d be happy to discuss anything you don’t understand.”
“Are you always going to be so demanding when it comes to sex?”
“Might as well plan an around-the-world trip.”
Not that I’ve been counting. SH
John waits two whole days before truly panicking. In complete honesty, it started right after he left Sherlock’s flat, his head filled with Sherlock’s scent and his fingers tickling with the memory of Sherlock’s hair. He doesn’t recognize the first sign of panic right away, and it’s only when he wakes up hard and panting in the middle of the night that he realise what he did exactly.
“Come on now, tell me what you’d like to do.”
“Hmmm,” John replies.
I’ll always want to be with you. Always. Now turn your bloody phone back on so we can argue this out like semi-functioning adults.
“Come on, love, I’m joking. It’s a kid’s movie. It’s supposed to be fun.”
“Why would it - Nevermind. Maybe it wouldn’t. I just don’t want you to think I expect anything in return, yeah?” John says, and he starts to stand up, which makes Sherlock’s heart beat a little too fast for comfort. “I better go fetch Rosie from daycare. It’s getting late.”
“Did it ever occur to you that I might have come here because you weren’t.”
It is to soft kisses left all over his face that John wakes up, not sure exactly how long he managed to sleep.
Bed. SH
“Everything. I see everything.”
While he’s putting his shirt on, his phone rings again.
“Well y-you’ll have to - have to stop -
He can feel Sherlock’s breath against his lips as he replies, “You’re terrified of me?”
“How romantic,” Sherlock replies. “A gentleman, as you put it so well.”
As the weeks passed, the experiments grew more and more frantic, yielding nothing nonetheless. He finally realised that he could not put the world under a microscope, no matter how hard he tried to. Instead of trying more, he hurled his own microscope against the wall of the kitchen, expecting release to come through shattering, catharsis in destruction. Only the slide inside cracked, the rest remaining pitifully intact. Infuriatingly, not even the wall paint had chipped.
“How long must I pay for what I did?” Sherlock bites back. “Is two years not long enough for you?”
“Me too. Our first date.”
Sherlock considers for a moment. He should be able to be honest with John. If they’re to do this properly, it has to start right; right from the beginning. He wants to do this properly so terribly much that he almost aches with it. With all the false starts and, more accurately, never-starts littering their joint past, there’s almost no room to do this by half-measures anymore. He may be choosing his next words carefully, but he still manages to hit send on his next text, and he considers it an accomplishment all the same.
Hi, I’m stuck in traffic. I need to find a job closer to home. This isn’t working anymore. Let me know if you’d like me to pick something up for dinner on the way home.
“No, no. Don’t be ridiculous. Let’s call this what it is, yeah? Love. I’m just surprised, that’s all. But pleasantly so.”
“Nervous?”
John can’t remember the last time he had such a good night’s sleep. He has no doubt it has everything to do with the fact that Sherlock is currently still fast asleep next to him, or that the events of yesterday put some of his worries at bay. Sherlock’s parents had been nothing but kind and open with him, welcoming him back as if his ex murderous wife hadn’t put a bullet in their son, and John had never felt so relieved. He knows he still has a lot to apologise for, and that Sherlock and him have a lot more to talk about, but it’s starting to feel as if they found the right way to safely go there.
“Yes,” he says, steady, “it did.”
“Alright, I’m coming,” John whispers theatrically after toeing on his boots, though he isn’t sure why. Nobody lives there anymore bar the two of them.
“I see,” Sherlock finally says, clearing his throat.
I want to be alright, for you.
“God, you’re beautiful.”
“Why would I feel uncomfortable?”
“I am not sure.”
Tiptoeing on the edge of climax, John slides a hand between them but barely has the time to wrap it around Sherlock before he’s coming and coming. The sight only brings John right where he needs to be, spending himself inside Sherlock while crying out his name. He lands on top of Sherlock, body going pliant.
Sherlock crawls to the empty space next to him and links hands with him, leaning his head on his shoulder.
“Off,” Sherlock demands of John’s clothes, helping him remove them.
“I couldn’t stand to be there and watch you with Mark because of those feelings. I went and had way too many drinks after because of those feelings. I ended up drunk at Baker Street because of those feelings.” He laughs nervously. “I’m fact, you might say I did a lot of stupid things because of those feelings.”
Three months, four days and sixteen hours. And seventeen minutes, to be precise. The last time he spoke to John. It hadn’t even been in person, just a passing phone call to ‘check in,’ as he had so delicately put it. They had spoken for exactly one minute and three seconds before it was over. A capsule of the entirety of their relationship boiled down to just that. Sherlock knew that was the last time they’d speak again. Or thought so, anyway.
“I know,” Sherlock whispers.
you to leave it, and I mean it,” John practically seethes through the phone and hangs up.
John licks at Sherlock’s lips, pulling on it ever so lightly, “Good.”
over and over until the point is beyond made and there’s no questioning anything anymore.
“Oh,” John says, surprised to see him there.
“Sherlock,” John interrupts, “Do you truly think I’d have gotten a bloody tattoo if I didn’t mean forever?”
He stares at him pointedly, waiting patiently for an answer.
Sherlock’s answer gets lost in a moan when John’s lips find his nipple, teasing him for long seconds before moving to the other. Sherlock’s hands are now in his hair, holding tight as if to make sure John won’t move away, which he has no intention of doing anymore. When his own desire becomes too much to bear, John begins to rock their hips together slowly, loving the way Sherlock’s entire body seems to come alive under his.
“Better?” Sherlock asks, his voice still a whisper.
“Here’s one for you,” Sherlock says with a smile, handing him another journal. “A good experiment deserves a good journal.”
“Yes.”
Breathing out slowly, John properly wakes up. He gets to his feet, putting on some pants and allowing himself another second or so before opening the door. Sherlock looks up from the sofa immediately, eyes going from John’s feet to his face before looking back at his book. Not letting that get to him, John moves towards him and leans in for a small kiss on his temple.
“I never said that. All I said was that I’ve asked you not to go. The decision, ultimately, is up to you, of course. God forbid anybody ever ask the great Sherlock Holmes to do something he doesn’t want to do. Nobody has that right, yeah?”
John kissed him on the cheeks, eyes and mouth, peppering his intimacy into the small actions.
Room spinning. SH
And hopefully she will grow used to me when you come home. SH
“Good, good. Now, go on.”
, anyway.
The last push forward could have come from either of them. Sherlock’s hand settles on his nape at the first brush of their lips, hesitant and yet so present. John’s eyes fall shut as he seeks more, learning the shape of Sherlock’s lips with his own. Hot breath meeting in the middle, John finds that he doesn't care whether Sherlock would have tasted the same seven years ago. This right here is exactly what he always craved. In the quietness of a room he made his home, kissing the man he has been desperately in love with for much too long, John learns what it is to belong.
“Okay. Yeah. Sure. I’ll be back at six, okay?”
“I’ll just go upstairs and, uh… See you in the morning, alright?”, John tries to smile. His façade is up, shoulders squared in his soldier’s stance, his chin jutted out in pride. He’s leaving.
She gave him a that’s-a-defence-mechanism-and-you-know-it look. He swallowed.
John looks back at him, not catching on. Sherlock raises his shoulders a little.
‘Of course, you were always there back then. You’d know.’
Sherlock hears her sigh her displeasure at John’s commanding tone.
“She’s- yeah.” John.
She babbles her agreement and glues a chubby finger to one of the grey elephants dotting the navy blue of her baby chair.
It’s so assured and clear-cut it takes him by surprise.
John nodded, scrambling eggs with a wooden spoon, pan tilted and slightly raised from the stove, a tea towel draped over his shoulder.
Always.
She's grown, since last he saw her, swaddled in Molly’s arms and kept away. The old image of her swims in his mind. Sherlock has missed seven months of her life, some of her most crucial developmental stages, where she would slowly gain some independence and begin exploring the world. Missed her first words. Missed getting to know her, as she bloomed -from tiny kitten to lively, curious toddler.
"Going to get her ready"
Sherlock nods. John locks his gaze to his, flickering yellow by the fire. He swallows.
case of a bigoted coward I will ever know, Johnny. Honestly. That’s what you are. And that’s the worst there is. Not one for losing your beard, are you? You can’t even have the decency to make a choice”
Yet, there she was. The connection. Between them. And the world. Life. Peaking out from the covers of their darkness, silent as ever, picking up the moods of grown-ups. His little rose… Wanting to play, to sleep, to eat, to… To hold… No, not him, not her father… She wanted to be held by her spiritual one. Of course… John can see it every day; how she had missed
Afloat.
Thank you for reading! ^^
Worthless. Failing. ‘Right.’
John muffles his pants, face buried in his duvet, teeth biting his sheets. He’s trembling, aching and the night is quiet again. Oh, so quiet he might cry.
He does not mind. He never minded. Not when it was John. Instead of replying, he leans closer, offering his curls to be ruffled gently, combed and smoothed again. ‘I missed you too’ it says, and many other things. It speaks of being seen. Of not being stranded anymore.
She would use even a child she has never met as a pawn in her silly powerplay.
“John, I…” He stops, undecisive. “I am honoured to participate in any memory and experience so important to you.”
“You know very well.”
“You know why I couldn’t-”
His predictions are shattered however by the blinding reality that he faces when he pries the door open with a shoulder.
It strikes right to the point. Stunned silence. Or is that a small grumble? John sighs.
Sherlock hadn’t known but he didn’t seem to mind either. He was apathetic at best. He should have known, damn it. He should have. How could he not? He had everything planned even with his mind shooting up on drugs. It was
“How was your day?”
It’s one thing to not have him close and another to know he doesn’t exist.
“Sure?”
Sherlock frowns; his eyes imperceptibly darker.
If she is surprised, she nonetheless waits.
They walk down the park, stopping casually for Rosie to play here and there. Both wanting to restore her previous mood and stall. Not wanting to end the day short, after all. She falls asleep on John’s chest in the end as they sit under a tree, reading one of her favourite fairy tales. Sherlock doesn’t comment on inaccuracies and soon, clouds start to gather above them, taking the decision for them.
John notices.
“Your brother… I have not seen him around recently. Has he come when I-”
It’s grainy, sand falling through his fingers.
“I stopped.” He breathed. “Yeah, I stopped.”
“It’s okay. We’ll figure it out together. Right?”
Surprisingly, they both look up from their plates at the same time, both thinking about little rose, peaceful in her cot. John smiles and gets blinded. Because Sherlock’s answering smile is small but powerful. Bright like the sun. Or as he would say if ever commented upon:
He takes a step back. ‘Retreat’. His mind is screaming. ‘Run’.
(See the end of the chapter for
He swallowed. It melted away some of the ice, at least at his throat. It was painful, like a bite of half-chewed, forced-down food. He raised his head. Looked over his shoulder
John is his
Sherlock’s chest swirls with greens and oranges.
She blinks, hand still reaching for the dog, then beams up at Sherlock and hides in John’s chest again, shy of his obvious adoration for a moment. Sherlock’s gaze slides down with a puff of breath, petulant to have made her hide again. John chuckles.
If the world is suspended now, like shards of glass before they hit the ground, it’s for an entirely different reason; this was not supposed to happen. John kissing him belongs to the world in his mind. Not the real world. In the real world, it’s not about
Sherlock gets up, reluctant and shaky. John is at his side within seconds reaching for his arm but Sherlock takes it away, straightening up, composed, and walks to his chair, to which he flops down with the elegance he always managed to portray. John looks on with a fond shake of his head. Maybe he hasn’t forgotten how to do this after all. Maybe they haven’t forgotten how to be who they were. Or at least, guide themselves back while going forward. Maybe they can be who they want to be now.
“She needs to take three of those. It’s one and a half for her weight but I don’t want it to spill.” He explains, just to fill the silence and keep Rosie focused on his voice.
“Do you think she’s right?”
“Good morning”.
Sherlock takes a sip instead of replying. How can an orange juice have a rotten purple taste? He does try not to wince, but does make a funny face anyway, which makes John giggle. Sherlock goes on to drink some more, and some more.
It had barely left his lips. As in a nightmare; he couldn’t speak, water flooding in his mouth. The mug had been smashed down against the sink, among the rest of the ruins. John had tried to reach for the jam and more of its red innards emptied onto the tablecloth as John picked it up. A snarled sob ricocheted off the walls, and the jar had been sent flying against the pile.
"Ready?", John smiles as if he had swallowed pebbles, shifting Rosie so that her weight can sit more comfortably on his torso. She whines. "Let's go".
Apparently, John was the only one not aware of the date’s existence. Birthday… Of course, Sherlock would shrug it off. Of course, it wasn’t important. As expected. Why would he care? Did he ever care anyway? Still, the whole affair irked John. He had spent seven bloody years of his life with Sherlock being the centre of it and him being praised of how he was the only one ever to know the detective so well. He would snort at that if he wasn’t drunk, finishing the half-empty bottle hanging from his hand while lingering on the long unwelcome corridor. His daughter upstairs sound asleep.
There is no divide. No wall or ceiling or door or mountain or ocean will ever stand between them anymore. John can’t feel anything of the sort. There are explanations to be made, important matters to talk about from both ends. But John doesn’t feel the rug is being pulled under his feet every time Sherlock is not in the room with him anymore. He woke up feeling as if he had slept beside the man, for goodness’ sake!
It wakes him. He shakes his head. What did just happen?
Sherlock nods. Wonders how John came to know of this place. Who he has come with here before.
“Mm? Yes. Fine.” Sherlock responds hasty, turning to curl the other way towards the mantle.
He nods, vaguely fixating on the comfy chair waiting for him at her patient room. It’s old routine by now, him coming in to a gentle, excited, prompting professional therapist and not saying a word until he sits down. She told him once, when he’d asked, how he usually rushes to the chair when he has something important to say and wants to get it over with, how avoiding the typicalities sometimes makes him an open book and others indicates he’s going to stay silent throughout the session. This time he is determined but yet unsure and nervous; and she knows it.
“Awa?” Rosie reaches a hand perplexed at a certain steep peak of Sherlock’s hair on one side.
“Give him some time.” John speaks softly.
He hears for the stability of John’s breathing, for every sigh or pained moan, for any sign of discomfort or any need.
John gulps for air, snaps his eyes open, pants a little. Sherlock is looking at him, a sharp intensity John can feel to his every bone. His eyes flicker, perplexed. He doesn’t know where this is going. Not yet. But he sees something in John’s eyes, something that makes his widen in surprise. It looks like he’s been searching for it, but not really expecting to find it.
Do not say I did not warn you.
John stops mid-motion, blinking. He must make a quite comical sight himself, with hands full and body frozen halfway through the entrance. But what greets him is just… heart-breaking. And that is Sherlock Holmes, spread over the sofa, with a toddler on his chest, one of his huge palms resting over her back while her little hands have grabbed tightly between her fingers and crumpled the fabric of his dressing gown. Sherlock’s expression is one of pure and utter concentration, his eyes trained on Rosie’s little head, his fingers -John doesn’t doubt- are checking her pulse while his palm feels the quality of her breaths. The always observant man hasn’t even noticed John come through the door. Something that seems quite impossible since his heavy breath and thumping footsteps with carrying all the shopping must have woken even the least sensitive of beings not from only their reverie but their deepest sleep as well.
Sherlock is immobile, eyebrows doing that admirable tremble of joining but retracting at the same time, unsure.
Sherlock doesn’t speak, but he lets his fork down, expectant. John gets a faint impression that if he spoke, it would be breathless.
‘Oh.’ He inhales.
Only it doesn’t.
Sherlock inhales, sharply. But no words come out when he needs them. “I still don’t understand”, his voice sounds like a mouse’s squeak to his ears. He’s so frustrated to be at a loss so grossly that his eyes sting.
He does not have time to ruminate, to ruffle through his memories, because John is speaking again.
Sherlock tries to catch John's gaze, but the deep-sea eyes are looking straight ahead.
knew; John choosing another. John pushing him away. John blaming him, ignoring him, keeping up the wall between them.
It’s time.
“Better?”
They did not do that before. Talk about their past, their families.
He had it. He was asleep and he had it. Peace. There’s an underlying current of it. He can feel it. Almost grasp it through the layers of time and space. All colours of the sunset, rippling, reflecting against waves. An indefinite moment before he woke up. Before his mind switched so swiftly to a reality that prevents him from reaching that state again. Not letting him closer anymore. Frustration pools into his stomach as he washes his face, scratching his bearded chin. He almost had it. The now lost bliss. It’s still there, inches away… Still…
John reaches forward, squeezing Sherlock’s bicep, his eyes never leaving the taller man. The touch makes Sherlock to stop rumbling nervously. John attempts a reassuring smile.
sense.
"We'll just need the Bakerloo line. Three stops and we're there", John says, confidently.
If yes, he didn’t know how he could bare it. There were words, promises, memories... in need of discussion, of explanation. He was patiently preparing himself to face it all. Even when his skin itched for a drop of alcohol. That was his goal. He thought that’s what ‘not easy’ meant. Those upcoming and necessary conversations. But this... An elongated, deep sigh left his lips as he leaned over the sink, supporting himself.
“Good morning.”
“Maybe…” John pauses. “Some tea?”
“Mhm” Sherlock has already started to brush off whatever medical taste has remained on his mouth.
He jumps. He’ll catch him. He
He is still awed that there is so much trust and faith placed upon his shoulders. That his opinion, with regards to the issues concerning Honeybee, matters so to John. And he is still giddy over what happened at the therapist’s office. The very specific thing.
Sherlock is frozen in space and John wishes he could be frozen in time. The hairs prickle his fingertips and he wants to feel them again. And again. He wants to touch. Touch. Touch.
“Oh, god.”
John’s jaw muscles clench. “But the… mail, yesterday. I presume he..?”
Said John smiles at the memory.
Rosie is looking, curious, holding herself up by her cot’s bars. Then giggles. John doesn’t remember when he last felt such bliss. He smiles at her, wholeheartedly, and strives to hold her up, cradle her on an elbow, blow a raspberry on her rosy cheek; pleasantly cool.
“Start with what happened, John.” A small reminder sounded.
But even if John’s initiative can be brushed away, for Sherlock the offence is in his nature. Written into every tiny helix of every cell in his body. And breathing in every beat of the treacherous hole in his chest. He wants to cower away, hide.
John notices the lack of another deduction but shrugs it off, determined to have a good night. He takes it as a silent invitation and proceeds to talk Sherlock through everything he knows of this year’s season, blabbing until the next song and laughing in between. There is no other deduction talk other than what John tries and fails to guess, Sherlock only raising a playful eyebrow here and there. John doesn’t mind, but is determined to get to the bottom of this soon.
Not even relief can pierce through the fog that has condensed around his mind. “Y-yes”
He nodded. Curtly. He didn’t like thinking of it that way.
One, two, three steps and he’s inside again. Eyes fixed on Sherlock’s slumped figure over the sink. A piece of paper in his hand, the other pulling back from the sink in a tremble. Red staining the tender part of his palm.
Something freezes.
We are dealing, again, with some difficult themes in this chapter (mainly depression-anxiety). As always, please heed the tags.
“I pushed too far…”
“Just…” A stuttering breath. “If I take my eyes off her she’s going to disappear...” The addition causes his shoulders to fall. Apologetic. Again.
Sherlock’s tongue had gone slack in his mouth.
But there was one detail. One detail that changed everything, whose cognitive dissonance was so loud it echoed through his mind, bouncing from one skull bone to the next.
“Christ.” He mutters out loud.
He doesn’t know. He has absolutely no idea.
A whole morning with Sherlock then. It’s the best he can do not the smirk and rub his palms together in delight. They’ve spent almost all weekend together and John still hasn’t had his fill. As always. He never will.
John erupts, struggling to keep his voice low. Sherlock’s left hand clenches into a fist.
Then, springs into action. It doesn’t matter if he fails. Sherlock needs him so John is going to try. His palm slides under a warm cheek. Sherlock’s untrimmed stubble grazes over John’s skin and he stops. He waits, letting the sweat seep into his pores, suddenly in awe. Then he moves, with fervour, getting his arm under Sherlock’s neck and shoulders. Sherlock barely shifts, turning on his back just by the gentle force of John’s arms.
At least it had been the right thing to do.
A new wave of strength comes over him and he takes her in his arms again, cradling her as slow as he can manage.
John clears his throat, takes a sip. Tries to sit more comfortably, changes his mind, crosses his legs the other way. Drums his fingers on the table-top and clears his throat again.
“Technically-”
“Just checking.”
“Oh, there’s a happy face I hoped to see!” Greg Lestrade says, reaching the top of the stairs, Rosie visible to him by the propped open door.
Of course, I do… What else can I do?’
This was a world where Sherlock didn’t dare to touch or speak, approach or even glance at John without being asked. A world where John put up walls around himself to manage. Cope. Avoid and not care. Even if they had touched, they had embraced, they had soothed each other’s souls… Just for a moment… Maybe that could happen again… No. That was something else. That moment in the sea of many existed only because, as always, his-damned-self decided to make the problem his own and start crying. Selfish.
John enters 221 quietly. Long shift.
John’s eyes rise to his face, again, but the ascend is slow, as if he needs to gather courage for every centimeter up.
He would still have the albums in vinyl if it wasn’t for-... Anyway… Collective editions they were. If he could have them again, pass his hands over the carved round plaque. Terrible and thrilling reminders in equal parts, transporting him to those years before the army, when he believed himself to be free, breaking through stereotype and the masses. It’s a pity he doesn’t have a record player now, otherwise he’d buy them all, find them from scratch again.
“I don’t
Never asking. Not objecting. Welcoming but not seeking.
John shakes his head ruefully. Sherlock’s tilts to the side in confusion. Why is John so upset by the thought of him being alone?
“Sherlock?” he mumbled, unsure.
Sherlock jolts awake, his breaths sharp knives into his lungs. He does not want to recall the jumbled images he saw, and thankfully they are already receding from the forefront of his mind, carried away with the tide that leaves behind a rapid heartrate and a constant sense of fear. He blinks, trying to bat away the darkness, and collects his knees to his chest, hugs them close with arms that are like empty logs. He preferred the void. He so preferred the void.
“Yeah?”
We hope you enjoy with all your hearts. <3
“We, um… I read Rosie the book you gave me yesterday”
And he wasn’t about to blow it. Which meant he had to be careful. Very, very careful.
“Not well.” He knows Sherlock can see it too. No need to lie.
Sherlock steps into the tub. The water engulfs his legs, greedy. Whispering. He swallows. It feels like it is challenging him. Taunting him. Why is he afraid of forty centimetres of it, of breath-stealing, treacherous water?
He knows they are risking it, but in all honesty, he can never deny the man anything. He’s still worried and he’ll come down to make sure Sherlock is well fed and hydrated and cared for and in bed after she’s settled upstairs, but he can’t deny him this.
Sherlock’s eyes snap up. John’s hands are over the baby monitor, pointing. It’s a spell. Breaking.
He expected a snort, of his fears being dismissed as ridiculous, a flick of a hand or a scowl. None comes.
Of course, the lightness of limbs was concerning but he had forgotten it. Until there was a slash through what he presumed was his dream’s sky and the world was lit.
It wasn’t like this. No. It wasn’t like this.
"Morning". It's clipped but barely above the level of a whisper. Impatient, but unsure, too.
Sherlock whines in petulant protest against John’s chest. ‘Not thinking’.
‘Why me, why now, why me, why now’- “No, no no, shh, hush, baby, please…”
With practised movements, Sherlock fills the kettle, flicks it on, fetches two mugs, the sugar, the milk. Routines help. They’re all he has in the place of a mind that could deduce, predict. Having a predictable life is all that keeps him on the surface. Small routines. Small steps. Reliable.
“You won’t.”
The elegant thin violinist fingers open, a tad, and a tad more. John carefully shines the light of a tiny flashlight on the wound, holding it between his teeth. There is only one big piece of glass still in there as far as he can see, no other tiny ones shining around. Good. Sturdy glass of water. He removes the flashlight, searches Sherlock’s eyes.
“Come here, sweetheart. There we go. You’ll have your elephant soon enough.” His lips rest on her temple as he lifts her up, gentle always. She stays silent, sighing into his shoulder.
She offers a hand and John takes it, shaking it once, firmly. He has stepped closer to Sherlock by instinct and now Sherlock’s looking at him, waiting for a signal John knows he should give, but doesn’t know what for. Was he being territorial? Not giving Sherlock space to stand? He just wanted to assess the situation first…
“Mm, we’ll have to wait and see, won’t we?” John steals a glance at Sherlock, conspiratorial.
Sherlock looks at him. Blankly, for a moment. John’s chest constricts because he knows that look. It’s all Sherlock. Sherlock trying to control himself, hide something. Is it anger? Disappointment? He sees the black curls fall around the so well-known face, sees the genuine attempt to say what needs to be said and John just can’t let him.
‘And just how much does that matter?’
John is looking at
They are together in this now, in this struggle to mend. But there is no guarantee what will happen after. Camaraderie and friendly loyalty are hardly a life’s commitment.
“More like a pirate ship, innit?” He thinks out loud as she pokes his hand with her spoon, glancing up at his best friend.
“We must have set a record” John snorts as he leads the way out of the bathroom and into the kitchen. Honeybee begins to mouth at the lapel of Sherlock’s dressing gown.
John moans again; loudly. Sherlock frowns, and then his eyes widen, only for a moment. He is quick to look away, recomposing himself almost -why and for what John does not know-, and ask “You like it that much?” with trepidation.
It’s pleasant. Sitting everyday together. Homely. Spreading warmth through John’s chest. He would never give this up for the world. He wishes everyday is exactly like this. He knows it will be soon. They’ll work on it. They are working on it. He believes in it.
Sherlock instinctively touches a hand to his face, feels the roughened surface of his cheeks.
“Yes”
“You too.”
I know we promised better things coming, but honestly... our boys have a long way to go. So here is a mix of fluff with pain <3 Enjoy!
“You’re already taking too many tablets, Sherlock. Of any kind”
A door is opened and John has half the mind to let Sherlock go through first, his hand outstretched behind him; instinct in case his friend needs a gentle nudge. Where were the times John was trying to catch up? The times Sherlock always strode forward in exhilaration?
“Yes?” John is alerted at once.
John turns around, then. Slowly, his eyes narrowed in surprise, perhaps in a newly-found discovery. Sherlock greets him with a small smile of his eyes. “What about the other things?”
“It’s not- No, it’s not that.” John bit his lip.
“Mmm”
and it’s
She huffs. So like Father. ‘Yeah, right. You wish.’ He can keep his mouth shut. That’s one thing she could never do.
It takes about ten minutes more of John trying to steady her enough to clean her properly. She gives in eventually, exhausted. She’s sniffling and avoiding his gaze. Avoiding the whole of him in fact. He gives one or two last attempts to ease her sulking by playing with the duck and throwing around some bubbles but they’re half-hearted. He knows he can’t do her any good.
Rosie coos to her duck and has it dive under the water and then splash about.
“I suppose it baffles me…”
“It is your gift.”
“Was it Rosie’s appointment?”
Sherlock’s breath hitches. Imperceptible but the tiled walls catch it and echo it all over. John averts his gaze.
“She didn’t want it either but does that make it alright?” His fingers curling up in his hair, tightening around tufts and bite the skin, blocking the sob inside his chest. Guilt clogging up his throat.
Much, much, too much to resolve. He snaps the phone closed and turns around.
Sherlock begins to wash his teeth; then brushes his curls; changes into pyjamas. He always lets John use the bathroom first for the night, after dinner. As he straightens to put his white tee on, he catches his reflection in the mirror. Pauses. He had trimmed -more than shaved- a few days ago. Now his face looks ragged, his cheekbones stretching his skin and casting oblong shadows over the valleys of his face. Even his temple bones protrude just that little too much. His complexion is an unhealthy pale, that hue which chronic illness or abuse can leave behind. His hair has not thinned, but the now longer curls have lost a lot of their once natural shine, spilling off light rather than absorbing it.
His eyes take in Sherlock’s form, standing at the doorway, striped pyjamas and silken robe on, pale eyes fixed wide on the heap of breakfast at the kitchen table.
“Sherlock? Was just wrapping things up with Ella” He sounds calm, casual, even. Oh god, how is he going to tell him? “Is everything okay?”
“It just set me off. The way she stood there. Watching. Her world was crushing down on her. I saw it in her eyes. I made her feel it.” He bites his lip to not let a sob fall out.
He reaches for the fridge again, hurrying about. Sherlock doesn’t speak. John bites his lip. He turns with the milk in one hand, takes the sippy-cup from the counter with the other and looks right to Sherlock.
“If it helps, I don’t think you are anything other than John Watson”
“John.”
He had watched him go, watched him run as if he were hunted. Sherlock had watched and every nerve in him had shrank away from his muscles and bones, so that he was only eyes on a statue. He had wanted to reach for him. To make him stop.
John holds up the brown leaf, and then leaves it on the saucer of his cup, grin all green and dashing and show-off. Sherlock’s tongue has turned into a leathery stone.
He’s been in love forever.
But this was different.
“John”, Sherlock says again in appeasement, stilling mid-motion. He waits until John’s gaze falls, and then reaches for him again.
Their gazes catch and John smiles. ‘I should have known.’ He smiles. Despite it all. A small tremble at the corners of lips.
“I joined a support group”, John blurts out. “For the…” He stops with a sigh, as if something were holding him back. “Might as well name it. We’re not children after all”, he murmurs. “The alcohol issue”
“It really is,” John says, leaning closer to steal a kiss.
Sherlock nods, apparently too lost for words already. John doesn’t waste any time lubing himself, and pushes in as slowly as he can, eyes fixed on Sherlock’s wide open ones. They don’t break eye contact for the first few thrusts, but the moment John finds his prostate, Sherlock’s entire body arches on the bed, pushing John even further inside him. After that, all control is a lost cause. John can only push in and out, focusing on every sound coming out of Sherlock’s mouth, desperately trying to hold back his orgasm.
John, I’m sorry. You didn’t need to storm off like that, but I am sorry. Text me back. Calling Molly to see if you’re with her.
“Easy, love, your appointment is only for noon. No need to rush,” John says, finishing with Sherlock’s scarf and smoothing his hands down the sides of his arms in a now-familiar gesture that means
Sherlock chuckles, their noses bumping together. “Or two.”
“Yeah, well, you don’t know everything about me.”
“Can I…” Sherlock starts, eyes searching. “How do I know if I can kiss you?”
“Oh for goodness…”
“I was supposed to get clean,” he says.
“Would a kiss make it better.”
“I can assure you they don’t,” Sherlock says, taking his hand and holding it tight. “They are going to be delighted to hear about this.”
“That’s all I wanted to say, really. That’s almost all of it, I reckon. I have to go now,” he chokes out on a whisper, voice too unsteady to trust.
Sherlock isn’t sure what to do with his hands now that they’re face-to-face. He should probably move aside and let John in or he should grab his coat so that they can leave, but he’s paralysed by the indecision of it. As though this one minute detail would make any bit of difference. The problem is, in his mind, every move he makes could be the contrast between a great evening and a lousy one. He wants to control for every single element in order to ensure that things run as smoothly as possible, without any surprises other than the one he knows he’s bound to feel later on, when John finally takes him to bed.
Well. SH
“I told myself I needed to stop, after the first time I showed up. I felt like a complete idiot the next morning. Felt so ashamed that I swore to myself I would throw away all the bottles in my flat. And I did. Not a single drink for a long time after that, and then… well, then I only needed to find an open pub.”
“...”
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sherlock move and groan lightly. Anybody else might mistake it for normal sleep, but John knows better. In the months that they’ve been - whatever it is they are - and, actually, all the months before that, John has come to know the intricacies of a sleeping Sherlock Holmes. And a sleeping Sherlock Holmes doesn’t move or make sounds. He sleeps like the dead, when he does it at all. John isn’t a consulting detective, but he can certainly deduce what’s going on, even before Sherlock starts thrashing a bit more violently and his groans become louder and more desperate. Before John has crossed the room, Sherlock has woken himself up with a yelled, “
“It’s alright,” John smiles. “We better get used to this; lots of people are going to react the same way.”
“Can I have a kiss?” John asks too-casually, pocketing his keys. As though he even has to ask.
“We can have sex with clothes if you prefer,” Sherlock offers. “But afterwards, can I see you naked?”
“Anyway,” he continues, not wanting to delve too deep into it right then, “It does help, having someone to wake up next to.”
In two long strides, he goes to stand next to him, immediately seeking warmth by pressing himself against his side. He doesn’t say anything about the cigarette, nor the sudden trip to the rooftop in the middle of the night. In fact, John doesn’t say anything at all. He simply remains there, close enough to be able to follow Sherlock’s breathing. Silence stretches around them, like a comfortable blanket on both their shoulders.
I bloody love you, Sherlock Holmes, and right now, I hate this ache spreading throughout my entire chest just thinking about what your silence could mean.
(...)
“How about,” John murmurs, low and dangerous, “I take you apart right here in this chair? In
John slowly, painstakingly unbuttons Sherlock’s shirt and lets it hang open, kissing down his chest, over his scar, down to his belly-button and all the way back up again, claiming his mouth in a move that feels more conquering than not. Sherlock feels
So much. SH
I still have so many questions.
John reaches under the table and rests his hand on Sherlock’s thigh, stroking the inside seam with his fingertips, sending little shivers through Sherlock’s stomach and chest. He looks John directly in the eyes, sensing more than deducing the shift and his mind flashes to
“Alright,” he says, straightening his jacket and reaching for the door handle. He gives Sherlock one more heated look before opening the front door and going to Mrs Hudson’s to collect Rosie. Sherlock follows him in a daze, and he feels like the epitome of a lovesick fool, but he can’t find a single drop of him deems it necessary to care.
He rolls his onto his back, ready to put his phone back down but then opens his texts once more.
“I love you,” Sherlock breathes out.
“Look,” he says after Sherlock tries to escape him again. “You can pet lion cubs.”
“Of course you’re getting a gift,” he says, taking a step closer. “But I’m not telling you anything about it.”
Sherlock deletes it, albeit after reading it fourteen times.
Sherlock has been planning their evening for the past two days, ever since the clinic had called and asked for John to come in today really. Getting Mrs Hudson to babysit Rosie had been easy, more than easy in fact, and she had come to get her a few hours ago, rambling about all they were going to do between girls.
New love and all. SH
“Sherlock,” John whispers, just as quiet. “Why are we here? Why aren’t you asleep?”
John closes his eyes, sighing, “I…” He stops, leaning into Sherlock’s touch and hating the knot in his chest. “The clinic from yesterday called me earlier, they have a job for me.”

“Obviously. Yes. Thank you.”
“Sherlock,” he calls, turning around without meeting his eyes. “I just realised I have… somewhere to be.”
“You do realise you chasing me here is one of the most romantic tropes in movies?”
He’s not sure who moves first, probably him, and soon he’s close enough to feel Sherlock’s breath against his mouth. His head might be spinning just a little. He leans in, heart pounding against his chest, only to pull back immediately. He can’t just kiss Sherlock, he needs to make sure, needs to be certain he also wa —
OK. SH
“I okay,” Mike smiles. “I’m used to it, even if it’s been a while, I have to say.”
John is silent, patient. Where Sherlock was maddened energy, he was always able to lay in wait, a lioness waiting for her moment to strike.
Sherlock hums his agreement, going into Mark’s office and aiming for the chair immediately. John waits by the door, looking around the room and taking it all in. That’s one of the first things Sherlock taught him actually, looking for clues in the details. He walks to the bookcase, looking closely at the different pictures of Mark all around the world. He’s just about to ask about what seems to be Nepal, turning around and stopping dead in his tracks.
Sherlock stares at him for a long second, something strange in his eyes, and John finds himself turning his back to him. Suddenly very much aware of his own state of undress, his old pair of boxers feeling much shorter than usual, he’s glad to have a way to hide his embarrassment.
He looks up at John, whose eyes are transfixed by the needle tattooing his chest. He has a small, almost imperceptible smile on the side of his mouth and he suddenly looks at Sherlock as though he knows he was looking at him and Sherlock knows, without a shadow of a doubt that John is all his, too, as much as he is John’s.
“I’m not drinking tonight,” John replies.
“I think we both know what it means. Let’s not drag this out further than needed.” He crosses his arms, punctuating his point, and Sherlock wants to wipe the smug look right off his thin lips.
“It’s about me?”
“I’m going to kiss you.”
Please, trust me too.
The rest of the meal goes both very quickly and too slow at the same time. John lets in all sink in, feeling for the first time in a really long time as though he belongs. Sherlock, who obviously is reading it all on his face, spends most of the afternoon making sure he’s alright, and John loves him even more.
I wanted to tell you for so long, Sherlock.
“It’s been a while,” John adds, hating how he apparently needs to justify himself. “What about the two women over there?”
He had taken care of ordering in a late brunch, getting everything ready in the small kitchen. Sherlock had surprised him, silently walking in while he was setting the dishes on the table, and John had looked up to find him already very close. Kissing him had been the most obvious option and, really, it seemed Sherlock had more than agreed.
took care of your cuts and wounds, case after case.
“What?” Sherlock asks.
“...”
“Boring,” Sherlock sighs, going back to kiss his neck.
It does take them another thirty minutes to get out of bed but, with Sherlock’s efficient method of packing, they end up at the airport with just enough time to relax before the flight. They find their gate quickly, John unable to stop himself from looking around and poking Sherlock in the side.
Any time, John. SH
John’s voice is reduced to a murmur as he asks, “You did?”
They both have their legs crossed in the other’s direction, the body language laughably simple and telling, but their mouths still struggling to communicate. Sherlock, especially, finds that his jaw has been temporarily wired shut.
“Sherlock, love, stop,” John cuts him off, cupping his head and stroking his cheeks slowly. “I know you trust me, just like I know there are some things we can’t control. I shouldn’t have stayed with Julian, it was a bad idea from the start, and I’m sorry.”
“I’m not saying it’ll be easy,” John continues. “I know I still will be wondering whether I’m doing things right, or if this or that could hurt you, but I’m going to try and remember this moment right there every time I find myself doubting. I’ll remember how you kissed me and how you told me that you love me for the first time, and maybe it’ll be easier to trust that you know just how much I love you.”
John wakes up with a startle, heart pounding and breath short. He waits for the usual pain in his leg or shoulder following a nightmare, but nothing comes. In fact, he can’t remember exactly what he was dreaming about. He looks around the room, taking in the familiar furniture and scent, his eyes dropping to the empty space next to him. Oh. That’s it, then.
“I shouldn’t have, I’m sorry.”
“I love you,” he breathes into a kiss. “I love you.”

Thank you to everyone who followed along on this ride with us - we loved writing it as much as you loved reading it. Thank you for the kudos, comments and follows.
Sherlock nods and with another kiss walks to the bathroom.
“Of course. Always,” John whispers, tilting Sherlock’s chin up to offer a light kiss on his mouth.
Thank you for last night. It was. Good. And the thing you said. The thing about you… me… that was… also good. Very good… I… you too. Very much.

What is Ted’s surname? SH
“And you’re going to marry me,” Sherlock whispers back, grinning.
“I’ll go check that out,” John says, needing a break to regain some composure anyway.
“Johnnnn,” Sherlock whines, head thrown back already.
