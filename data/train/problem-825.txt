What I’m proposing here is that whilst we’ve thought about this quote quite a lot, we’ve always focused on the first half – that Sherlock Holmes is a homosexual – and not the second, which is that that’s the reason he’s on dope. We talk a bit about Sherlock being upset in HLV about John’s marriage and that being why he turns back to drugs, and likewise when TAB first aired a lot of people (myself included) thought he was ODing because he wasn’t going to see John again. I now think – and will provide evidence through the meta! – that it isn’t his feelings of (seemingly) unrequited love which are sending him to drugs, nor that the EMP is a place where he’s discovering his feelings – my meta here
And so we move to Sherlock relentlessly texting through the birth, through the christening – horrible, ooc behaviour for him if we think back to how emotional he was at the wedding. Importantly, this behaviour is all tied up with his obsessive Tweeting, which in turn links in to how the outside world (i.e. us) perceive Sherlock – is this the Sherlock that people want to see on screen? Doesn’t he feel wrong? Sure, there’s an element of self-critique in there from Mofftiss, but the incorporation of the phone obsession leaves the blame squarely with the audience. In case we couldn’t already feel that Sherlock’s character is way off, we have his Siri loudly say that she can’t understand him.
John pulled away, and Sherlock saw his eyes were glistening. It was a moment before he remembered why – Rosie’s first word. Of course. A sense of guilt began to percolate in his stomach – this was a moment for parents. He thought of Mary. She should be the one here, sharing Rosie’s achievement with John, not him.
For the sake of splitting this meta up to make it readable, I’m going to call time on this half of TST, and we’ll pick it up tomorrow at Jack Sandiford’s house. (Also I don’t know how much text tumblr allows and this is a
Others have explained why Norbury is a mirror for Mary – if we hadn’t already spotted the Lady Smallwood connection, there’s the fact that they are both receptionists, that they use the exact same gun and of course that they both attempt to kill Sherlock to protect themselves. When we read this scene, we should be reading it in the same way it has become completely mainstream to read Ricoletti as Moriarty; Norbury is Mary. She thought she could outrun the inevitable, but somebody has information on her. What happened with AGRA isn’t actually relevant here, because that was all hypothesis – Magnussen has something, and that’s all that matters. Norbury’s wish to get out of criminal mess in favour of domesticity matches Mary’s, seemingly – and in case we didn’t get this parallel, Norbury draws it herself, asking Mary if they don’t just want the same thing.
John’s first Christmas without Mary. Rosie’s first Christmas at all. Sherlock had been marking off the days in his mental calendar, knowing that this day would come and all of the trappings associated with it. ‘Tis the season. Trees. Decorations. Advent calendars, though he supposed Rosie was too small for a chocolate one. He wondered whether she should have a picture one, although John was not particularly religious; she had been baptised, after all.
century specifically to deal with the consequences of his romantic and sexual feelings. There’s a parallel here with Mofftiss time jumping; back when they made A Study in Twink in 2009, there was a reason they made the time jump. Having Sherlock’s psyche have that touch of self-awareness helps to illustrate why they made a similar jump, also dealing with the weight of previous adaptations.
. Plenty of people have worked on queering the Holmes canon and working out what ACD might have been implying and leaving out and arguably none more so in an adaptation that Mofftiss. Let’s think about the implications of this. A kind of second self, not shown to the public, buried inside your mind and forgotten since childhood, which is bursting out into a moment of acute psychological distress. Gee, I don’t know what that could be about. The Sherlock that Sherlock thinks he is has thus far been dominated by MP!Mycroft, but this series is about uniting canon!Holmes with the non-canon, queer Sherrinford who has
“John – ever since I met you – life has been… different. Um…” He wasn’t explaining this very well – he was never normally lost for words, and was struggling with the new experience. “John – when you kissed my head, last night –“
Taking a jump back to surface level plot here, the first thing that grabbed me about E!Eurus was just how minor John’s flirtation with her was. In the terms of a television show which really rides on very high drama (multiple faked deaths and insane cliffhangers for a start), the emotional peak of John’s emotional arc with Mary being that he texted another woman – not went out for lunch, not kissed, not slept with – is bizarre, particularly when we know next to nothing about E!Eurus at this point. It’s incredibly anti-climactic as a means of John falling short of Mary’s view of him. Maybe we can accept it as in line with John Moral-Principles Watson, but it’s difficult to accept as in keeping with the nature of a show whose intent is nearly always to shock.
“I’m going to assume you meant that generously,” Sherlock said drily. “The last time somebody called me that, I narrowly avoided getting punched.”
) how the Victorian costume and the continued use of the deerstalker in the present day are images of Sherlock’s public façade and exclusion of queerness from his identity. It’s true that pretty much every Holmes adaptation has used the deerstalker, but the strong Rathbone vibes that come from Ben’s TAB costume ties the 1895 vibe very strongly into Rathbone. To have the final scene – and hopefully exit from the EMP – tie in with Sherlock and John running
Janine being a symbol here helps me to make sense of the couple of lines that didn’t make sense to me otherwise. If Janine were real, getting rid of the bees would be awful – she gets the future our boys want and she destroys it. But if she’s a symbol in Sherlock’s mind of that bearding, and a barrier to waking up and saving John, then her sitting there, pushing him back into a coma and tearing away the future he longs for – that makes a lot of sense, and is 100% more devastating. The other line that has never made sense to me is Janine telling Sherlock that he could have just been honest with her, that she knows what kind of man he is.
When he looked back, of course, that was not the real reason. The flat had too many memories; everywhere he looked, he could not help but see Mary’s shape, just out of reach, in the corner of his eye. He had thought that was normal, but although he still saw her sometimes, leaving the flat had helped. She was no longer omnipresent. He had not wanted to raise Rosie in a home that constricted his chest, that made him feel like he couldn’t breathe when he walked into the nursery that he had painted with her. With Mary. He had not wanted that.
Before digging into the episode, I want to take a brief diversion to talk about one of my favourite films,
His drunken actions had complicated his plan of action. A confession and a proposition would now turn into a confession and an apology. But Sherlock was the most observant man in Britain, if not further afield; it would be an insult to act as though Sherlock had not apprehended his intentions. Better to be honest and part amicably. It had been nice while it lasted.
John gulped slightly. Sherlock felt all the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. John Watson was never lost for words. Sherlock looked to his deep brown eyes, the eyes which he normally avoided because always caused that slight familiar pang in his chest, and met John’s gaze. John seemed to lose his nerve somehow, taking half a step back from Sherlock and breaking their eye contact.
) – essentially, Charlie and Carl Powers from TGG are mirrors for one another both in their names and in the manner they die (a fit in a tight place, basically). Carl Powers is already a mirror for Sherlock – obsessively targeted by Jim for being the best at what he does. Charlie mirrors Sherlock through their shared trip to Tibet (dreamscape alert) and, we think, through the metatextual link of the blue power ranger. In case you hadn’t spotted it, Powers links back to that too – probably coincidence, but a nice one nevertheless. Carl Powers’s death is by drowning, which we shouldn’t ignore in an episode as loaded with ideas about drowning in the mind palace. The fact that the mirror reflects drowning Baker Street aesthetics should make us think that Charlie is asking us to reflect on Carl Powers’s death, but also on Sherlock’s own – already fatally injured (by a fit or by Mary), he is going to die smothered, unable to cry for help (in a swimming pool/carseat costume (?!)/mind palace). The idea that none of these people could cry for help is particularly poignant because so much of series 4 is about Sherlock being unable to voice his own identity, and as we’ll see once he’s able to do that, that may give him the impetus to escape his death. Think of ‘John Watson is definitely in danger’ back in HLV.
Ever since returning from his parents, it was as though Sherlock had been under a black cloud. John could not understand it. John had been surprised when Sherlock had asked him down to the cottage; he did not know whether it had been Sherlock or his parents who had extended the invitation, but its existence caused a flutter in his stomach, nerves he had not felt around the Holmes family before. It had felt like something almost incipient. The first Christmas – because John could not count the fiasco that was the previous year – of many.
Mycroft. The smoking scene in HLV. If we wanted to, we could jump back to Sir Boastalot as well, but the original ‘dragon slayer’ quote happens when Mary is nowhere around. There isn’t a way to make this callback work without either saying it’s a ‘coincidence’ (really?) or postulating some sort of dreamscape. Here, the dreamscape works perfectly, because it’s the hero image that Sherlock is working to break in this episode, and these iterations come first from his brain (Mycroft) and secondly from hypothesis Mary – even as he’s trying to crack her in various versions in his mind, his subconscious is warning him that he’s wrong. We moved from supervillain Mary to Mary-who-needs-protecting; neither of these are particularly relevant.
seen a room partitioned like this, and nor has anyone I’ve shown the image to – again, it draws attention to itself. If the creative team had wanted us to take this scene at face value, they would have put Ella in an office. This is not a psychiatrist’s office. The partitions mean that it isn’t even private.
He closed the laptop. He would need to talk to Sherlock about it, of course. It wasn’t fair to impose an infant on anyone for too long. But maybe – just maybe – he could stay at Baker Street for a little longer.
The room had taken on a pleasant haze in the minutes since John had drunk it. He was not drunk, merely in that pleasant between-state, where the world seemed to curve around his perspective. He felt warm and vaguely cosy, although it was a cold December evening.
The first thing Sherlock does after being pushed under by Janine is go and interrogate who Mary is in his brain, whilst also working out her impact on John. Sherlock comes up with a pretty reasonable background for who she is in the Leinster Gardens scene, but this isn’t really what’s important – it's the
. It’s about a gay love affair that ends in one participant killing the other. Take from that what you will, when John’s extramarital affection is making him suicidal and Sherlock comatose. Meanwhile, the title of
A note here: most of the time in EMP theory, I think John represents Sherlock’s heart, and I try to refer to John as heart!John as much as possible when that’s the case. There are a few cases which are different, but most notable are when the blog comes up – then John becomes John the blogger, and our symbolism shifts over to the repressive features of the original stories and how that’s playing out in the modern world. Although a pain to analyse sometimes, I find it incredibly neat that the two of them are bound up in John as source of both love and pain, which fits our story beautifully.
Despite John having been at Baker Street for several months now, they had not found a rhythm like they used to. This was down to Rosie, Sherlock supposed. Before, Sherlock and John had been a unit, not a romantic one, but a unit nevertheless. Now, so many years later, John and Rosie were a family unit, and Sherlock was – what? He did not know. He loved Rosie with all his heart, more than he had ever imagined he would, but was careful with his affection when John was around. He did not want to seem as though he was usurping a role that was not his.
bears to HLV, but Mofftiss do draw attention to it – and there is something interesting about the criminal being revealed by Holmes only after the criminal thinks they’ve killed him.
is the defining film in terms of the navigating-the-surreal-psyche subgenre, and so the structural parallels between the two are significant – and definitely point to the idea that Sherlock hasn’t woken up at the end of TAB, which is important. But we don’t need to take this parallel as evidence; there’s plenty of that in the episode itself. Let’s jump in.
The excuse about Mrs. Hudson suddenly felt paltry, not to mention unnecessary. Sherlock nodded, desperately aware of the colour in his cheeks. “For Rosie,” he added belatedly, hurriedly.
If the Doctor and Sherlock are mirrors, Amy as the Doctor’s companion should be linked to John. Amy ran away on the night before her wedding, and whilst she is reasonably happy with Rory in the long term of the series, this episode is about her making the decision between domesticity and adventure – a pretty clear link to John in s3 and 4. This episode is particularly important for TST however, because Amy is heavily pregnant in the domestic dream – but she is far from enthused, torn between domestic life with Rory and wanting to run off with the Doctor. However, I grant the similarity with Martin Freeman isn’t striking.
“Sorry,” Sherlock murmured, pulling his hand back from Rosie’s head, and John saw the usual guardedness fall back into his eyes, eyes which had just moments ago been so vulnerable in their loving gaze.
– and it’s vital here in linking our real Sherlock back to the stories, as though to say that he is hidden in there somewhere.
The exception, of course, is Ella’s office, which ties into the heaven/ascent theme – it seems as though descent is descent into drowning in thought, but it’s not actually death, whereas death is the abandonment of the EMP project all together, letting it all go to rise up to the sky. I’ve discussed the ascent metaphor in a previous chapter (
New paragraph – spoilers gone. Moments where the perspective was actually subjective and we missed it or forgot it are great rug pulls, because the clues are there but we don’t spot them. We love a good unreliable narrator. This isn’t the case here. The plane scene, as visualised, exists only inside Eurus’s head. Eurus is emphatically not our narrator during TFP, so when it comes out that the girl on the plane isn’t real, we just feel lied to.
The final thing I want to focus on in this episode, though, is the east wind. The east wind is referenced in
Sherlock was immersed in Gray’s Anatomy when he detected the change in John’s voice. John spoke to Sherlock frequently when he was reading, and Sherlock filtered much of it out. Often it was nonsense, conversation for the sake of it, and he suspected that John was grateful for Sherlock’s judicious choice of what to respond to. Theirs was a friendship that throve on a mutual, comfortable silence, after all. But this time John spoke, his voice was different somehow.
“No. I liked it.” He saw the breath catch in John’s throat, could feel himself flushing a deep beetroot. “And that’s the problem, I think. I liked it and I like you – the way I’ve always liked you. And I thought we could make it work – I thought I could live with you, like we did before. But last night, I realised – it’s unfair. It’s unfair on you – and it’s totally unfair on me.” He took a deep breath. “I’m in love with you, John, and I have been since we met.”
And then John. Last Christmas, the gifts he and John had exchanged had been meagre, impersonal. On John’s part, Sherlock had deduced an awkwardness; Sherlock had been shot by Mary, and caught in these divided loyalties, trying to figure the whole damn thing out, John’s present had betrayed his distraction. Christmas generally had been lacklustre on that front, at least until Billy and Sherlock had drugged most members of the gathering. Sherlock’s gift to John had been equally impersonal that year; it could conceivably have been attributed to the same distractedness as John’s, but it had not been. It had been a deliberate distancing of himself from the unhappy couple. Sherlock had known from the moment he left the wedding early that it had to happen, and his relapse shortly after had only proven it to himself. He could not function seeing John like that every day. Not just unhappy; this had been long before Mary had shot Sherlock. Married.
feature Amy’s child, and in both cases the plot revolves around the emotional recognition that that world isn’t real. Given that we know that Amy is a John mirror, and that her choice between the domestic and the adventurous is consistently paralleled to John’s choice in
What, then, is going on here? Sherlock is told by MP!Jim that John is in danger – and then imagines he wakes up. In his MP, Janine appears, puts him in pain and puts him back under. She, then, is the reason he can’t wake up. Janine has been Sherlock’s beard, and it’s quite possible to read her as being a symbol of Sherlock’s repression, but I think that’s a simplification; discounting TAB, Janine doesn’t appear again, and even then it’s minimal, whereas s4 is literally built around the concept of repression. As I go into in a lot more detail in chapter 9 (X), which is about the use of drugs to mask our darkest secrets in TLD, it’s
It’s the moment when the door is coming down and you only have a few seconds to get under it, otherwise you die. Indiana Jones famously goes back for his hat. That one. That’s what the space under the partition looks like. Sherlock, thinking he’s solved the case of Norbury and therefore Mary (more in Chapter 7 X) is ready to pop off – he’s nearly gone. But in a moment of self-interrogation – making sure he got everything right, that John’s safe now – he realises he isn’t, and so he comes down. That sinking downwards is represented by the water imagery, as he sinks deep into his subconscious – LSiT has written a fantastic meta on water in S4 which you can read here
Sherlock had not meant it to come out so harshly, but luckily Mummy knew him well enough that she did not even flinch, merely slid into the seat beside him. They sat in silence for a few moments before she spoke again.
Molly’s father. Sherlock had known he had died, of course, but he had not thought about everything that went with that. He had never really thought about grief until Mary died, not even during his own ‘death’. Which had been a mistake, he had realised afterwards. Grief was something he had always pushed aside in his head, leaving for later. It would come, and he would deal with it then.
There are several layers to how John is in danger – the bottom one, which for me s4 is about getting to the heart of, is that without Sherlock John is suicidal. This was established in ASiP, and I believe is the metaphorical plot of TLD (see Chapter 9 X). However, there’s also the problem of Mary, newly discovered as an assassin, and Sherlock trying to work out who she is and where she comes from – more on that later, but there’s certainly a chance she’s linked to Moriarty, given the Morstan/Moran connections. ‘Did you miss me?’ works for both of those layers – the danger John is in from criminals is something that was really apparent in s1 and 2, but John’s endangerment from suicide is also something that was there at the beginning of the series. Sherlock changed these things – and didn’t realise he was the changing factor, but something in his subconscious is telling him that with him gone, John Watson is once again in danger.
“Yeah, of course.” Sherlock felt the heat burn behind his eyes, and desperately blinked it back. John continued. “It’s just that – I haven’t found anywhere good. Yet. I mean, I will, I know I will, but I guess…” John tailed off, but those words lit a spark in the centre of Sherlock’s chest. He didn’t dare to hope, and yet –
It was not even a kiss. John had placed his lips to Sherlock’s head in the way a parent would, maybe an older brother if they were not as touch-averse as Mycroft. Sherlock had seen him perform the same action on Harry the few times they had seen her. It was not even a kiss, he told himself. John was drunk – he did not usually express emotion. Sherlock knew enough about his parents to suspect they had stunted his emotional development. So at Christmas he tried to thank Sherlock and did not have the words – and did that.
Other moments in this scene are lovely – Sherlock is continually distorted by a mirror on the wall, reminding us that this is him trying to process the hypotheses he is running about Mary in his brain. This brain, as previously mentioned, is under siege, and it’s important then that Mycroft and Sherlock both acknowledge that Sherlock and sentiment are becoming one and the same; TFP is going to be about the brain and the heart learning to work together, rather than against one another, but Mycroft’s disparagement and the underground dungeon he’s living in show that we’re not there just yet.
Nick Frost’s appearance as Father Christmas gave us all a good laugh, but he was also used as the indicator that the world we were perceiving was a dream world. This was made a bit of a joke of early in the episode – in a sci-fi world like this, are we seriously looking for what’s not realistic as the code to crack the dream? The exact same joke is made in
The glowing blue light sticks around, and seems particularly associated with Rosie, like she’s the focus of much of Sherlock’s thought at the moment. LSiT’s meta linked above has already picked up on the many dangers in Rosie’s cradle decoration, from the Moriarty linked images to the killer whale mobile. Due purely to a lucky pause, I caught the killer whale’s eyes glowing blue, just like the blue from the rattle scene. He’s thinking about her in terms of the key villains of the show as well as the villains in his mind.
And yet. The problem with kisses was they leant themselves to hope. Sherlock could still feel the patch of skin John’s lips had brushed, lit up electric by his touch. He ran his fingers through his hair, lingering over that special space. He could not go on like this, he knew, longing after John, averting his gaze every time John looked his way. John’s kiss had been casual, brotherly; it drove home the imbalance in their relationship. He could not live with a man whose every glance he longed for, whose every touch sent unrequited sparks through him. Rosie could not grow up with a man who had ulterior designs on her father. Sherlock knew all of this, but last night had brought it into focus somehow. John’s carelessness with his affection was like a knife in Sherlock’s gut.
He turned away from Sherlock and found Molly Hooper at his elbow. She had escaped from Stamford, it seemed. “John – it’s been ages.”
John took his chance after he had put Rosie to bed that Sunday night. He had calmed his nerves with a tot of whisky, attributing it to Christmas and hoping Sherlock had believed him. Sherlock declined the alcohol with a small smile, but that did not dissuade John. He knew he would need it.
is that an actress commits suicide by overdose after causing the death of her ex-girlfriend, who has left her for a man, and that the first two-thirds of the film are her dream of an alternate scenario in which her girlfriend is saved. The last third of the film zooms in and out of ‘real life’, but at the end we see a surreal version of the actual overdose which suggests that this ‘real life’, too, has just been in her psyche. Sherlock dying and recognising that this may kill John is an integral part of TAB, and the relationships have clear parallels, but what is most interesting here is the structural similarity; two-thirds of the way through TAB, give or take, we have the jolt into reality, zoom in and out of it for a while and then have a fucky scene to finish with that suggests that everything is, in fact, still in our dying protagonist’s brain.
, and this, we’re led to believe, is the moment when Amy chooses Rory. I don’t believe this. The Doctor/Rory conflict goes on for a lot longer than this, and it’s far too early in their first series to resolve it. It would leave a lot of later episodes without nearly so much tension. It’s true that Amy does have some agency in choosing – the science is questionable, as the Doctor says they’ve all tapped into some space LSD equivalent from an unmentioned offscreen adventure which has induced a mutual psychic trance, which means that we’re not sure how much agency each of the characters has in this dream. It’s not seeded, and so it sounds like a fudge – deliberately. Because a pseudoscientific explanation like this can’t explain the Dream Lord himself, Amy and Rory point out, and the Doctor admits that the Dream Lord, the architect of the dreams themselves, was actually the Doctor’s psyche. The space LSD sounded like a fudge – and Amy and Rory expose that it wasn’t just a fudge on Moffat’s part, it was a fudge on the Doctor’s part.
, this final breakthrough is what’s going to allow Sherlock to open his own eyes, right? So that phrase is doubly powerful.
"Oh," he said, because just this once he was slower than I was to realise something: My limits of position had been rescinded. I could move however I wanted.
I sucked in my breath as I sat up, pushing against the table, and cut myself on a fragment of glass.
." One hand still on his head, I let the other fall to his shoulder and grasped it firmly. "Pull yourself together.
"I missed you so much," he said. "I think it drove me mad. Perhaps I'm mad now. John, are you really here?"
"What do you mean?" But as we stood thus, with him leaning on me, and myself with no support, I felt again the absence of pain as I stood, symmetrical. Not strong, perhaps, not yet, but
His hand in mine reminded me - I could feel the doubled weight of two rings. I looked down at them. "Why are you wearing...?"
His expression changed at once into something much more comprehensible. "Oh Watson, how many times must I say, time travel is nothing more than a childish fantasy - "
Something serious had happened. I was not prepared to grapple with it naked. I opened the bedroom door, took his dressing-gown from where it hung on the hook and put it on, though it was too long for me.
Yes, I had guessed that - I must have frightened him for a moment. He must have thought I was dead for a moment. Else why did he cry and cling to me as he had? Why was his manner so stricken?
We were talking across each other's words, in a parody of the excitement of a good puzzle or invention.
I do not know if I am able to explain what that was like. How many years I had endured, with no prospect of relief save the temporary sort in opiates or palliative magic, which can be nearly as deleterious to the health. I had little to look forward to but many more years of the same, in which the temporary measures would grow less and less effective, however little I liked to use them in the first place.
He showed me his hand, and I could see the indentations of long wear on his ring finger. His own ring was now settled where it should be, but it had left a mark higher up towards the knuckle.
"Why aren't you telling me what happened?" I looked at the grey hair that had not been there this morning. I tried to guess. "Have... you discovered time travel after all?"
that time by remaining in stasis. What you think of as this morning was - more than three years ago for me."
He fumbled to take them off - his own and then mine. He offered it back to me with a trembling hand.
When I went to sleep on the sofa, I was done-up by a long day - the sort of day that seemed far too full of things to have had only twenty-four hours in it. Holmes was on to some new experimental process and had declined to talk about it, probably because he was uncertain of success, and so I had undertaken some of the legwork - so to speak - for an ongoing case. It was not a very glamourous one, but it earned us a very useful stipend paid by a duchess for whom 'More Money Than Sense' could well have been a family motto. Holmes disdained these concerns, but I could not afford to do so. Miraculous as the things the inventing magician made were, and oh they
My mind spinning uselessly in confusion, I cradled that dark head against me and stared down, eyes moving over the grey scattered there.
"You were in a sort of egg," Holmes said, sounding distracted. "A crystal. It was on the table when I realised you were in it."
For a moment I truly did not know what he meant. Letter? Had I left a letter... But then I remembered what he was talking about.
"Well, really, my dear, even I know 'the rings of Cronus' as a literary reference. Your sentimental thinking - "
, glass everywhere and furniture and machines and shelves and all in chaos, overturned, destroyed. Several windows had been broken out.
"Do you mean the letter I hid in the brass orrery?" I felt a faint stirring of outrage as he nodded.
Holmes was saying, or trying to say - his voice struggling in his throat. Wet fingers cupped my face and the lips on mine were salty with tears.
. He had thought my body vapourised, dispersed; I had left my clothes and my ring and the bullet behind. He thought he had
He did get up then, but grasped my shoulders and looked down into my face. His own still looked so strange, distorted, his pale eyes wide and his thin face streaked with tears.
And Sherlock Holmes, openly weeping, stood with his hands pressed to his mouth as he stared at me. Tears dripped down onto his fingers.
"Sherlock," I said, in my quietest, calmest tones, as though I were gentling a horse; "Sherlock - " I stroked my fingers through his hair, waiting patiently, as though this were a thing that happened sometimes and had only to be waited out, like a sudden summer storm.
"You did this," I said, and for some reason he flinched back at the words, but reassured by the obvious joy in my voice and upon my face, he relaxed once more, though hesitantly.

I went to the bedroom door - how strange to navigate this familiar room without the familiar walking stick - and had just taken hold of the handle when he said,
The scene transition where all of the glass breaks and then we cut to a background of what looks like blue water is a motif that runs through this entire episode – we’re smashing down walls in Sherlock’s mind, most particularly the Thatcher wall of 1980s homophobia, and indeed the first picture we see is that of the smashed bust.
We cut out of this flashback into Sherlock standing and thinking to himself. Normally, in the show, that means that what we’ve been seeing is a mind palace construction or a flashback. When the AGRA scene showed, I expected us to cut to Mary explaining it to Sherlock and/or John, because that would explain its flashback nature. But again, it’s Sherlock thinking, which like our previous memories of Mary suggest that none of it is real – it’s a stop gap as he tries to work her out. It could be argued that Sherlock got this info from his glance at the memory stick, but I don’t buy that – the memory stick contains material from before their betrayal, not after.
I toyed with the entirety of HLV being in EMP, because parts of it are weird (think Magnussen pissing in Baker Street, or the fucky MP glasses), but I ultimately dismissed it, though I’m willing to be challenged on this. I dismissed it as being a part of Sherlock’s post-wedding drug abuse for a few reasons. The first is that we only see Sherlock wake up from his drug abuse, not go into it – EMP is something that’s going to be hard for viewers to swallow, and Mofftiss are actually quite good at dropping big hints and drawing attention to the important bits along the way. That’s really not the case in the crack den, which is well integrated into the plot and has no traces of Sherlock’s mind palace. The second is that, actually, the premise of HLV is far too integrated into the main plot of s3 to be entirely MP – the CAM stuff and Janine at John and Mary’s wedding could be Sherlock extrapolating, but it seems like a bizarre extrapolation to make given how much fuckier the s4 mysteries are (London aquarium, Culverton’s drugging, the entirety of TFP) - the only MP fuckiness we get in HLV really takes place after Mary shoots Sherlock, like the restaurant scene with CAM or the Appledore Vaults being his MP. Mary shooting Sherlock also has far too many throwbacks with Norbury and Eurus in s4 to be completely irrelevant. So, with that in mind – let's go.
John had woken determined to explain himself to Sherlock, but he had forgotten that today they had guests. Sherlock had launched into the preparation of the meal and drinks with more gusto than usual, bustling around in a manner that was incredibly like his mother, but also conveniently meant that he could not be stopped in conversation. Before John knew it, their guests were upon them: Sherlock’s parents, Harry, Clara, Molly, Greg, Mrs. Hudson, Mike and even Mycroft, whose parents’ affectionate terming of him ‘Myc’ was causing much confusion with a slightly squiffy Stamford.
I preface this by saying how incredibly uncomfortable I find the positioning of women as the KKK in TAB. It’s a parallel which is unforgivable; frankly, invoking the KKK without interrogating the whiteness of the show or even mentioning race is unacceptable. Steven Moffat’s ability to write women has consistently been proven to be nil, but this is a new low. However, the presence of women in TAB is vital, so on we go.
, is pretty helpful here I think – of course it has relevance within the episode, but this episode should also get us thinking about what was going on this time last year, when Sherlock was airing.
is the structure of it, because I think it will help us understand TAB a little better. [If you don’t want spoilers for
is (I believe) the final Holmes story, and the east wind that is coming refers to WW1 – Holmes tells Watson that there is an east wind coming and Watson thinks he means it’s cold, and Holmes laughs and jokes that Watson is a stalwart who will always be there. This is a touching moment to end the stories on, and might remind us of the
to try to understand Mary’s motives. This is confirmed on a grand scale by TAB – he goes back to ACD canon!Holmes to navigate the problems of his everyday life – so Sherlock is not just a modern Sherlock Holmes, he is on some level self-aware of his existence as a fictional character. As we’ll see going through, his awareness of the existing canon of stories is fascinating and tied up in his repression – how do we break out of canon character, and what has canon been hiding, are two questions which repeatedly come to the fore. Mary is the character who most consistently breaks these canon expectations – a lot of TAB is about this – and that’s something he really struggles to contend with, and is one of the reasons that the reality of canon!verse starts to break down in TAB – it's not sustainable, and it doesn’t tell the full story. These two moments early on in EMP show him negotiating his identity and his experiences in his mind in relation to what he knows about Sherlock Holmes – an early iteration of a theme that’s going to become much larger.
Sherlock gulped. Was he so transparent? He turned to her, but before he could force out a garbled denial, Mummy continued:
John often represents the heart in Sherlock’s MP – I haven’t quite worked out how to distinguish between heart!John and Sherlock’s imagined John yet, and am flying on instinct, which is definitely not sustainable! But it strikes me that a lot about HLV and TST is about understanding the impact of this shooting on John, and that therefore this needs to be John as Sherlock imagines him.
3. That s4 engages with the history of Sherlock Holmes adaptations through the character of Sherlock investigating his psyche
refers to the story that was already covered in TRF and the phone situation with the girl on the plane references both ASiB and TGG, and the ending of TST is close to a rerun of HLV. It’s pretty much impossible to escape echoes of previous series in a way that is almost creepy, but we’ve already had this explained to us in TAB –
The positioning of the aeroplane problem in relation to the John-trapped-in-a-well problem is also pretty important. I’m of the firm belief that Eurus represents queer trauma, and this is the trauma that throughout the entirety of series 4 is both pushing him towards John and blocking him from him. Sherlock needs to wake up to save John, and has to push through the trauma to recognise this – but the trauma is blocking his way. She’s stopping him from helping John – it’s a terrible moment when Sherlock is telling John that he’s busy whilst John is drowning in the well – but it’s also pushing through the aeroplane moment that allows him to save John in the MP. This is the paradox of queer repression, right, and the paradox in Eurus’s behaviour – she’s simultaneously blocking Sherlock and leading him on to the solution.
). I also think, although am not an expert on sound, that we can hear a slight eerie dripping when Magnussen walks through the vaults, which ties thematically to the water that is linked to falling/sinking in the rest of the EMP.
This is what Sherlock says about Moriarty in the very first scene of TST, and on rewatch the application to Mofftiss is startling. Trust the writers – a short-term disappointment for a long-term excitement, if you will. The reference to the rooftop is a way of pointing out just how far back this has been planned – in other words, the seeming randomness of the series is not in fact random. But let’s see how that plays out in TST.
“It’s exciting for her,” Sherlock replied genuinely, and John’s eyes softened with relief. “Why are you up so early?” he added as an afterthought. Surely it wasn’t just the snow.
John nodded, and Sherlock knew he really did. John nuzzled his face into Sherlock’s chest and they held each other close. Tomorrow was the start of a new life, but for now, they were together.
Faith!Eurus, who is a mirror for John in TLD, is thrown the bag, and we see Sherlock weigh it and then realise there’s a gun in it – too late. A bag is the female equivalent of a coat (*cries about pockets*) and the throwing motif with the heavy gun inside it is a clear link between the two moments. Sherlock didn’t recognise the significance of the gun in the first one, possibly because he couldn’t process the situation without mirrors (more on the importance of Eurus as a series of heterosexual mirrors later). When he realises in TLD that he’s made a mistake, that there’s something he’s missed, the implication isn’t that he’s missed it in his analysis of Faith!Eurus, because in no sense of the word does Faith!Eurus exist. What it means is that he missed it in his first, cursory analysis of John. Not the heaviness, but exactly what it meant. The symbols of John’s suicidal ideation start to appear and threaten to break in right up until the end of TLD – this is arguably the first point we start to see them.
I’m going to talk about water a lot more in the chapters on TFP, because of John in the well and pirates and
Sherlock nodded mutely as he finally let her leave. Christmas was turning out to be a lot more complicated than he had thought.
The lunch had been lovely, actually; John and Daddy got on a storm, and Sherlock and Mummy had exchanged playful barbs as they were wont to – they were less acerbic without Mycroft present, Sherlock always found. Sherlock had been enlisted to help with the washing up whilst John had been assured that he should do no such thing, and that he should show Rosie the garden. Sherlock had huffed and puffed at his parents’ double standard, though of course they were absolutely correct – lovely as she was, Rosie was enough work even were John not a guest. Sherlock and Mummy had stayed reasonably non-verbal through the washing-up, beyond functional conversation; Sherlock had found his eye captivated by the sight of John outside the window, showing Rosie each plant, no doubt making up stories about the magical creatures that lived in them. He was sure John knew nothing about plants. The housework finished, he had lapsed into stillness at the window, just observing.
, so I’m not going to run through them again here. I think Sherlock comes the closest to death that we see him in the EMP at the end of HLV – if you remember, he’s been put on a plane in ‘exile’ by Mycroft, but in reality is being sent to his death. This plane/height image is really important. In the Christian tradition (and therefore majority Western tradition that the writers are writing in), the sky is associated with heaven – Sherlock’s plane taking off being synonymous with his death seems a pretty straightforward metaphor in that regard. (It’s even one that’s used in
And as John looked it him, it was as though the bottom dropped out of his stomach, as though he began to spiral infinitely into an abyss he had not realised he had been staving off, because it was then that he realised that he loved him.
, though I don’t know if that’s a good thing.) Further to that – it ties in nicely with Sherlock being ‘high’ through a lot of s4, which represents the moments in which he is most repressed and his repression is most tied to self-harm. We have further ideas to buttress the height/aeroplane metaphor with, however – do you remember the plane in ASiB?
This one is perhaps the most straightforward on a symbolism level, but also possibly the most significant moment in the series. Therapist!Eurus, plain and simple, is Sherlock’s trauma prodding at John, interrogating him like a therapist would, trying to work him out – and largely failing, right? She can get basically nothing about how he feels about Sherlock out of him. But this is part of MP!Eurus’s ongoing project to get Sherlock to wake up – the Gay Trauma is interrogating John, trying to suss him, and failing.
, which came out in 2013. The dream in question is a psychic telepathy connecting five of our main characters whilst they sleep, controlled by Madame Vastra. Much has been made of Madame Vastra being an explicit Sherlock mirror (
, but it is Steven Moffat. This ties together really nicely at the end and gives us hope that Sherlock isn’t at a complete dead end – Jim Moriarty, who was always back, representing the threat to John Watson, has now taken a much more concrete form in the form of Mary. Mary is the reason John is in danger. Sherlock knew this already, but going up nearly to heaven in the form of Ella, he thought there was nothing he could do – here Sherlock’s subconscious is once again in this episode prodding him through Mary as it will through Eurus, pointing out that he can change things. Mary’s DVD is intercut with Sherlock’s visit to John’s house – is it a coincidence that there are inverted hearts on the railings? (Invert being a euphemism for queer that this fandom is long used to.) Sherlock’s subconscious is crying out to him!! The anyone but you stuff is much more relevant to TLD, so we’ll leave it for then. Mary’s video continues in audio overlaid over Sherlock – others have pointed out that she repeats lines, but the inflection is different – it’s like a dream memory, not a recording, where using just one recording would really have been a lot easier for the editing team. Again, the show is playing with inconsistency, unsettling us.
performance in this scene, that’s not strictly true either. The centre of this scene is Sherlock explaining John’s love for Mary. It’s not about the Watsons – it's about Sherlock understanding what’s going on, which fits into EMP theory exactly. I firmly believe that Sherlock begins his EMP trip believing that John loves Mary, and slowly unravels the threads to realise that it’s actually him John cares about, and this scene is testament to the first part – the deduction that he makes about John loving Mary is flawless, but despite explicitly referencing himself, he fails to see the obvious –
This is one of the reasons that the year 1895 is so important; it was the year of Oscar Wilde’s trial and imprisonment for gross indecency, and this is clearly a preoccupation of Sherlock’s consciousness in TFP with its constant Wilde references, suggesting that his MP’s choice of 1895 wasn’t coincidental. Much was made during TAB setlock of a newspaper that said ‘Heimish The Ideal Husband’, Hamish being John’s middle name and
That was the question, as much as anything else. If John had to name his friends most cut out for fatherhood, until recently Sherlock’s name would have been a definite last on the list. He was a dangerous man, John knew, emotionally immature, highly strung, an addict – all of the things that would make John wince as a GP preparing someone for parenthood. But Sherlock was also kind and gentle, more loving towards Rosie than anyone else John knew. When John had been in trouble, Sherlock had dropped everything and risked his life to get him back. Granted, in many cases it was Sherlock who had got him into trouble in the first place, but the thought nevertheless was there. When Mary had died, Sherlock had opened his home and life to John and Rosie with nary a word of complaint. John knew without needing to think that Sherlock was the steadiest, most reliable person he knew, even if he was simultaneously the most volatile.
“Christ – schools for Rosie. Mary was looking at that before she died. I haven’t even though about it since.”
The obsession with the memory stick here is important because the memory stick represents the unknown about Mary that Sherlock is trying – and failing – to get to grips with. However, he’s still going about it the wrong way, and we know that from one line of Mary’s: ‘Sherlock the dragon slayer’. We’ve had these references to Sherlock’s ridiculous hero complex before, but this one stands out, because it feels like a throwback – and it is! But, it’s a throwback to:
. Others will feature, but if you want a really strong grip on what I’m talking about, I’d recommend taking a look at all of these, or at the very least
The conversation between Sherlock and Mycroft, who has been established as his brain in TSoT (I cannot find this meta! Where Mycroft is brain and John is heart! Can anyone help?), is pretty straightforward – the brain is interrogating Sherlock’s obsession with the Magnussen case and why he can’t just let it go, and the emotion we see here from Sherlock is more powerful than pretty much anything we get in real life. I actually think this scene is one of the most vulnerable moments he has in the show – and there’s no way that vulnerability would be to Mycroft in real life. There’s also, crucially, no reason why MI6 should actually want Sherlock dead this early. It’s another tell-tale sign that the surface plot doesn’t make sense – we should be looking deeper. Sherlock has just brought down a terrorist network – MI6 should love him. What Mycroft is actually putting forward is that already, way before Sherlock kills Magnussen, pretty much as soon as he enters EMP this is a two-way fork. He can choose to die at any point. But he doesn’t.
And, crucially, what was the first thing the Doctor said about domestic!dream, long before he realised he created it?
- but Sherlock’s mind turning that beard back on himself to mock him? Absolutely makes sense. Remember, this is the loathing that pushes him back into the deep coma – this scene is really pivotal.
Sherlock shook his head. He did not have the words. Mummy seemed to understand; she simply sat beside him. Sherlock felt her eyes on him as he looked straight ahead, through the glass once more to John.
Sherlock believes that Mary is Smallwood because of her perfume. This is a rational enough assumption to make, but it’s not just based on perfume. We know that since Lady Smallwood has engaged Holmes, Lord Smallwood has committed suicide – so she fits the profile of the blackmailee from
This is purely symbolic – it never happens in the show. Water increases in significance throughout – think of Sherlock thinking he’s going mad in his mind as he is suspended over the Thames, or the utterly nonsensical placement of Sherrinford in the middle of the ocean – the deepest waters of Sherlock’s mind. Much like the repetition of cases hinting that EMP continues, the use of water is something that appears in the MP, and it sticks around from TAB onwards, a real sign that we’re going deeper and deeper. I talk about this more in the bit on TFP, but the good news is that Sherrinford is the most remote place they could find in the ocean – that’s the deepest we’re going. After that, we’re coming out (of the mind).
There is a non-explanation for how the Secret Service doctored the footage of Sherlock shooting Magnussen, the response simply being that they have the tech. If the answer is going to be that vague, there is little reason to bring up the question – except to raise it in the viewers’ minds. Making the audience question their belief in the s4 universe is something that happens very frequently, and this is the start of it. A later chapter goes into the parallels that
Why had he frozen? Was this not what he had wanted for so long? Countless nights he had lain awake in bed consumed by longing, imagining John’s soft caresses. And then, last night, John had kissed him – and Sherlock had not known what to do.
Jim’s merging with Emelia calls to mind for me what I think might be the most important visual of all of series 4 – Eurus and Jim’s Christmas meeting, where they dance in circles with the glass between them and seem to merge into each other. I do talk about this in a later chapter, but TLDR – if Jim represents John being in danger and Eurus represents decades of repressed gay trauma, this merging is what draws the trauma to the surface just as Jim’s help is what suddenly makes Eurus a problem. It is John’s being in danger which makes Sherlock’s trauma suddenly spike and rise – he has to confront this for the first time – just like Emelia Ricoletti’s case from 1895 only needs solving for the first time now that Jim is back.
“If you say so.” Sherlock’s voice curled out from behind the kitchen doors. John tried and failed not to fume.
He heard John unlock the door of 221 down below, coming in from the surgery, and suddenly Sherlock’s heart was in his mouth. Sherlock had always been vocal about his hatred for Christmas. John would think something was wrong, that he was overcompensating for Mary’s death – which he was – or trying somehow to muscle in on Rosie’s first Christmas, Rosie and John’s first Christmas together, to make it a Rosie, John and Sherlock Christmas. Maybe he was doing that too. He panicked, and as he heard John ascend the seventeen steps to Baker Street he made a rush to the mantelpiece, unhooking some of the ornamental holly just as John walked through the sitting room door. He felt heat rising in his face as John stood dead still, staring at him holding a piece of verdant plastic, disbelieving.
, not just the camera footage – it would have been very easy to give us most of the same footage in security camera style, but they deliberately reused shots from the show to make us doubt their own authenticity. So far, so good.
will know that the magic doesn’t last long – it’s pretty much an introductory way in, and most of the rest of his important deductions will all be made in dreams. This is one of the most famous scenes in the whole programme, because it introduced the world to the weirdness of what had been set up as a straightforward cop show, and despite Cooper rarely (possibly never?) mentioning Tibet again, it’s still highly quoted and recognisable. As a watershed moment in bringing dream worlds into normal detective dramas (something highly frowned upon according to any theory of storytelling!) this is a gamechanging moment, and I don’t think it’s a stretch to point to
John’s breathing quickened; he wetted his lips, and Sherlock saw the nervousness in the tautness of his jaw. Perhaps he had been more obvious than he thought – perhaps John had seen through him a long time ago. But he had begun, and God help him he was going to finish.
Only the previous week he had walked past the open shop front of a Hamley’s, glittering with Christmas promise. He had never looked twice in one of them before, but he had been awed this year. He imagined Rosie faced with such splendour. He knew, of course, that to a child under a year old it doesn’t matter whether the toys are Hamley’s or hand-me-downs. And yet.
, judging by the name, and who is currently dominated by the destructive MP!Eurus. The other important point to note here is that Sherrinford is an island in the middle of the sea – that’s not a coincidence, given how much water imagery abounds in this series. I spoke briefly in Chapter 2

This episode is the culmination of a series in which Amy is actually an almost-person, and Amy has been dreaming all of their adventures with a flesh avatar actually having them with Rory and the Doctor. Here it is Amy, rather than the Doctor, who is dreaming, which is a little ambiguous, but there are two key aspects that parallel
Molly sighed. “Yes, Sherlock. Most families do. I don’t even know why you’re bothering asking me – you have actually celebrated Christmas before.” She locked the locker door and began to stride towards the exit, but Sherlock evenly intercepted her once more.
And yet, John found himself caught up in the film. Sherlock had been right; it was good, although not normally the sort of film John would choose. Yet he found himself caught up in the mundane family drama around the turn of the previous century, his heart lifting with the surge of the music. Rosie was quickly lulled to sleep, but they did not switch the film off; although Sherlock had seen it many times before, John saw that he was captivated by it once again. It was visually pleasing, he couldn’t deny. And there weren’t many films that Sherlock watched without complaining, so he took that as a plus too.
) so there’s not a great need to go into Sherlock’s therapy session here. Instead, let’s note a final few things – although Sherlock is tempted to let it all go, thinking there’s nothing he can do to save John from his loss of Mary (Ella therapy scene) he can’t stop his heart from reflecting – John walking around a room with a reflection of dark blue curtains on an immensely reflective table.
) goes into much greater detail about how his queer trauma (Eurus) is prodding at his hypothesis of John here, forcing Sherlock to masquerade as a woman in the form of trauma!Eurus because trauma!Eurus will not let him truly accept queer desire and the possibility of reciprocity. It is why we get a story which rings so false about John here. However, I’m running the risk of repeating said chapter, so we’ll move ahead.
That afternoon, with Sherlock out on a case, he decided to light it. It wasn’t a Sunday, and he knew that was how it was supposed to work, but he also knew the candles would run out if he did one each Sunday, and besides it was a fire hazard with an eleven-month old in the flat. He thought he would simply show it to Rosie, and light the candles in memory of her mother. While Sherlock was out, of course. Even whilst Baker Street had been a welcome rhythm to slip into once again, there was still an unspoken awkwardness around Mary. John wondered if Sherlock still blamed himself for her death. John certainly did not blame him any longer. It was a conversation he didn’t know how to have, somehow.
. It’s one of the first things Holmes says and it is during his first deduction in Lauriston Gardens. This is where I’m going to dive pretty deep into the metatextual side of things, so bear with the weirdness.
Molly couldn’t stop herself from cracking a smile. Sherlock took that as an invitation to continue. “Do you have a Christmas tree?”
Notice that ‘glad to be alive’ is followed by Vivian saying her name – we’ll come back to this later.
This is arguably the key to spotting that TAB is a dream long before they tell us – when TAB’s case is early revealed to be a mixture between TRF (Emelia’s suicide) and TGG (the five pips), and we see the opening of ASiP repeated, we should be questioning what on earth is going on. This can also help us to recognise s4 as being EMP as well though – old motifs from the previous series keep repeating through the cases, like alarm bells ringing. Moriarty telling Sherlock that there is nothing new under the sun is his key to understanding that the Emelia case is meant to help him understand what happened to Jim, that it’s a mental allegory or
that shows how much fuckier than any other episode HLV is (excluding TSoT and everything post s3), and that doesn’t even take into account all of the jumping between scenes that we see in the Christmas bit. Jumping from Leinster Gardens to Christmas to Baker Street and back several times is chronologically odd and doesn’t seem to serve a purpose, except to show that the rift between John and Mary has lasted for months – and even that didn’t need such a complex interweaving of flashbacks that is so at odds with the show. It’s also at odds with the plot – why on earth did Mummy and Daddy invite John for Christmas, if he’s no longer living with Sherlock, and even stranger, why did they invite Mary if John and Mary haven’t been on speaking terms for months? This isn’t the way human beings behave. There’s also an old adage in writing which says to never move a conversation to a new place – it’s a waste of time and space. Have the conversation here, or have it there. Don’t abort it for no reason – and that’s exactly what they do here. Mofftiss are pretty experienced, and I’m inclined to believe that they’ve done it for a reason.
as Queen’s most iconic queer number – despite not even being one of Mercury’s songs. There is no way that Steven Moffat, and even more so Mark Gatiss would not have an awareness of this in choosing this song for Moriarty. Applying any visual to this song is going to invite comparisons to the video – and inflecting a sense of drag here is far from inappropriate. Moriarty has been subsumed into Eurus in Sherlock’s brain – the male and the female are fused into an androgynous and implicitly therefore all-encompassing being. I’m not necessarily comfortable with the gendered aspect of this – genderbending is something we really only see in our villains here – but given this is about queer trauma, deliberately queering its form in this way is making what we’re seeing much more explicit.
Shortly after TAB aired, I wrote a meta about the waterfall scene, some of which I now disagree with, but the core framework still stands – it did not, of course, bank on EMP theory. You can find it here (
, there’s a lot more to unpack there, but I’m going to leave that for sometime down the line, or for someone else to jump into if they would like. I also want to throw out a thought I haven’t quite come to terms with yet – the elephant in the room in
He had not forgotten the importance of the day, exactly, but he had not imagined it like this. In his mind’s eye, he had seen himself accompanying John and Rosie to the church, holding Rosie and soothing her to give John the space to mourn and even pray. He did not think Mary would have minded that. And then, perhaps, on the cab ride home, placing his hand on John’s, giving him a touch of warmth, letting him know that it would all be okay. That had been his childish fantasy. He hoped that Mary would not have minded that, either. He had always suspected that she had known.
Rosie started to call out, incoherent once more but clearly pointing at the blocks, and John, laughing, put her down to let her continue playing with them. Sherlock gazed on the innocent child, not expecting to feel John’s strong arms pull him into a hug. A hug. John never hugged. Sherlock steadied himself as he embraced him back, trying not to let that familiar smell overpower him as he inhaled John’s scent. He felt the shorter man’s forehead brush against the bottom of his face, and Sherlock had to resist the urge to kiss it. He simply closed his eyes and embraced John tighter. A moment, he reflected, for the Mind Palace. A memory for when he is gone.
And suddenly, a whole host of feelings burst upon him, as though from behind a floodgate. Feelings that he could not voice or understand, but which he hoped Mary could. Feelings of belonging, of home, of love, and of need, stronger than he had ever felt before. He clasped Rosie inadvertently tighter, letting go when she let out a yelp. The feelings washed over him as quickly as they had come.
I’m not the first person to propose EMP [extended mind palace] theory and I certainly can’t claim to take the credit for it! After TFP (well, after Apple Tree Yard aired really) I left the fandom, and only rejoined tjlc this year during lockdown and discovered the theory that the entirety of S4 takes place in Sherlock’s Mind Palace, not just TAB, and that even more crucially, the EMP section of the narrative doesn’t happen because of Sherlock’s overdose but rather after Mary shoots him in HLV. Other people have elaborated as to why this is in greater detail and I certainly don’t want to steal their thunder – you can find some of my favourite metas on this here!
The first thing it tells us is that Sherlock is in his Mind Palace, because he knows that Moriarty is back without needing to be told. But the second is that Mycroft, the brain, is waking Sherlock from his dying stupor to tell him that England needs him, meaning that Sherlock’s brain equates Moriarty coming back with the word ‘England’ in some way. Perhaps this is a tenuous link, but the seed is planted back from ASiP, when we’re taught to associate John with his armchair.
[A side note: can anybody identify/has anybody identified Norbury’s brooch? It looks incredibly significant, a face on it, but I have no idea who – the only person who pops into my head is the queen, and that throws up a lot of ramifications!]
The weird thing about the reveal of how Charlie died is that we see what should have happened, if everything had gone right, before we see how he died. I can’t recall this happening in another episode of
century equivalent for ‘is he a friend of Dorothy?’ is ‘does he know his Latin?’* That’s definitely the sort of thing Mark Gatiss would know and throw in.
Sherlock had cornered Molly Hooper as she was leaving work to ask about Christmas. Her simultaneous sigh and smile as she placed her lab coat in her locker was characteristic of the rueful exasperation that Sherlock so often saw in her eyes to do with him.
) the Doctor thinks he’s broken out of the final dream but goes back to visit Clara and realises that she is now old, and that he’s missed her life. It culminates in him apologising for getting it wrong, for not coming for her in time, for failing her; we get more of this with Clara’s actual death later in the show, but given that it’s a kid’s show and Christmas, this scene is a touch lighter than that. It’s then that Father Christmas comes in to tell the Doctor that he’s still dreaming, he can still save her – and his first word when he wakes up is “Clara”. None of the others trapped in the dream have needed his help to wake from the vision and survive; Clara, who as the companion is our John mirror, specifically needs saving, and the Doctor needs to wake up from his dream within a dream to do that.
Misinterpreting John’s silence, Sherlock stumbled over his words. “Just – hypothetically. Not that Rosie will go there. That’s just as an example. I don’t want you to think –“
shows that he’s no great innovator – he simply notices things and spots patterns from things he has seen before. This is highlighted by the fact that he even makes this claim by quoting someone before him. If our Sherlock also makes deductions based on patterns from the past, extensive dream sequences where he works through past cases as mirrors for present ones makes perfect sense and draws very cleverly on canon. However, I think his spotting of patterns goes deeper than that. Sherlock Holmes has been repressed since the publication of
John felt a lump form in his throat. He had made a terrible error. He had not wanted it to be this way. He had wanted to talk to Sherlock properly, as an adult, to explain his feelings and if necessary apologise for them, to offer Sherlock a fair choice. And instead of offering Sherlock a chance to respond to him, John had floored him, crossed lines that weren’t meant to be crossed. He stepped back, the room swaying around him. Perhaps he had drunk more than he thought. He suspected, however, that the nausea rising in his system had nothing to do with the alcohol. Mumbling incoherently, he excused himself. Sherlock did not speak a word as he went.
Sherlock announces that he has found the black pearl of the Borgias, but of course he hasn’t – it’s the AGRA memory stick. Importantly, the original story ends with the black pearl, so we’re tying back in to the expectation that has been latently set by Craig; here, the show is diverging from canon, and Sherlock doesn’t know what to do about it – his declaration that it’s not possible is literal. This scene gives a perfect parallel to the one in TAB where he attempts to unmask Lady Carmichael only to find Moriarty – he was missing the obvious. Here, we’ve seen already in this episode the serious miscalculation he has made about Moriarty in his brain; he is still treating the Moriarty threat as one of a supervillain. Stealing jewels is something we associate with Moriarty from TRF, but that moment is high camp – it’s the end of the episode between John and Sherlock which is the emotional crux. If we’re focusing on what Jim means in himself, we’re missing the point – and it’s exactly the same here. Sherlock needs to reconceptualise Jim as his fear of losing John, and this is the moment when his brain connects this properly to Mary. Bear in mind that everything that happens after Sherlock is shot in HLV takes place within the EMP, so we know nothing about Mary in reality. The AGRA memory stick doesn’t represent who Mary genuinely is – it represents the great unknown of Mary, the question mark over her head. Never forget, after all, that the original AGRA box from the stories was empty. It’s the same here – our divergence into Mary’s past is untrue. When Sherlock realises that Moriarty is somehow to do with the memory stick, he is realising that his fear of John dying is tied into his confrontation with Mary back in 2014 (!). This moment of realisation drives the rest of the episode to Mary’s death scene, where Sherlock relives his own attempted assassination by Mary (as we’ll see) – this is what he has to figure out. If we need more impetus to realise that what happens in HLV post shooting is wrong, look at Sherlock’s flashback to John and Mary’s reunion in HLV – if we take this show at face value, that simply can’t be right, because Sherlock wasn’t there. The only way to read this is if such a scene took place in Sherlock’s own brain – a kind of fill in the blanks as he tried to excuse Mary, only now realising that she is, in fact, the most serious threat of all.
Again, if we weren’t sure about Mycroft representing the brain without the heart, his rejection of the baby photos is sending out a clear message of juxtaposition with John, who represents the heart. We also shouldn’t fail to notice the water coming over Sherlock’s face again as he struggles to recognise what is important about this. This comes as he is trying to recognise what is important about the Thatchers case. I’m going to try to lay it out as best I can here.
what is supposed to happen – John and Mary are supposed to be married for good (until she dies) in canon. A whole load of false endings – new stories superseding old ones. Mofftiss has an idea that there’s a new story that’s going to be told, and our strongest canon divergence is the end of s3, when we get into the EMP – and from thereon in to TAB it’s off the deep end, and the same is seen here. That TV static is talking about a new medium for a new age and their refusal to deal with established canon norms. Just in case we didn’t remember, outside in the porch we even get a visual reminder of the TV static with a second’s flashback to ‘Miss Me?’ Bad news is, that means Sherlock Holmes rejecting the norms he’s been given (feasibly represented by the hyperbolic nuclear family here) and instead… dying in his mind palace. Less fun. Carl Powers died too. Sherlock still hasn’t got there quite yet – let’s hope he doesn’t.
Drowning in the Mind Palace. Here we are, back where we started. Sherlock might be thinking about the case of Charlie, but he’s actually reflecting on that world we saw in the promo photos, where he’s struggling to stay alive in his brain. Notice that this isn’t just a split shot, it’s specifically a mirror, so we’re meant to focus on this episode as an act of reflection. There are great parallels between Sherlock and the Charlie case which you can find here (
Sherlock shook his head, finally forming the words that had been forming a lump in his throat. “You haven’t.”
“Joint cleverest. Both my boys.” Sherlock laughed at Mummy’s exasperation; the fraternal competition would never cease. “But neither of you is a patch on the cleverest woman –“ she gestured towards herself – “so come on. What’s going on?”
Sherlock trembles above him. “You’re an idiot,” he complains. “You won’t get anywhere like this. Leave me, for God’s sake.”
They can’t delay any longer. Not even waiting for Sherlock to stop convulsing, John musters his remaining strength and gets moving.
“Right.” Snippets of the past few hours play themselves back in John's ears, a white noise of Sherlock arguing with half the Met about some detail he seemed to think was being overlooked whilst everybody else seemed happy to call the case closed. Including John. He shakes his head in confusion. “Wait. I thought we were letting the Spanish police handle him? He’s not operating out of London anymore. As Lestrade would say, '
He took John slowly, each time enveloping another inch of him, until John could feel himself encountering the back of his throat. He expected Sherlock to gag, but there was only the mildest fluttering and the cool rushing of air as he breathed through his nose. On the next pass, John almost lost it when Sherlock sank all the way down, blocking off his own airway and taking him deeper than he had any right to be inside another human.
At last the game was underway. It took him a while to grasp the rules, but soon John found himself quite enjoying the spectacle. Sherlocked appeared neither impressed, nor particularly bored by it. In fact, he seemed to be fidgeting a lot in his seat. If John didn’t know better, he’d say he looked distracted.
Looking around, Greg saw no complaints from anyone else, which also wasn’t particularly surprising; he couldn’t think of a single soul, gay or straight, who’d turn down the opportunity to steal a kiss from Sherlock Holmes, even if they’d never openly admit it. So he spun the bottle on the table again, and a few seconds later it stopped on John.
Urgency spikes when a distraught face gasps above the water a mere meter away. As soon as his arms come around John’s waist, the man clings onto him with an iron grip.
Marseille? That’s days away. In fact, it’s their last stop before returning to Mahon. John sighs, dropping his phone to the bed. Well, that didn't take long, did it? True to form, Sherlock has already reverted to his usual brash self. How quickly his walls go back up, his attention refocused by the allure of the case. While it doesn’t seem that his earlier concern was disingenuous, he did grow bored of it awfully quickly. Caring, as it turns out, takes quite a bit of energy. Who knew?
And on his part, it was a rare pleasure for Sherlock to have such a captive audience. John had, over the years, grown immune to his sudden bouts of musicality. In the beginning, it had always caused him to stop what he was doing, or drift into the living room if he was elsewhere, and just listen while Sherlock caressed some mournful tune out of his instrument. And Sherlock loved that, really. John had an unusual talent for making him feel special, as if he appreciated him not just for his mind or his keen deductive abilities, but for all these other useless parts of him too. His music would never solve a murder, would never uncover the secret identity of a blackmailer or lead anyone to a hidden cache of stolen riches, yet John was, at one time, as fascinated by it as everyone else was of his intellect.
Throwing off the scarf again, Sherlock stormed back to the coffee table, plucked up his glass and finished off his Whiskey in one gulp, his pinky still ridiculously extended despite his furious temper. He slammed the empty glass back on the table (John winced, imagining it shattering and them having to spend the rest of the night stitching up his fingers) and threw himself back into his chair.
A slim blade gleams in Mikhail’s fisted grip, but the danger barely registers. His thoughts snap back to John, on the vision of him falling. He has minutes— no, seconds to act, to save him.
“Sherlock—” His voice rasped, more a rush of air than sound. This couldn’t be happening to him. This wasn’t
Glancing above him, he spots the distorted shape of the Aurora as it rumbles along the surface, its broad hull bulging beneath the waterline like the belly of an enormous whale. In the bottomless black waters surrounding him, it’s his only point of reference. He kicks towards it, towards the surface, spurred on by the screaming protests of his lungs, and just as his chest begins to heave with pain he breaks the surface, coughing up lungfuls of seawater and dragging in great heaving gasps of air.
“How?” Sherlock asked after a moment, looking genuinely perplexed. “I made sure, my technique was completely unidentifiable… Wait. If you knew, then why did you…?”
when he inevitably has to step in and resolve the situation. If he didn’t want Sherlock sabotaging his dates, he shouldn’t keep trying to have them at the most inopportune times, like in the middle of a case. Or when Sherlock is bored and needs someone to read him the paper because he doesn’t want to get up from the couch. It’s not such a difficult concept to grasp.
“Whatever you installed, I’m uninstalling it,” John declares, his fingers tapping audibly against the screen. “When I find the icon.” The tapping intensifies. “You’ve hidden the icon. For God’s sake…”
Sherlock turns to him. “I know this case has been difficult. We're both ready to be done with it. I don't say it often enough, but your assistance has been essential, and more than that, I enjoy your company.”
“You really think I’d try the same thing twice?” John said, almost managing to sound offended at the notion that Greg really thought him that stupid. But the D.I. shook his head.
It was becoming too much to resist. But even as his hand moved of its own accord to paw at his groin, Sherlock whirled in front of him, his coat billowing to surround them both. With firm hands on his shoulders, Sherlock pushed John back against the wall of a building, pressing in close to him.
Behind Sherlock’s chair, the steer skull was gaily decorated with a santa hat and a tinsel scarf. The tinsel was the same colour as the length currently adorning Sherlock’s neck. He adjusted it now and then as if it were an expensive accessory, worn deliberately, and not something John had draped over him earlier with the jokey excuse of brightening him up a bit.
, and that’s all it took to tip him over the edge. The air left him in a rush as his orgasm thundered through him. His cock shot milky ropes of ejaculate between them, coating Sherlock’s stomach above him, spilling over his hand and dripping down onto John’s skin. He might have cried out in pleasure, but he couldn’t hear it. His vision tunnelled out, every nerve sparked into life as wave after wave of bright, electric pleasure scrambled his brain and compelled every muscle in his body to clench, and clench, and
“You English, all so stupid.” His laughter comes like a rumble of approaching thunder. “At least nosey friend tried to be sneaky. Put up a good fight. You just run out and not even care about man with knife at your back.”
“Shh, you’re alright. I’m right here,” John coos, wrapping his arms protectively around him as another small shudder ripples through Sherlock’s battered chest. “It’s okay. Go to sleep. I’ll be right here, the whole time.”
Fear suddenly shivered across his skin, raising the hair on the back of his neck. Unable to remain passive, Sherlock found himself climbing the stairs to John’s room, deliberately stepping on the creaky boards to announce his presence. John’s bedroom door was unlatched, and Sherlock pressed it open slowly.
John leans against the doorframe. Sherlock’s dark eyes watch him expectantly. Neither of them speak for several minutes, until finally, John decides it’s enough. He clears his throat, his voice exuding a calm that disguises the rumbling storm in his head. “You know what you did was wrong.”
Then he jerks to, his lungs burning, throat flooded with water. He begins kicking instinctively. The impact must have knocked him out, albeit briefly. Sounds are muted, his vision cloudy. Even his own gurgles sound muffled as they rippled up and away from him in a cascade of bubbles.
It was safer that way, he’d told himself. The last thing he wanted to do was scare John off by saying something stupid in his confusion of messy emotions.
“Here,” Sherlock pointed at his chest, and fixed his sight on John’s face. “Come for me, John. Show me how good this feels to you. I want to watch you coming on me.”
Sherlock whirls around to face Mikhail and his unknown accomplice. The Russian fits the profile he’d been searching for, almost like every ugly criminal stereotype was based on his template, right down to the heavy set of his jaw and every line carved into his snide expression. But the other? It is rare, but Sherlock has heard of the occasional female trafficker. He’s just never seen one before now. Except for the smug look on her face, nothing would have tipped him off that she and Mikhail would be working together.
John watched over his shoulder at all the people marching by. Occasionally someone would glance over and meet his eyes, and a coy smile would light up their face at the sight of two people sharing a moment of tenderness and love. It made John’s breath hitch in his throat, a burst of pleasure flaring hot in his steadily leaking cock;
Sherlock’s smile deflates, and John knows what he’s going to ask before he even finds the words. “What happened? What made you afraid?”
With a parting smile, she turns to leave. John sinks back into his chair, eyes dancing around the room, hoping to God that Sherlock didn’t happen to be snooping around here at that exact moment. He can just picture the epic sulk that would ensue. It’s a relief when he recalls their text conversation from a few minutes ago, realising that wherever the morgue is, he can be pretty sure it isn’t anywhere near where they’re serving the food.
“Right,” John cuts in sharply, “And what choice did I have? You don't even feed yourself properly. I wasn't about to let you go running off and getting yourself killed because you have the survival instinct of a lemming, and you knew that damn well. You realise this is pretty much blackmail, what you're doing.”
“I’m fine,” John said, his eyes blindly seeking detail in the pitch black of the boot. He thanked his lucky stars neither of them were claustrophobic.
“Move, John,” Sherlock ordered. “It’ll loosen quicker if we’re both working at it. They won’t hear over the engine.”
High above their heads, the stars track lazily across the sky. An hour passes. Maybe two hours. Sherlock doesn’t know. His watch stopped working as soon as he entered the water, but the horizon is still dark and the sea still stretches forever around them, but it feels like they’ve been swimming for days already. John sticks close by his side, matches his lethargic pace stroke for stroke, but they both know he could be miles ahead by now. Sherlock’s stomach twists with a renewed sense of dread. With John’s excellent stamina, he might still have a chance, but not while he’s dragging dead weight behind him.
Sherlock huffs. “Yes, thank you ever so much for the rescue, dear brother, the likes of which never would have been necessary in the first place had your brain-dead software developers had the common sense to program their apps to be
Sherlock can’t be sure if that means he’s had a few drinks, or drank his way through several bars. John’s tolerance for alcohol is notably higher than the average male of his age, which has led Sherlock to suspect he was once far more like his sister than he would ever care to admit.
“People do far weirder things for fun,” Sherlock replies. “Just look at us. We put our lives on the line to solve crimes. Don’t try to tell me we do it just so Graham’s lot can put their feet up for an afternoon.”
. I had no idea it would be so… populated. Luxury cruise?” He scoffs. “I’m finding it quite hateful so far. Inside, at least.”
After a visit to the loo, John returns to find Sherlock wide awake and wiping himself down with a handful of tissues. John momentarily forgets he isn’t wearing any pants.
“Here we are,” he affirms, his voice thin and falling silent as the weight of it sinks in. John spends long minutes carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, idly wondering if the nurses would let him wash it one of these days.
He sniffs his own shirt and promptly recoils. John screws up his nose, but a quiet giggle bubbles out of his chest despite himself. Maybe he’s right. He’s Sherlock, after all; the annoying git is always right, sometimes seeming to know John even better than he knows himself. It’s part of why John has always trusted his judgement almost without question, as uncomfortable it may be to admit that he can be read as easily as an open book. Especially given how often he struggles to read his own pages. But that’s irrational, he knows, because to Sherlock
At some point in the next several hours he must have nodded off to sleep in his chair. The next thing he knew, the morning sun was spilling in wide rectangles across the carpet of the living room, and there were sounds of movement from upstairs.
And somewhere outside his dream he can hear that same voice saying, “They don’t know if,” and “I’ll call you when,” and “He might never.”
John is about to make up some excuse to order him out when Sherlock pipes up. “It’s fine. Mycroft is just protective of his assets. God forbid he should need to hire somebody else to do his legwork.”
“Woah, hang on a minute,” John said, sitting forward in his chair, “so it’d just be the blokes playing a kissing game while the ladies watch? Is that what you’re suggesting?”
“Not once during our association have you ever declined to pursue a case to its fullest end. That alone was my first clue that something was different about this one. I must admit, I couldn’t quite figure out what the issue was at first, but once I had ruled out the impossible only the improbable remained: It seems that somehow, in all your years and despite your Army training you never learnt to swim. Such an unlikely outcome suggests you went out of your way to avoid it. Avoidance suggests fear, ergo you fear being anywhere near water.
dangerous. But even as he was cursing Sherlock’s choice, he was unabashedly loving this— exposing himself in full view of the security cameras, jerking his penis to a room full of art aficionados. All it would take is for just
“It is of great use to the sailor to know the length of his line, though he cannot with it fathom all the depths of the ocean.” —
“Oi, give me a little credit,” John says, nudging his shoulder. “I was making a few friends, that’s all. Couldn’t say no to a few drinks. Chatted up some of the stewardesses while I was at it.”
Electing not to waltz back into the living room half naked, John heads upstairs to his room and re-clothes himself there.
“God. I haven’t come like that in… in…” He let out a deep sigh, barely able to muster the energy to form a coherent sentence. His lids felt heavy. He really could fall asleep like this, in Sherlock’s arms, except there was the slightly inconvenient matter of the mess drying over his stomach to deal with.
“Could still be fear,” John countered. “Sherlock, this isn’t proving anything. I know what you’re trying to do, but—”
He couldn’t stand the thought of Sherlock forcing himself to perform ‘favours’ in exchange for drugs. It must have been clouding his expression, because Sherlock sat up then, kneeling over him. His fingers traced lazy patterns over John’s abs.
The sound of his voice is a symphony to John’s ears. “Oh, thank God,” he whispers, shuffling closer to cup Sherlock’s warm cheek with his hand. He’s grinning like a fool, but he doesn’t care; he feels like the happiest sod on Earth just to see Sherlock’s eyes following him, awake, alive. Sherlock takes his hand and holds it there, a simple gesture that conveys his permission and understanding and affection while his eyes sparkle with even more emotions all vying at once to be expressed.
“And even if they did,” John continued, his thumbs stroking over the edges of Sherlock's cheekbones. “I doubt they would’ve done it in front of a crowd.”
It takes a few seconds for his intent to sink in. When it does, John digs his heels into the floor. His forehead creases with growing concern. “Sherlock.” His eyes grow impossibly wide. “Sherlock, don’t.” He shoves against Sherlock’s chest, but his grip is like a vice, and every effort to push him away only bringing John helplessly along with it. “I’m warning you, Sherlock. Don’t you
Sherlock nods, peering down at his bare feet. Some of the tension ebbs from the air between them. When he looks back up his expression is soft, almost vulnerable. A single drop of liquid falls from his hair and tracks down his cheek. “Exposure therapy,” he says. “I found it in one of your medical books. It’s supposed to be shocking at first, but I didn’t imagine you would be quite so affected. If I had known…”
John gives the same automatic assurances he has done for the past three nights, and then enters the room.
Mycroft, looking more well-put together now than John has seen in the past few days, leans casually on his umbrella. “So glad to see you awake at last, little brother. I trust you had a pleasant sleep?”
“Neither of us want to go back, John. We’ve always been something more than just friends. Everybody picks up on it. Why don’t we just acknowledge it, at last?”
John turns the key over in his palm. The offer is undeniably tempting. Watching Mindy leave, he almost misses the man who emerges from the kitchen area and follows her out of the café.
John sensed that something had change enormously in Sherlock’s tone between the first and second kiss, and he wasn’t entirely sure it was on purpose. He seemed to have lost any semblance of control, forgotten what was even the point of this, beyond the apparent pleasure of simply kissing him. Whatever was happening right now, neither of them seemed to be playing the game any longer. They were really just… kissing. All pretence seemed to have been forgotten and left behind, as was anybody else in the room. In that moment, it was just the two of them. He tried to speak, but when he felt the tip of Sherlock’s tongue run delicately, pleadingly along his lower lip, John very nearly trembled into him. He opened his mouth, an invitation that was readily accepted, and now there was definitely
“Depends how long it takes to find him,” Sherlock says. “It’s a big ship. There’ll be close to a thousand crew members on board, and three times as many passengers. Even with the description the girl gave us, it’s going to take a while to pick him out, if he’s even still there.”
Sherlock’s fingers took hold of him through his jeans, stroking slowly. John could do nothing but sigh and drape his arms over Sherlock’s shoulders, powerless under his ministrations. Sherlock bent low to nuzzle at John’s neck again, finding that sweet spot just beneath his ear that made him shudder and clutch fistfuls Sherlock’s shirt.
“Nothing unusual. Just… stimulation. I’ll be inside my Mind Palace, so I won’t even experience it. I won’t see, hear, or feel it. But my body will respond. I just need relief, John. Please?”
But Sherlock looked at him fondly. “I can think of nothing I’d find more satisfying than fulfilling your physical needs, along with everything else. It wouldn’t make me uncomfortable. If it did, would I still be doing the things I do for you when we’re outside?”
“John. Stop.” John turned to look at him, and that was a mistake. Sherlock’s uncharacteristically open expression told John everything he didn’t want to know about the conversation they were about to have.
By the time they were rescued, he was dying not only of his wound and blood loss, but of his generally weakened state. At some point he slipped below the threshold of what his heart could endure and went into ventricular fibrillation. For how long, they don’t know. If it was more than a few minutes he could be brain-dead.
Before they leave, Sherlock drags them through the departure lounge and into a boutique store where racks of truly hideous plastic sunglasses sit on display. After minutes of indecision, he begrudgingly selects the least awful-looking pair he can find, and John thanks him to finally be leaving the place. On their way out, Sherlock catches his reflection in a window and cringes at the sight of it. Cheap plastic, a garish shade of red, the frame sits heavy and too high on the bridge of his nose. John says nothing, but covers his mouth and emits a stifled noise that he swears was just a cough.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. John laughed. And just like that, they were back to their old selves, conversation spiralling into weird tangents about sex and the bizarre things people do about it.
John uses the opportunity to stretch his legs a bit. After letting the nurses know about Sherlock’s condition, he takes a walk outside, enjoying the fresh air that isn’t laced with the clinical smells of antiseptic and lemon cleaner. He finds a bench and sits by himself, letting the breeze cool his face as he watches the cars come and go along the busy streets, a familiar ache flaring to life at the back of his mind.
“Can’t wait to put my feet up,” John says, shucking his coat. “I expect even you’ll be wanting a kip after all this, eh?”
“It would be a remarkably useful means of predicting the evening’s weather if they weren’t mostly obscured by the stratus and cumulus layers. Pity, that.”
John struggles with his phone in futility, muttering an array of colourful curses under his breath. Sherlock ignores it, secretly pleased with himself. There’ll probably be no need for Mycroft’s little toy, but one can never be too careful. He fishes a partially-squashed packet of airline peanuts from his pocket. He pops it open, flinching at the burst of salt that invades the air. John generally responds positively to the sight of him eating. Crunching a peanut between his teeth, he keeps a surreptitious eye out for John’s reaction. It soon does the trick; when John finally looks up from his screen and notices him, the lines of frustration around his eyes smooth out.
Sitting across from him in his favourite chair, John frowns down at his soggy feet and says, “Are you running a bath? I think you left the taps on.”
The rest of the day passes far too quickly. Just learning the shift schedule chews up several precious hours. He scans each face he encounters, building a mental picture of the crew, but progress is slow and there isn’t enough time to catalogue everybody before the shift changes, leaving broad gaps in his collection. Nobody he’s seen so far fits the profile of the man they’re searching for, and every moment he goes unchecked could spell doom for some unfortunate passenger.
It takes him a few seconds to realise it’s his phone, but the sound is one he’s never heard before. It repeats itself, a quiet tinkling of bells, and it’s a discordant harmony in the midst of this violent, life-or-death struggle, enough to tickle a disbelieving laugh from his heaving lungs. Life’s too fucking strange, sometimes.
John throws up his hands to argue, but Sherlock interrupts before he can get a word in. “You had ample time to get some hours in last night. It isn’t my fault you chose instead to spend most of that time restlessly pacing about your room for some unfathomable reason—”
He doesn’t fall back immediately. John is smart; he calls out periodically, seeking a reply, just as Sherlock knew he would. But as the night wears on, it happens less and less. When he can give no more, Sherlock allows himself to drift behind, until the sounds of John’s arms and legs swooshing through the water grows ever more distant. John doesn’t notice, can’t see behind him to realise that he’s not being followed anymore.
Sherlock gasped. He’d totally forgotten they weren’t alone. His head spun around in panic, fully expecting to meet a gaggle of shocked faces. But the seats around the coffee table were vacant. Nobody was there. He made a small, confused noise.
Sherlock chews his lip, his eyes full of emotion, and it doesn’t matter what he’ll say; John will always forgive him. How could he not? Sherlock’s mistakes may often be dramatic, even perilous. But to err is human, and under a strange kind of logic that makes him the most
As far as babysitting goes he’d better make the most of their reprieve while it lasts, because Sherlock seems intent on them jetting off to another continent and there's no point in arguing. They haven’t been home in days and his feet are blistered, arse sore from hours sat on hard plastic chairs down at the police station. Two weeks is a long time for any case, but especially one having involved mad chases across half of Europe on the tail of a missing girl. It was one long race against time until they finally brought her home safe and sound.
?” she presses. The question strikes a nerve. Maybe there have been lingering glances on occasion. An odd spark in the air, moments of tense silence after a chase, when the criminal is caught and the only sound in their ears is their heaving breaths and wheezing, disbelieving laughter. But it’s the cases that get Sherlock’s heart pumping and his adrenaline flowing. Of course there’s going to be odd moments; that’s just the nature of the beast.
He took a step into the room. The bed was immaculately made; all neat, military corners, and several of John’s bedside possessions were missing, the surfaces they had once adorned looking unnaturally bare in their absence. “But, why?”
Once it began, he couldn’t stop it. The air was forced out of his lungs as he came, groaning helplessly into Sherlock’s shirt collar. His hips jerked up, hard, meeting the solid resistance of Sherlock’s thigh as his whole body tried to curl against Sherlock’s pinning weight. His fists clenched tight behind his back and his toes curled in the confines of their shoes. A litany of ‘pleases’ and ‘Sherlocks’ spilled from his lips as his cock pulsed between them, thick and hot.
“God, we’ve made a mess,” he said, grinning as he stepped closer to pluck the star from Sherlock’s brow. It was the faintest of touches, but Sherlock’s breath hitched, a small noise that sent an unexpected shiver down his spine. Their eyes locked for a moment, and it almost seemed as though they were both waiting for the other to make some move. To pull back, or perhaps lean in…
’. Sherlock’s manipulations may be self-serving, just like Mindy’s probably are, but it’s clear from the way he flushes up with pleasure that he wants nothing else from John but John himself; he gains nothing from having John by his side than the simple pleasure of his company and companionship.
When they broke apart, they were both panting. Sherlock felt overwhelmed; wanted nothing more than to go back to that wet heat, but he had to rally himself. This was it: The final test. If this didn’t convince John of his desire to please him in all the ways they both wanted, then nothing would.
John finds he's enjoying this far more than he has any right to, and he’s quickly losing his inhibitions. Wetting his lips, he takes the cock head into his mouth, giving it a firm suck. Another twitch, a sound like an elongated
He continues to haunt the busy junctions between decks like a unfettered ghost, familiarising himself with the evening crew. He makes some progress, but he can only cover a single deck at a time. When the shifts change again, a fresh set of data has to be collated. This mission is beginning to unsettle him. Something seems not quite right, like he’s forgetting something, but he pushes it to the back of his mind. He’s just getting frustrated. He can do this.
Now that the moment had arrived, was he having second thoughts? John wanted there to be no regrets. If Sherlock wasn’t ready for this, he wouldn’t push him to it. It was better to be safe than sorry.
After several failed escape attempts, John finally managed to separate himself from Sherlock’s insistent mouth, pulling back just an inch or two. Slowly, he slipped the scarf upward and blinked open his eyes. The first thing he saw was Sherlock’s swollen lips, parted and glistening, and had to resist a strong urge to dive right back into them again. Then he lifted his eyes and met Sherlock’s intense, worried gaze.
“Not here,” he said with an enigmatic smile. “Later. I want it to be special. Not in some four star hotel room.”
Experimentally, he places a hand over Sherlock's groin, looking up to gauge his reaction - if any - and finding nothing. At least, not in his expression. His manhood, however, seems immediately responsive to the attention. Probably starved for it, poor thing. John gently kneads the flesh through the fabric, feeling it grow even harder under his hand. It shouldn't affect him, but John is having a sympathetic reaction, his own cock growing rather thick in his jeans.
John sinks beneath the surface with a sharp gurgle. Overtaken by instinct, he panics like a deer crashing through a school window. Feral and unseeing, he flails wildly beneath the water, but Sherlock is there in a flash to lift him up. When John re-emerges, he coughs out a mouthful of water.
John hadn’t even realised they’d both eventually fallen asleep. He wakes when Sherlock stirs in his arms and stretches his long legs with an accompanying yawn, before curling back into himself like a cat. London’s sky is already dark outside their windows.
Being a doctor — and a bisexual, to boot — John had seen his fair share of cock and balls. As such things went, he found Sherlock’s to be on the prettier side. The member seemed average in length, though it was impossible to tell for sure unless he was to somehow get an erection. It was slightly darker than the rest of his complexion, but not visually striking.
“I’m getting a little cold,” Sherlock said at last, looking sheepish with a finger playing at his lip.
.” And with that, Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a deep, steady breath. His hands drop to his sides and he goes entirely limp from head to toe, like his brain let go of the steering wheel and jumped out of the car.
As he undoes Sherlock’s trouser button and unzips his fly, he’s having second thoughts about doing this. Touching someone without their knowledge - even with their full consent - just doesn't seem kosher to him. Nevertheless, he’s apparently agreed to the troublesome task, and now he watches Sherlock’s absent expression as he pulls down the man’s trousers and pants, his mouth oddly thick with saliva as he watches the flushed and swollen penis spring free of its confines.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed. “John, I… had a dream. Except now I think about it, it might’ve been real.”
Sherlock’s mouth quirks. “I bet. Come on, let’s go get settled in our rooms. Freshen up. The stink of us probably isn’t helping matters.”
He’s not sure what he expected, but this is the smallest hotel room he’s ever stayed at. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. The bed is squeezed into the middle and dominates most of the available floor space. A single door off to the side leads to a marble-tiled bathroom, and one of the walls contains an inbuilt wardrobe with a sliding door designed to take up as little room as possible. The decor is a bit modern for his tastes, but the cramped feel of the room is familiar in a way that feels secure, if not quite what he was imagining as ‘luxury’. But it'll do. Maybe it’s old habits lingering way past their due, but John hasn’t felt comfortable sleeping in too-open spaces since before his serving days. At least sleeping here won’t be too much of a hardship.
John pushes away from the rail. “God knows, I’d be useless trying to do all this. It’s bloody impressive, I’ll give you that. The world needs more of you. You’re bloody amazing, you know.”
The flesh is dark pink, its bulbous head already glistening with pre-cum. Well, it's good to see that he's responding to some degree. With a glance to make extra sure Sherlock is still under, John wraps his hand back around it and resumes pumping. The sight of it squeezing through his fist is surprisingly hot, even if this is supposed to be a strictly medical procedure. John is achingly hard already.
“We should go home,” he suggested, and gave Sherlock a look that communicated the rest of his meaning. His friend knew it well. They were about to leave when a group approached them, singing as they hung multi-coloured lanyards around their necks and pecking their cheeks with friendly kisses.
Steeling his nerves, John steps boldly out of the shadows. “Petrov. Put it down, and step away from her. Now.”
John laughed softly, cupping Sherlock's face with his hands and allowing himself another brief, sweet kiss, which made Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed again for a second. John’s heart leapt with fondness. He really could be utterly clueless, sometimes.
John clenched his jaw and squeezed his eyes shut, but nothing could block out the sensation of Sherlock rubbing against him, dragging over his cock, increasing in speed and pressure as the binds around them gradually loosened. John was losing himself to the pleasure, the world narrowing down to the tightening of his muscles and the bubbling fire preparing to erupt in his groin. The urge to rut up and finish it was becoming an almost unbearable temptation.
“That’s not true,” he said, biting his lip. “You know what I’m like. For me, sex and romance are two sides of the same coin. I can’t have one without the other.” John looked down at their joined hands, and Sherlock felt something wet splash against his skin. “I can’t,” he choked, shaking his head. “I can’t ask you to be something you’re not. It wouldn’t be fair on you, and I’d hate myself for it in the end.”
John wouldn’t even be here if it wasn’t for Sherlock’s stubborn, reckless pursuit of Mikhail. If he makes it back at all, it will be insufficient as a token of apology, but at least it will be the most selfless way he could ever express it.
“You didn’t even get hard!” John’s voice rang out loud in the street. On the opposite pavement, a lone passer-by glanced their way, giving them an odd look. Sherlock glared at her in return.
of it. The hammering rhythm of his heart. The sound of his voice in his ear, deep, thick as dark chocolate and smooth as velvet. Luxurious. John’s every sense: Sherlock.
“A card?” John narrowed his eyes in puzzlement. “You’re actually… making a birthday card. From scratch.”
The way he says it gives John pause. He drags his chair over to the bed. “Okay. I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”
“I’m not sure I can,” he admits. “I’ve felt so bloody useless these past few days. You have no idea how happy I am to see you awake. You could ask me for pretty much anything right now and I’d do it.”
Sherlock's soft tongue playfully caressed him as John's own more urgently licked and explored the warmth of Sherlock's mouth. John was panting into Sherlock’s steadier, but equally needful breaths, both of them smelling and tasting like barbecue chicken. At any other time that would probably have been gross, but right now he didn’t care, because at the same time his hand was wildly pumping his cock, and he dimly realised
If only she knew how lucky she’d struck with that particular gem. Because as it turns out, Sherlock can only achieve orgasm when he's retreated into his Mind Palace, divorcing body from mind. It’s all too noisy in his head, he explains, such that he isn’t able to concentrate fully on the physical pleasure in order to allow it to overtake him. His brain simply won’t relinquish control long enough to let it happen.
He hummed, his eyes crinkling with a smile. “To be able to express how much I adore you, and see the answer in your eyes,”—A slender hand snaked down between them—”and feel the fullness of it, here.”
Their arms wrapped around each other, a quiet desperation pulling them closer. Sherlock managed to steer John away from the suitcase at their feet and pressed him back against the wall, crowding flush against his body. John’s erection was full and solid against Sherlock’s thigh; he deliberately moved his leg to tease along it.
About an hour before they were due to leave, John knocked on the door to Sherlock’s room and was let inside. He sat nervously on the edge of the bed, quite obviously preoccupied with some matter on his mind. Eventually Sherlock had to sit next to him and force it out.
John grabs the bag and tosses it towards him. “I’m going back to my room. Have fun up here by yourself.”
He keened into Sherlock, who cupped John’s cheek with his hand as John’s face drew tight in pleasure. He whimpered and moaned helplessly into Sherlock’s mouth as he came. Sherlock captured his tongue between his wetted lips and sucked on it, further encouraging the shudders of orgasm crashing like waves through John’s body. John felt his cum pooling against his fist in the bottom of the cardboard box, which Sherlock was helpfully keeping held in place lest it suddenly get knocked away in front of an entire stadium of watchers.
“Told you you should have skipped breakfast,” Sherlock deadpans, being a solid wall of support at his back. John almost laughs between groans, too overloaded to truly care about the ridiculousness of their current position. When the spasms eventually taper off he straightens up, bleary-eyed and dazed. Ever one step ahead, Sherlock is ready with a tissue. “Trust me, you’ll get used to it.”
He isn’t sure what he just read. Whatever it was, it’s useless and barely legible. The nausea must have returned full force to be having that kind of effect on him. Poor John. The sooner Sherlock does something to resolve his seasickness, the better for them both. He shoves his phone back into his pocket with a sigh. As usual, the hard part is going to be all down to him.
As the national anthem was being sung, Sherlock re-appeared next to him holding a big box of chicken wings, handing them over while he sat.
His hands twitch at his sides, caught between action and inaction, lost between the desire to fly past them and attempt to reach help but knowing they would block his escape that very instant.
Mrs Hudson leaned forward and placed a hand on his knee, ever the doting mother-figure to her boys. “Don’t tease them, luv.” John flashed her a thankful smile.
John shoots him a glare that could curdle milk, but can’t help his eye being drawn back to the monstrosity that sits waiting for them like the ferry to Hades. His stomach attempting a flip. “It's… enormous. The captain’s name isn’t Charon, is it? I spent my last Danake on the horses.”
Despite his hesitance to allow himself to be swayed, John seemed willing to allow this. “What did you have in mind?”
you are. You’re not going anywhere, Sherlock Holmes.” She tips her head to the side, pushing her bottom lip out in an exaggerated display. “Sorry about your beau. You regret not fucking him when you had the chance? Too late now.”
If there’s one thing she could never be accused of, Sherlock had muttered to John as the drug was taking its course, it’s having an original idea.
John found out who his real friends were that day. The experience wasn’t the beginning of his hydrophobia, but it sure piled on the damage.
He flashes a humorous look. “I think you mean 'under'. So, why exactly are we up here? You said it was important.” His eyes flit between Sherlock and the pool behind him, narrowing as the supicion creeps up on him like a tiger in the grass.
His cheeks flush. His mouth couldn’t pull any wider, but it certainly tries. “You just keep on being you. Trust me, this won’t be going away anytime soon.”
Mikhail bursts into laughter, a guttural roar of noise that makes Mindy flinch and drop her cigarette. “You talk rubbish! Get out of here,
Sherlock’s fingertip applied a gentle pressure under John’s chin, raising his face slightly. Still he waited, moved no closer. His breath was still held. It was a little unnerving. Another long ten seconds passed, and John began fidgeting, finding it increasingly difficult to resist the urge to lean forward and initiate the action himself. His back was warming from the burning fire behind him, the soft crackling and spitting of the logs the only sounds interrupting the tense silence of the room.
Having unbuttoned his cuffs, Sherlock shrugged his shirt off. His torso was lean, but not gaunt, and the firm muscles beneath his skin belied a hidden strength. He had a dusting of dark hair across his chest, and the iliac crest of his navel disappeared under the hem of his trousers, a natural valley for the eye to be drawn along, making an enticing promise of the rest of his anatomy.
Anderson broke out into laughter. “Well, you asked for it,” he said, taking great delight in his boss’ misfortune. John hopped up and approached the coat rack by the front door, unhooked one of Sherlock’s long navy scarves and tossed it unceremoniously over Anderson’s head to Greg.
"john and sherlock doing crafts together on the floor of 221b. quarreling over colors and glitter and themes and aesthetic and soft little exclamations of oh I quite like that" - I don't remember whose prompt this was, but if I find out, I'll edit it in!
Then for long, quiet minutes they simply look at each other. John is transfixed by the colour in his eyes, so bright now compared to the dull greyness they had faded to before. Sherlock returns his gaze with an unreadable expression. He’s probably trying to get a read on John’s sudden nervous energy.
Without breaking eye-contact, John digs into the bag and pulls out a pair of swimming trunks not unlike Sherlock’s own, except for their pattern. He shakes them in the air for emphasis. “This is not happening.”
He can see the argument dancing at the threshold of Sherlock’s lips, held back by a conscious effort. At least he’s trying. However, a question manages to slip free. “How is it you never learnt to swim? You went through basic training.”
“Oh, you will,” he teases, grinning into his cup. “Unless you plan to spend every minute in the shade. Spanish summers can be pretty intense.”
He felt the familiar pressure building as his balls filled up with sperm. Sherlock had turned to face him now, always seeming to know with a keen sixth sense when John was getting closer. He watched John from afar, locking eyes with him but making no attempt to move in, and John’s speeding heartbeat hammered with a heady mix of fear and excitement that pulsed in his ears and through the veins of his cock.
“Not another word out of you,” he chokes out, barely keeping them both supported. Treading water for two is more difficult than he’d imagined; even Sherlock’s light weight is cumbersome, like trying to hold onto a bag of rocks. His legs are stiff and numbing as he works them past the point of endurance. Sherlock makes an attempt to support his own weight, but his movements are uncoordinated and weak, only serving to unbalance them further, and the waves begin to lap over their mouths and ears.
Greg wrapped the scarf around his own eyes and tied it loosely behind his head. Satisfied with the fit of his blindfold, he clapped his hands together. “Okay, now someone else spin the bottle again, and whoever the lucky lass or lad is gets to give me a peck on the cheek. Then I’ll see if I can guess who it was. If I get it right, they have to drink.”
Not that it’s such a bad thing, he supposes. Save for one or two things he keeps shoved to the very back of his mind and doesn’t care to examine if he can possibly help it, he considers himself a very simple man with not much in the way of secrets to hide.
But it’s too late; Sherlock’s mind is sparking with questions and leaping to conclusions and bubbling with ideas, and oh, this
“Wh-what are you doing?” John stammered, finding his hand suddenly trapped between them. Despite this, he was still fumbling to pull down his fly, even with his friend enclosing him with his body. He had no control over it.
All the while, Sherlock’s sharp eyes fixated on him, wide-eyed and enthralled by the powerful reaction he’d wrought out of the body beneath him. His fist, still wrapped around John’s relaxing member, massaged him through the remnant aftershocks. After what felt like an eternity, John went boneless beneath him.
John grits his teeth and peeks his head through the door, feeling all too conspicuous. If someone spots him now, he’ll get kicked out by security and lose the trail. He can’t let that happen. He glances both ways before his eyes alight on Mindy and the bald man twenty metres ahead of him.
John stops a meter from him, wriggling himself upright with effort. “How the bloody hell am I supposed to breath?”
It didn’t make sense. Didn’t fit his character. John was not one to judge other people by such shallow criteria, least of all Sherlock himself. He had always been one of the most accepting and understanding people he’d ever had the good fortune to know.
He presses his lips into a thin line. He’s been expecting this, if not at all looking forward to it. It’s not that he doesn’t want to tell him, but those are memories he’d rather not dredge up again. Not here, not like this.
Indeed, the man was positively glowing, as if he’d been the one to have just had the most mind-blowing orgasm of his life. To look at them both, John doubts anybody would have been able to tell the difference.
In university, his classmates made sure to include him only up to a point where they could copy his notes and borrow his brain for their assignments. He was more human calculator than social equal. But he allowed it, because as shallow and self-serving as it was, some sad part of him had always thrived on the praise of others. Even now, the Yarders kept on tenuously amiable terms with him, only because they had too many murders to solve and not enough braincells between them to accomplish it.
Half-time arrived, and the players filtered out of the field. To John’s relief (and slight disappointment, if he was honest) not many people around them got out of their seats, leaving them mostly undisturbed.
He glances up. “Well I could spoil it for you, if you really want. But you’re going to be stuck here for a while. There’s only so many crossword books I can pinch for you from the waiting rooms.”
. Is that what Sherlock did on the plane— install a tracking device on his phone? Couldn’t he at least have put it on silent, for Christ's sake? Now they'll be ready for him. He’ll be walking right into a trap! The kick of adrenaline sends a renewed burst of energy surging through his limbs. He twists in Mikhail’s grip, managing to wrench an arm free, and swinging his fist over his shoulder he makes solid contact with the man’s face. Mikhail grunts and stumbles back, but doesn’t release him. A second later, John’s nose breaks with a sickening crack beneath a well-placed punch.
The punch gave a sickening crack. As he clambering to his feet, he sees the woman cringing and shaking out her broken fist. He has but a split-second to think as Mikhail closes in again. Facing a hopeless battle, the decision is easy to make.
“Actually, I lied.” Caging him in between his slender, powerful arms, Sherlock drew close enough that his breath ghosted across his mouth. Their noses touched, and John’s heart hammered in his chest. His eyes fluttered closed.
“—Point being, how could I have planned that? You chose to come along, John. And while I'm happy that you did, that's on you.”
His friend had died. John had blamed himself for it, and Sherlock could tell, just by the look in his eyes, that he would have given anything to take his place on the sand.
In hindsight, it was even more of a shock that Sherlock had managed to reject him in a manner that was surprisingly gentle for the ‘high-functioning sociopath’. But, well, they both knew that label didn’t entirely apply. Though Sherlock preferred to maintain the myth for his public image, given their living arrangements, it was impossible to hide his true nature from John for long.
But like most boys his age, he’d sometimes forget to heed this warning, and there came a day that would alter his perceptions of himself forever.
Sherlock listened carefully. He could distinguish John’s footsteps, drawers being opened, and something fabric being dropped to the floor. A zipper opening. Indeterminate rustling. The zipper closed. He didn’t like these sounds; they weren’t part of John’s normal morning routine.
He pressed the hard length of his cock against Sherlock’s thigh, glancing up into his eyes just to make sure his friend — no, his
“Doctor Watson, you— That— How dare you?” Mycroft squeaks, clearly unaccustomed to being stood up to. “That umbrella is not just— It contains sensitive government data, which I—”
“So the problem is me, then.” Checkmate. Sherlock turns away, nodding decisively to himself. “I worried as much. I should have noticed sooner. Your tolerance of me is notably higher than most, but I suppose everybody has their limits.”
In the face of John preparing to remove himself from Sherlock’s life for good, Sherlock could find no other desire in his heart than to keep him here. Not to be his blogger, and not so that Sherlock would have a companion to accompany him on cases, but because Sherlock
John glues himself to the shadows as he advances until, at last, he spots her. Mindy stands at the far end of the small cubby, an unlit cigarette caught between her fingers. She’s facing his way, but doesn’t seem to notice him on account of who stands between them.
Air whistles through John’s lips. “’Tis a tall order. You sure we couldn’t have just gotten the captain’s help?”
But that was perhaps a discussion to have at another time. John wrapped a long-overdue hand around his hard length and began stroking himself, watching Sherlock’s face. Far from appearing bored, he watched John with a sort of quiet fascination. For him, sexual pleasure didn’t really exist, and he observed it more as a scientific oddity, something to be studied and probed but never experienced — and John found that equally as exciting as he sat over him, his arse resting against the soft flesh of Sherlock's penis.
“Uh, before you get too carried away,” John hedged, “maybe you should try a different approach to this. Something that will end up looking a bit less like a threatening note from a kidnapper.”
A bump in the road shifted their position by a degree, causing Sherlock’s hips to grind directly along John’s half-hard cock, and a helpless moan escaped John’s throat before he could prevent it.
“There. At least direction can’t give it away now.” He sat back down and tied the scarf back around his head. “I’ll go again. Let’s give it a proper try this time, eh?”
“That’s what’s bothering you?” he asked, not trying to hide the bewilderment in his voice. “That I didn’t get an erection?” He supposed that made sense. Perhaps John worried there was something wrong with having reacted that way, that it made him a pervert, perhaps? “Would you have preferred if I had?”
“You could have offered,” John says offhandedly, because it’s been bothering him for days and he didn’t quite have the courage or the energy to say it before now. “I did. They wouldn’t take mine because I’m not a match.”
John can’t blame him. From his clipped sentences to the way his hands clench and release in his lap, it wouldn’t take the world’s only Consulting Detective to see that he’s working up the courage for something. If he’s going to say it, now is the time to do so, when everything is quiet and there are no distractions and he’s feeling uncharacteristically open and expressive. They’ve been given a second chance to lay their cards on the table; for once in his life, John is going to be honest with himself.
In another life, perhaps he would have lived here instead, on the open sea, far from all the noise and the people. Not on a cruise ship; he isn’t that insulated from the noise of the inner decks. But perhaps he’d be a sailor. Or a pirate. It would be a life of near-solitude, and he would guard it fiercely. And though there was once a time when he couldn’t have imagined sharing such a life with anyone else, now he couldn’t dream of it without John by his side. As much as he values being alone, John is unique, the only person whose company he finds tolerable, and in many instances, welcomed.
Sherlock hasn't moved or made a sound, and his face is placid and relaxed. Feeling a bit bolder, John grips his hard length through the material and gives it a squeeze, then begins to stroke it with a slow, steady rhythm. Would this be enough to make him cum, he wonders?
He’d surprised even himself with his forwardness, but poor Sherlock had looked downright panicked by the advance. It was so sudden, so unexpected, that Sherlock had been forced to let him down in no uncertain terms.
Sherlock rose slowly from his seat and approached him. Then, leaning down, he spoke in a tone several shades lower than John had ever heard. “Yes, actually.” John daren’t move an inch as Sherlock’s slender fingers came up and found his lip, pressing it gently.
He barely had the presence of mind to climb off of Sherlock and collapse next to him on the bed, rather than on top of him and the rapidly cooling puddle of cum on his chest. He buried his face in the pillow as he fought to steady his breath, and was nearly dozing when Sherlock’s voice interrupted the quiet air.
us lot smothering you in kisses?” Greg asked, incredulous. But he was grinning at the notion. Honestly, it wasn’t that much of a surprise to realise just how touch-starved a man like Sherlock must be. It was no wonder he was so eager to stay in the kissee’s chair. But the denial came quick and automatic.
The air is thick with tension. At any moment Mikhail could attack either of them. John stands defenceless, and on the wrong side of the standoff to be any help. He has to find some way of defusing this before it gets any worse. He raises a hand, palm forward. “I’ll leave. Right after she does.” He risks a glance past Mikhail. “You alright, Mindy?”
“Sherlock?” he whispers, loathe to disturb his rest, but thinking this probably won’t be the most comfortable way to spend the night for either of them. Sherlock hums in response. “We should get you to bed, hmm?”
. Behind closed eyelids, John gazed into Sherlock’s eyes and saw those pupils blown wide with pleasure, and it was enough. It all was too much.
“What a case,” Sherlock agrees, swinging the front door shut behind them. He unwinds the scarf from his long neck and tosses it over a hook on the wall.
. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether he’s Sherlock’s friend or merely a live-in test subject for him to study and experiment on. But it's worth it, he supposes. Yeah, he could do a lot worse. He jokes, but living with Sherlock has been some of the best and most exciting years of his life. He wouldn't trade it for the world.
The bottle was spun again, and this time it came to a rest facing John. Silently cursing his luck, John pushed to his feet and approached Greg, mindful to quiet his breathing and not rustle his clothes, lest something give him away. God, this game was weird. If someone had told him he’d be giving one of Scotland Yard’s finest male Detective Inspectors a kiss tonight, he’d ask them for a glass of whatever they’ve been drinking. Nevertheless, the thought did give him a clever idea.
Recalling it sends a chill across his skin. What if John had come home an hour later? Or stayed at his girlfriend’s flat for the night? Between the neglect of his body and his dangerous chemical experiments, it’s a miracle Sherlock ever made it to adulthood without constant supervision. Then again, perhaps he did; the history of his and Mycroft’s upbringing are something John has never quite been brave enough to delve into.
He let go of Sherlock’s wrist then, his breath catching in his throat when those long, slim fingers curled around his cock. Their lips glided together again as John fumbled at Sherlock’s shirt buttons, hell-bent on getting his hands on the lean, muscular torso beneath.
He shakes his head again, a sad smile fighting past the grimace at his lips. “Nobody will miss me, John. I made sure of that. There has never been an excess of people wanting to call themselves a ‘friend of Sherlock Holmes’. I never wanted that kind of life. I only…” His eyes dance fitfully back and forth between John’s. “I just want…”
“No,” he agrees. “I plan to do whatever it takes to ensure you have sufficient cause to smile like that every day from now on.”
At first, Sherlock knew exactly what he was doing. Okay, so this wasn’t exactly his area. Of all the ways people could be observed and understood, Human intimacy was the one thing he’d never quite been able to crack. But he was an excellent mimic; even if he didn’t feel what others felt, he could still replicate their actions. It was a simple matter of mechanics. But here was a perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.
He’s standing on the MV Aurora cruise ship, wearing his heavy Belstaff, soaked through with seawater. Above him, a series of old, battered lifeboats sway precariously on their rusted hooks. He’s scrabbling at the handrail, trying to throw himself over it, but his feet are bolted to the deck and his voice won’t make a sound. John is in the water, glowing bright as a firefly in a jar. A burly voice with a thick Russian accent whispers in his ear, “You’re too late. He’s dead already,
“Then you’d better go get it then, hadn’t you?” John remarks, squaring his feet and crossing his arms. He won’t be intimidated. Not by him. Not even if Sherlock wasn’t lying there watching the whole thing unfold with a heated look in his eyes that sends sparks up and down John’s spine. Red-faced and fuming, Mycroft glances back and forth between them at a loss for words, and John feels the tiniest glimmer of pride at having momentarily broken his brain.
be respected,” Greg said pointedly. “Other than that, the kisser decides exactly how and where to kiss. On the face, mind. No funny business!”
They fall into an awkward silence. Mycroft’s presence has always unnerved him, but in a hospital ward it almost feels like having the Grim Reaper standing at his shoulder. They listen to the muffled sound of sheets being folded in the neighbouring room, clean fabric whispering through the air. The previous occupant passed away suddenly in the night.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “That’s an egregious exaggeration, John. It’s been closer to four days. Not a
Sherlock’s entirely correct observation that any embarrassment over the things he deduces about her is entirely her own doing had obviously not dissuaded her from getting revenge on him whenever possible. And tonight, it seemed, the prank of the day was spiking his drink with viagra.
“That wasn’t a proposal,” he assures. “Not yet, at least. We should probably at least go on a date first.”
“It won’t be easy. But you have the required strength and stamina to make it,” he says, bluffing as much confidence as he can muster. “Now, watch carefully. This is a rather advanced technique.”
The ride to the dock is, in a word, uncomfortable. The air conditioning in the cab is broken. Even rolling the windows down to their limits barely takes the edge off, leaving them sweltering in the midday heat. John’s shirt is soaked through with sweat in a matter of minutes, and though the cabbie apologises profusely in his thick Catalan accent, he doesn’t have the energy to complain.
John searched his face, his mind spinning the possibilities. Could they…? Could this really happen? It was no longer a question of whether either of them wanted it. They both wanted it. But there were still so many unknowns, so many risks he couldn’t foresee.
“It’s nothing lurid,” he promised. “Actually, what I have in mind is a bit different to the standard game.”
And with a nod and a smile to John, she hurried off towards the main exit, the clicking of her heels echoing through the quiet gallery, leaving Sherlock and John standing by the newly recovered painting on the wall. John glanced around. They weren’t alone, but true to Sherlock’s deductions the other visitors were generally filtering around the room in a clockwise fashion, rarely disturbing the pattern of traffic by turning back or crossing through the centre.
