about his feelings towards the man. It did, however, confirm that Pepper was more than likely right when she said Tony just needed to give it a chance.
Tony shrugged sheepishly, not wanting to explain that he was too out of it to get himself undressed. That seemed embarrassing, “Couldn't do it.”
"I'm surprised it lasted that long," Pepper mused, "Then again, you hurt his feelings, so he'll try his best to please until he realizes you're not actually upset with him. After that, it should be back to the regularly scheduled program."
, Steve stepped on the pants still bunched around Tony's ankles so he could step all the way out, leaving him in just his boxers for a moment until Steve helped him step into his pajama pants. Despite a shiver, he was unfazed, so Steve gently detached Tony's hands from his shirt, holding them in his own instead, "Good boy. Can you get your shirt off for me?"
“Won’t be a next time,” he proclaimed softly, more to himself than her. Sometimes, messing up was easy. This
After several minutes of even breathing and no movement, Steve began to shift Tony out of his arms and into the bed so he could tuck him in. It wasn’t too hard; since the submissive’s lower half was mostly already under his blankets, albeit messily. Still, Steve moved slowly and kept Tony’s head pressed to his chest until it hit the pillow. He stayed that way for a few minutes, awkwardly leaning over the sub before finally, very slowly, sitting back up. Tony briefly stirred, but once he found what must have been a comfortable position, he was out like a light.
“He’s embarrassed and he doesn't want to go to sleep, but he’ll be fine for a few minutes,” she spoke, sounding sure of herself before her demeanor suddenly changed, “Now, what
That sounded heavenly, but Tony didn't think he had the energy to do that. The spanking wore him out - they always did - and he was already running on very little sleep. Instead, he just squeezed his pillow a little tighter and whined, hoping Pepper would get the message and offer some encouragement. She knew him like the back of her hand, so of course, she knew what he wanted.
“You don’t get this a lot, do you?” Steve asked bringing up his other hand to cup Tony’s cheek when he started letting his head loll against his shoulder. When the submissive let his head rest in his hand and his eyes closed, he smiled, “Yeah. I can tell. Poor thing.”
That got him a quick nod; Tony tightened his grip on him in what Steve considered a genuine hug before going limp in his arms again. He was obviously happy with that answer.  The hug was the only response he got, though, before Tony was resting his head on his chest and closing his eyes again.
sensitive. Especially if he actually likes you, and it's even worse when he's down like this. You’ve got to watch what you say to him and
The question came out as a hiss that made even a tough, hardened Dominant like Steve shiver. The tone she was just using with Tony was nothing like this one, even when she was scolding him. This was a tone of flat out anger, and it became clear to Steve that it was directed at him.
While he drank, Steve noted that he probably shouldn’t let Tony go to sleep with his face as messy as it was. All of the crying had taken its toll on his poor face so Steve figured a warm rag could do him some good.
Pepper seemed intrigued as she listened and processed what he was telling her, and much to his surprise, she seemed to relax by the time he was finished. She stared at him again for a moment, appraising him before she allowed a small smile to play on her lips, "Okay, Steve. You have my blessing."
"I know you will," she answered warmly, patting his back and calming his nerves in a way only she could. He still was miserable - more mentally and emotionally than physically - but he was glad his Pepper believed in him, "And I know you're gonna try harder this time, aren't you, sweetheart?"
“Hey,” Steve greeted softly, grinning at the wide-and-wet-eyed Submissive in his lap. He pressed his fingertips against his scalp a little more firmly, smile widening when the tired eyes fluttered shut, "Yeah, you're a good boy."
“Tony?” Steve asked quietly one night when they were at one of Tony’s famous parties at the tower. Tony had been hiding from the mass amounts of people out on his balcony, and Steve had followed him once he’d noticed his absence, “What’re you doing out here?”
when he's down. All he wants is to be comforted - he just doesn't know how to ask, so sometimes he acts out."
, that couldn't be all of it. It was just Steve. For whatever reason, Steve had that effect on him. He'd just learned that the hard way.
Although, he would have been lying if he said he wasn’t a little nervous to be responsible for the sub all night. Especially since he already managed to upset him once, "Let's just hope I don't make him cry again before the nights over."
“A monarch can demand whatever they want and punish however they like when they are met with defiance.” She replied, her green eyes cutting.  “Is that really how you want to play this?”
"My children. Our noble friends," Bastet raised her arms to encompass the entire hall. "Let us dine together in celebration of this new union. And as reward for their valor, and being the swiftest to bring us the sacred Benu, I invite Queen Anthony and his consort to dine with me at the high table."
little Nyota stuck her tongue out at Jaime, with a shit starting grin if Tony had ever seen one, who glowered at her and made like he was going to try and shove more sand in her face. The third kit, a shy looking boy ducked out of the way before he could be trampled in the middle of the squabble.
Killian was moving and Natasha tracked him, keeping one eye on Tony as best she could. Killian was reaching for something on a nearby tray, a vial of some sort.
Clint outright cackled at that, and Tony had to cough into his hand to avoid joining him. Even Coulson was battling a smile as Steve just shrugged, that slow barely there smile of his appearing once more as the kid steamrolled on.
Tony screamed. At least he thought he did. He couldn’t control his body. There was a weight on him, holding him down even as pain twisted through every muscle until it was stinging bitterly in his teeth.
"Because Wakanda wants to observe us first before they break their code of isolation and invite us across their borders. They'll be sending people to asses you."
"Oh don't be an ass!" Turning to Mama Antonia grabs her hand. "You're here and so is he. A cold he tells me, this from the man who worked on our wedding day. Bah! Come now, what are we hanging around on the stoop for? We just finished breakfast but I'm sure there's something I can throw together. I baked the bread just yesterday. You remember Maria, my mother's recipe?"
Friends were good. So much more than he'd ever expected. So much more than he deserved, a familiar voice (sounding a shit ton like his dear departed not-father) whispered. Only that wasn't right was it? They wouldn't all be here, weathering out his moods and respecting his conditions if they didn't want to be. Steve definitely wouldn't be. Not unless he saw something worth sticking around for.
It wasn't much different than the kind of blather Tony suffered at a charity ball but unfortunately that just meant that he was already out of patience with it an hour in and without Pepper there to glare him into submission it was becoming increasingly obvious to his hosts that he wished they'd all go jump off a bridge.
"This isn't my first rodeo Rogers. You're not the first guy I've been with who wanted to walk on the wild side." Tony eyed the sign with distaste.
Ty was nuisance, but easily handled. His guardian Robert Stone on the other hand, headed Viastone, one of Stark Industries top competitors, and required a more delicate hand.
"I didn't mean to offend you Mr. Barton. My country is very different from yours. You and your pride are very interesting to a lot of people. I'm only curious how it works."
The prince had made quite the splash when he’d arrived, and nobody had missed how soundly he’d snubbed everyone save the Avengers and if they’d somehow slept through that he’d made his intentions for his stay on American soil very clear at the press conference that followed.
“Not your fault J, Good work.” Tony praised, taking off after Barnes, not needing to check that Natasha was right behind him. They had to get to Barnes before he got himself killed.
“Courting?” Natasha asked dryly, green eyes assessing the tom closey and Luke, apparently unbothered, smiled wider.
Father has just come from the temple so he is still bare chested, proudly displaying the tattoos that declare him the mate of the Queen of the Panther Pride and King of Wakanda. He was not surprised by the sudden attack but then again, father is a very good hunter, even for a man.
“Well I don’t know, but it would be cool if you could stop screeching in my ear.” Billy grumbled with a disgruntled look, leaning away from Kate who shot him an apologetic look.
He knew everything Vankov has tried to teach him before he even set foot in the door but the submarine is new, and Tony has so many ideas that could help, but Tony is stuck in the house
It didn’t necessarily mean that Steve wasn’t engaging with the rest of the team (because he participated in all of their shared meals and regularly sat with them on Friday nights) but it did call into question his level of personal investment.
“Castle Black.” Natasha finally turned away from the bed to look at Tony, one hand still set upon the blanket that half-covered Steve. Tony’s eyes caught hers as he stood up straighter in his chair, intent on every word she spoke. She’d left to speak to a contact of hers, because there were places too buried for even Tony to get to without some help to point him in the right direction and time was of the essence. “It’s a codename for a facility where the Russians have been engaged in human experiments. Cancer research mostly, but it’s a front for their real aim.”
“You call them Gata, as the Greeks did and moments ago Mrs. Fujikawa referred to them as Neko-Yokai. No one east or west refers to them by their true name and that to me seems the methodology of an oppressor.”
Tony doesn't learn till later that what he means is that when they were unloading slaves in Budapest that his great grandfather and all the other men from the island got tagged Rhodes because nobody cared what their names really were.
“Thor helped me make the ornaments.” Harley offered. “Mom taught me how to make a sled once, but I figured out how to make other stuff too. This is a manger for the Christmas goats.”
"You think he was hitting on me? But he's a -" Steve faltered, realizing belatedly that he still had no real idea what Sam’s designation was.
The voice on the other end of the line outright laughed, but it was neither villainous nor mocking. The sound of it was friendly, Tony would even go so far as to say genuine.
It had been a toss up between sending him or Natasha and Clint had wondered at first why he'd won out over her, because Clint was a good spy but Natasha was the spy and it was clear from the beginning that The Stark Job was too important to fuck up.
Something soft and firm curled around his tail, and a barely audible purr rumbled through the chest his ear was resting against. Tony didn’t open his eyes, but he smiled.
His repulsor blasts struck and let up a bunch of sparks and smoke but true to his prediction it did little more than cause the thing to drop a few feet in the air before it collected itself and turned all of its pissed off in Tony’s direction.
“This isn’t going to be easy, but I know who you are Stark. You’re too stubborn to give up that easily.”
The Avengers chose Bruce, as his skillset wasn’t exactly the most useful in a battle game like this and no one wanted a surprise appearance from Hulk, but from the castle mount it was easy for him to shoot a basic issue stun gun and practice keeping a cool head under potentially high stress situations. Clint seemed surprised when Team Wakanda chose not to utilize Thor as a heavy hitter and chose him as flagbearer but Tony wasn’t.
“Good thing she’s not here then,” Tony quipped, but there was no malice in it. It was kind of impossible to feel anything bad with that slow lazy warmth tickling down his throat and flushing through the rest of his body. Sunshine was the perfect name for it he thought with a contended sigh. “But hey, are you saying I’m a bad influence on you?”
It was give and take, and push and shove, and finding the same face looking back at you when all was said and done.
Ugh, there he went with the earnest face and the soothing scent that made her just want to curl up in a ball with him and purr the damn day away. Despite herself Nyota felt some of the fight begin to leak out of her.
“I wanted to be sure you slept.” T’Challa answered brightly as he approached, not at all concerned apparently that Tony might be angry to find him there. “Jarvis agreed with me that you were not likely to do so given your many worries, and while he forbade me from entering your private chambers his protocols said nothing of public hallways.”
“Dad didn’t step down from leading the team until the Civil War,” Teddy reminded everyone. He and Billy were curled up together to watch the news clip. Billy’s head was resting on his shoulder his eyes drooping sleepily. He’d been up late again, trying to grow his powers. He still thought it was his fault that he hadn’t been strong enough to save their parents, even when his own mother hadn’t been strong enough.
“You’re leaving?” Tony heard himself ask before he could stop the words and he felt like kicking himself. What was the matter with him anyway? Just out of surgery or not it wasn’t an excuse to be pathetic. Of course the guy was leaving. He was the prince of a foreign nation, only there on a diplomatic mission. Just because he’d risked his life to help save Tony’s, made him tea so good it was practically a narcotic, and laughed at his jokes didn’t mean he was going to move into the tower and offer to braid hair.
"I was working for Aldrich Killian at AIM... Advanced Idea Mechanics. Cute acronym, really lost its charm when I realized that I was working for a lunatic."
But Tony had been a (stupid) kit at the time and far too trusting. He'd thought himself in love with his oldest friend, and was pretty gob smacked that he was actually being allowed to be happy for once instead of shoved at some strange tom decades older than he was, as was the fate of many of their friends.
“Where’s Amory?” she asked, unable to stop the jolt of anxiety that went through her, already reaching out for the younger teen in her mind.
Ty was not a small man but the man in the literal cat suit was menacing. The long powerful line of his legs encased in the strangely supple metal - that if Tony didn't know it was impossible he would have sworn was vibranium – made it seemed like he could tower over anyone,  and the black material (whatever it actually was because it couldn't be vibranium) hugged every ripple and dip of muscle on his body without taking away from the litheness of his frame. And all that aside, he had the thickest, sharpest, looking claws on his hands and feet that Tony had ever seen and they were stained with blood.
“But you need me! I’m supposed to go with you, I can tell.” Harley insisted, lips pouting stubbornly. “We’re connected.”
Those chapters should take us through the events of Iron Man 3 (though they'll play out a bit different) and into Winter Soldier. After that, we're going to deviate heavily from the canon because they're catpeople and Tony's about to get hitched (and that should have told you everything). I'm projecting 15-20 chapters total.
“Oh good.” Tony sagged in relief, glad this trip wasn’t going to end with them shooting the bride before they even got off the bridge. "We're a little overcome ourselves so I guess it's a party."
"Of course, Ms. Romanov. Do you think a queen shares his heart and opens his house unless he is sure of absolute fealty? It is the way of man to befriend another in sunlight and betray him in darkness, but to bond in the way of the Alurio is to agree to walk in the shadow of another's heart where nothing can be hidden."
If he did, was Tony strong enough to survive that? Was he strong enough not to lash out and punish Steve for what he couldn’t control, all because he’d rushed in asking for something Steve wasn’t ready to give.
tell me?” Steve had demanded, already throwing things into the back of his truck, but he’d already known the answer even before he asked.
Some of the tension knotting Steve’s shoulders eased as Wilson barked a laugh. The warmth of it was telling, and the tom’s obvious confidence went a long way toward putting Steve at ease. Sam wasn’t taking offense to being called crazy, and he was obviously comfortable with Rhodes.
Bruce suspected that he might be suffering bond loss, which would explain why the bridges weren't building as quickly in Steve's brain as they were in some of the others. It would also explain some of the surplus bridges, the 'dark' areas that undoubtedly only worsened his struggling psyche. His brain was constantly trying to send messages over a broken system.
If there was anything Tony loved more than a good looking guy and a fast ride, it was driving said fast ride.
“Well that's a first," he finished weakly and Bruce huffed a laugh, purring gently at the sight of Tony's smile, wane as it was.
Just about when Clint had lost himself to his own thoughts, out of nowhere the guy murmured almost distractedly, "But in America it is custom, isn't it? You take the name of your masters."
Luke (oh look, the guy's name was floating around up there after all) shook his head, sipping serenely from his mug of coffee.
“Wow, did not see that coming.” Clint muttered under his breath and beside him Natasha growled lowly.
“He made me eat soap because I’m smarter than he is. And then I told him he couldn’t wash away the truth…” he confesses because he knows if he doesn’t, if he lies, it will be that much worse.
Tony was sitting in a rolling chair behind one of his computer consoles staring up at a holo-screen full of what appeared to be armor specs. His hunched posture and the glassy expression in his eyes made Steve think he wasn’t really paying the work much attention.
Feeling Tony’s stare he muttered quietly, “Been waiting for this part” and nodded towards the open doors of the jet.
Of course Steve didn’t understand why he was so pissed off. Why would he? He wasn’t the one constantly denied humanity and reduced to a dangerous animal. He wasn’t the one who had to simper and batt his eyelashes on cue to appease the masses when the question at hand was whether or not he and everyone like him should be caged like tigers in a zoo.
Tony took them deeper, taking more, coaxing with every movement of lip, and Steve’s hands gripped his waist and held tight; and just like that the kiss went from something controlled to something desperate burgeoning with all their pent up emotions.
"Sir, there is a visitor down in the front lobby that I believe you may find of interest." JARVIS interrupted Tony's mild panic to project security feed from the ground floor. The video showed the woman who ran the front desk speaking to a tall blond that Tony immediately recognized as Ty. He was accompanied by a younger woman who was gesturing franticly as she spoke.
She said it with such conviction Tony believed her, and that despite her deceptively youthful appearance, he was looking at someone far older than the twenty years her record granted her.
The sight of the livid bruising on his arm had been enough to distract her for a moment from the fact that apparently Peter had applied for a prestigious internship at Tony Stark’s brand-new tech start up, Stark Resilience without her permission. Long enough to send her on a rant about bullies and following him with a batt to school if the administration wasn’t going to put a stop to things. But not for
Ah, there was that teasing streak that Tony had been expecting. Not missing exactly, just expecting.
“Unless more than one assassin wears the title.” she rejoined quietly and Tony shivered. There was something very messed up going on here. He could feel the wrongness of the situation creeping across his skin, and Natasha’s hurt was an incessant buzz in the back of his consciousness despite the stubborn wall she was keeping around herself. He realized why a moment later.
He was screaming his throat raw as blistering cold crept through his veins, freezing everything it touched until blessedly all consciousness was gone.
He knows that she smelled like the forests they’d camped in, warm wood and sweet chamomile laced with the bite of winters cold. He knows her eyes were green and her hair red as a sailor’s sunset; and he knows that she was his last and final warning.
Steve added and a kit with sun-streaked brown hair and indignantly flattened orange ears groaned like he'd just been ordered to his room without dinner until college.
"I hope you don't mind. Mr. Barton has been sharing stories of your exploits. You Avengers seem to live an exciting life." Luke explained and as the tom took another sip from his mug Tony sniffed, recognizing the rich scent of his best Columbian coffee. He turned and gave a grinning Clint the hairy eyeball.
Tony knows it’s a mistake but he loses his temper. He spits out the bar, and as it drops to the floor with a dull thud he sneers, “You can’t wash away the truth! Or don’t you know that either?”
So you’ve trolled the society pages and the magazines for information on Tony and you’ve probably come to the conclusion that he’s from Manhattan, because that’s exactly the illusion he pays his expert public relations team to perpetuate. If you’re particularly savvy (not to mention in need of better hobbies) you may have traced him back to Boston where he went to private school in his formative years, and lingered several years after graduating from MIT in his late teens.
"Come friends, that is the signal for the hunt," Thor gestured for his teammates to follow as he turned toward the mouth of the tent.
He cleared his throat of the curious lump that had gathered there (because he’d never been good with the mushy shit and nobody gave it permission to hang around anyway) and pressed a soft kiss to her cool cheek.
Anyway, once Jena got to the tower and got a chance to see that he was okay things had calmed down. Tony’s offer to pay for the damages at the family home and put the kit and his mother up in a cushy condo at the tower away from her mother had gone a long way towards smoothing things over; and Tony’s legal team had spared a few minutes from the feeding frenzy surrounding Viastone to make elderly Mrs. Keener think twice about doing anything hasty before Tony could talk to Jena about Harley’s future.
He was always tempted to push further with JARVIS (to touch the bright center of the sun and report back to the people watching below what it felt like) but he'd read his Mary Shelly. He could no more bring himself to carelessly create a being with his mind than he could his body, because once life was given he'd always be responsible for it.
There'd never been enough reason to push before, not enough hope of seeing anything good come out of stirring the pot and making his handlers angry with him. But when he was twenty-five Tony had given him a chance, and Bruce had taken it.
“That right there is where you tripped up,” Tony replied, snapping his fingers aggressively. “I’m far from playing Romanov. See, I have a responsibility to you that goes deeper than flesh. I felt that bullet pass right through me when you were shot. Clearly, you don’t understand my job. I
"Hey, I'm just happy when he eats." Rhodey mumbled and Clint rambled something in agreement, but Tony ignored them both.
“Natasha?” he prompted, but her eyes were fixed up on the picture and Tony wondered if she’d even heard him. She was keeping her emotions tightly guarded, but Tony couldn’t muster up anger over it now. They were alike in that way, each preferring to lick their wounds in private, holding together in solitude and hiding their bleeding wounds from the vultures they knew to fear.
“I felt it prudent to seek counsel from Bastet on the chance there was anything else she might be able to tell us.”
But he's two, and weighing heavily on his mind is the realization that all he has seen indicates that his family is incomplete. He understands that people die, but why are there no pictures? Why has he never even heard their names spoken? Everyone has them so where are his?
Maya Hansen was standing near the operating table, a pair of security types on either side of her, clearly there to prevent her interference as Killian leaned over Tony who was conscious now and cursing furiously at Stone, who was standing at the edge of the table closest to his head watching the proceedings with a dark expression.
They (Bruce) clutch a book tightly between their hands. The spine creaks like it’s going to crack. It’s a book on space.
“Are you comfortable? These cots are not known to be the worthiest of beds.” Thor hovered over her a moment until Bruce nudged him out of the way, instructing the pair of SHIELD medics who’d come along with Coulson to get her set up with an IV and barking for JARVIS to turn up the temperature in the jet. She tried to reassure Thor with her eyes, but it was a battle to keep them open.
You did what you had to sometimes, to get the job done. Sometimes you convinced yourself it was for the greater good. But when Tony had told him about the Stones, the bastards who'd strapped a fifteen-year-old to a mounting block and told him to think of what a gift he was giving them – he couldn't blame Tony for not trusting people, and not wanting to bring a kid into a world this cold.
But Bucky was gone, a reality that must be accepted, and even though it had been nearly a year Steve still felt like he'd only just taken a breath since watching him fall. And now that he was surrounded by over a dozen of them, it was hard not to look at the kits and think about the future. Having the life he’d never thought he and Bucky could have… If he and Tony took their relationship further well, Tony would have heats. They could take precautions but there was no fully predicting these kinds of things. And Tony was really good with the kits. Steve could see he’d be a great dad.
. It falls to the Tova to see to Pride rule when the Queen is away or indisposed. Should the Queen die or otherwise become incapable of leading, either without an heir or before that heir is old enough to rule, then the Tova will ascend the throne.” T’Challa explained.
“I’d like that. You sure you don’t need me or anyone else from the team there when you interrogate Parker?”
“What happens if uncle Steve’s not in Washington when Hydra launches Project Oversight?” Kate asked quietly.
Phil had been the one to push for registering Clint in the federal database. Clinton Francis Barton (he'd spent longer than he'd ever admit to anyone going over the registry books that Phil had borrowed for him, trying out a hundred combination of names) officially came into existence on paper July 18th 2001.
“What King Mufasa over here is saying I think,” Clint pondered aloud, jostling the other tom playfully in the ribs. He didn't seem to notice any bad smell. “Is that you gotta be in the moment. You gotta find a way to tell Stark ‘Hey, I’m here and it’s you and me’. You know? Buy a house. Adopt a dog. Something that says you’re looking forward and not back.”
"Being here with you, and on this team, I guess part of me started to really believe that the future I'd imagined was gone might not be, and I got ahead of myself. It's been a long time since I've had anything like real hope in that area.
With his red coat hanging open revealing the white undershirt he wore and the straps of his suspenders, Steve looked far closer to December’s poster boy for a firehouse charity calendar than jolly old St. Nick but Tony was far from complaining. Steve wouldn’t be Steve though if he didn’t balk at the thought of wearing thousands of dollars’ worth of costume.
He's always known there was a before. That’s the one thing they can’t erase. Not completely. Ivan’s devotion to the empire is singular, but the essence of that other man is too strong to completely wipe away. They're too special to destroy so that man has to stay. He lingers in the hallways of the soldier’s mind like a ghostly echo. As chained to the fragments of memory as he is alive in them.
“I don’t need your help. Help them.” Tony gestured to the people filling the grounds, most of them the traumatized residents of the shelter. His heart behind the reactor throbbed like that shrapnel was being pushed into it. “Please.”
Tony shrugged, smiling impishly as he offhandedly replied, “Must have read it online somewhere. Speaking of, how are you handling that crisis on Sokovia, Stern, since General Prokovic was assassinated?”
"Where are they?" He didn't bother mincing words nor did he lower his repulsors, because he had no idea what the hell was going on but he knew better than to blink when this guy was around.
“The stone is a psychic amplifier.” She explained, when she was met only with their silence. “An extremely powerful one that feeds on the strength of the one who wears it and weaves it together with the strength of those who have come before.  T’Challa is not a Queen, so he can’t utilize it the way his mother can, but his mother is a part of the stone, just as the Queens before her. He wears it so that they can walk with him in this hostile land.”
Huh? Did he mean that jackhammer in Tony’s chest? Yeah it was probably bad, but Tony was kind of used to cardiac trauma, so this didn’t even scratch his top ten. But oh hey, look at that. He hadn’t even noticed the glowy lines moving through his veins or how hot it was, until cool ungloved hands were pressed against his skin and something warm and soothing was pushing against his mind.
“Ironman do not engage.” Cap snapped. “Wait for the rest of the team. We don’t know what we’re dealing with.”
“Guys, focus. We don’t need to blow anything up. If earth is the collision point, then all we’ve got to do is move one earth out of the way. Don’t you see? We can save the universe. We just gotta keep the earths from colliding.”
He both loved and hated how amazing it made him feel. Loved the trust and the love he and Tony could share by exchanging something so precious between their hands, and hated how out of control he felt over his own body whenever his chest would swell and his fingers ache like the only thing to do now was grow claws and go slaughter all of Tony’s enemies.
“They were curious. Plus, Patches here reminded me that with the big scary men and having to move they didn’t get their story this year.”
“Tony?” Bruce’s soft voice drew Tony out of his dark contemplation and he realized he was squeezing Tink to his chest rather tightly, but the little girl hadn’t made a sound, grey eyes watching him solemnly as they peeked through her white blond bangs.
Clint was surprised to see that he was a kat though. He could count the kats on the payroll on one hand and he was pretty sure he knew all of them. Taming drugs doing what they did, most kats didn't have the constitution for SHIELD work.
Natasha didn't wait to be asked twice, catching the object effortlessly as she rolled onto her feet and staggered toward Tony with impressive speed when he could tell just by looking that something was terribly wrong with her knee.
The tension had formed a lump in Steve’s throat which he swallowed back as Tony’s eyes sought out his, the soothing brought by the touch of their minds washing through Steve like a slow wave, draining the tension from his body head to toe.
The kit flushes, remembering how his boy had lain beside him on the bed, wiping the sweat from his body with a wash cloth while the kit had whimpered and mewled for a touch they both knew was criminal.
“If you do make it through, you'll suffer the indignity of low wages with few opportunities for advancement while you watch others take credit for your years of work. You will do three times the work of your peers and watch them pass you, year after year. Maybe one of you will have a name tag that says Dr. So-and-So on it one day, but it will not be because the others were less deserving."
Now there was the tiny matter of hacking the information chips within their collars and into the state registry to plant their identities. Little stuff like that.
“Mr. Stark I really must insist you come with us now and be seen to.” The SHIELD medic snapped and Tony bristled because he could hear it in her voice, the unspoken ‘
Now, Tony was used to being corrected when he made self-defacing comments like that. So used to it that they typically rolled right off his skin like water on a ducks back, but he'd never had someone turn and look at him the way Luke was.
"Thank you. And while it occurs to me that kissing you might be sending you mixed signals, I just want to clarify that was a best friend kiss. Is that a thing? Whatever, it's our thing. As long as you think you can handle it?"
Just like the last time Thor had journeyed down here for a word with him he was carrying a tall steaming mug, and just like last time Dummy seemed to take his presence there and the offering as some sort of threat to Tony's safety.
It was thirty minutes past three pm and Tony was forty-five minutes late for his first interview of the afternoon. That normally wouldn't bother him except it was another applicant for the Stark Resilient internship and he really was trying to make the point to the men and women who applied that they were valuable and necessary components of the future.  Nothing said 'you matter’ like keeping a person waiting over an hour. Jesus Christ.
A low growl rumbled in her throat and a few seats down the table Amory turned to her with a frown, shushing her with a silent finger.
Thank you guys so much! You give me life, and I'm really sorry this is so late. I moved this weekend and one thing after another popped up and it just didn't get done. On top of that the holiday is coming and I'm flying to my parent's place for the holidays so this was never gonna get done unless I split up what was originally going to be a thick chapter completing the IM3 arc. Which means another cliffy. I'm so sorry. But I do plan on posting the rest on Sunday on schedule. (*cross your fingers*)
Snickering, Tony slowed down considerably and took his time selecting a shirt. Pepper of course saw right through him and gave him one of her ‘behave or I’m going to drown you in paperwork’ looks.
You could say the whole making Tony his son and heir thing had been Howard’s last big joke on the world.
What mattered was that Steve was theirs... and the loneliness he felt, that cloudy oddly metallic scent (like fresh rain) that tickled at the back of Bruce's nose and fired the impulse in his brain to get closer and give comfort... well probability said that proximity had a 50% chance of providing comfort.
They were connected Steve realized, his own eyes moving back to Tony who was watching the two of them with a fierce sort of pride. Natasha and Bruce were connected with Tony in the middle. That was what Thor had meant, when he’d said the Queen and Consort were at the center of the Pride. He’d meant the literal center.
The history between Stark and Rogers was thick and stickier than mud pie, and there were razor blades baked in just for cheek.
You see what I mean about this guy? How’s a person supposed to run a company, a Pride, and still have time for all the sex they need to have?
Tony was currently sitting in the circle of couches in the center of the room with Natasha curled at his feet, listening to Thor entertaining his small captive audience, including Jane and her assistant Darcy. Helen and Bruce were there as well listening attentively to the highly animated retelling of the Avenger's battle with the Benu bird.
“Whose coming out?” Steve’s heart might have actually skipped a beat at the sound of Tony’s voice so close so suddenly, the man himself following it a second later as he appeared at Steve’s side. His familiar scent filled Steve’s nose and just like that the tension he’d been holding since Tony had gone off to make the rounds began to melt away.
"I wasn't planning on either of us being naked on the first date." Steve replied tersely, fighting back the urge to growl. Had everyone really treated Tony so poorly?
Tony had never expected to become part of a pride, let alone head one, so he's at a complete loss as to what to do when Jarvis lets him know that Clint is on his way, and then Barton is suddenly there in front of Tony asking his permission to get collared.
“Maya is confident it can be stabilized. That's why you're here Tony. Together, I know you can figure it out and we can finally have the future we always wanted. ” She heard Stone plead and her eyes flicked back to Tony momentarily to confirm the tom hadn’t stepped any closer to him. Tony’s grin had widened, showing off the sharp points of his teeth.
“If I can’t...” Tony tapered off, his throat tightening around the words in protest, as if his body were rebelling against voicing the question.
T’Challa didn’t let the awkward tension linger. Having spotted Tony and the Avengers in the lineup T’Challa strode toward them, rudely ignoring the established lineup of important figures, with his terrifying bodyguards trailing behind him.
"How?" Thor asked dubiously. "He knew you were watching him. You can not trust any of the information you gathered."
"I thought it was just the war. All the things we'd seen, that maybe he just couldn't deal. I thought if we could just finish the damn thing and go home, that I'd get us a house somewhere quiet where we could just be happy and leave the war behind us.
Tony watched as JARVIS attempted to restart the device, the screen blinking through the seconds as they waited in anticipation for it to connect to the tracking device he’d slipped it onto Catman’s suit during the fall when the tom was sure to be nice and distracted by keeping them both alive.
Her expression didn't change but he saw the way her eyes widened the tiniest fraction and nobody spoke. Tony wondered for a moment what he'd said to get that sort of reaction before it hit him.
"Their numbers dwindled, their kingdoms scattered Namer called all of the clans together and asked who among them would be brave enough to journey with him into the heart of their enemies nest.
“She’s right Tiberius, and it isn’t his fault.” Killian said and Natasha’s eyes tracked him as he moved around the table. Mentally she tallied the number of security guards she’d counted plus those gathered below who might present a threat. She might be able to disable Killian, Stone, and the two closest guns and still have enough time to free Tony but she didn’t know what condition he was in and doubted even if he was healthy enough to walk that they’d be able to make it out of the building unscathed with the number of guns she’d counted.
"Was that necessary you she demon?" Tony grumbled, holding his ear tenderly as he sank back into his seat.
"Yes! You know what, screw Dyson construction. If he's expecting me to come begging on hands and knees and pay for the pleasure he can kiss my ass. I'll even present for him." Tony snapped in response. Though the technician with the SI identification badge that Tony couldn’t bother to read looked up to stare at him with alarm as he passed, Pepper didn't react to his flare of temper or the crude picture he painted. She was far too used to it by now.  Her tone was insufferably patient as she reminded him that Dyson was one of their oldest contracts and there was nobody better equipped to take on the size of their project.
Tony leached warmth into her body and her distant eyes slowly turned to meet his with recognition as their bodies began to sync, her breathing slowly evening.
Sarah had volunteered to watch Bucky and his sister Laura after school, and that had been the start of a long-standing tradition of coming home at night to find another place set at the table only for Ma to announce they would have a guest for however long it suited her.
“What’s the downside?” Tony asked warily, heart sinking because the pictures Darren was showing him were perfect. Lush and green, low slopes, sandy beaches, crystal blue waters.
Seagulls shrieked and the wind tossed Tony's hair, bringing with it the taste of sea against his lips and the trickling scent of something soft and sweet and so precious it sat like a weight in Tony's heart.
“Yours, when you threw up all over that rug Pepper loved in the Malibu house weeping into your champagne glass about how much you couldn’t live without him if Charlie took that job in Manchester.” Tony chuckled.
"And to seek a favor, I imagine." The woman purred dangerously, and Tony stepped forward. The guardsman hissed threateningly at him and he rolled his eyes, raising his hands in a gesture of surrender.
“His daughter,” Tony confirmed. “And it doesn’t look like she was leaving that store under her own steam.”
Tony knocked on the proverbial door between their minds, careful to keep a distance because the rules of the metaphysical plane could get hairy at times. Now was really not the time to slip and lose focus.
T’Challa seemed to get it now, because his eyes had softened with a mix of familiar anger and sadness.
“Thor! You’re just in time.” The woman exclaimed as she threw herself into the blond’s arms in a single leap, achieving an impressive amount of air.
The guy's tail, having a mind of it's own like most, was trying to curl tightly around Tony's legs like an extra arm, the metal barbs catching on the thin material of his under suit.
"Obviously we've done everything we can to be as sure as we can that the compound is compatible. The numbers look good but, like she said. There's always a margin for error." Tony shrugged somewhat helplessly, leaning back against the counter to survey his teammates. "Honestly guys this is kind of it. There's no scenario where I walk away from this without putting it all on the table. There's a timer on how long I can self-sustain Extremis and we've literally exhausted all other options previously known to man.
So the good thing about kinda sorta seeing another person, was how in those early stages it was all "gee Tony, let me get that door for you" and "hey Tony I'm getting up. Are you hungry?" And "Golly Tony, your ears look so soft. Can I rub them?"
Harley was scheduled to take the federal assessment exam in early January and he was particularly nervous about the English portion that was well known for throwing complicated grammar rules and arbitrary words at young kats that even graduate students would struggle with, in order to leach points away from their overall score.
She tells him the story when he’s two and if she’s shocked that he remembers the sparkly barrette she had in her hair, she doesn’t say so. But then by then it’s already very clear that Tony is different.
Back in the twenties, the government became obsessed with the idea of creating (or recreating as it were) the perfect warriors, and it was the legends of the Alurio (or cat-people if you don’t hold as many PHDs as he does) that sparked that particular line of thinking.
But Tony just sort of… let it go. He didn’t remark on it at all, as if he hadn’t built an entire trademark on being just Tony and nothing else. Clint’s brow furrowed in contemplation as the two traded messages back and forth, seeming to forget they were on Clint’s wall on a completely public domain until:
But even as he thought it, the light show going on in their heads chased the thought away. It wasn't something Tony had words for, though he'd try his best later to describe it to Bruce. All those neurons and pathways in the brain, all those billions of cells carrying information across millions of bridges.
Tony's nose twitched, the small space between them filling with the scent of worried over protective tom. It wasn't as strong as Steve's but then again Steve's pheromones thanks to the serum were rather on the 'I say everything at a shout' side.
“Aren’t you guys forgetting something?” There was a pause, while presumably Harley thought about it.  Parker got there first.
Not wishing to test it, the kit quickly moves to point toward the magazine rack where the latest issue of one of his favorite publications sits on display.
It was one of Tony's new models, and it was amusing in its own ways to watch his eyes flicking over the sleek body of the aircraft, like a fretful parent before sending a child off on their first day of school. But she arched a challenging brow at him anyway, hoping to deter him from suggesting she take one of the older air crafts. She loved to fly, though she rarely indulged in it purely for pleasure's sake, and she did threaten her best friends life for a chance to fly the thing. It would be a shame to waste a perfectly good threat.
Despite how taught with tension his body was he hadn’t so much as moved an inch, and Tony knew he wouldn’t take until invited to.
“Yeah” she answered, her voice sounding strangled and she laughed. Squeezing both their hands once more. Her eyes sought Jaime’s and found him where he was holding a very pale looking Anya. “I think we are.”
"I wanted to thank you for coming to my defense earlier. I'm sorry if it put you at odds with the captain. And, well, I only wish I was truly the man you think I am."
"Oh I want you, I need you oh Baby I do, but a guy needs a breather every now and again. Even I can't get fucked all the time."
“Wow, that’s overstating things a bit don’t you think?” Tony shot back, insulted by the very idea that he’d been so outclassed by his opponent that he’d needed rescuing from a literal child.
"The trail is cold on the terrorists. The parts salvaged from the trucks traced back to a company in Tennessee that sells to just about everybody. Nothing to narrow down the list." She finally answered and Steve listened intently, rising to his feet.
She made the mistake of grabbing one of the orderlies, just a terrified guy whose only there because Tony had handpicked his staff because he’s someone that Tony had felt genuinely cared and wanted to do good for the kats who stayed there.
Sam laughed again and gave Rhodes a mock salute. “You’re relieved Colonel. Thank you for your assistance today. You’ve served your country with distinction.”
Without warning, low urgent whispers of warning entered Tony's mind and he knew somehow that the strangely familiar voice belonged to the tom standing beside him in the cat costume (wicked wingpak addition).
“We are changing things.” Amory piped up from down the table, eyes still glued to his screen. “Our presence alone creates a ripple in the continuity. The future we lived in still exists in some dimension, but just by being here we’ve already created an alternate future.”
“Thor and I are at the exits. They can’t walk through walls.” Natasha growled. Tony wasn’t so sure of that. These guys didn’t just have his technology. They had things he’d only yet contemplated in his dreams. Things that were barely scraps in his notes, and a few ideas that hadn’t even made it outside his brain yet as they were still catalogued as near impossible without the right resources. It was like somewhere in the world he had a smarter, flashier, and vibranium rich twin.
“Trust is essential to a bond Tony. You have so few you can rely on, and so few places to feel safe and I lied my way into your sanctum and into your affection. My reasons for doing so matter little where your heart is concerned but I hope that in explaining my motives, it will help you toward finding your way to trusting me again.”
“Sorry. It’s crowded up here these days,” Tony apologized, tapping the side of his skull. It was touch and go with people how they felt about Gata bonds once they saw them in action.  The general rule seemed to be a certain kind of disquiet at knowing that Tony was holding silent conversations with his teammates. Tony knew for a fact it bothered the hell out of Fury. Nobody liked to think the inmates were plotting.
If that utterly disastrous mission that had ended with Clint concussed and Steve shot was anything to go by, Fury would say that whatever he’d done to the winter soldier, the winter soldier had earned and then some. But it was of course far more complicated than Fury or anyone else in national security was going to allow.
That was news to Tony but hardly a surprise. Still, there was all sorts of bite in his voice as he laughed and muttered, "Of course he did."
Rhodes displayed the patience of a saint, though he had to close his eyes and speak very carefully to do it.
Clint ran, using all of his speed and reflexes to scramble over long tables and stay ahead of the guy barreling through tables and chairs behind him, eyes scanning for a bit of cover.
The longer he stared at her the more sure Tony became that the Kǫtrdýr had to be the inspiration behind Catman’s costume, but it only opened up further mysteries. Like how the tom even knew they existed.
He has an eidetic memory. That means that his mind captures data, the inputs of sights, sound, touch, and emotional resonance and stores it better than a moving picture.
As if he were the god of their imagination. All seeing and knowing and existing only with their progress in mind.
Bruce did know, and he was fairly good at reading between the lines. Bucky was gone and Tony went out of his way to prove he neither wanted nor needed Steve.
Or rather, he blinks and he’s back in the surveillance van with Wanda and Pietro. Pietro is in the back, fishing through his bag where he has stashed provisions for their long stake out, muttering something about how boring SHIELD agents are, presumably unconcerned with the soldier’s lack of response.
She stared at it for a long assessing moment, as if she were contemplating the benefits of skewering Steve with her claws there and then, but eventually curiosity won out and she released his neck to take it from him. She stared at the drawing for a long painfully silent period of time. It was the one Steve had drawn at Christmas, of a kit playing in the low branches of the Christmas tree.
“Later,” Tony answered with a sigh, turning on the faucet with a thought (it was easier now to access the technology around him without pain) ducking back inside to wash up. “Got a meeting at one, and Harley’s coming this afternoon. If you wouldn’t mind taking over the lesson for the day while I talk to mom.”
Ivan’s programing dictated that now he escorts the twins back to command, where they would at best be terminated outright and at worst sent back to castle black for reevaluation. Those where his directives. Feelings didn’t matter when it came to Ivan’s programing. The twins knew that. But Ivan’s feelings had disrupted his programing in the past. They’d gambled their lives on the strength of those feelings.
I hope you enjoyed this and thank all of those who have taken the time to share their thoughts with me. It has been so encouraging. All my love. -T
“But she’s definitely had better days.” Tony interjected. “And on that note, do you know what keeps going through my head? Why don’t I have blankets yet? Where is my sandwich? I thought I gave a detailed list and yet…”
“Only that I am sure of one thing.” The tom’s eyes were warm and steady as he held Tony’s hand cupped between his and slowly raised it to his lips in a whisper of a kiss. Not like a lover, but rather strangely like some knight of old, swearing fealty to his liege. “I cannot speak for your Captain. But to stand at your side would be the greatest honor of my life and it is worth a great deal more than I am free to give you. I am hopeful that will change very soon, but I will not insult you by asking you to wait. I hope only that we can be friends again. Your friendship is a dear enough gift for anyone.”
Steve didn’t like bullies or to bully others, and he didn’t believe in fighting just for the sake of fighting, but he kind of agreed with Thor whose face split into a beaming grin as he exclaimed, “It is sure to be a most excellent sparing match!”
The mission was a simple one. Text book. Or at least it would have been, if Ivan hadn’t started it off his game. His head is still cracked, but so long as their handlers stayed in the dark about that he didn’t see it as much of a problem. He was getting stronger, finding it easier to keep Stark from rooting around in his thoughts at will. He couldn’t push the man out completely. Somehow some way, Stark had created a bridge between them and Ivan got the notion that if he wanted the man gone completely he’d have to burn it down – and he didn’t think that was going to be a bloodless process for either one of them.
Bruce had a point Tony thought, swallowing thickly as he observed the silently playing videos from new perspective. Without the clinical lenses, it was suddenly easier to appreciate how young they were, how they threw themselves into their mission with fervor and how they worked together with familiarity and the kind of ease that only came with intimacy.
"Of course. My heart goes out to the poor creatures sold to the heat houses and the fighting rings, but setting you kits up for failure won't help anybody, and frankly I think it's down right negligent of Miss. Potts to have allowed it."
"You thought I was the catch?" The realization dawned on Steve slowly. Sam hadn’t doubted that Steve could go for someone like Tony because of the different way they approached things. Sam thought SHIELD had forced them together because they wanted somebody to control the Pride. Control Tony.
Tony thinks that's the last he'll see of the boy but he wonders about him for days after that, fearful that his big mouth really had gotten his rescuer in trouble – imagining him rotting in a prison somewhere for some petty crime he didn't commit, because he wouldn't. He's not that sort of person. Tony can tell. He's the sort of person who steps in front of a thief because it's the right thing, even if it brings him trouble.
“Last year it was Brad Pitt,” Fluffy said with a dreamy sigh, her fluffy brown tail swishing. She gave Tony a judgmental look as she muttered, “and he did voices!”
Undomesticated 'feral' gata have been illegal in the United States since 1812. Unless of course you're a circus attraction like Barton. "Come see the wildkat, the last of its kind" makes for a gret headliner but there's got to be a show, right?
“All you had to do was ask. I wouldn’t have teased you” he entreated softly and Nyota’s gaze flew back to him with an accusing glare, and his mouth curled upward in a smirk.
"I am unable to reestablish connection, there is something blocking me." JARVIAS sounded a bit peeved about that and Tony almost smiled. He was sure that JARVIS like him, was used to being the biggest fish in the pond. Running up against systems beyond their scope was definitely out of their ordinary.
“I do not think this is wise my friend,” Thor ventured to say, tone suggesting that he was sure Tony just hadn’t thought it through  and a nudge in the right direction would have him going ‘whoops’.
Princess stood up straighter, sharp teeth flashing in a grin as she flicked her tail behind her, swatting at the imagined annoyance.
“It was efficient.” Tony thought that was all that she’d say on the matter, but then he moved her eyes from Steve back to him and there was a bite of censure to her tone as she finished, “But then you took your eyes off him. Don’t do that again.”
"I don't. You want to get yourself killed, fine. One less pain in my ass. But you can't do it on my watch. I'm not answering for why your stupid ass fell off a building."
And it was an organism. There was no earthly equivalent for it but the metallic like material that formed the Benu's scales and likely its entire skeleton was in actuality a highly adaptable (not to mention complex) living organism.
"Wait so we're good enough to spawn but not good enough to talk to, is that it?" Clint scoffed loudly in the woman's direction, only Tigger (Tony was calling him that from now on) really didn't like that because his gold eyes bugged out and a hair raising snarl ripped through the air.
He knows his grandfather used to own the yard before his father did. Uncle Isiah and Nonno still work there. He wonders if they are some of the ones causing trouble. He doesn't doubt that uncle Isiah would and Obi is right. Mama would never let Hughard fire him.
“Look, Jena…” Tony began with a small sigh, letting out his pent-up frustrations to try and start again. It was important to him, he realized, to make sure that Harley wasn’t left behind. Especially if Tony wasn’t there to see it all come to life. “Harley’s ready to take his exam and he’s going to blow these guys away. I guarantee it. You have a great kid, with a real brain on him, and New York has some of the best schools in the country and when he’s ready for college I can get him into a good program, the right program, with teachers who aren’t going to harass or side-line him because he’s not like the other kids. I’m offering him a chance here, a chance to be more than he thinks he can be right now. More than anyone has ever told him he could be.”
"Who taught you how to be a good host?" Clint grumbled, rubbing at Tony's wriggling feet. The spice in the air thickened with Tony's contented purr. "Bruce is with me on this. It's two against one."
It reminded him of his childhood in a small way. Which normally Tony wouldn’t call a good thing, except the walks Jarvis used to take him on were some of the sweeter parts of the bittersweet. He does like it. He likes it enough that even though some jerk with a camera recognized them in their (rather ridiculous really) attempts to blend in with the crowds and snapped a picture of Steve plucking his sunglasses off of his face to steal a kiss off his laughing mouth and obviously sold it to the newspapers, Tony can’t regret anything. Not even his poor costume choice. Because it turns out that Steve was right and nobody but Tony Stark and someone trying to hide their face wears expensive aviators in wintertime. Who knew.
“Some massaman curry, larb, and the braised soft crab. Double our usual tip if they can get it here in twenty minutes.”
Tony had kindly explained to Secretary Walsh from the Defense Department that the contract drawn up for the Pride initiative included an independence clause that stipulated that upon successful completion of a Pride bond, the Gata so bonded received conditional independence (provided they maintained a SHIELD designated Handler and continued to fulfil a public service).
Posting early again due to it being another busy Sunday. Moving is the WORST. Don't do it. ;) I hope you enjoy.
“Nyota’s not crazy! Dad said there was a way they could be stopped! We just have to find it.” Her ten-year-old brother insisted with an intimidating glare. Unfortunately, it was ruined by the fact that he had strawberry preserves smeared over his top lip. T’Cael had never been able to eat without completely massacring his food.
She'd been sick for a couple of years now, but Sarah Rogers had never been the type of woman to let anything slow her down. She still kept up with her work as a nurse at the Youth Home in Pembrook and never missed a Sunday at church. When she’d gone into remission it had almost seemed expected – like of course, she was going to get better – and Steve had almost let himself breathe again and think about things getting back to normal.
They sped through the city traffic like mad things and in the back of Tony's mind he said an apology to Pepper, who was sure to be miffed when the traffic cams crashed the party; but for the moment he couldn't care less. He let himself enjoy the speed, the feel of Steve's body shifting beneath his and the rumble of his chest as the blond laughed at Tony's loud whoops.
He’d been grateful not to be dead, but he never made any mistake that to SHIELD he was just a tool. A good operative. Useful. He had new masters but the golden rule still applied. Never outlive your use.
Tony frowned. What were these guys doing? Robbing a Macey’s for some quick cash, okay, but a bookstore? It didn’t make sense.  None of it did.
The strange man who had appeared in the room only moments ago is gone. There’s no body. No splattered brains on the wall. The soldier is still sitting in his chair, rifle in his lap untouched. He hadn’t stood up and shot the intruder.
attention for Tony’s sole benefit. Because Tony is someone he cares about and Steve is a muscly patriotic themed mother hen.
She just hoped for the kits sake that being rewritten didn’t hurt. Maybe it really was like Back To The Future. Maybe they’d all just start to fade gently away.
There was dried blood on her hands he realized with alarm, but his eyes roved her whole body and didn’t see any evidence of injury that could produce that amount of blood. It was only when he glanced wildly around that he noticed the familiar object on the floor. It was his arc-reactor, along with its casing and wires.
The Queen gave her blessing and a short speech about the honor this would bring both their houses and the years of peace and prosperity that were sure to follow in the wake of their union and then she bid them join hands with her.
A government court hearing was nothing compared to six weeks hiking through a Siberian winter, but there was no exhaustion like the exhaustion brought on by being forced to listen to hours of stupid people beating at the same point in hope of different results.
Steve just stares at him, lowered eyelashes spiked with moisture making the hunger in them look sleepy, and Tony’s gut clenches with a stab of want. He takes a step forward and in the space of a single breath it seems, Steve’s hands are on him and he’s being pulled into that spray and then his back slaps against cool tile and Steve’s mouth is on his.
Belles wasn't the most glamourous club Tony had ever been to in his life, but he liked it better for it's  old brick, cheap Parisian décor and dedication to nostalgia. In his youth he'd been to some kennel joints dripping in diamonds, not a dark corner in sight, but just thinking about them even now left a bad taste in his mouth.
“I’m gonna be an Avenger someday.” He blurted, cheeks pinkening with embarrassment but he held Tony’s gaze to show him he meant it. It was what he wanted. He’d known he’d wanted to fight by Tony’s side ever since he’d seen that first battle on the television when he’d killed Master Stane in front of the entire world and admitted it later with three life changing words. I am Ironman.
She’d never wanted to be Queen so early. Never like this. But lucky for them she’d learned from the best.
Tony almost floated into his room that night. Dropped off at the elevator doors to the penthouse like a teenager on prom night because Steve Rogers was a perfect idiot and ignored all of Tony's blatant invitations to come upstairs and skip the coffee.
“The kits have grown into a fine pair of trouble makers but Mother dares not punish them too harshly lest word get back to their Queen. She makes them pull the chariot when they have misbehaved but strong as they are it’s hardly a punishment worth mentioning.” Perhaps in an attempt at levity he sounded abundantly surly about that in a way that spoke of jealousy and Natasha’s eyes met Tony’s from across the table in bemusement.
“Now we lay low.” Once decided his mind turned to figuring out the best areas to hide from their handlers and the quickest way to procure supplies. Everything they have belongs to the New Order – to Hydra. They could start with stripping the van, taking anything that didn’t have a tracker in it.
They were a warrior culture not unlike his own people and put a great deal of importance on the hunt.
She knew that. He reminded himself. Natasha knew and that meant she'd do whatever it took to get them functioning like a real pride, even if it went against all of her training (even if she was scared) because that was what he'd asked her to do.
"Which movie would you prefer, Sir?" Jarvis questioned as the humungous flat screen mounted to the wall in front of them turned on. Steve nearly jumped, not expecting the bright light in the otherwise dim room any more than he was expecting the booming voice. This reaction got another giggle out of Tony, but he didn't comment on it otherwise.
“Uh…nothing?” Tony tried, with a pitiful shrug. He visibly winced at how horribly this was already going in his favor. Sometimes, he was a quick thinker and a smooth talker and he knew how to work his way out of things. Today, though, he just didn't have it in him. He was still reeling from the previous night, and if this conversation ended the way Tony had a bad feeling it would, he would likely be going right back down. He was too mentally drained to give too much of a defense.
"Headed home, I believe," she informed him before casually kissing his forehead and releasing his face, "
"More or less," Steve shrugged, relaxing back into the couch. This was going much better than he anticipated, "If you give me four or five hours, I can figure just about anything out. Well, so far, at least."
“Have one of what, sweetheart?” Steve asked softly, eyebrows furrowing. The blue light from the TV was the only lighting in the room, and the way it hit Tony’s face made him look as beautiful as ever. His eyes sparkled in the low light as he looked up at him.
The pair sat in comfortable silence for nearly an hour, only moving when Tony squirmed into a more comfortable position and Steve accommodated. Steve had been secretly praying he'd doze off on his own but unfortunately, he was too stubborn to give in like that. Pepper obviously wasn't exaggerating when she said he came with long nights. Despite the fact that he was visibly exhausted, he seemed to have no plans of actually going to sleep. He was just as interested in the film as he was when it started and Steve was feeling thankful that he himself didn't require much sleep.
Tony was too wrapped up in the comfort and his headspace to realize what Pepper was witnessing completely contradicted everything he'd told her about his feelings towards Steve. Hell, it completely contradicted everything he'd told
It had been a few minutes of just the touching and Tony’s even breathing when he found himself unwillingly falling into subspace. He didn’t care who seen, he didn’t care about feeling weak. He couldn’t even be embarrassed, he just felt so relaxed and
“Do you need to use the restroom?” Pepper was asking him before he could argue. She started tidying up the couch area as she spoke, fixing whatever he and Steve had messed up, “Go ahead and do that.”
"How are you feeling?" Pepper checked on him after a few moments of silence, squeezing him tightly before pushing him back enough to face her, "You back with me?"

"Mhm," he hummed, letting his eyes close for a moment as he soaked up the affection, previous turmoil apparently long forgotten. Steve was almost embarrassed for thinking that he'd
“That’s good to know, my sweet boy,” she comforted, patting the small of his back a few times, before wrapping her free arm around his waist and anchoring him to her, “For now, we’re going to deal with this time, though. We’re going to get it dealt with now so we don’t have to worry about it again, okay?”
These words were accompanied by a knowing look and a wink, and Steve feared he felt a blush creep upon his skin. Nevertheless, she was right, so he opted to play it cool and change the subject, “I’m sure he will. How long are you gonna be staying?”
"Then you have nothing to apologize for, Steve," she assured him quickly, "He is a big boy, after all. If he didn't want you touching him, trust me, he would
"I understand why you wouldn't want me to stay here with him," he admitted to her in a rush. If he was in her position, he wouldn't want someone he'd never even met staying with his sub either, "You have no reason to trust me, but as I've already made clear, I have no intention of hurting Anthony. But he's also told me about how he doesn't like it when Rhodes has to take care of him, and I don't want to make him any more miserable than he already is."
That was all the encouragement Tony needed before he was turning in her arms. He winced when his ass hit the bed, but she had him tucked away against her chest before he could complain. His ass still hurt something fierce, but it wasn't his first concern anymore. For the time being, he hugged her tightly and entangled his legs between hers as well as he could. It was a familiar position - he was usually too large for her lap - so cuddling with her on the bed was his favorite way to cry out his sorrow into her chest.
“Six glorious days,” she chuckled as she dropped their mugs off into the sink, “And then back to LA to my girl. I’m sure you won’t stay away for an entire six days, though – I’ll be seeing you around, too.”
, that deep, rough voice that managed to be gentle and calm all at the same time. Even when he was upset, he was calm and collected. It was part of what Tony liked so much about him.
“I’m not leaving, sweetheart,” he assured him, figuring he'd start there, “I was just gonna step out of the bathroom so you could have some privacy. I'd be right there in your room. That's as far as I'm going from you tonight, buddy. I promise.”
“Alright,” Steve started gruffly, swinging down to grab the pair of worn slacks from the ground before turning to face the other way, “Go ahead. I’m not looking.”
Tony's brain was clearly deciding to trust this large, ancient, behemoth of a man and he was in no position to fight it. There was still a little fear creeping around in the back of his mind that reminded him that Steve could easily just hang up the phone and have his way with him, but he forced it down. Steve wouldn't. He just...wouldn't.
By then, it was clear that Tony was struggling to articulate what he was feeling in an appropriate manner. Honestly, he was so frustrated that Steve was surprised that he hadn't burst into a tantrum already. It was all getting to be too much for him, bless his heart, but Steve was happy that Tony was still trying so hard to behave, even though it was hard. There'd be tons of praise to offer as soon as he got the stubborn sub to finally go to bed.
"No!" he answered again, but this time it was loud and panic-ridden. He jerked his hands from Steve's grip, using them to clutch his t-shirt to his body as he frantically shook his head, "No! I...I'm fine. I mean...it's comfortable. I don't need to change."
thing to do? No, not so much, but this was all still very new and his soft spot for the submissive was still a little
“Hey,” he called softly, bouncing his leg a little to get the slowly drifting sub’s attention, “Why don’t we get you more comfortable before you get to bed, buddy?”
"No? What exactly should I be worried about then?" The Dom asked, curiously amused by the fact that Tony's warning label was only getting longer.
And he didn't, either. He knew that this encounter was going to push him five steps back with Tony because the sub would need to reestablish his boundaries, which had been kind of been crossed without his full consent. It was for his own good, but it didn't matter. In a way, Tony had lost his sense of control and he was going to need to regain it. For now, though, he was floating and adorable and dependent, and Steve was going to eat that up for every possible second. He could deal with the
Pepper must have known she wasn’t getting a response because she didn’t wait for one, instead calling out to Jarvis, “Jarvis, can you make sure no one will be bothering us for a while?”
The warm-up portion of his spanking was over a little too quickly for Tony's liking and he was regretting whining about it as much as he did. He always seemed to forget that what came next hurt worse. How he managed to forget, he wasn't sure. Pepper's go-to implement for as long as he could remember had been her hairbrush, but the sting of those first few swats,
to sleep. Half of the time, the only thing waiting on him was nightmares, anyway. He was never in a rush to face one of those.
The helplessness that came with this is what he hated the most. As long as he’d been alive, he never managed to get over that. Even though he trusted Pepper with his life and then some, handing over complete control and submitting to something so painful was still
hurts his feelings, Steve. Put him back in your lap, make sure he knows you aren't mad and let me tell him good night. He’ll be over it until the next time he feels wronged. Trust me, he's a bit of a roller coaster sometimes, but once you get him figured out you'll do just fine.”
. His bed seemed to have swallowed him whole and he felt fuzzy in the best kind of ways. He enjoyed this, and very thoroughly, for about sixty seconds. Then, he remembered.
"Not tired," Tony distractedly protested, still watching Steve's movements and actually flinching a little (or a lot) at the solid 'thud' sound his shoe made when it hit the carpet. Tony blushed profusely, embarrassed by how worked up he was, but Steve's signature amused chuckle never came. Instead, he just gave a comforting squeeze to his ankle before gently dropping his left foot and reaching for his right.
Tony sniffled. He didn’t plan to sass anymore, but he knew he earned the warning from his previous behavior, “I used your code for Jarvis to disable the babysitting thing.”
"Love you, too, mama," he quickly assured her, smiling as well, "Please fly safe, okay? You promised to be here in the morning, so you have to."
be eating breakfast the following morning. He didn't put up too much of a fight, just mentioning that he won't be hungry (because he's
Steve looked around in confusion before he remembered Jarvis, the talking robot who was apparently everywhere in the tower. He didn’t know if he would ever get used to that, “Uh...yeah?”
“Are you sure about that, Tony?” Pepper pressed, eyebrows furrowing as she stared intently at Tony. His heart dropped at the look because,
Despite his inner turmoil, he’d been there before and he knew what he was going to have to do. So, reluctantly, he drug his feet towards her without waiting on an order. There was no reason to delay the obvious, after all.
She let her tension out in a sigh at his nearly whispered apology before slowly shaking her head, “I’m not upset with you, honey. You're allowed to express how you feel. You don’t have to apologize for that, okay? I shouldn't have snapped at you for telling Steve how you were feeling, but you know how I feel about those feelings. It’s not your fault. I know you can’t help it; I just hate that you have to feel them."
Tony felt tears sting at the back of his eyes as his eyes, a wave of pure misery washing over him as he accepted his fate. There was an easy way and a hard way; a lot of the time, Anthony took the hard way. This time around, though, he’d just gotten his Domme back and was already coming down off of an eventful night. He didn’t think he had the energy to argue or kick up too much of a fuss, but he still wasn’t happy about it.
When his door, that was pulled up almost completely began to push open, he sat up in preparation for Steve to make his reappearance. He
It felt right, and Steve felt privileged. Because why did this beautiful and sweet and broken boy's heart decide
. Arguing wasn’t good and running definitely wasn’t, and no matter how hard he racked his brain he couldn’t find any other ways out. He just had to
He did try to undress. He even made it out of his blazer and took his belt off before he flopped back down on the couch, exhausted and crying and just wanting to be cuddled again. He was too far down and tired to properly take care of himself, whether he liked it or not, and his inability to do as he was told was frustrating.
Her look darkened, arms now crossing over his chest as she continued to glare at her submissive, “Anthony Stark, are we really going to add lying to the list? Have you forgotten what soap tastes like while I’ve been gone?”
wanted, but he didn't find anything. Mostly, the man still looked fairly neutral, but he sent him a warm smile and squeezed his ankle again when their eyes met. The comforting gestures calmed some of Tony's anxiety and he sent him a bashful smile of his own before turning his attention back to the phone in his hand.
It was just a statement of fact, a confirmation to Tony's self that Pepper had done exactly what she said she would - just like always. She was good for that; both keeping her word and consistency, along with hoards of other things. And from the comfort of her arms, he'd say she definitely gave a damn good hug.
Fear and disorientation was consuming Tony - he was out of it. He'd never just lost all control before, not like this and definitely not so fast. He didn’t know how the hell Steve managed to make him feel like this just by a couple of minutes of touching, but he hated it. Steve could do anything with him if he wanted, and Tony would just have to take it.
"You're exhausted. You have to get some sleep, Anthony, or you're not going to feel any better," she reasoned when Tony didn't offer anything else, "Do you want Steve to stay with you or do you want me to call Rhodes?"
Tony's giggle became a full-blown laugh in response, hiccupping a few times as an aftereffect of all of the crying he'd been doing. It was absolutely adorable and Steve was sure he was in love. Before he could accidentally voice that, the submissive was calling out to his robot butler. "Jarvis, could you turn something on, please?"
“‘m okay,” Tony finally offered once a moment of silence had passed and he realized he still hadn’t given her an answer, staring at the screen with a goofy grin. Steve had found a spot behind Tony's ear that he specifically liked and was now repeatedly running his fingers over said spot, so Tony was having a hard time focusing past that. Between Steve's magical fingers and the comfort that Pepper's voice brought to him, he was feeling very content and it was only forcing him down even further.
"Yes, Mr. Stark," Jarvis answered easily, the A.I's voice soothing and low as if he knew Tony was distressed. He was glad he made such an intuitive robot, "Just a moment.”
His tone became much more sullen as he addressed her inevitable departure, squirming a little against Steve's thighs. He'd been dealing pretty well, but the reality was likely setting in and he obviously still wasn't too comfortable with it. Steve didn't expect him to be, and since he knew the inevitable was approaching, he began to prepare himself for whatever the fall back would be. Hopefully, not too catastrophic. He was coping well so far, so Steve hoped that would continue until he got him to sleep.
“I’ll be there in the morning, baby boy,” she promised again, using another familiar nickname that made Tony blush. Before she could continue, someone outside of the screen caught her attention. He couldn't make out most of the conversation, but he could tell they were talking about her plane.
Steve's glanced down, heart bursting at the sight of Tony's fists balled up in his shirt. He was clingy and shameless about it, and Steve couldn't help but smile. The poor thing just wanted to be close, and once he got him settled, Steve would be thrilled to oblige.
Steve had gotten too comfortable in the idea that Tony was okay with this, so this reaction caught him off balance. Losing his pants didn't bother him one bit, but he was now in tears over the idea of taking off his shirt. Steve knew that couldn't have stemmed from anything pleasant, but he pushed the thought to the back of his mind. He didn't want to think about the poor thing's past. Not until it was time to, at least.
with him. It was so easy to be a dick towards everybody else because almost everybody else was always a dick to him. Steve, on the other hand, was different. That's why he tried his best to avoid him, so he didn't fall into a situation like the one he was currently in.
"Of course he was," Pepper teasingly agreed, shaking her head in amusement, "Now, I need you to be serious for a minute, Tony. Everything
Thankfully, his body never confused punishment with pleasure, although some submissives did have that issue. For a lot of them into heavier play, it wasn’t even confusion, the hairbrush
Sure enough, when he opened it was full of fancy water bottles and plenty of healthy-looking snacks. Steve’s guess was that Pepper probably kept it stocked for aftercare; he doubted Anthony cared enough to do so. Either way, he was happy because the accommodation meant he didn’t have to leave Anthony unattended. Steve doubted that he would have let him, anyway.
knew. Even when Tony was having one of his bad days and insisting that he didn't need her to stick around if she didn't want to - that he wasn't a charity case - she knew. Even though he knew better, he still couldn't help but wonder if she was only there for him because she knew nobody else would be. That irrational thought made him cry harder.
“I’m still getting used to Jarvis,” Steve admitted after a moment, chuckling despite himself, “He’s…interesting.”
Still silent, Tony squirmed around in Steve’s arms until he was comfortable. Once he’d done that and rested his head over the Dom’s heart, he let out a content sigh. Smitten, Steve kissed his hairline before silently reminding him, “It’s time to go to sleep, now, buddy. Pepper will be here soon.”
Steve was expecting a breakdown as soon as Pepper hung up the phone. He was expecting a full-blown, impressively major tantrum, actually. That's what he'd been preparing himself for since she picked up the phone. It was an unsettlingly pleasant surprise when nothing of the sort came.
a specific action that could sway her, Tony had yet to figure out what it was. His guess was that there
"It's alright," his deep voice comforted, his chest rumbling under Tony. Looking in his eyes and hearing him speak like that again made Tony want to melt. He didn't know what it was, but Steve made him feel safe. He made him feel like it was, indeed, alright, "Go on and get ready for bed. When you've done that, I promise you will get the phone back, okay?"
times when his Domme caved, let him off easy, but he had yet to figure out the pattern to those instances. If there
Steve could literally see Tony hold himself back as he nodded vigorously, obviously more than pleased with the idea. He wasn't surprised; he could tell Tony wanted back in his lap since the moment they made him get out of it. The attention and touch meant everything to him and it was obvious, he was just too stubborn and proud to actually ask.
Tony didn’t seem to like the easy way, nor did he seem to like the vague scolding he received. He whined louder, squirming in his hold and pushing at the Dom’s chest, “
Tony didn’t make any eye contact while Steve spoke to him, choosing to squirm against his knees and cry instead. Once he was finished, though, the sub looked up to glare. There was a fire in his eyes that Steve hadn’t seen since he dropped and he realized there was no going back at that point, “Which one, Anthony?”
. He didn’t care about stupid fucking Steve. He was still just kind of emotional, was all. It would pass with time.
Tony, who was still very much curled up in Steve's lap, visibly deflated after the phone call ended. He continued to stare at the screen of Steve's phone for several quiet moments, looking utterly forlorn, but he didn't make a move to throw a tantrum. There was yet another beat of silence before he let out a shaky sigh and finally handed Steve back his phone. His eyes were wet with fresh tears when he looked up at him and politely asked, "Can I watch TV, please?"
Steve definitely wasn’t expecting Tony to lay on him, but he refrained from commenting on it. He was still confused as to how the first conversation he’d managed to have with Tony that wasn’t either entirely about work or entirely full of the submissive running his smart mouth managed to land them in this.
Tony must have mistaken Steve's momentary silence for displeasure because he quietly whimpered, squirming in his spot, "I'm sorry..."
While he was in the bathroom, Pepper had made his bed back up and was sitting on the edge. Tony knew the position all too well – legs crossed, stern face, perfect posture, and an antique wooden hairbrush that left his behind feeling like a wildfire in hand. Anthony knew the burn all too well. He’d had plenty of teachers, but that hairbrush? It was his greatest one.
He wasn’t yelling. Not even close, actually. The voice Steve used to scold Tony was low, gravelly, and probably scarier than hollering would have been, and it clearly caught the sub’s attention. The previous fire that had resided in his eyes had dulled completely; now, he was just staring at Steve with wide, doe-like eyes. Before Steve could even continue, fresh tears were welling up in the submissive’s eyes and he was crying out an apology, “I’m sorry!”
She let out another sigh, clearly frustrated but just nodded in understanding, “Okay, sweetheart. We are going to talk about it more when I get there, though, okay?”
Tony frowned at the thought of having to get up, but he knew she was right. He hated morning breath and clogged pores.
His mind was still cloudy so the question mostly just confused him; he didn’t really realize what they'd been talking about could potentially get him in trouble until it was too late.
because his very presence forced Tony to face things he'd been doing just fine ignoring for years. So, yeah, stupid fucking Steve.
good,” he managed to stress after a minute, forcing his eyes open again so he could attempt to glare at Steve, “You just dunno yet. You’ll see.”
Tony Stark, ever the stubborn idiot, chose to shake his head again slowly and muster up an innocent look, “I haven’t done anything, ma’am.”
"Pepper!" was all Tony breathed out, reaching his arms out for her and engulfing her in a hug as well as he could from his bed, "You're here."
“Then we’ll begin,” Pepper announced in an almost professional manner, perfecting her posture and patting his ass a few more times. Before he had time to come up with a futile protest, the pats turned into swats and he knew it was officially
Pepper mirrored his grin, stopping what she was doing to turn around and fully face him, "Nothing but
this. His brain was screaming to run and to run far, but he knew that wasn’t smart. The only thing that
Tony did, and he was feeling worse and worse about the decisions he made when his Domme was gone the longer his punishment went on. He knew he'd been bad in lots of different ways while she was away, but this likely took the cake and it was dawning on him how disappointed she had to have been, "Yes, mama! I'll do better, I promise!"
"You okay?" Steve asked him softly once Tony seemed to be settled, head lying against his chest. When his hand went up to play with Tony's hair, it was almost instinctual, and the pleased grunt he received in response let him know the action was appreciated, "Ready for bed?"
"What do I tell you about what happened and what they did, hm?” she pushed after a minute of silence, her voice expectant. That was a question he'd heard a thousand times so she knew he knew the answer.
Pepper was silent for a moment as she seemed to process that information. It was surprisingly hard for Steve to believe that this was such unusual behavior for Tony that it caused this reaction in his former Domme. He was surprised, too, sure, but he’d only known Tony for a little over a month and he’d only saw his behavior whilst he was unsupervised. Pepper had known him for much longer and much more personally and she was
"Good. You shouldn't," she spoke bluntly before continuing in a somewhat lighter tone, "Oh, and just a heads up? Enjoy your time with the adorable and cuddly him tonight, because when he wakes up clear-headed and realizes what the hell happened, there's gonna be hell to pay. For all of us."
His defense mechanism seemed to be to make himself as undesirable as possible so nobody would bother him. It wasn’t what you would call an uncommon reaction for a submissive with Tony’s past. After ending up in an abusive bond, let alone multiple abusive bonds, it’s normal for a submissive to want to refrain from another for a while. There’s an unexplainable amount of trust that a sub is meant to put into their Dom. After previously having that trust broken and twisted into something else entirely, a submissive may be hesitant to put that trust into someone else. In Steve’s opinion, that was more than understandable.
“Loki says you’ve developed a resistance to controlling magics,” Tony relays in a disgruntled tone. He pops the faceplate to reveal his moue. Clint looks like he’s caught between murderous impulses and pride. “Does that mean you’ve tried shite on us recently?”
Steve ducks his head to hide a sheepish laugh. It’s not very effective. “Yeah, I know you. You’re gonna be bringing this up in fifty years when we’re old and grey and sitting in rocking chairs.”
“It won’t be long, now,” he tells him. He brushes the hair off of Tony’s forehead. He cups his cheek when he turns his face into Steve’s hand.
even formed omega-only units to fight on the front lines. Omega Vikings were equally likely to be labelled as berserkers as their alpha counterparts if the protection of their clans came into question. Kali, the Hindu warrior-goddess representing both creation and destruction, was oft portrayed as an omega. Steve may be from the past, but he knew exactly where these ideas about where omegas belong and what they should do came from, and how they’d spread. He knew, because the world had been a lot less egalitarian when he was a kid. Being Irish and Catholic was still a big deal. He knew firsthand what people didn’t wanna talk about now; the reason the Italian mafia and the Irish mob had to exist was that they couldn’t get real jobs at a hell of a lot of places. If nothing else will pay, crime will.
“You think Tash’s been compromised,” Steve says, slow, and something like fear and fury is overtaking him. He meets Tony’s eyes with a quiet kind of fervour that Tony knows well from the battlefield.
“You might be fired. I haven’t decided yet,” he says flatly. “Either you work for The Avengers, or you work for SHIELD, but you can’t do both.”
Tony raises his hand and knocks. And then, when there’s no response, he knocks again: once, twice, until Rogers pulls the door open, a bemused scowl on his face. He’s shaved his beard, Tony notices, which is…interesting. His expression when he sees Tony is like daybreak cresting a mountain, and then he’s pulling Tony in, tangling his fingers into Tony’s hair and kissing him like his life depends on it. He runs his tongue over Tony’s lips, sucks Tony’s lower lip into his mouth gently, and-
“No,” Tony says, and Steve’s face falls so visibly it’s like the fucking sun goes out. “No, no, I mean. Fuck. I’m too drunk for this.”
This is one of the wild sex things I was contemplating when I first considered writing an A/B/O story, but y'know what? Ball gags are a thing, so we know it's possible, and I thought it was a good way to display trust and intimacy on both sides. Teeth hazards and choking hazards? Sounds like a black-belt-level blowjob, only for the brave and talented. Tony and Steve are nothing if not foolhardy and enthusiastic, which is...close enough? Thankfully, as this is fictional AU sex, no real cocks or throats were endangered in the making of this sex scene.
Still, he can appreciate a good view no matter where he is. Why else build a skyscraper in midtown? He looks out over the glittering sky, the stunning reds and pinks of a spring sunset and the man-made light eclipsing the grace of the stars, and he tries to remember what weightlessness feels like without the crush of panic in his chest. In his mind’s eye he can see the swell of distant galaxies, the bright foreign cosmos, the empty space. He’d like to go to space on his own terms, he thinks. He’d already conquered the sky. Now he needs the cosmos.
“What’s going on?” Banner asks, walking up behind Tony. He’s holding his meagre possessions in his hands, eyes flicking nervously between them. He’s expecting violence, Steve knows. He knows how this looks.
“Which is why we ended things,” Pepper says, shrugging. “But you are mistaken if you still think that what Tony needs is a minder, like he is a wayward child that requires directing. You have learned absolutely nothing from this whole ordeal. What Tony needs is someone to remind him to be selfish. To take care of himself, not just physically, but also emotionally. Because if we let him, his guilt over what Obie did would have him tearing out his own damaged heart to hand over to the first person who asked for it.”
“Brat. Upload any readings you’ve gotten to the project folder, see if we can’t get you to be able to see him all the time.”
Bruce snarls, a little more Hulk than Bruce, but he lets Tony touch him, one hand on either side of his head. He breathes in slow, holds it, breathes out again. He waits for Bruce to calm himself. He waits for his own pulse to slow.
Tony doesn’t answer. He’s too busy trying to keep himself from breaking down into tears like a stupid fucking kid.
“Tony,” Steve says, helplessly. Blue eyes flick back to the screen, lidded dark with anguish. “I ordered you to do things. While we-… while I was touching you. I ordered you to let me touch you. I ordered you to let me tie you up.”
“SHIELD doesn’t have the authority to mandate counselling anymore,” he says, hating himself a little, “but I am, as acting leader of the Avengers. This is way out of my depth. But we’ll be with you all the way, and it isn’t a condemnation-”
“I shall take my leave,” he says, and Tony turns back to him, opening his mouth to apologise. Loki holds a hand up, and he subsides into silence. “Do not mistake me. I appreciate you holding to your end of the bargain.”
Steve rubs two knuckles against his lips, thinking. Tony still won't look at him. He's running the hot water in the work sink, testing it. Steve watches him as he moves, methodically scrubbing the grease from his hands, pushing under the nail bed, pressing against the creased skin of his knuckles.
“You need to be dead,” Natasha says, sipping on a bowl of tom kha gai. Loki nods at her once. “Why?”
“Yeah, thank you for that, Sassmonster,” Tony says, but he feels a little better. JARVIS is pretty good at that. “Do you think anyone noticed?”
Steve sat, blinking in bemusement when Tony knelt on the floor in front of him. He braced his arms over Steve’s thighs, peering up into his face.
Steve glanced at the satellite view of the town where Hydra might or might not have been spotted. “If I were Hydra I’d pick one of these concrete residential towers. If this is anything like the rest of post-Soviet Europe, the locals probably rent the apartments out to tourists pretty often. It would be easy to bring lots of different foreign folks in and out of an operation like that. Disguise tech inside big fancy cameras, bring things in and out through designer shopping bags. If you pay in cash, it’s untraceable, unlike the hotels. A lot of these folks are happy to take a wad of Euros or Dollars and stay quiet. They don’t trust the authorities, honestly with good enough reason.”
Steve’s desperate for it. Sloppy. Tony takes control of the kiss, turning it slow, dirty. He matches their pace to the gruelling grind he’s set up inside Steve’s body, unlike any other fucking he’s ever done before. Slowly, Steve gentles, until his mouth is slack and taking Tony’s tongue. He sucks on it sweetly, and Tony feels it when he goes completely under, shuddering hard but otherwise quiescent in his grip. When he pulls away Steve moans, low and exquisite, and rests his forehead against Tony’s.
“Look, Pep, what do you want me to say? We’ve had this fight a hundred times, and the end result is always the same. I go, and you’re mad at me, and I come home, and you forgive me because I’m a mess. It’ll be just peachy.”
“In many polytheistic myths, the goddess of love appears to men as the combined aspects of all the women he has ever loved,” Natasha explains, a small smile blooming on her face. “Your reaction would suggest that it’s not just romantic love or lust, but maternal and fraternal love as well.”
“Look, what do you want me to say, Pep? You’re always right, but this time you’re wrong. This isn’t on you. It’s on him.” He clears his throat, taps the arc reactor, steals a piece of pasta. “And you don’t make my life harder. I couldn’t tie my shoes without you, remember?”
“Have you eaten?” Clint asked, and Steve shook his head mutely. Clint wasn’t wearing his hearing aids, and Steve wasn’t feeling particularly chatty. “Well. There’s some Thai in the fridge. Knock yourself out. I’d offer to cook, but I’m more likely to set fire to the kitchen right now, so. Come in whenever you’re ready.”
Tony stands, leaning down to kiss Pepper on the cheek and moving towards the outdoor rigging. He’s found that giving the two of them time to speak a bit without his interference is always a good idea. Instead, he steps onto the balcony and waits, glancing towards the lower platform where Barton is prepping the jet. The April air is humid and warm, and he spreads his hands on the rail and breathes in.
“You’re right, I’m a hot mess. But enough about me. You wanna tell me about a book you read. Let me guess,
“I know.” Tony takes a deep breath, lets it out. He thinks of Rhodey’s handsome face twisted in disappointment, the thin slash of Pepper’s mouth when she’s supressing a hurt. He remembers the way Loki had melted from defence to gentleness at a word. “I’m sorry.”
We will have a brief pause now. If this novel were a theater, you could go out into the lobby, wait in line for a drink, or for the bathroom. Give people a chance to admire your clothes, hair, or jewels. Step outside for some air or a smoke. Backstage the crew would be busy transforming the scenery, actors would change their costumes and redo their makeup. Some would be done until final curtain, others awaiting their first entrance.
“Tony,” Bruce said, sighing now, “I really think you should consider the issue more seriously. I understand why you don’t want to come out. I get it. But-”
“What am I missing?” Tony demands, rubbing a hand over his face. “I’m missing something big, Rhodey. What the hell am I missing?”
But Ms. Bliss is shaking her head. “I am saying that change is rare, and most men don’t have the strength to let it happen,” she corrects. “Tell me, Captain Rogers: do you think yourself capable?”
Loki looks down and pulls away. “Rub your wounds in the face of the captain’s guilt, will you? That’s not very heroic, Stark.”
“I know what you’ve been through,” Steve says, and Tony’s mouth snaps shut. “Just because you don’t think it’s a big deal, Tony-”
Steve doesn’t touch him for days after, too horrified at his own lack of self-control. It’s everything he’d feared. Tony, for his part, throws himself headfirst into his work. He perfects a new cloaking technology, although what makes it superior to the already unbelievable stuff Tony had before Steve doesn’t know. Eventually he pushes out so many prototypes to R&D that Pepper comes looking for him. She takes one look at him and, without a word regarding his condition, spends a whole two hours watching a silly animated film called
The worst part of this stalemate with Pepper was that before this, Steve and Pepper had been something approaching friends. They both liked art and culture, and they both worried incessantly about Tony. They’d had some excellent conversations about Basquiat and Haring and other artists that Steve had missed. They’d even been to MoMA together with Tash.
Tony pushes his wrist away, tilting his nose up snobbishly. “And put the part with the tab on the convex side. Frisbees have ridges on the top to induce a turbulent boundary layer. It reduces drag on the disc. You want the bottom to be the smooth underside of the can.”
“Tony,” Beth says warningly, a tone Tony remembers well from when they were together. It’s a tone that means that either he does things the easy way, or Beth will
“I am perfectly personable, unlike some,” JARVIS says primly, and Tony snickers. “The last of the legion is through.”
“-and I think I’ve been pretty clear on my stance on Gyrich,” Ulrich is saying, while Perino nods. Tony’s always thought she was less horrific than plenty of her compatriots on the channel. “Gyrich’s proposed policies towards enhanced individuals have been labelled as draconian by some, and I myself have raised some serious questions about the comments he’s made regarding the situation in Latveria. So it’ll be a huge change to see McCoy, who is of course enhanced himself, as the face of American influence on the project. Many will see it as an improvement.”
“Wish we could’ve Sight Bonded,” Tony murmurs sleepily. He presses his face into Bruce’s shoulder. “Smell nice.”
“Tony,” Steve tries, but he’s laughing too hard to get his breath properly, now. His voice is a weak wheeze of laughter. “Stop it.”
“Since when are you and Bucky best buddies?” Steve asks him. He scrubs a hand over the back of his head, some cousin of jealousy bubbling up in his chest. It’s irrational. Stupid. But it’s what he’s feeling right now, dangerous and unbridled in his chest.
Loki looks down at the floor, grinning a bit. He looks up and meets Tony's eye from beneath his lashes. "We've been here before."
They’d scheduled some time out of Tony’s business trip to just be together. Tony had asked Steve to come with him, offering to show him around town, let him see Stark corporate. The SI campus was enormous, practically its own town, and Steve had marvelled at the compound. Mostly, though, he’d just enjoyed his time with Tony. He knew the alpha had been worried about being attentive enough to an omega long-term, but he was determined to convince Tony that he was in it for the long haul. He didn’t want anyone else. He couldn’t even imagine it.
“Eat,” Thor says, gesturing with his fork. “Eat and replenish your strength before you must once again descend into your workshop to scheme and plot an end to our enemies.”
Tony meets her gaze unflinchingly, remembering the freezing cold of the desert at night and the burn of the sand against his dry, cracking skin.
“I know that you’re from the Great Depression and all, but nowadays physiology isn’t consent,” Tony said, frowning. “I’m not that alpha.”
“I think I’m seeing clearly for the first time in months, actually,” Tony laughs. He feels freed, almost, now that he’s made a decision. He feels like he could sink to the bottom of the sea and sleep. It’s the calmest he’s felt in so long. Since the night he connected Stark Tower to the arc reactor and Pepper had smiled at him over a glass of champagne. How simple his life had been then. How clear. He’d known where he was going, and who he was going with. Everything had been so easy.
“Bruce’ll know if it’s okay for us to see each other,” Steve said, nodding at him. He was relieved when Bruce nodded back. “You’ll all definitely know if it’s not. I’m not even sure if it’s a good idea for me to hear his voice in person, although coms should be fine. But most importantly, we absolutely cannot scent each other. Not until Bruce clears it. Do I make myself clear?” He met the eyes of each of his team individually, waiting until he got a nod from each of them. Thor and Clint looked a little horrified, but Nat just seemed determined. Bruce’s expression was all empathy, however, and it made Steve want to break down sobbing at the table. “Break my legs if you have to. I’ll heal. Do whatever you need to do to keep me from him. If you care about us, you’ll do this for us. Please.”
The expression that graces Steve’s face when he opens his eyes is fragile. It’s delicate enough that Tony reaches out a hand to touch the edge of one sharp cheekbone, and the way Steve melts into the touch is like magic. It feels like all the pressure in the room goes out in the rush of Steve’s relieved exhale, and Tony just stands there, waits for it to happen.
“He trained me,” Natasha corrects him, and Tony stills. He pulls his head back, straightening his spine out of its languor. His fingers tighten on the back of the chair.
“If we bring them back,” he says, and Steve hums to show he’s listening, “it won’t…it won’t be the same. I know that.”
Tony rolls out of bed sometime around noon, and spends a good twenty minutes in the shower. Steve sits on the floor outside of the bathroom, waiting, and tries to puzzle out what the hell the trick is to interacting with the world around him. He doesn’t fall through the floors, but he can go through windows. Sometimes, he can lean against tables or counters. Sometimes, his hands go right through.
“There’s nothing to get messy! Loki’s…flirting, and Pepper even said I should encourage him so he’ll be seduced to the dark side. Or, the not-dark side. The rebellion? And Steve’s…just imprinted like the little lost duckling he is. I’ll talk to him.”
There was something about the Dom’s voice that made Tony felt safe, like being swaddled in a warm blanket in a really soft bed. His touch enhanced that feeling tenfold. Despite his overall wariness about the whole situation, it helped him relax as Steve got him settled down on his couch. Tony was thankful - standing was only getting harder.
“I’ll try to make it harder for you next time,” Pepper stated softly, sympathetic in a subtle way but also a way that made Tony feel
The submissive frowned, squirming uncomfortably against Steve's thighs at the topic of conversation. He didn’t like talking about his past. And he definitely didn’t want Steve to know about everything that had happened to him. If he ever did manage to make it over Tony’s 30-foot-high emotional brick wall, his past trauma would send him running for the hills. He didn't want that. For the moment, at least, he wanted Steve to stay.
“Jarvis,” Tony whispered once he remembered how to talk, trying to focus on something besides Steve's magical fingers scratching at his sensitive scalp again, “Can you call Pepper for me?”
After a moment of debating with himself, Steve decided to go ahead and be the bad guy. It was nearing four in the morning and the submissive was
He smiled to himself as he hit the button to open the elevator, feeling embarrassingly…giddy. It had been a
“I don’t want to stay by myself either,” he whole-heartedly agreed, jerking at the sudden reminder that it was really late and Pepper still wouldn’t be home for
"Where're you?" he mumbled after a moment of comfortable silence, finally managing to take in her visible surroundings. It was fairly dark, and there was a barely audible murmur of distant conversation in the background, "You busy?"
, he just wanted to kiss his head and protect him forever. He fought the urge to, instead settling for a small smile and nod, "Of course, you can talk to Pep, buddy. That was the agreement, after all. Here you go."
Out of nowhere, the sound of breaking glass startled him. His eyes shot open to see the beer bottle he’d previously been holding had hit the ground of the balcony, leaving shards of glass and what was left of the liquid on the ground beneath them.
like this. He was beautiful even when he was being hellish, so he was like an angel sent directly to Steve when he wasn’t.
“Oh, he’s something to marvel at, alright,” There was a tinge of hilarity in Pepper’s tone as she spoke, but Steve could tell she meant it, too. It was clear she loved him – just by the little things, like the way she spoke about him – and Steve was more than happy to see it. Tony deserved it.
He didn't have much to offer back to her besides a smile and an unintelligibly affirmative hum in response to her. He knew she'd understand – she always did.
Pepper visibly deflated, letting out a long breath before she settled for a nod, "Thanks, Steve - For everything, really. I don't want to think about what could have happened if you would have let him go down on his own."
Despite the fact that he was a grown man and so was Tony, that was still great news to hear. Pepper was apparently the most important person in Tony's life, so if she didn't like Steve that would put quite a damper on things. It wouldn't have stopped Steve - as stated before, they were adults - but it was still better to have Pepper on his side.
“Jarvis, where can I find a washcloth?” Steve asked the ceiling, turning towards the bathroom since he figured that’s where they would be.
"I'll try," he answered after a moment of silence, figuring he'd gotten enough rest to get at least one of those tasks done, "You gotta go now?"
Steve maybe wasn't all the way safe, but Tony didn't think he'd hurt him like that. Or at least he really hoped he wouldn't.
as you may be able to tell, i revised what was once 8 chapters into three, longer ones. i hope it isn't confusing at all; you don't need to reread to understand what's going on, but I did make some minor tweaks.
That was the answer Pepper seemed to be expecting and she quickly gave a short nod in response, "Alright, sweetheart. That's fine."
was the one to let in? Not completely, not yet, but he'd made it much further than a lot of other Dominants in his position. Of course, they were all dicks, but he still felt special in a way he never had before.
He couldn’t stop the steady flow of tears – not that he actually put in that much effort – but he was mostly silent while he did his business. Admittedly, he may have washed his hands for a lot longer than necessary, but once that was done with that he obediently headed back into the bedroom.
By the time he made it to his room, he just wanted to crash onto the leather sofa placed conveniently in the middle of his space and call it a day. Not because it was a particularly long walk from the living area to his bedroom (his floor
Tony was nodding and handing him his phone before he even fully processed the question. His tone was just so calm and sweet and he
“The real me is no better,” he grumbled, pushing his face back into Steve’s chest. He obviously wasn’t very interested in what he had to say.
Before he could decide if he was annoyed with the way she'd threatened him or amused by her mama-bear-like protective nature, the familiar British voice rang out throughout Tony's living room (Steve wasn't sure if the enormous open space he was in that connected to a kitchen and dining room area could be considered a living room, but that was his best guess), interrupting his thoughts. "Excuse me, sir?"
"It will be very soon, Anthony. I promise," she assured him patiently, "You know it's about a six-hour flight. You need to sleep until I get there,
The submissive sat in silence for a moment while Steve moved around, both feeling and looking lost. He couldn't quite figure out what it is he was supposed to be doing, and that confusion was beginning to upset him again. Steve knelt down in front of him when he noted that he was starting to hyperventilate, using a finger to lift his chin and initiate eye contact, "Hey there," he greeted softly when Tony's wide eyes met his, giving him a small smile, "Where's your phone?"
He voiced this to Pepper, who didn’t question it any further, “Well, I’m sure he’ll be seeing you around, anyway.”
Tony nodded slowly, swallowing his irritation with Steve for the time being. He wasn't there anymore, which was a
Steve barked a laugh as he began to push himself off of the couch, heading in the direction of Tony's quarters, "Well, of course. I wouldn't have expected anything else."
“I know, sweet boy. Trust me, I know,” she told him softly. Her voice was sad, as it always was when he brought something like this up,  “I’ve told you, no matter what, you’ll always be my boy. I know it’s hard right now, but you know that’s only because I’ve been gone for so long. I’m usually only a phone call away and you know that.”
Ignoring the submissive's whine of protest, Steve slowly stood up with him cradled in his arms and began to carry him into the unnecessarily large restroom, "Let's get you ready for bed, sweetheart."
"I love you, mama," Tony made sure to remind her before he could doze off, nuzzling against her breasts and hugging her tightly, "'m so sorry about what I did."
“I do,” Tony whimpered. He did know that. When Pepper was in New York, she came when he called. No questions asked. Helen didn't mind, and she didn't need half as much attention as Tony required. So when he needed Pepper, she was usually available. But Pepper hadn’t been there in almost three months, so her absence was becoming Tony’s new normal and it was affecting his mental, “Just...miss you.”
Despite the reassuring words, Tony gave him a teary, wary look. When it became clear that suggestion wasn't good enough for him either, Steve had to bite back a sigh. He was running out of options, and he was considering just letting Tony have his way. One night in a slightly-worn t-shirt wouldn't be the death of him. It did feel like a few steps in the wrong direction when it came to establishing his dominance and demonstrating his ability to properly care for him, but he was okay with choosing his battles. They made some huge strides in the last few hours and he didn't want to blow it over a shirt.
Though Steve was sure he would deny it, Tony was barely keeping himself upright at that point. He blinked sleepily up at the Dom, patiently waiting for whatever was next. Once Steve was more comfortable, he moved back towards the bed and sat on the edge next to Tony. The sub didn’t wait until Steve was comfortable to climb back into his lap, so he had to finish getting himself adjusted against the headboard with a lapful of Tony.
But he couldn't, not when he was in such a state. Because Steve was nice and his touch was nice and he hadn't felt anything so great in what felt like forever. Or, maybe he never had. One thing was for sure, though, and that was that he didn't hate him, nor did he hate that he was there with him. He just really, really wanted to, and he hated himself because he couldn't. He'd rather just keep being Pepper's. Even if she wasn't his, it was still safer than wanting to be Steve's. Plus, Pepper would be back soon. That wouldn't change the fact that he was sharing her, but she'd still be back there with him.
She changed the subject after that, successfully pulling Tony into a better mood than the one he'd just slipped down into. Tony happily chatted with his former Dominant about anything besides Steve. The second she even tried to touch on that subject, Tony would clam up and start talking about something else. He didn't want to talk about Steve. He didn't want to think about him. He just wanted him to leave him alone.
argument was now even less believable than before. He quickly continued before Pepper could point that out herself, "How long 'til you're home?"
Tony stressed, feeling very teary all of a sudden. Tony hated a lot of things about himself, but how much of a baby he was when he was actually being himself was the absolute worst. He spent most of his day acting like an untouchable, unfazed tough guy, so when he actually was somewhere with someone where he felt comfortable, he tended to cry over just about anything due to holding in all of his emotions throughout the day.
Tony was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he almost didn’t notice Steve walking away. He didn’t know much at the time, but he knew he was feeling vulnerable as hell. So when he saw Steve about to open the sliding doors to rejoin the party, he couldn’t stop himself...
And it wasn't completely one-sided either. Not if all of the sputtering and blushing Tony did whenever the two of them spoke was anything to go off of. Steve had plenty of patience and time to wait for Tony to come around. He wasn't worried about that. However, he was expecting a lot more time to pass before he ended up with Tony bawling in his lap, nearly inconsolable.
Steve kept a hand on his back on the way up, and it took every ounce of willpower Tony had left in him not to lean into him. The touch on his back was okay. That was just grounding more than anything, but he didn’t want to go any further than that. Allowing Steve to touch him was what got them there in the first place.
“Yeah, I suppose you should. Don't worry, it doesn't take long," Pepper informed him with a grin,” Besides, that's probably not even what you should be worried about."
"That's the only time I get hungry," he defended, picking with the buttons of Steve's shirt, "It's not my fault."
“Do you want me to call Rhodes?” Steve finally asked when Tony didn't seem to be calming down at all. He moved his hand back to the sub’s hair once he realized it was doing more than the back rubbing. He was being as attentive as possible to learn some new information to utilize as well as he could.
"It's meant to," she reminded him of what he already knew, continuing to rain down spanks in a way that was making Tony's ass catch fire. Much like always, he was wondering how he ever complained or cried from her hand; it didn't sting half as fucking bad as the brush. He always reminded himself to enjoy his warm-ups for what they were, but it hardly ever stuck with him until his next punishment.
Of course, this irrational anger was only enhanced by the frustration setting in, because it seemed like he had only
behaving like one,” Pepper seemed unbothered by Anthony’s attitude as she continued, matching his glare tenfold, “It wasn’t put in place for no reason, Tony. When you don’t eat or sleep and then lie to me about it,
take care of. That's where the balance lied and that's what he'd been trying to explain to Tony out on the balcony. There was a balance that needed to be kept, and that's why they bonded.
“Then show me, buddy,” Steve decided to settle on something a little encouraging, gently forcing his head back down onto his chest and rubbing his scalp the way he liked, “Just relax. You’re safe and Pepper will be here very soon, okay? It’s time to sleep.”
she was talking about. Jarvis. Jarvis and the stupid fucking babysitting protocol. He felt his heart sink to his stomach as it dawned on him that she
Steve shook his head fondly, figuring he should have seen the smart-assed response coming. He was glad Tony was beginning to feel comfortable enough with him to be bratty again. A sassy submissive was one who knew he was safe. For the time being, that was all Steve wanted.
The glazed look in his eyes made it obvious he was still very much floating through subspace, but the sounds of the movie playing behind him must have intrigued him enough to turn around. Steve eventually recognized it as one of the Star Wars movies, though he had no clue which one. The franchise was still incredibly confusing to him and he had no interest in figuring it out. Tony, however, was obviously a fan, so Steve knew he might end up getting more familiar with it then he intended.
, then of course I’m going to want to keep an eye on you. There was only way to do it from across the country. I know you feel like I don’t trust you – I’m sorry that it upsets you – but you knew better than to just go in and do away with it by your own volition.”
The slew of praise and the idea of rewards brightened Tony's mood a little as he gave another enthusiastic nod, "Yes, ma'am. I'll be good."
“Jarvis, can you turn it down a little bit?” Steve asked the A.I. once Tony seemed to calm down, eliciting a put upon sigh from him in response. Ignoring his stroppy mood, Steve still smiled when he addressed him, “Oh, hush. You don’t need to hear every little thing when you’re supposed to be going to sleep, anyway.”
"How'd I know..." he heard Pepper's voice from the phone in his hand and it caused a smile spread across his face. Her tone held the same exasperated fondness she used so often when handling him and it had him making impatient grabby hands at the phone, his previous turmoil long forgotten now that he was no longer alone.
didn’t like the latter choice. Besides, Tony probably had plenty of that in the first place. For as long as he was with Steve, he was going to have to deal with a little structure.
Steve let out a breathy laugh at that, pulling back so he could look down at Tony, "Well, maybe that's why you don't sleep all the time, Anthony."
Steve Rogers was persistent, and he was by no means a quitter. If Tony was a challenge meant for him, then he was going to prove it.
The fact that Tony was considering his manners, even when he was just talking to Jarvis, was even cuter. The smile he was shining at him brightened as he teased, "Well,
She didn't seem to understand that he wasn't really afraid that Steve was going to hang up and hurt him anymore; he just didn't want them to keep talking about him behind his back. He kind of knew that was silly, though.
Tony was fairly comfortable in the fact that Pepper wouldn't be upset with him for not being able to get himself to bed. He just needed help. Pepper wouldn't be mad about that.
Tony wasn't afraid of a lot, not anymore, but at that moment he was petrified. He didn't want it to happen again! He couldn't let it!
Stark for a father, that’s why,” she practically growled, bitterness and anger dripping from her words. Sometimes, Tony thought she hated those people more than him.
Tony relaxed a little bit at that. He didn't want Rhodey for this kind of stuff...not because Rhodey wasn't any good at helping him out, because he was. He wasn't quite as gentle as Pepper, but he'd helped him come down on a few separate occasions. Still, though, that was his best friend. They were equals when they were together. Tony didn't like having to change that. But Pepper...calling Pepper sounded like the best idea he'd heard all night. She was on the other side of the country, but he could hear her voice. That sounded...nice.
"And you think we're both lying?" Steve asked with a raised eyebrow, still smiling at him as he pushed his hair off of his forehead. It had started off neat and slicked back, but all of his petting and combing his fingers through it had caused it to start sticking up.
His time with Pepper on the phone came to an end much quicker than he would have liked, but he knew she had to go. And he also knew the reason that she had to go was ultimately so she could come to him, which was acceptable.
“It was no trouble,” he answered truthfully, smiling back at her before he began to walk towards the elevator, “I’m sure he’ll have plenty of
“I got it,” he remembered to respond; even as he began to admire the biggest claw-foot tub he’d ever seen. The architecture of the whole bathroom was beautiful and it was clear to Steve that Tony had good taste. Or at least whoever designed his bathroom surely did.
behave himself for Steve, as much as he was regretting it, but he was still pretty pissed at him for making him drop in the first place. He'd been
Another nod into his pillow, though this one was much slower and plagued with the sounds of him trying to catch his breath, "Yes, mama," Tony answered miserably after a moment of hesitation. He knew what was to come after his answer, but he also knew that it was the only way to be finished.
many spankings, and that continued well into his adulthood under his God father's care. Back then, he was pretty hardened to it. Once he got under Pepper's care, though, and realized how it was supposed to be, he somehow morphed into a huge crybaby. Pepper spent a lot of time reassuring him how perfectly okay that was, but he still didn't like it; he just couldn't change it.
The submissive made a face at that but declined to argue any further. Instead, he curled closer to Steve and asked a question he already knew the answer to, "When is your plane supposed to land?"
he was wrong, but even though Pepper was right – he felt like she didn’t trust him and although she had good reason, it still kind of hurt Tony’s feelings. If he would just take care of himself, or at least tell the truth about
“I consider him the eighth wonder of the world, mostly,” she joked with a shrug, looking towards the hallway as if she was expecting him to come waltzing out. Steve didn’t think he heard anything to suggest that he’d woken up, so he was confused when Pepper continued, “Jarvis, is Tony up?”
Unfortunately for him, unlike the majority of nights for the past few months, Pepper was witnessing him getting sleepier and sleepier during their phone call. She could tell the signs of course. When her side conversation was over, she returned her attention to him and informed him that he needed to go and get ready for bed.
“You left his door open,” she answered with a chuckle, moving to take a seat across from Steve, “He should hear us. If he doesn’t, he’ll ask Jarvis.”
"Where is he?" Tony snarled as well as he could, opening his eyes to look at Pepper. He didn't want to be rude in her presence, but he wanted her to know that the previous night was just a fluke and he did
“No,” Tony answered without hesitation, casually, as if Steve was just offering him a mint. The Dominant sighed; he should have known that was probably asking too much.
"You're such a good boy for mama," Pepper comforted him in the soft, childlike voice he'd come to know and love - especially when he was like this, "I know it hurts, but we're all done with it now, aren't we?"
He was nodding before Steve even finished talking, allowing himself to be pushed back this time. Steve was worried Tony would be uncomfortable stripping in front of him, hence why he was going to let him have some privacy to change clothes, Tony wasn't interested in that idea. He also wasn't outwardly embarrassed about the situation at all. Keeping that in mind, Steve went ahead and reached down to unbutton his slacks.
have a crush on me, Pepper," he grumbled around a forkful of his dinner, "He's like, 90, or something. And even if he wasn't, I doubt I'm the face of America's type."
"I can take you with me," he objected, frowning at Steve. What the hell did they need to keep talking about without him, anyway? He wasn’t a puppy in need of instructions for the house sitter.
Tony thought to himself as he lowered back to the bed, dreadfully. Those words always set panic off in his brain; it almost never ended well. Did Steve tell on him? He said he wouldn’t…but Steve didn’t seem much for lying to other Dominants. Tony didn't think he seemed much for lying to
before the pair called it a night. He was about to remind Tony that it was okay if he wasn't comfortable with that, either, but Tony spoke up before he had the chance.
"I'm not sure you'd have such great things to say about him, though," she continued, sounding much grimmer, "I'm sorry for the way I'm sure he's been treating you. It scares him when people try to get close, so he lashes out. It's nothing personal."
taking care of himself, Pepper wouldn’t have to go to lengths she did to make sure he was doing so. He understood that, but it was still never that easy when eating and sleeping just took up so much
“How are you doing?” Steve asked gently, pulling Tony out of his thoughts. He’d definitely zoned out again, "You okay?"
Pepper was more than used to that type of change in demeanor from him and she adjusted accordingly, "I miss you, too, honey. Just a few more weeks and we'll be back."
He felt a slight sense of panic begin to set in; it always did once they got to this point. The point where he knew what Pepper was upset about and that he was
"I'm listening, buddy," Steve assured him, resting his head against his. He could tell by his demeanor and tone that what the sub was expressing was far from new, so he knew there wasn't much he could do about it besides deal with his hand in it and speak to Pepper in the morning, "I hear you; you're cold and you're not tired. But, do you remember what you promised Pepper?"
“Yes, you are, Anthony,” Steve said into Tony’s ear, gentle but firm. He whined and squirmed at the words, but Steve continued, “We have to sleep. That’s what we promised Pepper and that is what you need. Now, would you like me to hold you for a little while longer, or do you want to go whine in your bed? Those are your choices, but I’m not gonna put up with the tantrum, sweetheart, so you have to pick.”
Tentatively, Tony peaked over at Steve who'd perched himself on the edge of the couch once he finished with the submissive's shoes. He was trying to search for any sign that this isn't what
Tony obviously agreed, instantly whining and curling into Steve in reaction to the loud noise, "Too loud, Jarvis!"
Tony peaked up at him as he crossed the room, eyeing the water bottle warily when Steve started to open it, “I’m not thirsty…”
A part of him knew that he needed to. He simply could not keep on as he had been, but the way he'd been going was so
She was heading towards his bed before he could force himself out of it, a grin on her face that matched his, "Good morning, my sweet boy."
, did he want to pop Tony’s ass. It would have been cake to flip him over his knee and let him know all of the ways in which what he just did was
“Yes, ma’am,” he answered quietly, his usual qualms about getting enough sleep long forgotten for the time being, “Is Helen coming? I wanna show her some new stuff I’m working on, Pep. She’s coming, right?”
"Whether he chooses to go to sleep or just cry in your lap all night," Pepper was chuckling as she answered him, but he could tell she was dead serious, "Tony comes with a lot of long nights. Luckily for you, I don't see tonight being one of the bad ones, but you never know. That's why I want you to be absolutely sure you'd like to stay instead of calling Rhodey. I just don't think it's fair for you to see his worst on the first night."
Steve didn’t intend to outright praise Tony like that, but he couldn't help it. Right in front of him, there was a sad submissive who was obediently doing something he disliked, despite the fact that it upset him even further. How was he supposed to just sit back and ignore that? He deserved a little praise. Despite the fact that Tony wasn't his submissive nor was he even the one who gave him the order, the soft ‘good boy’ seemed right.
"I'll be sure to keep a close eye on him," Steve assured her with a nod, "I don't want him to be sorer than necessary, either."
And just like that, it was all starting to fall back apart. Everything was okay until there was a moment like this - a moment where he was made painfully aware that his Domme wasn't really
night and I happened to stumble upon a sub who needs to be cared for. And that sub happens to be Anthony. That's all. It's not like this was a date gone wrong. It has nothing to do with Anthony and I's...situation. And even if it did, I wouldn't hold anything I see against him. I know he can't help it."
"Thank God," she joked, sounding relieved, "I had a nifty little set-up where Jarvis reported back to me whenever Tony was knowingly misbehaving, but he went out of his way to disable that about a month into this trip. He's under the impression I still don't know. Since he's already due to be dealt with for
"That means we've gotta get you in your bed," he informed him once he was sure he had nothing to say, running a hand up and down his back, "So you can rest like you promised her. I doubt you can do that too well in what you're wearing."
For the most part, Tony had grown accustomed to spending most of his time alone. He didn’t always have the best coping mechanisms when it came to his loneliness, but he was used to it. Unfortunately though, whether he liked it or not, that ability to cope and ignore the overwhelming need to be loved and touched and coddled went out of the window as soon as Steve pulled him into his lap. He could rebuild his wall in the morning.
The not so logical part, though? It was telling him that his Domme was being ridiculous. That he wasn’t capable of giving her what she was asking for and she knew that. It was too
– it was all over. Tony’s plan to get Steve to just leave him alone with minimal complications went completely out of the window. He was
. After a moment and a little more encouragement from Pepper, both physical and verbal, Tony managed to make it to the top of his bed, flopping down onto his heap of pillows. Pepper pulled his sleep pants and boxers, which had both ended up pooled around his ankles, completely off of him and laid them on the end of his bed. He didn't mind the lack of clothes; Pepper was one person he was never shy around, and he didn't want the pressure of anything against his ass until the fire had dulled some. Staying half-naked was much more comfortable.
“I think I may have hurt his feelings...” Steve spoke after he watched the visually discouraged sub close the door to his personal bathroom. It was a little amusing to see him behave in such a childish manner, but that was only because Tony was so damn cute. Besides that, he mostly just felt guilty. The submissive was clearly having a long night. It wasn't his place to be correcting or commenting on his attitude anyway. Or, well, maybe it was. Steve didn't know. He was beginning to second guess himself again.
“In the restroom, sir,” Jarvis confirmed his assumption, prompting him to begin heading in there. He wasn’t surprised to hear Tony whine from behind him, “I’m not going anywhere, honey. Hold on.”
Tony gripped at Steve's shirt when he stepped back, not allowing him to pull too far away before he spoke, "I really don't think pajamas are gonna make too much of a difference, Sir."
“Goodnight, Anthony,” Steve almost cooed, scratching Tony’s scalp in the way that made him purr. He was already learning him - or the basics, at least.
counts as ready for bed, Anthony," Steve lightly scolded as he caught sight of the sub still sprawled out across the couch. He feigned stern, but Tony could mostly tell he was just teasing, "Considering how you're not even
"Here," he grunted out after a moment, shoving the phone in Steve's direction. He was more upset himself than them, but he was never good at dealing with being angry with himself. He preferred to just take it out on everyone else.
somebody to care for him, no matter how much he fucking hated it. And Pepper knew that, too. In fact, she knew it better than him because she
Tony nodded vigorously with a smile on his face, cheeks turning red. Deep down, he knew this was just Pepper trying to leave him in the best possible spirits before she had to hang up. But, he also knew that whether he believed it or not, she definitely did. And because of that, her words were like music to his ears.
His heart fluttered a little bit when Steve grinned at him with a fond look in his eyes. He tickled at his sides a little bit as he spoke, “I believe it was about a certain
“I think I’ll go ahead and head out, now,” he announced after a long drawl from his mug, setting it down before standing up from his stool, “I should let him process for a little while before I show my face again. Let him decide what he wants to do.”
, so Tony didn't like it when he had to take care of him. Steve had a feeling that didn't have as much to do with Rhodes not
It was pitiful. Steve actually had to refrain from cooing at the submissive, but it didn’t take a genius to know that wouldn’t help. Instead, he began rocking them back and forth, shushing the distraught sub as he did so.
to give it to him. The only way she could force him into anything would be to go through the legal system and get him deemed unfit. It was a long, extensive process that would just end with Tony resenting her, the dominant he'd been paired with, and anyone else who had anything to do with it. Steve didn't have to know the sub personally to know that he'd just end up making everyone else as miserable as him until he got his way.
He admittedly did feel a little awkward just standing, but he figured it wouldn’t take long; He could already hear Tony moving behind him, undoubtedly not wanting it to take any longer than necessary. He wouldn’t say it, but Steve knew he would want back into his lap.
"When do you need to leave?" she asked Steve, not bothering to put the camera back on her before she spoke, "I'm gonna get a hold of Rhodey and see if he can come up there. I don't want him to be left alone tonight."
be sorry. This was a very naughty thing to do. Hopefully, you'll remember exactly how sorry you are next time you consider doing something like this."
“Why don't we talk to her about what you were just telling me?” Steve spoke for the first time in a while as he tightened his arms around the boy who was obviously seeking some more comfort, forcing Tony back into reality (well, for the most part), "I think Pepper would like to know how you're feeling."
A little vulnerability was one thing, but flat out showing weakness like that...Tony couldn’t do it. Steve could tell Pepper, or Rhodey, or anyone else who could help force Tony into a legal bond because they were worried about him. Pepper had already threatened it before when Tony had forgotten to eat...or sleep...or leave his lab for days at a time. They didn’t need any more evidence that he wasn’t doing okay on his own.
Eventually, he managed to convince himself that he was comfortable being alone. Nobody could hurt him or use him or
Steve gave an exasperated sigh. Before he could respond, though, Jarvis spoke up for him, “Some have already been lied out in Tony’s restroom, Sir.”
Instead of reaching for the phone himself, he tucked his hands in between himself and Steve's chest, allowing the Dom to hold it up for him. Just like before, he met Pepper with a goofy grin, "Hi, mama."
Once his face was clean, Steve tossed the damp rag onto the nightstand. Tony had mostly stopped crying by then, and Steve was hopeful that it stayed that way. If not, bothering to clean his face was redundant.
and said something so adorable, he was even more smitten. He offered a warm smile, letting the emotion he was feeling flood his voice as he spoke, "I promise, Anthony. And I keep my promises."
Sometimes, however, he did envy submissives that enjoyed the heavier play; if he did, too, then he wouldn’t have to hate Pepper’s hairbrush so damn much. Of course, he knew she would just find something worse if push ever came to shove, but he figured a boy could dream.
He couldn’t help but whine as she got him situated; head, chest, and shoulders resting on the bed while his ass stuck up over her lap and his legs dangled helplessly behind him. It was a position all too familiar to both of them, and Tony quickly reached up to snag a pillow from the head of the bed; he liked to have something to hold on to. Once he seemed comfortable, Pepper spread her thighs just enough for his soft cock to dangle between them. Tony knew it was so he couldn’t get any friction against her legs, but he never wanted any, anyway.
“Hey, that’s okay,” Steve soothed, snapping himself out of his thoughts after the submissive's soft apology, keeping his hands up and clear for Tony to see as he made up the distance between them, “It looks comfortable, but it’s a little wet. This one’s clean and dry. I think it would be better, don't you?”
“I...” he tried to speak, but all of a sudden his mouth was dry and his brain wasn’t working properly. All he really knew for sure was that his guard had just been blown to pieces within less than a minute and he needed the conversation to be over before he did something stupid.
Tony knew her well enough to see her fight a smile, but it was quickly replaced with a displeased scowl. She didn't seem as amused now, “I think you know what
Pepper had yet to actually meet Steve, but Tony had told her plenty about him. Of course, she was only hearing bad things about him, but she knew Tony was exaggerating most of it.
Pepper and her Submissive, Helen, had been out of the state for nearing three months by then for Helen's work, and Tony was slowly but surely going crazy. This was the longest he'd ever been away from her since she came into his life and he was having a hard time dealing with being constantly left to his own devices.
After another period of time passed, the submissive was letting out his hundredth yawn of the night. It was then Steve decided he needed to start taking the necessary steps to help get him to sleep. When he noticed that he was still nearly fully dressed, he figured he'd start there.
Steve bit back a laugh at that himself, his guilt easing up some. A long night cuddling with the adorable submissive didn't sound half bad, even if he was periodically being a little brat, "I'm pretty sure we'll manage."
It didn’t take long for Steve to fall asleep sitting next to him, his back and head resting back on the headboard. He wasn’t sure exactly when he stopped staring at Tony and passed out, but he knew a lot of time couldn’t have possibly passed before he heard movement coming from somewhere down the hallway. Once he looked over at a clock and saw the time, he knew it had to be Pepper.
him to get in bed. He knew what he would prefer, and it definitely wouldn’t be lying down by his lonesome.
Tony did just that for several minutes, letting out everything he had pent up from the last few months. He'd been having a really rough time, and he'd been playing tough for
So, when it started to hurt, he started to cry. The sting wasn't too bad at first; just enough to have him crying steadily to himself. Just like always, though, it built up more and more with every swat. It wasn't long before he was squirming, instinctually trying to avoid the swats. Pepper wasn't swayed, just pulling him tighter to her and continuing to rain down the swats on his poor, exposed bottom.
Steve chuckled as he handed the phone off to him, watching fondly as Tony grinned at the camera, "Pepper."
job of putting him back together, but damn it, she tried. And she took care of him, whether it meant canceling plans or blistering his backside or cuddling him or literally putting her life on hold for
was about him going over her head (or behind her back, really) and intentionally disabling a protocol she put in place and then keeping it from her. Tony knew how wrong that was and the more he thought of it, an uneasy feeling began to set in the pit of his stomach. From plenty of experience, he’d come to know this feeling as guilt.
At first, he figured she was just being the overprotective mama bear that she was being the previous night, but apparently, he was wrong.
“Yes?” Steve asked him, voice as gentle as always as he re-approached him. Tony thought maybe this gentleness was just Steve trying to avoid setting him off, but then he remembered what Steve had told him: he didn't
starting to calm down a little bit. Tony had lots to cry about - he knew that plenty well - but even he could only go for so long when Pepper was holding and comforting and
"It's no problem, honest. I wasn't about to just leave him out there, and I'm not totally blameless here, even though it wasn’t my intention to send him down," Steve admitted, feeling a barely-there-but-still-there pang of guilt. After all, Tony probably would still be downstairs enjoying the party (or the balcony, at least) if Steve would have just kept his hands to himself.
telling the truth. Pepper inspected him as he spoke, but when she couldn't find any signs of a lie she gave a short nod, "I'll make you breakfast in a little while, then. And you
"Well, I'm on my way to do that now," she informed him, turning the phone and showing him the quick-moving scenery from the window of the car she was apparently in. He wondered how long she'd been driving without him noticing, "I'm going to have to get off of the phone in a minute so I can get through security and stuff, okay, sweetheart?"
flew in for him. He wanted to feel bad - he had like, one rough night (or fifty) and she hopped on a plane - but he wasn't about to complain. Both that guilt and his anger at Steve could wait.
"I suppose I should get used to it now, then," Steve said dryly after a moment. He had an odd feeling that this would be far from his first ride on Tony's emotional roller coaster. That was fine by him, though.
Stupid, stupid fucking Steve. In his current state, Tony was starting to take a liking to that name, despite its childish implications because it helped him express his conflicted feelings towards the man. It fit because Steve was okay...he liked Steve and Steve was taking good care of him. That was the only reason he even deserved a name in the first place.
"I miss you," he mumbled softly after a moment of silence, sounding much smaller than he previously had, "Wish you guys would just come home already."
So when Steve told Tony that he wasn't bad, he meant that. Anyone with eyes and a brain could see that he had been through hell. His attitude could use some work, yeah, and maybe he really needed to learn that he wasn't always in charge. A little (or a lot) more one on one attention and a sore bottom definitely couldn't hurt him, but there was still a good boy under there somewhere.
i'm sooo sorry for the wait - it's been an insane past several months, and i've worked on this throughout all of them, give or take.
his choice and he had no intention of making her feel as if it was, but he was sure that if asked, Tony would prefer his presence to Rhodey's, which is why he didn't bother saying that it was up to him. He wasn't in the best state of mind to be making his own decisions, so it was up to Pepper to make the choice that she thought would be in the sub's best interest. Steve was just about to apologize for even bringing it up when Pepper finally spoke.
against his skin. Tony knew he was becoming touch starved, it had been almost three months since he’d last saw Pepper, but
Tony chose to be helpful over petulant, thankfully, and he lifted his head up enough to point and mumble, “There’s a fridge.”
“Night, Steve,” Tony sighed out, content. He took a fistful of Steve’s shirt and closed his eyes. This time, they actually
“Is this okay?” he asked quietly, carefully gauging the sub’s reactions even though he was almost completely sure that it was just fine. Nevertheless, Tony needed to know that being touched was still a choice. Steve was still relieved when Tony gave a slight nod in response.
He was, mostly. As much as he’d love to see that angelic face, he really didn’t want to be the thing that sent him barreling into a tantrum first thing in the morning. Steve would have plenty of chances to see that face again once Tony had time to repair his defenses.
