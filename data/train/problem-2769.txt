And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might
But, with you I've found the key
“Cas, oh fuck, that was… so fucking hot. Give me a fucking second here.” He choked and huffed as his bare ass plopped on the floor and they shared satisfied grins. Cas left a hand on Dean’s knee as he waited for Dean to compose himself. Finally, with a last big inhale, he reached to pull Cas in for a kiss, then said, “Your turn, get back on that bed.”
Quietly, his mouth still attached to Castiel’s calf, Dean rasped, “You good?”
Castiel was nervous about making the dive, but he had been practicing all summer and knew he could land it. Plus, that unreasonable hunky lifeguard was on duty today and Cas had felt his green eyes watching him since he came into the pool. Cas let out a huff and walked up to the steps of the tallest diving board, which was sectioned off from the rest of the pool so diver’s could land safely. Blinking in the sun, Cas gripped the rails and looked up the height up the fifteen foot dive. Then, he couldn’t help but glance over to the lifeguard chair where he knew Dean was sitting under the shade of the big red umbrella.
“You good to stand up?” Dean asked, soft and concerned. Cas nodded, embarrassed, sore, and drooling, and allowed Dean to help him into a standing position, their skin touching somehow more distracting than the fact that Cas could have drowned. “Alright, back away people, show’s over!” Using his other hand to wave away the crowd, Dean led them to the first aid office. Cas burned with the eyes of all people staring at him. Great, he’d never be able to come back to this pool again.
Squeezing his thigh, Dean turned, “Let me just lock this door.” He walked to the door and flicked the lock, and then made sure all the blinds were closed tightly shut.
“Well Cas, to be honest I don’t think right now is a good time to try to, uh, lose my ass virginity no matter which way it’s going, so I think some other way is better.”
“Me to. Please, cum, cum inside me.” Cas jerked himself, straining against the urge, until Dean let out a guttural moan, trying to stay quiet and strangling the noise by pushing his mouth into Cas’s lifted calf. As he held himself deep inside Cas, Cas jerked himself to finish also, his cum spurting into Dean’s arm and face, and onto his own chest. It was a lot of cum, more than Cas had come in a while. And he wished he had more so he could cover Dean all over. But he was spent.
From his suggestive position, Dean asked over his shoulder, “What’s your name?”
“You wanna get fucked, babe?” Dean asked Cas, his hand running down to Cas’s ass and squeezing his cheeks. Cas was more used to topping, but for Dean, he’d do whatever he wanted.
Castiel didn’t need to hear that twice, so he obliged, pulling them together once again.
Dean sat back and wiped his mouth, “Yeah, Cas?”
Sweet to taste, saccharine
“Yeah… I think a few more minutes is a good idea.”
Dean pulled back, put his arms on Cas’s shoulders, took a breath, and said “okay, I’m gonna do it. I’m going to suck your cock!” He announced triumphantly.
Castiel moved to make out with Dean again, this time also using a free hand to begin touching him over his boxers. Dean gasped as the first touch zinged through him and a sudden surge of passion made him kiss Castiel hungrily.  Castiel’s touch was soft and gentle at first, but with Dean’s obviously growing excitement, Cas picked up his pace.
“25.”
As Castiel’s hand held his own, Dean’s heartbeat quickened and his throat became dry. Why wasn’t Cas moving his hand? And why did Dean not want him to?
And that kiss turned deeper and more full of longing as both went to use tongue, and to nibble on lips, and Dean put a hand on the back of Castiel’s head to pull him in tighter. And Castiel let his weight fall on to Dean, and in this crumpled heap they made-out hungrily like teenagers necking under the bleachers.
His excitement made Cas smile, “Well alright, what is it?”
Growing stronger day by day
I never did believe in the ways of magic
To open any door
“Jo’s out there, and Gabe’s is coming in soon. Don’t worry about that.” Dean moved back to Cas, this time pushing himself between Cas’s legs. He pulled the towel away from Cas and left his hands on his hips. Dean looked between Cas’s legs at his obvious hard-on, then up into Cas’s eyes. “Worry about me.” Dean leaned hungrily into a kiss and Castiel let him.
With all the time he was going to be spending at the pool, Cas better have a perfect dive by the end of the summer!
With a primal grunt, Dean used the lube that was all over his hands to rub onto his dick, scooping out some more just to be sure there was enough. Without needing to ask, Cas pulled open his ass cheeks and waited for Dean to take him. Dean smirked,
Making love and breaking hearts
“Wait, I got an idea.” Dean said, pulling him self into sitting position, “I’ve seen in it porn. I think it’s pretty hot and we could, you know, kind of finish at the same time if we time it right.”
Pulling himself back to reality, Cas replied, “Castiel Novak”.
“Dean, I feel like this is uncomfortable.”
Castiel slowed down their pace, taking a moment to kiss Dean sweetly on the forehead, the nose. Dean flushed, pink blistering across his face and down his chest. The intimacy of those innocent kisses was almost greater than anything else they had done.
No… he DID want this to happen again. Over and over, and as many times as it could. Because it was who he was, and it was who he wanted. It was Castiel. And Castiel was different… because Dean loved him.
“You know, I could take a few more minutes here, just to make sure you’re okay?” Dean took the couple steps that brought him back in front of Cas – the tight quarters forced Cas’s knees to knock against Dean’s hips. Dean took a hand and placed it on Cas’s thigh, fingertips touching the edge of the bleached white towel.
As they got out of the backseat to get dressed, Dean squinted in the soft morning sunlight. Panic seared through him, “As shit, Cas, the stakeout! We didn’t keep a lookout AT ALL.” His eyes swerved across the grounds of the lot of see if he could notice any movement, if any cars had been in or out. He pounded his hands on the side of the car in frustration. What if months of hard work was lost just because he had decided to get frisky instead of focus on the job?
Dean couldn’t quite believe he was the one urging their encounter, but that moment of held hands seemed to release something untamed that had welled within him. That had been caged for so long. That had been beat into him as being forbidden. But he had been to hell and back, through worse things than death. Years of shame had held him captive for so long that even in this moment he doubted his thoughts, words, and actions. But this could not be forbidden. There was nothing evil about it. And it was true to him, though he had spent years trying to prove otherwise. So when Castiel urged them into the back seat and held his head gently in his angel hands, and looked at him in a way that no one ever had… well he had to keep going.
And he went through the form getting Cas’s basic information and then making his report notes. While he wrote, Dean shifted his weight, his tight ass swaying from side to side. For Cas, any fear, shock, or embarrassment from his accident was now replaced with the fantasy of railing Dean against the desk. Any shrinkage from the cold was gone and Castiel had no idea how he would hide a now raging boner. He reached for a folded up blanket and wrapped it around himself as best he could, considering it was a little small.
Dean grinned, “Nothing, it’s just… you’re cute.”
I'm hot, sticky sweet
“Dicks, Dean.”
“Uh, well, like we would be laying pretty much on top of each other,” the sentence made Dean blush like a stupid schoolboy, “And uh, we jerk each other off like at the same time, like with our, uh…”
Triumph changed to being slightly hurt, to just being determined, so Dean pushed back Cas into the seat and lowered himself down to the angel’s hips. It was dumb to be nervous, but Dean was. He wanted to make sure it felt good for him, just like Cas had made him feel good. What if he was bad at giving head? He could never live that down. But he couldn’t just hover there forever, so… Here we go…
I can feel my love for you
“Dean, Dean calm down. It’s fine. No one came in or out.” Castiel moved around the car to Dean, putting a hand on Dean’s lower back. He was hurt when Dean swatted him away.
Don't, don't break the spell
“Okay well, you don’t have to narrate it, you can just do it.” Castiel replied with his very dry, matter of fact tone.
Dean scoffed, “Yes of course really. Now switch places.” He moved off the seat and kind of shoved Cas down to sit. At some point Cas had taken his own pants and boxers off, so there was no undressing to do with him. Just… there he was in all his nakedness. Except for the tie, of course. With a swift intake of breath, Dean moved between Castiel’s legs, grabbed him by the tie, and pulled him in for an impassioned kiss, with his other hand reaching for and stroking Cas. Dean didn’t know it, but for Castiel to feel his excited, ardent touch was enough to make him almost blow-out the entire city’s electrical circuit. In fact, the yellowed lot lights flickered and hummed, but did not burst.
“Hah, more than good… You?”
“Uh, what?” Dean was so lost in the things he was feeling that when Cas spoke it was like he was being pulled out of a dream.
Finally, Dean went to kiss Cas again, which immediately perked them both up.
Then, finally, Dean felt Castiel’s on him for real. And of course, a hand is a hand, is a hand… but this was Castiel’s hand on him. And that was different. It was better. And his dick was definitely, unquestionably, hard now. Whatever butterflies had been swarming before had now flown away.
They had very different styles of undressing each other. Dean sped through the buttons then pulled the dress shirt over and down Castiel’s shoulders and arms, and then quickly pulled the undershirt off Cas as well, as if the whole procedure were a race to get each other undressed as quickly as possible. Castiel’s method was quite the opposite. He placed his hands on Dean’s hips while they kissed and slowly moved them up his sides, lifting the shirt while still keeping his palms to Dean’s skin. The feeling of the angel’s hands slowly pressing and moving up his sides caused impatient electricity to spark throughout Dean’s body. Dean realized he had never been touched so gently and deliberately. Before pulling the shirt off completely, Castiel pulled out of their kisses.
“Oh, yeah, uh, that’s a good question.” Dean actually wasn’t sure how to answer him. The next logical step was… the backdoor. And regardless of whether he was taking it or giving it, Dean didn’t really want his first time doing that to be in the backseat of Baby, all cramped and awkward, and with no lube in sight.
And there he was, Dean Winchester, passionately kissing a man, in daylight, where no darkness or closed doors could hide it. And it was fine. Everything was fine. Everything was great, even. Because next time… wait, would there be a next time? Could he ever get the nerve again? Was this just a one off thing when somehow all logic had evaporated from his brain?
“Better than nothing.” Cas chuckled. He laid in a way that he was propped up on one elbow so he could still watch Dean as he did whatever. Popping open the Vaseline, Dean scooped out a large glob on his fingers, he started to play with Cas’s asshole. He was slow and gentle until that first breach, to which Cas responded with a satisfied groan that was maybe too loud for this public tryst. But no one rushed to break into the office, so Cas let another desperate moan escape from deep within him. God, he missed being played with. Satisfied that things were feeling good for Cas, Dean finger fucked him with more insistence, quickly chancing another finger, and then a third. Cas’s dick slapped against his own stomach as his body rocked from the movement. Using his other hand, Cas played with himself.
The shift in energy surged through Cas, and he let himself succumb to the pleasure. His embarrassment from earlier didn’t exist. The anxiety of being caught wasn’t a worry. All he knew was Dean’s hot thick cock pounding into him. This gorgeous, willing, almost stranger, fucking him within an inch of his life. How they didn’t break the bed, Cas didn’t know. Sweat flung off Dean and fell onto Cas, who licked the salty drops from his lips.
For what seemed like a minute that lasted forever, both Dean and Cas stared at their held hands. Castiel broke the silence first as he quickly ejected and put the tape back in, the first song playing once more…
Steeling himself with determination, Cas leaned back and then pushed himself forward, committing to the dive. But something went wrong. Maybe it was his footing, maybe it was the angle he was at when he buunced, regardless, Cas entered the water all wrong and could feel himself in pain, disoriented, and suddenly gasping for breath, choking on the burning chlorinated water. Things went fuzzy for long enough that when things became clear again, he knew he wasn’t in the pool anymore.
The bed was fairly narrow and likely could not support the two of them, so Cas lay down sort of crossways, with his ass still close to the edge of the bed where Dean stood. Dean turned back to one of the cabinets, rummaged around until he turned back with a bottle of Vaseline. He cocked an eyebrow at Cas,
Dean’s heart sank. “Oh yeah, no of course-”
You got the peaches, I got the cream
Instructing Cas, Dean said, “Lay back, sideways, yeah like that.”
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It is a game for youth
“Age?”
Now Dean had gotten many, many, MANY blowjobs. Really great, amazing blowjobs. But again, this one was different. Dean had no idea how exactly, but it was clear that Cas knew how to suck dick. Dean was panting, gasping, moaning, biting his lip, grasping at the seat cushions, while Cas sucked, licked, kissed, and teased his cock AND balls… damn, this feels fucking fantastic. When his eyes weren’t rolling to the back of his head, Dean watched Cas, occasionally running his hands through the angel’s hair, tugging and pulling when he hit a good spot. Seeing the angel sucking him off sent all sorts of feelings through him, from some kind of enjoyable embarrassment, to eager pleasure. Then, caught between trying not to blow his load and wanting to explore more, he said to Cas, “Cas, Cas stop for a second, I want to try on you.”
“Huh, eager little slut, aren’t you?”
Dean took a moment to think and Castiel waited patiently for him to answer, the yellow light from the warehouse lot spilled over onto their half naked bodies.
'Cause I'm hot (hot), say what, sticky sweet
Castiel rearranged himself so he was sitting over Dean more-so than beside him and as he kissed him again, he used his free hand to caress Dean’s shoulder’s, chest, stomach, feeling his warm muscled body respond to his gentle but purposeful touches. Goosebumps erupted in the path that Castiel’s hands travelled and Dean’s breath hitched and sighed with each touch. Then Cas moved his kisses away from Dean’s lips and to his neck, his collar bone, shoulders, chest. But when Cas began to kiss down his chest and to Dean’s stomach, that’s when the butterflies in Dean really started to flutter and he suddenly wondered if he could go further.
And throw away the oars, forever
From my head (head), my head, to my feet
You, you make loving fun
-Foreigner “I Want to Know What Love Is”
Castiel did not hesitate to follow his order to kiss him and Dean leaned into their kiss once more with great insistence. Dean moved his arm to wrap around Cas’s side and they pressed close to each other. Feeling the angel’s body under his hand, really feeling it even though Cas still wore his shirt, was an experience. Dean realized that he had been close to Castiel so many times, yet never felt close to him.
“What?” Castiel asked, tilting his head curiously.
“Uh…” Castiel’s gaze went from Dean’s hand, to Dean’s groin – which seemed to have a bulge? – and then up to his face. The other man’s expression was suddenly playful, his head cocked and lips in a smile, and he winked at him again.
“Cas, love me.”
“O-okay.” Dean replied, holding it back for as long as he could before a shivering, shaking, explosive orgasm let loose from his body. Dean tried to take in all parts of the moment as well as he could – to see himself cum, to see Cas explode right after, to see the expression on Cas’s face and the way his body buckled, their cum spewing all over Dean’s stomach and chest, and Castiel’s poor tie.
“Well, kiss me already.”
“Christ Cas, you feel so good.” This was the first time while they had been exploring each other that Dean explicitly said to Cas how he was feeling. The first time he really admitted out loud how he felt. This exclamation had a weight to it that Cas understood.
“Dean, breathe.” The angel commanded as they made eye contact. Castiel knew Dean was running on adrenaline, and he wanted him to be able to slow down and enjoy himself, instead of power through like a hormone wired teenager.
Seemingly spurred on by the sight of Cas touching himself, Dean did the same, at least until he blurted out to Cas, “I need to fuck you before I cum.”
Dean took the deep breath that he didn’t know he needed. Blood pounded in his ears as his heart raced, his body so warm from desire and his head spinning. Yes, he needed to breathe. But a part of him was afraid what would happen if he stopped thinking and acting on the primal instincts within him, because to Dean just wanting to fuck would be at least partly acceptable, but if there was feeling attached… love attached… then it would somehow be worse. So part of his logical brain was still trying to tell him to stop, that this was wrong. That wanting Cas, deeply, intimately, was wrong. And he didn’t want to give in to that voice anymore. But because Castiel told him so, he breathed.
“Dean?” His tone was questioning – of course – but the question was not ‘why were we holding hands?’ but instead, ‘is this what you want, too?’.
“Before we raise suspicion.”
“Well.” Dean said simply, still breathless, eyes shining, skin flushed. Cas imagined he looked much the same.
“Say it.” Dean said, hunger deepening his voice into a primal growl.
Dean settled back into the seat of the impala as Castiel ventured lower and lower with his kisses. Dean reminded himself to breathe, and to enjoy it – because he was enjoying it despite all his hesitations. Castiel asked him if he trusted him, and Dean did trust him, with everything.
But I'm beginning to wonder why
I've been this way before
As they grinded and jerked against each other, Dean began to feel like he was definitely getting close to the finish line.
“Yeah, no more dramatics, I got it… This was, uh, fun.” He had never been great at post-fuck talk. Then again, he’d never fucked someone in the first aid office of a public pool, so he didn’t really have a script to draw from in this scenario.
“Yes.” Dean replied. Cas nodded, using some spit to lube them up, and began working on their cocks at the same time.
-Whitesnake “Is This Love”
“Do you want to stop?”
Before taking him all in, Castiel peppered little kisses over Dean’s trimmed bush, slowly, sweetly, from the base of his shaft to the top. That sensation alone made Dean huff and puff, and the anticipation zinged throughout him. While he kissed him, Castiel thought about how long he had wanted these things to happen. How long he had yearned for Dean to know his true feelings. To finally be able to kiss him, to touch him, to love him… And to see that Dean clearly wanted the same things. It took every fibre of will to not take him then. But he didn’t want to frighten Dean, he wanted Dean to enjoy it, and love it. And Castiel wanted to show him gentleness and care, things he knew Dean did not have a lot of. So Cas licked his lips, looked Dean in the eyes with a playful gaze, and then took him in his mouth.
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
“Of course I am.” Dean winked. “That’s why we’re here aren’t we?”
Some instinct told Dean to shut his eyes and just feel, but he wanted to see the moment that Cas would take him into his mouth. Without admitting it to anyone, he too had watched a lot of gay porn, secretly between the copious amounts of hentai and big titties. And that moment, the moment when the guy taking it would first feel the other guy either with his mouth or… from behind. That moment always seemed like pure bliss. So Dean wanted to see it as well as feel it.
Cas nodded, “Me too. I think when you cum, I will too.”
“Cas, I’m… I’m close.” He huffed.
“This work for you?”
I don't know if I can face it again
Dean laughed, “I think we should get up before we get melded to each other and have to be pried apart with a crow bar.” Cas lifted his head and gave a confused look to Dean.
They made out eagerly, the blood rushing through their bodies pushed out the chill from the air conditioner. Cas gasped around Dean’s flicking tongue, and his head spun, happy he had wound up in this situation, but still in disbelief. Dean pulled them tighter together and their hard cocks pressed and shifted against each other through the damp fabric of their swim trunks.
“Do you trust me?”
Pink blush erupted across Castiel’s face and for a moment he was flustered and could hardly undo Dean’s pants. “You are… cute as well.”
“Take it off, Dean.”
Cas’s own dick twitched at the demand and he eagerly kneeled down in front of Dean’s crotch. Even through the chlorine, he could smell the heat of Dean’s desire. Taking his hard cock in his hands, Cas’s spent a moment jerking him off, using his other to play with his balls. Then, feeling saucy and brave in the moment, Cas took his balls in his mouth, alternating sucking them gently, then a little more firmly. Clearly Dean enjoyed this because when Cas looked up, Dean’s eyes were closed and his hands clutched blindly at the cabinet handles for support. Without warning, Cas moved from his balls to his dick, eliciting a deep groan from Dean, whose eyes snapped open and head turned down so he could look Cas in the eyes. It was Cas’s turn to wink as he took Dean’s whole length into his throat and paused, waiting for the satisfying gag to force him away. Dribbling with drool, Cas did this again, and again, and again. He was very good at deep throating, especially when he was really horny. Finally, Dean’s knees buckled and he slid down the wall.
Don't need a whore
Voice raspy, Cas replied, “Uh, yes, sounds good.” Dean nodded and proceeded his inspection, asking him a few questions, taking his blood-pressure, using one of those knee hammers to check reflexes, and a little flashlight to check his focus. Dean was quiet the whole time, focused on his duties, with just a few little grunts of what seemed to be satisfaction. Trying to be a good patient and still internally reeling from embarrassment, Castiel also remained quiet during his, unintentionally, intimate inspection. He had daydreamed about being close to Dean, but it hadn’t been like this.
Cas nodded, participating a raspy “sure thing” to the conversation. Dean turned to the cabinet that was just a few feet away and bend over to rifle through the drawer. Was it just Cas’s imagination, or was he bending his back so his ass was pushed up more dramatically than normal? Finding the right form, Dean leaned over the desk to the right, in such a way that again his rear end was in full view. His wet red shorts stopped only an inch or two away from the bottom of his ass cheeks, which threatened to pop out. Castiel gulped so loudly he wondered how Dean could not hear. Cas imagined reaching out and giving that ass a hard spank.
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you sight
Cas thought about it for a moment, brain having to imagine the mechanics (though likely he had seen similar things while on his own porn adventures), and then replied, “Yes, that does sound hot. You lay down, I’ll be on top.”
Starting similar to how Cas had, Dean stroked him and played with his balls before moving his mouth to him. It had been a little while since Cas had been with anyone, and the feeling of this hunky lifeguard’s mouth on his eager hard-on made him melt into the bed. His eyes rolled and his breath huffed. Dean was very skilled with his mouth and it took every ounce of control to not blow his load.
“What do we do now?” Cas asks.
After it was all out, Dr. Novak stitched up the cuts that needed it before rubbing an ointment on Dean’s ass and applying bandages where needed.
“Okay, Dean you might feel a small pinch and burn as I inject this, but that’s completely normal,” Jess warned as she drew up the lidocaine. Dean nodded and then Jess injected him in several areas of his butt.
He walked over to his closed office door and took a deep breath, letting it out as he opened the door.
Dean shakes his head but he can’t speak. If he does, he’s going to fall apart again. “I..I can’t talk about it, Sam. Not right now.” Dean knows Sam is looking at him, wanting him to speak about it. But Dean can’t. “I’ll fall apart if I do,” Dean adds, and he feels Sam look away. Dean thinks he gets it.
Cleaned up as well as he can be from old take out napkins, Dean keeps driving pulling up across from where Sam and Jack stand.
When the doctor left the room Dean turned to look at Sam again. “This is it, Sam. You are not allowed in my kitchen again. Every damn time you come back there something like this happens!”
“Okay, I can work with five. I’ll make it so it serves about 360 so you guys shouldn’t run out of cake at the wedding,” he said, making a rough sketch of the five layers before labeling next to the tiers the size they would be. “Anything else?”
: You’re impossible, you know that?
“Thanks,” Dean said with a smile as he put down the next slice. “Alright, this cake is just a simple vanilla cake with a raspberry filling along with the same Italian meringue buttercream.”
Dean stares at Sam, unable to believe he was defending Cas, after everything. After Cas leaving again. Leaving
Dr. Novak raised an eyebrow, a small smile on his face, “well you’re the first patient I will ever believe actually fell on an object. Let me take a look.”
“Oh yes, I already got one, I hope you don’t mind. It’s just the first letters of both our names, an M and an N.”
“That’s correct,” Anna said, nodding.
“Hello, I’m Anna, I’m here for the cake tasting, we made an appointment?” She said, holding out her hand to shake Dean’s with a small smile, “and this is - “
“Wait, what?” Dean asked.
Dean pulled up to the curb in front of Cas’ condo and turned off the Impala. He had no idea what he was even going to say. It didn’t matter, he would make it up as he went. Cas had to know.
“Why didn’t he bring back Cas?” Dean asks Sam as they drive back to the bunker.
“Sorry,” Sam said with shrug, not looking at all sorry. “I’m worried about you. And Jess is worried about Cas. She said in all the time she’s worked with him he’s never missed a single day and now he’s missed several days. It’s not like him.”
Once the doors were locked, Dean leaned against his counters. Coffee was not a date. It was just coffee, and that clearly was not a date when Cas was getting married. People could get coffee, that was a thing that happened.
Dean wrinkles his nose at the name. “I’m gonna call you Cas,” Dean decides with a nod. Cas just shrugs, and clutches his blanket closer. Dean studies Cas for a moment before nodding again. “We’re gonna be best friends,” Dean tells Cas. Cas only nods. If it wasn’t for him telling his name Dean would have thought he was mute.
: He said he regretted everything, Anna. I love him and I am nothing but a fucking mistake to him.
Deciding to not to give them any ammunition, Castiel shrugs and wryly says, “I have no idea what you mean.”
“Maybe we should go to your room,” Cas gasps out after one particularly echoing moan. He’s probably right – the kitchen isn’t that far from the bedrooms, within earshot if they’re not careful enough. Dean’s never been that keen on sharing, and god forbid Sam or Jack stroll in, but frankly that possessive flame in him hasn’t totally extinguished yet.
“We didn’t get to talk much, busy with the job and other, more pleasant things.” Dean doesn’t miss the completely unnecessary wink, and it’s honestly a miracle he doesn’t launch out of his seat and across the table. It’s a close thing, though.
He goes to depart a second time, and Dean snags his wrist without thinking. He has to look away, still horribly uneasy but at a minimum needing Cas to know how much Dean cannot lose him anymore. Even if he can’t bring himself to say all the other things.
He tries to remember why he ever thought doing this with Cas would be the wrong move because he’s kissed a lot of people and it’s never been like
“Cas,” he says, voice deep and dangerous to his own ears.
He’s a little nervous to look back up but does, knowing he can’t, won’t avoid it. Through the dark he can’t really read Cas’s expression beyond the dazed look in his eyes. Dean can relate, totally off kilter and blissfully buzzing.
While he might be terribly out of practice, he tries to make up for it tenfold with enthusiasm. He probably has next to no finesse, but Cas doesn’t seem to care at all, judging by the obscene sounds he continues to let out. Each one vibrates through Dean, makes him go faster, deep as he can, doesn’t even flinch when he gags a little. This is one of his many fantasies come to life, and he feels like he’s high.
Cas goes very still, unsure of how to respond. He smells the alcohol on Dean’s breath, but Cas knows the amount he’s had and it isn’t all that much, especially in heaven. In theory Dean’s decision-making skills aren’t out of control. He must be genuine, certainly sounds it.
Actually, if he’s going to be real honest with himself, what he really wants to do is go find Cas and stake his fucking claim.
When Dean speaks again, his voice has gone much lower, softer. “Dance with me,” he says, unhesitating, smiling against Cas’s skin.
Dean can’t bring himself to ask and deflects instead. “Were you gonna?”
“Yeah, it was so long ago,” he laughs cheerfully, like he isn’t talking about one of the bleakest weights Dean still struggles to carry to this day. “I knew you seemed familiar. You look a bit more beat down here, no offense, but I could never forget those pretty blue eyes of yours.”
Dean can’t decide between hurling, hiding under his blankets, or searching out the nearest bad thing to kill. Like his pretentious counterpart, for instance.
“You kissed me,” Cas states slowly. His words waver sightly in question, and Dean gives him what he hopes is a soothing smile.
“No one else gets to do this with you, Cas,” he says between the edge of command and pleading. Cas’s cock brushes against his mouth, leaves a hot trail of precome on his cheek, and Dean wraps his hand around Cas and starts jerking him with intent. “I want you to myself.”
The Roadhouse erupts.
“Yes,” Cas gasps, nodding wildly and thrusting into Dean’s grip. His fingers pull at Dean’s hair tighter, almost painful in the best way. “Yes, yes, I-I… I’m yours, Dean,
Cas like a freaking snack he’s about to double dip.
Instead, Cas mumbles, “I’m sorry I was not able to save you before you went to Hell.”
Dean’s ferocity drips down like wax as the kiss quickly turns tender, so damn sweet. He presses in even tighter, wrapping his other arm around Cas, relishing the warmth that spreads through him. Cas twists his fingers into Dean’s shirt and kisses him back so nicely, tasting of honey, and Dean could honestly cry.
Cas is
He can’t believe this.
From the other end of The Roadhouse, Castiel can tell that Dean has definitely toed over the tipsy line. His eyes shine brighter, his smile stretched wide and unrestrained. He ruffles Kevin’s hair more than once as they play darts against Sam and Ash, much to the boy’s amused exasperation. Dean’s voice grows louder, livelier, especially as it becomes clear they might win against all odds.
Douchebag Dean appears completely oblivious to the mounting, definitely unsexy tension in the room. “I didn’t know you were an angel. Wow.” He bites his lip, totally unsubtle, and Dean imagines knocking his teeth right out.
Cas surges against him, recapturing him into a kiss that quickly turns searing. Dean runs his hands down Cas’s chest slowly, and they both groan out loud as Cas rocks his hips back into Dean’s. Cas is
Cas evidently doesn’t know how to respond, his eyes flicking to Dean for the quickest moment. Dean can barely meet them. He has absolutely no idea what Cas can read on his expression, but his face feels like it’s on fire.
Cas gives him a shaky smile back and then helps Dean back onto his unsteady feet. Cas rubs his thumb under Dean’s bottom lip, who remembers with a flush that he still has come smeared on his face. Cas stares at the sight almost appreciatively and after a moment of thick silence, he leans forward and licks a bit off.
Dean moans around Cas at the relief, and Cas chokes on his breath. “Dean,” he croaks out, voice absolutely wrecked like he’s the one who’s been giving head. “Dean, I’m— I don’t, I –”
“Well, he’s not wrong,” Dean says, sincere as can be, and then he pulls Cas back in.
“Why… now?” Cas asks, breathy as Dean kisses and tastes his way down Cas’s throat. It’s a fair question but definitely not one he’s particularly eager to answer, so he tries to distract Cas by sucking a bruise into his pulse point. Even though Cas gives him a delicious moan, writhing in his grip, he still manages, “Because of the other Dean propositioning me?”
Between a trip to Hell, a soul revival, and a disturbing brush with almost death, the latter of which Dean absolutely does not want to think about, he could really use a break. A day to recover. He’d even take twelve hours of uninterrupted quiet, just for a little goddamn peace of mind.
And now that version of himself is gazing at
“It’s very lovely,” Cas manages, still addressing the girls as he’s unable to move at all. He wonders if he’s blushing from the outrageous enjoyment on their faces, but he tries to remain at least a little stoic for Dean’s sake. “I don’t recognize it.”
Dean releases him a little so Cas can turn in his chair. Dean doesn’t move any further, though, stays hovered over him and closer than they’ve ever been in public. He snags Cas’s wrist from where it’s laid on top of the table and he squeezes pointedly.
Despite facing god and the devil and everything in between, Dean will always be the one who overwhelms him like none other.
From anyone else that would maybe sound like a line, but Dean knows when Cas is trying (and usually failing) at being flirty, and that ain’t it. The other version obviously doesn’t notice, flashing a predatory grin at Cas. “Just like you. You saved me from interdimensional purgatory. Thanks for that, by the way.”
“You sure, Cas?” Dean asks as he begins popping the buttons of Cas’s shirt open from the bottom, and Cas’s eyes go wider, somehow. “You weren’t exactly running away. You must’ve wondered what this was like.”
Cas quirks an eyebrow at him. “After I check on Jack, I’m going to continue searching for signs of Amara. Did you need me to do something?”
He looks completely untroubled, happy in every way, and it’s all Cas has ever wanted to see in his human. He built Dean this heaven for the very purpose.
Cas, the petulant bastard, tightens his eyes. “Yes, Dean,” he concedes with the slightest hint of exasperation, as though Dean is overreacting, which he definitely is not.
Dean guides them through the tables, passing some all too knowing expressions that Cas resolutely does not acknowledge, to an open space near the jukebox. Even though he’s had a human form for some time now, Cas still isn’t used to how his heartbeat thrums loud in his ears alongside the bass. He’s sure Dean can feel the slight tremble under his skin.
“I… No.” Cas hesitates just a second too long, swallowing. “No,” he repeats firmer, but a flare of jealousy has already ricocheted up Dean’s spine.
Dean chokes on his drink. Cas tilts his head in his painfully endearing way, searching the other version with his mystified squint. Dean grinds his teeth, barely refraining from telling him to knock it off. That would just be irrational. Right.
Dean stays silent, which the dumb fuck mistakenly takes as a victory. The wrong Dean turns back to Cas, actually putting his hand on Cas’s waist, and Dean – well.
“Now that you’ve seen something, you can fuck right off,” Dean tells him, practically growling.
It’s not, though. He’s fucking terrified, as always, but he wants more. He can admit that to himself now. He’s been trying to figure out what to do before they run out of time, all without taking the wrong step. Cas matters so damn much to him, and Dean really doesn’t want to mess anything up by rushing.
Quietly Dean croons along with a couple of the lines, only for him to hear, his voice like velvet. Cas has always secretly loved hearing him sing,  and the adoring words sink into him like afternoon sunlight.
“Earthlings to the angel,” Charlie says to his left, waving her hand briefly in front of his face. He startles and turns back to the table, trying to appear properly apologetic, because he’d definitely tuned out of the girls’ conversation about… something. Charlie, Mary, and Jo aren’t bothered though, instead smirking in a way that makes him flush a little.
Dean lightly kisses the base of Cas’s flushed red cock and starts working his way up. Cas tastes both clean and musky, intoxicating, and his knees full on shake when Dean finally wraps his lips fully around him. The small burst of precome that explodes on his tongue is so hot, delectable, igniting him. He’s hard as hell in his own pajamas but barely pays any mind, in that moment wanting to focus only on Cas, wanting to make him feel so good.
, I’m yours.”
He’s not, really, but Dean wants him to be.
Eventually Dean drops his hand, only to gather Cas all the way into him, the only inches left between them at their faces. His exhale washes over Cas’s mouth when he murmurs, “I have always wanted to do this with you.”
Cas tenses for the briefest of heart stopping seconds before melting beautifully into Dean, into the kiss completely.
“I’ll help you change them tomorrow,” Cas says back, appearing proper chastised for a second, but then he starts chuckling too. Dean loves hearing him laugh, infrequently as it happens. He loves being the one to make Cas laugh, make him smile, bring him any kind of joy. He loves standing here in their home, the gap between them finally closed. He loves – well, everything, because honestly, he just loves Cas.
Alternate world Dean missed the fuck out, but he doesn’t get a do over. This is right. These pretty blue eyes belong to him.
Cas looks so damn sad, though, eyes still cast down. He sighs, scratching at the stitching of his pants. “You seemed aggravated after he said he never went. That I saved him from the demon.”
He hopes Cas sees that in him because he still just… can’t. Not yet, not when they could be obliterated out of existence tomorrow. Not when they still don’t have control of their future. Not when the thought of losing Cas after only now getting him rips into Dean like a violent blackhole. He will, he swears, when there’s a forever for him to promise.
“Hey,” Dean half rumbles, half yells in his ear, pressing his face right into Cas’s hair. The warmth of Dean sends a tremor down his frame, even with a chair between them. “I put this song on.”
“That wasn’t… I mean, yeah, I could’ve passed on the torture,” Dean says carefully, other rebuttals stuck in his mouth, like admitting he was seething with possessiveness and trying not to humiliate himself.  “But I’m not, like, disappointed in you for what you couldn’t control at the time. It wasn’t your fault.”
And dancing to a slow, sultry song in front of almost all of their friends and family is a big step.
Stalking in silently, tensed, he finds slimeball Dean shirtless, wearing only Dean’s own plaid pajama pants, which are absolutely getting burned in the morning. He has an uneasy looking Cas practically backed into the counter, leaning in far too close. Dean can read the intention all over himself.
Somewhere in the back of his mind he deliberates a peak at their audience, not necessarily nervous of their reaction but struck at the disbelief. He’d fully resigned himself long ago that things like this could never, would never happen, and now here it is, displayed for everyone to witness too.
“Come back to bed with me,” he repeats from earlier, and this time Cas nods and follows without hesitation.
“You were worth it, too,” Cas says quietly, the familiar tension between them starting to crackle again, and Dean admittedly fucking swoons.
Not that he didn’t want to. That just wasn't what they did, not in this forsaken world.
Then Purgatory happened, and the part of Dean that he tried to keep tucked away broke out and came at him with a baseball bat. It sure as hell knocked some sense into him regarding the scope of his feelings for Cas, which are more extensive than ever, to say the least. The kind of extensive that makes him want to confess,
Cas’s dick is pure velvet in his hand, thick and hot as Dean starts pumping slowly, and Cas lets out a stuttering cry, much too loud. Dean grins, rubbing his thumb over the tip, slick from clearly being on edge already. Cas reacts exquisitely, shuddering against him, throbbing in his grip. Dean’s honestly never been more turned on in his pitiful life.
Dean doesn’t mean to laugh, but the stupid giddy relief in him just bubbles up because finally,
“Hello, Dean,” he says softly, soothing Dean’s nerves over like a cool breeze.
Dean pauses, knowing he’s blushing, stays tucked into Cas’s neck to hide his embarrassment. “No. Yes. No,” he mumbles. The douchebag was undeniably the catalyst, but Cas has to know this has been building and compounding between them for a dozen years, bound to burst eventually. Surely he knows that.
“Awesome, I’ve always wanted to do this,” Dean says, barely registering his honesty, and sinks to his knees.
Dean forces a laugh and hates how his cheeks go hot. He sits down across from Cas at the edge of his bed. “You could say that. I swear this isn’t just my shitty self-esteem talking, but I really hate myself. And my brother. Silver spooned assholes,” he says, shaking his head, hoping to clear it all the way. “I’m good though.”
, deliciously pressed against Dean’s own answering arousal, and any blood lingering in Dean’s head instantly rushes south with a heavy swoop. He meets the next thrust with his own and is instantly lost.
Evidently Dean doesn’t give up in any universe, at least not when it comes to Cas. “I call bullshit,” the other Dean says with a finger point that Dean wants to break in half. “I watched you two earlier. I didn’t see a damn thing, and I would know, if you recall.”
Dean and Kevin win with a final, particularly lucky bullseye by Kevin that Cas may or may not influence just a tiny, tiny bit. Dean whoops, throwing his arms up in the air, and rubs the victory in his brother’s face with a total lack of sportsmanship and a shit eating grin. Cas can’t hear what Sam says in return, but he’s pretty sure he’s complaining better-naturedly back.
Awesome. Just fantastic.
Cas supposes he’s the one hesitating because he’s admittedly terrified of messing up a single step when it comes to Dean.
Dean turns to face him and leaves almost no space between their bodies. Castiel tries not to immediately sway into him. The grip on his wrist slides into his hand, their fingers interlacing and raising to their chests. Dean’s other arm wraps snuggly around his waist, palm soothingly warm in the middle of Cas’s back.
Dean looks up at him slowly. Cas’s eyes are blown open and bright, his cheeks dusted pink. Dean wants to make him look like this forever. “No?” he asks carefully, more teasing than actually agitated, and Cas squirms beneath him all the same. “Didn’t even think about it?”
, but now that he’s seen the cards in play, he’s ready to deal, ready to win. He won’t fail, not when he can see the prize.
Now that they’re alone, the nerves kick back in, but they don’t seem as massive or as debilitating as before. Being this close feels too good. He can’t bring himself to put any distance between them, still holding onto Cas by the back of his head. Cas doesn’t let go either, clutching Dean’s shirt like a lifeline.
“Oh my god, I just realized how I know you,” alternate world Dean says, staring at Cas across the map table with a devious grin. Dean immediately narrows his eyes from behind his tumbler. “Cas stands for Castiel, right? You saved me from Hell!”
In an outraged burst, Dean marches to his door, not sure exactly what he’s about to do but intent on ending the other Dean’s offensive charade at the very least. He rips the hinges open and – instantly deflates.
“Don’t worry,” he says, giving Cas a stunning grin. “I’ll lead the way.”
“Fucking finally!” is the first coherent shout Cas can make out through the literal cheers, the outburst coming from Sam, of course. Cas finally turns to face the crowd and finds him with his arms sky high, a huge grin blessedly pasted on his face. “Now I know we’ve really died and gone to heaven, guys! Sorry to say!”
“I don’t,” Dean blurts out before he realizes what he’s about to say. A low hum starts echoing in his ears. “We, uh. If you’d done that, we probably wouldn’t know each other. Like this. And honestly, having you in my life was… well, worth the trade off.”
Dean flies right off the handle and doesn’t even care.
After their fight, Dean had been almost certain Cas was never coming back. He knows now that he deserved it, but watching Cas walk out left an ache deep in his bones that settled and throbbed like an infected wound in the weeks that followed. No amount of alcohol could dull it. He put on a good show, he thinks, but each passing day had ate at him more than the last.
It’s been a shit day.
“It’s my kitchen,” Dean bites back and then gives Cas a pointed stare. He’s not even thinking at this point, rage boiling. He says the first thing that comes to mind. “Are you coming back to bed?”
That’s at least truthful, the memory still making him woozy at the edges. The last time Cas actually died fractured Dean into pieces and nearly killed him. Seeing his angel splayed out lifeless again, knowing he was traipsing through a darkness that nearly kept him once, was horrifying to discover.
The last strings of guitar taper off into brief, total silence, and then –
All three women simultaneously roll their eyes, which he finds more endearing than irritating, and they thankfully don’t expand on the topic. They probably just don’t want to face Dean’s ire if he found them discussing their proclivities, and Cas still isn’t sure what he’s allowed to say, so he’d rather just keep quiet all together.
he got to have a weekend sex rendezvous with Cas.
Not suspicious at all.
The other Dean shakes his head though, looking puzzled. “From the… pit? No, of course not,” he says dismissively. Dean’s eyes about bulge out of his head when he continues, “We hunted a demon together who wanted to collect on some ridiculous crossroads mix up. Totally swooped in and saved my ass. And, heh – we had some fun for a couple days after.”
“Uh...right. Um it was nice to see you Cas, but I’m going to get going, have to open the farmer’s market tomorrow morning.” Dean said rubbing at the back of his neck. If these two could stop pointing out his crush that would be awesome.
,” Cas whimpers, pulling him in for another kiss.  Several long kisses later, Dean pulls away again.
“Yes, but only because Toni was busy wrapping up everything with her life and business in London.” Anna stated like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“I’m so sorry, Dean. I didn’t think Anna would come while I was out at lunch with Jess. I thought I had another hour or two,” he said, slightly out of breath.
Dean shrugged and put the lei on and stood in line with everyone else.
Dean thought before that his heart was broken but at the moment it felt like his heart had shattered all over again. They were still getting married. “I understand if you want to switch bakers, I can suggest some other bakeries --”
“Sounds perfect. Do you have a bathroom here?” Anna responded, rising when Dean pointed toward the rear of the store. “I’ll be back in a moment.”
Turning down the  street the GPS took him to, Dean could see Cas’ car in the driveway. He was home. Dean could do this. He could fix all of this.
“Meg. Dean, how did you like the show?” Cas asked, coming to stand next to Dean.
: Scandalous, Dean. Alright, I’ll make sure you are properly taken care of them. See you then!
Dean pulls Cas down, laying down with him to kiss again over and over.
He was finishing up when he heard the bakery door open. “Welcome to Sweet Surprise, how can I....” Dean started to say as he looked up, trailing off once he saw Dr. Novak. They stared at each other for a long moment before Dean realized that the redhead next to Dr. Novak was glancing between the two of them. Dean cleared his throat. “Uh, sorry. How can I help you guys?”
“No,” Dean muttered going into the back.
: Cas.
“I promised Cas I wouldn’t get involved in this. I’m pissed at you for hurting my baby brother, but I will do my best to keep my promise to him.” She stated, reaching down to grab her purse.
Dean watched as Cas marched up to the stage, taking the hand of the stagehand to walk up the stairs in his six inch heels. Cas turned and threw off his cape revealing his outfit. Holy shit. Cas looked so hot in the outfit, it wasn’t even fair how hot he looked. He was wearing a black corset and fishnet stockings revealing his hip bones and thick thighs.
Now Dean is seven and he’s the best in his class. Dean even gets to be a leader for the smaller children. He’s the best leaper and does the best chasse for their group. Dean loves ballet even though he knows his dad doesn’t think it’s the right thing for him to do since he’s a boy. But it was okay cause his mom just shushed his dad up with a kiss and now Dean is able to keep doing ballet.
Dean’s current issue was the glass stuck in his asscheek. That was entirely Sam’s fault. He always got in the way—that was the reason Sam had been banned from being in the kitchen of Dean’s bakery. If it wasn’t for Sam’s gargantuan frame, Dean wouldn’t currently be on a stretcher in the ER with glass in his asscheeks.
“I don’t want to see you, Dean,” Cas said, cutting Dean off. “I
“Uh, y-yeah,” Dean stuttered, pulling his hand away. What was he twelve? “Coffee sounds great.”
“Sam. I’m not in the mood to talk about this. I just want to move on from all of this,” Dean said grabbing an apron from the rack next to the sink.
Dean leaned his head against the door, closing his eyes as he felt the tears fall. “I love you,” he whispered to the closed door, knowing there was no chance Cas would hear him. He had fucked everything up and there was no way to come back from this.
: Rude.
“No!” Dean shouts, pulling Cas back down. “I love you, Cas. I should have told you, you can have what you want. You can have me.”
: Hey, you have a seat saved for you in the front row. See you in there!
“Hi, I’m Dean,” Dean finally greets the other boy one day. The boy tilts his head and shakes Dean’s outstretched hand.
“Oh. Uh, okay. Could you have her just take a seat in my office? Let her know I’ll be there in just a second.” Dean said, watching as Hannah nodded and went back up front. Okay, Anna definitely knew about him and Cas then. She was probably here to kick his ass, or tell him she didn’t need the cake anymore. He deserved this.
Dean smiled as he wiped down the counter of his bakery, things had been going so much smoother now that Sam had agreed to actually stay in the front of the house. Also, hiring a new person who wasn’t a giant moose had been a lot of help. He was glad that his ass hasn’t seemed to scar either - that would have been a pain to explain to any men he hooked up with.
Cas moved so gracefully even in the giant heels, mouthing the words to the song. The song ended and they continued to the next scene. Dean leaned forward in his chair, his eyes glued to Cas. Dean tried to take everything in, but mostly he paid attention to Cas.
: yea sounds like fun
Okay, that wasn’t completely true. When Dean woke up that morning with a terrible hangover, that part wasn’t Sam’s fault. That was all Dean. A little bit Benny. Mostly Benny.  Although if he was being totally honest, the alcohol was kinda Dean’s idea... but that’s getting off topic.
Cas shakes his head with a smile. “No, I’m yours for as long as you want me, Dean.”
There was a small knock before a man with unkempt brown hair entered the room. “Mr. Winchester, I’m Dr. Novak. I understand you have an issue with embedded glass?”
Almost immediately, Dean feels like he’s going to start crying again, but he stuffs it down, clearing his throat. “He saved me. Billie was coming after us...and he summoned the Empty. It took out Billie...and it took Cas too. He’s gone.”
“Dean, where’s Cas?” Jack asks, staring at the Impala as if any second now Cas will climb out of the passenger side.
to take care of the front of the house stuff and stay out of my kitchen!” Dean said glaring at Sam.
: uhh years ago but i left halfway through
Dean shook his head, sitting up. “It’s fine, man. It wasn’t... Cas is Anna’s brother.”
“You’re Dean, right?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. Dean nodded. “Cool. I’m Meg, Castiel’s best friend. So, you better fucking behave.” Dean looked down ashamed. Yup she had seen the boner he had gotten and she didn’t want him messing up Anna and Cas’ relationship.
“Yeah, sure, um I take my lunch generally around 12:30 but if it’s slammed obviously I can’t go,” Dean said, as Cas nodded.
: I’m sorry.
“Perfect! Now Anna, did you have a style or design in mind for the cake?” Dean asked getting up and grabbing his sketchbook and a pencil from behind the counter.
Dean nodded, putting on the suit jacket they had handed him. How did he manage to end up in the show, as briefly as it was? He was gonna kill Cas.
“Fine,” Dean mumbles, looking up at Sam. “I don’t need...” he stops, unable to finish the sentence. He can’t lie to Sam, at least not directly. “He left me, Sam. I told him I needed him and he left.”
Dean watched Anna get up and head to the back. Dean sighed, getting up to start cleaning up the plates. Once everything was clean up, Dean sat back down, fidgeting with a napkin on the table. He glanced up and locked eyes with Cas. Dean smiled and looked down.
: It’s at 11:30pm on Saturday at the State Wayne theater. Have you been to one before?
*******************************************************************************
“This is the cake,” Anna said, taking another bite of it. “It’s amazing,” she added with a smile.
He had made such a huge mistake.
Dean takes in the rumpled trenchcoat, and Cas’ black hair, the Sunday-best oxfords Dean thought he would never see again.
Once they let people into the theater Dean went to the front and looked for his name. Wow it was literally right in the middle. Should be interesting. Dean sat down looking around the theater. He wondered if Cas was backstage.
Cas should have known she was going to do that, after all she had been looking out for him their entire lives.
assumed the two of you were dating.” Anna said standing up. “Look, you can fix this, I’m sure. But if you hurt him again, I will make you regret it.” Anna added, placing the check for the rest of the cake on his desk. “I look forward to seeing the cake in two weeks. Bye, Dean,” she said with a small wave.
Dean smiled at the text, glad that Cas apparently had decided the stupid kiss was no big deal and was obviously just due to the fact Dean had been drinking. He hadn’t wanted to lose Cas as a friend.
It’s not like Dean wanted to give up and accept that Cas no longer wanted him, but holding on and pinning wouldn’t do him any good. It would only hurt him more in the long run.
“You’re...human?” Dean asks softly. Cas nods with a smile.
Dean rubbed at the back of his neck, feeling the heat on his cheeks. “Uh, thanks, Cas,” he said with a smile. “This next one is a chocolate cake with a salted caramel filling and a chocolate ganache. Which I know doesn’t fit what you requested, Anna, but I like to try and throw an unexpected flavor in there to mix it up. Sometimes it ends up being the one that gets picked.”
: Oh now you respect it?
: No.
Dr. Novak came back and removed the glass from in Dean’s ass.
Dean looked up in shock, “coffee?” he repeated.
When Dean turns fifteen he takes up jazz, hip hop and tap. His whole life is dance and Castiel and Dean finds he loves it this way. Castiel doesn’t do dance anymore, having finally stood up to his parents. But he still comes to all of Dean’s practices and works on his writing while Dean dances. A week after he starts the classes he’s invited to do competition dancing. It’s the first time Dean can ever remember being scared about dance.
*****************************************
, again.
“I love you, Cas. I have for...longer than I can remember. I should have told you. I just...I always thought we would have more time.”
“Dean, just answer the question. Actually, here’s a better idea: go tell him yourself that you
“I do,” Anna said. “I really just want something simple, and maybe it’s a tad odd but I want the cake to be royal blue, instead of white. Blue has just always been my favorite color,” she said. Dean’s eyes moved from Anna’s to Cas’, and it all made sense when he locked eyes with the doctor. In his mind, Cas’ eyes really couldn’t be described, but if he had to, he would call them azure.
“But...he came with you to your cake tasting...” Dean said, trailing off with a frown.
Dean looked down, biting his lip. “Anna, I.... I’m sorry. I mean, that’s not an excuse. What I did wasn’t right. Especially given I knew... I mean obviously I knew.”
“Cas, I’m sorry. I... I assumed things I shouldn’t have.”
Dean’s twelve when he stops admitting he does ballet after school. The boys at school mock him and call him gay. It hurts. Dean doesn’t think being gay is a bad thing, but they call him a fag and Dean hates it. So he lies. He lies about dates, and what he does with all his free time. It’s not that girls aren’t pretty, he just doesn’t want to date them or touch them. He would much rather hang out with Cas instead.
“Sounds like a plan then,” Cas agrees with a yawn. They can work it out tomorrow. For now, Dean is gonna kiss Cas some more and fall asleep with his now human angel and for once, be completely happy and content.
Dean clapped with the rest of the audience when the movie ended and followed everyone out. Dean was standing in the lobby when the Magenta actress clapped him on the shoulder.
“What? Why?”
“Perfect, I’ll go get the cakes. Be right back,” Dean said escaping to the back of his bakery. Dean rested his head on the counter. Of course, the hot doctor would be getting married. It’s not like Dean thought he would see Dr. Novak again, but it would be a lie to say that the hot doctor hadn’t shown up in his dreams as of late.
“Okay, Mr. Winchester—” Dr. Novak started to say.
Dean and Castiel have lived a fulfilling life together, filled with love, happiness and laughter. Sometimes Dean thinks back to when he first met Cas, that strange little boy with a tan blanket and thinks about how far they’ve come together. He tells Cas how glad he is that he went and talked to Cas that one day in class. Cas calls him a dork and kisses him softly. At ninety-two the two of them die in their sleep holding each other. It’s sad for Mary and Sam, but they both know this is the way they would have wanted to die, with each other so they never had to be apart.
“Alright! Welcome to the Rocky Horror Picture Show with our shadow cast!” The audience cheered. “If you were lei-ed when you got here please come up to the stage now, we’re going to play a little game!” She said with a grin. Dean groaned, so that’s what that was for.
: Just... don’t bring this up again. I need to move past this.
When he felt the weight lift, Dean thought that was the end of it, but then he felt someone else sit on him. He saw the heels and knew that it was Cas who was straddling his back. And then he felt him thrusting against it. Holy shit. Dean didn’t think he had ever gotten hard so fast in his life. As quick as it had started it was over, and Dean was helped up back to his seat.
With a sigh, Dean started mixing up the batter for a strawberry cheesecake. Once everything was ready to go, Dean popped it in the oven and went up front to grab something to eat.
“Me too, Dean. And then...when I made that deal, I knew I could never tell you. I never wanted to leave you. I’m sorry that I did.”
Dean groaned as he woke up. Shit he had been a fucking idiot last night. Three beers and he’s just throwing himself at a nearly married man? What the actual fuck was wrong with him? Dean needed to text Cas, apologize for the kiss. It was so quick, but so nice. Cas’ lips had been warm and soft. He regretted making fool of himself, obviously, but he almost regretted the kiss more, because now he knew what it felt like to kiss Cas. It felt like everything.
With a sigh, Dean got out of the car and went in through the front door of the bakery.
“Cas...” Dean starts, unsure of what to say next. Can Cas even hear him in the Empty? Dean doesn’t think he can...which means Cas will never know how Dean feels. Dean will never be able to hold Cas’ hand or to kiss him.
: I had a really good time last night. I was wondering if you would like to come see me perform in a Rocky Horror shadow cast next Saturday?
At forty Dean opens up his own dance studio, occasionally Castiel teaches a class just for fun. The dance studio is very successful and Dean has no problems hiring instructors, or with filling up the classes. They even have a waitlist for certain classes. The nights Dean isn’t teaching, him and Cas go for a drive in the impala until they can see the stars, and have a picnic.
“That’s right,” Dean murmurs, lit up and white hot and heartbeat throbbing in his ears, jacking Cas faster as he rocks into his own hand and towards rushing heat. “That’s right, sweetheart, you’re mine. Now let go for me.”
“Oh you can’t imagine,” she says with an overdramatic, put upon sigh. “All the time. They can stare at each other for days straight. Days! You get used to it after a while.”
Cas nods dazedly a couple times and then leans forward, presses a loose kiss to his mouth. “Whatever you want,” Cas rasps out, always knowing the right thing to say, and Dean licks both of their lips.
He sighs into Cas’s mouth and pulls back a bit to check his expression. Cas blinks at him with his pretty blue eyes, dazed and kind of blissed out if Dean had to guess, and Dean has to grin a little.
“Yeah, I did.” He can’t quite believe it himself. He squeezes Cas’s neck gently and leans closer, so their lips are nearly grazing. Seizing on tight to the sudden burst of confidence, he asks, “Can I do it again?”
Blatant. Suggestive. Probably inviting.
Dean’s eyes never leave his once. Cas can’t look away either, captured. They dance easily, Dean guiding him with grace and no trace of self-consciousness. He securely brings them across the floor, and while he has no basis for comparison, Cas finds himself enraptured in the glide.
He takes a quick second to whip off his shirt and another to gather an extra ounce of nerve. They should probably slow down, maybe, talk about the magnitude of this between them, but Dean wasn’t kidding when he said he’s waited long enough. He has no idea what’s going to happen after but fuck if he isn’t going to enjoy it while he can.
Cas groans his name as they move together, touching everywhere in reach, and Dean feels like he’s gone haywire. Grabbing Cas by the back of his firm ass that he always knew existed, Dean grinds in harder, delighting in the broken noises Cas makes each time. He’s vocal and loud, and Dean fucking loves it.
. “Holy shit, Cas,” he says around a grin, wrapping his arms around Cas’s shoulders to bring him back close, where he belongs. “You broke all the lights.”
“Of course I did,” Cas rasps out as Dean’s finishes the final button and slides the shirt off, already savoring the glorious naked skin he’s seen criminally too few times. Cas slides his thumb over Dean’s chin then, and Dean stills, brings his eyes back up. “Not with him, though. Always you.”
He gestures Cas into his room and shuts the door behind him, not wanting any douche canoes to interrupt. Cas sits at his desk chair stiffly. “That’s what I wanted to ask you,” he starts, shifting uneasily. “Today wasn’t very pleasant, and dinner was… interesting.”
Cas makes this low, breathless sound, right against Dean’s mouth. He only has to nod once for Dean to reel him back in.
“You… you did?” Dean chokes out, not knowing how else to respond as he tries to wrap his brain around this new piece of information. He’d kind of assumed Cas’s rescue was more like a snatch and grab, to be honest. Hadn’t wanted to think much beyond that.
If Dean had a gun on him, he’s certain he’d blow the fucker’s head clean off.
Sounds about right.
An hour later, Dean feels like he’s about to vibrate out of his skin. He should be exhausted after the events of the day but can’t even sit down, pacing the room back and forth.
“Oh, please call me Cas, we aren’t at the hospital,” he corrected Dean with another small smile.
“Fine... okay. I get it, I won’t go back there anymore,” Sam said as Dr. Novak and the nurse from earlier came back into the room.
him. Because both of you need to work this out, now.”
: I always did, Cas.
“Really, Sam? That’s where your mind took you? Not that I made a horrible mistake assuming that Cas was marrying Anna, but that she is somehow legally marrying her brother?” Dean shook his head. “You’re a dumbass.”
Sam shook his head with a small smile. “Dean, we have more than enough stuff to last us through probably the next three days. Go.”
“Oh, it was great. I really liked all of it.” Dean said with a blush.
“Meg, don’t pick on the virgin.” He heard a British voice say near him. Dean turned and saw the guy who was Riff-Raff coming over to them. “Although I guess now Cassie here has popped your cherry, didn’t he?” He said smirking at Dean.
“Everyone’s gone, why would...why would Billie take everyone?” Sam asks in disbelief.
Shaking his head, Cas picked up the bottle of whiskey that was next to the couch and took a long sip, pulling out his phone.
“Great, we could go during your lunch?” Cas suggested, pulling out his cell phone.
“Go away. Just...” Cas said, shaking his head. “Please, just leave.” He added and shut the door.
“The time before that you somehow managed to dent my countertops. You just wreck shit when you come back there. It’s why you’re
“Uhh your fiancé?” He asked, sitting back down. What the hell was going on?
Dean is seventeen when he does a solo at a competition of all the dances he knows. It’s the most complicated dance he’s ever done, involving several costume and shoe changes but he pulls it off and wins platinum. Someone records it and puts it on youtube. The next week he gets a call from Juilliard, they want him for their school and are willing to give him a full ride. He’s so shocked that he’s not sure what to do and that’s how Cas finds him an hour later, still clutching on to the house phone. When Cas finally pries the news out of him they celebrate together with a fancy dinner and sparkling cider. Dean thinks he’s never been more in love with Cas than he is in this moment.
Dean is five years old when Mary signs him up for his first ballet class. He’s awkward and doesn’t remember most of the steps at the recital, but he’s five and his lack of knowledge is adorable and the audience awes and cheers for him. Dean is five years old when he first realizes he loves the sound of applause and knowing it’s for him.
Another week passes and Dean tells his mom how he loves Cas. Mary only nods and lets Dean know she had known since he was nine. Dean smiles and tell Cas the next day while Castiel rubs at his feet and ankles. Dean decides Cas is a great boyfriend and tells Cas so. In return Castiel kisses him, and smiles the rest of the day.
“Dean,” Cas said with a sigh, crossing his arms.
Dean and Cas are both thirty when they adopt twins, a boy and a girl. They name them Sam and Mary. They become Dean and Cas’ entire world and they both take a month away from working to watch after their two bundles of joy.
“How? Cas, how are you here?” Dean asks in disbelief.
“I agree. I mean all the cakes were wonderful but this one works so well,” Cas said pushing Anna’s fork away from the last bite of the cake.
“But you love him,” Sam said sadly.
He shook his head. No flirting with the cute but soon-to-be-married doctor, damn it. “Yes, hello Dr. Novak.”
In the end it was him and five other people on the stage. One by one they introduced themselves and were handed a red balloon. “Alright, now I need six cast members up here on stage.” She said, and Dean turned to watch several people run out from behind the curtain including Cas.
“Well we have about 300 guests coming, so what would you recommend?” Anna said.
“Did you listen to a word I just said?” Anna said cutting him off. “I’m not switching. Cas would probably kill me if I did.” She sighed and shook her head. “I’m pissed but whatever happened between you and my brother is between you two.”
“Cas...I don’t even know if you can hear me. I should have.. I should have told you before. You can have what you want,” Dean says as he sobs. “I love you. I love you. I should have...I’m so sorry, Cas.”
“I mean it this time, Sam, you are banned from my kitchen. Every time you’re back there something like this happens!” Dean exclaimed.
Dean Winchester was having a terrible day and it was entirely Sam’s fault.
pulled that kind of crap I would stab them in their neck on principle. Why should I give him a free pass?” Dean asks, annoyed.
Dean finished up his dinner, turning off his TV. It was only 8pm, but Dean still got ready for bed. He had to be up early to open the bakery and he knew that he would probably have trouble falling asleep tonight. Which was stupid since the coffee would not be a date. But Dean’s mind wasn’t always rational or at all helpful. Dean wished it could be a date.
“Dean...do you love him?” Sam asks, a knowing smile on his face.
He obviously didn’t find all of them, but Dean won’t give him the satisfaction. He doesn’t take his eyes off Cas. “Come back to bed with me,” Dean repeats lowly, impatient for him to get the hint. He’s not above dragging Cas out by his coat.
Cas sighs, a quiet content sound. He leaves his palm on Dean’s arm when he brings their mouths back together into the sweetest kiss yet.
“I know you tried your best, Cas,” Dean manages, aching from the idea Cas didn’t give up on him for a decade when they hadn’t even known each other yet, and he still hasn’t, another decade later. Dean tries to give him a reassuring smile. “All that matters is that you did find me. You saved me.”
“Hi,” he says again in lieu of anything intelligent.
Cas smiles, a half, tentative thing, and Dean’s guts spill onto the floor. “I’m glad that Castiel could be of… good service to you.”
Fuckface Dean had moved toward the end of the meal to sit right next to Cas. They were still talking when Dean stormed out, knees agonizingly close to touching. Cas was responding easily to him, not uncomfortable anymore from what Dean could tell. He certainly wasn’t telling the sleazebag to fuck off like he should.
It’s stilted and disturbing and more than little infuriating, and Dean has never wanted to punch his own face more. He’s not sure what to do with these creepy parodies of him and his brother, but he knows they absolutely cannot stay here. Peru should be nice this time of year. Better than being buried in a shallow ditch, surely.
Only, suddenly, Cas stands up from the chair. He closes the distance between them and places his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean thinks Cas must feel his rapid pulse where the tip of his thumb rests on Dean’s bare skin. He looks up at Cas, holding his breath, dying to reach out in return.
He marches up to them and shoves the imposter away, hard, not sparing a glance when he hits the floor. Then he wraps a hand around Cas’s neck, pulls him in the way he’s always wanted to, and kisses him.
after all they’ve been through, claws at him like hellhounds.
Everyone else seems properly pleased or smug, and even Bobby has a smirk hidden behind his beer bottle. Dean’s laughing awkwardly and pink in the cheeks when Cas checks back on him, but he still looks so endearingly content that Cas can’t bring himself to be embarrassed in the least.
The bastard gives him another smirk but does raise his hands in surrender. “Alright, alright, I get it. Fucking off,” he says, and he shoots Cas a wink as he leaves. Any other time Dean would go strangle him and enjoy it thoroughly; as it is, he’s too busy navigating one of the most significant moments of his life.
Fuck that.
Having Cas back so close now gives him back a little sanity, at least. They have Jack back too, and he’s quietly thrilled by how much joy that brings Cas, because he deserves it more than anyone. If Chuck and imminent death weren’t hanging over their heads, Dean could maybe go on pretending this is still enough for him.
. Cas kisses like he does everything else – intensely, resolutely, with an undercurrent of otherworld electricity that zips through Dean’s veins delightfully. He matches Dean’s pace, yields easily to Dean’s pressing tongue.
Man-bun Sam snorts at his brother but remains otherwise undisturbed by the casual flirt, whereas Dean’s pretty sure the rest of them are gaping in bewilderment. He isn’t positive though, as he’s unable to take his eyes off Cas to gauge his reaction.
, yeah, but definitely nothing like that. He’s never lingered on Cas’s mouth and licked his lips and – well, that might not be the best example, but he’s never acted that outrageously indecent with Cas.
Cas stands right outside, blinking back in surprise. His fists are clenched at his sides, and he looks warily apologetic.
He nearly makes it to the kitchen when he hears all too familiar voices: Cas, who sounds two octaves too high, and the other Dean, who’s speaking in low, fucking dulcet tones.
He takes Cas into his mouth slowly, as far as he can go, heart pounding. He chances a glance up at Cas and finds him staring raptly back, looking positively stunned, slack jawed and wild at the edges. Not breaking their gaze, Dean bobs his head a couple times, and Cas lets out the most incredible moan yet, rough and reverberating through the whole damn kitchen. Dean grins as best he can with his mouth stretched, which just makes Cas thrash more.
always been like this, not the way they are now. Granted, none of them know about this development yet, at least not out loud, but surely the nature of his relationship with Dean is somewhat obvious and therefore his actions... well, excusable.
When he steps back, still gripping Cas gently, Cas lets himself be pulled up. He trusts Dean with his life, with everything he has, and he knows Dean won’t lead him anywhere Cas can’t follow. Neither of them will, not anymore.
Cas nods once after a long moment, seeming awkward. Dean tries not to be viciously glad. “Yes, my true name is Castiel. I believe the alternates of me rescue you from the pit in most universes.”
It’s the best orgasm of his life.
“Maybe we do,” Dean grates out before Cas can respond. Cas’s jaw drops open a little, but he doesn’t deny it, thank fucking god. He starts inching away from the douchey Dean, and fierce triumph rushes through Dean with every step.
Cas finally glances up. The distress in his expression makes Dean wants to reach out and grab on to him, fingers twitching. “Did I ever tell you that I spent years looking for you?”
Everything kind of just goes quiet.
Nobody speaks for several moments. Dean thinks his heart is about to beat out of his chest, alien-style. He knows that suggestive tone, having used it his entire sexually awoken existence. In another life, apparently, he never spent forty years downstairs
Cas sways for a moment in his grip. “I’ll try my best,” he finally responds, but he sounds distressed again. Dean supposes it is a lot to ask with the universe literally about to end, but he didn’t want to make Cas sad.
“Fuck,” he mutters as he runs his hands over Cas’s sides and back. He’s all hard lines and soft, soft skin. Dean’s heart is beating wildly, overstimulated already. He nips at Cas’s jaw as he takes a second to catch his breath, trying to grasp even a scrap of composure, but Cas gasps at the teeth and rocks his whole body into Dean’s. His nails dig into Dean’s back, sending a simmering, raw shockwave through him.
A few glorious things happen at once: Cas cries out so loud that surely the whole bunker hears, coming messily on Dean’s face; Dean takes him back in his mouth to swallow the rest of it as he comes with a groan into his fist; the lights surge in the peripheral of his blurred vision and then literally burst with a resounding pop.
, Dean thinks, wishing for one of the few times that Cas could read his eyes, his mind, something.
Several minutes later Mary is in the midst of telling the table a vaguely horrifying but hilarious story from her teenage hunting years when she trails off, eyebrows raised in amusement somewhere behind him. Before he can follow her gaze, a familiar arm wraps around his chest, holding on quite firmly.
Now, though – now he’s wondering if that’s exactly what’s about to happen, right here in his own home, and he’s not even invited.
He presses his lips to Cas’s temple. “Cas, you know I…” Dean squeezes his eyes shut and grabs Cas’s hand, presses it to the shoulder where his mark once laid. “I’m yours, too,” he admits softly instead, hoping it’s enough.
Both of their heads whip in his direction, Cas jumping back and instantly seeming embarrassed. The other Dean isn’t phased in the slightest. He smirks at Dean, cocky as hell, and says, “You’re interrupting.”
“Hey, Cas,” he says back, just as quiet. He’s pretty sure he has whiplash from how swiftly he’s steadied just by Cas’s presence. His heartbeat continues thumping wildly in his throat, but frankly that happens almost all the time around Cas. “Everything good?”
“Where are you going? I mean. What’re you gonna do all night?” Dean tries, voice pathetic to his own ears.
He just hopes his alternate self is as much of a spineless moron as him.
Especially since Cas isn’t being felt up in one of the guest rooms.
He should say… something. Anything. The opportunity presents itself like an outstretched hand, but his mouth goes cotton dry and he can’t seem to remember how to form a single word.
Dean finally has to look away then, down at the empty glass in his hand. He doesn’t even remember finishing it, and he needs another one or ten.
Knowing that some stand in Dean might be down the hall laying hands on his angel, just for
Somewhere in the back of his mind he registers a chuckle, and he remembers with an irritated pop that they have an audience. Dean turns his head to shoot a nasty glare at his alternate self, who’s watching them with too much amusement and not nearly enough fear.
