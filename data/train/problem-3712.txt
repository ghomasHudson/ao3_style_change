“Would you like to pretend we aren’t together and act confused when he asks why all of my possessions are in your apartment?”
Jack popped his head out of a tent. "It's gonna be Claire, Maggie, and me in this tent. You, Jody, and Donna can have that other one. Sam and Rowena get the little one."
Dean held still for as long as he could before letting his watery breath out. “Not in your lifetime.” He waited for his fingers to stop shaking before splaying them across Castiel’s chest. “Hey, Cas?”
"Only one thing can get out, so yes," she told him. "Though I still am off the case until things get better around here."
Claire popped the glove box open and rummaged around for the legendary cassette, but something stopped her hand.
This was before Eden. He and a few other angels guarded the gates of Heaven. We never thought to question what could possibly be trying to enter.
Castiel forced his own arms down, eyes wide as he stared at the soft face across from him. "I apologize. I uh... I had a nightmare, I think."
Regardless, Gabriel used to hide me between his seven pairs of wings and slide out the gates, me in tow. I'm sure, thinking back, that Gadreel knew. He saw no harm in our antics, though, which is why I assume he let us pass so often.
"You know, we haven't been dating for a super long time. What if you meet some other girl that'll sweep you off your feet?"
don't ask me to prove that." There were soft giggles that neither noticed. "I love you. I love you. Marry me, Maggie Elizabeth."
that looked like you? He begged me not to tell you, but I think it doesn’t really matter now. Plus, it’s my job as an annoying little brother. Brother-in-law?”
"He is not there anymore." Castiel pressed absently at his own ears, like he was trying to muffle the noise.
Castiel chuckled softly to himself, brushing Dean’s hair back. “So you think we’re in this so-called ‘cupcake phase’?”
"You call him that, yes. Christ isn't really a name though, per se. It means 'anointed one'. And he prefers Josh nowadays."
“I’m just a bit pissed is all. We’ve got bigger problems.” Jack watched the ball hit a tree and explode. It should have been satisfying, but it just made him angrier.
Dean grabbed him and pushed him against the ground, caging him with his own arms. “You and me, Michael. We’re the same.” His blood dripped down onto Michael’s face, who growled in response.
He was a kid again. A kid sitting on the pavement outside, sniffling about a scraped knee. And Dean had come over, crouched down and smiled at him before patching him up gently.
And Dean got all nervous and asked why, and I told him Isabelle was sucking face over in the corner. And Dean glanced over at Mark and asked me, “So we’re not uh… embarrassing you?”
“ENOUGH!” Michael snapped, shoving them both into their seats with a wave of his hand. He glared at Gabriel. “There will be no ultimatum.” He turned to Naomi. “You are free to dissent. You are free to try to stop us. We are not holding the past against anyone.” His eyes flitted briefly to Castiel.
..." Dean choked, coughing a little, and Castiel was surprised at the shininess of Dean's eyes, even down here. "Because I'm scared, Cas."
There were hackles raised, wings spread intimidatingly. Here was the rebel, the traitor, the scourge.
Remember me as late night stories. Remember me as long car rides with rock playing. Remember me as bad karaoke sessions. Remember me as anything that makes you happy. Please, be happy when you remember me.
She nodded. “Your views are acknowledged and respected. However, you are outvoted in this regard, it seems.”
the lifeless bodies of the firstborns surrounded them. And the nonbelievers screamed and cried, and the Pharaoh was so stricken with grief he let the believers go. I can’t
Michael looked at him frantically, breathing hard. “Look at what I’ve done! Look around you! I’ve damned you! I’ve damned us
Dean was treading through underbrush. It clung to his legs, poked holes into his jeans. But there was a creek this way, he knew.
It was a rush for him, I think, to pretend he was God. Like a child in his father's shoes and coat. Too big on him, but very cute, nonetheless.
The battle began to shift. The humans couldn't keep up without God on their side. Patroclus and I stayed in our tent, talking in hushed tones and tasting each other's skin, as death and destruction reigned around us.
Rowena pulled her shoulders back and raised her chin. "Okay. We will get through this. Together." She sat down beside Sam, hand running through his hair gently. "Sam, talk to me?"
I was not made to acknowledge pain. I was a soldier, made to withstand the brutalities of demonic war. The wind was not to sway me.
Charlie shut off the motorcycle, offering a hand to help Claire off. They stowed their helmets and walked inside.
Castiel looked down at Sam, and, though Sam could not see it, there was worry on his face. “Have you… been here before?”
"I'm here, I'm here," Sam said, forcing his eyes open. It was dark and fluffy. "What's uh… what's up?"
“We were building your room right next to mine, just in case you ever missed me in the night and decided to come snuggle.”
“Sure, but they never stop to think about it.” Rowena huffed through her nose. “Christ, it’s too early for anythin’ poetic. Sam, the difference between ye and bad people is that bad people never wake up wonderin’ if they’re bad people.”
Maggie patted the soil down around some new flowers, sitting back on her heels to admire them. They were daffodils. She had chosen them precisely because of what they meant.
other side of the Bunker, sure. It's been over ten years since I've gotten to do anything just because, and I'm sure it's been a while for you, too."
an answer,” Gabriel snapped back. He took a breath. “But if it helps at all… he did tell you goodbye.”
“Castiel,” he began. “I uh, wrote my own. So.” Dean stared deep into Castiel’s eyes, like he had so many times before. This time, though, was so much different than every time before. “I told you once I fell in love with you in Purgatory.”
"The crime rate against girls with pink hair has tremendously increased," Sam told Dean back at the motel, staring at his laptop screen.
It was Jack's doing; he was sure of it. He fished his cellphone out of his pocket, not bothering to move from where he was smushed into something soft.
Jack grasped desperately at Maggie's hands, eyes wide and serious as he said, "Mine love for the cocoa is overshadowed not by the grain, nor drink, nor still. Mine love for the cocoa is deepened just by my love for—" Jack paused, trying to think up a rhyme, "the pickles of dill."
Mark was a cool guy. He didn’t talk a whole lot, but what he did say was either very nice or very funny. It was… It was a good time. I used to walk between them and they’d throw their arms over my shoulders like they were trying to embarrass me.
Castiel's hand grabbed his wrist. “I think you’re trying to figure out your feelings for me. Am I wrong?”
The chapter title is taken from "Everything Stays" by Marceline from Adventure Time (and obviously Rebecca Sugar)
Jack watched as Claire and Maggie fell asleep on the couch, smiling. They both deserved happiness, after all of this.
“I know. I know. You’ve got four extra right now. But Sam…” Dean ran a hand over his face, looking on as his younger brother gave the camera a gap-toothed grin, holding his first lost baby tooth. “I’m pretty damn old now. I’d like some peace and quiet.”
They both stared wide-eyed at the TV for a moment before saying simultaneously, "I never went to prom."
Gabriel paused before smiling softly. "Yeah. That's it. It's the only title I've had that I actually liked."
Sam and Rowena shared a glance before Sam walked over to Gabriel, grabbed his shirt, and pulled him in for a kiss. “Date me,” Sam said.
But even if you don't, know I'm loving you every single day from here. Know that I think about you all the time. Know that I don't regret a single second of us.
Dean was letting out small sounds, sounds that Cas wasn’t sure he had ever known humans could make, sounds that seemed to ring out across space and time. Dean fumbled for Castiel’s free hand and dragged it down to his dick, pleading.
There was so much she could say, so much they could talk about. The three younger adults had fallen asleep in Sam's bed, Sam himself in a chair beside them, his red-rimmed eyes keeping watch.
He tried to believe in Sam, to mirror his faith. But Gabriel found there was only dread in the pit of his stomach.
me to!” Castiel had stormed closer, had bared his teeth and his throat, eyes hellfire and mouth suddenly the same, crashed against Dean’s. “I loved you, too, you
"Yeah. Sounds like they're leaning towards an assembly to throw out ideas. Everyone realized God isn't coming back."
And wasn't that a strange memory? It played in her head as Sam quietly started on eggs, afraid any noise would break the tentative peace they had formed.
Maggie stretched to a drawer and pulled out the map they had been making. "We never finished this, so I don't know."
“Yeah. But he also wasn’t at the lake alone in the early morning, like I’m sure he would be here.” Claire crouched at the edge, squinting into the murky depths. “Maybe we could repaint it. Make it something he can’t be depressed about.”
It… hurt, to let go. But I was trapping him, forcing him into an afterlife of trying to be there for me. He didn't deserve that. He deserved to be happy, to let his soul go onward.
Dean grinned against his hair, pressing open-mouthed kisses to anywhere he could reach. “I love you so much,” Dean told him, soaking in Castiel.
thousands of years to talk things out. And even if we did… I’m… scared for him.” Dean looked at the only decoration in the room. It was a picture of him. “I want to be here and help him but… you felt it, too, didn’t you? At the reception?”
“He told me… He told me to tell you he’s proud of you. And he’s sorry. And he thinks about you every single day, and wonders what kind of person you’ve become. He’s sad he missed your entire life, basically. He wanted to teach you everything he had learned, tell you all his stories. And he—” Gabriel had to look away from the crying eyes. “He said he finds peace in knowing that Sam would raise you better than he ever could. He said goodbye.”
"I wish." Claire walked over to his bed and plopped onto it. "Rooms we don't use very much swap around. I was thinking we need to make a like, moveable map?"
“Yeah? So I just get to tease you for eternity?” Dean smiled against Castiel’s throat. “Sounds fine to me.”
“Do we even have a place here anymore? I know they’d all say so, but…” Dean trailed off, feeling suddenly vulnerable and unsure.
“You know how I know?” Dean continued, grabbing Michael’s wrists and wrestling the book away. “Because you’re
“You’ll never take me alive, coppers!” Dean responded with a ridiculous accent, grin widening at Castiel’s laugh.
“Can… Can you tell me about time first? Because if it all doesn’t line up, there’s nothing to worry about.”
"Dean, I've... I've done some very terrible things. Things I am not proud of. Things you could never forgive me for."
Michael knelt down, knees on either side of Dean’s legs, and smashed his face with a tome. “If you’re going to say something,
Jody shrugged. “What can I say? I’m a violent sleeper.” She handed off the mug. “I talked to Sam just a bit ago.”
"Don't be fucking sorry," Gabriel groaned, running his hands over his face. "Things needed to change. But goddammit, this won't be fun to debate about up top."
Castiel looked at the constellations Dean had carved in the coffin lid. “Humans call it time. Your perception is so small. You think it moves in one direction, and you think it controls everything, that it wilts and decays you. It does not. What you call time is actually more accurately called
Castiel's throat felt tight, so he wrapped Dean up in his arms. "I love you, too, Dean. And every memory with you in it."
Gabriel would flap his wings once, mightily, and send the clouds cascading in every direction, swirling and creating new forms and shapes. We would name them as we saw them, as nothing was named yet.
“Another Ma’lak box.” Sam laid his torch aside. “That’s why I called you all here. I’ve been working on this all day and it’s almost done.”
And Dean wished Castiel would stop looking at him, because he could feel leaves pressing into his trachea.
Gabe shrugged. “If she will not stand with us, perhaps she can still help us by figuring that bit out.”
"Okay Professor Cas, I didn't know this was going to be an entire discussion on an entirely alternate universe. I mean, if Mom and Dad had never fallen in love, Sam and I wouldn't even exist so the point's kinda null, ain't it?"
Once it was just him in the void, he sat back in his chair, head in his hands. So much was running through his mind. He felt like his thoughts were on fire, like whatever liquid his brain was suspended in was boiling.
Naomi glared Raphael down. “No,” she said. “I will fight this. The souls in here do not deserve to visit the Earth. I will make sure this plan does not work.”
Dean reached up, wrapped his hands around Michael's wrist. "If you break that, I won't be suffering anymore. I won't remember."
“You do,” Castiel said resolutely. “But even if you didn’t, his actions are not your decisions to make. He’s going to find a way to cure you of the mark. He
Fergus held up a hand, his other firmly in Rowena's. "That uh…" He laughed once, not meeting Sam's eyes. "It seems that won't be a problem anymore. For anyone."
And I don’t expect you to do anything with this information. I don’t know if you feel the same, anyway. There have been times when I thought maybe, but… I dunno.
I've stared at your lips and dreamt of nothing more than simply being able to kiss you? Or even hold your hand?" Dean propped his head up to try and see Castiel. "This is already so much more than I ever thought I'd actually get, Cas. It's already more than I dared to want. I'm okay with just this. Really."
The hallway lights were blessedly off, and he stumbled until he found another door and opened it. The lights came on automatically, and he hissed and shielded his eyes.
“Oh, how very adventurous of you. Are you sure it’s safe?” Cas teased. “Perhaps we should stock up on rock salt and grab the Colt.”
TELL ME HE NEVER LOVED ME!” he screamed, flipping them, pushing all his weight onto Dean’s trachea. “He was the
A sigh, then, “I wish I could say, confidently, no. But the truth is, there are some days I wonder how things would have been different. I can’t say that it would’ve been better. In fact, I sincerely doubt it would have been. I just…” Castiel took his hand back to run over his own face. “I wish I could see both outcomes. See how things could have gone differently. Maybe if I had turned traitor quicker, we could have avoided some things. Or what if I never had?”
Dean kissed Castiel deeply, tongue roving. He shrugged his shoulders, and Cas laughed into his mouth, pulling away. Dean grinned at him. “I’ll let you pick.”
He hesitated there, unsure, before looking back at Castiel. His wet hair was plastered to his head, and he was admiring a butterfly that had landed on his elbow. In fact, it looked like he was conversing with it.
“Let him go find a life for himself, outside of me. I… I dragged him into this mess when I went to Stanford to find him. Maybe he just… needs an out.”
Sam looked off to the side. He could see the void and the faint outline of the room his body was in. Like holding an image in front of one eye while the other looks at something else. “Jack called me Dad today,” Sam blurted unexpectedly.
Dean shrugged in the darkness. "Like, are there any memories that just kinda weigh on you, ya know?"
"Whatever," she rolled her eyes and grabbed the book. "When it sucks, expect me to call you at three in the morning. You don't get to sleep if it sucks."
Gabriel was off somewhere with Maggie, teaching her about homunculi and showing her how to form them.
Sam sighed. "Believe me or not. It doesn't matter yet. We know this will work now. Or at least, this part will." Sam looked back over his shoulder as if listening to someone before glancing back at Dean. "I've got to go, Dean."
"Maggie Elizabeth Evans," Claire mumbled against her lips, "you wanna just go to the courthouse tomorrow and get married?"
Dean guarded the record against his chest, gasping in mock shock. "Johnny Cash is gonna come back and haunt you." He paused. "On second thought, yes. Please do that."
"And it was like…" Jack made a grasping motion. "Like we could move whatever we wanted and see the ripples, could see what would happen and why and how."
“Oh, it went fantastic! We went and saw a movie, threw popcorn at each other, and—” Charlie paused in her painting for a moment. “And other stuff. It was a good night.”
Then, as if things couldn’t become much worse, the Alpha was starting to cramp up, badly. Dean could feel his legs tensing up, the soreness spreading across his body was hurting like a bitch. This has never happened to him before, he didn’t understand
The Alpha wrapped his large and rough fingers around the Omega’s delicate ones, coming closer to Castiel as if he were a wounded animal. “Cas, you’re okay. I’m right here. You don’t have to be afraid of me, I won’t hurt you.”
Dean smirked, his black eyes in place while returning the favor and invading Castiel’s personal space. “I’m doing everything I can to control every inch of my body.”
Slowly and sensually, Dean placed two fingers inside his mouth, sucking on the cold digits and warming Castiel’s fingers with his tongue. “You sure, I can’t change your mind? Don’t you wanna play with me? I can be on all fours for you so you can fuck me from the back.”
The Smash games lasted until Jo called for everyone to come and get lasagna when it was paused and everyone migrated to the kitchen.
Cas sat down in the last open seat next to Dean on the couch, and since it was such a small couch, they sat legs pressed together. Charlie, on his other side, was half on the little armrest and sat cross-legged, so only her knee bumped into his thigh.
"I need a break," Charlie said, standing, the motion causing the candles sitting on the table around her to flicker.
Nevertheless, Dean gets up to fish through his duffle bag for the Mysterium box and places it on the coffee table (as it was bigger than the dining table and needed for Mysterium since it took up so much space).
He could feel Sam's presence before he could hear him, and his heart swelled with a contempt sigh, "Hiya, Sammy."
Dean had just gotten back to the table with his second plate when the power flipped off again and the room plunged into darkness.
"Wow that's beautiful," Cas said, leaning on the railing for a moment before realizing it was covered in ice.
"She's ok but every second hurt, and also, my fingers have frozen over," Dean held up his hands for dramatic effect.
"I never, gave myself time to think about you, let alone grieve or process what happened to you, or what happened between us."
"And I know that we'll only get in an hour or so of four-player Smash so I gotta get it going now," Charlie said, grabbing the other controllers from a cabinet under the TV, "Besides Mysterium will be fun and spooky in the dark with the candles and shit."
Dean stood in front of the door, suddenly unable to move. His head filled with the image of Castiel crying, smiling, being consumed by the empty. He could feel the numb heartbreak as he was cast aside and watched his best friend die all over again.
Dean walked over and sat at the open chair, leaving his bag, coat, and boots by the door at the coat rack.
Dean took a deep breath, noting the clean, pure smell of cold hanging in the air, picturing the scene.
Rowena got up from the bed, placing her laptop on a nearby desk and resting her hands on her hips. “You boys don’t understand, me and Fergus have been trying for
Dean’s teeth were digging into the meat of his cheeks, his hands were balling into fists. “A very good question indeed.”
What the hell, man? This couldn’t be right, if this was Castiel then Dean was epically boned, which he wouldn’t mind if Castiel offered to do. But in all seriousness, the dude’s hotness was illegal. He should consider suing. But of course, to make things even more foolish for himself, Dean could faintly feel his knees becoming wobbly and frail, and since he was wasn’t reacting fast enough, his knees — without his permission — became weak as hell and to his embarrassment, his legs were buckling beneath him.
Once the Alpha was satisfied, Dean removed his fingers from the Omega’s dripping wet hole and sharply slapped Castiel’s bouncy ass. It was a wonder, watching the two mounds of fleshy meat jiggling at the touch of the Alpha’s hands. Before laying himself on top of the Omega, Dean mischievously pressed a kiss against Castiel’s entrance, drenching his lips in the Omega’s ridiculously sweet slick.
And to make things even cuter, Castiel’s name was embroidered onto his romper, located at the left side of the Omega’s chest was the finely woven string of glittering baby pink thread. And not to say that his outfit was an overload of cuteness but along with a pair of pearly white Keds, it was safe to say that complimenting Castiel with the words,
the Alpha could feel his instincts acting up again, not only that but the sulfuric scent flooding through his nostrils was getting even worse.
to be raped. That Castiel should take every beating without complaints because that’s what Omegas were built for. Those hurtful words made the Omega cry even more, Castiel never asked to be with Lucifer and he certainly didn’t
Sam looked into his father’s eyes, deep breaths were making the Alpha’s chest rise up and down, Sam wanted to fight his father on this topic but as usual, the Alpha resigned his position and took a seat in his chair.
The Omega was being horribly raped by his mate. This was all happening before Dean’s eyes, at first, the Alpha was shocked but then Dean’s vision went red. Every primitive instinct screaming inside his body was commanding the Alpha to leave his house, break into the house next door, enter the bedroom, and beat the flipping shit out of the son of a bitch who was raping his innocent Omega.
The Alpha couldn’t stand the sight of the Omega rejecting his gaze, so Dean gently whispered, “Cas, look at me.
That’s all Dean ever saw in a span of closing his eyes for three whole seconds. A nightmare that haunted the torturous corners of his mind. The Alpha widely opened his eyes, instantly lifting himself from the bed and having no other choice but to pace back and forth like a wild animal being driven to accept the iron cage as his new home, reaching one end and clawing at the traitor who forced him into a small confined space, then turning to reach the other end.
The sharp and unfriendly sound made the Omega whimper, without knowing what to do himself, Castiel wrapped his arms around his body. The Omega was searching for his home, a place of safety even though the four walls that surrounded him everyday were poor excuses of a true home.
Whatever opinion you think I have of you, it’s wrong. If anything, I’d rather everyone humiliate me than let anyone see you for what you’re not.”
Blood lineage was considered important to the Winchester family, monopolizing the choice of demon mates to ensure the bearing of pure-blooded pups was just as important as making a blood pack with a reaper. Henry made it his solid duty to teach John about the importance of keeping their bloodline clean and never
Dean was so consumed by the Omega’s beauty that he barely caught the faraway words spoken by Sam. “What?”
Dean and Sam smirked at each other, their conversation falling into a comfortable silence until the red neon lights from Dean’s favorite bar were blinking at a distance and the sound of loud booming music became audible. The entrance was crowded with rogue demons and Dean smiled lustfully at all the Omegas huddled together.
Before Dean could question more about the adorable yet asshole sounding guy who was Castiel, there was a loud scream coming from the second floor. “
The Omega squealed, Castiel was dying at how adorable his future husbands were. “How can I refuse? How does a spring wedding sound to all of you?”
Dean could feel his fingertips burning with an eager anticipation, the sea of raven strands was easily enchanting him.
The Omega turned his head to the side, facing the Alpha while pressing his lips against Dean’s blood covered ones but not kissing him. “
The car was starting to feel hot; with the intense afternoon sun beaming down at the vehicle and Lucifer’s pheromones failing to die away, Castiel decided to go against the Alpha’s orders and step out of the car before he had a heat stroke. The Omega exhaled in pure triumph at breathing clean air once again, lazily fanning himself to will away the furious red blush on his cheeks due to the heat.
Sam, for a second, felt as if he were trespassing Dean’s territory. The older Alpha was baring his teeth, like a wolf challenging other pack mates to participate in a bloody fight for the prize of winning the perfect bond mate. There was a scent engulfing Sam, pheromones that were reeking of primal defensive needs, a poisoned aroma interlaced with a heady musk that was making Sam cough.
The Omega could feel his fingers prickling in a frenzy manner, the violent urgency to comb through Sam’s silky hair and hear the Alpha growl at the touch, was making Castiel yearn like a twelve-year-old girl drunk off of teenage hormones. Unlike Dean Winchester; Sam’s face was clean, smooth skin shining in full glory and Castiel wanted nothing more than to cup the Alpha’s face, peppering Sam’s cheeks with docile kisses until the Alpha couldn’t hold back the temptation any longer, claiming the Omega’s lips as his.
Dean looked back at the Omega, a sinful smile spreading across his lips as he began to charge towards Castiel again. “Oh, sweet thing, sorry for the minor interruption but if you wanna speed things up, just turn around and I’ll show you a
Gabriel began to cackle like a hyena. “Trust me, Cassie bear is shy and odd but man, he’s a demon in the sack. I think you two might hit it off.”
Dean embraced his mother; the Alpha desperately peppered Castiel’s cheeks, nose, and forehead with wet kisses but the temptation to consume his mother’s provocative lips was impossible to ignore. “
Castiel was basically running towards the diner located at the corner of the road, a small little place that highlighted the forest ambient in Lawrence, Kansas.
The Alpha shoved the Omega against the mattress again, digging his fingers into Castiel’s hips and feeling the rush of blood dripping down the Omega’s sides due to his nails breaking the skin. Dean was starting to burn up, the bottom of his belly was literally on fire as he kept fucking the Omega with punishing thrusts that left Castiel scrambling for purchase.
Chuck exhaled happily, “Oh thank god. I’m sorry if the question was uncomfortable but knowing my son, he may act all mean and tough but in the bedroom he’s a needy slut. But I still love him.”
over the Omega. Dean wanted to continue talking with the Omega when an unknown Alpha exited the house, yelling at the Omega and Dean felt a dangerous flicker of carnal violence surging through his veins as the Alpha approached the Omega, calling him derogatory names and grabbing the hideous collar suffocating the Omega’s slender throat.
, those lovely pecs would nicely fit against Dean’s enormous hands, squeezing the tender flesh and making the Omega moan for him. And
Gabriel stood up from his seat. “Our perfect candidate is my younger Omega brother. He’s had his fair share in education at college and has enough grace to make this job look like sex. I can bring him in today and you can interview him, if that’s alright with you, Mr. Winchester.”
Dean was so happy and… why did the Omega taste like bedsheets? What the heck, the Alpha was on the verge of telling Castiel how much he cared for him when the taste in his mouth ruined everything.
Even better, Dean could murder the Alpha for even thinking that he had the absolute right to lay his abusive hand on
, his lips. So plump, tender, full, and colored in a pale pink that caused Dean’s cock to become erect, his girth was thickening at the idea of biting through those lips, gnawing them, tasting them and watching the way those pink lips would become red and rosy.
Dean swallowed down a handful of salvia, growling lustfully as his rough fingers gently squeezed at the Omega’s
Gabriel chuckled as he walked towards Lucifer. “So, you think it’s okay to waltz into my diner and harass my Omega customers? Specifically, my brother?”
the Alpha to bite through the unclaimed skin, marking the Omega as his, and losing himself to the carnal urge of fucking Castiel until the Omega couldn’t remember his own name, but he’d sure as hell remember Dean’s name. The Alpha growled as if he were a starved predator, normally, Dean loved playing with his food, but for the Omega pinned beneath him, he was willing to make an exception and go straight for the kill.
to surf through Castiel’s messy and gorgeous strands with his fingers. To drown himself amongst Castiel’s perfect sex hair.
, Castiel had a damn cute nose. Their lips were dangerously hovering over one another, a sliver of space between them. Audible breaths were coming out hot and fervent, melting into their pores. Dean helplessly stared at Castiel’s beauty, admiring him as if the Omega were a sacred relic worth protecting.
It didn’t seem appropriate but fucking hell, Sam and Dean wanted to press their lips against Castiel’s mouth but instead, they whispered. “We love you mommy.”
Once the lack of pain became favorable, the Alpha turned off the water and carefully dried his hands, watching as the white towel soaked up the wet blood on his skin. With a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol, Dean began to clean his wounds, hissing every once in a while, when the rubbing alcohol managed to penetrate a deeper layer of exposed skin.
Castiel looked at the clock, the Omega knew that The Winchester Company was about thirty minutes away from their apartment.
, Dean wanted the Omega to see him as a worthy mate, flawed and fragmented, barely put together but dignified with nude honesty.
All three men brightened up like golden puppies playing with a bouncing ball. “We will take good care of you, Castiel. We have our own bus passes and a flower garden for you.”
Maggie shrugged. "I guess we'll stay here. Maybe one day we'll move. The future is—" she waved her hand in the air, "— unwritten."
“You go ask Castiel if he wants to leave or stay. I am with him, whatever he decides.” Dean briefly thought that maybe carving out his own lungs would be less painful than this.
"You're impossible," Castiel grumbled as his phone rang. He answered it quickly, glaring at Dean for good measure. "Yes?"
“Definitely. It’s always nice to see everyone again.” Claire smushed her face against Maggie’s stomach. “Mary looks like she’s due any day now.”
Dean dropped his own hand from the lid, falling back to brush gently against Castiel's stubble. "So who was right, all this time?"
"I understand that now. It helped me understand you, as well, and how your emotions claw their way out of you."
"Afraid not. Though, I would like to. It's just not something that can be discussed aloud. At least… not here."
Sam glanced at the table as his phone buzzed. "Oh, hey. Cas is calling." He put it on speaker absently, scrolling through more articles. "Cas."
It took a moment, but then Charlie was clapping and whooping, and Gabe and Rowena were hugging him tightly.
Michael let out a feral growl, more angel than human, and shoved Dean to the ground, scratching and biting.
Castiel took his hand back. It felt like it burned without Dean's skin against it. "I don't want them."
Had Dean been witness to all of this, he would have smiled and asked Sam where the sudden bonding time had come from, but the answer would have been simple:
"Michael's gotten to you. You know I'm not ashamed of you. I introduced you to Bobby, remember? I told him we could trust you. I'm not ashamed."
Dean's hands were on his back, trailing slowly ever-downward. "Castiel, I am dazed, right now. In a few minutes I'm likely gonna freak out over the fact that I led an entire other life I can't remember, a life where I
Dean nodded. “Good. Good.” He let out a shaky breath. “This feels too normal. Like we’re avoiding everything.”
"And I am an angel of the L—" Castiel cut himself off. No, not the Lord. "I'm an angel," he said, decisively.
She looked across the flower patch over to their vegetable garden, farther to the small pond they had made. Somewhere inside the Bunker, Donna was likely doing Claire's makeup against her will.
Sam took out his phone and opened his notes. "Maybe we can order some seeds for them, too? And then Maggie and Claire can plant them."
Castiel was silent for a while. “I once would have said that of course it was meant to happen. But to be entirely honest, I don’t know. Perhaps this was all merely chance, a random roll of the die.”
Okay so, you gotta understand. Sam was the dorkiest fucking kid you've ever seen. He carried around these big-ass books and he'd actually
"No." Sam let out a sigh. "He didn't tell anyone. Mom called saying he was acting strange and by the time I got there…" Sam trailed off. "I guess Cas figured it out."
But Dean, Mark, and I all sat in the bleachers and commented on the whole thing until I decided to get us all some punch.
Castiel pulled Dean up, kissed him in much the same way a fist kisses a soon-to-be-busted lip. He pushed and pulled until Dean’s legs met couch arm, until they fell onto the cushions, then rolled onto the floor. Castiel kissed his neck, his chest, his stomach, hands undoing button and zipper until there was only bare skin for mile after nautical mile.
"Yeah? Thought I was your sister. Thought Jack was your kid. Guess family really does end in blood, huh?"
Sam shook his head. "You didn't see her, back in your world. Monsters murdered almost her entire group, and she
Ya know, if I had a genie right now. Like, if the genie from Aladdin showed up right this second and asked me what I wanted? I'd say one last soccer game with Sammy.
Cas took a deep breath of water, releasing it in a huff. "I think Bobby Singer would've wound up as your step-dad. Your parents' marriage was rocky, to say the least. I do not doubt that they loved each other but... that love was not their own choice. It was made for them, before they were ever born, by higher powers. So to be fair in this assessment of your moral values or lack thereof, we have to go far back. Very far back. Before the apocalypse plans were even an idea."
There was a heavy noise, like Castiel had sat down, hard. “You’ve been here before,” Cas whispered. “Was it… Who was…”
Maggie didn't wear shoes. Neither did Claire. They went barefoot, dirt sticking to their feet as they walked between rows of dandelions. Claire wore jeans and Maggie wore shorts, both with tshirts stained from the time they had repainted their rooms.
There was a place in his chest that hurt, that ached every time he glanced at Dean, floating silently beside him.
Jack yawned. "This is Jack," he said, snuggling farther into his pillow, repositioning his wings over Sam.
She could hear his feet running down the hall and wished he was strong enough to fly. He rounded the corner quickly, coming to a halt inside the door.
Mary couldn't help but chuckle as the entire tower collapsed and someone shouted angrily from off-screen.
"Found it by luck, really. I was telling Matt that I used to fight a lot, and being stuck in a house now made me snippy and restless. So he showed me this." They rounded a corner, and before them was a giant fighting ring. Charlie shot Claire a grin. "Up for a round or two? Shake some aggression out?"
Sam muttered something that sounded a lot like, "Me neither" before standing up. "I'll see you soon, Dean. Oh, wait! Before I go, have you started reenacting old westerns yet? I have a bet to win."
When Dean could finally take in air again, he looked up through blurred eyes to see Sam, hair a mess and eyes red-rimmed.
Sam and Claire watched the moon rise sullenly over the horizon, casting strange reflections on the water's surface.
"And Sam didn't feel so lonely," Dean whispered, "because he knew he had family waiting for him. And James didn't worry, either, because he knew Sam was in good hands. And though they never saw each other again—" Dean's voice hitched and he cleared his throat, "they always, always remembered each other. The end."
Rowena rolled her eyes, deciding to go with plan B. “The Novak family has offered to pay each of you $28,000. Plus, you’ll be staying with them for a week so in total they’ll pay $392,000 just to have you both.”
Dean wanted Castiel to fuck him senselessly but in a matter of seconds, Castiel was basically running away, leaving Dean with a triumphant smile on his face.
To control his predatory impulse of going over to the Omega’s house and claiming him, Dean clawed at his window, baring his teeth while a deadly snarl escaped his lips. And
Dean couldn’t help the quiet chuckle escaping his lips, Donna really was sweet. “Thanks. Um, are we supposed to wait here or…”
soft tummy, the beautiful curve of his pec, the soft bump of a hardening nipple, and finally resting the palm of his hand against Castiel’s cheek.
After a quiet second of brotherly love, Gabriel shooed the Omega away. “Okay, get out of here with that sappy shit.”
Dean stood up straight, puffing out his chest and rumbling happily at pleasing the Omega, the Alpha patted himself on the back,
in the mere future when he was older and blinded by the gray lines that would eventually become black.
Times have changed; Omegas and Betas were on the rise of earning their respect from Alphas and being given the chance to do whatever they wanted without judgment. But although times have progressed; Omegas and Betas were susceptible to being seen as the vulnerable class. Betas were considered intolerant due to their inability of producing litters of pups.
to bury his enormous cock inside a tight crevice and popping an alarmingly huge knot that would filthily stretch the Omega’s rim, and the naked
Instead of kneeling and showing his respect to Crowley, Henry stood in front of thousands of demons, speaking his mind and dangerously opening the door to independence from the crown. Henry revoked the idea of fidelity towards the king, why should they be loyal to only one Alpha when they could be loyal to themselves?
and ready to mingle. You’re my responsibility and I’m not going tolerate some asshole bothering you.”
Dean eyed Castiel, the Alpha frowned before coming to a decision and bearing his neck to the Omega. Yes, scenting was an intimate display of affection, a submission for either partner to inhale the unique fragrance produced to attract a bonding mate. It was a turning point that always ended in the consummation of a life long marriage.
, the Alpha looked down at himself and as expected, his cock was hard and heavy, greedily pushing against the fabric of his pajama bottoms and seeking the tight embrace of the Omega’s delicious heat.
Dean should have worn his dark blue jeans that accentuated his sweet ass and thick thighs along with a long-sleeved black shirt that hugged his shoulders and biceps quite nicely, the fabric molding over his muscles and making the blue-eyed Omega blush like the gorgeous rose he was at the attractive qualities that a true potent Alpha like himself possessed.
After what seemed like forever, Dean stopped and snarled vehemently at everyone watching, preening at the fear everyone had towards him and to remind everyone of their place, the Alpha released a bestial sound. The sound ripping from Dean’s throat was barbarous and authoritative, every rogue demon came to their knees and lowered their heads.
Castiel dragged his tongue over the Alpha’s mouth, closing his eyes and stopping the swirl of his hips. “
Dean could already feel the embedded strength in Castiel’s muscles used against him, pinning Dean’s slutty ass to the bed and devouring him alive.
Castiel took one of the strong hands branding into his hips, coaxing it over his stomach. The Alpha snarled salaciously as he felt the Omega guiding his hand over Castiel’s
the Omega with touch of his hands and the penetration of his cock. Castiel moaned against Dean, burrowing himself deeper into the Alpha’s scent gland and
Sapphire flames of moonstone jewels glimmered underneath the sun, azure sprinkles of ocean mist shimmered angelically, and cerulean blooms of flowers that should only flourish for Dean were opening with plushy petals, inviting the Alpha in. And
The dark color of the Omega’s briefs contrasted beautifully with the Omega’s pasty skin; Dean was a 100% sure that god crafted this Omega solely for Dean.
The doctor began to pull Dean away but this time, the little Alpha snarled so loudly that even the nurses were shaken by the sound and before Dean could do anything else, there was a soft voice speaking to him. “
Due to Sam’s dark childhood, the younger Alpha lived by three rules: 1) opinions concerning Omegas deserving better were kept to himself, 2) never speak unless it was demanded of him to contribute to a conversation, and 3) painfully agreeing with every rogue demon when it came to insulting Omegas. Personally, Sam wanted to tell every rogue demon to go fuck themselves.
Piece by piece, the Alpha dismantled the wooden fence, breaking boards of wood until there was nothing left but splinters. After what seemed like hours, Dean’s anger began to falter and once again, the Alpha was faced with the consequences of his own anger. Dean looked down at his hands and with an unbelievable hatred bubbling at the surface of his mind, the Alpha kicked aside the broken pieces of wood and entered his house, slamming the door right behind him.
And now being exposed to such affection was passionately getting the Alpha going, Dean was pushing himself further into the Omega’s hand, burying himself like the way a lion nudges softly into their mate’s cheek. Dean
It's not that Dean and Cas had never touched before, obviously, they're best friends and have been for years, but it's the fact that Dean has also been pining over Cas almost the whole time. And despite his best efforts, Cas never fails to make warmth blossom in Dean's chest.
Talking about Cas made Dean's chest feel so suddenly hollow. Why was that? He's happy, isn't he? Sure, he has his impala, his brother, his family, everyone. Well... everyone but Cas...
While Dean did have a spare key (even if it wasn't entirely legal for them to give him one), he knew they normally left the door unlocked when they expected company within an hour or so, so Dean walked right in.
Charlie had just pulled up Smash when Jo sat in the bungee chair next to the couch and Cas came in from Jo's bathroom, looking down at his phone with a frown.
What is he forgetting? He already put on his one pair of boots, doubled socked up underneath, as well as a shirt, sweater, coat, and scarf, and this was all just to keep warm in his dorm room. He used to love the giant window on the one wall as Dean lives off of sunlight (and so do all the plants Cas has gotten him over the years), but right now cold is radiating from that side of the room and with the whole university losing power there was nothing Dean could do about it.
to covet Castiel like he was the holy grail, hiding him away from those who didn’t deserve to lay their eyes upon the Omega. The two Alphas inhaled deeply, greedily drinking down the Omega’s essence, instantly feeling their pupils dilating with lustful eagerness.
. There were emerald specks that melted into jade swirls with golden pulses that surrounded the Alpha’s pupils, a true exit that allowed the Omega to leave this shit world and enter the thriving forests that bled of green richness.
You see, from a young age, Sam and Dean were left as orphans. Clearly not their preferred choice but their parents, John and Mary Winchester, died in a fire, leaving the boys with no other option but to grow up quickly. Innocence of a child was stripped from their bones as the search for food and shelter became their main problem.
Castiel threw his head back against the wall, the grip on his face failing to loosen while the scent of his slick moistened through his briefs, traveling up to Sam’s nose. Sam leaned in closer, inhaling Castiel’s virginal slick and growling against the Omega’s cheek. The Alpha loosened his grip on Castiel’s face, just a bit, and dragged his tongue across the Omega’s cheek, purposely licking the corner of Castiel’s mouth.
Castiel quickly tended to everyone, receiving happy smiles from sweet Omegas and speechless welcomes from love sick Alphas who adored Castiel more than their own life.
And on top of that, this bar was gushing with dark, heavy, and earthy fragrances. Rogue demons, especially Alphas and Omegas, were known to have musky scents. The heavy cloud of thick aromas mixed with obscene pheromones was overpowering.
The Alpha approached the cabinet beneath the sink, taking out the first aid kit and turning on the faucet, listening to the water hitting the sink for a few seconds before placing his hands underneath the running water. Instantly, when the water hit his skin, Dean snarled lethally, grinding his teeth together and emitting a rumble of dreadfully scary sounds vibrating through his chest.
Even Jack could see how wrong that sounded but the Omega responded back in kindness. “That’s very nice of you to offer, Dean but I think its better if its just me and Castiel. Besides, I don’t think you like shopping and I don’t want it to be awkward for all three of us. I mean, two Omegas and one Alpha aren’t exactly safety numbers. Not that I’m saying that I don’t trust you, but you do understand.”
The Alpha’s bedroom was completely dark except for the stream of light coming from his window. Dean sighed and went towards the window, closing the curtains when he caught a glimpse of the Omega next door.
On the other side of the pool, on the upper level, there were five beach chairs perfectly lined together with another set of lounging chairs and a marble table. There was a wide driveway that led to the front of the pool, where Sam and Dean could see expensive looking cars residing with one another under the morning sun.
The Alpha didn’t want to do this, but he needed to sleep. At least for a little while, perhaps that would clear away the cobwebs holding the memory of the Omega being abused and him, the helpless fool, doing nothing except watching. Slowly, very slowly, Dean let the heaviness of his eyelids fall down, closing his eyes and blocking the view of his room.
Well, this town was very odd. Since the Omega arrived here, there’s been two people who wanted to be his best friend, Garth and Jack. Why did they want to be his best friend? Castiel didn’t know. And besides, what was it with Castiel attracting other Omegas that were
Dean and Castiel arrived at the repair shop, the Alpha promptly exiting his Baby and opening the door for the Omega, like the gentleman he was. Castiel shyly thanked Dean, waiting for the Alpha to lead the way. Though Dean couldn’t help the slight bounce in his step, due to the noble gesture he performed by respecting the Omega, it was obvious that Castiel was blushing like crazy, mirroring the color of a bright red strawberry.
Dean reached for the doorknob. “Going to make my introductions to the asshole who thinks he has the right to slap Cas’ ass.”
Fuck making deals and taking souls for Crowley’s benefit, demons had enough power to take as many souls as they coveted without the consent of humans.
“I’m going to make you mine.” The Alpha scarily replied, his voice thick with lust and deeper than dark chocolate.
Castiel waved a small goodbye to the Omega, unable to resist the tremendous smile on his face as he caught up to Dean. “He’s very… exuberant.”
Sam felt himself going weak at the sight before him, the Omega was so cute and it was outright illegal.
Dean lifted his hands in the air, proving that he meant no harm. “I’m not gonna hurt you, Cas. I wouldn’t dream of it. I just — let me help you however way I can. I actually work at a repair shop and we’re always getting cuts and wounds on our hands, we’re usually always ready with the first aid kit. Come with me. It’s not that far, I swear.”
The only person with the right and will to scent a mated Omega was their mate. Mated Alphas coveted their mate’s scent, making the process of scenting their Omega more secretive and undisclosed to others. This was Castiel’s case, because the only one to scent the Omega was Lucifer, claiming and mating Castiel gave Lucifer the fucking right to covet the Omega’s fragrance.
Rufus exhaled happily and snapped his fingers to get John’s attention. “You like Castiel, don’t you?”
Then of course, the Alpha felt like an idiot whenever the Omega caught him looking, mostly reducing himself to swallowing his pride and giving an innocent smile, not wanting Castiel to think that he was a serial killer or anything stupid like that. Dean proceeded to disinfecting the large cut on the Omega’s lips, soaking up a new cotton ball and dabbing it against the wound.
Returning to their prior stance, standing before one another, Dean couldn’t help but notice how much smaller the Omega was in height and well, in everything. It stroked the Alpha’s ego to know that he was taller than Castiel by a few inches, and it was totally impossible to not imagine how cute they’d be as a couple.
And there it was again, the scent of fear permeating the air. Dean loved that scent; pheromones of fear were making Castiel more beautiful by the second. Dean’s black eyes were becoming darker by the second, the Alpha came closer to Castiel, inches away from tasting those plump and juicy lips —
The rest of the day at the repair shop was worn with a stupid smile on Dean’s super happy face, well, what the hell could he say, he was in a
The small Alpha jumped onto the bed and gently began to shake his mother, caressing Castiel’s face and nuzzling his nose into the crook of his mother’s neck. “Is the baby, okay?”
Castiel couldn’t help but admit that the Omega boy was really sweet. “Oh, that’s not necessary. You don’t have to help me carry this. I’m sure you’re tired and you’d rather go home.”
At some point, John stopped caring whether his boys found a mate or not. Besides, there were more important things at hand. Today there was a meeting being held in John’s office; Mr Benny Lafitte (head of the marketing department), Mr Bobby Singer (head of the finance department), Mr Crowley (head of the operation management department), Mr Gabriel Novak (head of the human resource department), and lastly, Mr Kevin Tran (head of the IT department) were present.
Gabriel saw nothing but red as he faced Lucifer, the diner becoming intoxicated with lethal pheromones reeking with rage and murder. “Boys, step away this piece of shit and keep your mom company.”
How was it possible that Castiel smelled so wonderful? How the heck was it possible that Lucifer was so fucking lucky to smell the Omega everyday and not treasure him like the angel he was? Dean couldn’t understand it for the life of him but even so, many Alphas got turned off when smelling a mated Omega because their scent was surprise surprise,
The rising numbers of black-eyed demons grew unimaginably, the twisted creations of hell only responded to Crowley and no way in hellfire, was that ever going to change.
Dean leaned forward, rubbing at his temples. “Sammy, this is the world we live in, okay? Yeah, it sucks for Omegas but what can we do. Dad’s running this show, not us. If he wants Omegas working here at a low pay grade and at a lower rank than Alphas and Betas. Then who are we to contradict him? He’s our dad but also our boss. Come on Sammy, being a softie won’t change anything.”
Dean stared down at the baby who was holding out his hands adorably, gurgling and smiling at wanting to touch his mother’s face. “How about Samuel?”
Dean couldn’t stand himself anymore, it was making him sick. The Alpha couldn’t hold back much longer, Dean needed to let out his anger one more time and so, the Alpha shouted again. This time, the sound was sad, tormented, and brokenly injured. But yelling wasn’t enough, not nearly enough, so Dean began to punch the wooden fence surrounding his home.
With the hunger of a starved man and the gentleness of an Alpha making sweet love to their Omega, Dean dove into the crook of the Omega’s neck. As soon as the Alpha pressed his nose against Castiel’s scent gland, Dean could feel the barriers withholding his sense of control breaking down to rubble. The Alpha snarled recklessly, scarily rushing into the Omega and tightening his hold on Castiel.
Dean learned to hide the self hatred that poisoned him every morning when he came face to face with himself in the mirror by sleeping with countless Omegas who were willing to let themselves go, and let the Alpha use them for his own pleasure. And Dean certainly buried behind the ruthless nature of wanting to break everything with his hands by working at a repair shop, putting the use of his hands that were definitely capable of destruction and using them to restore important pieces that were easily replaceable.
The Omega forced himself to not cry, not now. Castiel looked up at the house next door when the most gorgeous and handsomest Alpha stepped across the threshold. Time froze, the orbital spin of the earth came to a halt, every knowledge inside the Omega’s head was erased, and the unfamiliar feeling of
But now, it was time for Sam to go, the two Alphas were walking out of Dean’s house, the older Alpha wrapping his arm around Sam’s broad shoulders. “Oh Sammy,
The humming of furry bees landing on purple lilacs was the sweetest sound vibrating through Dean’s chest; the dense velvety petals that encompassed a raging red rose was soft against the Alpha’s mouth, Dean could almost taste the fragrance of recently bloomed roses that were desperately searching the touch of their true mate.
Dean snorted in disbelief. “Sam. There’s a sweet, beautiful, fucking angel-like Omega in there who’s in an abusive relationship with a butt ugly Alpha who doesn’t even have the right mind set to treat that Omega like he’s royalty. If you think I’m gonna stand here and look pretty while that…
After two strokes, the Omega came with a shattering scream on his lips. Castiel tightened his grip on Dean, digging his nails into the Alpha’s skin and trembling uncontrollably when spurts of cum landed against his chest and on the bedsheets.
Dean snorted, rubbing the palm of his hands against the side of his thighs. “Right. Castiel, that’s a very… uniquely beautiful name.”
Lucifer smiled darkly. “Haven’t you heard, the king gets bored and he needs new toys. So, I was going to trick Castiel into selling his soul and making him Crowley’s whore.”
Before Sam and Dean could beat the shit out of each other, Castiel cleared his throat. “Well, Mr Winchesters, thank you both for the
close to attacking them. Like a predator does to their prey. Natural and instinctive, on a scale that favored the scarier side.
Rule number two: whatever share earned by every rent boy was to be given to Crowley, except he only asked for half of their share. The other half belonged to his rent boys and they could use the money however they wanted. Rule number three: every rent boy had the choice of choosing their own suitors.
Castiel tightly wrapped his arms around his stomach, forcing himself to not vomit at the heady scent crawling through his nostrils as he watched Lucifer enter their new house. Once the Alpha disappeared inside, the Omega tiredly slumped back into his seat and breathed through his mouth, avoiding the casual cycle of breathing through his nose.
Rufus sent Castiel a flirtatious wink. “Well, don’t worry your pretty little face. We’re here now, baby doll.”
for him. He had to be; he will be. The Alpha just knew it. Castiel’s willowy hands slowly traveled upwards, his fingertips ghosting over Dean’s neck. The Alpha growled softly when the Omega rested the palm of his hand against Dean’s cheek, caressing it with a tenderness that the Alpha never knew existed.
Castiel whimpered in pain, his fragile body trembling as Lucifer growled against his ear, a deadly sound that made the Omega quiver in fear. “Did I ask you to talk, baby cakes?”
The Omega was shaking, the intrusion of another Alpha made Castiel uncomfortable and nervous for all the wrong reasons, this only made Dean snarl with great annoyance.
The Omega smiled softly, holding the flowers against his chest. “I’m Castiel. Novak. The Omega who lives next to you.”
Castiel bit the inside of his cheek, making himself as small as possible when Lucifer pulled him forward, forcing the Omega to look into his eyes. “
That dark, cold, and asphyxiating place was the constant reminder of how much the Omega would give anything to leave the Alpha. The way Lucifer treated him was horrible but as pathetic as this may sound, even to Castiel’s ears, he couldn’t leave the Alpha. Since the age of 13, the Omega has known nothing of the world except Lucifer.
Yet that wasn’t enough, whenever the Alpha moved, the office lights provided the sight of smooth waves colored in dark umber highlights, glittering with soft hints of maple honey strands that made Castiel want to rake his fingers through Dean’s hair, feeling the Alpha intimately. And of course, the Omega couldn’t keep away from staring into Dean’s intensely green eyes.
John sighed in irritation, a snarl escaping his lips. “We’re providing a job, a well-paid job, isn’t that enough? Besides, we must maintain our reputation with a high level of respect to other companies who have inspired us to adapt into new ways of running our own company.”
That was the Alpha’s chance to kiss Castiel, Dean could have simply captured the Omega’s lips in a swift turn but
Castiel walked away from the vegetable section and headed towards the meat section, perhaps to avoid Lucifer in general, he could feed the Alpha his favorite food. Lucifer was a huge steak fan and usually when the Omega fed him his favorite treats, the Alpha left Castiel alone. And if anything, the Omega didn’t want to deal with Lucifer’s abuse tonight.
Henry — the one responsible for hell’s downfall — rebelled against Crowley, the first and foremost famous act of mutiny known through the books concerning hell’s entire history. Demons, angels, and monsters of all kind, knew of Henry’s unspeakable betrayal to the Alpha king of hell.
“Yeah, yeah. Go enamor some Alphas but Castiel, if anyone tries to harass you, let me know and I’ll burn their eyes out.”
As if being burnt by red hot flames, the Omega pulled away sharply. The loss of Castiel’s touch snapped Dean’s eyes open, an unhappy growl escaping his lips due to their little bubble of happiness bursting rudely without the Alpha’s permission.
Sam and Dean Winchester were inside a vehicle pertaining to the Novak family, it was said that the Novak family was wealthy beyond belief. The Novak family was known for having powerful connections with people of authority, then again, investing their time and money in bonds and becoming stock brokers led to no other expectations except breeding affluent gentlemen who were bathed in riches.
it was long and sleek, barely kissing the Alpha’s neck. Sam’s hair was an array of colors; the Omega could easily lose count of how many colors he could spot, for starters, Castiel could see the light streaks of brown weaving through each strand, flutters of a soft hazelnut hue that bounced against the light, scattering rays of chestnut tones that vibrated with passion, and slivers of auburn patches that glowed in defiance.
Gabriel reached forward and ruffled Dean and Sam’s hair. “Good job in defending your mom, you hairless rascals. I’m very proud of both of you.”
Garth ended the call, facing Castiel with pure excitement. “Dude, what are you doing? Just get dressed!”
Sam rolled his eyes, emptying a cup of pencils onto the floor and throwing the cup at the back of Dean’s head. “Can you stop relating everything to sex?”
Castiel was in the hospital, screaming and crying as he was giving birth to his second child. After that night in the Impala with John Winchester, it was evident that the Alpha wanted to be with the Omega for all eternity. So, as a result, John and Castiel got married early in the morning before the Alpha had to leave.
The Alpha moved in the direction of the sun and the bright light illuminated the Alpha’s iris’. All the Omega could see was green.
For without loyal followers and humble subjects, Crowley’s title of being king meant nothing. So, Crowley was credited with the variety of dangerous creatures that represented the satanic gates of hell. Vulnerable human souls shining in pure starlight were the missing ingredients to creating the damned in hell; hosts were seductively tricked into selling their souls to Crowley, allowing the Alpha king to lock those innocent souls behind bars, rotting away in the dungeons of obscurity.
Bobby stuck out his hand to shake Castiel’s, a sinful charm that made the older Alpha irresistible was spilling by the bottle. “I never knew Dean had such lovely neighbors like yourself. You’re very pretty.”
It was too much for him, the Alpha could feel the stinging wave of fuming tears threatening to spill down his cheeks but Dean would not cry; not because he was trying to remain manly and indestructible — even though that was partially the main reason — but because that wasn’t him. For too long, the Alpha believed that he was born from the threads of anger, annihilation, and self loathing.
better than that. Besides, this wasn’t about him, it was about the Omega next door, the Omega that was clearly destined to be with him. With a resigned sigh dripping from his lips, the Alpha pushed himself away from the window, facing the clock one more time and
“Trust me, Sammy. I’ll become the Omega’s protector even if I have to sell my soul to the devil himself.”
Castiel sniffled a couple of times, looking through his pockets to wipe away the mess of tears that left behind white streaks against his puffy red cheeks, when suddenly a box of tissues appeared before him. The Omega looked up and saw a tall, handsome, and very
fucking close to losing themselves in the culmination of the magnetic force that kept driving Castiel and Dean towards one another.
Gabriel smiled widely, pleased with himself at already securing this position for his little brother. “I’m on it, boss.”
John stood to his full height, towering over Castiel and gazing down at the Omega’s lips. “I want you. I couldn’t stop thinking about you the whole day. Even though you’re right here in front of me, I can’t get enough of you.”
Thrown over desk drawer: placed back into original position with clothes folded into their prior designation. Check.
— going by the name tag clipped against his uniform — gave a gentle smile to the Omega. “Here ya go, sugar. Wipe away those tears and drink some water.”
The Omega’s scent kept getting lighter by the wave, never had the Alpha encountered such a rare perfume of sweetness. The scarcity of such a scent was meant to be locked away in a safe place, like pixie dust sealed in a bottle. And lastly, as if to leave Dean in a fit of sexual frustration, the Alpha picked up the tiny traces of cherry blossoms opening at the sight of spring.
“And what’s not fair about giving Omegas a job that’s gonna be easy peasy for them. Push a button and you’re good. No education required. And plus, if we got hottie Omegas running the elevators, best believe I’m gonna bang all of them.”
he reached his mate. The scent of the Omega amplified to a higher degree, making Dean dizzy with the Omega’s virginal pheromones.
Sam’s scent was finally being revealed. It was completely different from Dean’s because the older Alpha radiated a scent that was a mixture of the most sinful element known to earth: fire. Dean’s scent was destructive, fatal, and chronically irresistible.
Castiel bit his lower lip, slithering closer to Dean as if he were snake ready to hypnotize his victim. “Are you proposing something to me, Dean?”
“I also left you a catalogued and alphabetized file concerning the other stores we might do business with. I also included their price differences, to make it easier for us to see if we should reach out and do new business with the store of our choice. And our employees are never better, everyone is happy in their position and their monthly pay is satisfying but you need to remember that our yearly evaluation is coming up. And everyone is anxious for a raise but that’s up to you.”
Chuck smacked the palm of his hand against his forehead. “Right! Sorry. I have four sons. Michael is my first born, after him its Lucifer and after Lucifer it’s Gabriel and the youngest is Castiel. It’s five of us, well six including Donna.”
Ever since Dean’s shitty behavior towards Castiel, the Alpha has been trying find the Omega for almost three hours. “Hey, Jack. Was that Cas you were walking with?”
Once the Omega checked himself in the mirror, Castiel turned to face his beautiful ass — mind you, the best ass in all of Kansas — the Omega gave a seductive wink to his reflection and went towards the front of the diner with a smile on his face. Like clock work, their boss was entering the parking lot when everyone took their positions.
Rufus threw the dirty rag towards Dean’s face, pushing past Dean and going for the Omega’s hand to plant a sweet kiss against Castiel’s knuckles. “Is it just me or am I in the presence of a goddess?”
Castiel had to admit that these old men were adorable; they all wore thickly rimmed glasses, fun but nicely pressed suits, and cute bow ties.
Castiel was the cutest angel Dean has ever known. “Cas, you’re literally blowing my mind. I fucking love pie. Like
Dean was about to interrupt Castiel when the Omega snarled wrathfully, pointing an accusatory finger at the Alpha. “You have no idea who I am so don’t you
he wondered how far he could make that blush go. “Well, this bar is crawling with rogue demons. You’re here early and your date is probably running late and if that douchebag is as dumb as I think he is, he wouldn’t have left you here all alone with us rogue demons.”
Sam and Dean were co-presidents, sharing equal power amongst each other. Having multiple co-presidents wasn’t rare, in fact, it assured the Winchester legacy. When and if, John Winchester dies, the presidency will be left to Sam and Dean Winchester. Both would run the company equally; Sam would handle the finances related to the company.
Running seemed to last for a lifetime when in actuality, Castiel ran for eleven minutes before ending up at the supermarket, specifically in the vegetable section. The Omega was haunted by the sickening words that rang through his head, all the insults that Dean used to hurt him were like opening past wounds that never fully healed but then again, how could they?
Castiel could bake like nobody’s business. The Alpha didn’t realize that he closed his eyes because a moment later, his eyes were opening up to the sight of the Omega blushing harder than a red rose blooming during its season. Castiel was so fucking sexy, it was unbelievable how pretty he was and something inside of Dean’s chest began to tighten up.
The Omega looked down at Dean’s hands, slowing turning them over so that Castiel’s fingertips were brushing against the palm of Dean’s hands. The Omega calmly wrapped his slender fingers around the Alpha’s wrists, gently caressing the skin there with the stroke of his thumb.
Without knowing it, everything was about to fall apart, like twigs snapping into pieces, the Alpha’s patience had finally come to an end. It was something that Dean couldn’t control, yet it was the perfect invitation of letting his Alpha instincts change him into something he never wanted to be. The word
pretty and it felt wrong leaving the Omega alone with that monster, Sam could stay over one more night but school was about to start in a couple days and he needed time to refresh his memory on the material that would be taught again in this semester.
Up ahead, the Alpha could spot Garth — an Omega — at the front desk, talking to someone on the phone and hanging up afterwards. Garth was the only Omega in the repair shop, responsible of charging the customers and keeping the register safe. Garth was busy writing down something when the Omega looked up abruptly, knowing the familiar scent of Dean and smiling at the Alpha.
Again, their expectations of entering a hellhole filled with dirty whores were immediately revoked; all the rent boys were dressed
The older Alpha was about to continue reprimanding Dean when his eyes landed on the ravishing Omega. “
The Omega couldn’t help but chuckle sweetly at the sight of the Alpha stumbling on his own words. “John. I’m gonna be straight with you. I like men who tell me what they want. Cut the cute shit. What do you really wanna ask me?”
the Alpha couldn’t stand how sexy and intimate this was, the display of affection coming from Castiel was making Dean territorial, protective, possessive, and uncontrollably aroused.
Rufus leaned forward, grabbing John’s chin and forcing the Alpha to look him in the eyes. “Listen boy, you can go after him but here’s the thing, we love that Omega. He’s basically family and we would go to hell and back for him. He’s the only sexy angel we have in our lives so if you break his heart —“
the Alpha couldn’t take his eyes off the blossoming pink color that spread from Castiel’s ears, to his cheeks, and
Dean tried to kick away his little brother when Sam managed to crawl on top of the Alpha, they were slowly inching towards the elevator and making a huge spectacle of it with heavy grunts and lame punches directed to one another. Sam managed to pin Dean down, using his entire weight to keep the Alpha in place.
It was insanely delicious, the Alpha could almost taste it on his tongue, his senses were flooded with unspoiled sweetness and with every gulp of the Omega’s addictive aroma, Dean tightened his grip on Castiel’s dainty wrist, letting the Omega know that he wasn’t going anywhere until the Alpha tasted him properly.
The bartender was pouring a drink for a small figure, a submissive figure. Dean froze at the sight; the Alpha closed his eyes and took a deep breath in the direction of the person with the beige colored trench coat. Dean snarled salaciously, the divine creature sitting there was responsible for the Alpha’s undoing.
Sam and Dean looked up at their mother, both of their faces were flushed as they began to smother Castiel with wet and needy kisses. They were both touched starved, they needed to feel the Omega against them and they wanted to be with Castiel so badly that their Alpha instincts were roaring with desperation.
Lucifer constantly degraded Castiel’s existence and for a time, the Omega was used it but never did the pain lessen while verbally being abused and now, another Alpha has reduced Castiel into a meager speck of dust. The Omega couldn’t help but tearfully breakdown again; Castiel was so tired of being mistreated, insulted, and being pushed around like a defenseless butterfly surrounded by spiders.
“You have no idea what I’ve been through; you don’t know about my past, my present, and you certainly won’t know my future. You think I’m a slut? A whore? A cock sucking bitch? Gosh, when did I get the honor of getting so many titles? And what about you? Aren’t you wearing a human mask as well? Putting on an entire show of presenting yourself as a charming, irresistible, and sweet person when in reality, you’re just like every other Alpha, a heartless bully.”
Dean smirked while enduring the same struggle of seeing past the afternoon sun, the Alpha’s vision picked up the outline of a person — no, a man. Dean’s eyes adjusted against the sun when the sight of an angel appeared before him.
And of course, Castiel noticed the slight stubble decorating Dean’s jaw, chin, and upper lip. The Omega could only imagine the delicious burn he’d feel when the Alpha kissed him or when Dean kissed his way to the Omega’s inner thighs. Castiel bit his lower lip, already feeling his cock hardening at the thought, his smaller length pushing painfully against his briefs.
The Alpha didn’t even manage to take one step forward when suddenly Jack was standing before him, apparently stopping Dean by pressing the palm of his hands against the Alpha’s large chest. “Dean, what are you doing?”
Every slut and whore took the challenge of winning the Alpha’s heart and eventually becoming Dean Winchester’s future mate. Of course, Dean knew that one day he would be mated to someone of his choosing, not some gold digging or money hungry bitch who was simply looking for their fifteen minutes of fame.
Castiel whimpered when the Alpha was on top of him, without warning, Dean shoved his slick coated fingers into the Omega’s mouth. Castiel had no other choice but to take the four fingers stuffed down his throat, moaning at the taste of his own slick and feeling salvia cascading down his mouth. The Alpha was breathing loudly, shutting his eyes closed and loving the feeling of the Omega sucking on his fingers.
Castiel was Sam’s little island of paradise, a place where the Alpha wanted to stay forevermore and consume every bit of the Omega until Castiel couldn’t think of anything else except for Sam. A place where the Omega was the water and Sam was the sand, a relationship that could never be broken for the ocean couldn’t survive without its sandy banks.
Gabriel smugly walked towards his employees, eyeing the diner and smirking at the cleanliness shimmering everywhere.
Already, it’s been two times that Dean has failed to dress attractively to catch Castiel’s eye, not that he was dressing up badly on purpose, but mostly because he never knew what to wear since the Omega unexpectedly showed up as his next-door neighbor. The Alpha was heavily considering an apology, begging Castiel to forgive him for being a dumbass who never figured out the perfect outfit that could sweep the Omega off his feet.
The thought of the Omega’s lips becoming swollen due to Dean’s heated and desperate kisses was becoming too much for the Alpha to bear.
At the mention of porn, Sammy turned to face his older brother with disbelief and pure amazement at how stupid Dean was. “What? Are you seriously talking about porn and banging an Omega worker?”
Castiel was already down the steps, sobbing uncontrollably, hiccuping loudly, and pushing himself to get away from this dreadful house along with its dreadful owner. The Omega couldn’t go back home,
Dean let out a guttural growl, his lips pulled back into a snarl. “And who the hell dismissed you from this conversation?”
The Alpha crushed his lips against the Omega’s, mixing the taste of blood and salvia while pushing his tongue further into Castiel’s mouth, marking the Omega as his.
Chuck smirked at the faint blush coloring Sam’s cheeks. “Donna, can you find Gabriel and tell him that his birthday presents are here.”
The Alpha couldn’t help the obvious palpitating pink hearts bursting through his eyes, Castiel was a wonder and
But Lucifer kept the leather collar in between his fingers, winking at the Omega in a playful way. “Good. The next time you talk out of turn or talk without my permission, I’ll do more than just hurt you. Got it, Cassie.”
the Alpha didn’t know what to do besides gape at Castiel with his mouth hanging open, looking like a complete dingus. “
With a soft gasp escaping Dean’s lips, Castiel came even closer, tracing his thumb over Dean’s voluptuous lips, gripping Dean’s chin with a deadly force and growling out. “What else don’t you mind begging for?”
Castiel felt his pupils dilating at the sight of Dean’s black eyes swallowing his green iris’, fear was rolling off the Omega in heavy waves. Castiel wanted the Alpha to ruin him completely. The Omega timidly reached forward, placing both hands against the Alpha’s broad chest. Castiel seductively palmed at Dean’s pecs, loving the hardness of chiseled muscles underneath his touch.
Dean shrugged, rolling his eyes at the sight of Sam skipping two steps at a time and finding himself with Donna who kindly directed Sam to Gabriel’s room. “No hard feelings. Besides, I’ve heard that there are other players who might want to have fun with me.”
Of course, when the doctors came to get Castiel, Dean was separated from his mother. The little boy argued with his mother’s doctor; the little Alpha explained that he needed to be with his mother and the idea of leaving his sweet mommy alone to give birth was horrifying. Of course, Dean was given a warning and if the little boy couldn’t restrain himself, he’d be taken away and locked in a room until his baby brother was born.
’ shape while Dean took the opportunity to consume the Omega’s wet mouth. With trembling lips, Castiel kissed the Alpha in return when Dean thrusted his hips in a certain way and made the Omega scream.
A loud voice was ringing through the Alpha’s skull, it was instinctive and predatory. That only pushed Dean to bear the horrible pain in his mouth, his canines sharpening as they made their appearance. The Alpha’s mouth was bleeding, the tang of copper along with copious amounts of saliva were making Dean even more thirsty to rip into Castiel’s scent gland, marring the skin into an engraved claiming mark.
Well, it wasn’t his fault that he wanted to spoon the Omega from behind, take Castiel into the security of his large arms and languidly trace the outline of the Omega’s mouth with his tongue. Kissing Castiel with a fierce yet tender passion, hearing the soft sounds escaping the Omega’s mouth and the Alpha, recklessly trying to keep Castiel by his side.
And it took the Alpha a second to realize that the Omega had finally healed; the bruises coloring his eyes and cheeks had vanished, the cuts against his temple and lips were barely noticeable, traces of dried blood were nowhere to be seen. Castiel looked, well, he looked so
The Alpha’s cheekily bright grin was infectious, for the Omega couldn’t help but smile as well, though the Omega winced in pain at the stretch of his torn lips. “Thank you.”
“Happy for you two,” Sam said, grinning wide. “I mean, if you had kept your head up your ass for any longer I’d have had to call the hospital.”
Raphael inclined her head. “Thank you. You are always welcome to voice your concerns.” She turned back to Naomi. “And you? Are you willing to stand beside us?”
Maggie broke into a fit of laughter, which she quickly silenced. She grabbed a hat from somewhere off-screen and used the phone to aim, throwing it at the tower like a ring toss.
It is intrinsic to the universe. It ebbs and flows like water, not in any one direction but in all at once. It was likely here before any sort of extant life existed.”
Castiel mulled it over. “As romantic as it would be to point out that, since the world reuses so much organic material, every human has lived entire other lifetimes… I think the answer is no. We found each other here and now, against all odds. This lifetime is all we have.”
I was a careless child. I did not watch where I stepped. I rarely looked down at all. My head was held high, always turned towards my creator.
"Donna's kitchen," she said softly. Sam's hand faltered on cracking an egg before she continued. "He was making breakfast for us, and he flipped the pancake like this. And I told him he was a show-off, so he did that stupid grin and asked me if I wanted to learn how. I said yeah."
Sam looked around for Castiel, finally spotting him beside Claire and Maggie, engrossed in the adorableness of baby Sam. “You’ve been staring at me all afternoon.” Sam said, turning to Dean.
Dean laughed loudly, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s perfect form. “And here I was, thinking I couldn’t fall in love with you all over again.”
The foot soldier nodded his head in acceptance of this. “I merely did not wish to lie,” he said. “I am worried. I am willing to see what happens, though. I sincerely wish you do prove me wrong.”
was I always there?!” Castiel placed many heads in many hands, wings turning sharp and razor-like. “I don’t understand! He should remember Lisa! He should remember being a demon! Those weren’t me! I wasn’t
“Um, just go full abstract. Don’t try and paint real things. Paint colors, or feelings, or something like that.”
"I miss here. It was my home for a long time." Cas took a sip of his drink, and Dean wondered which lifetime he had so fucked up in that he wasn't reincarnated as the glass against Castiel's lips. "I'm visiting old friends."
Dean still got butterflies when Cas touched his hand, when their fingers brushed against each other. Dean still held his breath when Cas was speaking softly, afraid to miss even a letter. He still blushed when Cas played with his hair, when Cas smoothed down his shirt, when Cas let him fall asleep tangled up with him.
Gabriel pinched the bridge of his own nose. “Jesus Christ,” he muttered. “You’re Sam’s kid. Goddamn.” He looked up at the sky. “Doesn’t a single one of you understand that it’s
I thought we could handle it, but the kitchen incident just proves that we can't. Claire got hurt. Like,
There, bathed in blue light, was this being he had spent the last however-long talking to and arguing with.
No matter how he moved, or discreetly rubbed at his cheek (he was very sure this demon could see in the dark), he couldn’t get the feeling to go away. The feeling of Castiel’s hand against his face, so soft, so loving. It had been so long since anyone had touched him for anything other than pain that… well. Dean couldn’t let go.
Gabe couldn’t stop his snort. “Bribing me, huh? With a single cupcake? I’ll have you know I won’t be bought so easily.”
He laughed, and it was breathy and glorious as tears fled his eyes. “Castiel,” he whispered, hands going out to touch his face.
Claire wanted to ask why Dean would do that. She wanted to ask why he didn't want to see any of them, why he kept it all a secret, why he wouldn't let them help. She wanted to ask if Sam screamed and cried and drove over the speed limit until he got to the dock, only to find Dean already gone.
Dean's laughter subsided into the occasional giggle. "Nah, babe. You've gotta use slang words. All formal like that is just kinda weird. Like you learned pillow talk from a bad fanfiction."
I remember when Mom brought you home. I was so worried, and then I saw you. You were perfect. Just this little baby thing, with tiny feet and hands reaching out for me. I loved you immediately, and I have loved you every moment since.
"Ah, what a brave fellow, this Icarus," Maggie told Claire, gesturing as if she were on a stage. "He would melt his own wings if only his two friends did not pinken in the sun."
Claire giggled over her margarita, leaning heavily into Jack, who was laughing at something Maggie said. Everyone was milling about somewhere or another, divided into small groups whose boundaries did not stay confined to their circle. Charlie kept leaning over from her conversation with Donna, Jody, and the very cute Daisy to poke Rowena’s side and offer some joke or another.
“Friends with benefits just didn’t seem to… suit us, I suppose,” Cas continued after the silence had burrowed into his eardrums, reminding him just how entirely he had missed the salty cadence of Dean’s voice. “We were better as friends.”
Gabe reached down for another baseball, saw it was empty, and did a quick calculation before refilling the bucket. “So you’re upset because he left everyone?” His vision swam a moment.
Sam glanced back at Charlie, who shrugged. “Uh, good, I think. What about your mission? How’s it going?”
She wanted to ask if he was broken inside, if he was angry, if he called Cas to ask for help. If he called Cas again. And again. And again.
“Of course I did! I was positive you were merely Michael trying to undo all that we had accomplished together!”
Sam thought of words, he thought of phrases and sentences and paragraphs and novels. He could talk forever, he was sure, on why he couldn’t talk. “I missed you,” he finally whispered.
"Well… the way I figure, there are two options. One: it's Michael, and I need to stop falling into his hands. Or two: it's Sam, and he's wasting his life away trying to save us."
Fergus laid the bags on the kitchen island, looking around. "The actual Bunker is quite nice," he remarked. "I've only ever seen the dungeon."
I was too young to fly for very far or long by myself, so Gabriel would hold my hand as we flew, carrying me when necessary. We would fly out to the edge of the universe.
“I’m currently working on learning the curve of your mouth, so we can come back to that in a bit,” Dean breathed out, leaning forward to capture his lips again.
“All of them. Which you would know if you had spent more time listening to me and less time staring at my lips.”
"We'll wait to let the word out until after the wedding, okay?" Gabe said softly. "You two are right. There's no God here, so why bother revolving around him anymore?"
"Oblivion. It's a sort of... pocket dimension, I guess, that touches our own. You said that nothing gets into the box and nothing gets out. So, well..." Sam trailed off. "Welcome to nothing."
"I mean we kinda like. Held hands a little? And he played with my hair. I dunno, the whole dynamic is different than I'm used to."
I don't remember much of the rest of that day. Odysseus brought him back to me, and I screamed. The earth trembled, and Naomi laughed.
“That is fine. Simply let them know it is allowed now.” Raphael turned to the other archangels. “Brothers,” she said, addressing them. “It is time.”
"Oh, just a skip and a jump, really. We'll be there in no time." Donna looked back at Sam and Jody. "Poor giant can't see all the way down to his feet."
Honestly, as Sam trudged happily to his own room, his face hurt from smiling so much. And wasn’t that just a wonderful feeling? It had turned out to be a fantastic day, and everyone would still be there tomorrow. There had been no talk of monsters or hunting or night. Just family being family. Just happiness. Just what Sam had truly always wanted.
She passed the library, where Jody and Donna had passed out on the couch together. She passed room after room, hall after hall until she finally found Claire.
Cas’s shoulders relaxed. “Ah. I understand.” He held her out at arm’s length, looking at her. “You’ve grown so much since I first met you. I’m so proud of the woman you have become.”
"Sam," she said, hand covering her mouth as Orion's blood marred the water. "Oh my god. What have I done?" She turned to him, wide-eyed. "Bring him back."
I always used to sign us up. Did you know that? As long as we were competent, Dad didn't actually care if we went or not. But Sammy always loved school, so I'd sign us up.
Claire kicked Sam in the leg from her place in Maggie’s lap. “Hey, move your ass! I’m enjoying this!”
Dean pressed his forehead just under Castiel’s shoulder, on the top of his chest. “I’m only allowed to ask how long we’ve been down here once, right?”
Claire looked at the warm stovetop, at Sam's face turned away from her, at the extended olive branch in the room.
Castiel’s lips were hellfire again, torturous and beautiful and capable of drawing every emotion out of him. “I am.”
I— Jack, I honestly don’t know why I even wanted to go so bad. We got there and it was the lamest party I’d ever been to. There was awkward dancing and weird music and like. A punch bowl? And some chips. It was honestly bad.
There were no more questions within Dean’s mind other than if Castiel’s skin still felt the same against his open lips, if his dreams had diminished or enhanced the memories, if that voice still quaked and rumbled like the raging sea when his head was thrown back. “Lead the way,” Dean managed before he was pulled through a grove, deep into the park and out the other side. Leaves still clung to his jacket in the way his hands would soon be clinging to Castiel.
Dean grunted. "Right. You're 'not Alastair'. Got it. You're an 'angel'." Dean rolled his eyes. "Tell me something then, Allie. If angels exist, then why does bad shit always happen, huh? If there's a
“I can hear the smile in your voice, Cas. You ain’t slick. Even underwater. Not even a bit slippery.”
“Absolutely.” Charlie hit enter again, and Donna did the same. “Sometimes I get pent-up energy and I’ve gotta go do some sparring to get rid of it, but that’s about it. It’s… nice, not having to fight for your life constantly. I even have a girlfriend now.”
I’ve had a few of those, you know. Back in Purgatory, I had half-convinced myself that it was our Heaven. Once I found you, that’s all I could think, that I could live forever by your side, as long as it was by your side.
You wouldn't have recognized me, you know. I was a teenager, all blonde hair and energetic legs. I ran everywhere, often towing Patroclus with me. We were young. We were in love. We had escaped the throes of our lives, to live as healers atop Mount Pelion forever.
There was silence, and then Castiel chuckled. "I'm sorry. You couldn't see that. I shrugged rather dramatically. I was imitating an image of an old man in a red shirt— nevermind. I don't know, in your case. It's usually just a species versus subspecies thing. But we're talking philosophically."
"You idiot," he heard a voice say somewhere far away. There were soft lips against his cheek, and that same voice within his ear, shakily, "It was always you, too."
“I try not to think about that.” Sam slid out of his seat, sitting by Dean on the nothingness. “I’ve got a girlfriend and a boyfriend, actually. Rowena and Gabriel.”
The box was shallow, as far as boxes go, and Dean only had to spread his fingers wide to brush against Castiel’s face. There was a small scar he knew, just behind his right ear from a specifically hard hit against a wall. He traced it gently, barely able to feel it anymore. “Us being alive is proof, Cas."
We walked back home, and the Impala was sitting outside. Dean peered in the window and snuck back to us, said Dad was passed out.
Castiel shook his head. “The truth has been amended over the ages, but there is a reason many indigenous tribes believe the world to be carried by an animal. They are bigger than you can imagine, and far more primal and ravenous.”
Dean threw his hands out. “Cas is the same way! I walked in last night and he was just… sitting! Fully clothed! On the toilet!
I hope he's playing soccer right now. He loved it so much. I wonder if he still does. I never asked him. We never really got to just talk about normal fucking things once Dad died. It was always monster this and apocalypse that.
He laughed softly. "Yeah, maybe." He rubbed his free hand over his face. "I do need to go grocery shopping. We don't have any junk food for Dean."
Gabriel looked down at the object in his hand. “What is this?” he asked in horror, though he truly already knew.
Dean snatched it from her, fake-offended. "I'm getting it then. I can't expect you to grow up into a good person without hearing Folsom Prison Blues."
"I wanted to help you. I didn't want to seem… even a little weak." She shook her head, starting up a light pace again.
“He did. I heard him through Sam, when that mishap happened. And he gave me a message for you.” Gabriel winced. “I just don’t necessarily think it’s going to help.”
There was a record player and some records, and Jody grabbed the first one she saw. There was the familiar crackling before the music began, slow and warbling.
"Dean," Cas intoned softly, surprised, and with a building pressure Dean no longer hated his own name.
I'm not sure how long we would stay out there. Long enough that I was stronger on the return flights, strong enough eventually to take the meandering routes home. We would swing by stars and float through those just beginning to form.
"Good. It's tryin' to look out for us all." She clapped her hands. "No matter! We'll need its help to find all of these items."
Dean growled and crossed his arms over his chest, grumbling. This was the most interesting thing to happen down here, and he couldn't even sate his own curiosity.
"Are you gonna kiss me every time I lose?" Dean mumbled, parting his lips, brushing them against Cas's.
He'd be lying if he said it wasn't relaxing. No stressors, no anything. Just the gentle pressure of water and the kaleidoscope of colors before him.
TO BE YOUR VESSEL! BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH THE OLDEST! BECAUSE WE RAISED OUR SIBLINGS! BECAUSE WE FOLLOWED OUR FATHERS WITHOUT QUESTION! BECAUSE OUR FATHERS PUT US DOWN BEFORE WE COULD WALK AND TOLD US WE WERE MEN! BECAUSE THEY
Cas felt Dean’s soul writhing in its marked cage and held his face tight, pulling him in and kissing him with a desperation he didn’t know he was capable of. Where lips met lips, skin was just skin, and there were only two faces, two
Sam matched it easily. "We're all a little weak. And we all have stuff to work on. And… maybe you three hurt my feelings a bit, but you were right. I've pushed everything else aside, just like my dad used to do. And I don't wanna be him, so I'm taking steps to fix it."
Sam wiggled between Dean's arms, pushing his hands away from his face. "Bean," Sam said. "Are you gonna stay with me?"
His memories of it were hazy at best, and didn't quite make sense. Like a memory of eighth grade that turned out to be a memory of second. He couldn't place the last time he was here.
Dean smiled slightly, taking a shuddering breath. "How did you ever get so damn innocent in this world?"
"Sammy?" he asked again, afraid for some reason to leave the table. Something bad had happened last time he got up. But he couldn't remember what it was.
"Don't need to. Your breathing is too regular. Sam used to try and pull the same shit." Dean gently kicked at Cas's shin. "Why don't I tell you a bedtime story?"
past for him, that time had stopped when Cas had left him, and he had been stuck in that moment for over a year now. "Do you ever miss Us?"
"Boob physics," Dean repeated triumphantly, watching as pair after pair rippled in the evening breeze.
Dean hummed the tune for a while longer. It swelled in his lungs, vibrated through generations. “I don’t think that was a hymn, Cas,” he said.
"I'm not... ashamed of you. And I'm sorry you ever thought that. I should've... I should've done better to let you know how much I appreciate
Charles shook her head. “I don’t know. I think… I think this re-established the link. One is before where you just went, and one is after.”
They fired round after round into his chest, but, to no avail. The man stood before Dean, who now held a knife.
She let out a breath. “Gosh. Uh, hard question. I dunno. I always thought I was supposed to be attracted to guys because well… that’s just what everyone told me. But then there was Sarah…” Charlie smiled at the memory. “She was my first close friend. We used to do everything together. We were — gosh, what? Sixteen? I was still in high school. It was late one night while we were camping. The firelight was dancing across her face, and I felt my heart skip. Like, actually skip. I’d never felt that for anyone. I laid awake all night thinking about her. And she was sharing my tent, so she knew I hadn’t fallen asleep and asked if I wanted to go skinny dipping.” Charlie cleared her throat. “And that’s how I knew. That night.”
“You think you’re gonna find him, and he’s gonna have some perfect excuse for what happened.” Dean caught the next strike with his palm, yanking the blade out of Michael’s hand.
Already, the Omega’s scent was decorated with unclaimed virtue, a sight so beautiful that both Alphas
The curves morphing through the Alpha’s beefy shoulders produced profound dips of burly muscles that Castiel was dying to feel, his small hands wouldn’t compare to the ripples of muscular strength embedded through the Alpha’s lower back. The slope leading down the Alpha’s back was leaving the Omega’s throat dry.
to touch. Then the Omega’s skin was probably made of the same material found in Greek temples, priceless marble statues that were carved during the time of ingenious artists showing off their talent was not even close to the celestial beauty that overtook the Omega.
Then, as if Castiel knew how to push the Alpha towards the edge, the Omega slipped Dean’s large fingers into his mouth, sucking each digit while moaning obscenely. “
Dean could already feel the outline of an erection popping up and hell, didn’t that make things more exciting.
Dean couldn’t help the vicious snarl escaping his lips, seeing the Omega in pain was horrible, it was like feeling a thousand pins dragging themselves across his skin.
Though, Castiel still cried during his beatings; there was begging, pleading, and like clock work, Lucifer would simply smile down at him and beat the Omega to a pulp. Suicide was a consideration until Castiel realized that Lucifer would not mourn his death, rather the Alpha would dump his body in an alley somewhere and be on the hunt for the Omega’s replacement.
The Omega was beyond beautiful, words could never express the Omega’s euphoric beauty. It was like being in the presence of an angel, a holy relic that deserved more than the bare existence of this crappy universe.
The sound of the car door opening and closing was the most beautiful sound Castiel has heard throughout the day. There was a tiny breeze of fresh air sweeping into the car before it was gone. The pheromones belonging to the Alpha was still trapped inside the car, the smell alone was causing the Omega to become even more sick than what he was.
After what felt like eternity, Sam growled and made a motion behind him. A few more seconds and Sam was gone.
Castiel crossed his arms across Dean's chest, resting his head on them. "He was a plain man, impossible to pick out in a crowd. But he was loyal and kind in a time where I was just learning what those words meant." He glanced down at Dean. "Are you okay?"
Rowena called out, “The others are bringin’ in small paintings that I am goin’ to magic to the wall. It works fine, dearie.”
Were those real yells Dean heard inside himself, or leftovers from a memory best left forgotten? “Will you try?”
Take care of Cas. And let him take care of you, too. He's not going to be okay. And I know you two will hatch some crazy plan to get me out but... don't. I chose this. This is my decision. Respect it.
"Deer. Any kind, really. They were the first animal I encountered when I returned to Earth. I landed in the grass, and there was a doe with her fawn, staring at me. They didn't even run, just watched me silently."
