"Agent Romanoff." He greets, nodding civilly, trying to not let his eyes wander from her face. Not even he could deny, she looked amazing. She was amazing.
"That's not what I mean, Steve. If this works, which it should, we'll need to find Stephen Strange. He'll probably come back on another planet, but I can't imagine him not returning to the sanctum in New York."  Tony hands him the keys. "I know you can handle yourself, which is why I need you to find him to.. to find Peter."
"Hey Steve. Um.. hi Tony?" Sam says awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck with his unoccupied hand.
"I mean every word."
Tony laughs that pretty laugh again, a smile on his face. "I like her. Congrats Vic, I approve."
Steve sets the cake down on the counter, looking very stubbornly at Tony's face. "Literally anyone could've come through that elevator."
"Oh, and don't forget when your son texted me." The car pulls back out of the spot and Tony picks up the route back to Steve's house easily, his driving much calmer and safer than last time. "I still don't see how he hacked my number off your phone."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is my baby scared of the assassin?" Steve teases, holding him tightly.
"Okay... Good idea. You trust Cho?"
"Well given that we got his bff back from the dead, I'd say he's gonna be pretty chill with it." Slowly, they watch him begin to stir, blue eyes fluttering open. "I'll see you in a second dear." She opens the door as he looks around the room, going over to the stereo to turn it down. "Captain Rogers, it's nice to see you awake."
Tony snaps. "My shirt!" He exclaims.
"Alrighty! Now there are ways to make it look a bit more like skin, or I could leave the metal finish on. Honestly, I prefer the metal just for aesthetic purposes, but it's up to you." Tony goes back to running the simulations behind him, as Jarvis forms what he's specifying onto the holographic bust. "You shouldn't have much of a limit to your range if movement or flexibility, and we can go with any color combos you want."
Sam smiles, patting Steve's shoulder. "You should come out with Bucky and me next Sunday. We're going ice skating."
"I'm not Loki."
All done! Happy resolution :D
"Come on boys!" She shouts from down the hall and well... they'd be stupid to disobey a direct order like that.
"I'm good." Steve looks up at him with a smile. Tony walks back up to the pilots seat. Friday immediately begins preparing the Jet for take off and they get up into the air in only a few seconds, heading straight for New York.
"2.." Tony smiles.
"Much. Thank you, really." Steve rolls towards Tony. "How much of what I remember is true?"
"Don't be stupid! You've always sacrificed yourself Tony! I should return the favor. Please.. I can't live another day without you." He's still crying.
"Sounds like the Howard I knew. Did I ever tell you I thought Howard and Peggy were sleeping together?" The snort she replies with is enough to tell him that he had in fact, not told her about that. "It's true. They had been talking about stopping for fondue on the way back from dropping me off in enemy territory, and I was absolutely convinced that meant sex."
"Good idea." Tony says, briskly, not moving a muscle. "Carry me, my love."
Tony is floating.
Yay! Now we know who Peter Parker is!
"Exactly, that's just not right. I mean I had Scott ask him to be his best man, and I'm not even in the party? I mean, let alone the scene he threw, and then he didn't even show up to the wedding." Steve sees red as she plows right ahead. "But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I mean I forgave him a long time ago. I just want to make sure he's doing okay. It's been so long since we've seen each other."
"Some of the other customers are uncomfortable, I'm very sorry." In her stress, a bit of her southern accent seeps through
Four days later they're on a plane to Siberia into the belly of the beast that has haunted Steve's dreams for the past eighty years, but they're going together, so there's a chance that it won't be so bad.
"3.." Steve looks up at him.
"I'll get it," he says a bit coldly, making a note on the clipboard as he walks away.
"Victor's Wanda?" Tony looks over at him with an inquisitive look, even though really he already knew the answer.
"I don't wanna play this game, let's just call it even."
"Okay. Is Hope coming?"
He goes back to playing and Nat sets the circuit on the arm rest, propping her head on her hand. "Are you okay, Steve? I'm sure that this is... hard for you."
She nods, walking past him into the house, shocked into silence for what Steve guessed was the first time ever. Daniel stops on his way past Steve, waiting for him to close the door. "I don't know if you are who you say you are, but I don't want any funny business. She's moved on." He holds himself in a commanding way, despite the crutch he was using to hold himself up. He was exactly the kind of guy Peggy deserved. Steve smiles, despite the almost-threat in his words.
"Yeah I know," he says with a fond look on his face as he adjusts the arm around her bare shoulders. She was wearing a strapless scarlet dress that matched Victors tie nicely. "It's nice to see you again Mr. Rogers."
Bucky winks.
"Worth a shot," Bucky says, sitting up. "First, I decree that we get some fucking food."
Hey there! I got the idea for this AU at like 2 am on the phone with my girlfriend, so now here we all are with this. I wrote the whole thing in like one sitting because I’m a problem, so as soon as it’s all edited it will be going up. Probably two chapters a week. Some are a little shorter, some a little longer, all are relatively short compared to what I usually do though. Ok, hope you enjoy!
Steve winces. "Rebecca," he says, almost pleadingly. "You said you weren't going to cause a scene." As much as Bucky was his brother, Rebecca really was like a sister for a long time... ok, maybe more like a favorite cousin or something. Steve really didn't want to have to cause a scene either, but it looked like it might be coming to that.
Those two weak syllables were all Tony needed to hone in on Steve's location, drawing nearer with every step. There was the shield—he picks it up as he's walking, slinging it over his own shoulders, because what kind of a team would they be if he couldn't hold Steve's shield—and there was Rogers, sitting up against a tree with his head leaned back. "Damnit Rogers, if you ever fall out of a plane again, I'm going to have to beat your ass."
Tears form in Steve's eyes, and before Tony can realize what's happening, Steve is hugging him as tight as he can through the armor. "Tony. Tony. I've always loved you."
Tony hooks the finger pointed at Steve's chest into his tie, pulling it with just enough pressure for him to feel it. "No, not any more," he says low and quiet.
"Duh. Alright best man, go find something last minute to do, I'm going to play angry birds." Steve rolls his eyes, standing up.
They arrive to the venue, three layer cake in tow, almost an hour later due to the carefulness required to move a wedding cake. Though, with Tony and Peter helping, it was easier than the last time he made a wedding cake. Tony hangs off his arm as they enter, an indescribable look on his face as he gazed around at the hall. It was the same room in which the reception would be an hour later, with a massive window taking up the back wall. The sun shone through the window, filtering through masses of lavender and white balloons, placed specifically to cast the colors around the hall. Steve knew that because he had helped set it up only yesterday, along with Nat, Clint, Wanda, and Pietro. "I personally think it's quite unfair that you have to leave me now," Tony whines, batting his lashes up at Steve.
Better him then Natasha though. She could never get in a combat situation, not here. Lucky for him he had been able to play it off as her bring a secret weapon, but in reality he was scared that the power inside her would be released. So far, the only evidence of anything beyond her eyes glowing when she gets emotional was when she had calmed his body down after dinner with Peggy. Maybe that was it. It would be really nice if that was it.
Hmm.. who’s Peter Parker? 🤔
They leave Howard a file downloaded directly from HYDRA's servers on the infiltration of SHIELD, along with a letter addressed: To Tony, on his 21st birthday. Steve had written it while they were infiltrating HYDRA and left it here with their stuff. Net smiles down at Tony, grinning up at her. "Hey kiddo," She says, picking him up.
"Reassuring. What you can't do, hopefully the serum can." Steve says, peering down at his own face. "Nat, how do you feel about dressing up like you're pretending to be from the 40's?"
Steve sets a hand on her waist, pulling her back. "We look forward to working with you."
"Yeah, thanks."
"Yes, very. You're telling me... my god." He stumbles backward into a chair, running his hand over his face. "2023... shit. And who's she?"
Steve clenches his jaw. "You can hardly breathe!" He exclaims.
Now on the other hand, he kind of was expected to be somewhere important in an hour. Even if he didn't want to be there.
Tony glances around, locating the bathrooms, which were gladly not far. He pulls Steve back towards the wall, smirking at his usually irritatingly innocent boyfriend. "Of course you will baby. Cause you're mine, and there's nothing you can do about it."
"I knew I was forgetting something. Hold on, I'm definitely gonna blow you. Wouldn't want your delicious come wasted on an expensive suit." Tony winks, moving down to undo Steve's pants, pulling his dick out with reverence. "Mmmh... yeah, I want you inside me at home." He strokes up and down Steve's length a couple times, watching the blond bite at his lip.
"Of course, darling."
"Love is in the air," Steve says, smiling sweetly. Tony hums a gentle affirmation, leaning up into Steve's neck to plant a little kiss there. "I'm pretty sure Bucky wouldn't let me live it down if I got hickeys at his wedding."
Tony laughs, hitting his shoulder. "I'm actually not worried about it. I think telling him will do more than enough in that department. He's an ass but he's not a dick."
"I didn't know the government had time travel in the 40's," he says, squinting at them.
Tony grabs his hand across the table before Steve can say another word, pulling him away from the newlyweds. "Um, right," Steve says, too little too late. But Tony keeps holding his hand once they've cleared the table, so maybe it's all a win in the end. "Tony, I don't think you're going to avoid her wrath," he mutters.
Tony sets a hand on his shoulder, then steps away. "Be safe."
Howard steps out of the car first, holding the door open for Maria, who's bright yellow dress falls around her ankles when she steps out, holding Tony in his baby suit. Steve follows them, his hair dyed black and his beard grown out. Natasha steps out, taking his hand and pulling herself up. Steve collides the door, and she slips her arm through his. The pearls around her gloved wrist are cool on his hand. "Smile dear," She says, beaming at the paparazzi. Luckily, most of their attention was on the Starks. Still, if they recognized him... it was all up. It would be considered far to dangerous to remain in this reality and they would have to leave.
"I mean, really it's only fair. You met some of my family," Tony says, buckling himself in and starting the car, "this time, I can meet some of yours."
He steps out into the street, pushing his wrapper into the recycling bin against the door. The street is busy, but not as busy as it could be during the day. It was nice out, and a cool breeze sweeps through his hair. He could go home, but what kind of a man would he be to waste a day like this, especially when he knew he had a tiny sketchbook tucked away in his wallet.
"Damn," Steve mutters appreciatively. "Ok but like, you have to forget things."
"I know Tony please I know. I love you so much, you can't do that." He's hugging Tony again, but Tony can only bristle under his touch now.
"What is it?" He asks, voice still gruff, but more open now.
Oh Tony...
"Steve, can you call Sam," Tony asks, keeping an easy comforting smile on his face.
Or maybe Steve had just cracked the code. "Why not?"
Tony raises his brows. "It would be hard not to get that scraped up in events like these. It's a miracle you're all okay." That apparently satisfies all their questions to the point where they just don't have the energy to prod deeper, so no words are spoken until Steve rises to his feet, patting Peter's shoulder.
His hair is smooth through his fingers as he washes it, rubbing at his scalp. How would he be able to face anyone he knew ever again knowing what he had done. While it wasn't exactly illegal, it was still wrong, no matter how right it had felt to his heart. At the time he hadn't even registered how wrong it was. He kissed a man who he still wasn't certain liked men, but that he was certain loved someone else. Loved Pepper a lot.
"Should I consider myself lucky then?" Steve raises an eyebrow.
Tony leans further back until his back hits Steve's lap, his brown eyes now looking up at Steve. "I mean... I won't stop you. I.. I just don't celebrate." His voice is the only indication that something is amiss. Somehow in front of a crowd Tony could hide anything, but if it was just them, he was shit at secret keeping.
The shadowed figure chuckles menacingly, not doing as Tony asked. What a pisshat, really. "Consider me a guide, to you, and all who seek the Soul Stone."
"Well actually," Nat says. "We're time travelers, so, we had it for a week or so."
Steve directs his attention back to Natasha. "There's about to be a fight."
"We can help you assemble that on the cake cart,"
He's in a pool of cold water, which he realizes first. Second, the weight of a cool stone pressed into his gauntlet. Third, fingers moving in his other hand. "Steve," he pleads, his eyelids still just too heavy to open.
Natasha follows him towards the elevator first, and Steve would be a damn liar if he didn't enjoy the sight of Howard squirming a bit. They all slide into the elevator, and it goes up two floors, opening into a library. As soon as they're all out, Howard fiddles with a large green book with his hand, and a book case slides closed over the elevator. "There you have it. Jarvis! Can you show our guests to a room!"
"You swear almost as much as Maria," he chastises, getting up to unlock the door. Steve hadn't ever met Maria, but given everything Tony had ever casually mentioned, she hadn't struck him as the kind to swear. She had sounded like the perfect housewife everyone in that century had longed for. She had established several funds for artistic societies though, so what he had gleaned from that period of history, it's very possible she had been part of the beats movement in the 50's. Who knows, maybe he'll meet her.
Steve looks up at the ceiling. He hasn't slept all night, yet the sun rose once more. Yellow light flicked across his vision, and he knows that to go to sleep now would be bad. So he rises, feeling a heaviness to his movements. His hair is dirty, so he walks into the bathroom, pointedly not looking at the broken shield sitting on his table. His reflection looks back at him, 15 years seem to slip away before his eyes. He sighs, turns around, and peels his clothes from his sweaty body. Just because he hadn't slept tonight, didn't mean he hadn't been plagued by nightmares that sent his heart racing. He steps into the shower, turning it up. He can't exactly tell if it is hot or cold water, but it feels nice. With militant precision he hurries through his shower, then steps out, steeling his shoulders for what comes next. On his way to his closet, he passes his discarded suit... the one Tony had made him. His chest collapses in on itself. He pulls on his other suit—the funeral one. The one Tony had bought him for the funeral they had held after the decimation. There had been nothing to bury, but it had needed to be done. Clint hadn't come. Thanos had been dead, and they needed to move on. Tony actually did. Steve never could bring himself to.
"Tony's alive right now," Steve says noncommittally. He would love to go down to earth and.. and what? At this point, him and Tony were just starting to get along, and he had no reason to go to earth. It would be nothing short of self indulgent and reckless. (Although wasn't all of this?).
Steve smiles as he opens the door to find Tony and Peter standing there, both in full suits. A wide smile spreads across Tony's face immediately, and he pulls Steve into a big hug. "It's been too long sweetheart," he says sweetly, and Steve hugs him back just as tightly.
"Tony."
"You know I'm never safe, Pegs," Steve says, smiling at her.
Steve chuckles. "His name is Tony." Tony holds up his own left hand to prove it. Betty squeals again.
"Oh, no we wouldn't want to impose." She flashes him a blinding smile. Steve still has a half a thought to ask for separate rooms, but quickly squashed that. Whatever Nat is playing at, he's sure she has her reasons. Besides, if it gets awkward, he can always sleep on the couch; it looks comfortable enough.
They are also at a bit of an impasse in their delve into HYDRA and the KGB. Theoretically, it wouldn't be hard to infiltrate either, if they could find the right people. The two organizations were also working together, according to what Steve could glean from current texts and his memory. Who really knows though, it's all just propaganda against communism. Besides, according to all of this, HYDRA was eradicated in the 1940's by Captain America and the Howling Commanders.
Steve smiles sorely, feeling Tony's hand close around the sheets over him. "He was my best friend. I know they made him do bad things... Nat's combing through it all now. Still I can't... I can't just let him go."
Gone to hospital, Maria having contractions.
"That's true," Peter interjects. "Once he bought me a private jet because I asked for pjs."
"But. So did I. I get it, but I need you to be strong. I need you to not gush to my five year old. I need you to move on. The world is sorely lacking with Tony and Nat gone, and you need to get it together so nobody can take advantage of us again. Whatever that means for you, it needs to happen." Her voice isn't pitiful, but it isn't mean either. She doesn't waver once, and Steve has half the mind to think that she would be the strongest of all of them if she took up heroism.
Steve pinches his hand in an attempt to get his brain to work. "Yeah, no problem sir."
The possibilities were endless. He was on top of the world, and nobody could take him down now. So many years spent alone could finally mean something, as long as he could make this work.
(See the end of the chapter for
None of them speak up for a long moment, until Flash finally says something. "Why were Peter and MJ already here?"
That's all Steve needs to turn and jog up towards Bucky, who is clutching his phone with white knuckles. "Bucky," Steve announces, falling to his knees beside his friend. His nice pants soak through quickly, but he doesn't exactly care. "Hey pal, it's Steve. You called me, can you look up at me." Bucky shakes his head no, clearly too numb to really understand what Steve was saying. "Can I touch you," Steve says, holding his hands out in front of himself. Bucky nods, and Steve immediately pulls him close, Bucky's weight now resting fully in Steve's lap. He moves closer to Steve with a whimper. Steve looks up at Tony, who is standing by the fountain with his eyes fixed on Steve and Bucky with a concerned expression.
"Like a throuple?"
However, not a moment later, her eyes narrow and she looks over at Tony. "Anthony Edward Stark, did you get me a strawberry cake for my wedding?"
"He's dumb." Pepper says with a shrug.
"You didn't," Tony says, grabbing the bowl and opening it up. "I think you should give me the recipe," Tony says, throwing his arms around Bruce's shoulders.
Howard grins. "Glad I set him on the right path then."
"I know you are." She pats his shoulder and sidesteps, continuing her walk towards Morgan and Happy.
"Ok. I love you."
"I'll be there. I'd like to.. to not talk about it though. I'm sure dad is listening."
"Um.." He didn't particularly want to say it. Like, not at all.
"Good morning sir," Scott says softly, back to full size when Steve turns back to look at him. He's wearing all black, and there's a small chunk of bagel in his cheek. "Look, I'm sure this is all really hard but—" he rambles quickly.
He looks up at Steve, the only light now coming from the fire, his reactor, and the blinking control panel. Yeah.... he's not exactly sure what he's going to do about this.
"Yeah," Steve says breathlessly as he opens the door and steps back out onto the busy streets.
"Of course. Yes to both of those things," Steve says quickly with a smile. He walks back towards the door. "Pietro, I'm leaving!" He shouts, trusting that Pietro could hear him even though he didn't respond.
Steve sighs, finishing the cookie. "Fine."
Tony shuts his eyes. "You've gotta study kid." Yes. Yes he wanted to watch Monty Python, what the hell kind of question was that.
"I can handle myself," she says stubbornly.
Tony chuckles. "Sam's not wrong. Now what do you say we go find him, alright."
"Weee!" He squeals, grabbing Steve's longish black hair.
Bucky lets out a little laugh. "Yeah no, actually I um.. I took a landmine while I was out on a rescue mission. I did finish my mission though."
sorry, bie
"Yes, thank you."
"He put you in the river!" Tony roars, turning back on him with a finger pointed straight at Steve's chest. "And he killed my mom. An unknown number of political enemies. Innocents. Civilians! He's not the kind of man you save, Steve, he's the kind you lock away!"
"See if I fucking care," he mutters half heartedly.
"I'll come with you," Tony says, looking up at them too. His hand finds Steve's. "You've gotta tell me what the fuck her deal is sometime though, ok?"
Steve rolls his eyes, opening the container Howard had made them for the Power stone. It wasn't much like the original, but it would work at least. "I'm not dead either, Starlord." Nat opens the bag, putting the stone into the opened capsule.
Unfortunately, it's then that Steve looks up at the table to see Sam standing and locked in a heated conversation with Rebecca over the table, his arm in front of Bucky. The rest of the table seemed to be in a similar state of agitated attention, and it was moments before they would gather real attention. "I think I should go diffuse that..." Steve says begrudgingly.
The man sets down a cup of coffee with a clink. "No not at all. Hi, I'm Adam."
"Yeah yeah, get outta here Starlord." Peter gets stars in his eyes, but he goes back to his ship dutifully, a bit of a skip in his step. From the machine on his belt, too loud 70's pop music starts playing and he gets into the ship, taking off.
"Takes me back to our second kiss," Tony says into his ear, leaning close.
"I hope families are reunited." Steve can almost feel the sorrow radiating off of Pepper with those words. Tony had reunited millions of families, and torn his own to shreds.
"I know."
"I'm just going to grab a snack and head down to the lab," Tony lies, biting back his tongue. His head is desperate to tell the truth, to explain to Peter exactly why he was upset. But Peter was busy. He had an SAT to study for, and Tony wasn't going to take him away from that.
"Deadly."
"You..." Steve feels a blush creeping across his cheeks.
But he was very very busy diverting his attention halfway across the room at his sweet boyfriend, who was definitely flirting with the pretty brunette hanging off his arm.
"You're not gonna leave me for married men are you?" Steve jokes, folding his and Tony's fingers together and pulling their joined hands into his lap.
"Love," Steve corrects, removing his hand. "Could we... I don't know. All be together?"
"Holy shit, we died," Flash says.
"Oh, you don't have to do that," Tony says with a little wave of his fork.
Unfortunately, it seemed that that wasn't meant to be.
"Your girl's scary Stevie," Bucky mutters once she's out of earshot.
"That's the idea. Most of what Helen gets up to nowadays is about printing tissue, but unfortunately we haven't come up with a viable workaround for such an old and massive wound."
"No? You're not dead," Nat says, still crouching with her elbows on her knees.
"Absolutely. Absolutely."
"Do too." His breathing is heavy, labored. Tony doubts he would even remember this conversation in a few hours.
But when it comes down to it, isn't it? It gets the point across. "It's beautiful." Really though, he's just looking at Tony, and he knows that Tony knows that, because he's staring right back.
So Tony was going to be an Uncle again, and this time, he would be able to spoil that little kid from the second they're born.
Before too long, the wood is dry, and Tony starts it up with his laser finger... he would have to thank Bucky for that one when they see him again. The fire starts slowly, but it's there, and Tony is actually pretty proud of himself for that. Tony sits next to the fire and opens one of the food packets, biting into the overall bland bread and jerky. Better than nothing.
"I know. He knew though."
He leads them up the stairs and into a long hallway with several rooms off of it. The nearest door on the left side is apparently the one he had deemed fit for them, because he pulls the large doors open, allowing them entrance. Steve looks around the room, his eyes landing on the one bed in the center of the room. Before he can even think to ask for separate rooms, Nat has a hand on his upper arm. "Thank you so much, Mr. Jarvis. Any way we can help out, don't hesitate to ask."
Steve nods, then he picks up a pancake and bites into it, leaning over the counter, carefully avoiding the ants. His phone buzzes in his pocket, so he pulls it out.
Bucky shrugs. "I'm more than happy with whatever I can get."
He leans his head against the side of the shower, cold water hitting his back. After that, it's a series of automatic movements that require little to no consideration until the point where he is curled under the thick but scratchy blankets. A few minutes later, Nat slides in next to him, meeting his blue eyes with green ones. She takes his hand, squeezing it in a series of rhythms. You ok?
His lips tilt up into a smirk, and he opens his mouth to say something presumably very suggestive, but they're interrupted by a voice Steve know. "Uncle Tony.. I hope I'm not interrupting," Victor says, clearly very aware that he was interrupting.
He sighs, a small smile on his face as he looks down. "That's a long story. Basically, they found me in 2011. In 2023, your son invented time travel so we could save the universe. Now I'm here to return what we borrowed from time. The blue stone used to be the teseract, it's for you."
Tony looks at him, chewing the inside of his cheek. But Steve doesn't know what to say to make anything better. Apparently dissatisfied, Tony turns away and walks out the door, pulling it shut behind him. Steve struggles to pull in a single breath, tears pouring down his face in full force. He knew.. of course he knew this wouldn't be pretty, but he couldn't help but hope. It's hard to have your hopes smashed.
"Let me prove it to you. I'm yours, and nothing anyone else could do would change that. She can flirt all she wants, but I come home with you." A playful smile slips onto Steve's face and that's precisely when Tony knows, in some small way, that Steve
"Very well, ma'am." And very well it went indeed. He graduated third in his class. Unfortunately, college wasn't cheap enough for a kid living unstably just above the poverty line. Instead, in the middle of the depression, he began to paint. The federal government was paying artists and authors to produce their goods, and as he couldn't exactly get a job in construction, he was left to that. By then, he was saving up to buy a nicer flat for his mom and him. It so turned out that he was good at art—at least, good enough to get by. In the 21st century, he had seen one of his paintings from the time, a look over the New York water, the Statue of Liberty towering over it. There was a boat moored at Ellis isle, and a few immigrants piled off. He remembered that painting, Bucky had been siting next to him while he painted it, licking a cone of strawberry ice cream. He also remembered that he had sold it for almost 40 dollars. Now it was priced at well over three million. It was good, but not that good. The name attached to it was worth that money, not the art. He had asked Tony to buy it and donate it to a veterans relief organization Tony had done so, which was the first markable point in time that Steve realized that he really liked Tony. Because of course, ever the overachiever, Tony had bought every Steve Rogers for sale, and donated it. Just like that. It meant little to Tony in the long run, he wouldn't even miss the money, but to Steve it meant the world. To the vets that got all that money, it meant paid medical bills and meals on the table. The seemingly simple gesture had inspired Steve to start painting again.
“Stevie, what are you getting yourself into here?” Terror strikes Steve then. Bucky’s going to think awful things of him if he finds out what Steve is thinking. He’ll think Steve is being nosy and maybe self-interested. But because Steve is here, and even though he isn’t committed to telling Bucky his innermost thoughts, he will anyway. That’s what they are to each other, and it means the world to Steve. Not betraying that principle is more important than the morality of the kinds of thoughts he’s having.
He’s standing there, a little lost but for the feeling of Steve to hold onto inside of him.
Natasha has to remind herself that even brain dead people can make motions.
Tony is strapped to the gurney, the clumsy rolling of it distracting him from pawing at his oxygen mask.
“I think I’m in trouble.” Tony stands up and bends down to gather his clothes, and topples over. His body feels like it’s being held over a fire, skin tight and stiff with heat. His muscles are rapidly starting to ache, and the tumult in his groin is only getting louder.
. Red, weeping, so fat that he doesn’t know how it will fit.
“Need a lift?” Steve doesn’t answer so much as he raises a battered arm that the robot takes in hand and hoists. Hands grasp at his pants, pulling him down, but the metal man is stronger. Steve swings for a second in the air before he’s pulled up nearer the chest of the metal plates and he clamors onto the feet of the machine that’s carrying him, wrapping an arm around its waist.
“What do you say?”
“Damn straight. I’m delightful.” Steve can’t help but chuckle.
“I love you.” It slides out easily, but it feels like it tears pieces of himself with it when it goes. Out from his lungs, his heart, his very soul.
“Has he hurt you?” Bucky is in his face then, nostrils flaring as he scents Tony. Tony smacks him on the shoulder, shoving him away.
“I’ll be outside.” Steve walks out feeling like he doesn’t know whether he won or lost. Maybe it’s neither. Maybe it’s both. He knows he has to be patient, but he’s never been one for waiting. He wants Tony to like him, to eventually love him. The day can’t come soon enough that Tony begs for Steve to be inside him, to be deeply lodged in his Omega’s heart and his ass all at once.
Steve was only able to scent Tony through the cloud of beta cologne the other man wore because of his super senses. It’s how he knows that Tony was coming off a heat– a heat he spent alone.
He plates the meatloaf and steams some broccoli to go with it. He eats his portion first, needing the fortitude that comes from having a full belly to face this.
“Even Extremis can’t heal multiple fractures to the spine.” Tony moans on Steve’s answering thrust and clings at Steve’s shoulders, taking him all the way to the hilt. Steve pulls Tony’s head back down and locks their eyes together.
“I can’t cook. I burn everything.” Tony slams the fridge door shut.
And like that, his erection starts to subside, thinking about Tony being hospitalized because of what Steve did.
Meeting over, Tony sidles off. Or rather, he tries to.
“I had the warrant rescinded last night, Maria, just try me. You won’t like what happens.”
He’s so very, very lucky when the call to assemble goes off.
“I will Father.”
“You think omegas don’t have obligations to the home.”
“Then learn how. He needs more than just rigid protocol and rules.”
Steve strides down the hall, trying not to run and jostle Tony, but desperate to get to his lover’s room. The sooner he bites Tony, the better it will be for both of them. The whining that Tony is doing into his shirt is painfully adorable and also grates on his last Alpha nerve. As an Alpha, he should have had Tony in his bed, nested and ready.
“You win Stevie. I never thought I’d hear Tony defend you, but there he is, swearing up and down this wasn’t you.” Bucky looks beaten, the kind of resigned he was when Steve used to get into fights with bullies much bigger than himself. It’s charming, and it lets Steve know that things are going to be ok.
“Are you arguing with me?”
“Will you be joining us?” Steve asked.
The elevator doors chime open, and Tony walks in but stops when he sees Steve.
“And your Omega is currently unbonded?” Steve knows these are just cursory questions. It doesn’t matter, however, because the crux of it is that what he’s going to do isn’t acceptable in much of the Omega portion of the population. Health care professionals fall in that spectrum, likely seeing the worst results of forced bonding. Steve can’t blame them, even though they’re wrong about every Alpha who does this being the same. This is different. Tony will benefit.
The claws dive in again, less coordinated this time, and Tony briefly thinks that the Kaiju is dying before he has the twisted desire to be wrapped up in the creature’s hand, to be tossed out to where
“It’s time for you to go, Killian. Now.” The door opens and Steve steps through, giving a little ‘oh’ as he sees that Tony still has company.
“Threat! Verbal threat to the poor, little Omega. I feel threatened.”
“We’re more than a month in. That’s a long time to pine about things and do nothing to get in my good graces.”
“Oh, gimme gimme.” He trots over to Steve, making his grabby hands, which is unfairly adorable and makes Steve want to pet his soft-looking hair. Steve watches avidly as Tony demolishes the carbonara, noodles disappearing so fast that Steve can’t believe he’s even tasting the food.
Tony likes Andorians. They’re just so polite and not liable to punch you in the face, which has happened more than Tony is comfortable with.
“Tony!” Steve is trying so hard to protest, but it’s sexy and amusing all at once.
“Fury is having me take a class.”
“How is that my problem? Paradise has a price tag, Pepper.” He stretches out his arm, the symbiote crawling with it, hovering in the air, orbiting his body as he settles into it completely.
“And Killian?” He needs to know.
“So what’re you doing here anyway?” Trevor asks. Natasha remains silent.
. Like Steve’s mother did. Tony is a good person. Steve wants all of that surrounding him again and again, like drowning in syrup, the air bubbles of his breath unable to find their way to the surface. His heart had beaten against his rib cage like a trapped bird during Tony’s heat, just wanting to be free to love Tony like he deserved. His brave, strong omega, to have endured all of what Steve has done and still come out like this.
“You and I both know it’s not. Power is power.” Tony gets up and walks back over to the bar, reflexively grabbing the bottle and filling his glass even more, as if it’s something that will make Steve agitated. It doesn’t. Steve will have a handle on that aspect of Tony soon anyway. In the meantime, he lets his prey think that the trap isn’t waiting to be sprung.
“Sir, if I may suggest waiting until—–”
Tony is a mess. His poor Omega is squirming on his stomach, ass exposed to Steve and the light glisten of slick peeking out of his crack. Every muscle in Tony’s body is tense, ready for action of any kind, but mostly for an Alpha to soothe every ache and pain away.
Swift, it slinks forward, low and fast on its belly, water dripping from every crevice as it darts towards them. It isn’t usually the kind of attacker that goes for the face, but desperate times. The suit creaks and buzzes, coming to life as Tony and Steve’s mind send minute signals to each operational array to assure readiness. Phosphorescent stripes twinkle and undulate under the haze of water as it flicks towards them with ever-increasing speed. It doesn’t lumber, or barrel, but instead whips its body up as it roars, climbing the legs of the suit as if it’s an overgrown cat-tree. The claws clack on the surface, finding purchase in the divots of each hinge as they raise their arms to stop it from toppling them over.
Tony rights himself, and looks at Steve, suspicion writ on his face. It makes Steve feel the terrible weight of how he’s hurt Tony before. He wants so badly for Tony to trust him, so he holds out a blueberry like an offering to him. Instead of snatching it, Tony leans forward, eyes still discerning, and takes it with his lips, twining his tongue around Steve’s fingers and sucking the berry into his mouth.
Tony felt an immediate, unshakeable sense of sadness. Kind of like when you realize that bad things can happen to good people, or that Steve Jobs will almost certainly make more money than him over arbitrary time scales. He could not both protect his identity, and eat doughnuts at the same time.
“I’m always beautiful,” he deadpans. Tony watched Steve circle around the counter, gaze still locked onto the monstrosities sticking out from Tony’s back. Steve really likes the wings, and the wings really like Steve, and all of that was just a clusterfuck waiting to happen.
“It’s good of you to offer to help. But we’re covered here.” As he releases Ty’s hand, the other man whips it down to his side, grabbing at it and rubbing with his other hand.
Even as Fury used Coulson’s death to try and bind them, Tony resented it. He wasn’t made for this. He lied as needed, fought and bit out insults as a default. There was no way he was equipped for this.
“Tell me again,” Tony asks.
Steve backs him to the bed, each shin pushing at his until the backs of his knees strike mattress, and he falls easily into the sheets. Tony turns over, and crawls towards his nest, his baser urges telling him to settle into it, show Steve he’d be good at providing, good at taking it so many times that there’s no possible way he’s not pregnant. Even if that won’t be happening due to his birth control pill that he took before arriving, his body is unconvinced by reality.
“They said you’ll die without help, Tony. And you’re the one that picked me, this—”
“It didn’t seem right. I wanted to do this for you.” Steve shrugs.
“Ok, I don’t think that fits either. Let’s just shelve the issue for now. Now why don’t you toddle off downstairs while the adults talk.”
“You know that’s not why Captain America wanted you.” It’s intoxicating, being this near his goal, seeing it waiting before him, skittish, but his nonetheless. The symbiote stretches itself as Tony walks forward, his hips rolling. When Tony reaches him, their chests bumping off one another, Steve’s entire body is cool, partially wrapped up in Tony’s symbiote. It’s stroking the inside of his thighs, his abdomen, swirling on the sensitive points of his body. Getting hard is a natural response, and he leans into it, letting the flow of metal tug him closer to Tony.
Steve attacks his nipples first, tweaking and twisting until they’re pretty-red, perfect for squeezing when Tony’s orgasm hits.
“You’re done doing that, too.” She grabs him and drags. Tony tumbles out of the bed, not opting to get on his feet. Natasha doesn’t let up, continuing to pull at him as Tony sprawls out on the floor.
He sways a bit while standing, feeling the surreal reality of what just happened. It might not even be over either.
Steve chuckles. That’s just like Tony. He can’t even be mad.
Because it feels
He tries to approach again and she pushes him back, her hair completely awry from the flight, face streaked with dry tears.
“So you can’t just openly admit this is good for him?”
“Then he’s not causing himself harm in the medical sense. May I suggest you do some reading on omega biology and socialization.”
“It’s powered by arc reactors.” Bruce pipes up from behind the terminal while Tony crosses his arms and stares down the Captain, daring him to comment.
Groaning around Bucky’s cock, Tony shivers as Steve picks up the pace, grabbing Tony’s hips and tilting them so that Steve gets the angle right.
The pig comes running back when it’s faced with officers with high voltage cattle prods, and a second toss of the shield knocks it out. They need to work faster than this, or all the animals they did knock out will wake up.
The keening sound that Tony makes when Steve takes his cock into his mouth is something he’ll never forget. He wants to hear that noise again, and again.
“I’ve been better, in all honesty. I feel like every time I complain about my life to you, and you just listen. I should be a better friend.”
“Then tell him to suit up. I’m bringing the party to you.” He can see the Avengers before him, with Bruce waiting. From video footage, he trusts that it will take no time at all for Bruce to transform. If the Hulk wouldn’t let Banner kill himself, he’s certainly not going to let it happen now.
As he makes his way outside, the wind hits his face like a million tiny pins. They press into his almost bare torso, and his exposed ass, reminding him what happened. The wet liquid between his cheeks is starting to freeze, but while it’s there, he can’t stop thinking of Steve.
It was all over the world. Every field, mountain, sea, and forest. Transferable by fluid, it was too easy to catch and had a high infection rate. Tony didn’t know the exact numbers, because if you weren’t responsive to the infection, you were
“What? I—”
As Tony starts to come down from his heat, he becomes more needy. Steve has spent hours kissing his omega, hands traveling down his supine form to rest at the juncture of Tony’s hips. He takes Tony slowly, the glide of his cock smoothed by slick and spend, his cock swollen with use as much as his own pleasure.
Maybe it’s not so bad that alphas can do that for their omegas sometimes. Perhaps he should cook for Tony, and that will help him see that it’s not as difficult as he’s made it out to be.
Tony pays for his drink and leads the Andorian out of the bar. One thing he learned early from this amazing Orion woman, was that you always bring them to your room, never anywhere else.
They had made love, in the end. Endless, passionate, encompassing. Their bodies were aching with use, the flex of their muscles a sweet pain to both of them. Steve’s cock was almost oversensitive and numb, and Tony’s insides couldn’t be much better. A contradiction to be sure, but that’s the closest description to what it felt like.
Bruce and Tony keep chatting in the lab. Tony remarks on how ridiculous the Captain is, but Bruce brushes it off, unwilling to get between anyone. Bruce is a better man than he is. This leads Tony to try and help him cope with his little green problem, but Bruce doesn’t take well to that either. It’s hard, because Tony does understand. He has the arc reactor, which is a great responsibility in and of itself.
Now comes the tricky part, which is getting the pill into the food without anyone noticing. He can’t do it in the tower, so he’s decided to eat at the restaurant. The waiter brings his dish and a bag with his and Tony’s food. He plops it in the booth next to him and proceeds to crack open the capsule and use his fork to stir it into the carbonara.
“I’ll be skulking around, but no, I leave the science to Mr. Stark and he leaves the fighting to me. Secret identity and all that.” He laughs, which sounds awkward through the modulator, but he isn’t sure what else to say about it. He feels out of sorts around Steve, like he’s guilty of something already. For the first time, his secret is weighing on him. Of all people to trust, if you can’t trust Captain America, then the cup is half empty in this world.
“Omega.” The command is just steps away from overwhelming, which he is almost hysterically grateful for.
Bucky grunts and thrusts, his irritation at Steve’s words wrapped inside his movements. Slowly, harshly, he starts fucking into Tony, every rough movement a sucking sound of fluid in Tony’s ass. Tony is so open and loose that he can barely feel his muscles clench at Bucky’s cock, but he knows when he comes, he’ll lock down on Bucky’s knot hard enough to keep it inside.
“I wasn’t aware of that, but it’s fine either way. I know you can’t help it.”
“Not like this, Steve,
“I’ll be seeing you, Tony.” Steve is shuffling, the tell-tale sound of pants going up legs, a zipper, and then the stretch of arms as a shirt goes over his head. Tony can’t watch. He can’t watch his Alpha walk away or it will break him. He’ll beg. He knows he would.
“I wouldn’t need to, likely. You handle that sort of thing well enough on your own.” Steve sets down his glass and he moves his hand to wrap around the glass in Tony’s and gently lifts it to his face, pressing the edge of the glass to Tony’s lips before tilting ever so slowly towards Tony’s mouth. He pulls it away after Tony takes a single swig, and raises it to his own mouth, hand still clutching Tony’s. He watches Tony’s eyelashes flutter as he traces the path up to Steve’s face. It’s a hungry look, cheekbones shadowed by the dimming light of the sunset, eyes lit from within like a supernova.
The next time Tony wakes up, he’s growling and vicious. Tony pounces on Steve, his teeth sinking into Steve’s shoulder in a crushing bite that would leave terrible marks on anyone else. Steve feels somewhat sad that the way Tony is bruising him now will disappear as if it had never been there at all. Tony claws at his chest, face twisted in a snarl, his eyes possessive.
He remembers Steve’s face after he fell from the sky, the sudden interest. The way Steve had stared at him across the table during their shawarma.
The thing is, all of these missions and general Avengers things would be fine if Tony’s heat weren’t a factor. He’s orchestrating his coming out as Iron Man to the public soon, the Avengers are all settled, his company’s stock is recovered from his cessation of weapons production, they’re the heroes of New York, and that social cache means something. The only thing is his heat. Which normally he’d drag his feet on, but he’s run out of suppressants, and he knows Fury isn’t going to give him more. So he’s resolved, -ish. He’s going to make a play for suppressants, but settle for a mediocre alpha-fuck. Everyone is happy, Tony can forget all about it, and life goes back to normal.
He rejoins Clint and Natasha and they all go back to SHIELD for debriefing. Fury doesn’t keep them long and by the time he’s done, it’s time for dinner. This should be a good thing, but today of all days he’s not looking forward to whatever disaster Tony presents to him.
“I spanked him. I never knew what it did to omegas, and how it was used. I controlled his finances, his whereabouts. It wasn’t even my money. I’ve never touched him besides the spankings. Never coerced him into sex. I wouldn’t do that.”
“Let’s go home.” Steve is gentle. Steve knows. How much Steve knows, should have worried him, but it’s
“I know, I know he’s more than deserving of a better husband. I know I’ve been cruel, wretched to him. And I regret it, every day. But I just don’t know why I feel the way I do. Please, if you have any insight at all, I need him—I don’t think I can do this, live in this world, without being able to be by his side. When I woke up, the only thing I had was this contract, and I didn’t even want it. I thought he was vain, flighty, insipid. But he’s none of those things. He’s strong, clever, indomitable of spirit. He’s fought against everything I’ve tried to do to him and never given in. Not really.” Iron Man pulls his hands up to his face, a very human gesture. He hears the metal click as his fingers slide down the sides.
All around him the city is chaos. People are staggering in the streets, their bodies shrinking and expanding, turning back into the sad sacks of flesh they were before.
“Ok, I’ve never actually been spanked in my life. Slapped, sure. But this is a new one for me.” Tony scrapes his hand through his hair as he stares down at Steve’s legs like they’re a spider he’s found crawling on the floor.
He catches her before using the repulsors on full blast to escape the range of the detonation, riding the blast radius out. The suit reads that the temperature is high, but not so high that Pepper will have any burns. He carefully presses her against the suit as he flies, the blasts loud enough to reverberate back his fear for losing Pepper. She could have been standing there, a second ago. Instead she’s safe in his arms, but what about the next time? He knows there will be a next time so long as she’s in his life.
“You know something.” It’s tossed out there by Nat like a grenade, and Steve has to remember to breathe, to push down the adrenaline rush.
, his mind thrummed, stretching tendrils of want at the idea of Steve taking him, making him happy.
It’s Tony who breaks the embrace, arms dropping to his sides, a bashful look upon his face. Tony has always been a beautiful olive tone, and with the hormones coursing through his system, he glows. It’s enough that Steve pulls him back into his arms again. Steve intends to keep Tony for a moment, and give him a peck on the cheek, but Tony turns his head at the last second.
“Come, Captain! We have lunch options.” In all the mess of escaping where he’d woken up and healing from his bites, he’d forgotten how fast his metabolism is and how great his energy needs are.
hauls itself forward, the sharp bite of its fingers grasping the suit, and the Iron Captain rises to meet it like a lover, holding tight, and then—
“As long as you don’t intend to override my primary protocol to protect your life, I will comply.”
“I’m a Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I think I’m qualified enough to say that he should have held his fire.” Tony can feel Cap’s breath on his forehead, they’re so close, and he can’t help it. His nostrils flare and take a drag of the air, hoping to catch Alpha scent, but Cap’s wearing the good suppressants, and he only gets a whiff of beta. And Cap— Cap returns the favor, tilting his head and leaning forward. Tony is frozen, his inherent drive as an Omega pressuring him to
. What are you– we– what can I do?”
“Don’t worry babe, I’ll make sure he treats you right. And after he’s done, we’ll have saved the best for last,” Bucky says. Steve growls at the other alpha, and Tony quakes. This is not what he had in mind, but he doesn’t see how he’s going to get away. He’s pretty certain he doesn’t want to. Is he a slut for wanting to be taken again by Bucky right after Steve finishes with him? Probably. He’s not good enough for either of them, but if this is what they want, and there isn’t much of a way out, he might as well enjoy it. He’s wanted Steve for so long, and his desire for Bucky is no different.
“It’s like, ever since Sunset and Ty died, I just can’t help but feel like they stole something I can’t get back. Like I’ve wasted all these years not confronting them about it only to miss out on my chance. They’re gone now, and there’ll never be recompense.”
The helmet peels apart under the onslaught, and Tony feels every drop of sweat and blood on his face, a warm brand that’s his only comfort as Steve brings the shield down, down, down onto his reactor. It slices his power supply in half, and Tony wants to scream at the unfairness of it, the helplessness he feels coursing through his body.
“Hey Steve.” Tony’s voice is cheery, and he hears all three of them behind him, Tony in the lead.
“Yes, you do.” The timbre of his voice was low and reverberating with unshielded
“You’re not here for a social call. You’re here for a conversation we’re going to have.”
“Did you have any plans for today?” Steve asks, hoping he can get Tony to spend some time with him. Maybe Steve can bring him food or other things he wants. He wants to primp Tony’s nest for him. What if he went back to the store and got more blankets. Would Tony like that?
.” Tony wanted Steve so bad, he got on his knees, ass straight in the air, elbows to the bed.
“I generally let omegas handle themselves.”
There’s a box in the middle of the bed, a bow wrapped neatly around it. Tony reaches for it, cutting the ribbon off with a deft claw, and opens it.
“Assuming you can get past the thousands of soldiers and ships.” With the sceptre clutched in his left hand, Loki looks feral as Tony meanders towards him. There’s nervousness inside the Asgardian, and Tony doesn’t think everything is as copacetic about this situation as Loki is playing it off to be. There’s something underneath all of this that Tony hasn’t yet pinpointed, but now that he’s looking for it, he’s starting to see the cracks.
“I wish it could be different than this. I’m sorry for that. But please, sweetheart, don’t worry. I’ll take care of you.”
“Ok, let’s do this. Come here blood-bag.” Tony snaps his fingers at Steve. “We don’t have time to separate the antibodies, so you’re going to just hang out and pump some blood to Clint. I’m locking you in, because if it doesn’t work, well, it doesn’t matter if he bites you, does it?”
“I’ve loved you for so long, and I want to love you for longer. Would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?” Tony sucks in a breath before it spills over him.
“If someone had asked me to bet on you, I would have bet against you. But something is different about you this past week. I don’t think it’s going to be a perfect journey, a perfect change, but you have done more than I expected.”
“Tony.” Pepper sounded chiding as she affixed the bow tie in the front.
Tony is left alone in the room. There’s trash everywhere, sheets and pillows ripped and empty water bottles loitering by the bedside on the table and floor.
Hulk smashes the front of the whale, causing a chain reaction along the animal’s spine as its head stays anchored to where the Hulk’s fist is impaled into it. It flips up, slowly, all the momentum it had running through its body flowing through it, and like a tree, begins to fall towards the Avengers.
“Hey, it’s no worry, Tony. It’s not your problem, and we’ll figure it out eventually. Hopefully sooner rather than later.”
Like a prisoner waiting for execution, he moves in slow motion towards the inevitable blade, turning his body so he can make eye contact with the ones who have destroyed his life. Above Tony’s lovely eyes, he meets those of Nat and Bucky, who look surprisingly subdued. Locking his eyes back on Tony, his Omega bounds over and latches onto Steve in an embrace that makes him shudder with relief.
It’s heaven, and Steve lets his head drop forward onto Tony’s thighs for a moment. There are no thoughts to collect, but he wants to make this good for Tony, so he tries to put himself back together, pulling his head back to look at the picture before him.
Tony’s trauma was the furthest thing from his mind. Steve was an
And battle it is.
It’s dark when Steve wakes up. Tony is a tangled pile of limbs next to him that’s shaking and shuddering. The cloying smell of slick rises up from the bed and permeates Steve’s senses. Steve feels unmoored, a lost ship floating, ghostlike over the water.
But he realizes she hasn’t when she presses the binder into his hands with an insistent look. And in her own clever, devious way, she’s letting the risk of a heat coming early push Tony into making a decision. If he didn’t admire her diabolical play, he’d be more angry. As it stands, he’s running out of time anyway, so he doesn’t comment on it.
“Oh-kay.” He lays into the device, blasting his repulsors at it.
Steve makes short work of Tony’s pants, which are already loose enough to slide off his hips with minimal resistance. His briefs fall with them, and Tony tries to cover himself with his hands, but Steve is quick to pull his wrists away, pinning them to Tony’s sides.
“Don’t do that, and I suppose you won’t be our problem anymore,” Clint affirms, putting the knife back inside one of his many pockets.
at his neck, snuffling in his ear with its rough nose. It steps off of him, its legs bracketing Tony’s sides. He doesn’t dare move.
“I accept. Copulation first.” Well, that was easy. Sometimes the universal translator he used didn’t exactly parse into slang, so often what Tony heard was more straightforward than what he would have gotten if he were interacting with humans. Oh humans. How he
“I thought I was doing the right thing. At the time it felt— it felt like the truth would burden you, drag you down with me, and I was headed towards death. Tainting our relationship with that— the future we thought we’d have, I just couldn’t destroy it. Do you understand? It’s all I’ve wanted, to be with you, for our own reasons.” He looked away towards the fires, the sounds of sirens piercing the air from all directions. If he wanted to get technical, he’d caused this. By making the suit, by being Iron Man, he’d caused the arms race to the perfection of the arc reactor. If he kept going, eventually something would come that he couldn’t defeat, drawn in by the lure of power his inventions represented. It was impossible to stop; it’s inevitable that he dreams he’d never started on this path. The one that was taking him away from Pepper, from all intimate relationships.
him to help in any capacity.
“Come to tell me to stop projecting my wild beliefs on everyone?” Tony turns around and looks at his best friend. Really looks at him.
Instead, Steve is sitting here reading over lengthy legal documents that bind him, an alpha, to an omega.
“Wow. That’s– wow. Stevie…” His friend is picking at his food, his mouth opening and closing like he wants to say more, but can’t. Steve can’t say that Bucky would never judge him, but at the very least Bucky would keep his secrets. It makes him sag against the back of the booth in relief.
“Jesus fuck.” The air on his exposed ass is cold, but worse is the discomfort of it, the exposure and vulnerability. He has no idea what’s going on, but this has passed the range of wild animal and is treading into sentient cryptid territory. He has no idea what this
“And that’s it?” Seems easier than expected.
“How much are you willing to part with it for?”
“Fuck, Steve, I’m yours, I—” Steve sweeps forward and kisses him once more, lapping up Tony’s admittance. Tony mumbles something against his lips, and Steve pulls back just that much to hear it.
“Yeah, sweetheart. Meet you down there soon?” Gently, he prises Tony’s arms off, holding the other man’s hands in his own and circling his thumbs over the delicate skin before letting them fall.
“And not scold me about drinking? Who are you and what have you done with Mr. Self-righteous?” Captain looks exceedingly calm. It’s killing his vibe of being worry-free.
He navigates to the side of one of the armored whales and starts to laser into its hull.
“Don’t compliment them. They’ll get ideas.” His wings shudder in an undignified huff, like they heard him speak, and didn’t like what Tony had to say.
“Here is fine.”
“Yeah well,” he stares off into the distance, unwilling to contradict his friend’s misguided opinion. “I’m going to go try in the forest while I take a piss.”
“No more spankings.” Steve shuffles from foot to foot.
Steve decides to stick as closely to the truth as possible.
“As much as you putting Tony in the hospital is an accident.”
The burning is turning into dull throbbing, and he knows he’s bleeding now. Steve wouldn’t be moving so smoothly otherwise.
. It’s torture being impaled on Steve’s cock like this without any extra stimulation, and he reaches for his own cock, trying to ride the arousal he feels at his ass being so full of Steve. He can’t even contemplate what it will be like to have Bucky in his mouth at the same time. It’s so much.
“Can you please just try? If not me, for Tony?”
“Wait, I’m confused. Was it me who hit you? What right do you have to come in here and demand my forgiveness? I owe you
The Captain tries to stop him, but Tony can’t lose the one person who knows where the Tesseract is. If it’s gone, if Loki escapes to complete whatever use he has for the item, it’s game over.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Steve says. He doesn’t know what else there is to say otherwise. Steve would never force himself on Tony.
“Captain, what can I do for you?”
Fury holds the bag delicately, while Tony glares at the package. He’s already been outed as caring too much, what was one more mistake?
Steve plops a newspaper in front of Tony instead as he shuffles around the kitchen preparing breakfast. Rolling with it, Tony picks up the news and spies something that might be interesting under the second fold. He flips it open to look, and staring back at him is Aldrich Killian, found dead in his penthouse early this morning by his assistant. The article is scant on details, but it’s already making Tony’s blood run cold.
He’s anything but angry about it. Shouldn’t he be angry? He can’t think anymore. Groaning, he presses back again against Steve. The Alpha unhooks his legs from Tony’s, and kneels back. Tony twists his head around to get a better look and almost whines again with how lovely the Captain looks like this.
“It’s fine. If you want to be sorry, just don’t do anything like that to your omega.” Trevor’s eyes are hard, accusatory.
Otherwise, Tony seems to be vibrating with energy. Steve will have to make sure he works out to burn some of that off, because they won’t be engaged in anything together that will help. It makes him wonder if he should offer Tony his body to help with the instability omegas feel when they’re undersexed, but he thinks the other changes will be sufficient to put a damper on Tony’s more promiscuous behavior.
That hand, the one on his thigh that’s burning a hole into his skin, starts to move, sliding down to the soft interior of his thigh and upwards towards his groin.
“Get that thing out of me or I’m going to stick this repulsor so far up your ass, you’ll look like a Vorothian whale when I’m done with you.”
He never got a chance to test whether he could escape, because the doors busted open once again, and Steve had a flashback to Clint, hoping it wasn’t the archer again, though not really thinking about who else it could possibly be.
“You’re right, but—I don’t know why I do that?” He searches his heart, but he’s too nervous to come up with any explanation.
The next morning, the front page of the paper shows a picture of Sunset and the sensationalist headline that she’d been murdered in her bed the night before. It hits him like sinking into a too-hot bath. His skin is crying out against the incursion of emotion, and it burns, it burns, it burns. Until it’s numb.
“And why would I give up your sweet, tight ass? I have everything I want.” Fuck. It hurts, and Tony wants to cry. But he also doesn’t want to give Steve the satisfaction.
Mercy? He’ll have Tony begging before this is out.
After they land on the carrier, Tony tries to discreetly make off so he can remove the suit and be on time for whatever meeting they’re having about Loki. He’s also having trouble keeping his mouth shut around Cap. This is a strategic retreat, or so he tells himself.
“JARVIS, delete all evidence regarding my little trips to and from the suit.” He steps into it, feeling integrated with himself once more. Iron Man is what belonging feels like.
When he thinks about his explanations for why he’s in this situation, they start to feel like excuses. He should have done something different, gotten help. There were ways to get Tony to comply without doing this. He should have pursued those options. That’s what the internet is for, right? He’s let his fear of new technology and the sensation of being out of time to prevent him from getting help. He could have asked his team. Their secondary genders aren’t known to him, but they would have been able to at least point him in the right direction.
“Afraid? Is that what you think this is? God, I know I can’t make you like me, but just once I’d love for you to shut up about not liking me.”
The whale floats towards him, body undulating and almost graceful. It’s maw opens wide, saliva sticking to its teeth as it shrieks at him, and Tony dives into its darkness. As he does, he releases several missiles from his legs, shredding through what counts as a digestive system for an alien.
Tony isn’t unsympathetic to those who want Extremis full-time. Well, he is lacking in empathy, but he knows how to play a crowd. They want more free Extremis. Tony wants more addicts for his product so they spend more money. He can make it happen, easily.
“You should let him go, your omega. He deserves better than you. We all deserve better than you. We’re leaving.” Trevor stands up and takes Angela’s hand, helping her stand.
“Fine. Well, you claim to be a genius then, so where is Loki.”
“What you don’t want is to be kicked out of SHIELD. If you didn’t want to harm Tony, you’d stop with your senseless insistence that he be something he’s not. He’s a person, not an object.” Her words echoed Tony’s.
Tony is looping and diving, using his ability to maneuver to smash the less able speeders into buildings. Even if he clips just a few of them, they fall from the sky. Unlike any decent human being, the Chitauri make no effort to save their fallen brethren.
“Be gentle with him,” Natasha’s eyes are hard on Steve. “We’ve all had a rough go of it, watching our friends and co-workers succumb to this. He doesn’t need one more thing that he’s going to lose. So whatever you do, you will remain on good terms with him.”
“Sweetie pie, I already own their ass.” Tony scoffs at Steve.
“I understand.”
Moments like these always make Tony wonder how, and why, they were drift compatible. But truly, it was the nights spent in Steve’s arms, waiting for the next battle, the next time where there might be no others after, that told Tony the truth: they were of one soul.
“But you were like them.”
“Then leave a message urgently—” The elevators open, revealing Coulson with a phone in hand.
The Vendorian chitters—god, this universal translator is
“Clean me.” Steve takes the fingers into his mouth and sucks the spend off of them, then he takes Tony’s sticky and flaccid cock into his mouth, licking away the remnants of lube and come. He mouths at the fluid that’s made its way down Tony’s balls, feeling the sting of humiliation at the cool and bitter flavor.
“But he’s not capable.”
“JARVIS?”
“We both want you. We thought—well, we thought we could see who you’d pick, without telling you what we wanted. Let you choose on your own.” Bucky starts to gesture at Tony, but cuts himself off and drops his hand, before reaching back up and tugging at his ear.
“I’ll be so good, please—”
“Baby,
Something is wrong.
“I can go out and find them, bring them back.”
This is step two.
He doesn’t regret his decision. He won’t.
Not that Steve would do that to him. Would he?
Tony comes out wearing an understated heather grey suit with large, light blue plaid lines, and a powder blue shirt with a light blue silk tie. It’s a good contrast with his navy suit. He notes that Tony is wearing what looks like Keds or plimsolls, and Steve almost opens his mouth to say something about it before Tony levels him a look as though he knows exactly what Steve is going to say.
“He hasn’t hurt me! But he’s just as bad as you are, trying to screw around with me, with my head. I know I seem… promiscuous, but that time of my life is over. I won’t stand for being jerked around.” Tony feels vindicated as he finishes and watches Bucky’s face change from angry, to wary, to somewhat chastened.
Steve was never good at following orders, and if he could have snuck away, he would have. But he’d learned all about Bruce’s little green problem, and he didn’t think he could just sneak by. On the list of rules were Don’t Make Bruce Angry along with Don’t Touch Tony’s Coffee Stash Upon Pain Of Death and the newest rule, Feed Steve Three Times A Day, Or Else. He didn’t have to like all the rules, but he liked some.
"I'm sure," Steve stared into those dark eyes like he was talking to them.
"Because that's what triggers the parasite," Bruce said, "You haven't had any violent reactions to anyone else. Not even Fury. Your brain imaging shows a strange kind of activity when you try to resist it." Bruce handed Tony a tablet with the records.
"And why for the love of god, not Thor, by the way, do I have to spend more time with a man I tried to murder three days ago?" Tony blurted out. Steve let his arms down, pursing his lips.
"Is he going to be okay?" Steve said through his dry lips. He hadn't been sleeping or eating. Tony had been unconscious for 24 hours now. The rest of the Avengers had arrived and to no one's surprise, Fury was there. He wasn't talking to Steve or Bruce.
The last chapter. Feel free to share your thoughts.
Steve felt as if his soul had just flown back into his body. He got on his feet, ready to go see Tony, but Fury grabbed his arm.
Steve just stared at his feet.
"He just ran away?" Fury was staring one Avengers startled face to the other, "Did no one care to keep an eye on him?"
"Tony," There was something about the way Steve's lips chanted his name that made him look up, "You need to trust us. Trust yourself. Hiding away won't save us."
"Umm, Tony," Bruce smiled, "I was just telling Cap…"
"Mmmm, Cap," Tony moaned, "Did I apologise for the time I threw you against the wall?"
"You don't have to see Bucky," Steve said, looking away, "Here, we can spend some time together without me getting choked by you."
"Does he follow you everywhere now?" Fury raised an eyebrow, "I'd say let someone scan you for trackers."
"I wish you the best, son!" Fury patted his shoulder.
"Stark," Fury's expressions were oddly sympathetic, "You are fine, now, but we'll have to keep you in that chamber. I'm sorry."
Steve Rogers didn't know how to give up. He never gave up on his missions, and he wasn't going to give up on Tony Stark. Not after having stared so deeply into those brown eyes. Not after seeing he never thought he'd see in his eyes. Steve couldn't tell what it was, but he knew it was something he'd been searching for a long time.
This, he thinks, is divinity. It’s what god must feel like.
“Okay. I’m sorry. Please don’t—just. If you’re going to punish me, let’s get this over with.” Tony walks forward like he’s on a pirate’s plank. The expression on his face is unimpassioned, drained of personality.
“Would you have accepted me as your Alpha otherwise?”
“Thank you, that’s kind of you to do this on such short notice. I just want to know what happened to them.”
“—well that’s fine, because I love to be handed things, so let’s trade?” Pepper attempts to hand him the binder and he dodges.
“Mr. Stark.” Agent Coulson looks harried as he strolls over. Which the man is unflappable, so Tony’s instinct is to suss out what’s wrong. But since SHIELD is coming to him, he’s got to play hard to get, regardless of where he stands with the intelligence agency.
“While I can’t see inside your body sir, your outside is clear. The soap is caustic to biological material. You may experience a rash on parts of your body. Estimates on absorption of Omega uteruses give you about an hour before complete absorption of any leftover materials. Though less strict studies have shown up to three hours.”
“If this paperwork is correct, it’s a foregone conclusion.” Steve taps the sheets scattered on the table, sliding them together as though he’s getting ready to leave.
“Such a
“He loves you, you know. Would do anything for you.”
“The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.” Tony checks what Thor has said and sees that the machine is encased in a forcefield. It’s self sustaining, he suspects, and might be nigh impossible to stop. His stomach drops to the bottom of his gut. If they can’t stem the tide, there’s no way they can hold off for even another half hour while the military gets here.
Steve knows what Tony wants him to say, and he won’t say it. It’s the line he’s drawn.
“You had dinner alone, yes?”
“Admit it darling, and I’ll stop.” Steve doesn’t say when he’ll stop, which is after he’s good and ready, his knot locking in the copious amount of cum he has waiting for Tony. The knot increases expulsion of sperm in spades, and it’s nothing compared to a regular orgasm without a knot.
“Tony, please—”
Tony skips learning about those, but it picks at him.
But he wasn’t. Not today. Not now.
The next push causes Tony to sputter, head twisting left and right in an attempt to escape the sensation. Steve gives no quarter, slowly, but methodically, thrusting in and out of his sweet Omega.
“And you’ll leave Bucky out of it.”
“Don’t bother mentioning it.”
Bucky wanted. He doesn’t know if he could do it. It’s one thing to be shared with Steve, but anyone else sounds better in his mind as just an idea rather than a reality.
“What if this is it? What if I turn into an Omega?” Steve turns around, delighted that Tony is asking this question of his own accord. Tony doesn’t spare a glance for Steve’s arousal.
“I’ll bench you Tony. I’ll sit you down on the sidelines—” Cap was in his face now, skin red and brows furrowed.
“Don’t you talk about Howard like you know a thing about him at all. And frankly, your idea of getting a handle on my life sounds invasive and downright barbaric. No one treats omegas like you’re talking about these days. Get with the times, Rogers. We’ll be a laughing stock if you don’t.” Tony’s mouth pinches into a downward sneer as he talks.
It’s then that Tony realizes he’s in the lordosis pose. Somewhere along the line, his knees had come up, hips tilted to present to Steve. He wonders if he’s soaked through his jeans. He hopes he has, and that Steve can smell it on him, how much he wants the Alpha. How good he’ll be for him.
They’re at a charity gala for some obscure artist’s fund for orphans in Brooklyn, an affair close to Steve’s heart. And Tony will do just about anything for Steve. Their dynamic is already interesting enough, but Tony has always preferred interesting over expedient.
Without being asked, Iron Man drops down next to him.
“Hanging in there Tony?” Bruce stumbled into the kitchen, pajama pants slung low on his hips and congealing at the ankles, empty mug tilted precariously in his hand.
"I, Tony, take thee, Steve, to be my wedded husband.” The justice starts. Tony is staring off into space, hands fiddling with something in his pockets.
Steve wakes up to the sound of screaming.
Tony thrashes, a deep shudder rolling through his whole body. He hunches forward, body rigid.
It takes all that he has.
“Studies show that it doesn’t help an omega! It only hurts us! We’re people with needs just like alphas, not windup
“Yes. I really have to. Not doing so was making me unhappy.”
“Lunchtime already? Do I have to make something?”
He’s exhausted when he gets back to the tower, and he doesn’t go check on Tony, because he knows he’s not ready to apologize in the way Tony needs. He has to think about what he’s going to say, to make sure it’s perfect.
“Want to fuck you, Tony.” Steve looks down at the picture of Tony before him. The man is stripped but for his shirt, and he’s utterly beautiful even in the harsh lighting. Every patch of olive skin is smooth and it slides over lean muscle as Tony wriggles in place.
He remembers Tony’s squirming, and the deepest shame comes over him. He’s thought about Tony like that. Wanted it. Just like Conall. He can hardly stomach himself. What kind of man is he? What kind of alpha?
“Sounds reasonable. This Iron Man is a consultant then? Not a SHIELD operative?”
“Things have changed when it comes to dressing up, Captain. It’s cool to pair sleek with casual. Besides, this is a judgment-free zone. I demand it.”
Steve needs tomorrow. Tomorrow is critical. He has to fix this.
“Understood, Director. I’ll do my best to take care of him.” Steve is dismissed then, and he heads home, thinking of what he’s going to say to Tony. He has so much to apologize for. As he descends the stairs he prepares what he’s going to say. He knows that perhaps it has no bearing on the outcome of their relationship. Perhaps he should let Tony go. It kills him, but he’s considering it.
“Please Alpha? Need you.” Tony’s heat is eating him alive, hot coils of lust encircling his mind, trapping him. Pleasure was just beyond it, waiting in Steve’s arms. He needed closer,
“Yes, of course I do. He’s… he’s pretty amazing. Did you know he developed software for the Omega Support Network? And he donates to charities often.”
Tony gasps around Steve’s member as Bucky abruptly shoves three fingers inside, driving straight for Tony’s sensitive prostate and rubbing. It’s abrupt, sending lighting strikes up and down his spine and frissons of electricity throughout his limbs. He jerks in time with each swipe and soon Steve’s cock is laying in Tony’s limp mouth as he simply breaths around it.
They walk into Tony’s living room, Rogers and the abominable teen trailing behind him.
“Whatever you’re doing to keep Stark in line, keep doing it.” Fury is happy. Disturbingly so.
“Six, thank you.” It continues like that until all twenty-three slaps have been delivered, and Tony is whining and humping at Steve’s leg. He’s not going to punish what seems to be a natural reaction, but he’s not pleased by it either. His omega is wanton, immodest. But ultimately an omega should be able to want their alpha, so he’s got to let this slide.
Steve doesn’t leave him hanging; he spreads firm fingertips to the stratum of his back, Tony’s shoulder blades and spine providing rigid geography that corrals Steve’s movements. Ever so soft, Steve starts to press in, searching out knots. Tony groans when he finds them, helplessly grinding his hips down. It’s heaven.
There’s a little smile swimming on Bucky’s lips and the distinct outline of his cock pressed against the towel he’s wearing. Tony looks down in askance, but Bucky holds a hand out to stop him from moving closer.
Now, Tony is strapped into a machine that he might never come unstuck from. It’s absurd for Steve to even try, but if it were Clint, Natasha would be doing the same.
“Natasha? It’s Steve.” He paused, waiting for her to say that she didn’t want his call or that he was barking up the wrong tree, whatever it was that he wanted.
He should be happy.
Steve’s laughter echoes and frolics merrily through Tony’s mind. As if it hears their conversation,
“Ok, well talk. Tell me off for doing what I’m doing. Scold me. Make it scathing. I like it rough, baby.” Tony walks around the bar and sits on the top of the couch, one leg pulled up and the other still on the ground.
. And I sure hope it’s not a super zombie, because that would really suck a fat one.” Steve doesn’t know these references at all, but he figures out the meaning of the latter.
“So yeah, what are they doing in the clean energy business without Tony?” Banner, who is a true broseph, backs him up.
“Where is he? I want to see him now.” Steve acquiesces and turns to take Rhodes to their room. Showing his back to the other man is a calculated risk, but Steve thinks that Tony’s friend knows the stakes. He wouldn’t dare attempt to kill Steve if it could kill Tony.
he’s not an old man anymore. Not that Steve’s jawline didn’t look equally cutting when he was ninety-five, and Tony is not ashamed to say he could be attracted to an older man. Besides, Extremis would have fixed that. But look, he doesn’t even have to do anything and Captain America is back to being Captain Handsome!
“Wait, you know about my classes?”
“I see she died in 1974. That’s not that young, but not too old either?” It’s not perfect, but it’s better than Brenna’s life.
“I want Tony Stark.” It’s a Wednesday, bright and unmemorable but for the fact that Tony is out of town.
“Clint trusts me. If it were up to him, he’d never forgive you. Intervention is necessary.”
“I’m a SHIELD shadow, and part of the Avengers Initiative. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury to help.” Tony’s ass, that’s all she’s there for. He’s about checked out of this, but relishes condescending to the person who lied to him and to Pepper.
“Um, yes, but many have starved. They won’t eat each other until there’s nothing else to consume. There’s no reason I can tell why they turn on one of their own kind, but eventually, they do. It’s—it’s hard to remember they’re people. My employees.” Tony’s eyes focus on some distant point across the room, and Steve can’t imagine what that must be like. He had one interaction with the woman in the room he’d been placed in, and that was enough. Even though he didn’t know her, he thinks he’ll see her in his nightmares.
“Is that what just happened?” Steve grumbles, and Tony swivels around.
“Finally, someone who speaks English!” Banner is a gem. The man’s a genius after Tony’s own heart.
Tony would grumble and whine, but acquiesce like the darling Omega he is. And then Steve will placate him with a knot. It’s the perfect vision.
Steve shrugs the top on, buttoning quickly. The pants go next, and he tucks the shirt in. Sports jackets have always been difficult for him with his broad shoulders, but this fits him perfectly snug. He wonders where Tony got his measurements from. Lastly, he ties the navy silk tie around his neck and steps back to check himself in the mirror. He could use some cufflinks, but he can pick those up tomorrow.
After he has Tony, he can make it up to the Omega. He’ll let Tony do whatever he so desires, as long as he agrees to belong to Steve.
He sucks in a breath. Steve. God.
Which reminded him that the Avengers were not only still miffed that he’d hidden his identity, but they didn’t like the big reveal he was planning either. Clint had known Iron Man was Tony already, that was obvious. So it was more accurate to say that the most, maybe the only person besides Bruce, that was disappointed had been the Captain. Tony got a special kick out of making him a little sad. Uppity little Omega that he was, putting on the big, bad, and dangerous suit and kickin’ it with the rest of the Alpha and assassin heroes. Yeah, Tony loved watching him swallow that one.
“And when do you plan to bond?” The pen scribbles away on the clipboard while Steve imagines Tony in the office with him, getting sassy with the doctor. It makes his lips curl up in a small smile as he crosses his arms and gazes at the wall displaying Omega reproductive organs.
He wonders too what happened to Brenna and Colleen. He thinks it’s time he goes back to the church. Maybe they know more about the omegas that lived in the area at the time. Nat didn’t ask him about his homework to find three omegas he admired either, so he assumes that next time they’ll go over it. Steve hasn’t had much time to really think about it, but he thinks Edith is on his list. He’s never met someone so strong, except for maybe Tony. Is it wrong to put Tony on the list? Tony still has a laundry list of flaws, mostly related to his sleeping around.
The third, he catches in hand and squeezes, ever so gently. Which is not at all forgiving for the average human. Rhodes grits his teeth and begins to pull back, looking to wind up and batter at Steve again, no doubt. They struggle for a moment, or rather, Rhodes struggles and Steve stands there, implacable. Finally the other man pulls back from Steve, shaking his fist out, but never losing the expression of utter betrayal and contempt.
Tony doesn’t lick at all before he bites down, hard. Steve is used to pain, however, and doesn’t let himself mind it, since small acts of rebellion are all Tony will get at this point.
Tony’s mouth is on his then, for the briefest of moments, and Steve chases it when Tony pulls away, much to the Omega’s delight.
It doesn’t even take him a second to reply.
Which is right when Tony seized. His back arched off the bed they’d placed him on, his breath coming in quick pants as his left shoulder jerked and his eyes fluttered. Steve went to hold him down, but Bruce smacked away his hands.
“I’m trying to understand, I am. I think I know the specific things I did were wrong, but when I look at omegas, all I see is someone to be protected, and that doesn’t feel wrong to me.” Steve shifts in his seat and tries not to look at Natasha to see what she’s thinking about all this. Her face is as impassive as usual.
He barely caught Steve’s hands as the other man reached out to touch the armor.
When he feels Steve’s cockhead pressing at his entrance, he whines from behind Steve’s hand. It nudges at him, again and again, and Steve once more spits on the rim of his ass, rubbing it up his dick and down around Tony’s entrance. It gives him an inch or so in, but it burns. No effort was made to prep him.
He slams into the ren-faire blond with all of his repulsors at maximum, skidding the man across the forest floor.
“Hey big guy.” Now he knows he shouldn’t feed it, but it’s rather cute, and doesn’t seem to be afraid of him. It also looks like it’s alone, which is odd in and of itself. Wolves run in packs, but this guy doesn’t have anyone with him.
Steve is at the man’s side before Tony can get him too.
“Thank you,” Steve says in a rush of relief.
“Thank us by changing your behavior.” Yes. He’s going to make sure that he does this right. He wants to do the right thing. It’s so important for him as well as for Tony, so that this doesn’t happen again.
Steve grasps Tony’s cock and starts to pump it in time with his hips that are snapping into Tony at a ferocious pace. The muscles in his channel are fighting for and against the intrusion, aching so sweetly with effort to clench on a knot. Steve hikes up Tony’s legs so that Tony’s knees are by his head, and proceeds to pull his entire length out before slamming it back in with exquisite accuracy. Tony looks down to see Steve’s slick cock as he pulls it out before it disappears once more. Steve is beautiful, his abdominal muscles clenched together with effort, his chest tight, and arms tense. His lovely face is all that Tony can see. All that Tony wants to see.
He and Banner are chatting amiably before Steve walks in at the worst time. Tony’s just shocked Banner with a prod, testing a theory that the Hulk can determine real danger vs. stimuli usually associated with danger. He’s right of course. Banner is fine. But Cap doesn’t seem to think so.
He leaves the church feeling even more off balance. Everywhere he’s gone, he’s met resistance for what he’s done to Tony. The whole world is telling him that he needs to move. But Steve has planted himself like a tree beside the river of truth, and has told the world “No, you move.” And the world, in its way, has borne down further on him.
“Fuck, no, that’s– no. Steve, please. Not this way.” Begging is gratifying, especially from his untamed Omega. Steve is looking forward to hearing his pleas more often, in a different capacity.
But like a magnet, he can’t stay away from the Cap as he sees the man single handedly taking on an entire squadron of Chitauri on his own. He blasts through several of the screeching humanoids before lining up his repulsors to Cap’s shield. Automatically bracing himself, Cap takes Tony’s bursts of energy like a champ, using them to eradicate the next wave of combatants.
“—I can’t stay.” He waves a hand at them.
“No problem. Thanks again, for listening.” Steve has a lot to go over in his mind.
When he arrives, for the first time he doesn’t go looking for Tony. He realizes he can’t bear the rejection he’ll receive from his husband. Somewhere along the way, he’s thought that maybe they could have an actual marriage. That maybe it was a mistake to promise himself and Tony that he’d stay away. Now he’s locked into his own words, and he won’t renege on them, but he can’t help but feel hope. Without it, there’s nothing good left.
Steve petted his wings, hands dragging down the soft pinions before he swept back up to the top to start over again. Tony let out a shameless groan before freezing in place. He’d closed his eyes, but now he’s snapped them back open to meet Steve’s.
"I can work with that. JARVIS," Tony looked up, "crank the tunes. I got nine minutes."
Tony groans softly, reaching down to his swollen ankle. Why the hell did he think this was a good idea? There are a hundred excellent gyms and workout centers in the city, but Tony just had to disconnect. He should have known better than to go jogging in a hiking trail so close to sunset.
“Excuse me?” Tony deadpans, setting the glass down rather roughly on the bar top.
“Okay. Okay Tony, get a grip,” he exhales and turns the razor on. “Maybe you just...missed a spot?” Tony laughs at that and shakes his head, looking back in the mirror. “No, even I’m not dumb enough to believe that one.”
The quickness with which Tony reacted to the demand brought a smile to Steve’s face. He was able to slide his hand into place, fingers slowly stroking at Tony’s tight hole before pushing one in. The spit wasn’t much, but Tony had taken a lot more with less before, he was sure two fingers wouldn’t ruin him for the night’s activities.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where’s the pizza?” He steps further from the door and looks around, sniffing the air, but the room is empty, void of anyone or anything that would smell as good as what Tony smells.
“I’m coming right now. I’ll be there very soon.”
Sleep is even harder to achieve, the moon growing fuller with every night that passes. He stares from his bed, floor to ceiling windows allowing for maximum amount of light to shine in, reminding Tony of his impending fate, until finally he grows angry, gets up and yanks the drapes shut.
The brunet avoided eye contact, but did sink to his knees; knowing exactly what Steve wanted. Somehow it was what he wanted too, although he didn’t dare to steer his thoughts deeper into what drove him to want what Steve wanted. At least not right now.
“Get to the point, Lassie. I’m feeling my blood pressure begin to rise again.”
There’s a snarling coming from the animal, one that suggests something incredibly unfriendly, the animal’s posture suggests that he’s ready to pounce. Tony doesn’t stick around long enough to find out what the wolf’s motives are as his hand finds a large rock, Tony picks it up and chucks it at the animal, hitting it square in the head.
Tony scoffs, standing up finally and stretching out. He turns back to the bar top to down the rest of the liquid in the glass. He knows it won’t do anything for him, but it still tastes pretty great. “If you think you won’t need to use those little tricks on me again, then you clearly don’t know me very well.”
“Hello? Is anyone here? Anyone at all here to see me like this?”
When Tony finally makes his way out into the kitchen, stopping in the bathroom along the way to answer nature’s call, he finds the small table covered edge to edge with breakfast food. It’s more than enough to feed a small army, or a pack of wolves, and Tony thinks maybe Steve’s expecting more guests, but then his stomach growls and he thinks, yeah he could eat at least half of this.
Tony sits up slowly, the blood rushing from his head and he crawls his way across the room to his dresser where he knows he left his phone
“I can help you. The senses, the anger, I can help you understand it, control it.” Steve's gripping the front of Tony’s shirt now, desperate and pleading.
No. Tony hates this. This doesn’t make sense. Tony, the scientist, the engineer, the physicist always looking for an explanation, for the logic behind things, this doesn’t make sense to him. His life isn’t a crappy science fiction movie, he's the head of a multi-billion dollar technology company, not a newly turned…whatever. Tony can’t even say it in his mind, it's too absurd.
Tony continues his own journey to his office where, behind closed doors, he can tuck his non-existent tail between his legs, and lick his metaphorical wounds in private.
Steve smirked, “how can you be so sure if you haven’t even checked?”
“I-I’m sorry. I…need you.”
Tony looks away from the door to Happy who's making his way over.
“Tony,” Pepper repeats, calling for Tony’s attention as she places her hand on top of Tony’s own, stilling his fingers.
Once those were arranged, Steve held his arms out and Tony embraced him. They shared a brief kiss, before Steve offered his arm on the way out the door.
“I feel it too, Tony. You're constantly pulling away, avoiding me, it’s straining our bond. It’s not natural for either of us.”
A quick scan of Tony's calendar and JARVIS replied. "No Sir, I believe he's here on personal matters."
Then it hits him, the most glorious smell in the world. It’s the scent of pizza, no, not just any pizza. It’s the pizza from Tony’s favorite hole-in-the-wall shop, Little Angela’s. The scent is so strong, and it drags Tony right out of his seat, stomach grumbling in desire as he heads toward the door, fully expecting to see boxes of pizza when he opens it.
Tony's heart rate was significantly elevated this morning, but that was most likely due to the three cups of coffee consumed in the last ninety-two minutes. Any more and JARVIS might've short circuited the outlet the machine was plugged into.
JARVIS, being the very intelligent program that he was, knew the routine already. He was already crafting a perfectly worded cancellation notice when Tony spoke up.
Half the cup of coffee is gone before Tony even sits down, and he really should give that woman a raise, because wow that's a good cup of coffee. But he has avoided this enough, he has to dig into that folder.
Tony considered this a moment, "do I have a meeting scheduled with him?"
“So no one can hear me scream?” Tony asks, eyebrow raised.
Tony’s tongue wrapped around Steve’s thumb sucking it clean before pulling back. Defiance flickered in his his gaze, and malice filled his tone as he replied. "To listen and follow what you say, Commander Rogers."
Tony clutches his chest, right where Steve’s hand had been, unable to admit even to himself how that look hurts him more than it hurt Steve.
Before he slipped his hand anywhere, Steve needed to get his fingers wet. And since he refused to travel with lube in his pocket, Tony’s mouth would have to do. He reached up to brush his knuckles against Tony’s cheek again. Tony leaned into the soft affection, eyes locked on Steve as Steve’s knuckles dragged closer toward his lips.
It takes a moment, a very long moment, but he’s able to calm himself down, and he’ll have to remember this tactic for the next time. Steve and his smile, so friendly and sincere. Steve with his wildly unrealistic claims of being a werewolf, and the way he made the noise in Tony’s head stop with a single grip of his shoulder.
Tony knew an order when he heard one, so he turned on his heel and hurried to coat check.
Tony makes a break for the open door, wanting to be free of this building’s confines, wanting to run under the moon’s light. Steve grabs the wolf up as he darts past and throws him toward the couch.
Tony can only focus on his breathing then. All thoughts of stocks and designs melt away in favor of the feel of the sun on his back, the wind through his hair. Idly, Tony wonders why he’s never done this before, and he vows to repeat this action at least once a week from now on. For someone who doesn’t spend much time working out, it takes Tony quite a while to start to feel the burn in his legs and chest, but even then he pushes on, that itch below the surface still there. And maybe it’s Tony’s fault. He lets his brain turn back on for even a split second, wonders when Pepper rescheduled the meeting to, and his foot catches an uprooted tree part. He doesn’t have the chance to catch himself as he’s plummeting face first into the dirt trail, his yelp of pain echoes through the trees scaring off some birds.
Tony quirked an eyebrow and glanced over at Steve, “isn’t that usually my line?”
Steve sang his praises for a few minutes before Tony began to resurface. Steve knew this because he began to move a little more. He made a few sounds too, not quite words, but suggestions that he was back.
Tony’s face went beet red, but before he could argue the driver had the door pulled open. Steve stepped out first, he tucked a bill into the driver’s hand and turned to wait for Tony. Tony, still rumpled, face flushed, pants open stepped out after, and averted his eyes.
Tony scoffs and closes the lid on the bottle, “well maybe if you hadn’t bitten me a month ag-“ Steve cuts him off with an angry bark of his name, Tony does not flinch at the sound of Steve’s voice, but he did shut up abruptly, his entire focus on Steve.
“Stop talking,” Tony said through gritted teeth.
As Tony scrubs soap into his hair, he absently realizes what his brain had been ignoring all morning. Tonight is the full moon. Tony curses himself for even thinking about something so ridiculous and rinses his hair off.
