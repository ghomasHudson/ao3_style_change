"It's weird, watching you interact like that."
"Out of my way, Cas! You're blocking me from my true love!" Dean shouts. Cas sticks his foot out as Dean bounds past him, causing him to stumble into the wall and turn with a mock-growl. "Okay, okay. You're my true love, not pie. But c'mon, we're going to miss it!"
Adrenaline pumping cheerily through his body as though he's not about to die, Sam stares down the hellhound. Distantly, he notes that he can see the hellhound without the use of any kind of device to see it- a fact which would probably be way more important if not for the fact that he's about to die. The hellhound is snarling, glaring at Sam as Andy disappears inside the Elysian Fields hotel, but it doesn't move toward him.
He climbs in the other side and turns his back to Cas. Cas slides up behind him and wraps his arms around him.
"Then I can't do it. Because there is no way I'd be able to fit something of that size into my body."
He turns toward Mary and grins menacingly, flexing his hand out toward her and gesturing upward. Mary begins sliding slowly up the wall toward the ceiling as everyone near her stares in horror.
"Wait a second, Sam, you've still got one less person. Pick three," Charlie orders.
Sam nods and sneaks off, pleased to note his hunter instincts are still intact. He stops at the table to pick up the entire carton of ice cream Gabriel left, and begins working it with a scoop so it will fall out over Gabriel's head. Lucifer catches his eye and begins taunting his brother, buying Sam precious seconds. Right as Lucifer picks up the jar of caramel Sam strikes.
Lucifer stares at him in confusion. "What do you mean?"
"Taking care of Omegas when they can't take care of themselves, and calling out the good in them, you mean? Yeah, we talked about it last year."
'Dont tell him I'm here!'
Dean gets in without another word.
"I know but I'm really-"
Balthazar throws his head back and laughs. "Don't worry your pretty little head, it still doesn't mean anything, any more than it did when I made that joke about stripping in the pool right before I left."
Dean nods.
"No fair, Gabriel!" Sam protests.
"Dr. Winchester can I see you in the hall a moment?"
It's not like Michael has ever been good at telling Cas no. "Yes, of course. Let me just Google what I have to say." Thirty minutes later, Michael is prepared. The children run outside together and form a processional in the yard. Sam is ring-bearer. The other siblings fan out on either side of the two little boys, even Uriel, who has to be pried away from his summer homework. With all the solemness of a real wedding, Dean Winchester marries Castiel Novak.
"Don't be ridiculous, Cas." Sam stares at him in horror then. "Wait a second, you're not Cas! How could I be so stupid? So tell me, which of you is playing Cas, and which is playing Dean? I've figured it out, you might as well as just skip to the torture now, because I know that it's not real. None of this is real."
"No, you should not," Cas bites out in between clenched teeth.
He can feel Lucifer's body thrumming with excitement as he searches for Sam. Sam, who he knows to be with Castiel, the younger brother he is enthralled with as well. He knows Castiel is responsible for hiding them, and it entertains him that his younger brother is so rebellious. He's a lot like Lucifer, yet still entrenched firmly on the side of good. No matter, for Lucifer intends to woo him over to the side of evil. Since he can't find Sam in the traditional manner, he will find him in his dreams instead. It's easier, with Sam's subconscious calling out to him.
But Cas has rarely responded to Sam's prayers before, and it doesn't seem he's going to now. Sam watches one of the vampires move closer to Ben, and suddenly the world is engulfed in flames. Everything is burning, flames gleefully licking higher. The vampire trying to get to Ben is the first to burn, but the others all follow him in his crispy ending until it's just Sam, Claire, Ben, and Benny left alive.
"No wonder he always stood so close to me! He was probably hoping I would remember being with him!"
"What day of the week is that?"
Michael doesn't respond. And that's the last thing Sam is aware of.
"Yes, it's really me. Sam, are you alright? Dean is worried about you."
"Sam?"
"Let go, Sam. We'll catch you," Lucifer vows against his skin.
Gabriel shrugs again, not making eye contact. "Didn't think you'd appreciate it."
"Dean, did you see-" his voice trails off as he looks for his brother. "Michael! Where's Dean!"
"We're going to be late!"
"Weird. Well, welcome back, honey. I'm going to find my wayward son."
"What the f**k?" Dean questions wonderingly.
"The Winchester boy has offered himself in place of Castiel, to accept the punishment for Castiel's rebellion and death of the angels," reports Raphael.
"Where's Crowley? Should we run and get him?"
"Why?" he asks, tiredness in his voice. "Why'd you do that, Sam?"
Cas smirks. "Yes, I have several brothers."
"We're back with the pizza!" Balthazar yells from downstairs. The group descends the stairs, Dean helping Cas though it's clear to anyone with eyes that Cas doesn't actually need the help. But ever since Dean has come to realize Cas is carrying their child, he's been doting to the point of being overbearing. Cas tolerates it all with a loving smile.
"My husband, my nightmares getting worse, and the fact that you haven't used your angel powers or told any jokes since coming back. Plus, you keep calling me Sam. Gabriel doesn't call me Sam very often."
"My impulse control?"
"Yeah. He misses you. He wants to be around you."
"You choked me. Tried to kill me. Tortured me. Tried to possess me. And I'm still here," Sam whispers back.
"Then we do that too, no matter what, Dean. Win or lose, we're fighting together as a family."
Dean groans dramatically. "Not this again!"
"Yes. But that other doctor is totally wrong, Cas wouldn't let me fake urine test results!" Sam exclaims indignantly.
He doesn't. John narrows his eyes at Dean. "You got a problem?"
"That little alien wants your attention," Cas quips, "they're kicking more now that they heard you."
"I tell Michael the same thing!"
Michael races to the hospital. Before he even stops the car, Lucifer is already out and moving to the ER. "Hi, I think my brother was brought in? His leg would be bleeding- maybe he was shot?"
Cas brings up the picture on his phone. "This is Jack Henry Winchester," he says, with all the pride of a new parent, "and this is your namesake, Claire Samantha Winchester."
Gabriel lets out an unmanly shriek as he's coated in ice cream. He leaps forward instinctively, putting himself in the perfect place for Lucifer to attack. Lucifer springs, looping an arm around his brother's waist and holding him in place as he dumps the jar on his head. He massages it in like shampoo for a moment before releasing Gabriel.
Michael allows himself to be dragged out onto the roof, which is an easy climb from his window. They sit up there, feet dangling over the edge together. Michael's finally the one to break the silence, "You going to tell me why you dragged me up here or do I have to pry it out of you, Luce?"
"Obviously not. No, I have no idea. That makes no sense. Unless-"
Uriel is 21
"Why don't we step into the conference room?" Azazel suggests.
Rowena rolls her eyes. "Nobody who knows you would think you would take advantage of a child, Lucifer."
.........................................................................................
Finally, he remembers the night dragging on, and Dean grabbing his hand and running off with him toward the Impala. "We have to go!" bellows Dean.
"Any of it!"
She clicks it on speakerphone, and Cas holds his breath just in case. "Hey sweetie, did you win again?"
"I hope you don't look too hot. I have very low impulse control. You wouldn't get much done."
"That's tacky," Michael argues.
"Also, I'm not into Jo anymore, if anyone cares," Dean adds.
"Take a breath," Lucifer reminds him.
'Now you know,' Lucifer thinks. 'I wanted you to understand, I'm not lying when I say I love you.' He's not, that's somehow the most surprising thing. He really does love Sam. Feeling the emotions like he has, Sam can't argue it anymore.
Jess disentangles herself from Sam. "Sure, Castiel. Come find me when you're done, Sam."
"I'm offended Dean," Balthazar comments, sitting across from them. "I don't secretly want to kill you." He pauses for emphasis then adds, "I make sure you know it."
"Oh, I can help with that! First off, is Dean just a friend, or a special friend?"
"I'm sorry. I wanted to reassure you that Michael and I are in no rush to select a house, since that topic of conversation seemed to upset you."
"They're being tortured, Meg. No one deserves that."
Bal says nothing initially, but he relaxes a bit so he doesn't look ready to attack. "I won't permit you talking bad about my mate. You say what you want about me, but you shut your mouth about her."
"I dunno. Do you think they ever measured?"
"Right!" Balthazar exclaims, eyes shining. "We always knew you were brilliant!"
"It's okay. We're okay. We're going to be fine."
"What's going on, Cas?"
Gabriel kisses Lucifer first, then Sam. Lucifer reaches for him and kisses him very briefly, before saying quietly, "We won't kiss you too long so we don't ravish you right here. We'll take care of that later," he reassures him.
Cas pulls his lips back in a snarl. "I just want to know if they're okay!"
"Just thinking, that's all."
"Castiel, honey, are you in labor?"
The angel was constantly rebelling, falling, dying, because of Dean. If he had never pulled Dean out of Hell... But he had. Dean's deal had gotten them into this mess, but Cas' deal had destroyed them. And there had been a them, apparently, because Cas had said 'I love you' he'd said it, and then he'd said 'Goodbye' as Dean stood there speechless. Sue him, he wasn't expecting a confession followed by a goodbye in the very next breath, so he'd stood there frozen while the Empty took his angel.
Sure enough, Sam is the dark figure in the room. Cas doesn't have time to ask questions though, because Jack is still screaming. He begins bouncing the baby and shushing him.
"I know I don't have to kiss you this way. But if you're not opposed, I would like to continue."
"Wonderful."
Sam speaks again, this time in Lucifer's voice, "Gabriel's gone." A different voice, Azazel's, spoken by Sam again, "Lilith vanished too."
Cas raises his hand, for lack of a better response. "I am."
"Yeah, to Cas. And Michael."
A large pout takes over Sam's features, but Lucifer isn't deterred. He's not about to explain to a seven-year-old the intricacies of an Alpha refusing to care for the child he impregnated a woman with. Sam glances over to Rowena and his pout morphs into a frown. "That's your shirt." Lucifer nods absentmindedly as he eats his own pasta. "She's an Omega," Sam realizes as he looks Rowena over. "Is she...your Omega?" Lucifer promptly spits out his lasagna. Sam continues on, "Because Mommy says that you are good for protecting Omegas. Did someone hurt her, so you hurt them? Because that's something you would do. Mommy says you do it a lot. Mommy also says that whoever ends up with you will be 'one lucky Omega indeed.' So," he declares, turning to Rowena, "you're one lucky Omega indeed!"
"Good! I was going to be really disappointed if I missed that. I wanted to watch you kiss him for the first time."
"You were watching him!"
"Silence, infidel!" Uriel thunders, which makes Cas snicker until he's gasping in pain instead.
"Should I book the flight?"
"Y'know what's a scary thought? Imagine just the two of us alive on Earth." Sam says, thinking Lucifer would definitely discover his crush if that were the case. He'd be forced to mate Sam, which wouldn't be fair to either of them.
"Not now," Dean snaps. Miraculously, John falls silent.
"Alistair. We've already dealt with your parents, you're next, and then we'll take out your older brother. He's going back on to Alistair's rack."
"You left it up on my laptop!"
"Normally you can't tell, but in this case you can. You're having fraternal twins, a boy and a girl."
Cas' Mommy and Daddy don't come for him by supper, so he eats chicken nuggets and french fries with Dean. After dinner, Dean sits with his mommy and feels the baby kick while Clifford plays in the background. Cas normally likes Clifford, but today it makes him sad and he doesn't like it at all. Instead he feels the baby with Dean. He learns that babies can hear what you say when they're in a stomach, so Cas talks with Sam and Sam kicks his hand in response to say hello.
"You're alive, you came back," he gasps. His hands travel reverently up her arms to cup her face. "Is it really you, you're really alive?"
He nearly plows Lucifer over, and furiously tells him, "Don't bother, he's already told me he won't be doing it no matter what we say."
"Mock you? No! I'm just telling you I don't think he's afraid."
"You didn't think I'd let them kill my brother, did you Cas?" Sam teases quietly. "They intended to kill you and use Lucifer to restart the Apocalypse."
Uriel is 26
"Good. I phoned your parents last night and they were in agreement too."
Crowley nods.
"What did you do?" Phobos hisses.
"It's some sort of science conference. If I understood correctly, it was some sort of microbiology conference where they were discussing major changes to the medical community. He invited me to go along, but I couldn't get off of work or school," pouts Cas. "And he's going to miss finding out the gender of the baby. Dean and I are going to Skype him in a few days to tell him."
"Found you, beautiful," Gabriel says, arm on Sam's wrist for balance as he stretches up to kiss Sam.
Michael slaps him once more for good measure and leaves the stand.
"Cold," Sam protests.
He wraps an arm around Cas, staring into the closet and pretending not to see his brother's tears. "What about this one? I know it wouldn't match your eyes, but it would match Dean's." The shirt in question is a forest green that Cas had picked especially because it matched Dean's eyes. "Then when he takes it off, you'll still have your black jeans and blue and black boxers to match you."
"Sure you are. Chuck, I don't mean to sound rude but-"
Lucifer is launched into the pool. He comes up spluttering. Crowley laughs and claps for Lucifer. "You're a dead man, Balthazar!"
Sam grimaces and turns back to his computer. "Maybe tomorrow, if I've got time."
"Ew no."
Michael spends an inordinate amount of time outside before he finally reenters the bar. "You're right. They're very happy. Both think I'll be good at this fatherhood thing."
Sam's room is still as fancy as it was. With Gabriel staying there he had supposed it would be changed into something garish, like that eyesore from the TV show 'Supernatural' he created. But it's still the same.
Lucifer quickly becomes a presence in the Winchester household as much as Castiel does. He drags Michael and Balthazar around too, so Dean seems to make the jump from expecting one brother to having three older brothers. (Uriel never wants to go to the Winchester's, so he stays home and reads instead when his brothers are running to their house.) He takes it about as well as can be expected.
"Where?"
"No, it's not. It's a park. I figured we could talk more here without disrupting the others." He sets a fast pace that Sam easily keeps up with, leading him toward a tiny pond. There's an island in the middle, and Lucifer leaps nimbly from rock to rock until he's on the island. He turns back, but Sam's already stepping off the final rock, staring around in wonder. It's probably a good thing Sam's not looking at him, because Lucifer is sure his face would give him away. "This is my favorite place on campus," he explains instead.
"Hey," Sam says, shoving past him into the house.
"Then don't think so loud about me."
"An old man, sorry Michael. Practically ready for retirement."
"No?"
The room falls silent for a bit. "Last question: does the mating bite hurt?"
She laughs melodically. "That's because it's not your kidneys the baby is kicking, darling."
"Can you go check on Cas for me, Sammy?"
"Yeah no, he definitely would."
Gordon stares down Lucifer but clearly recognizes the man's power because he pushes past John and exits the hotel.
"I don't know. It just felt like that was right. Why didn't I move in?"
"Thank you," Sam whispers quietly, and Lucifer nods.
Gabriel pulls a face, but adjusts the name accordingly. "Listen, Sam, I wanted to let you know I heard you and Cas talk last night." Sam's face drains of all color, prompting Gabriel to rush on. "I'm not going to tell him. I just thought you'd want to know that I know."
Sam cuts him off by kissing him again. He feels Lucifer's arms wrapped around them both, raising goosebumps as he moves. Sam relaxes, tilting his face up-
"You're lucky for that."
"I drooled on you!" Cas confesses, yanking the comforter over to wipe it off. "And I'm running late!"
Gabriel opens the door. "Hey. Aurora told me she saw you come up here. Where's Lucifer?"
We could just wait until the ultrasound tomorrow to find out for sure," Sam points out logically.
"Do you think I shouldn't?"
"We didn't see it."
"Here's a list of things you must address before the wedding," Michael says, serious again as he steamrolls on.
The medical program is nothing short of astounding. The woman showing them around is very friendly and answers all their questions. She also doesn't favor Dean because he's an Alpha, nor does she treat him like a moron because he's a mechanic and not a doctor.
"Maybe he didn't consider it a waste," suggests Michael.
Sam jerks upright again in shock. "Wait, really?"
It's hard to carry everything, so he decides to encase his laptop in pillows and wrap the blanket around it.
Before Cas can answer, a loud finger snap interrupts. The ground beneath them explodes into a couch, large enough for several more people than the three currently on it. Sam's computer twists and morphs with it, changing into a large flat-screen TV. A second later a coffee table springs into existence, with huge amounts of popcorn.
"Shopping for wedding suits," Michael answers blandly, tone obviously implying 'duh.'
"Not even surprised," Sam mumbles, and Gabriel snickers quietly.
"It means that the next time we see each other, we will be on Earth together. I will have a proposition for you, one I hope you will accept, but you will learn about all of that in time."
"To the left, no wait, right," Cas directs. He tilts his head, eyeing the picture. "No wait, a little more left. Angle, a bit more, no, the other way."
"Definitely. But it's also like something just slots into place, like 'oh there you are.' You don't even realize it's missing until you have it."
Michael picks himself off the floor. "Sorry, everyone," he says politely with a wave of his hand. After a moment, conversation resumes. Sam leans over Jess to begin introductions to Lilith and Azazel, and for the moment Lucifer feels calm again.
"How did you fight me off?"
It's anything but. Sam pulls away but Lucifer's hand is curling round the back of his neck and Sam forgets how to breathe. His head explodes. Possibly his body too, as Cas' did during the Apocalypse. He's not aware of anything outside of Lucifer. Probably they are still in the forest. His parents may be watching. Sam wouldn't know. The forest might be on fire. Sam would burn before he realized it, because his whole world is revolving solely around Lucifer. Sam's fairly certain their kiss is not supposed to be this good. He's literally kissing the Devil, but it doesn't seem to matter because his brain is singing a litany of 'Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer.'
"Did everyone know we weren't really married besides us?" Dean questions.
Cas scoffs. "Of course I knew.'"
"Long story. Tell you later," he answers.
Cas nods. It's dinner with his family, which means it's only his Mom, Dad, and Uriel at the table aside from him and Dean. "Yeah."
Lucifer's mouth twists into an angry sneer. "You're so stupid sometimes. You have no idea what I want, do you? Fine. Anyone who touches Adam Milligan faces the wrath of me and Michael both. Everyone understand me?" he snarls, glaring around the room for a moment. "And you," he growls, advancing on Sam, "be careful what you promise." He spins on his heel and stalks away without a backward glance.
"I'm sorry."
"We're just getting started."
"Sorry, Jess. I'm just not into it."
"You- he- honey! He never takes a second student! If he listened to your recommendation he must really like you! Especially if he took you on too after you said no."
"Who's going to stop me? You?"
Gabriel is 20
"Okay." Dean's jaw cracks with the force of a yawn. "Let the phone on. I'll keep it running." Sam nods even though Dean can't see him, crawling back into Lucifer's arms and nesting in to his bare chest. "Night, Sammy."
"I'm so sorry, I have to go. I'll talk to you later, though, okay? Bye!"
An indeterminate amount of time later, Sam trudges out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist. It's a small thing, and Gabriel is clearly perving at him. Sam pulls on his boxers, dropping the towel the second the elastic snaps. "Take a picture, it'll last longer," he tells Gabriel.
..............................................................................
"Sam, it's okay," Gabriel promises. "We're trying to get your fever down."
Lucifer jogs off just as Cas comes to find Dean. "I am so glad our relationship had none of the drama that those two have before we got together," Cas notes.
Sam stretches his long body over the bed, glancing over at Lucifer. "Don't you ever leave? It can't be that great, watching me struggle to heal."
Sam smiles. "I don't mind." He reaches out tenderly, tracing Gabriel's features with his fingers. Gabriel's honey eyelashes flutter shut as Sam drifts his fingers across them. "I never thought I would have this," Sam whispers to himself.
"Almost dropped you, b***h. Maybe you should lay off the snacks."
"What is wrong with your husband, brother?" Michael asks.
"I'm so sorry."
Cas has just ambushed Balthazar and tackled him to the ground when unholy screaming breaks out.
"I love you too," Lucifer says. Then he leaves.
"We'll take the kids," John says. "They're both fast, that'll help the fake offense look more real."
"I'm coming, I'm coming!" barks a masculine not-Sam voice from inside the house. The door is yanked open to reveal an angry Dean Winchester- and Balthazar knows it's him because he's only ever known one person with bright green eyes, and that was Dean.
They set off together, Claire and Ben in front where Sam can see them. The flames, which had previously flared to life, suddenly die out, smoking piles of ash all that's left to commemorate the kidnapping vampires. "Sam, there's a strange symbol here on the wall!" Ben calls, and Sam quickly joins them. He identifies an angel-banishing symbol and swears. No wonder Cas didn't answer his prayers. This warrants the important question of who to pray to to get them back. Lucifer and Gabriel probably don't know he's gone, and will be pissed. Michael deserves to know that Dean and Cas are missing, but it wouldn't be fair to him to make him drag them back to the hotel before he's allowed to search for them. Balthazar never comes when he calls, or if he does he b***hes about it enough that Sam wishes he'd never asked in the first place. It's tempting to ask one of the other angels that he doesn't know well, but that's the cowards way out and he knows it.
Sam finally breaks their desperate lip-lock. "How are you alive?" he questions, carding his fingers through Lucifer's blonde hair.
"Nah, it's impractical for hunting. I'll probably get a pickup."
His gaze lights upon the television, and the DVD collection of Gabriel's. 'Why not? After all, he did it last time,' Sam thinks. He kneels down in front of the TV, searching through different movies. He finds the collection 'Casa Erotica' and digs them all out. None of them really stand out, at least until he reaches the last one: 'Casa Erotica Thirteen: The Taming of the Moose'. Heart racing, Sam puts the DVD into the player and waits. His face flames seconds later when he hears a voice scream, "Gabe! Gabriel!" and recognizes his own. He had no idea Gabriel was filming him, and they will be talking about that later.
"No-" the waitress protests.
"How could you say that?" Ben demands as Dean deems the conversation over and turns away. "Better for me to not remember my father? Better for me to go into foster care? She was right to kick you out. I HATE YOU!"
"Chuck left," are the first words Dean greets him with.
"Dean's supposed to have them!"
Lucifer's eyebrows raise. "You're a pain in my butt, you know that?"
Lucifer nods, still watching the baby. Cas sits back and scrubs at his eyes with the back of his hand, yawning loudly. "Cas, are you tired?" Lucifer asks.
"You too. Enjoy your Omega night."
They file in, following Michael's lead. "John!" Michael greets, smacking his back in that annoying way Alphas do. "Dean! Cas!" Michael hugs them both in quick succession. "Sammy! Holy- when did you get so tall? You're almost as tall as I am!"
They eat dessert in silence. Sam leaves, and Lucifer doesn't even realize he's watching to be sure Sam makes it next door safely until Rowena clears her throat. "So. That's him."
"I just told my soon-to-be husband that I love him and he won't say it back, how do you think I feel?"
"Sam, what are you doing out of bed?" either Michael or Lucifer demands.
"He's not mini-Dean," argues Sam. "This is Ben. He needs our help."
Finally, Cas gains the upper hand through sheer persistence. Sam is certain that's the only thing that helped Castiel win, just stubbornness and a determination to be the victor. It works though.
"Sleep?" Sam demands.
Dean jumps in to the conversation then, switching back to house-hunting. "Sam, I was thinking we should move near Bobby. He's already established and Jody knows us so it seems like a good idea."
"Lucifer Novak!" Mary chides.
"Sit. Now," Lucifer thunders in his archangel voice. Sam drops like a puppet with the strings cut. "Talk," Lucifer orders sternly.
"I'm just overwhelmed. I'm fine. We should go back to bed."
The second he's gone, Bal says, "Way to confuse him, Luci."
Chaos and pandemonium breaks loose. Dean considers an attack to Michael to be an attack to him, so he leaps ecstatically into the fray. Then in the middle of the toss he realizes Cas has never been in a food fight, so he starts yelling instructions to him. Cas follows directions obediently, picking up a pancake and tossing it loosely near the demon table.
"Sam, I do not know what you are speaking of."
Dean swears directly into the phone at maximum volume, causing Uriel to again hold the phone away from his ear. "Mom! We gotta get back home! Cas is in heat, that's why!" Uriel brings the phone back again in time to hear Dean say, "We'll be there in an hour. See you soon. And Uriel? Thanks."
Sam's eyes widen. "You know about that?!"
"Where was he? I didn't think he was coming back. It's been four days!"
It's easy to nip Sam's leg while he's there, which makes Sam yank away yelling "Shark!" Lucifer surfaces and begins the Jaws themesong as he swims toward Crowley. He grabs the baby and bites his leg too, light enough that it couldn't count as a bite.
"Why? Because Cas and I make out all the time? Oh, and we're always naked around each other-" he begins sarcastically.
"No!" Dean says angrily. "No chick-flick moments, Sammy, and crying at weddings is definitely a chick-flick moment." He rubs at his eyes again. "I just- there's a piece of dust stuck in my eye."
"Mhmm," Cas answers, already climbing out of bed to get his son.
Cas presses his hand against his belly. "Hi there, baby." They watch onscreen as the baby kicks in response.
"Doesn't mean you can't second-guess yourself. Or be afraid to commit to a change, even if you really want it to happen."
................................................................................................
Balthazar listens. "So, what do you plan to do? You mentioned a debate class?"
Cas falls into line as they hurry to the ER. "Prescott and Winchester," Dr. Prescott says as they barge into the room.
Both archangels move as one behind the table. Sam is curled up there, staring into space. It's clear he's watching something play out that isn't actually there, and it doesn't take much brainpower to figure out what it is. Gabriel drops to his knees elegantly, dragging Lucifer down behind him with an angry-sounding clomp. Gabriel smooths Sam's hair away from his face, and Sam jerks toward him, eyes wild. "Hey," Gabriel greets, smiling sweetly at him. Sam looks behind him, to Lucifer, and shudders with fear.
Michael's mouth drops. "Oh my God."
"Course it is," Dean scoffs. Then he dips Sam suddenly, and it's only because of the half second warning Sam got as Dean's muscles tighten that he doesn't scream and hold on tightly. As Dean picks him up he sees Cas glaring at him, so he guides Dean into much safer squares.
"Who are you?" Dead-Sam demands.
"You guys!" Gabriel slams the screen door next as he bolts out. "Hi Mary! I found my mate! Her name is Kali, and she's tall, and gorgeous, and she looks like a goddess. She's perfect! She's got this dark skin, and luscious black hair, and beautiful almond eyes, and- and- and I can't believe I found her! I gotta go call Michael and tell him!"
"I keep watching you die."
"No, we need a little girl for Samandriel to play with. Dean and Cas are having a little girl," he argues.
A loud crash is heard seconds later. Cas moves over to the window, head tilted as he watches Dean.
"No. There was no marriage certificate, no kiss, no sex, no honeymoon, no legality. It wasn't real."
"Fine." Dean turns to go back inside. "Coming, guys? I heard Michael say something about dinner."
Michael states, "Well brother, I have certainly never had a partner dance the woman's portion of the dance as well as you."
"Who's this?"
Sam writes something on his board, flipping it to the doctor. "We believe that with the work of the Labor and Delivery team that we managed to save your womb. Obviously we have you on heat suppressants for the moment, so you haven't had a heat. And we have no way to check for fetal viability in your womb, since you're not pregnant. But the odds are in your favor that you will someday be able to have children."
"I don't want to make you uncomfortable," Dean says again.
"What are you thinking about?" Lucifer questions, breaking the quiet. He glances down at the younger boy, but can't discern anything because his hair is in front of his face.
"I like it too," Lucifer adds.
"Michael's locked in the Cage," Dean feels the needs to point out. "Also, no offense, but I'm not really into getting buddy-buddy with him. He tried to kill me, he tried to kill Sam, he tried to kill my parents. I don't want to be his friend." He takes a big bite of his sandwich, declaring the matter closed.
"I don't like it, Sam. What happens if you get hurt?"
"I accept your apology."
"Yeah, Sammy, right here."
"Lost cause," Sam decides, surrendering the cupcake.
"If you can get him inside of that tub, be my guest."
He spreads his arms in a placating manner before he even begins praying. "Lucifer? Gabriel? Michael? I ah- I need your help, please."
Sam laughs. "Very funny. Seriously though, what is it?"
It takes a moment for Michael to understand, but then he's off like a shot. Lucifer lounges against the bar, then turns to the bartender. "Do you have 'Not Your Father's Root Beer?'" She slides it over. "What was that garbage Michael was drinking?"
Dean grabs his arm, and Lucifer glares at him with a strength that would send a weaker man or demon running and sobbing for their mother. Dean doesn't let go. "Stop. If you kill him now instead of helping Sam, I will never forgive you."
"Not that. Before you saw me, did you feel strange?"
Cas sighs, pouting a bit now. "But what do you think?"
Michael looks to Lucifer. Lucifer glares at him. "Yes Michael, why did you ask that?"
Once he and Lucifer had had their talk at the restaurant, Sam left Jess know the next day that he had been leading her on and apologized wholeheartedly. She had slapped him, froze him out for the weekend, and when they were back in school Tuesday she gave him a hug and said she was sorry for slapping him. From that moment on, they were friends again. Which led to him being in a club for Jess' eighteenth birthday. (Apparently, she knew the owner, and the owner knew her parents, so she and Sam were allowed in though they were underage. Sam was pretty sure that was illegal.)
"And you!" Dean declares, wheeling on Lucifer now. "How could Sam possess you? How is that possible?"
"He's actually really good with Omegas," Becky tells him. "He won't give you that sexist crap other people do."
"Wait! You need to talk to Michael first!"
"Dean?" Michael questions.
Dean obediently takes his turn as the manual labor, pushing Sam around while belting out the lyrics to the theme song. Cas tags along beside him, looking bemused. "Zachariah is very upset with you," he tells Dean.
"Ah ah, nothing like that without Sam. No sex, we agreed."
"I'm serious!"
"We don't always get what we need," Sam retorts bitterly.
Sam grabs the pizza and heads back to the booth. "Sammy, I hope you're done flirting with that chick," Dean says as soon as he gets close.
"Lucifer mentioned that it was his fault because 'I needed to be able to see them,' whatever that means. But Gabriel mentioned something about accepting them, and that being the reason why I could see them. Lucifer alluded to that too as he was talking to Dean yesterday, only in regards to Dean's relationship with Michael. So, which is the truth?"
"Balthazar, stop teasing your brother. And don't make offensive jokes, it's tasteless, tacky, and beneath you."
"Yeah, I figured he was with the sound you made." Sam laughs. "You taking charge, or is he?"
Dean steps in with a nail, putting it into the wall before Cas can change his mind on the placement again. "Here, thanks guys," he says to Lucifer and Gabriel, who are holding the giant Noah's Ark picture between them. Cas is over bossing Michael and Sam now, trying to decide the perfect spot for the crib.
"I'm scared."
And...cliffhanger! Mwah ha ha! Sorry not sorry
"Loud and clear, Dean."
"Inias and Castiel have always gotten along well," Gabriel tells him. "I'm not worried either of them would harm the other."
"Cassie, you still need your sheets," he calls as a reminder for the couple. When he comes back a few minutes later, Dean is the one to pull the things from his arms and begin putting the sheets on the bed.
"You're the best, Michael."
Lucifer rolls his eyes and leaves the room with a scoff. He finds his way upstairs, outside the room that he shares with Gabriel and Sam. He leans against the door, pressing an ear curiously against it. There's soft muttering that Lucifer can just barely identify as Adam, so he sits outside the door to wait out the fever.
"Not that I'm a prude, but could you three maybe keep it in your pants long enough to get to a private place?" Gabriel queries.
Michael sits forward. "You and Lucifer need to sit down and talk about this. Tomorrow. You'll feel a lot better once you both express what you're feeling."
"But you could have the keys to Baby if you want," Dean offers, grabbing the keys out of his pocket.
Dean ignores him, so Gabriel throws him over his shoulder and zaps them both back to the hotel. Ben screams, "Dean!"
"Sam, what was that?" Claire calls. "Ben, go get our Dads."
"What are you doing here?" Lucifer questions.
"Yeah. And if I'm marrying Cas and Michael, then it shouldn't matter whether or not the wedding looks like something that I want, right?"
Lucifer sits on a rock, dipping his toes in the water. Sam sits next to him, body tight to Lucifer's so he doesn't fall off the rock. They sit in silence for a while, until Sam breaks it. "Hey Luci, can I ask you something- well, something else?"
"Probably because it is," Dean rations.
"What is this?" Dean questions, looking around.
"Michael Jr?" Dean argues, stomping off after Lucifer. "I'll have you know that I am not a Michael Jr., I am my own individual with a sparkling personality."
"You two are already bickering like an old married couple," Azazel mutters under his breath. "Can't wait to deal with this for millions of years."
Sam startles at hearing the knock on the door, so out of place with the world inside of Lucifer. "Yeah?" he calls.
Lucifer does a double-take. "Bal, your timing is the worst! Why would you mate somebody at Cassie's wedding? Couldn't you keep it in your pants for-"
He shrugs helplessly. "Any advice?"
"He said that I wanted him to pull that trigger. I never asked him to die! Where did he get that idea?"
"I'm starving," Lucifer whines. "Let's go eat."
"Now," Michael reiterates, "or I will throw the biggest, loudest tantrum you have ever seen, and I will not stop until I get you fired."
"The luggage trolley."
After his father's talk with him, Lucifer had suddenly become much more of a presence around the neighborhood. He became known for grabbing bags for Omegas who were carrying in their groceries, helping with yardwork, and protecting those who needed his help at school. The news had certainly trickled over to those next door. Mary Winchester was carrying in a bag of groceries when she closed the refrigerator door and jumped sky high. "Hello," she greets the young Alpha in her kitchen.
"4.0," Uriel reports as Lucifer lets himself into the apartment.
Sam ignores him, turning instead to go the mirror. He gazes critically at himself before deciding, "No this won't work at all," and ripping the shirt off over his head.
"Yes sir," Lucifer answers, actually respectful for once.
John does a double take. "What did you just say to me?"
"He's going to be okay."
"Where's Dean going to be?"
"Cas!" Sam cries, looking betrayed. "You promised you wouldn't tell!"
"That's not Gabriel," Sam answers evenly, shoving the creature back.
Dr. Prescott leaps into action, catching the other doctor around the waist and hurling him back against the door. "Get out, and stop intimidating the patients. This will be reported, you mark my words."
'Sorry.'
"A marriage between Lilith, Ruby, and Azazel will bring peace to hell."
Cas purses his lips as he stares at the proof of Sam's evil. "Okay, okay. This is okay. We thought this might happen."
Sam turns at the voice, and his eyes widen in shock. "Cas?!" he yanks the angel behind a pillar of the hotel, staring at him in amazement. "Is it really you?"
Lucifer looks up to watch Sam take three very shaky steps with the therapist. His legs buckle on the third, but the therapist catches him and eases him back into bed. "Very good, Sam," she tells him with a kind smile.
"I am. I'm marrying them both."
"Yes, I did. I plan to work at the local college, as an ESL teacher."
A deep chuckle sounds from behind him, but Lucifer doesn't say anything else to tease him. He tightens his arms against Sam, enjoying the warmth and strength of the hunter in front of him. Neither man says anything, feeling that words will break the surreal spell that seems to surround them both. Sam's fingers play across the back of Lucifer's hands, drawing burning patterns with his body heat.
"EW NO! Knock it off Gabe, it's no one you'd know."
"But you know what it is? Michael seemed to think Dean would enjoy it. And me too actually. He told me he and Dean would do me together" this last bit is said with air quotes around the 'do me together', "whatever that means."
Sam's eyes fly open, and he sits up in shock. 'WHAT?'
"It's a Tuesday."
"Obviously, that's just wrong," Sam agrees.
"Do you want to leave?" Dean asks.
Dean shrugs listlessly. "Ikindooit," he murmurs.
"How about your pants, Dean?"
"Yeah," Dean says eloquently. He's nervous again, something that he hasn't felt with Cas in quite some time. But he's holding Dean's hand, and Dean's entire world is narrowed down to the warmth of Cas' slightly sweaty hand in his. This is weird. Their fingers are linked, Dean's only ever held a girl's hand with their palms overlapping, never individual fingers, and it's the strangest thing to fixate on but here they are. Cas' hands are also larger than any he's held before, larger and more calloused. It's also weird. But it's nice, because it's Cas' hand. Dean likes it. He wouldn't mind doing it again.
Lucifer nods, seeing the wisdom in Sam's words. I've waited this long, I can wait a bit longer for you."
"You don't," Lilith says bluntly. "There's only been one person in all of history to accomplish it, and that's because he had an angel garrison come for him."
Gabriel winks at Lucifer and opens the door. Sam throws a shoe with the declaration, "I'm naked! Get out!" The door slams and Gabriel walks away chuckling.
After nearly two months, or rather one month, three weeks, and three days past the shooting (or, if you were counting by the days, 54 days)- but who's counting? Certainly not Lucifer- Sam is discharged from the hospital. John and Mary take him home, and Lucifer goes home to his own quiet house that is entirely too dirty and dusty. He hasn't been home for long in those 54 days, and it's obvious. He's in the middle of dusting the layer of grime off his TV and entertainment center when the doorbell rings.
"I can't, Cassie. I just hit my rut this morning."
Sam's playing with his spoon, rolling it as he considers saying something. He finally decided to go for it, placing his hand on Lucifer's wrist. "Hey. What's wrong?"
"I was thinking I'd steal a different room key. You could join me, if you want."
Sam folds his arms across his chest. "No."
"Look at that," Pamela tells them, turning the screen toward them, "that's your baby's head. Everything looks well-formed there, no spinal issues to be seen. The arms  here, and legs there. Everything is looking good, nothing I'm concerned about so far. Growing good, too."
"I didn't mean to hurt him, that's why I wonder if there's something wrong with me; he was my best friend in the world and I hurt him. Badly. I wasn't trying to be mean, I just couldn't understand why he would waste his time talking to me."
He runs into the cafe and grabs Alastair. "Outside. Now." he orders in a clipped tone.
"How many more ranks are there?"
"I can't find Mommy!"
"Give me the phone!" Sam orders, grabbing it back and entering the address. Then he drops it into his lap and takes off, careening like a crazy person down the road. He hardly brakes even as they enter Bobby's junkyard, steering masterfully around the cars that haven't moved since he began driving.
"On the same day?" Dean asks.
"Please," Sam scoffs, "if I even stay here at all I'll be staying in the guest bedroom." He swirls the roller in paint, trying to end the conversation.
"The strength of one's convictions-" Sam begins.
Castiel proceeds to call himself Castiel Winchester. In school he makes all his teachers change his name. He won't answer to Castiel Novak any more. His teachers call his parents, but they don't care what Cas calls himself so long as he's not misbehaving, and he's not- even when correcting them he's very respectful.
"Yes, this again. Until he's a fully-fledged adult, this is a very big concern." His mouth is saying the words, but he's still staring at Sam.
"No, absolutely none. It's driving me crazy, not having any answers."
"What did you worry about?"
"Thank goodness," Sam exclaims, and kisses him again. This kiss isn't light and gentle, it's fierce and claiming. It's 'I'm never letting you go', and 'now that I've done this I'm not planning to stop'. Lucifer's hands are gripping him tight enough he might have bruises- and that's fine by Sam. He grins up at Lucifer, blushing as Dean whoops. He's laughing back at him, fondness in his eyes.
Sam has a crazy idea as he glances over the wedding venue. If he runs across the reception table, there's a possibility he can grab Cas. It's worth a shot, so he takes off, sprinting across the tables as he runs. He jumps, and somehow miraculously grabs ahold. His joy is short-lived, because the cloud yanks him off and throws him to the ground. Lucifer grabs him before he can hit, and Sam immediately runs to Dean.
"So?"
Lucifer releases him and Cas staggers back a step, until strong arms wrap around his waist. Lucifer looks up- no, that's not true, looks across- and claps Dean's shoulder happily. He has no idea when Dean grew as tall as him, but the green-eyed Alpha supporting Cas can only be Dean.
"A man arrived who is being vocal in his desire to kill you, Sam. He rants loudly about demon blood. Your mother and Bobby are trying to calm him."
Beside Sam, Dean gasps, hand travelling to his chest. Then he leans back against the wall, slides down, and doesn't move again.
"Sammy, are you all okay?"
Uriel holds the door open for his friend from college, Raphael, allowing the guy into the house. They had a peer project on the Pygmalion Effect for Psychology 101. Uriel has already spoken with his parents and gotten it cleared for them to work on the project at home. "Why the f**k is your house so cold?" Raphael demands.
"I'd appreciate your forgiveness," Lucifer spits. "Like my holy older brother said, I've changed too. I'd like for you not to look like you're expecting me to slaughter all your friends, but that's really asking a lot. Oh, and I'd like for you to know that if you think you'll flirt with a girl like your brother did today, or flirt with anyone besides Gabriel, I'm going to make them regret it."
Gabriel cackles. "No, I don't, but I'm just picking something a little different than everyone else."
"Well that wasn't Sam, that was you!"
Sam looks pointedly at his arms, which are still strapped to the table
Lucifer's brow furrows, trying to make that sentence into anything other than what it is- proof that Sam doesn't remember his brother's wedding.
"Neither do we. So we'll just take what we want and leave."
Sam walks out of the throne room, ignoring Lucifer's words. "We're going to your Cage, come on."
He does as promised, also grabbing Febreeze to try and rid the house of 'Omega in Heat' scent. It won't do to have Dean go wild the second his foot clears the front stoop.
Cas paced around the physician's lounge, rubbing his back and trying not to moan with relief. Ever since he had woken up this morning, he had been having false contractions- and even though they were false, they were hurting like the devil. He tried to massage a knot, but couldn't quite reach it.
"Go ahead."
................................................................................................
Sam shrugs unrepentantly. "Thought you were Lucifer," he explains.
"I think so. Listen, it's-"
They party until late hours of the night, and repeat it all two days later for the wedding between Lilith, Azazel, and Ruby. And then finally, two days after that, it's Dean's turn.
Sam is 16
"Fine, Sammy, I'm fine," Dean pants. "It's the d**n wings. The pressure helps."
"Why would you defend me, Meg?" he asks point-blank as soon as the first ten minute break starts. "You hated me."
"We're not having sex, Cas. We're sleeping together platonically to celebrate our engagement."
"That was very kind. Thank you."
"And the most humble," quips Sam. "You don't stare at guys when they get out of the shower, it's just weird."
"Stop laughing, this is serious!"
"I'm just imagining how that conversation is going to go. Like, are you going to get all hot and heavy one day and he's like 'Let's mate,' and you're like 'yeah no you keep that anaconda to yourself.'" Gabriel's shoulders shake as he whispers "My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hon!"
"Michael?" A pretty red-headed girl leaves a back room, then gasps as she sees Cas. "Is he okay?"
"Kamikaze."
Lucifer and Balthazar are 26
"Have what?" Gabriel inquires.
"Oh, Sammy," replies Mary, voice full of pity. "Why?"
Sam is 11
As he leaves, Sam abruptly switches topics. "So you graduated from your linguistics course?"
"I can just do this," Lucifer says, standing up and walking out the door.
So, the Cage is one of his worst fears, right up there with clowns. In order to not be afraid of the Cage, he needs to become someone who isn't afraid of the Cage. Which is so simple it's really stupid, but if it works...
"Group hug!" Sam yells, picking up the laptop before he runs in so Uriel's a part of that too. Lucifer squishes behind him , but he loses track of all the others in the press of limbs.
"What?" Cas growls in an adorable snarl as he tries to wake up.
"Oh yes, I like this, Sam. I like this a lot," Phobos says, voice coming from Sam's completely human fiance. Sam stares at him in shock, and then he does the only thing he can think of to do- he runs off, bolting away like his life depends upon it, because it does.
Sam pulls back, trying to keep his expression neutral. "Father d*mn it, I'm not trying to threaten you, Sammoose. All I mean is that you're not going to catch me trying to sneak out of the house again."
"I'm going with you," Sam answers as himself.
Sam lowers both hands in a gesture of goodwill, though he's still ready to incinerate her if she makes a wrong move.
A flutter of wings is the only warning he gets before Dean appears in the car with him. "What?"
The owner drops the drinks and heads away again.
"Okay. Then let's get Charlie and Kevin into rooms, and we can deal with this later," Dean suggests. He throws his arm around Charlie's shoulders and walks off, saying something Sam can't hear to her. Kevin follows them after a concerned look at Sam.
"Dean, we don't have money-"
"Oh yes. Castiel was always an inquisitive hatchling, nearly to the amount Gabriel was, though far less detrimental. His first steps were over toward the place where we keep our vessels. His first words were very quick to follow, because he grabbed Dean and declared, "Mine!" Fortunately, I was standing right there to take Dean back, and calmly explained that Dean was not his, but mine. Then I led him off. And when I turned around, he was back with Dean again. Dean would routinely go missing, so finally in a fit of frustration I tried to explain to Castiel that Dean would be sad without Sam. After all, that was like Michael without Lucifer, I explained, and so Dean would be very sad and he needed to stay with all the other vessels. But Castiel had gotten it into his head now that Sam was also his, because if Dean was his, and Dean would be sad without Sam, then by extension Sam was also his. I still remember the first day Lucifer came running in to tell me that Sam had gone missing, and Dean too. He suspected foul play, I suspected Castiel. Obviously, I was right. We took both Dean and Sam back, and finally I decided to help him make his own vessel. I figured if he had his own, he would leave Dean alone. Didn't work. We built Jimmy, the three of us together, and then when we turned around again, Castiel had three vessels in his grubby little hatchling hands instead of just one. Once he grew a little bit, we figured he would outgrow visiting the vessels. He didn't. Once a week he would sneak in and talk to Dean, updating him on whatever things had happened since he last spoke. And when John and Mary Winchester were born, he took to carrying Dean and Sam with him everywhere, because he knew he would have to give you up soon. By the time Dean was drug to Hell, Castiel had already visited with Naomi several times. He didn't remember Dean per say, but he was still one of the first to volunteer to go get him. And then of course, he was the only angel to make it to Dean, quite unsurprisingly in my mind. He's always been there for Dean, and I didn't imagine anything as unimportant to him as Dean being my vessel would change that."
Someone's arms wrap around him and begin yanking, taking him away. Sam struggles in the person's grip, screaming and fighting. It's only when the person swears in his ear that he realizes the unknown assailant is John. He doesn't care, he's not sorry for hurting him. He was trying to take him away from Lucifer.
Lucifer laughs and pulls his brother into an absolutely filthy kiss. "Good job. Now that we've got our prize, what should we do with it?"
"He tried to stake me several times when I was a trickster," Gabriel adds, "one time stalking me for six months to accomplish it. Oh, and he sasses Lucifer."
"Sam, stop!" Ruby begs. "If you kiss me Lucifer might kill me."
Gabriel is 24
"I did not, I was very masculine in my surprise!"
"If that's what makes you feel better, I guess," answers Lucifer uncertainly.
Dean shoots himself a flirty smile in the mirror, adjusting his suit. "Hey, good-looking," he singsongs.
"Oh my God Cas, this is so far above and beyond the call of brotherhood!"
Sam straightens and looks around in confusion. "Where did he go?"
"Did he admit it? He said those words?"
"Well, no one's going to hear us escaping with him making that kind of racket."
"Can you try to summon it back?" Cas asks, head tilted to the side as he contemplates something.
"Yeah, of course."
Dean goes over the bed and begins waving his arms. The whole room expands. Another large bed appears next to theirs, clearly meant for Sam, Gabriel, and Lucifer. At the foot of those beds, three other beds arrive, facing horizontally. "It's crammed, but it'll do," he decides as he tilts his head to make sure everything is even.
"He's in the bathroom. Showering. You could wait for him, if you wanted."
"Is that the question?"
"Dean told you no too? What did you ask him to do?"
"What are you going to do with that blade, Sammy?" Lucifer asks, voice condescending. "Going to stab me with it? I'm a hallucination, a part of your own head, I'm not real. You can't kill me, because I'm just you're screwed-up way if coping with your fiance's death."
"No. But not because of anything with you. There's too much going on right now. I just got a job helping Balthazar in his ESL class, and Dean and Cas are getting married in a week. After that, though- after we get to know each other again, and become friends like we were when we were kids- then I'll mate you."
"But you're not upset that I'll be going so far away?"
"That's not much time at all," Dean complains.
"Oh, stop," Sam protests weakly, a blush starting across his cheeks.
"Where else would I go?" Sam asks rhetorically.
"You'll be fine! And just think, you'll probably meet loads of beautiful girls with British accents," teases Lucifer.
Michael takes them all to the restaurant, calling ahead on the way to be sure they'll have a spot for eight people. He also makes sure the restaurant knows a bunch of lawyers and students are coming. By the time they get there, everything is prepared and a cheerful hostess is leading them back to their table.
Dean falls quiet. Then after a moment he speaks again, "Where is Cas?"
Lucifer grimaces. "I knew, and I didn't tell you because I knew you'd respond like this."
..............................................................................
"I know, Cas. I'd never want to erase you," promises Dean. "I guess I just like knowing you're mine, you know? Like, I like having people look at you but knowing that you're mine. I like sitting here with you doing homework and thinking that you're mine. I just like the idea of it."
"Do you want the rest of the ice cream?"
"Were you planning to send him back with a bite mark on his neck?"
Gabriel flips him off without looking back at him.
He makes Lucifer a sandwich in silence, putting it down on the table in front of his boyfriend, who's currently slumped over on the table. When the plate hits, he lifts his head and blinks at it in confusion. "What's this?"
Lucifer shuts down the computer and heads to their room, climbing up to the top bunk. He lays in silence, tossing and turning. "Just tell me," Balthazar calls up to him.
Sam can't, so he doesn't answer. Instead, he lays back on the blanket, allowing the warm August sun to beat down on his face. "This was great. Thanks, guys."
"He doesn't really consider himself an archangel anymore. Talk to him, Sam. Do you forgive him for what he's done?"
"I'm not. For the record, I think you're right. Though I will be thrilled once Dean and Cas finally get married, and you say yes to me."
"Two more weeks," Lucifer answers. "The conference ends next Friday, and he flies back Saturday."
"So Sam's a super-charged demon?"
"Yes," Cas answers.
"I'm here," Sam promises. "I'm not leaving." He links their fingers together, then holds his other hand out for Gabriel, who bounds over joyously. "Take me home," he mumbles against Gabriel's lips as he reels him in for a kiss. Gabriel snaps his fingers, the world fading away for real this time as they appear in their house.
Lucifer and Balthazar are 26
"No, the red panda was the best," Sam is telling Lucifer, "so you're wrong."
"Oh, he's not coming home today. He's got a big case tomorrow he's working on." She grins mischievously then adds, "Michael and I 'forgot' to mention you all- mainly Sam- were coming. He'll be very surprised tomorrow. But he'll be back when you stop in to get the kids Sunday."
"No I'm sorry. Dean, your Mom's ring is gone."
Sam says something to his friends, and extracts himself from the group. He heads over toward them, fire in his eyes.
Lucifer is there suddenly, seeing Cas touching his beloved husband. "What's happening?"
"I trust Lucifer," Mary answers. "If Sam winds up getting mated on this trip I wouldn't be upset."
"Cas? You did- um, you did want kids? Because I don't want you to think I'm not happy with you. And hey man, it is your body, so if you don't want to have kids, I guess ultimately the decision rests with you."
At Dean's nod, Adam says, "Why did he want to kill us?"
Cas' phone rings. It's Dean. "What?" he snaps.
"Sam and I went to check out our venue in Hawaii."
As though Dean's voice has summoned him, Cas forces his way into the hotel room, lugging massive amounts of frozen vegetables, ice packs, bags of ice, and popsicles and ice cream.
"But ultimately he made the right choice! He died to protect us, and he gave us the secret to reopen your Cage."
This conversation has just taken a very weird turn. "What about?"
"I know, Lucifer, I know. I'm just telling you it's an option. Not a good one, not one we should even consider, but she offered. The demons are concerned too."
Sam steps into the light, making sense of the situation quickly. Samuel Campbell is back, and Adam, Claire, and Ben are holding him back.
"My chance to back out came and left already, round about the time the tow-headed boy in the sandpit told me we'd get married one day and I'd drive a car just like his."
Sometime in the middle of triaging Lucifer comes in. Cas doesn't know what to say, so he says the only thing he can. "Lucifer, they don't know if he'll make it. He's pretty bad off. I'm so sorry."
"Where is he?" Sam demands, forcing himself to his feet.
Lucifer swears and puts his face in his hands.
"That's what I was talking to Dean about. I have decided to be a doctor."
He runs downstairs, screaming bloody murder all the while.
Cas shivers. "I like the sound of that." He yanks Dean down to kiss him fiercely.
Misha's mouth drops. "WINCESTIEL IS REAL??????!!!!!!!!!"
'Come back to me. This is my worst fear. It's not him. It's you,' Sam thinks.
Sam pokes him. "Come on, Gabriel. He's probably going to keep fussing until we humor him."
"Wait, Dean," Cas calls, catching up. "The gift is in your room."
Lucifer looks up from where he's standing over by the elevator, clearly deep in conversation with Michael and several other angels. "Gabriel, what is this?" he asks, heading over to them.
Dean's adamant denial is cut off by Mary. "Hello, boys."
Dean is already sneaking into the warehouse as they approach. Cas and Sam hurry so they are directly behind him, entering with him. Sam can see the cage where the children are, so that's where he goes. There is one lone vampire guarding it, and Sam dispatches him effortlessly.
The nurse pushes him to the side. "I'm so sorry, sir. I cannot help you right now."
"Tough luck."
Gabriel is 24
"Whatever the outcome of this trial, I'm going to be okay. Cuz the thing is, if I backslide, then he's got more power over me. And I'm done playing that game. Which actually brings me to the next thing- I want to go to the trial."
Cas and Dean are 21
Cas shrugs. "That's what my teacher said too."
"You're right about everything being peaceful right now. But pretty soon it's going to get worse, I've seen that much. There's something coming for angels and demons indiscriminately. With the way things stand right now, they will be attacked on two fronts: angels attacked by demons and by the evil coming, and demons vice versa. They will be torn apart. It will be worse than the Apocalypse- much, much worse. With the defeat of heaven and hell, Earth will also cease to exist completely."
"No, that's not going to work. Can you move them to either the room next to me or across from me?"
"Excuse you! I was a delight as a child!" Gabriel cuts in.
"Yes, in the morning."
"Oh marvelous. Well done, Lucifer. This is truly the way to convince him you're alive," Gabriel bites out.
"No, I'm still going to be a hunter. You too. We won't give them any other choice."
"Don't wanna share!"
As though he knows he's being talked about, Sam looks toward the three adults. He says something to Crowley, helping the toddler swim closer to where the adults are sitting. Once close enough he pulls himself out of the pool and drapes his lanky body over Lucifer. "What's wrong?"
"Yeah," Dean breathes. "Yeah, that'd be nice."
Cas whirls on that student, a hand clenched into a fist at his side. His other hand points an accusing finger at all his classmates. "You shut your mouths about my mate. You can say whatever you want about me, but don't you talk bad about him!"
"Lucifer, where's the rugrat?" Balthazar demands of his twin.
"Sammy, what a charmer! How did you two meet?"
"That's sad," Lucifer decides. There's a long pause as he walks around the rest of the dining room, before he ends up in front of Mary again. "If my Omega was pregnant, I wouldn't leave."
"It's probably the shared DNA," Dean quips.
Lucifer forces a smile at that, but it fades quickly. "I'll tell you later."
"Put fish everywhere," Sam requests, "they're my favorite animal."
"Right in the kitchen, Dean, just like I told you," Cas reassures him, following along behind him.
"Just you wait, it'll happen to you too. And someday I'll remind you of this conversation. You have a good night, Lucifer."
"Definitely not! I'm only bothering Sammy!"
"Guys!" Sam interrupts. "Does it matter?"
Sam doesn't hesitate. He wraps both arms around Dean, clutching his brother closer as both arms wrap around Dean's back. Dean looks up, then lets go of Sam for just a second. "Alright, Cas, get in here."
"I should go."
Cas decides it's time to take his leave, but not without one final parting shot. "Besides, I think both you and Jess deserve better than settling for each other as mates."
"And why can't Squirrel do this?"
Michael scans Dean and Jo both for a minute before saying "I can see I misjudged this situation."
Lucifer reaches out his hand and helps Sam into Heaven. Zachariah is holding Dean back, who's snarling and cursing as he struggles against Zachariah. "Let me go, let me go! I have to go get him!"
Michael is 30
"Sam, to what do I owe the pleasure?"
"No, but I know I wish someone had asked me before Dean and I got mated. I was terrified. Thank God I had Uriel"
"His body is rejecting the grace."
"I want to."
"Lucifer," Michael growls in warning.
"NO! A...you know..."
Cas runs off. He hardly remembers to knock on the door, except Dr. Prescott catches him by his scrub jacket and hauls him back. "Ah right," Cas breathes softly. "Drs. Prescott and Winchester," he yells as he runs in.
"Not much," Sam answers honestly. "I doubled up on my Ativan, and that didn't help."
If you ever need to get a room full of angel's attention, or perhaps you feel the need to be overdramatic to a level only an archangel would, Sam recommends this. Everyone instantly moves to catch him, diving down, but Dean is there first, as Sam knew he would be. Dean sets him on the ground, flanked by both Lucifer and Gabriel, and instantly begins cussing him out.
"Are you going to give him a nickname? Because we already know a Sam."
"Hey Sammy, know what I'm thinking?" Dean asks quietly.
Sam should be sleeping, because he's expected to be conscious for Bobby, Balthazar, and Crowley's wedding tomorrow. But he's restless and a light sleeper to begin with, so when Gabriel leaves, he instantly snaps awake. And when he leaves the room, clearly not headed to the bathroom, it's not difficult for Sam to decide to follow him.
Lucifer is 19
"Help!" the man screams, and Sam charges toward him.
Gabriel is 19
"Oh mom, please don't cry," Sam hears Dean say, then "ow!"
John defends himself with, "I needed revenge."
Dean stares at Crowley for a while, not saying anything.
"No we don't. We can just drink and pretend it never happened, that's what Dean and I always do."
"So I was thinking, you angel people are doing lots of things you shouldn't be. Showering, eating, sleeping. Why?"
"John, who's this?" Mary asks quietly.
"Well the way you're looking at me isn't nice either," Cas snarks unrepentantly.
Sam laughs, insane and maniacal, but he stares at Lucifer like he's witnessing the second coming of Christ. "It's really you."
Cas thought he couldn't get any more surprised after finding out they were having a honeymoon, but finding out they're going to Italy for two weeks does it. He's always wanted go to Italy, but assumed he wouldn't have the money until he became a doctor and firmly established himself in the field, so that he and Dean would have savings in the bank prior to travelling anywhere. It's a blessing to him that they're able to visit now.
"We're to meet him tomorrow at that stupid hotel of Gabriel's."
"That picture of us is one of my favorites," Dean says, as Balthazar reaches out to touch it. "Cas looks gorgeous in it."
"Me too. Did you understand the difference between beneficence and nonmaleficence?"
"He does," Sam acknowledges. His fingers leave Gabriel's face to thread through his hair, tugging lightly as he drags his fingers through it.
"Sam's rejecting grace and running a high fever."
"So Cassie and Dean both aren't committing to whether they think it's a boy or girl, I say girl, Lucifer says boy, what do you think, Sammy?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"And I trust Dean and Cas. Neither one has ever done anything to make me doubt them; they've had plenty of opportunity but the only time they do anything is during Cas' heats. I think they'll be fine," John answers.
"Winchester? He's related to this one, he's going to fake the results, you mark my words! You manipulative little liar!" he snarls, lunging for Sam again.
"Get your hands off of him, Alistair," a commanding Alpha male voice orders from behind Sam. "He's asked twice."
He does have to laugh when he spots the cake, which is a scarily-accurate depiction of him, Lucifer, and Gabriel in cake form. It's standing upright somehow, and even matches all of their heights. Sam laughs uproariously, and Baldur, sitting nearby, looks pleased. "It's our wedding gift to Gabriel."
"Cas-"
"For what?" Sam asks, curious as to what he's thinking.
"What?" he whispers, propping himself up on his left elbow so he's facing Sam with his back twisted away from his brother.
"Good, cuz I need to have a word with him anyway!" Sam yells back.
"We'll take care of it. Come on, Cas. Lucifer, Gabriel, Michael, we'll catch up with you in a bit. Save us a seat?"
"My hair is purple!"
Lucifer's coffee somehow managed to spew from his mouth and travel down the wrong tube to choke him at the same time. He looks horrified as he finally glances over to where Sam is standing. 'I knew it. I shouldn't have come.'
Lucifer rakes his fingers through his hair in agitation. None of what Uriel says is untrue, and he knows it. "Listen, I'm sorry, Uriel. Really, I am. We must have hurt you so badly as children."
Sam shakes his head, though his eyes are drooping shut. "Talk," he insists.
The doctor seems irritated. "Well?" he barks. "You heard her. Which of you is Castiel Winchester?"
Dean continues shoving Sam up the stairs. "Priorities. Kids first. Demon-teaching second."
"Well done! He'll be falling for you in no time," Dean chirps, smacking Lucifer's back.
"And why is he changing into the mystical 'something more?'"
Lucifer puts his hand out as if he's waiting on Sam to shake it. "Hi, have we met? Lucifer Novak, overly-dramatic Alpha lawyer." He waggles his eyebrows flirtatiously at the young Omega, allowing himself this one thing as a concession to his feelings.
Michael swings the door open as Cas knew he would. He helps him up onto the bed and lays out the crayons where Cas can reach them easily. He grabs his calculator as Cas picks a nice car picture. It needs to be black, like the one he and Dean played with today.
Sam's shaking when he answers, "They always say you shouldn't run from an Alpha when you're in heat."
Dean cradles Cas' face in his hands like he's something precious as he kisses him. When they break apart, Cas whispers, "Michael says we're not supposed to."
Dean gestures between the two of them angrily. "What are you doing?"
"I remember her," Mary defends her actions, glaring daggers at the redhead across from them. "She tried to kill me once before. And John." Mary's voice trails off for a minute, staring at Sam and Dean, "And you two were there too, but you weren't children, you're almost like you are now. And you," she says, turning to address Michael, "what the h**l are you? You look like my husband, but you are definitely not John Winchester."
"Have you decided on a major yet? I know when you first went to school you didn't know."
For all that Lucifer tries to tell himself when he is sane- ie. not in rut and in full control of his senses- he is perhaps not as over Sam as he claimed. It takes all of two seconds to determine that, and for him to realize he is royally screwed.
"With the whole mate thing. Like, he's married with a kid. And you're only a bit younger than him- I just wondered if you ever had trouble with that."
Sam laughs, and Dean laughs too.
"I have to rule heaven?!" Dean exclaims.
'Which sounds better: Castiel Winchester, RN or Castiel Winchester, MD?'
Cas tries to answer him, but Dean moves his hand to cover Cas' mouth, in much the same way Cas did when Dean announced he planned to say yes to Michael the first time- before Michael took Adam as a vessel instead. "Please just let me get this out."
Castiel smiles. "Okay." With permission this time he takes the Impala and drives it around silently.
Samuel cocks the gun. "I wouldn't do that if I was you," he says.
"How bad is it?" Sam whispers in a hoarse voice.
Mary brings it up to John at dinner that night. "Sam wants to go to Harvard over Columbus Day weekend."
Sam tunes him out at this point. He heard the speech sixteen years ago, and again yesterday during the rehearsal. Instead, he focuses solely on Cas.
"You're next," Alistair promises Dean before he smokes out of his meatsuit. Lucifer growls, but he stalks off toward Sam, smoothing his hair out of his face.
Gabriel and Sam both glare at him. "What? You have deep-seated prejudices against hell!"
"You can't hide forever," Lucifer says in Phobos' raspy voice.
"No, it's not, before you even finish that sentence. I'm honestly offended, Dean."
They make it into the hotel room and Dean steps into his brother's space, yanking his shirt off which is soaked with sweat. The pants come next, and Dean muscles him into the bathroom where Gabriel has just finished running the cool water.
"Do I have something on my face?" Castiel asks as he straightens.
Sam cuts him off with Hellfire this time, a short burst before Sam reels it back in. His eyes are literally fiery, dancing with the flames he's holding back. "I said I'd prefer it if you didn't go on. I'll deal with that later. We'll redefine some terms, I'll discuss it with Michael. And I'll bring the idea of advertising to him too." Sam looks over to Crowley. "Thank you for bringing that issue to my attention." He makes eye contact with each of the demons in turn, "Thank you all for attending. We're done here for now."
"And you won't be! That way the wedding can go on!" In this moment, everyone forgets that hurting Jared would result in Sam being hurt, and so on.
"Well, did you ask me if I want to?"
Lucifer sits nervously on the edge of the seat. "Listen, Dad-"
"But did you take the time to actually explain that?"
"It might. We should try it."
"Charlie! Kevin! My brother and sister!" Sam slumps backward, unconscious.
"And Michael does?" Sam asks incredulously.
"It shouldn't be me. Have Gabriel do it."
"My Father brought me back."
He turns to Sam. "Sam-"
First he develops a crick in his neck, then his right arm goes numb. His nose begins to itch. Right as he's about to sneeze the door opens to readmit Gabriel.
"Sorry Cas. I couldn't smile at one more angel who secretly wants to kill me."
Sam looks to Lucifer and Gabriel as the first lash falls, pain exploding across his back. Lucifer is just barely being restrained, the demons having wandered out and catching sight of what was going on. Azazel and Crowley have a tight hold on Lucifer, who is straining against them. At the second lash, Sam watches the demons wince with it. The two female demons are off to the side of the boys, holding each other tightly with gritted teeth.
"Don't bother, apparently the only people who have the ability to open Heaven now is Michael, Cas, and-"
Cas goes into the bathroom. They hear him gasp and gag for air as he tries to calm himself down.
"Except Richard," Not-Dean adds.
"It's Castiel," argues Gabriel, also coming down the steps, "of course he was going to say yes."
"Well, big brother must be so very pleased. No matter what you say, now we all know you've said yes to a much bigger thing," Lucifer breaks the silence to say.
"No," Gabriel answers. "I did check her over just to be sure, but she's alright. Scared, but unharmed. Azazel was able to get her off the ceiling while the rest of us distracted you."
Gabriel seems to take his cue from Lucifer, picking up Sam's arm and curling it around him. He jostles the entire couch as he gets comfortable, waking Dean with a gasp.
"Sam!" someone shouts, and he turns to see Ruby barreling down on him. "Where have you been? Your husbands have been looking all over for you!" Without waiting for a response she grabs his arm and begins tugging him toward the lobby doors. "I'll announce you."
Gabriel is 23
Lucifer has already been looking around the room with a haunted expression on his face. He moves forward, until he's at the exact place where he had thrust his blade into Gabriel. "Hey," Gabriel's voice calls, and he takes his hand, anchoring him firmly in the present.
The waitress jots the order quickly then turns to Cas and asks, "And for you?"
Sam instantly pushes himself to his feet, leaving Gabriel, Cas, and Lucifer to his back. Between him and Lucifer, he is their best chance at protecting their friends and family. "Phobos," he snarls.
Lucifer snarls. He angles his head and literally bites the other man. The guy backhands him, making him release his grip. He stalks forward and gets jumped by the other Alpha.
"You think I don't know that? You think I missed how terrible of a father I was to the both of you boys?"
A laugh from Dean shakes his whole body. "You're too tense, baby. Just relax. It's me, Cas. You've known me your whole life. I'm not here to hurt you or take advantage of you. I'm here because I love you. Or, if you need, I can leave because I love you. You decide."
Cas does, complaining the whole time. "Really, Mary, I promise you I'm fine-"
"I don't know."
"That's right, you're still cursed! So what, you're all lovey with Lucifer now thanks to a spell? Do you think it will last tomorrow- the romantic part, not the curse?"
"Were you surprised?" Cas is demanding, sunny smile nearly splitting his face.
Lucifer stares at Sam's arm, and Sam pulls his hand away. "Sorry," Sam mumbles.
Alistair wrenches the neck of the reporter back and forces demon blood down her throat. The whole group gasps collectively.
"Castiel Winchester. Omega. I became a doctor because I want to help people." The class gets dead silent.
Sam swings his body to the other side, staring down Gabriel and Lucifer. "This is news to me!" Gabriel exclaims.
Michael is 30
Gabriel vaults the back of the couch easily, especially considering his tiny stature. After he lands he turns to Sam with a preen, "Thank you, Sam."
Michael dismisses Sam instantaneously, without even turning to look at him. "Not going to happen."
"Cas," he croaks, sounding like he's dying all over again.
"Do you have the grace?"
"I can't keep talking about this. How soon is this baby due?"
"It's not," Sam agrees. "But you're sure if you give Dean your grace it will give him the power to open Heaven?"
Abbadon reaches over and grabs his cheeks, turning his head this way and that. "You're cute."
"Not to."
"Why settle for one round when you could have several?"
"Deal."
"Nothing! Why can't I tell you I love you?"
"Because he wanted to get to know you before he tried to get you to say yes."
"Sam who?"
"Sammy, did you and your boyfriend come to join us?" Dean calls. "I'll deal you in."
"Luce!"
"Yes," Sam says, with a pointed glance at Lucifer.
"Not asking about Gabriel."
"No. No you couldn't. You love me too much."
"Out here!"
Lucifer nods and turns to walk away. Then he spins back around. "Guys, I'm sorry I'm such a jerk."
Dr. Prescott looks at Sam, who's laughing. "He's gonna be a great doctor, ain't he?" Sam questions.
"I just asked where you were," Sam defends himself, "and he overreacted."
"Michael? Can I tell you a secret?" Cas asks, leaning on one elbow as he stares into Michael's soul.
"It's beautiful."
"Great job!" Michael calls.
"He first appeared to me wearing your face!"
"I'll need to watch myself. People can't know he's my mate."
"Can't wait until you watch him research," Lucifer mumbles behind him, and Sam grins.
"Bobby's dead. And so is Balthazar"
The trek through the airport is relatively easy, because Cas puts on his 'I'm an adorable child' face and asks the closest friendly looking person for help because he and his boyfriend are trying to get to Massachusetts. The woman takes pity on them and guides them through the airport like they're her own children. She drops them at their gate and gives them strict instructions to stay there until the flight boards, and to keep their bags with them at all times.
"Just a bit."
"Because I thought we were already married, so I didn't see a reason for it. But now that I realize we're not actually married, I'd like to remedy that. But if your don't want to get married, that's fine."
"No, no, Lucifer is the other one," Mary says. "The blonde that's also at Harvard." When John still doesn't seem to know who they're talking about, she adds, "the one that was always over here playing Alpha while you were trucking."
"Like h*ll," Dean scowls, and he runs toward Cas, flying off with a yell of his husband's name. He falters immediately, and Sam is suddenly reminded of the real Gabriel's warning to him. This thing can use any of their fears against them, and Dean's worst fear-
"You know, because this will be your bedroom?" prompts Balthazar.
He's back in a few minutes, carrying a green smoothie. Gabriel leaves next, with a gesture to Lucifer to say 'talk to him!'
Dean crawls into bed with Sam, and Sam bundles them both beneath the covers. He flashes back instantly to the last time they did this- he was six, Dean ten. John was with them, and they were hunting...he can't remember. But having Dean with him brought him a sense of security and safety, a feeling like nothing in the world would go wrong so long as Dean had him. It's the same now. In the morning, Sam will have to face reality. He'll have to deal with a marriage he doesn't want, with his arch-enemy and...whatever Gabriel is. But for now, Sam's big brother will protect him. He drifts asleep with that comforting thought.
Uriel turns off his phone and heads back upstairs to his brother. "Hey, honey. Dean's on his way."
"You're lucky we were able to heal you. With how close to immortality you are, we were uncertain we would be able to heal you."
"Nineteen years later, I'm making good on one of those promises."
Gabriel crawls onto the couch like a gangly colt, but he manages to get comfortable quickly, snuggling into Sam and shutting his eyes. Sam grabs the textbook he was going to start with and flips it open, dropping a hand to mindlessly stroke Gabriel's hair as he does so. Gabriel purrs low in his throat.
Gabriel laughs so hard he's gasping for breath. "No, I don't think they ever measured."
"I wanted to go over to the Omega's house and find out if she needed anything, before the case goes before the judge. I want to check electric, water, maintenance repairs, and so on, and I know she doesn't have a lot of money. I can repair things for her, but I thought I should bring you so it doesn't seem like a strange Alpha is coming into her house alone to take advantage. I'm probably more trustworthy if I've got you along."
"I'm just evening the playing field, honey. I owe these two-"
"Your mate? You found-"
Cas nods. "I'm going to marry him one day," he tells Michael.
Dean freezes. "What are you doing?"
"And what does that say about my mental well-being?"
"Fine. It's mostly not my blood, I'm fine, I'm fine," Lucifer chants. "I thought I lost you. I thought you were gone. Mine," he mumbles again.
"You asked-"
Lucifer reaches into Sam's chest with a blinding light. Sam grits his teeth and tries his hardest not to scream.
"Advertise it?" Ruby echoes. "Like, 'crossroads deals, buy one get one free?'" she mocks.
"I guess? Some guys do, some guys don't, but ah," Sam scrubs at the back of his neck awkwardly, "if-if you don't like it, you should let them know."
"Mmm?"
"So it is."
"You really do love him."
"When you told me you were married- and parents- I figured you guys had changed, somehow. But that seems just the same as you guys have always been."
"I HEARD THAT!" Gabriel cries, sounding a bit affronted.
"I hate you!" he calls, and she blows him a dramatic kiss as she heads down the sidewalk.
"The spiders display bad physics."
"And once you get there, how do you plan to get in?" Crowley asks them both.
"I-" Cas begins. "What do you mean, 'Where is Sam?'"
"Just weird to see you with a shirt instead of looking like a halfway-committed stripper."
"Do you have ethics tomorrow?"
"Look, honey," Mary says, holding the bundle down so he can see.
"That's more Dean's problem. I don't care if people know I have feelings."
"Why do you say that?"
Dean wakes Cas Friday morning entirely too early. That is to say, before nine a.m. Cas never wakes up easily, and today is no exception- but with Dean bouncing him on the bed in a manner he usually reserves for Christmas, Cas is up quickly.
"You just want me for my body, don't you, Sammy?" Dean asks, jumping up from the bed and running a hand down his abs tantalizingly.
Sam is so distracted he nearly walks into his brother, and it's because of this that he doesn't duck the fist flying to meet his face. He's slammed backwards, a thundering sound in his ears.
"I was going to come for you, once I finished getting our piece of Heaven built. But looks like you beat me to it," he says, as his hand slips into Dean's.
The Alpha reaches past him, so Lucifer shoves Sam forward and calls,"GO!" Sam scrambles off, and Lucifer prays he's fast enough as he whirls on the Alpha and screams, "MINE!"
"He thinks I want him dead! That's not love!" Lucifer snarls.
"Looking forward to it." She saunters out of the apartment, closing the door behind her.
"Sam?" Lucifer questions.
Kali releases Gabriel and the two say something softly, Gabriel's head resting against Kali's, blonde hair mixing with black curls, before Gabriel gets off the counter and saunters away with a smirk. Kali slaps him on his butt as he jumps the front counter, causing Gabriel to shoot her a flirtatious wink.
"I'm growing up. And it feels like I'm teetering on the edge of a cliff, and I'm supposed to have a parachute, but I don't, and everyone tells me to jump, and I tell them I don't have a parachute but no one believes me and I know sooner or later I'm going to have to jump- and then I can either hope someone with a parachute will catch me or I'll splat into the ground."
"Lucifer!" Poor Sam startles upright, fumbling for a weapon before coming up with the picnic basket in lieu of a better option. He's ready to swing until he identifies Michael, who clearly just popped in to interrupt their date and to save Sam from answering Lucifer's question. "I've been calling you! We're supposed to be picking a wedding venue! Did you lose the schedule I gave you?"
"We know!" Jensen and Misha say together.
Dean is silent for a while, and then his eyes roll back into his head and his mouth falls open with a snore. "Sleep well. Angels are watching over you," Cas whispers, words that haven't been said over Dean since he was four years old.
"When did the rest of our party leave?"
"Hi, this is Sam Winchester. I'm in town, mind if I swing by?"
"Told you so."
Dean can distinguish the difference between Gabriel's calls and Lucifer's, which start up a moment later. He's so caught up in listening to them that he doesn't realize Bobby and Balthazar have come out until Bobby speaks.
'It's fine,' Sam tells him.
"Sam, please stop trying to pull that out. It's helping you breathe." He takes Sam's hand gently in his own, smoothing fingertips over it. "I am so glad you're awake." He breathes out a choking laugh, that gets caught somewhere around a sob and bursts out so he's laughing and crying at the same time. "I didn't know- I tried to be optimistic, but nobody knew if you would wake up again or not."
"Yes," he confirms tersely.
..............................................................................
That makes them all cry a bit more. "Thank you," Mary says, and she hugs the students.
Lucifer rolls his eyes. "If I was sure you would enjoy it instead of running away if I took off my clothes, I would."
"Honey what is it?" Balthazar questions, immediately responding to the panicking boy. He wraps his arms around him comfortingly and twists the younger boy into his chest.
"Is that all you were waiting on, before you came to get me?"
Sam is shaking, eyes still screwed tightly shut. "Are you dressed yet?" he begs.
"I will. When the time's right, I promise I'll say yes."
'That's why I was able to find you. I did tell you, MFEO. Your body literally called out to me as you slept, that's how I was able to enter your dreams. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for me to be able to find you, Castiel's warding did its job a bit too well.'
"Race you guys there!" Sam announces, and he trips Dean before he takes off down the hall. Dean roars profanities as he follows him.
"Shut up," hisses Azazel. "Don't you dare."
"My vessel attacked you," spits Michael.
"Um, no. That's disgusting."
"I don't know. He just said he's not coming."
"Dean!" he yells again. No response.
"Make a note to yourself, Dean," Lucifer tells him seriously, "the baby will come whether you're ready or not."
"No," Lucifer answers automatically. His mom would probably kick his butt if he answered anything differently.
"Drink it anyway. It's good."
"Arrogant to a fault, Winchester."
Wide blue eyes get even wider and the neighbor boy nods. He crawls into the sandbox, sitting on the edge.
"Yeah, sure. Listen, I'm at their house, I'm actually standing outside on the porch like a creep because I'm still on the line with you. I'm going to let you go so I can talk to Sam."
"You're not going to stop until I agree, are you?" Sam asks.
Lucifer grabs for a pool noodle. "You're in for it now!" he shouts good-naturedly, smacking Sam lightly on the head. Sam shrieks and goes under to avoid getting hit, but received a blast of water to the face when he resurfaces, courtesy of Lucifer.
Sam sits up in alarm. "Gabriel?" he calls. "Are you okay? Did we- I- do something?" Gabriel doesn't respond, and he doesn't come back.
"I don't want to have sex. It looks scary. But Dean does, and I don't want to tell him no."
"Mary and I would be okay with Sam moving in."
................................................................................................
"You're sure?" Lucifer asks raggedly, hands on Sam's shirt as he prepares to remove it. "What happened to being nervous?"
"They can wait. He's more important." He carries Sam over to the bed, laying him down carefully so he doesn't wake him. Gabriel yanks the blankets back the moment before Sam hits the sheets. Sam's shoes are pulled off, set on the side of the bed so he can find them easily tomorrow. Lucifer debates about undressing him, but in the end decides against it- Sam will probably wake up, and even if he doesn't he's not sure how Sam will react to realizing he was undressed without his knowledge in the middle of the night. He covers Sam with the blankets, and smooths his hair out of his face. "Goodnight, Sam," he whispers. He brushes a kiss across Sam's forehead because he is not strong enough to resist, and breathes out, "I'm glad you came back to us." Sam doesn't stir.
Dean says nothing, looking to Cas.
Dean stares at him with wide eyes. "Once we're what?"
Dean growls low in his throat. "Knock it off," Cas says, running his fingers through Dean's hair, scratching lightly at his scalp. "He's not hurting you."
"Then don't let him go! Send me instead!"
"Can I come in?" he asks, twisting his hands nervously. "I'm sorry, I know I'm interrupting at a bad time, but I saw something you need to be aware of."
Cas unlocks it, whimpering. "I hurt so bad."
Michael rolls his eyes. "I know! It's all you two talk about."
'Dean, get here now,' Sam prays silently. 'Bring a gun.'
"What?"
Sam's blood runs as cold as Lucifer's normally does. "So you intend us to give up our brother, and our family, in return for our parents? We will not allow you to have them. We don't intend to restart the Apocalypse."
TRIGGER WARNING: DESCRIPTIVE MEDICAL AFTERMATH OF SCHOOL SHOOTING
"Oh no! The shark's got Crowley!" Sam screams.
"I know, Sam," was the response. "Believe me, I know."
"No, not that. Though I will have to text him later to congratulate him. No, I meant you and Sam. You two were finally going to mate?"
"Yes."
Dean's quiet next to him, and Cas fears that perhaps he didn't want him to enjoy the tour, but every time Cas looks over he smiles and squeezes Cas' hand.
"Just me, Balthazar, and Kali yet," Uriel answers. The three remaining people walk down, Kali offering Cas a hug and soft congratulations.
Mary stops walking. "I hope he has no relation to the Lucifer that is also Satan."
"Date?" Sam echoes.
"He's in the dining room. Sam, I really think you should go back to bed."
"SAM!"
"Hey," Sam says, going over to him.
"Yeah?"
Sam walks out of the courtroom, barely clearing the doors before he breaks into a run. He remembers everything now! This is fabulous! And most importantly, he remembers Alastair laying out his plan for Balthazar, how he was going to ruin both him and Lucifer's life. He also remembered that he had been helping a student record a video, so the proof they need is on that computer. Here's hoping it's still there.
"Hawaii?" Sam confirms.
"I'm sorry," Sam gasps aloud. "Oh God, I'm so sorry."
By the time they are halfway through the movie, Dean is snoring. "He's asleep?" Sam asks Cas, punctuated by a light snore from Dean.
Gabriel's phone goes off one more time, and he reaches for it with a low growl. "Sorry, I'm going to have to check-" he mutters as he picks up the phone.
"What about a shower?"
Considering it's a new business, word seems to have gotten out fairly quickly. The place is half-full and it's not even prime business hours yet. People mill about snacking on the brownies, donuts, pies, cookies, and pastries Gabriel offers, and enjoying warm beverages as well. Cas has hot chocolate, but Gabriel also provides coffee and tea.
Sam shrugs. "Think they burnt up. But I don't need lawyering ones, actually. I'm switching my major."
"I'm a monster."
"Is that burgers?" Dean yells.
"Why, do you miss him?"
Sam rolls his eyes.
"So," John begins, "you're Lucifer."
Michael huffs, storming over to sit on the chair near the bed. "What you don't seem to grasp is that just because you are doing something because you believe in it does not make it right."
"You and Sam are syncing up? Oh my God! Lucifer, that's big!"
"What, no way! I pushed you first, it's my turn next! Then Cas can go!" Sam argues. Sure, it's childish, but it also looked like fun, and he's not sacrificing his turn when Cas can wait.
Gabriel smirks, as though he's laughing at a joke Sam wasn't told. "That's to keep you out."
Lucifer reaches out, allowing Sam to make the decision to take his hand. After a moment's hesitation, he does. Lucifer throws them onto 'Angel Express' and back out, so they land in front of their house.
"You and I can dance to...um....'Candyman'. Lucifer and I can do 'Hey Brother.'"
The day after Cas' sixteenth birthday, he wakes to sheets covered in sweat and a body radiating warmth to put a furnace to shame. Also, he feels lousy. This is not fair to feel this way, especially considering everyone is out of the house. Cas likes to be babied when he's sick. If Dean was around he'd settle for having Dean baby him, but Dean is visiting his Uncle Bobby a few towns over.
"Yes, Uncle Sam! And remember, this is Sam and Dean's parents? Mary and John. Now if you look over there, you'll see they came to visit!"
He's still more than half asleep as he stumbles downstairs, which is what drives him to grab a mug of coffee and beg Bobby's flask off of him.
"Just look at the proof, Luci. No matter what it seems like, he is accepting you. He can see hellhounds, and we both know he wouldn't be able to do that if he wasn't accepting you."
"Why does everyone keep asking me that? I'm fine! It's just a piece of dust that was stuck in my eye! It's gone now!"
"Get him!" Sam cheers, bouncing on his toes so Lucifer has better aim, unimpeded by him.
"I'm sorry."
"All that he thinks you will do is tease him about Lucifer. He won't listen to a word out of your mouth. He'll listen to me."
He goes to the computer and logs in. They named the document- he doesn't remember. So he scrolls to the date of the shooting. It's there. It's actually there. Taking a deep breath, he clicks on the video and begins to watch.
Balthazar shakes awake. "What?"
"I'm not here for Lucifer, I'm here for Dean. Michael, please. You have to see his wasting away," he argues, gesturing at his blank-eyed brother, who hasn't even responded to his name.
Dean's on his feet now, staggering toward Michael with determination on his face. And suddenly Cas leaps up too, grabbing Michael around the waist, both arms restraining him. He digs his feet in and isn't swayed when Michael yanks forward. Dean, seeing Cas has Michael under control, instead takes down the wall.
"Dr. Prescott, are you going to let your intern boss me around?"
Gabriel laughs, smoothing hands across Sam to soothe him. "It's okay. I've got you. We've both got you."
Blades crash, neither man appearing to immediately have the upper hand. They bounce back, eyeing each other and feinting two or three times. Dean suddenly drops, and Sam's gasp of alarm is over loud in the room. He jumps up, tugging Mary with him, only to realize that Dean dropped on purpose instead of having his feet cut out from underneath him. He rolls, making a crazy slice toward Inias. Inias pulls his foot back and delivers a solid kick that launches Dean back several yards.
He guides Sam back into bed easily, because Sam is through with fighting for now. Adam coaxes him to sleep, then goes into the bathroom to wet washclothes and lie them on Sam. He watches him sleep with trepidation, fearful of more hallucinations.
"You're lying," Sam challenges, which makes Lucifer laugh.
Lucifer turns a terrifying glare on Gordon. "So be it. You are only living because my husband, the same man you would name a monster, wishes it. If you cross us again, you will not be allowed to live if you express a desire to kill him again, whether he begs for your life or not. I will not be this merciful a second time."
"Sam!" Bobby calls, voice sounding far away and distorted as though he's shouting through a tunnel. Sam doesn't understand why. He should move through the tunnel to talk. Other hands join his on Lucifer's body. Sam very nearly hurts these hands, but then he looks up. They are Bobby's. He should not hurt Bobby. That's not nice. Raphael, on the other hand, he should hurt. He killed Lucifer, and that's also not nice.
Uriel stares at his back. "Cas, are you... crying?"
Lucifer nods absentmindedly, eyes straying to Sam again. "He grew up nicely, didn't he?" Dean teases.
Sam shakes Lucifer awake at six. "Hey, we gotta get going. Next stop: Hell."
Uriel is 21
"Alright, well lay back. I'll take a look."
Sam rolls his eyes. "Shut up, Dean."
"He's still a child."
Sam scoffs and says, "I think it will take a little bit more than that to break me."
"I can't!" Lucifer proclaims, looking fearful. "I can't love him. Not yet. He's far too young."
"I told him I wasn't interested and to take Meg instead. He decided to take us both."
Sam's entire face is on fire. It's flaming like the hellfire that is apparently now coursing through his veins.
Sam jumps and whips around. "Hey, Cas. We're hiding from Lucifer. We need a distraction."
"Demon blood," Sam answers, dread in his tone. "Dean, we need to get there, now!"
"Oh. But my Mommy and Daddy do it all the time."
Sam takes the lead. They traipse through the Winchester house without finding Rowena, which means they've got to check the Novak's yet. They make it through all the rooms of the house, until Balthazar's. In hindsight, Sam should have known better. Perhaps he should have knocked, or stood outside the door yelling, or...
"Anniversary?"
Sam retracts his arms. "Right. Okay. Thanks." Cas lets go of him and steps back, so Sam is able to disentangle himself from Dean.
Sam pouts but does as he's told. He walks out into the hall and nearly walks into his brother, who is just coming out of his own room with Michael and Cas in tow.
Lucifer goes to get up, but Sam squeezes his hand. "Please stay."
"Oh." Sam isn't sure how to respond to that. 'Nothing offensive about that at all,' he thinks sarcastically.
"You went to hell?" Jo demands.
"Yes, he was. It wasn't your fault. And I want you to know that I forgive you," Mary tells him, pulling him into a hug. Without Sam even realizing it, his arms come up to hug his mom, drawing her in. She smells like roses, and he can feel tears start to well in his eyes. He doesn't let go for a while, long enough that everyone besides Dean have left the room. Even Michael, Cas, Lucifer, and Gabriel are gone.
"Andy Gallagher went to hell? Why?"
"Luce! If Bal has been shot, then you should go to the hospital."
Dean grins wider, batting his eyelashes as he yanks Sam up against him, moving Sam against him like girls at the club dancing with each other. "How do you even know how to do this?" Sam asks.
"Come, Dean, Sam, brothers, we should not be here," Cas says, and they follow him out.
"No, we don't," Jo agrees.
"Dean, we can't. Michael's away at Harvard. That's not close to Lawrence, Kansas."
Michael appears suddenly and runs toward Cas with his blade out. Rather than the gentleness Sam has started to expect from Michael, he slams his body into Cas, dropping his blade. He touches Cas, and Cas' body lights up as he smokes out of it.
"Coming!"
"How often is that?"
"Sorry, Sam. I didn't think of that."
"My Lord, please call down. You'll work yourself back into a fever," Azazel says as he comes out of one of the rooms.
"Well, Castiel, I am telling you I'm looking between your legs and seeing a crown of hair, so unless you have some other explanation then I am telling you that you are having a baby right this moment. Push, honey."
"They're going to lower the amount of oxygen the machine is giving him until he can breathe on his own. If all goes well, he'll be off in a few days. He did wake up for them. He's understandably confused, and still very lethargic. As best they can tell, he doesn't remember that he was shot. They're having trouble figuring out if he knows the date, he keeps going to sleep on them. And of course there's no telling what he does or doesn't remember. But he is awake."
Dean squawks again. "The f**k, dude? Don't be thinking about my man naked!"
Gabriel's answering grin is electric. "Father, I love you. You're perfect."
It's yet another Omega Night. Cas has been sitting in Gabriel's bakery since 3 p.m., engrossed in a paper on ethical dilemmas while he waits for Gabriel's shift to end. After the paper they have to do a presentation, and it's a major part of their grade. Sam had just gotten off work at the restaurant next door, which means within the hour Gabriel will be off too.
Sam shrugs. "I didn't want to be here, but I don't know why. I think it had something to do with Lucifer, but that doesn't make sense because I love him."
Crowley backs away as Sam turns to him. "Don't even think about it, Samantha."
"I do," Gabriel agrees.
..............................................................................
"Step forth and remove your shirt."
'Idiot!' Sam fumes mentally.
"You are no help!" Sam explodes. "Raphael's been trying to kill us because he thinks Dean and I are witches and cast a spell on the archangels to prevent the Apocalypse!"
"You're stupid, Mika."
"God, Bal, that's pretentious, even for you," Lucifer teases. Balthazar shoves him, forgetting that they're on the top bunk and there's no where to shove Lucifer to. Lucifer smacks his back soundly on the wood of the bunk bed and ricochets back up, laughing wildly the whole time.
"The Apocalypse, brother?" Michael addresses Raphael as Sam finishes reassuring Cas. "Lucifer and I have healed old wounds. We do not intend to fight."
Dean flops back onto the bed. "Okay, I'll do that."
"Sam and you were always opposites, Dean. You were my vessel, he was Lucifer's. Is it truly such a surprise to find that if you are to rule heaven, he is to rule hell?"
"He told us he was coming over early to set up. You haven't seen him yet?"
"All right, Sam. There's a couple things you need to know. First off, Dean was right. I know, it pains me to say, but Dean was right. The black cloud knows me, and I know him. We were gods together back in the day. I can't give you a name, because saying his name alerts him, but I can tell you everything I know about him besides his name. First off, he's the Greek god of Fear. I know that by telling you that, you'll know who you're up against."
