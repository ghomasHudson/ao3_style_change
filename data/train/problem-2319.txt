I push past him, knocking our shoulders together. “John is at least as skilled as five of your pathetic medical staff.” He grabs at my elbow, stopping me in my tracks. Yanking away with enough force to nearly unbalance me, I glower and demand, “
“Don’t be mundane,” was my reply. Blue eyes flashed and he flipped me to my stomach, yanking me up to my hands and knees and barely giving me time to catch my breath before his body met mine. His teeth snapped together as he thrust into me, reminding me of his duality and claiming me as his own.
“No running off this time, hm?” John said, tilting his head in his best pleading expression. “I’m John,” he added, gaze settled firmly on the man’s cupid’s bow lips. His own mouth felt dry, so he swallowed harshly and waited. When the man remained silent, peering down at him with widened eyes, he smiled again and joked, “This is when you tell me
“Of course. Oh, and Sherlock?” He pauses to glare at me. “Think of Redbeard.”
to be in here to help me,” I snap while I rinse the conditioner out of my hair. “I was clearly unaware.” I look around and realize I didn’t grab a clean flannel, so used to my former routine that I forgot I haven’t lived here in 8 months. “John? Would you mind?” I throw my hand over the shower door, palm up. “I forgot a flannel.”
,” he says, breathless.
“Right.”
“So, the message is for me, specifically?” John asks, his face screwing up into a scowl as he takes the envelope in his hands and turns it over to examine it. Sherlock watches him, unblinking, before pulling his bottom lip into his mouth to worry it between his teeth.
He could see the wheels turning in the man’s head as he considered the request, eyes unblinking until he finally nodded. “Sherlock,” he murmured.
>>Sherlock: Since you’re refusing to meet up with me, I’ve decided to show you exactly what you’re missing.
I shout internally.
And this…,” he gestures vaguely to his face, fingers flailing in the air restlessly. “...this is
The Wood, with it's birch, aspen, and pine trees that swayed in the wind, branches crackling as they rubbed against each other. Inky black crows, their iridescent feathers shining in the anemic winter sun, calling to each other as they took off. Air so silent and thick it felt like cotton in his ears and water in his lungs. He drifted further and further into the forest in his mind, following the whispers of an all too familiar voice as it beckoned him back.
The scotch bottle sat on his table, calling to him. He stared, eyes tracing the clean lines of the glass, and swallowed around the knot in his throat. “Alrecht,” he nodded, then opened the liquor and tossed his head back. At least he could numb some of his pain before leaving.
As he slaps one roughly into my hand, he insists, “
Another few moments pass, and he finally frowns to himself with resolution. “Sherlock, I can’t do this. I can’t marry Mary.”
. He’d say yes, tomorrow. No more putting it off. This was going to go somewhere, that much he was sure of. Whether it would end up in a bed or in the flames of public humiliation, he had no idea. Both were terrifying.
“Yes,” he said the moment they met on the green. He’d dressed especially nice today, wearing a rich purple shirt and black suit. The dark color offset his pale skin, making him glow in the early evening lamplight. He knew he looked ravishing before examining John’s face, which was flushed pink and gaping.

otherworldly.
“You’re implying that we have...choices?”
Blinking up at the ceiling, I squeeze back. “Okay.”
Immediately, John felt a bit of his earlier bravado ebb away as the pair stared at each other, waiting for the other to say something more. What in the world was he planning on saying next? He came into this wanting the man’s name so he could moan it later that night. He hadn’t really expected much else. Now that he had Sherlock’s full attention, he realized how ridiculously mismatched they were, and the hot creep of shame began tingling his cheeks.
Panting, I gasp out, “I...

Anatomy and Physiology. The midterm was worth a whopping 25% of his grade, and he knew that most of the medical schools he was considering would look at his grades in A&P I&II more than anything else in his application. He didn’t even want to think about what would happen if he failed this exam.
“Sherlock!” he’s nearly shouting, shocked at the intensity of my fear for him.

The forest floor outside the stone circle was unremarkable. John braced for his departure from the eerie place, expecting to have the wind knocked out of him again...or something

And next to them, another stack with Sherlock’s block print detailing my name and a P.O. Box I’ve never heard of and no return address. I pick the top one up, flashing it to him. My heart is thudding heavily in my chest, palms sweaty and hands shaking.
“Hm,” his captor mused, the sound escaping his throat on the tails of a deep exhalation. “Nothing but

staring the note might, at some point, make sense to him.
I’ve never heard him sound so unsure. My stomach drops, a million worried thoughts flooding my brain:
A knot worked its way into his throat, causing him to cough. Swallowing around it, he pulled back just enough to look at the glassy-eyed man. “A trade? Giv me yoors first?” he suggested, hating the way his gaze traveled down the angular features of the man. “An’ lit me doon, woods ye?” He looked down at his feet, eyebrows hiking up his forehead with expectation.

with my fingernails cutting crescent moons into the skin stretched over Sherlock’s shoulder blades while he takes me in hand and sucks hickies onto my neck, our panting and moaning the only sounds filling his quiet bedroom.
“Mm, so I did. I couldn’t stop thinking about you, though,” was the murmured reply. Sherlock guided them to the nearest wall, pressing John’s back against it. Behind them, students passed with their heads bowed, barely noticing them as they stared at their phones.
It is amazing how a shower seems to wash even the thickest weariness from my bones, leaving me feeling renewed and relaxed. As promised, there's a new mug of fresh coffee on the side table by my chair, the steam drifting lazily in the sunbeams illuminating the room. Sherlock is a statue, fingers steepled in front of his lips, in his chair. There's some quiet violin music playing in the flat, something I don't recognize. Plopping down, I pick up my mug and meet Sherlock's gaze.
And then, the possibilities raced through his mind. So many available, and he didn’t know which direction to go. So for now, he followed John as they entered the dining hall, grabbing a few a-la-carte items and sitting with him at the table closest to the exit. His companion slung the rugby bag across the back of his chair and sat, immediately tearing into the shepherd’s pie he grabbed. Sherlock watched, enamored, until John looked up with a mouth full of food.
against mine…” The thrum of want that has been threading its way through my core since the shower flares again, settling between my legs as I feel his answering hard heat pressed against my groin. He rolls his pelvis against mine, then pulls our hands behind his back to place my palm on the swell of his arse. He reaches up to trace a line along my jaw with his index finger, the touch heady and seductive despite its chastity. My breath catches as I stare down at him through half lidded eyes, vision hazy with desire at his confidence.

Most days, he found that he didn't seem to care.

“No,” I reply flatly, walking over toward the kitchen table. “John...I don’t agree with you.”
Squatting on my haunches, I reached for the cap, fingers brushing against the fabric just as a low growl shook me in my own skin. Snatching up the hat, I turned my head to the right just as another growl crawled up my spine and made my breath catch in my throat.
“Sherlock certainly wouldn’t appreciate you losing your temper like this, John,” Mycroft interrupts calmly, reaching out a hand to my forearm.
Breaking the thick silence surrounding us, John comments bluntly, “Those are song lyrics. From The Police, yeah?
what we want. We’ve said it,
I throw a lopsided smirk at him and nod. “Go on.”
Pressing his hips into Sherlock’s, John threw him an impish grin. “Where would you like to start?”
“You’re not eating,” John commented, putting down his fork.
They walked to the bus stop together and waited, watching a bus as it came trundling down the road towards them. John knew it was exactly the one he needed to get to his exam, and he smiled.
His hands flew up to his face, heels digging into his eyes as the tongue licked boldly at him, teasing and tasting. Sherlock moaned as he pushed deeper, his nose tucked in beneath John’s testicles and his forehead rubbing against the base of his cock. The ministrations continued, taking John apart piece by piece until he was shouting and cursing, body writhing on the floor of the dirt filled cave while hot white streams pulsed all over his stomach and chest. It lasted
“You know full well his name is Greg,” he murmurs, tilting his head to rest on the side of my shoulder.

“Och, ye ken. Sam as aye,” the man replied with a grunt. “Damn!” he shouted, a hand flying up to gesture rudely at the television in the corner. “Ye see thes?” he asked John, cheeks reddening in rage. Their local rugby team was losing to a new one from London. John didn’t care, but Brodie clearly did.
Focus, Watson.
. My own opinions about the pointless institution of marriage aside, this turn of events is one I find abhorrent. It has nothing to do with Mary, naturally. She is, as one would expect, perfectly suited to John. She balances him in a way that he needs. She’s clever, funny, quick-witted, and talented.
“Wrong,” a gasping, whispering voice breathed into his ear. He swatted at it, feeling the sting of his fingertips against his earlobe as he flinched. Whipping his head around, he searched the trees for the source of his torment, and found only the bleak, stiff wood. Pulling the icy winter air in through his nose, he breathed and stepped out of the stone circle, the toe of his boot hovering above the forest floor.
There was no monster, it wasn’t here, it was just me,
Naturally, I was startled by the sudden presence of the short, blonde man I had seen in the marketplace. He had the same piercing stare that I had witnessed previously, though upon closer inspection I determined that his intensity was merely due to the brightness in his eyes and the steel set of his jaw. There was a gruff demeanor about him, something just shy of wild that I attribute to his living arrangements and near constant isolation. It seems he isn’t quite comfortable conversing with other humans, preferring solitude and the beasts of the forest as his companions. As he glared at me, his left hand caressed a worn leather strap hanging from his belt, something that was clearly decades old and held great value for the man. I bit back my tongue, for it burned to ask him about it, and instead leaned towards cordiality.
The curls between his legs shook and two fingers joined the tongue inside him, petting his prostate and pulling even more pleasure from his wrung out body. He convulsed, his voice hoarse from moaning Sherlock’s name, and bucked his hips forward with renewed vigor. Sherlock wrapped his lips around the tip of John’s cock and let him thrust up into his mouth, fingers relentless as the man lost control yet again.
The moment he unlocked it, his face turned four shades of red and he nearly dropped his phone. He fumbled it in his fingers for a few seconds.

“Strangers?”
“Hold his shoulders while I remove the intubation,” the doctor instructs quietly.
,” he began, voice twisting around the word like a python. “Stay with me.” There was something different about the way he said it, something sinister and enticing about his voice. John felt a tug on his shoulders, plucking him forward into the cave again. His feet seemed drawn like magnets, dragging across the dirt floor as the familiar fog drifted into his thoughts. Alarms rang in his head, though they were distant and unconvincing. “
Lestrade snorts next to me, hiding his laugh, and turns to mutter something unintelligible to John, who chuckles in kind. They both glance back at myself and Mycroft, a few more chuckles escaping them as they share a conspiratorial look with one another. Rolling my eyes at them, I begin surveying the room we’re in--an office of some sort. No evidence of disturbance--empty desk and shelving, save a few crumpled pieces of rubbish here and there from well over a year ago. The warehouse has been inhabited by rats--unsurprising given the leftover sweets materials lurking in the storerooms. Moran and his lackeys must have used other, more discreet areas in the building.

Again, thank you. <3 Fans are what make fanfiction happen.
I raise an eyebrow at him mischievously with a smirk. “Seems we are similar in that regard.”
As the bus pulled up to the stop, Sherlock stepped up into it, tugging at John’s hand and smiling down at him.
His voice breaks on a sob, and it jars me to reality. He deserves better,
--an amalgamation of his convenience store cologne (British Sterling), the fabric softener in his clothes, his inexpensive cedar scented soap, and the deep musk that I’ve always found comforting and familiar about him. I release one of his hands, threading my fingers through his hair and cradling the back of his head with my palm. He leans into my touch, opening his mouth wider for me and I eagerly deepen our kiss, leisurely rubbing my tongue against his. There’s a growl of pure need in the base of his throat as he grabs my hip bone and pulls me to him roughly, pressing our chests together. John’s heart thuds heavily with mine for a moment before he yanks himself away, panting.
If I could crawl under the table without seeming like a child, I absolutely would just to hide from her mischievous stare. Coughing, my brain finally comes back online with a suitable way to change the topic of conversation away from the fact that I’m shagging my flatmate. “Mycroft, he told you about what’s going on, yeah?” I ask, reaching for another slice of bread. “Let us answer if anyone rings, and try to stay home as much as you can, okay? They had you as a target once, they may do it again.”

Another few blinks, then a wide, sharp-toothed grin broke across the man’s cheeks, a dramatic shift that startled John. “The name’s Sherlock, mortal.” His hungry eyes roved down John’s suspended form a final time, then he nodded once and stepped away, clasping his hands behind his back.

I receive a sideways glare in response. “And do what? Watch me?” His tone is petulant; embarrassed. He knows this will be a struggle, and he doesn’t want an audience. If I wasn’t so concerned about the effects a fall would have on him, I’d give in and head upstairs to make tea, as asked. However, while my intellect may pale in comparison to his, it certainly doesn’t mean that I’m stupid. There’s no way I’m leaving him here alone to hurt himself, as he inevitably would.

Several hours, tests, blood draws, bandages, lectures, prescriptions, and moments of frustration later, I’m clean, treated, and discharged from acute care. My phone dings the moment I step out into the waiting area.
“Dr. Watson, it seems your recent captor has taken a liking to you,” I comment, handing Sherlock the envelope I acquired from New Scotland Yard this afternoon.

eyes glinting in the incandescence from above. His sandy blonde hair was disheveled, large chunks sticking in all directions as watched me curiously, his head cocked to the side. He was totally different from Moriarty in every way--where Moriarty always looked tailored and posh, Moran seemed to be opposite, both in appearance and personality.
. As I blink I’m at the cage, listening to him choke and cough on his panic for a moment before I whip back the curtain.
“John, open your eyes,” I arch up to whisper in his ear. “I want you to look me in the eye while you come. I want to see your brain shut down and your mouth go slack and hear the sounds you make while I claim you. Let me in, let me have you completely, John.”
Dropping his guard, John shoved gently at Sherlock’s arm. “You wanker!”
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock murmurs above me, voice huskier than I remember. Though part of me is relieved, I'm terrified at the implications of this admission. The pulse in his wrist flutters under my fingertips like a hummingbird. The doctor in me counts it automatically, a retreat to the safety of a role I know. I’m fully aware that I’m fleeing this uncertain moment and the swell of irrational emotion in the pit of my stomach as the seconds tick by.

Anderson, a man of humble upbringing and low wealth, would have spent nearly all of his earnings on such exotic ammunition, which begs the question: what was he hunting?
Closing the distance between us, I press my lips against his gently, immediately feeling the tickle of the hair from his mustache. John’s hands squeeze mine reflexively as he gasps into my mouth. Taking advantage, I slip my tongue past his lips to taste him, the sweet honey and bitter tannins from afternoon biscuits and tea washing over my taste buds. It’s coupled with an aroma that’s

Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, the great London detectives who didn’t even notice how much they wanted to get off with one another.” As he finishes, he dissolves into giggles, his shoulders shaking as he looks down at his feet. We laugh together for a few moments before our gaze meets again, both of us grinning like fools.
“I'll just tell you in person,” John said, fighting a smile. “It says

The room is suddenly too hot and we’re stumbling awkwardly towards the doorway to his bedroom, open mouthed kisses becoming frantic across cheeks, jawlines, throats. His hips are glued to mine, the hard length of his cock straining within his pants and pressing against my lower abdomen.

I’ve been investigating Anderson’s background. Seems he wasn’t much liked in the town, as he was a bit of a braggart. Additionally, he was apparently brash, irritating, and rude to the women. The most interesting fact about him seems to be his belief in the men of the forest who wear the skin of wolves, and that it indeed what he was hunting in the first place.

He keeps my gaze, eyes full of emotion, and nods sharply. “It’s settled, then. I’ll just--” He gestures at the door, giving my hand a quick squeeze before getting up to go sign me out and gather my clothing from Mycroft. I watch as they have a brief conversation outside the windows to the room, John’s face set with the firm lines of the soldier in him. Ready for battle. Ready to defend. Ready to protect. Mycroft, obviously noticing the steel in John’s shoulders, submits easily, keeping his body language passive and open. It’s fascinating to watch this power play between them. Seeing John take charge, draw up the Captain in him and emanate his authority in order to accomplish his goals--it ignites my core, desire threading around my gut and settling deep in my low abdomen with a curl of warmth.

“Your threats are meaningless Constable. Nevertheless, it’s clear: Anderson went off hunting something that outsized and outwitted him, and he lost. Perhaps he should have listened more carefully to the whispers about the forest before getting himself involved in something supernatural.”
“Off your tit?”

“I said I made it clear how I felt about him when I put a bullet in his kneecap, Sherlock,” comes the unwavering reply. John crosses his arms on his puffed out chest, clearly pleased with himself for this course of action. The satisfied smirk tugging at the corners of his lips crinkles the skin around his eyes. For a moment, he looks nearly happy, and it’s obvious the emotion is a stranger to him in recent months. As he watches Sherlock’s reaction, however, his smile fades and eyes darken substantially.
“Only when it matters, brother mine,” I reply coolly before he slams the door and does his best to stride away despite his obvious limp, coat flapping dramatically in the wind behind him. As they reach the doorway, John stretches to hand his cane to Sherlock, who keeps his own hands thrust into his coat pockets and glares back. John insists, and finally Sherlock relents and takes it before making his way awkwardly up the steps to the flat while his companion grabs the post from the next to the door and heads up behind him, no doubt positioned to catch my brother should he fall.
Usually I would expect some superficiality from him, but this is genuine, a sad smile gracing his lips. His eyes are rimmed in red, bloodshot and puffy, and it’s suddenly clear he’s been

and suppress a shudder. The effect he has on my physiology is uncontrollable, and I find myself not minding in the slightest.
I’m staring at the door and feel my heart thundering in my chest, blood pumping in my ears with a sudden surge of anxiety. What lies beyond that door? What happens when I open it back up again? I suppose I never really closed it all the way in the first place. I pulled it as shut as I could, but the secrets of that life continued to spill through the cracks, bleeding out until they finally overtook me completely. The life that

, the therapist at the hospital said. That’s what he’s doing to me--he’s refusing be a part of this conversation with me because he’s afraid of the confrontation.
“For God’s sake, John!” I shout, startling him. He glares at me, head tilted and eyes narrowed. “Out with it!” The demand fills the space, then dies away just as suddenly, and we are caught staring at one another. I dare not blink, lest the intensity of the moment be lost.
A full minute passes, and my patience thin, I finally ask with a tight voice, “So we can...?” As I watch him open and close his mouth, nose scrunching with irritation at himself, my own thoughts begin their battle over what he might be trying to say.
“You need to rest,” I state firmly, willing my voice to be still. I can feel the weight of his eyes on me, pinning me to the stairs. I know he’s searching for evidence, watching me. Finding all the clues that give me away. Picking apart my defenses, peering into the darkest parts of me.  “Let’s just--we have a long way to go,” I add, begging him to just

He nods in understanding, but refuses to move from the door. I suppose the flat does look dramatically different. The chairs we usually occupy are in my bedroom, along with their tables. I rolled up the rug (dancing on hardwood is best, of course) and stashed it in the corner behind the couch. The table proved to be the most troublesome, as it required some disassembly in order to remove it from view. A final circuit around the periphery was all I needed to contain the rest of the clutter in a few boxes that I stowed upstairs in John’s old room along with the table and chairs. It took no less than two hours to complete the job, despite Mrs. Hudson’s best efforts at interrupting me more than a few times.

Mycroft barely pays me a glance, his eyes flicking towards me as casually as if he were noticing some leaves rustling in the wind.
Two black tufted ears were bouncing through the tall grass towards him.
My heart pounding, I reach for him until my body freezes with a single thought:
a coincidence. I live here too! What floor are you on?”
Though I have solved the initial reason for my trip here, I intend on staying until I can further explain my observations this morning.
Is this what is happening between John and I? Is he merely fond because I almost died in his arms? Because I
John could hear the sarcasm in Mike’s text, but he couldn’t be bothered to argue with him. He’d just stepped out onto the main lawn of the campus and less than fifty metres away stood the young man he’d passed on his way to the dining hall before practice every day since uni began.
And if he’s relieved, it means...he was
Trigger warnings:
This is Mycroft’s fault, too. All of it is his fault. My madness, Sherlock’s near death, our separation. The horrible look on Sherlock’s face.
I don’t think I’ve ever slept that soundly in my life.
“John.” His gaze snaps up to mine, the hesitation to continue and urge to flee evident on his face. I must do something to lighten the mood, or he’ll give up entirely and I’ll lose my chance forever. “I can’t have you making a fool out of yourself in front of all of those people. Then they would forever associate your foolish gyrations with me, and it would tarnish my reputation.”
” Sherlock commanded, yanking hard on the backs of John’s knees. “We’re doing something...
Sometimes, John blinked and found himself strapped to a tree trunk or suspended from its branches by his feet. He would blink again and choke back a yell of surprise until the pain from the invisible ropes biting into his skin was too much. He whimpered, he moaned. Nearby, Sherlock watched, milky eyes narrowed and unblinking.
Pinching the bridge of my nose with one hand, I sit fully upright, clutching the phone tightly in my other one. John stares at the ceiling, fists pressed down onto the tops of his thighs and breath whistling noisily in and out of his nose. I watch his chest rise and fall sharply, discomfort pooling low in my gut as I realize he’s fighting off a sympathetic nervous system reaction to my outburst. Channeling my anger outward, I command harshly, “

“Must you
“I’ll repeat myself. Impressive. Perhaps next time we can work on your dip--”
“Wuzzat?” Mike asked, leaning over to take a look.
He blinked at his hands. They looked old, skin wrinkled and veins prominent. The tips of his fingers were calloused and worn, nails grubby, short.
The intensity was ratcheted up beyond levels I’m familiar with. The way he paced and glared, agitated, frustrated, and…
“Yes, sir. Right away. Doctor Watson, this way please.”
Sherlock waves his free hand dismissively. “Details. Plus, if I had crutches I wouldn’t have the pleasure of your...

“How do you think I kept myself safe with all those undesirables around back when my husband was...you know…,” her voice drops to a dramatic stage whisper. “...selling all the cocaine?”

the sign.”
John is right, we fucked this up royally, but everyone was so worried about Sherlock...
And, he was unsure, which worried him (and me) even more. He’s not supposed to be the unsure one; that’s my role in this relationship, yeah?
Not John, though.
As I’m internally flipping through a stack of files, looking for the London boltholes that I’ve already tied to the criminal network, I’m startled back to my surroundings by a firm hand on my forearm. Blinking rapidly to clear my vision, my eyes finally focus on John, standing in front of me.
The lactic acid settles in my muscles, making them ache from such exertion. The adrenaline, however, continues to make my heart race, and I feel an intense desire to look again towards my companion. I want to see if he’s recreating his expression from the restaurant. I need to know whether he is still interested in me after such

are,” Moran beseeches. “Let us help you lose this last bit of dead weight, shall we?”
What would Sherlock say about that? He’s a pragmatist--surely he’d realize that Moran’s death would be the most efficient way to solve our problem. Charles is hardly invested enough to pick up the mantle and run a “consulting criminal” organization--he’ll flee to the next villain looking for a grunt, to the next opportunity to carry out his sadistic fetishes.
Smooth violin music flows around us, a natural beat already established that urges us to dance. Taking another full breath, I nod and retrieve the files in my Mind Palace related to the waltz.

“Fine, I’m

As his hand wrapped around the man’s pulsing cock, he was rewarded with a hiss, followed by a sharp bite on his earlobe. He would have yelped in pain had he not been so utterly exhausted.

We shared a look that told me all I needed to know. As I gathered my belongings, my sight fell upon his lower leg, which was wrapped several times over with the worn leather strap I had seen him caressing the day before. He followed my gaze, and without a word reached down and unwound it. As he did, his body morphed before my eyes, shrinking and losing the excess of hair that covered it. In the span of two breaths, what lay before me was the pale haired man I knew.
Beyond the quiet, unassuming sounds of the phone was something different;
It's the most genuine smile he's given me since I've returned, and it turns my thighs into jelly. In all of the scenarios I predicted, I never thought about how much he would affect

One, two, three, four, and…
The sobs in his throat finally broke free, erupting from his slack mouth as he shoved his face into the pillow in an effort to stifle the cracked, embarrassing sound coming from his core. His body shook beneath the sheets, muscles spasming as he finally let go of every false wall he had thrown up around this vulnerable, raw part of him. He cried until he could cry no more, and then laid still, staring at the floor.
“Shut up.” He leans back and looks up at me, cheeks flushed. “I’ve got to talk to Mary.”
“Come
Do take care, Martha.
John arrives precisely when I expect him to, holding a large bag of takeaway and sporting a false smile. He stands in the doorway, shifting back and forth on his feet, as he glances around the living room of the flat.
“Let me--uh...you sure? Did you--what’s happening?” he stammers, warring with himself over his instincts to take care of me and his discomfort with the current
“Stop! You’ll pull his arms out of their sockets, you arsehole!” I shout at Charles, every ounce of rage and fear constricting my voice. Sherlock’s assailant relents, choosing instead to release and knock him down, his face slapping against the concrete. I hear the sharp huff of air through his nostrils as he pauses, willing his body to be still.

Words are just words, they
Bringing my attention back to my companions, I watch them stare at each other after John finishes reading the message. Their eye contact is loaded, intense. Clearly a nonverbal discussion about the inherent threat to John in the document, and the need for a battle plan. Sherlock’s face is twisted up into an expression somewhere between pained and confused, fingers drumming anxiously on the car door as he no doubt flies through every possible iteration of what this message means and what he can do about it to protect his beloved John.

He’s come to ask something of me, and he’s nervous about it.
John was entranced by the way the man said the word
His stomach growled again, so he grabbed a bowl from the dish drainer, set it on the table, and dumped the remaining oats into it. The steam from the kettle rose in front of his face as he poured out the boiling water, covering the oats. A few floated to the top, swirling around the bowl as the water began seeping into them. His chair scraped across the wooden floor as he scooted himself closer to the table, inhaling the familiar scent of the cooking cereal.
Taking a deep breath, I reply, “I…”
With an exaggerated step into the room, he drops his gaze from mine and strides into the kitchen, dropping the bag of takeaway on the table. John turns and grabs two plates from the cupboard along with two forks from the drawer, and pulls out the containers of food. The smell of basil, lime, and chilli permeates the flat, drawing me to my seat and making my mouth water.
Unconsciously, I lean towards him, mouth brushing against the outer shell of his ear, and murmur, “I don’t mind.” He shivers and closes his eyes, breath caught in his lungs. The effect I’m having on him is obvious, yet I find myself looking down for visual confirmation. His jeans are stretched taut across his groin, and the sight of it wrenches a moan from me, rumbling low in my belly. As I pull back to look at him, his eyes are still squeezed shut, a pained expression across his features. “John.”
. This...it's so confusing and hard to explain.” He drops his head into his hands, fingers scraping along his scalp a few times before he throws his head back again in frustration with himself.
be. As time goes on your memory will start to fade, will start to blend with your imagination, and it will make it even harder for me to find him before he comes for you,” I plead, not bothering to hide the desperation I feel.
He squeezed his eyes shut and stepped into the circle.
Once I returned to the village, I partook of a small dram of morphine and settled myself by the fireplace to let me thoughts wander without tethers. I do some of my best thinking in this state, as the anxieties of daily life are stripped away and my consciousness is free to roam. I awoke as the early roosters announced dawn, the soft grey light peeking through the curtains at the opposite end of the dim room.
“Your brother--” I gasp as he sucks on my pulse point, hands snaking up my shirt to tug at my nipples.
Pining
A barely-there smile hovering around my lips at the thought, I pull out my phone and shoot a quick text to Sherlock while walking back into the office.
Right?
An involuntary shiver makes its way up my spine, pulling us both to reality. John blinks and looks down. “

And so, I suffered the long journey to arrive in Werben. My first stop will be to the very blacksmith that crafted said bullets in the hopes that he might share with me what Anderson could have needed them for.

, and I can feel his annoyance at it.
I struggle to my feet and stagger towards the door, unlocking it so I can whip it open. The street is empty outside the flat, no sign of John.
He tightens his grip on my hand, interrupting with a nearly silent, “
“What?” I gasp. This isn’t how it goes, this isn’t what happened!
There is more to this world than science can explain presently, though I’m sure in time there will be some logic behind it. Some would try to say that magic exists, based upon the encounter I had this morning. I am still trying to wrap my head around it, grateful for the dram of morphine I packed for this trip.
Mycroft huffs, looking out the windows while his jaw works, teeth clenching in frustration. Finally, he replies evenly, “And what makes you think he’ll return to Baker street?”
Discomfort pools deep in my core, settling like ice.
He kept a small garden off to the side of his house in the solitary patch of sunlit land in this part of the forest, and it was chock full of overgrown tomato plants teeming with ripe, sun-warmed orbs. The smell of the leaves was comforting and distinctive, wafting towards me as I circled the structure looking for a means inside. An open window at the back of the house was easy access into his bedroom, and I traversed it deftly.
“As I was saying, there is plenty of time for us between exams,” he said, standing abruptly and slinking over to John. He rested his hands on John’s waist and pulled them together, lacing his thigh between John’s legs.
Day 5
Placing a hand on his knee, I interrupt, “John, he was a lunatic. Hardly reliable as a source of information.” He shakes his head, though at me or himself remains unclear.
His feet shuffle across the lino as he moves a bit closer and rests a tentative touch on my hand. Though I flinch, I fight to keep it in place. Every instinct in me is screaming to
“Greg, bide wi’ me!”
in the air.
“John, no, I--I can’t.
"What does he need it for?"  I asked. Lestrade shrugged, throwing the hot iron into his water and filling the shop with steam. It was then that I gave up and left, bidding him good morning.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, earning him a poke in the ribs. He squirmed and swatted John’s hand away, saying, “
There are secrets in this town that no one is keen on sharing. No matter. I’ll sniff it out, regardless. I am, after all, the great Sherlock Holmes.
, but I need to observe as much as possible to figure out where he’s gone. The sooner we find him, the sooner we can put this behind us and move on with our lives. The manic energy that usually fills me during the hunt thrums in my veins, though for entirely different reasons. The chase, at any other time, is the most thrilling part of our adventures, yet today...today I just want it to be over. I want to go home and curl up with John in my bed, running my fingers down his bare chest and burying my face in his neck. I want to smell nothing but his distinct musk, a purely animalistic reminder of his masculinity and the magnetic pull it has on me.
Feet frozen to the floor, he stood, incapable of anything,
They both knew it was a lie, but Sherlock flicked his finger anyway.
He went to therapy after I died.

“The usual, sir?” Anthea asks from the front seat, detached. Her voice startles me from my musings and reminds me that there’s a war on.
Enjoy and thanks for your continued support!! Also, Happy Easter for those that celebrate it. :)
“John, I won’t leave. Not without you,” he insists, stepping around the table and taking my hands gingerly in his to examine them. “I promised.” He presses a kiss to each of my sensitive palms and smiles.
I am sure you’ve heard tales of shapeshifters, of men who can transform their visage between human and beast.
, Holmes, or I’ll have you arrested.”
After a few seconds of giving in to my wicked tongue, his hands come between us, pushing me away gently. Not a rejection; just a pause, a moment to catch his breath. “Can you...maybe wait to kiss me until you have some pants on?”
. It’s bizarre, sitting next to a hospital bed with living, breathing Sherlock, covered in scruff and grime and bruises, while a clear-as-day, flawless hallucination stands above, chiding me. He stares, unblinking, and I feel the surge of my usual annoyance towards him. He won’t leave me, not now, even though I’ve asked. He’s only left me alone when...when I was drugged and beaten. When I had given up completely. When I knew my life was over. That was the only time he abandoned me, and it was probably just from the effects of the drugs rather than my mental state. I sigh, scrubbing my hands over my face and give in to my loneliness and base desire for socialization. “Yeah, but when you wake--”
“Sherlock, my mug is here.”
“John, I appreciate everything you’ve done to help my brother, but at this time your services are not necessary,” Mycroft states as evenly as he can--a mask. His fist is tight on the handle of his umbrella, however--tension. Anger. Fear. Hurt. Pain. His knuckles are white. He’s just as scared as I am, and apparently it’s causing him to be an idiot if he thinks I’m leaving right now.

A twinge of pain from my thigh shoots up into my groin and down to my knee as I shift, and he offers his hands to me at my grimace. I glance up at him through my dripping hair and watch as his eyes flick down my wet, nude body, this time settling directly on my obvious arousal. He licks his lips, a deep rouge creeping up his cheeks. After another moment of staring, he makes eye contact and frowns, coughing with embarrassment.
Mycroft lets out a long suffering sigh. “

“Is it?” John asked, contempt in his voice. He winced at the sound of it. It'd been a while since he'd interacted with humans. Especially female humans. Pretty ones, at that.
“Aye, same, Brodie. I’ll hae a pint, if ye please,” John answered, plopping down on the barstool next to his neighbor. The barkeep set down the heavy glass in front of the man with a wink, wiping the spilt liquid with a towel before moving on. In the corner, a jukebox played some heavy rock music, filling the silence between the two men as they slugged back the cool lager.
It made all this effort worth it.
“What for.”
That made Sherlock turned to face John. Beside him was a tray with toasts, jam, coffee and were that strawberries with whipped cream?
“No. I spend the last few weeks trying to make the perfect proposal so you’re going to wait.”
John tightened his hold, “You wouldn’t.”
John shook his head at his stupidity, as he went back to his desk. He put the blame on the lack of sleep. In his right mind, he would never try to flirt with a stranger, especially without being 110% sure that the person in question was into him and most importantly into guys.
“John.” Called a voice from the sofa.
“Don’t you want to remember our time at Uni once we are older?” John argued.
Today was their last day in Ireland, although John felt a bit sad about leaving the place, he also missed London too. One week away was all what he needed but he couldn’t leave in this peace, country side life forever, at least not for the moment, maybe when they are older and want to retire, but for now the call of the city, the thrill was too much of a magnet for the both of them.
“What sherlock?”
“Mmh yes?”
“I hate you,” John gave in as he grasped his lover’s lovely curls, commanding his mouth to draw closer to his. Sherlock groaned at John’s tongue invading his mouth and bucked from the bed in other to get closer to John’s warm body.
“Come on, John! I want to see the waterfall!” Sherlock shout from 5 meters away, as John was trying to get the best light for the picture.
From that moment on, they were nearly inseparable through the entire summer hols. Sherlock was trying to teach John his art of deduction, most boringly obvious things John could see, but almost everything of importance needed to be pointed out or showcased. They spent hours solving petty crimes, for instance, who had stolen Mrs Hinkley’s prized cottage-pie recipe (really no one had, Sherlock had solved that one within seconds of being in the house and noticing the ashen smell which hadn’t come from the log fire but instead a poorly hidden pile of paper ashes on the floor of the kitchen, but he’d still spent the day trying to figure it out with John, until he’d finally come to the only sane conclusion himself; self sabotage) or capturing the culprit who was painting unsavoury things onto all the police cars in town (an old bully of Sherlock’s from the year above, Brendon Ward who’d returned for the summer hols, and was now doing community service for the church), and the most riveting of all crimes, the murder of Whiskers, the British shorthair who’d been the towns beloved cat for decades (that had turned out to be a hit and run, no malicious intent, just an asshole with no regards for local pets), they had become the crime-solving duo of the town.
They’d spent the next half an hour discussing boring adult things, like the weather and schools, plans for the future, etcetera, (however not so boring when discussing John’s plans for the future, to enlist in the army as a medic, the unspoken ‘university is too expensive right now’ hung heavily around John - as if he had had this exact conversation with his mother way too many times) then, finally Mummy said, “Alright you young lot, go off and play. Dinner will be at 7, come on Jane, the four of us will retire to the drawing room. Sherlock why don’t you take Harriet and John to the kitchen for a snack.”
“Ah, so wonderful of you to join us, brother mine. Now are you going to stand at the door all day or say hello to our guests?” Sherlock glowered at his brother for giving away his position, but preened as his mother piped up in his defence.
“Anyway, who’s this? Did your mum pay someone to spend time with you? Wow, that’s really something.” Sally laughed, her friends, who flanked her rather like cronies than anything else, barked out their own cackles. Sherlock simply rolled his eyes, glaring stubbornly at the floor.
Mycroft
friend like that? And no I’m not being paid, thank you very much, he’s got too much dignity for that, unlike you, who apparently has no dignity whatsoever.”
Sally’s nostrils flared angrily at John, and she took a menacing step forwards, only for Anderson to come to her rescue, “At least she’s not a bloody psychopath!”
care! You
There was another long pause.
The unspoken ‘since dad died’ hung heavily in the air around the three of them.
“Did I leave anything out?”
“Exactly.” She looked up at him with her big, amused eyes, “It’s stupid to make him think that, so go over and bloody apologise to him. And make it mushy, he’s got a soft spot for mushy.”
In that same high pitched gasp, and he was coming in ribbons down Sherlock’s throat. The taller boy gagged slightly, swallowing down as much of the ejaculate as he could, the salty, yet bitter taste wasn’t totally revolting. The fluid dripped from the corners of Sherlock’s lips, and as he looked up, John collapsed to the ground, practically glowing. He kissed Sherlock passionately, like a dying man in a dessert in desperate need of water, with Sherlock as his only supply.
Their hostage situation didn’t last long or at least it could have been a lot worse if Sherlock’s brother hadn’t intervened, Micheal or something was his name, John heard Sherlock complain when they were finally free.
John watched her go, and was surprised to hear Sherlock’s baritone voice from behind him.
“Oh. Well….” The handsome man ran a hand through his hair, “It’s an original,” He admitted, “I compose when I’m in one of my moods, it helps me think, my mind seems to unlatch and I’m able to express my feelings.”
“No, not really.” John shook his head.
“I’m coming, hold on just a sec.” John said trying to capture the beauty of the mountains with his camera. As they walked through the path to the Waterfall, on the mountains, there was wild sheep eating grass, minding their own business, and from time to time you could hear them bleat.
“I’m not really in a mood for sex.”
“God no, you’re far more than that, far more valuable.”
Sherlock didn’t like being photographed. He hated it and avoided it at all costs. And if by any means a picture of him was taken, he would make his mission to find it and destroy it. That’s one of the reasons there weren't many pictures of him as a child, to his mother dismay. However, by some miracle a few pictures survived, this was due to his mother cleverness at hiding them very carefully and out of his reach.
“Sherlock,” The older man greeted him, “Always in trouble I see.”
“Oh my god, I’m so sorry. Are you alright?” Was the first thing the woman said in a very distinctive Irish accent.
“Sorry,” John shook his head, coming back to earth, “Yes, Of course. I’d love to go out with you. Name the place and the hour and I’ll be there.”
"Not exactly how I planned this date to go," John said.
“So you ain’t got a boyfriend?” John asked during their meal.
It has been weeks since their encounter on the stairs, and Sherlock was desperate for John’s attention. They hadn’t managed apart from a few conversations to really get to know each other and Sherlock as too much of a coward to ask him out yet. So, for now, he would let himself daydream while playing the violin by the window.
“Come on it will be fun, Sherlock.”
Sherlock was awaken by soft lips and a small stumble on his skin doing what would surely lead to naughty things.
“Erm, no, It’s alright. I’m fine thanks. I was surprised by the hit that’s all,” John replied, in a polite smile, giving the ball back.
Sherlock was in his usual sulking position on the couch but his whine was met with silence. He moaned once again trying to get a certain doctor’s attention.
“Look mate, There nobody in this world who loves you more than Sherlock. He would never do that to you so take that idea out of your head.”
“Spoil what?” Sherlock yelled frustrated.
“John you can’t be serious.” the yarder cut him off. “First of all he would never do that to you, second he’s Sherlock, the fact that he’s in a relationship with you is already a difficult thing to archive.”
“I didn’t actually Propose,” John told him.
“Nothing much, just apologising for hitting me with their ball.” John said, stroking his jaw again in remind of the pain.
“I can clearly see that.” He said eyeing Sherlock’s figure. Sherlock furrowed his brows. “You’re stick and bones, not an ounce of fat on you, I can’t even understand how you are able to stand without breaking a bone.”
“Well, I don’t.” He got up from Sherlock’s bed and walked over to where his best friend was. He grabbed the back of the chair and turned the genius around, “So please, Sherlock. For me.” John half begged- half whined, making his puppy eyes, "take a selfie with me."
Sherlock huffed but seemed to agree.
“We wait for them to come to have a chat and then hope for the better.”
This picture was for John, he told himself. He looked toward the camera that his mom was holding and made the brightest smile he could while embracing his new best friend.They had funny triangle birthday party hats on their head, Sherlock’s father had compelled all of them to wear one, even Mycroft. John was holding on his other hand a piece of cake smiling with a few teeth missing.
Sherlock glared at his lover, he didn’t like when John ignored him, and he’d been at it all day. So he stood up and walked to John, who was currently sitting on his armchair. Sherlock had barely time to reach John that the doctor had already closed his laptop and had gotten up on his feet.
“Admit what?”
“Oh where you from?”
Sherlock only let out a “Fine,” before he slide down the bed, turning his back to John, so his lover could be the big spoon and kept typing on his phone.
The journey was long though, from England to the south of Ireland, where they would be staying, so Sherlock booked them a cabin for the night. All was planned out by the second week of August, now they only had to pack, get their passports and leave London behind for their Holiday of sex. Even though he didn’t call it like that in front of John.
“No?” Sherlock stood up.
The first few times, John let it go. He didn’t move a muscle, he was way too tired. He only turned over in his bed, put a pillow on his head and tried to fall asleep, he had come back from a tiring long shift at work, after one busy day at uni. He was dead on his feet so music or not he’d sleep like a rock.
John snorted, and without hesitation leant up to smother Sherlock with kisses until his face was pink and a dopey grin crossed his features. He scrambled over the side of the bed to his backpack, and before Sherlock could register what he was doing, he was snapping a picture with his brand-new Polaroid camera. The picture came out and John held it steadily from Sherlock’s reach until it had developed.
“Nope!” John grinned, moving closer to trail little pecks up Sherlock’s jaw, “I love this, you look so peaceful, so… calm, sexy, even.” He drew back, punctuating every compliment with a kiss, creeping closer and closer to Sherlock’s lips, “Cute-,”
John shrugged, moving his hands up to smooth out the wrinkles in Sherlock’s shirt, “We lost track of time.” Then he pulled Sherlock in by the lapel and kissed him square on the lips. They kissed for a moment, then John pulled back, “Sorry, was that alright?”
“That's a bit hypocritical, coming from you, wouldn’t you say?” Before John could do much more than scowl at the accusing comment, Sherlock elaborated, “I mean, isn’t that what you do? I’m guessing from the way you look at her and act around her, you’re the type of brother who lets her stay up late when your mum isn’t looking, and you secretly buy her the chocolate she likes every weekend? You probably let her sleep in bed with you after watching a scary film or if she has a nightmare? Am I wrong?”
“I was going to say extraordinary.” John muttered, “How… how did you know all of that? Just from looking at me? Honestly that is insane, that’s actually amazing.”
and then the fabric was ripping, John was falling and Sherlock was stumbling after him. So now they lay next to each other, sunlight slowly drying them. Freckles adorned John’s neck and chest, littering his skin like clusters of constellations, and Sherlock was fascinated.
And with that, for once, Sherlock was on the winning side of a fight with Sally Donovan. All because of John Watson, averagely extraordinary in his own way.
Sherlock felt a heat rise to his cheekbones from the gush of compliments, having only ever received them from few teachers and his parents, hearing such things from John seemed to send Sherlock into a momentary stupa. Sherlock cleared his throat.
Sherlock looked up at John through his lashes and caught John’s thoroughly wrecked appearance. His lips were swollen from kisses, mottled bruises sucked into his skin marked a trail up his collar bone, and his eyes were molten with lust.
“Didn’t think so, now back to my previous question, rugby or football?” Sherlock persisted, eyes narrowed in focus.
mentioned he’d made a few acquaintances at Oxford, maybe someone had come to stay?
They laughed again at that.
A young boy with tawny blond hair, and sapphire eyes stared straight at Sherlock, lips twitching into a grin that seemed to say,
Harry grinned, she felt like a special operative in some secret spy mission, “Crystal, boss!” Then she was turning tail and running back up the path to the house.
John watched as Sherlock swept out the door, tousled curls bouncing as he flashed him a simply predatory grin. He shook his head, God, he couldn’t imagine a future without this brilliant and utterly baffling man. They made it through the rest of the day, and soon enough John was getting ready to head home. They were alone in the hallway, barely out of sight of Sherlock’s family and Harry who were saying goodbyes outside. He grabbed Sherlock by the shirt collar and planted a firm kiss on his lips. They heard Harry bark out laughter and the Holmes parents exchanging pleasantries. Sherlock was more than convinced by the look his mother gave him, warm and ever so slightly reprimanding, that they had most definitely been caught in the act. But frankly, he couldn’t care less.
“Don’t pay them any mind, Sherlock, they’re all just idiots.” John mumbled into Sherlock’s hair, despite him being much taller. Sherlock was almost hunched over in his embrace with John, yet he was more comfortable than he’d ever been standing straight, just being this close to John caused a wash of calm to sweep over him.
“I-I don’t, I haven’t done this... before.” Sherlock gasped, eyes clenched shut. John paused to look Sherlock in the eye.
“Not helping!” John found himself gasping, still hyperventilating, there was wetness on his cheeks, his heart was beating sporadically. His hands were desperately clutching his hair, but he couldn’t seem to let go. He was aware of what was happening, but wasn’t in control of himself.
She sent him a wink, “Only when mum’s around.”
Oh God, he thought,
He growled.
“‘Piss off.’” John seemed slightly taken aback from Sherlock’s language, obviously thinking posh people didn’t swear, “Or ‘bugger off’, take your pick.”
cute!”
Sherlock, who was still sat stationary with his blanket, was startled back to the life of the living as his own trousers, pants and shirt were thrown in quick succession at him, “Get dressed, you great oaf!” John hissed, scrambling around the clearing to gather the socks and shoes they’d thrown aside to play pirates in the water earlier.
“Us! If we don’t get back to my house-,” He checked his watch again, eyes widening in panic, “17 minutes ago!”
Sherlock coughed awkwardly and tapped his own neck, “I might’ve… gone a bit… uh-,”
“Was that an example or were you simply adding to the list?”
Sherlock set him an unimpressed look, “Anderson, don’t talk out loud, you tend to lower the IQ of the entire street. And, please if you’re going to try to insult someone, do be original, instead of just copying your dreary girlfriend.”
John raised an amused eyebrow and let out a laugh, “It should scare me how gleeful crime makes you, but I can’t help but think how adorable you look.”
For the rest of the afternoon, they basked in their post-coital bliss. Curled up together on their blanket, they mellowed in the warmth of the sun's late glow, kissing occasionally, reveling in the fuzzy feeling in their chests.
Sherlocked nodded, “We should probably come up with an excuse.”
it’s Harry!”
“Stand up.” Sherlock ordered, watching with lidded eyes as John stumbled to his feet and leaned back against the trunk of the tree they’d been under. Sherlock shuffled forwards to meet John, tracing his hands up John’s thighs to rest at his hips, pushing back experimentally. Then he leaned forward, pecked the head and moved down to lap at the pool of pre-cum above John’s hip. He made his way back to John’s cock and began to pump with his fist, tongue swirling around the tip and dipping into the slit at the top. John’s knees quaked slightly at that, one of his hands came down to fist into Sherlock’s hair, the other clung onto the tree bark as Sherlock suddenly dropped his hand and encased John’s cock with his lips. Tongue still swirling, Sherlock slowly made his way down, inch by inch, letting John’s dick slide further past his lips.
Looking now at the picture, years later, he smiled, thinking they looked pretty cute. Sherlock wild curls all over his face, John’s cheek against his, bright sparkling eyes, full of glee. What surprised him the most was Sherlock’s smile. A real smile, one that reached his eyes. It made John feel special. He knew he was one of the rare people, if not the only one, to be able to photograph a smiling Sherlock. Maybe it was what made Sherlock keep this picture.
“Okay give me your phone.” John asked.
After lunch they took on the road to their cottage, it was also near the beach, they were close to the Durmon East, a very nice place. Their cottage was just on the coast, they had an amazing view over the see and the beach. It really looked like a dream vacation, and bonus it was actually warm enough to go for a swim.
“They left a note this time.”
John smirked, their eyes promising each other a very eventful night. “Right now I’m trying very hard not to kiss you.” He told him.
Furthermore, who didn’t like a sex holiday? Because that was totally what Sherlock was aiming at. For the whole trip, John would be not working, so all his time will be available for Sherlock to enjoy. No responsibilities, no grocery shopping to do. They would move at a slower pace, that means hours and hours of very long sessions of lovemaking in bed. They could even explore a few new things, in other words, spend a lot of quality time together and without worrying about being too loud and wake up Mrs Hudson.
“I would never have thought I would hear those words coming out of your mouth,” The grey haired man said in a half laugh, taking a sip of his pint.
“Yes.” Sherlock shrugged as if it was no big deal.
“I’m not packing for you.” John said determined, turning around to pick up some more clothes. What should one wear in Ireland? It was just like England, in one day you can have the four seasons. He didn’t want to overpack though, they were going for only one week.
“You know,” he said between breaths, “Back in my army days, I would carry around our graduation pic everywhere. Every night I would look at it before bed. It kept me going. Reminding me that someone was waiting for me at home.” He admitted.
Sherlock sat at the table at Angelo’s nervously. His right foot tapping against the floor while he tried to appear relaxed and confident. However, his heart was beating fast and his mind was racing with thoughts of total disasters that could happen this evening and fuck up his only chance with John.
“Hey John, been a while since I saw you. we have to schedule a night out.” The detective welcomed him cheerfully.
“Come on, Sherly. Just one picture.” His father encouraged, while putting a piece of cake in front of his son.
“Of course.”
“Yeah,” John said in a sigh.
“You’re the one who’s been avoiding me for weeks.” Sherlock pointed out containing himself from not shouting. “You don’t even pay attention to me when I’m talking anymore. I didn’t hear a single ‘Brilliant’ coming out of your mouth for weeks now.”
Sherlock after spending long hours searching on the internet decided that Ireland would be a good choice for their vacation. It was close from home, they spoke mostly their language even though Gaelic was still present. The best part was the high probability of rain that would force them to stay in bed all day. whoops.
“John who?”
“But-” John started but was cut off.
“John I-” John had his hand on Sherlock’s face, making it hard to breathe and even think.
John kept turning the pages, revisiting the past, back and forth, remembering Sherlock’s happy face not unconscious full of blood. Suddenly he couldn’t take it anymore, he let out all of his pain and cried onto Sherlock’s pillow, on *his* bed, hugging it hard, wishing it was his best friend instead.
John took a deep breath before speaking again.
“Cheater!” He heard behind him, but John footsteps close by.
He sighed. He had searched in the entire living room but couldn’t find it, so Sherlock probably left it in his own bedroom. He was out so John didn’t bother to knock. He gave a quick glance around the room and saw a wall full of newspaper headlines and articles. He took a step closer and realized that a few press articles  pinned to the wall were concerning both of them and their cases.
“Perhaps, I should.”
John had told him, he wanted somewhere close enough from England, so that the plane tickets wouldn’t be too expensive and the trip wouldn’t last too long. He couldn’t stand sitting in a long flight for more than 5 hours, his shoulder would start to act up.
The following day was almost identical to the previous one, they longed on the beach, sunbathing and walked along the beach holding hands. Peace and quite were the key words for the day.
“Oh God yes.”
John was confused as to why Sherlock had kept and pinned this photograph on his wall when he had spent hours ranting about how much he hated it. So why would he decide to keep it ? John let it go as soon as he found his laptop on Sherlock’s bed and exited the room.
Sherlock nodded.
John let out a sigh of resignation, banging his head in a thump against the door.
Sherlock only rolled his eyes.
“You’re fine and free to go. The drugs will completely leave your system in less than 24h.”
“Don’t take me for a fool. I’m not stupid.”
John eyed Sherlock up and down and then glanced back at Greg.
“Yeah, enjoying some free time away from the big city.” John nodded.
So this time, to everyone's surprise, it was Sherlock that initiated the action of immortalising this moment with a picture.
“Thanks love. Now turn around, it’s your turn.”
To that their eyes met and they couldn’t hold on their giggles, the nerves finally letting go.
At this, John made an incoherent sound.
John did as he was told, and despite the fact it made little-to-no difference, he did feel a lot better. Sherlock grabbed the rags of his shirt and passed it over as a towel.
God, was he adorable, so sleep addled, John mused, barely able to keep the dopey grin from his face.
“Alright, Harry, that’s enough!” John was panicking now.
Sherlock’s hands were scraping gently down John’s back as they kissed feverishly, mouths melding together and hands wondering; just as John paused to trail kisses down Sherlock’s throat, there was a knock at the door.
John shook his head, he couldn’t, everything was too much, why was everything too much? He felt a hand touch his cheek, and at first, he flinched away from it, but the hand stayed steady, it felt warm, and slowly he let himself be brought back.
When she, daddy, Mycroft and Mrs Watson had moved on and they’d arrived in the kitchen Sherlock turned to John, with curiosity on his lips and said, “So, which was it, football or rugby?”
“What do you want?” John whispered.
“Rugby, of course - and I know you played a sport because you’re more physically fit that most teenage boys our age, obviously you haven’t been going to a gym - where would you find the time or money for that? So that leaves a sport, you’ve got broad shoulders, not the physic of a tennis player or a swimmer, you’re used to playing in teams, I can tell that from your friendliness, you’re used to meeting new people, which is odd as your sister and mother seem to be very antisocial in their behaviours, which leaves team sports, and therefore the most popular British team sports for the working class - rugby or football?” Sherlock finished his speech, waiting for the following anger patiently. When no anger came, Sherlock nervously took another glance at John and continued with his deducing, “I can also tell you’ve moved here because your father recently passed away, I overheard before I came in that our mothers used to go to school together, so I’m guessing your mum moved you up here to get away from any memories of your father, yet she didn’t want to feel alone in the move. However, you seem to be the only one unfazed by his death. Your mother still wears his ring, Harry’s sucking her thumb again, both obvious coping mechanisms, but you, you’re fine. In most part - I’m guessing you had a breakdown when it happened? Sudden then, either an incurable illness - obviously your family don’t do visits to the doctors for various reasons, be it money for prescriptions or… privacy,” John flinched at that, Sherlock’s earlier suspicions were solid now, “so he got ill and it wasn’t until he was on deaths door anyone knew, or he was killed in a work accident. From your mother’s accent, I can tell you’re working class, housewife, probably, if not something small to keep money coming in - waitress, shop assistant, etcetera - But your father, now he was a working man's man. Building, construction, something like that. So there leaves the choice from illness or work accident, however due to the fact you’ve moved so far away, I’m guessing your mother had some time to plan, save money - a couple of months maybe? Plus what used to be your university fund, so she made arrangements, that house on Oak Crescent was sold a week ago, and now you turn up - you haven’t just come here for hospitality. Which explains, your mother brought you here because she needs a friend, not just an introduction to the neighbours, the death of a husband is a hard thing to go through alone. So is the death of a father… but not for you. Maybe it’s because you love the rest of your family too much, or it’s because you
adorable.
Sherlock jerked away, “I am
One Sally Donovan’s voice was the loudest of them all, “Oi, freak! Go back to your mansion, bet mummy’s missing you, isn’t she?”
“Go? What, no! You’re seriously going to let them talk to you like that?” John looked incredulously at him, before turning to glare at Sally, “Listen here, what gives you the right to talk to
Sherlock blinked at her and then went to grab his jacket, “You’re smarter than you think.”
It took John a moment to register that the reason his laugh sounded so wet, was because tears were still streaming steadily down his cheeks, “Hey.” He replied, taking a few long breaths, “Sorry, haven’t had one since… in a… in a while.”
“... Sherlock?” John seemed a little taken aback by the intensity of Sherlock’s stare, “Is there something wrong?”
know that you prefer to think of yourself as a sociopath, even though, clearly you’re capable of emotion and at least some empathy.” John laughed, “But, no matter, it’s all the same to me Sherlock, you’re still my friend, no matter what any of those pricks out there say about you. I know you’re not a psycho, and I know that despite your weird experiments, and your brilliant brain that runs over 100 miles-per-hour, and your unemotional front, you’re no freak. You’re extraordinary. And you’re
John grinned back, “A lot very good.” They linked hands absently, and began the walk back. It took them exactly 7 minutes and 48 seconds to reach the window at the back of the Watsons’ home, and there lay a red collared polo shirt, much like the one John had been wearing earlier. He slipped the shirt on and checked in the reflection of the kitchen window that nothing could be seen - thankfully everyone was in the living room at the moment. So, daringly, he turned back to Sherlock and took his hand.
“No-no, I know.” John sighed and wiped almost aggressively at his face, “I just spiralled for a minute… I can’t - my shirt… and mum finding out-,”
“Come on, John, lets go-,”
He would throw himself, wholeheartedly at John Watson.
Sherlock blinked at him, ever so slightly shocked. Despite the obvious grief his sister and mother held, the boy (who was definitely Sherlock’s age, if not, older) seemed to be completely unaffected. A step-father, maybe? Yet he and the girl were both too similar in looks…
John moaned weakly into the kiss, eyes fluttering shut as Sherlock left his lips in favour of kissing back down his chest and abdomen. Sherlock sat up, hooking a leg over John’s, to rest inbetween the other boy’s thighs. His nimble fingers made quick work of John’s jeans and belt, unbuckling them to yank them down his legs. Once again, Sherlock glanced up to ask for permission.
Sherlock grinned, “Ah, yes, a shot in the dark that one, but you just confirmed a moment ago when I mentioned ‘privacy’. Now, privacy is something crucial to someone hiding a secret, there wouldn’t be privacy in changing rooms, which is why your father stopped you from playing rugby. It’s obvious you still love the sport, so would never quit by yourself and will stop at nothing to carry on playing, be that professionally with a league, or amateur games with friends. I’m guessing he also saw the sport as being homoerotic in subtext and pulled you out of it so you wouldn’t turn out ‘gay’ or some such other malarkey. Now, of course going for annual check-ups would possibly compromise your parents so blissfully constricted image of the nuclear family, should someone notice the plethora of bruises normally on your skin. There’s no doubt that he wouldn’t be sneaky about it, a prideful man, wouldn’t want anyone finding out he gets blind drunk and beats his son whilst his wife and daughter pretend nothing’s happening in another room - so no doctors, brushing visible only where clothing can hide, which shows in the way you dress. Long jeans, despite it being the middle of summer, there’s nothing to hide but the action has been beaten into you. You’re wearing a dark shirt, and still are wearing a tank top underneath, obviously to make sure no skin discolouration is detected. Your stance, the way you sit, the way you addressed my father, calling him ‘Sir’, more than a few times, I would’ve guessed a military background, but you’re only 17, and there haven’t been any wars, no reason your father needed to have enlist, so no military background. Just a father with a killer left hook when he’s wasted half the weeks wages on too many pints of dish-water tasting beer.”
I don’t like being called
Now, they were alone by a creek in the woods past the back of the Holmes manor, John’s shirt was torn from his shoulder to his belly leaving room for golden skin to peak from its depths. Like children, only moments before they’d been pretending to be pirates, slashing at each other with sticks for swords. In a final battle fought most valiantly, John had slipped on a mossy rock and tumbled to a most imminent death, but not before Sherlock grabbed onto his shirt, thought momentarily
are adorable, I am stoic perfection.”
“Wrong.” Sherlock blurted, rolling his eyes dramatically at his brother, yanking a shirt and trousers from his wardrobe, “You don’t have
“Hello.” Sherlock whispered, “You’ve come back.”
Sherlock heated at the wanton words, but shook them from his head, “If you keep stalling, you won’t be the first to touch me right now.”
Mycroft sighed as John shuffled to stand, glad that any hints of arousal were scared off as soon as Sherlock’s brother had entered the room. The elder Holmes placed a hand on his companion’s back to steady him, “This is my friend, Gregory Lestrade.”
Sherlock gave John an unimpressed look, “Obviously.” He said with disgust, “One could tell just by the
Sherlock grinned, “Bit very good?”
“Do not apologise, John.” Sherlock said softly, yet sternly, “You’ve nothing to apologise for.”
“Come on, Sherlock, it’s…” He glanced at his watch, “Oh, shit! It’s 6:45, mum said dinner was at 6:30- Sherlock come on! Get up! We’re late!”
With a quick nod from Sherlock, whose face was flushed red, John began to stroke Sherlock from base to top, twisting at just the right angle to have Sherlock throw his head back. John started to kiss up Sherlock’s chest, biting and sucking his way up to Sherlock’s neck. Once he found the most sensitive spot, he bit down, tongue flicking over the skin as he sucked it into a blossoming bruise. He carried on with his ministrations up to Sherlock’s ear lobe, taking the flesh into his mouth and tugging on it gently to elicit another one of those breathy moans from Sherlock’s lips.
“Dull, I was done much before everyone else.” He turned to glance at the other family, catching the boys gaze yet again, “Hello… my name is Sherlock.”
They’d been solving a case - Sherlock couldn’t even remember what it was about now - and they’d been interviewing a girl a little younger than they were, Sherlock had been so harsh on her he’d brought her to tears. That had been a no-no for John and when Sherlock had sneered, “Oh, she’ll get over it, sentiment it simply a human defect, John! Really, I’ve weighed everything, and some tears from her are hardly worth saving for the end goal!” John stood up and made to leave the room.
“Oh, calm down Harry! Just give us a minute, alright!?” John turned to pull his trousers on over his pants and realised with a forlorn look at his shirt, that it had been completely ripped in two… and covered in stains. He sent Sherlock a vicious look.
Sherlock and John barely had a moment to scramble apart and fix their clothing before the door was being pushed open and Mycroft stood accompanied by another man Sherlock didn’t recognise. Mycroft gave them a glance and his lips twitched in amusement.
“Wrong.” John grinned, voice imitating Sherlock’s own usual impassive dismissal, “You do care, you pretend that you don’t. It’s okay to care. I care about you Sherlock, which is why I had to stand up for you. Also, you’re not a sociopath, being autistic doesn’t make you a sociopath!” John paused then, face a mess of worry, “Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that-,”
John had left him there, and within minutes Sherlock had finished the case and anonymously tipped the local police. Then he’d gone back to the manor to sulk. It took two days before Sherlock realised what an arse he’d been, and from Harry no less, who’d practically been living with Sherlock and John at the manor, making phone calls to Clara whenever she could.
When John turned back around, Sherlock had collected himself, and was mostly dressed, left only to button his shirt back up. John found himself gazing at Sherlock, eyes wondering over the slowly disappearing skin, following the line of red and purple marks dotted up his chest and collar bone. Thankfully, as Sherlock finished the last few buttons on his shirt, none of the marks were visible. He looked up, realising he’d been staring long enough to be noticed, and glanced away bashfully when he saw that Sherlock had caught him staring.
Mycroft sent him a blank look, “Neither did you two months ago, now well… you’ve got more than just a friend.”
“What on earth did you do that for?” Sherlock groused, sniffing indifferently, but allowing John to nuzzle his way back into his arms.
Sherlock palmed John through his pants before hurriedly getting rid of them, then suddenly he paused. He stared lustfully at the flushed head of John’s cock, tongue darting out to lick his lips. A droplet of pre-cum dribbled onto John’s abdomen as his prick sprung to attention.
“Thank you.” Sherlock had whispered, slowly pulling back from the embrace, “Really, I don’t care what they say, I know it’s not true.”
“Okay, it’s only been half an hour. Harry, you like to run, don’t you? I can tell you ran all the way here. Run back. Say you really needed the toilet, so you came back to let everyone know we were on our way, then, go up to John’s room, get him a shirt, any other red shirt and throw it out the window into the potted plant in the back garden. Clear?”
“John, Sherlock are you out here? Mycroft said- Oh God! My eyes! My poor innocent eyes!” Harry stood by the edge of their clearing, covering her face as she simultaneously screamed and gagged, “Why me!?” She wailed.
Sherlock let out a strangled whine, head thrown back as John went back to his previous actions, stroking Sherlock’s cock and nipping bruises into his neck.
they were interrupted.
“Memories?”
His gaze flickered to John’s eyes, as if to ask, ‘may I?’
“Wait- hold on- wait a minute.” John let out a breath, pushing gently at Sherlock’s shoulders to have him sit back up, “Sherlock-,”
“Harry, you can’t-,” John began, the furrow in his brow signifying he didn’t really want to be telling his sister off.
“What?” Sherlock yawned, blinked blankly and sat up.
“I don’t care if I hurt her feelings, John! What I care about is solving the case!”
Sherlock reached over into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small bottle of lube. Handing it to John. He took a moment to wonder what on earth Sherlock was doing with an unopened bottle of lube in his pocket, but was swiftly swept back into action. John coated one hand and warmed the liquid with his fingers, then slowly, reaching up to capture Sherlock’s lips again, he pushed the first finger in. Sherlock flinched slightly with discomfort, but as John continued to kiss him and pump his fingers steadily, the discomfort ebbed and soon Sherlock was writhing mess underneath John.
“I… that’s not what people usually say.”
“If you’re asking what sport I used to play in high school, that would be rugby, but how did you-,” John was cut off again, and despite the baffled annoyance on his face, he had yet to shout at Sherlock like most others in his situation had.
John snapped back into action and continued to pull Sherlock off, “Answer my question. What do you want?”
“Rude? Invasive? Completely inhumane?” Sherlock supplied, readying himself for the barrage of insults.
Sherlock smiled adoringly at John, “Perfect.”
“Right, ‘spose we should apologise for being late.” John said.
Cheeks hollowed out, Sherlock swallowed around him and John’s hips gave an involuntary thrust.
“Fuck, please, Sherlock.” John moaned, a deep flush painted across his torso and up to his neck, he was so lost in the sensations he hadn’t realised how far they’d come. Sherlock grinned and went back to kissing John’s chest, lower and lower, he followed the happy trail of hair down to the line of his underwear, then down again to his upper thighs.
“Oh, yay! You remembered! Hardly anyone remembers, all my teachers call me Harriet! Except for Miss Oswald, she remembers, that’s why she’s my favourite.” Harry grinned up at him, having obviously gone off track.
“Bugger.” He mumbled and hoped he wasn’t too late. He rushed straight over to the Watson’s, and sheepishly asked John to join him on a walk before saying anything else. They’d arrived in a clearing by a creek - a place that had once just been Sherlock’s, and had, over the weeks, now become theirs - and sat down side by side, John began to skim stones. They’d sat in silence for a moment, before Sherlock launched into a stilted and awkward apology, explaining how stupid he felt for pushing John away like that, and before he could finish John himself was giving reasons why he had been wrong to stay so angry at Sherlock.
John began to piston his fingers into Sherlock’s hole, scissoring them as he aimed for his prostate. Soon enough he hit the spot, and-
“‘Course, we’ve heard all about you. I’m Jane Watson, and this is my daughter Harriet and my son John. We’ve just moved into the village.” Her accent was softer than most cockney accents Sherlock had heard, yet was still very prominent. What Sherlock clung to most, however, was her son’s name, John.
“Where do you think you’re going freak? Running off back to mummy?” Phil sneered, looking quite pleased with himself.
He’d taken a leisurely walk home on his last day having just finished his final mock-exam, feeling a treat for himself was in order. He strolled through the wildlife that surrounded the small town and connected to the back of the Holme’s manor, following the creek and taking a pause at his special place - a small clearing at the edge of the creek that lead to a small set of mossy rocks and rapids. Mycroft had been back only a couple of days, and was found, as per usual these days, entertaining their parents in the parlour whenever Sherlock appeared home from school. After not having visited for the Easter hols; it seemed he felt the need to make up for it. (Sherlock didn’t much mind, he preferred the house without Mycroft. Mummy, however had thrown a fit and a half when the news came that her eldest would be staying at Oxford for the holidays.) So, when Sherlock grabbed an apple from the kitchen, he was rather startled by the unfamiliar laughter coming from the living room.
He would allow himself that one weakness; from now on, he would do anything to keep John happy and smiling by his side.
If mum saw she’d know, there would be no way she’d think John was off with some girl from the village - he didn’t have any time to do anything like that, what with spending every waking minute with Sherlock. Besides they hadn’t even really talked yet, it wasn’t a one time thing, but was it just a summer thing? Was it a relationship thing? Or a friends-with-benefits thing? Mum didn’t even know he was bisexual yet! This wasn’t how he wanted to come out to her!
“Sherlock if you start deducing right now, I will be forced to take you straight back to that bed and have my way with you - now kindly shut up and let’s
“I do hope you two aren’t too preoccupied for lunch?” He raised an eyebrow, earning a sneer from his younger brother, “Mother wants us all down in five minutes, if you wouldn’t mind… freshening up and coming down, I’m sure that would be appreciated.”
“Overboard?” Harry snorted, “What are you? A vampire?”
John and Harry, who visited mostly and only for the phone and the food, practically lived at the manor, which was actually pretty good for their mum, who spent hours setting up her home business as a seamstress (she was quite good, even Sherlock could admit without bias, she’d once mended one of Sherlock’s suit jackets after it had been ripped in a tussle with a shoplifter, and she’d had it back to him, almost good as new in hours) so she could spend more time setting herself up to be a more steady income of money for her children. Sherlock had never had a friend before, and the moment when John first called him his friend, Sherlock had almost teared up. The two had been stopped by a group of teenagers that went to Sherlock’s sixth form, where John would be attending for his last year in the coming autumn, and immediately began shouting abuse at Sherlock.
Sherlock please, I’m going to-,” John let out a high pitched gasp and his knees buckled forward again, “Sherlock!” He groaned,
“Anything. I could suck you off, like you did to me… I could edge you, touch everything else but your dick for hours until you’re so pent up, you’re begging for release… I could finger you-,”
“Proof.” He stated with a grin, “And memories.”
“-alright, alright. Listen to me. It’s okay. You’re alright, you’re in our place, it’s me and you and your sister and it’s alright John. Come back to me.” The sound of Sherlock’s voice, a calm and cool baritone lulled his subconscious into security, and almost as soon as his panicking had begun, it subsided. Sweat dripped down John’s neck and he realised he’d been gripping onto his own hair so tightly, he’d pulled some out. Slowly he let his body relax, and with an unsteady breath he turned back to focus on Sherlock.
They had met at the beginning of June. The days had already begun to get warmer, so Sherlock had often ditched his tie and jacket, as the school had allowed a slip in the dress-code for exam-goers.
Sherlock smiled at him, “You’re my friend too, John. I’m not half as extraordinary as you are.” John didn’t say anything to that, because he knew Sherlock wasn’t talking about his smarts, but the change he brought to Sherlock’s life.
John gave him a bewildered look, yet somehow continued to smile fondly at him, “I didn’t say anything.”
something about it.”
“Of course I remembered, I remember all the important things.” Sherlock said unblinkingly, as if it was something of real importance. Harry’s smile seemed to widen, “Now, what was it you wanted to ask me?”
right there-
Sherlock gave a wicked grin, “No, but London’s better - more crimes, more excitement!”
love the abuse.”
“Yes, you are.” John said in a sing-song voice, grabbing onto the headboard either side of Sherlock, essentially trapping him. Sherlock looked petulantly up at him, hair in a dishevelled disarray, and eyes a stormy blue.
Greg was a tall, handsome man with sandy brown hair and a brilliantly awkward smile, “Hello, uh, you must be Sherlock, it’s great to meet you-,”
Sherlock let out a garbled string of expletives as John added a second finger, shortly after, a third finger soon followed, “Oh… Oh-
“Of course there is, right down the hallway on the left, there’s a desk and a phone, it even has a chair. Take as long as you like - we hardly ever use it, anyway.” Why on earth Sherlock was being so kind to these people, he couldn’t really fathom, only that he really wanted a few moments alone with John - to study him, of course.
Sherlock shook his head and began to shift, he couldn’t hold back any longer, “No.” he breathed, “Please don’t… freak out.” He murmured, then he was moving closer and closer to John. Eyes locked onto John’s lips, his own shirt, an unbuttoned white cotton, was draped haphazardly on his shoulders, and it slipped down his arms as he moved to glide a hand over John’s chest, and up his neck to rest on his face.
John captured Sherlock’s lips with his own, grinning to himself as he felt he pout melt from his lips. He deepened the kiss, drawing weak sighs from Sherlock’s throat, and suddenly pulled away, “You are a magnificent, wonderful, amazing, beautiful, peaceful, calm,
Sherlock looked closer,
Sherlock stared warily at her, “Aren’t you too young to use that language?”
Summertime was coming to a close, and for the first time in a very long time, 17-year-old Sherlock had a friend. Young John Watson was funny, smart, yet still average enough that Sherlock felt awed when John would describe him as ‘
John gave him a bemused smile, “Why? What do they normally say?”
“Yes, yes. I
Sherlock had scowled at her, “But that’s stupid-,”
“That was too many adjectives, John.” Sherlock mumbled, eyes downcast and cheeks renewed with a magnificent ruddy red.
Sherlock scowled, “I’m
Then, slowly, Sherlock leaned in, eyes open and studying John’s face as he lightly pressed his lips to John’s. When he made no move to discourage Sherlock, the taller boy began to kiss him again and again, eyes now slid shut he moved from his face to his neck. He followed the breadcrumb-path of freckles down John’s torso and tore the rest of the shirt away with a simple tug. He trailed delicate kisses back and forth between John’s abdomen and the corner of his lips. Then, suddenly, as if he’d only just realised what was going on, John reacted. He surged into action, capturing Sherlock’s lips with his own and, opening his mouth hungrily, he allowed Sherlock to swipe his tongue over John’s lips.
John fumbled for a minute, recovering from thinking he’d offended Sherlock, which was nonsense, because he’d been quite right in his deducing, “Well… I had a friend in primary school, he was a lot less high-functioning than you, but you’re aspergic, right? You show some of the same behaviours he did. The most obvious is your lack of understanding social signals and cues, which is what makes people think of you as ‘weird’ or ‘different’. You’re obsessive with your cases, and your deducing - and let’s not forget your bees.” Sherlock smiled at that. He’d remembered when they’d been curling up on the red sofa together in the living room, watching some silly sitcoms on the tv, someone had killed a bee for comedic effect and Sherlock had become so angry - John had found it quite funny, but was sympathetic all the same, “From what I can gather, before I came along, you’ve had a complete lack of interest for people in general, and didn't have any friends, which still upsets you.” Sherlock opened his mouth to defensively disagree, but John shut him up with a look, “Also, your complete lack of understanding for sarcasm just tops it off.”
“He’s spending a lot of time with you recently.”
“Please, you’d be lost without my help.”
“John, don’t over-exaggerate.” Sherlock dismissed the comment with a brush of a hand.
“Try me.”
The inspector just rolled his eyes, “As I was saying I’ll need to ask your friend to some questions about the incident”
“Sherlock, what are you doing here?” Lestrade asked, taking his coat from behind his chair and shrugging it on, ready to leave after a long day of work.
“Okay…” Greg trailed off. “Well, I have had a shite week so I won’t say no to a few pints.” He said showing Sherlock the way out, “Let’s go.”
“It will be adventurous, I thought you’d like it...”John tried to appeal to Sherlock, “and wouldn’t it be thrilling to have sex on the beach in a place where everyone could see?” He wriggled his eyebrows to prove a point.
“Who was that?” Sherlock eyed him suspiciously.
“Hey, there…” He greeted.
“No,this one is blurry. I want another one.” John complained.
“Well, You are,” Sherlock said, “And we work very well together. Lestrade said so.”
“For everything you make me go through, I should. But, I don’t.” he paused “Sherlock, I am certain that John isn’t leaving you. “ And with a lighter tone he continued “but I will always be happy to let you mope on my shoulder while you pay me some pints.”
"Why not?" Sherlock asked indignant.
“Delete it,” Sherlock said, unphased.
“The fact that I wouldn’t be able to stop.” John licked his bottom lip, trying very hard to not dish dinner and go directly to dessert.
“Lestrade we are both physically and emotionally drained, we just want to go home and sleep. We’ll come by tomorrow promise.” Sherlock even put on a soft smile to help his case.
“You hate pubs.” He stated.
The stranger frowned, curious about this new creature in front of him. He gave John a once over from head to toe and that’s when John realised he was barefoot on a stranger’s doormat, dressed in a worn out t-shirt and old pyjama trousers. Not the best impression he could give but then, why would he care, he was mad and he wanted the music to stop, he didn’t come over for tea and make friends. However, John pondered, it wasn’t a very good way to introduce yourself to a dazzling stranger whose stunning eyes were scrutinizing him.
Here goes nothing.
John was looking at the postcards, trying to find a good one to send to his sister.
John sighed, defeated.
“Those photographs were what kept me going when you were dead, I mean abroad.” John words were barely a whisper, his eyes locked on Sherlock’s.
. He had work to do. He got his coat from the coat rack just beside the door and followed Lestrade.
“It’s alright. Me neither. Just cuddle with me.” He dropped another soft kiss on Sherlock’s neck.
John looked to his side and saw Sherlock, likewise tied up, his arms behind him, sitting on a chair. He didn’t look alarmed but rather bored.
“What is it?”
“Good?”
“The effects of the drugs will wear out in 20 minutes or so.” A voice said beside him.
John was currently in their living room, looking for his computer. Sherlock  had probably been using it again without his permission. Sherlock had a thing for using his stuff and never putting them back where they initially were. The army doctor was used to his flatmate lack of boundaries, it took him years but he was used to it by now. What pissed him off was when he couldn’t find his things back. He didn’t have the patience to look for them. He liked to find his stuff were he had left them in the first place. But talking to Sherlock about it was like talking to a wall that is a lost cause, he had tried before.
“Not your business.” John teased.
“Yes?”
“I came to you tonight because I need your help to regain John’s love.”
John watched them play and couldn’t help his lips to turn upwards into an affectionate smile. How come that Sherlock had problems communicating to any adult person but when it came to kids he was in his natural element and managed to create a bond very quickly. John stared at them for a while and then went back to his cross word trying to find the final word missing.
He smirked to himself, he should try to play louder next time in order to meet him again.
[...]
“I’ve been shopping.”
They climbed in, going home after a crazy day and almost engaged to each other.
Sherlock had already walked up and down the stairs a million times in order to accidentally encounter this “new” acquaintance, he was about to give up this stupid idea when John finally appeared by the front door.
He put his clothes in boxes, not even realizing that he smelled each collar of Sherlock’s shirts before folding them. Once he finished that, he decided to go through his lab equipment, maybe he would give it to a school.
“Have you put some on, yet?” John asked.
[................]
The days flew back and in no time it was finally September and they were off to Ireland, they took the boat at night so they would sleep for the majority of the trip. They checked-in for their cabin, small and compact but John was used to it back in his army days. They disposed of their bags and went to have dinner at one of the Ferry’s restaurants.
“I’m going to see Lestrade.”
John smiled triumphally and start to pack what they would need for their night out. This was going to be fun.
John sighed, “It’s GREG.”
“I don’t need a photograph to remember. I have an excellent memory, John.” Sherlock huffed.
“Right of course.” John shook his head at his stupid question, playing with his food with his fork. “It just surprises me, that’s all.”
“Yes, love?” John mumbled.
“Nothing, It slows my mind, I’ll just have a glass of wine.”
“What if I don’t? Pack, I mean.” Sherlock asked, his tone teasing.
“Are you done looking through my phone?” Came his baritone voice.
They left the water when they started to get cold and their fingers were all wrinkled from staying so much in the water. They laid in the sun to dry, it was now past four in the afternoon so the sun wasn’t as hot and dangerous. John let himself fall asleep to the sound of the waves and gulls and woke up some time later by Sherlock kissing him.
“What’s stopping you.”
They stayed up there for a while enjoying the scenery, the beauty of the see, the calm waves rocking the boat. At this hours the deck was mostly empty which he was thankful for as they could easily find a bench and enjoyed the sunset in silence, holding each others hand, side by side. They sat like this for what seemed for hours.
“No shit.” He chuckled. “And It’s Greg.” He added with a pointed look, “But anyway, I knew something was off, you coming to me for anything else than a case. Plus, without John by your side.”
Holidays were nice but Home was better.
Years later when Sherlock would come across this picture, his lips would turn up in a smile at joy expressed in that photograph. All he could think is that he would never regret taking it.
It was an easy deduction to make, that packing wasn’t done till much more later.
“You certainly act like one, sometimes.” John joked, turning his head around in order to kiss Sherlock’s forehead.
“Yes,” I want to caption that marvelous sight of yours for the eternity.” and he pulled his phone out.
“I don’t see the utility of it,” was Sherlock’s reply, “you know that I don’t like being photographed.”
After their first case together, things started to improve. They had exchanged cell phone numbers and had had longer conversations by text than any other time face to face. They kept meeting each other from time to time walking out or into the building. Sherlock had by then memorise John’s daily habits but didn’t want to seem like a stalker so he tried not to meet him too often or look suspicious. They also had met for coffee a couple times.
“Hungry?” John asked smirking.
“We should get going and have a early dinner since we’re in for a very long night ahead.”
John who hadn’t seen him till then, looked up as he climed the stairs and smiled broadly when he saw Sherlock.
“Hello John, to what do I owe the pleasure?” Sherlock asked innocently, trying not to look too much pleased with himself. John couldn’t know he had done this on purpose.
“Thanks.” John smiled at him, walking away.
“So…”John trailed off showing the album in his hand as Sherlock opened his eyes to the incoming voice. His eyes focussing immediately on the photo album.
“Just admit it.”
Sherlock then took a real look at John.
It had been about over a week since John had moved into his new flat, and when he finally got to meet his upstairs neighbour who loved to play loud music at odd times of the night, messing with John’s sleep schedule.
He was acting like an infatuated middle school teen with his first crush. However, his plan worked perfectly. Soon enough there was knock on the door.
John let himself be lulled by the waves and at some point he may have drift off because the next thing he remembers is being gently shaken up by Sherlock, offering him to climb back down and go to bed.
“My Proposal !” John yelled back, throwing his arms in the air.
“Fine then. I’m going for a swim, wanna join?” he asked.
“Why not.” John shrugged.
“Sorry.”
“Sure,” He took the bottle that John was holding and made John move forward on his sunbed so that he could sit behind him and apply the sunblock.
“Greg, mate we need to talk,” John said walking into man’s office without even bothering to knock. The detective inspector rose his head at the new guest.
“Oh did he?” John got curious, of this new piece of information.
The man in front of him seemed surprised to see him again, his eyes widened and his mouth opened as if astonished.
John begged.
“I’m sorry, have I disturbed you again?” Was the first thing John heard once the door opened.
“You were going to propose to me?” Sherlock asked surprised.
“Can’t you deduced it?” John raised an eyebrow, with a teasing voice. “It doesn’t matter, now come on have some,” he said brushing a strawberry over Sherlock’s lips, prompting him to open his mouth. As Sherlock took the fruit with his lips, they grazed John’s fingers who lingered, his thumb sliding over his full bottom lip.
“Paparazzis take really good picture of me” John teased, winking.
“Would you like to help solve a murder?”
“I know i’ve been distant recently but it’s because I didn’t want you to deduce it and spoil it.” John half shout the end of the sentence.
“London.”
One night, though, studying at his desk for his finals, the music was getting on his nerves. It was loud, frenetic, demented. High screeches could be heard as if a cat was being tortured and ripped apart. John was going mad. His focus gone, his temper up, he stood up aggressively and walked out of his flat determined to put an end to this. Enough was enough.
They nodded at each other in greetings as they passed each other.
“You’re a medical student,” Sherlock stated.
They wouldn’t need to take the plane but the ferry, which was longer than the plan but felt more adventurous. Besides, Sherlock loved the ferry, it made his inner younger pirate self delighted.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but didn’t protest, deep down he knew his doctor was right. Besides he wasn’t about to say no to John touching his skin, no matter what. He loved his hands, loved to feel them on him.
“Me sleeping in a tent, on the ground, probably freezing.... I’ll pass.”
“Great, I’ll take the lasagna.” John smiled at his victory, “who knows if you finish your plate, you might get a reward.” He teased.
Sherlock’s hands found their way to John’s shoulders, grabbing into, feeling the hard muscle underneath his lover’s shirt, then his hands traveled down his chest. John pulled back a few millimeters.
“It’s fine.” He waved it off, he’s been to war, he endured a gunshot, he could survive being hit by a volley ball.
“No.”
“Where did you get all that?” Sherlock mumbled, his eyes half close due to the brightness in the room.
He doesn’t know where or when he woke up, he tried to move his hands but they were tied to the back of the chair he was sitting on. His throat was sore so he tried to cough it out.
He cleared his throat and focused on those blue eyes instead of his wonderful cupid shaped mouth.
“Just maybe next time try to practise during the daytime. The neighbours, apart from me, will appreciate.”
“Because I want to surprise you.” He said kissing his soon to be fiancé. “and because it's my punishment for you ruining my proposal and making me believe you were cheating on me.”
“Tired?” John mumbled.
He held him close, trying to show him how much he loved him. He then kissed Sherlock just behind his ear. Sherlock’s hand came to rest on top of John’s on his belly, interlinking their fingers as he put down his phone with his other hand, on the bedside table. He then drew closer against John, settling himself to sleep too.
“I don’t.” The genius replied quickly.
John looked up at him and smiled broadly
shorts that emphasised John’s strong tights of well-defined muscles due to years of playing rugby. It took Sherlock’s breath away.
Then they climbed to the top deck to enjoy the landscape. It was very windy up there since they were only surrounded by the sea, there were no barriers to stop the wind from blowing. Thank god they thought of taking their coats before coming up here.
The Ex-army doctor cupped the detective’s cheek, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb, his others fingers playing with Sherlock’s hair on the back of his head.
“I thought perhaps you’d like to come for a few pints with me,” Sherlock said.
“Is it a big difference if it’s you or me?”
Finally, John draw back a little, gasping for air. The kiss made him dizzy as if he was in a dream.
“Sherlock?”
The next day, it was very much the same thing, wake up kisses, broad smiles from waking up in each others arms. The captain announced to them that breakfast is ready to be served and that they will arrive by noon. They got up and after a good shower and getting dressed they went to get breakfast. Sherlock refused to buy anything except coffee but as they sat down and John ate, he would pick some of John’s plate. He didn’t mind if it meant that Sherlock was eating.
It rang again, and he considered unplugging it.
Though it’s challenging to hear clearly, I can make out the faint sound of a resigned sigh before the doorknob turns with a

“Coming?” John calls, leaning through the doorway towards me. Summoning my courage from God knows where, I stride inside and follow him up the stairs. We remove our jackets, hanging them by the door, and I consider how to say what I
The man frowned, bringing his hands together to wring them once before reaching out to rest them on the sides of my arms. “Mr. Holmes, there are...rumours,” he whispered, his cheeks darkening with shame. “There are rumours of...men in the forest.”
His face is set with determination, serious and calm. No evidence of his earlier uncertainty--in this moment, he is absolutely sure of what he wants. My heart pounds, breath caught in my lungs. My chest feels painfully tight, squeezed in a vice of mingling fear and anticipation. Our eyes meet and the barest hint of a smile tugs at the corners of his lips.
John nods and turns to look at the nearly bare living room, then nods again and takes a step forward, then stops. (Oscillation. Curious.) “What...how do you…,” he trails off, gesturing towards the empty space without looking at me.

“Better not, Mycroft. You know what he’s like when he’s made up his mind,” John warns. “Trying to keep him here any longer will only give you and everyone else in this hospital a headache. And that’s the

Collapsing boneless into John’s arms, I inhale his perfect scent with shuttered eyes, allowing him to pull me upright while I lean against him, finally feeling the warmth of safety encompass me. A murmured hum of approval escapes my lips as he snips the zip ties holding my arms behind my back and I curl myself around him, shutting out reality as I ground myself on the sound of his breath in his chest and the strength in his frame. He chuckles, wrapping his arms around my shoulders and planting a gentle kiss in my hair.
I snatched out my notebook and searched my desk for a pen, throwing the materials down and plopping into my too hard chair.
At this, John’s rage overtook him and he whipped his head to the side, glaring. The wild eyed, curly-haired man was crouched next to him, his head again cocked as he stared, unblinking. His eyes shone blue-white like thick, frozen ice on a waterfall--opaque and milky.
First, it was shock. Then,
John could barely tear his eyes away from the pictures on his phone long enough to acknowledge his friend. Weaving through the seats, he stopped dead in front of the spot Mike had saved for him and took another long look at the screen.
Blink, blink. “As long as you’re doing it for purely selfish reasons.”
Following our stumbling, awkward attempt at getting him fully dressed (interspersed with a creative variety of curses from both of us), we find ourselves standing at the doorway to exit the flat. Mycroft texted moments ago to let us know he'd arrived and was expecting us, yet neither of us seem intent on breaking open the relative safety of Baker Street. The entire atmosphere has changed between us, settling somewhere in the middle of nervous excitement about this new dimension of our relationship and the comfortable familiarity we held before everything happened.
“Mycroft,” he called, beginning to shift out from under his pet. The cat rolled over, exposing his belly, and purred loudly. Without thinking, John reached over and ran his fingers through the fluffy undercoat, massaging lightly. Mycroft purred louder, squirming around on John’s lap until he lost his patience and rolled in on himself, clutching the weathered hand against his belly and kicking the underside.

“Give me your name.”
It was then that I lit my pipe and turned away to stare off into the black woods while he drove on in silence. Better to spend my time speaking to people who may actually have information than those who like to spread pathetic rumours and little else.

does that mean?”
John returns my smile with a lopsided smirk. “I know.” Something unspoken passes between us--a fondness, a brotherhood of the men who tolerate and, at times, admire my brother and his ridiculous quirks. A new understanding.

I hadn’t considered fully how my absence would affect his life. Though for me, it felt as if I had engaged in a 2 year intermission from the main drama of my time on this planet, for him it apparently was an ending of one chapter and subsequent new beginning.

Seconds, minutes, hours, days passed--John couldn't tell, as the moment felt timeless and yet instantaneous. The world stopped spinning, the trees stood still once more, and above him, he heard the call of a crow.

Finally, he clears his throat. “I’m not…”

In my mind, it’s a quiet evening at Baker street. We’ve just solved a case (double murder posing as double suicide, barely a 5) and are releasing the pent-up energy left over from the adrenaline rush of earlier by dancing together. He brings me around the room, holding me close while smiling up at me his secret, fond smile reserved only for me. Lamplight twinkles in his eyes, highlighting the golden flecks in his irises. The music flows through us both, binding us together like invisible cords. We are inseparable, joining together as a single entity entirely at the whim of the violin.

He stepped up onto the bus and followed Sherlock to a seat near the back, knowing the ride was going to take some time. As he looked up at his boyfriend beaming next to him, John knew he had made the right choice, even if it did make him late for his next exam.
“Oh!” Her smile turned sheepish, “I was… um… well do you have a house phone I could use? I promise I’ll only be five minutes! I just want to call my best friend, Clara…”
“Um, we won’t be a minute.” He assured. Once Mycroft and Greg were gone, John turned to see Sherlock emerging from the bathroom, hair combed and wearing a fresh change of clothing.
“Yes-,” Sherlock gave a loud whine, “Please John, I need… something inside…”
“Right, that’s okay.” Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, “Right, when your mum sent you out to get us, had they eaten yet?”
They lazed like that for hours, bantering, kissing and occasionally getting more passionate. As their kisses grew into something much more demanding, of
John turned to frown at her, “Miss what…?”
Sherlock was met with silence for a moment, before John was letting out a full, belly-aching fit of laughter, eyes squeezed shut and almost hunched over, clutching at his stomach. Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle along with him, laughing quietly behind closed, yet upturned, lips.
Without blinking Sherlock inhaled through his nose and pulled off, dragging his tongue over the ribbed underside of John’s cock. Then, almost instantly, he swallowed back down, cheeks hollowed and saliva dripping down his chin.
Obviously the father had just passed away, as the woman still adorned her wedding ring - had she left him or been left, no ring would be in sight, and she definitely wouldn’t have been rubbing at it tenderly every now and then, which indicated a sense of loss. There was a hollowness behind her eyes that could have only been there after a death of some kind - therefore her husband was no longer with them, as opposed to simply being at work. She was frail and by the yellowing of her finger nails, had recently picked up smoking - a boring case, Sherlock thought, she read like an open book. The young girl next to her had short, blonde hair, big blue eyes, and despite being around 12-years-old was sucking her thumb, an obviously recently picked up habit, shown by how she would forget to do it every now and then. Leaving her thumb in her mouth without actually sucking at it. Yet another indicator that a close family member of theirs had passed away was the way she was burrowed into her mother's side, whose arm was wrapped tightly around her, as if to protect - yet they were both quite safe and comfortable in the Holmes house. Neither seemed to be on edge or anxious, yet both still sought comfort. Sentiment was a human defect, Mycroft had told him once, so fleetingly Sherlock moved on to the last occupant of the royal blue sofa.
“Well,” John began after calming down slightly, “you know what people say. If you don’t understand it, then it’s automatically weird. But, you know what, screw anyone who ever told you to ‘piss off’, you’re seriously intelligent. Obviously, in the future, whilst you’re out making the world a better place, all those who mocked you for being smarter than they are, will be busy becoming petrol station attendants, or till servers in Sainsbury’s.”
Anderson threw his hands up in exasperation, but Donovan wasn’t fazed, “Shut up, freak, he’s not my boyfriend.”
John stared at him, whilst Harry gave a squeal of delight and threw her arms around Sherlock’s mid-section, “Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” She cried, rushed off down the hallway, and within minutes was babbling to, who Sherlock assumed was, ‘Clara’.
“Sherlock.” John scowled at him, “Neither of us could’ve known, we forgot… we were having fun. Don’t you ever apologise for that, you were magnificent, wonderful. You made me feel so special. My anxiety isn’t anyone’s fault. It’s irrational and there’s no one to blame for it. Come on, I’m feeling much better now, you did good, Sherlock.”
Next Sherlock turned to John, “I’ve bought us a few minutes, come on, over here to the creek. Splash your face, it’ll help.”
Please Tell me this wasn’t a one-off?”
John paused for a moment, they haven’t got any lube to his knowledge, “Sherlock, I need some… do you have anything to lubricate with?”
It had been several weeks since that day, and no matter what Sherlock did John only got seriously mad at him once.
