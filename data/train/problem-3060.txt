"Shuddup Cas!!!!" Dean huffs out, face burning brightly.
"Plus, as much as I'd love to fool around with you, you need sleep. More than four hours." At the mention of sleep, Dean yawns and nuzzles his face in the crook of Castiel's neck.
"St-still sorry." Dean yawns, and practically nuzzles into Castiel's neck.
"Bullshit!" Dean replies with no hint of malice in his voice, "
When it's finished, Castiel pours the coffee into some mugs. He hands one off to Sam and carefully sips at his own.
When he pulled away, Dean practically begged him not to leave him alone. So they just lied together and ran their hands over each others bodies. Castiel remembers that he'd get angry whenever Dean would shiver and try and get closer to his touch-the idea of Dean just going through life just wanting some affection without ever receiving any in kind made him want to smite something-before realizing that didn't have to be. He could be the one who gives him affection because Dean loves him back!
Castiel's heart flutters, as always whenever Dean says those words to him.
"Of course, Dean. I love you."
Jack likes to mirror people, but that’s because he’s a toddler. Every child mimics the adults in their lives, it’s how they learn. When he was grown and first showed his FBI badge, Castiel has to admit he was humbled when it was flashed, intentional or not, upside down.
He taps his arms, "Lift up." before tugging the hymn of his shirt up. Dean giggles again when Castiel places a kiss on the bridge of his nose after the shirt is removed. He folds it neatly as Dean's arms wrap around his neck, and Castiel smiles at all the happiness Dean's exuding. He then moves his hands down to Dean's jeans and looking at him in question.
He fiddles with the coffee machine and leans back against the counter while he waits for it to filter through, listening to the grinding of beans filling the air. He looks up when he hears footsteps creep towards the room.
"Besides, I can have more to pull on when we're having sex."
Castiel smiles and presses kisses to the inside of his palms, which start clenching and unclenching repeatedly in response.
They stand in the kitchen with a comfortable silence. It was peaceful and rare that he and Sam had moments like this, before he would inevitably be off to help other hunters who needed him. It's nice, and it reminds Castiel of how much he cares for Sam and his presence. Before, he considered himself very lucky to be apart of the Winchester's orbit. To be considered family by both of them was more than he could have ever hoped for. Dean letting him in, carving out space for him even though it was at arms length, warmed him to his core.
He knew the man would look aesthetically pleasing as well. He’s heard the stories after all. But when Castiel had to sift through dirt and sculpt through clay, molding his shapely body before animation, he had to stop a moment and just take him in. He wasn’t even alive yet and he was already beautiful, and Castiel had to steady himself lest he misalign an important structure.
"I love you too, Cas."
Dean grumbles and moves his head towards Castiel to kiss him, but misses his lips and lands on his cheek, "S-said many mean words t-to you. S-sorry."
"What? The hand thing?"
Sam just stares at him, eyes glazing a bit, "Dude that's...yeah. Yeah, you're my bestfriend too."
"You're just horny! Horny former angel who has a hair pulling kink!"
Castiel watches as the brothers suddenly burst into laughter. Sam doubles over, holding his stomach, and Dean's eyes start watering and his arms and hands start flapping again as he laughs. He smiles, it's so nice to see them this way. Open to vulnerability and the weight of the world not hanging heavily on their shoulders. They're free, all of them, and they feel it in these small but growing moments.
And when Dean first stabbed him in that barn, he admired the fact that this human would take on any challenge that may face him, even though attacking a being who you have no idea what it is or what power it may possess is ridiculous in retrospect. But he'd tried his best and warded everything, and Castiel found it very amusing.
"Y-you can-my pants....always." Dean grumbles and Castiel chuckles before taking them off. After that he helps Dean put his pajama's on and gets ready for bed himself, crawling in next to him. Dean mumbles something about 'feeling safe' and Castiel smiles, kissing the crown of his head.
"You just weren't there then, Bitch."
"Yes. I get why you do it. You're happy, and I love when you express yourself when you're happy." He smiles reassuringly to him.
"That's okay Dean." Castiel pulls him to his feet and wraps his arm around the sleepy man's waist to help steady him, "Any word you say means a lot to me."
"Then it doesn't count, Jerk."
"No nightmares this time."
"It's progress. And I am."
Castiel’s been among humans a little over a decade and is still learning things about them everyday. He could never become bored with humanity and it’s quirks.
Sam walks into the room rubbing his eyes "Morning."
The next day is one of the rare times Castiel wakes up before Dean, which is good because it means he didn't have any nightmares last night, but now Castiel's torn between getting up to make them some coffee, and pulling Dean closer into his body and going back to sleep.
"Did I just walk into the Twilight Zone? What's going on in here?" Dean's voice calls out from the kitchen's entrance.
They eventually stop and take deep breaths, before Sam cleans his cup and pats them on their shoulders in goodbye.
"May I ask what this is?" he asks.
Castiel smiles at him, "I know I have, but I also know you'd rather sleep in these than have someone take them off you when your vulnerable."
Castiel smiles at him.
He's wildly ignorant to what has happened to Dean in Hell right before he got off the rack. He probably knew once, but because he's human now, his brain has probably repressed any images of that place that wasn't the soul of the most beautiful man he's ever met. Why look at Hell when he could look at Dean? Also, the way that Dean acted when Castiel tried to take him to bed the first time had given him context clues. Dean is not a shy man when it comes to his body, but he was so hesitant and tense to the point where Castiel wasn't comfortable with the idea of continuing.
"Uhhhh, very sudden but thanks? I thought it was implied."
"It was. I just confirmed it though." Castiel smirks, sipping from his mug before adding in a serious tone, "I just thought I should tell you more."
"You really like hands that do this huh?"
Luckily, this time, it was a little easier to deal with now that he wasn’t alone.
"I've forgiven you long ago."
"You are my bestfriend." he relays to the taller man. Sam freezes and looks over at him, confused.
Castiel smiles and helps walk Dean back to their room. He sits Dean down and unties his shoes and socks, taking them off and placing them at the foot of the bed.
“Sounds about right. Nothing else about the kid matches a regular four year old. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
His parents are nervous about his reaction, unsure in how Jack feels. That confusion still festers when he turns around with tears in his eyes.
The homosexual couple leads through the doorway, Cas planting a chaste kiss on Dean’s cheek when they pass under the mistletoe. Their son follows with the tray of slightly warm empty hot chocolate mugs. Sam and Eileen take up the rear, the woman pulling the taller Winchester into a kiss. Eileen leans herself against the doorway, the hand wrapped around Sam’s shirt keeps his lips just a smidge away from her own until, to Sam’s relief, she pushes up into his mouth. Their kiss lasts much too long for a nun’s opinion but not for the ones who actually have to witness it.
“But I got a gift for all of you!”
Jack sobs out, “I-I love it you guys!”
“Jack,” Dean chimes in, “why don’t you go look at the toys and find what you want for Christmas. Your dad and I can pick out the candy for your stocking. Okay?”
“Hello Dean. What’s wrong?” That fucking voice is what’s wrong, his looks too, everything basically. The deep gravelly voice had cursed Dean the second he heard it. And a chub was always supplied when the hunter had what Sam would call ‘eye sex’ with his cerulean eyes. God, were his eyes enticing. To add insult to injury, the few times Dean had gotten a look at Castiel’s ripped body he almost came in his pants. Those images were forever stuck in his memory.
After clearing the table, the gang heads over to sit around the tree, some pulling chairs to sit on and sme opting to criss-cross on the floor. Jack leans over from his spot on the ground to grab a small beautifully wrapped cube of a present and hands it to Cas.
The bag that was handed to Dean is spilled out across the map table. When he sets the bag and tissue paper aside, he sees an array of different pins and patches, a few stickers mingling about too. There’s a bi pride flag in every form mentioned. Everything Dean loves, ranging from Led Zeppelin logos to a glass of whiskey, are shown on the little trinkets. His hand reaches out to mess up Jack’s hair as a token of appreciation. A gummy smile is plastered on his kid’s (his!!) face at the reaction. Dean’s hand retreats to put the bi pride pin on the old AC/DC t-shirt he pulled on that morning.
As Castiel pulls out his cum oozes out of Dean’s hole, still gaping from the rough fuck. Now that Castiel has removed himself, Dean feels overwhelmingly empty. With the little grace Castiel still has, he removes the cum from both bodies and falls completely limp over Dean.
“Cas…”
Eileen bursts out in happiness, “I’ve played this with some other hunters before! I loved it but had no idea where to find it. This is amazing! Thank you guys.”
While the couple has most definitely had sex before, although Dean was quite shy at first, nothing gets each other’s blood pumping more than their partner being totally into it. And no way would either of them do anything without consent.
“In a second, I need to open you first.”
Jack looks dejected as those words flow from Dean’s mouth so freely. But the last sentence pulls his mood out of the gutter. The nephilim walks toward his dirty blond haired father. Their hand slides into Dean’s. The man tenses for a second before Jack smiles up at him and Cas gives him a smooch on the cheek. Castiel turns back to the cart and continues down the aisle, Sam talking his ear off about some fae magic or something. Jack’s hand is still in Dean’s as they trail after them in silence. The group continues through the store, oohing and ahhing at different light displays. When they check out they just scrap in under their monthly budget.
The adults all agree yes as they stand to grab warmer clothes. All decked out in coats and fleece-lined plaid pants, they shuffle out to the surface. Much to Jack’s pleasure, snow crunches under their feet when they step out of the bunker door. Dean leads the group, one hand in Cas’ and one in Jack’s, to a small enclosure behind tall trees. Eight bee boxes stand proudly in four rows with bees bumbling around. The older Winchester’s favorite gummy smile spreads across his boyfriend’s face at the surprise.
“He did set himself up for failure by letting them bake while we were out shopping. I haven’t heard any sounds of disappointment so the cookies are probably fine,” Sam says.
“W-will it hurt?” Dean gasps out.
Castiel is content. And very prepared. He can’t wait until he sees the look on Dean’s face when he opens his present. He just wants to spend his first real Christmas with his family.
“Get your kid to stop messing with the shelves! We already have too much attention on us in this town!” Dean exclaims.
Dean groans around the thick digits. The angel fucks his partner on the peppermint sticks for a few more minutes until pulling them out and placing them in Dean’s empty water cup. He brings his fingers out of his boyfriend’s mouth, eliciting a whine of disappointment, and covers them in a squirt of lube. They get sucked into Dean’s hole when he places them at the mouth of his ass. Already stretched from the candies, Castiel adds his pinky into the mix. When he decides the hunter is prepared enough, he rids himself of his own underwear. His thick cock leaks with precum and smells dirty with arousal. The taller man pushes back against Cas when he realises his dick is finally out of its restraints. He asks his love to flip so he can see his beautiful face. Dean does as told, showing off his own leaking penis in the process.
A few minutes after the angel and his hunter heard the door squeak open, it squeaks back closed. Castiel closes the books he was reading and carefully sets it next to the water on his nightstand after switching the lamp off. The angel bounces a bit to turn on his left side to face his boyfriend, already lying down. Dean’s eyes flick open to see crystal blue ones staring back at him.
The angel lets go of the hunter’s wrists with a glare telling him to keep them away from his cock and balls. Two fingers from that hand are then abruptly in front of Dean’s mouth with the word “suck” coming out of Castiel’s. So, Dean does. The fingers pop out of his mouth when deemed wet enough, and are then added to his hole. Cas attaches his mouth to Dean’s hole and sucks while fingering Dean open, one spit wet finger at a time.
Cas reaches over and slides open the drawer. He obtains what he is looking for. Lube dribbles into Dean’s crack and onto Castiel’s bigger-than-the-Eiffel-Tower cock. As the angel spreads the lube around in both places, he once again asks Dean if he both really wants this and is ready. Dean being Dean answers: “Fuck yea Cas. I need you, I want you.” The angel is happy to see Dean’s hole is still gaping and ready to be used. He lines up his shaft with Dean’s asshole as he stares into Dean’s green and gold eyes. The head drifts around the edge to entice a moan from each man.
Dean scrambles to regain his breath at the dirty thoughts clouding his brain. “Yeah,” he finally breathes, “Yes, absolutely yes!”
The hunter places a few quick soothing kisses across Cas’ neck then stands up, revealing his naked self. His boyfriend sniggers when Dean moves to cover himself up mumbling something about how he never seemed to feel the need to hide that before. A pillow comes flying at the angel’s face for that comment. Once Castiel finally gets out of the bed, he joins the younger man in the bathroom to brush his teeth. As the two finish up getting ready the rest of the group are buzzing around in the kitchen.
“It did. I’m proud of them,” Dean responds.
“I love you too.”
“Can I return the favor or are we done for the day?”
Although Dean had never truly ‘sexed up’ a guy, he definitely had enough gay porn to make it seem like he did. From yaoi to straight up missonary position gay sex, he had it made in the shade. All of it, sitting a few steps away from almost real life porn playing out in front of Dean’s eyes. He had all this gayness in preparation for when he finally figured out how to get Cas to bed. And oh, did it work. So, Dean knew exactly (or at least thought he knew) how to ‘sex him up’.
“Not yet Dean, let me occupy your body first.” Oh so that’s how it goes, then that’s fuckin’ fantastic.
Castiel utters a simple demand, “turn over.”
“I forgot he had made those,” Dean thinks out loud.
He breathes, “I love you, my darling,” into the shell of the hunter’s ear, causing goosebumps to pop up all along his body. Shirts are slid down shoulders and pants down legs until the two are only left in their underwear. Dean’s light green boxers match his eyes and Castiel’s bright orange briefs grip around his muscular thighs. The taller man sucks on the last of the candy cane. The angel’s tongue slow dances with the hunter’s once Dean swallows the treat. His tongue makes a wet path as it gets dragged down Dean’s chest to his left nipple. Cas softly sucks on the light pink bud. He continues on, kissing and nipping along the dirty blond happy trail. Thick fingers wrap around the waistband to pull them down and off of the man. Once they're on the floor with the other clothes, warm lips cover the tip of Dean’s dick. Castiel hums while suckling on his head, sending waves of pleasure through the hunter’s body. He pulls off, his tongue dipping out for little kitten licks every so often. His breath blows over the tip one last time before Cas sits up completely.
By the time the group is done with making the frosting, the kitchen counters (and a bit of the floor) is covered in a layer of powdered sugar. Saving the others from a tough clean-up, Jack waves it away only leaving the cooled cookies and fresh icing.
“Did you get anything for Charlie and her girlfriend? Or Jody, Donna, and the girls?”
The pair approach the extra room and Dean reaches to open the door, “I think you’ll like yours more though.”
Out of nowhere, Dean keens back and lifts his hips from the bed, his prostate had been hit. Castiel’s deft and long fingers had reached in far and rubbed the exact right place.
Unfortunately for the others at the table, his boyfriend asked right when Dean was taking his final sip of hot chocolate. Dean hurriedly gulps it down and looks over to Castiel, only to respond with, “you’re right honey.” Eileen and Sam suppress their laughter at the angel’s and Dean’s encounter. In the moment that their chuckles finally die down, Jack comes out of the kitchen to announce it’s time to ice the cookies.
“I’m ready Cas. I wanna be yours. I wanna be one.” And with that, Cas slowly sinks all the way in. A shudder runs through Dean’s body when his angel bottoms out. Prostate and dick rub together as their bodies quickly heat up.
“That you are Jack, that you are.”
“Yeah, sorry,” Dean ducks his head.
Dean Winchester is in love. He’s in love with the holiday season. It has been too long since he let himself enjoy Christmas but he’s finally ready. He’s ready for the hot chocolate. He’s ready for the holiday season. He’s ready to share this with Cas. He can’t fucking wait until tomorrow.
“Well that’s just a matter of going to the store. I’ll be back.” And with that, the sexy angel was out the door and on his way to the store.
“He is quite fond of nougat, isn’t he honey?” Castiel asks Dean while hooking his arm in his.
Jack looks out the window to the snowy street, then says, “...no.”
“Actually, I’ll be doing more of the opening.”
Ignoring Dean’s sassy response, Cas grabs Dean’s hips and flips them over so Castiel is once more above Dean. “Are you sure you are ready for this?”
Castiel grimaces when he says, “That candy looks really tough on your teeth.”
No way are we finishing now! But Dean wants to toy with his lover. “Depends, whatcha gonna do angel?” Dean knows he’s testing Cas’ patiences by calling him angel but the blush that appears on his cheeks is too damn cute to pass up.
His body moved before he could think. Cas’ closed and locked the door and made his way towards Dean. Because Dean was on his back, reaching directly across his chest to f*ck his hand with the other hand fumbling a nipple, all Cas had to do was wrap his hand around Dean’s. The hunter’s eyes snapped open. His eyes focused on the ‘attacker’. The angel he longed after was in his bedroom, while he was naked. While he was naked! Oh no. Cas saw him naked. Is seeing him naked! And he is holding his hand. The hand wrapped around his dick!
“Yeah, sure Dean, you’re not Jack’s dad,” Castiel asks sarcastically.
“There’s a little more to that gift Cas, but we have to go outside, beautiful,” Dean says.
But then Dean proves him wrong. He could be happier, or at least hornier, but right now, what’s the difference? The hunter’s mouth sucked Cas down all the way to the base of his cock. Dean felt the weight on his tongue and wondered why he waited so long to get Cas in bed. Castiel can feel the tip of his dick touching right below the back of Dean’s throat causing him to breathe through his nose.
Everyone hesitantly asks if they could stay until New Year’s Day, Castiel happily accepting them all. Claire and Kaia slink back to their room early, Stevie and Charlie following not long after. Sam could have let his brother and Castiel stay in the library with the rest of them for however long they wanted. However, their kisses in the armchair are getting distractingly loud and annoying. This causes Sam to throw a pillow at them as a warning. Instead of taking the warning, the pair unabashedly scurries back to their bedroom with a quick stop in the kitchen.
The group finishes putting away the groceries. Dean (Castiel trailing after him) sneaks the gifts under the scarily large tree in the map room after he and Castiel finish wrapping them. Eileen, Sam, and Jack come out of the kitchen with a tray of hot chocolate. Everyone sits down at the map table to share laughs and smiles over the steaming mugs of hot cocoa.
“Dean... Dean… I think I’m going to… I’m about to…” Cas whimpers out from his lips. And Cas just lets go. His hard cock softens slightly as he empties down Dean’s throat. The mossy green eyes with dashes of gold look up into indescribable deep blue ones and Dean sucks. And sucks and sucks. Thick, hot, wet semen flows down Dean’s throat. Taking every bit of his angel in, making sure not to waste a single drop. It’s like his cum is what is keeping Dean alive. And at this point, maybe it is.
“So… that just happened,” Sam states.
Dean never was good with emotions. Still, Dean has always refused to talk the ‘feelings’ talk, settling for one night stands instead. He always left almost right after what Cas would call ‘intercourse’. Dean didn’t ever dare spend the night, don’t want to give the girl the wrong impression. But right now, Dean could give a rat’s ass about those fine ladies ‘cause he has a real life (very needy) angel in his bed right now.  Dean’s cock is bulldozing through his lovey-dovey emotions to satisfy the horny one’s needs.
“I thought… I thought you were going to pull off Dean. But that… oh that, it felt so good” he shudders as he recalls.
“Dean! Well actually, he isn’t wrong. We were blind for quite a while,” the angel says.
Many of the trees were too close to dying or too many pine needles had fallen off. Dean would not settle for those, not on their first Christmas as a true family. When they had finally found a batch good enough for Dean, it was far too short for the map room. The next step was for Sam to research and find a tree lot that sold trees tall enough. News Flash: one like that didn’t exist. At least not in Kansas. They would cut a tree down in the forest but Jack wasn’t about to destroy the wild animal’s land. Finally, the end of that day came and the group still hadn’t found a good enough tree. Castiel said screw it (literally, Dean couldn’t believe it), waved his hand, and there a tall enough, alive enough, and having needles enough, tree stood. That tree was begging to be decorated. Once the team had delicately placed the ornaments (Cas had magick those up too) on the tree, they sat down to think about what to make for the meals on Christmas day.
“Hun…”, Sam frowned again, reaching for his phone “maybe his kids have it”.
“What happened?” He asked, still a little dizzy. He tried to sit down but felt his head spin a little.
“Who was she?” There was no judgment in his voice, only the concern of a man who wanted to know who he was dealing with. All those were knowing sides of Castiel.  Dean had told him Castiel was a soldier, but he hadn’t seen it, not really, until now.
to sit, so when he did it was because he wanted to. He patted Cas’s thigh gently.  “Quit smothering the poor kid, won’t you?”.
They fell into a comfortable silence after that. Benny dozed off for a few minutes, and Dean closes his eyes as well, although Cas could tell he was not sleeping. He forced himself to hold this memory tight. It would be one of the last good ones he would ever have. He could already tell it was going to be precious. At some point, Dean opened his eyes slightly, just enough to exchange a glance with the angel. He smiled, and Cas didn’t ask what that smile meant. He simply smiled back. Dean would be ok. He would have Sam, and Benny, and himself, for that matter. He was a strong man, and he would eventually get over the loss of Cas.
was therapizing him. He couldn’t help but chuckle at that. Castiel cocked his head, looking confused.
“Awesome”, he sighed. “Just awesome”.
the problem.
“It’s going to be fine, Dean”, Sam reassured him. “They investigate you while you investigate them”.
“A friend of mine was killed in front of me, a few years back”, Ben answered. He spoke with ease, although Dean could catch the pain in his eyes. It was a hard memory, but one he had grown used to. One he had talked about before. “We were at a camping trip and me and Jeremy, my friend, walked away from the group for a bit to get firewood and we were attacked”.
The vampire was the first one to let go of his blade and sit down, getting as far as closing his eyes for a bit. Dean followed, although he did not let go of the blade he was caring nor closed his eyes, simply sat and relaxed his muscles for a second. Cas didn’t sit down at all. He was in full “guardian-angel” mode – back straight, sober expression and eyes clear and focused – and didn't seem willing to do anything other than keep watch over them. Dean was aware angel didn’t need sleep (neither of them did in purgatory, actually), but seeing Cas all tensed up like that was making him uneasy for some reason.
pull the angel to the ground, but Cas sat, maybe as a sign of truce. He was still unquiet and tense, overall uncomfortable, but this was Cas. When
It was already very late, but he would have to wake Dean up, eventually. They couldn’t spend the night in the “Dean Cave”, at least not with guests that might come in at any moment, but he didn’t want to move just yet. As an angel, his notion of time had always been vague. He was eternal, so there was never “before” or “after”.  Just slight variations of “now” and “always”. After becoming human, his whole worldview changed. Suddenly there was “before”, “now” and “after”, and those three were very clearly separated from one another. When he regained his grace, this way of seeing time, linearly, stuck with him. Day follows night and hours are broken into minutes. Those are human time markers, but he had learned to see the world that way now, and it was very hard to unlearn. Also, he didn’t really want to. Looking down at Dean, who looked more relaxed than he had in weeks, Cas felt whole. And he was glad for the “now”. And he was glad he could elongate the “now” for a little while longer if he wanted to. Angles could bend time, but not like humans could. The ways humans could make a moment last forever were unique. And he was happy he had learned how to do it. Dean had taught him without even knowing.
He stared at Ben for a moment. It had been a dumb question, but the kid took his time thinking about it.
Dean scoffed. “Yeah. Tell me about it”.
He felt when Cas came closer to peer at the documents from over his shoulder. He let him, as he always did, although he was aware of how little space there was between them. Dean rolled his eyes, mostly to himself, but didn’t do anything to push Cas away. The doctor gave them a knowing look, but that wasn’t anything new.
Claire was very silent after that. She studied Jack as if trying to make sure it was actually him talking. He sounded very grown-up, not like him at all.
“It wasn’t anything weird!”, Sam told him, defensively. “Mostly hunting and family stuff”.
Cas gave him a look of utter annoyance, which Dean thought was very human of him, and turned back to stare at where they had come through like a guard dog. Dean figured that was the best he would get from Cas in terms of decompression, so he mirrored Benny and allowed himself to lie down, but kept his knife at hand. Since sleep wasn’t a physiological necessity in Purgatory, he had a hard time doing so. He could close his eyes and almost doze off for a few minutes but would eventually open them again and find himself staring at Cas’s back. The angel didn’t move a muscle.
“You can’t do that!” he snapped. “He is clearly involved in… whatever this is too!”.
“You don’t get it”, Ben mumbled, still sounding lewdly pleased with his meal. “These are perfect. They taste
“Well, someone better”, Dean retorted, interrupting his whistling, and pointing the spatula at her. Yes, he was indeed in a good mood. Getting properly laid and waking up next to your angel boyfriend will do that to you sometimes. “Since you two have apparently rebelled against social interaction since yesterday”.
“It was mostly Campbell-related”, Sam retorted, trying to keep a civil tone. “Claire said you showed them the lighter. They wanted to know more about that, you know. The whole ancient hunter dynasty thing. If there were any other older families like the in America, things like that” Sam raised his hands, helplessly. “It didn’t
"Knowing the Empty, it probably won't feel like much", Dean whispered, finishing Jack's thoughts. The boy's face told him he was right. Dean took a deep breath. He would have to make this work with little time then.  "Ok then", he said, stepping into the rift.
After the kiss, the venom’s effect seemed to wear off pretty quickly. Cas imagined that the shock – or whatever Dean’s reaction was – had purged most of what was still left out of his system. Not all of it. He and Benny still had to deal with a pretty shaken up Dean Winchester for a few hours after that. He was shaky and uneasy, and Cas was pretty sure Dean had a couple of hallucinations before he was completely clean. He hoped it hadn’t been John but had a strong feeling that it might have been. John Winchester, coming back to pass judgment on his son once again. Castiel could relate to the fear of a father’s judgment. He also wanted to tell Dean he had done nothing wrong to be judged for.
As soon as he saw the files in Dean’s hand, Sam jumped from his chair and walked towards them with one hand already outstretched, but Dean stopped him with a firm hand against his brother’s chest.
“It’s not like that”, he said, sounding suddenly very small, and Dean felt his heart break a little. He was always taken aback by the way Cas could look like a lethal warrior on one second and a lost puppy on the next. His posture softened a bit and he raised one hand to Cas’s face, fondling it.
“He came into the entrance room a few seconds after you left”, Cas explained. His voice was steady, but Dean knew by the way he was holding on to his hand that the angel was also on edge.
“I don’t deserve that” Cas finally said, after a long silence. “Not after everything I did”.
“What the hell?”, he muttered.
He paused for a second and looked at the brothers. Neither could say a thing. Sam looked at Dean but was unable to figure out what his brother was thinking. At first glance, Dean seemed shocked, but Sam knew that wasn't it. His expression was similar to the one he would have when they faced what seemed like an impossible situation and Dean's mind would start browsing through three hundred different scenarios, looking for a way out. He was thinking really hard about something.
“You fault”, he said.
Benny let out a sarcastic laugh. “You boys really did have an interesting life, didn’t you?”
“Ok. Two days. Let’s see what we can find out”.
"It?" Dean asked. The mood in the room had changed. There was some sort of tension now, like something big was about to happen and everyone was just waiting for the boom. Jack's smile widened.
“Well, I drink”, he finally said. “
The problem was, between the running and the fighting there didn't seem to be any time for an actual conversation. And even if there was, Cas couldn’t picture a scenario where he and Dean would have some time alone, without Benny. And as much as he had grown to like the vampire – which he had – Benny should not be a part of that particular conversation. They had formed a triangular relationship, it was true, but there was a story unfolding between Dean and Cas there had begun before Purgatory, and it required some sort of closure between the two of them as well.
Thinking about the car seemed to take Dean to a happy place of sorts, and his physiognomy relaxed a bit.
Benny simply raised an eyebrow, faking surprise.
At this point, however, he wasn’t even sure Cas would listen if he told him something like that. The angel’s head seemed to be miles away ever since they had found him by the river, and the truth is: after Dean convinced Cas to join him and Benny, they had barely spoken. Of course, it was difficult to have a real conversation when you’re too busy trying to survive every second of every day, so it wasn't exactly their fault. Still, there was too much left unsaid, as usual, and he didn't like that.
“Like the salt or the devil’s trap”, Dean concluded, letting his eyes fall to the ground. “I used to tell him to salt his windows and I painted devil’s traps around the house. Shit!”
Benny was beginning to wonder if it was best to restrain Dean. The whole thing looked dangerously close to a panic attack. Benny was way stronger, he could hold the hunter down until he cooled off, but something kept him at a safe distance. It might have been the blade in Dean’s hand, which Benny had seen decapitate a thousand vampires as if they were vegetables being sliced. Or maybe it was the cathartic effect this outburst might have on Dean.
It was the first time they ever faced a group like this: a miscellany of creatures fighting together as a pack. That was not the way purgatory worked, which made Benny wonder what the hell was going on, though he didn’t have a lot of time to dwell on that question. They were vicious and out for their blood. Dean was the first one to engage in combat, decapitating one of the nearest vampires before Benny had even reached for his weapon. It had been almost uncomfortable to watch how easily his friend slew others like him. How easy it would be for Dean to do just the same thing to him if he ever decided that Benny wasn’t trustworthy anymore. He pushed away that though as best he could.
“Maybe…” Cas looked lost in thought. “Maybe at first. We were both mistaken about who the enemy actually was, but you could say it started like that. Then the enemy changed and we chose to change with it, rebel together. Or he rebelled and I followed. That would be more accurate.” Benny could almost see a smile forming on Castiel’s lips, but it never showed up. It remained the idea of a smile that never surfaced. “Then I became the enemy”.
Dean had gone silent. When he finally spoke, his voice carried a heavy tone. He was angry, but Ben didn’t think he was the source or the target of that anger. If anything, Dean seemed angry with himself.
“She’s right”, Dean cut in. Every trace of the smile had vanished, and his voice sounded cold and commanding again. He regarded Ben for a short, intense second before turning to Sam. “He can have one of the guestrooms downstairs, right?”
“It will do, for now”. He patted Cas on the back of his neck. “I’ll tell you what we are going to do today. Claire said she was going to take Kaia to the train station, right? They’ll be gone for at least three hours since one: the station is like forty minutes away and two: they will probably take some time for themselves before parting. While they’re out, you are going to help Sam with the vamp nest case he’s been going crazy over. I’ll take Ben”.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up in a terrified expression. He raised his hand to Cas’s shoulder and held it tightly, so tightly it would probably hurt if he was human. It did hurt, just not because of the pressure of Dean’s fingers against his skin.
Dean finished the sentence. Cas didn’t say anything, which was answer enough. “Awesome”, he growled, thinking about the dark, the voices, and the visions. “That’s
“Oh, very pleasant memories. Thank you for reminding me”.
Ben refocused his attention on the articles. The more he read, the more it all fell into place. It
“Thanks, Jack”, she said. “I needed that”.
“Then it’s your lucky day. You’re up!”
“I’m not telling you to throw him out”, Sam cut him, holding Dean’s gaze to make sure he was listening. “But Ben staying here only ends one way, Dean. So you better use this driving lesson to either convince him to quit hunting or figure out what you’re going to do next. Because he is an eighteen-year-old hunter, and you won’t be able to hold him here for much longer”.
“Will
“Asa worked on a case like this, a year and a half ago. He wouldn’t let me help him on the field, but he talked to me about it.” God, how hadn’t he realized it before? It was so obvious! “Five attacks, a week apart from one another. Families with home-schooled kids had their blood completely drained.”
At that moment, Dean had the weird feeling that maybe, just maybe, everything would turn out ok.
“It might be a good idea”, Sam said, cautiously. “It would be very helpful for Jack to learn how to drive”.
“I don’t
“You know that’s kind of creepy, don’t you?”
Cas frowned, unconvinced. “You’re certain that’s a good idea? You seem to drop things around him”
Cass adapted faster than he had the last time. Dean was afraid a part of Cass would resent him for taking away his grace before asking. He should have asked, but he was too afraid Cass would have said no. That he would rather die as an angel than live the rest of his life as a human. He had taken that option away from Castiel and he wasn't entitled to do something like that. But Cass didn't seem angry with being human. He sometimes seemed a bit displeased with the more basic human aspects. For example, he hated feeling hot, and they had brought him back in the middle of the summer, so he was hot all the time. He hated to sweat and appeared to hate sunburns even more. It was funny to watch, but Dean missed the trenchcoat and the tie deeply. He had had more fantasies about gripping that tie than he would ever admit to anyone.
Cas’s face immediately lightened up, and he allowed himself a defeated smile. “How spoiled.”
“Shouldn’t the venom wear off when you put them down?” Benny looked at the disposed body of the wraith nearby. The rotted face contorted into an expression of pain, eyes burned from the inside out. That thing was definitely dead.
“I mean how didn’t you walk away too? Everybody does! Sam did, my father did, Bobby did, Lisa and Ben did…”
“So what? We wait?”
“Like you haven’t done that a million times”, Claire pointed out, which, yeah. She had a point. But Ben wasn’t Dean.
“He is the best hunter I’ve ever met”, she said, uncertainly. “And I know he cares. About people. He cares
“Next time I see him, I’m, going to kill him”, she said and meant it. Who on earth tells a kid something like that?
Castiel ran his fingers slowly through Dean’s hair. The hunter was snoring quietly, his head lying on his lap, softly curled against the angel’s shirt. His arms were still crossed, which Castiel always found amusing: Dean’s ability to fall asleep with his arms still crossed. It never lasted though. Dean would always wake up with his arms and legs spread over the bed, half the covers kicked away during his sleep. Or, when Castiel was with him, he would roll over and hug him in his sleep or use him as a pillow. Castiel didn’t mind. Dean’s weight against his body was comforting, just like the feeling of the hunter’s chest moving over his. Definitive prove that he was still breathing.
Her expression closed off immediately, her mouth turning into a thin line and eyebrows drawing close. Her fingers tightened on the wheel, knuckles growing white. She didn’t seem angry at him, but apprehensive about whatever she was going to find out. Well, that made two of them.
Benny whistled, admittedly surprised. He never would have pictured Dean as the overprotective-big-brother type. But then again, he had done nothing but look out for Benny and Cas since they started traveling together, so it was not so hard to picture. After he connected the dots, Dean suddenly made a lot more sense to him.
Ben shot him a terrified look. “And!?!?”
Yeah, Purgatory was bloody. And Messy. Thirty-one flavors of bottom-dwelling nasties. Hell, most days had felt like 360-degree combat.
But on my version, Jack and Kaia never managed to open any portals. So Kaia was taken in by Jody and the girls while Jack went back to the bunker with the boys. No one has any new information on Mary.
“Well, those things are pretty fire-proof”, Dean told her, with a shrug. “It was one of the few things that survived the house fire that killed my mom. She had one, so he found it and kept it as a memento or something. Which was... an interesting choice, to say the least”
that”.
Benny had to divert his gaze because before the werewolf could finish talking, his eyes busted into light and he let out a scream of agony. The two creatures that held Benny down let go of him instantly and stepped back while Castiel pulled the wolf by the head, throwing him far away from the fallen vampire. “Who’s next?” He asked, in a deeper, colder voice than Benny had ever heard him use.
“Define snooping around”, Dean asked him. His voice was dangerously low now, which Sam knew could be way worse than yelling. Under the table, he felt Cas squeezing his knee gently.
Cas didn’t promptly answer. He crooked his head slightly and frowned. “I might have, actually”.
he acting uncomfortable? When Dean had the angel sitting at his side, he let off a small sigh and petted Cas’s on the leg. “See? That wasn’t so hard”.
he thought to himself.
dead friends.”
he reminded himself. Years and years of his father’s intense military logic took over him. Assess your situation, get to safety, make a plan. Everything else can wait. C
“The point” Castiel interrupted him, apparently not very amused by Dean’s attempt at lightening the mood “is that your organism is functioning, moving, and the venom is slowly dissolving as a result. You will be totally clear of it eventually.”
life. And he threw it away in exchange for what? Cheap meals, dirty motels, and the constant risk of dying? It didn’t make any God damn sense!
When Castiel had first told him the effects the venom could have over Dean, while they waited for him to wake up from the “angel coma”, Benny thought he was prepared to handle the situation. He wasn’t.
“There was a family murdered in Kansas too, wasn’t it?”, Dean asked. Sam nodded and, after a bit of searching, handed him the article related to the Kansas case.
“Nobody gets left behind”. He trailed off before Cas could say anything that might make Dean lose his focus. Cas was a warrior of heaven, not a lost kitten. They were being hunted and if he let his guard down for a second because he wanted to cuddle Cas like a child, they wouldn’t make out of that place alive.
“Really wasn’t”, he mumbled, still trying to piece together what had happened. He felt confident enough to sit straight, raising his head from Claire’s lap and laying back against the leather seat. “This morning too, but a lot lighter. I never had them before, though. Well, not in a very long time, at least”.
“Never,
“Well, besides everything?” There was a fit of slight anger rising in his voice. Cas didn’t interrupt him. He wanted to see where this would go. “Besides not fighting for my life every single second of every single day? Besides food? Beer? Sex? Besides…” he swallowed, deeply. All the anger that was rising in his voice suddenly toning down into something more like sadness. “Besides Sam? Damn it, Cas. What
"Dean?" He called, but his brother didn't even look at him.
“Then what caused it today?”, Jack asked. Ben didn’t have an answer to that. It had started when Dean was teaching him how to drive, but it was very weak, barely a nuisance. And every time Dean corrected or encouraged him, it got a little stronger. Every time Dean put one of his hands on the wheel to help him understand what the right movements were, it got stronger. Until it was pounding so hard, he could barely see. They stopped the car and he fell out, legs weak under the weight of his body. Jack caught him before his head hit the ground. All he could hear was a high-pitched sound, loud enough to make his mind go blank. And then he woke up in the back of the Impala.
“Yeah, definitely not Kevin”, he agreed. Something in him went a little softer after that. Castiel was sure Dean didn’t believe a word of what he had just said. But that was Dean. Self-hatred was part of the package.
“Do you want to tell me about her?” Castiel eventually asked, breaking the silence. It was an honest question, no hidden agendas, no judgment or worry.
“Yeah, but I trust him!”, she snapped back, just as angry. Ben lowered his guard a bit after that. He knew Claire didn’t throw the word ‘trust’ around like it was nothing.
"Well, you shouldn't have traded your fucking life for anything, to begin with, ok? You did it because you love Jack. And then you surrendered yourself to the Empty for the very same reason. Because you love me". He paused for a second after he said that and Cass imagined if it was the first time Dean had said anything about it out loud. "We do stupid things for the people we love. And then we spend the following years trying to fix the mess we've made. But you know what? The mess is always worth it. And if we have to spend the next ten years figuring out a way to put the Empty back to sleep? So be it. You are going to be by my side while we do it".
Dean finally reached the library and let himself collapse on one of the armchairs. He really wished he hadn’t dropped that glass, since he could certainly use a drink right about now. Burying his face in his hands, Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He had to come up with a plausible explanation for why he had freaked out after seeing a kid he supposedly never met before. Maybe he could say Ben had reminded him of somebody he knew? It wasn’t exactly a lie. Dean was contemplating the idea when he felt the weight of a strong hand fall on his shoulder. He didn’t have to look up to know exactly who it was.
Cas gripped one of Dean’s arms, pressing his fingers tightly against the hunter’s jacket. Even though he was still supporting Ben’s weight, Dean leaned into it, tension alleviating a bit due to Castiel’s proximity. Ben could see every fiber of Dean’s body yearned for the angel’s touch, for the comfort and safety it provided. He was enormously glad Dean was able to
“I mean, have you ever felt something that you knew was wrong to feel? Like you get angry at someone who you know doesn’t deserve it, or you’re mad because someone scolded you, but you know you kind of had it coming? Or when you’re happy because someone you hate got hurt? Like you know you shouldn’t be feeling the way you do, but you can’t help it?”
One of the things Castiel first realized he hated in Purgatory was the absence of the night. He knew there were many things to hate around there, such as the dirt, the never-stopping violence, the constant running around… but the truth was: those things didn’t bother him all that much. No. What really troubled him was the apparent nonexistence of time. Or at least of time measurements.
Claire rolled her eyes at him, but he couldn’t help but notice the way her lips curled into a proud smile when she completed the extremely closed U-turn with a single hand movement. It was her first successful attempt in almost an hour, and Dean was pretty sure the axles of the Impala would need some work after that morning, but for once he genuinely didn’t care.
“Aren’t you a bit young for an FBI agent?”, the coroner asked, studding Jack with a skeptical look. Dean swallowed the ‘I told you’ he was about to throw at Cas and instead forced his lips to curl into the most innocent smile he could possibly manage.
“You can’t keep him locked in here forever”, Sam pointed out.
“Oh, does he?” Claire asked, coldly, more to herself than to anyone else. There was an edge to her voice that didn’t please Dean one bit. His eyes met hers on the review mirror. She was looking right at him, and he knew she had just pieced something together. He just didn’t know what.
“And your mom didn’t know where it came from?”
Castiel didn’t move for a moment, as if making sure things had calmed down. Then he turned back and kneeled beside Benny, taking his wounded arm in his hands with surprising tenderness. There was a lot more blood in his clothes and on the ground than Benny had first realized, but the pain went away as soon as Castiel’s hands started glowing above the injury. In it was good as new in less than five seconds. The vampire stretched his fingers and twisted his forearm, making sure everything was in order.
“Every single one of those people
It took a few minutes for Dean to get to the library, with his shirt still covered in grease. He was cleaning his hands with a cloth and, to Sam's distress, did not look as if he was in a hurry.
“Ok. Great”, Dean grumbled. “Nothing’s ever simple. Should we wake up Sam? He likes this sort of witchy stuff”.
“Does she know?” He asked, even though he already knew the answer. “About any of this?” Ben raised his eyes at Dean, taken aback by either the question or the sudden harshness on Dean’s voice.
“Shit”, Kaia murmured. Her eyes were frozen on the scar on Ben’s arm and the poor girl looked about to throw up. “That’s why I’m majoring in sociology”.
“You probably don’t remember me”, the hunter said, with a serious tone. “But you and your mom were in a car accident, I don’t know. Six, seven years back? I’m the guy who hit you”.
evolved, as a matter of fact, and it was good to have that evolution acknowledged.

Well, there was no point in sulking about that now. He swallowed the memories and flashed a smile at Ben. He looked for signs of that headache he had just seen, but Ben didn't seem to be feeling any discomfort. Well, any
“You…”, The boy looked from Castiel to Dean, then back from Dean to Castiel, trying to make sense of what they had told him. “You kept track of me?”
Jack came by the bunker on a Saturday morning. Sam and Eileen were just back from a morning run and Dean was working on the car, something he'd been doing a lot over the last few months, even though the car had barely left the garage. He appeared in the middle of the library and stood there, absolutely silent, waiting for everyone to notice him. The first one who did was Sam, who was coming from the kitchen with a bottle of water for Eileen, which he immediately dropped. When the bottle hit the ground, Jack turned to him, smiled, and raised his hand.
Neither Benny nor Cas said anything, but afterward, but they walked even closer to him than before. Which was good. Eventually, Benny started whistling ‘
“So what?”, she sounded uncertain now. “Not like Sam would tell us anything either”. Ben wasn’t so sure about that. Out of the three men, Sam was the one he was the least apprehensive about.
“Hey, Ben?” Claire asked again, snapping her fingers in front of his eyes.  Ben blinks a couple more times, finally being able to focus properly on her.
Second, the U-turn Dean is teaching Claire in this chapter is specifically the one he does on episode 11x04 "Baby". Yeah. THAT U-turn. You know the one.
Cas repeated to himself.
“We don’t enjoy being teamed up with you bloodsuckers either”  the werewolf muttered, sounding almost offended “but at least we’re all dead, unlike your little human friend over there”. He grinned, turning his head to where Dean and Cas had been. “Well, maybe he’ll be joining us shor…”
All things considered, Dean was feeling pretty pleased with himself.  Of course, until Claire put the car in park and turned to face him. The smile had vanished, replaced by a very decided frown that for some reason reminded him a bit of Cas when he was pissed.
“Died last year”, Ben confirmed. “He knew you guys, although I guess everyone knows you. His name was Asa Fox.”
Sam didn't need to convince Dean into doing anything. Dean was prepared to go to the empty as soon as Jack said the word. What he was not prepared to do was to simply talk to Castiel. "Say a proper goodbye"? No fucking way. He was coming back with the angel, or he was not coming back at all. But he did use one of the two days Jack gave them to prepare himself. Busting someone from the Empty, he imagined, was not a very simple task. And he couldn't ask Sam or Jack for help. He figured they would help if he asked, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. It was like that part of the battle was his, his and Castiel's.
like my mom used to make them”.
“For now”, Cas remind them. It wasn’t a good idea to let them get careless when they were so close to their goal.
“Fine”, he said, with a very long, very exhausted sigh. “We can go. Is either that or vampire brainstorming day, so I guess this is a win”. The smile that ignited in Jack’s face was enough to make the inevitable stress on his future seem worth it. Hardening his expression, a bit, he turned to the other two: “We leave in ten, got it? If you’re not on the garage by then, I’m leaving you behind”.
“Someone’s in a good mood this morning”, Claire pointed out, raising an eyebrow at Dean from over her coffee mug.
“Store run”, Sam answered, in a lighthearted tone. “We needed baking powder”.
This conversation was far from over, and he knew it. Worse: he knew that, if Ben did trust them before (and that was a big
“You haven’t told your friends about me, Benjamin?” She frowned, as an unhappy child would “how cruel of you”.
would be the first thing she’d notice”, Castiel agreed, patiently. Dean was provoking, him, he was aware of it, but still, it seemed like as good a reason as any to move back to the bedroom. Lowering his hand from Dean’s hair to his chin, Cas turned his head slightly so that the hunter was facing him properly. Dean’s eyes glimmered at him, and the angel found himself hopelessly bending down to place a kiss on his lips. Because he could. Because Dean let him do that.
“I’m not judging, kid. We get by on what we have. But a Mitsubishi Mirage? Not really a hunter’s car”. The remark was good-humored, not meant to offend, but Ben knew he would have blushed like a child if he hadn’t been so deeply entranced by his reading. Dean noticed that and approached him, throwing a suspicious gaze to the papers scattered through the table. “What are you working on?”.
But what Dean had with Benny looked similar to what he had with Sam. It felt easy and natural and effortless. And they had come to that in less than a year. That shouldn’t bother him, but for some reason it did. It didn’t help that his role in a fight was usually around the action, wiping out enemies before they could get to Dean and Benny. When they clashed with a larger group, he fought around them, not with them. It was the smartest thing to do, and also the only way to keep the two of them alive.
Luckily for him, Ben was apparently as oblivious as Jack.
“Cas, come on dude. Sit down for a second, will you?” Cas lowered his eyes to him for a second but ignored the request completely. Dean took a deep, patient breath. “You will hear them if they come any closer and then we can carry on with our daily massacre, but I will go crazy if I don’t sit down and rest for like five minutes, you hear me?”
“Cas thought he might remember me, somehow”, Dean spit, bitterly. “Or I don’t know. Have a ghost feeling of me.”
“Broken record, Cas”, Benny cut him off and quickened his pace, leaving Dean and Castiel behind. The vampire sounded as displeased about the whole thing as Dean felt. They had better be close, the hunter thought to himself, otherwise, they might kill each other out of annoyance.
Ben let out a long sigh. Asa had been what Claire referred to as “first-generation” too. Ben counted himself first-and-a-half. He hadn’t been raised as a hunter, like Sam and Dean, but he did have a mentor with textbooks, journals, and experience that trained and taught him before sending him to the field, so he wasn’t like Jody (or Claire, for that matter) either, who was dragged into this later in life and was learning while doing it. On the other hand, the Campbells, from what he could tell, was closer to a hunter dynasty.
The first time they caught a break, none of them could actually believe it. They had been fighting non-stop since they had found Cas, and couldn't let their guard down even after almost an hour without hearing or encountering anything. As they made their progress through the woods in peace, Benny started to slow their pace, until they eventually stopped at a clearing. The three of them were still on edge, arms at hand and looking over their shoulders constantly, but Dean was also so tired he didn't even question Benny's decision to stop.
The angel seemed exhausted. His trench coat was ripped in places it hadn’t been before and his eyes seemed heavy. Still, he managed a half-crocked smiled and said: “Hello Dean”. Or at least that's what he was planning on saying, for Dean didn’t even let him finish. He threw his arms around the angel and pushed him close, hugging him desperately and burring his face on Cas’s neck. After a second like this, he wrapped his hands on each side of Castiel’s head, forcing the angel to look him in the eyes. Benny couldn’t tell who looked less like himself: if it was Dean with his frenetic eyes and desperate breathing or Cas, who clearly had no idea what was going on and looked helplessly from Benny to Dean in search of answers. And if he was confused then, what Dean did next shut his system down completely.
To Dean’s utmost surprise, Ben turned out to be easier to deal with than Sam. Once he got back with Jack and Cas, he found his brother and Ben sitting exactly as he left them, but with a bigger pile of books and papers between them. Ben looked in desperate need of rescue and Sam looked as if he would fall asleep while sitting at any minute. Apparently, Asa’s journals (yes, journals,
Dean blinked at him as if he had grown a second head. “What?
“Wow, hold on a minute”, Dean snapped his head up, facing Cas. “Sam saw him?”
Claire exchanged an inquiring look with Kaia before nodding. “We could eat. Ben?”
He was about to open his mouth to thank Sam for the stitches when a deep voice coming from the other side of the room snapped his attention away from his arm:
"If you can hear me, I need your help. I know you said you wouldn't intervene on earth's business, and I know that, if you could bring Cass back, you would have". He took a deep breath. Dean had probably had this same conversation with Jack more than once, but it was still worth the shot "But if you could let them talk... I don't know, maybe a dream, or a spell, anything. Dean just needs to talk to Cass. Could you let them do that? Just talk"
She didn’t seem very happy about that but nodded.
"I'm attempting to make pancakes" Cass answered, with a very serious voice. Dean caught a glimpse of the pile of failed pancakes accumulating on the trash and tried not to laugh. "It is harder than it looks".
“Here”, Ben showed him the article he was reading. “I’ve seen this before”.
“Hey” Benny locked eyes with him for a serious moment. “Those motherfuckers are coming in bigger groups. Dean and I can’t handle a pack on our own. If he’s going to rest, which is something we both know he needs to do, it’s safer for him to have
“Why?” Dean stared at her over the folder.
She sighed. She could tell him to leave. She knew he would. Jack was a respectful kid. But she also wasn’t exactly sure she wanted him to go. After thinking about it for a moment, she rose from the bed and unlocked the door. He was standing in the hallway, awkward in a way only he and Cas could be. He gave her a shy smile.
Things went a lot more smoothly after that, and Jack eventually got the hang of it. After Dean thought he had made enough progress for his first morning, he told Jack and Claire to switch seats and asked her what she wanted to learn. This whole thing might have been a scam on her part, but Dean decided that wouldn’t stop him from enjoying the morning and maybe teaching her something after all. As it turned out, the things she wanted to learn (like this particular U-turn), weren’t exactly safe, so he eventually told Ben and Jack to wait outside.
“Sorry”, he told her, grabbing the lighter. In one quick movement, he lit it and threw it into the bowl. “Campbell family lighters. Limited edition. Even I don’t have one”
you here, with me. And I need you whole. I need your head in the game. So no self-pity parties until we’re safe and sound in a crappy motel anywhere far from here. Got it?
“No. I think you will lead a very exciting life until the day of your death, Dean”, Cas told him, flat. Dean snorted.
“Can I see it?” He asked Claire, clearing his throat. She seemed glad for his intervention and threw it to him.
' A voice rang in his head.
"Whatever man." He said grabbed a wrapped object which he prayed was a burger and then fries and beers but... "Dude!" Sam looked up, "Where's the pie!?"
The woman before him seemed to be in her late thirties, maybe early forties. Long black hair that was curled and went a past her chest. She wore a fun black leather jacket with a cliche white tank top with a sigil on it. He couldn't tell the eye color though- based on the lighting that she was in and where they where.
He was never good at resisting orders like that. He could think about the thousands of times an authority figure had told him to do something and with a tone like that he would do it as long as it meant he nor Sammy would get hurt if he listened. He was always a good soldier, did whatever he was asked by his...
He rose a brow. "The flirt to convert?" Castiel nodded. "Nah man, still not into that stuff- even when I have a literal angel in my backseat. Although this one time, she dressed up in this nun outfit and said if I came to church with her she would give me a proper lesson." He hums back on the memory, giving a light chuckle.
"Yet, Ruby insisted that you do it. Cleary she thinks that you go high mojo juice!"
Well isn't that an open ended question. "Maybe once a week? Depending on what we're hunting."
"And we where too late."
Sam's face fell slightly at the angel's words, and so did Dean's but for different reasons. Demon blood? What the hell was Cas talking about. "Let's keep it that way." Came the voice of the other angel.
Sam was going to question it further, but Dean's eyes widened and he quickly spun around, gun at the ready. The door was broken down and out popped a new woman. She had smooth black hair, pale skin, and looked like she was an emo biker to Dean. Yet, that wasn't what he focused on. It was her face... he took a step back with his eyes widening even larger. "How did you break that lock?" He yelled without giving the demon a chance.
Ruby scoffs slightly, a lost of words as she put a hand against her forehead. "Well I haven't exactly heard of anyone coming back from hell and being able to, it might be. Only Angel's and other demon's can see our true face through a meatsuit." However, she looked slightly more afraid than she did before.
The angel looked Dean, his blue eyes expressing the emotion he was concealing. Guilt. Sadness. Conditioning. "Want it, no. But I've been told that we need it."
"You are dreaming, Dean." The man confirms before Dean could even ask.
They really didn't have time to worry about this right now, because Sam looked up and saw an Angel statue bleeding out of it's own eyes. Yeah, that wasn't good. He pointed it out to Dean, who looked, and his eyes widened. "Shit." He swore and went over to Anna and grabbed her arm. "See that closet? Go into it, and don't come out until I say. Go! Now!" He yelled at her. Anna nodded and did as she was told.
Ruby watched in silence and hummed slightly as she watched the human guzzle away. She didn't think he would take as much as he did, but when one is addicted to something- it seems that they need to consume quite a bit to satisfy their hunger.
The angel didn't respond right away, he simply examined the medical instrument between his fingers and twirled it slightly. "It was disobedience. He was working against us." The angel explained.
Bobby looked over his shoulder at Dean, how gave a slight glare. He turned his direction back to Sam. "If he is, he's letting Dean hold the reigns for now."
Right as she did, the glass on every window in the home shattered into a thousand pieces, a loud high pitch squeal and noise ran throughout the room. Making Sam and Bobby clenching their hands tighter and hiding their faces into their shirts or doing anything to make the loud noise stop. Almost as if they where in pain.
Dean took a step forward, he still wasn't really armed with anything besides the knife that he held tightly in his grip. But he wasn't afraid of these angel's. Of course he wasn't with Castiel, since they've become closer lately with all the dream meetings, but with Uriel? He was so fucking annoyed with him. Why should he fear a dick comparer. "So, what? Need us to hunt the Demon for you?" He said raising a brow. "All show but no performance. Explains a lot." He smirked.
The lights began to burst in the motel and the street light blew up.
Bobby seemed to pause for a moment, seeming to study the others facial features. He let out a small shaky breath and walked over. Dean still was hesitant, but let the other walk towards him. Bobby smiled faintly and rested a hand on the other's shoulder. A long moment passed, before the older hunter takes the knife and lunges yet again. Dean ducks away, grabbing the hilt of the knife, shoving the other away. "Alright. If I was either, could I do this – with a silver knife?" Dean stated while rolling up his sleeves, one of his wrist scars present. He grimaces, slices his arm above the elbow with the knife. A line of red blood appears.
The two fatigued men cuddle closer than ever before and fall into a deep sleep. Lying with their one and only love, cherishing every minute of it. They wouldn’t wake for hours, not until Sam found them and screams with a joyous laugh: “Fucking finally!”
“Might as well be married, huh baby?” Dean says while wiggly eyebrows.
Eileen leans back from the hug to rub Jack’s head, “Missed you kiddo.”
“Really? Do I get to open it now?”
Much like that morning, the tables in the library wear tablecloths, beautiful cutlery, and dishes. People are bustling to and from the kitchen, chatting and setting the food on the table. There is a cheesy chicken casserole, courtesy of Jody and Donna, Jack’s stuffing, a variety of meat from a variety of sources (mostly Dean and Eileen), and Castiel’s homemade mac’n’cheese. Stevie and Charlie are giggling in a corner when the table is finally finished being set. If you go down the right side of the table you would see: Donna and Jody boasting about their girls, Claire and Kaia holding hands and playing footsie, and Charlie sneaking kisses to Stevie at every chance she gets. Jack sits at the head of the table and cuts the roast beef. On the left side of the tables that were pushed together are Sam and Eileen wiping food from each other’s faces far to frequently for it to be an accident, Dean almost sitting on Castiel’s lap with how close their chairs are (not to mention the hunter’s arm wrapped around his angel), and Patience and Alex conversing jovially.
“Don’t ya worry Cas. Imma make you feel really, really good” Dean answered in an almost sickening sweet tone (to others at least, Castiel loved it).
The other three don’t even bat an eyelash, they are far too used to their displays of affection. However, Dean does wear a splitting smile of pride for his brother and his girlfriend. A soft pink blush blooms across Sam’s face as the couple separates. Still standing under the mistletoe, Sam pecks the top of Eileen’s head and walks fully into the kitchen to help make the icing. His cheeks still glowed pink as he got out the mixing bowls.
As the boyfriends get to wrapping, their son and brother/best friend are putting the groceries away. As Sam is putting the beer into the back of the fridge, arms slide around his waist and squeeze. He turns around, the arms still on his hips, to see his girlfriend hugging him. The taller yet younger Winchester leans down to give her a kiss. Jack sees them from the pantry and smiles at their small act of love.
“Ok then Dean. Turn around.” Of course, him being the mouthy bottom that he refused to admit to, he answers: “Or what? Cas.”
“Yeah Dean?”
The young women, and Jack, at the other end of the table are leading a happier conversation. Claire is explaining how she and Kaia would drive out every night to see lights decorating local houses. She tells how it’s magical, impressive, and romantic with the right person. Jack’s eyes are filled with excitement at imaging all the different possibilities of the lights. Patience and Alex mention that they have been making ornaments for their tree. The nephilim asks if there are any for the Christmas tree in the bunker and surely enough, Alex pulls out three shiny globes from her bag on her chair. He rushes to place them on the tree, Dean calling after him telling him to slow down. The rest burst with laughter at Jack’s act of enthusiasm.
Castiel silences him with a kiss. The kiss turns to him smooching around Dean’s neck and cheeks. He pulls back to show a gummy smile to the one he loves. Dean leans back in at the invitation Castiel offers by baring his neck. When Dean’s lips attach to Castiel’s neck, the angel ejaculates. The hunter follows not long after. He pumps their dicks together lazily until Castiel rolls over for the second to last time that night to retrieve a few tissues. He swipes gently over their bellies to clean them of semen. The dirty tissues are thrown to the trash can in the corner and the box returns to the nightstand.
“We’re coming, we’re coming!” Dean calls out.
Forgetting his angelic nature, he slides his hands down Dean’s sides to his ankles and grabs. He then pushes up the hunter’s legs and buries his head in his crotch. Green and blue eyes never left each other as Cas licked open Dean’s hole. Not unlike what Cas felt before, Dean was getting scratched with Cas’ so called stubble, not that he was complainin’. No way could Dean fucking complain when he had Cas’ tongue up his ass. But he did need more friction on his dick. His hands found their way to fondle his balls and jack off, that was before Cas grabbed both wrists and held them on Dean’ somewhat soft belly.
“Really?” Cas can’t believe it but he’s damn hopeful. Dean has denied his feelings too long. Of all moments, this would be the one to tell Cas to stay? This would be the one the thing between them becomes reality? Surely not. Cas had held hope for awhile but decided that the hunter would never, could never face his true feelings. But just like he had from the very beginning, Dean surprises him with one simple word. And that word rolled off his tongue all too sweetly.
“Dean?” Cas asks with his hotter than Hell deep tone.
Dean offers a lazy smile when he says, “Hey Cas.”
“Oooo… Cas! Come on baby…”
The oven timer dinging snapped Jack out of his daydream of how the next morning would go. Without a word, he races from his seat at the map table to the kitchen to silence the alarm. Smoke rises from the oven when he opens it. The nephilim sticks his bare hand into the hot rectangular prism to test to see if the cookies and gingerbread is done. When he deems them ready, the three trays are pulled from the oven and set on the counter to cool and to be frosted. Out in the map room, the conversion is abuzz.
“Always Cas.”
“I… I love you angel.”
They pour everyone’s gifts (except for the ones for each other) out on the bed and begin to wrap. The wrapping paper, bows, ribbon, tags, etc. were already to go in the extra bedroom before they left for the town (Sam is smart like that).
“Can we go see it now?” Jack pipes up, “I want to see if it snowed!”
“I hope it’s normal” is muffled into Dean’s shoulder.
“Night baby.”
“Cas! They’re talking like we have a kid back there.”
“Dean… we’ve been over this. They’re your kid too. And while he doesn’t look it, he’s still only four years old… and half angel, so I’m pretty sure we’ll be fine.” Castiel responds.
“Then, I guess, yes please, make the whole world see me as yours again.” The angel gripped the shoulder tighter and white flashed out from under his hand. Dean’s body had shivered through the touch, letting out moans throughout the pleasant burn. “It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful Dean.” Then, Castiel’s hands wander down towards the forever growing cocks to put more pleasure there as well. He tests Dean by rubbing his right thumb through the slit on his uncut shaft. A broken moan. His fingers wrap around the two throbbing members. Another moan. The angel slowly starts to jack off both men simultaneously. His left hand finds Dean’s left nipple. As his thumb and pointer finger twists and pulls, the nipple hardens underneath.
“I prepared you for me the best I could, and you’re still so, so tight. You feel better than Heaven Dean.”
“I know. Oh, am I making you uncomfortable? I should go.” Cas unwraps his hand and stands to walk towards the door. But something stops him, a hand holding his wrist.
Dean squirts his own lube out of the bottle and leaves it in the mess of the covers. He’s panting now but that doesn’t deter him from his mission. The dirty blonde man manages to get his left hand down to his partner’s penis and starts stroking. Soft, unabashed moans start pouring out of Castiel’s mouth at the sudden pressure. Their hands meet under the covers and start caressing the hard-ons together. Since Dean is taking care of both of them, he guides his right hand under their dicks to fondle Dean’s balls. Castiel’s left hand finds his lover’s nipple and starts pinching. The hunter squeals at the shoot of pain, it doesn’t hate it though. In fact, he loves it. His cock leaks a bigger glob of precum when the angel does it again.
Baby pulls into the long tunnel of a garage, the only light coming from the impala’s headlights. The conversation turns off like a light as they succumb to the darkness. Jack and Sam take the groceries into the kitchen while Dean and Cas steal the gifts away to an extra bedroom to wrap.
Team Free Will was just getting back from a hunt. A fairly easy one too. Just two sibling vamps, took two days, nothing big. Yet, Dean was still tired. He’s getting old, not that he would admit it. He walks into the kitchen after dumping his stuff in his room to get a beer. His hand is deemed empty when he reaches into the fridge to grab one. Dean’s about to get really mad. He swings his head to look inside the fridge. Fuck! We’re out of all the damn beer! In the middle of his freak out, Cas walks into the kitchen and sees a frustrated Dean.
“Cas… come oooonnnn… I need you in me!! Not j-just your tongue. Come onnn…” Dean mewls out.
“Mhmm, thank you, Dean,” Cas returns, not understanding Dean’s obvious flirting, too into the thing burning between them.
“You guys got me a subscription to Technology Monthly? It’s crazy expensive!”
“Thanks Sam.”
“Heya Cas, all the damn beer is gone.” Dean tried to get out after his eyes had drifted to see Cas’ orange underwear sticking out of his suit. I swear that angel is trying to kill me.
After sadly detaching their lips again, Castiel asks: “Humans can no longer see my mark on you Dean. But angels can, would you like to see my mark on you once again Dean?”
“Well, if you’re human and it was the best fuck of your life, yes, but angel I don’t know.”
The hunter wraps his hand around his boyfriend’s coat and pulls his lips to his own. They share a sweet kiss for a few seconds before a loud ‘ewww’ can be heard from behind them. Dean, saddened, peels off his boyfriend’s side and turns to the end of the aisle. He hands go to his hips as he prepares a reprimand.
“Okay, Da- I mean Dean.”
“I have one more present for you Dean,” Castiel pushes his own snack into his mouth.
After spending far too long in the cold admiring the bees, the group returns to the warmth of the bunker. Hot mugs of coffee and hot cocoa line their hands as they finish opening the last of the Christmas gifts. The afternoon closes with the group making their way to the library once again, Sam falling asleep with his head in Eileen’s lap, and Jack snoozing/lying across his father’s laps, and the three still awake making quiet conversation.
“Whatcha smirkin’ about honey?”
“Cas…” is pulled from the hunter’s lips once again. A deep “Dean…” is returned from the angel’s while their foreheads rest together.
“Well, it just took Castiel saying a long, heartfelt speech then sacrificing himself for my sake.”
Dean would have liked to have woken up to birds chirping on Christmas morning. However, after seeing a lazy smile spread across his angel’s face when he realizes his boyfriend is awake, Dean wouldn’t have it any other way. A soft kiss is placed on the side of Castiel’s mouth in retaliation to the caressing of his arm. Pink blossoms across the hunter’s face when his memories of last night come rushing back to him.
"I haven't been practicing for a few weeks since Dean came back I-"
Dean blinked, okay. He's front page of Angel gossip, good to know. "So... you talk to angels?" He asked, wanting to have his own line of questioning for now.
Sam sighed and rubbed the back of his neck, something that Dean has noticed he had been doing a lot lately since he came back from hell. It creeped him out to say the least. This new mannerism made him worry a lot more about Sam than about himself. "We have a theory on what might be going on with you."
Castiel slowly nodded as the other spoke, understanding what the other was asking of him. "I am sure I can find a way to accomplish that task."
"Anna? Who's Anna? Angel reader?" Dean asked.
"Dean isn't here." Sam says furrowing his brows and growing with anger.
When they came back to Bobby's, the first thing wasn't a hello or a hug, more of surprise and worry. Dean remembered his father figure asking if they had a run in with a fat sucker monster that he couldn't remember the name of. It sounded like fish tacos or something along those lines. Of course, they said no to that claim and asked why. Guess it takes someone who hasn't seen you in person for awhile to notice a weight drop.
The younger Winchester followed close behind. "Well, what did Bobby tell you?" He asks.
The angel continued. "When Dean gave up his soul to save you, Sam. He was tortured and tortured others. I'll let him tell you the rest once he feel's comfortable. You see... being in hell for that long can damage someone. Usually it would take years to a century to have one's soul ruined to a point it would be impossible to fix." Castiel paused a moment and looked over to the wall. Sam could only assume Dean was over there, a part of him wanted to know how Dean was reacting to this- to know if he needed comfort or to know if he was saying anything.
"Oh, and I am?" Dean asked with a scoff.
"You don't have to be asleep for me to come and see you Dean."
"So that's what this is about!" Dean laughed, god he was so damn stupid. How did he not see it before. "Your want me to stay put, because of Ruby? What does she think I'm a threat to your addiction?" He asked.
"Angel's are dying, boy." Uriel stated.
Dean finished the sandwich in a little over a minute and looked up at Sam, who had pure fear and empathy on his face- not sure on what to do or say. Dean could tell that Sam wanted to talk to someone, probably Ruby to get some help.
"Lilith is not behind this. She wouldn't kill seven angels! Oh, she'd kill a hundred, a thousand!"
After the angels had disappeared with Dean, Sam was left alone with Bobby and neither knew what to do about it. They don't know much about angels nor how to track them so they where at a lost. Of course there are spells to use, but all of those weren't working for some off reason. They tried to a spell by using Dean's saliva that they extracted from an old bottle of beer, but it kept giving them different locations. Of course they tried other items and spells, but it was like something was purposely messing with the spell. They may know some of Angel's abilities, but they know that they can't exactly alter a location spell. Or at least they think so for the time being. So when all else failed, Sam called Ruby for help. "I need your help to find out where they took Dean."
Sam put a hand against his neck where his brother gestured, and his face flushed pink and the tips of his ears went red. "Had to pass the time somehow." He chuckled and looked down, shaking his head. "I can't believe you're alive man." The young Winchester let out a relieved sigh, not really know what else to say.
Castiel turned to walk away- but Sam grabbed his shoulder tightly. "You are not disappearing like this. Tell me what's going on with my brother! What did you do to him!? He's going to die and that's because of you!" Sam yelled yet again.
Castiel let out a small breath, which Dean made out as a huff. Guess talking badly about God offends Angels. "He was the one who gave orders to save you. Free you from perdition. This is the thanks that you give this man? He raised you for a reason dean, when the time is right!"
"Ugh, my head." Dean mumbled.
Dean responded the moment she said that, he stood up out of his seat and pulled the cloth off of the table as hard as he could which it also happened to flip the table over at the same time. Demonstrating an odd sense of strength. The candles came crashing to the floor and the shaking of the room went away and the TV shut off. Dean panted heavily as he looked at Pamela who looked furious, turning to stand but froze when she looked at Dean- her eyes wide.
"It's been awhile, give me a second." Bobby stated simply.
Ruby rose a brow. "And you are?" She asked.
"It wasn't eight months." He finally spoke.
Sam was watching nearby, his arms folded as he was leaning against the stairs, not able to watch what was going on. Dean couldn't blame him. He knew the other thought he was being possessed by something that wasn't him. Yet, Dean didn't know how to prove it was him though.
Sam rolled his eyes, "Fine." He says holding his hand out.
"I heard you last night." Bobby suddenly spoke again.
"We have our orders-"
"You've been doing this demon physic thing behind my back!?" Dean yells, raising his gun as he heard large thumps from the base of the church.
"Great, just great." He stood up and walked over to the fridge, wanting to grab any left over whisky but he knew that there wasn't any left. Dean decided on the next best thing. He kicked a chair out of frustration before pacing the front of the room next to the window and door. "So why aren't you and your little 'superior'-" Dean said while raising his hands for air quotes, "- out there doing something about this!?" He huffed.
Dean was still slightly frozen in place, and Sam spoke first. "Dean- that's Ruby, she's here to help."
The angel nodded. "Yes, we are here for her."
The huffs slightly, seeming to understand, yet still looking frustrated. "That's a fair argument... but with this year, I'm not surprised. We're running out of time, and if there are angels out there- then we need them."
"Sam what is she talking about!?" He yelled.
"Oh, quit being a baby would ya? Mister brand new skin can't handle a little pain." Bobby teased, moving the needle back down to finish the tattoo. It was almost done, thankfully. Also Dean wasn't being a baby about this, he could look down and see his skin being torn but the harsh force of the needle. Of course, he wasn't going to mention that.
Okay, Cas didn't have to put it in such a blunt way. He really didn't need to feel more like an idiot today than he usually does. But to be sure- Dean pinches his arm and let out a small hiss, all of this while still looking at the angel. However, he frowns when it didn't do anything to make the image of the angel disappear. With the time allowed, he looked at the angel in the same way he had in the car. It was strange, this did feel a little different with having Castiel standing in front of him. However, his eyes widened after a moment.
There was a moment of pause from the angel before he spoke. "Hello, Dean."
"I can't believe every mark on you is gone, Dean. Even that stupid one where you and your brother where wrestling and you got a scar from his nail." Bobby randomly spoke.
He watched as Castiel's eyebrows furrowed together, his demeanor was the clearest it had ever been. The amount of disgust that was present on his face indicated that angels must DISPISE demons. Dean couldn't blame him. "I told you that you cannot trust the Demon who is with Anna currently."
"So I was only raised from hell, because my father was somehow seen as holy- which is a crapload of shit- and I have to clean up his damn mess. Again." Dean scoffed.
"And you two where the one's who did it to me in the first place!" He yelled back.
"You're our best hope, Dean." Castiel said softly.
"Don't give me that
Dean scoffs and walked away from them, he paced the ground before going over to the window, looking out the glass and to the world beneath him. Did they seriously expect him to sit on his damn ass and do nothing? They haven't even left the house since they arrived a little under a week ago, what were they so afraid of. "So you're telling me, you want me on the bench just because I've lost weight? You know how ridiculous that sounds, right?" He stated, not looking back at his family. "If you seriously expect me to stay here, then you better throw me into Bobby's panic room."
"Dean! Stop!" He yelled looking around and grabbing a scalpel that had fallen to the floor when the tray was thrown. "This is for the best. Besides, you won't even remember it when you wake up." Sam says before walking over to Dean's body only as more things began to be thrown.
Castiel nodded. "I did see that. You're prayers always seem to reflect around him and not yourself."
Sam furrowed his brows, looking more confused than ever. He looked to Bobby who gave a disappointing look. He younger brother let out a small breath as he walked over to his brother to the window, his arms folded as he stood beside him. "What do you mean, Dean?"
Sam huffs and shoved Dean off of himself, now standing. "I tried everything. That's the truth. I tried opening the Devil's Gate. Hell, I tried to bargain, Dean, but no demon would deal, all right? You were rotting in Hell for months. For months, and I couldn't stop it. So I'm sorry it wasn't me, all right? Dean, I'm sorry..."
Finally, after finding at a gas station that was not abandoned this time- he hot wired a car that was good looking enough, but nothing like his baby. He wondered if Sam kept her nice and tuned up while he had her. Another thing he found out, was that he had been gone for well almost a year, 8 months. Imagine that sort of shock. He also found out what day it was. It was his birthday... January 24th. What an odd present, heh... The idea that Dean came back on his birthday made his shoulders tense. May 15th was when he died, it was so long ago. He could only imagine what could have happened in that time. Also to be raised now? It felt like some sort of crude joke that a demon was pulling.
"Start with gratitude."
"I don't know!"
Dean shrugged slightly as he rubbed his head. "I dunno, uh- Ruby got us at the motel and uh... I just collapsed on the way here." Also the part were demon are actually not causing him to feel this way but ANGELS apparently are because Ruby is sooo trustworthy. Of course, Dean kept that to himself for now.
He glared, anger slowly rising his his chest and grabs Sam tightly by the shirt. "There's no other way that this could have gone down. Now tell the truth!"
Castiel obviously was not expecting this question, and he looked away and looked to be standing up. Dean's eyes widen and he quickly grabbed the other's hand just as the angel was balancing on the branch, looking to have only been a moment from flying away. "Please, I need to know." The angel looked down at the desperate hunter, but he only shook his head.
"Boy, what the hell have you been doing!?" Bobby yelled, throwing his cap back onto his head.
"You're an idiot. Anyways, what happened after? How did you even find me?"
The sound in the room went quiet as Bobby turned off the tattoo machine, the buzzing that was in the background of their conversation dissipated. Dean carefully sat up and threw his shirt on after Bobby wrapped up his chest. Apparently it was meant to prevent infection, who knew. He waited a moment before handing Dean a mirror so he could look at the work itself. He looked around and smirks slightly when he sees that all the lines where straight and in the proper places that it should be. Thank you, Bobby. He must have just been filling in the black when he kept pricking him.
"Uh, yeah.
He sleeps.
Sam hissed loudly as the scalpel was ripped from his hand, the blade sliced across his palm. It didn't matter. The anti-possession symbol was ruined and shouldn't be affective. He looked over to Ruby and nearly dodged a full on desk that was left in the room. "Ruby, do it- now!"
luck. Yet, he just doesn't know enough about revelations to know exactly what has happened and what is going to happen.
He had completely forgot about that. Dean looked backed at his arms and made a small 'huh' noise before speaking. "I have no clue. I guess this resurrected body just doesn't like getting hurt anymore. Awesome." He said with a small smirk.
"But... how did you bust out?"
Again, no response.
His breathing shutters for a moment, he felt this overwhelming urge to just bolt out of the station and into the hail thunder storm and find Sam. God, was Sam even okay? Last thing to remember was that demon.. Lilith- had them trapped inside of a house and had Dean and Sam pinned when... Dean let out another shaky breath, not wanting to think about those awful creatures. The way the rotten flesh hung off of the hellhounds body, the blood and mucus that formed in every pore, it's large and gnashing teeth- claws that looked like bones that tore away at his body as if it was butter.
Bobby chuckled and gave a nod. "Yeah, you two where young. Maybe fourteen and eighteen I think? Although the fight wasn't really fair, because you where still a foot taller than him."
The hunter/torture smirked. "Maybe you're right. But now it's my turn to carve." He said coming closer. Dean held his hand against Alistair's neck for a moment, forcing the demons head against their confines. "You know something, Alastair? I could still dream. Even in hell. And over and over and over, you know what I dreamt? I dreamt of this moment."
Dean looked down at the floor, scared to speak. "You've become very blunt lately." He mumbled.
There was a knock on the door, and Sam looked. A part of him pleaded that it would be an angel, but it was just the doctor who was treating him from before. Sam stood up from his seat as the doctor walked in, carrying a clipboard in his hands. He seemed to have a neutral expression on his face, but Sam could tell that there was going to be something wrong. "What's the news doc?" he asked.
"I told you, I'm not Castiel." Dean said exhausted at this point.
They where currently in Bobby's basement. They thought it would be for the best to do this in a much more secluded area than what Pamela's house provided. Also all of Bobby's interrogation tools where located at his house so this was better for everyone. Except for Dean, who was bound in a rope that was soaked in holy water and thrown into the trunk of the impala so he couldn't escape.
He furrowed his brows. "What did you do?" He asks.
"Over what?" Castiel asked.
Dean nodded, rubbing his face with his hands as he let out a hearty yawn, smacking his slightly. "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just a little hungry was all-"
One second he is pulling on the chains the next he is being hung about a foot higher where his toes barely touched the floor. Jumper cables clicked to his embedded hooks. A battery large enough to power a building was connected to. Alistair stood a mere two feet away from the suspended man and had a white controller in his grasp. "Now, for the past forty years, I have been offering you the same deal over and over again. Do you know why that is?"
Sam looked at her, she had a good point and right now he would honestly do anything to drink some demon blood. To feel stronger and make his addiction worst. It made him feel powerful and that he could protect Dean. "It's still weird. Drinking blood from you is a bit erotic, but you're
Maybe Sam should've let Ruby stay in control, that way Dean wouldn't even being in pain right now. Ruby didn't seem to be in pain while she was in control. He didn't know what to do, how would he even know what to do? He looked around quickly and noticed the room wasn't shaking anymore, the noise stopped, and Dean's eyes where back to normal, he was just in extreme pain.
The demon huffs a bit and chuckles loudly. Dean was anything other than impressed. "Go directly to hell. Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars."
He took a deep breath, but it was a harsh one. Dean slowly stood up from his seat- took another deep breath- and yeeted his bottle across the kitchen.
"Sam!" He said relieved, not a second passed before the brothers ingulfed each other in a hug. A tight hug. A hug that honestly hurt Dean's restored body. Dean let out a shaky breath as he relished in the warmth of his brother. They always hugged whenever they thought the other or themselves were going to die. You'd think they'd hug more often based off of that.  Slowly Sam pulled away from Dean, and sat down on the bed beside. Dean made room obviously by sitting up and hanging his legs over the side of the bed. He gave a soft chuckle before smirking as he gestured up, "Is that a hickey?" Dean asks.
The Winchester rolled his eyes and looked back up at the ceiling. "Sorry, man. It just hurts a lot more than the first time I got this done."
Pamela looked up to him. "Might be your gain." She winks before standing up and setting the candles on the table in a unique pattern while also taking the one's from Dean.
However, Dean in a second felt at peace. The pain subsided for a second as was finally able to see. The ceiling looked crumbly, like every piece was about to fall onto him. Then, he heard a voice. It wasn't Sam's or his own.
Dean took another deep breath, he felt his stomach tightening just at the memories. He wanted to throw up, he felt extremely nauseous. His head was still pounding from earlier, but he had to press on... "They, uh... They sliced and carved and tore at me in ways that you... Until there was nothing left. And then, suddenly... I would be whole again... like magic... just so they could start in all over." He looked down, his hands grabbing at the hospital mattress. "And Alastair... at the end of every day... every one... he would come over. And he would make me an offer."
"Thanks Daddy, I already had the birds and the bee's talk." Dean rolled his eyes.
"Don't think I will, but you can eat something else." Dean smirked, grabbing the demons chin and shoveling salt down Alistair's throat while he tried to scream and only to be muffled by the salt and the burns. But, Dean was a man of his word, so he had to stand by it. Another slice cut right across the Demon's precious eye.
It didn't help.
The brother rose a brow, but he nodded. It was clear Sam wanted to finish the conversation as well, but it was also clear that he knew that he wasn't going to get through to Dean at this moment and maybe not even tonight. "Alright, I'll go get us something." He said walking to the door, he reached for the knob and looked back at Dean who had his own hand on the bathroom door. "Anything you want specifically?" He asked.
Dean arched his neck to see what was there. Silver blades, holy water, holy wood, dead man's blood, iron, holy oil, and a lot of other things that he couldn't quite make out. He looked over to Sam with begging eyes. "Sam, are you just going to let him torture me?"
Dean's eyes widened. "Meg?" He repeats.
The human slowly nods, finding that to be an excuse that trumps all excuses. Out of the billions of years this angel has been alive, he never found time for some action? That is almost depressing. "Well trust me, if you keep hanging out with me? You won't die a virgin, I can assure you that."
Castiel rose his head expectantly, but didn't say anything so Dean could have the room that he needed to speak. Dean took a deep breath, ran a hand down his face as he spoke. "Is it true? Did John and I break the first seal? Did I help start all of this?"
Sam kept his promise. As soon as the other was unresponsive, Sam carried his older brother's body to the impala and drove him straight to the hospital. Of course he didn't mention anything about the sudden weight lost, only that he was in a fight with an animal but didn't know what kind and that was about it. He knew that was the best way to avoid cops being there and showing up to ask questions. All he needed to do right now was get his brother fixed up so they could get back on the road.
Who said falling two levels through glass and onto the street below had to be graceful?
"Because the side of it LITERALLY says demon fucking blood! And that liquid is way too solid to be alcohol." He huffed.
"But you also said that you stopped doing that, remember?" Dean asked with a glare.
The brother rubbed the back of his neck before walking over to the side of the bed, and sat down at the foot of it. Dean rose a brow and sat up to meet his brother's height. Well- as best as he could. Sam took a deep breath and looked to his brother, not beating around the bush. "Ruby gave me a spell, I was able to track you down with Bobby. I found you in this warehouse's basement. Castiel was pinned against the wall, and you where on the ground. I killed Alistair and I brought you here."
Anna's eyes widened slightly, a small smile forming on her lips. "Yes, Thank you."
"My apologizes." Castiel stated with a nod before taking a step back from the other. The angel sort of looked like a kicked puppy when he said that.
Dean rolled his eyes as he finished the bottle and just dropped it in front of him. He heard the glass clunking against the branches as it descended from above, eventually hearing a large crash as the glass broke. It's a dream anyways, so it wasn't littering. "So in terms, he doesn't give a fuck about his creations. Would of shocked me there." He said in a sarcastic tone.
He watched Castiel think about this concept, although it didn't seem like he was thinking about anything. His blue eyes just stared right at Dean. Yet- Dean couldn't look away. He didn't know why... he only looked away for a second, wetting his lips with his tongue then looking back at Cas. However, he noticed how tense the other's shoulders seemed and how stiff he was sitting in his baby. No one is allowed to be uncomfortable in his car. "You okay, Cas?"
Now that truly made Dean lose all sense of cool that he had in that moment. "You what!? That is unacceptable. Once I wake up, you get some angel ipods earbuds or whatever and listen to Led Zepplin, I promise you won't regret it."
Bobby waited a moment to see if there was any burning, before letting out another sigh of relief. "Sorry, can never be too careful."
He went to turn away, leave to continue his journey but he heard a voice. "Another one bites the dust to leave."
Sam gave out a small chuckle, and his shoulders relaxed as he fell back against the back rest of the seat. Dean watched as his brother let out a small sigh of relief. "No one likes hospitals." He smirked, which only made Dean roll his eyes. "Don't worry, you're healed so we can just leave after you get dressed."
Dean rolled his eyes and folded his arms. "I know that Ruby thinks something angelic is happening to me. Maybe she suggested they are stealing and eating me up to make me stronger. Oh wait, no, that's a fucking demon. But the babe Ruby must know everything, I know she hasn't been around. But I also know  that you sneak out to go see her. I wake up every time! Then there's..." he paused and looked away.
"Because..." Sam started. "He hasn't faced a demon like Alistair before. He's very powerful according to Ruby and I wanted to make sure he was safe."
In the car, Dean was slumped against the window in an annoyed huff. He really wanted to drive his car that has way more sentimental value to himself than it did to Sam. He was sure of it. Nothing beats being on the open road with nothing between you and whatever monster you're about to slaughter. Nothing beats it. He looked over at his brother, who was mouthing the words to the song that was currently playing.
TW: Graphic depictions of torture.
Dean's eye widened as he turned around to see what that sound was. Nothing looking odd until he found his gaze being attracted to what looked like to be a ball that was a few yards behind him. It must've hit the ground hard to make that noise. He looked around for a moment before hearing another-
The next thing Dean heard was Ruby's voice, this time it sounded like it was filled with concern - but it felt fake. Maybe it was the delirious nature at the moment, but it just didn't sound right. "What happened!?" The demon yelled.
"I honestly don't know... I've never seen eyes glow like that before." Dean didn't think much else of that. It wasn't a lie, it was strictly truth and there wasn't anything he could think of to cause it.
The brother looked at the other a bit skeptical, it was obvious he was nervous about something but wasn't going to say what. So, Dean just rolled his eyes and looked into the bag and started pulling out the food items. He paused for a moment and pulled out a flask, the one he had seen Sammy with earlier. "What's this?" He asked. Dean examined it for a moment, noting the patterns on the outside as well as what looked like a black or red stain that was near the lip of the flask.
Uriel smirked. "That's why we've come to get his favorite student. You happened to be the most qualified man we got."
"Now's not the time to bellyache about Sam going darkside. He does his thing, he exorcises that demon, or we die." Ruby retorts, glaring at Dean's direction. If looks could kill, he was sure Ruby would have just slaughtered him.
The giant gave a bitter laugh, sitting down on the chair that was adjacent to the bed instead of sitting back on the bed.  "Well... Bobby didn't call me." He said in a soft tone.
There was a crashing noise, which made both of them cringe. Dean looked behind him to see what the noise was, but he didn't see anything and looked back to Sam who was staring down at Dean's hand. Dean followed the gaze and looked at the trunk and his eyes widen slightly as he carefully removed his hand from the car. A large dent now present on the lid of the truck. He gulps slightly and the brothers look back at each other. "We need to find out what's wrong with me... and fast." Dean said softly as he walked away from the trunk and got into the car.
Bobby was much more hesitant but sighs, knowing that deep down he wasn't going to stop Dean from going. "Fine, just don't have him driving."
The strange part was seeing the same man, identical, in the same clothes, standing beside his parents- looking at the body on the bed. Now Dean gave a rational thought at first, maybe it was a twin? Reasonable sense. Yet, this was the Winchester life, nothing is reasonable. Also if it was a twin, why would they be wearing the same clothes?
"Hey Hey Hey! Stay with me Dean, it's gonna be okay, I promise." Sam said but paused in shock. He gulps as he saw a bright blue light on Dean's tiny cuts on his face. Slowly starting to heal, however, the moment Dean closed his eyes- they went away.
"Don't talk unless you are spoken too. I would also suggest not struggling, because the more you do, the higher I will turn up the settings." The demon warned.
Her posture was so strange to see on Dean. Her flippant nature and head tosses, the struts. No one recognizes the differences in ones mannerisms, but this was very noticeable. Sam sighs and shakes his head. "He's going to notice that I'm not hallucinating or shaking like I am right now." He stated while rubbing the back of his neck.
"You don't seem too happy about it." Ruby comments, folding her arms with a small huff.
Dean looked over at Sam and smirked. "Nope."
Dean spat at the decrepit demon, his own blood mixing with the demons wounds. It was something that Dean found odd while being in hell. Every demon had a distinct look, like their own face. However, it was torn and bruised and bloody. They could heal easily, so why do they insist on looking so disgusting. No wonder they could steal vessels, who would want an ugly slut like them waltzing around? "Shove it up your ass, Alistair. I ain't doing nothing." He glared.
stated.
"I told you, Dean. When you fell asleep in the car. We don't visit in only dreams." He said simply.
Castiel seemed to nod in understanding, but he did sit up a bit but still had his back against the seat, just not in such an awkward position this time. He combed a hand through his hair, making it seem more 'presentable' in Dean's words. "Angel's don't sleep." He stated.
Sam's eyes widen as he rushed over, grabbing her shoulder. "Let Dean take control, you being in the front is going to kill you both!"
Sam rose a brow. "I may love to shop, Dean, but I will never buy your bullshit."
The angel glared and looked over to Dean, Dean was mostly out of it, similar as to the way he felt when they saved Anna and he was exhausted. This time though, he was in pain. A small part of Dean looked to Castiel and swore he could have seen pure and genuine concern for him.
Dean rose a brow, folding his arms across his chest. "No thanks to you." The hunter rolled his eyes before pausing and looking back at the angel. Then, he looked to his body, then back at Cas once more. "This isn't a dream. How can you see me?"
"What are you?" Came a voice from behind him.
"Tell me what is going on with him!" He heard Sam yell.
Dean gasps loudly, his body finally breaking to the surface. The sun was radiating brightly, and he felt his skin burn slightly. Never has he missed the light before. He didn't know how long he was gone for, all he knew... is that he was back, and that's all that mattered.
Even though he wasn't looking, he knew Sam was watching him, his every move, his voice. But Dean knew that the moment he would look over to his brother he would break. "To take me off the rack... if I put souls on... if I started the torturing. And every day, I told him to stick it where the sun shines. For forty years, I told him..."
Dean took it and mumbled a small 'thanks' and grabbed the bottle, downing a good chunk of it before shaking his head at the other. "You sure about Ruby? 'Cause I think it's just as likely she used us to find radio girl and then brought that demon in to kill us."
By the time Dean was done, he collapsed onto the floor as his blue and white glowing eyes faded back into their original emerald green. He rested his head back against the wall as he let out heavy breaths to catch some air back into his lungs. Shaking gasps left his throat as he heard the water from the sink and shower spraying onto the ground. Bobby is not going to be happy with him. He doesn't know where that amount of strength came from, but right now... he didn't care. He felt a bit of relief, but he knew it would be short lived, like most things in his life are.
"You got the girl, good. Let's go." Ruby says simply and was getting ready to turn down the stairs.
? He did know in revelations it did say the weather would be catastrophic, and by the size of those hail balls... people could have easily had died. The car he drove in had dents from it for Pete's sake, and it was a well built car. Of course not his baby, but a modern car that was built well. Dean was real lucky with that gas station having a metal roof. He could see the dents from the inside, he could only imagine the people who were left in the storm or homes that were ruined...
"So, she told you all about the seals?"
Sam chuckled, took a step to the right, and rested his back against the wall now. "I thought you would've wanted to see the 'hot nurses' clean." The younger brother teased.
"Or what? Who's going to stop us? You two- or this demon whore?" Uriel stated. He lifted his hand and Ruby was thrown against the wall, that was enough for Sam to lift his knife and lunge forward at Uriel. A quick dodge sent Sam out of range, but he got back up and continued his assault on the angel.
While he did that, he could heard Sam leaving the room for some reason but he didn't know what the reason was. Dean eventually came out of the bathroom, dressed in clothes that seemed to be way bigger all of the sudden. His normal flannel shirt hung lose and his green jacket wasn't as snug. He had his necklace on of course, which felt the same.
Dean lets out a small growl, punching Alistair square in the jaw before walking away, trying to practice his breathing to stay calm, He couldn't lose his cool in here. Don't lose it Dean! You need information, so get the damn information. The sooner you do that, the sooner you can go home to see Sammy and Bobby.
The creature, now known as Castiel took a step away from Dean, releasing his grip and allowing Dean down. Which Dean decided that now was a good time to fix his outfit, which he did quickly before folding his arms across his chest, studying the man before him for any bullshit he might have in his answer. "I am an angel of the lord."
Thankfully, Sam was back down soon and handed over the sandwich first to Dean. Once Dean had it in his hands he started gulfing it down. He was inhaling the food, not even waiting for himself to finish a bite before taking another one. Sounds of lips smacking and squashing noises where the only sounds heard in the basement.
Dean stood up from his bench, immediately furious as he gripped in a different angle. "No, we aren't going back to Bobby's. I spent way too much time there as it is, and I'm fine. I probably got knocked out by angel juice or something and that's why I've been asleep."
Dean looked down at his knuckles, multiple cuts and chunks of tile embedded into his flesh. This time it was only a little bit of blood pooling down his fingers which made him gulp slightly. He waited a long time, sitting in the slowly flooding bathroom before the blue and white light appeared on his cuts and sealed them back together, the foreign bodies disappearing out of view. He gave a sad chuckle before standing up, the back of his pants soaked in water. There was no way to explain this to Bobby, he'll just have to worry about it later.
"Right."
Dean let go. Did Castiel have some sort of angelic claim on him ever since he was risen from heaven? Is that why he could hear Cas in his head or in the real world and no one else around him could? That better not be why. Something is wrong here. Very, very wrong. He took a deep breath and walked around his bed and sat down in the chair that was beside his bed. There has got to be a way to zap his body back awake and heal.
Sam grabbed the wall and pulled himself back up, trying to regain his balance. "Ruby! What's going on!?" He yelled.
Castiel spoke this time, seeming more timid than before. "Dean, we know that this is difficult to understand."
Dean rolled his eyes at that, he hated how vague people can be sometimes. "Whatever, man."
"I'm not lying, okay? Look, Dean, I wish I had done it, all right?"
Honestly, it probably doesn't matter anyways. He couldn't remember his last time being almost dead after he woke up. Dean was only able to remember it after he went to hell. They used almost every memory he had against him, so this one was dug deep into his subconscious, so now he remembered.
Yeah, that never went well and Dean would fake most of the naps he took. He was rested, it was only really that first day he was falling over due to the lack of sleep. He would stay awake and listen to his brother's conversations with Bobby, as well as the secret phone calls that were being made to that demon Ruby. He still didn't trust her with anything. The first two of those days, Dean couldn't stop eating. Yet, he got to a point where he could stop. He felt satisfied even thought he was craving more. Yet, he knew if he kept eating so much they wouldn't let him out on any cases until he stopped munching down so hard.
Dean's jaw dropped, "Yo, yo, yo! You have seen every generation? That is so cool, man. Also who is your favorite musical person?"
"Exactly, hosts! Which means Dean is still there."
Cas paused for a moment, blinking a few times and looking away.
"God is a busy man, he cannot be bothered with millions of prayers per day." The angel tried to explain to the hunter.
A sigh. "I'm sure you saw that my most relaxed memories revolved around him. His life."
The dazed hunter put his hand up, blocking the light slightly which was also a sign for the other to let go, thankfully Sam did. Dean's eyes were still adjusting but he could watch as Sam sat down on the coffee table in front of him. How long had he been out for? It was still dark outside so it couldn't have been for that long, right? He let out a soft groan and rubbed his eyes. He felt rested enough, little tired but that's nothing new for his life. Wasn't hungry really, which was new for his life. Although, he could kill for a burger right about now. "How long was I out?" he asked, surprised by how dry his throat felt.
Okay, there has got to be a reasonable cause for this. Maybe cuts heal faster than what he remembers. He was in hell for a long time. Yeah that's not going to cut it. He turns on the sink and splashes his face with water. Nothing is wrong, and he is fine. Dean let out a small sigh and looked back up at the mirror, "Godamnit-!" He said was he flinched, before looking back down.
He did not need to feel like this. There was no reason to be mad. He wasn't worth god's time. He didn't even believe in god. He hated god. Hated him! But how can you hate something that doesn't exist.
Yup! That about does it. Dean gave out a soft chuckle, just his luck. The ones angel's who were supposed to be the good guys according to biblical messes, were actually huge assholes. He couldn't catch a damn break. Any faith that he had just went right out the window as well. "You're some heartless sons of bitches, you know that?"
The Angel nodded, and it almost looked like he had a small smirk on his face, but Dean wasn't completely sure. So he decided to not comment on it. "That is actually why I came to speak with you today."
Dean watched as something snapped inside of the angel, he seemed to charge forward - so the hunter reacted to the threat. He grabbed the knife, rose it high, and struck the angel right in the chest. It didn't stop the angel who easily restrained the human. Dean was forced against the counter top, his lower back digging into the tile as he struggled against the angel.
Dean growled slightly. "Why does it matter if I do or don't?"
Dean was taken aback by that, did he have a sticker on him announcing to the world who he was? If so, he needed to take that off prompto. "You heard of me?" He asked.
"Fuck!" He swore as the volts were sent once again.
The demon was swift and quick, he runs in quick and grabbed Sam before tossing him down the stairs in one swift swoop. Before he can turn back around, Dean fires the salt rock bullets right into the mans heart. He hunched over, and Dean grabbed his own knife and runs over onto the Demon's back, stabbing it right into the Demon's jaw and thrashing right through the bone.
"Damnit Sammy!" All color left the older Winchester's face, he let out a small scoff as he hung his head. Of course she did, of fucking course. Can he catch a break already? Almost been alive for a day and it's like nothing changed from when he left. Dean didn't look up before turning on his heels and walking into the kitchen. He heard muffled footsteps behind him, knowing that they belonged to Sam, but for now he didn't care. He needed a goddamn drink.
sound before Castiel disappeared from view. He took a deep breath with a sigh before walking over to his chair and sitting back down on the seat. He gingerly took his brother's hand and held it tightly. "We'll get through this Dean, like we always do."
He came back over while trying to maintain balance, his gun was cocked and ready while Sam pulled out a knife. Dean couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Sure would be the right time to have the magic knife." He commented.
Her attention was now pulled away from Dean, who he just realized was staring at him the entire time. "Yes, I can tell you exactly. September 18th."
Dean yanks the blade across his flesh, hissing softly as the silver embedded into his flesh. He watched for a long time as his blood slowly crawled down his arm from the angle it was at. Some blood dropped to the cement and pavement. It stung like any other blade would, and that is a good thing. His blood was the same color. Great!
Also, how come he was able to see and interact with a spirit? Last time when he was in this condition inside of a hospital, he couldn't speak or talk to anyone who wasn't his reaper. Yeah, he could see the reaper sucking souls out of peoples bodies, but he hadn't been able to see a soul outside of their body ever. God, what is happening to him.
The woman as reception didn't look up, she went through her clipboard that was filled with papers. Filling each one out as if she hadn't heard a word from the worried patient before her. Dean shakes his head. This better not be happening. He waved his hand in front of the glass. "Hello! Can you hear me!?" He yelled.
Dean looked back over at his brother and nodded, "Okay. While we're here though, you should get your neck checked. You keep rubbing it." He said before carefully getting off of the bed and ripping out the IV that was placed in his arm. He also took out the weird tube thing that was in his nose, because it was itching and he didn't need it. A quick glance around gave away to the fact that his clothes where in a folded pile on a counter, so Dean grabbed them and headed into the bathroom to change.
He turns off the water and pats his face dry. It's not HIS fault he is like this! If it was, shouldn't he know why this was? They've encountered things of this nature before. Somebody accidentally summoning an evil spirit and unknowingly kill people or hurting themselves. Yet, there where no signs of that either. Why couldn't he just know WHAT is happening? At least let Sammy know so he doesn't blow a gasket.
The tears began to flood again, no matter how hard Dean tried to choke the tears back, no matter how hard he kept pausing to collect his voice, they just kept coming. "What kind of man does that to their own son...? What son does that to their old man?" He asked softly, not looking for an answer. "He's not my dad... not anymore..." He swallows. "The things I did... the things I do..."
"Because she saved my life." He said simply.
The angel nodded and walked closer to Dean, invading his personal space yet again and gave his eye stare. The human returned the look, he didn't know what it was for. Usually when given this look, it was before an argument or a seriously personal situation that he was not going to get into. So right now, the other searching his soul was a bit strange. "You need to be more careful, you're dying from your lack of caution."
Alistair looked over at the torture devices and laughed whole heartedly. Dean just ignored him. However, that action made the demon smile brightly. "I'm sorry. This is a very serious, very emotional situation for you. I shouldn't laugh, I really shouldn't! But it's just that—I mean, are they serious? They sent you to torture me?"
"You think me seeing all of your fun little kinky toys will scare me into spilling my guts?"
Slowly he sits up, his fingers pinching the bridge of his nose between his eyes. His hands get placed beside him as he slowly began to stand up. Yet, before he could he paused.
He froze, now sitting on the back of his needs. "Excuse me?"
His eyes slowly started to glow, the mirror reflecting that light that came. This hasn't happened since Pamela's, but Dean didn't care. The feeling in his chest and the aching in his head only allowed it to compel more. "Fuck him!" Dean yelled, his fist smashing against the mirror.
Dean couldn't help but smirk at his ridiculousness. A sense of pride rose in his chest, knowing that his brother felt some sort of normalcy and found something that really intrigued him. Well, as far as singing a song in a car can go. He looked back out the window and just looked out at the scenery. He remembered driving along roads like this back when he was a child. A bunch of kids would be riding off the side of the car, riding their bikes into ditches and getting covered in mud. The kids where usually around his age, and a part of him wished he could be that stupid and mess around. Honestly, he wish he could've had friends to share those stupid experiences with.
for it. The storm had really picked up speed, the noise of crashing glass and bits of hail thundering to the ground made the earth shake below his feet. "Fuck-" He grunts loudly as bits of hail started to hit his shoulders and legs as he ran. The feeling of welts took over his body, making it more difficult to run. The wind, exhaustion, everything was just making it worst.
"It was eight months up here, but time... I don't know." He takes a deep breath. "Times different down there. Sam, it was more like eighty years. Almost triple my time on earth."
Ruby, now being in control of Dean the moment he fell asleep. It was something that Sam had gotten used to, Ruby jumping in at random moments. It gave him whiplash sometimes at just how quick it was. Most of the time it's when Dean was asleep so he was a little more prepared for it. However, the thing was, she wasn't able to give Sam any more blood. Her former vessel was under the secret compartment of the weapons, so Dean had yet to notice the body. That body was still alive of course, but it was no longer possessed so it no longer had any demon blood to give.
Dean shook his head and raised a bottle to his lips, nursing on it's contents with a small shrug. "Should have guessed. Haven't felt this relaxed in years."
"I told you I was telling you the short version, idjit." Bobby said with a glare.
"Good work Sam..." He said before yawning and rubbing his eyes.
"Yeah, yeah I know- I'll pop it back in once I'm done here." He glanced over and grabbed the whiskey from the others hand, "Gimme that." Sam mumbled and undid the cap before being careful and drenching his wound with the stuff, causing the youngest to hiss slightly.
"You want to know what's the best thing about demons?" Dean asked Alistair.
Castiel thinks for a moment. "Subconscious is different then unconscious. For him to use grace in this way, he would need to have some cognitive function from his soul. His soul is before us, so he cannot use it." Castiel looked over at where Sam thought Dean was standing. "His grace being bounded with his soul. It's rather interesting to behold amongst other spirits."
Dean took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair, his eyes closed as he tried to regain his composure. He noticed now that Castiel wasn't saying anything, which he was thankful for.
out of a cage that he's been trapped in since the beginning of time. To do this she is breaking these seal things that I guess are supposed to be locks. She just needs to break 66 of them and boom- Hell on earth?"
The hunter growled, his eyes furrowed for a moment. He used his free hand and punched Uriel in the face harshly with all the force he could manage. It worked. Uriel let go as he stumbled back while Dean quickly got off of the ground as he shook his wrist as the burning went away. However the hairs on his neck warned him that they weren't done yet. The angel put a hand to his nose and looked down. Blood. Uriel growled, "Well, I'm going to enjoy this." He smiled.
Thankfully, Bobby had every thing that Ruby needed to make the spell. It was a little odd to the demon how the hunter was able to have everything so quickly. Yet again, anyone who associated with the Winchesters seemed to always be prepared for any little thing. Sam stood beside the demon while Bobby folded his arms and watched as she worked. She mixed the gathered items and throws the liquified contents onto the map which soak from corner to corner. Then she picked up a candle, one made of infant fat, bones of a bird, and the tears of a demon. "Ostende nobis puerum quis est occultatum locum suum servat gratia." She chanted, before holding the candle to the edge of the map, which lit the paper ablaze in mere seconds. "Ad eius situm et merces gloriosum."
"Does she know what the seals are?"
For now, he just needed to hunker down and wait for this storm to pass. Dean grabbed every bar of food he could, going for the candy bars but having enough sense to actually grab granola or protein bars. If Sam was here, he would probably give Dean a proper chew out on how protein bars would give him enough strength to actually make it to Bobby's home and not pass out on the way until he can get some actual food.
"Of hell?" He clarifies.
"Who happened to say angels, and also happen to say the same name as Pamela?" Dean went silent and looked down, taking in his sandwich to ignore his brother for the time being. He heard Sam sigh and didn't look up. He also listened to the chair scooting out and large feet walking to the kitchen to make another sandwich. "Just accept it Dean, something good happened for a change."
"It's your skin, idjit."
Castiel rose his hand and the knife began to turn in the demons shoulder. Alistair cried out before grabbing the hilt of the knife and tossing it away and to the side. Moments later he charges at the angel, and they ensue into a large fight. Demon vs Angel. Sounds like a bad punchline. However in the end, Alistair slams Castiel against the wall, choking him. "Well, like roaches, you celestials. Now, I really wish I knew how to kill you." He says looking back over to Dean. "I guess that's why you tried to save the humans hides, huh? Because celestials are all selfish about what is theirs aren't they?" He smirked and looked back at the angel. "Really wish I knew how to kill you, But all I can do is send you back to heaven."
“I think I’ve been in here for so long I don’t even know what a celebration looks like anymore”
“Son of a bitch”, he whispered.
“And he
“And what if he does, Dean?” his brother offered, kindly. “Would that really be so bad?”
“Liar”, Dean straightened up on his lap so that their eyes were leveled “You love wearing my clothes”
“…And” Castiel carried on as if he hadn’t been interrupted. “To my understanding, Agent 87 was a very effective spy. Although mostly on accident”.
Dean searched his pockets for a second but apparently didn't find whatever he was looking for, since he cursed under his breath and turned to Jack.
Dean patted him on the shoulder.
The worst part was that, without time to sit down and have a proper conversation, Cass and Dean had fallen back into their old dynamic. At first, there was an awkwardness to it but eventually, even that started to fade. They were warm towards each other, but it was as if Cass's confession or everything that had happened in the Empty was stored away as if it had never happened. None of them seemed to know how to address it now that things were back to normal, so they simply didn't. After one week of that crap, Dean was starting to feel as if he had made it all up in his head. It was driving him insane. Until one day he finally had Cass alone. And he had no idea what to do with that.
“He’s a kid. And he’s a hunter”, Dean made sure she understood what he was saying. “As long as he’s in this life, he’s in danger, Claire”.
“It’s a 67 Chevrolet Impala”, he told Benny, smiling like a proud parent. “It was my father’s car. I learned how to drive in it, slept in the backseat more times than I can count…” He took a break as if he was picking his favorite memories, but it was too hard because of how many of them there were. Then he laughed “I thought Sam how to drive it too. He almost recked it a couple of times”.
“My point is..." he continued, ignoring Benny's question. "You can rest for a moment, Cas”
“What the hell is that kid doing here?”, Dean was surprised by how angry his voice came out. Ever since Cas returned from the Empty, Dean had tried to avoid any of his occasional outbursts of rage or even sour moods. After getting his angel back, he felt like he was done being pissed at the world.
He was so happy at that moment that it was unimaginable how he could have taught "just saying it" would be enough. Compared to what he was feeling now, the happiness he had experienced at the bunker was nothing.
I'll also alter the number of chapters very soon. I think I'll need two or three more to finish the story.
“Yes!”, Dean snarled, rising from the table. He was done with this conversation. “That’s not even an option and you know it”.
But no matter how much he repeated that to himself, he could feel Cas’s hand slipping away. The sound of the portal around him got louder and louder and the pressure around his body pulling him in got stronger. He could barely see anything that wasn’t the portal’s shining blue light. He couldn’t see Cas anymore and… suddenly he couldn’t feel Cas’s hand on his anymore.
"I'm not drinking my brother's blood." Sam said sitting down on his bed, his arms crossed.
"So what- you're just giving up?" Dean asked, his tone harsh as he stood up from the bed, he looked to Sam who stood up the moment he saw Dean standing. "Giving up on me? Thanks guys."
Bobby leaned back in his chair, having what almost seemed like a smirk on his face as he looked over at Sam. This smirk was very peculiar, almost as if it was for knowing that something was about to happen, or that he wanted something to happen. "Would you like to tell him, Sam?"
Sam's eyes widen slightly. "Ruby? You said you would only wake him up." He said folded his arms with a glare.
"I'm saying... that maybe I should stay longer so his body can heal."
Sam nodded standing up now and reaching his hand down to Dean, which Dean took thankfully. As he stood, he did stumble a bit but Sam was right there to catch him just in case. "Okay, well ah- good, nothing else happened so there's that at least."
Sam followed Ruby down to the basement, and he saw what seemed to be an altar. He went over to it and noted that it just seemed to be a bowl filled with what he can only assume to be various materials, most of them akin to leaves, herbs or petals set before a circular sigil. It was in four quadrants and had different symbols inside of them. He looked over at the floor and saw a line mark in a circle, he could only assume it was the holy oil that Ruby had been talking about earlier.
The silence was deadly. Neither of the brothers liked the silence. Dean needed to get out of this situation and get some sort of sound into the place. How could he do it though?
"Like before I was dragged to hell? I can see her actual face. How fucking thin is this damn veil?" He huffed and lowed his gun for now, his unbeknownst shaking making it difficult to hold it.
She looked back over and sighed softly. "Look... I was going to just mist in and mist out, but Sam... Dean is actually really damaged internally. I can feel the grace that you where talking about, but it isn't enough to heal all of this." Ruby said simply.
"Yeah, they talk, and sometimes I just... hear them in my head." Her voice shook slightly, almost as if she was nervous to say that last bit.
"Needed? Nuh uh- we just got back from being needed with the whole Anna situation."
The lights flickers to off to on again. Sam rubs the back of his neck. This was not good, and he hoped Dean could stay out of harms way long enough for his plan to take affect. "Look, I got a plan on how to help you. Just- don't freak out when it happens." The lights flickered on and off quickly and Sam rose his hands. "I'm not selling my soul! Don't worry about that." He said looking over to the light switch, knowing that Dean was over there but not exactly where. "You just have to trust me, okay?"
"That is a lie." Castiel spoke, which made Dean readjust in his seat. Of course it was. "There are 600 seals that contain Lucifer, however, only 66 need to be broken." He explained.
The door opened, and there stood Bobby. Busted cap and tan vest, a plaid long sleeve shirt underneath. His beard also looked a little more gray than it had been before, and his eyes looked sunken in, but his eyes where wide as he looked and saw Dean. In one piece.
"Here's the thing Sam-" Dean says now slowly standing up, his body still aching. It must've showed, because Sam stood up at the same time and his feet planted, as if he was expecting Dean to fall. "Don't you think that if angels were real, that some hunter somewhere would have seen one... at some point... ever?"
"Don't lie to me, Sammy."
"Everybody's dying these days. And hey, I get it. You're all-powerful. I don't give a rats ass about other angels if they're all like you. But yeah, mister junkless. You can make me do whatever you want. But you can't make me do this." Dean stated.
"Eat me." He growled.
Dean waited for a second before speaking, but he had to look at the wall behind his brother where Bobby was. "It's changing, I thought it was nothing at first but now it's progressed to a point that I can't ignore." He looked back at his brother, his hands shoved down into his pockets as he saw his brother's left eye dark and black. The left side of his face looked dehydrated and scared, almost bloody to a point.  However, on the right side of his face he saw his brother's perfectly healthy skin and worried eye. "You're starting to look like a Demon, Sammy."
He rose a brow. "Why?"
The doctor nodded and picked up the clipboard once more. "He's dying. Even without all of the injuries he has now. Honestly he's lucky that he was attacked or he might have never known. The extended coma form the trauma is due to his body not having the energy to sustain him. His body will heal slow because of this. There is no saying when or if he will get out of here."
"Dean, what do you remember?" Sam asked, his gaze never leaving his brother.
The hunter took another deep breath, opening his eyes as he looked at the metal door. He's been feeling more on edge for awhile now- but he thought that was because of the torturing. However, looking out that window, he knew it must've been something else. He saw a ginger red haired girl outside. Was that Anna? He'll check in a little bit, he had to finish this first. "No. I don't think you are lying. But even
Once the thought came, it opened the dam of everything that happened while in hell. Dean's chest began to tighten as he sucked in deep hissing breaths. He looked around, even though he knew no one was there with him, before wrapping his arms around his head and letting out a shaky breath. He needed to get out of here, the longer he was left alone- the more he felt his heart aching and his brain tearing him up inside- this aching inside seemed to amplify. He needed to find Sam.
The brother hid the instrument behind his back. "Sorry, I saw a spider."
He can worry about that later, right now he needed to find Bobby and Sam. Also in the mean time he should probably find out what the date is exactly and how long he had been gone for. Dean picked up the jacket and put it back on his person, hopefully he could get a shower in soon, he smelt like a wet siren. He adjusted his jacket accordingly, the cuffs of the sleeves kept rubbing against the scars and it was very irritating.
"What's the matter?" Castiel asks, another step. "You don't think you deserve to be saved?"
Ruby gave a small smile as she strokes the hunters hair. "It's okay, Sam." She said while developing a smirk across her face.
"Dean!" Sam tried to cut in again.
"I'm not talking about that." He says going back over to where he grabbed the whisky from before, he opens it up, but the door was shut quite aggressively before he could grab anything. He growled as he saw his brothers hand on the fridge door. "Sam!" He yelled as he looked up at Sam.
Dean rolled his eyes and moved past Sam, going out into the hallway while rubbing his chin and eyes. He looked even more like shit with all that dirt gone. He probably looked like that zombie they ganked awhile ago with pale skin and dark circles under his eyes. "Mind explaining what the fuck that means? Bobby said the same thing, I could use some context clues." He states while going down the stairs.
"You're ready." The voice stated.
Sam shakes his head, his hands curling into fists as he listened to this 'angel of the lord' speak to him. "This whole thing was pointless. You understand that? The demons aren't doing the hits. Something else is killing your soldiers." The hunter scoffed slightly.
The demon looked at Sam, not sure what to say at this moment but she did sigh and put a hand on Sam's shoulder. "Find out what is wrong with him, then I'll do it. But good luck explaining to him why his possession tattoo is gone and the memory of me possessing him."
The human looked at the other and took a deep breath, he really wanted and really didn't want to do this. He didn't have a choice. Even with Ruby helping him heal on the inside, Dean just got worst by the day. He refuses to admit it, but Sam sees it. "Fine, but how much longer are you going to stay inside of him?"
tone, you and your brother use it enough as it is."
Sam rose his hands and rubbed them down his face, letting out a heavy breath as he tried to control himself. "How... how do you know that this is an angelic thing and not demonic?"
Dean continued on, "Tell me Sam! You said it yourself that you can do things with your mind, not just visions anymore. You went top ten in the NBA so you must be able to do GREAT things."
Dean rolled his eyes and slowly stood up, Sam was quick to his feet to help him out. Taking his older brothers arm and tossing it over his shoulders so he could better support him. "Dude, I don't have a broken leg."
The angel nodded in understanding, for someone that Dean assumed to be rather old due to him being an angel- he assumed that he would have known more about this than what he was letting on.
It caused Dean to flinch, his ears turning a bright read. "Woah. Well, he didn't touch me there."
There was an awkward pause, the silence was deafening as the other angel closed the door that they had blown open. Dean wondered if this was the superior that Castiel mentioned the day before. "And I, you." Cas stated, finally grabbing and shaking the other's hand. "Sam Winchester." His hand folded over the hunters. "The boy with the Demon blood. It's good to hear you have ceased your extracurricular activities."
The hunter takes deep breaths, forcing himself to calm down again. However his eyes widen as he looked to the side and saw his older brother. "DEAN!" He screamed, quickly Sam ran over and collapsed onto the floor next to him. He panicked as he quickly felt for his brother's pulse. It was there, barely, but there. He let out shaky breaths as he pulled his brother's body close to himself. Sam shook with fear. "Dean! Dean wake up!" He cried out.
"Bobby, I'm fine. I was dead for eight months, I think I got my beauty sleep."
The hunter's head was hung as he looked back up, his eyes blurred by drowsiness. It might now have been much, but he could feel his body slowly starting to reconstruct. His broken limbs and joints slowly cracking back into place. The pain of healing was worst that the process of being broken in the first place. That's the one thing about hell that most no one knows. Torture is the best part, so what happens when there is nothing left? Start all over again. The was the answer from the king of hell.
The kid now known as Kevin shrugged. "I'm not sure. I'm guessing we're all patients based on our attire, but no one can hear me, and my double is in my bed."
"Look - Dean, we all are trying to fix this and prevent the seals from being broken. We've told every hunter that we know, gave them the typical omens to look for, and a lot of us are trying to study as much of revelations as possible to see where each and every seal would be located or performed." Sam now stood up, his arms folding slightly across his chest as he watched his brother.
Dean's eyes opened as he was being shaken, he let out a loud gasp as he looked around quickly. He was still in the bed from earlier, gun still under the bed. He looked to the window and saw that the darkness was gone, it was probably the middle of the day now based on where the sun was in the sky. He looked back up finally and let out a relieved sigh.
The boy looked up, nodding slowly. "Yeah, I forgot about that one. That happened when we where staying the night staying the night after hunting a Shojo, right?"
'." Dean said in a deep voice with a little flare to mimic Castiel's voice in his annoyance.
"Please, Ruby. All I need for you to do is heal him up enough so that he can wake up. He can heal the rest of it himself." Sam stated.
There was a long moment of pause before he spoke up, the silence- Dean did not appreciate. "You've been missing for days... and I wanted to find you, but there was no way of figuring out where you went. So... while I waited, I finished things up with Anna."
So there was no need to worry, everything was hunky Dory and he would just have to wrap it up with the first aid kit when Sam got back. Buuuuut....
Sam chuckled, looking at Dean with an overexaggerated nod. "Oh, completely. I've been groped here more times than I can count."
The angel tilted his head. "You cannot see him. He is in his soul state currently. Angel's can see the dead and other creatures alike. He followed you down here, but had a few problems trying to escape his reaper."
"I didn't do anything bad, I took her to see Pam. And get this... she's a fallen angel."
Dean couldn't look away from the window, his hand gripping the handle of the door. "I'm going to need a few things."
"Has she helped STOP a seal from being broken!?" Dean shouted, only pausing to take a swig of his beer, wiping his mouth off with his sleeve jacket.
"We?" He asks.
"Ruby!" Sam said loudly.
The angel looked down at the floor for a moment, before back up at Dean. He didn't seem to show how he felt in this situation, or at least know how to express it. "If we can get him to talk, we need to take all courses of action."
They where driving to Pamela's, a physic that they knew - well, a physic that Bobby knew who has only had a few interactions with Sam over the past year. Bobby said that she knew a spell for them to figure out who or what saved him from hell.
A hand went down to his wrist, his thumb tracing the outline of the mark. It was obviously a hand print. He couldn't help but think what could have left it, he didn't want to search all his memories of hell to see if a demon or Jo-... just any demon would've burned him with their hands. Probably not a wise decision.
"Dean-"
"Saying what?" He asked.
"We had to break the first seal before any others. Only way to get the dominoes to fall, right? Topple the one at the front of the line." The demon continued on. "When we win, when we bring on the apocalypse and burn this earth down, we'll owe it all to you,
Cass looked at Dean, his expression gave off an expectant look - well, as expectant one could look when they have and almost blank expression. "19."
Dean pushed himself off of the wall, his arms fell to his sides as he glared at the person in front of hi. He had a real damn good bullshit detector, but this dude's face was a fucking stone wall. "Sure, right. Why would an angel rescue me from hell?"
"What are you saying?"
Sam grabbed Dean roughly by the wrist, forcing the other to spin in a slight circle. Thankfully he was able to keep his feet plated, however it did make the brother dizzy. He carefully put his other free had against his head, but he did give a small glare as Sam spoke. "No more lies, Dean! There is something up with you. Just because you can't see it, or won't accept it, doesn't mean I will try and avoid it. Something is wrong, and I can't help but think it has something to do with hell."
"Well it's just as easy to trap a demon. It's holy fire. Grab holy oil and circle it around the angel and light it on fire. He can't step or pass through it. Do this and he'll have to tell you. I also recommend for you to do it quicker before that reaper finds your brother." Ruby warned.
"As a matter of fact, we are. And?" Castiel asked.
Sam let out a deep breath and sits down beside her, why was she not understanding how important this was to him. He hands where in fists as he tried to speak again. "I don't
The hunter didn't look away from Uriel, but he acknowledged what his companion said. "Yeah, well, he's like a black belt in torture. I mean, you guys are out of your league."
Second's later there was shaking around them, chairs moved from their places as the furniture shook. The walls rattling and floor rumbling. Things fell to the floor and Sam looked to Dean, Dean returned the look.
Dean couldn't blame her, it probably would've sounded crazy to anyone else but them. "Like- right now?"
Soon the Winchester started his trek up and out of the forest. He had to admit, the forest was a good place to bury a body in case he decided to come back and haunt something. However, the thought made his shoulders tense. Why didn't Sammy and Bobby burn him? Why was he buried? The main to prevent someone from coming back as a vengeful spirit or something along that nature is to have the body cremated or burned like a star wars movie.
"I'm going as fast as I can." Sam retorted from the bedroom, he got a rather nasty slice across his arm. Currently he was stitching up his own wound. Thankfully the hotel had their own first aid kit.
Dean watched Sam do that and he had to look away for a small bit, he never liked seeing his little brother in pain. Even when it was something as stupid as stubbing a toe into the corner of the  table. Sammy used to do that a lot, growing up and being that tall at a young age tends to make someone rather clumsy. So whenever he had to watch Sam stitch up or clean a wound- always made him a bit nauseous. "So, you lost the magic knife, huh?"
"Yeah, Anna now hosting Angel radio on T-69." Dean said with a nod.
Sam put his hands into his jean pockets, sighing softly. Dean could see his brother going into deep thought. The way his brows furrowed as he stared off at a nearby wall, how he bit his inner cheek to concentrate. Dean didn't know exactly what he was thinking. Maybe he was going through thousands of pages of lore, or maybe he was just trying to find out if Dean was lying. Only time would tell.
Sam noticed the grease and put his hands up, "I clean her, I promise!"
Who else would it have been besides the angel himself kneeling in front of him. The distance was so close, that Dean could feel the other's warm breath flickering against his skin. The other was in his trench coat as normal, but his gorgeous black wings sparkled. They extended up high and proud, so close to touching the ceiling. "Cas, we've talked about this. Personal space." Dean stated, slowly sitting back in his chair.
"Who says?" Uriel smirked slightly.
He closed his eyes, rubbing a hand down his face as he thought about this situation. He wasn't ready to die yet. He wasn't ready to die a year ago, and he's not ready to die now. He reopened his eyes and flinched for a second, "Goddamn it." He swore as he looked up.
During the time that the brothers were eating, a nice towel woman had come into the room - however it wasn't a towel woman nor house keeping. It was Ruby. She came and told them to come quick and go to a certain cabin in the woods that was a long ways out. The demon came out with a little skit to be let in and let the boys know who she was, however, Dean knew right away who she was. Guess the whore forgot that he could see Demon's faces for some reason. He still needed to ask Cass about that, but he didn't get time to do so.
They got to the motel, and Dean was exhausted, a lot more recently. He's been able to keep up on it, but it was still draining. He hadn't found out what was wrong with him, Sam has kept that secret for the past two weeks and Dean has just been struggling. Trying to deal with the shit inside of him, and helping his little brother.
Uriel walked slowly up to Dean, staying quiet before standing directly in front of the hunter. "I think I'll go seek revelation. We might have some further orders."
