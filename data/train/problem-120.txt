Mrs Hudson had popped in earlier during the day, accompanied by Molly and the two women had fussed over Sherlock.  He'd been amazed by his own good behaviour.  He hadn't snapped at them to be quiet or to stop worrying; that had been John.  About an hour into their visit, John had told them, none too kindly, to shut up or leave.  The shocked silence that followed was broken only by the sound of a patient further down the corridor coughing. John had quickly apologised, citing lack of sleep as an excuse for his behaviour.  Sherlock had been confused, knowing that John had slept well the night before but had remained quiet. Mrs Hudson had produced clean clothes for Sherlock to travel home in, along with his beloved coat and he had hugged her, her usual thoughtfulness very much appreciated.  Molly had offered to take the flowers down to the nurses' office or to give them to patients who were lacking them. Sherlock had agreed but requested to keep the still-flowering cactus with him.  The ladies had left soon afterwards, taking the flowers and most of John's belongings with them.  The room had looked strangely bare then, adding to Sherlock's desperate need to be home and John's growing discomfort.
John’s previously lax hands suddenly tighten and it is that which drives Sherlock into oblivion with a shout.
"I know you've never had sex with anyone, but what about kissing? Or just attraction?" John has altered his position on the bed, now sitting closer to Sherlock's waist than thighs, his hands linked loosely in his lap.
John feels desperate now.  He had presumed Sherlock would be the one to be overwhelmed. But with each new suck, kiss, lave and sigh, John can feel how wrong he was.  All of his cells are flooded with Sherlock; each new touch to his skin sends electric pulses straight to his cock.  The last of his self control snaps and he pulls at Sherlock 's hair, wrenching him away from his neck.  His hips pump frantically against Sherlock's thigh, seeking more friction. A pleasured gasp is pulled from Sherlock; John curses with desire when he sees his own desperation reflected in him.  Sherlock's eyes are heavy-lidded, his lips red and swollen, and his colour high.  His breath is coming in short gulps and gasps, interspersed with broken moans and calls to a deity he doesn't believe in.  John's deep moan draws an answering whimper from Sherlock and his hands once again trail over John's shoulders and arms.  John suddenly realises that part of Sherlock's utter focus on his neck had been Sherlock trying to ground himself, trying to retain some control over his own body and emotions.  John doesn't want that, he wants Sherlock to be acting on impulse, for them each to lose themselves in the other.   Swallowing and breathing deeply, John slows  down his frantic thrusting and drifts his hands down Sherlock's back until they are resting on his deliciously rounded backside.   John gently guides Sherlock's hips forward until his erection presses firmly against John's stomach.  The sensation of heat and hardness floods through him and his moan joins Sherlock's.  Squeezing and releasing the flesh beneath his hands, John silently encourages Sherlock to press against him. The feeling of Sherlock's muscles moving under his hands sends a shiver of pleasure down John's spine, such strength and virility under his control.  John doesn't recall ever being this aroused before and he knows it's only through his own sheer bloody mindedness, his own determined stubbornness that he hasn't come in his underwear already. He - they - have waited too long for this to rush it all now.
Deepest thanks, of course, to my wonderful beta, Lockedinjohnlock!
Sherlock tries to keep the fake affronted look on his face but soon joins in with John’s heartfelt laughter, ridiculously pleased that he has managed to make John laugh despite everything.
The nurse checks the feed on John’s pain medication, tidies all signs of her work away and leaves the room as silently as she had entered.
Sherlock's phone now sat on the arm of his chair, its continuing silence deafening. He had heard nothing from John. No calls. No texts. No emails. Nothing. Once again, Sherlock picked the phone up, rapidly flicking from screen to screen, pale eyes studying for any updates. For the fifth time in thirty minutes, Sherlock turned his phone off, allowing it to shut down completely, before powering it back up. Still nothing. Finally he checked the wifi connection, all as it should be. John had not contacted him as he had promised. Logical conclusion - Sherlock had frightened him away with his  need, with his lack of self control. With his sentiment.
"There, that looks more comfortable." John's eyes flicker over to the monitor, studying the read out, before turning and running a cool hand over Sherlock's forehead. Just this simple touch is enough to raise goosebumps on Sherlock's bare chest and he shivers. "Cold?" Not waiting for an answer, John pulls up the thin hospital sheet and positions it over Sherlock, leaving it to settle just below the bandage stuck to Sherlock's almost equally pale chest. "Sitting up isn't too much strain for you is it?" At a shake of Sherlock's head, John sits on the edge of the bed and grabs the cup of ice. He holds a small chip momentarily in his fingers over the cup before gently smoothing the melting ice over Sherlock's sore lips, finally slipping it between them when Sherlock parts them. The cool water feels heavenly in his mouth but far too little and he eagerly parts his lips when the next piece of ice touches against them. This time some of the water actually slips down his sore throat and he groans at the sensation, the sound rough even to his own ears. He watches as John pauses in the act of offering the next chip, closing his eyes and taking a breath before opening them again. The ice touches his lips almost in a caress and he feels his face flood with colour when John's fingertips linger against his lips, both men seemingly reluctant to move.
Sherlock sighs in to his neck, causing goosebumps to cascade over John’s skin.
After what seemed like an eternity the cab pulled up at 221B Baker Street. Glancing up whilst paying the driver John was able to see Sherlock clearly outlined at the window, his violin poised for playing. He had an overwhelming urge to wave and smile but was able to turn it into a curt nod and barely raised hand. He knew,of course, that Sherlock would have seen the aborted wave and would be looking very smug at John's sentimentality.
A brief nod and John's hand makes contact, not on the swelling jut of Sherlock's cock but on the taut muscles of Sherlock's stomach. John stands slowly, the blanket falling to the floor before being unceremoniously kicked away. John's other hand makes contact on soft skin and Sherlock gasps, the simple touch flooding his body with sensation. John smoothes his palms across Sherlock's stomach, watching his hands move, until he has a firm grip on Sherlock's sides, his hands curling over the curve of Sherlock's hip bones. Sherlock is becoming more breathless in-spite-of (or should that be because of? His addled brain supplies) John's anchoring touch. He raises his hands to grip John's shoulders, an empty attempt to ground himself. The coarse rub of John's shirt under his fingertips only serves to mark the differences in their attire but bizarrely Sherlock doesn't feel helpless or over-powered. He can feel the way John is trembling beneath his palms, hear the harsh puffs of breath as John tries to calm his racing emotions.
" I guess the question that remains is, what do we do about Ms Morstan? Has any evidence been found that clearly links her to any wrong-doing under her current alias? Does enough evidence exist to arrest her for any of her previous crimes? Have her extradited to the US, perhaps?" John questions, hopeful that they now have enough evidence against her to have her removed from his life for the foreseeable future.
The doctor arrives promptly at nine o'clock and Sherlock and John both listen intently to his advice.  Sherlock is to keep the wound clean and covered for the next week, then he will be able to remove the dressing if the site remains clear of infection.  He has been given pain killers and antibiotics ( to be used only if required) and he is strongly advised to keep physical activity to a minimum.  No high impact sports for at least the next month and John adds that there are to be no cases that take him away from the flat at Baker Street.  He is told he can meditate, do basic yoga and Pilates but no complicated moves and nothing that puts pressure on his wound. There is a moment of awkwardness when the doctor mentions that intimate relations are permitted but nothing 'crazy, athletic or requiring weight to be borne on Sherlock's chest.' Sherlock had opened his mouth to ask precisely what was allowable, but a quick pinch to his thigh from John had caused him to close it with a click.
Finally, John looked up, meeting Sherlock's gaze.  Sherlock felt his stomach flip, as if thousands of butterflies were struggling to escape.
“He is your husband.  He loves you, you supposedly love him, you must be here when he awakes.”  Sherlock insists.
John raised his head and looked along the length of Sherlock's trembling body, his eyes met with Sherlock's, they were black with passion and smouldering dangerously. John groaned at the sight, this man beneath him was such a sexual creature, every look and movement made John desire him more. A smile, a downward glance, even his voice could turn a reasonable person into trembling jelly, from fear of his acerbic tongue or from desire. John loved all sides of Sherlock. It was almost too much for him to bear, he wanted to feel Sherlock inside him, to feel him as he thrust deeply into him, but he wanted to make this moment last. He still felt like he was inside one of his own fantasies and was loath to wake up.
Thanks, as always, goes to the fantastic Lockedinjohnlock! An awesome beta and a great podficcer!
“We have a private room ready for you.
“For god’s sake John, try and come up with something new to say.”  Despite the apparent impatience of his words, Sherlock is smiling whilst he busies himself spreading butter on his toast.
"Yes." John's voice rings clear. "My fucking wife." Cold fury manifest in each word.
Glancing at Sherlock's face, John was relieved to see that he appeared to be resting much more peacefully and he felt a sudden wave of exhaustion wash over him.  Reluctant to leave Sherlock on his own, fearful of a repeat attack, he lay down close to him, stilling when Sherlock snuffled in his sleep.  John heard his name escape Sherlock’s lips, its sound barely more than a sigh and saw Sherlock's hand stretching out, searching for contact in his sleep.
John watches with professional interest as Gethin changes Sherlock’s dressing, unable to suppress the hiss that breaks forth at the sight of the bullet hole that his…. that Mary….had put in Sherlock - forcing all thought of old scars from John’s mind.
Frozen I held my breath.
"Because you are in need of comfort. You derive a high level of it from physical contact and I want to give that level of comfort to you."  Sherlock holds up his hand, stopping John's next 'why'. "You are my partner and my lover, surely that is reason 'why' enough."
"Oi! Nothing wrong with my hand size," John interrupts good-naturedly, placing his hand around the side of Sherlock's neck, his fingers playing with the long hair at Sherlock's nape.
"God yes." Sherlock's deep baritone caused shivers of anticipation to race down John's spine. Pulling Sherlock up, John took the opportunity to push their naked bodies together.  Briefly wrapping his arms around him in a full body embrace, before tugging him into Sherlock's own bedroom.
Sherlock nibbled at his toast, occasionally glancing across at John who was now absorbed reading one of the many cold case files littering the flat. Knowing that he needed to eat and drink Sherlock kept chewing and sipping, finally surprising himself when all the toast and tea were gone.
"John. No more teasing. Please."  Sherlock is begging and he is too far gone in his passion to be embarrassed or ashamed.
Resting his face against Sherlock's shoulder, John's eyes drift closed.  His earlier carnal desire is still there,  banked - a burning ember needing only a breath of oxygen to set it aflame again.  At the gentle press of lips against his hair, John tilts his face up, silently encouraging Sherlock to kiss him again.  Light kisses fall like summer rain on his face and he breathes a sigh of complete contentment. The kisses slow, and then stop, as Sherlock rests his forehead against John's, his deep breaths caressing John's face.
John announces in an effort to break the strange silence, heavy with more than just words left unsaid.
Sherlock glances at John, before speaking to the waiter once more.
That’s the whole of it.”
“Why are you acting as if you care, Mary? You’re love is as fake as your pregnancy, it seems.”  He spits a mouthful of blood on to the ground at her feet.
Taking a steadying breath, Sherlock turns around, and is utterly unprepared for the vision before him.
"Right. Fine. Right." John stands and starts to pace, hand alternately rubbing over the scruff of his beard and the nape of his neck. "Bloody hell." He pauses, mid-pace, squaring his shoulders, pointing directly at Sherlock. "Sherlock, you need to promise me that if she is pregnant, whether that baby is mine or not, that you will do everything within your power to see that it goes to a safe and loving home. Hell, it can come and live with us if needed!"
“This is dull.  I don't do well with dull.”  Sherlock’s complaining draws John out of his increasingly depressing thoughts and back to the present day.  As usual, Sherlock ignores the muttered ‘no kidding’ John gives and ploughs on.  “Tell me what happened earlier, you've done well at avoiding giving me any information so far but that won’t last, so admit defeat now and tell me.”
“Right, that’s all our clothes away.  I’ve put your toiletries bag next to mine in the bathroom.”  John calls, closing the wardrobe door. “Fancy a cuppa?”
We’ve discussed this.”
“We can share an appetiser between us, if you want.  Neither of us are big eaters, and I know you’ll want to stay alert.”  John suggests, looking hopeful.
No time is wasted on a verbal response; a laugh is startled out of John as he finds himself being tugged towards Sherlock's room.   John laughs more as they barrel through the bedroom door; he's thrilled that even with the new development in their relationship they are still essentially the same, the madman and his blogger.  Sherlock laughs briefly with John before pushing him firmly against the closed bedroom door. John moans as Sherlock presses his long body against his, all earlier shyness gone.   Sherlock steps back slightly, smirking at the plaintive groan from John, before waving a hand around the dimly lit room.
"I guess it's time to dance then?" Sherlock could hear the breathlessness behind the calm words, see the flash of fire in John's eyes, the heat now flooding his cheeks. Yes. John had been eagerly anticipating this too. Perhaps as much as he was.
Don’t get the one on your head wet at all, keep it out of the water - I’m afraid that means no hair washing for a few more days at least.”
successful attempt to stop him poking either of his fellow passengers. He suspects that Sherlock may have some bruises on his arms and thighs tomorrow that will look suspiciously like John's fingertips.
"John? There's no need to worry, I'll take care of you." Sherlock's eyes are soft as he pulls John into an embrace.
The night passes quietly and Sherlock and John only wake for the early morning medication call, falling asleep again soon after.
"Right. Ok." John pulls himself to attention, actively making the decision to move the day forward even if that does mean giving blood and having to masturbate on demand. He allows himself a smirk, realising that at least he won't have any shortage of images to use for that particular activity. "Food and pain killers first, then you can at least shave the worst of that fur off - I have an electric razor you can use. Once your painkillers are up to full effectiveness we will go to Bart's. Get it all sorted."
"John." Sherlock's voice is rusty from disuse and his throat aches with the effort, but he pushes on, determined to be as brave as John, to let his emotions out, finally. "I didn't do it to hurt you, or for no reason." He pauses, biting his lip, knowing that his next words will either break John further or finally start to mend them both. "I did it to protect you. I always do things to protect you." He stops when John squeezes his hand tightly before releasing it, only to retrieve the ice and feed a few more chips to Sherlock. He accepts them gratefully, his throat feeling less ragged and his lips more mobile. He allows his eyes to close briefly in relief when John takes his hand again, fingers linked once more. "I jumped because there were snipers aiming at you, snipers who would only stop if I were seen to die." A deep breath, a squeeze of hand. "With Mary, I needed you to find out in a controlled manner, so that you could see that she wasn't trying to kill me. So that you will forgive her and go back."
"I'm ok, Sherlock. Thanks, erm," John flushes with embarrassment but battles on, determined to finish. "Thanks for being here." He is relieved beyond measure when Sherlock doesn't move away, merely loosens his hold against John's chest.
Sherlock is propped up in a hospital bed wearing a pyjama top and a jumper, John knows that hidden underneath the many hospital sheets and blankets Sherlock has on pyjama bottoms and that his long feet are encased in thick socks.
The touch of weak, warm sunlight on his bare shoulder is what eventually pulls John out of his deep sleep. He grins up at the ceiling as memories of earlier flood over him. He had waited so long to feel Sherlock against him, to kiss him, to hold him and it had been even better than he had ever imagined it could be; was still being even better. He looks down at the dishevelled mop of curls resting on his chest; Sherlock's face is angled away leaving John with the view of his nape and a long, lithe body, now mostly swathed in covers. Against that pale neck rests a single lock of hair; it has curled into a loose loop and the sight of it makes John's fingers twitch. He resists for a moment before remembering that he is allowed to do this now, he is allowed to run his fingers through Sherlock's hair, to embrace his body. Slowly, he moves his hand up until his fingers are almost resting on Sherlock's neck. Releasing a long breath he trails his fingertips over the shape of the curl, savouring its softness and the warm dampness of the skin beneath. At his touch, Sherlock begins to stir, nothing more telling than a change in breathing and a slight tightening of the arm that rests across John's torso. John knows that Sherlock is giving him time to adjust to their new situation; he also knows that no time is needed. Resting his hand more firmly against Sherlock's neck, John buries his face into Sherlock's hair, breathing in its rich scent before pressing firm kisses in amongst the curls. Sighing, he pulls back and absent-mindedly rubs his thumb over Sherlock's neck. Sherlock stretches languidly and moves to position his face next to John's on the soft pillow.
John states, strangely accusatory.
When the waiter comes over, John lets Sherlock order for him, the richness of Sherlock's voice caressing John's ears.
"Yeah. Of course. Of course I did Sherlock. Did you honestly not realise that?"
What one word leapt out at you?”
John feels a smile crinkle his lips as a small frown forms on the bridge of Sherlock's nose.
"So you consider yourself to be good then? At kissing?" Curiosity is rife on John's features. They'd kissed a few times, but by necessity the kisses had been chaste and short lived. The idea of sharing his experience with John in this area makes Sherlock's mouth water and he swallows against the sudden rush. He doesn't miss the way John's eyes are drawn to his throat and he tilts his head to the side, noting the way John licks his lips at the sight.
"But, only an idiot argues with his doctor."  Sherlock's voice was somehow deeper, warmer, the intimacy of it sending a tremor of longing through John. He exhaled shakily against Sherlock's finger before slowly opening his eyes. He expected to be greeted by empty eyes, perhaps an amused smirk. What he actually saw took his breath away, more effectively than a direct hit to the solar plexus. Sherlock's eyes were bright and clear.  Blue, green and gold blazing out, meeting John's gaze and holding it. Those eyes held so many raging emotions that John was unable to read them all but he could see that the dominant one was happiness, its presence making Sherlock's eyes almost incandescent. John had no idea what had brought Sherlock such sudden happiness but he hoped to see that joy more often. Sherlock's tired face was transformed and to John's befuddled mind he looked almost angelic, but the most sinfully handsome one he had ever seen. Slowly Sherlock began to lower his finger and John fought the urge to bring it back to his mouth, to kiss the tip before taking it into his mouth, laving it with his tongue and gently sucking.
“Hers; she’s a persistent old dear.”  A small smile accompanies Greg’s words. “Wouldn't stop badgering us until we agreed to set her up with a method of contacting us covertly.  Mycroft’s team designed and produced little devices that could be easily activated and notify us the moment that Mary made contact.” Greg explains, his whole posture radiating deep respect for the old lady.
Nodding his acceptance, John found himself pulled even tighter against Sherlock's body as they moved through the simple steps of the waltz, his mind barely registering the moves and turns, too busy with  the intimate proximity of Sherlock. John could feel the strength of Sherlock's arm now wrapped tightly around his waist, keeping them flush together, its firm pressure unrelenting. Long fingers clenched into his shirt, the heat from Sherlock's skin burning into John, leaving its mark indelibly in John's mind. He could feel the flexing of long, lean thigh muscles as he was manoeuvred through the steps, each rhythmic sensation sending another jolt of pure pleasure through his body. He was aware of his burgeoning arousal pressed firmly against Sherlock's thigh. He was becoming light headed, reckless, but still he could not pull himself away, instead wrapping his arm tighter around Sherlock, using his splayed hand to pull them impossibly closer together. A broken gasp escaped his lips when he saw Sherlock's eyes widen in surprise, their improbable colour a bright narrow ring around dilated pupils. A small shift of Sherlock's hips made him fully aware of Sherlock's own arousal, his erection pressed hotly against John's stomach. Licking his lips, John raised his chin, gaze never leaving Sherlock's face, noticing the full lips tremble slightly in anticipation, the delicate eyelids fluttering shut as Sherlock slowly, slowly lowered his face towards John's.
"Because, brother dear, it wasn't that long ago that you considered DI Lestrade one of the few people worthy of risking your own life to protect." Mycroft meets Sherlock's even glare. "And, more relevantly here, his team are investigating who shot you. It will be easier to, shall we say, sidetrack the investigation if we have him on our side."
The man trails off at the look in John’s eye, unwilling to get in another physical altercation with the good doctor, even an obviously weakened one.
"How long did you stay there? What did you see?" Sherlock knew he should be able to deduce precisely what John had seen but his body was now in full control, his brain only along for the ride. Blood was rushing to the surface of his skin, warming his cheeks, invigorating his nerve endings, making his cock swell with urgency and desperate need.
"Oh yes, it means that I get to taste you tonight." The words are bold but a flush plays over Sherlock's high cheekbones. “All of you.”
"Memories. Memories and regrets John." Sherlock's voice was steadier than he had expected it to be and he silently congratulated himself on his control and acting.
You'll always be
Sherlock gently removed John's hand from his cock and gracefully lowered himself into a kneeling position, all the time tracing kisses and licks down John's body. He took time to take each nipple in his mouth, nipping them gently with strong teeth before flicking at them with the tip of his tongue, finally sucking gently. Each gasp and groan that John gave just drove Sherlock on further, desiring nothing more than to give his new lover deep, intense pleasure. One day he would catalogue each response in his mind palace but for now he was running on pure instinct.
"Tea, tablet, biscuits." John states again, savouring the taste of his own tea.
It’s Christmas.”
With practised moves they get John dried and dressed and situated on his bed before Sherlock’s heart has even started to beat normally again.
Three days earlier - Baker Street
The sound of the doorbell interrupts their kiss and they part with extreme reluctance. John grudgingly decides to save Mrs Hudson the journey and runs down the stairs in his stockinged feet, virtually wrenching the door open in his eagerness to retrieve their food and get back to Sherlock. He takes their order, giving the delivery kid several ten pounds notes; more than enough to cover their order, its delivery and a huge tip. He looks up at John with shocked eyes at the cash; before he is able to sort out any change the front door is shut so swiftly that the door-knocker jangles and the kid wisely decides to leave Doctor Watson and Sherlock Holmes to whatever case has made the good doctor so absent-minded.
“Is not here and not likely to be here any time soon.  My people have doctored all of the cameras around Baker Street, nothing but peace and quiet is on show there. No-one followed us from your house, my people have ensured that too. You are all on your own, Sherlock Holmes, and you will die all on your own; when I deem the time to be right. But first
Or me, come to that.”
"No. I honestly had no clue. I met her at the clinic about 9 months before Sherlock returned; one of our nurses had left and Mary was hired to replace her. She was efficient and friendly, the patients and staff adored her and, over time, we built up a friendship that turned into more. I know Sherlock believes I chose her because on some level I knew what she was really like, but I just can't see that. If I had known her for what she truly was I never would have allowed her to be employed at the clinic, let alone go on to have a relationship with her."
“Yeah, it’s been great.  Very refreshing.”  He takes a deep breath before continuing.  “We’ve got a lot to tell you…” He breaks off when Sherlock comes out of the bathroom, pressing an affectionate kiss to John’s cheek before moving the spare chair closer, sliding his arm over John’s shoulders and smiling at Mrs Hudson.
“Oh god.” The words are barely a murmur, John’s gaze continues to travel over what seems like acres of porcelain skin. He adores the fact that it is not a bare canvas but rather dabbed here and there in hues of honey and chocolate, freckles gathering in little clusters or streaking paths across smooth skin. Here and there darker marks daub his skin, in days gone by these would have been called beauty-marks and John wholeheartedly agrees. His eyes are reluctantly drawn to the bandage that still rests on Sherlock’s chest and with gentle fingers he draws the bandage away. The injury still stands red but is no longer angry, well on its way to being just another scar that tells the history of the brave man who stands before him. John allows himself a moment to mourn the fact that people had treated the canvas before him poorly, his own wife tearing a hole in it and unknown entities apparently trying to rip the skin of Sherlock’s back into shreds.
John’s mind drifts back to his most recent dream and he can still feel the sensation of Sherlock against his skin, taste him against his lips.
John takes a deep breath and licks his lips, once more linking their hands.  “I think we should find somewhere to sit and talk.  If therapy has taught me anything it is the importance of clear communication.”
“She gave you a chance? Showed remorse?” The same pleading tone is there and it hurts Sherlock to the core. “Tell me the truth.”
Sherlock moans and rocks against John, his hand returning to John’s hair, pulling lightly as his other hand slides down John’s side, pausing at the edge of John’s jeans.
"So, what you're trying to say, Anderson." John queries. "Is that you illegally filmed these weird little meetings of yours and no-one was aware? No-one at all?"
"Mycroft? What on earth has Mycroft to do with all this?" John's face was scrunched up in confusion.
The door opens and a billow of steam marks Sherlock's exit.
“We’re going back to our room.  Now.”  Sherlock tugs on John’s arm, walking them at a brisk rate to the lift.
Anderson sidles around the desk and squints at the picture, brows furrowed. "I think she said her name was Helen .... Helena? Something along those lines anyway. She came fairly often at the start, not regularly enough to make the list but, well .." Anderson scratches at his beard and something akin to embarrassment colours his sallow cheeks. "I thought she was quite attractive so I noticed her straight away."
“I’ll make sure he looks after himself, both here and at home.”
It’s posed as a question but it is clear that Sherlock has no choice in the matter.
“Could be a mistress?”  John suggests half-heartedly.  “He’s using the meeting as an opportunity to have a dirty weekend?”
Knowing is owning.”
“You’ll at least need to feign some sort of reconciliation, John.
“At least let me make you a nice cup of tea and patch you up the best I can.”  She smiles confidentially. “If you wait another thirty minutes or so there'll be some nice mince pies fresh out of the oven.  I’m making them for my boys, the mix is all made I just need spoon it in to the pastry cases and then pop them on to cook. I’ll do that after I’ve seen to those cuts and put the kettle on.”
What do you mean 'even you'? Are you trying to insinuate something? -SH
"Maybe the information he provides us with today will be enough to start putting him back in your good books."
“Well it is very nice.”  John insists, coming to stand beside him.  “As is this view.  I’d even go so far as to say beautiful, in fact.”  Sherlock looks over at John, just as John looks away.  John takes a step closer to Sherlock, sliding his arm around his waist; the sensation is dulled by Sherlock’s coat but he can’t resist leaning in to the embrace.
“No, the very mediocrity of him would make him stand out.”  Sherlock insists, leaning closer to John.  “He is here with his wife.  Who brings their wife to an important meeting?”
Sherlock was curled up on his chair, long arms tightly clasped around his bent legs, bare feet digging into the soft leather, his gaze directed at the fire but his focus elsewhere, thinking of the moment hours ago - or was it days? It was all such a blurred haze now - when he had been so close to having everything he had ever wanted. Everything.  His arms felt empty, his body hollow, his heart shattered. For what seemed like the millionth time, Sherlock forced himself to relive his earlier encounter with John.
"I'd... wow, I'd really love that Sherlock."  When Sherlock looks up, the brightness of John's open smile is almost blinding.  "Are you sure, though? You're still healing.  I wouldn't want to whack you whilst I slept or something. I can fidget quite badly and you still need your rest." John's smile begins to fade as he thinks about how he could unwittingly hurt Sherlock.
John laughs, surprised at the playful flirting, but receptive nonetheless.  “To eat.”
“Sher-lock.” The syllables of his name are elongated, almost sung, the sound taunting in its indifference.  She doesn’t really care whether Sherlock responds to her or not but it alleviates the boredom of waiting.  She knows that she should at least pretend to appear to be concerned about the man in the bed but she simply can't find the energy to maintain the facade of good, concerned,
"Oh yes. Caused by finally talking about things that should have been said years ago. Random feelings and ideas will continue to pour out of the infected until all possible connotations of thoughts and emotions have been shared." John's shoulders are shaking as he fights to hold his laughter back, tears threaten to spill down his cheeks. Sherlock says nothing but knows that not all of those tears are ones of mirth.
“Physical contact is widely deemed advisable during recovery and has many proven links to speed of recovery.”
Sherlock's focus is fixed on Angelo, but he is rubbing absent-mindedly at his right arm again; John realises that he has seen Sherlock massaging at his arm at various points throughout their time at the cafe.  (And you've never wanted to find him?)
Sherlock stands and starts to head out of the room, pausing when John flaps a hand at him to stop.
facing him on my own!" He sorts through the chest of drawers, quickly locating pyjamas for the both of them, throwing Sherlock's over to him, before pulling on his own. "Put those on whilst I go and let our visitor in."
The sound of the bell and Mrs Hudson's warm voice pulls John out of his daydream and down the stairs.  He enters the living room to find Phillip Anderson looking about him awkwardly, obviously very unsure what to do with himself.  Mrs Hudson is bustling about in the kitchen and Sherlock stands by the fireplace, one arm resting along the mantle piece, eyes narrowed at Anderson, taking in every element of his clothing, posture and goodness knows what else.  John's eyes are drawn to the thick folder that is tucked under Anderson's arm. Its contents could affect the rest of his life.
Sherlock remains awake only a few minutes longer, making a start at cataloguing all of the new experiences today has brought. When John's phone pings with an incoming message an hour later neither man even so much as twitches. For long seconds the screen stays brightly lit, a single name upon it.
"John dear, are you all right?"
“Still bloody suspicious if you ask me.”
"Sherlock, I......." His words are taken from his mouth as soft, full, lips cover his own, their touch sublime. John angles his body to deepen the kiss, turning so that their chests are almost touching, bare skin to bare skin. The kiss is slow and deep, each sweep of Sherlock's tongue against his, making John feel euphoric. It seems amazing that he has survived all this time without the touch of this man against him. He feels Sherlock shift and moans in discontent when the kiss breaks, leaning forward, trying to recapture it.
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak but his mouth is caked with a sticky residue and his lips parched, almost to the point of cracking. The only noise that emerges is more a croak, which then merges into a distinct sound of discontent when John wriggles his hand out of Sherlock's clutches and stands.
“Not any more,” John grins and moves the visitors’ chair to the side of Sherlock’s bed, his smile now gently teasing, “you’ve been a bit of a sleeping beauty.
"Ok." John takes a deep breath to face the task ahead. Slowly his hands stop trembling and his heart adopts a more sedate rhythm; he can do this. "I want you sitting up first, right side turned towards me, in fact, let's move this closer to the fire, help retain body heat."
“He’s sending a car, so let’s grab a taxi.”
“Just don’t take too long.”
If I ever get the nerve to say "Hello" in this cafe
“Perhaps it’s too late for that.”
"He's useless at reading my emotions, yeah, but he knows he's my best friend. Well he does now.  Can't believe he didn't know that." Mary could see the distant look in John's eyes, the fondness that was apparent whenever he thought of Sherlock. She knew that she was doing the right thing.  No matter how hard it felt in the short term, she knew that what she was about to say would change everyone's lives forever.
“Yes, that’s us.”  John responds, still smiling easily.  He has to release his hold on Sherlock to accept the keycards as they are handed to him.  Sherlock quickly analyses the situation and moves to take his luggage from John, leaving John with a free hand and room for their keycards in the hand with his own luggage.  Sherlock seizes the opportunity and quickly links their free hands together, hitching on an innocent smile when John looks up at him.
“We’re partners, John.”  Sherlock looks sad, his words lacking their previous vigour and John realises his gentle teasing has gone completely over Sherlock’s head, as it often does nowadays.
“I didn't do it for you!” Sherlock spits. “I didn't think it would be conducive to John’s healing.”
Sherlock chuckles lightly, his laugh turning more genuine as John joins in.
“What a beautiful…”  Sherlock flicks his eyes quickly towards John, taking heart from his encouraging nod and smile.  “Princess Fairy Bee!’
"Truthfully?"  John nods. "Truthfully, I don't know.  I stopped deducing her when I saw how much she meant to you.  I didn't want to potentially ruin your life again so I stepped away, became the friend I should have been rather than the jealous hopeful lover I'd been acting like before."  Sherlock takes a deep breath and forces himself to say the next part. "For what it's worth, John, I think you became more than just a job to her.  There were moments, obvious to even me, when her affection for you shone through."
"Condom?"
“A walk around the grounds would be nice.”  He finally concedes, returning John’s smile.
Marry me
“God, you're so gorgeous. Intelligence, power and beauty. Perfect, bloody perfect” John's whispered words are heartfelt, pouring out of him without his permission, intense despite their lack of volume.
And marry me
“Probably stop talking now.”
"Wasn't cuddling. I was cold." Sherlock pouts. "I was making use of the nearest heat source, that just so happened to be you."
Sherlock keeps his focus on Rosie, trying to ignore the little stab of emotional pain he gets whenever Mrs. Hudson implies that Rosie is his.  She isn’t, she never has been, and it is nigh on impossible that she ever will be.  He comforts himself with the fact that John feels that he is helping him to raise her and that allows him to continue with his animal noises without a hitch.
"What? What do you mean there is no baby?" Sherlock is up and out of his chair before he has even finished speaking, leaning over John.
"Set a place for yourself too, Mrs H."
his life, except the wife was very much an ex now.
“Later.”  John says again, allowing some of the want that he is feeling to show clear on his face and in his voice, a slow smile curling his lips at the sight of the flush high on Sherlock’s cheekbones.
'If time is all I have
The moment the door opens onto the foyer the other couple leave,  Sherlock takes a moment to ensure they are alone before sliding his arm around John’s waist, setting the pace of their slow walk.  A pace that is perfect for intimate conversation, leaning down Sherlock positions his lips so that they just brush John’s ear.
"Why wasn't your heart free to be hers?" The words are whispered, the hope too fragile to be spoken too loudly.
I’m guessing Mycroft has his goons squirrelled away somewhere nearby?”
Not so much fun waiting, is it John? - SH
“John, can I…”
“Key, we need a key.”
John has once more kissed his way down Sherlock's body and his mouth now hovers above Sherlock's achingly erect penis.  Each breath across his sensitive skin is causing Sherlock to twitch and he is almost sobbing in his need for John.
Everything is.
"At this point I need to climax, but I won't let myself. I slow my stroking, grip the base of my penis with my other hand and will myself to last. When I regain control I let myself think of you again, desperate and wanting; wanting me, wanting my touch. In my fantasy I sink to my knees and tug your shirt free; the sensation of the material sliding against your skin gives you goosebumps and your cock twitches through the material beneath my palm."
Wincing, Sherlock lowered his head onto his knees. When would he ever learn to keep his mouth closed?
John works hard to meet Sherlock’s gaze, to keep his expression and stance open and welcoming. Slowly, as if any sudden movement would shatter the moment, Sherlock raises his right hand and carefully cups John’s face.
"Some of that is very easily done. We can annul the wedding immediately if you wish; it will be as if it never existed. She married you under a false name without your knowledge. Unfortunately, we need to be playing the rather longer game here. I need you to act as if you forgive her; we need to draw out her contacts and colleagues. She has still been active during your relationship and I'm afraid I find the timing of her relationship with you to be highly suspicious."
"Let's get this food up to that man of yours, shall we?" She gives John's hand one final squeeze before rising from her seat and bustling about preparing a tray to take upstairs. John feels a slow smile emerging on his face as he allows the words 'that man of yours,' to sink in. No more denials are needed within the confines of 221B Baker Street and John feels like some of the weight from his shoulders has been lifted.
Eventually the kisses become shallower, less all encompassing until finally little pauses start to appear between each kiss.
slides his shirt on, quickly undoing his belt and the fly buttons, of course, it is at that moment that someone decides to disturb his peace.
John lifts himself up on his hands slightly to drop a sweet kiss to the end of Sherlock's nose.  "You have the most adorable nose. I love seeing the sweep of it in profile, curved, just like those luscious lips of yours.  Do you know how many times I've dreamed about your mouth Sherlock? Hmmm?"  John allows his gaze to linger on Sherlock's mouth, groaning when Sherlock deliberately pulls his lower lip into his mouth before letting it slide back out, now glistening wet.  "The way it peaks and curves, such a sensual mouth; soft and inviting to look at and a wonder to kiss.  I never thought I'd be able to do that, never thought you'd let me."  John drifts a light kiss onto the lips before him, nuzzling soft kisses to either side of Sherlock's mouth.  He runs his tongue first over the top lip, then over the lower, moving slightly away whenever Sherlock tries to deepen the kiss.
John nods his head, flicking the television on with the remote control at his bedside. “Me too, Sherlock.
“Fear is wisdom in the face of danger, it is nothing to be ashamed of.”  Sherlock grits out, his head spinning.
Sherlock lingers over the small, barely-there cleft on John’s chin before drifting down to suck at the delicate skin of John’s neck, bringing the blood to the surface, creating a deep pink blush on the tender skin. Sherlock continues kissing his way down John’s body, loving the way that John moans, gasps and writhes under his ministrations; he spends long minutes teasing John’s surprisingly sensitive nipples, licking and nipping lightly at them, encouraging them to form hard buds that he either torments with greedy lips or pleasures with eager fingertips.
"You saved me from my inner demons last night, it seemed that the least I could do was save you from a sore shoulder."
Sherlock angles his body slightly to put his wash bag back in the small cupboard causing John to catch sight of long silvery scars on Sherlock’s back.
What other things? Your wedding is only a few months away, this should be at the top of your priority list! - SH
"Raise your elbows until they are at shoulder height. Yours John, not mine.  No chicken impressions needed." His breath caught in his throat as he felt the low chuckle John gave travelling through his finger tips. The gentle tingle continued throughout his body, raising a gentle blush onto his cheeks.
“It’s a pointless exercise.”  Sherlock insists, his awareness, as ever tuned in to how close he is to John, suppressing a sigh of disappointment when John stands.
John fishes around the deep pockets of Sherlock's dressing gown, thumbing the phone into life. His brows furrow when he sees that he has a message, a quick click gets him into the menu and his stomach lurches when he sees the name of the sender- Mary.
How can I know someone, if I don’t even know their name?”
“She’s gone a bit - freelance now.
“It’s understandable, John.” Sherlock stands, far more gracefully than John could ever hope to manage, giving the knees of his trousers a quick brush down before standing fully upright.  “You’re still doing locum GP work regularly, you’re working cases with me more and more frequently,  you attend your therapy sessions almost without fail and then there’s Rosie.”
"Then I'll put it back on at that point!" His thigh flexes under Sherlock's hand.
Marry Me by Train
John can find no words to express the euphoria he is currently swimming in but he'd happily let himself drown if only Sherlock would carry on performing whatever magic he is obviously doing. He nods and moves to untuck Sherlock’s shirt from his, quite frankly, sinful breeches.
“That’s it?  A quick peck and you’re off?”  Sherlock states incredulously, moving to block her exit.
“I thought you’d be further along in your recovery.”
Gethin smiles at John, the tension leaving his body, then turns his smile and attention to Sherlock.
Sherlock is the ‘Mr Holmes’ that is being referred to, the realisation makes him physically start and he can see Sherlock move instinctively towards him.
"Well I'll be damned, that obnoxious arse knows something after all!" John interrupts, stunned that it was Anderson, of all people, that worked out that Sherlock was alive. "And the crimes being solved, they were you?"
"I was still very self-centred then, much more than I am now and I took the loss personally. I felt like I had lost both Michael and Mycroft that day, and shortly after I lost myself. My time at university was ...... challenging. ... Friendships were hard, relationships disastrous and my mind was a constant whir of facts, figures and observations. I needed to escape; to escape the world and to escape myself. Hence the drugs. And they helped, or at least, I believed they did. Somehow I managed to scrape through my degree but it was even worse after and I purposely mixed with the wrong people, envying the dangerous life they appeared to lead. I lost track of the number of times Mycroft pulled me out of some hell-hole and put me in rehab before I finally realised I was destroying my mind as well as my future. That time the rehab worked."
"You're supposed to 'protect and serve', then protect and serve him!"
He's so lost in his observation of John's ejaculate that he doesn't hear John re-enter the room and jolts at the touch of a warm, wet cloth against the skin of his stomach.
"You mustn't be worried about me, John. I'd been called freak numerous times by then and as much as I enjoyed kissing him, I didn't lament his loss. Plus, I'd discovered that I loved kissing, it opened up a rather interesting part of my education."
Hesitantly, John reaches towards Sherlock, pulling his hand back only millimetres before making contact with the glossy curls of Sherlock’s hair.  Instead, he directs the movement so that his hand rests on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “You know I forgave you for that.”  Sherlock looks up, sadness in his eyes.  “Ages ago.”  John gives in to temptation, allowing his hand to briefly stroke Sherlock’s cheek, surprised as Sherlock’s eyes briefly widen at the contact.  “It’s time you forgave yourself.”
Carefully, Sherlock moves from his bed, absently noting how much better he feels from letting his body relax when it needs to, and pours John a glass of water from their shared jug, placing it in readiness on John’s bedside unit.
“Sherlock. Can you stay?” John unknowingly echoes his earlier request. Sherlock nods and returns to his chair, leaning forward, his linked hands between his knees in an effort to stop him reaching out for John.
, Sherlock. You better hurry up and recover; that was one seriously hot fantasy and I'd love for you to make good on every word of it!" John tilts his head back and covers his face with his hands, huffing out a breathy laugh. He runs his hands over his face several times before finally looking back at Sherlock. Sherlock meets his intense gaze, feeling somewhat unsure as to what happens now. John is still visibly aroused, the evidence clear, even through the thick denim. Sherlock isn't exactly
Sherlock admits, his eyes downcast.
"Yes, they are Sherlock." John quickly slapped Sherlock's questing hand away from the stitches.  "It will heal more quickly if you leave it alone. I'll check how it's doing again in the morning, so until then, leave it alone!"
"Where's your wedding ring?" Sherlock questions. It's obvious that John has taken it off at some point during the day but Sherlock needs for John to tell him why.
"I know, but that was just something
Sherlock took a final glance around the rooms at 221B, the leaden weight in his stomach somehow making his usually graceful movements heavy. He knew outwardly he looked in control, composed even, his demeanour icy. Only Mycroft or John knew him well enough to know that it was all just an act, that inside he was disintegrating, his carefully built walls refusing to stay intact.
There’s nothing to fear here, nothing to overwhelm him in the wrong way; it’s just the two of them, as it always should be.
"Oh, I'm sure if the right person were to shower with me, or even give me a bed bath, I would find plenty about that experience to enjoy. Plus, John, you were always saying we needed to be more aware of the environment; by sharing our showers we'd be saving water too." He smiles cheekily at John before purposely turning his back and walking to the wardrobe. He can feel John watching intently as he moves and fights the temptation to show off, instead walking steadily forward, watching John's reflection in the mirror.  He can see the flush in his cheeks and the way he licks his lips.  Who knew that walking and water conservation would be the way to John's heart? Or more accurately, John's cock, Sherlock thinks, swallowing back a snigger.
Peppering kisses over Sherlock's taut stomach, John relishes the way it twitches beneath his lips, the way Sherlock's hips push up towards him. John dips his tongue into the hollow of Sherlock's belly button, smiling against Sherlock's skin when he jerks in surprise, filing the information away for later. He sweeps kisses between the curves of Sherlock's hip bones, along the waistline of his pyjamas, pulling at the ties with his teeth, eliciting a deep chuckle from Sherlock.
You can't get your pet detective or Big Brother to bully their way into my files.”
"Nonsense John. You're just over thinking it." Sherlock noticed that John was now moving automatically, his focus on Sherlock's face as they talked.
It still takes another moment for John to register what Sherlock is requesting but the moment he does must be clearly apparent on his face as Sherlock pulls him into deep embrace, pressing his face into John's neck. "You're sure, John?"
Sherlock awoke the next morning to the smell of toast and fresh tea, the scent immediately making him think of John. Getting up from bed Sherlock quickly wrapped his white sheet round his naked body and went to investigate.  John had said he would be out all night, Sherlock knew that John had been hopeful of being laid and he had deduced that John was likely to achieve that hope. He had dressed with care the previous night, the red shirt that brought out the warm tones of his honeyed skin, snug blue jeans that accentuated his still muscular thighs and arse and he had shaved with particular care before leaving, no stubble burn for this latest woman. Another unknown entity that Sherlock had either never known about or had deleted quickly, another woman to take John away.
"Now what, Doctor?" Laughter still plays around the edges of Sherlock's words and John smiles at the sudden ease of it all.
“As did the banker!”  Their laughter continues as they resume their walk, hands remaining linked.
Perhaps I could put the chair back in your living room, seeing as Doctor Watson will be returning to Baker Street soon.”
John's gentle voice broke through her reverie. Tilting her face up to look at him she saw again the tired, sad man she had grown to care for deeply, so deeply that she knew she had to be the one to make this change.  She had to make a clean break in their relationship; she knew his heart was elsewhere.  She had known, if she were honest with herself, the moment that John had finally accepted Sherlock was alive, not just another figment of his imagination. Not just a fleeting spectre that would melt away the moment his hands made contact. She had realised long before John that the reason he kept attacking Sherlock was simply to ensure he was actually there, a form of skin-on-skin contact, not an ethereal being sent to haunt his waking hours in addition to plaguing his sleeping ones.
"Mycroft." Sherlock stepped back from the door, allowing his brother access to the flat.  "I told you previously that your presence is unnecessary here.  Whatever more you have to say I'm not interested." Sherlock's face was once again devoid of any softer emotions, blue eyes almost supernaturally pale and icy, his features harsh.
“Really?”  For the second time in as many minutes Sherlock is shocked.
John gave a slow shrug, his glass moving in lazy circles. "I know. Then after she was out of the first lot of surgery, it was just a blur of intensive care and more surgery. I nearly lost her. Finally, they were able to stabilise her and I was able to think straight for a few moments. That's when I checked my phone and saw that text from you. Christ, Sherlock, I thought you'd done something stupid." Sherlock saw the pain etched on John's face, some for Mary but most due to Sherlock's past actions. He could see the glimmer of tears threatening to spill, even as John studied his own face, searching for what, Sherlock didn't know. Slowly, John reached over to take Sherlock's hand, sliding his fingers up to Sherlock's wrist until he had two resting on Sherlock's pulse point.  Sherlock knew John was seeking proof that he was living and breathing, wanted to feel the reassuring pound of life-blood beneath his fingertips.  The touch was far from medical, the brush of John's skin against his sensitive wrist was enough to make Sherlock's pulse jump.  "I thought I'd lost you again Sherlock." John's voice was little more than a broken whisper.  "And I couldn't have lived through that.  Not again."
Author's Note:  Another wonderful bit of editing by the amazing LockedinJohnlock! We're almost there!
Sherlock leans over their bath and turns the tap on.  He debates over adding some bubble bath but knows that John will protest at the possibility that Sherlock's wound may become irritated.
He is still standing, lost in his thoughts in the doorway, when a gentle hand pats his upper arm.
"Sentiment isn't a bad thing, Mycroft. It gives us the strength to do what we must, even when we're afraid. The courage to remain strong when we're needed." John squeezes Sherlock's hand, smiling softly at him before turning his attention back to Mycroft. "And the desire to do all that we can to avert little brothers' destructive impulses. And the dedication to picking up the pieces when those impulses shatter the person we care about."
John jokes as he wipes Sherlock clean, throwing the flannel in the general direction of the bathroom. “Get under the covers, I think we’ve both earned a good night’s sleep.”
"Comfortable here." Comes the sullen answer and Sherlock tries to worm further onto John. A sharp gasp and the sudden contraction of muscles sharply halts Sherlock's wriggling.
He subliminally registers the conversation being conducted in urgent whispers by the door, can feel the tendrils of worry that Lestrade is exuding.
“God no, Sherlock.”  All of sudden John is sitting up, his face serious, his attention fixed solely on Sherlock.  “You haven’t led me on.  You have a right to say no, to call a halt to things, at any point.  As can I.  If we never go any further than this, I’ll be happy.  If we never go this far again, I’ll still be happy.”
Sherlock dips his head in agreement, his eyes fixed on yet another unappealing hospital meal.
"Is that so, John?" John can hear the smirk in Sherlock's voice and it's only as he's drifting off to sleep that he realises that his words could be taken in quite a different way to how he'd meant them. A half smile on his lips, John finally gives in and sleeps.
John moved his hand in a firm caress down to Sherlock's bare chest, feeling the firmness of his muscles and the pounding of his heart. Glancing down he could see the way the sheet tented over Sherlock's erection and he knew that telling Sherlock what he had seen and how he felt had been the right decision.  He had danced around his attraction to Sherlock for too long, now he needed to be honest. One of Sherlock's hands was hanging loose at his side, the other still gripped the sheet.  Sherlock's mouth was now partly open, his lips shining where his tongue had licked across them during John's confession. His eyes were dark, pupils huge and fixed intently on John, their focus flitting over John but lingering most on his lips then his cock.
her.  Another memory drags itself out.  Mary flushed in their bed, covers tucked demurely over her breasts even though her high colour and tangled hair show clearly what they had been engaging in mere moments before.  John remembers that he had thought her so beautiful; she had been so kind and understanding of the fact that it had taken a while for his brain to engage enough with the act so that his body responded.  She had encouraged him, offered words of support and a persuasive mouth and hand until he had been fully hard.  For a moment he had been able to forget everything he had lost, the opportunities he had missed.  Now, seeing the memory in the cold, harsh light of day John can see that Mary's eyes had been strangely cold, her mouth more a smile of derision than one of joy and her body firmly hidden from his appreciative gaze.
doing it.”  John answers seriously.  “The effect you have on me…..Your voice, your body, the way you look and move.”  He sighs.  “And your intelligence….Christ……You’re just so fucking beautiful and sexy.”
*embarrassed shuffling* so this is where the story really starts to gain its explicit rating.......
"Tomorrow? Yeah, that would be good. I'll try and come earlier."
Meeting John's gaze as they moved, he savoured  the sensation of their bodies moving in time, their rhythmic rising and falling, the strong hands on his skin, the protective arms holding him in their embrace.
John stands rather awkwardly next to Sherlock as Mrs Hudson takes their photo and then frowns down at the screen.
Before John can react to the look so clearly shown on Sherlock's face it is gone, the usual facade back in place. John is almost convinced that he imagined the look, except for the way that Josef is looking between them. Something had almost happened there and Josef had witnessed it. Clenching and releasing his fists in an effort to calm himself, John follows the rapidly disappearing Sherlock along the corridor. Josef walks beside him, but thankfully does not attempt small talk, John is fairly certain that words are currently beyond him.
Gone is the warm reassurance of his conversation with John, Mr Rajkoomar now speaks with the tones of one who expects to be listened to - and obeyed.
Pressing a final kiss to John’s lips, Sherlock gets off the bed; it lacks some of his usual grace but, Sherlock thinks grimacing, that is perfectly understandable given the friction of sticky underwear on delicate skin and the pleasant ache of muscles used in a more athletic manner than his solo sexual adventures usually require.  John’s laughter accompanies Sherlock’s short, and somewhat ungainly, walk to the bathroom.  Sherlock happily accepts John’s laughter, knowing he does make a rather ridiculous figure with his stiff, wide legged shuffle.  He smiles to himself; a
John’s eyes sparkle with barely restrained glee.
Laughing lightly, Mary lowered their joined hands to her lap. "I'm not delirious John, don't worry. I meant I can read how you feel for Sherlock but it seems he can't.  How strange."
