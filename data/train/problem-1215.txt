He took a deep breath, “Please, sir, may I be punished?”, the detective found it hard to not make it sound sarcastic, or to not laugh at himself either.
Sherlock's scream was muffled by the soap, little white bubbles formed around his lips, his eyes had gone wide with surprise at the strength of the blow, “I warn you, boy” John said, straightening up the belt for the next blow, “If that bar falls from that disrespectful mouth of yours, I'm starting all over again”. His tone was dark and heavy in threat, Sherlock believed him without any doubt.
“Sherlock Holmes” the man repeated “I’ve heard about you, you’re considered the best detective in the world” he stated, still looking away “your methods are considered quite peculiar”
“Oh but Sherlock, the news is out!” his brother announced cheerfully, “Your medical chart has been changed, everyone knows you are a submissive, and that you, reckless man, had decided to pretend to be something else for all your life,” he said with a wide smile.
She had always had one simple rule: do not get involved. There was a line between work and love, and even if she cared about her subs, clients, or trainee, she never allowed them to get attached in the unique way of a true relationship.
He had thought about strapping the sub's hands, it had seen appropriately fitting his crime, but Sherlock's knuckles were still wearing the fading signs of the beating the detective had given to that bastard.
John let out a chortle, teasing his skin a long while before letting it fall with a loud crack. Sherlock cried out, losing position for a brief moment, he wheezed, waiting and craving more, quickly returning to expose himself.
John rose his eyebrows, “Mind Palace?” he asked, “Is it like a real palace? With towers and all?” he taunted. Sherlock's eyes narrowed, “Sometimes,” he said, “Depends on what I need.”
The detective glared at him briefly, without bothering to get up from his couch, “Oh so you figured it out, you just needed an hour and 34 minutes, maybe you are not so hopeless after all,” he said with cold sarcasm.
John looked at it frowning, “Sherlock, why is the teapot ringing?” he asked, that was quite a new sentence, he guessed.
The DI had arrived in the apartment after Sherlock hadn't been answering for hours, and he had found the young man lying on the armchair, half chocked in his vomit, with the elastic tourniquet still around his arm.
“That's how you know the rope isn't affecting your circulation too much” John explained, “You can do that to check if you are fine every time you feel it's hurting too much or you feel overwhelmed,” he added, “And I might ask to do that, so you don't need to worry,” he said as he fastened a gag around Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock had fought it a bit, pulling it repeatedly and finally, he had resigned, letting himself fall face down on the floor with a complaining groan. At that John, truly done, had asked him if he really preferred to welcome his brother while kneeling in the corner and with new marks of the belt on his bottom instead and Sherlock immediately, even if not exactly graciously, had obeyed and knelt.
“Greg is fine, thank you for asking, busy to clean out the mess you get yourself into,” he replied casually, “I'll send him your regards” he added smiling. Sherlock was barely able to keep himself from struggling again against his restrain in frustration. This was going to give his brother material to smug about forever.
“I don't see why it should go otherwise,” John answered dryly, something in his tone sent a sparkle down the sub's spine.
“Undress,” John commanded, he was fiddling with the crop in his hands, not even looking at Sherlock as he obeyed.
The sub's skin soon turned of a deep red colour, and his legs were trembling visibly now, but still waiting with conflicted wish the next time the paddle would fall, arching back to position. Greg chuckled deeply as he left the paddle aside.
“Hello?” the young man repeated “Since when do we start a conversation with ‘hello’?” the older man’s smile got wider “I just wanted to make sure you behaved, baby brother” Mycroft said “American authorities, especially the FBI, need some consideration,” the calm voice said “they tend to be–” Mycroft stopped, searching for the right and less offensive word he could say, “prickly”. Sherlock sighed loudly, the older brother ignored him “Remember you are representing your country there” Sherlock frowned “I work as private” the detective remarked, “I’m not representing you, don’t worry”.
The belt fell, again and again, each time Sherlock would try to scream, biting down in the soap instead, he panted and drowned in the disgusting flavor as the surface of the bar went melting from his saliva, Moans tried to climb from his throat.
The Doctor watched his skin turning delightfully pink, warmed by his hand, wobbling at each stroke and tensing as he paused to pet him shortly before returning to hit, he could feel Sherlock's cock growing and pressing with increasing insistence against his thigh.
John had caressed his hair, with regular and slow movement, when suddenly the sub started to talk. As the doctor had guessed, he had returned to the case, Sherlock Holmes the mighty detective was back. He had explained to John the situation, more to reorganize what he knew so far rather than actually share with him his knowledge, talking fast and rumbling often, barely answering John's questions.
Sherlock looked at the plush bee with a frown, it was soft and rounded with two little felt wings, cute stitched eyes, and blushed pink cheeks, “This is hardly a realistic bee” he commented, studying the toy.
John put the plug on the table, Sherlock frowned at how little the object was in reality, it had felt enormous, he thought.
“Open your mouth”, Sherlock obeyed, John's fingers entered his mouth, he licked them, and then he sucked on them, deeply, searching for approval in the doctor's clear eyes.
“So, I would like to offer you a deal that I'm sure it would be beneficial for both,” he said, “I will give you a quite important raise on your paycheck, and in return, as an extra, I would ask you to send me detailed reports on Sherlock's training.”
The doctor, after he had come in Sherlock's mouth, had cuddled him and praised him. They had passed the rest of the afternoon peacefully, the sub had been nuzzling and napping frequently on John's lap, searching constantly for his comfort as if his mind had not still totally surrendered at the idea it was time to come back to reality.
“Good evening, doctor” the sub had greeted him with a smile which maybe wanted to be gentle, but for some reason had turned out to be cold, he invited him to take sit on one of the comfy chairs in front of him.
“I thought you might fancy some real breakfast,” the woman said, “Sherlock always forget to do his groceries” she added with a playful scold.
The sub's pale skin showing was an inebriating scene,  his black collar contrasted delightfully with his neck's colour. He was covering his crotch with his hands, clearly uneasy, still far from subspace, despite his pupils had gone wider at John's words.
As the Dominants started to chat, about those dull things people like to chat about when they still have to know each other better, like their jobs, education, and other rather boring conventional topics, Mycroft observed Sherlock, who was avoiding at all costs his eyes.
He didn't prepare the sub's hole much, he entered him, feeling it tight around him, knowing the painful friction he was certainly lightening inside the sub's hole. Sherlock cried out loudly, he bit the gag down and interlaced his fingers around the rope. John fucked him roughly, making the table shift slightly with his movements, he grabbed Sherlock's curls, forcing the sub against his thighs and down against the table. After a few powerful thrusts, the sub fell, he collapsed on the table, his entire body melted, a puddle of saliva formed beneath his mouth. John at that sight, came inside him, panting loudly, still grabbing Sherlock's soft hair.
“I’m just able to understand how people’s mind work, I see what others see, borrowing their eyes” Will said, smiling weakly.
His neck had slowly bent, his eyes had passed from the wallpaper to the wooden baseboard as if his entire body wanted to become little and miserable as he fantasized to be.
“Oh, have mercy” Sherlock snarled, “You are just happy you were right, you never accepted the idea I was considered more capable to look after myself than you” he spatted, pointing with his eyes to the collar Mycroft was wearing.
When the doctor had entered Sherlock's flat, the detective had given him a short glance, barely moving his eyes from his work and not even minding enough to get up from his armchair.
Without further warning, a sharp hand fell on him, the sound of the flesh was barely muffled by his thin trousers, it resonated on the flat. Sherlock let a humph out from the surprise. The pain was barely there, warm and quickly fading.
John knew that he couldn't really demand Sherlock's mind to focus on his punishment for a long time and to forget the case, so he had to pick something effective and quick but still intense.
Irene had been his mentor. When he had returned broken from Iraq, he had decided to try to help others at least, wasn't that the reason he had wanted to be a doctor in the first place?
“Where is your dear owner, brother?  Playing to be a detective somewhere? I would never have guessed his leash could extend enough to let you all by yourself” he mocked, smiling cruelly. His words, however, didn't seem to impress his brother, who just walked across the room and sat on the plastic chair next to Sherlock's bed.
“Wait, hang on, what?” the DI questioned, going after him and grabbing his arm to stop him. “How about you sit down for a minute-”
Sherlock, surprised by John's openness, but marking it as an act of hormonal overload, threw him a questioning look. “And what is 'family' in your opinion? Is it really necessary to have blood kin around you? Do people not call their friends their families?”
John smiled a little. “You're pretty. How about I make you an offer?” He waited for Sherlock to look at him, albeit still suspicious. “I take you out of your current life and you stay with me. You can have what you want, education, luxury. My only condition: You're mine. Completely.”
“It appears that at the time of his disappearance, I was in a meeting, discussing certain plans on cooperations or counteractions concerning greater powers and their disputes. I was informed belatedly of the abduction of my brother by an unidentifiable man I have since been having whole teams of experts researching on. To no avail, I'm afraid.” Mycroft spoke smugly, but John could hear the regret in his voice. “I was, by no means, trying to offend you. I suppose you recall my words concerning your reliability and I was merely trying to get you to speak of your reasons to blame yourself in this.”
The Omega quickly drew out of his thoughts, blinked lazily. “I'm just messing with you. I thought you had got that by now.”
Sitting back down, slurping away at their treats, Emilia tried persistently to get into his lap, pushing at his elbow where it rested on his thigh. “Alright, hold on Emmy. Take that out while moving around, you don't want to choke on it.” She popped the popsicle out of her mouth and then climbed onto his leg as soon as he moved his arm away. She leaned back to rest against him and he stabilised her with a hand around her waist. Then the chain reaction set into motion and the four other pups suddenly all wanted to cuddle, too. They made a race of it. Jacob was first to his other side and John chuckled as he quickly climbed onto his leg, his treat in his hand as was expected of him. Rosie, Alex and Kat gently pushed at John from either side, jealous and demanding of the same amount of love. He tried to tell them how to sit so everyone could cuddle up, but doing so with an ice lolly in hand and while being cautious not to knock anyone over only caused him to lose balance. He just managed to break his backward fall by flexing his muscles hard and spontaneously when the three un-cuddled pups saw their chance and quickly wriggled up on his belly, effectively pushing him to the floor after all. They were shifting around, trying to find good positions and John suddenly realised this wasn't as easy as it had been a year ago, when they had all been really tiny and light. Now, someone was pressing a knee into his bladder and a hand came mercilessly down on his chest. He moaned in mild pain and chuckled through it, shifting the toddlers' weights around so he could lay in relative comfort as well, rubbing at the sore flesh of his breast. He needed to take the binder off soon. It had started becoming worse as the pups slowly shifted from his milk to soft, mostly gooey and liquid food. He was still producing like their five lives depended on it, but could only feed once, maybe twice a day with it. The rest he tried to squeeze out in the shower to relieve the pressure, but that was still an unpleasant method. He thought maybe, since this was his first litter after many that he could actually breastfeed, his body was trying to make sure they were codependent of each other. Which was silly, as the pups would be depending of his care for a good number of years now either way, but who knew what biology really did just to keep a family together. He, at least, knew he wouldn't let them go no matter what and could well do without the aching chest. Then again, he didn't want to complain. He'd rather produce milk for the rest of his life than part with this litter prematurely. As the toddlers suckled on their treats, John slowly drifted into sleep.
“This is so humiliating...” he said, covering his face with a hand as he rolled onto his side, calves pressed to his thighs so strongly, his feet covered the dampening seat of his trousers.
Sherlock nodded and pulled John up with him. In their bedroom, John sat up against the headboard of their bed, Sherlock knelt in front of him. They locked eyes with each other and John felt his body starting to shake slightly. Fortunately, Sherlock didn't so much as mention it, even though he had to see it –
John, on the other hand, struck Sherlock as charming, secluded and honest. In short, ordinary. He really surprised him, though, when John showed him how he chose his acquaintances and by what his morals really were.
that through, trying to understand it and it was adorable to see Sherlock Holmes at a loss like this. “Yes.. Yes! Why would you want that? You have been anticipating me fat with your children the moment my heat was over.”
He jerked his head to get those memories off his mind. Finding himself back inside a safe room, big and, incredibly, his own, calmed him, to say the least. He looked down at his swollen belly, gave it a few loving caresses. Say what you want, but John could never not love any of the pups he was carrying, even though they had never been conceived willingly on his part. After a moment, he paused, looking straight ahead, contemplating. May as well try, he figured, pushing himself up with a grunt. The risk was no greater than usual: he was either kept or brought back.
The couple just exchanged amused looks. The man in charge returned to them with their wine and the promised candle, not even the usual tea light, but an actual candle in a cherry red, matching the liquor's colour perfectly. In regard of Sherlock's state, though, John ordered just some water for them and Angelo insisted on them taking the bottle of wine home, then.
“Sherlock? I was wondering if you could.. play the violin for a bit? I just want to see how they react to that kind of music; if it interests them or relaxes them, you know.” John asked one afternoon.
If it wasn't for John's scent.. not the ordinary Alpha-tone, no, John's personal, individual scent, the one he could already barely resist as an Unpresented, the one he'd breathed in as deeply as he could, without being noticed, whenever John was near him. One can't even imagine just what it does to him at the moment – lust-driven, desperate for sexual attention, needing an Alpha he could trust, favourably the one he was deeply emotionally bonded to already, requited or not.
“Yes,” he said with a lot of patience that John admired. He'd put that sock on five times already and judging by the rebellious grin on the girl's face, this wouldn't be the last time that night. “You go and... have sex.” There was some slight irritation both in Sherlock's voice and expression as he put the pup back on her feet.
“I'm not even paid by Scotland Yard!” he bellowed back, being fed up with the mothering Mycroft was always practising on him. Probably his way of dealing with the fact he could never live an omega life, his body's compensation of decades of suppressed hormones.
“Ah, well. I might not look it, but I am also rather perfectly matched. I know the intensity when I feel it. People with no or ordinary relationships don't notice it, but we few, we are so sensitive to it, we can feel it on others. Once the bond really takes, we just know how couples really feel towards each other. You two are giving me reason to worry right now..” she concluded. She directed an inquiring look between the both of them until John spoke up.
He was glad he could have a free mind some nights and take care of his own social life. He was hoping to maybe build a functioning family for his children to grow up in, with opportunities and relaxed parents. He wouldn't be able to without the help from Sherlock.
He looked down at his hands, watch them tremble the little bit they had done constantly for all the time he remembered since Sherlock's disappearance. That wasn't much, during that time he'd mostly run on autopilot and his conscious had kept out of most of it, but what he remembered had a lot of uncontrollable trembling in it; not out of fear, but cold. He'd dealt with enough anorexic patients to hate being able to see it on himself every time he looked at himself. The protruding bones were a telltale sign, of course, but what was an even more serious aspect was the fact he'd grown lanugo hair, the downy hair the human body grew to protect itself against the cold when the amount body fat was too low to do so. It was an old natural mechanism, that had little function anymore, but it showed clearly when a person was sickly thin. It annoyed John to see that on his own meagre arms. Maybe he should get himself tubed up now that he needn't worry about Sherlock as much any longer. He didn't know how much longer his body would be able to keep this up. He'd never been this thin in his life and up to this point, it had been his worry for Sherlock that pumped him up with enough adrenalin to keep him going on low fuel, but he could physically feel himself sagging away. He knew his condition was critical. As a doctor, he knew. As a soldier, he was disappointed in himself.
The corners of John's mouth pulled outwards in his usual demeanour of unamused smiling. Something that had defence and challenge in it and just the tiniest bit of daring. “So, is there something I might be able to help you with?” he asked and Sherlock was sure it was at least partly to distract from his own statement.
John shook his head, protesting a persistent “no, no, no” as he didn't want to think of his mate's situation other than 'alive'. Another slap followed and John merely whimpered, too exhausted to fight. “I haven't eaten in a week, how would I be of any help..”
“Oh, don't I?” There was a flicker in John's eyes and then it began. Sherlock was suddenly seeing what John meant whenever he described Sherlock's deduction-chains. “So close to heat, an OP his age? He would have been sold the first auction he'd have been paraded! He'd have been pregnant before his heat even hit, by some disgusting middle-aged Alpha snob, who'd use him as a sex toy. He's young, still pliant, mind weak. He would have been tortured into being a good little house-omega, doing chores, carrying litter on top of litter around until his underdeveloped legs couldn't carry him any more. And you know what? It wouldn't have brought your sweet Alpha baby back.”
It felt weird, intrusive, but also exciting and promising and as confusing as that was, he enjoyed it just the tiniest bit. He moved up the lanky body a bit so that Sherlock could reach more easily, but they could keep kissing.
John nodded in understanding. “Yeah.. I'm not really a favourite patient to anyone. I'm just glad I got them before my cycle started up again. Don't really fancy a heat right now.” He smiled a little. Sherlock's lip twitched in response.
Breakfast was relatively silent between the two of them. When seeing John not touching a bit of what Mycroft had ensured for him,Sherlock had promised John to eat the equivalent of what he ate by scale. Since Sherlock's hospital meals were rather small, that meant he'd take a bite for every full slice of bread, spoonful of beans or fruit John took. The Alpha, of course, had been against that, but as he saw Sherlock wasn't even taking a sip of his tea, he surrendered and started forcing an apple down. Sherlock in turn bit off his bread, chewing slowly, cautious not to upset his recovering stomach.
He was turned onto his back, pressed down by a hand that, right now, was much stronger than his malnourished, crippled self. He kept begging the Alpha to stop, just the touch of his firm hand against Sherlock's chest was revolting, but the broad man wouldn't have it. He tried kicking and punching and scratching with his unclipped nails, but he couldn't stop his tailored trousers being roughly torn down to his knees, pants following.
“Of course you are.” John's voice sounded lovingly delighted and a small kiss was pressed to the top of his head in greeting and he threw his head back to request more of the affection, but on his lips. It was granted. “You're still in you pyjamas! We wanted to go for a walk, Sherlock!”
“They're in a stage where they're wary of strange adults?” Sherlock sounded like he was quoting something John had said, but the Omega had no memory of ever saying such a thing. He looked at the Alpha with creased eyebrows and a skeptic question on his face. “You don't think
When Sherlock opened his eyes to look at John, he caught his eyes immediately as they were resting on his face with a loving, yet thoughtful air. Reassured they were still okay, he closed his eyes again, enjoying the tension releasing attention his mate was giving him.
John lined up, leaning over Sherlock's quivering form, holding himself up by his hands on either side of Sherlock's shoulders and glared down into the pleading eyes of the most brilliant man falling apart right then and there. He finally pushed in, a fresh wave of sweat, and natural lubricant, broke out on Sherlock, his lungs forgot how to work for a second. There was something in John's eyes as he stared down into the widely opened ones of Sherlock, something Sherlock had never seen or maybe just never noticed as such in John before – maybe it were the hormones sharpening his senses for the Alpha, maybe it was simply an Omega thing.
“You like this!” Sherlock exclaimed as he sensed a current of anticipation run through John and reaching through their bond.
It never seized to fascinate and simultaneously scare John how overwhelmed Sherlock still seemed to be by everything. The pregnancy was one thing, but he figured that for someone who'd been without gender for over thirty years, being pregnant must be one astonishingly alien idea. It was more his reaction to John that was endearing, yet concerning. What must people have told him so that he'd now still have that minimal flinch in his expression whenever John initiated mild touching?, to hold onto and pursue John so longingly whenever he just pecked his lips?, to look so surprised, privileged, lucky when he realised John was going to push him all the way to his orgasm?, or just the very vocal way he confirmed his pleasure as if unable to comprehend it any other way?
It seemed plausible, that one theory, and while John wasn't in any kind an enemy or hater on any religion or church, he wanted brilliant minds like Sherlock to look into it further, determine and declare it the one and only biological explanation, just because it fit their case.
They took a quick glance at the menu, just to order the same as always, just with John commenting “an extra portion for him, though” with a small grin and Angelo seemed seriously overjoyed, contrary to Sherlock, who rolled his eyes.
“I don't.” Sherlock simply replied. “But I have done the past four months and it does seem necessary, regarding our situation.”
John was sitting in the shower, trying to ease a bit of tension out of his aching muscles with the too hot water. It was almost enough to make him stop feeling nauseous. With a quick glance at his mobile, he left the warm embrace and dried himself off, dressed and got ready for work.
As soon as Mycroft left, Sherlock let his hands roam over John's back, pinching the nape of his neck lightly. It was a shame to pull him out of his sleep, especially since he so rarely got to see his resting face. For once in the past month and a half, Sherlock could see John and see him peaceful, the creases on his forehead smooth, his hand still and his lips relaxed. Looking at his mate like this did something to calm his own heart and mind, filled him with such a warmth, it hurt him to know he couldn't get any closer to John. He made his mind rest in silence. Sherlock always wanted that, but never had it felt so safe, so right. “I love you.
Hey, sorry to bother you again, but I have a spontaneous question: would you like me to elaborate on John's kinks a little bit? I mean not only his pregnancy kink because obviously that's going to happen anyway, but what about his feeding kink? Like that like I do? Interested in some kinky sessions? Let me know, please :)
This was their secret, shared with no one but the life growing inside his womb, the product of their eternal bond.
The cry of invaluable bliss. John's semen filling him until he overflew. Blinking his eyes open to John panting into his face. The flame of the most incredible of kisses, the soft adjusting of their positions so Sherlock was laying atop John, weight off of his vulnerable body.
John and Sherlock looked at each other. “Yeah, we'll take the private classes.” said John for the both of them.
The worst thing probably was, that his hunger didn't seem to go away. Usually, he simply wasn't hungry and now he barely fit his trousers any longer – sure, they were slim tailored in the first place, but that was rather the sense behind tailored suits; now, when he buttoned them, the fat on his hip pushed out over the waistband and his tight shirts didn't make it any better.
So, John told the driver to go to NSY instead of Baker Street, which was, fortunately, just round the corner from where they had gotten.
“It wasn't your fault. It was not the first time I have been targeted and it won't have been the last. It's part of what we do, John. It was not your fault.” Sherlock said this as reassuringly as he could. He meant it.
we lose this pup, then we'll try again if you want to and feel ready and if you don't or can't, there's always adoption and- and if this whole 'children-business' isn't what you want after all, that's fine, too! I'm not angry... wouldn't be if you did lose it, okay? I love you.”
John loved him. He loved him on his knees, setting him, the Omega, on a higher position, worshipping him in a way no Alpha would if dealing with less than their perfect match. An Alpha didn't fall to his knees in front of Betas or Omegas. An alpha soldier didn't kneel to anyone but his superiors.
For a few seconds, they stared at one another, waiting for someone intelligent to spoil the answer. Rosie and Emilia even stopped licking for a moment. Then Alex bounced excitedly as the trained response to being done a favour popped back into his mind. Kat followed suit and soon five tiny humans were scrambling up onto wobbly legs. John held their treats while they did a walking practice into the kitchen. When Jacob stumbled, they waited patiently for him to get back up. Feeling like he would be intruding on something quite important, John sat still and merely listened as the stampede came to a halt and five little voices spoke a little too loudly. They thanked Sherlock, and apparently rather generously, as it took a while before one after another, they tumbled back into the living room, taking their ice lollies back from their father. Judging from the noise, they insisted on giving Sherlock a hug each and since his legs were blocked by the table, he likely had to lift them. It was a sweet thought, really. John didn't know why exactly they always insisted on hugging while showing gratitude. Someone at the nursery must have taught them that, intentionally or not. They had always loved physical contact, so it was probably something they'd adapted easily. At least he was sure he hadn't always hugged while saying thanks in front of them. He wasn't bitter, though, he did adore this kind of behaviour and it meant they understood the concept of gratitude, even if they still didn't always have that immediate reaction.
I should probably give a little update: This is going to be reeeeaally slow burn for the Johnlock. More-so than I originally anticipated. I hope y'all still enjoy it and will continue with me down this road of "how much shit can we make them go through?"
“No! No, that is unacceptable, worst of all options presenting themselves. I will not lower myself to that level of humiliation!”
“You want to come, huh?” John huffed into his ear. “You want to spill against this wood, have it dribble down to the pillows? You want to clench around my cock? Make me shove it deep inside you so that my cum can fill you up, bloat your belly only to rush out as soon as I unplug myself from your arse?”
The door was locked. Not for long. He entered and made for the steps that would take him downstairs. Down there, he walked the narrow corridor, gun in hand, kicking the doors open as he came past them. The third one he forced open, a shot went through his heart, as did one through the forehead of the Alpha that had just turned to face him. The other person, the desperate and lost Omega, didn't so much as flinch as the stranger dropped to the floor having recognised his mate upon entering. Sherlock's eyebrows drew together as his face pinched in despair and a whine escaped his throat as he scrambled onto his knees on the dirty, smelly bed and started stretching his body towards the approaching John, almost losing balance and falling over. The doctor encased him in his arms the moment he arrived at Sherlock's side, pressing the thin body against his own as he just breathed him in for a moment. Urine, faeces, sweat, vomit, fear, Sherlock.
, he wanted to say and never could because he simply couldn't fight the intense pain in his abdomen and the intense longing of his backside right now.
When Sherlock had reached the point of finally coming to his senses with the seizures, it only seemed all the more crippling to John because he knew Sherlock was mentally back, but had no control over what his body did yet. The only times John had ever felt that way was when he had presented and when he'd gotten shot. And he hadn't liked either of them. Feeling powerless in the body you have controlled for as long as you've known had scared him and maybe it was his alpha nature that made that experience even worse, but at least he usually had his mind and body working together, unlike Sherlock, who mainly made everything dependant on his brain.
It ended up messy, the liquid dripping from Sherlock's chin and running down John's chest, a short chuckle escaping them both. That was until it fell back to moaning and grunting and currents running through Sherlock's body as John hit his prostate. Again and again.
“That's not really a statement that conveys a lot of trust, Sherlock. Essentially, you're saying that you expect me to fuck up and that, when I do, you'll hit me back.”
“Hm?” Sherlock could only ask dumbly. He had no idea what John was talking about, but he didn't really care. They were here, together, all three of them, on the kitchen floor, cradled against the counter, John's arms around him and his scent giving him that deep contentedness.
“I've known him for about an hour and a half, do you really expect me to fall in love with someone that quickly? I think him and I share that sentiment, by the way. However, he is very intelligent, I would be happy to pay for an extended education. I doubt you will find many Alphas to treat him quite as kindly, not to mention, I doubt you will find one that will actually love him before buying him.”
Looking up with his eyes, he was glad to see John tossing back his head with an unbelievable moan, a hand falling over his face to cover it as if ashamed. Sherlock let him be, making remarks and commenting, questioning, shifting attention wouldn't work in John's favour, it seemed, so he just continued handling three tasks at once, his finger pushing in deeper now. John seemed so overwhelmed by this, it made Sherlock heart swell in adoration for this man. 'Three continents Watson' mewling like a teenager in his first rut as his Omega worked his cock and arse. To Sherlock it was beautiful.
It was fun, really, watching determined and confident John Watson come apart more and more as his pregnancy progressed.
“In two weeks. Regular check-up is all. Maybe some advise on this and that.” mumbled John around his jam, happy to leave the kitsch aside, too.
“Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths?” the question almost sounded like a challenge rather than curiosity. John confirmed. “Bit of trouble, too, I bet.”
Nevertheless, John had better things to do than being cornered in such circumstances. He tilted his head to look around a little as he spoke. “Is there an actual point to this kidnapping or can I go home now? I've got some groceries that need cooling.”
Dr Field considered them for a moment, unconvinced, but it wasn't her job, or right, to push them for answers on their private relationship. “Alright, let's make this quick and painless then, shall we?” She readied her equipment as John rose from the examination bed for Sherlock to lay down on it freely, but he stood by his side, hand resting on the edge over the Omega's head.
“What?” the older man asked in confusion. As usual, Sherlock outwitted him and it was annoying how dim people in positions like this could be.
The way John looked at him gave him more confidence and he forgot the odd circumstances and simply let it grip him, let his spirits free. The frustration of the past months, all of it, he let it guide his form around the living room.
No, he wasn't an emotional person and he felt this hormonal rush was slowly ebbing away, leaving him to return further to his former self, but with the addition of John. John, whom he had loved since the beginning. Whom he had loved and never told until the last moment. John, who loved him back. Did the impossible.
So, here it is (finally). I don't know why exactly, no, that's a lie, but let's pretend it wasn't, but somehow this took ages to find its way into the story..
Sherlock looked back at him blankly, raising a brow. “There's always something bothering me, John. In fact, I think, it's something most people can say of themselves. Take yourself as an example, I can tell there is at least ten things bothering you at the moment and they are all connected to me more or less directly.”
“Hello, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson! Now, I am a little worried here, you registered as an 'emergency'?” Dr. Field said as she entered the room, sitting down in front of them.
“Maybe I should.. and maybe we could have a repeat of last week afterwards...” he sang suggestively.
The Alpha was unimpressed. “Alright, Fuck You. Where's your family? You got a number of Mr or Mrs You in your pocket? Got a phone?” Sherlock didn't reply. The Alpha licked his lips. “Look, I know you probably don't want your parents to know, but I have to get you to a hospital for a detox. Kid your age and shape, I'm lucky you're still alive.”
John blinked at him for a moment, wondering when Sherlock had just raised all his internal walls against him again. It had been ages since he'd last acted
“Don't forget your place, John.” she replied, not turning to him, merely glancing over her shoulder, absolutely dismissive of his dignity.
I'm sorry, it's busy 'round here and I was distracted for most of their heat, so it's probably totally un-hot.. cold.
John had forgotten Sherlock wasn't good with sentiments, especially in his favour. “And... I like them. I hope that doesn't make me sound like a paedophile.” They narrowed their eyes at each other after that statement.
“It does have something irrationally... calming to it.” Sherlock replied, idly palming the sides of his belly.
“I've had a little bit of time to think and I made use of it. As long as you can, I am fine with cases, as long as there is not too much running, definitely no fighting and no dangerous confrontations for you. As you said yesterday: I'm going to have to act for two now. And... and I think we should have a talk with your brother.”
When John repeated his blame for the tenth time, Mycroft stepped forward, hanging his umbrella from his left arm and gave John a good clap across the cheek. “Now is not the time to die in self-pity, John, Sherlock is still out there, in danger, and he needs his mate sharp!” the taller man snapped and John wondered briefly, woken a little by the unexpected action, just what it was Mycroft did for a living.
! John was damaged, he had deduced it the day they had met: PTSD – John, as an Alpha, was hypersensitive to stressful situations, in his case the endangerment of the well-being of his close relationships, closest being Sherlock and their pup. By staying away, John tried to help so as to not push and pressure Sherlock with both psychical
“No, seriously Sherlock, you need to stop making excuses for me. If I'm incapable of managing my life with a job and children, that should be my problem, not yours.”
“It's been a long few days.” John agreed. “Sleep well. And if anything's the matter, I'm upstairs.” he added, squeezing Sherlock's arm again in reassurance.
“Stupid biology! Humans are much too complicated for their own good!” Sherlock huffed shakily. “So.. you will be spending my entire heat with me?”
Confusing because the sedatives he was on detached his mind so far from his body, he felt like a third presence in the room.
Sherlock hummed, “hmm, you're getting used to the amount of sex we're having, aren't you?” he grinned back, drawing small suggestive circles with his hips.
“Sherlock, I am old – older than one should be for their first pup. You, however are five years younger than me and still in your prime, especially with your Omega nature only just evolving now. I pretty much gave up on my wish to one day have a family when I moved in with you and- well, anyway. I will not force you to settle down with me, just because I want to have this pup with you. You've still got options. I know you don't fancy the quite family life and even if so, you should still have chance and right to go and find yourself the partner you want. So, if you wish to abort this baby, I will not intervene. If you want to keep it, I will support you as much as I can or, if you don't want me to, leave this flat, this life, whatever you say you want me to do.”
It was the ultrasound that got interesting. The first of many and John and Sherlock were both tense with anticipation, visibly so or not, in Sherlock's case. There was cold gel spread on his abdomen and an apparatus switched on. As soon as that stick touched his body, the screen flickered to life to show vague pictures in black and white. Sherlock couldn't make much of it.
“It was just a big scare. And, although we know they've started growing again, there could still be something wrong. I guess we're both just a bit tense about that.” he spoke more softly than he usually would, earning himself a look from Sherlock, which he didn't return.
Eventually, he was trying to push back by pressing his hands against the wall in front of him, but John was stronger and Sherlock's arms felt like jelly. His body was on fire and John might as well have ripped his flesh off his bones with his hands clawing to his hips and his mouth biting along his back. He could feel his Alpha cock force it's way in and out between the tight muscle ring, could feel it along his inner walls, hitting his prostate, making him scream. Half leaning against the wall now, Sherlock bit his own arm to muffle his noises. John pulled his head back by his hair. “Don't you dare keep those sounds to yourself!”
Eventually, John played along, pecking the Omega's lips until he just stopped to kiss him properly, deeply, only to shove him away and off himself a second later. “This is not how this works.” he explained, gracefully going over to doing press-ups. “You come when I call, not the other way around.” he said coldly and Sherlock, sitting, leaning back against the bed, watched silently, but with a longing as John showed off his fitness.
Sherlock was clearly irked by these questions. Something about them seemed to bother him. John would have liked to know what it was, so maybe he could ask without agitating the Alpha. “Can't I just have someone sharing my flat?”
He had been thinking all of this through for two weeks now and he was starting to feel his body change already. Unlike other Omegas, he had trained himself to note even the tiniest development about his body, even if he thought it merely transport, and he could tell, that any day now, he would start spitting as his body tried to reject the stranger cells inside him.
“I know 'you just', John, but don't. Seriously, don't.” he replied sternly, turning out of John's embrace to stand up. “In case you haven't noticed, I'm a little edgy on the subject and I think the pup would appreciate me not drugging it with distress – can lead to disability, miscarriage or premature birth; the very things we are worrying about at the moment, better not encourage them.” he continued coldly, stepping out of the room and into the bedroom, where he pulled up his mobile from his bedside table and started googling for medical websites on pregnancies, infants and diseases to both. He also hacked himself into his doctor's clinic files to check all of his stats, finding nothing out of the ordinary there; nothing that could match the possible complications. He didn't know what was wrong. He hated not knowing. And he hated John not knowing even more. And he hated John not following after him like any other Alpha would because he loved how different John was.
“That's not very alpha of you.” Sherlock breathed as the only thing he found himself capable of as rational sense was knocked out of him. Curse his newly discovered nature for ruining this conversation by building up for the next round. “John, before we lose it again, I want you to know, that I never ever wish for you to step out of my life. Mark this, and listen carefully because I will likely never say it again: I love you, you are the best thing that could ever have happened to me. You change me and I am ok with that because I feel better and I get through life more easily with your advise and entertainment. Had I ever known I was an Omega, I wouldn't have let you run into this mistake because you don't deserve it. I am unworthy of care and your friendship and I feel ashamed of abusing your kindness, but that is what I am, a sociopath, I use and manipulate people, though I never feel bad about it except with you and, as I know I am overly selfish, don't ever leave me.... please.” Sherlock didn't know how that had just happened, but it had made his eyes water stupidly.
He padded into the kitchen, stopping beside John, who briefly smiled up at him before concentrating on his knife again. Sherlock tried an innocent approach that could be mistaken for an accident, bumping his middle against John's side. The Alpha didn't react.
“The English do like their tea.. and who better to clean their cups than an Omega tea towel?” Sherlock replied with a smirk. “Alphas tend to prefer shorter Omegas as they feel more empowered by towering you. Additionally, you just have that air about you.”
To think these four little dreams could ruin it all... he inhaled sharply, pulling out of his little blues and concentrating on the task at hand: finding clothes for the foreseeable future. After picking and trying on a number of outfits that looked the most descent this shop got (dark blue, green and purple t-shirts) he selected ten of the shirts (green ones with buttons down the collar in a short row or just plain, blue and purple ones following the same 'style') and ten black and dark blue trousers with elastic bands out of the mid-sixth-months section. He'd wear belts a long as necessary and could go from there!
Well, at least they were home now, they'd never stayed in a fight for long and he was sure once they had acclimatised back to their life together, mistrust and other ill-natured feelings between them would fall dead after a while. Considering their bond was strong enough for Sherlock to reach out and for John to locate him through it, it would also be strong enough to erase all the misunderstandings there may be or might come up still. They just needed to settle and regain their strength, or in John's case, a couple pounds.
“All I'm saying, Sherlock, is that you have made a decision and even if you wanted, the complicated law-system would prevent you from deciding against it now and since I wouldn't be able to just pass my own children on to someone else-”
Sherlock pouted and let himself fall into his chair, stretching his legs out on John's chair to signalise that he was not welcome to come sit opposite him. John, however, didn't seem very impressed. He was serious, then. Not giving in, standing tall to prove a point – John only ever did that when he was being really serious about something. It didn't work, then. Ah, he hated it when something didn't work as planned – miscalculations weren't really his favourites. John was supposed to feel bad for having refused his wish and making him upset, not stubbornly sit there and ignore him!
Sherlock shrugged a little. “Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe he took it from her for some reason. Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.”
They turned back to look at each other, daring one another to give in, but they knew they were both as thick-headed as the other. God, did they know. That meant no more hot chocolate for them that evening, unless..
Sherlock shrugged. “I would have no objections as long as the safety of my children is ensured. Although, I suppose we ought to make such a decision together and I don't think we are quite ready for that.” If it was just about him, he'd have no qualms whatsoever to become a source of research information. Medicine was a kind of science. This was about more than just him, though, and they had other things to work through first.
John, surprisingly, had a small, empathetic, yet longing smile on his face and briefly, instinctively gives one of Sherlock's shins a small caress. “No, I don't think that's an appropriate idea. I will, however, see to getting you something to help yourself with, if you'd like?”
mean I lied! I only remember that round of coitus, not the conversation and was ever so slightly afraid I would have to be ashamed of you being able to know my emotions and being only in this because of instinct yourself...”
Especially after the scare with the Alpha rapist some weeks ago, there had been a noticeable shift within Sherlock and he was, visibly, less comfortable around any other Alpha. Between him and his brother, it was just an annoying asset for him to get slightly restless to even becoming anxious if Mycroft stayed at the flat for more than ten minutes; but the real problem were other, non-family Alphas. Sherlock avoided even coming within a 2 meter radius from then and still never stood still, rubbing his index and middle finger nervously against his thumb, looking tense as he tried not to look too tense and often just beginning to pace around in order to wear down the feeling of irrational fear.
John knew that he should have let Sherlock explain himself, but he feared that it would not have come out as delicately as John had made it. He loved Sherlock dearly and he wanted Sebastian to understand why. Sebastian smiled, “He is a good man, John. You need not tell me.”
Did he deserve John? After all that he had put John through, did he actually think that John would still be there, ready to accept him with open arms? He had hurt him, had played with his heart, how could one be so easily forgiven after committing such a grave crime? John was kind, yes, but even the kindest people had their limits. What would he even say? He was awful at apologizing, even if he truly meant it. He would have to spend the whole walk home searching for the right words and piecing together something that would earn John’s forgiveness. If he was not able to continue his relationship with John, he could at least learn to live with him if they maintained a friendship.
“We will think of something, I am sure. Moriarty is human, just as you are, he can be killed just like anyone else.”
The next morning, Sherlock woke to find John wrapped tightly around him, even more so than was usual. Sherlock sighed, it had everything to do with their conversation before they slept, the discovery that he made after their beautiful night together. Moriarty had gone against his word and informed Detective Inspector Lestrade of their relationship - him of all people! The one person in the whole of Scotland Yard that had actually built a rapport with him. It was all ruined now, they were caught, Sebastian had become their martyr for all the wrong reasons, and John had no idea as to what they were in for. He wanted to get an early start, before John was awake and coherent and ready to follow Sherlock to the ends of the earth. Slowly, he began to untangle himself from John’s limbs and leave the bed without even causing so much as a stir from his slumbering love. When he was off the bed, Sherlock smiled, and he knew he would hate himself for it later, but he could not resist giving John’s cheek a gentle touch. He stared at John for a few minutes before the man pawed at his face and rolled over. It could very well be their last sleep together if the worst were to come to fruition.
Sherlock turned to face the Inspector with feigned geniality. Had he come any time other than now, everything would have been alright.
He let out a breath and offered his arm up to John. They both looked each other in the eye, and with the reassurance in John’s darker ones, he slowly moved to roll up the sleeve. When he was met with the burn his face darkened and instilled the smallest bit of fear in Sebastian. He had angered John, he had not meant to, he was weak.
“Again. Please, dear God, that same place, again.” He knew he was begging but Sherlock did not care. He was safe with John, safe with the man who loved him.
His kindness felt like a dagger in his chest. They had to talk. They had to talk. They had to--“No, I’m fine. Night, Sherlock.”
“Okay,” Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut, snuggling into the pillow (although he would never use that word to describe himself). “Sweet dreams,” he mumbled, voice soft and rich like honey.
God, John loved him. Their kisses were now growing slow and lazy, tender and without a purpose other than showing pure affection. John was so happy to be here with him. “I love you,” he whispered against his lips between small pecks, “I never wanna be apart from you.”
“I guess you weren’t, then,” he rolled his eyes. “I was...well, you know I only remember you from 2012, so I was asking...you really want a relationship?” he asked with a self-conscious look on his face. “I can’t picture you wanting any of what a marriage entails.”
, John,” he admitted, reminiscent of the night in front of the fireplace at Baskerville, only with terrifying rawness. Sherlock’s breath hitched, and he dropped his hands and brought them to his own face, breaking down into bitter tears. “I want to stop being afraid,” he wept into his hands, anguished whimpers growing into harsh sobs.
That, at least, made his eyes light up with interest. “He did? He hasn’t spoken about them since he was a child.”
They stared at each other, the only sound between them being John’s ragged breathing. A couple walked by and looked at them strangely, but they didn’t notice.
John was tired of lies. “Sherlock,” he said lowly, “show me, or I’ll rip off your gown and see for myself.”
It took John a second, but then it clicked. He only knew Irene was alive from when she texted Sherlock after the Culverton case. He stood up, putting his hands in his pockets, not sure how to lie.
It was a slow, careful press of lips, John moving in with an air of caution. Sherlock breathed shakily out of his nose, the feel of John’s moist lips on his more intense than the drugs running through his veins just a few days ago. He felt the warm puff of air from John’s nose on his face, and he reached up to cling a hand to the collar of his jacket. Sherlock was pressing back into the kiss with a small, deep subconscious moan, which was loud in contrast to the silence of the room. He felt John put his hand on his chest, its weight warm and solid. It was reassuring.
Sherlock sat up against the headboard. The gooseflesh on his skin was now out of anxiety instead of arousal.
“Speeding things up,” Sherlock replied, unbuttoning his shirt. “You were going to undress me sooner or later, right?”
Sherlock was looking down and he put his hands down by his sides, scarlet from his cheekbones to his neck. “Good.”
John wanted...he wanted to go home, actually. He wanted to curl up in bed and try to process everything. But, wait. Wait.
Sherlock sat down in one of the kitchen chairs, rubbing his eye tiredly. “Can you not?” he muttered. “You need to eat.”
“I knew a woman named Rosamund,” she told Sherlock, and there was a rare hesitance to her voice. “She was a trained assassin who worked for Jim.”
Once they were seated at the table by a jovial Angelo, John raised an eyebrow at him. “You all right?”
“Come on, it’s been awhile since we’ve been on a case that wasn’t batshit insane,” he said, avoiding Sherlock’s eyes. (He had been doing that a lot lately.) “I’m out of practice with working with you, anyway.”
John was disturbed out of sleep by a bang. He was lying on his stomach, and for a moment he dismissed it ad Rosie, but then he remembered that a one year-old probably wouldn’t be able to make a noise like that in her crib, and if she did, there was probably something very wrong. He pushed himself up on his elbows, fumbling for the switch on the lamp next to his bed, but suddenly, the lights to his room turned on. He jumped up and whipped around, hand instinctively reaching for the illegal handgun he used to keep under his pillow at Baker Street, but he’d gotten rid of that thing for Rosie’s sake, never wanting her to accidentally find it. He was about to severely regret his decision, but he saw that it was Sherlock standing in the doorway to his bedroom, hand splayed on the wall by the light switch.
John started to choke, and he gasped, forcing his breathing to slow down. He really didn’t want to vomit, even though a toilet was right there. His long, shaking inhales were loud in his ears. He put his hands down, and stared at the door of the stall with blurry vision, throat burning, and it felt like there was a gaping hole in his chest. He wanted to go back to the other world--at least there, his feelings were still secret.
“Can I have my daughter back?” John asked through gritted teeth, his left hand clenching into a fist, the ring feeling heavy on his finger.
It was cold outside, but the crisp air was refreshing. He loved Sherlock, but John was never one to lie around the flat. It wasn’t good for his health. There was something dark out of the corner of his eye, and he turned his head. A black car was pulling up to the sidewalk.
He was stuck, and felt like the walls were closing in on him. Sherlock could not send anything else without leading to him being revealed, so there was no way he could try to make John fall for his suitor more. If John didn’t want him now, then that was it--he wouldn’t ever want him. In addition, he didn’t know how much longer he would have been able to keep this up without Mary catching on and telling John anyway. Sherlock’s throat tightened. Why did he think this would work? Stupid Mummy. This was her fault.
his mind said with cynical glee. It had been bugging him for quite some time--well, since the start--but that didn’t mean he was right to push Sherlock last night, especially when he had just taken morphine.
“About twenty-five minutes ago,” Sherlock wiped his jaw furiously, gestures completely uncoordinated. “I tried to do without it, but I couldn’t.” His knees were drawn up to his chest, and he looked up at John helplessly. He stared at John silently for a long moment, but his eyes were flickering. John wondered if he were spacing out, or if his brain were going faster than Sherlock could keep up with. “You cried,” he started speaking softly, quickly, “I see it on your face. It’s been hours, but you cried. You cried because of me, because of what I did. You ran out of the flat immediately and went--where? A pub,” he concluded almost immediately, “but you left your wallet, so you searched for free alcohol.” He sucked in a breath, having said all of that in a single go. He was deducing faster than normal, and for once, John wasn’t impressed. “You went to seek comfort from a friend, so you went to Lestrade’s and slept on his--chair? No, sofa, until you left--” His speech was cut off abruptly and a flash of anger appeared in his eyes. “Mycroft. He got you and brought you here.”
,” a tear dripped off his jaw and onto his jacket. He sighed miserably.“I don’t even know where to begin, Sherlock. I fucked up so much,” he cried, and then rubbed his eyes.
with being hung up on Mary. He was tired of thinking about her. He was tired of acting as if Sherlock were not a better human being a million times over!
As much as he knew she was wrong, John did have a strong moral compass, and Sherlock could see the remorse start to form on his face. She was manipulating him. Sherlock had to help him.
“Why’d you come in our room in the first place?” John asked, putting his hands on his knees and leaning forward. “You couldn’t fucking
Sherlock closed his eyes, willing the negative thoughts away. “No need to be sorry,” he whispered back.
Sherlock went on. “You feel guilty for hurting me, but let me tell you that you have nothing to apologize for.”
Sherlock hummed a deep, rumbling purr. He shifted his head a little on his pillow so their faces were still close, but they had space, too. John used the last of his strength to watch Sherlock’s face relax completely, and then he allowed himself to close his eyes, believing that things were finally going right.
John went into his house, and Lestrade guided him over to the black leather sofa, muttering for him to sit down, and yes, he’d give him a bloody drink. True to his word, Lestrade was handing John a drink a minute later.
Sherlock gulped and nodded frantically. “John, I think going to my bedroom would be the best. The sofa is rather small for two grown men.”
“I gotta go,” he muttered, walking past them, ignoring Sherlock and Mary calling his name. He practically fled from the restaurant, and realized that Sherlock and Mary were probably going to try to find him, so, feeling absolutely mad, he ran. He ran until his lungs burned and his feet hurt from being in dress shoes, and he stopped by a bus stop with a bench, panting. He collapsed onto the bench, elbows on his knees and face in his hands, holding back bitter tears.
“We’ve got to go see Sherlock today,” he told Rosie as he carried her back to his room. “I want to spend more time with you, and I promise I will, but this needs to be done.”
If he were honest with himself, Sherlock could say he still felt guilt over that, although he considered himself even with Janine after the fake sex stories. “I had my reasons,” he insisted.
“I didn’t think I’d feel worse after visiting Sherlock,” he sighed, taking off the carrier and putting the nappy bag on the floor. “But I didn’t expect to see
John was about to shrug and go about his day--after all, Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson were close and it wasn’t out of the ordinary for them to talk, but usually, Sherlock only ever went down to her flat if he wanted something. But now, from the tone of their voices, it sounded like they were discussing something serious. Was something wrong?
John thought of how throughout their marriage, Mary barely said she loved him, and here was Sherlock, tender and caring, already a better partner. John nodded, afraid he might tear up again (god, he really had to stop crying at the drop of a hat). “Thank you,” he said quietly.
“You have,” Sherlock confirmed cautiously. “Once. I don’t like my brain being compromised, so I rarely drink alcohol. It was awful.”
John sat up, getting out of his jeans and pants, relieved when the stickiness was no longer clinging to his (now flaccid) cock. He took off his vest, too, and turned to Sherlock, actually feeling a bit self-conscious now that they weren’t having sex. Sherlock had seen him shirtless before after he’d gotten out of the shower in the past, but that was about it, and he really did think he couldn’t compare to Sherlock at all in terms of looks.
John leaned against the wall, thinking. He didn’t want them to be uncomfortable around each other. There was enough serious business going on; their petty nonsense would have to wait for another day. Well, his petty nonsense would have to wait. He should apologize to Sherlock. He clearly felt embarrassed from last night, and maybe an admission of wrongdoing from John would ease the tension.
“So, er,” John crossed his arms over his chest (a defensive stance, Sherlock noted), “if it wasn’t the body, what was it?”
John put his head in his hands. Great. Just fucking great. He should have controlled his urges and stuck to kissing his lips and neck. He didn’t know Sherlock would, or could, come by that alone. Sherlock must have been mortified. It was, to John’s knowledge, his first orgasm in front of another person, and that itself could be embarrassing, but he also knew that coming in his pants had to have hurt his pride. He wanted to comfort Sherlock and tell him that, really, it was all fine, and he shouldn’t be embarrassed, but feared that talking to him now would only make things worse.
These were the thoughts which occupied his mind, creating uncomfortable silences when he was around Sherlock. He didn't want to act this way, because he could tell Sherlock felt awkward and unsure of himself around John, choosing his words carefully, being polite but distant. John couldn't stop feeling so miserable, though.
“Sherlock, it’s late, we’re both in our pajamas, and we’re on top of a bed. Let’s just get our heads out of our arses, get under the covers, and fucking relax for once.”
A sharp intake of breath broke them apart, and it was from Sherlock. His red mouth moved wordlessly, his pupils large. He lowered his hand from John’s face, bringing it to his chest. “The morphine is kicking in.”
John decided to occupy his time with unpacking what he retrieved from Mary’s place, and arranging it all around his room. It took more time than he thought it would have, because right as he looked around, surveying the room, there was a light knock on his door.
Sherlock felt some of his dark mood evaporate when he saw the hurt expression of John’s face, but then John put up his shield of anger.
. John wanted to reach out to him, but stopped himself. “Me, too,” he gave a self-deprecating laugh.
John shook his head, a bitter smile on his face. “‘Reasons,’ sure. You couldn’t be in a relationship even if you tried.” The second those words left John’s mouth, his eyes widened and his anger vanished, his lips snapping shut.
He would have gone with John, but honestly, it was much too early to get out of bed. He glanced at the clock on the bedside table: 8:07 in the morning. It was an
Sherlock grabbed the blanket thrown over the back of John’s chair and was quickly wrapping it around himself.
“I think you’ve been hurting for a long time,” John stared at the headboard. This confirmed, again, that seeing the depth and intensity of Sherlock’s heart was terrifying. “Breathe. You need to calm down. You worry me so bloody much,” John told him, shutting his eyes tightly. “You can’t do this to yourself.”
I hope you guys liked this! And in case you haven't noticed, I've hinted at the scars on Sherlock's back, but that has been done to death in fanfic, so I'm going to do a slightly different take on it so it'll be fresh. So if you like that johnlock fanfic trope, expect it with a bit of a difference ;)
John knew that much, but he feigned surprise. He wasn’t sure how good of an actor he was, but Sherlock wasn’t looking at him, so he figured he was good.
“Of course it was,” she agreed. “I can’t tell you how happy I am. I’ve been waiting for this since the moment you moved in.”
The fire in his eyes went away. “I know.” He rubbed his jaw, his growing stubble making a scratching sound against his palm. He traced his lower lip with his index finger, a nervous trait John wasn’t sure he was aware of. His voice grew quiet. “Can I tell you something?”
John’s eyes widened further, and then he blinked and coughed behind his fist. “Uh, right. Okay. So. I was. Your first.”
“I don’t know,” he answered. “Odd, I suppose.” He wiped his right eye with his thumb. “I’m sure you’ve guessed that I avoided this for a long time. But, it isn’t right for me to treat you a certain way based on something in the past.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I should’ve stopped. Things got heated pretty fast.” He was blinded by his own arousal.
“It did,” he said. “I think I needed to get over the initial apprehension. You really do know me well.”
“I feared this part, too” Sherlock sighed, his face open and slightly sad, “admitting to myself that I wanted to be in a relationship with you, and felt--desire.” He took a small sip of water, hiding his face behind the glass for a moment. “It was very difficult to come to terms with,” he mumbled.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, deducing through the cloud of morphine, eyes scanning John. “I think,” he spoke softly, “if you were to put your mind to being there for a baby, you would. You don’t give up on people you care for.”
“I was bloody furious with him,” John said. “He’s too weak to even sit up on his own right now, let alone get up and walk.” He swallowed. “His heart had stopped.”
“You did, but, just checking. So, you forgive me. I forgive you for anything you think you did wrong. What I mean to say is, can we stop blaming ourselves for everything? I’ve fucked up over the years and so have you.” Sherlock got the feeling that it would have been significantly more difficult for John to say all this if their faces were not hidden. He kissed the side of John's neck in encouragement. John went on, asking quietly, “Can we just love each other from now on?”
Why did he fall for Mary’s tricks so easily? Why was he willing to save and protect her when Ajay wanted to kill her? Why did they talk and laugh after she shot him like everything was normal?
Yet, the more he thought about it, he couldn’t exactly blame John for taking his words to heart. There were times when John tried to get closer to him, and Sherlock pushed him away out of fear. How stupid he had been. If he hadn’t been such a coward, then their situation could have been resolved. He might have realized he needed to let John in too late.
John was upset, yes, but growing increasingly concerned. What was wrong with Sherlock? “I can’t leave when you’re like this. You’re holding yourself. Does it hurt?”
?” He looked down at the ring. He looked back at Sherlock, and then back at the ring. He put his head in his hands. “I swear, I’m going to have a heart attack,” he mumbled into his palms. He lifted his head. “Is that why you’re nicer than I remember?”
John figured Sherlock would want to more or less be in the same position they were, so he quickly went to the bed and sat against the headboard, holding out his arms so Sherlock could go on top of him and hide his face again, if he wanted to.
“Sherlock bloody Holmes--” he almost used the present tense, and remember she was unaware that he was alive, “--was never a danger to society.”
Sherlock nodded, balling up the gauze and throwing it into the trash bin in the corner of the room. “That’s better. Anyway, how do you feel, about all of this?”
Sherlock liked that an angry John was sometimes a smug John. Before she left, though, Sherlock warned, “If you ever try anything funny, with either of us, know that my brother’s people will hunt you down. You were able to get away with shooting me only because I told him to stay out of it. You will not be offered that same courtesy anymore.”
He shrugged. “Well, I decided I don’t want to marry her. I don’t really see the point of staying with her.” He paused. “Why do you care?”
John shouldn't have gone back to her, and Sherlock didn’t know why he wasn’t angry about this, either. She shot him, and John stayed married to her until his death. He didn’t even know why. He didn’t love her by the end. There were too many lies, and John wished he never met her.
John bit his lip with a groan, his own cock aching and begging to be touched. He didn’t want to push Sherlock into touching him, but maybe, if they were on the bed, he could position himself to rut against Sherlock a bit. He really didn’t care about looking like a dog in heat at this point. He
Sherlock looked at him. “Yes.” He swallowed, and a touch of nervousness laced his voice. “We can--I’m sorry, I am, but we can be like we were before. We can go on cases, just you and me and the rest of the world.”
“Well?” Culverton prompted. “How’d it feel? I saw it happen. Quite violent, wasn’t it? I even felt sorry for you.”
The blackness slowly faded when John opened his eyes, distressingly slowly, and when the fog finally cleared, he felt completely disorientated. His head was swimming, and he groaned and rubbed his temples.
Sherlock gasped and tried foolishly to stand up, but Mary kicked him again and sent him back to the floor. “You’re handcuffed and drugged,” Mary laughed at him. “Where do you think you’re going?”
“You really were,” a dirty smirk curled around his lips. “You’ve got absolutely nothing to worry about if you’re wondering if the sex was good or not.”
“Then I’d rather wait years for us to get to this point than for us to have gotten together too quickly and possibly broken up.” It looked like the conversation was unpleasant from him. John looked back at the clock on the bedside table. “It’s almost time to go.”
Edit: I've edited this chapter a good bit since I first published it. I lost sight of how creepy Sherlock's actions could be perceived lol. It's just that I know Sherlock isn't a creep, you know? But it'd be more realistic for John to be more wary. This was brought to my attention in a comment, and it's actually going to change the course of the story. I'll add some more of that in the next chapter. So, yeah, if you read this chapter when it first came out and are reading it now, you'll see some big differences.
Sherlock strained his raw skin against the rope and the cold wood of the chair. He did not want to exist, he wished that he could be granted the gift of disappearance so that he would not have to go through with this already painful moment.
“You know, I never thought I would make it this far.” Moriarty half-shouted over the roar of the water. They were now on the cliff inside the falls. There was barely any room to walk, yet there they both stood, talking.
Sherlock closed his eyes and managed to push all the doubts away until he was lulled to sleep by John’s breathing and the quiet night that they were sharing together.
Sherlock was aware that he had spent many nights watching John, feeding John, and teaching John that he had not taken the proper time for himself. He had only slept for hours at a time, but now it had become harder for Sherlock to find the right time to have a rest. John had felt guilty about it and he wanted to help.
The way he held Sherlock’s arms, he truly wanted to know what had distressed Sherlock to the point  he wept. They would stay like this forever if Sherlock did not open his mouth so he had no choice. He could already hear John’s hurtful words.
Sherlock frowned. He did not like upsetting John, but how could he tell him the reason for his melancholy if John would not understand?
“Yes, we will see our Baker Street yet again, my dear Watson.” Both smiled at the idea. Sherlock was the one to break the embrace, although every fiber in his being wanted nothing more than to remain in John’s arms, Moriarty be damned.
“You’ve not enough meat on your bones, Sherlock! I’ve made enough food for John so that you may have extra helpings. I do not like the thought of you skipping your meals.”
Sherlock opened his mouth wide and ate the piece of egg. John’s mouth moved as if he were eating as well. He was imitating Sherlock’s chewing. Sherlock swallowed and cut a piece of John’s egg.
“Quite on the mark! You see, with Sherlock’s incessant urging of obtaining more evidence, the police found that I was the last person to have seen the idiot before his death and found the soiled jacket in my room. They would have never thought to search me had you left well enough alone, Mr. Holmes!”
“He was a child!” Thomas shouted back. His gun was shaking, whether his resolve was waning or he was becoming dangerously close to shooting one of them, John could not tell. John huffed and stood straight, to show Thomas that he was not weak and neither was Sebastian.
“There you are.” His eyes honed in on a brown suit on display. The ensemble went together splendidly; the shoes were burgundy, and the tie a dark plaid color. The suit itself was wool, and a lovely shade of brown, topped off with a bowler hat of the same color. Sherlock had no doubt in his mind that John would look incredibly handsome in it. He called for the clerk who rushed back over to him.
Sebastian did not respond at first. It was not until Sherlock was nearly gone that he heard him say, “Don’t go.”
“Come love, let us retire until morning. You have not had sufficient rest since our arrival at the manor, you are simply weary in both mind and body.”
“Sherlock, dear Sherlock...don’t be daft, you and I both know that he does not have the intelligence ample enough to carry out such criminal acts. He told me of his recent meeting with you, when you were attacked by those buffoons Sally and Anderson just outside your home. He also spoke of your relationship with our dear John here.”
John showed Sherlock his hands. He understood “not” and “fire”, perhaps. No burns on them, he was well-behaved, Sherlock already knew that. He shuffled his feet and crossed his arms. He would love nothing more than to return to bed but he would only be back out and checking in on John. It was only an hour left till dawn, he was not going to fall asleep that quickly. The fire was warm, and Sherlock yearned for John’s company. His bed felt harder and more frigid than usual. He blamed himself. He had expected John to fill the empty space next to m while he slumbered. However, if John wished to reside here, so would he. Sherlock walked over to his bookshelf and selected a random book. It was one of Oscar Wilde’s books,
“Then you leave this to me,” He said to Sherlock, voice unyielding. His next words were to the new man, “My name is John. John Watson.”
“That is the reason they attacked you? They spotted you in the cemetery and while they incorrectly assumed your goings on, they were not far from the truth. They remembered your face from all that time ago.”
Sherlock could not help but feel guilt at the woman’s words. He had told her to not disturb him, but there had been times where he would wish that she were at Baker Street with him, singing lullabies from childhood, cooking him bountiful meals whether he cared to eat or not. Just as she had naught but him, she was all he had left of his family as well.  He turned to see John handing their baggage to Jeanette.
John chuckled and Sherlock felt the vibrations course through his body. John leaned forward and reached for the soaps to begin the task of washing Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock closed his eyes again as John took his time to massage his scalp and cover every curl on his head with the lavender and mint soap.
John wanted to ask him why, he saw the look in his eyes, but he could never bring himself to and only nodded. Mrs. Hudson returned with his food and wore her facade well.
Sherlock spun around to find a man standing in the entrance of the room. He was dressed in a gray suit, hair as black as the night, and eyes that were cold and reminded Sherlock of those of a  spider’s. His tone had an Irish lilt.
He sniffled and wiped the tears hanging from the tip of his nose. With a great effort, he rose from his bed and staggered over to the bookshelf. He retrieved one and opened it. The first image was Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man.
“Sherlock, I am angry, I am hurt. You lied to me, you let me live in the illusion that I was normal, that you sported these scars just the same as I. Yet all I can do is forgive you. I am sure, being the intelligent man that you are, that I have no other company on this earth save you. And I’m also sure that I do not want any other but you, Sherlock. You are my best friend, you are my only friend, I shall never find another like you even if I wanted to. I love you Sherlock, and only you.”
She was sitting on the couch in front of him, wearing latex as she loved to, it drew her legs beautifully, crossed elegantly over the white sofa.
A hand grabbed his curls tightly, “Hush now,” John said firmly, pulling his hair, forcing him to stand up on his knees again. Sherlock's hand grabbed him, he could think of quite a number of ways he could break the man's wrist. He imagined all in less than a few seconds, he would do it, he thought, he would do it and fuck Mycroft, and everyone else, fuck the entire world. He would end up in a clinic. The first time it had been classified as self-defense and exhausted sub needs, the second he would go straight for aggression.
John grabbed the keys from his hand, "Sherlock" he started, but then he seemed to forget what he was going to say, that it was unprofessional, that Sherlock needed his private space away from his trainer, "Thank you" he finished.
Feel free to leave suggestions if you want, writing is kinda helping to pass time during this fucking second quarantine.
Sherlock whimpered loudly, he felt the pulsing cock pressing against his entrance, his mind was a messy crowd of disjointed thoughts, but one single, urgent crave prevailed over anything else, deafening, “Please, please” he cried out, trying to remember how to speak, to return a bit of clarity in his cloudy state, “Please use me,” he pinched with quivering asphyxiating desire, “Use me, sir, please” he repeated and his voice turned into a begging scream as John opened him.
“Is that some kind of leftover from your military past, or it just turns you on?” Sherlock asked acrimoniously. The Dom smiled and answered, “It's a pretty standard sign of respect and politeness,”  he still was not giving the sub the satisfaction of visibly irritating him, “that you seem to have forgotten already”.
I really like to receive suggestions and requests, so please let me know anything you like or dislike.
“These are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,” Jack said sighing loudly before continuing “they are amateur detectives from London who are interested in our cases,” he said. The doctor glared at Sherlock, waiting for his reaction, but Sherlock didn’t seem to have heard any of it, his eyes were looking intensely at Will.
“Do you know what is this?” The doctor asked, ignoring Sherlock's silent sulking, he showed the detective a little metal object, the look the young man gave him was more than eloquent, but the Dom waited for a verbal response. Sherlock sighed loudly, “It's a chastity cage” he answered dryly, trying desperately to suppress the blush flushing violently on his cheeks.
John sucked his length, slowly, licking him first delicately, then with force, he could feel the sub's body shaking and he bit, just slightly, hearing the delightful muffed scream he caused. He gave Sherlock a last powerful lick, letting sucking his cock to the base, feeling salty precum, and then stepped back once again.
When John's touched the plug, Sherlock whimpered, “Should I leave this here so you remember to behave, or can I put it out?” John asked, twisting the end of the plug a bit, savoring the tremble of the sub's legs.
“Keep the legs a bit more apart,” John said, guiding the movement with his walking stick, probably seeing Sherlock's discomfort.
“It must be the lunch, let me get it,” John said reassuringly, “You can put something on and clean yourself up,” the Dom said, anticipating Sherlock's thoughts.
This time the detective had dressed up for John's visit. He unbuttoned quickly his shirt, trying to fight the trembling of his fingers, he thought for a second if it was right to stand up for taking his trousers off, and finally decided that it was.
“It would have been a shame, to lose that amazing musical talent of yours out of such a bastard's face,”   Lestrade had commented when he had visited him, checked on him. He hadn't said anything about Sherlock's new revealed dynamic, he had kept it quiet, even if the detective had seen a concern he hadn't ever noticed on his brother's dominant's face.
Sherlock had spoiled every single thing they had tried to watch, with deductions about cast's affairs, inner fights plot holes, mocking the exaggerated surprise at painfully obvious plot twists.
John opened the office door, “Out” he said to Sherlock. The sub stood up, he gave Greg a last glare of resentment, before walking out the door, avoiding John's eyes.
John hadn't heard the car approaching him. It stopped just next to him, the windows had buzzed open. A woman on the back seat had asked him if he wanted a ride, “Wouldn't that be better, considering your leg, Doctor Watson?” she had said smiling.
“Fine then, a good boy spanking” John chuckled, caressing his but cheeks, feeling the sub's muscles tensing with anticipation beneath his fingers admiring the almost invisible signs he had left on the boy's skin.
“I wanted to do this as soon as I saw this tub” the doctor said smiling as he knelt in front of the tub, rubbing tenderly Sherlock's body with the sponge, not minding that his sleeves, despite being folded to half his arms, were getting wet as he soaked the sponge again so that it wouldn't get cold. It was a shame, he thought, that the tub wasn't big enough for both of them, but he still enjoyed bathing his boy, it was soothing aftercare.
The owner seemed to not care to investigate the matter further, he got closer to John “He saved my life, you know?” he said, “You are a lucky man” he smiled widely.
Greg Lestrade and two agents stormed into the flat, “Where is it, Sherlock?” the DI yelled immediately, glaring only for a short moment the doctor.
He grabbed the black leather crop from Sherlock's shaking hands, “What a polite pet are we,” he said smiling, caressing the curls of the sub's bowed head. Sherlock made a face at the nickname but the praise still stroke him, calming a bit the trepidation that had been clenching his heart.
He whimpered in a complaint but yet his back arched searching for the crop, exposing his marked cheeks in a silent consent and breath-taking trepidation.
“I don’t understand this newsfeed,” John said that last word disdainfully “It's mostly garbage, Sherlock” he finally proclaimed. The detective smirked, with that little patronising scoff that, as usual, made John roll his eyes “There is some truth in them and, more notably, an interesting one” the detective said enigmatically, John glared at him, irritated.
He had left the scene shortly after, retrieved the bag that none of those idiots seemed to have noticed had gone been missing and he had returned home.
“You like that, little one?” John asked with a grin, Sherlock nodded. The spanking the sub had received had been the most severe one so far, despite the cooling time out, the skin was still deeply red, purple signs were emerging on the center on each cheek, where the Dom had concentrated the blows.
He had undressed of the few clothes covering him at the Doctor's command, he had dared, almost shyly, to ask why, “Because I want to play with you now,” the Dom had answered with melting arousal in his tone.
John chuckled, “I don't think they do anatomically accurate insects plush toys,” he said, “I just saw you had a lot of books on bee behavior and thought you would like it”.
Mycroft struggled with the cuffs as he was opened as Greg started to fuck him with unmerciful force, he heard his own scream of grateful pain, and then the air was missing and the scream suffocated, becoming just desperate gasps.
John observed his chest rising and descending with each sigh permeated of liberating relief, he massaged his back, grabbed his thighs, and smiled warmly at Sherlock's little sounds. His finger was still inside the boy, toying carefully inside the reddened cheeks.
Their bedroom door slammed into the frame after a hard prod of John’s foot but neither men cared. The moment they were in the room with the bed but a few feet away, the two men came together once more. Sherlock’s arms looped tight around John’s neck while the other man held him close around the waist.
John pulled up to rest his forearms on either side of Sherlock’s head so he could watch that ethereal face, take in the look of utter pleasure. He began to move his hips faster, thrusting into the tightness of Sherlock’s arse so that he could push in as deep as possible.
“You will follow us and we will clothe you, feed you, and find you a suitable spot to rest, unless you would prefer to remain here, in the nude, alone, and no doubt cold.”
He looked down at it. The tear stains on his cheeks obvious against ashen pale skin of depression and malnourishment.
Thomas held the gun up to face the sky as he listened to John speak. He smirked, and said, “There is a different air about you, John. Does it have something to do with me?”
Sherlock turned around and saw the pitiful look that Sebastian gave him. “John will be unhappy, as will I. He...he cares for you a great deal, I may not have your intellect, but I know enough to understand. We can leave right now, if you wish it. I have no need to pack.”
Sherlock looked up at John and groaned. “Moriarty has no doubt returned from wherever he ventured. He would not leave Sebastian alone for long, he would not have asked for his creation had he not some use for him.”
Sebastian felt Moriarty standing right behind him as he said, “Our friends Mr. Holmes and Watson have joined us, have they not?”
He could still see the way she stared at him. There was a light that dimmed in her eyes whenever she looked at Sherlock after their talk at breakfast. He had always thought that she was different, that she paid no mind to the more personal aspects of his life. Why did he think that of her? Mycroft told him to find a woman that would put up with him and last long enough to bear him children. Mrs. Hudson merely ignored that side of him and chose only to see the little boy she spent years caring for. Which one of them were worse? Sherlock could not help but wonder how she felt when she heard the argument between the two. Was she heart-broken? Did she want to defend him, but feared Mycroft’s response? No, the second choice was highly improbable. She stood there, in the shadows, and listened to every harmful word that Mycroft said to him, and she agreed, the woman that had always shielded him from Mycroft’s wrath, agreed. She had always felt the same way, but simply chose to push those thoughts aside and let Sherlock live in the illusion that he still had one person left at the manor who loved him.
Thomas watched as the two walked away, only moving after they were out of his field of vision. He walked into the station, which was busy to say the least, coppers running to and fro, doing their jobs. He scanned the area to find an officer that was not buried in paperwork of some kind or bringing in one of the various vagrants of London. His eyes landed on a man of silver hair, seated behind a desk. He was not only an officer, but one of higher-ranking. Thomas approached the man reading the inscription on the nameplate. He cleared his throat and spoke, “Inspector Lestrade?”
“I am quite proud of him.” John was facing a sleeping Sebastian. He and Sherlock were lying in bed together, they washed up after dinner and turned in early.
Thomas’ gun shook so much that John thought he was going to pull the trigger by accident. Instead, he dropped the gun and a look of defeat ran across his face.
Sherlock scoffed. “You never really are, are you?” He mumbled. God, he had done it again. He was being short with John and unrightly so. John did not seem affected in the slightest, but Sherlock knew that he was only being polite. He would lose John too, at this rate.
The man only stared, but followed Sherlock as he was led out of the room. Sherlock ran a bath for him, and he watched as the water filled up the small tub. Sherlock could not help but smile as he observed the other’s actions and behaviors. The world was so new to him, he had not yet experienced the emotions and sensations, or beheld the wonders that it offered him. At one point, he put his hand into the water, he must have been startled by his reflection. Sherlock shook his head and removed the hand from the bath.
“Give me your hand, Sebastian,” Sherlock had to use a little more force in his voice, he regretted it, but Sebastian finally complied and placed his hand in Sherlock’s grasp. He whimpered when Sherlock moved to roll up the sleeve. There it was, the darkened mark against pale skin, angry red that showed violence. It looked fresh and was no doubt being irritated by the material of Sebastian’s jacket.
Before Sherlock could even formulate an answer, John approached them with a grin, their luggage in hand. Mrs. Hudson’s face showed slight astonishment but she greeted John in the same manner she did Sherlock. When they entered the manor, John’s jaw nearly came undone as he took in the size of the place. It was so different from the flat that they lived in that it was as if they had entered a world entirely different to the one they knew - or the one John knew. Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson were in the midst of conversation while John gaped at everything within his sight.
“I may not have been placed on this world...by natural means, but I am not alone, Thomas. I have John, who shares the same unique ties to this world as I. I have Sherlock, and although we began on the wrong foot, I care for him as well as John. They are family to me, regardless of blood we do not share or which woman birthed me. I was birthed from Sherlock and John, and though not ideal, it is my lot in life and I should think that I have come to terms with it now. It does not matter to me whether they cared to create me before you appeared in their lives. If they were content to be together, there is little I can do to change that. I am here now, created as a bargaining chip for you, but I am loved by John and by Sherlock.”
“I would have been left to rot in that hell, had not a man by the name of Thomas Banville come to rescue me. Says that he was a friend of my father’s.”
John tried to laugh too, but all that came out was something of a wheeze. He leaned in and said, “John.”
Sherlock nodded as he halted his tears. He could not speak for his voice was too choked up. If a word so much as left his mouth, he would be a sobbing mess and John would hate it and leave. He could not risk John’s disapproval. His friend rushed over to his side and forced the other to stare into his eyes. The urge to cry was even harder then.
Sherlock’s anger flared at the utterance of the statement. To think, his brother’s only friend betrayed him in this manner. He inhaled so that Moriarty would not be able to deduce his real emotion.
Sherlock cringed. He had not meant to inflict any harm upon John. That night he had been frightened and distraught over the failure of his venture. John awakening, mobile, alive, was that last thing he had expected.
John wanted to tend to Sherlock, but the creation was of the highest importance at the moment, sprained wrist be damned. John turned to face their newest occupant of the flat with apprehension, in case he displayed the intent to attack one of them again. Sherlock had no chance of matching his strength, but John, however, could. John placed his hands in the air to prove that he was not the enemy. Similar as to how Sherlock interacted with John on the night they first met.
The way John’s chest heaved, his eyes became hysterical, he was scared, confused, but it had nothing to do with the kidnapping.
“You will address me as 'Sir'” he declared with a plain tone, “If you turn out to have specific kinks, we might change it, but I expect you to use it, especially if you have to ask me something or you are being punished” he continued.
“Sir,” he started, his voice sounded pleading, a bit more than a whisper, he stopped, did he really deserve it? Would John refused as he had ruined the scene already, maybe he had screwed up his chance, “What is it, pet?” the Doctor encouraged him, he had noticed the blue eyes had been staring at the crop. Sherlock licked his lips, trying to find his words again “Would you please use it on me?”
Sherlock had been suspended from the case, with the order to go home, get himself set, and ready to behave like a civilized person again.
The panted shrieks each blow provoked were a true blessing and each time the sub exposed himself a bit more, going liquid beneath the pain that he was inflicting, he could feel he was losing his mind.
His brain was trying to wrap around what had happened, the memories of just moments before were a vague and confusing mix of sensations than the rather very objective record he was used to.
“It wouldn't be very professional to let my own tastes influence your training, would it?” he said with a malicious grin, pulling the boy's hair once more before letting him go.
Sherlock was looking down, quite annoyed by the situation and feeling odd to be kneeling in front of anyone else's eyes but John's. The two continued their small chattering, that Sherlock deliberately ignored, and eventually Mrs. Hudson left, twittering a goodbye.
“I couldn't believe it,” said Victor, sitting in his living room, showing a newspaper article about one of the latest Sherlock's cases, “My old friend, the famous detective” he laughed “quite a leap from pirate”  he added with his sweet smile.
While Sherlock weakly fought the two big men lifting his thin body like a doll, Mycroft had given Greg his business card, ordering him to call him sooner next time.
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his head and he straightened his spine, he looked at John with rage as his ear, finally released, was throbbing painfully.
Sherlock fell asleep in John's arms. The Dom had kissed and praised him until the exhausted sub had let himself slip in dreams.
John's caressed his burning red cheeks, and then a finger entered in Sherlock's entrance, gradually opening him. The friction of his tight dry hole made the sub grunt with clenched teeth, and as John stroked his cock a few more times with force, it became blissfully hurting.
Mycroft  had chuckled, condescending as usual, making Sherlock roll his eyes “Don't be naive, Sherlock” the older Holmes had said “Dominants don't put locks to close things,” he had explained, talking as to a particularly slow child, “They put locks to remind submissives they are not in charge, not even over their own bodies.”
He could hear John's movements, alert as he inevitably tried to deduct what was going to happen next, his heart was flying with feared anticipation of the unknown. John contemplated him for long, he kept teasing him with the crop, Sherlock's favorite implement so far. He watched amused Sherlock pricked his ears, like a cat would, as he heard something metallic tingling. As the cold touched his nipples, Sherlock moved back, the crop fell again on his thigh, the same spot as before. The sub let out a sound that was close enough as an apology.
Sherlock frowned, suddenly more awake from the sweet pause the lunch had been, he frowned, he still wanted John's comfort but the voice of the doctor had intrigued his deepest need and had made his heart throb, “Yes, Sir” he answered.
When the sub had told it to the Doctor, with a childish pout as he complained of the pain, the Dom had laughed and kissed his niplles, brushing away a bit of Sherlock's resentment.
“I'm sorry, baby brother, if I seemed I was mocking you,” Mycroft suddenly said, “I was just satisfied to see my investment is going so well” he was smiling broadly, smugging “I'm just sorry we didn't found you sooner, Doctor Watson” he added, “you clearly are who he needs."
Sherlock looked at it, a voice in his head urged him to protest, despite he knew that would mean further punishment, a slithering voice craved for that idea, it would maybe make him return in that sweet soft bubble he had been into, where everything of this seemed so easy and pleasant. But he wanted to return in John's arms, to cling against him again as if his little trip to the restroom had separated them for an eternity, so he just rolled his eyes and knelt.
Sorry if I hadn't updated for a while and that the last 2 chapters plus this one are basically a single scene, I had this in mind for so long but University's finals made me write so slowly.
He tried to calm his breathing, the explosions had followed him in the awakening and were still echoing in his head.
He had crawled with wobbling arms and shaking knees, he had been scared at the idea the plug would go out as he moved but it just didn't.
“I apologize for the quite abrupt way our first face to face encounter happened,” he said, “but see, it was important to not get my brother suspicious, he had always had the tendency to antagonize every attempt I do on his behalf,” he said with an exasperated tone.
The detective had been shifting in and out from his Mind Palace for some time, unable to stay so long still in a place but not daring to move from the position John had told him to greet him in.
“I wanted to know if I got it right” Sherlock answered, shrugging a bit as if he couldn't see the reason for John's rage.
A coarse jute rope scratched his wrists, securing them together, stretching his arms towards the bed frame. He heard the ropes running through the bed's bars, and the tension holding him in place as Greg tied him to the bed.
Sherlock was panting around the gag ball, his cock was hard, fully erected, and covered with John's saliva, his skin was pearled with sweat.
The metal was cold, and, as it touched the inside of his thighs, the sub flinched a bit. John brushed his cock, caressing him as he fastened the metal ring around its base, and he chuckled as he grabbed the sub's testicles making Sherlock really jump this time.
He knew it was too soon, that doing so would be reckless damage to Sherlock's training purpose, he had to go gradually, he repeated himself.
“Does he think you are the killer or is he just looking for someone similar to himself who would be able to finally ‘see’?” Hannibal asked quietly, his eyes, as always, were the only ones to betray his emotions: his endless curiosity was sparkling in them behind the immovable expression, studying the younger man moving uncomfortably in his chair. Will looked at him for a long moment, then looked away again.
John seemed to reflect a bit, taking pleasure in the impatient trepidation that his pause had caused on the sub, waiting worryingly, as he would refuse, maybe even mock his request “Are you going to behave?” he asked, danger permeating his tone.
Sherlock heard himself letting out noises of complaint and pleasure mixing together, his mouth had opened and he could feel saliva starting to drool from his mouth, his eyes, at first shouted with force, had rolled up. His legs were trembling with electric numbness, melting.
“Up, back on your knees again, Sherlock,” John said, “I will deal with you later if you manage to act civil” he added darkly.
“Now, Sherlock,” John said returning to relax on the couch's seatback “I know what happened to you and that your last encounter with 'one of my kind' wasn't pleasant,” he told him emphasizing the detective's words, “You went through a pretty traumatizing experience.” Sherlock's mouth tightened,
The sub waited, his heart pumping fast in his chest, the bubble had returned to embrace him even if it was different from before, less foggy and more sharpened with stingily pure sex.
The sub's teeth bit the sheets, his eyes opened wide as his breath was taken away.  John's hand grabbed his, forcing his arm to bend over his back, interlacing his fingers with his own, reassuring and yet possessive. His cock entered him repeatedly, in and out with more and more force, John's grunts mixed with Sherlock's moans turning in screams as he went rougher and the bed cracking.
The day after John had brought him a gift, “I just saw it and thought about you” he had said simply, offering Sherlock, who had been kneeling like a good boy at the Dom's entrance, a plastic shop bag.
He pictured himself in the corner like a naughty schoolboy caught chatting out of turn during class, he could feel the thin line the crop had left,  or at least he tried to, the heat had gone so long ago and part of him was rationally sure nothing was left on him of that first and only bite he had of the crop's sting. He wished there were more, a fading heat on him to be his companion during his solitude.
When they had first met, Greg had been sure Mycroft was just playing with him, using him to fulfill his physiological needs. No shame in that, many subs and Doms overcame their need for play with occasional partners and scenes, but Greg had always been quite old fashioned, his dominance was about real trust, obedience, and commitment. He still laughed remembering Mycroft's face when he had refused his invitation.
Victor had walked into his flat and asked for help. He had aged up pretty well, and now he was wearing a ginger beard that Sherlock hadn't been sure he liked, but the Detective had recognized his green eyes immediately.
The view of the submissive, going deeper and deeper in that gray state of mind, bending to his requests, and giving his obedience was hard to ignore. He would have liked to make a point of not watching at him, the deliberate lack of attention was the real core of this kind of punishment after all, but his glare would constantly drove back to the sub.
John smiled widely, those words falling deeply in him, filling his cock. He bent, reaching for Sherlock's ear, “Come for me, then” he whispered, and the sub did, collapsing flat on the table.
John sighed deeply, caressing his curls, “Suck me, boy” he said, biting his lips, feeling the warmth of Sherlock's mouth around him and his tongue stroking delicately his length.
Sherlock had never had a friend before, or at least that's what he kept repeating himself. Despite John stubbornly calling Greg his friend, the detective had just seen their relationship as a simple mutual benefit: Greg would give him his drug, solving crimes, a purpose, something to shut up the number of voices boredom would bring in his head, and Greg could use him to solve the mess his incompetence did. Plus he was the reason he had met his submissive.
John pulled his ear down, forcing him to his knees, “We are not playing, Sherlock” the doctor said, “Heel” he commanded sharply.
Dominants were used to the idea, radicated even in the most progressive ones by porn and media, that subs were just a little more than a walking fuck toy, that they would bend to their Dominant voice, trembling to submit at their power. With his sub certificate, Mycroft wasn't considered a threat anymore, and that had been by far his biggest advantage, that allowed him to climb in the darkness the stairs to reach a power that would probably be unreachable without becoming a target by any Dominant.
The sub hands were trembling as he reached for his own buckle, he made the leather run through the belt loops, he folded it in half before handing it with both hands and head bowed to his Dom.
“Hush,” John reproached with a low whisper, and the sub cut off immediately, arching his head back as he felt his cock surrounded by John's warm mouth.
That made Sherlock's pupils grow bigger, he felt cold needles tingling on his face, his breath was starting to stumble again, not from rage but excitement. He leaned against John's hand.
And now, there he was, penitent as the worst sinner. He had started sniffing a while ago, as on the verge of tears. That had increased John's arousal, even more, he wanted to caress that hair and pulling them at the same time, to comfort him and punish him more, to comply with Sherlock's desire to be fucked tenderly and powerfully.
The doorbell woke up Sherlock. He jumped up from the arms holding him, watching then confused at John, and frowning as he felt the pain on his backside. He could feel the lube and cum had dried out on his skin, unpleasantly.
A young woman looked at him for a split second, the phone at her side had been ringing for a while now “The queue is right there, sir” she said, pointing at the end of the line and giving them an almost despising glare as they didn’t move. Sherlock was standing where he was, ignoring the order of the woman to go away and the protests becoming more and more colourful by the minute behind them.
As John managed to pull Sherlock away, with all the intention to drag him forcibly back in line if necessary, looking worried at the numerous guards who were now watching them, she finally picked up the phone.
Being classified as submissive had been a shock for him, and he didn't enjoy being surprised, he had been tempted to ask a second test, but hormones didn't lie, he was a sub, a sub that as far as he could remember had always enjoyed being in power.
“Yes, as in the USA Maryland,” the detective repeated, raising his eyebrow as he always did when anyone asked him a stupid question. John raised his head, looking at the greyish white sky of London.
Sherlock heard distantly the moans that were inevitable drove out his mouth, getting louder with every smack. His brain was failing for a change to keep up with the situation, all he could felt was the warm sensation building slowly upon his backside by the second, turning sometimes into pain, his toes were sloping on the wooden floor, occasionally kicking the air to fall again on the ground.
When finally John seemed contempt with the state of the room, he sat on the armchair and invited the sub on his lap. Sherlock crawled to him, climbing to his lap, and let a grunt as he sat on the man's legs. John embraced him tenderly.
Mycroft's cold smile fell, for a moment John's could see traces of Sherlock's temper on his face, but then the sub chuckled, “I understand, Doctor,” he said, “I'm glad to hear my brother is in such caring hands,” he stated, “however,” his tone changed, he wasn't wearing the well-mannered facade anymore, he was chilling and sharp “I don't want you to think I don't realize the delicate situation my brother had managed to put himself in and the vulnerable state he is in.”
He pushed the sub's head against his crotch, feeling Sherlock inhaling deeply, sensing his smell and his hardening cock, “Use that beautiful mouth of yours,” he murmured.
Sherlock wanted to beg for it being used on him, the idea of it being humiliating seemed so far that it sounded ridiculous and insignificant, despite his breath had calmed down and he was starting to feel himself a bit, not the little brat he had been during the corner time anymore.
John grasped his hard cock. The sub gulped with a panted breath, immediately stopping his trashing and tensing rigidly, “You are not taking this very gracefully, are you, boy?” he asked tauntingly. Sherlock didn't answer, limiting himself to let a huff in the pillow beneath him.
“I won't ask you to hurt me” he finally managed to say, his voice was more pinched that he had intended to, his mouth had gone dry.
Silence fell for a few seconds, Sherlock could hear his own heart pumping, his ear was still hurting and every muscle of his body was tensing, he didn't seem able to calm his breath as much as he tried. He focused his gazed on John's shoes, he had seen anger and disappointment in the Dom's eyes that had stroke him deep in his soul.
When John stopped, Sherlock was sure that if he would be able to talk he would have begged him, with any promise, to continue, to use him until his entire interiors were on fire and his hole sore, but all he did was gasping, his head had raised a bit, his body wanting to follow back John's hand.
“Are you going to punish me?” he asked with a whisper. Donovan's face returned to torment him, her smile as she had seen the effect of her dominant voice and her words had had on him, “Yes, pet” John said “Not because you got angry and yelled, I am glad you told me what was wrong,” he added, “But for cursing at me and pickpocketing Greg.”
He was giving the blows full force, accompanying with his body the swats, and as Sherlock's started to sob within screams, his cock got hard, pressing against the fabric of his trousers.
Sherlock felt the Dom's gaze uneasy on him, he moved his eyes away. His heartbeat had started pounding again against his chest, he could feel his eyes growing bigger and cold needles tingling his cheekbones.
Despite Sherlock's love for spanking, his fondness for the belt wasn't so deep, as John had soon found out, so they had kept that instrument for real punishments only. Besides, now that they had decided for daily maintenance spanking, the detective had started to crave impact play a bit less, not that he didn't enjoy it anymore, more like that he felt that weird need a bit smoother now.
He was kissing him, praising him with murmured words, and ensuring his total and earned forgiveness.  Sherlock let himself to be hugged, he nuzzled his face in the Doctor's soft cardigan, inhaling deeply as the sobs subsided, not quite ready to see the world yet.
The detective's eyes sharpened at the mocking tone, the Dom continued “Is that what you want? To be beaten, I mean?”
Ten minutes had passed since he heard either of the men speak or fix another drink. He got up and moved towards the window and saw that the carriage was not there. They were gone! How long had they been here before he returned? Were they waiting for him before they departed? He supposed so, he was something of their guard dog once they were away. They never included him in their travels, save for this one to Switzerland. They only left him behind and expected him to be there when they returned. It was so lonely. At Baker Street, he was never alone, if John was absent from the flat then Sherlock would be there. Sherlock was not so keen to conversation as John was, but it was still company. The alternate was same if Sherlock were away except John would read to him and converse with him about everything. A single tear fell from his eye. He wanted to be gone from this place, to be free of Moriarty and Thomas. One more visit would not hurt. It would be quicker now, he knew where they were, he could be quick. He only wanted John to smile at him again, and to tell him how smart he was, and how much he missed him. He wanted to watch Sherlock fuss with whatever kept him occupied, see him wake in the morning with mussed hair and bleary eyes.
Sherlock huffed and placed a hand on his hip. Must John be so difficult today? It only took a moment to cook the food, Sherlock had not required John’s assistance in the past, and he would not require it now. John only smiled and kissed him again.
That was when Sally walked over to the bars, her long, thin fingers wrapping around the dark metal bars.
“As I said, it took some time before I completed the construction of your body. You did not wake as I so hoped you would. It tormented me to realize that all of my work, the risk to which I put my health, was all for naught. Mentally, I was in worse shape than I am now, and I have you to thank for the improvement. I could not take it anymore, John. Furious, I grabbed your body off of the cot that it had laid upon for days and carried your limp, heavy body down the stairs where I flung it into the darkness of the night and left you. I berated myself for thinking that such a foolish plan would ever work, that you would ever receive the life that I yearned for you to have. It was with a heavy heart that I dragged myself to bed and cried the most bitter tears I have never thought myself capable. I watched as the rain raged on outside and wept even harder at the sadness that tugged at my heart. You were a failure, as far as I knew,  and thus so was I. To this very day I am not sure what bid you wake, perhaps it was the lighting that came crashing down dangerously close to the building, or maybe I did not have enough faith in your birth. You did it, John. You found your way to me and although you could neither speak nor even walk properly, I knew that you would be everything I could ever hope for in a companion. Falling so deeply in love with you, however, came as a surprise even to me. Please accept my sincerest apologies for hurting you that night. I was drained and you did stagger in as a burglar would.”
I know most people don't read long notes, but it is of great importance that you do read the note at the beginning.
Sherlock seemed to bloom with that question. “Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight! That's the frailty of genius, John; it needs an audience.”
“Hey, I'm just happy you're having a good influence like him around you. You've seemed a lot more content for the last year and honestly, we don't need you going back to the whole drugs-business.” Greg ended in a much more serious tone.
. He knew it was rubbish, but Sherlock thinking John did god-knows-what behind his back kind of made him feel betrayed in a sense that made him feel sick. Sick for thinking Sherlock could ever see the possibility John would betray him. On the other hand, he really couldn't blame him. Sherlock never had much grounds to trust anyone and recent events hadn't exactly done much to help in that matter.
“An Omega Purist, to be precise, yes.” Sherlock add nonchalantly, though the way he was looking at John had shifted. He still didn't look unkind. “Don't put up pretence apology where you don't honestly feel sorry. You are free to leave at any time, but I would advice you to wait until I have dismantled the auction society.” the Alpha concluded smoothly, standing up just as the doorbell rang, but instead of going to open it, Sherlock jotted down some notes on a piece of paper and folded it. Seconds later steps on the stairs became audible, even and steady. John turned around in the red armchair to see a tall man appear in the doorway. He was the same height as Sherlock, though older than him, but the cold, blue eyes were about the same. The visitor eyed him with the same analytical stare that Sherlock seemed to be applying constantly and while it was utterly emotionless, it bore no resentment. The new Alpha looked vastly superior, not because of his gender, but because of his almost tangible intellect. John dared to think this man was even cleverer than Sherlock, who was already impressive beyond fiction. Another person entered the room, a female Omega. Her presence threw John off entirely. She was smartly dressed, carrying a bag that she put on the floor near the door and pulled out a smartphone. She began tapping away on it, seemingly ignoring the rest of the room, even the Alpha, who John assumed was her employer, as he couldn't smell an intermingling of their scents like a bond would create. He could barely grasp the concept of her rudeness in the face of
a freak!” he spat, stopping only when he felt John's hand on his lower back, the warmth it was radiating gradually pulling him out of his anger. He regarded his shorter mate in confusion at first before realising. “I'm good. I'm.. fine.” Sherlock fended off, straightening himself. “Laptop, Smartphone, Tablet?”
“You didn't want an Omega child. You were so looking forward to that little Alpha baby, that you almost forgot about the other one. The stronger one. You tried to starve him so you wouldn't even have to look at him once. Only that backfired, didn't it? You killed the one child you wanted and then blamed it on an innocent pup. It was too late to get an abortion and putting up Purists for adoption isn't possible. You were stuck with him. Stuck with that child that killed your true little love. You couldn't just kill Tommy, though, could you? That would have been too humane. You wanted him to suffer. You broke up with your partner and soon got with that Beta, who just so happened to be part of London's underground world; of the human auctioning society more specifically. That would be the perfect fate for this boy.” John's breathing was audible in the narrow room the others were watching, his anger increasing the intensity of each breath.
He grew increasingly lethargic, staying in, wasting away in front of the telly. He wouldn't eat if Mrs Hudson wouldn't be positively feeding him up. Mind you, he was grateful for that. He had been underweight when he'd moved in and, regarding the progression of his pregnancy, he could never catch up on his current ideal weight, but Sherlock's landlady and, as John viewed her, optional mother made a point out of keeping him and his unborn pups alive. He was getting chubby. He knew it would be visible once he'd given birth. He knew he was disgusting and he felt it: A lazy, stay at home Omega, not doing any house work, sitting and eating, watching crap telly all day long. He wanted Sherlock to throw him out. At least then he could be angry at someone else.
John looked at him in amazement. “You'd still want me around for that? I, er.. I don't really know...”
“I don't want to get up.” Sherlock simply replied and it seemed to be enough. John got off the bed and left the room. The Omega stretched and lazily sat up in bed. John returned with two plates. Sherlock was happy to see both plates had at least a reasonable amount of food on them, though it wasn't hard to guess which one was for him.
If by now no one had come in to talk to him, but had left food when he was asleep, no one would come as long as he was conscious, so, he figured, he'd dive into his mind palace for a bit, appearing to be asleep.
“John.” an even voice addressed him. Sherlock. He wasn't even looking at John, continued touching himself. “Whatever you're doing, stop it, or shut me out. I'm kind of enjoying myself here, I don't need your distress.”
“You know love,” John began as one of his hands carded through the dark curls, massaging the scalp, “it's not so much that I resent the idea of having you take me or even, though I don't particularly fancy it as far as I know, carry your child, should that even be compatible between us. No, it's you trying to decide my life all by yourself-”
When John could hear cruel beeping and the rough bursts of his own breath, he snapped to attention, instinct calling out on what he had witnessed right before he passed out like the useless Alpha trash he was. The male nurse was over him immediately gently pushing him back to lay him on the pillow again. “Come on Doctor Watson, back down. You look like you haven't slept in a while and-”
“Why, because you're a middle-aged gorgeous Omega doctor slash single father and absolute DILF, if you don't mind the directness?”
to go down. It wasn't fair, making assumptions like this. It was probably nothing. A man needed his space. Sherlock could understand that. He wouldn't want to be linked to and think about his mate in hospital at all hours of the day either – what a bleak world that would be.
They got a picture of the, unusually big, bundle of cells with them to be able to see developments over time and to compare the picture of this current state with the ones that were yet to come.
However, when John spoke, it was with a voice unusually deep, but no less soft than when he was proud of Sherlock's deductions or when he's done something socially adequate. “Sherlock, I want you to know, that you needn't feel either humiliated nor, in any way, guilty, alright? I know-”
John frowned and looked up at Sherlock, only then realising that Sherlock honestly didn't know what John wanted to do, although he had a strong hunch that he wanted it himself as well.
“How badly must you have been treated for being an Omega that you would do such a thing to a child?!”
“John?! Hang on, what?! Why? Is Sherlock there?! John, don't go in alone. Wait there for us! Do you hear me? Do
Walking the distance to the door and back, Sherlock almost collapsed back into bed, had he not been careful with their pups and John guided him slowly.
“Yeah, see you.” Sherlock hung up. John lowered the phone and took a deep breath. He was both relieved that his pups were going to be in good hands and a bit tense about not being able to see them and having someone else do his job for him. It couldn't be helped, however, so he went into the contacts and called the nursery.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Before last week you seemed quite anti the idea. What's that change of heart all about?”
Sherlock leaned forward and turned John's head with his hand to kiss him fondly. “I just did it, though. I had your cock in my mouth and my fingers up your arse and you loved it!” he murmured, making John blush.
Anyone hoping for some dark!Sherlock or non-con/rape between the two, will be disappointed. That was never my plan and will not happen in this fic! I'm sorry to have potentially mislead you in that way.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned around. “Whatever. Give it a week or a good case and it will be the same again, I don't care.” he put on the kettle. He sounded like he did, in fact, care a lot. “Tea or coffee?”
4 times! Didn't you see her chewing on her bottom lip? Someone wearing lipstick regularly doesn't move their lips in that fashion – she was anxious, has been for a couple of days. She tasted the lipstick every time she wore it off her lips and simply stopped putting it on. Breaking a habit like this takes a few days, if not weeks. When I saw her first, she was still wearing some though, so there must have been a trigger
The time between John leaving with all his pups and returning without them was a rare case of blurred memories. Something about adopting dogs, he thinks. Or maybe that was a metaphor. He doesn't remember and it scares him a little.
Sherlock gave a long, suffering sigh at that. “Hormones, I should think. Absolutely irrational, again, but there you go.” Again, he caught his hand hovering over his slightly bulging middle, shielding it protectively. When he saw John's sympathetic look, he rolled his eyes and placed his hand on the armrest in a slightly exaggerated movement. “There is nothing wrong, John. Neither the babies nor I are in any way dissatisfied.”
He turned Sherlock back on his side. The Omega winced with a bite of pain. “I love you.” he said after a pause and, feeling his heart swell as he thought it over, he found he meant it.
Sherlock smiled at him cheekily and John gave one of his small smiles as well. The Omega tugged at his hand a little, so he leant down and kissed him, feeling the slight tremble against his lips and the tense breathing against his cheek. Most importantly, though, he felt glad. So, so glad.
“No, Sherlock's been.. a really good friend. He's helped me a lot. I couldn't be a father today if he hadn't gotten me out of there.” John was still not looking at either of them and was now debating whether or not to wipe his eyes. He didn't want to show tears like he'd suffered the world's worst fate, but bringing his hand up would only draw attention to it. He decided to dab at his eyes the same moment a tear managed to escape. “Please don't tell anyone. If people knew-”
“You're not thinking of breaking the bond?” John asked in serious and unconsciously threatening voice.
“Well, there would be other effects, no? I can hardly imagine running around London, chasing criminals with a pup either cradled in my belly or strapped to my chest. And I don't suppose you'd appreciate taking it to crime scenes, although I can't see what would be so terrible about a child being confronted with death and dangers of crimes at a young age – teaches them early and prevents the delusion of a 'wonderful, fluffy, full of love' world-”
“John, I am already stuffing myself like a turkey for Christmas dinner, could you please stop fattening me any more!” he snapped back in a whisper, earning himself an offended stare from John. “John, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sn-”
your place into my heart or however people say things like these. It is hard to win a sociopath's trust; much more so to stir their feelings in a way you did and still do with me. I have to warn you, however: If a sociopath forms a bond of any sort with someone, they don't let go.”
John lay his hand against Sherlock's neck, covering his most sensitive and intimate gland to comfort him. “I know. It's okay, the police will take care of her now.” he whispered back and Sherlock positively slumped against him in sudden relief.
John leaned forward, standing up and approaching him over the one foot distance. “Sherlock, are you al-... Jeeeesus!” he breathed, swaying in his step even though it was the only one he needed to take. His scent was released, then.
, I cannot guarantee to not rage against you and I don't know if you've ever witnessed an alpha soldier's rage, but I'm sure you wouldn't want to.” And John didn't even know he made Mycroft uncomfortable, which was exactly the reason Mycroft felt the need to display superiority and failing, even to John eyes.
John huffed an embarrassed laugh. “There's no saving me.” He opened his eyes and his gaze instantly fell down Sherlock's front, taking in the bump and, beyond, where he was still holding his cock. “Sorry.” he mumbled, resuming his actions, kissing that sweet spot on Sherlock's neck, right next to the bite, to build up the mood again, which wasn't too necessary yet. The Omega appreciated it largely nonetheless. Two minutes later John had his mate slumping back into him a little, coming with a soft moan.
“What?! How could an Omega chop up another person?! And how do you know?” Lestrade asked disbelievingly.
He knew he shouldn't enter, he really did, but, honestly, the auction society was cracked and John was immensely bored. He didn't have a job and couldn't begin to hope to get one in his condition, and Sherlock, after solving the case and staying awake for what looked to John like
That is how, that night, Sherlock ended up pushing himself atop John, a fair make out session from their usual sleeping positions continuing. Sherlock could tell John was willing himself to relax, which, in turn, only made him all the more stiff, and not in the good way. ”Relax,” he whispered as he lowered his head kissing the spot on John's neck that was the equivalent of an Omega's scent gland. It didn't have the anatomy of an Omega's spot, but great sensitivity was a remnant of human evolution; not to mention that John really enjoyed the back of his neck being kissed.
“Listen, mate, we don't need your cooing; we don't need your arrogance, we have been doing very well on our own these last 15 months. If we needed or wanted an Alpha, we'd both have gotten one before we started a relationship and most definitely before we got pregnant, get that?! Good, now get your sorry arse away from here before I break your arms and your stupid alpha ego!” with that, John let go of his arm. The Alpha bumped into his belly on his first attempt of fleeing the aggressive Omega, rounding it on his second and cursing back at him, calling him a 'filthy Omega slut' among other things, to which John reacted by almost going after him, though Sherlock held him back by the shoulder.
“But I tell you: he did!” Sherlock insisted, not understanding why John refused to accept what has happened. Was he not attractive enough to get flirted at any more or what?
The Omega frowned again. “Yes, I believe I said that.” he said with a huff of annoyance at having to repeat himself
She took and released a drag from her cigarette, shaking her head fondly. “You have the looks of an accomplished person.” He laughed in flattered uncertainty. “So you're a doctor and a father, huh? But a friend is taking care of your children for you... your partner die?”
The DI scratched his head and pondered for a moment. When Sherlock left the flat a few minutes later, appearing very weird to John's judgement, the police team finally retreated.
“No, as a parent, one is always responsible for their children, there's no doubt in that, but you aren't their clown. It's not your job to entertain them all waking hours, even beside daycare. Look at them now, they are perfectly content playing on their own. All you need to do is trust more in your instincts and tone down your alertness. Responsibility, yes, but you're being a little to tense about it. Allow yourself to relax a little, please.”
“How dare you! He's my son! I won't be accused of such things and I won't say another word without my lawyer!”
Sherlock, who'd let himself drop back into his leather armchair to wax his violin bow, looked back up sharply. “This is
“No, I'm fine.” Sherlock replied, pulling at his shirt to close it by the buttons. “It may be wise to shop for bigger clothing, though.” he remarked and, having managed to do the first few buttons up and seeing how the fabric stretched to actually show skin, opened the shirt again to grab a t-shirt instead.
John reached out with his free hand, palming his cheek and wiping at the tear that forced its way out.
“Oh, well..” she started, clearly taken by surprise herself. “In that case, Mr. Holmes, chances are rather high, depending on the exact amount and kind you have been doing.. But so far your body seems reasonably healthy, which could be a side-effect of your secondary gender having washed through you, cleaned up this and that. Omegas tend to have a good self-resolving system. You won't go without long term effects, that's for sure, but you might be lucky and fairly well reconstructed.” she explained, lastly switching on the machine and turning it away from their eyes, clearly wanting to prevent unprepared shock and drama.
He felt John's hands coming around to cup his rear and Sherlock reached down cupped and massaged John's cock through his denim trousers, firing up the sparking desire he had seen in John's eyes just a couple of seconds before.
The Alpha was fighting the urge to grip at Sherlock's hair, obviously so since he fisted the cushions with all the self-control he could hold up, while his head was tossing from side to side and he mewled and gasped and grunted and moaned helplessly, his legs tensing around Sherlock's body. He was close, apparently and the Omega wished to spare him any more teasing, so he squeezed his hand around the tissue that covered John's knot, hollowed his cheeks almost violently and pushed hard against his prostate simultaneously, John arching off the seat with a sharp cry.
“Yes, what a terrible odour suppressants can produce.” Mycroft said with clear sarcasm tingeing his voice.
“Really, Sherlock, we are so glad we finally got to see you again and to meet your mate. And we are so excited,” she announced, hugging John and kissing his cheek, then cupping his face, “for the arrival of those four little angels. We can hardly wait to get to know them!” She wore a wide grin on her face. John noticed now, what it was beneath their scents that he was so familiar with – it was their family-scent, the unique smell of their family-line. It was comforting. So comforting.
When John came home, it was already dark. He walked into the sitting room, and Sherlock was no longer absorbed with case files, but walking out of the bathroom, a towel around his waist. “John, you’re empty-handed,” he frowned. “Where were you all this time?”
They fell into silence, and there was intimacy in this setting. It wasn’t sexual, but Sherlock was allowing himself to be vulnerable in front of John, and like the past two nights, John felt his stomach clench with compassion, and couldn’t keep his mind off the past.
John looked through the box, “Lestrade’s is here, Molly’s…” His hand stopped when he saw the single red rose, and the card that had come with it was now tied to the stem. Damn. He’d forgotten about that.
“Why?” Sherlock sat up straight, putting his fingers together in a steeple for comfort. He needed to stay calm.
John held his face lovingly. “Like I said, it’ll take us time to get there,” he said, moving in for Sherlock’s lips again, “but tell me how I can begin to make us right.”
Sherlock allowed himself to hope, perhaps foolishly so, that with no baby tying him to Mary, John would leave her. They weren’t happy, and Sherlock knew it. John had told him he was only going back for the baby. No baby means no marriage. Right? Seems logical enough.
“No, don’t be stupid,” Sherlock perked up. “It feels like I haven’t had a case in a decade! You’ve got the files, yes? Bring them here.”
“That’s good.” His hand slid to the top of his chair, but he still didn’t sit down, and his posture was still stiff.
“Of course,” she said. “I want to keep him here for a few days for observation, but he should go home at the end of the week. I’ll leave you two now,” she said with a light smile.
“Hmph.” John scratched at his jaw, feeling the stubble he didn’t have time to shave away. He supposed that he could hold his tongue, too, somewhat. Sherlock probably wouldn’t appreciate a full on bashing of Irene. He could keep his mouth shut a little, but only for his sake. “Well, think whatever you want of her. I won’t judge. I just can’t respect a person like her, but that’s just me.”
And yet...he could try, couldn’t he? He could try to make things like they were before. It would be even harder now with the memories of his timeline burned into his mind, but Sherlock wanted to start a new chapter of his life with John. He couldn’t act like a depressed, pouting child.
“Maybe you should wipe off,” John chuckled, “and I need to rinse my mouth out before I can kiss you again.”
“How long was I gone?” he asked aloud. He would have to check the date in a minute. But for right now, he arranged Rosie so his arms were supporting her bum, and she was almost eye level with him. He took in her face, which he hadn’t seen in person for months. “You’re even prettier than I remembered,” he stroked her chubby cheek with his thumb.
“And I’m a widower who stayed married to an assassin until her dying breath!” John threw his hands in the air. “At least your situation is bloody normal.”
John nudged his foot again. “Don’t beat yourself up over it, Sherlock.” He studied his face. “I know you by now, even if my memory is wonky, and I know you wouldn’t enter a relationship with someone so soon.” He snorted. “I’m still shocked you’re married to me.”
“That’s fucked up. Hey, I know you’re comfortable, and I love holding you, but with a broken nose, you should be more elevated.”
Then, it hit him like a ton of bricks. Lestrade heard Culverton make Sherlock confess that he loved John. Lestrade heard it. He called John.
Sherlock’s insides rolled with repulsion. It reminded him of when Magnussen came into his hospital room, touching him while he was drugged, semi-conscious, and helpless. This felt eerily similar. Sherlock gulped.
John rolled his eyes. “I suspected that much.” He pulled her back so he could look at her again. “Huh, it’s almost like she has my nose.”
John smiled a little. It felt like a barrier between them was destroyed. They were finally okay. “I’m happy you let me see that side of you. I know it wasn’t easy for you to do.”
John rubbed his eye. “I didn’t know what else to do,” he said honestly. “You needed to know the truth.” He felt so hollow. He couldn’t muster up the energy for anything but resignation.
Sherlock would play along for a moment. “I see. Did you take any interest in a patient recently, or notice that one had taken an interest in you?”
Lestrade finally called with an interesting case fifteen minutes ago. Sherlock texted John four times and called him twice, but there was no answer. Sherlock had pouted and stormed out of his flat with a huff, walking to the edge of the sidewalk and raising his arm to hail down a cab. John couldn’t ignore him that easily. It was childish, he knew, but he hadn’t seen John in a little while, not since Mary announced that she lost the baby.
This email was shorter and angrier than the last, and Sherlock found his response this time around harder to compose. He was glad they were doing this over email, at least, so he didn’t have to see the hatred in John’s eyes or the coldness of his voice. He wasn’t really surprised to learn that John didn’t want to go back to mary, but his question stabbed his gut: why didn’t Sherlock tell him anything? Why did he never let him in? It was completely valid, and it now dawned upon him that if he had just been honest from the very beginning, starting with Moriarty, that they would have never been in this situation. It was truly Sherlock’s fault. If only he let John in like a normal person instead of blocking him with all of the carefully constructed walls he built up starting in childhood. He imagined an alternative reality where he informed John of his plan with Moriarty. John would have waited for him to return from Eastern Europe, and his hard-to-earn trust would have never been broken. Perhaps he would not have sought out comfort and company in Mary if he knew Sherlock would one day come back to him. Sherlock had so foolishly and selfishly thought he would have been welcomed back from the dead with open arms. He was the most idiotic genius on the planet.
John was breathing out of his mouth, and he felt a presence. He looked up and couldn’t stop himself from rolling his eyes. “God, Sherlock, let me be, would you?”
John saw this as his opportunity to leave. “No, um, I should get going,” he stood up. “I’ve stayed a good bit, and I shouldn’t overstay my welcome.”
Sherlock made a sound of negation and went back to kissing him, feeling himself grow harder in John’s hand. His nipples were hard and his nerves were singing with pleasure, but he needed more pressure (god, John was right. He really didn’t last very long, did he? Not in the morning, at least). “John, can I?”
Sherlock stiffened, surprised, but he walked over and sat down next to John, sitting up straight, his hands clasped together tightly.
“But let’s talk more about you,” Culverton said. “That John Watson really means a lot to you.” It wasn’t a question.
John sighed. “I don’t mean you’re not extraordinary, Sherlock, because you know you are with that bloody brain of yours. But, your emotions? I know you have them, Sherlock, and they’re not a weakness.”
“Because after what I’ve done to you, you’d have a right to hurt me!” he threw his hands in the air, growing irritated, an angry, embarrassed flush to his cheeks.
“Why?” John asked, still speaking at a normal volume. “So you can tell me how fun it was to sneak up on a man and shoot him in his own bloody bedroom?”
Sherlock’s lips quivered, and his fingers gripped John’s hair tighter as he hid his face in his neck.
Tears stung behind Sherlock’s eyelids. John turned his life around in a way no one else could. John was his conductor of light, his heart, his soul. He brought out the best in him, made Sherlock be a better man, better than he ever thought he could be. John was his favorite person.
John thought that if he talked down upon himself, she would be convinced to leave. “Look, Mary, to be honest, you deserve better than me. If we were to keep going out, I’d barely be home.”  That was true. He was out with Sherlock on a case the day she went into labor with Rosie. He couldn’t stay away from Sherlock. He knew that now.
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ve been worse.” He didn’t like this feeling of fear and exhaustion, but he figured that there was no point in stalling. “Let’s get ready.”
What was he doing? Why was he letting the Woman come between them? Didn’t he want to do better? John didn’t know what she was playing at, but he wasn’t going to let her keep them apart. Sherlock was doing something nice by letting her stay with him, and John had no right to isolate him for that. Besides, if Sherlock was interested in her--he couldn’t fault him for that, either, as much as it pained him. Friends were supposed to support each other.
Sherlock huffed and he worked at the last button. “Waste of time,” he mumbled, a distinct, embarrassed blush reaching his cheekbones.
Sherlock downed the tablets, holding up an index finger to tell John to wait, and gulped them down with the water. “If I move slowly or stay still, manageable,” he said once his mouth was free. “The pain increases when I try to move quickly or stand too long.”
He stood in silence, back against the wall, and couldn’t bring himself to be amused by Sherlock’s drugged, slurred ramblings to Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade. He supposed this was better than last time, when Mary was visiting him and pretending she was innocent as a lamb. Janine wasn’t here this time, either. God, he’d forgotten about her, and the sex stories she sold to the papers (he was in no mood to ponder their validity, though, and he thought it didn’t really matter now, anyway). At least Sherlock didn’t have the chance to break that woman’s heart in this world. John remembered staring at the jewelry box, sick with shock, and then, with sympathy, because he actually liked Janine, and the thought of Sherlock proposing to
But he regretted saying that, because Sherlock’s eyes flickered down. “Right. Apologies.” He walked into the kitchen.
Sherlock was looking out the window of the cab. It was easier to look at John through the glass’ reflection so he could hide his own expression. “It wasn’t anything I had ever thought about, but when you brought the prospect into our lives, I wasn’t adverse.” That was truthful. He never thought he would be a father, ever, but as soon as Mary became pregnant with John’s child, he knew he would have to protect her, plain and simple. That was just that.
Suddenly, Sherlock remembered the day when they were out on a case, and John had the mark on his lips. “John, do you remember our last case, when we got in an argument?”
A lot of strange, incomprehensible things happened in John’s life: transporting to an alternate universe was fucking one of them. But this...This? “What the
“If that’s your roundabout way of saying you never had a blow job before--one: I knew that, and two: I didn’t need ten hours of sleep after my first.”
Sherlock felt them moving again, and soon he felt John place him on the seat of a car. He opened his eyes to see Lestrade getting into the driver’s seat, and John sitting down next to him.
Sherlock opened his eyes blearily, an inquisitive rumble coming from his chest, and he looked down. Instantly, horror flashed across his face. He gulped. “John,” he said in a fraught whisper.
Sherlock’s eyes were huge and frightened, mouth open, the the soft flush on his skin turning red hot. “W-what are you doing?” he croaked, voice cracking in alarm.
That took the fire out of Sherlock’s gaze, his frame growing small. “I’m sorry, John,” he said softly, shame in his eyes. He placed his hand on top of John’s. His palm was warm and his fingers were large, enclosing almost all of John’s hand.
Sherlock didn’t smile, looking down at Rosie as she put a clumsy hand into his hair. He said nothing.
When John returned, he quickly threw off his jacket and shoes and went back to his room. He was nervous. What if Sherlock was gone? What if he’ll say something stupid and hurtful and ruined them again? Having his love seemed too good to be true. John stopped in the doorway. Sherlock was still sleeping, his arm curled above his head on the pillow, snores coming from under his messy mop of hair.
Sherlock relaxed a little, turning his face into John’s neck. “If you say so. How long have you been awake?”
The biting wind of the November night made him shiver, and John realized he must have left his coat back at the restaurant. He felt ridiculous, sitting on a bench in a suit with tears in his eyes. He kept his face in his hands, his breath quivering out of his mouth. How was he supposed to react to this? What was he supposed to do? Was this seriously real? If this were real, was he here for life?
John turned around, and Sherlock was there. Of course he was. “What’s up?” he tried to play it casually.
EDIT: I'M SO SORRY I ACCIDENTALLY UPLOADED THIS TWICE!!!! BOTH VERSIONS WERE THE SAME I JUST FUCKED UP
If you've read more than one of my stories, you've probably noticed sleepy fluff is my fucking weakness, so expect a little bit next chapter :P But then it might get really dark lol
“They’re not the same,” John shook his head firmly. “Not at all, Sherlock. You were high, dying, and needed help, and what the fuck did I do, hm?” he smiled bitterly. “I hurt you. Why do you forgive me? Really, why?”
John nodded and sat up, stretching briefly. He walked naked across the room as if he did it every day, and despite the tense atmosphere, Sherlock couldn’t help but stare. Once John left the room, Sherlock sat up and leaned against the headboard, running his hand through his hair. He looked at the clock and saw it was only 7:15. He never woke up this early on days without cases. He wanted to go back to sleep with John. He growled internally.
Sherlock bit his lip. “Well…” His stomach hurt. Telling your friend that he was a widower was not a pleasant thought. Telling the love of your life he was married to someone who tried to kill you was even worse. If only Mary’s entire era could be erased from their lives.
Sherlock remembered the only time they got drunk together on his stag night. John wasn’t looking at him like this back then, or was he? Sherlock had been inebriated, himself, so he couldn’t tell.
Sherlock’s eyes lowered. “I hate seeing you so unhappy, John. Think about what I said, please? You’re not a bad person. You’re a strong man, and yet you’ve broken down because you think you’ve hurt me.” His eyes came back up to meet his. “Moriarty was a bad person. Magnussen was a bad person. They felt no wrong for what they did. You are not them,” he said sincerely.
“Not really,” Sherlock stood up, “although I would rather avoid her seeing us kiss for the time being; she’d squeal and I’m not in the mood for it.”
Not a single thing could have overridden his lust by that point, and he begged, “Sherlock, please touch me,
she smiled when they got in the cab while John was hurting and furious. The second time around, she was just as unsupportive. John shouldn’t have been shocked, but he was.
“Yeah.” He moved and swung his legs over the side of the bed, rubbing his eyes with a deep sigh that made his shoulders quiver.
“The first one says, ‘I knew you were up to something, John!’ Then she tried to call me, and the next one says, ‘Fine. Don’t even bother coming home.’”
Her large, blue eyes grew wide, her face completely falling. “I did want to leave my past behind, after I cleaned up loose ends. We could have been happy. I would have even let you stay friends with Sherlock!” she insisted. “But, you didn’t want that,” she said, bitterness and disappointment in her voice.
“What a pity,” Irene said boredly. “What about dinner tonight? I would offer to take you out, but you know I’m confined here.”
John wanted to cry from relief. “Yes,” he nodded. “Yes, I’m actually the Doctor, Sherlock. I didn’t know how to tell you.”
John was openly sobbing into his hands on a city bench. He had no idea if people were passing or if the sidewalks were empty. “What have I done?” he asked himself miserably. He didn’t think he would actually get his wish, so of course he didn’t think it through. He didn’t think he would lose his child. He felt like he barely got to spend any time with her. Rosie was barely over a year old in the other universe, and because of his stupid, selfish self, he hadn’t even been with her the entire time. He felt like he barely knew her. Even so, he grew attached to her. He loved her. But now, John was essentially crying over a person who never existed, and could never come to exist.
“Then it wouldn’t be selfish for you to worry about being upset if anything happened to me. It’s natural.” Sherlock didn’t want to be with him out of fear of losing him?
John cupped his cheek and spared him further discomfort, running his thumb over his pink lips. “You don’t have to say anymore, okay?” His heart lurched when Sherlock’s soft eyes gazed straight into his, unwavering, unblinking. He knew how much Sherlock held himself back from intimacy and why. He wouldn’t bring any of that up now (or ever, since he figured Sherlock should tell him on his own one day, on his terms), but it was definitely something he had to take into consideration. But maybe, John had to rip the band-aid off. If he went all in for their first time, maybe Sherlock would feel significantly less uncomfortable after that, unlike the other Sherlock, who was shy until the end (not that it was a problem for
John shook away the voice in his head. “No, you’re not,” he said again. “You--” he huffed. “You…” The fire was quickly leaving him, and John felt tears coming on. He swallowed thickly. “Why do you let me do these things to you?” he whispered harshly. “Why did you take me back, after I beat you to a bloody pulp?” He looked at the mark on Sherlock’s eyebrow, which was healing, but still visible. “How could you do that? I’ve been terrible and--”
“I know it shouldn’t,” he stared at the dull, gold bands. “It was a terrible marriage. I’m glad it’s over, but. I dunno. I remember thinking we’d be happy together.” He looked up guiltily. “Sorry. I shouldn’t be telling you this.”
Sherlock’s chest was heaving. “You kept making assumptions about us, about what we supposedly did, and every time I tried to redirect the conversation. I thought you would take the hint. I didn’t think you were this thick-headed.”
While things appeared to be healing on the surface, with Sherlock tentatively wrapping his arms around him, and then going out for cake to celebrate his birthday, John knew things weren’t right between them. He figured that was to be expected, considering everything they had gone through, individually and together, but even when Sherlock would give him one of his small, genuine smiles, John would not and felt as if he
John looked conflicted. "Maybe. I dunno. Or just try to find a way to meet this guy. In a public place, obviously, just to be safe."
“Two to three more hours,” Sherlock told him. He bit his lip. “You really don’t seem to care for her. It isn’t simply that she isn’t the one. You were disgusted when she kissed you.”
It didn’t matter how much he cried earlier; no one knew how to twist his heart like Sherlock did. This whole thing did make John feel unlovable. He didn’t feel much better about that now. Even if she did love him, what was the use of being loved by a killer? He sat up. He couldn’t have been asleep long, because the silence of the flat told him Rosie was still napping. He stared at Sherlock’s message again, but couldn’t answer it. How could he tell Sherlock how worthless he felt? How do you tell your male best friend that you feel like an unlovable piece of shit? He was still angry, but after a quick nap, he felt ashamed. He ruined Rosie’s day.
“You don’t deserve Sherlock’s kindness or his flat’s protection.” He wanted to scream at her, but he was already making a scene.
“Hey,” he laughed lightly. “It’s your birthday today, do you know that? No, of course you don’t,” he amended.
Sherlock came in, yawning, and hung his coat up. He took one look at John and said, “You’re drinking.”
“No,” John placed his hand over Sherlock’s, which was on his stomach. “You tried, and I appreciate it.” It was a nice attempt, albeit unsuccessful. “You don’t have to stay up worrying about me, though. I’ll be okay.”
“Fuck it,” John grumbled, the heat in his abdomen rendering him impatient, and threw off his own shirt.
flat, and I know you didn’t work enough during the two years you thought Sherlock was dead to afford a place of your own.”
His face fell. “But I don’t know when that will be. I don’t want you to be uncomfortable when you come here, but I also don’t want you to feel as if you’re unwelcome due to her.”
“I didn’t think you’d come back--or be back so soon,” Sherlock said quickly, and the hand down by his side picked at the fabric of his pajama pants. He was breathing out of his mouth, eyes still as wide as ever, “But I hurt you. Why are you back?” he demanded.
A ton of bricks dropped into John’s stomach. It was lipstick. His hand shook with the effort it took not to curl around and claw into the arm of his chair. “Oh,” he choked out. “That’s--good. How kind.” It sounded like someone had punched John in the gut. He cleared his throat, making his voice steadier. “That was good for you, right?”
John’s hand slid up to his chest, resting over his heart. He looked up, and Sherlock’s eyes were dark from the low light of their room. His gaze was intense. John’s heart throbbed fiercely, and though he thought it was impossible, he thought he loved Sherlock now more than ever. He ran his hand over the warm skin of Sherlock’ chest and stomach.
He acknowledged that he was probably being more bitter than warranted, and yeah, maybe he was sitting here feeling sorry for himself, but fuck it. Just fuck it. He was fed up. It felt like the universe had been against him for the past few years. He felt immense disappointment in his chest. He gently rested his cheek atop Rosie’s head. He didn’t expect everything to go back to normal today, but he didn’t expect his afternoon to be so shitty, either.
Sherlock hit a particularly high, sweet note on his violin, a small, barely audible moan coming from his throat.
Sherlock did not want to have this conversation, but he knew the answer. “No,” he said, an invisible hand clutching his heart. “I wasn’t in the right mind at all, John. You must understand that.”
After pieces of cake were cut, John placed Rosie on the kitchen table. She smashed her hand into the cake.
“Oh, she’s such a dear,” Mrs. Hudson chuckled. “Do you want her to have cake first, or open her presents?”
His breath instantly grew heavier, bubbles of anger brewing in his stomach. Should he lie and hide the rose? But, no, it wasn’t for him. That would have been terribly selfish. He cleared his throat and took out the rose. “Here,” he said dryly and tossed it to Sherlock.
John was clutching the edge of the counter and panting. She was a murderer, a lying murderer, and he had the fucking audacity to feel an ounce of sadness and guilt over never telling her the truth about cheating, and treat Sherlock like a fucking stress-relieving punching bag. John felt like he was going to gag. Sherlock once described him as having a strong moral principle. That went out the window the minute he forgave Mary on Christmas (although he’s unsure if he ever truly forgave her, in his heart of hearts). He felt himself gag and put his hand over his mouth, desperately trying to calm down.
As if on cue, Sherlock held his hand a little tighter. “Then you can say it all you want, I won’t bite,” he joked lightly with a self-conscious grin. “Actually, that’s a stupid idiom. Forget I said that.”
In any case, John felt like he had done so much wrong that he didn’t know how to make any of it right. With Rosie, he was less worried about turning things around. He was going to be there for her and stop dropping her off at the homes of everyone he knew. He was a father now, god damn it, and he was determined to care for her. His Rosie, not
“Of course,” he humored him. His gaze grew somber. “Thank you, John,” he said quietly. “For everything,” he clarified before John could ask. “For being patient, especially.”
different. Sherlock was still a person with sensitive areas. He had the same body parts he did, and John certainly knew how to touch those. He just needed to get over himself.
Things got back to normal, or almost normal. Sherlock still had a couple weeks before he could go running about, but he was getting back in the zone, solving cases on their blogs. They didn’t hear from Mary again.
“I’m glad you saw me through that obnoxious episode I had,” Sherlock turned his head to face him. “And for giving me a second chance.”
doubted him. He wanted to scream. “For god’s sake, John, yes! What’s it going to take to convince you that I love you?”
John sighed, and lowered his hands from where they were placed on his hips. It was hard not getting irritated with Sherlock’s eyes right on him. He put a smile on his face. “I’m thinking of you when we kiss,” he said.
“One more thing,” John said, and carefully leaned over her to pull out a small xylophone from the bag. It was small, brightly colored, and he was pretty sure he had one of these as a kid. The small mallet was attached to the toy by a red string, and he picked it up to tap on one of the keys, emitting a light sound. “Hear that, Rosie?”
