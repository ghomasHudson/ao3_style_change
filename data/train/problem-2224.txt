Sherlock stood his ground.
"Sixteen, sir, please no more," Sherlock cried, tears falling freely down his face.
Sherlock whimpered, but decided to stay silent as to not make John any more mad.
John watched with wide eyes as Sherlock's Alpha side took over and he scented all of John's clothing, first with his nose, then nuzzling into them down on the bed. When he was done, he smiled proudly and folded them back up and placed them on top of the dresser for John to put on the next day.
John continued barely touching the other man's cock with the toy and slowly dragged it down near his hole. Sherlock moaned desperately, trying his hardest not to press against the toy he was being teased with.
When she was relaxed enough, he replaced his tongue with his index finger and returned his mouth to her clit and began sucking in time with his finger pumping in and out of her.
"Please John, I'll be good. I swear," he begged.
"Give it to me!" Sherlock moaned loudly as John lined himself up with the detective's hole.
John dips his head down and kisses a line from Sherlock's belly button, down to his cock and licks his way to the tip. Sherlock throws his head back as John holds his hips to the bed, and continues to lick and kiss his way up and down the detective's fully hard cock.
Sherlock hollowed his cheeks and hummed as he slowly pulled off of John's cock. He licked his lips and stared up at the army doctor standing above him.
John obeyed and increased the speed of his thrusts until he was pounding into Sherlock as hard as he could.
Something inside Sherlock grew dark as he dropped everything and sprinted to the cage he saw John in. He all but yanked the barred door off the cage and saw John on the ground, curled into a ball. But before he had seen John, he could smell John. This wasn't just desperate 'save me' smells.
Sherlock happily complied as John's hand pumped his cock, until thick ropes of white painted his belly and chest. He groaned from overstimulation as John continued to fuck him to his own climax, slamming his hips into Sherlock's and coming deep inside the man.
John takes his fingers out and wipes them on the bed spread and lines himself up with Sherlock's entrance, before very slowly easing himself in.

"Go pick an outfit and bring it to me," Sherlock ordered softly.
John looked up at him with wide eyes and reached to grab his hand and let himself be led away and down the hall to their room.
Sherlock's eyes rolled in the back of his head as he thrusted once, twice, then his knot slipped into the Omega underneath him.
John growled as he began to thrust into his lover, the scent from where they joined overwhelming him. With his fingers in a vice grip on Sherlock’s hips, he allowed his primal urge to breed and fuck, to overpower him and soon he was relentlessly pounding into the Omega below him.
"Yeah baby look how sexy it is to see my cock disappear into you. You're doing so good, taking my cock in your arse so so good. Want me to fuck you harder?"
Sherlock caught his breath for a few seconds before hurriedly dropping to his knees on the floor and freeing John's member from his pants.
Sherlock sighed in relief as she released her long dark hair from the ponytail she had pulled back high on her head all day.
Sherlock panted and nodded vigorously. John grinned and began to piston his hips in and out of the detective quickly. The only sounds in the room were heavy panting from both parties and the slap of skin on skin.

John, not trying to be rude, stayed and talked to the Alpha, but the scent coming from the other man suggested he wasn't just there for a chat. As the Alpha moved closer, John began sweating a bit. He hadn't been flirted with or courted in so long (well just based on his second gender) in a very long time and he didn't like it one bit. His body told him 'This is not your Alpha. Leave. Go. Now," but he stayed put and prayed someone came to save him.
Sherlock stood in front of John and folded his arms over his chest. "No," he said smugly.
John pulled him to the side after Sherlock made a helpful deduction that sent everyone into a frenzy to contact the right people to get more information.
He fidgeted, but stayed put.
Sherlock gritted his teeth as his hole was abused, very close to his orgasm. "Come in me, daddy! Fill me up!" He rasped between breaths, as he himself came and painted the bedsheets beneath him with white stripes.
"Sleep, John, and don't let me forget to scent you again before we leave tomorrow in case the smell wears overnight," Sherlock said softly.
Soon she began rocking slightly back and forth against the soft tongue and lips of the taller woman. Sherlock happily sunk her tongue inside of her lover and buried her nose in the other woman’s folds, rubbing against her clit.
Not too far after, John tightened his grip on Sherlock's hips and pounded his cock back in that warmth four more times before halting and shooting his load deep inside the detective.
They both made quick work of unbuttoning and unbuckling until both of their hard cocks were free from any clothing.
“Keep that thing away from me,” Sherlock replied, pushing the snowman back. As he did another girl appeared, this one wearing a glittery Santa hat, and placed their mugs in front of them.
“Hmm, right, very logical,” Sherlock pressed a kiss on top of John’s head, “yes, ok, groceries.”
Sherlock frowned. “You already made me go out last time it snowed,” he said.
“No, no. I don’t need to sit down. I just, I need to get some water I think.” She pushed open the door and left the morgue. When she was gone John turned to glare at the two brothers.
“Actually,” said John, pointing at Sherlock, “that’s really good advice. Yeah, do that. Get him something involving pumpkins, or you two’s version of pumpkins.”
Molly walked, laughing, through the door and sat down next to John. Sherlock followed close behind her and closed the door before plopping down on Molly’s other side. He reached around the back of the couch and let his hand rest of John’s shoulder for a moment, before nodding at the two of them and pressing play.
They each wrote their name onto individual pieces of paper before handing them to Molly, who mixed them up in a Santa hat. They passed the hat around the circle, each taking out a slip of paper. When the hat reached John he plucked out a folded paper and passed the hat to Mycroft, who was standing next to him. Upon opened the paper he saw Molly’s name written in flowery cursive. Once the hat had gotten all the way around the circle and returned to Molly she set it on her desk and smiled at them. “Well, that was all in need,” she said, “ but we should also probably figure out when and where we want to exchange gifts.”
“So... Mrs. Hudson made us sweaters,” said Sherlock, rubbing his hands against his thighs as if to warm them up. “I suppose we’ll have to make a few appearances in these.”
“What? Now?” asked John, “shouldn’t we wait until Christmas?”
“Good god, you are slow in the mornings. Yes it snowed.”
“I would if you stopped calling yourself cool and mysterious,”
Walking into the bedroom, he laid down next the Sherlock, who was already dozing, and tried to fall asleep. At some point, Sherlock, who usually sleeps flat on his stomach, rolled over, nearly knocking John off the bed. John pushed him back over to his side and curled up against his back, letting Sherlock’s body heat serve as a human radiator to keep him warm.
“Mistletoe? I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said, raising her hand and coyly playing with her earring.
Sherlock rolled over to face him, their faces pressed close together and John gave him a quick kiss before humming the chorus as it came on. Sherlock smiled and gazed sleepily at him, whispering some of the words. They laid facing each other, noses and foreheads pressed together, until the song ended and John got up to look out the window at the snow. It had slowed and from the living room window he could almost see the building across the street. “Has it gotten any lighter?” Sherlock called, appearing in the hallway, swathed in his silken maroon dressing gown, his hair lightly tousled.
“No. I mean, thank you, honestly. But what the fuck?”
John put the dough in the fridge and walked over to stand in front of Sherlock. “I have a few ideas,” he said, standing onto his tip-toes to kiss Sherlock. Sherlock laughed, throwing his head back and placing his hand in John’s hair. John trailed kisses down Sherlock’s neck and they moved from the kitchen to while away the hours.
They continued down London’s long winding streets, making their way back to their flat. When John got to the point in his candy cane where the long end had formed an extremely sharp spike he showed it to Sherlock. “Potential murder weapon?” he asked.
“Christ, how are you so perfect?” John said, leaning over and stealing a glance at Sherlock’s perfectly symmetrical and beautifully designed snowflake cookie. Sherlock shrugged, not looking up from his cookie and John started on a Christmas tree shaped cookie. When they were done Sherlock moved on to a Christmas tree that would eventually get an incredibly detailed set of ornaments and John picked up a snowflake. They continued, silently bent over their cookies, and when they were done they had a collection of some uncommonly beautiful cookies and some incredibly messily decorated cookies.
“Ok, do you want whipped cream on that hot chocolate?” She asked. John looked up at Sherlock, eyebrows raised, curious what he would say. He shot a look at John before nodding. “Yes, please.”
As soon as Sherlock finished playing the final note John was crashing into him. He couldn’t even remember rising from his chair, but suddenly his hands were on the sides of Sherlock’s face and he was kissing him, telling him not to be afraid. When John pulled back, gasping for air, Sherlock smiled and John pressed their foreheads together. “I love you,” he said. “I love you, I love you, I love you.” He would have continued, saying it over and over, had Sherlock not taken his own face in his hands and kissed him deeply. John leaned forward, almost collapsing into Sherlock, and Sherlock guided them into his chair, his lips never leaving John’s.
John let out a low sound of pleasure, somewhere between a moan and a growl. His mouth attuned with Sherlock’s, their lips and teeth and tongue moving as one. He turned his head for a moment, gasping heavily and trying to catch his breath. He felt Sherlock nose press against his face, blowing hot air against his cool cheek as he exhaled. John inhaled deeply before turning back towards Sherlock. Their chests were pressed together and they were breathing opposite one another, John’s lungs filling with air as Sherlock’s collapsed. John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s, the tips of their noses touching, their upper lips barely brushing one another.
Lines appeared on Sherlock’s forehead and he looked muddled, like he was trying to recalibrate his brain after sleeping and remember what day it was. “Yes, yes,” he said groggily, “S’ Christmas. Merry Christmas. Coffee.” He tossed the blankets down to the end of the bed, uncovering John in the process, and got up without another word, walking into the kitchen to make coffee. John followed him a minute later and found Sherlock standing, barefoot and swathed in a maroon dressing gown, before their irritable coffee machine.
“Sure, that’s fine,” said John. Mycroft looked at Sherlock, who nodded.
Sherlock was silent for a moment before saying “John, I don't think we should do anything but enjoy what we have now. And I don’t think we’d have been able to be exactly as happy as we are now without first going through all of our other phases first. You are happy aren’t you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock sit down and stop being an arse,” said John, “continue Mycroft.”
When John looked at the clock some time later he realized just how quickly the time had gone by and got up to preheat the oven, leaving Sherlock drowsing lazily. Sherlock wandered in a few minutes later, his hair tousled and his dressing gown thrown over his untucked shirt and trousers. John smiled at him, standing barefoot in the doorway of the kitchen, the late afternoon sun giving him a golden glow.
“Oh no, that’s fine,” said Mycroft resting his hands on top of his umbrella and making an expression as if he would rather pass a titanium kidney stone than take another step closer to the dead body. “I just needed to talk to my brother, and since he never responds to my texts,” Mycroft looked pointedly at Sherlock who barely spared him a glance before returning to the body he had begun examining, “I was forced to come here in person.”John was pretty sure he heard them both mutter “so immature,” under their breaths at the same time.
“Enjoy!” She said brightly.
“I said, do you-“
“Sorry for being late,” he said, looking at his watch.
“I am not enjoying this, thank you very much,” Sherlock muttered as she walked away.
“Oxford Street,” “221B Baker Street,” John and Sherlock said at the same time. The cabbie looked between them, eyebrows raised expectantly. “Alright fine,” Sherlock sighed, “Oxford Street please.”
“Alrighty, can do,” she said, typing their order into her register, “is that for here of to go?”
“Can I please come up there with you?” John asked, crossing his arms indignantly.
“Sherlock that is cheating, you have to look at the Christmas stuff,” said John sliding into the chair across from him. Sherlock reluctantly swiveled to face him and the rest of the terrible Christmas decor. John stifled a laugh at Sherlock’s grumpy expression. “I know, this stuff is really horrible,” he said, pushing the fake snowman at Sherlock.
“And can it go back to Antarctica please?” Sherlock muttered. He leaned over and gave the coffee pot a firm slap, which caused a weak stream of coffee to appear.
“Feeling all better then?” John asked, cracking another egg into the pan.
“Nows, fine with me,” said Mycroft.
“For here,” “To go,” said John and Sherlock at the same time. The girl behind the counter raised her eyebrows. Sherlock glared at them both. “Fine, for here.”
“That is correct.” John nodded again, trying to think back and figure out when he felt the change. Sherlock, picking up on how hard John was thinking about this, but misinterpreting his confusion, looked at him with brows furrowed in concern. “You haven’t changed your mind, have you?”
“Yes I do,” said Sherlock, tilting the newspaper down to give John an upside down view of the headline inside. John look at his screen and sure enough, it was Lestrade that had texted.
“Lies. You’re telling me lies Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said. She shrugged modestly, but when she looked over Sherlock’s shoulder at John, she winked. “I saw that,” said Sherlock, “how could I have not seen that?” John grinned behind Sherlock’s back and returned Mrs. Hudson’s wink. This Sherlock did not see and both he and Mrs. Hudson repressed a smile.
“I also knew it!” Sherlock said, interrupting once again. This time it was John who stood up. He leaned over and whacked Sherlock of the back of the head before returning his attention to Mycroft.
“No! Well, some. But nothing like what you did. Honestly Sherlock, I can’t believe you.”
“Yes, I’m not an imbecile, John.” John rolled his eyes and watched as Sherlock carefully placed his ball onto top of the larger ball of snow John was standing next to. John then made the head while Sherlock went off looking for branches to use as the arms. When they had the snowman fully assembled they added the string, carrot, and buttons to make his face and adorned him with the hat and scarf.
“John, I’m still in my pajamas.”
“No, no, I know what you said. Yes please, I’d love to.” John smiled at her, still utterly confused by this sudden burst of apologetic sympathy in Sherlock.
“What? Sherlock and I are always so what?”
“What? Why?” John asked, looking up from his paper.
“Are you done for tonight?” he asked.
“Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock, “this may be the ugliest sweater I’ve ever seen, but it’s also the kindest and most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received.” John bit the inside of his cheek, even more unsure how to react to this.
“Do you want to join us on our walk back to Baker Street?” John asked Mrs. Hudson as they headed down the elevator.
“Nothing I did can compare to your level of law breaking.”
“Great,” said Molly, “if there isn’t anything else then I’ll see you all at John and Sherlock’s on the 22nd.” They thanked her before going their separate ways, Mycroft and Greg going down one hall, John, Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson going down another.
Sherlock chased him through the park, his long legs catching up easily with John. As he got closer he threw another snowball. This one hit John on his back and when he stumbled a little Sherlock managed to catch up with him. Sherlock reached for John, spinning him around. “I won!” he exclaimed, fingers clutching John’s wrist.
“Oh yeah?” John bent down and scooped up a handful of snow with his free hand, which he then shoved down the back Sherlock’s coat, moving too quickly for Sherlock to stop him. Sherlock shrieked, sending a flock of birds bursting upwards into the sky from a nearby tree. He writhed, attempting to get the freezing snow off his skin. John covered his mouth with his hand and bent over, laughter shaking his shoulders.
“Inspector Lestrade, Greg?” John asked.
A pair of loudly chattering Americans pushed past them, knocking John into Sherlock. He shot a glare over his shoulder at the Americans as he tried to right himself, but as he turned back forward he was surprised to find Sherlock’s steadying hand on his shoulder. John smiled up at Sherlock, but before he could say anything Sherlock slid his hand down John’s arm and tucked his palm into John’s. “I thought you didn’t like holding hands in public,” John said, but didn’t remove his hand from Sherlock’s.
Sherlock shrugged and picked up the book he had abandoned when John had gotten home. Sinking deeper into his chair, he opened his book and settled in to read. John followed suit and opened his laptop to work on a blog post. It was in each other’s quiet company that the two of them spent the next few hours, silently enjoying the presence of their other half.
“She won’t let me have my chemistry set,” Sherlock said.
The corner of John’s lip quirked in amusement. “I suppose you have,” he said, “but really, how are you?”
As soon as the door shut behind John, Sherlock was on him, holding the back of John’s head in his hands and kissing him, hard, on the mouth. He pushed John up against the closed door and John gasped for air as Sherlock began trailing kisses from the corner of his mouth across his cheek. John slid his hands under Sherlock’s shirt, running them along his smooth torso and feeling his muscles ripple under his skin. He pressed his shoulders harder against the door, arching his back and exposing his throat. He wondered if Sherlock could feel his heart beating as he placed a kiss on John’s neck where one usually puts their fingers to check for a pulse.
“Wait, how could you have possibly deduced that?”
When they reached the landing John and Sherlock exchanged a glance. John was openly grinning and Sherlock was trying very hard to maintain his outwardly prickly demeanor, but in truth, it was barely holding on. In a moment of impulsive excitement John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him up the final flight of stairs. Sherlock tripped after him, not letting go. They bounded upwards together, feet eagerly hitting the stairs.
“Yes, I won’t tell anyone you’re a horrible gift giver and a desperately hopeless boyfriend,” he said.
They left the carriage behind and continued on their way back home, only a few minutes walk away from their flat by the time the ride had ended. They walked the last stretch of road and arrived back at 221B Baker Street. When they stepped inside they took off their coats and hung them on the pegs by the door, but before John could start up the stairs Sherlock picked him up and slung him over his shoulder. “Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?” John said, almost loud enough to be shouting. His heart was pounding so hard in shock that John thought, not for the first time that night, that it might burst. He was caught between beating Sherlock’s back with his fists and laughing deliriously, and he ended up doing both.
“It was worth a shot,” he muttered. John rolled his eyes and got up to make toast for the two of them. A few minutes later he placed a plate in front of Sherlock, who grunted a “thanks,” and continued pouting about his paper. They ate their breakfast in silence, Sherlock eventually opening his phone to skim the news.
“Well I needed to know how spleens react to prolonged exposure to various chemical compounds.”
John walked up to him, planting a good morning kiss on his cheek and running his fingers through Sherlock’s sleep tousled hair. Sherlock leaned against him for a moment before getting out two mugs, filling one for himself, and handing the other to John. He stirred his sugar into his coffee while John poured himself a cup and they sat down together at the kitchen table. Sherlock slid a newspaper that was sitting across the table towards himself, but frowned when he realized it was the previous day’s paper and tromped downstairs to get the more recent version that was waiting for him by the door.
“Well where else am I going to keep them?”
They joined the crow of people confidently skating around the center of the rink and made their way along, Sherlock gaining speed and, eventually, balance. He let go of John’s hand after a while and skated along by himself. Now that Sherlock was skating by himself when a pocket of empty space appeared John slid forward and gave a small twirl before returning to Sherlock’s side. Sherlock looked over at him, his eyes wide in amazement. “That was really impressive,” he said, his voice slightly breathless.
Everyone looked around the room at each other. “Whichever,” said Greg.
John laughed and shook his head, “No, we’re going.”
“Do you want your computer?”
“Transportation systems have been shut down all over London, causing massive delays across the region,” the newscaster was saying in his slightly monotone drawl. Sherlock, John, and Mrs. Hudson were huddled around the TV, watching the morning news report. Outside a white blur was obscuring their view, so that all they could see was snow, pouring from the sky.
“Yeah, best we can do I guess. He’s cute though.”
John set a bowl of oatmeal and a glass of orange juice in front of him a few minutes later and they ate their breakfast together, John drinking an orange juice of his own in solidarity. Sherlock picked up the newspaper and began perusing the crime section. “Christ,” he muttered, “I’m out of commission for two days and all of London goes to hell in a hand basket.”
The snow hit Sherlock, dusting his hair with white flakes. Sherlock made another ball, but when he threw it, it harmlessly hit a tree and John slowed, packing snow into another ball and throwing it. It hit Sherlock on the shoulder and they both paused to catch their breath before John threw another snowball in Sherlock’s direction and took off running again.
It was the sound, John realized, of how Sherlock felt when they’d finally closed the gap between themselves. It was inquisitive, but intoxicated, entirely consumed by this new thing that it was exploring. There was a fervor, a need, almost a hunger, in the music. With a start John realized that Sherlock was mapping out their relationship with sound, weaving the story of how he fell in love. When the tune eased the music became softer and John recognized where they were now. He could hear the quiet mornings and the unspoken affection. Slowly the song drifted downwards, settling on his shoulders like a blanket, reaching its end.
He smiled and looked back up at the lights. Gazing up at the lights and nestled against Sherlock’s side, John let his mind wander. He wondered what it would be like if they did this forever. Argue over a freshly rotting corpse, then go out for evening strolls, hand in hand. Make each other breakfast before chasing criminals through the streets of London. It felt like a life they could have together. It felt like they could spend forever the way they were now.
Sherlock ran the tip of his tongue across John’s bottom lip before placing it gently between his teeth. When John didn’t pull away he bit harder, causing John to squirm, a small laugh escaping his lips. Sherlock smiled, his mouth never leaving John’s. He slid his hands beneath John’s coat and dug his fingers into John’s back, pulling him closer.
Mycroft made a hmming noise and raised an eyebrow, “you’re getting soft in you relationship addled state, brother dear.”
After a while they reach a less busy area and the Christmas lights turned from huge displays into smaller strings put up in shop windows and wrapped around trees. The noises died down a little as the street became less crowded and eventually John stopped and looked up a Sherlock. “Should we get a cab to go home?” he asked.
“And I bet it would have been just as a successful in a laboratory, instead of our kitchen!” John cried, shaking Sherlock by the shoulders. Sherlock laughed softly and they rested their foreheads together, John shaking his head back and forth, hands still resting on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I don’t know what to do with you sometimes,” he said.
Once John was changed he turned off the light and climbed into bed next to Sherlock, relieved to finally be back in their room, instead of his dark dusty one upstairs. They burrowed under the covers, Sherlock still fully clothed, and settled in for the night, both of their heads already drooping. John breathed in the smell of Sherlock, blissfully glad to be this close to him again. After a moment he nestled his head against Sherlock’s chest and fell asleep.
“Christmas-? Tomorrow is Christmas?” Sherlock said, looking around as if a calendar would be floating midair somehow.
“It’s the string mouth,” said Sherlock, “it’s puny.”
John pulled the cold dough out of the fridge and placed it one the counter, the two hours it needed to chill, up. Sherlock pulled out the rolling pin and sprinkled flour on the counter. When John unwrapped the dough from its cling film he placed it on the light layer of flour and lightly shoved Sherlock’s shoulder. “Go get our stupid cookie cutters,” he said, echoing Sherlock’s earlier insult of the shaped cookie cutters. He began rolling out the dough and Sherlock arrived a few moments later to dump a pile of tin snowmen, snowflakes, Christmas trees, and other assorted holiday shapes next to him. When John was finished they both began cutting the dough into shapes, Sherlock preferring the snowflake shape and John going for the Christmas tree. When the dough was cut out and placed onto trays John slide them into the oven and set the timer.
As they got closer to Baker Street John’s candy cane slowly shrank, as did Sherlock’s, until they had only two small stubs left. By the time they got back the their flat they were almost entirely gone. John kicked off his shoes and settled into his chair to begin writing up a blog post about his and Sherlock’s lengthy discussion. Sherlock sat across from him, writing a blog post of his own. When John stretched out his legs Sherlock rested his feet on top of John’s, which was an odd, but somehow comforting gesture. They sat together quietly for the rest of the evening, whiling away the hours, enjoying one another’s silent company. Eventually the sun set outside and John got up to go to bed. As he did so, he gave Sherlock a goodnight kiss on the cheek, his breath smelling of candy cane.
When they got inside John was overwhelmed by the smell of grease and beer. Sherlock stepped confidently up to the counter and ordered some chips. John, still confused, sat down at small slimy table while Sherlock struck up a conversation with the man, well, kid really, behind the counter. He seemed friendly at first, questioning the greasy haired teenager about how he came to work at the shop.
“Every year, December 2nd, we come here for festive drinks.”
Sherlock looked at him, his fork paused midway through twirling his pasta. “John,” his voice came out like a breath of air, “I’m scandalized.” It was John’s turn to look sheepish. He took a bite of his chicken, hoping that chewing would somehow slow his heart rate down. Instead he almost choked when Sherlock nudged his foot under the table and asked with a quirked eyebrow, “were there more guys or girls?”
John nodded, “could you make sure he doesn’t do anything crazy while I’m out please.”
Sherlock looked at him, his eyes wide, like he was mourning the loss of a loved one. John suppressed a smile, caught between laughter and sympathy. Sherlock sadly scraped the liver into the bag and John sealed it and set it on the table. He gave Sherlock a consoling kiss on the forehead and cleaned up the last of the dishes, placing them all in the sink to be washed.
John stared at her for a moment, his mind going completely blank. He couldn’t believe that after two months, this was the first time someone had mistaken them for a couple, but hadn’t been mistaken. John, who was so used to correcting people and insisting that they weren’t a couple, seemed to be experiencing some sort of error, like his brain needed rebooting. He shook his head, as if to knock all of his thoughts back into place, before smiling and nodding. “Yeah, he loves them. We can’t get one though, flat’s too small, so he pets everyone else’s.”
“You’re the one who brought this up.” John had no argument to that so he shoved his hands in his pockets and frowned. The truth was, he adored how “cool and mysterious” Sherlock was, he just wanted to pester him about it. But whenever he tried to lovingly pester Sherlock about anything, Sherlock argued him into a corner. He should have become a lawyer.
“Now is not the time, Sherlock,” John snapped as Mycroft let the door slam behind him. They worked in silence for few minutes before Molly came back. Her eyes were a bit puffy, but she seemed otherwise composed.
Heading upstairs, Sherlock sat down at his microscope and began examining the scrap of paper. John started reviewing his notes and drafting the beginning of his blog post for this case. After a while he got distracted and started staring out of the window. Snow had stopped actively falling but everything outside was covered in a light dusting. John knew it wouldn’t last long, it never did in London, and he could see the snow on the Speedy’s awning below already beginning to drip.
“Um, yeah,” said John, “at least if you want shapes. If you’re fine with just circles it doesn’t have to be refrigerated.”
“John, it snowed again,” Sherlock called from his place by the window. It was early in the morning and John was in the kitchen making coffee.
John nearly dropped the eggs a second time. At this point he should be used to finding assorted body parts in various places around the flat, but it never seemed to become a normal thing that ceased to shock and disgust him. “And why, pray tell, are your pickled kidneys in our fridge?”
“Come on Sherlock, you’re acting like a child.”
Sherlock frowned and ran his hand through his curls, trying to neaten them. “Here,” John said, leaning forward and tucking one of Sherlock’s curls back into place. Sherlock smiled gratefully and picked up a book, opening it, but staring off into space instead of reading. He pensively took a sip of his hot chocolate, going over their case from earlier in his mind.
John began making eggs and Sherlock put the kettle on. Once the kettle was heating up he stood behind John, who was at the stove, and slid his arms around his waist, patiently waiting for his eggs to be made, with his chin resting atop John’s head.
“I don’t see why you’re getting so worked up over nothing, we don’t even know what Mycroft wants to talk to us about. Now, if you’re not going to read that paper, I will.” And without another word he stole John’s paper and continued eating his eggs. John rolled his eyes and continued with his own eggs.
“Do you to watch the telly?”
“So,” said Sherlock, “that’s that.” He sat down in his chair, holding his violin in his lap. His feet tapped the floor, like his was sitting in a waiting room or on a bus. He was often like this after solving a particular kind of case, the kind that was difficult to work out, but didn't require much running around chasing after clues. They seemed to leave him feeling a little lost, like he didn’t quite know what to do with his brain now that it had finished working.
“No promises,” he said, “but I’ll try.”
When John looked out the window Monday morning, he was in for a big surprise. Overnight several inches of snow had been dumped over London. Outside the world was covered in a blanket of white. “Sherlock, come look at this,” he called. Sherlock meandered over slowly, coffee cup in hand, from his place in the kitchen.
“What? At the same time? Or separately? No don’t answer that. It’s Christmas, we’re supposed to be doing nice things this time of year, not prying into other people’s private lives.”
“Oh I don’t know, maybe in a laboratory!” This was a fight they had had again and again.
“Yes Dr. Watson,” said Sherlock teasingly and popped the long end of the candy cane into his mouth. John pulled out his own candy cane and struggled with the thin layer of plastic for a minute before sighing and handing it to Sherlock, who grinned and obligingly bit open the plastic for him. John thanked him and put his own candy in his mouth.
“Ok then,” Sherlock turned and went back to the kitchen, where his scrambled eggs were waiting.
“Yeah,” said Lestrade, “I guess we’re both dating a Holmes brother now.”
For several minutes as they walked John’s mind was entirely consumed by the images running through his brain of Sherlock pulling him into a dark corner and kissing him. But when they rounded the corner of the street John saw something else that made his heart do excited jumping jacks. Sitting across the street was a horse drawn carriage, the kind they gave tours to tourists in. He put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and pointed to the carriage. “Let’s take a carriage ride, he said, “come on Sherlock.” Before Sherlock could begin to protest John was dragging him across the road towards the carriage.
“Screw the nice list,” Sherlock said, pushing John onto the bed and kicking the bedroom door shut behind him.
“A hot chocolate and an apple cider please,” he said.
John rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s perfectionism and cleared a space where they could decorate the cookies. Sherlock picked up one of his snowflakes and began icing it with a precise hand. John picked up a cookie of his own and began icing it. When he finished he pushed it towards Sherlock with his finger. “Look Sherlock, don’t eat the yellow snow,” he had iced a snowman with yellow icing.
Sherlock smiled at John’s sudden transformation from concerned boyfriend to assured doctor and obeyed, settling into the pillows that John had begun placing behind his head to prop him up. When John was satisfied that Sherlock was in a comfortable position he went to the kitchen and put the kettle on before filling up a glass of water.
John bent down beside him and placed the back of his hand on Sherlock’s forehead. Realizing that Sherlock was burning up, he gently shook Sherlock by the shoulder to wake him. Sherlock blinked awake slowly, a sharp contrast to his usual very sudden transfers between sleeping and waking. When he saw John standing over him looking worried he turned his head, looking around to see what was the matter, before realizing it was him that John was concerned about.
John laughed and rubbed a hand over his forehead. “Taking care of him over the next few days is going to be a real treat,” he said.
“Mhm, that makes sense, you two are always so…” Lestrade trailed off and waved his hand as if that was an explanation, letting the rest of his sentence hang in midair.
He had a burn in the back of his throat and he sat up, leaning past John to cough into his elbow. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand and laid back down onto his pillow. “How are you feeling?” John asked, furrowing his brow and placing a hand once again of Sherlock’s forehead.
“Oh,” said Sherlock, putting his head back down on the pillow they were sharing, “my mother used to play this song all the time.”
When they reached the doorway John pushed Sherlock roughly by the shoulders against the doorjamb and kissed him, open-mouthed and passionate. Sherlock responded with a long moan in the back of his throat, his eyes rolling back as they closed. John pressed against him, moving his hands from Sherlock’s shoulders to run along the sharp line of his chin.
“How would I control the wind? That’s impossible.”
level of law breaking? So there was some illegal activity in your formative years.” Sherlock leaned forward ever further, a dangerous glint in his eye.
“I just, um, you know…” Sherlock trailed off, leading John to raise his eyebrows expectantly.
“Just to the pharmacy,” he said, “Sherlock woke up with the flu.”
They walked along, sucking their candy canes and looking into shop windows, many of which were decorated with candy canes of their own, or some other form of assorted holiday paraphernalia. As they walked along, looking into shop windows, John though about what he was going to buy Molly, and everyone else, for Christmas and made a mental list of the ideas he got from the many window displays.
“Oh dear,” said Mrs. Hudson, looking fretfully out the window, “I don’t know what we’re going to do with this weather.”
“Stop pouting and check if these lights work,” said John handing him a string of lights and placing a kiss on his cheek.
Sherlock’s tone shifted suddenly. “And where is your dad now?”
“I’m not squeamish,” he yelled to Sherlock. Sherlock followed him from the kitchen and bent down from behind, giving him a kiss on the top of his head. He sat across from John in his chair, one leg straightened in from of him and the other thrown over the armrest. “How is that possibly comfortable?” John asked him.
Sherlock smirked and stretched his arms above his head, nestling his hands behind his head, “I’ve had a good doctor,” he said.
“I’m sorry kid,” John said, knowing Sherlock wouldn’t say it himself.
“Molly that’s not going to help your case,” John said.
They were in an airy, light filled café, the walls painted a shade of robin’s egg blue. The hostess appeared, and smiled at them. “Just the two of you today?” she asked. They nodded and she smiled. “alright, follow me,” she said. She led them to a table by the large bay windows and placed menus at each of the table settings.
“Yes, yes. Aches and pains, a headache, sudden onset, chills, I assume I have a fever, coughing. I have the flu John.”
Sherlock shook his head, leaned back in his chair, and took a sip of his hot chocolate with an air of finality, as he was marking the end of the conversation. When he set the cup down he had a mustache of whipped cream on his upper lip. John snorted and Sherlock, realizing what had happened, hastily whipped it off and glanced around to see if anyone had seen.
Squatting down, he began packing a ball of snow in his hands and John, seeing the size of his snowball and the expression of determined fury on his face, retreated further into the park. Sherlock ran and send the snowball flying after him. It hit him square in the back of the head and John laughed and leaned down, scooping up some snow, which he sent over his shoulder at Sherlock.
“Oh it’s fine, we all have crazy stories from college. That girl over there,” he gestured to a college aged girl with his fork who was eating lasagne halfway across the restaurant, “is sleeping with her professor
“Because I don’t want to,” he replied, and went back to leaning over the body.
Lestrade stepped back into the restaurant and began explaining what had happened to the boy. Sherlock and John took this as their cue to leave and pushed out of the restaurant, back onto the street, Sherlock with his unbuttoned coat flapping in the breeze.
Lestrade shoved his hands into his pockets, still looking annoyed. “Great,” he said in a tone that suggested this was not great. “Like I said, we’ll test her DNA in the lab. If you want you can come along and examine her body more in the morgue.”
John shook his head at Sherlock’s logic, but continued eating his Chicken Parmesan without arguing. “Speaking of nice,” he said after a moment, “I was thinking, it would be nice if we hosted a little Christmas party, like we did a few years ago. You know, with Molly and Mycroft and everyone. We could exchange our secret Santas then.”
She sighed, “yes. Though when have I ever had the power to stop Sherlock doing something crazy?”
“Not enjoying the weather, are we Mycroft?” Sherlock asked, swinging into the living room and plunking down into his chair, his dressing gown swooshing behind him.
Sherlock sighed and John mounted the first step. Sherlock could feel John’s muscles moving as they walked, even through their shirts and coats. He revealed in the feeling as John climbed the stairs and carried him into their flat, where John dropped him into bed. He kicked off his shoes and curled into a comfortable position while John changed into his pajamas.
Mrs. Hudson raised an eyebrow at their hurried explanations. When they fell silent she smiled and gave them another once over in their Christmas sweaters and shamefaced expressions. “Well I’m happy for you,” she said, “and hopefully this means you’ll start making each other tea and stop asking me to do it.” John looked doubtfully at Sherlock but didn’t say anything. Instead he placed a hand on Sherlock’s knee and smiled, glad to finally have gotten telling Mrs. Hudson over with. Even though he had known she wouldn’t react poorly it had weighed heavily on his mind and he was happy to have that weight lifted. Sherlock continued to look mortified for some time, even after Mrs. Hudson had shut the door behind her again and left them in silence once more. They sat like that for some time, neither saying anything, as neither were quite sure how to articulate just how horrifyingly wonderful that entire experience had been.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow suspiciously, but didn’t press the matter further. “If you say so. Well, this has been a very instructive visit, thank you,” he said, standing, “I’d prefer if we didn’t acknowledge that this ever happened, if that’s ok with you.”
Sherlock stared at him, and John could see the cogs slowly turning in his mind. His face suddenly lit with understanding and he lifted his hands in the air in an “ah-ha” motion. “Mrs. Hudson!” he bellowed, storming back down the stairs.
“Ok, first of all, I will be teasing you about this until the end of time. Second of all, Frozen is not a Christmas movie.”
Once they got outside John stopped and turned to Sherlock and paused, giving him a puzzled look before continuing walking. “What was that all about? Inviting Molly over I mean.”
Sherlock let out an exasperated huff of breath, “we’ve been over this. You are not allowed to tease me about wanting to see Frozen 2 any more. Besides, you like Christmas movies, you should be enjoying this.”
“What? Ew, why?”
That was all it took for Sherlock to jump out of his chair and start talking animatedly about the theories he had formed just from reading the paper alone. Lestrade raised his eyebrows and looked past Sherlock at John. John shrugged as if to say “what did you expect?”
Sherlock nodded, “I still feel a bit achy, but otherwise, I think I’m doing better.”
“Of course, you’ve got some interesting interests, John.”
The second Sherlock recovered he sprang forward, tackling John. They landed in a pile of snow behind a clump of trees. John rolled over, pushing Sherlock into the snow. “I won, admit it,” he said, pushing down on Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock took a deep breath, but instead of protesting he lifted his torso, taking John by the back of the neck and kissing him. John, surprised and thrown off balance, shot his hands out, putting them on either side of Sherlock’s head. The cold, wet snow slid through his fingers as he tilted his head, melting into Sherlock.
“Mhm, here,” Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him. John, surprised by the unexpected kiss, backed into the wall across from the coat rack. “Feel better now?” Sherlock asked. John rolled his eyes and handed Sherlock his hot chocolate so he could take off his coat. They headed upstairs after Sherlock had hung up his own coat. When they stepped into their flat Sherlock immediately flopped into his chair, nearly spilling his hot chocolate as he dramatically tipped his head backwards.
When they got back to the flat they hung up their coats, but the mood had changed, becoming less playful and more fervent and urgent. John could feel the energy cackling between them as they climbed the stairs, like if he reached out and touched Sherlock he would feel an electric shock. He knew Sherlock could feel it too because as they made their way upstairs he heard a change in Sherlock, in the way he breathed and stepped. Like he was anticipating something. They didn’t touch and didn’t look at one another, but John could feel the air pulsing between them, could feel the tension mounting.
“Who want’s to go first?” Molly asked.
“Tell Lestrade I’m alive and well,” Sherlock said without looking up from his paper.
“First Frozen 2, now this. I’m starting to think I fell in love with a three-year-old,” John said, ruffling Sherlock’s hair and lowering himself into his lap, bringing their faces centimeters apart. “Should I get you a security blanket and a binky too?”
“Because,” Sherlock leaned forward and whispered something in the kid’s ear. John watched the boy’s face go white as a sheet and when Sherlock leaned back he pointed numbly to a door at the back of the shop and looked nervously at John. John furrowed his brows and watched Sherlock push through the door, leaving him and the kid in silence. After a few minutes the kid dropped a paper plate of chips in front of John.
John set down his tea on the side table, next to where the book he had threatened Sherlock with was lying, and brought Sherlock his tea. He offered the plate of cookies and Sherlock selected one of John’s messily decorated ornaments. John sat back down into his chair, picking out a snowman for himself. They settled into a comfortable quiet, the pile of cranes growing around Sherlock, until eventually it seemed to bury him, serving as a makeshift blanket. John picked up the book that had almost ended up of Sherlock’s side of the room, and began skimming through it, before settling on an interesting chapter about bone marrow. They stayed like that for some time, Sherlock occasionally coughing and upsetting a bird on his stomach, John looking up attentively every time to make sure he was ok. And each time, Sherlock would give him a little smile to let him know he was fine and John could relax his tensed shoulders. But John knew, the instinct to take care of Sherlock was one that would never go away.
John laughed and took a step back, “ok.”
“That thing, where your scarf flaps in the breeze and you look all cool and mysterious.”
“I am in no way capable of taking care of you the way you’ve taken care of me,” he said, “so don’t go getting sick, ok?”
He grabbed spoons and headed back to living room where Sherlock had set his book facedown on the armrest and was waiting, knees tucked up to his chin, for John. John handed his bowl and sat back down, cross legged, in his chair. They ate their soup and John updated him on how the blog was going. Sherlock, after checking his phone, realized he had missed several calls from his parents and texts from Mycroft saying “mum and dad are worried, call them please.” And a few minutes later “call them goddamn it!”
“Well actually, I also had something I wanted to talk to the three of you about,” said Molly, “and Mycroft if you could pass this on to Greg,” John and Sherlock both turned to look at Mycroft, John in confusion, Sherlock with an expression of haughty triumph, before turning their attention to Molly. “I was thinking,” she said “that we could do a secret Santa this year.”
“No,”
Sherlock cleaned up the flour from rolling out the dough and John made the icing while they waited for the cookies to bake. When the timer dinged Sherlock pulled the cookies out and set them on the cooling rack while John separated the icing into smaller bowls and began dripping food coloring into them. When Sherlock saw what he was doing he came over and raised a critical eyebrow at John’s handiwork. “Here, let me do that,” he said, taking the bottle of red dye from John’s hand, and somehow, with his scientific exactness, made a set of brighter icings than John ever could have.
John coughed and took a sip of his water. To the other customers he probably looked like he was having some kind of fit. Hell, he was having some kind of fit. “Ok, that’s enough of that conversation,” he said. Sherlock’s eyebrows were raised in amusement. He never got very embarrassed or bashful about these things, and apparently John’s display of discomfort was amusing to him.
Despite his exhaustion, when they got back to Baker Street and hung up their coats John turned to Sherlock and held out his arms. “Alright, come here,” he said and scooped up Sherlock. Sherlock let out a surprised yelp and wrapped his arms around John neck.
“Want to try letting go?” John asked him, nodding to the railing. Sherlock met his eyes and slowly lifted his hand from the side of the ice rink. He slid one foot back, pushing forward towards John, but almost immediately fell and landed on his bum. A giggle escaped John’s lips and Sherlock shot him a glare before pushing himself up to stand. He managed to skate to where John was standing a few feet away, but grabbed John’s hand the second he was within arms-length distance of him. John squeezed his hand, still fighting back a laugh, and glided forward, hand tucked assuredly into Sherlock’s.
“Sherlock the weather should not dictate whether or not you protect you country.”
“Fine but you owe me a hot chocolate,” he snapped, “and I get absolute authority on authority on ornament placement.” He put a lid on his Petri dish, dumped his test tubes in the sink, and stomped over to the tree, his dressing gown swishing angrily at his ankles.
Sherlock himself was also gazing out the window, but John knew his mind was entirely elsewhere. When they pulled up outside the crime scene Sherlock was out of the door before the car had even stopped, leaving John to pay the cabbie and chase after him.
“Alright,” called Sherlock after a few minutes, “Lestrade, come here.” John and Lestrade stood and headed back over to where Sherlock and the body were. Once they got closer Sherlock began pointing out things on the body. “She shows none of the signs of recent long-distance travel, establishing that she lives here and isn’t some kind of tourist or visitor. Her clothes are expensive, but not designer,” he said, indicating to her outfit, “and it seems that she’s dressed for work. Her outfit indicates that she works in a high-power job, in a nicer area, but not in a very high position, a hypothesis supported by her age. Based on how worn her heels are we can see that she walks quite a bit, but the scuff marks show that that walking is done outside rather than indoors. Therefore, she walks to work every day, rather than taking the tube or some other form of transportation.”
“The Candy Cane Murders? Sounds like a good blog post.”
“Right, of course,” Sherlock walked towards the door, “We’ll see you after that?” He pulled open the door for John as Molly nodded. “Excellent, goodbye,” he said and followed John out into the hallway.
“Oh. I must have deleted that information in favor of something else,” he said. John made annoyed eye contact with Lestrade, who seemed amused by this exchange.
“Wait a minute, it actually snowed?” John looked up from the coffee machine, which seemed to have given up on making coffee, and met Sherlock’s eyes.
“Well you can control how cool and mysterious you look.”
For a long time the only sound was the sound of the snow hitting the roof, the clock ticking on the mantle, and the synchronized breathing of John and Sherlock, occasionally interrupted by the sound of a page turning. The snow seemed to have muffled the entire world and the usual sounds of car horns and people talking on cell phones had died away, leaving only the sounds contained within the little world of 221B Baker Street.
“The Adventure of the Peppermint Bark Plot.”
“Look, do you want to come over after work and watch a Christmas movie or something?” he asked her. Both Molly and John stared at him in amazement.
“Oh come on John, that’s nothing. I just admitted to breaking and entering.”
“Yes, as a matter of fact I do,” Mycroft said primly. Sherlock nodded and made a sound of self satisfaction.
When John heard him coming back upstairs there were two sets of footsteps instead of one. He furrowed his brow and leaned forward, trying to figure out who was with Sherlock this early in the morning on a holiday. A minute later Sherlock appeared in the doorway to the kitchen, Mrs. Hudson close behind him. “Merry Christmas dear,” she said to John as she crossed the kitchen threshold and walked towards him. Her expression was bright and wide-awake in a way John knew he and Sherlock wouldn’t become for another hour.
“Well, you know. Connected. In sync with each other. People always think you’re a couple anyway.” This, John had to admit, was true. “I’d have thought you two would get together sooner honestly,” Lestrade continued. John shrugged and continued examining the ground.
John leaned his head against Sherlock’s shoulder for a moment and sighed contentedly, happy to have an excuse to be this close to Sherlock. But when Sherlock didn’t tense under the weight of John’s head on his shoulder John left it there, letting himself bask in Sherlock’s warmth. Instead of getting uncomfortable Sherlock turned his head to the side, resting his chin on top of John’s head and looking over him out onto the street below.
“Nothing.”
They pulled the blanket back and forth a few times before settling into a comfortable middle ground where the blanket was somehow pulled up past Sherlock’s chin, but only covering John’s feet, which was all he needed. He began to nod off, lulled by the soft sound of Sherlock’s breathing and the dull white noise of the storm outside.
The kid, picking up on Sherlock’s abrupt change in character, narrowed his eyes. “Why should I tell you?” he asked.
Sherlock’s eyes appeared over the top of the paper. “I would prefer if you didn’t, but you’re welcome to try if you like, might spice things up a bit.” John sighed and set down the book that had been lying on the side table.
As they drove along the driver chattered away, pointing out some of the more notable sites, but Sherlock and John, already familiar with London, tuned him out and instead listened to the sound of each other’s breathing and the jingling of the bells that were strung along the side of the carriage. Somewhere in the distance a group of people were singing “Silver Bells” and John smiled at the parallels between the song and this moment, feeling the magic of the holidays in the air around him.
John looked between them and frowned, “how do you even know that?”
Out on the street people were hurrying by or ducking into doorways to avoid the snow. It was still just lightly falling, not even really dusting the top of buildings. Flakes were caught in Sherlock’s hair and John found himself staring at them, confused and mesmerized by the fact that they didn’t melt. He had a sudden urge to brush them away, and his acted on it, running his hand across the top of Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock didn’t react. Instead he seemed lost in thought as they walked down the street. “Any ideas?” John asked.
They walked in silence for a while before John saw a cafe coming up at the end of the street. “Want some hot chocolate?” he asked Sherlock as they walked towards it.
“Whatever should we do with all our extra time?” Sherlock asked in a jokingly despairing tone.
“Obviously not,” said Sherlock, leaning forward and resting his elbows on the table, placing his chin on the tips of his steepled fingers. His sheepish expression was gone, replaced by a curious grin, the one he got when he was determined to figure something out. “Alright, your turn,” he said, “I’m sure you got up to all sorts of terrible things at university.” John blushed slightly and leaned back in his chair.
John felt a warm glow in his ribcage when Sherlock said that. “Yes well, we can’t have both of us laid up in bed, now can we?”
“Stop doing that.”
They whiled away the morning, waiting for Mycroft to arrive. When he did it was with an unhappy expression. He brushed off his shoulders in a dignified, yet annoyed, gesture. “I hate snow,” he lamented. “It gets everywhere and it’s entirely disgusting at this point, all the cars and dirt have turned it the most abhorrent shade of gray.”
Sherlock blinked at him for a moment before nodding curtly and lifting the violin once again to his shoulder. He paused for a moment, bow hovering over strings, and hesitated. He seemed undecided about something, like he was waging a mental battle over what to do. Then, just as suddenly as he had lifted it, Sherlock set the violin down and turned away.
John smiled and shook his head, “yes, I think it would.” He stood and went into the kitchen, where he put the kettle on and grabbed a few cookies from the batch they had made the other day. He straightened up around the kitchen while he waited for the kettle and when it was ready he poured the hot water into the two waiting mugs. When the tea was ready, earl grey for him, lemon and ginger for the flu-addled Sherlock, he brought the mugs, along with the plate of cookies, back into the living room, where Sherlock had begun folding the pages of the newspaper into giant paper cranes. The was one sitting on the floor next to him, and a second was being formed in his hands.
They stood together in the doorway for a moment, John nervously biting his lip, intimidated by the task before them, and Sherlock with his hand placed determinedly on his hips. “Shall we?” he said, looking over at John, who took a deep breath and nodded.
John spluttered in amazement, first of all this was so out of character for Sherlock, who usually hurtled over all of the usual human necessities to get straight into solving crimes, and second of all, there was a body that needed inspecting! “Well, shouldn’t we be heading out then?”
“And even if I didn’t have his name for secret Santa, I’d still have this problem. I want to get him something nice, but I have no idea what to give him. As Sherlock and our parents can attest,” he said to John, “I am terrible at giving gifts.”
“Yes, really. Why on Earth is the information that tomorrow is a holiday important? I only need to know it’s a holiday on the holiday. Any other time is a waste of brain space.” John shook his head in disbelief and Sherlock shrugged as if this were a perfectly normal explanation. Taking John’s hand, he began walking away from the crime scene and back towards Baker Street.
John, who had sat down in his chair, bit the inside of his cheek and frowned, fully aware that the music Sherlock played served as a map of the inside of his brain. This music was confused and frustrated, searching and searching but not finding its rhythm. After a few minutes the music changed. Sherlock played one long note, which hung in the air for a moment before being overtaken by a string of quick eager notes, which Sherlock played with fervor.
John shook his head in amazement and disbelief, “and no one caught you?”
“Come on Mycroft, back me up in this,” said Molly, turning to the previously silent Holmes brother.
“No, boring.” John maneuvered the door closed with his foot and went to the kitchen where he unceremoniously dumped the groceries onto the counter. He then went back into the living room, catching Sherlock’s ball as he did so. He bent over Sherlock so that their chests were parallel and gave him a long kiss. As he began to pull back Sherlock followed him, starting to sit up on his elbows. John broke away and began to rise. “No, stay here. Kiss me again,” said Sherlock.
Fingers interlaced on the back of Sherlock’s neck, John leaned forward further, his shoulders and hips pushed against Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s shoulder blades reached for one another as he arched his back away from the doorframe, curving his torso against John’s. His hands were still on John’s back and he gripped John’s shirt, the fabric bunching in his fingers.
“Sherlock,” John whispered as they made their way from the front door to the bedroom, “I thought we were on the nice list.”
“Yes Mrs. Hudson. You really shouldn’t have,” agreed Sherlock holding up his own sweater, a green and red argyle number. John looked down at the sweater in his lap, cream with blue and grey snowflakes, and grimaced internally. He wasn’t opposed to sweaters, but this was one he wasn’t looking forward to wearing in public.
“Yes, this one’s for you,” she said, handing him the top box. “And this one’s for you.” She brought the second box to where Sherlock was sitting in his chair and handed it to him. He smiled, set the lab report Molly had sent him aside, and took the box into his hands. John sat down into chair and glanced at Sherlock, who gave him a questioning look. John shrugged slightly as if to say “I don’t know any more than you do.”
After the waiter was gone he took a deep breath. “Well me and my mates TP’d my professor’s house once.”
“You don’t mean to tell me that in college you broke into a morgue and experimented on the dead bodies?” John exclaimed, his eyes widening in shock. Sherlock nodded, slightly sheepishly, and glanced around the room to see if anyone else had heard. They were having dinner at a new a Italian restaurant had opened up down the street from their flat when the revelation that Sherlock had illegally experimented on medical students’ cadavers in college came out. “Sherlock, that’s not allowed.”
Sherlock let out an annoyed huff of breath, “well you made me buy those stupid holiday cookie cutters, so we might as well do the shapes option. I didn’t realize we were going to have to wait two hours for our cookies though.”
John smiled, “me too, actually.”
Despite their romantic moment inside, when they stepped out the door Sherlock shoved his hands deep into his pockets before John could reach out. John has been surprised to find that, in spite of his own vehement denial of his own sexuality, it was Sherlock who shied away from holding hands in public. “Alright John, where is our mystery destination?” He asked.
“I suppose we will,” said John, he eyes following Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock, realizing that John was watching, stopped and they both looked up, Sherlock with his eyebrows raised and John with a slightly sheepish expression.
“I don’t suppose there’s anything else you wanted to show me?” Sherlock asked indignantly.
“Going out?” she asked him.
“Well go change then, we need to go!” Sherlock sighed and got up from his chair.
“Of course,” said Sherlock. It seemed for a moment that everyone else in the room disappeared and it was just the two of them, holding each other close. Sherlock lifted his head a few moments later. “Shall I play some Christmas carols?” he asked.
He began responding to them as Sherlock drained the last of his hot chocolate and picked up his violin. He began to play, looking down at the street from the window as he did so. It was to the sound of Sherlock’s playing that John spent the next few hours, sunken into his chair and working on his blog. The sound of violin music and computer keys filled 221B Baker Street for the rest of the afternoon and into the night as John and Sherlock spent time both together and in their own private worlds.
“Good, we can out and enjoy the snow while it lasts then.”
They ordered a minute later and the serious tone that had overtaken their meal lifted. John, eager to change the subject, looked over at Sherlock and raised his eyebrows. “So,” he said, “I still cannot get over that fact that my so-called dark and mysterious boyfriend is taking me to a film for children.”
“No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to do that,” he said.
Covent Garden was twinkling in the soft evening light. The Christmas lights had begun flickering on and the street was lit up with a golden glow. Sherlock and John walked along the street, surrounded by excited tourists, all swiveling their heads every which way to catch a glimpse of everything that London had to offer. John found them adorable, Sherlock found them annoying. They had just finished having dinner and seeing a movie, and were on their way back to Baker Street. “Good god, they’re everywhere,” said Sherlock, looking pointedly at the tourists.
“I’m afraid that I, for once, am on my brother’s side. I have no desire to participate in your secret Santa.” John let out an exasperated breath.
John opened his mouth, maybe in shock, maybe to answer, but before he could say anything the waiter appeared with their food. He set a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo in front of Sherlock and Chicken Parmesan in front of John.  “Anything else I can get you?” he asked. John shook his head, his nervous eyes never leaving Sherlock’s mischievous ones.
John sighed at Sherlock’s self diagnosis, but knew that he was probably right, so he stood. “Alright, I’m going to get you some water,” he said, “you need to drink lots of fluids today. And don’t get out of bed, you need to rest.”
“Mmm, no,” Sherlock murmured, “lets just stay in this park forever.”
“Do you want something to read?”
“What’s that?” Asked Sherlock.
“It’s Christmas,” he said, “the paper doesn’t come out on Christmas. Without looking up from the table Sherlock took a sip of his coffee and asked Mrs. Hudson to get him a piece of toast.
“No,” they said at the same time, which was a lie. As a matter of fact, their first kiss had been in a pumpkin patch. They’d been investigating a crime that had occurred there when it happened.
“You?”
John shook his head. “Don’t exaggerate your well-being so you can get back to work sooner,” he said, pointing his fork at Sherlock, “no one recovers from the flu that fast. Though you do seem to be healing remarkably quickly.”
After a few minutes, John was steadily fucking into the other man and pulled his head back for air.
"I'm going to count to three. If your naked arse isn't bent over my lap by the time I'm at three, you're going to be in big trouble, young man," John said steadily in his controlling voice.
Sherlock grinned and shivered as the cool air hit her skin, goosebumps spreading over her body. Joan wrapped her arms gently around the brunette's waist, turning her in her arms to bring them face to face. Their lips met easily and the kiss turned filthy quick.
John tossed his girlfriend, Sherlock, on to the bed and quickly settled between her legs, kissing her sweetly and slowly inching her dark blue dress up over her thighs so her dark red panties were the only thing covering her from the waist down.
Sherlock mewled in delight as his Alpha slid into him with no preparation, his hole loose and wet from his heat.
John licked his lips as he slowly kissed his way down her body, stopping along the way to kiss and suck at her throat and collar bones. Sherlock groaned and pressed her heels into the mattress trying to seek out friction against her mound.
"C'mon Sherlock, you've done so well. Come for me now, gorgeous."
"Sorry, they didn't have a double room. This was the best they had," he said, somewhat awkwardly, as they entered the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock had retaliated with a sharp, "I know enough not to get multiple STI's in the last month, unlike you."
Sherlock handled them carefully, putting the stack down on the bed, picking up the jumper from the top...
Joan gasped and tightened her fingers around Sherlock's arms, bucking her hips wildly, but in tune with the rhythm Sherlock set.
"God you're beautiful. Do me a favor and lie there like that. No touching yourself." John said softly then sternly.
His knees gave out and he pretended like he was crouching down to inspect something further, but with his eyes squeezed shut as the shock of a sudden orgasm took hold of his body and he panted quietly.
John went to the bathroom and did his evening routine. When he finished brushing his teeth, he reached back into his overnight bag and after a few minutes of digging through it, realized he had left his suppressants at home. With a groan, he picked up his discarded clothes and brought them back to be packed into his suitcase in the bedroom.
John grinned and sat back on his heels to grip his own cock and jerk it roughly until he came moments later, leaving streaks over Sherlock's cock and the toy sticking out of him.
After they shower together, they take their time drying each other off with fluffy towels, and make their way to bed. John loves to lay his partner down gently and sweetly kiss his face, neck, clavicles. He loves sinking his nose deep in Sherlock's perfect hair and leaving soft chaste kisses on his temples. He left several more soft kisses on the detective's face then leaned back to straddle Sherlock's lap.
Sherlock writhed and moaned at the overstimulation and ecstasy of being bred by his big strong Alpha. John just grinned and leaned down to nuzzle at his lover and hold him through it.
Sherlock finally gave in and leaned back enough to slip Joan's soft leggings down her thighs and off her legs completely, running her hands from the blogger's knees up to the top to her thighs' smoothing over the goosebumps that lie there.
"Good boy," John said and he untangled his hand from Sherlock's hair and patted the top of his head gently. He sat down on the edge of the bed and patted his lap. "Go ahead and lay on my lap for me, Sherlock," he said quietly.
Sherlock groaned softly watching John mess with it a bit, wanting nothing more than for John to turn it on high and shove it in him dry.
thank you for reading! comments and kudos are appreciated!
Sherlock carefully laid him on the bed and started a warm bath for the Omega, to calm him down a bit. After a few minutes, he came back to find John stripped down to his pants and struggling to tug his shirt off, "Hot! Too hot!" he was whining.
Sherlock smiled, content, and drifted to sleep.
John immediately stopped thrusting, pulled out, and wrapped a hand around the base of his cock, taking a minute to calm his body down from his near orgasm state.
John sighed and turned to unpack his things nice and orderly, whereas Sherlock will probably just live out of his suitcase.
Thanks for reading again!! Comment any prompts you’d like to see ;)

Sherlock panted for a minute or so as John pulled out of him before collapsing on his side. John made quick of tearing the soiled sheets off the bed, using them to clean himself, and tossing them on the floor before crawling into bed and pulling the detective over to lie on his chest.
Slowly but surely, John pushed the head of his cock into the ring of muscle and slowly sunk deep into the other man. Sherlock gasped and squirmed against the desk, bearing down on the big cock impaling him for the first time. He felt the burn through his whole body, even down to his toes.
When the toy could finally be seated fully inside the detective, John immediately began fucking him with it, pumping it in and out at brutal pace, and jerking his cock in the same rhythm.
Sherlock caught his breath and flinched at the sudden loss of John in him. With wide eyes he turned around and got on his knees, "Please sir, don't punish me please I couldn't help it I couldn-"
"Well, John," Dr. Frankland started, "If you ever want to continue this, you know how to get a hold of me," he said with a wink.
Sherlock just smirked and closed the en suite door behind himself. After a couple of minutes, John heard the shower start. He sighed and changed into his own pajamas and laid down to get some rest.
Joan gulped and obeyed, scurrying to the bedroom and stripping as fast as she could. Almost as soon as she had settled the the position she was ordered in, Sherlock had come through the door. She was in nothing but a long purple button up that was unbuttoned, showing off her chest. She climbed on the bed and sat back on her heels between Joan's legs, admiring the view. Joan blushed red as a tomato and rolled her hips enticingly at the dark haired woman. Sherlock smirked and ran her fingertips down her girlfriend's sides until they landed just below her bellybutton. Joan whimpered and bucked her hips up but Sherlock held them down with a firm hand. "Now you be a good girl and lay back for me. Let me do all the work," she whispered and moved so her face was directly in front of Joan's most sensitive area.
John leaned up and pressed a tentative peck to the corner of Sherlock's mouth and snuggled back against him. "Thank you for helping me. I know it's not your sort of thing. I hope you didn't feel forced, I don't remember much before you entered me. I must've been delirious."
Joan smiled as she watched her girlfriend get ready for bed in the bathroom mirror, slipping her fingers gently between the strands of ebony curls on the detective's head, massaging her tense scalp.

"It's time for your reward, Sherlock. Come for me, right now."
"Okay Mr. Holmes it's time for everyone favorite part of their physical. Drop your trousers, please." He said with a pleasant smile.
"Looks like you're in today for physical. Is that correct, Mr. Holmes?" Dr. Watson asked, writing something on the clipboard in his hand.
Sherlock stared at him for a minute, in a thinking pose, before speaking again. "It most certainly will not happen again. What clothes are you wearing tomorrow?"
Sherlock's favorite part of making love to John is feeling John's love sink deep into his skin and directly to his heart.
It was John's turn to smirk, "Now make sure when you go back over there, don't make a fool of anyone else or so help me God, I will turn this thing up to the highest setting."
"C'mon Sherlock we only have a few minutes until Lestrade comes back." John loudly whispered, sinking his fingers into Sherlock's thick curls. Sherlock grinned up at him in response and bit his lip. They were in an unused conference room at New Scotland Yard in a dark corner where no one would find them. Lestrade had told them he had evidence for a case and left them in the hallway a minute prior, telling them he'd be right back.
"No, Sherlock I told you you couldn't come. Don't you dare come without permission," John warned sternly.
When John began to feel the heat and tightness that came with an orgasm, he pulled Sherlock off and brought his face up to kiss him roughly.
im a lesbian so...
From across the room, John could tell that Sherlock was too young for him.
"You can still stand by yourself," he said, to which John whined. "I drew you a bath. Come on," Sherlock said and gently led the Omega to the en suite. John reached to yank his pants off and Sherlock turned away to give him privacy, but John held onto his wrist and muttered a small, "I don't mind."
The doctor leaned down and softly kissed the other man. "You're being so good for me, Sherlock. Keep it up and I'll let you come tonight," he murmured against Sherlock's lips.
An involuntary shiver ran down Dr. Watson’s spine and he pulled the student back to look at him in the face. “I trust that you wouldn’t, but anyone could see or hear us and it would be over. You would be expelled and I would be without a job.”
Sherlock gasped and jerked his hips forward, seeking relief for his aching cock as John started to continuously finger fuck him and hit his prostate every time. It didn't take long for Sherlock to feel his balls draw up tight against his body and for ejaculate to pump out of the tip of his cock onto the exam table below him.
“Stay right there John,” he said, lightly touching John’s shoulder and slowly climbing the last of the stairs. John frowned and furrowed his brow, confused by the sudden appearance of mistletoe in their doorway, but not nearly as apprehensive as Sherlock. Sherlock stopped on the top step and bent forward, scanning the doorway and surrounding area for any clues as to who had put the mistletoe where it was.
Sherlock took the last bites of his toast and went over to the couch, where he laid down with his hands behind his head and his feet extended over the armrest, closing his eyes. John drank the final dregs of his coffee and went into the living room where Sherlock was stretched out. He considered sitting down in his own chair, but decided against it and went over to the couch where Sherlock was laying. “Scoot over,” he said, tapping Sherlock on the shoulder.
“Ok, if you could do anything right now, what would you do?”
“How does one go their entire adult life without acquiring any Christmas tree ornaments?” Was John’s retort. Sherlock shrugged, tilted his head as if to say “touché,” and began assessing John’s massive ornament collection.
“Aright, now you’re just being mean.”
“Come on Sherlock, we’ve got nothing to do today and if we sit around here you’ll get bored and start setting things on fire.”
“How much?” John asked the driver. The ride was colossally overpriced, but Sherlock sighed and appeased John by pulling out his wallet. John grinned up at him and the look that he gave Sherlock made it worth it. They climbed up into the back of the carriage and sat down, covering themselves with the fluffy red blanket that had been waiting in the seat. They were smushed together, the sides of their legs and shoulders pressed close against one another. Through his coat, John could feel Sherlock’s muscles relax as they leaned against one another and melted together, John fitting perfectly against Sherlock’s side.
‘No,” said Sherlock, “that’s fine. But can I have that piece of paper in her hand?”
“What on earth Sherlock?” John asked, adjusting himself into a more comfortable position.
“What the…?” John looked at Sherlock, who hadn’t taken his eyes off the mistletoe. Sherlock squinted and tilted his head, examining the mistletoe and doorframe from a distance. John could see him taking in every detail of the scene with a sharp, analytic eye.
He glared at it combatively, as if it were an enemy to beat and quickly took a swig, throwing his head back to gargle before spitting the water back into the glass. It had been one fluid motion and when he was finished he held the glass away from his body in revulsion. John, who was much less easily disgusted, took the glass from him and dumped it in the sink.
“What? No, that’s not why I’m here,” Mycroft glanced nervously at John, which John found odd. All of Mycroft’s body language at the moment was odd. “I um, I came on a personal matter.”
John wanted to stop Sherlock on the landing and kiss him into oblivion right there, but fearing the ears of Mrs. Hudson, stopped himself. John could hear his own heart beating, it drowned out the sound of their steps, drowned out the sound of their breath, drowned out the sound of Sherlock turning the door handle to their flat. He pushed open the door, stepping through, and John followed him.
“Yes Sherlock, tomorrow is Christmas,” John said exasperatedly
“It’s fine,” John said at the same time that Sherlock muttered under his breath about punctuality. “You’re not one to talk,” John said, looking up at Sherlock. Sherlock frowned and Greg went to stand next to Mycroft, who gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. “So, should we do secret Santa now or later?” John asked.
“Alright, now then?” John asked. Everyone nodded and they moved sit down. John ran into the bedroom to grab his and Sherlock’s gifts. When he came back Mrs. Hudson had settled into his chair so he perched on the armrest of Sherlock’s, handing Sherlock his gift as he sat down. Sherlock took it and set it in his lap, looking up and smiling at John in thanks. John smiled back and looked around the room.
Sherlock nodded. “Me too,” he said quietly. John raised his eyebrows in surprise and gave Sherlock’s hand a quick squeeze. The truth was, he didn’t really spend much time thinking about the future or how he wanted to live his life when he was old. And he didn’t think Sherlock was the sort to think about that a lot either. But since he’d gotten together with Sherlock he had found a life that he wanted to keep. It felt like a precious gem, or a fragile child, that he was cradling in his hand, desperate not to drop it or let it go. Instead he wanted to hold on forever, making sure that it never got hurt.
“Let’s do it now,” chimed in Molly.
“What am I supposed to tell my readers? That you examined a body, then sat around and figured it out in your mind palace?” John asked.
John smiled. “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
“How could you possibly- you know what, please don’t tell me.” Sherlock laughed and looked down at John with his lips pressed exaggeratedly together. “I was just thinking about how maybe, we could do this forever,” John said, “you and me I mean.”
They sat like that for the rest of the afternoon and into the evening, Sherlock working on the case and John going between writing for his blog and staring out at the quickly melting snow. Across the street people were putting up Christmas lights and he watched as they struggled on their increasingly slippery surface. At one point Sherlock got up and gave John a kiss on the cheek. Later he called Lestrade to explain what he had figured out about the paper. “Yes, it has everything to do with the case!” John heard him yell. “Idiot,” he muttered as he hung up and plopped into his chair.
John could feel his voice getting thick with affection as he gazed at Sherlock’s brightly lit face. “You,” he said, feeling silly, but not caring. Sherlock blinked slowly and didn’t say anything. He still seemed a little lost when it came to openly showing affection for one another. They’d finally gotten around to admitting their feelings for each other two months ago and things had been progressing slowly but steadily since. And John was certainly glad the silently pining phase was over, he couldn’t say he enjoyed feeling like a teenager again.
“No,” said Sherlock stonily, “I am not. I would prefer to never come here again, too much cheer.” He said the last part with a playful glint in his eye.
“Here,” said John, leaning back and grabbing the deerstalker hat that was shoved in the corner. He placed it on Sherlock’s head and Sherlock’s frown deepened. “Now you’re a proper detective.” He winked at Greg, who grinned back. Sherlock sighed and reached up to touch the hat. He didn’t take it off before handing John his gift.
When Sherlock was finished talking he promised to follow up on a few theories and get back to Lestrade. “Come on, John,” he said, turning away from Lestrade. John followed him down the street and they walked quietly for a moment before John realized they weren’t headed back towards Baker Street.
Sherlock picked up his violin from where it had been sitting in the corner and placed it on his shoulder. When he rested the bow to the strings the sound that came out was piercing and urgent, the tempo fast, but muddled, like it was searching for the right beat, but couldn’t quite find it. Sherlock’s fingers quickened, plucking at the strings and pushing the bow faster and faster across the strings, searching for the right melody.
But that's where Sherlock dug his heels in, "No, John. I'm not your Alpha. I can't nest with you," he tried to convince himself more than John.
John groaned and gave in, pulling Sherlock by the arm into his office and shutting and locking the door behind them. He made quick work of pushing Sherlock up on his desk and unbuttoning both of their shirts, while kissing the younger man.
John gasped, "Please please breed me, hurt me, tear me apart, Alpha!" he demanded, rutting down into the sheets.
Sherlock was in the shower, scrubbing his entire body vigorously for tonight's bedroom activities. John had suggested it to him earlier in the week and Sherlock had spent the next few days researching and trying to understand why his partner had any desire to perform the act on him at all. John had explained that he wanted to and he wanted Sherlock to experience it at least once before he made any assessments.
