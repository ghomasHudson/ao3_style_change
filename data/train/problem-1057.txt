“You entice me into dangerous enterprises on a regular basis,” I reminded him warmly.  I lifted our joined hands and kissed the back of his, as he had kissed mine that night.  Even now that I had had his lips on mine every second of that touch was emblazoned on my brain.  “Though I wonder that you risked saying as much as you did, if you could see no good end.  If you truly thought I would either refuse you or accept you more out of friendly regard than passion.”  The last thing in the world I had ever known Sherlock Holmes to be was afraid of the truth- but understanding why he had been, I did not know why he had put it to me at all.  I was glad he had, infinitely glad, since it was distinctly possible things would not be as they were now otherwise.  I nuzzled his knuckles to let him know how glad I was he had spoken, even if I had taken the long way around to hearing him.  “I am not sure I would have had the courage.”
I attempted to steer the conversation in a safer direction without appearing to do so.  Otherwise I would only sharpen his interest.  “I mean that he was sure of her- or thought he was sure of her- and we cannot actually presuppose that she loved him then after all.  Perhaps he was right and she saw him only as a friend.”
“Yes,” Holmes said at last.  “You do truly have a storyteller’s gift.  That is the word, for lack of a better.  I was moved.”
Holmes read aloud to me from the paper one morning that Captain Crocker’s ship had been involved in the rescue of some civilians at sea.  “It seems,” he said, “that our friend will return to his lady with many accolades.”
I had only kept one secret from Holmes, and I had kept it well.  I could not now blame him for having insufficient data when that insufficiency was of my own design.  And he was aloof by nature- I would not now deceive myself about that.  I knew him capable of great affections- for his brother, for his friends and allies, for perfect strangers innocent of the horrors that befell them.  Holmes’ problem had never really been a lack of heart, only a lack of expression.  He had such great feeling in him for humanity at large, for the good and the suffering which by turns existed for it.  It was no small thing to know that he had great feeling for me as well- but I did not deceive myself.  Some of his distaste for affairs of the heart could be explained if his heart was... unnaturally inclined- but not all.  Holmes
He was lying back, watching me with softly lidded eyes.  “It should be easier if it was not you.  With regard to... well.  The stipulations of our agreement.”
This aversion to the softer feelings in him had been my sentence to purgatory ever since that very uncommon occurrence had happened to me, but it had also been my shield.  At one time it had been easy- too easy, in hindsight- to convince myself that my fascination with Holmes, my affection for him, my whole-hearted need to watch him, to see all of him, so much so that if he was the last thing I looked upon in this world I would be content, was simply his due as the most extraordinary man of my acquaintance.  But it is only possible to follow the line of a man’s wrist so many times with a hungry gaze before it becomes obvious that there is desire in play.  And this self-knowledge, once attained, was difficult to ignore; it had become doubly so after I thought him lost to me, and then had him back.  If he did not see that I desired him it was because- as he would say, were these feelings of mine some minute trace of a horrible crime- he was not looking for it.
“I won’t, if you wish it.  I only thought you might like to reconsider any new data before I put my findings to you.”
And as I looked at him, the future seemed to roll itself out before me like a fine carpet.  The changing seasons, the months collecting together into a year, a year in which little would probably change and yet everything would be different.  And then, God willing, we would hear again from our friend Crocker.  Of his great triumphs at sea, of his engagement, of his marriage and fine prospects.  We would not be able to tell him of the changes wrought between us, even though they were thanks in part to him and even though we kept a much darker secret for him- but I would know, and I would think it worth every minute and every doubt.
very great, but looking back on that first night what was most odd was Holmes’ listless yet undeniable desire to make things not odd.
“Is there a reason I should not?  I drank only a little and the injury, you recall, was to my arm- not my head.”
“I think anything possible,” Holmes replied.  Something sardonic in his tone worried me a little, but the worry did not have time to sink in to any real extent before he spoke again.  He sounded more hesitant than anything.  “For instance, sometime after the boat, she did come to love him.”
“I believe you.  Nevertheless, I fear you have been right.”  I lifted my hand to trace the line of his cheek.  “Holmes.”  It was distinctly difficult to breathe as my thumb slid across his firm lip and his eyes drifted closed.  “Our agreement-”
I watched as he unfolded his arms and lit a cigarette.  In his hands and in his eyes I saw a tension different from the night before.  Then I had been reminded of his behavior while on a case he thought might be hopeless, all grim energy and sharp determination.  Now I was reminded of his behavior on a case that was not hopeless as such, but nevertheless out of his hands.  He was waiting, as he always waited when he had done his utmost and knew what happened next would be determined by another.  Usually what he awaited was a criminal’s mistake.  Today what he awaited seemed to be me, and that sent a thrill through me which might have been pleasure, but if it was, it was the sort of pleasure not readily distinguishable from fear.
Hopkins’ eyes lit.  “But you may not have heard that there was another such robbery- committed by three men, and so on- also in Kent just last night.”
Threatening me with other doctors was sufficiently of a piece with Holmes' usual sourness when he appeared weak that I would normally have been able to ignore him.  But he had lost blood, he was tired, and he was in pain.  He had also already consumed more brandy than I would have prescribed for purely medicinal reasons.  It all conspired to put a dreaminess in his tone, a kind of tender frankness so sweet that I could not ignore even the smallest twitch of his eye, let alone
was right- that to fall into a melancholy stupor over the near-tragedy of young love lost was not at all like him.  “No,” I said at last.  “I do not.”
Until, one afternoon, he noticed me passing through the parlor and roused himself with a small smile.  “You’ve marked this concert, Watson,” he said.  He brandished the paper in which I had done so, not sure as I marked it if he would rouse himself in time for us to attend.  “Should you like to go?”
His eyes held mine very seriously, and it flooded through me like ice water that Holmes had not failed to observe me after all, and that I might not have heedlessly stumbled out onto dangerous ground but, rather, followed him there as I would follow him anywhere.  For a moment, suspicion ran rampant in me.  That he was trying to trap me, that I would shortly be ejected from Baker Street with nothing but a bag and a broken heart, that all this pretext was nothing but a cruel trick.  It was in this humor that I attempted to debate him as if we were still having an abstract conversation about love, and not my very life.  “Such feelings, as you term them, might not be so easily found out as that,” I said.  “They are not... the dirt beneath a gravedigger’s fingernails which announce his occupation.”
“You were explaining...” I shook my head.  “Clear as it has been so far, I am not sure I know what you were explaining.”
Holmes lowered his eyes, silent for a moment more.  Then he gave a fitful little shake of his head.  “That night," Holmes began at long last.  He gave a fitful little shake of his head and lowered his eyes.  "The night we met with Crocker... I really did wonder if I went a step too far, letting him go.  In truth I only half knew why I had done it.  Why giving him a chance was so important to me.  I was disturbed by that.  It was not until you said it that I fully understood that I saw a bit of myself in him.”
As I had hoped, he smiled.  “I shall take that as a compliment, though I am not sure it entirely is one.”  I had returned to my stitches by then and was nearly finished.  I caught a wince on that dear face, but it quickly faded into a little smile.  “Now, where was I?”
“From this... new data, as you call it, I am afraid we may draw two different and sadly opposite conclusions.”
“Have we been called out?” I asked.  I did not believe that we had, or he would have said so already.  But I would rouse myself and go if I was wrong, and I believed Holmes would see as much.  Holmes could not typically be urged into any confidence he did not wish to bestow- but I believe he found comfort in my willingness to go wherever he led me, and if it was enough to prompt him into whatever speech he was considering, so much the better for both of us.
He had interrogated his own motives to me in this way before.  It was rare enough to rouse me from my exhaustion with curiosity, but not so rare that I thought much about it beyond the intellectual problem.  “I supposed you moved by Crocker’s story,” I said.  It seemed to me that some unusual sympathy between large souls must have occurred.
As I said, it had been some months since it happened, and things had settled between us into such an easy normalcy in that time that it actually took me several moments to realize what 'agreement' he was referring to. The one in which I agreed to enjoy his friendship while he ignored my love.  I need hardly add that I was stung by the implication that I could not keep to it under the circumstances.  “Do you think so little of my medical skills?” I asked.
“I am glad of it,” I replied, though indeed I only spared a few thoughts for either of them.  By then the matter- however much it had sculpted relations between my friend and myself- had slipped from my mind almost altogether.  It would hardly have captured my memory at all, in fact, had Holmes not mentioned it directly before a much more profound- and violent- reordering of our lives at Baker Street occurred.
“Your faith in that regard is worth more to me than almost anything,” I replied.  “But you may be assured- when I think of you, and I think of you telling me you never wish to see me again, there is very little base in this world of which I do not become immediately capable.  No cowardice.  No weakness.  No duplicity.”
I spent a while noticing how the light cast a dark shadow of lashes across his cheek, and how his hair fell across his forehead, just slightly damp from the night’s exertions, and eventually I slept, knowing we would have to speak in the morning.
“I believe so,” I said.  And though I did appreciate his efforts not to strike me- I knew well the strength in that lithe frame and did not wish to know any better- I was tempted to tell him that I would not mind if he cried out or wept.  But I knew he controlled himself for his benefit as much as mine, so instead I said, “Indeed, though I would hardly have thought it possible, you seem more erudite than ever.”
That made him laugh, though he choked on it when I let my hand move over his, fingertips tracing the fine bones of his hand and threading through his fingers.  I did not know what more I could do, just then, to convince him he did not have to worry about something I might well have done under other circumstances.
a man somewhat distant in expression, and I would not ask him to be other than he was.  Probably there would be times yet to come when that distance made me doubt him again- but nevertheless I would take what he could give gladly, as I always had.  That I might have, all accidentally, advised him to hide what he did feel would have been laughable if it wasn’t so sad.  I remembered the conversation which began all this.  I had asked once, not really believing it, if he was distressed that two people in love had mistakenly hurt themselves and each other.  Realizing now that Holmes and I had been such a pair I was terribly distressed- but the remedy was in my hands, right where Holmes had put it when he tried to determine if I knew he loved me, and if so how and why I intended to keep quiet about it forever.
Holmes sat forward in his chair.  It brought us very close together.  “If you desired it,” he said lowly, “then you must have deceived me- I do not use that word in accusation, Watson, you would surely have had your reasons- for a long time.  If you did not, you might have deceived me for an hour at most, and while my faculties were... sadly diminished.  If only one of these can be true, you must see which presents itself most readily for consideration.”
“Yes.”  I swallowed.  I had led him to this very question, and now... well.  Now I had to answer it.  “Because an advance cannot be rebuffed if it isn’t made.”
I was close enough to him that it was nothing, nothing in the world even though it was everything in the world, to bring our lips together.  He was still for a moment, but then his lips moved against mine, and the whole of him shifted.  I let my hand slip from his cheek down his neck to his chest, and there I put pressure.  “Do not move,” I told him.  “I’ll not have my fine stitching ruined.”
I don’t know if even Holmes could read all of that from my expression, but he certainly read something that softened his smile, melted it into something liquid and warm.  I could see that look a thousand times and one, and never grow tired of it.  "I shall have to learn you too," he said, hand sliding backward into my hair.
As I talked, I kissed down his fingers, and the shell- no thicker than a hair to begin with, I assure you- of aloofness Holmes had managed to cover himself in began to crack.  Soon there were gaping chasms in it, whatever lay beneath pouring out of his eyes.
“I don’t think that can be true.  I am looking a man who has borne such unwarranted insults far more patiently then I deserve.  I never mean it, you know.”
I watched him from across the table until finally Holmes said, “You are treading very carefully, Watson.”  He sighed.  “I am sorry for it.”
I knew, too, that if I had wished it I might have hashed all of this out with him the night before.  I had not thought much about why at the time- but looking at him now I knew it nevertheless.  It was too important for Holmes to be in control of himself for me to start something with him out of it.  But, more than that, it was not for me to pick and choose which parts of him I addressed.  He was Sherlock Holmes, my friend, my partner in the solving of crime as I was his, and a great deal more besides.  He was the man who smiled at me over a paper and untouched eggs.  He was the man who was extremely rude when he felt threatened and sometimes for no reason at all.  He was the man who sometimes could not raise his eyes or voice to me at all.  He was the man who had looked at me with such undisguised adoration last night, as he bled from a wound inflicted by some fiend planning to slice him in half, that it had rewritten the world.  He was the man who looked at me now, as I examined the dressing I had placed on that same wound, like I was a poisonous snake.  He was everything.  He was-
It really was all.  I did not see him for most of the day, and many times over the course of it I thought it was absolutely ridiculous- on both our parts- to imagine that silence would do any good whatsoever.  Such feelings, even unspoken, could not be unknown.  But Holmes returned that night, and he smiled, and he told me what he had been doing- looking into young Hopkins’ progress, which was nonexistent- and I could breathe again.
He said, “I assure you, the only time wasted was what I spent arguing with Mrs. Hudson when I arrived.”
might have been troubled by the interview with Hopkins, but I still did not believe Holmes was except on my behalf, so it was not the police he worried about.
He was not eating.  “It’s not the inspector that troubles you, though, is it?” I said.  Holmes had not eaten even before Hopkins arrived.  I sat back in my chair, considered him a while, and finally resolved to return to our aborted conversation of last night.  “It’s this pair of lovers.”
My primary consolation on the subject was that Holmes must have made a similar mistake.  And from him, being who he was, the error certainly seemed the greater- but I still felt I bore the lion’s share of the blame.  His every move since the Abbey Grange case, when considered through the lens that he was not confronting me about my feelings but attempting to discover what I knew of his own, made as much sense as the opposite- more, in fact.  It was not like Holmes to come at an answered question so obliquely.  Oh, he kept his plots to himself before a case was resolved, and sometimes kept the full resolution to himself even after, but he hated not to have all laid bare somewhere in the middle.  It was difficult, in hindsight, to imagine him dancing so delicately around a question when he was sure of the answer- even if the answer was my entertaining certain softer feelings from which he held himself aloof.  If, on the other hand, the softer feelings were his and he thought them as unreciprocated as I had... that was something else.
The following morning, Holmes was so decidedly himself again, as he put it, that I could almost believe I had dreamed him otherwise.  But no- my friend was too decidedly himself.  He looked now and then as if the effort exhausted him more than any physical expenditure I could name.  I was half tempted to tell him that his efforts were in vain, that I saw he was still troubled and that I knew him too well and loved him too well to watch him take such pains projecting a comfort which he did not feel.  In the end I did not tell him.  I half longed to see his extreme reaction to my assertion of friendship again- for I was half sure that if I did while my brain was not so sleep-clogged and worry-addled I should perhaps understand it- but I dreaded it with equal power.
“You are looking at a man who is just possibly every bit as foolish and unobservant as you have ever accused him of being in your life.”
Hesitantly, I reached out and laid a light hand on his knee.  It was not true that silence was without its pitfalls.  I knew it was distinctly possible that Holmes would throw me off.  It hardly requires saying that for a man to know the creature he shares his rooms with loves him utterly is in fact miles different from a lady knowing that a gentleman friend adores her.  And so what casual contact there might be between two such close companions could invariably also become a source of strain.
His lips actually achieved a small smile, then.  It had helped him to try to face this as an intellectual problem.  I had hoped it would.  “You know my methods,” he said, as he had said a hundred times in this room.
But Holmes did not throw me off.  He remained very still beneath my hand, watching me with that same heavy-lidded interest I had found so compelling on countless cases.  But, of course, there was no expression his face could take on, no minute corner of his being, that I did concern myself with most highly.  Even so I did not flatter myself that I knew everything, but I felt I knew enough to think all might still be well between us.
transparent then because he was magnificent.  How could he think I did not love him on those grounds alone?  How could he think, if I did not love him, that it actually was a permanent state of affairs?  It might have been a rare thing between friends- but we were different- at least,
It was all so very clear to me, suddenly- in the same way I fancied it all was to him when he scented some crime or other.  The shield of silence must have been as important to Holmes as it had been to me- and yet as I had just considered, he hated to leave a mystery unsolved or a question unanswered.  Into that uncertainty came Captain Crocker, who said the words which might well have been written on Holmes’ soul as deeply as they were on mine.  That friendship, if it could be nothing else, was enough.  So Holmes used it to risk being a little more plain- plain enough that I understood he was not really talking of Crocker at all, though not so plain that I did not still mistake his meaning.  And he, seeing that I understood- as I thought I did- had believed he had his answer.  God in heaven- I had even thought myself so wise and understanding as I told him he could not hope that I could ever come to love him back.  Oh, certainly he too had made assumptions.  He too must have twisted the threads furnished him into the most abominable knots thinking he already knew the truth.  But while he set himself against all the worst things that beset mankind, I was the one who had made a study of him only.  I should have done better.  I would do, from now on, and would have before if I had not been so convinced he could not love me.
After a while, I managed, “Oh.”  And then, “My dear Holmes.  I do not know if I should be offended or not.”
When I returned to his side Holmes was on the sofa, his shirt fully removed.  It could not have been easy for him to do that in his condition, but knowing how he loathed being dirty I said nothing.  I sat beside him, cleaning the wound and preparing to stitch it shut.  “I do wish I could have got to this a bit earlier,” I said.  I kept my tone light, for if I was accusing him of something not even I knew what.  Not taking me with him, when he went wherever it was?  Not coming to me at my patient’s club, dripping blood all over the carpets like a ghoul?
In his normal black moods- such as a period, lasting sometimes for days, in which one of the finest minds in existence was utterly at the mercy of some painful paralysis I could not even begin to understand, could ever be called
Holmes had huddled into the corner of the sofa- a concession, I suppose, to his altogether natural desire to be as far from me and my needle as possible- but even so there was hardly enough room for both of us there.  I tested it, all the same- stretching out along the length of the sofa, my body softly against his, my face so near that I saw every quicksilver flash of his eyes and every quirk of his lip, bitter or sweet.  He tolerated this examination for longer than I would have expected, but eventually he said, “What are you looking at?”
For my part, I did not entirely believe my own argument.  If someone enjoyed the company of someone else, and felt a strong affection for that person, it was difficult to imagine that such feelings were easily dissolved- or easily elevated.  If she had not loved him on the boat, and only learned to later, it was because her peculiar and tragic circumstances had helped it to ‘grow’ in her, not because it was common to look on a dear friend and realize you had fallen irrevocably in love with them.
Holmes froze and hissed softly.  The hiss reminded me strongly of a goose, and it would have been amusing if the line of his back was not so painfully straight.  I felt I had unknowingly got to the crux of something, but because it was unknowing I felt no better informed than I had before I reached it at all.  “Goodnight, Watson,” he said gently.  He opened the door- the light beyond caught briefly on his hair- and then he was gone.
If the way he had been looking at me- the way he looked at me still- made it difficult to concentrate, that made it even worse.  It was a good thing long experience had rendered the stitching of a wound relatively second nature to me, for I might have botched things badly otherwise.  I loved every scar on his body from the times before me, as I loved every other hint of his work from the old days.  Proof both that he needed me and that, technically, he didn’t- but he seemed to want me- in some capacity, at least- all the same.  But I would not leave some ugly scar on him myself for anything.
Hopkins still had questions about the silver he had found just where Holmes said it would be.  It was Holmes who suggested that it had only ever been stolen as a blind.  Though he might take it upon himself to shield those whose guilt he had uncovered, to lie outright to a policeman- especially one so promising as Hopkins- was not something which came easily to him.  Together he and Hopkins came around to the idea that the objects might have only been hidden beneath the water temporarily.  The gang might have intended to return for the fruits of their labor once all was quiet again.  The inspector liked this idea so much that my friend would have had a difficult time working him back around to the concept of a blind- and the robbery as a cover for the death and nothing more- again if he wished to.  Since he did not wish to, Hopkins went cheerfully on his way and Holmes returned to his reading of the paper.
.  If he had misread my regard from early on, much as I myself once had, time could certainly have compounded the error.  Even he made assumptions sometimes and went astray because they were wrong.  But now... He steepled his fingers.  “You kissed me,” he said again.
Holmes was standing by the fireplace with a glass of brandy in his hand when I entered the sitting room.  His sleeve was torn off above the bicep, and there was blood all down his side.  His face was pale and his eyes were wide, but he still smiled as he said my name.
John ran to hIm quickly, utterly confused. When he saw the younger man on the couch, his throat gripped.
Sherlock thought he must have misheard. He blinked in confusion and his brows knitted together. Did John decline to go to the crime scene? Like the Army Doctor John Watson? It was his hobby too, wasn't it? Well, maybe not as big as Sherlock's, but...
" Don't give me this crap! Of course, you're not fine!" The soldier raised his voice into a scream, the frustration was taking control of him, all those mysteries and secrets were driving him INSANE! He just wanted to understand so he would be able to help him.
The tall, black-haired man watched him sadly, obeying the doctor's orders. His insides kept twisting with embarrassment under John's skilled touches and the urge to suck in his stomach gnawed in his head.
The red-faced policeman made his way towards Sherlock, who took a step back. " Shut up, you disgusting - !" He shouted in Sherlock's face, but they had no chance to find out what name Anderson wanted to call him. Because in that very time, the detective lost his control, clenched his right hand into a fist and punched him right in his nose.
" I-I didn't ta-take anything! I mu-must have co-collapsed..." Sherlock protested and closed his eyes from the sharp light.
Detective's thin shoulders shrugged again and he brought his large Belstaff coat closer to his body. " So what? I'll sleep in my coat..." He said, keeping the tone of his baritone neutral, but somehow it sounded like If he was daring John to say something.
He nodded slowly and John couldn't help but smile. Except for a sharper exchange of views it wasn't as bad as he expected it to be. After all, he managed to make Sherlock leave his room, eat a bit and stay with him the whole evening. That was a good start.
Detective's blue-green eyes blinked and quickly opened, a mixture of fear and pain in them. But when he saw John, there was a relief of relief in his face. "John," he whispered in a hoarse voice, resting his head onto the pillow with the flag of England. His breath was so rapid, he was panting like after running a marathon.
Sherlock was laying on his back, tangled in the blanket, fast asleep. His voluptuous body convulsed in the nightmare, the muscles on his arms and legs flexing and loosening uncontrollably...
The pain exploded in his stomach and must have shot into every nerve ending in his body, setting his insides aflame.
His figure seemed to be just a bit taller and less muscular and his hair were two shades lighter than John's sandy one, but the similarity between the two was undeniable.
" You look sad too..." John noted when he let his hands slip down from his face. " You're not being so silent usually... Of course, you're only a figment of my fantasy... But you're speaking with me every day..."
The soldier smirked, remembering their conversation at Angelo's when Sherlock asserted he was married to his Work. " Well, I thought that too... Actually, I'm not sure when I'm around you... "
In a shock and surprise, the detective turned around and both cups fell out of his hands, shattering on the kitchen tiles.
The dark green walls provided a nice, comfortable atmosphere in there, the light made you relax and calm to sleep well.
John was even more worried. " Why not? Please, tell me what's wrong..." Even this time Sherlock didn't reply. The doctor sighed heavily and ruffled his blonde hair. " Sherlock, it's about what I said earlier, isn't it? I'm so sorry for that, please forgive me if you can..."
" Very funny... Don't worry, I won't stay here for long, I probably wouldn't survive in your presence for longer than it's necessary. I'm here just because of John." The black-haired man replied coldly. He wasn't letting that pathetic excuse of policeman win.
The younger one brushed the bent man with a critical eye. " I hope you don't mean of yourself..." He scoffed, finding it very hard to resist to tease his older stoic brother.
Suddenly he stopped as if someone has pressed the 'pause' button. He had he spotted his reflection in the mirror...
But Sherlock wasn't proud of himself, he knew that he was acting like a coward, hiding from his best friend as if he was about to hurt him.
" It's all my fault! I'm so sorry, John! I've never meant to say what I've said! Your blog is awesome and I owe you so much ... no one would want my help it wasn't you... Only you keep me right... And I've ruined it, because I was so scared to show some emotions... I don't deserve you... Such a horrible, selfish freak doesn't belong to someone as you are!" Sherlock's raised voice was shaking and it broke on that awful word that John hated. He let out a painful sob and buried his head between John's neck and shoulder.
" How can you tell?" The young forensic, who's been sent with Sherlock to keep an eye on him - since Greg had some dull paperwork to do - asked sceptically.
It was him, without a doubt, Sherlock's scared eyes of a deer in headlights were looking at him from his scared face. From much softer and fuller face than John remembered, with round cheeks and little double chin.
Sherlock still laid on John's chest and enjoyed the warm which radiated from his body and gave the detective an impression of the safety. But twinges of conscience didn't allow him to relax.
A few minutes later he was back, with a glass of water, flask of ibuprofen and wet towel. He found his friend sitting on the bed in the same position he left him in, trembling from head to toes. His face was flushed and sweaty and the untidy nest of black curls stuck out of his head in all possible directions.
John grabbed Sherlock's beautiful cheekbones with his small palms, stroking them with his thumbs. " Sherlock, I'm so sorry for giving you that impression... I love you so much and nothing is going to change this. Of course, it hurt me very much and I was furious, but it doesn't mean that I'm leaving..."
" Just tell me, Brother Mine, you'll feel better," Mycroft told him and wrapped his arm around his shoulders.
" Thank you, Sherlock..." The doctor squeezed Sherlock's shoulders once more before he stood up and made his way to the door.
The food was very good, the couple shared a pizza and then they ordered coffee with ice-cream and whipped cream.
" No... But I'm sure he thinks it... After what I've done... I've done something horrible, Myc and I don't know how to fix it..." Sherlock was suddenly so vulnerable, he looked like he was on the edge of the breakdown.
With two small steps, John closed the distance between them and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's bulky middle, grasping him tightly and allowing the detective to lean on him.
She snapped, uncompromisingly pointed towards the door and her raised voice gave them no choice but do as she says - nobody wants to mess with their boss..."
The deep inhale of air told John what will follow. He has heard it so many times that it didn't even surprise him.
They were in the Oxfordshire, but not because of the case (to Sherlock's annoyance). The group of four men travelled there to entertain themselves a bit and enliven their holidays. John had to say that he really liked that part of England, so he suggested that they could spend there a weekend or so. The others agreed (even Sherlock, he grumbled about it just for appearance's sake - 'because he's a High-Functioning Sociopath...').
The hotel was decent, not filthy, but it still put Sherlock on edge.  He didn’t feel any sort of attraction to Mark or was it Mike?  He had deleted it already knowing he was merely a means to an end.  He would never see this man again.   If it had been up to Sherlock, a simple message saying “interested in casual sex only” with a place and a time to meet would have been perfect.  The chance to deduce if a person was, in fact, a serial killer or not, he supposed, was helpful though.
Knowing it would do him no good whatsoever to say ‘no’, afterall, Sherlock could just as easily grab his own urine sample if needed, John reached over and grabbed another cup.  “There are cleaning swipes in the loo.  Make sure to clean yourself thoroughly before beginning your stream.  Once you’ve started, stop your stream and then collect that urine in the cup.  Be sure not to touch the sides of the cup with your penis.”
“Don’t care.  Over here.  Now.”  Sherlock demanded.  “And don’t bother getting on the bed again until you are sufficiently naked.”
John opened his eyes in time to shout  “I’m so sorry, Mrs. Hudson” to her retreating form before he returned to Sherlock, closing and locking the door behind him.  “That was very rude, Sherlock.”
They both took some time to settle.  Neither knowing quite what to say, the anger, hurt and disappointment withering away being replaced with relief and peace.  Both sat in their chairs feeling humble.
I took a deep breath.  I nodded my head.  His thick head was right at my opening.  A straggled moan escaped me as the pressure increased.
John raised an eyebrow.  He would have thought Sherlock had read it somewhere at some point in his life, but he probably deleted it.  He shrugged and answered Sherlock’s question.  “The prostate is a gland located around a man’s urethra, it is prone to enlargement and possibly cancer, especially after the age of 40 which is when an annual manual manipulation exam is warranted.  The physician accesses it by inserting a finger inside of the rectum.”
“If you continue to talk to me as though you have suddenly become completely daft, I will punch you right in the face, Jonathan Hamish …”
John shuffled into their flat after a long day at the surgery.  He kissed his lover in the kitchen in greeting and put the kettle on, sighing wearily.
Sherlock took his shirt off first.  Enough time had passed that whatever marks were going to show up had already shown up.  He supposed they were already there during his shower, but he just couldn’t look then.  He had wanted to get the grime off and the thick smells off his skin.  Now that he was undressing and was anticipating that John would see him, he had to know what was there.  Had to see exactly what John would be seeing.  He saw the bruising around his wrists, the finger-shaped bruises in his arms.
“Jeezus, Sherlock!”  John scrambled to adjust his pants a bit to cover his cock then grabbed the gown and with snappy movements of finality, he definitely put the gown right on.
I was amazed that it didn’t hurt when he moved forward.  Hmmm…felt really good actually.  My cock was harder than it’s ever been.  I could hammer nails with the monster.  His cock was continually twitching inside me.  It felt nothing short of amazing.  His warmth surrounded me, goes through me.  His voice lulled me into that same warmth.  If felt like someone was playing a sweet, angelic,  three-dimensional song and it was engulfing me, filling every sense—smell, touch, hear, see, taste—god it was all around me.
“Of course not.  I’m going to do examine your … parts more closely.  Just stay where you are.”  John sat back down, bringing all the necessary “parts” into direct line of sight.   He felt the weight and girth of Sherlock’s penis more fully in his hand.
John sat on the edge of Sherlock’s bed and began taking his pulse at his wrist.  “Good.  D’ya remember what it was about?”
"Ow, shit!" Sherlock went to grab at the source of pain in his thigh and then remembered what he had said yesterday in A&E. He face-palmed and shook his head. "They gave me morphine."
John was startled by that realization.  Sherlock was right.  This was defensive wound and just as easily, if Sherlock didn’t have quick enough reflexes and blocked the forward motion of the knife with his own hand, it very well could have gone through the man’s heart or a major artery.  John shook his head and pinched at the bridge of his nose.  “God, you just don’t get it do you.  I mean you really are clueless.”
John ran his tongue from arse crack, down across the space between entrance and bollocks and drew slow circles there with his tongue.  He knew Sherlock was getting close again.  His cock was very thick and nearly purple.  John continued his journey licking across Sherlock’s bollocks and down the length of his cock.  He heard a distinctly deep baritone moan and knew the man was riding precariously on the edge of orgasm.  John flattened his tongue and gave the sensitive tip of Sherlock’s cock one long, teasing lick and sat up again.
.. thus far.  He had never had an opportunity to touch another man’s nude form.  The men in Serbia most certainly did not take any time to undress, there was no fondling or admiring, of course.
Sherlock harrumphed and glared at Lestrade and then John in turn before stalking back toward the body lying in a bloody pool on the concrete.  He mumbled something about seeing and not observing as he went, Greg and John in tow.  Once he ordered Anderson away from the corpse, he began leading them on the correct path.
Sherlock noticed tears welling in John’s eyes while he tried to maintain stoicism.  The knowledge visibly tore John apart and Sherlock was laying witness to this.  “John, I’m sorry … I …”
Easily coming back to the purpose, John firmly grasped the impressive organ before him and pulled back revealing the glans and the urethral opening. Sherlock gasped quietly and John noted him squeezing his eyes closed.  Quickly and with practiced ease, John inserted the syringe and slowly pushed the plunger, pulling up and out as the fluid filled the space.
Sherlock nodded and looked at his shoes.  “I’d rather do this sooner and get back to Baker Street.”  Sherlock looked up and took in John’s posture, stiff, guarded and he very decidedly positioned himself between Sherlock and Mycroft.  Sherlock could see that John had a definite urge for physical contact, probably in the form of a hug, but kept himself deliberately at length possibly due to a perception that Sherlock might not want physical contact from anyone at the moment but also that John would not initiate physical contact between himself and Sherlock in front of Mycroft at this time because Mycroft would consider it a weakness and he knew the last thing Sherlock needed was to feel weakened in front of his brother.  A hug from John did sound nice though.  Of course, John might also be projecting a need for physical contact in the form of a punch to Mycroft’s buttinski face.  Sometimes he was hard to read.
“That’s a gorgeous sound.  I want that sound in our bed all the time.”  John continued to kiss Sherlock and Sherlock pulled his hips up desperately wanting more contact.  “I’m going to get the lube.”
“I don’t need … help.”  He said the last word like it was disdainful.  “I told you because Mycroft was making my life miserable.  I told you because he insisted on it.”  Walls, walls, build the walls.
He’s moved away from me quickly, we made it out to the street.  He’s attempting to hail a cab.  He won’t get one in this neighborhood at this time of night.  He walked down the street, his steps to quick, his demeanor to stiff to believe he was anything less than completely pissed off at me.  Nevertheless, I walked with him.
“Oh, please.  You’ve been with me for almost an hour.  She knows I’m here and that you’re done for the day.  Get your coat and take me home.”
“I put on another pair of gloves and re-examined him.  He thanked me for being so careful with him.  As I was prodding against the gland, paying particular attention to the borders of it and the consistency, he starts moaning … moaning like he’s near orgasm.”
Sherlock shrugged once more and burrowed into his pillow, apparently ready for sleep.  John shook his head and made his exit.
I knew there would be a fair amount of explaining I would have to do.  I suppose I hadn’t really thought too far ahead of stopping him from allowing a perfect stranger to take him to bed, possibly treat him badly.  I may not have the most experience sexually but I have … researched.  The “in” gay crowd is not what you might call, gentle or even mildly understanding.  We’ve all heard mention of unspeakable things that might happen.    “Look, John, I know why you came here.”
Instantly he decided his next course of action.  This could not be encouraged.  As much as it pained Sherlock, this was not good.  He sighed and put on his most confused face like he didn’t understand the statement or silly things like human emotion.  He’d done that for years.  It was not difficult to muster.
John would be bringing him tea any moment and explain in more detail why he should see a therapist and why he should be “talking to someone” and blah blah blah, on it went every day ad nauseum.
“You’re oversensitive at the moment.  It’ll pass.” John finished cleaning Sherlock’s stomach and tossed the flannel to the floor.  “Let’s get up in this bed properly shall we?”  John pulled at the duvet and slapped Sherlock’s buttock a bit when he lethargically crawled his way up onto the bed with a huff.  They settled with Sherlock tucked under John’s arm, his face on John’s chest.
“Not since 2005.  Up.  Now.” He had already checked with Mycroft on that fact and had the vial in the refrigerator waiting for an incident like this to happen.  Given the lifestyle Sherlock lead, it was bound to happen.
John laughed and settled himself lying flat on his stomach between Sherlock’s legs.  “Hold yourself open for me,” John instructed as he pushed Sherlock’s legs from behind his knees up toward his chest.  Sherlock hooked his legs over his own arms and pulled upward.  “There you go.  Fucking beautiful,” he muttered before engulfing Sherlock’s cock with his mouth and sucking on every upstroke and laving the tip of Sherlock’s cock with his tongue on every down stroke.  He was aware Sherlock had yelped and started writhing with much more enthusiasm but his hips remained on the bed which John was grateful for because his hands were busy seeking that special spot once more that he knew would send Sherlock to the moon and back.
“Here it is then,” he turned toward Mycroft who had been silent since being told off by John. “Where is the exam room and do I have a kit to work with?”
Finally it is done!!  Good Lord that took me forever and way too many days of ignoring family, living off of Doritos and grilled cheese and putting off the housework to do it.  I would appreciate a comment or two.  It really is the only thing that makes sharing my work worthwhile.  It is encouraging.  At least hit the kudos button if you like it.  Thanks and thank you for those who already have left comments and supported my writing even if I am incredibly slow at producing a final product.  You're the reason I keep writing.  Well, that and it is so fun!  Okay, you're the reason I share it.  :)
He felt John wiggle underneath him to disengage his cock from John’s body then he was being pushed to one side.  He wasn’t sure he felt his limbs or could make them work anymore so thank God John was strong enough to move him.
“Berk,” John said fondly and kissed Sherlock’s lips softly before pulling himself up.  “Stay right there.  I’ll be right back.”  John padded his way naked to the bathroom through the adjoining door.  He cleaned himself off then rinsed the flannel and walked back to Sherlock.
Sherlock didn’t bother breaking the kiss long enough to form words.  A sound vaguely resembling “uh huh” escaped as Sherlock pushed his fingers through John’s hair and rocked into his lap, grinding against him as his bum was pushed and pulled by the firm grip of John’s hands.
“Boys, I was just …” Mrs. Hudson waltzed through the front door of their flat and stopped dead in her tracks at the sight before her.  “OH!  Oh my!  I’ll just …” She was down the stairs faster than they could tell her otherwise.
“Yes.”  I push up, his cock still inside me, impaling me deeply.  He moaned and quickly placed the pillow.  His dick pops out of my ass as I lurch forward.  Damn!
John was already on his way to meet Sherlock at the crime scene when he received a call from Lastrade. The semi-panicked voice made him anxious to get there sooner and he told the cabbie in a very curt voice to "step on it." When he arrived he heard Sherlock yelling "For God's sake" and "idiot" a lot. He was apparently conscious so that was good. The gathered crowd of Yarders parted to allow John through.
“Sorry, mate.  I just had my own nightmare myself so I was already up when I heard you screaming.  You wouldn’t wake up when I called out to you and I’m so dead fucking tired I wasn’t sure I cared if you socked me a good one.”
“First thing is first.  Your labs came back today.  Your blood culture is fine, your hormone levels are fine except you do have an elevated PSA, but it’s only very slightly elevated.   I do think this short course of antibiotics will make you feel better.  We’ll repeat the lab in a couple of weeks.  If it’s fine, no worries.  It’s over.  If not, we’ll figure out our next step.”
"We're going to go ahead and remove the neck brace and roll you off of the back board and then I'llgive you a good once over and stitch you up. Sound okay?" The doctor asked.
“God, Sherlock, I could have helped … jeezus I, I don’t know.  I could have … I would have stopped pushing it on you.”
“No, you’re not.  I’m not either,” John looked away, feeling slightly uncomfortable.  “I’ve had loads of sex with woman, all completely unsatisfying … or only satisfying for the moment anyway.  I’ve had sex with men where the only point of contact between us was hard prick into arsehole.  No touching, no kissing, just a quick fuck and move on.”  John looked at Sherlock once more, his eyes searching.  “None of them were even half as fulfilling as having you in my bed,” John kissed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, “kissing me, rubbing your hands on me, connecting with me … me, as in ‘not just a warm body’ kind of way, but touching me as if … as if it’s really ME you want there beside you,” he kissed Sherlock’s jaw and then made his way down to his collar bone, “making me feel like I shouldn’t be anywhere else in the world.”
Sherlock gasped and grabbed hold of the garment, keeping it in place.  He turned back around assessing John’s gaze.
“Well, upon fear of death to anyone else who touches me, but I suppose that’s probably as sappy as you get, right?”
“Can we just go home?”  He knew it was a long shot, but he suddenly felt very tired and ready for familiar surroundings.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond but quickly shut it again and smiled as John answered for him.  “Doesn’t speak a lick of English, I’m afraid.”  John interjected before Sherlock had a chance to answer.
“I’ve been poisoned.  You have to make it stop!  Now!”  With that, Sherlock dropped both trousers and pants and bent quickly over the side of the exam table exposing a frighteningly alarming looking rash to both cheeks.
Sherlock swept into the room and noticed John’s look of wonder at the open door.  He was staring.  Sherlock wondered why he hadn’t invited the man in yet and what was so astonishing that he had forgotten all manners so he moved forward to get a view of the visitor.
John looked up to see Sherlock’s eyes watching him as he increased the pressure and began to suck the man’s cock.  John pulled off with a plop, maintaining eye contact just long enough to ask, “you like to watch me suck your cock?”
“Wrong!  He was shot.  The bullet did not exit his body but you won’t find it during an autopsy of his body.  You’ll find it during an autopsy of that body,” Sherlock said pointing to a spot a few feet away from the corpse lying on the ground in the dirty alleyway.
“Okay.”  John stood up and tossed the nearby examination gown onto the table.  “I’m gonna step out.  Change into that and knock on the door when you’re ready.  I’ll give you several seconds to have a seat on the exam table when I hear you knock.”
He was working my ass with one finger, his tongue back on my cock and I love life right now, taking me all in.  I was helplessly oblivious when he removed his finger, coated them with lube and replaced his one finger with two fingers.  I hissed.  “Oh my god!”
I didn’t immediately see him as I entered our shared flat.  I looked into the kitchen.  Maybe he needed some tea to calm his nerves a bit.  Good idea.  He was not there either.  Probably in the bathroom then.  Best to give him time to settle himself.  He would come back when he was ready to talk.  I moved to my bedroom intending to change into my night clothes.  John was in my room.  On my bed.  Naked.
"Yes, John is just my flatmate and my doctor. Not my boyfriend. Don't confuse him with my boyfriend at all," Sherlock slurred. "We should probably have that announced overhead, just to be on the safe side."
Finally, John heard the shower turn off.  He thought he would give him some time to get dressed, put his ‘armor’ on.  It would probably make Sherlock much more comfortable to have clothes on for this conversation.  He waited for his friend to come out.  When several minutes went by, John walked down the hall and knocked.
John laid his head back against Sherlock’s shoulder as he felt his body let go, his arse so completely filled,  once more spilling his come all over Sherlock’s hand, not to mention the headboard, the bed and he may have even spurted some up onto his own shoulder and belly.
“As a matter of fact,” John continued. “You don’t let anyone touch you, save for Mrs. Hudson, except for me.”
A sudden gasp from Sherlock and John knew Sherlock was coming.  John continued rubbing his thumbs in those slow circles and sucking on Sherlock’s cock.  Even when he felt the ejection of fluid into the back of his mouth, John kept sucking.  And Sherlock kept coming and coming.  John looked up to see a stunned Sherlock, his torso stiff in surprise.  It looked like he had actually stopped breathing like he was riding a wave of pleasure that just kept on peaking and peaking and peaking.  John kept Sherlock’s cock in his mouth as pulse after pulse of fluid emptied against his tongue.  John tried to swallow as it came but he allowed some of it to leak out of his mouth.  Finally Sherlock took in a sharp gasp and collapsed arching his back and attempting to pull away from John.
Finally able to return to his own body and his current reality, Sherlock took a few steps away from the wall.  Shocked he hadn’t woke John up, he stared down a moment at his friend.  His beautiful John.  Turning away and admonishing himself for being so creepy in the dark, Sherlock moved toward his side of the bed again. He wanted to pace, but he really was tired and so weary.  He needed a cigarette.  Or some heroin.  He shook his head.  Not going down that road again.  Shezza had made his appearance when John was busy being a devoted husband and soon-to-be father. The Magnussen case had provided a distraction but the heroin was a bigger one.  The pain and misery of withdrawal was not something he wanted to relive any time soon and John, he knew, would leave him.
“Lots of people die of anaphylaxis, John.  The upper airway is completely constricted due to swelling.  I just wanted to see what a healthy one looked like.”
Sherlock thought a moment, clearly taking inventory of his body systems.  “Yes, thank you.”  He adjusted the pillow under his head but made no attempt to get up.
Ignoring the birthday comment, Sherlock continued, “hmmm… Mrs. Slitheen is a widow.  Her son is a drug addict but has been sober for nearly six years.  His inheritance would be affected if he were to relapse, but he does have gambling issues.  The daughter has nothing to gain by stealing the broach.  She married into a family of status and wealth herself.  What about the staff?”
He smiled.  “The lube and condoms are back on my bed.  We should probably take this into the next room.”
Sherlock instinctively pushed back searching for more.  “John … John, please … need more,” Sherlock begged.
John nodded his head.  “Well it sounds like textbook case of prostatitis.  I’m going to schedule you for a cystoscopy and prostate exam tomorrow.  Dr Halliard is a colleague of mine at the …”
John breathed next to him.  Sherlock contemplated John and moved closer.  He turned on his side and moved close enough to smell his flatmate right there at his shoulder.  John was warm and clean and felt like a balm to apply directly to Sherlock’s mind to soothe the rawness.  He closed his eyes and moved an arm around John’s midsection, feeling the soft cotton of his undershirt, the waistband of his boxers.  John was no longer snoring but didn’t move away.  Sherlock buried his nose into the warmth of John’s neck and breathed in deeply.  So clean, so warm and familiar and so like home. Like John.  The warmth continued to bloom throughout his body.  John’s touch didn’t make him recoil, his presence didn’t make him want to grit his teeth unlike so many others in Sherlock’s life.   “John.”  Sherlock pulled a leg up over John’s thighs.  John ran his hand up Sherlock’s arm and squeezed his bicep in encouragement.
Sherlock waited for his friend to speak, be outraged and demand retribution, bargain for this to have not happened to his ‘best mate’ and ask more details about the circumstances leading up to the assault and then finally approach him and talk to him like an infant in distress.  He could see it all playing out in his head like he had seen it so many other times with so many other people.  John did none of that.
Several days and two more victims later, Sherlock had finally found the culprit and helped apprehend the man and put him behind bars with solid evidence backing up the case.  Finally, they were in a cab on the way back to Baker Street.
“It is NOT nothing!”  Lestrade interjected.  “He’s been stabbed,” he said with alarm evident in his voice.
“I’m not laughing.  Your body has been invaded by an instrument from someone meant to cause you harm.  I don’t find that humorous.  Lift up,” John instructed, bringing his patient’s trousers and pants down in one go.  He turned to Lestrade, “Grab me some tea towels in the drawer in the kitchen next to the fridge and my medical kit in the cabinet below.
Sherlock sat back up on the table.  “Mrs. Slitheen is 87 years-old.  She does not have a personal trainer.”
“We agreed, Lestrade!  I am not at your beck and call.  This barely rates a four.”  Sherlock spun on his heels and started walking toward the mouth of the alleyway where the crowd had started to gather.
John laughed.  “You’re welcome,” he moved toward the door.  “Get dressed.  You’re fine.  Let’s go home.”
Sherlock stood, the anger boiling at John’s weak comparison.  “John you were a soldier and a hero.  You took a bullet for God and Country with a scar to prove it!  I have a story about how I was brutally raped, beaten and tortured with an entire backside full of scars to prove it, that’s what I have.  It’s kind of a show stopper, John.  Nobody wants to know about that story.  Nobody cares that the minimally famous Sherlock Holmes went to Serbia to take down a criminal mastermind and ended up being a party favor at a 5 month long party.  You have a well-honored metal, you saved your entire platoon and countless other lives.  We might share the same diagnosis but we are not alike.  Do not … “  he visibly deflated.  “Do not compare our situations.  We are nothing alike.”
“You’re so beautiful.”  Sherlock breathed, lips never leaving John’s skin.  He moved lower until he was on his knees in front of John.  He spared a look upwards and liked that John had his arms over his head still as though Sherlock had chained them there.  “Beautiful.”  He beamed as he took John’s belt in his hands and began to undo the fly.
If Mycroft hadn’t butted in with his big head and big nose, Sherlock would have taken the tube to a remote clinic, had his injury dealt with swiftly and he would have been back at Baker Street by now.  Nobody the wiser.  Again, Sherlock grew angrier at the thought of Mycroft and his meddling into his life.  He’s always done that, since he was a child.
"He didn't deliver the medication. Anthea injected it. Mycroft ordered her to do it. Obviously." He dug a piece of paper that looked an awful lot like a vaccination record out of his pocket and handed it over to John.
“Sherlock?”  John was stunned on the look of pure adoration in Sherlock’s eyes.  He seemed like, well John didn’t know what he actually seemed like, but Sherlock didn’t do emotions.  Maybe a bit of frustration, possibly fury with the world at large for not providing him with a locked-room murder at least once a week, but this was something different he hadn’t ever seen in the man.
“I mean the game is over.  Bully for you.”  He tossed a few bills over the seat at the driver as we pulled up to 221B.
I then shift concentration, noticing a tall, ginger man to my left notice him.  He had a smirk plastered to his face, an obvious predator.  I moved closer.  John’s back was to me.  John will be pissed that I followed him here, but I also did not want to leave the bait out there for the sharks to eat.  I took in his appearance once more.  His shirt off.  His skin flushed.  He’s hot and sweaty. He’s practically chum to the sharks within the room.  He’s definitely looking for something, I know it isn’t me, but all the same, I can’t leave him here.  Well this is going to shock the hell out of him.  The predator is making his move. I make mine faster and give him a ‘so sorry’ smile.
“No.”  Sherlock was still a bit taken aback from John’s diatribe toward his brother.  John never ceased to surprise Sherlock, but after feeling a bit rustled around by Mycroft, he thought John was bloody brilliant and felt himself feel more solidified in their friendship if that was even possible, and it was still a bit jostling.  “No.  As you know, I didn’t want you to know at all, but now that you do…” Sherlock, understanding how that sounded, looked regretful for blurting out that statement and tried to explain.  “Not that I don’t trust you, John, I … “
Sherlock dragged himself up a bit, leaning his torso against the arm of the sofa.  “You like to take care of me.”
John audibly gasped.  “Jeezus fucking … Oh my God!”  John sat forward in his chair resting his elbows on his knees.  He rubbed his eyes having not been able to stop the few tears from flowing before he regained his composure, sniffed a few times and sat up.  “So, you were tortured?”
His clothes were battered and torn and stunk of must and sex and sweat.  Suddenly the familiar walls of the Serbian prison were gone but the all too familiar faces of his captors were very present.  Dense forest open to him on three sides and his abusers on one.  They leered at him as though they wanted to devour him like they had done so many time before.  The disgusting things spewing from their mouths made Sherlock want to vomit.  He knew what they would do to him once they reached him and the thought of it made his stomach flip once more.  But he wasn’t in a small, brick-lined cell.  There was forest all around him.  He could run this time.  He could escape.  His captors took steps toward him, their mouths drooling and their faces turning to gruesome, zombie-like creatures.  Panic seized him.  They were coming closer and closer but Sherlock couldn’t move.  He took in a gulp of air and forced his body to move but nothing happened.  His arms felt like lead, they were so heavy.  The effort it took to start a stride was enormous, like he was running through molasses yet the creatures were getting closer and not hindered in any way.  He redoubled his efforts, he had to move, had to get away.  Go! He told himself.  RUN damn it!!  A knee was finally raised enough to be able to create enough power to push against the ground and finally propel him forward but the creatures were nearly upon him.  Push harder!!  You have to do better!! You have to go … NOW!!  No matter how hard he tried, his body would not obey.  Helpless …. He felt absolutely helpless and the panic seized him as he attempted to guard himself against the zombies in Serbian prison guard uniforms engulf him, dragging him down into oblivion.
Sherlock sat for a few seconds taking in his surroundings and assessing his own state of wellness.  By the light through the window he knew it had gone past ten.  He wondered for a moment why his brother hadn’t been in his hotel room by six then, but dismissed the thought.  Obviously he had to deal with more internationally pressing issues before his people apprised him of his baby brother’s whereabouts.
I catch a glipse of us in the long mirror secured to his door angled just right that I can see us in it from across the room.  I don’t think I’ve ever looked so thoroughly open and debautched.  The look of him … eyes so hooded in pleasure even though I’ve been trying his patience.  The look of us, moving together.  Ah … god, so intense.  So fantastically intense.  Any doubt I might have was drown out by complete and utter desire to have him.  For him to have me.
“Yes, John.”  He picked up the packaging and took out the bulky manual, opening it wearily.  “The Pro-State Massager”  he gave a grin at John.  “Very well-thought out name, I should think.”
He recognized he had barely prepared the man enough to take his cock before he was pushing inside of his friend.  He admonished himself for that and continued to feel guilty, but there was an all-consuming need that just kept pushing forward forward forward, before it was too late.  Keep going before it all disappeared.
“Sherlock?”  John  hustled over to tell Lestrade he and Sherlock would meet him at NSY in a couple of hours as he watched Sherlock  walk toward the gathered crowd.  He heard Lestrade ordering someone to “bag the rat!” as he jogged to get to his friend.
John huffed in indignation.   “Seriously?  You probably know about three people in pop culture and Vin Diesel is one of them?”
“I know.” I know he was trying to be gentle but making me feel like a blushing virgin was making me crazy.
Realizing he’d only gotten as far as taking off his button-down shirt in the last several minutes, Sherlock decided to stop thinking about Mycroft and about Milo/Mario as well.  He would file what he needed to file later. John would start thinking Sherlock had changed his mind after all if he took any more time.
John just about jumped through his skin when he noticed Sherlock sitting on the floor under the big window near the desk.
Sherlock got himself back under control and moved more gracefully to a standing position, pushing John to stand as well.  “As I said, I’m fine.  I apologize if I woke you.  Won’t happen again, I assure you.”
“Of course, a rat,” Sherlock continued.  “The rat climbed into the wound, dilating the wound more as it entered.  It ate the bullet and then climbed back out, dilating the wound a bit more and also turning the victims clothing fibers at the entry point, outward leading you to assume erroneously that it was an exit wound.  It stumbled a meter away where it died of asphyxiation.  A 9mm bullet is not very palatable for a rodent’s diet I’m afraid.  Didn’t do much for his breathing either,” he said nodding toward the deceased.
John looked at Sherlock taking in the concern on his face.  “Yeah, yeah.  I’m fine.  A bit sore, but that’s expected.  Come here.”
John lay half on his side and half on top of Sherlock, stroking and kissing, watching the man writhe beneath him.  Soon the moans and groans and muscle twitches got to John and he was desperate for his own contact.  He put some lubricant on his own cock and then pushed himself up to lay directly on top of Sherlock.  He pushed his legs between Sherlock’s and swept his legs up and to the sides as he brought his own knees up onto the bed once more.
“Sherlock, you don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.  I’m just trying to get to know you.”
“Well then you were damn lucky because none of this damage has been caused by a sawback blade being removed from the wound, meaning …”
" Oh, Sherlock..." John gave him a big smile with familiar dimples. He knew exactly what Sherlock was saying. He didn't want to badger him.
He has almost released another groan when something warm and wet caressed his mouth, and encircled the whole edge of his cupid-shaped lips, leaving the damp trace which threatened them, causing them to swell a bit as the blood rushed inside them.
Sherlock gasped and his instincts were screaming at him to pull away. But he didn't want to. He would never say that out loud, but he craved for some positive physical contact after such a long time of being tortured and lonely.
The door cracked silently as they slowly opened. Tall thin figure silently crept up through John's room, heading to the bed.
It was a funny sight on him - the sweater was too short yet too baggy for his long, too skinny body for John's liking. But after all, it was no surprise that the jumper was hanged on him, after all, John was short but well-built, with muscular arms and chest. His belly may be a bit flabbier than it used to be, but it happens to the retired soldiers and he has been in much better condition than some young people...
A sob found a way out of Sherlock's throat and suddenly he couldn't stop the wave of emotion which he tried to suppress for too long.
Nothing was coming out of him now, but his throat and stomach continued to abuse him as it thought there was still something to get rid of. He just remained in that position, just in case...
" That was... unexpected..." Sherlock commented with raised eyebrows as soon as forensics left the room. Did someone drug her coffee? He was innocent this time...
The detective clenched his jaw and daringly looked him in the eyes. If they had thought that he will break down from their comments, then they were utterly wrong.
" Sherlock, talk to me, please..." The ex-soldier put his hand on his shoulder, but Sherlock pressed his lips into the thin line.
The raven-haired genius opened his mouth to say that the pleasure was just one-sided, but before he managed to say a word, something hard smashed his head and he fell into a darkness of unconsciousness.
" No, it's not! Could you just let me examine you? I just want to make sure that you're not injured..."
Together they headed through the corridor leading to Sherlock's room. With some effort, John took the handle and opened the door, kicking them open to let themselves in.
The doctor looked up at his friend with a strange face, unknowing what to think. What was Sherlock about to do? Slowly he uncurled from the safe ball and rolled on his back just like the detective told him to.
Sherlock smiled at him and opened his mouth to say something to tease him a bit. But he realised that his horrible stuttering would ruin that beautiful moment. He pressed his lips together.
John was shocked. But he wasn't sure if which shocked him more - whether Sherlock fell into the freezing water and could be injured or the fact that the Consulting Detective was so inattentive. Sherlock always knew what was going on and especially during the case... " Are you hurt? Should I examine you?" He asked a bit loudly, almost shouting with concern.
Sherlock raised his head in shock when he heard his name. He looked at the man on the doorstep. John Watson used to be vital, strong and full of happiness and sassy humour. He was short, but well-built, with a softer tummy but firm muscles on his arms and legs.
" Why would I needs friends anyway?" He snapped, annoyed with himself for being so sentimental - the sentiment was the last thing he needed, after all, it was the cause of this mess in the first place...
" Hey, don't Jawn me, you know it's not working on me... Yesterday you crawled into the flat on all fours, just in case you've already forgotten about that..." He remarked ironically.
" But... that's understandable, you'd be a fool if you wouldn't be frightened... It's so... pathetic to be... scared of the thunderstorm..." His voice faded into the whisper.
But in the aspect of the appearance, he could not care less. For him, he was the same handsome and intelligent man he was about two years ago, the man for whom he has killed, the man for whom he has cancelled his dates, the man with whom he lived instead of his girlfriend!
The British Government took a deep breath. " He's not completely fine, he had been through a lot, but he's getting better now..."
" Myc, be good!" Greg admonished his boyfriend, pointed out that the way he provoked his brother was bit-not-good. He put his hand on his shoulder and gave it a light squeeze to warn him.
" It can go to Hell then!" Sherlock exclaimed suddenly and startled John and even himself. He has just devoured the whole serving, how could he still feel hungry?!
" The storm... came down... I... I wasn't paying attention... He pushed me... down into the pond..." Sherlock managed to say, but his voice stammered because of the treacherous panting coming from his rib cage. His throat felt tight and sore, every swallow irritated his larynx.
Sherlock was mute for a long time and then he blurted out. " It wasn't on purpose! I never meant to damage your beloved beautiful jumper!"
His nose wrinkled in discontent with himself when he looked at the doughy, stretch-marked side covered by blue bruises, and he better pressed the package of frozen peas against his hip.
" When I was six, I and my family went to the countryside. I went with Mycroft for a walk to the forest. We clowned around and played children's games... Don't give me this look, we were just like normal children..." He noted when John raised his eyebrow as if he wanted to say 'Really?'
" Enough, Sherlock! Look, I'm really not in the mood today. You can't go out like this, do you understand?!"
No wonder his lean body kept trembling - John realised that the man in front of him was soaking wet.
" I'll make some hot tea, that will warm him up..." Offered Mrs Hudson while watching the duo with a concerned face.
He took the hem of the big t-shirt he borrowed to his little brother (after all, he was always little bigger than Sherlock--which his cheeky baby brother loved to point out... ) and pulled it over his curly head.
John gasped for the air, eyes widen in a horror. Sherlock's back was a mess! There wasn't even one little spot left uninjured!
Sherlock rose up from the ground and turned around to face the bearded policeman, with an expression of absolute indifference. Anderson wasn't worth it...
The detective wouldn't mind even if it hurt, because it was John who was kissing him. This was the first kiss he had ever gotten and it was perfect, much better than he had thought. He couldn't imagine anybody else he would give a right to touch his lips, but the small army doctor was allowed to.
Suddenly Sherlock made a deep, a throaty sound and arched in his back as if someone grabbed him around his waist and lifted him upwards. His curly head sank even deeper in the pillow and a loud cry escaped his lips, along with tears that welled up from his closed eyes.
He felt exhausted as if he got knocked down by the train, his stomach hurt and his body became dehydrated as he lost a lot of fluids from his body because of vomiting and sweating.
John gritted his jaw tightly and did his best to not grate his teeth. He was even more annoying and rude than ever. But after all, it was Sherlock Holmes - unpredictable arsehole... He reminded him of the spoiled kid, who are demanding for attention - but only because someone else was talking to him. He suggested that if he sat at home, Sherlock wouldn't even register he's in the flat.
" John shouted and gave his chubby cheek a little slap to wake him up and save him from the horrible dream.
His long-standing motto started to lose its effectiveness. The seclusion of the room protected him, but at the same time deepened the feeling of loneliness, inferiority and misery and the longer alone he was, the more lost he felt.
The detective closed his eyes, his long lashes brushed against his high cheekbones. " It doesn't look nice..." He warned him and with a heavy heart, he exhaled and unbend his muscles, letting his tummy puff out. He winced when his skin jiggled, feeling a pure repulsion towards himself.
John's hairs stood on end at that noise, it was so unexpected and wrong - for Sherlock... He bent down over his friend slowly and cupped the pale face in his small palms to calm down the sobbing detective. " Sherlock... What is it? Why are you crying?"
How surprised they were when they spotted him, sitting on the pavement in the cold weather of January for God knows how long, in dirty, ripped clothes, with a thick rope around his soft arms and flabby ballooning tummy!
" Hello, Anderson. You're a bit late, don't you think?" He said in the most sarcastic voice he was able to produce.
He could understand that Mary was angry with him, how couldn't she when the detective suddenly appeared in the Landmark London restaurant on the Marylebone and ruined their engagement?
Well, as it seemed, Mary saw it in a different way... But beating him up? That was very cruel revenge.
John stared at him in the disbelief. He has never seen his best friend so vulnerable and terrified, Sherlock has always been emotion-free, every time above the others, dull morons...
" Take things slowly? And how the hell am I supposed to do that? My body betrays me! I feel like a complete stranger to myself! But why am I saying this to you? I have to go now..." Sherlock stood up abruptly and turned his back on John.
A sly smile curled John's lips. " Well... Dark, curly hair... Pale skin... Piercing blue-green eyes which would change their colour depending on the light... Huge intellect... Tending to insult people..." John paused for a while and took a glance down at the man who tensed on his chest as he began to recognise some features of himself. And it hurt, knowing that John won't love him the way he does only because he's a man.
" I'm not coming today, Sherlock... Go by yourself..." He said, sounding exhausted and bit out of breath.
John came out of the bathroom, his blonde hair wet from the cold shower. He wore his sleeping shorts and a white t-shirt, which Sherlock prepared for him.
The doctor rolled his eyes and resisted an urge to add 'obviously'. " Deleted the fact that we will sleep in a thin tent in 15 degrees? The nights here are quite cold, you know..." He wasn't sure what to think. He knew very well that Sherlock kept deleting useless things (like a Solar system), but this was something else, it was for his comfort and health.
John's nostrils widened with a rage, he looked like a lion in the cage. " SHERLOCK, I'm really not in the mood for your stupid puns!"
Sally has always despised him and his weight was offering a great opportunity for her to humiliate him, why didn't she use it?
" Let me guess... Mycroft sent you..." Sherlock said in a tight and calculating voice when he came out of the bathroom, finally fully and properly clothed.
The doctor immediately understood what was the detective doing there, when he hid in there. No wonder he was moody and tired all the time, it seemed that his attempts to workout didn't work as Sherlock imagined.
When the bolt lightened the interior in the restaurant, he realised how beautiful she was. Dark ginger hair fell down from her head on her fell silent and smiled at each other.
Although their lips separated, they rested in the close position, snuggling to each other. Their limbs were tangled, you would have a problem to recognise where does the body of the first began and where it ended.
John's eyes widen, he looked so hurt. " WHAT? Why are you meddling with that! Those pathetic stories, as you're saying, are living you, you utter idiot! You'd be in the gutter!" He yelled at him.
Sherlock's breathing rapidly changed into gasps for air, a feeling of being strangled wrapped around his neck and he was dangerously close to the hyperventilation.
Sherlock bent next to him and pressed his fingertips together under his prominent chin, connecting both brain hemispheres helped him to think. It could be just something John has eaten, he wondered.
John shook his head and the laugh bubbled through his lips. He took the hem of the foiled jumper and lifted it to drape it over Sherlock's head and he snuggled him closer as he covered both of them in the jumper. " Shush! I don't want you to change, you silly..." He leaned his forehead against his, lowering his voice into a half whisper. "I love you just the way you are, Sherlock, your beautiful eyes which will never stop fascinating me, your soft curly hair... I love your bloody experiments, human parts in the fridge, your amazing deductions, even your insults because I know you don't mean them... "
The new chapter is here, so I hope you like it! Your comments are absolutely amazing thank you so much for your support <3!
It wasn't, he was back in Baker Street, at home, in his bedroom with familiar green walls and a periodic table of contents, surrounded by his stuff, alive!
John took the glance at the closed home page on his phone and gritted his teeth. That git decided to spam his phone... He won't respond, that's it...
Dashing to the desk, he opened John's laptop and typed his password (the doctor has finally given up his attempts to find a password Sherlock wouldn't solve).
Sherlock accepted it gratefully and blew his nose. " Thank you, Greg... I'll make some tea... " He said and headed to the kitchen to put the kettle on.
John watched a struggling detective for a while and then he took the pity on him and decided to help him. He bent down in front of his friend and with certain strong hands, he began to undo the black buttons.
" Oh, so you finally found out how to speak again?" He said cheerfully, it felt so good to see him again.
After two months of being exposed to the physical and psychological torture, embarrassment and loneliness he has been left on the street, attached to the pillar right in front of the Scotland Yard.
And he never forgot to point out that Mycroft had gained weight - the teasing about his diets was a daily occurrence...
And he did. Mycroft looked up from the peg he was knocking on the ground. " Are you jealous, brother dear?" He returned a mocking smile to his cheeky sibling and continued to hammer the peg with a stone.
" And what about your hair?" John asked, grasping at straws. " I won't pry anymore, I promise... Just, remember that if you need to talk to someone, I'll be there for you..."
John frowned and laid his chin on the top of Sherlock's head. " I was really angry... It was rude to Susan, she didn't deserve it... But now I know weren't trying to ruin my date, not on purpose... I should have come back earlier..." He felt bad for shouting at him on the phone before, but he was so angry!
The soldier stroked Sherlock's wet hair. " Sherlock, it's not pathetic, it makes you human... You're not a machine, you're made of flesh and bones... And furthermore, I'm sure that something has happened in the past, am I right? That's why you're scared." He suggested, knowing that experiences from the past couple affect human psyche easily.
Unwillingly, he had to admit that Magnussen did a good job - he had no reason to worry about being revealed, he knew that detective's own pride was a great safeguard...
The steady banging of the knife against the chopping board echoed through the whole kitchen as John prepared the dinner. He stood at the kitchen unit and skillfully chopped the vegetables before he threw it into the bowl. However, it was surprising that he had all his fingers left, because his head roamed somewhere completely else.
Sherlock jerked so wildly that he almost fell off the chair and he looked as if he was about to get beaten.
While the soldier fought with his own body again, Sherlock stood there like a pillar, unsure of what to say or do to help his flatmate.
" Just drink it slowly, bubbles could irritate your digestion again if you'll drink it down..." Sherlock advised him, he really cared. " Just lay down and... and rest. You'll feel better then, maybe..." He told him and John had to wonder how was it possible to hate him and love him at the same time...
He was still wearing the soggy clothes - the tight purple shirt looked almost black and drops of water dripped from Sherlock's well-tailored black trousers. John didn't understand why the detective hasn't changed from the freezing clothes he wore...
Sherlock folded his doughy arms over his chest. " I'm clean if that's what you're asking about... Well, if that's all, you can go home now. And tell my brother that he doesn't have to worry..." He said, his voice seemingly neutral as if he was trying to prove him that there's nothing wrong with him.
But even though they were enjoying themselves, the younger Holmes had found himself peeking at Greg and Mycroft, the way they sat beside each other, the way Greg held him... His brother became a completely different person whenever near the Detective Inspector, he seemed more relaxed, happier. He always thought he was the more emotional one of the two, he had never expected the Ice Man to find a partner. As it seemed, Mycroft was better in everything. What a git...
The point where John stood was located in a blind alley, somewhere in the middle of the way to Baker Street. Even if John wanted to go on foot, he would never end up in that place. Unless...
I hope you don't find Mycroft's entrance too OOC, but I suppose that he would worry about his brother.
The woman folded her arms on her chest and her nose wrinkled. " Who's more important for you than your girlfriend... Your previous one warned me about it - I didn't believe her. But it's obvious - who are you kidding? I may not be a crazy genius, but I'm not that stupid as you think... Just leave me alone. " She spat, turned on her heel and strode away.
The doctor shrugged his shoulders as if it was a completely obvious and normal thing to do. " Yeah, you're the only reason why I didn't end it, you know? Do you know how many times I wanted to? But you were there and kept me sane... Well, sane... "
" Sherlock..." He finally spoke, but it came rather raspy. Clearing his throat, he continued. " I said no such thing... I just don't want you to be hungry... Look, it will take some time before your stomach accommodates to smaller amount of food, but you have to take things slowly..."
On the top of that, his stomach demanded for food almost every hour and its annoying rumbling was driving Sherlock insane!
The detective shook his head. Of course, it was a lie, his whole back was killing him, the inflamed wounds stung his skin.
Another wave of laughter echoed through the room. They could be surprisingly coordinated when it comes to bullying. What a shame they weren't using their brains more often in DIFFERENT situations, during the investigation, for example...
Sherlock's pale cheeks blushed and he lowered his gaze on the Billy who laid on the floor. " The thunderstorm..." He admitted, embarrassed by his weakness.
" I'm with Susan..." Said the doctor, his voice uninterested and cold like an icicle. " I'm sure you can handle your experiment by yourself..."
The doctor looked around the room. It looked empty, there was no one in the black armchair at the fireplace, nor at his messy desk. Where was that ridiculous man? He was nowhere to be seen, and John felt the uncomfortable sting of guilt in his stomach. He should have come back earlier, it was obvious that the detective needed him.
" I know it! Everyone thinks that! And I won't blame you if you'll think it too... You're too good for me. " Sherlock croaked, pulled out of the loving embrace and huge tears bulged in his eyes.
Except that the doctor did the very opposite, instead of pulling away from him in disgust he bent down in front of him, his hands travelled upwards and rested on his wide hips. The domestic movement felt so natural as if he was doing this every day...
The ex-soldier was well aware that his abdomen wasn't as firm and fit as it used to be during the military career. He knew that belly got a bit soft, but he didn't care too much. It happens when you're not using your muscles the way you did and John wasn't fat, no one would say that, just a bit chubby, cuddly.
John was muttering to himself as he kept caressing the pliable cushion of detective's large tummy, careful to not wake him up.
John immediately recognised friend's uncertainty, so tightened his grip on him and rubbed his fleshy side in a comforting manner. He didn't want to make Sherlock uncomfortable, but the stubborn man needed his help. Furthermore, he needed to regain his confidence back, a part of it at least.
The detective nodded shakily. "So I borrowed your jumper. It helps me to forget about unkind words. I had some work in the lab and it slipped out of my mind I was still wearing it. And that acid I was working with... my tube cracked and I burnt myself... John, I'm sorry for your jumper - "
John chuckled. God, that man could be a blighter. Sometimes he wondered how he managed to maintain his patience without punching his friend in his nose.
" Everything is boring according to you..." The ex-soldier grumbled and bowed his head down in another fit of retching.
The doctor sighed, knowing that the detective lied. " Sherlock, spill it... I know you too well to tell when you're fibbing..." Well, sometimes it wasn't easy to say, but this time it was so transparent...
But maybe he could  join John in the kitchen? He really missed him, his face, his voice, his smile. It's been a long time since he had seen him smile which was such a pity...
" Then tell me how am I supposed to be!" Sherlock yelled, frustrated. He didn't know what to do. He was trying, but as it seemed, it wasn't enough.
He took a concerned look at his friend and he wasn't happy with what he saw. Sherlock's face was white as a sheet and deep purple bags sat under his tired eyes like a large bruises. It was evident that the detective hadn't slept well lately...
" Well, it seems that you're in the gutter when you're crying over old jumper!" The detective noted.
" I... I don't know if I want you to see me like that... So weak and vulnerable, what would you think? You're a soldier, it's nothing compared to you. It's... It's nothing, really..." Sherlock stuttered nervously as he crumpled the hem of his white shirt, which was always quite tight on him, like a second skin. It was so baggy on him right now, he had to drop off his weight.
The doctor's fingers slid under Sherlock's defined chin and lifted his face to make eye contact. " There's nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone is scared of something, I've never met anyone who wouldn't be... Even soldiers in Afghanistan are afraid, you know..." Now that was true. Against his will, he remembered the fear on the front line in Afghanistan...
The dead man who laid oh his stomach, with his left arm under his torso, looked painfully similar to his army doctor.
Sherlock fixed his heterochromic eyes into John's. Tears flowed down his fallen cheeks. John held his breath, he had never seen Sherlock cry in his life, and he was terrified, in fact. Immediately he wished to take his words back, he felt so bad. "Sherlock, I'm so sorry... I didn't mean to scream, I'm just so worried. "
Sherlock's reaction was immediate, abrupt and absolutely non-Sherlockish. " Where are you going?" He hated how desperate his voice sounded, panting, filled with a new amount of panic. His heart he doubted he had any, pounded at least three times faster than usual.
All heads turned towards the door. Anderson gasped for breath and not even Sherlock himself couldn't deny he was surprised.
The redhead chortled gloomily. " Are you really so naive? Do you think I would like to have another date with you?" Her tone was cutting and venomous.
Sherlock bent down next to John and looked at him, completely amazed. " Hold on, do you really like it? But it's ugly... " He couldn't understand it.
He was so concerned when he came home from the work to find the flat empty, no signs of his flatmate and friend. Since he has started to live with him again, he never saw him leave the flat.
His friend was... gorgeous. The rays of the morning sun shone on his dark, almost black hair and painted brown highlights into his soft, messy curls. John smiled, he always wondered how Sherlock's hair would be like when he wakes up...
Maybe far too much - his locks had grown like a weed. It wasn't as bad as when he had come back from Serbia (he could be mistaken for a woman back then), but it wouldn't hurt to have them shortened.
" The room became too dull..." Sherlock replied and nodded towards the hall heading to his bedroom. " How come you're still here?" He asked, quite surprised. He knew that John stayed, but he couldn't tell why... Anyway, it didn't matter. It was just a matter of time before John goes back to his life with Mary and forgets about him... And he wouldn't blame him - after all, John needed adrenaline, adventure and excitement, and Sherlock couldn't offer him these things anymore.
The detective was laying in John's bed, curled into the ball. He was clasping something in his embrace, like clenching in it for a dear life. John took a better look at him. It was some dark blue stuff with red stripe and little white spots. ' Oh, God ... It's my Christmas jumper...' John realised.
" Nothing, I was just thinking out loud... I just need to arrange this, I'm sorry..." John swore in his mind, Susan had to think he's gone crazy. Well done, Watson, well done...
With a repulsed frown he took a fork and impaled a piece of lettuce. He glared daggers at the fork and tried to suppress the wave of panic when he brought it up to his lips. Then before he could change his mind, he stuck the piece of food in his mouth and started to chew.
He sat down beside him and put the clothes back on the floor. Sherlock seemed to relax a bit and John was glad he could help. " Don't worry, I'm right here... Nothing will happen to you..."
John nodded. " Sometimes I was so close to... " He told him as if nothing happened. " Why are you stuttering?" He asked curiously, he never did this before.
He sipped a bit of the dark soda and took a glance around himself, examining his friend's room. He had never been there, never even seen it. Otherwise, he was well aware that Sherlock has been in HIS room multiple times and he acted there as if it belonged him.
Sherlock lay curled on the sofa, his knees pressed against his chin. His chest kept rising and falling rapidly. He was shaking all over his body as if he had a fever, and his face was sweating. John reached his hand slowly and touched his sweaty forehead. No temperature, it had to be the nightmare. He looked so vulnerable, he was unnaturally white, pale than usual, and so thin, it was a hit in the eyes.
He should be disgusted, he wasn't gay, he has always been telling everyone... But he wasn't... He didn't feel repulsion or disgust towards the hand on his belly nor the man himself. It felt so weird yet so right as if John's middle was made for Sherlock's big hand to put on... The touch was comforting and it sent butterflies underneath his skin.
Sherlock's heart pounded faster when the adrenaline swelled inside him. He pulled away from his friend and looked him in the eye. " W-would it he-help y-you if I s-said t-that I-I-I ha-have been ha-ha-having t-those hallu... ha-hallucinations too? Y-you w-were wi-with m-me, te-te-telling me t-t-that it's w-wo-worth it... t-that y-you lo-love me and you're wai... waiting f-f-for me..." He closed his eyes as the blood was burning under his cheeks. This conversation was getting closer and closer to his pressure point.
The former soldier let out a sigh and covered Sherlock's wrist with his hand. " Sherlock, it's fine... I had the exactly same portion like you, and it wasn't a lot... It's just vegetables and bit of meat - if you're hungry, have some more!" He said, unaware of the disaster his sentence could cause.
John's voice gained a professional undertow, after all, he was a great doctor. " We will work on it. But first, you have to finish your sentences - the full sentence with subject and predicate is a base of recovery..."
Look, he may be a 'High-Functioning Sociopath', but he isn't as strong as he looks like... He cares about what people think, even though he says he doesn't."
Right above the double bed was hanged a big Periodic Table of Elements. John couldn't help but rolled his eyes, but soon he understood it wasn't a good idea... His head began to spin again and he took a big gulp of the drink again.
" Come, John! Lestrade called, there's a new case! Murder in the elevator!" His voice was beaming with delight and excitement, whole his body radiated with energy.
They continued chatting, about the food they ate, their hobbies and about the heavy rain outside, followed by claps of thunder and lightning.
But today it was different. Important. Right. It mattered... Sure, maybe it was caused by the guilt he felt for leaving the experiment do such harm to his best and only friend, but there was something else...
The detective's vanity and lack of relationships caused his self-esteem dwindle significantly and increased the fear of being rejected. God knows what he was told during his absence...
John was leaving... He can't be alone, not now... He stretched out his arm to grab the leg of John's jeans but even though his limbs were long, he couldn't reach him.
" What? I'm not here because of Mycroft, Sherlock, I'm here because of you! Because I want to. Do you understand?"
Staggering a bit when his unstable legs struggled to carry him, he headed to his room first, hoping to find some clothes that would fit him at least a bit... He knew that there was very little of clothing he possessed that he could squeeze into, but he was tired of waiting for his brother to send him something, he couldn't stand the restrictive feeling anymore!
With the rest of the evening, it continued to get colder and Greg lit the fire so they could have something to eat.
" What? Do you really think that I'll be in the mood for coming back today? Could you just one time behave like an adult and not like a spoiled brat?!" He spat and squeezed his phone in his fist until it almost broke in two pieces.
John wrapped his right arm around Sherlock's slender torso and pulled him into a warm embrace. With fingers of his left hand, he began to stroke detective's soft raven curls. Sherlock snuggled closer to John and curled around his short frame, enjoying the warmth coming from the doctor's body.
Greg gave him a sad smile, it wasn't difficult to tell what was the detective thinking about. " It's okay, Sherlock... Everyone needs a good hug sometimes... Even High-Functioning Sociopaths..." He said, took out a pack of paper tissues from the pocket of his jacket and handed it to his sniffing friend.
He almost lost the contact with people after the uni, except the Christmases and birthdays with his family and dead corpses during crime-solving (not that there would be some room to speak with them...). He didn't meet a sick person for a long time.
It was something around 11 o'clock in the evening when keys rattled in the lock of the entrance door and announced someone's entrance.
The detective did the same and tried to catch his hand. " So-so-sorry... Le-let me e-ex... ex-explain-"
" Stop pushing everyone away, you don't have to be alone. Just let me help you... Please... " John whispered, pleading him with his ocean-blue eyes.
Sherlock fixed his blurry unidentifiable eyes into Mycroft's greyish ones. " He's away, My!" He whispered, his voice was shaking.
But Greg knew that Sherlock won't be able to confess his feelings - he has always had problems with emotions, holding a view that 'caring is not an advantage'. And that goes twice for now...
Mycroft almost choked himself. What happened to him? Where was his cheeky sneer? He took a good look at him." I wish I could tell you the same..."
It was so OBVIOUS from the way boys acted around each other, from their exchanged looks and admirable nonverbal communication - the duo understood each other as no one other did.
John's body twisted in the effort, hot tears flowed down his round cheeks. " How does it seem?!" He snapped in a hoarse voice. It was a miracle he managed to say it between gags which shook his short frame.
The hungry detective wolfed down piece after piece, and the stomachache began to withdraw as his empty stomach started to fill. He had to admit that John was a good cook - his food tasted so differently from the excessively sugary, greasy and and filling mucks.
What if she wreaked her anger on him after their break-up? John couldn't lie to her anymore, he loved her but not in the way he loved Sherlock. He felt as if he just used her as some kind of patch, a replacement in the hole in his heart which created there after Sherlock jumped from the Bart's Hospital. He should be shocked and betrayed, shouldn't he?
John's eyes sparkled and he was trembling all over his body. " Shut up! SHUT THE FUCK UP! I could break your nose if I want to! One little word and I'm gonna do it! It was so important to me! But you can never understand this, you insufferable selfish machine! No wonder nobody likes you! " He shrieked and strode towards the door, stomping loudly, preparing to leave the house.
Sherlock pulled out of the grasp of his friend. " Don't touch me! I said I'm fine!" He snapped, angrily. It was a reflex, he couldn't stop himself. Suddenly, he was so afraid of the pain, that he's going to be beaten again.
Just like three years ago, when he solved the interesting case and heard the loud knocking on the door of the bathroom, followed by John's voice grumbling about the water consumption.
The detective tried to keep his voice calm and steady, but inside he was trembling. " Um... That's a burned hole I guess."
Sherlock's eyes widened and his heart started to throb in his chest. The idea of leaving the flat didn't seem much very tempting, but this was about John! He had to do something! " I'm on my way, send me an address!" He hanged off, grabbed a black parka which was hanged on the door and ran out on the street.
Sherlock opened his eyes and squinted into the darkness, trying to orientate himself in the setting, but with a buzzing in his head, he wasn't very successful. He took a deep breath and jerked at a sharp pain in his stomach.
Sherlock tilted his head and it seemed like he was deep in thought. " Almost everything..." His 'egoistic' response made the soldier roll his eyes.
" Thank you, sweetheart..." Mary gave him a sweet smile and ruffled his already messy hair as if she was praising a well-trained animal.
Fortunately, the weather sided with their little trip, it was a very nice afternoon. The air of early summer felt warm against their cheeks, the light breeze made a comfortable surrounding, not too cold or hot. It smelled nice, like a clear and fume-less environment, accompanied by the scent of mushrooms, flowers and wood.
The tent sank into a few minutes of silence, the only thing that could be heard was their quiet breath and the hooting of tawny owl.
Another rustle, this time from John's side of the tent. The doctor turned his head to the right, seeing just the silhouette of his companion. " No... Why are you asking?" The ex-soldier said in the in an undertone, a bit worried about the way he sounded.
His fingers curled around the soft woollen material and Sherlock almost sighed in relief. But as soon as he perceived that this "stolen", baggy sweater was the only thing he had after his first and only best friend, his throat tightened.
John blinked in a confusion and then his face fell. " Well... Oh, sorry, if you want me to go, I'll - " His voice trailed off and his shoulders tensed visibly.
" To the crime scene... Just leave me alone!" The doctor ordered, desperately wanted to be alone. He hated when Sherlock gazed at him as if he was some kind of exhibit.
In any other day, John would just smile at seeing his flatmate who has always been considered as a Sociopath grinning like a child.
Actually, he still couldn't understand why was Sherlock acting this way whenever he was around him. He wasn't different than every other person, was he? He was his best friend and he really cared about him. Maybe even more than a friend does, he had to admit. But he could safely say that he absolutely didn't mind the way Sherlock looked like. Well, actually he did a bit, in the medical facet, he was a doctor after all, and he was well aware of diseases and risks caused by obesity.
He knew that he would care for his John even if it wasn't his fault, he wouldn't let him suffer alone. He was sure John would do the same, after all, he was a doctor. But something was telling him that John's intention wasn't only applying his medical skills, he would do it because, somehow, he cared back about the ridiculous man.
Brown was a kind-hearted older man with graying hair, friendly, tanned face and thick glasses, but even despite his good-natured personality, he had to tell him the truth. The honest, unpleasant truth and Sherlock had to face it.
The detective continued to wriggle and bit his lower lip to prevent himself from screaming, his bed creaking a bit under his weight. Hot tears run down his soft cheeks and the doctor could almost hear his heart pound inside his chest.
" Stupid puns? What do you mean? I'm not the one who writes kitschy, trashy and pathetic stories about 'just two of us against all world..." The detective sneered, he didn't want to look like a desperate wretch. But inside, he cursed himself into blinking idiots.
The man from British Government rubbed the bridge of his eagle-shaped nose and thought about what to say, feelings had never been his forte.
And then there was a loud crack of thunder, still really close. It surprised John a bit, he has completely forgotten about the weather outside. Sherlock's reaction, on the other hand, was scary. He almost jumped out of his skin and yelped as he pressed his palms on his ears - he almost slapped John in the face in doing so. He squeezed his eyes shut, and whimpered, trembling all over his body.
His black messy hair clung to his high forehead, the curls not so obvious because they got straightened from the wetness.
Heterochromic eyes sparkled despite the darkness of the tent. " Really?" John's heart jumped when he heard a hint of hope. " But... I thought you weren't gay?"
" Sherlock, none of this is your fault, I just got crazy... I'm the only one who is responsible for that... I'll understand if you don't want to talk to me anymore because I'm insane..."
His naked form is next to me and I’ve still got my tight jeans, my underwear and my socks on.  He’s rubbing my cock through my pants.  I can’t stop my hips from thrusting into his touch.  He’s nibbling my neck, my ear.  My trousers are open.  He’s dipping his fingers inside the waistband of my pants.  He’s smiling.  I look down in horror.   I wore the red, silky briefs, commonly referred to as my ‘getting laid’ briefs.  How humiliating.
Sherlock moved down and licked John’s cock root to tip.  It tasted divine.  He didn’t have any desire to pull it all the way into his mouth, but he did like to smell it and taste it and touch it.  He moved lower, his hands rolling John’s testicles, feeling the wavy skin, the feeling of his clean hair there and around the base of his cock.  It was heavenly.  He lifted John’s leg up and wider to expose him further.  He just couldn’t get enough of that clean, warm smell, the taste.  The thought of “mine” came to him unbidden.  John would have been his already if it hadn’t been for … well for way too many things conspiring against them in the universe.  This was a cosmically bad idea.  But John was writhing and willing beneath him and he had to have him.  Just once.  He had to know what being engulfed by this warmth truly felt like.  Just this once.  Just tonight.  No past, no labels, no identity crises, just them.  Two friends consoling each other on a difficult night.
“Fucking tease.”  There was no finesse, no technique.  Just one long, hard thrust in and then out and repeat.  Repeatedly.  “That’s it.  It’s already in, just go with it now.” Mike talked with a gravelly, disgusting tone directly into Sherlock’s ear, full body resting on top of Sherlock, arms snaked around his head, holding him in place.
“The next one can be very uncomfortable.   I’ll use a very small probe and insert it into the rectum.  I’ll be able to see your prostate.”
John grabbed for the elastic and the only vestige of modesty he had left.  “You’re taking off my pants?  Why?”  He tried not to sound all Victorian virgin about it, but it might have had an air of squeakiness to it.
John had just buzzed the intercom to signal for the next patient when the exam room door burst open behind him.  He didn’t have time to think about how quick of a response that had been from the receptionist before he heard her shouting “You can’t go in there!  It’s not your turn!!”
John Watson was usually a very sound sleeper.  Well, since he became flatmates with Sherlock Holmes at least.  He knew the man kept odd hours, not to mention odd habits with odd experiments.  He was used to having the restless sounds of Sherlock stirring about in their flat late at night when most of the country was fast asleep, including John.  If he did stir, it was, at least easy to fall back to sleep.  The physician in him did, however, become alert to alarming noises or to habits that were clearly out of the ordinary.
John found the gland easily, checked for the size, shape and feel of it.  “I’m going to check your rectal wall.”
The man stood, stunned and blundered something vaguely apologetic and Mycroft rolled his eyes and dismissed them all from the room.
“Good.  We have to get you sorted and change the exam table paper.  Dr Mumford could be in at any time now.”
Sherlock hissed at the feel of the warm flannel on his cock and then collapsed back onto the mattress.  “Good that feels … good and odd at the same time.”
John looked briefly surprised but shook it off just as quickly and nodded without scolding Sherlock even though he very much looked like he wanted to.  Again, probably for the benefit of not making Sherlock feel weakened in front of Mycroft.
Sherlock grabbed John’s waist and pulled them upward together and pulled out eliciting a wince from John.  “Sorry, sorry.”  He pulled off the condom and binned it.
“It’s quite simple, really.  The average human male thinks about penetrative sex every 14.8 seconds and actively participates in the act approximately twice per week if he’s married and three times per week if he’s single but living with someone.  You and I have been exclusively with each other for the past three months.  No, we have never said we’re exclusively together, but I haven’t seen anyone else, of course and neither have you or I would have known.  It simply stands to reason that you might desire penetrative intercourse instead of,” he moved a hand in the air with a flourish, “what it is we’ve been up to.”
Sherlock is convinced that he cannot override the Serbia memories with John, though he has tried, because Serbia is real.  It happened.  He has fantasized about being with John but that is never going to happen in reality.  Merlin/Mercutio is his reality right now.  It’s just sex, he convinces himself.  He’s not a blushing virgin so what difference does it make who he has it with as long as it overrides … just overrides.
“Fine, just don’t bore me with the ‘not wanting to ruin our friendship’ conversation again.  We’ve already been through all that.”
His first thought had been John.  John was his rock, his light.  If the fall hadn’t happened, Sherlock thought they would probably already be together.  It was apparent to Sherlock that John was indeed attracted to Sherlock despite his insistence on not being gay.  Being gay was just one of those labels Sherlock didn’t believe in.  The sexuality scale was vast and labels were ignorant.  If he gave John enough time, he would realize that himself.
“I don’t know what you are looking for when you do that, aside from the obvious, liver borders, lumps, masses, and etcetera.  I know what I’m looking for though.”
Sherlock made it to the hallway before he turned around.  “Would you mind if I take a shower first?”
“I know.”  They remained still, Sherlock’s cock head stilled just inside of John’s arse, both of them breathing within each other’s space.  “I feel like an idiot.”
“I don’t give a damn, Sherlock.  When you say stop, things should stop, right then, right there, without question.  Period.”
Sherlock laid flat once more and flipped onto his front side.  “Just so you know, I did enjoy that.”
“I’m not in the mood for games Sherlock and I certainly don’t want to talk about it so just do it and be done with it.”  He huffed not for the first time that night.  “I’m sorry I kissed you but I just … I would rather … nevermind, just get on with it.”
Mike was a bouncer at one of London’s premier nightclubs.  It was easy to sneak out of the flat at 3am on a weeknight to meet him at the club.  John wouldn’t even notice.  He’d wake up and go to work not even realizing that Sherlock wasn’t asleep in his room with the door closed.
Sherlock was a bit perplexed by the phrasing John used but was distracted immediately by a call from Lestrade.
Sherlock took a moment to think about what it would be like to have John like that, as his, as his lover, his partner, someone to make future plans with and talk about whether or not they need a new sofa or a dog.  He thought about going to Angelo’s and John not caring that there was a candle placed on the table or needing to correct anyone’s assumptions about them.  He thought about holding hands at crime scenes and how Lestrade would slap John on the shoulder and say “About damn time, mate!  Thought you’d never figure it out” and John would smile and his eyes would light up when he looked at Sherlock like he was the best thing that ever happened to him.  Then, after a case or a chase through London, they would stumble up the stairs kissing and pulling at clothes and just be so mad for each other they couldn’t even wait to get to the bedroom.  John would say things like “God, I’m gone over you” and “Sherlock, I love you” and he would pull off his coat and throw it aside along with Sherlock’s scarf and then he’d pull on his shirt until all the buttons went flying and then he’d see Sherlock’s scars on his back and he’d say “Where did those come from?”
“No?  Alright, I have it right here then.”  He sat on the side of the bed and fished for his pants on the floor beside the bed.  “Ah, here we go.”  He held up two small packets, one condom, one packet of surgical lube.  “Hope that’s enough slick, I’m afraid that’s all I brought.  I could get some out of my kit though if you need it.”  He rambled.
“When we first met,” John continued, “I did come on to you.  You let me down in no uncertain terms.  You were ‘married to your work’ and over the several months that I’ve lived here I’ve never seen evidence that you were … well, that you were ever into that sort of thing.”  John looked up at Sherlock who had a distinctly neutral facial expression.  Not getting any insight into whether or not that assumption was correct, John kept on.  “It really did seem you were married to your work.  The cases were more important than eating, hell, going to the bathroom and breathing seemed like a nuisance to you so I stopped myself thinking about it.  About your sexuality at all.  You were just different like that.”
John vaguely noticed Sherlock talking to someone and registered that as a bit odd before the man moved as though startled, pulled out a knife and quickly stabbed Sherlock before taking off at a dead run.
I list the familiar symptoms of hypoxemia and try to put a look of something other than complete and utter panic on my face.  The time I’ve spent attempting to face my fear, the weeks spent finding a place to go without being seen, the countermeasures taken has led to this place.  I can do this.  I will do this.
With his arse spread wide open, John began to run his fingers along the middle, pulling his cheeks open and stroking his entrance lightly.  “Your hole is so beautiful, Sherlock.  I could lick it all day.”
“Thank God,” John sighed in relief.  “Look, Sherlock.  About us … or whatever this is and I hope that it’s more than you solving cases and me blogging about it, I just … I want you to know … if it happens naturally, organically, then great.  If we just be us, just the way we are, nightmares and scars and whatever comes up, then that’s fine to.  It’s all fine, Sherlock.  The important thing to know is I’m not going anywhere.  You are it for me.  I’m gone on you no matter what and I’m staying until you say otherwise.  Clear?”
By the time John had his patient packed up and his prescriptions written, Sherlock was snoring softly.  Unfortunately, John had to wake him.  It took several nudges and several times to call out his name but he finally came to although a bit groggy.
“Absolutely not!”  Sherlock was up and out of his chair.  He nearly hissed as the sudden movement caused him pain, but managed to stop himself from making the sound.  John noticed anyway.
“As you can probably ascertain, that level of intimacy is rarely achieved by a sociopath such as myself.”
“You’re being an arse,” John mumbled and then removed the object after he heard the digital beep and handed it back to Sherlock.
“Do you even hear yourself?  You thought.  You thought, after what he’s already been through, that you should take away his own power to decide who knows and when or even IF I know?”  He shifted his weight and glared at Mycroft.  “Brilliant that is.” He pointed a finger at the most powerful man in London and flat out told him to fuck right off.  “Fuck you and your good intentions, Mycroft.”  He turned toward Sherlock with a decidedly gentler look in his eyes, a smile that took more effort to manage on his face.  “Would you like to take a ride over the surgery and I can have Sarah take a look at you? Or I can call her here if you’d rather.”
“Your face is flush, your pupils dilated and your head is in an upturned position.  It’s quite obvious you would like to kiss.”
“Easy, Love.”  John draped himself over Sherlock’s back keeping his body well away from causing any possible friction to Sherlock’s cock.  He did thrust his hips toward Sherlock’s getting a bit of friction on his own still-clothed cock.  “One more, Love.  Then I’ll make you come.”
“I promise I’m not going to do anything more invasive than you’ve done to me.  I just want to visualize the cremastor reflex.”
Just as he was about to send a text, he heard the front door open and then John’s gait on the steps.  Heavier steps than usual.  Either he’s carrying something or he’s hurt.  Unable to take the suspense any longer, he pulled the door to their flat open and rushed down the stairs in just his dressing gown.
“No, now that we’ve discussed the issues, we should decide to take us to the next level.”  His gaze intensified.  “I don’t want your anal virginity, John.  I want you.”
“Oh yes, keep making that noise.  Yes!”  Sherlock continued his thrusts and stroking John’s cock.  He was right there.  Just one more … and when he heard that lovely whimper again he could not hold himself back any longer.  “Oh, god John!  Oh you’re so fucking beautiful … God!”
“PTSD?” John wrinkled his brow.  “What about it?”  As a doctor and as a patient diagnosed with this particular acronym, he was fully aware of what Post-traumatic Stress Disorder was, but he obviously didn’t understand what that had to do with Sherlock at the moment.
“See ya later gents.  Hope you feel better soon, Sherlock.”  With that, Lestrade left the apartment, closing the door behind him.
Lestrade let out a sigh of relief.  “Oh thank God.”  He motioned toward the door.  “If you don’t need anything, I’ll go back to the Yard and let the guys know.”
Sherlock dropped to his knees in the shower.  The water suddenly so cold, people … men yelling at him in Serbian, hosing off his naked body.  The whip making painful cracks against his skin, the smell of damp concrete and blood.  Being pushed forward against a wet wall, face scrapping against the brick, being impaled.  Pain.
Slowly, John’s thoughts attempted to find the answer to Sherlock’s question.  He knew the answer was somewhere within his brain.  “Yes … yes, top drawer.  Nightstand.”
"Looks like the bleeding has mostly stopped," John assessed when he removed the cloth to have a look. "No ambulance. I'll treat him at home." He gave Sherlock a knowing wink.
John nodded and smiled sheepishly.  “Well now I feel like an ass for having you console me about it.”
Mycroft sighed.  “Oh, Sherlock.  Just because one form of rape was less torturous than the other doesn’t make it any less of one.”
“Mmm.. that’s nice.”  Sherlock spoke into John’s ear.  “You feel so nice.  So warm.  Wish this could never end.”
About the time John concluded that he really, very much needed to talk with Sherlock, he heard the shower start.  He supposed he could go into the bathroom while he was in the shower, God knows he’d entered the bathroom to shave or take a piss during Sherlock’s showers and vice versa over the months to think that was fine, but he thought, given how fast Sherlock had high-tailed it away from John, Sherlock might not appreciate the intrusion at the moment.  Best to give him a minute to process.  But, John also thought Sherlock was probably freaking out a bit too.  ‘
“No, I wouldn’t do that.  Bending your hip might compress the blood vessels and cut off the circulation to your leg.”  John squared his jaw, “But you already knew that, right?”
“Niceties?”  It takes me a moment to shake the memory of the moans and the rapid slapping of skin on skin…ugh, that’s not to say that I didn’t think about leaving the flat when he was doing it, but I … didn’t.  “It was for the betterment of your libido.”  I accused.
Moving was a delicate issue.  He could see the state of the sheets and felt a fresh flow of wetness below when he moved.  All thoughts of attempting to flee the scene were thwarted.  He did need to have that fixed lest John find out and that just would not do at all.  John would be home by 4:30.  He had approximately five hours to have this dealt with and still have time to get home, burn his clothes and assemble some sort of experiment in the kitchen John would believe he had been working on all day.  He would be sore but he was convinced he’d be able to hide that from John.   John wasn’t the most observant although he was getting better at that thanks to his own influence on him.
"Right. Okay." John shrugged. He really didn't like it when Sherlock took medical business into his own hands. Mostly he was worried about him ignoring major signs but he supposed a minor thing like hand stitches wasn't that big of a deal so he let it go. "I probably should've given you a tetanus booster. I'll bring one home tomorrow."
They both moved about the room quickly, getting all of the equipment back in the correct order, removing their garbage and collecting their samples carefully.  By the time they went to leave, it looked like nobody had been there since the day before.  They turned the lights off in the exam suite and were just about to open the door when they heard the booming voice of Malcolm calling out for Dr Mumford.
John’s hips spasmed a couple times, he took in a few shallow breaths and made himself stop from coming directly into Sherlock’s mouth right then and there.  Jeezus it took some effort and not a small amount of images from the anti-spank bank.  “No love.  Nothing wrong at all.”  He bent down and kissed Sherlock softly. “I’m just … I’m desperate to get off at the moment and I don’t want to come that way.”
Sherlock concentrated a moment and then stated.  “I feel something’s not quite right.  I think your medication was effective.”
“No, don’t … don’t apologize to me Sherlock.”  John sniffed and shook his head trying to form some semblance of control.  “I … I would have preferred to know, but I’m not going to make you feel guilty about not telling me sooner.  I …”  John straightened himself upright and nodded “Right, well, I won’t dwell on that right now.  At what point did this happen while you were … away?”
Sherlock pushed John’s hands away quickly and grabbed his jacket placing it quickly in his lap and then sitting down in a chair at the table.  He looked for all the world as though he would rather spend time in the company of Anderson rather than John at the moment.  He looked miserable and forlorn and pressed his arm across his lower belly, his jacket in front of him.
“Um … five people on staff.”  John gently pulled Sherlock’s top leg forward, further exposing Sherlock for examination.
John looked dumbfounded toward Lestrade who wasn’t laughing either.  “Sherlock, I don’t find it the least bit funny at all,” John stated with all seriousness sitting on the edge of the sofa, pulling at Sherlock’s hips so he could unfasten his belt.
Sherlock stood, ready for battle.  “The chances of meeting someone once, let alone twice with violent tendencies…”
Sherlock huffed before he turned and flicked the light switch, surrounding them both in darkness.  John was just about to ask what the hell he was doing but then he heard a click and a small, bright torch was being shined into his face and Sherlock’s hand was on his head holding his eyelid open.
After John excused himself to go upstairs to sleep, Sherlock purposely left his mobile phone in the kitchen and then went to bed himself.  He knew the nightmares would come back but he had to start sleeping again.  Or at least, not waking himself on purpose anymore.  The case was done.
“You’re right,” John agreed in the interest of moving on.  “Let’s get on with it.  My stethoscope is on the desk.”  John hopped up onto the exam table.
“Humph …No, I’m not … not this position.” Sherlock grunted and moaned in misery as the burly man laid himself on top of him, his cock sliding between Sherlock’s cheeks.  The panic began to multiply.
“It’s okay.”  His hands caress my ass.  I feel two fingers run from my balls all the way up the crack of my ass.  He separates my cheeks.  He runs the side of his hand up and down the crack.  My ass is propped in the air.  I am completely vulnerable to him.
"You heard me, call an ambulance. I'm going to A&E. John, text my brother and tell him not to come. You know if me and an ambulance are within 30 yards of one another he shows up."
John sighed, but grabbed a tea towel from the kitchen and complied, sitting at the end of the sofa.  Sherlock nudged him down just a little bit and then put a pillow at the end of the sofa, over the arm.  He then laid down over John’s lap, on his side facing John, his head on the pillow.  Bending his knees up  a bit had him curled around John’s body with their bellies against each other.  Sherlock tucked in the covers around them and closed his eyes.
Slowly, he was able to bring himself back to the present.  The water was starting to get cooler but he saw the shower at Baker Street, the smells were of his familiar home again, the pain receded once more.
“Pardon?”  I crossed my arms in front of my chest knowing full well what my body language conveyed.  “I had no intentions of ever shagging you until … until…  You weren’t intending to trick me then?”
John sat back on his haunches taking the weight off his arms as he kissed along Sherlock’s collar bone and then down his chest as he unbuttoned the shirt, nipping and kissing with each new inch of exposed skin.  Finally he spread the shirt front open and had to sit up and just look at all of the glorious, pale, smooth skin that he had seen before but could never touch.  This deserved some time to appreciate.  He ran his hands along Sherlock’s ribs, across his pectoral muscles, tweaking a nipple along the way as he trailed along the thin line of hair leading down into Sherlock’s pants.  John smirked and hooked his arms behind Sherlock’s knees bringing them up to rest on John’s shoulders.  He pulled off a sock, kissed the arch of the foot and did the same with the other.  He kissed the ankle on his left side and then the shin on his right.  He kissed a knee and then the other watching as Sherlock bit his lip and slowly became unglued.
He brought his hand up to his mouth and gave his fingers a healthy dose of saliva.  “You’ll feel a little pressure.”  I think about all the times I’ve told my patients that same line.  Depending on the outcome of this day I know I will either have to come up with a different line or smile inappropriately every time I say that.
Thankfully, Sherlock had the forsight to remove his own coat before the ambulance showed up. They did cut away any clothing that was in the way of doing a proper assessment of his wounds and also to started an IV in his arm. Sherlock was annoyed they wouldn't allow him to remove his favorite purple shirt because of the "spine precautions". That young, new constable looked smug when they loaded Sherlock onto a gurney with a full neck brace and back board. John helped them load Sherlock into the back of the ambulance and told Sherlock he'd meet him at A&E.
Lowering himself deliberately into the leather chair, Sherlock made sure not to wince in the presence of his brother.  A show of weakness would make Mycroft all the more likely to project his anger onto …
“Yes.”  John clenched around Sherlock’s cock still inside him, testing.  It was still burning, low and solid.  Nearly throbbed, but not quite.
“Oh, Sherlock.”  Man’s inhumanity to man always astounded John.  Why couldn’t the idiot simply say ‘no, thank you, but we can still be friends’?  This moment probably defined who Sherlock became and why he never let anyone else in afterwards.
John looked angry.  “Oh, come off it!  You’re talking to me like you did the first time I met you.”  John shifted his weight and drew in a deep breath as Sherlock turned to face him once more.  “After all the complete and utter shit, we’ve been through in the last 24 hours, hell the last few years, are we really going to go back to square one?”
A firm grip to John’s shoulder stopped him from turning.  “Stay on your back, please?” He needed to see him, to make sure this wasn’t all just a cruel dream.
Sherlock sighed but stood up, turned around and with some trepidation, not to mention handicap from the injury to his dominant hand, he finally dropped his trousers and leaned forward on the kitchen table.
Are you fucking kidding…oh sweet mother of all that is fucking….holy shit…the heavens parted and the angels sang.  There may have been a “guhnnng…ahhh” in answer to his question.  I did not know, I just knew that I needed to feel like that more often.
John assessed the area, noted the stitches were still well placed, the skin knitting back together nicely, no increased bruising to the area and then he noticed Sherlock's penis becoming thicker and thicker by the second. It was hard to miss. It had been laying there lazily on Sherlock's thigh just a couple inches away from the wound. John looked up toward Sherlock's face, surprise evident.
John didn’t let Sherlock push attention back onto him instead of where it should be focused.  “Ingrained military fortitude and all that.”  He donned exam gloves. “Oh, before I forget.”  He grabbed a syringe with a long needle-nose tip.  “This is full of an anesthetic gel.  I’ll need to push this into your urethra to numb the area before I do the scope.  It takes a few moments to work so I’ll get that out of the way while we do the other.  It should take effect by the time I’m done.
“No.  I don’t suppose I can speak on first-hand authority, but I should think this would be easier than a manual prostate exam.”
Licking a stripe of moist heat from the base of Sherlock’s cock to his tip, caused the writhing man beneath him to buck up off the bed wildly.  John placed his forearm across Sherlock’s hips to keep him grounded since he didn’t particularly feel like having the man’s cock shoved down the back of his throat.  Once he was secured to the bed properly, John took his cock inside his mouth letting it glide loosely in and out of his mouth, getting it wet, feeling it hit the roof of his mouth and sliding across his tongue.  Not wanting to let the use of his other hand go to waste, John began running his hands along Sherlock’s body, everywhere—his sensitive nipples, along his side, his inner thighs, down to his calves and back up to grab behind his knee and push Sherlock’s leg out and up toward his chest.
“Yes, I’m sure it’s very realistic to shrug off penetrative sex when you’ve been an enthusiastic participant in it since age sixteen.”  Sherlock brushed off John’s touch.  “It’s fine.”
Forehead to forehead they laid just breathing together for a few moments until John broke the silence.  “So, any more questions about prostate stimulation?”
Sherlock took a moment to gather his thoughts.  “You have no idea how intolerant of other people I am.  As soon as people … nearly all people, open their mouths, they have already proven themselves dull and pedestrian.  Yes, I’ve met some that captured my attention for brief periods of time, but never long enough to cultivate a comfortable physicality with them, let alone a sexual relationship. I cannot stop the thoughts in my head.  My mind has always won over any sort of physical or hormonal want and inevitably these people … men … that have had my attention briefly, do prove themselves just as intolerable as everyone else.  It has never taken long.”
John nodded nervously.  “Right, yeah.  Well, in the interest of full disclosure here, I just wanted to say that I … I do fancy you.”
Sherlock groaned.  “Please … I hate vomiting, John.”  He put his hand over his mouth quickly as though the act itself was an imminent event.  Sherlock took deep, slow, purposeful breaths and closed his eyes, apparently attempting to prevent the hated action.
“Ah, small talk first, it is then.  I would like to eat as little as possible, enough to get you off my back followed by as little small talk as necessary about my scars, my ‘psychological wounds’, my sexual experiences pre and post rape and then pre and post last week and the final highlight of the evening, going to fucking bed where I will then fall asleep and relive in great detail all of the things mentioned above.  I don’t need a therapist.  I talk already.  I talk to you.  I talk to you over and over and over again until I am nothing but what has happened and you won’t let me go on cases because ‘I’m recovering’ and you won’t talk about anything else and I swear to fucking God, if I hear the word ‘therapist’ come out of your mouth once more, I will scream, I swear to God, I will scream!”
Sherlock shook his head, “mmm  mm, I think you covered the material rather … comprehensively.”  Sherlock grumbled sleepily and nuzzled into John’s shoulder, both of them messy and sated, falling asleep in each other’s arms.
Suddenly he pulled away, grabbed my hand to place the packets within it and turned onto his stomach, pillow under his hips.  “Go on, then.  It’s yours.”
,’ Sherlock reminded himself.   Remembering the calming techniques he found online, he kept his eyes open and named three things in the room.  ‘
