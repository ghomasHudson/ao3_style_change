“I don’t think this went exactly how anyone expected it to,” Dean answers. He spreads his arms and grins, “but hey, you win some, you lose some. At least you get a full blooded Winchester, ready and willing.”
“I wish I knew.” Dean didn’t sleep enough. He feels a headache pounding behind his eyes. He’s so tired. “Do you think we should call your dad? Maybe he can help.”
leaving. What he and his dad actually do for work, because that’s the truth, and he wants her to know.
Of course Sam wouldn’t know what Castiel has done to other angels he’s crossed paths with. He and Dean had been in the middle of researching, spell casting - something to protect them from the angels that want to take Castiel away. “What would you have me do with her?”
"But then what about your scrapbook?" Dean mocks, leaning against the fence and watching however many tons of water spill down into the rocks below. Apparently it's better on the Canadian side, but Dean takes what he can get.
* "And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack" is the opening lyric to Talking Heads' hit song Once in a Lifetime, which takes a lot of its lyrics from Evangelical sermons (I guess Cas's lectures on new wave finally permeated into Dean's brain).
“No, yeah,” Dean says, harried. “You can. Go ‘head. That’s.” He nods, smiles. Cas kisses him again and Dean just tries to lay back and make it something good, easy, tries to hold the good feelings he had moments ago in his hands.
His mind strays back to Sam and Ruby. He had smelled the demon blood on his brother as soon as they were face-to-face, heard enough whispers through the grapevine to know who that culprit was. “What, with true love’s kiss?”
“How about your wings?” Castiel stands, moving past Dean to look out at the drab parking lot of the random motel room they’re holed up at. “There’s nothing out there, angel, the real show’s right here.”
"I thought you had some shiny new business associates from downstairs that were helping you with that. It's still easier than what I’m about to do.” Dean can just about hear Sam’s scowl from the other end of the line.
“If that idiot just got absorbed into the pack…” Dean knew that’s how a lot of hunters went. Either they died fighting one of these monsters or they ended up getting turned, which was even worse. There was no way he was going after a pack on his own, but maybe he’d put some feelers out… He frowned. No, that was stupid. Guy either got smart enough to stay away until he had back up, or he was dead. Or a werewolf, in which case he’d be dead sooner or later.
Angels can’t see into demon’s minds easily, as Castiel had said, but it can be done. Dean’s not sure when the penny dropped, but by the time Michael's lying prone in the dirt, Lucifer tells them he knew of their plan to reopen the cage with the Horsemen’s Rings.
“You really think Michael would want me now? I don’t think even with the extra credit of letting him use me like a sock puppet I’d be able to graduate to upstairs. So why should I let heaven win?” Lucifer just smiles at him, but it's like how primates smile - all aggression, a warning before a bloody, painful death.
Unlike Lilith, Lucifer doesn't have to wait for anything, and there's no point in hiding away. Dean follows the trail of destruction alone, just him and his car.
Dean shrugs. Remembers Cas can't see him. "I dunno. More'n mos' people… if there's no money or no motel. Boston's, um. 'Spensive. You know?"
“The witches there mentioned a tablet with divine origin,” Castiel admits. “They killed an angel before we found them, and it was a rather talkative one.”
not. She just found someone to make it happen.” He frowns. “Dean, what do you know about demonology?”
He knows Dean is thinking about those vampires. The ones that supposedly only fed on animals so that they could avoid taking a human life. The ones he killed anyway.
She’s still using some blonde chick, bouncy and blue-eyed. Her smile looks like it could cut. “Thought those hellhounds dragged your soul downstairs last year, too.” She waltzes around him. The knife he has won’t do anything, and Castiel is fighting on the other side of the street.
If Ben thee Edlund can give us the Rhonda Hurley line then I'm allowed to give Dean a weirdly close male friendship that he couldn't parse out the meaning of until he had his bisexual awakening years later. I know this could've also been Lee, but once we get past like, s9 the spn canon can get so weirdly convoluted that I just play a game of darts to determine which facts actually happened and which got shoehorned in by the writers. Also Bobby was not around when Lee was and I wanted them to have this Moment.
angel," Dean says, tossing a fry at some interested looking seagulls, "unless, you know, he wants to switch it up."
“I gave Sam your number.” Dean raises an eyebrow at him, but accepts the call. He can hear Sam’s voice, harried and anxious, on the other end of the line.
Getting closer, Cas can see something round under the clover. Dean ducks down and starts tearing up the dirt. After a minute they see the top half of a skull, picked clean and dust-stained.
Cas leans forward in his seat. "What about up here?" Dean was about to give up on the idea, so at the suggestion he pulls the car to the side and shuts it off.
Castiel rolls his shoulders. “Somehow, I doubt that.” Dean thinks that’s going to be the end of it. Castiel is touchy about the Grace-impotence thing. But he draws the curtains, and flexes himself just so, and in the moment between one lightning flash and the resuming darkness Dean can see the shadows of them unfurling, spreading throughout the room.
*** Eleanor Lance steals from the character and actress from The Haunting, since Bela seems to like to use horror films for her aliases :)
"Obviously," Cas says. Cas is so rarely blasé and confident when it comes to his relationships with other people - Dean's seen him practically crawl up the walls to get away from girls that want his number, and none of Cassie's friends have scored either. "Aren't we?"
Dean could let him go, could leave the ruins of the building and make sure the Impala is okay, get the hell out of here and hole up somewhere safe.
Castiel thinks he might even be alright with it. He thinks of Dean's face, the way his mouth trembled when he said,
There's no longer a gaping maw in the earth, and Sam slumps to the ground. Above him, Dean's untethered, swirling and cutting through the air. Bobby shakes Sam by the shoulder, and his brother looks up at the sky, darkened as Dean streaks across it in undulating waves of black smoke.
John cocks the shotgun. Cheryl gives him a withering glare, looking every bit the petulant drama queen. “Well? This is what you wanted, isn’t it?”
Also for any Cubs fans I apologize for putting a Neil Diamond song in there - 'Sweet Caroline' is more of a Red Sox tradition (though enough other teams play that song that I figured it wasn't too much of an egregious error in terms of Songs Played at Sports Games). Also there is currently no free day at the Chicago Art Institute unless you're from IL, so maybe Dean and Cas just fake ID-ed their way into staring at Ed Hopper paintings.
No fucking way. I can’t - can’t tell him I couldn’t -” He shuts his eyes, heart thumping in his chest like something is
Dean knows they’re torn to shreds, ugly and molting. Knows Castiel damn near destroyed them for good trying to get them both out of the deepest reaches of the Pit. He’d still be a formidable fighter as a human, but as he is now he’s too weak to phone home even if he wanted to. While he isn’t happy with Dean’s status as a new and improved legion of hell, he doesn’t stand much of a chance as an angel alone in the midst of the coming apocalypse.
The clerk raises an eyebrow. “You mean it?” she says, already reaching for the cigarettes. He does actually need a new pack, burned through his last smoke on his way up to meet John, windows rolled down in the hot weather so his dad couldn’t sniff out the bad habit. The condoms, not so much. He hasn’t used them since he had his freak out back in early spring when he decided to fuck any girl that smiled at him, back before he and Cas -
"Oh shut up and listen," he presses on, "knowing what we know now? Enough people have been fiddling with you, me, and our entire family, just for some stupid brother bitch fight that got started before humans were even a thing. We're about as free as we can be, now. We can do whatever we want." He grins. "You could even go back to school."
Dean doesn't get what she's implying for a second. Then her meaning crashes down with an intense clarity. "What? That's not - no. No way."
"And why's that?" Dean turns onto a road where there’s a reservoir on one side, forest on the other. They go on for a few miles in silence. Dean takes another drag and tosses the butt out of the window, digs in his pockets for gum and chews that next. He can see a large plume of smoke across the water.
“That’s what they want, heaven and hell? That’s why I’m here?” Dean’s form seems to consider the space they’re in, the sound of tortured cries, the darkness, and the never ending despair of ten billion souls tortured and torturing forever, and ever, and eons after that. Castiel is still trying to get his bearings, and can’t properly fight back when Dean reaches out and grips him tight once more. Castiel isn’t sure what Dean will say to him, do to him. If his words had any impact other than igniting the demon’s wrath enough to finally kill him.
The words aren't exactly words, aren't quite spoken, but Castiel hears them anyway, even over the screams of the demon its cornered. A full fledged demon, one that has existed for at least one thousand years, if Castiel can still ascertain things right, and it cowers against the Righteous Man, its form splayed open and oozing, dying, if it were able to really die like this.
Out of the seventeen/eighteen completed chapters of this fic (just hit 50k in the google doc btw! i literally pulled a nanowrimo a month late in less than thirty days on this goddamn thing wtf) this is probably my fave chapter so far? idk what that says about me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The Righteous Man was deep in the Pit. Deeper than what his superiors had assumed, deeper than even the Seraphs in the garrison could get to.
“We need to work on the next seal,” Castiel says instead. He puts his hands on Dean’s shoulders and pushes him back. Dean thinks about putting his strength into it, making Castiel squirm when he realizes he can't actually move him - but Castiel jerks him back harsher than either of them are expecting. Dean straightens up and frowns.
Every time I write John I'm just like. Am I doing this right?? Ironically all my familial trauma stems from my older brother so believe me when I say I'm foaming at the mouth for some weird Sam and Dean emotional issues to come to the surface later in this story.
At night he’s started to have dreams. Mostly normal, except for a shadowy figure lurking somewhere out of reach. Watching like a voyeur. It might be getting closer, but Dean’s not sure.
“Do you?” It’s not an answer. Dean turns back in his seat. Peels at the label, watching the glue barely put up a fight under the insistence of his fingernails.
"Uh, you think," he swallows, tongue feeling too big in his mouth. "The - we can -" he glances at the clock. It's too late to go out anywhere in a town this tiny. The case Cas was on here is finished, anyway. He's stuck here. Cas puts a hand on his cheek. His eyes are dark in the dim lighting.
Also this shouldn't affect the updates BUT I think I literally gave myself tendonitis from writing *checks google doc* uhh... 70k in six weeks? Plus the typing I do for my desk job. So if my responses to your comments are brief that's why!
Cas makes a noise and sits up, stretches. Dean watches his silhouette as he goes into the bathroom, turns the shower on. He leaves the door open, not so much an invitation but just a sign that Dean can be there, if he wants, in the same room that’s slowly growing humid.
*Dean's quip about tuning in on NBC refers to Dateline NBC, which showcases a lot of grisly true crime cases.
“We found a clue to the case. He shouldn’t have gotten upset with you because he found out about a detail two hours later than he wanted.”
“If you really wanted me to,” Dean scoffs and sits down next to Cas, watching the dark clothes go ‘round and ‘round, the rhythmic pounding of the washers soothing him enough to close his eyes.
They plan on tracking down Anna’s Grace, and she, a pragmatist at heart, tells them more information regarding the seals. Dean’s cell phone rings. “Who’s that?” he asks, staring at the unfamiliar contact on the screen.
Castiel did not waste precious time and energy thinking if he would survive, if he or any other in his army would succeed.
“That’s just about anywhere, Cas, a mountain doesn’t make it special.” There’s a lot of nasty stuff in the trunk, and Dean can’t touch all of it without getting hurt. His fault for taking it from Sam in a hurry. He makes Castiel hold some of the weapons and talismans while he grabs the spare.
He pauses by the bar. He can hear some other people tittering around him, the music blaring from the old sound system on the other side of the building, the sound of billiards clacking. He doesn’t hear what she’s telling Cas, but then his smile gets wider. Turns into a grin that makes his eyes crinkle. Dean takes a breath.
“Alright, cool.” Dean pats his shoulder and moves away. “Meet me out front in five with Beth, we can just go together. I don’t want you driving, anyway.”
He stands still, waiting to see if John will say anything else. His dad turns back to the books. “Get going. You’re burning daylight.”
and thus this story was born. I have quite a bit more written so if you're interested leave a comment! I'd love to see if others would like to read this, I honestly haven't been in the spn fandom since season eight so apologies to things such as: canon? continuity? getting information from sources besides the spn wiki?
he tells him, before pushing him down, insistent enough that his brother reluctantly follows, and Dean gasps at the surface of this new body.
This summer is weird. Uniquely weird, for someone like Dean. He and Cas are attached at the hip for most of it, and they’ve been doing a lazy, looping tour of the continental US as May bleeds into June, July, August. They started at the Canadian border and steadily worked their way down. Maybe next month they’ll hit Mexico.
Dean reaches over and claps him on the shoulder. "Alright, well. Your morality compass seems to be in check to me."
He isn’t sure what Cas says, but they don’t come over when he brings back their drinks. Dean tips the new bottle back and doesn’t taste anything, can’t. And Cas is unbothered because. He’s always unbothered.
down the road. And then with this monster or - whatever it is. Every family we talked to said the victims were hearing things before they died, and some of them had to just go to that institute.”
Dean had been kind of hoping the demon creeping up behind the angel would’ve sunken that nasty looking blade into its meatsuit, but the angel turns around at the last second and stabs it, ends its existence right there.
He gets the computer after she leaves, and her number, too. He texts Cas they have to get lunch on a different day.
in the player and music starts rolling in. “She’s weird, but in a good way, you know? Experimental, and not as angry-sounding as Alanis Morrissette, so you can actually chill out and listen to her.” Cas agrees. “Okay, now that we have
It’s different like this, more of what Dean’s used to. He falls against Cas and clings tight, ignores what they saw that night, what else is outside the walls of their room. Cas holds him, panting into his ear. His leg hitches up around Dean’s hip when he comes like he can’t bear to untwine himself from Dean and Dean - lets him. Wants to stay right here, forever. Always.
He undresses right there in the bedroom with Castiel watching him, always watching him, like he can’t bear to look away.
"If they are, they haven't found me yet." Cas worries his lip for a moment. "The city I woke up in… there's a man there who looks like me. I ran across him on accident."
As another fun note, can someone tell me why adipocere is one of thee hardest words to spell? It is also known as corpse wax - shoutout to my junior year forensics class that traumatized me more than any true crime podcast ever could :)
They’re getting breakfast before they leave when Dean looks up at him. “Huh?” he asks, mouth full of bacon.
They ease down the basement steps without being heard. There’s an ominous, unnatural wind blowing through the room, whipping his jacket around and blowing Cas’s dark hair into a messy flurry of strands that frame his face.
“I guess I am,” Cas offers. When the bartender passes them each a green bottle, Dean holds his up. Cas mirrors the motion until Dean leans over and clinks it together. He takes a long pull, and Cas watches the line of his neck. There’s a swipe of grave dirt smudged low along his collarbone.
* Jess mentioning the fourth wave refers to different waves of feminism/gender theory, with the current being the third wave.
*So! This is my Route 666 rewrite, aka the first of many crimes bucklemming must answer to when they finally shuck this mortal coil. Warnings for talk of racism/hate crimes and I don't know how many readers may just not want to revisit this episode in any way? I think it offers something in terms of character work but plot-wise you can skip this chapter and not lose anything of the overarching story, promise.
“I had ample time to… study your form,” Cas explains, serene. Dean flows into it, simple and easy, and Cas seals him inside. Dean hopes, distantly, third time’s the charm.
Castiel recalls Anna as being an expert tactician, organized and unflappable - but part of her magnificence in battle was her ingenuity, her curiosity that led to new tactics. So he is only slightly surprised when she nods.
**The talking mongoose was an alleged Tulpa from the 1930s named Gef that did have a 2002 article written about him in the Skeptical Inquirer :)
“Nah.” Dean fiddles with the ring on his finger, spins it around his knuckle. “Dropped him off at a bus station and uh. That was it. He and dad argued, you know. Real bad. About him leaving us and everything. Kind of ruined the whole thing. So, uh. Yeah.” He coughs. “Dad apparently swings up there once in a while, to check in on him. Not that Sammy knows that.”
It’s the amulet. Sam kept it all this time. Dean watches as he puts it around his own neck, tucks it under his clothes.
Castiel stares at him, eyes so blue they’re electric, like neon lights, like a flash of lightning, like the impassive, unstoppable force of elements, joining and separating and colliding until the heat death of the universe. “Don’t you think it could be worth investigating?”
They finish up the hunt in Nevada and hop over one state to Arizona. It’s so hot Cas feels like he can’t breathe. Not that he needs to, he thinks bitterly, but he
Castiel steps closer, and though his form is smaller than Sam’s, Dean watches his brother swallow, tight. “She failed you
“Good, that’s good.” He still hasn’t called Ellen. He’s thought about it, but figures he’d want a proper reason before reaching out. There was probably bad blood between her and John, and he didn’t need to get pulled into it if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. “Hey, I need to start doing some research, but uh, you wanna get lunch in a few hours, catch up or whatever?”
Sam used the rings, and the ground around them sink and disintegrates as Dean spills out of his own body. A weakened Michael and disoriented Lucifer try to move, to get away.
idk what the reader opinion on this chapter is going to be tbh so lmk! I know drug/alcohol use and sex together can produce different interpretations? I kind of based this on my own experiences which were luckily positive and with friends but I know that not everyone has had the same stuff happen to them!
"Okay, not that I'm even entertaining that crackpot theory, but how would that even work, Cassie? I like women," He feels his face turning red, sweat creeping down his neck.
Cas digs out a best of Queen tape, and Dean’s eyes go soft around the corners. “Like you read my mind,” he says, feeding it into the slot.
“Nah,” he says, tossing over a fake credit card. He wonders, idly, if the people he scams ever get into arguments from his random purchases. If next week ol’ Harry Sunderland is going to get into a fight with his wife when she opens the statement and realizes he spent money on cigarettes, candy, and condoms somewhere two hundred miles from them. “Have a good night,” he says.
again, like someone whispering both next to his head and in another room. It’s close and indistinct. Fucking annoying. He wonders if it’s some type of tinnitus. One too many shots let off in close range. Figures he’d go crazy because of his fucked up ears instead of going down in a blaze of glory.
He groans, curling up into himself. He has an idea, likes it only slightly more than talking to his dad.
“I had an extra set laying around,” Dean says, looking away. Cas leans forward, hooks his chin over Dean's shoulder, puts arms around Dean's middle.
Anyway! That was the Kuri/'dean n' cas go hunting and dean almost dies' story arc! Tune in on Thursday when we start the next arc of: what the fuck is cas, actually?
“What’s wrong with Metallica?” He gets closer to her and starts poking through the albums. She lets him.
"You like him, don't you?" one of them asks. She’s been dancing against him and he’s been standing there in order to make sure no one bothers her, as Dean had explained to him once. She's pointing at where Dean and Cassie are wrapped up close to each other. Dean's hand in his girlfriend's hair as they whisper together and kiss and swap back and forth while moving on the dance floor of the bar they’re in.
“Hello?” he answers, gruff. His expression goes a bit nauseous, and slowly, he holds the phone out. “It’s for you,” he tells Castiel.
ANYWAY - Meg!! Whom we have actually met before without realizing. According to The Lore, Meg Masters was possessed around the time of the pilot, so in s0, she wouldn't have had that current vessel. I love her v much and she was SO fun to write. Especially when antagonizing Cas. They're worsties <3
"No. I don't know. It's just." Cas sighs. "Why can't I remember anything? All the articles I've read about amnesia suggest it's short term. Eventually stuff
“I’ve heard of it before,” he mutters, abandoning his stuttered attempts at pacing to finally sit on the edge of the lone motel mattress. “It has quite a lot to say about demons. How they’re made and operate.”
“Another text. I know it’s a shapeshifter, but looking at the possible crimes they’ve committed, it might be a family of them. What about you?”
“Sam's an adult. He can look away if he wants to,” Dean snarks, but he pulls back and works on getting Cas to his feet. The earth swallowed up where Lucifer and Michael had gone, where Adam and Dean’s empty body now reside. Now there’s only a large circle of deadened grass to prove there was anything there at all. The three of them stare at it.
at him. He had said he was cool with it, you know, don’t ask don’t tell, right? And then he had work, and then he had to talk with John and then he was here, and he had been so ready to never think about
fall down and show a bit more skin than what’s already there, and she’s talking to him about whatever, and it’s making Cas’s mouth quirk up in a way that he only shows when Dean’s done something, said something, to get a reaction from him.
“Castiel,” Uriel greets first, before glancing at Anna. “Working with the broken who’d rather be a part of this class of mud monkeys, and… Dean Winchester.” He grimaces. “What a disgusting sight you make.”
“Something’s on your mind,” Cas says, when the only light left is just what’s being reflected off the lapping waves.
In his hand there’s a wisp of Grace, and on the floor, with the wreckage of the motel around him, is Cas.
Dean sucks his teeth, tired mind struggling to think of options. He’s slumped against Cas, cool air on his feverish skin. The air conditioning unit is rattling on one side, Cas breathing on his other. For a moment, he can trick himself into thinking he’s okay.
“Castiel,” his brother spits, “Dean was just telling me some interesting information. Like how apparently the angels were supposed to save him before he
Also thank you all so much for the car suggestions for Cas! I went with a Honda Civic because a hatchback isn't conducive to hiding hunting paraphernalia, the Honda Civic apparently is pretty spacious for a coupe, and it was just nerdy looking enough without being too cool or too nerdy. But whatever car you want Cas to drive, I'd say just imagine that's what he gets when the Honda unexpectedly konks out a decade from now or something lmao.
***The Isabella Gardner museum is a fine arts museum in Boston that lost multiple famous and expensive works in an art heist in 1990. Dean is not into art, but I think art heists are cool enough and that was a big enough deal at the time that he'd remember it.
I know a LOT of you wanted to see a proper rewrite of Phantom Traveler so that one obviously needed top billing - for those of you sad that Dean's not on the plane, I feel you. I just felt this was a better way for the story beats to play out. I also know some other readers are sad that Dean and Cas can't be out boyfriends so every time I passed this over to edit it I tried to add some coupley things, or you know, a Gilligan cut that makes me laugh every time I read it back.
“Cas, hey, Cas.” Dean slings an arm around his shoulder once Beth leaves to go to the bathroom. “Can’t believe you’re still standing, man, you really packed those shots away, huh?” Cas shrugs. “Cassie and I were gonna head back to her place. How are you and Beth doing?”
Cas just smells clean, like Dean's stuff and store brand laundry detergent. Cas is kissing him, hand stroking through his hair, down the back of his neck, no real pressure, he could break away if he wants to. Dean tries to relax into it, thinks he almost does, when the hand on his stomach goes to the front of his underwear. That's when he stills, abdomen clenching.
“What about,” Cas says, “with me instead?” Dean doesn’t get it, sweaty, panting, half-hard, until he does. He  waits for the pressure to run down his spine, waits to freeze, waits to disappoint Cas.
So! This is a pivotal moment. To be honest I think Dean and Cas could've done this pining dance until the end of my story - but the tag 'maybe if Dean got a boyfriend he would've calmed down' is actually a vital plot point and wasn't an exaggeration at all ;)
They’re another five minutes away when Cas says, out of nowhere, “they’re not you.” Dean’s steps falter, but he doesn’t dare ask Cas to repeat himself. A moment later he adds, “none of them are.” It’s too dark, but Dean is sure Cas is looking at him, head turned back to meet his gaze.
John slams the lid of the box shut. “Damnit, Dean, you can’t just ‘let things’ jog your memory. Were you even paying attention when you interviewed her?”
“Then I fix it,” Dean says. Simple as that. Cas doesn’t say anything else. But he watches Dean’s hands, how he’s able to detangle the wires, unscrew panels and replace old parts with new. He tries to pay attention, really wants to learn, but then Dean starts talking, again.
“Uh. Yeah. His name’s Sam. He’s younger than me. Pain in the ass.” Dean chews on his lip. “He uh, the hunting life didn’t really agree with him. He got a full ride and decided to strike it out on his own.”
Denise went to UCLA. Which meant that she probably wasn’t sneaking back to her home town on a whim to help Heather and Cheryl do… whatever it is that they wanted to do.
Dean buys Cas a new disposable camera. "Fucking price gouging," he says, ripping through the packaging and handing it over.
“You don’t even know how a car works! How are you supposed to fix it?” Castiel furrows his eyebrows, squints a little. This new body of his likes to do that - Dean’s not sure how much of it is the angel and how much the vessel, which may or may not still be kicking around inside. “Magic on Baby? Not on your life,” he insists, dark. Castiel steps back and lets Dean finish getting the spare on.
Dean thinks about that morning. He was pushing back a headache and he and Cas were laughing and then - then they weren’t laughing. And Cas was
They get back to the road once it’s dark out. Find the body and Dean’s axe. They salt and burn the bones. No specter comes out to attack them for it, and they don’t suddenly go insane, either.
They burn the remains to not give the locals any ideas, and drive off into the night. Dean feels blood crusting under his fingernails, his shoulder pulling from where one of the things pinned him down, just before John shot it.
He bites his lip. Slowly sits down in the other chair at the table. Puts the papers on the cheap plastic top, spread out. “Okay,” he says, “what do you think happened?”
“We talked about trying to expand our tastes in media to listen to voices beyond the patriarchal system that favors White male mediocrity.” He thinks. “We did say Weezer is still pretty good, though.”
John made friends with the owner, which wasn’t that strange in hindsight, considering he and his brother probably weren’t allowed in the half of the building that didn’t have crane machines and cheap plastic prizes to win, and he’s dragged inside.
The bar has bad lighting and worse drinks. Dean nurses a domestic while he plays pool, acts drunk and inexperienced so he can funnel in some easy cash. When he pulls his head out of the game he realizes Cas isn’t where he left him at one of the nearby tables.
“I guess.” Dean thinks about their phone call that started this whole mess, and he turns the bend sharper then he means to.
You guys don't want to know how many times I'll just add a whole ass scene in the AO3 window right before posting lol - anyway! Up next is a Dean girl classic: Dead in the Water.
“Going off the deep end you’ll have to kill us, blah blah blah. Doesn’t stopping the end of the world with my favorite little brother get me a free pass?” Sam's glare is answer enough.
Dean meanders closer, and drops Castiel’s Grace. It melds back into him, and he can think clearly, without being in so much pain.
"- Your stupid instructions will be useless.” He yanks out another wire that has Cas glancing towards the wheel, just to triple check the keys aren’t in the ignition.
Cas manages to kneel, brush bits of ceiling and sawdust from his hair. “You destroyed them,” he says, almost regretful.
Cas kisses him and heals him in one fell swoop. They stay like that until the metal at Dean’s back grows warm.
"Thanks." He heads back to his car, flips open the book until he finds pages depicting Illinois. He traces his fingers over state routes and highways, moving east. Connecticut, Bozrah. Bingo.
Dean scoffs. “So the next time someone decides they have a hard-on for you, I’m not running all over this plane of existence trying to figure out where you went.”
“But what if…” He bites his lip. Dean is already focusing on the mechanics behind the radio. “What if it breaks again?”
Lastly most of the references in this chapter seemed to be for my friend Laura, who I met through a forever unfinished destiel fic I put out when we were both in high school and since then we've remained in contact and she gets to hear me rant about this fic over the phone approximately bi-weekly. :)
Cas hums, and grabs at Dean's drink. It must be a testament to how grateful he is that Cas didn't bring up the
“You’re losing blood,” Cas tells him. He pants, looking down at the crumbled remains of the male Vetala. He slashed at its counterpart that was holding him back so he could get to Cas, and her ashes are somewhere behind him. Maybe. Who knows. Who cares.
“You think it’s weird that we’re the only ones not studying anything?” Dean asks, startling Cas from his thoughts. There’s a bench in one corner that they've commandeered. It gives them a vantage point of students laying out on the grass or walking to class. Dean says he likes the people watching. Cas likes the birds that periodically perch on the edge of a nearby fountain.
“It’s part of the job,” Dean says, heart not really in it. Cas kisses him, then again, and again, and as much as Dean doesn’t want to think about it, the image of the shapeshifter wearing Cas’s face, that small, secret smile turned into a malicious smirk, is still burned into his mind. He presses close enough to Cas like if he just edges closer it’ll be erased, but that doesn’t work. Instead it makes him think of that crocotta they fought that took Cas's voice, the random civilian that had the same dark-hair-blue-eyes that got killed by a spirit. Hunts that didn't end with Cas dead but remind him it's always possible, for as indestructible as Cas appears.
Setting a SPN fic before season 1 is great actually because all the minor/recurring characters that wind up dead in the show actually aren't at this point, so I don't have to create too many OCs. Isaac and Tamara were from 3.01 and tbh I'm kind of bummed we don't run into Tamara after that. Also I apparently didn't know how to spell Isaac until five minutes before I posted this.
“Come on, get some water in ya before you pass out.” He waves another bottle at Cas and starts walking towards him. Halfway through he stumbles over something, glances down. “Uh, Cas?”
We're actually getting into a story arc! Albeit just one in two parts, but it's still Important. Also y'all remember Cassie? I cannot BELIEVE we only got her and Dean for one episode... au where season six had Dean going back to Cassie... would've been iconic.
He ends up driving into the northeast. It's as good a guess as any, he supposes. He's at a gas station in Pennsylvania somewhere when his phone buzzes.
Hell corrupts, slow or swift, depending on the soul, and its placement in hell. The deeper one goes, the faster the transformation can happen. And Dean Winchester has found himself very deep indeed.
doing anything, and there’s nothing to defend. Cas has met Cassie before, so he smiles and talks to her for a minute, asking about her class and the paper she’s working at. Dean watches their back and forth like a tennis match until Cas gets up and tells them he’ll see them around.
Castiel watches him as he works, big blue eyes that don’t quite know when to blink, when to look away. Castiel didn’t have much of a form in the Pit - bright and ever-shifting, things that could be eyes or limbs or a voice. But he would do this down there, too. Perceive Dean until the demon had no choice but to go,
They don’t make any other big stops on the way. It’s mostly business. A ghost in Wyoming, some banshee in Oklahoma. They ride through Austin on their way to a haunting in Corpus Christi and Dean pulls up to some strange sculpture made up of junk, sprawling and glittering in the summer sun. Cas gets a new disposable camera at a gas station across the road and takes a picture. Maybe he can put it in his journal.
i wrote most of this super late at night, read it through the next day and went: wow! this hurt my feelings :)
Lucifer can read a demon’s mind easier than most, but like Cas had told him - it was a labyrinth. Hidden passageways, looping corridors, more than a few monsters dotting the path. He just needs a handful of seconds, really, and Sam catching his own meatsuit in the chest with some consecrated buckshot is enough of a nuisance to work.
Faith *jumps* part two!! I don't think when I wrote the first Faith rewrite I was going to come back to this, or at least, I wasn't 100% sure, but as more of s1 was written out I realized it would've been interesting to see how this story looked if it was allowed to operate for months longer than originally planned. Also I think Cas accidentally wandering into 'semi-famous' status and balking at it is pretty funny, even if the rest of this chapter isn't. Lastly, I am SO sorry we're not doing a full rewrite of Provenance - it was one of my other fave episodes in the season! But looking at it within the scope of the timeline and such I didn't think it would really do much for Cas or Dean's character arcs. Maybe we'll get more detail of it in Jess's POV?
** Dean's comment about getting shipped off to 'some delinquent place' is a reference to the s9 episode Bad Boys where that did happen and Dean and John never told Sam the story of how he landed in a boys home?? Hm, gives me brain damage. Some of the late season canon stuff can get wonky, but I think Dean getting picked up for juvie or something similar would've fit well enough.
Cassie calls him one night asking if he’s free and he tells her he’s on his way to meet Cas for some drinks, says she can always come along if she wants.
been a higher class than Uriel. “What does she matter? She has no Grace, we can’t even begin to guess where -” Uriel reaches under the collar of his shirt and displays a glowing vial. Of course.
Castiel holds his gaze, never backing down, like always. Dean had always cut himself off at the pass when he was a human, never let himself linger on any guys passing by. It wasn’t what a real man did, it wasn’t something John would approve of. Well, now he’s not exactly a real man, and John’s long gone, and Cas’s human vessel is just his type.
She puts her hands up defensively. "I'm just saying, Dean! I know you probably didn't grow up in places were people were out and proud, but it's better here, you know? College towns are like that."
Dean, deep, deep inside, Dean watches Cas gasp and claw at his skin in vain. It's a slow death, a painful, bloody one as Cas's stolen Grace ekes out of him, then his soon-to-be human blood.
Demons and angels, they were blasé at this point. He’s killed scores of him to save his skin, to get info, or just for fun. Most of them hardly register. Dean feels a throb in his skull now, a twisted feeling like his guts are about to be ripped out.
“How you feeling?” he asks Castiel. The wings are burned on the bedspread, the carpet. Dean takes Uriel’s bloodied angel blade, examines it.
“Now, do it!” His brother sets to work, and Dean has just enough wherewithal to stumble back towards Michael. He falls to his knees, Michael’s steely gaze looking at him from behind his half-brother’s eyes.
Castiel turns to look at him as well, and Dean looks away abruptly. He casts his eyes down to look at Miracle, a safe place to look, willing away the strange panic that flashed through him. “Uh, yeah, of course,” he says.
“You don’t suppose we could have just one day without something happening, do you?” Dean says, as they approach the door. “Who the hell do you think it is this time?”
Adam hasn’t been separate from Michael for over a decade. He can’t quite figure out how to decide anything without Michael there to talk to.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. Talking about emotions has never been his speciality. He barely even understands what he’s feeling half the time, how the hell is he supposed to explain it to someone else? “Cas, I-“ Dean stops again, still at a loss for words. How does he tell Cas what he means to him? How does he even begin to explain the cavern that opened in his chest when he thought Cas was gone forever? How does he-
,” Sam says, with a wide smile and fond eyes. He pulls Castiel into a firm hug, then gestures him inside. As Sam relocks the door, he remarks, “Should’ve known better, though. Winchesters never stay gone, after all.”
He still misses Jack, so he takes off occasionally to assist Jack with restructuring Heaven, but he never stays gone for long. He sees the way Dean’s jaw clenches and his smile disappears every time Cas leaves, like he’s convinced that Cas isn’t going to come back. It makes Cas’ chest hurt.
He knows he could be doing more to help up in Heaven, but he can’t quite bring himself to care. Castiel is tired of feeling like the entire fate of Heaven rests on his shoulders, just because he can’t trust any of his brothers and sisters to behave themselves. He’s tired of being manipulated, and taken advantage of, and screwing things up horribly and being blamed, and killing his beloved siblings for the sake of the world. He’s tired of fighting with Sam and Dean about the right way to save the day, just for them all to be wrong anyway. Castiel wants to relax for once, and spend time doing the very thing that first made him rebel – hanging out with Sam and Dean.
When Cas first showed up and Dean kept staring at him, Sam had figured that Dean was having trouble believing he was really back. They’d been through a lot in a short period of time, after all, and Sam himself had been having trouble believing it was all really over.
Dean already said- but if Cas meant it platonically, then he’d just think Dean meant it the same way, surely. They could just continue on as they had been.
He forced himself to quit following Cas around and starting inane conversations, forced himself to shove down the flutter of anxious excitement he felt when Cas looked at him, forced himself to pat Cas on the back perhaps a little too forcefully, and forced himself to ignore the way Cas’ warmth seemed to linger on his hand afterwards.
Sam’s head turns just enough for him to briefly lock eyes with Dean, before turning back to watch their destination with careful eyes. Miracle goes straight to the door and paws at it, blissfully ignorant of the brothers’ concern.
Sam exhales out a laugh. “Come on, man. Like you don’t already know you’re family to us.” He raises his eyebrows. “
“I most certainly do not love you like a brother, but I do love you as a friend. Did you…” Dean feels Cas’ hands shift and falter, as if Cas was considering removing them from Dean’s face. Cas continues, softly, “…Is that what you meant, when you said
Cas smiles, a little regretfully, and lowers his hands from Dean’s face. “Yes, Dean. Albatrosses mate for life, and that is what I wish to do with you. I would like nothing more than to devote the rest of my life to staying by your side.”
Look at that, personal growth. Bobby would be proud. He orders a slice of banana cream pie and splits it with Cas.
Meanwhile, Cas is setting up a complex irrigation network that weaves from plot to plot. He’s checking his phone a lot as he works, and Dean would bet the rims on his car that there’s a spreadsheet involved.
, and then Cas comes. He spills all over Dean’s dick, come dripping off Dean’s fingers, and it’s too fucking hot, a sensory overload. With Cas’ come slicking the way, it’s impossible to hold back. He gets his ankles hooked around Cas’ ass, holding him in place until Dean’s gasping and coming too. Cas smiles down at him, then slips his fingers out of the clutch of Dean’s body. He gently dislodges the grip of Dean’s legs around his hips, and collapses on his back beside him.
, Cas had said, when Dean had complained about helping haul lumber all the way up to the roof rather than to the perfectly usable stretch of bare dirt available at ground level.
“I don’t know how we’re going to protect the beans, Dean - the trellises are ten feet high! How have your kind coped with the recent extreme fluctuations in regional weather patterns? Clearly, your people should have listened to Al Gore when they had a chance, then maybe we wouldn’t be in this disastrous situation.”
“I’ll talk to Jack. Maybe we can amend the terms without compromising the goals of the agreement,” Cas says, thumbing over his cheek like he’s made of glass rather than scarred skin over broken and mended bones. “More miraculous things have happened, after all. It won’t even be the first time I’ve negotiated for my own resurrection.”
He takes Cas into his mouth, deep, tongue pressed to the underside, hollowing his cheeks to suck on the withdrawal. He sets a slow push-pull pace with one hand on the jut of Cas’ hip, the other on his ass, fucking Cas into his mouth.
“I’ll be damned.” The guy fills in the letters, and grins at him. “Just for that, I’ll upgrade ya to a jacuzzi suite.”
Then Sam is there too, his arms wrapped around the both of them. They’re blocking the flow of pedestrians, three grown men holding each other in the middle of the sidewalk. But Cas can’t find it within himself to care.
At the U-Haul counter, Cas uses one of his IDs to check out the truck. The Steve one, from his Gas n’ Sip days. His Steve persona hasn’t officially been wanted by the F.B.I. or legally dead more than once yet, putting him a few notches ahead of Dean on the ability-to-rent-a-vehicle front. They add on some tie-downs, furniture pads, and a dolly for good measure. Cas puts his foot down at the boxes.
Sam wins at a rigged sharp-shooter game to the surprise of no one but the unsuspecting attendant, scoring an absurdly huge, neon pink panda for Eileen on his first try. She makes Sam haul it around under his arm for no other reason than pure, trollish delight. Dean loves her, and wins her a cartoonishly garish tiara at a dart throwing game to show it.
“Yeah, uh, it never bothered me as much as I said it did. Kind of drove me nuts when you weren’t looking at me, to be honest.”
Dean smiles. "I’m also gonna go out on a limb here and say we both aren’t quite ready to head home yet.”
“That was good for me,” Cas says, shifting backwards into a sinuous stretch. Child’s pose, Sam had called it once during one of his yoga phases.
“Can’t say that I have,” Dean says, eyeballing the row of vacuums on his left. Jack brought home a Persian rug from a flea market in Kansas City a couple weeks back and set it up under the map table. They need a way to clean it properly. Something with a hose attachment too, maybe, to get the dust that settles on top of the kitchen cupboards and sets off his allergies.
“No, what the hell. Why would I - it doesn’t matter if she...it’s fine.” Dean shrugs, convincing no one, least of all himself.
- were busy getting invaded in the British Isles,” Cas cuts himself off with a barely detectable hiccup. “I was watching the algebra.”
, though? Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to take candy from strangers? Or fruit from unknown supernatural entities?”
Cas drives the next leg through central Illinois, past sun-faded billboards denouncing abortion and handmade election signs for 1980's presidential candidates. In time-honored tradition, Dean lets him pick the music.
“Number one, daddy issues, obviously. Ain’t no use denying. Number two -” Dean waves a hand vaguely at their refined environs. “An appreciation for the finer things. Number three, like you said. Ride or die. Pie or die. Whatever. You get it. I’m gonna eat now.”
He lifts his hips to pull almost all the way off, with Cas mindlessly kissing at any skin he can reach with next to no mobility. The long slide back inside is worth the strain on his tired knees. He repeats the motion until he can’t take it anymore, until he has to get a hand on his dick.
"Okay, so, what about you?" Dean asks, grateful for the back-and-forth nature of this to give him a break from baring his soul.
“Uh, before that.” Dean glances at him, swallows. “I sat on that fucking floor all night. Ignored Sam’s calls.”
Cas wades backwards toward the shore, the lizard-monster-thing following closely and making Dean thoroughly nervous. He fidgets with the gun at his hip, ready in case anything goes pear-shaped.
"What about a burger though?" Dean goes on. "I deserve a burger. I dug up a goddamn grave yesterday!"
“Totally pragmatic,” Dean says, teasing at the edge of Cas’ boxers, some ridiculously cheap polyester things that Dean is horrified to admit might be the only pair of underwear Cas owns.
Cas chooses that moment to lean across the space between them, one hand on Dean’s shoulder and the other on the side of his face as he kisses him so, so softly. Dean is hardly better prepared for it than last time, and he entirely forgets to breathe at the appropriate intervals. He’s leaning forward so dramatically that he nearly faceplants off the bed when Cas’ lips moves to his neck - where did he learn that, oh right, rebuilt him at the atomic level, he knows things no one knows. He needs - he
There’s a diner in Salina that makes a good plate of biscuits and gravy, so Dean waits in their parking lot until they open at 6:00. The waitress has to be in her 70’s, and she pats Dean’s hand after she takes his order: the biscuits, and a fruit cup. He meant what he said to Jack about taking care of himself, even if some honeydew and canned pineapple aren’t going to make much of a dent in the decades of burgers and beer he’s tossed back.
Cas opens his mouth to protest, so Dean cuts him off. “And no, before you give me that bit about my ancestors sleeping on a pile of boulders under the stars while your ageless ass watched over them from a gnarled sycamore tree or whatever the fuck, spare me. I need a bed.”
"Exactly as you would expect. Dinner with his family, making a difference in the life of a child - those sorts of things. He had an enviable clarity of purpose."
Dean had been thinking of Cas’ last words as a confession, but all of a sudden Dean realizes that Cas probably just meant a platonic sort of love. It would just be embarrassing if Dean tried anything now. After all, people don’t fall in love with Dean. He’s not made for it.
Slowly, Adam unfolds his wallet and begins flipping through the cash. Rather than the handful of twenties he remembers, the wallet is filled to bursting with fifties and hundreds – and, curiously, a little piece of plain white paper.
Sam and Dean have been through a lot. It feels good to complain about ‘hipster’ salad, as if some kale is the biggest enemy they’ve ever faced.
Dean and Sam definitely know what they want, and they’re very strong-willed. Adam wants to sort out his own head and his own wants before going to see his weird half-brothers, so that he doesn’t just turn into their pushover little brother.
Dean is sitting on his bed, holding a beer in one hand and petting Miracle with the other, when he hears a knock at the bunker door. Miracle’s ears perk up and he trots out of the room towards the noise, as Dean cautiously places his beer down, grabs his gun, and follows. As he rounds the corner, he catches sight of Sam, gun in his hands, equally hesitantly heading towards the door.
sake, he hopes it was just the shock. He really doesn’t want to have to talk to his own older brother about homophobia.
“I was hoping, now that I’m alive again, that…“ Cas’ eyes dart back and forth between Dean’s, searching. His voice drops, quieter. “…that we could talk further about what you said to me, just before I was taken to the Empty.”
After Cas was taken to the Empty, Dean clammed up tight and wouldn’t explain to Sam what had happened. Sam eventually figured out that Cas had made some sort of deal for Jack, and that he’d called in that deal at an opportune moment to take Billie with him, but even getting that much detail had ended with Dean lashing out at him and storming off. Wisely, Sam chose not to ask any further questions. He figured it was difficult to watch their friend die – again – and didn’t think any further about it.
Cas opens his mouth to greet them but is interrupted by Miracle bowling into his legs for attention. He looks down, blinking in surprise, and then bends over to pet Miracle, a warm smile back on his face. “I wasn’t expecting a dog,” he says, as he rubs Miracle behind the ear.
“I was hoping to discuss this separately from your brother, but if you would prefer to have Sam here for this conversation, then I suppose I can accommodate that. Dean-“
“Maybe Jack?” Sam offers, speaking low and quiet. “But if it’s him, I don’t know why he’d bother knocking. You got any other guesses?”
“You don’t suppose we could have just one day without something happening, do you?” Dean says, as they approach the door. “Who the hell do you think it is this time?”
“Dean?” Cas’ head cocks to the side, ever so slightly. “If you don’t love me, it’s alright. I won’t mind that you said it. If you do love me, then I love you too. Either way, everything is alright.”
Dean inhales, his eyes searching Cas’ face, and finds nothing but sincerity looking back at him. “Cas, I-“
When Sam turns back around, Castiel’s eyes are a little wide and searching Sam’s face for the meaning of the statement.
The next day, Dean’s heating up a pan on the stove to make breakfast when he reaches into the utensil drawer for a spatula. Instead of his usual, half-melted piece of shit, he finds a brand new one. Silicone with a stainless steel handle.
Dean listens to him move quietly around the room and the sound of his duffel’s zipper opening and closing before Cas settles next to him again.
“So as for what I’d change... I suppose it would be to add critical thinking to the arsenal of requisite angelic skills, rather than obedience. Considering our father’s absence, the course of history would have benefited from the most powerful beings in existence acting as something other than mindless soldiers.”
“Like I said before I’ve loved you since we met. But I’m saying that I didn’t experience what someone could reasonably consider sexual attraction until September 24, 2009.”
“Thanks, buddy,” Dean says, doing his best to accept the compliment without shrugging it off. “How about you?”
“Everything would’ve been different though.” Fewer guns, more baseball and learning to cook and having an actual relationship with a father-figure. “Butterfly effect, and all that.”
Dean drops his empty coffee cup, and it clatters on the formica tabletop. At least it’s plastic. Small mercies.
“It’s mostly better, but my carpentry skills are... non-existent, so I may need some help with replacing the door.”
” Lays him out on the floor, bracketing him in with his knees planted on either side of Dean’s hips, hands on either side of Deans’ head and leaning down to kiss him again. Dean works his hands between them to get at Cas’ shirt, graceless with the buttons until Cas sits back and helps. He goes for Dean’s shirt then, rucking it up and ducking down to mouth along his ribs, tonguing over his chest.
“It’s a haul. Couple days’ drive. Still worth checking out, maybe. Sure as shit wouldn’t need a credit score. And with nothing breathing down our necks, what’s a twenty hour drive even matter?”
“That won’t be necessary -” Cas starts to protest. It’s a very long way from Kansas to the Atlantic coast, after all. He can manage.
to get closer. The solution presents itself and he clambers forward onto Cas’ lap, a hand tight in his hair to bring their mouths back together.
Cas’ hand drifts down his face until he’s cupping his chin tight, keeping him steady. “Dean, I want - there’s something I want...” Cas gasps.
Turns out, they know more people than Dean thought. Summer has given way to fall, and there’s a crowd of maybe sixty guests milling about on the bunker’s roof, sipping on cocktails and bonding over shit like preferred exorcisms and the relative merits of ceramic versus tungsten blades for offing crocottas. Dean tries to get close enough to Kaia and Garth to eavesdrop on their conversation, but all he hears is something about cheesecake and the psychic energy of lunar rocks.
The sun is setting as Cas wades into the river again, his jeans rolled up to the knee. He bends down, hands moving over the surface of the water as he speaks in a low voice that Dean can’t make out.
"Mm. Well, in that case, I was thinking that the purgatory blade you've got hanging on your wall might have the right edge to get a really close shave, especially with the teeth on the end of it. Kitsune, was it? Or Shtriga?"
“Okay. Alright,” Sam says, the tone of his voice well-suited to either a crisis or a miracle. “Are you good to drive, want one of us to come get you?”
“Aw, shucks,” Dean demurs, face heating as he thinks of a veritable laundry list of names. Who the hell knows what they saw in him, but he can’t argue with facts. “So what’s your place in all this?”
Dean laughs. “What, you want me to retire? The two of us can get a cabin in Wisconsin, do some fishing...”
“I’ve come to raise you from perdition,” he tells him. Dean Winchester looms closer, and Castiel feels something he hasn’t dared to let enter his mind during his tenure down below: doubt.
busy making engraved armor or some shit and broke me out too late. I was supposed to stay human, come back right away.” Sam stares at him. “You learn a lot of fun stuff in hell, Sam. And heaven, too, if you can get someone's ear. And do you know what the big picture is? Really? It's that heaven
I think this chapter is my longest one to date, oops. Many things happen in it, most notably - John returning, Bela returning, and we finally find the author of the magical text Cas has been searching for! Although in my mind this is the 'Cas learns the painful lesson that not every woman he meets will be his friend' chapter. Sorry bud :(
He reaches out and swipes at them, sucks them dry until they’re withered cells of fragmented power. He condenses them even more, hears them scream and shriek for help that doesn’t come until they’re snuffed out entirely. Esper and Ion and Nathaniel, gone. It’s what they get, he thinks, for trying to take what’s his.
“Why not just kill her?” Dean asks. “No Grace, no real way to fight back. You must have all the same info she has. What do the angels want with her?”
“It’s true! You’re just jealous! You’re so fucking obsessed that you brought me back to life just to control me! Just - just let me go before I do it for you.”
They get separated eventually. Dean isn't concerned - he's used to the particular flavor of Castiel, in between the demons, angels, and humans tossed into the mix. They're close. He just has to get through the wall of demons and things will be fine.
“Yeah, even if they were young and perfectly healthy before. It’s like they just - went crazy and gave up.”
They keep their heads down, searching for anything strange. The wide open space of the plains makes the world shrink down to just the two of them. When Cas looks up to stretch his neck it feels like he can look out all the way to the west coast, the air shimmering from the heat the road gives off until Cas swears he sees the Pacific off in the distance.
hey besties, we are back to some metaphysical nonsense and also acknowledging that cas is a peach <3 - enjoy!
He realizes it’s not John’s friend like he thought. “Okay, I guess. Told me to get my ass over to Minneapolis for a case.” He sucks his teeth. “Said I should watch myself around you.”
There is one time, though. It was a little after the fourth of July and they’re in Minnesota and dad wanted to pull over to a town called New Canton to ‘check on something’. Dean remembers going to middle school here, maybe seventh grade. He and Sam spent way too much time and money at a rinky-dink arcade and pool hall half a mile from school where Dean actually started to get good at playing. He only remembers the place because he had gotten his nose broken for the first time after winning against a group of drunk college kids home for Thanksgiving break.
Dean edges along the perimeter of the room, gun trained on Cheryl. As he gets closer to Heather he peers into the open freezer. He sees ice crystals stained red, denim and plaid curled up. Guess their parents weren’t in Paris after all.
Cas is in his underwear, resting an open Terry Pratchett novel on his crossed legs. He’s watching Dean. “You’re tired.”
Cas does, and the white-blue light slides inside him, eager to find a new home. He swallows it down and doesn’t say a word, just holds Dean’s gaze, as if waiting for more instructions.
“Do you ever think about that?” He shrugs, regretting the train of thought already. They were in Sioux Falls for the past week, which meant eating home cooked meals with Pamela and sleeping in an actual bed, a library of occult research all in one place, somewhere they could put their clothes in a closet, if they wanted to. “…Maybe,” Cas says, eventually, “if it wasn’t just me there.”
“I don’t think I actually require -” Cas starts, as Dean shucks his clothes for him and tosses them into the laundromat’s washer.
Despite it all, Sam’s still level-headed enough to back down. “You really trust… him?” Sam asks. Dean can hear how close his brother was to saying ‘that’ instead.
listen, and remembers, too. Cas can tell Dean, in between research or directing him through a particularly nasty stretch of interstate, that he wants to try catfish, and Dean would pull over to a hole-in-the-wall diner by the water the next time they went south of Kentucky. He wouldn’t
"Fuckin' nerd." He digs in his pockets again and finds his keys this time. He shakily unlocks the door. "I call backseat." He crawls in and shuts the door. Kicks off his boots. Stares at the roof of the car. Cas gets in the front and does the same thing.
Cas to try and paralyze him, is the thing. It looks like an attractive guy their age, dark hair, muscular, and it presses up against Cas and -
Every time they’re on a case together and he screws it up, John usually doesn’t tell him how it ended. He sulks in a room or at a bar for a day or two, and John comes back and they pack it up and blow town. Doesn’t say anything. When that happened, Sam would suggest looking through their dad’s notes to find out what or who the culprit was, but Dean always vetoed the idea, said they didn’t have the right to know if dad didn’t want to talk about it. But he always wondered.
It’s still light out. The cemetery had been old and abandoned, and they hadn’t had to dig under the cover of nightfall. The sun doesn’t set until well after eight, this far south, this deep into summer. Cas looks out the window. They’re not by the beach, but it’s only a mile off, maybe less.
"I'm fucked up," he says, leaning against his car - it was closest - and trying to find his keys. He can't. He puts his forehead against the cool metal. "Ugh."
This episode was depressing huh? I didn't think I'd be able to change much of how the Millers' endings went, but I think Sam and Dean were able to behave a bit differently through it all. Originally I wanted to rewrite the Miller family a bit more (like was I the only one who felt bad for Mrs. Miller? Not just losing her family, I just feel like in most cases of domestic abuse there's not just one person being abused in the household. I always wondered if Mrs. Miller got similar treatment and that's why she never stood up for her step son?) but I ended up not writing that in, I kind of thought it wouldn't flow as well, but yeah.
"Then why are we still here?" Dean nods to Haley and her brother. "I mean - why don't we just get them out of here and leave? Go find dad?"
He sees a phone on the bedside table. He takes it off the charger and flips it open. Thursday, April 10th, 2003. There's a message from an unknown number.
Sam lets him out of the trap; they’re in the house of Bobby Singer, and the woman is waiting upstairs. She looks at him with wide, piercing eyes, Castiel sees her, sees the superior that had vanished without an explanation.
He should view it as a weird text sent to the wrong person. Instead he's standing up, gathering his things. In the discarded jeans pocket he finds a key ring, and when he leaves the motel room he spots a car that seems… familiar. His key unlocks the door. He tosses his belongings inside, frowns, and goes to the office.
She wipes her face messily with a sleeve. “My sister’s body isn’t even fucking cold, and you’re on a treasure hunt?”
Meanwhile Sam gets to do his fun 180 and be supreme ally to Cas lol. And I just added this one in as a fun little easter egg, but Cas (and Dean briefly) is wearing a very fun shirt because in my mind Cas has the weirdest sense of fashion and Dean just has to deal with it.
Dean’s lulled into it all - a case freshly finished, the sand and saltwater, a bar they find on the expanse of beach that has ice-cold beers. Cas gets them another round and Dean watches, lazy, as two women approach him as he waits. They’re about Dean’s age, skin bronze from the sun. One twirls a strand of salt-curled hair around and around her finger as she flirts with Cas. Her friend looks over at him, and helpless between watching Cas and what his usual inclination is to any pretty woman who gives him a second look, he’s stuck awkwardly waving a hand.
"I'm not going back to school, Dean." Sam wipes his fingers on some spare napkins and gets up from the table. Dean follows, watching Sam toss the rest of the food before the gulls can fight over it, much to Dean's disappointment. "Should I even ask what you two are going to do?"
Weird. Dean has seen Cas buck-ass naked more times than he can count. He’s a goddamn pro at not making it weird. What the hell is different now?
Cas thinks about that, about how to phrase his answer as neutrally as possible. “You...care for me. I know that. You’re my friend. You told me so.”
One last, bright slice of pain, then silence. The next thing he is aware of is the sound of the waves and the calls of seabirds.
, who cares, Dean’s about to shoot off with his best friend, the love of his life, wrapped around him. Cas’ breathing has gone ragged, his other hand fisted in the back of Dean’s hair as Dean clutches at him and then everything goes white hot, tight, as Dean’s vision goes and he’s coming, he’s coming and so is Cas if the answering groans are anything to go by.
Cas shrugs out of his coat and toes off his shoes with a human casualness that shouldn’t make Dean ache, but does. He starfishes back onto the bed, eyes closing.
He’d thought he was past the denial stage of grief. Cas is gone, he knows that in the hollowed out place that passes for his beat-up heart, but even so, he’s finding it really hard not to argue with Sam. That was Cas. It felt like Cas, anyway. Something familiar he’d be hard-pressed to articulate but feels true all the same.
"You make a compelling case," Cas says, laughing softly into his neck before pressing a kiss there. "But yes. We should. First."
“Let’s withhold judgment,” Cas says as they step inside. “Maybe the damage is limited to -” Cas trips on a high spot in the floor, Dean throwing out an arm to catch him. The air inside is crisp and clean, owing to the fact that most of the glass is missing from the main room’s windows.
Dean wants to argue. He wants to tell him that none of it matters, that all is forgiven, that he’s done shit too, but he settles for awkwardly reaching over to pat Cas’ knee. He’s already said everything he needs to say, forgiven Cas a hundred times over. He knows - it’s not about him.
“Well, considering that I met him when he needed help dealing with an infestation of grindylows in his pond, he’s pretty open-minded. I let him know ahead of time that something weird might go down.”
“The question is, ‘Would you like to be famous? In what way?’ I’m sure you see the issue. We’ve both already been famous, or at least infamous. Me, as a megalomaniacal would-be deity and you as -”
Dean stops the dirty roll of his hips and takes in the mess he’s made of Cas. High spots of color on his cheeks, mouth open, chest rising and falling quickly—the mirror image of everything Dean’s feeling too.
“There are so few case studies to draw from. And my situation is slightly different than Anna’s. When she fell, she assumed the form of a human infant with all attenuated mental capacities. Her angelic memories were compartmentalized, packaged away, to preserve her sanity. And that of her human parents.”
Cas hums. “Not quite. More like, attempting to subvert Michael’s. You were never his, Dean. You belong to no one but yourself.”
"S’nothing. I'll just load up those buckets of blueberries you left by the front gate. When did you have time to pick them anyway?"
"I'd say we understand better than most that what really matters is the way a person is known to be in life, and remembered in death, by those they loved."
“Traditionally, yes, that’s true.” Cas plucks the sachet out, nudging the mug toward Dean. “Friends care for one another.”
He starts working at Dean’s belt, but his fingers fumble with the buckle. Dean lays his hands over Cas’, then brings Cas’ palm up to his mouth to kiss.
“I know,” Cas answers, not unkindly. They eat quietly for a minute or two. Or, Cas eats quietly while Dean does the best he can.
“We’ve run quite short of major enemies, it would appear,” Cas says before nimbly stealing a piece of meat from Dean’s bowl. "I’m feeling an acute sense of hope, and for once, it doesn’t feel misguided.”
One day, Sam and Jack take a case out in Omaha. Something about a mildly irritated ghost keeping a college professor up at night. It would’ve been entirely beneath their pay grade before everything settled down, but Sam’s been itching for some action and this is as close as it gets.
Dean eyes the creature, its gaze fixed unsettlingly on him from just above the water. “Cas, this thing killed two people.”
The dancing goes on past midnight. Dean could sleep here, his head tucked against Cas’ neck as they slowly sway, surrounded by all their friends and found-family.
Cas smooths a hand over the cover of the book, setting it carefully on the nightstand. “I look forward to reading it. This one was missed in Metatron’s overview of humanity’s creative output.”
"Sure," Dean says dismissively, looking around for a change in topic that doesn't get so close to dredging up any other personal vulnerabilities. "So, do you think you're gonna need me to build any more of those stick things for the green beans -"
“I’m currently filtering my own narrative down to meet the time requirement, and I need approximately 384 seconds for that process to complete in the background of my subconscious.”
It’s overcast, but Cas still insists that they apply the sunscreen he’d apparently picked up at a gas station somewhere along the drive.
“So I’m going to take off,” Sam says, leaning in and smiling. “Eileen is already here. We’ll meet you guys back home in a couple days, ‘k?”
His vision goes a little hazy once a second finger joins the first, a gentle stretch that Cas gives him with more care than anyone has ever touched him with before. Dean rocks into it, greedy and so eager that he absolutely forgets to be self-conscious, the critic in his head going quiet as he gives himself over to how good this is. Cas works out just where to curl his fingers to get Dean’s back bowing off the bed. When he can manage to open his eyes, he sees Cas, brow furrowed, staring transfixed at where his fingers are working. It’s a patternless push-pull, circling and dipping just inside before filling him up again and again.
“Shit, you’re probably starving. You want pancakes or something?” He skims the menu, skipping over the bullshit options like oatmeal or shrimp and grits. Some things just shouldn’t be served more than fifty miles from the Carolina coast. “Gotta be honest, the biscuits weren’t great today. A little gluey. Maybe some bacon and eggs? Or, let’s see... I got the hash brown scramble once. It’s good. I think you’d like it. But, shit, you just space-warped back to Earth or whatever, you deserve caviar and top shelf scotch, not a plate of burnt toast and—”
Cas looks up at him, eyebrow raised, his slightly smirking mouth a hairsbreadth away from Dean’s dick.
Cas tells him about Farhiya, about the minor kindnesses of a handful of strangers. Dean, in turn, shares a story about a time he and Sam took a Greyhound from Nashville to Sioux Falls with nothing but a bag of trail mix for sustenance. Upon follow-up questioning, Dean explains how John had decided to take another hunt rather than drive Sam back to Bobby’s for the start of 7th grade, and Dean had taken the problem into his own hands.
“You’re gentle,” Cas says from inches away in the quiet near-dark. Dean hasn’t had enough alcohol for this. Enough alcohol might not even exist.
Dean sits back on his heels, taking Cas with him. Before Dean can track what’s happening, Cas is pulling out, turning around, and then, face to face, he’s sliding Dean’s dick back where it belongs.
“Later, Dean,” Cas murmurs in his ear. Dean can’t help the Pavlovian shudder that runs down his spine at the proximity of Cas’ voice. He nods.
Dean sets his burger down, takes a sip of his tea. Something stronger would help, but he’s trying to be better lately. He can do this. He can’t do this.
Dean wants to press, to needle at him until he gets a begrudging answer out of Cas about how he obviously prefers stacked blondes in red lipstick and combat boots so that he can be sure, finally, that he stands no goddamn chance. But he doesn’t.
Dean’s room is dark, and Dean steers them unseeing until the back of Cas’ knees hit the bed. He couldn’t say how they got here - there were stairs involved, the occasional stumble. Dean clicks on the lamp and then guides him down to sit on the edge of the mattress. Dean drops to a crouch, looking up at him from between his knees on the floor and giving Cas very particular, vivid ideas. What else is Cas supposed to make of the crown of his head, bowed as he unties Cas’ shoes and slips them off, other than riotous pornographic visions of the future? Cas’ pants follow, then Dean’s hands are at the hem of his shirt, skating over his stomach and chest with more contact than is probably mandatory as he pulls it over his head.
Dean just laughs and holds his hand out, palm down. Cas frowns down at the obvious tremor, taking the hand in between his own palms.
, some bartender outside Columbus had said to him once after a hook-up, years ago. She’d said it like an insult, and Dean’s been careful ever since. Nobody wants a needy one night stand.
“You’re sure,” Claire says, and she’s using the voice Dean always uses with unreliable witnesses to paranormal events. Shit, she probably learned that tone from him.
“I’m saying it was a hell of a move to shoot your shot only when Death was literally pounding at the door.”
“I can’t be sure, but I’m fairly sure that what I want from you isn't what other people want," Cas says, keeping it diplomatic.
“This is different, come on. Nobody’s dead or trapped in another dimension this time.” He’s also not on his own anymore, and neither is Sam. “And Sam and I’ve been in each other’s pockets for so many years, he’s probably dying for a little breathing room with Eileen.”
“Mm. I see. Are you asking if I find him attractive?” Cas asks, voice low and making Dean shift in his seat to hide how that pitch makes his traitorous dick react.
Dean rests his chin on Cas’ thigh, Cas’ cock twitching an inch from his mouth. “Wait, mine in particular? Or the human genome in general?”
to know this shit. He asked, after all. And there’s no one around to judge him for it. Just him and Cas, a couple of buds on a dark highway on the way to a no-name motel, answering intimate questions about themselves. Fuck.
“Are you really going to insist on a false premise that you are comfortable sleeping atop the blankets?”
“I love you too,” he says, thumb sliding over Dean’s pulse point and then toward the center of his palm. The action activates enough nerve endings that he can practically feel his teeth buzz. “And if you wouldn’t mind...”
“Uh, you maybe didn’t see, but last night, I kinda, might have...” Cas lifts his head to look at him, like this isn’t difficult enough. “Cried a little. Yeah. I haven’t felt that close to anybody in a while.”
Cas hums, tonguing over the mark he’s made. He’s seen this skin marred and bruised but never this gentle way, never by his own mouth.
“We going as forest rangers on this job or did you lose your razor again?” Dean blurts out, before his traitor brain can land on an adjective.
As long as he’s awake, he might as well do something more productive than lying here in the dark. He puts on yesterday’s borrowed pants and socks and sets out to wander. The kitchen is closest, so he stops there first. There are a few plates and bowls out, Sam’s blender and Dean’s whiskey tumbler. He sets about washing and drying, putting everything back where it belongs. After wiping down the counters, the front of the refrigerator and the inside of the microwave, and he can’t find anything else to do. Sleep still feels far-off.
“Well, I don’t know. Could be there’s something keeping him away. Some reason he’s sort of here and not here. Worth a shot, right?”
Cas looks up at him, eyes dark as he works one boot and then the other off slower than is probably necessary, slow enough for Dean to feel the blood leave his brain for warmer climes. Cas stands again between Dean’s spread knees, surveying him.
The place isn’t exactly full of his best memories. Surprisingly, watching soaps with a broken leg and determinedly not grieving Cas doesn’t really make his life’s admittedly shitty highlight reel. Still, free real estate. And you can’t beat the scenery.
“Pretty sure gardens don’t spontaneously regenerate within a four hour period, Cas,” Sam interjects.
Dean glances at him and then away, eyes wide like Cas knows something he shouldn’t. What, Cas has no idea.
Cas isn’t done though, apparently. Dean’s just hanging on for the ride when Cas uses both hands to spread his legs apart before reaching up and swiping at the come that’s managed to pool in the dip of his throat. Dean feels like he’s lit up, and so damn close to Cas like they're living in each other’s skin, stuck in the best feedback loop of all time.
The sun is starting to slip behind the clusters of white birch trees at the lake’s edge when he hears the creak of the floorboards behind him. He turns, and there's Cas, coat abandoned and sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He smiles down at him, warm and fond.
“Uh, any more memories coming back, of how you got out?” Dean asks as they circle through the outer ring Columbus suburbs.
Cas laughs, fingers tracing the inseam of Dean’s jeans. “Not at all. I think it would please her, actually.”
The bus stops in Portland, and the driver tells everyone to be back in ten minutes. Cas’ stomach has become more demanding, and he follows the drift of passengers out into the crisp air. There’s a hot dog cart to his left, a truck selling crab cakes to his right. And, across the street at the entrance to the station, a vending machine. A memory comes back to him, unbidden. Dean and Sam, a motel near Cincinnati. Sometime in 2008. Dean explaining how to push the buttons and hit the side of the machine just right to trick it into giving out a free meal. He figures he might as well give it a shot.
The girl jumps, glances at him suspiciously before she must see something in his expression that takes the fear out her eyes.
“What about you, man? Bet you’ve got a ton of shit you could be doing that’d make for a day better than this one.”
He sucks Cas in as far as he can while still able to breathe and stays there. He could live in this spot. Dean feels goddamn holy as Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair, behind his ears, smoothing over his shoulders.
He’s probably dreaming, but he could’ve sworn Cas kisses the back of his neck before he’s lost to sleep again.
“Your life line has multiple breaks and branches, before it thickens and steadies midway. Palmistry is an imprecise art, but there’s a certain poetry in it.”
“It’s possible he’d smite me on the spot for drawing this comparison, but Gabriel was the closest approximation of a mother I ever had. I miss him.”
like the way Lisa touched him, all almond-scented body oil and sexy, ineffectual drags of her smooth hands across his bare back. That has been nice, no question. But this?
“You didn’t know that at the time. Anyway. Here’s to half-cocked, foolhardy devotion. The true meaning of friendship,” Cas says, lifting his mug in a toast.
"You might want to keep your voice down," Cas says archly, before taking a sip of his brilliantly yellow drink, eyebrows raised.
Dean is getting out of the shower one morning a few days later when he realizes he’s let his hair get too long—almost Sam-level long, which is unacceptable. He considers buzzing it off himself, but what the hell, the barber shop in town probably needs the business. After a shave and some breakfast, he throws a wave at Sam and Eileen on his way to the garage, ignoring the stack of books on the war room table between them. Sam's been praying to Jack and they’ve been hitting the lore non-stop since St. Louis. All it's led to is a big pile of nothing. Jack must've meant it when he said he'd be hands-off.
Cas starts kissing him back in earnest when Dean tongues at his lower lip. He’s got one hand pressed to the side of Dean’s face and the other fisted in his t-shirt like Dean’s in any danger of going anywhere. The dock groans unhappily beneath them as Dean presses closer, and he knows it isn’t his imagination that the air around them is growing warmer, sweltering.
But he’s still thinking. Pulling out tricks, trying to make this the best Cas has ever had so that he never wants anything else..any
- it’s been a long time since he’s thought of it that way. There’s gravel in his hair, and he can feel the beginnings of a sunburn on his face. Human, then. Or at least mostly so. Interesting. He has the fringes of a memory in his mind, a possible explanation for the way in which he finds himself, but nothing tangible yet.
“I’ll take your word for it,” Dean says, even though he certainly has his doubts. “And this accord, or whatever. What’re the terms?”
“So the first part of the question, how close and warm my family is or whatever. I’m gonna get creative in my definition of family.”
Dean’s hands are uncooperative and slow as he attempts to slide the knot loose. It doesn’t help at all that Cas’s fingers have wandered across the blanket and are now drawing patterns on Dean’s knee.
He taps on the bathroom door gently. Cas cracks it open just wide enough to reach out and grab the stack in Dean’s hands.
“So, a wedding,” Cas said, turning Dean’s hand over where it’s clenched against his thigh and lacing their fingers together.
“Uh...when you say ‘all,’ you mean...all?” Dean says, eyeing the shoeboxes of berries with no small amount of grief.
“That’s very generous of you, considering I was not aware of the existence of homemade baked goods sent by our
Dean does, leaning back against the headboard. Cas takes his free hand in his, setting it palm up on his knee. Dean sneaks a glance at him from underneath his arm, curious. He watches Cas unscrew the lid from a jar with a homespun-looking label. Cas scoops out a smudge of whatever it is and smooths it between his palms before taking Dean’s hand in both of his. His thumb begins at the heel of Dean’s hand, and Dean’s fingers flex with how bone-meltingly good it is.
“Here, sit up. I’ll help you with it.” What is he doing, he shouldn’t be doing that, the hands-by-the-neck thing. It’s risky, is what it is, and who knows what might -
“Alright, two hours out. Hit me with another question,” Dean says, popping a Creedence tape into the deck and turning it down low as he avoids every toll road on the way out of Chicago.
Dean dives right in, dipping a piece of buffalo sauce-covered something or other into what looks like blue cheese dip but is probably seaweed.
That whole situation was weird as hell. Poor Daphne. I guess that’s what happens when you pull a naked stranger out of a river and try to marry him.
Cas huffs. “Yes. I am fully cognizant of the fact that our access to Charlie's perpetually limitless credit cards means we could buy whatever I can't grow myself. But -"
“Correct again. I texted Sam from the car that we might not be back until tomorrow. He responded that we should ‘take our time’ and ‘savor this special experience,’ which I thought was nice.”
Dean gasses up the Impala once the suburbs give way to corn and soybean fields again. Cas calls Sam to check in as Dean heads inside to procure coffee and something approximating breakfast from inside the store.
Dean pulls off with one more suck to the head, licking his lips because he finally knows how Cas fucking
Dean tips forward until his head is resting against Cas’ shoulder. Cas brings both arms up around his back and holds him.
Dean reminds himself that he’d trust Jody with his life. Has done, more than once. But entrusting some dude named Carl with
Cas' hands join Dean's on top of his head, lacing his fingers with Dean's and shifting their joined hands down until Dean thoroughly gets the message. Cas doesn't move an inch until Dean makes him. Dean alternates rocking up into his mouth with dragging Cas head up and down on his dick, Cas’ hands gripping just above his knees. Each time he slides his cock back home in Cas' throat, he earns a cut-off moan from Cas that he can feel in his bones.
Getting head from someone who doesn't need to take time for stupid, human things like breathing makes Dean feel like he's losing his mind via wet suction and the slide of Cas' tongue at his slit, and he barely gets out a garbled mix of nonsense, several expletives, and Cas' name before he's shooting down Cas' throat, his hands gripping his hair and holding Cas still. Cas swallows smoothly, humming like Dean's the generous one here.
, but didn’t know what he wanted. The feeling in his chest was the same one that had always been there but somehow entirely different. It confused him.
At his name, Dean startles to attention from where he’s been frozen staring at Cas. He flicks his eyes between Cas and Sam, vaguely aware he’s been asked a question but unable to look away from his resurrected best friend for more than a moment.
Dean knew he was acting strange but couldn’t make himself stop. He felt flustered when Cas was looking at him but empty when he wasn’t. He’d look at Cas, and
Dean finishes rushing Cas into his room, and closes the door firmly behind them. He holds up a single finger –
At his name, Dean startles to attention from where he’s been frozen staring at Cas. He flicks his eyes between Cas and Sam, vaguely aware he’s been asked a question but unable to look away from his resurrected best friend for more than a moment.
He’d practically still been a kid when he was killed the first time by those ghouls looking for revenge, and he’s spent almost every second since then either dead or possessed. He’s got a new chance at life now, and no idea what he wants to do with it. Adam hasn’t gotten anything he’s wanted in a very, very long time, and it feels exciting and overwhelming all at once to think that its possible to have the things he wants, again. Even if he doesn’t know what those things are.
He’s not really sure what’s going on, but not having to worry about the end of the world sounds pretty good to him. He returns the note to his pocket and sets off to find a road.
Adam blinks awake on a quiet bus, slumped against the window. Blearily, he looks out the window at the scenery passing by.
“Not- in a brotherly way, Sam, I- “ Cas struggles for words. He breathes out slowly and looks away from the table, away from Sam, off to the corner of the library. “I know I’m not a Winchester in name,” he says quietly. “But I would gladly be, if Dean desired to give his name to me.”
Finally, action, something that Dean knows how to deal with. He reaches out and grabs Cas’ shoulder, stopping him from leaving. Cas looks up at Dean, and Dean feels frozen again, caught by their eye contact, but forces himself to remember – actions, not words.
Adam is here for closure, not to cause a scene in the middle of the street. He turns back the way he came and walks away from the only home he’s ever known.
Sam’s head turns just enough for him to briefly lock eyes with Dean, before turning back to watch their destination with careful eyes. Miracle goes straight to the door and paws at it, blissfully ignorant of the brothers’ concern.
He’d travelled around the country, visiting places that they hadn’t had the time or money to visit when he was a kid, and trying to work through his old memories and his grief. He feels a little better now, and feels a little more centered in who he is again.
When Sam turns back around, Castiel’s eyes are a little wide and searching Sam’s face for the meaning of the statement.
crashes over him like the wave of a tsunami. “Cas, I- I think you don’t understand what you’re saying. When you say ‘I love you’ like that, it sounds like you mean that romantically. As opposed to when you love someone like a best friend.” Dean tries to open his eyes, but he can’t quite find the courage to look at Cas’ face right now. “You mean it like a best friend, right? Like a brother?”
Slowly, carefully, like he’s reaching out to a live bomb, Dean reaches out and gently cups Cas’ cheek. No bombs go off; the world doesn’t end; and Dean Winchester is gently holding the face of another man. He exhales shakily and brings his other hand up from Cas’ shoulder to cup the other side of his face, mirroring what Cas did before.
Cas’ thumb strokes across Dean’s upper cheek and Dean’s eyes flutter as his thoughts scatter to the wind. God, how is he supposed to-
Cas opens his mouth to greet them but is interrupted by Miracle bowling into his legs for attention. He looks down, blinking in surprise, and then bends over to pet Miracle, a warm smile back on his face. “I wasn’t expecting a dog,” he says, as he rubs Miracle behind the ear.
much have we been through together? Right, Dean?” Sam turns to Dean, clearly looking for him to agree.
As much as it pleases Castiel, it unsettles him. He knows they’re pretending he never confessed to Dean, that he’s not in love with Dean, but he finds it difficult to play his part when Dean smiles him like that.
As he furiously scrubs at his eyes, willing the horrible ache in his chest to go away, he hears the sounds of someone walking their dog from down the street, and has a flash of realization. If that dog-walker lived here back when Adam was alive, and recognizes him, then that neighbour is probably going to freak out at seeing a dead person walking around alive.
Dean feels like someone pressed a pause button on his brain; he can’t think, doesn’t know what’s happening. Why is Cas’ hand on his cheek?
He’d thought of going to Sam and Dean, but decided against it. In the time it took to hitch-hike his way to the nearest town, he’d had a lot of time to think, and he’d decided that he wanted to enjoy his newfound freedom first.
– and waits until he hears Sam start walking down the hallway. The last thing Dean wants is Sam overhearing this conversation and giving him pitying looks over dinner.
“It’s okay, Dean,” Cas says softly. “I know that hearing a confession of that magnitude can make the receiver of the confession feel guilty or obligated in some way to shoulder those emotions, but I don’t want you to feel that way. I’m more than happy to continue being your friend, Dean.”
