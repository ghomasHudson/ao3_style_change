I had nothing left but pride. But I had survived worse than this.

“A letter?” Holmes leaned forward. “Did he mention to whom he might have been writing? Family, perhaps, or school friends?”
“Yes.”
The constable that had met us at the front gate had spotted us in his position up on the driver’s seat of the carriage, and I had barely opened my mouth to shout a warning when, in an instant, a gunshot exploded from behind me. The constable jerked in his seat and slumped, falling from the cab to the earth with a heavy and awful thump. My ears rang as the carriage horses shrieked and whinnied in alarm.
“The carriage is ready, Mr. Holmes,” he said excitedly. “Now, are we to have your explanation?”
Johann's nostrils flared. "How.
“Where is he?” Johann demanded, through gritted teeth. His fear was convincing, but his anger was sincere. Johann’s great hands were clenched at his sides into fists that shook.
“You got there in time,” I said softly.
inspector, without greater possession of the facts.”
“Upon my word, you keep digging that hole of yours!” Robinson snapped. “You have no idea who I am! You’ve crossed the wrong man too many times! It’s a disgrace, I tell you, and your superiors
“Watson—”
“Is precisely one of the reasons why I love you so,” Holmes said. I swallowed my words as he tilted his head, pressing a kiss against my calloused palm. Something within me trembled at the sentiment, like the foundation of some edifice cracking under strain, and I sighed heavily enough to collapse.
He spat the word. “We are not men of such sentiment, we do not value
“Kindly pick that up for me, my dear.” Anna Coram took my gun in hand with an uncomfortable familiarity, pulling back the hammer with ease. I never left Baker Street without a full six rounds loaded in the thing, and now, I regretted my fastidiousness.
“We have arrived,” he said, smoky eyes flitting to the window before returning to mine. “...I suppose we shall just have to keep an eye on each other, won’t we, Watson?”
However could he claim to know nothing of romance? He would render me a swooning mush upon the floor without even realizing it.
Holmes looks smug. “I presume his attempt to locate the diamonds stolen from his flat last month failed. It was a wasted effort to look to the mainland, they’re almost certainly in the city.”
“That was the peculiar thing, Mr. Holmes! It was almost unreadable! Full of errors, and awfully vague. It was hard to understand if the train had correctly passed that station or not. You can read it for yourself...” Striding over to his desk, he picked up a pink stamped sheet and handed it over to Holmes; he took it, and I peered over his arm to read it myself.
“A fab—there was no perfume? No civetta scent?” I exclaimed. “My word, you certainly had me and Mrs. Marker going. You were so specific!”
I stiffened at the sound of a low groan from where I had slumped in my chair. His bruised face wrinkled and my heart rose to my throat, overjoyed as I watched his eyes flutter open.
"Indeed I could," I said calmly. It was a familiar practice of mine, offering my services—always sincerely given, do not mistake me—as an in-route to speaking with witnesses or potential suspects.
“Holmes—”
“At first, the maid thought young Smith was already dead, but upon touching his face to check for signs of life, he opened his eyes for an instant.” Across from the inspector, Holmes visibly returned from the crime scene in his mind to the spirit of the moment, chin lifting in sudden attention. Hopkins lowered his cup to lean forward slowly, caught up in the drama of his own dark narrative. “The lad evidently spoke to her, in his last moments.
“I understand the risks, my dear fellow.” At my raised eyebrow, he frowned and said, more earnestly, “I realize the severity posed in being identified, Watson, much as I may detest the necessity of deception.”
"And the rest of the house rooms, miss? How many bedrooms?"
I'd never heard that word leave my friend's lips with such frequency, nor had I ever seen him look so aggrieved. It was this, and only this, that kept me where I stood instead of storming out of the apartment to escape the mortifying agony of betrayal.
A skeptical hum traveled through the open bedroom door, and I refused to let it discourage me.
The wretched man paled, his ruddy expression draining to a sickly pallor. “Awright, awright!” he cried, folding in on himself. “So I was drunk! But it don’t change nothing, you hear! The train came and I sent the message, that’s it!” He twisted his wedding ring fitfully, looking distressed. “Go easy on me, eh? I’ve been workin’ here for years now, this job is all I got for the family.”
are the owner of the Circle? I had no idea!"
I blinked as from behind Mrs. Hudson, a large, rare figure emerged from the hall to fill the door-frame.
"These matters...are difficult for me to speak of," he said quietly. "I deplore that which escapes me, and few things confound me more readily than these notions. They frustrate, in a manner beyond comparison."
“We shall see about that,” I retorted, bracing myself, and the man lunged forward with lightning speed, striking hard and fast towards my weaker arm. Grunting under the strain, I struck a sloppy parry, sidestepping backwards. My heart pounded as he kept coming, swinging quick and powerful hits that I could barely riposte in time before they struck flesh. Eventually, too slow, I let out a shout of pain as wood met the bones of my left fingers. My attacker grinned in victory as my grip loosened, and in that moment I took a risk. He outclassed me in brute strength, so I applied the surefire method I’d learned in university.
Sleep eluded me, but I needed it desperately. I couldn’t carry on as I was. I knew all too well the effects of sleeplessness on a healthy mind, even on minds of genius, and how much the shaken and grieving required rest. And that was what I was, now. The grieving. I had borne the burden of the category before, but never had it kept me awake like this. After Mother, I drank. As did Father, as did Harry. It was their behavior, throwing things and bellowing at each other, which had eventually scared me into sobriety. After Father’s death, I enlisted: perhaps, in retrospect, an even more dangerous method of coping. And after Harry...after Harry, I turned to cards, and as a result my pension had dwindled until Stamford introduced me to a roommate with a cabinet that would lock and an owner that would mind my chequebook.
“He is my patient,” I snapped out, as one arm attempted to lift mine from Holmes’s wrist.
“The cigarettes? Japanese, he said.”
“My dear Watson,” he said, and the incomparable light of discovery sparked in his eyes. “You are
"It was a case with its own rewards," Holmes replied, and I couldn't help but meet his ashy gaze, heart in my throat at the softness I found there. "...I assure you, I have been compensated in full."
"A month of good business should prove your trustworthiness, good sir."
“If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes,” Hopkins said plainly. “It’s a two hour train departing at eleven thirty, if you could join me.”
"—Perhaps we will return sometime soon." Though his half-lidded eyes were impassive, Holmes's grip on my forearm had tightened, and my throat worked in a swallow.
"You have a good ear, Mr. Vernet," said Johann, his arctic blue eyes brightening. "Sweden is the countryland of my family, my ancestral home. I misspent much of my youth there."
“The more pieces we discover, the larger the puzzle becomes,” said he, visibly relishing the point. “We must learn all we can about this evacuation of the train, Watson. The station master might be able to shed some light on the matter, wouldn’t you say?”
Finally, Holmes turned his head, and his eyes found mine. It was not possible, but I thought for a moment he could hear the sound of my heart racing.
"Yes," said Holmes, and I felt my face freeze in horror. Holmes threw up his hands, face almost pleading. "No! Watson—do not mistake me. It is true that since you shared that aspect of yourself with me I....I confess it has lingered on my mind. I am—I am curious, you see—"
“There is nothing to thank,” Holmes said calmly. The iron intensity that had shone from his eyes had ebbed, sliding behind more opaque glass. “Our country’s laws on the subject are a point of conservatism that I consider both backward and unacceptably cruel. I do not blame you for your reluctance in speaking to me about it, especially when there is much of the personal which we do not discuss with one another. I can only offer you my regrets that you felt you could
“Really?” he said, voice high with disbelief.
I was roughly ordered downstairs, and I played up my leg as much as I dared, desperate to buy Holmes time to escape from that hidden room. I hobbled more than I walked, my cuffed hands clutching the bannister in a death’s grip, but Coram had little patience for my stalling.
illogical as sexual prejudice
Hope you guys are alright with a cliffy until next week!  XOXO
in agreement, taking out my notebook, and bit down a smile as I pressed my knee against his in thanks.
Holmes quickly took the report and thumbed through it with energy, and I stood gratefully by the hearth in the station master’s office. My leg had the seasonal habit of barking like a mad dog in the colder months, and I had the feeling the day’s case would last longer than a mere few hours; if I wanted to be at all useful, I needed to take whatever moments of warmth presented themselves.
A pebble had grown in my throat. “I’m glad you are as well,” I said, voice thick. It was a relief down to my very soul to see him standing, whole and unharmed. “A mere scratch is a blessing.”
“Drinking alone, Doctor?”
Hopkins looked disappointed. “So we are dealing with a stranger after all,” he said tiredly. “An outside party, who could be anywhere from here to Cardiff by now.”
“You know my weakness for making bets, my dear fellow,” I said, propping my cane on a neighboring chair as I sat down and reached eagerly for my cup. “And I believe you owe me one breakfast, consumed posthaste.”
“Wonderful,” I deadpanned, before shaking my head. “I shall be fine, Holmes. Any holiday with you is one to enjoy.”
“They pose a credible risk to our offices, Sherlock,” Mycroft rumbles, chastising. “I can determine as much myself—”
“Was there cause for it?” His mouth forms a delicate smile, but it does not fully touch his eyes. “Concern?”
am not the one returning from convalescence,” I returned. “Nor am I the one who sniffles at the lightest breeze.”
I could not accept this. I could not stop trying—my mind hurtled about, flying through memories of Watson’s medical journals I had carelessly thumbed through, reports of attempted drownings and their survivors, and—my heart seized—a flash of memory, a newspaper article five years ago, a doctor had tried to save a child who’d fallen into the Channel with a French technique.
“One final thing, Watson, before we depart.” He pressed his face close to mine, so I could hear his whisper above the gale. “I must check something, and I’m afraid you are going to disapprove of the manner in which I mean to do it.”
“You believe the burglary and the missing train are connected, then?”
“Until then,” I said, with low affection. With that, Holmes dipped his chin, mouth twitching upwards at a rogue corner, and set off at a brisk pace towards the main road. I watched his lengthy strides for a moment, admiring not for the first time the determined, fluid march of his legs as he went. Finally I sighed, forcing myself to confront the rest of my own evening. Though Simpson’s was within walking distance of Baker Street, I hadn’t the mettle to trek all the way to the clinic if I wanted energy to spare for the paperwork waiting for me on my desk. And I wanted to finish it quickly too: I had two consultations and a full surgery tomorrow with another attending in the morning to perform my first appendectomy. I would need all the rest I could acquire between now, paperwork, and what precious minutes I could steal with Holmes before collapse once I made it to our flat.
“Holmes…” I gathered my courage, and I reached for words that I had harbored in the hope chest of my heart for nearly seven years. “I care for you more than I have ever cared for another. I would have lived a life in total happiness as your friend and your friend only, content with the joy of our companionship. I never told you my true feelings for fear of driving you away with the degree of fondness which I held for you.” My voice, despite the earnest nature of my words, featured the slightest tremble. “But now you say that you have feelings for me that I can only call romantic, and have for possibly years. That I am…
“You were correct when you said it was not jewelry, or a bracelet. But it is meant to be worn.” I lifted a hand to my left breast, over my pounding heart. “It is meant to be displayed in the front pocket.”
“It’s the letter.” My voice was hollowed out with disbelief. “Willoughby Smith. The letter he sent before he was killed. It came with the morning’s post.”
“Ah, yes. Well, I have been busy,” I said, carefully taking his leather-gloved hand in a cordial shake. He really
“Holmes,” I said.
The man’s animosity visibly ebbed, his pale brown eyes flickering with surprise and apprehension. “The police? You’re investigating the missing train?” His bearded mouth pressed together. “Fine. What do you want of me? I have nothing to hide!”
“Hello, Sherlock,” Mycroft Holmes said, his brisk voice twisted with that quintessential, stooped quality of an older sibling beholding the younger. It had been several months—the evening we located the Bruce-Partington plans—since I had last seen the elder Holmes. For the most part, he appeared precisely as he had then: substantial in dimension, in every respect, dressed in pristine business-wear with a finely brushed hat atop a head of hair gone white. However, in the shadow of the door frame, I thought that his face held a layer of strain it had not possessed before, fatigue pulling at the crow’s feet rounding his mouth and eyes to exaggerate the man’s years.
I thumbed open my pocket watch. It was eight forty-five. Somewhere in this neighborhood, Holmes was facing unprecedented danger alone. I despised being parted from his side, but I needed to believe the advice I gave Johann—I needed to trust in Holmes’s plan, and his abilities.
I relished the sound of his screams for the single second it took me to spin around, and my heart plummeted in horror.
“But you have your suspicions,” I cajoled, mouth twitching in a smile. “You always do, and you’re nearly always right.”
My heart skipped several beats. "You...I..."
Holmes pushes himself up beneath me, bringing his face closer to mine. His eyes dance with mirth. “It is a truly unique case. A locked door, a cracked safe with a secret code, and a buyer that mysteriously disappeared. He will be by before six, Watson, because our evening is also quite busy—”
Holmes.”
Holmes's eyes flew up from the floor to meet mine.
“Calm yourself, young man,” Holmes said. “How long has he been gone?”
Though he could not hear the poison Coram was whispering to me, Holmes’s eyes blistered with loathing. I sought his gaze, full of words I could not express—
“An excellent question, my dear.” Holmes looked up at me, eyes twinkling, and my heart thumped with familiar attraction at the sight of his approving silver gaze on mine. “I believe you and I are well up to the task of getting some answers out of him." A cunning minor curl stretched his mouth, and my chest tightened as my desire to return to the inn intensified with a new design.
Holmes stepped out of the cab and I craned my head to look up at the Bridlington station. A twin to its sister station in Evesham, it looked slightly busier if only for the more bustling town streets across from it. Above the station, cotton ball clouds were beginning to crawl against the sky, and the bite of the November wind had eased somewhat thanks to the welcome rays of the climbing sun.
"Afraid so, Thomas," I said, with false regret, "William and I must be going, but perhaps—"
Coram blocked me with a raised forearm, but it cost him. He bellowed in pain and I took advantage, following the block with a savage strike to his unprotected chest. Coram gasped wetly, and my lips curled in victory at the crack of broken rib-bone. Wheezing, Coram crawled backwards in the low rapids as he struggled to find purchase to stand. His hand slipped on beneath the water and I advanced. He twisted, lifting the other hand to his hip to reach for—
. Despite all efforts of repression, distraction... the feelings remain. The thoughts persist, and evolve to straits I once found disagreeable, in the rare occasion I formed them at all." Holmes's fingers dug into the leather. "And the part of myself that could not be silenced in your absence now resounds in your presence.”
"No," Holmes said weakly. "No, Watson. Allow me to explain. Please."
Just as we vaulted through the back door, white hot fire lanced across the north of my shoulder. Gritting my teeth through the pain of it, I pressed myself to the wall once through and waited. Holding my breath, I counted the seconds and swiftly raised my arm. A man hurtled through and I swung downwards, tripping him at the ankles. He sprawled forward and Johann raced to kick away his pistol. I arched back and struck the next man through the door in the stomach with the heavy metal knob of my walking-stick. He wretched, collapsing to his knees. Without hesitation, I dashed his gun from his hand with another blow. The movement left me vulnerable, however, and I found myself freezing like prey at the sight of a barrel pointed precisely at my head.
“Ta very much, Doc,” Wiggins said, answering for his young friend and giving him a meaningful look. I set about it, and in the corner of my eye watched with some amusement as Holmes sat down in his study across from our guests, leg crossed, and said not a word. Young Fred looked like he wanted to sink into the couch under my friend’s silent, penetrating attention, and after a moment of the boy’s torture, I pointedly cleared my throat. Holmes’s quicksilver gaze flickered briefly to me and the meaningful tilt of my chin, and with a near-imperceptible twitch of the lip, his attention returned to the boy with a less immutable expression.
“And while you and Johann meet with those brigands, I will endeavor to locate Peter Ables and free him.”
"And you tend you own bar?"
An appreciative gaze met mine, lighting a small warmth in my chest. “And what would such knowledge imply, my dear Watson?”
“Have we a case on the docket for today, or does the manuscript hold your attention?”
would be the one besieged,” Holmes whispered, smug against the shell of my ear. Immediate and potent, arousal rushed through my body. Heat spread across my face like a wildfire, and I forewent any attempt at speaking as Holmes lifted his voice to a more audible volume and slid his gaze to the man sitting by me, who was lifting a titian eyebrow in our direction.
“Watson,” said he, beckoning me close, and I drew magnetically to his side. He pointed a leather-clad finger, and I drew close to inspect its focus: faintly, I saw the whiskering strands of torn fabric in the light caught on the edge of one jut of glass, lilac in color. Torn from a woman’s dress, no doubt, and a fine one at that. My mind boggled at the idea of a highborn lady assassin, blind as a bat and soaked to the bone, and I shook my head in disbelief.
“Ah. No, sir. Local police righted it, but they reported it cast upon the floor on its side when they first entered the room.”
“Japanese
“…I am aware of the difference,” I began, cracking a grin, “when you are genuinely charming or merely playing at romance, Holmes. Your attempt to distract me from the fact our client is a smuggler is quite opaque.”
"Beyond reason," said Holmes, threadbare.
Inexplicably, color seemed to bloom in my friend's alabaster cheeks, low red and inappropriately becoming.
A considering beat, and Holmes said, “A capital idea, Watson.” His eyes were bright at the suggestion indeed, and I leaned back in surprise. He was not often so amenable to suggestions we turn from the Work when it was lacking, but perhaps for once he missed music more than the game. “A travelling string group from Prague will be performing Dvořák this weekend, and I should very much like to see it. How does that strike you?”
Holmes looked near to shattering.
“A large foot or a small?” Holmes pressed, voice climbing with a testiness I knew well.
what you want from me? A formal relationship?”
“Nooo. Peter wasna mad or nothing. He was even smilin’ when he went off t’work.”
By sheer stroke of luck, the rain had ceased on the train ride to Kent, but the cold still nipped at my hands and cheeks and burrowed into my collar. The journey to Yoxley Old Place was secluded and winding; though it wasn’t so far removed from Chatham’s city limits, the curving nature of the road—around thickets of trees left wild to divide the land, and across stony bridges and modest streams—it seemed more like the countryside than a manor not far from town and station. A constable at the manor’s tall brick gate met our taxi at the entrance and allowed the three of us passage, and Holmes had clambered out of the carriage to examine the only way in and out of the manor’s premises with his own senses.
“I wouldn’t try it,” a voice said, and I nearly buckled with relief.
I closed my eyes, despairing how my heart yearned in my breast at the words, foolish and wanting.
“Ah. Yes. Mr. Robinson attempted to send a message earlier. I told him plainly he couldn’t, and he left in such a huff—”
my dear fellow.”
“Good heavens. He must have swallowed half a distillery.” I coughed a bit on the rank stink of malt liquor emanating from the man’s uniform. His breath seemed to curl the very hairs in my nose.
At the silence that met her, Mrs. Marker looked up through her fingers and shrunk in her seat like dying flower. “No, no, I cannot,” she said, sobbing quite pitifully now. “Please, Mr. Holmes. I could not, I could not!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How can we make this up to you?” Peter pursued, his alto voice quivering.
Holmes spun on a heel, but almost as if he had been frozen in time, he stopped mid-circle, knee bent. “Curious.”
Holmes’s expression softened further. “You are always a friend to me, Watson,” he said gently. “No other has earned that title more.” A beat of hesitation, and the faintest of wavering before Holmes said, with less confidence, “And I would have no other before you. Very few, after all, would have me.”
I stared at him, gutted by the venom in his words. I felt as though I had whiplash, receiving concern and guilt a mere night prior only to be dragged across the coals the very next day.
"I am not like other men," Holmes said, with a plainness that quivered at the corners. "In that respect, or others. Others do not endanger you with every other case, Watson. Others do not fail to protect you from danger. Others do not
“It would be what I deserve,” she breathed. “For my silence. For that young man. Oh, God in Heaven, I did not know. I would have—I did not
His eyes found mine through curling tobacco smoke and responded with equal plainness,
“I agree,” Holmes said. “I think we could benefit from a search about the premises. There was something…off about the station master’s office, Watson…”
“They haven’t stopped serving me yet. And they won’t, what with the way I tip.” Thomas cupped a hand over his mouth to cut through the ambient noise surrounding us.  “Isn’t that right, Johann?”
not Austen novels.”
“I could not bear to lose you another time,” I said, my throat flayed with emotion. “My dear Holmes. Do not believe I could stand to let a man who tried to harm you go unpunished. That damned Austrian will pay for this.”
Holmes gestured to the glasses still in Hopkins’s hand. “The clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. One of these is discolored and slightly worn, but the other is new. Evidently, one has fallen off and been replaced. I should judge that the older of them has not been there for more than a few months. They exactly correspond, so I gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second.”
“A terrible thing,” I said quietly. “Poor boy. I wish there was something we could have done for him." I looked up at Holmes’s rigid mask. “But it was beyond our power. You enacted justice for him, catching his killers.”
Despite my feelings, and disregarding how often he captained my thoughts in the day and their quieter, tugging night wanderings, I was content with my relationship with Holmes, and not merely because I knew that his reciprocation of my feelings was quite impossible. He was my closest friend and confidant, a man with whom I shared more than lodgings, adventure, and goodwill. He was my time-tested, mosaic, ingenious companion, exceptional in mind and his meaning to me. I was happy. With our days, with our shared meals, our conversations and orchestra shows, and our cross-country investigations. I treasured our time together, unembittered, with the memory of life without him a still-healing wound in my mind.
“Pardon me, Mr. Farrow,” he said, “but perhaps you can offer me some assistance. Our good friend here was so kind as to grant me passage to this lovely establishment, but I confess there are ulterior motives to my presence here tonight.”
I insisted, brittle, half-pleading.
"...What is it, Holmes?"
Holmes pressed his lips together. “I see,” he said. His shadowy eyelids fell to half-mast. “Is there no other reason?”
The woman’s constitution was ghastly grey, now, and her voice shook like a rattling train carriage. “I—I—heavens, perfume? I myself, oh, I don’t think—I do not own such—Per-Perhaps Miss Susan—”
the plot thickens, and the banter increases 💕
My hands dug into the meat of my thighs. My bad leg hollered at the treatment, but the pain was bright and noisy and sharpened the slurry of my vision into stark, awful clarity.
"Kidnapping!"
” His voice was a sharp knife in a shaking hand. “I did not. I- I dragged you from the brook, but—” Words cut off, were reformed rattled and low. “You would not
“Indeed,” Holmes mustered, and I avoided his eyes. Pushing down any feelings of awkwardness and away any thoughts of the kind of which I was reading, I scanned the entries again and found myself frowning.
That had an equally simple answer. "I cared for you deeply long before I loved you, Holmes. I do not need what you cannot give, when your friendship has long been enough for me."
Cold water filled my stomach like a flooding cellar.
Holmes,
"It is worth investigating, at least until the trial is over," Holmes says, matter-of-fact, and at that, his temperament became subdued. "Your testimony isn’t necessary for conviction, Watson. Mine will be more than enough. You can give a deposition to Hopkins and never be confronted with the name Coram again, if you do not wish it.”
Ms. Tarlton returned swiftly from upstairs as Holmes was poking around the hallway, idly studying the wall hangings and the floor. As she reached the last step on the stair, he rejoined us at my elbow. Judging from her optimistic expression, luck was on our side.
curious.” He looked up at me, eyes sparkling. “This case really is the most exceptional way to end a holiday, Watson. I could hardly have wanted for better.”
“You are welcome in my room whenever you want, Holmes." Since my return home, our relationship has been a series of learning and renegotiating boundaries. For Holmes, it is a course of education: traditional romance holds no interest for him, and acts of physical intimacy have proven equal parts discovery and mutual curiosity.
Head barely up to Wiggins’s shoulder, Fred’s dirt-smudged cheeks flushed as he stepped forward, ducking a bashful chin. “H-Hullo,” said Fred in a small voice, brown eyes flickering nervously between Holmes and myself. “I’m Fred Ables.” After that, he seemed quite unable to continue, eyes locked upon Holmes with an expression caught between awe and a dreadful spot of nerves.
“That end may come faster than you think, Mrs. Coram,” I said. Pride in Holmes made me bold, bolstering my voice with righteous belief. “It often does, to people who underestimate him.”
But as I heard one of the figures looming above him rasp out a low, foul laugh, my fear evaporated. Very suddenly, my blood boiled hot and fiery, and my vision tunneled in red-tinted fury. Anger disintegrating the paralysis beneath my skin, I clenched the weapon in my hands. My throat locked around a cry, I gritted my teeth and dashed forward. Avoiding the water, I charged quietly enough that, as I raised my stick, one barely had time to turn round before I had cracked its heavy silver handle against his skull.
I reached for him only to stare as he returned fire with a weapon I didn’t realize he’d possessed. With crack aim, his shot met his mark and sent a Threadcap man crumpling to the floorboards, clutching his chest.
“No, certainly not. I told you that bartenders were remarkable sources for information, Watson, but I did not expect the treasure trove of knowledge to be learned from him the moment we entered. The second I uttered Peter’s name, Johann took notice, and began eavesdropping avidly on our conversation. With skill, if I may add. No doubt it comes from practice.”
“I’ve seen nothing later than the Western Roman empire today.”
“If you had died in my arms upon that bank, if he’d succeeded, I would have finished the job,” he whispered. “I would have sent him to Hell for it, Watson.”
“I am wont to do so, on occasion,” he teased, breath white in the air. “And this is a very promising mystery indeed.”
“Indeed,” Holmes said, eyes shimmering. “But luckily, I was able to recall his name in full. I don’t suppose the name Peter Ables means anything to you?”
As my mind turned, the three of us were led into the Professor's room. It was a large chamber, as poorly lit as the rest of the house. Massive velvet curtains hung over impressive paneled windows, and the entire space was lined with bookshelves filled with innumerable volumes which overflowed to the floor in the form of scattered, miniature towers of literature. A kingly four poster bed was in the center of the room, and beside it, positioned in a wheeled chair in a slice of light by the bedroom window, sat Professor Coram.
“I understand.” His voice was a monotone.
Holmes trailed off into a sharp exhale. He clenched his jaw once, shaking his head. “I cannot put it into words still,” he said, vexation leaking through his façade. “I don’t
“I anticipated my brother’s stubborn nature would make an appearance,” Mycroft explained. He lifted an eyebrow as Holmes swept off towards his room, before returning his gaze to mine. “In the future, I shall be more mindful of yours.” I bit my cheek, trying not to smile with minor pride, and Mycroft proffered a small smile of his own. “Take care of my brother, Doctor Watson. Do see he eats properly. He looks thin.”
For all that I smear the pathos in your stories, it is fact that you are not a creature for soppy poetry or knitted gifts! You are not meant for the doldrums of a partnership that stagnates on fading compliments and coquetry! We are the same in that. The very same. I was satisfied. I

“It’s hardly the whole of my lab materials,” Holmes said dismissively. “And you know as well as I what damage idleness brings upon the unused mind.
rush off to dispatch the Baron like some knight errant, Watson, you are no vigilante. Your morality would not allow it.”
point later today.”
however, are dripping blood all over the floor. Mrs. Hudson is going to have a fit.”
Holmes visibly smothered a smile. “I see. The lot of you will split a pot, a handful of pence each. A two guinea prize to the man who can bring me any concrete information about Peter Ables.”
“Yesterday, a lady entered your study and took your knife from your desk, knowing it would be there. She entered Mr. Smith’s room with the intention to kill the young man, and to take something which resided in his desk cabinet. She stabbed him, and left the knife upon the floor. Despite losing her eyeglasses in the scuffle, she managed to shatter the bedroom window and flee towards the gate entrance. She managed this crime, sir, and managed the path in the dark, because she was familiar with this estate and the layout of its rooms. She was familiar with Mr. Smith and knew out of which of the guest rooms where he was staying. She also knew it would be safe, upon reaching the gate, to turn around and walk the path back to the house and around to the housekeeper’s cottage...where she knew, also, that she would be relieved of her soaking wet clothes and given time to wait for her opportunity to sneak unseen by others back into the house—and indeed, sir, into your room.”
“Aye, I
“I could not distinguish.”
“Holmes, a relationship does not have to contain anything you don’t
The faintest of blushes bloomed in my friend’s alabaster cheeks. “I…may have unseated a postman.”
I felt suddenly humbled by the admission. I tried to recall the first time I had ever felt stirred by thoughts of another, and remembered how in my youth, it had taken years to learn my own preferences, how to accommodate others, and what was possible between two people in intimacy. I could not imagine the fear of going a life without urges, only to encounter them without warning oriented towards the only friend I had in life. I felt sympathy well up like spring water in my gut. I realized then, definitively, that I needed to proceed with utmost care: to preserve my friendship with Holmes, yes, but to spare him any discomfort or heartbreak I could. For all that my friend hid behind a mask of emotionlessness in unfamiliar company, I knew him to be particularly sensitive. Rushing into physical intimacy could altogether frighten him away, or worse, damage him irrevocably.
Holmes frowned at me, listening intently, and I realized I perhaps needed to be more explicit. “Expectations were set after a discussion about what we wanted, from each other, and from the partnership. Not everyone’s idea of a romantic relationship is the same. If were to…if you wanted to enter one with me, there is little real need to change.
“Excellent,” Holmes said, with a placating smile I knew to be practiced. “Then you—”
I thought, my hatred jagged at its edges. It would have been exact justice had he fainted in agony and drowned, unable to lift himself from the same watery grave he had tried to deliver Watson into. I still had half a mind to finish the job, but no force on earth could have compelled me to release Watson from my grip, not even revenge.
"Thank you, Mrs. Hudson," we chorused in unison. On leaving, Mrs. Hudson hovered at the door.
“And do be careful.”
*          *          *
“Oh yes,” Holmes purrs. “
“No,” said Holmes, eyes warm. “But we do have an engagement.”
The prospect of tea and breakfast was of minor comfort and better distraction, and I followed Holmes’s directive to sit, rubbing gentle circles into my upper quadriceps.
“He won't be disappointed,” I added, cleaning my service revolver with mechanical proficiency.
I blinked, surprised, and felt some minor shame at my first evaluation of the girl. “Thank you, Ms. Tartlon,” I said, mindful to be gentle. Poor dear had lost a friend in young Willoughby, it seemed. “That is kind praise indeed. And how are you faring?”
Holmes was frozen, staring at the gun pointing directly at my chest.
“As always, Holmes,” I said, quiet affection replacing all other emotion in my voice, and he dropped my hands. Instantly, they felt colder, but within my chest, his touch had constructed a bonfire that would sustain me in the meantime.
“No one, my good sir,” Lestrade said loftily. “You’re just bloody sloppy.” The man looked apoplectic, and Lestrade gestured to a fellow officer. “Cuff him, and the rest. Call for a few buses.” He eyed me. “And another doctor.”
“Until tomorrow then,” Holmes said, perfunctory and distracted. He did not turn to me as he said his goodbye, starting off the opposite direction with a hard and focused expression, and I swallowed a stone from my throat.
sleep. And yet fixed I remained, in the dark of the sitting room, curled in my study with the fireplace dead and the twin chair in front of me empty. The sight of it
"No luck with your man, Vernet?" His eyes dropped to Holmes's hand, and his face split into a smile that would've made a nun titter. "...Or perhaps so."
The young lady blinked rapidly. “I, well.” She paused, her delicate features folding in thought. “I can’t say that I noticed anything…odd, sir. We spoke of the usual things, in casual, innocent conversation, that is. This awful weather and the garden, and of—” Pink bloomed in her fair cheeks, and she looked to me with a bashfulness befitting her age. “—of your most recent story, Doctor Watson. Mr. Smith had gotten the latest print in the
“What are we to do, Holmes?” I asked, feeling hopeless. “There is no evidence that those brigands work for that devil. I doubt they will confess to being under his pay.”
"Imagine that," I said drily, but faltered as suddenly, Holmes’s amusement disappeared like a doused candle. I turned, following his gaze to the track behind me, only to stare with confusion. Down along the rails, I saw the most peculiar sight: the spotlight of the train was flickering. Squinting in the fog, I watched as its yellow beam began to dissipate into the foggy night until finally, it faded away entirely.
“Never in my life have I seen such a look of fright cross your face as when you looked at that ring,” Holmes said. His voice was low and cautious, as though weary of upsetting me merely by broaching the subject. “And the manner in which you look at me now unsettles me a great deal. Pray, my friend, tell me what has disturbed you so.”
was all my useless mind could manage, puerile pleading.
"Just a moment, Ms. Tarlton. Your room, miss, it's just there? Located above Mr. Smith's?"
His lip curled in a sneer, the crude, ugly kind fetched from his blackest moods. “You stand among the most compassionate of men, Watson. And look what’s come to you.”
“Delightful, Watson, delightful.”
My eyes returned to the archives in the dark corner of the flat, drawn as if by magnetic pull. Cynicism welled in my stomach. I’d be lucky if I could manage a damn thing with his notes, let alone justice. I was not Holmes. I was not the detective. I did not possess his powers, his knowledge, his energy, his dedication. I’d be lucky to manage rent payments on 221B doubling my clinic hours! I would not even have the
I blinked at him with surprise, before releasing a laugh at the teasing look on his face. “Of course not, Holmes. Why?”
I tutted. "Come now, the Whitechapel arsonist wasn't
“Hush,” my friend hissed. The diverted mood which had swept over him in the Professor’s quarters had been banished and replaced by an acute, single-minded mien. As though powered by one of Tesla’s voltaic electric coils he abruptly set down the east hallway, marching past the staircase and back several times. Hopkins and I watched, perplexed, as he opened the door to Ms. Tarlton’s quarters and entered her room.
I was certain, could see it on his face and hear it in the tone of his voice, that he was going to apologize to me for something ludicrous, like not having seen the future before it happened. I had no patience for it.
Holmes was still dead.
“Mr. Holmes,” I interrupted, before a row between the country’s two greatest minds could wage war in my sitting room. “Forgive me, but I must be blunt. Your brother
“Were there any passengers who got off before Bridlington last night?”
In the firelight, Holmes’s masked expression was immutable, but his hands on the upholstery tightened and released.
“D-Depression? Ohh, oh no, Mr. Holmes, I—” The woman twisted her hands with increased anxiety, voice trembling. She took the chipped teacup before her with shaking hands, voice dropping to a near whisper. “Oh, how awful, but—but perhaps the professor is right. He—he did know the lad best, after all, and I know nothing of such sorrows in men…my own late husband—”
“My friend could give the entire world a run for its money in stubbornness,” I said. My eyes flickered to the road ahead, and I saw we were approaching a stone bridge at the end of a curve, bracketed by thickets of trees. Past that, I remembered there was only hewn clearing before we reached the city limits, where I would have nowhere to hide and nowhere to run, and once in Chatham and on the train, my fate would be sealed.
Sitting in the living room was a slender young man, pale as parchment but unharmed, and Holmes, a bloody scratch on his brow but otherwise, perfectly pristine.
It is precisely this case that lingers in my mind this morning. I woke to dusk with the sound of rushing water in my ears, slick with sweat and gasping for air. I twisted in my sheets, heart pounding, the details of the dream clinging to my consciousness with awful clarity. Now I sit, nerves quivering, blankets rucked around a body that remembers an icy cold it does not truly feel.
“‘I’m not a policeman. Merely a friend,” I said carefully, spine straight.
"...Where?” he asked eventually. “I...like them, where they were.”
“No traces at all?” I repeated, confounded, and Holmes said nothing below me, mind no doubt riveted to the case in calculating straits beyond where my own acted as echo chamber. “Not even directly outside the broken window?”
“But how?
“Lean back, my friend,” he said, his voice regaining its strength and discipline. “I can see you shaking from the effort of leaning up. Lay
Suddenly, the closed door behind him burst open, and all five Threadcaps whirled, hands at their belts. My heart leapt to my throat. It was too soon.
The taxi to Bridlington was swift, with Holmes and I sharing companionable silence as I looked over my notes for the case and he sat in thought. Over and over again, I envisioned the train from the night before, flickering from my sight as if it had been made an impermeable spectre. I’d never seen such a thing happen before, and as usual, I was absolutely burning with curiosity over what Holmes thought about it. And in his typical way, Holmes was stubbornly close-lipped around his own ideas of what we had seen, even at my prodding.
“I would not go so far as that,” I said, voice steady through the yawn and ache in my ribcage.
The two of us left Mrs. Marker and quickly left for the manor. We made up the stairs in short order and stopped right at the door, Holmes turning to capture my gaze.
“Fresh air,” I continued, listening for the tale of folding fabric and frowning at the sound of a strange tinkling instead. “Bird-watching...scenic walks...”
Hopkins lit up like a sparkler, delighted. “Mr. Holmes! However did you guess I came from Kent?”
” the man gasped, and Johann lurched forward. Both of them ran to each other, catching the other in an embrace that filled my heart like sunlight.
“Four exclusive contracts,” I repeated, shaking my head in disbelief as Holmes aided me into the cab with a bent arm. “Ambitious fellow, isn’t he?”
The admission, so new and so earnest, sends my pulse to thrum, rushing warmth through my veins. “The feeling is quite mutual, my dear Holmes,” I say softly. The corner of his mouth curls in a fond smile, and carefully I slide a hand beneath his proud chin and tip up his face to mine. I press my lips to his, wondering not for the last time over their profound smoothness, and I smile against his mouth when his own hands tentatively reach for me.
“Oh,” Fred whispered, looking practically starstruck. “Yes, these were Peter’s clothes, when he was my size. Mum died two years ago, and our da hasn’t shown his mug since before I were born, Peter says. But it’s why I know he’s in trouble, Mr. ‘Olmes, Peter looks after me! He wouldna just leave!”
“I would not encourage your men to risk,” Holmes said firmly. “If it is too dangerous—”
“I would not theorize without data,” said Holmes firmly. “But with all but the murder weapon in question, such observations may eventually prove…revealing.” Holmes’s mouth twisted upwards in my direction, a genuine smile of approval, but I could not bask long in its brilliance with mystery tugging at my friend’s attention. His gaze snapped back to the soaked grass, narrowed and glinting.
in my chest, hard and heavy with the truth of it. “But I fear what should become of me, if I hand myself to you, and your curiosity finds me lacking.”
” Holmes said witheringly. “It is merely a scratch.
“Do your great powers of observation detect falsehood in my word?”
At any rate, I dismissed Holmes's curious expression: his friendship has made a reluctant skeptic out of me, and I found it easier on the whole to have faith in his abilities and see the truth carried out in due time.
I inhaled sharply, and the oxygen seemed to dagger holes in my lungs. “I understand if you can no longer abide my presence here in 221B. My only request is that you withhold the truth from Mrs. Hudson. I could not bear—”
“As you know, I have amassed much by way of knowledge regarding the criminal underworld. The Threadcap gang is a minor operation, young, with footsoldiers that are easily bought and even more easily followed. Good fortune has it that I possess a short list of addresses of their warehouses for their smuggling already, but I have had no reason to bring about their arrest—yet. I’d say now is the perfect opportunity to bring their safe houses to the attention of our friend Lestrade.” His eyes simmered with amusement. “He will be a darling in the press. He may finally earn that promotion that’s been coming his way.”
“Then you did mark the scuffs on the chair legs?”
“I will be on my best behavior, Professor. Thank you for your time. I hope to return to you with promising news.” My friend bowed his head in goodbye, and with the Inspector, we swiftly departed the room.
“You enter the unreliable realm of speculation, Inspector,” Holmes lectured. “But I require more data to make certain of the facts. I should like to speak to the illustrious Professor, if he is in such a state to greet us. But first—” Holmes moved to the bedroom door and stuck out his head. “Ms. Tarlton, if you please!”
I reached the gates and my heart constricted in my chest at the sight of a postman on a single horse coming from the east, saddlebag thumping against the side of his mare. I was not a praying man, but I lifted up gospel to every deity of every culture than might be listening, and I sprinted towards him with my heart thundering in my ears.
“Petrice?” I asked, eyebrows moving to my hairline.
"For weeks I have been dreading the moment you decided to tell me you were leaving. At first, I did all I could to maintain your interest. I took intriguing cases, and when that did not seem to work, I stopped taking cases entirely. But the distance remained. It took whatever sleep I had left. I could not think of a way to keep you to stay. And I could not convince myself, if leaving was what you truly wanted, that I could stand in your way. My decision to hasten the end was sealed when..." Holmes paused, and muted agony flickered across his face. "When I realized what it would be like, to lose you to the violence of my work. I could not
“We have just murdered a constable and kidnapped a veteran," Anna said, shaking her head. "There will be no clemency for us. We do not want it, regardless. As for your Holmes..." She laughed again, and I swallowed hard at the sound of it. It sounded like death, cracking and aged and careless. "You’re so certain of him. And yet, here you are.” She twisted her wrist, my revolver digging into my side.
Professor Coram’s mouth gaped open. With some agitation, he extracted his tin of cigarettes from his blanket. “Truly?” he cried, and though his mouth stretched in a smile his pallor was draining to a shocking, cadaverous white. “Well! Well, that is wonderful, Mr. Holmes. Pray, have you solved this mystery?”
“Holmes,” I said, and he paused at the door. I swallowed away the stone in my throat, along with any other words I wanted to say. “Thank you.”
The moment the cab stopped, Johann hurtled from it like a man aflame. I lumbered after him, leg and shoulder aching fiercely after such a dogfight now that the adrenaline had faded, and when we finally made it up the stairs, I let loose a mountainous sigh of relief.
“I suppose you want us to come out sometime this afternoon?”
“I’ll fetch the bags,” I said, and grimacing, rolled my shoulders in preparation. “...And your blasted trunk.”
It is true that in the time since I first published, public following of my humble narrations has oscillated depending on any number of factors. Certain elements of drama, political events abroad, and even the turning of the seasons all pose impact on the vogue of my issues in the
“—And you are going to catch up on a month of sleep.
“I believe it’s time we head back to Baker Street, Watson, to discuss what I’ve learned.”
“Perhaps you should get some more rest,” he said. “The truth can wait until the morning.”
From the cottage, we saw the door swing open and reveal an elderly maid with long, white hair piled upon her head in an intricate, if messy, bun. “Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker. Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her, yes? I have a few…
“I have faced down tyrants and tsars,
“I see. I must ask you, sir, in the last few weeks, have you witnessed anything strange or peculiar? Anything out of place, or any unusual passengers?”
“You have no choice,” Holmes said. “But perhaps, if you explain your motives, you need not die there. You need not die
“Do not
“I wondered what sort of “important documents” Mr. Robinson might be keeping among his things, and he was right to desire them kept close. Their revelation is the only thing that would prove more ruinous to him than his prototype going missing.” He shot me a prideful glance. “A shame he did not invest in a sounder baggage lock.”
“I truly cannot say, Watson,” he said, eyes glittering with mischief. “It is beyond my powers as of yet—we need more evidence.”
As much as I had loathed the hours of academic discourse on beekeeping, I had deeply enjoyed our holiday on the whole. The time I had spent with Holmes had been restorative for more than just his health; it had done our partnership its own share of good as well. Even in Baker Street, we could not be as we were during those unbroken days in the country. Without Reginald’s presence, we had the run of the estate, and a level of privacy the likes of which I had never experienced with Holmes before. Our rooms had, by stroke of luck, been adjoined, so we had done as we pleased without fear of interruption or circumspection. Three weeks of stolen intimacy, I found, had replenished stores within my heart that I had barely realized needed filling. I had never felt so at ease as I did waking up in Holmes’s room at his side, my arm cast across a torso that had finally regained healthy weight, his quiet breaths a balm on my soul as his body recounted lost time by sleeping in.
“Damn it, Anna!” Coram spat. “Don’t you dare!”
they crooned, at such a silky and low timber that the room began to howl in approval. I recognized the Sullivan tune, but had never heard it in such a style. Transfixed, I watched as they moved forward across the stage towards the pianist, as confident and graceful as an opera star. They smoothed a gloved hand across his shoulders as he played, their painted lips stretching into a smile.
The man was perhaps fifteen, twenty years older than myself. His short, fine hair was grey and making its way to white near his temples. His beard was clipped close to the face and the color of ashy snow, and a pair of silver, stout spectacles sat perched on the end of his long, red-tipped nose. The man wore an expression of weary misery on his lightly wrinkled face, and greeted us with a muted degree of welcome. His eyes, however, absorbed most of my attention: they were dark as coal behind his glasses, piercing above bruising, sleepless circles.
Hopkins raced off on his newfound horse. I dragged Watson further up the bank, away from the water that had nearly stolen him from me, and gathered his freezing body in my arms, holding him as gently and as reverently as one held the most treasured thing in their world.
Deliberately, Holmes stepped into the space between us, eliminating all but inches. “I have been lax,” he said. A muted, tender fondness glimmered in his eyes. “With my own welfare, true, but in other respects as well.” The corner of his slender mouth curled, and I felt my face suffuse with warmth as his head craned downwards towards mine. “I apologize, my dear Watson, for the inattention.”
Swallowing through the dismay of dragging this on longer, my hand clenched tightly over my cane. “I meant only that I did not wish to make you uncomfortable, Holmes,” I said quietly. “With…with my feelings. With my affection for you.”
at the window, and I jumped in Holmes’s grip. A high, distant whistle echoed through the window glass, and Holmes released a sigh that only just trembled at the edges.
“I see...And you were travelling alongside this prototype to London last night.”
This particular moment would not last, however, as soon Holmes was tapping the master’s report with a gloved finger. “According to your report, good sir, there was a “special wagon” attached to last night’s train, destined for London. Do you know the details of this particular compartment?”
My chuckle was but a hair too loud. “No, my friend. I’m afraid you know all of me there is to know.”
“No, my dear woman, I’m afraid the lovely Ms. Tarlton uses a cheap but otherwise respectable bergamot extract. I don’t suppose you could account for such a scent? Is the Professor an aficionado of exotic fragrances as well as tobacco?”
“I understand it’s a distance. Your men will be paid for their trouble,” Holmes assured, lifting an eyebrow.
Holmes had turned to look at me. I was shocked to see that his eyes had lost their steel, and to hear a strange, uncertain thread in his voice.
His idle comments broke off and he paused at the sight of my no-doubt luminescent cheeks.
"Ms. Tarlton," said Holmes. "Do you perhaps know why Mr. Smith resided on the first floor, as opposed to one of the guest bedrooms up here and granted the privacy of the whole upper west wing?"
Watson," Holmes snaps, disapproval hardening his features. "If I am not permitted the blame for your nightmares, then neither should you be."
I recognized that spark in his eyes, and that rare, enraptured smile. For a single moment, I grieved for the warmth of Baker Street, because I knew we were unlikely to enter it tonight as we’d planned.
A perfectly assembled handcar. Completed with parts we’d found already primed for the purpose in the repair room, and fitted out with a massive light and whistle. I could barely believe I’d been fooled by it, even on so foggy a night as last night had been.
“No, I’m sorry,” Ms. Tarlton said, shaking her head. Holmes rocked back on his heels, expression going stormy with thought.
The man’s brow wrinkled in thought, and I dug my hands into my jacket to save them from the cold. It was so frigid outside I chanced a glance upward at the sky, half-expecting to see portents of snow on the horizon, but the sky was as pale and cloudless as a perfect summer day.
The girl in question was a young thing, perhaps twenty, and she practically quivered at Hopkins’s pronunciation of my friend’s name. Internally, I steeled myself at the sight of her admittedly lovely blushing cheeks; I had seen such reactions to my dear friend before and they rarely signaled favorable encounters for either of us.
Holmes gives chase.
“Only you would cast the concern of others as scheming, little brother,” Mycroft said, visibly amused, before his face returned to its solemn cast. “Regrettably, I must sabotage Doctor Watson’s valiant attempt to keep you from an early grave. Queen and country demand it.”
He opened his mouth, no doubt to say something else uncharacteristically foolish, and I cut him off. “And if my memory is correct, you even tried to give yourself in my place.” I squeezed his hand once more, remembering how frightened and angry I had been in that moment. “I could have strangled you for that, you know.”
“Ruinous how, Holmes?” I pressed.
“So you suspected the housekeeper.”
“You recognized that ring,” Holmes said. It was not a question. His eyes seemed to dig their way into my very soul. “It means something to you.”
I grimaced. "...Well. Yes. But it was only the one—”
We arrived at Chesterfield Station a half hour after lunch, a respectable spot of meat and cheese with tea at a small, charming baker’s shoppe nearby. Holmes was persuaded to eat a handful of crackers with gruyere and salted pork, sulking the entire while, until he all but dragged me out by the collar to return to the work.
“Good news, chaps,” he whispered, and Holmes pressed close behind me to hear the man, a warm line against my back. “The ladies have heard of your man, and are willing to talk to you before the next set ends. They’re waiting backstage, preparing for their sets.”
I awoke to the sound of an explosion.
“…Familiarity,” said I, hopeful to see my guess confirmed in my friend’s features. “With the grounds, or at least the path from the gate to the estate. Enough at least to navigate in the dark after such a stirring event as murder—” My voice lifted with excitement as another realization fell into place. “–and without her glasses after the attack, to boot! Could it be premeditated, Holmes?”
“Watson,” Holmes says, softening, and I pull away to smile tiredly at him.
“My brother exaggerates,” Holmes interjected. “No acts have been carried out. Only threats. And I assure you, the government Mycroft represents receives no shortage of those.”
But for justice. That would be permissible. Holmes would allow me that, wherever he existed now. I believed, even if he hadn’t, that good men found peace after death, and I believed too that eventually, I would find him again.
“Chesterfield station!” Holmes volleyed, clambering in after me.
“First of all, I scolded the ticket inspector. He asked the passengers to leave the train, and it wasn’t his right to do so even if he believed the tickets weren’t valid. And he was incredibly rude to them, it should be him taking the fury from these customers for his behavior!”
“You may be right about that,” the lad muttered. “Not to spread gossip, sir, but I’ve heard things about the Chesterfield station master. Several complaints from management about needing to follow regulations more strictly, as I’ve tried to do—and I think he’s the reason for their concern.”
Holmes lifted a roguish brow, and at any other time I might have cracked a smile. “You doubt my skills, Watson?” I crossed my arms, scowling at him, and he sighed. “Yes, yes, you have my word, my dear fellow. I will be the soul of subtlety. Understand I have no wish to draw the spotlight upon
“Holmes!”
“Ah!” I was dragged from such mental imagery as Holmes spun from the window and slid to his knees, studying the upholstered wooden chair sat next to Smith’s desk. Lifting it by the arms, he looked to me and tilted his neck to the side, gesturing for me to move, and in a sudden movement, swung the chair towards the window. He froze moments before connection, halting the chair in the midair. Promptly, he then returned it to the floor.
“Nothing so very special about it...at least, not that I can recall.” Sighing, Mr. Everett self-consciously plucked lint from his spotless uniformed cuffs. “My memory s’not what it used to be, gentlemen. But if you need it, I’m happy to give you the train composition report. The train was the standard liner from Nottingham to London. Coal engine, with a first and second class, and a post-car.”
I confess, it was not out of respect for my dear friend’s preferences that I abstained from the subject. No, I am afraid this evasion came from much more cowardly, selfish warrens within my heart. It served simultaneously as self-restraint and self-preservation, much connected to the pique that welled so irrationally within me at every admiring letter Holmes received. For my own sake, I did not prod Holmes for his thoughts on subjects of love or romantic ceremony. I did not pursue his rhetorical asides on the impracticalities of the human heart with questions of my own, as I did with most other perspectives my friend presented to me.
“You would not have,” I said firmly, but my heart was thudding hard and heavy in my chest. “You believe in
“A conspirator? You think there’s some plot at work, then. Holmes, really, if you have pieced together any sort of answer to that missing train—”
“Erhm, very good,” Holmes said, and with amusement I saw that his smile had strained somewhat at the corners beneath Fred’s ebullience.
Truths I knew, from the moment Fred lifted that green circlet from his pocket, would be dragged into the light. I had known for years that this moment was inevitable. After all this time, I had deluded myself into hoping the day might never come. But my deepest secrets had finally come knocking upon the door, and Holmes was to learn that which I had endeavored to conceal from him from the very first day of our friendship.
“Mrs. Marker,” my friend said, and there was a firmer quality to his voice that had me straightening over my tea. “Oblige my curiosity about the good Professor Coram. You have worked for him for many years now, yes?"
“You couldn’t have known,” I began to insist, and he cut a hand through the air.
“I see the guilt on your face, Holmes,” I say quietly. “There’s no reason for it.”
in my notebook.
“Sleep well, Watson,” he said quietly. And then he was gone, leaving me alone with exhaustion in my bones.
Impossibly, sleep took hold of me that night like the fist of Morpheus. It proved to be a blessing that I had not been kept awake, sleepless after a night of revelations that would have left me flightier than gossamer, for Holmes would wake me just before sunrise the following morning with a tentative touch to my shoulder, whispering it was time to put our plan into motion.
” My shoulders slumped. “
“Concern?” the man said. He threw his arms in the air with a great drama, evidently gratified to be listened to even as his green eyes burned with anger. “My
it, Watson."
"All will be revealed, Watson," said Holmes enigmatically, folding his hands. "But not until we are safe within the warm walls of Baker Street. Pray, give me time to think, and once home, I will share with you everything I have surmised."
“I would send you nowhere, Watson.” Holmes held my eyes, unaware that within his grasp was my heart, as well. “You have proven yourself to be a man of incomparable loyalty and character, and I would do my utmost to preserve our friendship through any difficulty. I am...humbled, to learn—and to keep secret—your nature, but know, my dear fellow, that it sends not a wave against the dam.”
“Very good, Wiggins,” Holmes said, lifting an expectant hand. Wiggins ambled over and handed a few scraps of parchment to Holmes, in exchange for a polished silver shilling. “Did you see the young Mr. Ables home safely?”
in fact carry my own things,” Holmes said, eyes glimmering above his scarf. “Your healing techniques, as it turns out, have some merit...”
“I’m alright, Holmes.”
“Yes. Unpleasant as he was, that man just provided us with crucial information, Watson."
Holmes narrowed his eyes, leaning like a general over the man’s desk. “And who were these workers? Were they familiar to you? Had they done work for the station before?”
“I suppose there is no harm in that,” I allowed, grinning. “But I shall make you no promises, should he return and request you vacate his seat.” I found myself blinking in surprise at the words as they left my mouth. The idea of Holmes witnessing this interlude was like a bucket of ice water dashed down my back. What would he even say, if anything at all? Would he be disappointed I deigned to waste my time on flirtation, when we were here on a case? He was working, and meanwhile I was indulging my loneliness with wine and an amorous American.
“Yes, sir. But not here at the station, sir. Down the way.” The station master gestured an arm south, pointed past the turnstile in the direction of London. “One of the railway warehouses, Mr. Holmes. It was burgled overnight, about four days ago.”
I stare at him. We had not even discussed that element of a relationship. "Are you suggesting—”
He was still. Cold and soaked and white as bone. Chest unmoving. Watson was silent. The pain in my chest was unspeakable.
“As am I. And that you rescued me so thoroughly, without great injury to yourself.”
Suddenly, Holmes blinked with some rapidity, and I watched as he looked about himself with strange surprise.
“Mr. Robinson,” said Holmes flatly, and I lifted my eyebrows. The person from the telegram was this rude gentleman! I studied him more intently, wondering how Holmes had deduced his identity from a glance. Wealthy clothes, that was to be certain. Were those...
“I swear to you that if you have no wish to indulge me, that you shall never suffer this line of inquiry again. I would not risk our partnership or your affection to satisfy my whims.”
“In fact I did sir,” said Hopkins proudly.
At a loss, I could only shrug my shoulders and sit in my burning curiosity for the long ride home, arms crossed tightly against my chest as our knees knocked together. For the entire journey, memories of our night in the Circle swirled in my head, a cauldron of hot feelings and growing self-recrimination. What I required was a night alone in my room and a tub of ice water, not space to think with my legs brushing against my friend's and Thomas's parting tease muddling my brains. When we finally arrived home, I clambered out of the carriage faster than a man with motion sickness.
Holmes lets out one of his low, diabolical chuckles, the mischievous sort that spells no end to trouble. “I shall work on my cunning, Watson.”
"Yes, sir, my husband and I, we worked and lived here with the previous owners, oh, for nearly fifteen years before that. Lovely family. The master worked for the government 'til he was offered a position abroad. I had familiar experience with the upkeep of the place, and I was so opposed to leaving the house in which I'd lived all these years with my Harry, the good Professor offered to keep me on."
," I echoed, eyes opening to see the great Sherlock Holmes flinch. Acid had crept into my voice, scalding away the cold. "Is that your excuse? That your manipulations aren't meant to confuse and mislead me, that so long as your curiosity is sated and you mean no harm, I'll be left untouched? Unbothered?" My voice had risen now, wounded pride and heartache tempering its strength like the heat of a forge. "For God's sake, Holmes, you cannot—you cannot be so cruel as that."
There have only been two times in my life where I have regretted putting my adventures with Holmes to paper. Both of these instances occurred on the same case, nearly two weeks ago, and leveled such an impact that I have questioned whether or not I can continue—in good conscience, and for either of our sakes.
“Yes, well. It’s little wonder he believed himself capable of solving such a thing,” Holmes said. Suddenly, his tone had become the strangest cross of dull and sharp-edged. His words were flat, but the voice carrying them had embraced a new, foreign acidity. "Reading your little stories, it seems as simple as looking about and leaping to conclusions. I suppose he fancied himself some clever action hero.”
“Don’t leave poor Wiggins waiting,” I said, smiling. I felt as if I were bleeding affection. “It’s cold as blazes out.”
“A copy of an insurance policy,” I said, eyebrows lifting. “A policy on Mr. Robinson’s invention! The ‘autonomous electricity generator’....Good lord, it’s insured for up to fifteen hundred pounds! Holmes, you don’t think—”
“I shall wait up for you,” he said, eyes softening. “I doubt I shall find much sleep this evening.” Immediately, the burden eased from my heart. I smiled, made warm as a hearth by Holmes’s offer.
“Mornin’, Mr. ‘Olmes,” said young Wiggins, looking as rumpled and cocksure as ever. It had been years since I first met the lad, and he had sprouted up like a weed, freckled and mop-haired. Soon he’d be too tall for the threadbare clothes on his body, and idly I wondered whether any of Holmes’s castoffs would suit the boy. “I got your message, and I took t’liberty of guessin’ why you might've wanted a meeting.” Holmes lifted an eyebrow, inclining his head, and Wiggins nudged the fellow at his side with a gentle elbow. “G’won then, Fred.”
Harrumphing, I did so, and frowned over the last lines of the document. “It says here that the loss or destruction of the prototype is only insured for up to fifty percent of its value. Still, Holmes, that’s a sizable sum.”
“Your clothes, young sir, are certainly second-hand, previously owned by another who was at some point your age—but they are not old enough to have been once owned by a parent, or new enough to have been recently bought used, in their state. Siblings are the most common source for clothing that’s passed down.” Holmes lifted a dark eyebrow. “As to his being responsible for you, I find it highly unlikely that a parent would allow their child to seek the services of a private detective alone, if they were aware their child was missing.”
“I’ll hear none of that,” I said, with sudden vehemence, and finally, he looked at me, eyes haunted but present, fixed to mine. “You saved my life, Holmes.”
“I knew the request to testify had upset you,” Holmes mutters.
air. Watson needed air, and if there was water in his lungs, it needed to be cast out. Frantic, I turned him on his side and struck him repeatedly at the lower back, desperate for him to cough. Limp silence met my efforts and panic slithered beneath my skin, reason disintegrating under impending and total grief.
Holmes’s eyebrow ticks upwards. “You may come to regret that invitation, Watson,” he says. I tip my head back in a easy laugh, and watch as his nerves visibly abate at the sound of it.
“Because you are a good man,” I said, and he closed his eyes again. Faintly, I thought I felt his hand just squeeze mine in return. “The best man I’ve ever known. A man I’m happy to follow, that I trust rightly with my life. For all your powers, you cannot see the future, Holmes. You can only observe and react to the present. You saved my life. So you will accept my thanks, and in return—” He looked back up at me, vulnerable enough to snarl my heartstrings, “—I will forgive you for trying to pass yourself off as a hostage in my place. It was terribly rude.”
” Holmes accused, storm clouds rolling across his countenance. “Heavens above, I thought they taught you to duck in the army—”
Holmes draws a conclusion, and secrets come to light.
I thought, nauseated with it.
have a plan.”
Could I? Could I sleep?
Satisfied I’d found nothing of import, I returned to the meeting room to find Holmes already waiting for me, and the riveted manner in which his gaze found mine told me his search had been far more successful.
” He said the phrase with the same disdain with which he uttered the words ‘marriage’ or ‘musical theatre’. “Truly I have mistepped, for I thought I had made clear that I was a man of science, of

I glowered, sharply tying my robe closed. "I don't suppose you could have waited to test your hypothesis until the
“We will require your home address, in case we need to reach you and search your home for evidence of your brother’s location,” Holmes said, and Fred nodded eagerly, rattling it off at rapid speed. I scrawled it down in my notebook, below the name of Peter’s place of work. “But for now, we will visit your brother’s place of work to interview his colleagues.”
"How am I to know?" Holmes asked, eyebrows furrowing, and he scowled. "It's not my intention to—do not mistake me. That was...enjoyable."
luggage on my person!”
“As you wish, sir," Ms. Tarlton said feelingly. "Thank you,” She curtsied and left us. I turned, watching her go, and looked back to see the Professor retrieve a polished cigarette case from beneath his blanket, which was wrapped around his legs from his chest to his shoes.
Distracted by the performance, I barely noticed as Thomas came up to my elbow.
“I’m happy to satisfy their curiosity,” Holmes purred, and I resisted the impulse to pinch the bridge of my nose as he slipped by and followed Thomas away. Discomfort and a quieter, more untoward feeling slithered in my stomach as he slipped out of sight, bedroom eyes tracing his shoulders as he went.
“Ms. Tarlton. Tell me, in the last few weeks, did Mr. Smith ever express any odd behavior in your presence? Any agitation? Concern, anxiety?”
This was unbearable. I could not tolerate tearing the bindings from this wound with such slowness. “It is a sign of membership,” I said. In self-preservation, emotion had abandoned my voice. “After admittance, and an oath of secrecy, one is awarded a ring such as that to act as a manner of entrance to a bar. An exclusive club out in Ratcliffe. The Emerald Circle.”
“I have these especially shipped from Japan,” said he, and I noticed as he spoke that his English had a curious quality, a foreign, mincing aspect that I could not place. “I order two hundred-case boxes at a time, and I grieve to say I have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight.” He rasped a laugh. “Bad, sir, very bad, but we all have our vices. Tobacco and my work, that is all that is left to me.”
sleep as well," I say, exasperated and minorly embarrassed. "I will be fine, Holmes."
“Whom among us is currently decimating London’s supply of humbugs?” he retorted.
“Poor lad,” I choked out. “Did he hit the ground hard?”
“...It will be three days now,” Johann said hoarsely. “They’ve had him three days.”
“Holmes,” I said warningly, and I almost regretted it when his motions over my hands stopped. He did not drop them, however, merely holding them in the space between us with an idleness that seemed subconscious.
I buried my own reaction to such a disparaging comment to the young lady, for it was nothing I’d not heard before from other men of the Professor’s standing, but for how little I knew Ms. Tarlton I could hardly say she was soft-headed. And having seen and held men as they died myself in war time, I knew all too well just how such traumatic memories could lodge themselves in one’s mind with terrible clarity.
Papers shuffling, the resounding click of a closing briefcase, and Holmes was sidling by me and closing the door behind him, as seamless as a snake.
“I hardly concern myself with the
“It is a crushing blow,” continued Coram unhappily. “Young Smith was helping me on my magnum opus. It is my analysis of the documents found in Coptic monasteries of Syria and Egypt, a work which will cut deep at the very foundations of revealed religion. With my health as it is, I’m not sure I shall ever complete it, now that my assistant has been taken from me.” He blinked eyes that had glazed in the smoke now permeating the bedroom. “Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Why, you’re an even quicker smoker than I am myself.”
“I’ve got the facts pretty clear. All I want now is to know what they all mean. The story, so far as I can make it out, is like this—some years ago this country house, Yoxley Old Place, was bought by an elderly man, a retired professor by the name Nicholas Coram. He's an invalid, keeps to his bed half the time, and the other half he moves about the house with a wheeled chair or he's pushed about by his gardener. He was well liked by the few neighbors who called upon him, and has the reputation of being a very learned man. His household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper, Mrs. Marker, and of a maid, one Susan Tartlon. They’ve both been with him since his arrival three years back, and they seem to be women of excellent character. The Professor, he’s writing a learned book, and he found it necessary about six months ago to engage a secretary. The first two were not successes, but the third, a Mr. Willoughby Smith, applied and was hired in September. He was a young man straight from university, and seemed to have been just what his employer wanted.”
“Perhaps not quite as much,” Holmes said, shadows crossing his face. I sigh again, and finally, I decide to close the distance between us by leaning forward and pressing my lips to that marble brow.
“Very well, sir. I will note this…behavior in my report, but comfort yourself with the knowledge I will mark you down as cooperative.” He narrowed his gaze. “Providing you have told us everything.”
*          *          *
I struggled to find the words with which to speak.
"How so?"
Holmes’s arm shifted and I watched his other hand search his breast pocket and retrieve a handkerchief. Promptly, he began to dab the cloth to his lips, wiping away color and leaving a smudge of pink on the ivory. The sight of it tugged at something within me, curling a hook around my diaphragm. Clenching my jaw, I raised an arm and hollered for a cab a tad louder than was necessary. My voice blasted its way through the crowd and secured us a ride, and as the two of us climbed in and Holmes's arm dropped mine, I ignored the feeling that something nameless and vital had just slipped through my fingers.
The sound of galloping hooves and Inspector Hopkins dragged me forcibly to the situation at hand, and whipping my head around, I quickly took stock. Coram was unconscious, having dragged himself to the bank and passed out from the pain.
I said, blushing furiously, and Holmes released a devilish little chuckle that did little to reduce my mortification. Moving to my feet with legs that were more unsteady than they should have been after only two glasses of wine, I dug into my pockets to leave money on the bar, and as I was doing so, Holmes hooked his arm around mine.
“I owe you no explanation,” she seethed. Her dark eyes blazed with fire and a conviction I had not seen in an age, not since the war, not since the eyes of the Afghans who moved to mutilate us where we lay dying in the field. “I owe you
I could bear it no longer. I leaned up, despite the screaming protest from my thrice-damned shoulder, and reached across the arm of my hospital bed once more for his hand. He allowed me to take it, and I squeezed it hard to drag him back.
"Is this alright?" I asked, now close enough to whisper in Holmes's ear.
“Here. She entered, came close, and she struck. The blade went deep.” With a closed fist, Holmes pressed a cool, gloved knuckle into the right side of my neck, not far from the artery. Unacknowledged, my heart fluttered in my breast. “But not deep enough. Smith gave a cry and managed to reach back—” A loyal puppet, I clapped one hand over Holmes’s where it pressed into my neck, and lifted the other backwards, reaching blindly behind me towards his face like one surprised and acting in self-defense. I managed to brush his cheek and bit back a foolish, nonsense smile at the feeling of skin.
“Sorry, old chap,” I said sympathetically. “But perhaps we need the break. It was only last week we settled that affair with that Huret fellow. Believe it or not, we are lucky that assassins do not come along every day.” Holmes snorted.
“Good Lord.” I shook my head, disdainful, as Holmes looked upon him as one might a stain on the carpet.
“Goin’ on eight or so months now,” said Quincey. “Business brought me to this island country of yours and will keep me here until the end of the year, at the least. Took me a couple of weeks to learn about this place. Helluva attitude your government has towards pubs like these, Doctor.”
At the crack of gunfire, my world fractured into panic.
“I see,” I said, and not for the last time that night, I summoned my courage. My eyes returned to his, engaging their attention unwaveringly. “Do you want to know it?”
Holmes lifted an eyebrow. “I presume it was you who placed the order for the ‘special’ wagon, Mr. Robinson?”
I bowed my head, eyes burning. “
“My name is Sherlock Holmes. And this is—”
“A long commute for a man to trek in the night hours, the Strand to the East End,” Holmes commented. He puffed experimentally around his pipe. “But worth it, I assume, to work in a safer neighborhood?”
“Very good,” I said, glad to hear that my friend's mood would not match the weather outside, and Holmes raised an eyebrow at me, eyes moving in that thoughtless, scanning manner of his down my body. I directed my attention elsewhere to keep myself from shifting under those smoke-colored eyes. Cold leached from the windows in tendrils, and the sound of rain was a low hum in my ears. Noticing the empty hearth, I gingerly stood to rouse a fire, and as I did so Mrs. Hudson, directly on time, brought in a tray with a kettle I could see issuing steam from a distance.
Holmes, for his sake, looked unmoved. Still he circled about the perimeter of the Professor’s quarters, smoking like a Bristol chimney, but at a more sedate pace. “Ah. An understandable mistake to make under such circumstances, wouldn’t you agree? You don’t have an explanation yourself for this tragedy?”
I watched as Holmes flushed a mottled scarlet. “I…Yes. But I do not know my own limits.” The confession clearly was a source of embarrassment and deep underlying frustration. “I never experienced the desire to…touch another person, before you. I cannot tolerate the touch of others as it is. But over time, I have become accustomed to your occasional tactility, and I…do not dislike it.”
It was only through years in the service that I managed not to cry openly. This was more than I had dreamed of. I was so moved I could barely speak, and underneath it, I felt a relief so powerful I felt weak. I felt joy. I felt foolish,
“Fascinating,” I managed, and his mouth twitched with a small smile that I could not help but return. He had not possessed the energy to smile in so many weeks, since that damnable forger had taken so much of his time and focus, and I could almost see the full spirit of the man returned to those smoke grey eyes at last. I felt, not for the first time, deeply grateful he had finally agreed to this trip, and that he had received invitation recently from a colleague to visit somewhere removed from the city's relentless stressors.
"We won't damage your little plaything, Mr. Larssen," the man sneered. "He is in good company. Safe as houses—"
Flinging myself upwards in bed, I strained my ears through sudden silence and heard only the thundering of my pulse. The morning was abruptly quiet, my bedroom still and sun-lit yellow, and for a moment I wondered whether the sound had been real at all.
“After you were taken?”
“I already did it, sir! I turned the place over lookin’ for a letter from ‘im in case I missed it!” The boy looked near-ecstatic with his success, and I bit my lip at Holmes’s blink of surprise. His elegant solution to keeping the boy at home and out of harm’s way was foiled out the gate, it seemed.
“Though I have yet to meet the housekeeper, I can say soundly that Ms. Tarlton has fine vision, and does not fit our profile.” I could not help but notice that this was neither a confirmation or denial of Hopkins’s assessment, and I found myself again wondering at the possible suspicion Holmes could have regarding the grieving maid. But, it was often the case that Holmes would hoard his theories until the moment of revelation, and I consigned myself to the possibility I would not know until the murderer herself was in police cuffs.
“Mr. Holmes? Doctor Watson?”
Holmes blinks, and with a minor hesitance that I can only find terribly endearing, he moves to edge of my bed and carefully sits down, facing me. The distance between us is tantalizingly little, but I do not reach forward to close it. Something has crawled beneath Holmes’s skin this morning, if the dark circles beneath his ashen eyes me speak no better.
“I will not have it, Holmes. You are finally well, and I intend to keep you that way.”
“Old ‘nough sir, he just turned twenty years.” I swallowed a rueful smile. Twenty would seem old to such a young boy, but to me, it seemed barely out of childhood. But then again, most of the lads I had enlisted with had been younger than that.
“Oh my—”
“To the gate, opening onto the main road to Chatham.”
“Gentlemen,” Holmes said. His voice betrayed nothing of his concern as he turned on a prim heel, carefully setting the silk ring down upon the tea table. “Watson and I have much to do, and must discuss this case amongst ourselves. Wiggins, if you would kindly escort Fred home and bring back those letters he found?” He reached for a spare shilling on the mantle, palming it to the older boy.
The man's confidence gave way in half-hearted contrition. “Forgive me, I should have introduced myself first and spared you the discomfort. Quincey Mulberry, a pleasure. I meant to make your acquaintance when last I saw you here, but I’d not seen you come by in some time.” His accent, American and gravelly, was as unfamiliar as it was pleasant.
after a life where discipline, logic, and data have been my only chosen masters, yet it is as undeniable as it is fundamental. I cannot marshal them any more than I can curb my need for oxygen or my itch for the syringe, and I have
"Holmes,” I said gently. “May I...put my hands on you?"
"You learned all you wanted to know?"
Holmes looked downwards, avoidant. For a figure I had seen tower over lesser men, he looked to me then strangely wary and thin. "For all our years of friendship, there are things which we simply do not discuss. Our families. Our childhoods. Banalities, which hold little interest to me and little use to you in discussion. There are elements of myself that, for much of my life, I have been content to ignore. But recent events...they have caused me to wonder."
“For God’s sake, Sherlock. What the devil are you dragging about, an entire wardrobe? It’s Staffordshire, not the blasted frontier.”
“I love you,” I said. Now that I had leave to say it, I found that I wanted nothing more than to do so, over and over again. I reached for his face, tracing a cheekbone with a calloused, copper-smudged hand. “More than anything on this earth.”
and I am here.”
Within moments, the young woman appeared, looking only mildly flustered at Holmes’s obstreperous summoning. “Yes, Mr. Holmes?”
My eyebrows lifted despite myself. Holmes created deserts of ash in our apartment with much less consideration to our dear Mrs. Hudson every week; as astute as my dear friend was, his courtesy to his environment often left much to be desired.
“Excellent!” He opened the door and sang for our Mrs. Hudson, his powerful voice rippling down the hallway. “
“You really are in a state this evening, Watson,” Holmes replied. I looked heavenward for patience.
“Your older brother,” Holmes clarified. “Your caretaker.”
“Ahhh,” the man said, visibly crumbling. “I—ohh. That’s....” His shoulders slumped. “Fine. I apologize, Mr. Holmes. I’ll tell you all I know.”
It was not yet nine thirty a.m., and my friend sat folded in his armchair with a scowl eminent for a man so inundated with criminal delights. His Stradivarius was half clutched to his chest but his bow was nowhere to be seen; Holmes did his best thinking with the violin in hand, but music was not always a necessary component to his ruminations. (Out loud I have teased my friend that the instrument is the closest thing to an infant child that Holmes will ever call his own, and privately, I regard the unconscious comfort he finds in holding it with no little fondness.)
Wiggins clapped a hand on the young boy’s shoulder. “Told ya ‘e would believe you, Freddie. Mr. ‘Olmes can smell foul doings a mile off.”
“It most certainly will, as long as I am here,” I insisted.
"I see. Tell me, madam, has the Professor ever been married?”
The man's thin lips curled into a switchblade smile. "That all depends on you, Mr. Larssen."
I thought, and meant it to be cruel. Silence greeted me then, seeping in from the uncaring room around me, and I almost regretted spurning Holmes’s spectre even knowing it was a fiction. Baker Street was so quiet. I missed him in my bones, and I thought then I might have done anything to keep him, even if he were only a fragment of my own mind.
"No, but your trunk will wound
“I will fetch a cab—” And when he opened his mouth to speak, I steamed directly over him. “And we will be leaving your lab in our
Holmes turned to me, blinking, his attention honing on me with narrow, but not cutting, intensity. In his eyes, thought moved in visible grey waves, then his noble brow smoothed in an expression almost approaching regret.
All three heads in the room swiveled to Holmes, who was puffing at his pipe with energy. “No leads, no evidence of foul play but for the manner of his disappearance, and no crime scene to examine,” he muttered, and I turned my head to give him a look that said clearly,
“This side, sir.” He pointed to the side at our right. “This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flowerbed. Gone now, but clear to me then.”
” Holmes insisted, hand seizing mine. “I know my own body, and it has known worse wounds than these.”
“It was never my intention to conceal my nature from you.” Pain stole the volume from my voice. “But I have seen recrimination and violence too many times to risk revealing myself before knowing your character. With time, it grew too late to tell you the truth. I was afraid the confession would lead you to draw conclusions about my...living here, with you, and the possibility of...” I shook my head, cutting myself off before I dug the hole too deep to escape. “The truth of it is that I had come to enjoy your companionship too much to risk revealing my preferences to you. Your work amazed me. I felt more alive at your side, watching you solve cases, than I ever had in the months after returning from Afghanistan. I was afraid, and so I did not tell you.”
The question froze me in my tracks, and so did the hesitation in it.
He leaned forward, eyes sincere, to whisper in my other ear. “It appears you have your hands full this evening, doctor. Perhaps next time.” And with a wink, Quincey Mulberry was gone. With a satisfied expression, Holmes slithered like an eel into the spot he had vacated.
A wry eyebrow lifted in response. “The stubbornness of soldiers. One might consider it hypocritical, in certain circumstances.”
Holmes’s attention turned to me, and his smooth voice faltered. I felt my stomach plummet as those London fog eyes fixed upon me, absorbing my rigid expression and the layers of data stored within it with that determined, uncanny skill I knew I had no chance of diverting. That militant mind would seek out and reveal any secret I could ever attempt to hide, interpreting their meanings and disseminating their truths without hesitation or slightest effort.
Hopkins’s expression flickered with defiance, but he was a better man than he was a swashbuckler, and so he followed the instructions, removing his irons from his belt.
Pressing his lips together, Mycroft tapped his cane with wrinkled consideration. A beat, and the great man sighed, bowing his head. “Despite appearances, Doctor, I do care for my brother’s welfare. But as transcriber of his many successes, you acknowledge his talents are of immeasurable use in moments of crisis.”
“Do you really think he’s hiding something, Holmes?” I asked quietly, catching up to his arm.
“Do not move, or I shall drink it all,” she hissed. The three of us froze. “I won’t be taken to your English prison. I will not!”
“Ah.”
"Oh, hush," I hissed, and Holmes lifted an ebony brow.
"The Professor's room is just here, sir," she said, pointing left down the east hall. "This closed door is a linen closet. The west hallway is more guest rooms, yet, three in number with a bathroom at the north end of the west hall. Downstairs is the sitting room of course, sir, and the Professor's study, and another storage room for Mrs. Marker's use. The west wing houses the kitchens, the dining room, the game room and the Professor's library."
“Thank you. What shall we do then, until the evening comes?”
Slowly, Holmes reaches across the space between us. His slim fingers find my other hand, and I close my eyes. Unconsciously, my free hand had crept up to my neck, brushing yellow bruises that had finally begun to fade to the normal color of health. Gently, his touch replaces mine, sending goosebumps down my spine as he traces the column of my neck down to the line of my collarbone.
My eyes moved to his face, and I found I could not recall to blink. Holmes’s eyes, which were striking alone with their singular, silver color, seemed somehow more arresting than before. I realized, with shock, that it was because they had been thinly lined with some sort of kohl. It would be invisible on the dark street, but in the low light of the Circle it would be finely noticeable, and it was terribly becoming. The brilliantine that normally slicked his hair back had been washed away to leave Holmes’s hair oddly loose and thick, almost as it was in the evenings and early mornings after a bath, but it had been smoothly combed in a classical coif. In a particularly foolish impulse, I imagined my fingers carding through those locks, determining their apparent softness for myself, and I tore my eyes away to inspect further. In effort to disguise his features, Holmes had masterfully applied hair from his sideburns down to his chin and around his mouth, forming a short, ebony beard and moustache.
It couldn’t be true
The lack of a crime scene to investigate did not fill me with optimism, but my curiosity burned all the brighter. “This case becomes stranger and stranger, Holmes. First, someone steals a warehouse full of railway tracks, and then an entire train disappears almost a week later!”
“No, it was all trodden into mire.”
Holmes essayed a small smile. “And as always, you flatter me. I will tell you all, then. You shall be gratified to know that your observation once we arrived was crack on the beam. In order to know where in the manor Smith was residing, to navigate the interior of the house, and to take the wisest footpath to the gate, one required an intimate, undeniable knowledge of the premises. More to the fact, the motive which so eluded our inspector Hopkins hinged on the killer entering Yoxley Old Place to commit murder.”
He twitched backwards, almost in a flinch, and I jerked back my hand, surprised and burned by the reaction.
“What?”
Sympathy welled in my chest like an icy spring. “Have faith in Sherlock Holmes, Johann,” I said, coming close to clap a hand on his shoulder. “We have a plan to save Peter and rid yourself of the Threadcaps. For good.”
That was one of the better ideas Holmes had ever had. I needed fresh air, and the night cool to marshal my self-control.
Holmes shook his head, disappointed. “To think I had hope you realized its value over our holiday. Very well, but I won’t hear your complaints should we be forced to waste time and return all the way here should we need to use it.”
“No, no, I never, Mr. Holmes, I
"Your young friend has spotted us. Will I have to deter him as well?"
In the corner of my eye, the constable shook his head—with disbelief or suspicion, I could not tell. “Alone?"
“Let’s have it, then!”
“Good lord,” he said, taken aback. “You cannot mean to say that Mrs. Marker—”
Chesterfield was the smallest of all the modest towns along the line we had seen so far, and its station—though identical to its sisters in nearly every respect—was dark and quiet when we arrived. The sun outside had vanished behind mounting nimbus clouds, a curtain of darkness rolling across the placid English plains, and inside I could not help but notice how unwelcoming the place felt in comparison to its neighbors along the London route. Its hearth was middling, unattended, and the cool temperature from outside leaked into its walls to drape a low, unpleasant sort of chill around us as we approached the ticket counter in the empty hall.
"Be careful," said Holmes, expression tight. Yesterday, the thread of concern for me would have rattled me to my core. Now, it only fueled my determination to see this done, and to see out what would become of us, now that the truth of our affections had been shared.
“Wilshem, sir, just off the A...Ah. The Ah-dephi pier, sir.”
“Surely my deductions are simplicity itself,” Holmes said. His tone was as close as it ever deigned to modesty, but his expression was cocksure and luminous at my praise. “It would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses—especially so remarkable a pair as these. That they belong to a woman I infer from their delicacy and style, and also, of course, from the last words of the dying man. As to her being a person of refinement and well-dressed, they are, as you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold, and it was inconceivable that a woman who wore such glasses could be poor in other respects.  You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose, as they were for mine, indicating a particularly broad base. Typically, such a nose is usually short and coarse, and while there are exceptions to this, I am fairly confident. My own face is a narrow one, and yet I find I cannot get my eyes into, or near, the center of these glasses. Therefore, the lady’s eyes are set very near to the sides of her nose. You will perceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength. A lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoulders.”
I gaped. “But you only just said—”
“I need you to ensure Johann’s safety, Watson. You and Johann will meet the Threadcap representatives in a neutral location. The Yard will wait at a distance to arrest them, but
“I am a man of my word.” At that, he took a pointed sip of tea, and with somewhat less fervor, took a single slice of toast and nibbled experimentally, holding my gaze the entire while with one eyebrow raised.
Holmes bent his head in a rippling chuckle. “Mmm, forgive me,” he said, eyes twinkling, “you know how I enjoy building up to my deductions. The second vital clue my newfound friends delivered to me was much more revealing. The lover, Watson.” Holmes stepped closer to me, head bent with furtive delight. “If rumor is to be believed—and I do indeed find its sources credible—then Peter’s new lover is none other than the Circle’s owner.”
Johann appeared ten minutes after I did.
Watson,” he said, and when he turned back to look at me, he was almost returned to normal. But his small, reassuring smile did not touch his eyes, and my heart snagged at their flat, emotionless deception. “I will return in the morning.”
"John," he said, his rugged face pale and hard. Holmes’s observations ringing in my mind, I could see the strain splintering beneath the surface of his expression. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. "You could have told me what you and your partner were doing."
“For God’s sake, Hopkins, hold her!” Holmes said, reaching for the other arm as the woman buried her clenched fist in Hopkins’s chest with shocking force, doubling him over. From where I stood awe-struck at the woman’s energy, I saw movement in the corner of my eye, and when my eyes traced it to its source my heart suspended in my chest.
“If you believe for a moment,” said Holmes, “that I would cast you out for something beyond your control, I have failed in my friendship to you.”
Mr. Robinson suddenly looked as if he were edging towards a fit, his complexion flaring a deep red. “For God’s sake, sir, it’s priceless! They’re lucky I was willing to part with it for the price we agreed upon! It could change the very world we live in!” The man sighed in a heavy gust, and his spine stiffened as he composed himself. “But I’m a humanitarian, you see. I was willing to give it up for sale for a decent price, so the world could make use of what I’d created.”
Fred hopped off the couch, and after a beat of clear hesitation, he nervously tottered forward to wrap his arms around Holmes’s dark trouser leg.
“Mr. Larssen,” the man said, eyes like obsidian below the brim of his cap. “We are so pleased with your decision to work with us. I’m sure your...friend will be relieved to hear it.”
“My darling,” Coram said. “You know better, than to try and leave this world without me.”
“I’m sorry,” I whispered. My throat caught on a sob. “I’m
“Ah.” I did so, and began to read. “It appears to be…a diary entry, of sorts, not a letter. He’s writing about his experiences at the Circle.” When the first was written, Peter Ables seemed to be a new member: his writing was enthused as he recorded his joy and gratefulness in finding such a place where he could meet others like himself. I moved to the next page, and found something more interesting, and distinctly more private. “Hmm. It appears that Mr. Ables had fancied someone he met at the Circle.” I moved to the next letter, and soon felt the tips of my ears heat. “Ah. The feeling was…quite mutual, it seems.”
“Promise of compensation should renew your energy,” Holmes said. “But I would advise you concentrate your efforts to the docks and Ratcliffe parish.” At the latter, Wiggins’s nose wrinkled.
The last flicker of life left the man’s visage and his face went entirely to stone. In an instant, there was the sudden thump and creak of hinges, and I gawked as one of the overfull bookcases alongside the bedroom wall swung open, and a woman rushed into the room.
“Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.”
“Tell me, Mrs. Marker, did you notice anything strange about Mr. Smith’s behavior these last few days?” my friend asked.
I said pointedly.
“My sleep was…disturbed some hours ago,” I say, reluctantly, lips pressing together. I am not in the practice of admitting such weakness to others, but Holmes is no longer only a friend—if he had ever been merely that. “I did not wish to wake you for something so simple as a nightmare, so I sat in bed to write until morning.”
“And what did you infer?”
Holmes returned by half past two, and with effort, I managed to convince him to swallow down some tea and one of Mrs. Hudson’s excellent pastries (baked fresh upon learning that young Wiggins would return later in the afternoon). Holmes had come home with some purchases in a small bag from a store I did not recognize the name of, and his very body seemed to crackle with anticipation for the night’s investigation. I was in the middle of telling him about the Circle’s neighborhood and culture—with as much respect for my fellow members' privacy as I felt was due—when Wiggins entered our sitting room, a scone already lodged in his mouth.
"And...if it is within you," I ventured gingerly, "tell him where you have been going in the evenings."
I thought, and bit down a chuckle of near-hysteria
“We near theatrics now, my dear fellow.”
“There is no one that we cannot account for,” Hopkins continued. “It’s not an unreasonable walk to town. Anyone might stay there, take a train without being observed. It isn’t so small a township that the locals note every stranger, either.”
“You are of the opinion, then, that a train cannot simply disappear?”
Devastation carved its way through my very bones.
I sighed, knowing that it was unlikely for us to stumble across a modest country delicatessen on the way. “Once more onto the breach.”
“Good lord. What the devil was he doing, storing them in his home?”
on the cliffside alone with my life on the line. It was possible. It was more than possible.
The complaint, which had been seemingly aired to the entire waiting room at large, did not go unheard by my friend. Perking up like a collier, my friend alighted to the side of the irritated customer, who was standing beside a parcel of luggage with a foul expression of indigence on his face.
I breathed into him, giving my everything too late, and when my lungs were spent I collapsed upon him, shuddering.
Overcome with fondness, I stretch my hand across the sheets to find his. I entwine his cold fingers with mine, my heart overfull.
Not unkindly, I looked at him and thought he looked terrible. His face was pale as a sheet, though not the fearful chalk-white from before, and his eyes looked cavernous over deep, sleepless circles. Sitting in a chair at my bedside, he seemed gaunt, and my heart twisted in my ribcage to think of him lingering there, likely going without sleep or food until I woke.
"Merely to establish trust," said the lieutenant, benignly spreading his hands. "We want to see our mutual business flourish. This is an opportunity for you, Mr. Larssen. Our liquor is quality, friend. In exchange, we only require your taps, your storerooms, and your silence. Your friend will be returned to you intact if you can demonstrate your compliance in this partnership of ours."
(I am a cautious man. For all that I love the thrill of the chase over cobblestones, I am, ultimately, a man of careful action. I would make a poor doctor otherwise. So I do not exaggerate when I say my next action happened without thought or care for consequences. I acted, in a moment of emotion, on a total impulse.)
“I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us,” said Coram. “To a poor bookworm and invalid like myself, such a blow is paralyzing. I seem to have lost faculty of thought! But you are a man of action—a man of affairs. I have read your biographer's stories. Such shocking events are a part of the everyday routine of your life. You have a soldier’s steadiness, and can preserve your balance in every emergency! I envy you, sir. But we are fortunate in having you at our side, Mr. Holmes, on the hunt for this foul brigand.”
“A heavy load, then,” I surmised. “Perhaps the rail company came to look at the scene of the crime, see what left there was to salvage? Maybe it was why the warehouse was disassembled—after the theft, what was left of it was needed for construction elsewhere.”
I ripped it back, cocked the hammer, and aimed. Coram's expression dissolved into terror. Without hesitation, I fired one round each into both of his legs.
to catch up to them enroute, it was Watson’s best chance—
“It is you, Watson, or no one.” His voice was guarded, quiet, but in the space between us, after years of Holmes sequestering his emotions below the surface for fear being seen as a man who bled like any other, every word rang loud and clear and surreal. “I trust no one else. Desire no one else. It is you I’m curious about, who occupies my mind and attention like no other.”
"John!" Thomas cried, sidling through the crowd. "Are you leaving already?"
“It is possible,” Holmes allowed. “However, as Ms. Tarlton so helpfully explained, the storm was so loud last night she almost mistook Mr. Smith’s shout for the wind, and did not head downstairs herself until
“No, you are right in that. Gruner exercises too much fear over them. He is powerful and they know well he could reach them even behind bars, with his connections and his wealth.” He tilted his head to look at me, eyes burning with a calculating light. “Which is why, my dear man, I have formulated a plan.”
I buried my eyes in the heel of my palm. “You cannot be serious.”
Holmes sighed. “...In the morning, we will review, and I will confirm your meeting spot with Johann.” He stood unmoving, watching me intensely as I moved towards the door to the stairs.
“Peter Ables is a fellow female impersonator at the Circle, Watson. It explains why you never recognized him, and did not remember his name from your time there.”
“I’m afraid I cannot say yet, Professor Coram,” Holmes said, and exhaled a plume of smoke through his thin lips. “But I assure you, I plan to investigate the matter thoroughly.”
he said.
"How on earth—"
“I see! But Holmes, I believe you’re skirting the more pressing details.”
There was no doubt from where we were standing. The train was gone. Somehow, the very night had swallowed it away to nothing, with only the shriek of a far whistle and hint of light to suggest it had ever been there at all.
sir?” Holmes asked.
"Have you formed a hypothesis?" I asked, when I could recall words through the heady feeling clouding my mind.
“Do not worry.”
“East End, sir. Old Nichol.” I pressed my lips together. One of the poorer areas in a particularly impoverished neighborhood. I knew as well as any Londoner the state of the East End, but the idea of children like Fred living in such squalor was a grim thing: a reminder, of the desperate state of living for so many of English citizens.
“Of course you did,” Holmes said, smiling benignly. “Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about the case?”
By the time we arrived in the right neighborhood a half hour later, the London streets were dark and animated with streams of nightgoers, a mixture of working and upper class, young and old coming alive to seek entertainment or survive in the seedier allies of Ratcliffe. To prosper, clubs like the Circle were confined to areas such as these, where working girls stood sentinel at every street corner; the community flourished best where shadows were wanted, and where bureaucracy turned its blinder eye.
“Land and liberty,” Holmes said gravely.
“I am here to be used,” I said immediately, and the wicked glint in his eye faded, softening to something much more fond.
“I know, Watson.”
Holmes looks somewhat put out as I climb to my feet, his hair ruffled from lack of sleep, crisp robe wrinkled, lips pink with stimulation. For years I had thought Holmes to be the most handsome man I had ever come across, and long believed he was at his most lovely in the throes of victory. Now, I have cause to revise that belief. Holmes never looks more becoming that he does disheveled, pupils blown, and looking at me like I am something wanted. I am lost to that look, just as I am lost to the open affection on his face, and so I cave to my baser impulses. I stoop as well as I am able after a sleepless night and cup his face, thumbs sliding across his noble cheekbones as I draw him in for another kiss.
“I would say so. How did the other raids go?” I asked, wincing as I tucked my gun back into my belt. Blood, hot and dark, stained my unscarred shoulder, weeping crimson above the bone. It hadn’t struck anything vital, but it hurt like the very devil.
“No.”
“Or at least…I believe I do,” Holmes finished, and for a moment anger flickered across his face, rolling darkly across his expression like thunder. “It is beyond me. Beyond my comprehension, beyond my experience. It seems I no longer know myself. I feel things for you in a language I do not know how to speak. I experience urges that would imperil the sanctity of my partnership with you, which I value above all things. I’ve lost control, Watson.”
At that, the two of us migrated towards the ticket window. The young uniformed fellow, recipient of Mr. Robinson’s ire, watched us wearily from behind the barred window as we approached.
“I see,” I said, with as much rigidness as I could muster. I could not bear to fall to pieces before him and so reached for my history in the service, the detachment of setting bones, staunching blood, and marching through the dead.
, Logic insisted, but for once I damned its sense—was passerby, and I had no time to lose,
find, Mr. Ables. You’ll make a detective yet.” Fred beamed, pink with pleasure at the compliment. “We will require those letters posthaste, it is possible they are of supreme importance. But until then, Watson—”
"Professor Coram will see you, Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes."
“…Very well,” I said, very likely sealing my fate. Within my flawed skeleton my heart rejoiced, and my mind cursed my weakness.
Holmes turned from me, facing away as if he could not bear to look at me. “It matters no longer," he said, brittle. “Your stories are inconsequential. After all, your muse no longer shines for you as it once did. You will write no more.”
He shook his head. “If motive for the crime had been merely to obtain an object in his possession, the Corams could have taken it at any point using much less drastic measures. No, his death—his silence—was the point of it. The object, whatever it may have been, was merely a loose end they needed to resolve.”
“What can I do to thank you?” Johann asked.
"Look sharp, Watson, we shall be entertaining visitors within a quarter hour. I believe Mr. Hemingway’s case can wait for us to hear out another."
“The first performance should be starting soon." I said. "Shows start at the same time every night." I looked around, and the bartender caught my eye almost immediately, as if he had been waiting for my signal. “We should make an effort to blend in.”
“We shall go back to Evesham, then,” I said, sighing with no little amusement. “But then we shall rest, Holmes.” I found my eyes tugging towards the sky, my lips pressing together. “I do not like the look of the storm brewing.”
“A businessman,” the man said proudly. “And an engineer. I’ve already found several potential customers for my invention, but I was very optimistic about the director's board of buyers who were travelling on the train last night.”
“What a gloomy night,” I said unhappily, shivering as the evening fog pooled around our knees. “What are we doing out here, Holmes? It was warmer in the waiting hall.”
“I know the place because I have been there,” said I. “Several times. I am a member, Holmes. And I have a ring just like that one, hidden in my wardrobe.”
“Eavesdropping? If he is not responsible for Peter’s disappearance then—” I rubbed my hand with my jaw. “By Jove. He is searching for Peter too. He knows his lover is missing and seeks to find him.”
Immediately, I saw that Professor Coram was not where we had left him. He was in his chair, still, but rather than by the window as before, he sat across the room near the one of his overflowing bookshelves, and he startled in his seat at our sudden entrance.
“Is that all?” I asked dryly. “You need only narrow down a list of buildings across London that are impossible to look into, sneak in unseen, free Peter, fight off any gangsters, and emerge unscathed before the police arrive. How perfectly simple.”
“We appreciate whatever information you can offer us about last night’s events, Ms. Tarlton,” said Holmes, and there was a sharpness to his attention on her that gave me pause. Perhaps he did not trust everything she’d given in her statement to Hopkins? I looked to the girl and saw only an earnest, fragile young woman, but as a man who’d loved a brilliant woman and who’d encountered many more, I knew better than to underestimate the fairer sex at any glance.
experiments, or this ridiculous trunk. Heaven’s sake, Holmes, you’ve even packed
However, I am burdened to admit that November of last year led the both of us to view my modest productions, and the public esteem attached to them, with notably less favor.
“Some twelve, thirteen hours. It will be morning soon.”
“Yes. Why?”
"It's been a very productive evening, Watson," said he, with visible relish. Carefully, he began to peel away the false facial hair clinging to his face. "This case runs deeper than I had imagined."
I had seen them perform before, and I leaned back with my wine glass to listen, gladly, as the crowd died down and June began to sing.
I opened my mouth but did not immediately find the words. “I don’t…” I said, trailing off in confusion. “Why do you…”
“I—I believe so, yes,” Mrs. Marker said, and indeed, she looked decisively cornered. “I do think he was at one point, Mr. Holmes, but before my service to him. She passed away, oh, goodness, I believe it was a decade ago now? He—he does not speak of it readily, sir.” She attempted to soak up the spilled tea with a fetched terry cloth, but in her haste only managed to spread it about. “Pray, sir, why do you ask?”
“I have forged and tested every link of the chain, Professor Coram, and I am sure that it is sound. What your motives are, or what exact part you play in this strange business, I am not yet able to say. But in a few minutes, I imagine I shall probably hear it from your own lips.”
“Good God,” said Mr. Robinson, all but snatching the paper from Holmes’s hands. “The policy—where did you find this? It shouldn’t have left my pocket!”
“An experiment?” I echoed, and Holmes did not pause to explain, and I was helpless but to follow his trail back to the station master’s office.
“Holmes, what have you determined?” Hopkins asked, eyes bright with the possibility of newfound clues.
"Am I so predictable? I haven't been here in months!"
“My dear fellow, you read my mind.”
“At the point where the path passes through the gate, then, you could surely pick up the tracks.”
“It is a very remarkable performance,” he said lowly. “Very remarkable.” Without provocation, he began marching down the path with us in tow, his voice lifting once more in the crisp country air. “Let us go farther, then! The entrance gate is usually kept open, I suppose? Then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. But we cannot assume the killing was premeditated, Watson—however could she have anticipated murder, and yet armed herself with a weapon from inside the house, the Professor’s own study knife? If she had planned it ahead of time, she would have armed herself better, correct?” This last observation was a quieter aside, posed to himself, and clearly, the question was a challenge which invigorated him, judging from the spryness of my friend’s pace.
"Bedsharing may help," he offers, peering at me from the corner of his eyes. "If anything, I could be nearby to offer distraction until you fall asleep again."
“I merely forgot my gloves,” I protested, smiling despite my best efforts. “I’m hardly
That was answer enough. Holmes leaned forward, eyes glittering like a hunter’s upon glimpsing sign of weakness. “Let me speak frankly, Mr. Bertram,” said he, voice as smooth and cool as a winter brook. “Your age, and your lack of confidence in your position, are both quite apparent. You cannot deny that you have only recently completed your studies. Your instruction booklet is still in your front pocket.”
The man’s dark eyes glittered with an amusement that sickened me. “Aye. And he’ll not stop til he has his way. Maybe now your detective will listen, eh, Doc?” He slowly raised his stick. “If he lives to see what I do to ya, anyways.”
“And where is that?”
man with expensive drink?” I asked, bewildered.
Her accent was thick and foreign, and I recognized in it the same inflections as the Professor’s. Her face, pristine with careful makeup, displayed the exact physical characteristics that Holmes had divined, but she was younger than I had imagined, closer in age to the Professor who looked upon her with what could only be devotion shining in his pitch-black eyes.
“The Professor himself declares that he woke to the cry and heard the sound of glass breaking, but that he knows nothing more. He can give no explanation of the young man’s last words, but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium in dying. He believes that Willoughby Smith had not an enemy in the world, and can give no reason for the crime. His first action was to send Mortimer to fetch the local police. Nothing was moved until I got there early this morning, and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house, lest they trample over evidence of the perpetrator.” Hopkins gave a small, proud smile. “It was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice, Mr. Holmes. There was really nothing wanting.”
“No doubt you were extremely busy,” I said dryly, and the corner of Holmes’s mouth twitched.
“It means that I can make neither head nor tail or it,” the detective replied, with the little snubbed pride that I so approved of. “So far as I can see, it’s just as tangled a business as I ever handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn’t go wrong. There’s no
And for what? To stop a monster, true. To save lives, to save
“Move faster, or God help me, Doctor, Mr. Holmes will escape to find your corpse.”
The jagged stone in my throat had returned, and I struggled to dispel the mist which had sprung into my eyes.
"The case, Watson," he explained, voice fraying. "With your confidence in me, and the atmosphere of the Emerald Circle, I thought it the perfect opportunity to—to determine—"
“We mustn’t delay, we need to make it all the way to Ratcliffe with time to spare to watch members come in. There is a possibility our man will leave quickly if he finds his lover is not in attendance, and I have no desire to prolong our reconnaissance to more than one night if we can help it. Grab your coat and your circlet, the game is afoot!”
“Less, if I am right. Go, Hopkins, and meet us in the Professor’s rooms as soon as it is ready. We will need your irons.”
Ice poured into my veins. My ears rang like a mortar round had been fired above my head.
"Please, it's almost like one of your mysteries, eh, John? Always wanted a swing at one myself. Leave it to old Tom. And for God's sake, get this one a drink before someone does it for you." With a wink, Thomas was off, and I concentrated on not sighing aloud.
"I have reason to believe that Peter Ables's disappearance is more than it seems, my dear fellow. Judging from what I learned from the ladies backstage, this kidnapping may play only a minor role in a much more nefarious dealing."
“Please calm yourself, sir,” said Holmes, in a voice as smooth as silk. I thanked God, not for the first time, that my friend was not in a business where his charms could bring ruin to anyone but criminals. “Pray, what is your concern?”
“I cannot disagree,” Holmes said. “I believe there is more to this prototype that Mr. Robinson has told us. Shall we?”
Holmes said, calm and so close to fond that it ached within me
But the truth of it was, the memory of Holmes did not speak because he had nothing more to say. Nothing that I could truly believe, nothing that I could hear without breaking apart completely. He was right, had always been right, but I could not accept it. Not his logic, not his care, not my own damned medical mind, because why in God’s name should I look after myself when I had no one left in this world to live for? When the only family I had left had died to end a villain who lived on in cruel, criminal lessers cast across the globe? What was the point?
“Two slices,” I instructed, eagerly digging into my own.
“You mean besides the mess, the stench, and the odious drunkard?” I quipped.
“I—” I managed, gaping with awe. His irises shone like liquid steel as they drifted from my expression to the man beside me. With his tinted lips curled in a vainglorious smile, Holmes glided forward, and along my right side, he pressed close enough that I could smell his rosewater perfume. My thoughts swam as whatever intimate space between us was eliminated, and he bent his head close to mine.
I flipped it over. There were letters in ichor-black ink, stretching in an elegant scrawl.
“I made it to the road. I saw the postman and appropriated his mare. We chased down the path to Chatham, and I found the horses unmoored upon the bridge.”
"At your command, doctor," he replied, with a smile that did not reach his eyes. "Stay sharp."
My friend took them with glacial slowness.
“I see you've had a busy morning, inspector,” Holmes remarked, and I watched him cast about for his pipe with a subtle,
“Holmes! Dr. Watson—?!”

at the Circle was irritating enough.”
“Hand them to Holmes.”
ik it's short. :) not sorry lads. (i am petrified of writing Holmes's POV. who knows if i did it any justice.)
“You are…you are being cruel, Holmes,” I said. “This is below you. You cannot seriously blame my stories for Smith’s death.”
"Possibly, though I don't recall a ‘Fred’ among their legion. More likely it is an acquaintance of Wiggins—perhaps one who, for some reason, has been unable or unwilling to assist me in the work I've offered his compatriots."
"Then let us have them."
hearing the shattering of the window.” His head turned towards me, and I bit back a grin as my friend’s eyes practically danced with anticipation. A proper case, indeed. “But more’s the point, gentlemen, this murderer was bold enough to enter through the back door, enter the study, pilfer the murder weapon from the Professor’s desk,
I frowned in thought. “Was it luck, to walk the subtler path in the dark? You say she was careful, but certainly it would have been quite difficult to discern in the stormy darkness which path was firmer and where the mud sank deeper?”
The place had changed little since my last visit. The clamor of brassy music, loud laughter, and cloying smell of spilt liquor suffused me with memories, fond and bittersweet. I couldn’t help but recall the last time I'd been here—months before, hurting but on the mend, wondering if it would finally be the night I allowed myself to indulge in any advances.
“Holmes,” I began, as the door was closed behind us.
Her dark eyes twinkled and my gut twisted as a dusty, unkind laugh slipped from her lips. The carriage around us lurched as, with a shout, Coram whipped the horses and sent us hurtling towards the main road.
I swallowed thickly. “I—I had wanted...” I trailed off with a faint, forced smile, feeling foolish for the distant creeping of warmth in the corners of my eyes. I blinked rapidly, willing them away. “I had wanted to walk you home. I made to catch up with you on the way to Baker Street.”
“Take a napkin full,” I encouraged quietly, winking, and Wiggins beamed.
Holmes clicked his tongue. “Well then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?”
“Are you a representative of this damned railway company?” the man interrupted, voice going sharp as his attention was roused. “Because I have a complaint or two for you, sir!”
I blinked in surprise. “What?”
My heart seemed to stop beating within my chest.
“Unharmed?” Johann insisted.
A strong, peculiar odor met my nostrils as I stomped into the sitting room, and I coughed and waved a hand through the smoke-filled air to see Holmes, sleep-robed, bent over an overflowing mess of chemicals on his desk.
“Go on,” I pressed. “You said, ‘first of all’? Did anything else happen that night?”
The flat was so quiet. Every time my conscious mind began to slip off the precipice of awareness, the silence shook me awake. At the edge of nothing, my ears would strain for sound—for the low screech of an adjusted chord, for the suck and low puff of a pipe—and my heart would pound in my chest as though gripped by a fist. My palms would go sweat-damp and my throat would constrict around memories of swallowed cries and shouts across the falls. Behind closed eyes all I would see is cliff mud and the white mists, the white bloodless stretch of bone and flesh below black water.
The man shook his head. “Left at the end of his shift, with me alone to face the firing squad.”
Regret swept over my friend's face, disarming me with its intensity. "No, Watson. You could never be that."
"Worthy!" The man cried, young and panicked beneath his flatcap.
“Ah, but we’ve neglected the
In an instant, the world around me snapped into clarity. The heat which stirred my blood fled, leaving me cold, and I found myself drawing away from the atmospheric warmth of Holmes's body, mouth bone dry.
"Watson—"
Holmes dipped back into the repair room and returned with a very large gas headlamp, a large loose steam whistle part, and curiously, a fire extinguisher in his hands. Carefully, he hung the light on the dividing beam of our construction, affixed the steam whistle to the side on a bolt, and twisted the hose of the fire extinguisher onto a pump he’d insisted without explanation we install. Soon the pump was connected to the steam whistle in such a fashion that when Holmes squeezed the fire extinguisher trigger and pulled down our design’s handle, a shrill, familiar shriek pierced the air as pressure rattled through the whistle.
“I do not like the ceaseless letters, Holmes, because they annoy you, and when you are annoyed, you become a ridiculous child.” Holmes opened his mouth to speak, but I steamed directly over him. “I did not like fannish clients, because they are more interested in flashing their bosoms than hiring you for a case, and in their presence, I become unfairly jealous. And while I
“You bastards,” Worthy hissed. “How did you know? Who turned on us?”
"Full of bullet holes," Johann supplied helpfully, and I buried a wince as Holmes looked at me, knife-sharp gaze pinning me to the chair upholstery.
Fury launched me from the horse down the bank. My blood boiled as I dove for the professor's waist, hell-bent to rip him away from Watson and beat the very life from him. Coram, disadvantaged by his age and my surprise attack, crumpled beneath my assault, and the two of us splashed down into the icy stream. The water was like white fire, lancing shock deep into my bones, but the heat of my anger preserved my focus as I reared up and brought a furious blow upon the man’s cranium.
“Good God!”
“Stop her!” Holmes cried, bounding across the room, but before either he or Hopkins could make it, she held a small phial to her lips.
either.”
“When I was abroad in the Continent…" Holmes hesitated. "I missed your companionship. More dearly than I imagined I would.”
“Your brother sounds like a good man,” I said, and Fred nodded, his small eyes glittering.
“I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr. Holmes,” said Hopkins, frowning like a student scolded by his most favorite teacher. “I knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. I next examined the corridor outside the room itself. It is lined with coconut matting, and has taken no impression of any kind. The bedroom itself is scantily furnished and carpeted. The main article is a large writing-table with a fixed bureau, which consists of a double column of drawers with a small central cupboard between them. The drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value was kept in them. The Professor assures me that nothing was missing. So, it is certain that no robbery has been committed.”
I jerked my head up to see Hopkins staring horrorstruck at the scene—the Corams bloody and unconscious, and Watson waxen and limp in my arms.
“I managed to convince them of my earnestness, conceding my genuine interest to learn the manner and tools of their trade. They were pleasantly surprised. As they applied powder to my face, they told me all they knew of Peter Ables. Or as they know him, Petrice.”
my captain had once told me.
Holmes released the woman as if scalded. His face, once aglow with excitement, was now ashen.
shall rest here. My uncharitable ruckus this morning took a great deal of sleep from you—” I immediately opened my mouth to protest, “—whereas I have matters to attend to this morning in town. I will be back within a few hours, which should give you plenty of time to brunch and to doze. I expect we will be up very late tonight, my dear fellow.”
“Panic can be a useful distraction, if manipulated carefully. I am confident word will spread that the police are out for blood.” Holmes flashed white teeth. “If not, I will be happy to hasten the message. In disguise, of course.”
He looked at me with that light in his eyes, dancing as it did moments before apogee, and he opened the door.
“We should make for the back-door!” I cried, over the roar of gunfire. “They’ll have no choice but to be forced back, and I don’t want to be between them and escape when they do!” Johann nodded sharply, and the two of us, as the bullets lulled and men reloaded, sprinted for the exit.
“We will do our very best, Wiggins,” Holmes said. “Until he is found, I would ask you rally your men into a search party.”
“I don’t remember,” the man squalled, looking less and less stable as the conversation continued. “They was a whole group! And they wasn’t English, I remember that!”
“You are searching for a woman of good address,” said Holmes smoothly. “Attired like a lady. She has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably rounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. As her glasses are of remarkable strength and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.”
“What did the telegram say?”
“Yes, sir! And I can help you find ‘im!”
articles, John, it’s cracking stuff. That detective of yours is a real intellect.”
"And if I could?"
“What did you find?” I asked, as Holmes hooked his arm around mine without prompting and set us off on a march towards the exit.
The man’s face brightened at the implication that his complaints were finally being given credence. “Aye, sure.” His nostrils crinkled with distaste. “Hard to miss, they were. Foreigners. Spanish-looking toffs.” He leaned forward with a conspiratory air, eyes hard. “You know the type. The ones with snake eyes.”
Fred looked despairing. "No, no, he's too busy lookin' after me to be courtin' any lass or to be havin’...uh-quaint-nances. He says it's his duty 'n pr-privilege but..." Fred sniffed. "But I know he sometimes wish he didna have to.  But he wouldna leave me, I know it!"
Parting through the sea of armed guard, a final man entered the room. His walk was leisurely, a confident amble with his hands tucked in his pockets. His cap was akimbo on a mass of dirty black hair, and his mouth was stretched into a smile that chilled my stomach. This was their lieutenant, no doubt. The rank and file waited expectantly for him: their leader in direction and arrogance both, it seemed.
All of the apprehension that had stiffened the Professor’s limbs had bled from him in the middle of Holmes’s statement. Now, he lit a cigarette with unsettling, masterful coolness. The end of his cigarette seared fire-red, and in its glow the piercing eyes that had once caught my attention now sent chills down my spine.
“Watson," Holmes said, softly, plain. "I am a selfish man. The few things that I value, I covet. Before you, I did not hesitate to take what I wanted, nor avoid that which I believe I detested. But your friendship is more than I ever wanted from another soul. You are exemplary. Your meaning to me is singular. And you have proven me wrong, and so my mind demands answer to the question of whether it is possible I am
“Even me, hmm?” The corner of Holmes’s thin mouth twisted upwards at my expense. I huffed, biting down the unruly urge to return the smile for fear of encouraging him, and plucked the note from his hands. Bringing it to eye level, I was forced to admit at least one detail was particularly obvious. "Well. Judging from the colorful grammar and rudimentary handwriting, I'd say this note was written by a child. Or at least, someone with little literary education."
No, I did not ask, because I did not want him to look at me when he answered. I could not bear that quicksilver gaze upon my face, the dissemination of every nuance in my expressions as I spoke to him of such things. I could not endure those honed senses turned upon me, laying bare every secret locked in my breast. I let lie his commentary on the nature and conduct of the heart, because, in truth, it was only a matter of time before he realized the state of mine. I was delaying the inevitable, as long as I could, gutless and futile in my months-long attempt to disguise the love I harbored for my dearest friend.
A moment of silence, and the proud slope of my friend’s shoulders tented as his head bent. But his back did not turn. His chin twisted only enough to speak, a chiaroscuro profile in low gas light.
“In a box that was Mum’s. Peter keeps money in it and some letters, but I cannae read ‘em. And I can read and write proper good! Peter taught me how! But they’re all wrong, the words are all mixed together.”
“If you’ll indulge me,” Holmes said. “I know you’ve already given your statement to the inspector, but I find it best to hear such things from the source, as it were.”
however, need a mind such as mine.”
“I shall aspire to provide,” Holmes said, dipping his head enough I could feel the heat of his skin radiate against mine. Chin tilting upward, mouth parting for his, the sudden sound of footsteps had the both of us pivoting on our heels towards the sitting room.
"Oh, Mr. Holmes, there was a note for you this morning, slipped through the mail-slot."
“I’m afraid I cannot say, sir.” With sudden resolve, the young man crossed his arms. “I already wrote to higher management on the matter about the incident, and my reports are confidential.”
Squinting in the dark as I rubbed my arms in the cold, I sighed in relief at the flickering of a distant light in the inky darkness.  “At last,” I said longingly. "I do hope they'll serve tea."
had been too late. Heart twisting my chest, I read on as Smith introduced himself, explained his recent employment under Nicholas Coram, and began to detail peculiar circumstances that he’d been experiencing since his hiring.
“Undoubtedly,” I said, smiling crookedly. “But that is what you always say, and your abilities never fail to impress.”
“As always,” I murmured. His closeness, his burning gaze, brought my heart to pound, battering against my ribcage.
Holmes clasped a gloved hand on my shoulder, a faint smile unwinding across his face. “You are a master negotiator, doctor. I concede to your terms, on the account that you keep watch.”
“...I would not be unopposed,” he said.
” I said, horrified.
“I can confirm
“Nonsense,” I managed, shifting in my sheets to squint grumpily in the grey morning light. “We are both having breakfast, even if it’s just a cuppa and toast. I’ll not have you slipping into bad habits after all my hard work.”
“Holmes,” I breathed. I reflexively reached out for him, but grasped only air. My friend did not take my outstretched hand. He just looked at me, features broken like a man upon the rack. “What’s happened? What’s wrong?”
“But only you, friend William. They’re intrigued about the Circle’s newest member, I think.”
“I—” His voice faltered, and he looked more uncertain than I had ever seen him. “I do not know.”
“Until I was booted off the bloody train!” Mr. Robinson cried, again incensed at the drop of a hat. “All because of this imbecile station master!” He pointed to the ticket office, where behind the counter, I could see a young man in a uniform wince visibly like a scolded child.
“We need more information,” Holmes said, visibly eager. “This case is much broader than it appears at first glance. And I believe I spy a man who may be able to grant clarity into some of its depths.” He inclined his head, and I turned mine to follow the angle of his gaze elsewhere in the waiting room, where a plump, eccentric-dressed man sat on a bench, his face layered with displeasure.
"I have no desire to sit fretting over you as I did this morning like some useless nanny. And it does you no good to be alone when they clearly disturb you enough to keep you awake for hours after they pass."
Tension rippled throughout my frame. “ I…do not think that is the best idea, Holmes. You are a public figure, by now. I do not like the idea of risking your reputation for a case, not when I could so easily go alone.”
My barbed silence taken as agreement, Holmes's proud shoulders slumped. "Watson. When I said I was curious, I meant it. But not in the way you accuse me of. Heaven forbid I ever again fall so low in your eyes."
his eyes teased, and I rolled my eyes. Pot to kettle.
"Your observations were correct. I was—I have been...intimating. Performing cues so as to indicate—that is, I have been, intentionally—"
“Why were they used in the first place?”
“Mm, perhaps,” said Holmes, tossing a wink my direction, and I hummed, smiling.
"Wiggins always has at least one of his associates posted in front of Barnes’s Books, in case their services are required. I've requested a meeting, and he should receive the message as fast as a young lad can run."
As Coram talked, Holmes paced up and down about the room, smoking like a veritable steam engine. He sucked one to the quick and went back for a second and third while the Professor rambled, whipping up a regular pea-souper as he occasionally did in Baker Street on his more slippery cases. Perhaps the fresh Japanese cigarettes were a new favorite, but I did wonder if something else was driving him to distraction.
“I will drink to that,” Quincey said approvingly, and lifted his pointer and middle finger at Johann. “Some whiskys, barman.”
return, should we find you implicated. Until then…do stay in town.”
“But if it reassures you, I will go in some manner of disguise. If not to wear when I enter, that at least to confuse any onlookers when we leave in the late evening.”
A part of me hoped that Holmes had long since identified and dismissed my affliction for him as irrelevant to our partnership. Another part, one much less logical and far more wary, feared instead the moment when Holmes would recognize the longing in me and pull away.
“Who could possibly want to ply
"...Yes," Holmes said, voice low. It had shed its uncertainty, and some other quality had replaced it. Interest had transformed into headier straits, and the sound of it heated my gut like kindling. Slowly, I slid my hands up the cool cotton of his back, and inclined my head upwards to take his mouth with mine.
“Truly, a change of scene will do you a world of good,” I insisted, craning my head for a glance of him.
“Watson,” he breathed.
I gaped, not unlike a freshly caught perch.
Gingerly, my bedroom door swings open. Holmes enters in his light sleep robe, looking so out of place and uncertain in the confines of my bedroom that it nearly dazes me for a moment.
