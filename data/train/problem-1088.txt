He tried to imagine John sitting behind him in his chair near the fireplace, reading a newspaper. Even though the silence was the same – save for an occasional turning of a page Sherlock had to add in his imagination – ,  there was a huge difference in John actually being there or not, as irrational as it seemed. Just as Sherlock hadn’t really needed him to accompany him to the goldsmith that afternoon, but everything was just so much more...
“Well,” Sherlock said pensively, “I think I’ve simply never forgiven him for the way he used to continually behave as a sort of third parent when I was little, rather than an ally. Always telling me I should act differently from the way I did, pointing out my every mistake. Rather than being on my side, as siblings are supposed to be – in disagreements with their parents, or with other children – he was always condescendingly telling me I simply shouldn’t have shown any emotions and then there wouldn’t have been so much trouble. I wouldn’t have upset our parents. The other children wouldn’t have bullied me. As if I just had myself to blame, always. Or, alternatively, I shouldn’t have actually
“They always fill me with a certain horror,” Sherlock admitted. “It is my belief, John, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”
The horrible realisation then dawned on John that all the people who had been ‘talking’ all this time would now righteously gloat about having been right from the beginning. But then again, it was a small price to pay for what they had now. On top of which, it was actually quite funny, in spite of the bitter edge of irony that everybody had seen what they had both failed to acknowledge all those years.
“Yeah.” Sherlock thought he half-succeeded at faking a fond smile, helped somewhat by his mild amusement at Sally’s facial expression. “She had us all fooled for a long while, before we found out.”
It was a ridiculous story, but they’d had very little time to come up with something, so it would have to do.
“Of course I do, yes. I was oblivious and insensitive to your feelings and it makes me feel like a complete fool. I’m a bloody doctor and I failed to see the signs of your abuse. I failed. Please forgive me, Sherlock.”
Another difference was that John now knew – almost for certain – that Sherlock had more than one brother; a bizarre revelation which still blew his mind.
Once Sherlock was in his builders clothes and he’d reappeared from the bathroom with his tooth painted black and his false tattoo skilfully applied once again, he made for the door before John had had a chance to say so much as a simple good-bye to him. Just like both days previously.
After John had left Scotland Yard for home, Sherlock slumped back down in the chair in Lestrade’s office and meekly waited for the finalisation of the paperwork that required his signatures.
Without actively deciding to, Sherlock carefully retracted his fingers from John’s arse and reached for the lube again. He then smeared an ample amount onto his prick. Just in case, he told himself. And also, it was a great excuse to touch himself and relieve at least a tiny bit of tension.
She raised her eyebrows, cocking her head. “Well, he has a rather long blond beard, and large-framed spectacles.” She paused to think for a moment. “Other than that, I can’t tell you much, I’m afraid. He’s of average height, average build and about my age, I would guess. I never managed to see his face clearly.”
John quickly ducked behind a bus stop shelter as he recognised one of his patients approaching; to avoid having to receive condolences for losing Mary. He pretended to check his phone, and while he was at it, deleted all his new notifications. Nothing from Sherlock.
There was no such thing in the world as certainty, so it was quite futile to long for it, Sherlock knew. He had asked John to move back in with him and John had said yes (‘Oh God, yes’ no less), but then they had kissed and the world had been turned upside down.
But above all, she had needed to collect information, of course. She needed to know everything there was to know about Sherlock Holmes – and therefore, about John Watson – in order to be able to make the rest of his life as miserable as possible. To thwart all his plans the way he’d frustrated Jim’s and Rose’s, and to let him lose the person who was dearest to him, just like they’d lost Jim.
“No,” Sherlock simply said, blankly. “I didn’t feel like I needed them anymore. Nor did I take anything else, in case you were worried.” Sherlock underlined his words with an intent frown in John’s direction.
“It’s alright, Sherrinford,” Eric said. “This is your brother Sherlock and his… partner, John.” At the word ‘partner’, he looked at them as if to check that was the right word. John wasn’t entirely sure it was. Too ambiguous. Then again, seeing as no one was supposed to know the true nature of their relationship just yet, it was just fine, really. John gave a polite smile in acknowledgment. “They decided to come for a visit,” Eric said, looking back to Sherrinford.
Sherlock put his arms around the two of them, pressing kisses to their cheeks. “I promise I won’t let you down. I’ll be there for both of you, forever.” His voice sounded oddly rough to his own ears.
John clears his throat. It is now or never. On the spur of the moment, he chooses the more daring approach. “Sherlock, what you did to me two nights ago, would you do it again, if I reciprocated?”
“Yeah,” Sherlock heard Greg say. “Still working on that robbery-turned-homicide on one of the Borgias, the owners of the Black Pearl, from almost a year ago. The victim’s sister is driving us insane with weekly emails with newspaper clippings about the case from back in Italy, telling us what a disgrace it is that even we can’t solve it. And seeing as the murdered sister – or half-sister, I should say – had a British mother, and therefore, a British passport, the other sister expects us to put in more effort than the Slovenian police, who couldn’t care less, according to her, just because the pair happened to be in their country when her sister was murdered for their special pearl. ‘La Speciale’ is what the bloody thing is apparently called over there.” Greg sighed and showed them a picture on his phone that the only remaining Ms Borgia had sent him. There were several clippings in one image, the headlines of which read:
John swallows as he lowers himself onto his knees, not far from the spot where Sherlock did the same two nights prior. He’s quite sure he’s never had this much adrenalin in his system.
, for fuck’s sake, and he would not readily forgive himself for putting Sherlock’s health at risk. At least he finally understood the spur-of-the-moment thing.
This whole honesty lark was decidedly grossly overvalued and it clearly led to nothing but calamity. How stupidly naïve it had been of him to think that his relationship with John would last, with that wretched history of his...
John drags himself up the stairs as if the task is a specific punishment for his cockup: with great effort but very little enthusiasm. It’s not as if there’s any kind of reward at the top. He needs to get off, for God’s sake, not spend another evening locked inside, with his crazy flatmate huddled over a microscope or some other unspeakable experiment. (Or torturing his violin. Or shooting holes in the wall.)
As you might have noticed, I like to put a lot of Easter eggs and subtle references to the show or to Mofftiss’s decisions in my fics. Usually, I don’t want to point them out and explain them explicitly, since that would kind of spoil the fun, but in the case of the “It is what it is” quote, there might be a lot of people wondering what the two references (poem and John Locke) were about, so here is a reference post:
Mrs Hudson sighed. “Well, yes. It must be old age, mustn’t it? I couldn’t keep escaping it forever. Ever since that ear infection in May my health has just been sliding downhill like an Olympic alpine skier.”
A loud, indignant baby cry from upstairs momentarily pulled Sherlock’s attention away. At the same time, it reminded him of something he’d been meaning to ask Mycroft.
He finally understood so many of people’s motivations so much better, both in daily life and in crime solving. And it had become decidedly less of a mystery why there was such an outrageous number of love songs in the world. But also why being with your loved one was not the key to everlasting happiness after all, as it came with the new sorrow of the fear of losing them.
He was all but trembling. His very blood felt fizzy, like some carbonated drink. Champagne perhaps, he mused.
It was a sorry looking woman, around forty years old, with a cane, wearing an ankle-length, long-sleeved red dress. Her mousy hair fell stiffly over her shoulders.
Sherlock walked forward into the circle of children, going into full lecture mode. “The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals – step by step – the solution. That’s the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair. Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington the Poisoner.”
John ignored that. She was gone, after all, and he never needed to hear her egocentric, arrogant comments ever again. But it would probably take a while before all the memories had faded. The house was filled with them.
John’s eyes shot back to the man sitting in the other chair. He was no longer peering at him with the intensity of a few moments ago, but was sitting back in his chair with an open expression.
She remembered, as if it had been yesterday, the endless hours they would spend spying on the Holmeses’ house and its inhabitants, who were infinitely interesting. She learnt an important lesson then. Not all parents were as harsh and uncaring as hers. Nor were all brothers as cruel.
“Oh god yes,” he replied with a soft, mischievous smile, shaking his head just once to one side without taking his eyes off Sherlock.
“Alright,” Mycroft sighed. “I was studying up in my room. Daddy was at work and Mummy was in the kitchen. Nanny Forsyth walked into the garden to hang up the washing just after Sherrinford had started attacking Redbeard, so I can only tell you what she saw that instant, as you well know.”
“It did, indeed,” was all Sherlock said, deep in thought, carefully carrying the painting in one hand as they headed down the driveway towards the taxi waiting for them.
He felt a sudden pang at seeing Sherlock lie motionless on the floor and quickly tried to push away the images of that other time he’d seen him like that. The bastard was good at faking these things.
During their uni years, Jim had found other distractions to focus his attention on, although every so often, the subject of Sherlock would emerge again. Eurus herself had studied to become an actress (but finding jobs as such was a proper pain in the arse and she didn’t ever really want to work with other people anyway, seeing as how stupidly boring everyone was). More than anything, she loved to play male roles. And even outside the theatre, she enjoyed trying to pass as a man, and had made an in-depth study of putting on make-up that subtly made her seem more manly; revelling in a feeling of exultation for days every time she actually got mistaken for a bloke. Being able to express that part of her had made her feel so much more free and alive. (And the fact that in doing so, she was messing with people’s heads, was naturally an excellent bonus, as that in itself was her second favourite pastime.)
Although Sherlock quite liked the idea of wearing lingerie himself and couldn’t wait to see John’s reaction when he would undress, he could also not help but feel that on some level he was trying to be something he was not. However, he quickly pushed aside that feeling and buried it somewhere unreachable, as it was a generally known fact that relationships required continuous work and compromise. There was no use grouching about a perfectly adequate solution to a serious problem. Though he did make a mental note to try out next time if just knickers without a bra would do the trick as well, as that would make him feel at least slightly less awkward.
“Let’s say I’m not ruling anything out yet,” Sherlock replied, still carefully looking around the room.
Sherlock stood with both hands in the pockets of his dressing gown, staring out of the window at the occasional cars and pedestrians below on Baker Street as they made their way through the light fog.
Once he’d found the biggest and most pompous office on the executive level, he gave two short knocks and immediately proceeded inside. “Sorry, awfully busy, I’m sure,” he said in a cheery, business-like manner, “but this won’t take long.” He quickly flashed one of his stolen police badges, while continuing, “In addition to the notice you will get of a police officer being placed outside one Mr Watson’s room in the IC, I am here to request special permission to occupy the other bed in his room, by way of extra security.”
She briefly squeezed her eyes shut and ran over the order of Things To Be Done in her head. Although she felt relatively at home in 221B by now, after five weeks of living with the boys, she hadn’t yet reached the stage where she kept her sanitary pads in the shared bathroom.
The first place John had gone to, once he was well enough to go out, was the hairdresser. His hair had been ridiculously long for a while now, what with him being too busy trying to have his wife arrested to get a haircut for several months, but it had only gotten worse in hospital.
Sherrinford’s innocence was something he and Sherlock had both been vaguely suspecting for a while, which had been why Sherlock had gone back there to begin with. A shock, certainly, but not entirely unanticipated.
He let his head fall to one side, feeling the velvety structure of the head cushion against his skin. Familiar, somehow.
Initially, this is where the story ended. But as soon as I posted it (back in 2014), I decided I wanted to write a couple of extra chapters (eleven, as it now turns out :D), in which all the little loose ends that were not resolved in the first version of this story (as they often aren't in real life, which is why I decided to write them like this in the first place) would be wrapped up after all.
“I love you,” John said, groggily. The words just slipped out of his mouth all by themselves. Much too easily, he realised, the instant he’d said it.
were the one to realise that the guy in the handcuffs was actually a disguised woman who had volunteered to create a diversion for her brother. A very successful one at that. Lestrade gaped at her like
John had never felt so possessive of someone before. But maybe it was because of having seen Sherlock, who was always so very composed in this respect, become completely undone beneath him (and above him, alongside him; frankly in every thinkable position it was technically possible to give a hand- or blowjob in): it was simply the most exquisite thing in the world to see this genius being reduced to incoherent moans and whimpers, surrendering himself completely to John.
John hugged him a bit tighter, letting out a long breath. “Then we have more in common than we thought.”
To John’s surprise, Sherlock even turned out to be a tiny bit prone to sentiment. For instance, when they would kiss, he would sometimes take the chain with dog tags from around John’s neck and pull it over their heads until it was around his own neck. He did this especially when John was a bit gloomy, mulling over his army days – as if he wanted to take away John’s burden.
“Yeah,” John shrugged, grinning. “I’ll invite her over, so you can personally investigate our different sets of variables. Although it might be a while before she visits the UK again, you know. Kettle’s boiled. Tea?”
John instantly felt himself melt into Sherlock’s touch, electrified, high on shock and arousal at the same time, and kissed him back as gently and tenderly as he could muster with the amounts of adrenalin coursing through him: just pressing their lips together, afraid to overwhelm him again. He had been an idiot for jumping out there like that, but at the same time he was rather glad he had; there would not likely have been a better way. Sherlock was kissing him now. He did feel the same.
. I can’t thank her enough for her amazing work, without which it would have taken me many, many more hours (weeks, months) to write this fic.
“I. Did. Not. Steal. This,” James spat through gritted teeth, hatred still flaring in his eyes. He rapidly tucked his possession safely away before brusquely turning around and disappearing into the stables.
“A novel!” she repeated excitedly, staring at John in utter awe. “Even better!” she exclaimed. “Wow, that is a brilliant idea. Writing is, after all, an excellent form of therapy indeed, they say.” Janine felt the enthusiasm for John’s idea of writing a novel well up like a giant bubble inside her. “Because you really have to think about the emotional effects of things that happen to your characters and describe those effects in detail, don’t you.”
“I should like to observe everyone in and around the Hall for several days,” Sherlock at last told the earl. “And I have something in mind that will enable me to do so without attracting any attention to myself. It will, however, require Your Lordship’s convincing the building contractor to hire me as a self-employed builder and add me to his crew to replace the workman who has fallen ill with a chest infection. Does Your Lordship think that can be arranged?”
Resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, Smith patted his back. “Oh, Sherlock!” he said, releasing him. “What can I say? Thanks to you,” he gestured, as he turned to his entourage, “we’re
They ate cake and chatted some more, and John casually kissed Sherlock in front of everyone – twice – making the afternoon fly by.
So with Steve’s help, she had made sure that Jim’s face had been all over the country, on all screens simultaneously – with an ominous ring to it, as had been his trademark.
“John, this is all very new to me,” Sherlock said, his voice sounding strangely croaky. “I don’t really know... what to say or to do. I just...” Since he couldn’t seem to find the words, he settled for hugging John even tighter.
Sherlock smiled tightly. Remembering how much he’d missed John made him physically unwell. Well, more unwell than he already was, anyhow. He looked ahead again.
“Another agent just arrived at her nursery to stand watch until the end of this afternoon,” Mycroft went on. “I think Ms Hooper is probably the most suitable candidate to request to go over and pick up the child and take her to her temporary address, if I’ve assumed correctly. Could you call her to ask this favour of her?”
Once they were back outside, he smiled at Sherlock, before looking down at his bags with the day’s harvest. Then he put them down to sign to Sherlock, “I am happy.”
John was gripping Sherlock’s shoulder blades tightly, fingers digging into his flesh, firm and real. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he mumbled, and then lunged in for another sloppy kiss. With his hands he seemed to try to hold Sherlock everywhere at once, restlessly caressing his torso and shoulders.
“I sent e-mails to both of you from the other’s account and intercepted the replies,” he explained with a friendly smile. “I figured you, Miss Smith, would be convinced that Bob does like you, which he really does, by the way, if he invited you to such a posh place. And I have my reasons to assume that thanks among other things to this dinner date, Bob’s friend Jack by now has made plans to move back to South Africa. Am I right?”
at him.” He gestured towards Sherlock. Looking back to John, he held up two fingers on his right hand. “There are two possible explanations for what’s going on ’ere,” he said, heatedly. “Either I’m a serial killer... or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs, hmm? Delusional paranoia about a public personality? That’s not so special. It’s not even new!”
It wasn’t long before Sherlock started dreaming in sign language. Which was funny, because he’d often dreamed about people signing to each other before without actually knowing how to do so himself. (Like in that elaborate, strange, Victorian lucid dream he’d had on the plane bound for his intended exile, which he wasn’t likely to soon forget.) And he’d never realised that those dreams were almost certainly fuelled by some very early childhood memory, that he didn’t even consciously remember, of BSL teachers coming to their home to try to teach Sherrinford, back when they had been only toddlers.
He carefully mapped the entire building in his head as the earl led him over stairs, through doors, past alcoves, while trying to get as much information as possible about the rooms they passed by through innocent small talk. The earl pointed out his wife’s art room and the servants’ rooms in the corridor concerned and even showed him the billiard room at the far end, from which one could see most of the rear garden as well as part of the stables.
account, with the purpose of denouncing Moffat and Gatiss’s use of queerbaiting and the BBC's lofty response to the thousands of serious complaints that were sent to them, explaining how this has caused harm to the show’s most loyal fans.
“It never seemed to occur to him that an eight-year-old would obviously not have the same mental capacities as someone studying for their A-levels. It was infuriating. And exhausting.”
It would probably take a while to get used to the idea that each look, each smile between them now meant something else, and was laden with a new layer of emotion. After all this time, it was too amazing to fully take in yet.
had stolen it. Incredible coincidence. I applauded her for getting away with it. She seemed the ideal mum, from what I’ve seen.” She said this with an actual wistful smile on her face. “Better than mine, anyway.”
Sherlock could feel himself getting increasingly uncomfortable and twitchy. Like a tide inevitably coming in further and further, little waves at a time. But he would be allowed to rest and lie down soon.
He was hot, in every sense of the word. Not only his skin was relentlessly inflamed, but his prick definitely was as well. Every inch of him felt burning and... needy.
In spite of the ridiculous waste of helium by filling nonsensical shiny balloons with it, and in spite of the stupidly repetitive buntings suddenly having been draped all over their bookcases and in front of windows throughout the flat (screaming ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY’), the party was in fact rather agreeable.
Of course, John knew all about that, as well. He’d responded differently to it, although maybe not altogether so very differently after all, if you really thought about it.
“Positive. Now if you want to actually catch and arrest her, have a copper sent over to Rosie’s nursery as well as to the Intensive Care Unit, for John's daughter is just as much of a target.”
Sherlock chewed his lip. “My entire childhood, my parents seemed to actively keep me away from him. Never took me with them when they went to visit. It was as if they were trying to simply make me forget I ever had a second brother. They removed his photos from the living room. As if I could forget a
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said flatly, taking it from her with an elegant swoop. “The idea is to bring it to an expert to have it mended.” He opened the little box to examine its contents, then looked up. “At my expense, of course.”
“Well,” Sherlock said, speaking softly, “it seemed like something you might have done if any of this was real and you’d actually loved her. I guess… I thought it would make our story more realistic.”
busy right now,” she said, her voice suddenly low and conspiratorial. The poor woman looked a bit flushed. Had he interrupted her elliptical trainer workout? “It might be best not to disturb them at the minute,” she added, articulating rather exaggeratedly. She reminded him of the next-door neighbour back when he was a kid: overly sweet to the point of being a tad annoying.
Sherlock stepped closer and said, slightly dreamily, “Yes, in fact, I would very much like a kiss for starters.” Bending down, he gave John a short peck on the lips. “... and for main course...” – another peck – , “...
Sherlock raised both hands and covered his nose and mouth, breathing out a trembling breath as he slowly backed away.
“I promise,” Sherlock replied instantly. “And I will again in front of everyone. Because I love you more than I hate obligatory rituals. And crowds. And legal documents,” he smiled, and John sniggered.
“Since I’m assuming that the police are not passing you information directly, I thought I’d call to let you know that the French teacher has been found. He claims to have seen Arthur climb out of his window, alone, and went after him. Then he followed him around the back of the school and onto the moor, presuming that’s where he’d gone, but never saw him there. After walking for a good bit in the direction of what he says looked like a moving flashlight, he sprained his ankle so badly he couldn’t walk. He had to crawl back to the road, which took him three days. He’s in hospital, dehydrated.”
In her room, Rosie was grumpily beating her merman doll against the bars of her cot, dissatisfied at having been woken up by all this racket.
It was like the world started crumbling down around him: all the ugliness, evil, misery and gloom fading away to reveal just Sherlock, his soulmate, sitting at his bed in the golden light, waiting for his reaction. Loyal and honest, and completely vulnerable.
, that it summoned the strangest sensation in Sherlock of wanting to be even closer than this. His tongue was already inside John’s mouth, their hands were all over each other, ensuring almost full-body contact and still, it was not enough.
long… Four months was, after all, not such a very long time, spent outside of prison. But in here, trapped in a web of your own thoughts, time seemed to pass ever so much more slowly.
. He just talked and talked, to anyone who would listen – and most wouldn’t, you know, he was a right bore. But I did find some merit in his ideas, and repeatedly told him he should publish them. He never did, though. But, naturally, they influenced my research ideas and my own hypotheses. When I started writing my book, I did refer to his ideas several times, and discussed their relevance in my own field, and even credited him, mind, despite the fact that I wasn’t strictly obliged to. For a large part, I actually ended up disproving his theories, by the way. But as you know, disproving a theory in science is just as valid and valuable as proving one. More often than not, in those cases where I did prove one, I only could because I added essential elements to them that he had omitted.” She walked over to the oven to check if the cake was rising properly, and then contentedly sat back down at the table. “Of course, when he heard that I’d written and published a book, while he still hadn’t managed to publish hardly any of his own work, he was furious. Men can be so competitive. Whatever happened to being happy for someone else’s achievements? They were all my own.”
Whereas I had originally intended the story to have the length of an episode of the show, you could say it now has become an entire (alternate) series. :D
“No, it’s fine,” Sherlock managed. Thankfully, he’d had himself tested only a couple of months ago to eliminate any kind of contagion through needles that might have taken place when he’d been too doped to care during the foolish exercise he had undertaken last summer.
Sherlock reached for the nearest pillow with his clean hand and gently stuffed it under John’s bum, still telling himself it would make John more comfortable anyway, whatever they would do next that involved his arse. Because they weren’t actually going to do this now, for real, were they? Sherlock was not sure he was ready.
be separated again. Never. These feelings that John evoked in him, of being safe and cherished, had become one of the bare essentials of life. How did people
Sherlock did not change his pace. “Ah well, it was not that important. I just wanted you to have some fun.”
John slowly bent over Sherlock’s lean body and peppered his torso with loving kisses, biting and licking as he went along. By now, he was impossibly hard, but once they were at the point of almost doing it, John always found he could stall for time and heighten the suspense.
He smiled, and kept going. New ideas and plot points were popping into his head like daisies in spring: about secret agents and far-fetched disguises and how the male protagonist was helplessly attracted to the man he was supposed to guard with his life.
Mrs Hudson and her sister had come to the opening also, and after standing in front of one particular landscape painting for a long while, pointing and chatting, her sister came up to Sherrinford, smiled, and said very earnestly, “I would very much like to buy that painting over there.”
Then, in an apparent burst of decisiveness, John suddenly took him in deep and started sucking relentlessly hard, alternating with firm strokes. The world gradually began to fall out of focus as pleasure rose up from Sherlock’s groin and swirled through him in a swelling vortex. He let his head fall back hard onto the pillow and was only vaguely aware of his hips jerking and his semen dripping onto his stomach in little warm puddles.
And while Rosie pulled herself up on Harry’s knees and invited herself onto Harry’s lap, Harry told Sherlock and John all about her current life and the improvements in LGBT awareness and acceptance she had already helped achieve. She talked and talked, answering one question after another – more and more posed by John, too – and she felt like for the first time, her brother was actually listening to what she said.
Meanwhile, his cock had become so hard under John’s mouth that it ached and Sherlock was starting to become rather desperate himself. An unfamiliar sensation, and he was not sure whether it was in fact unpleasant or not.
Those two things had been linked together in his mind for so long, that it was no real wonder that he’d banished that desire to the deepest cellars of his consciousness. John had managed to disconnect the two to a very large extent, but especially in the context of John penetrating him (quite literally making love to him). And now he was asking Sherlock to switch, requiring him to be as gentle as John had always been with him, and Sherlock wasn’t sure he could do that.
John blinked, frowning, no longer really trying to keep up. The energy from the food had not quite reached his brain yet.
She had been exactly the kind of right hand Jim had been looking for. A crack shot who kept her head cool. Her being a woman had the additional advantage that he didn’t end up shagging her, like he had with most of his other drudges and which had only led to them disappearing off the stage again.
After a beat of silence, Sherlock concluded with some reluctance that it was apparently necessary to state the obvious. “Because you haven’t made love to me in over a week, John,” he said, defeated.
Finally, John continued, “I’m personally not particularly comfortable with the idea of anything up my arse either. I totally understand. It’s all fine. I just... I love you.”
He’d never been that fixated on penetration, but for some reason, seeing what Sherlock was doing with that piece of silicone was embarrassingly arousing.
He quickly closed the window with the camera feed when Anthea came back into his office with a new dossier under her arm.
“Yeah, well. I was kind of hoping you’d figure it out yourself when you got to know them a bit better,” he said, a little uneasily. “People don’t tend to respond kindly to someone unofficially diagnosing their own parents with a mental disorder.” He took a long breath. “Sorry. I’m sorry. I should have told you of my suspicions, John. Please forgive me.”
John gave him an open-mouthed smirk and huffed, then shook his head. “You meddlesome busybody of a genius.”
He’d been sitting at Sherlock’s hospital bed for several days already, after he had been shot by the mysterious burglar – not knowing yet that it had been his own sodding wife. John had offered to help one of the nurses who came to wash Sherlock and change his bandage and gown.
He pretty much nodded to everything Mummy said that afternoon, only once or twice taking the trouble to contradict her. He was tired. And one of his cerebral hemispheres was entirely occupied running a Mind Palace simulation of his and John’s third weekend together, last April, spent mostly cuddled up together on the sofa, with dinner at Angelo’s two evenings in a row. He had to make sure he’d never allow that memory to fade, which could be achieved by frequently and elaborately recreating it in his head.
John smiled back at him, considering for himself whether he in fact was or not. “I’m… sort of serious, actually. I mean, I’ve always wanted to. Then again, lots of people say that, and it doesn’t actually mean a thing. But in the past couple of hours, I’ve had more fun, by myself, than I’ve had in a long time. And I actually do have some ideas that I really want to write about, too. Perspectives that you don’t see often enough in the media, you know? And God knows I’ve seen enough crazy stuff this year alone to inspire at least
“And they’ve got these little red leaves in little circles all over the airplane,” the girl went on. “What are they called again? You know, just like those leaves on the syrup bottles, and the one on our school flag.”
In spite of everything, he was in good spirits. Sherlock was doing great, under the circumstances. And he was so good with Rosie, it continually melted John’s heart. John thought perhaps she was even the reason Sherlock kept mustering the strength to resist his cravings. He hadn’t relapsed once. (John had him do a test every morning.) He ate the food John cooked for the two of them – well, three of them, as Rosie was exploring solids as well now, under Sherlock’s watch – and they spent every waking hour together when John wasn’t working: taking Rosie to the park, watching telly together or shopping for groceries or new baby clothes.
When John opened the drawer, his face broke into a restrained smile. Dammit, he’d spotted the stupid dildo, of course, and could not miss the fact that it looked rather obviously new.
“It was alright,” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, at which John grabbed one of the lace-edged cushions and smashed it on his lover’s head, resulting in stifled giggles from underneath.
John then very carefully pressed the softest of kisses to the corner of Sherlock’s lips. “God, I love you Sherlock,” he whispered, letting go. “But I never thought you could love me back.”
As Sherlock made to turn away and continue their walk, John stopped him. “Hey.” He reached for Sherlock’s hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.
In the end, Sherlock had not even had the courage to take that step, let alone confess that he was in love with him. In all truth, he’d only just now really confessed that to himself as a fact.
John had the feeling the continents had shifted beneath him and he was standing on one leg, trying to find his balance.
for much longer. I mean, obviously, I still get tired easily, and I can’t stand up for long stretches of time, but that’s hardly relevant for my job, is it.”
Sherlock’s eyelids started to flutter uncontrollably. Another person had just told him he loved him. He couldn’t even remember his mother ever saying that to him.
John’s blissed-out smile made Sherlock thrust deeper, faster, harder, his enthusiasm at this endeavour rising. And John’s praising words casually murmured close to Sherlock’s ear made him want to devour this extraordinary creature who was letting him do this and who seemed to be enjoying it no less than he was.
Chloe then fearlessly lay down next to the dog, wrapping one little arm around the pitch black creature as if it was a teddy she’d had for ages.
She would have to use the special table for patients lying down as reference. Diastolic pressure was around 5 mmHg lower like this compared to in a sitting position, Sherlock knew.
In that exact moment, without actively trying to, an image flashed into his mind and it was instantly clear to him what he should do. (Long live pornography for providing this invaluable bit of inspiration.) After one more kiss to John’s mouth, Sherlock crawled backwards until his face was level with John’s prick, and he planted a single soft kiss to its base. Then, he kissed the inside of each of John’s thighs, which John was still holding spread wide open, and from there, a meticulous trail downwards to his arse cheeks.
He pulled Sherlock close to him and nuzzled his neck for a few moments, before he whispered, “Sherlock, I want you to top this time.”
Sherlock seemed to gather all his strength to keep his expression neutral as he forced himself to meet John’s eyes.
“You’re right. You’re absolutely right.” Sherlock thought for a minute. “No one else can know until we have Eurus. If she finds out, I shudder to think how she could use it against us.”
“Rose, dear, would you do something for me?” Jim had asked, shortly before his catastrophic death, with his worried puppy dog eyes that betrayed the importance of what he was about to say (and that it wasn’t a request at all but an urgent command).
“Yeah, works wonders against stress, you know,” Greg said, with only the slightest hint of defiance. “Anyway, she’s been pestering me for days, ever since she found out I knew you, asking me to get this message to you. Apparently, Mrs Hudson wouldn’t let her in and you weren’t answering your phone.” One corner of his mouth quirked up as he added, conspiratorially, “I now see why.”
Eventually, he typed, “My wife has died. I still can’t believe it. I still see her everywhere I look. I hear her voice and I talk to her, but she’s no longer there. Words fail to express how much I miss her.”
He had already determined that Violet would likely not forgive Bob if she found out it was he who had been following her around, especially if she learnt the story behind it. Yet there were at least a dozen characteristics of their personalities that were perfectly compatible with each other. Since that number was much higher than for the average couple, it would be a pity if it didn’t work out between them just because Bob had initially had rather dubious motives to start dating her.
Despite the serious nature of their quest, Sherlock had to admit he’d secretly loved every minute of it. This ‘case of all cases’ had simply once more proven John to be his indispensable other half. It was as if they both viewed the world from a different angle, making their joint image near-perfect and complete – as long as they communicated seamlessly at all times, which they had now thankfully become rather good at.
Rose hadn’t looked surprised when she found Eurus on her doorstep, and, after fondly rolling her eyes, she’d let her in. “I guess it doesn’t matter anymore,” she’d said, rather indifferently.
, dummy, you only catch the dumb ones. Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill some people. What would happen then? All that power, all that money.” He squeezed the head of the doll with one thumb, crushing its face. “Sweet little government dancing attendance.”
A smile played around John’s lips at the prospect of an old-fashioned evening with his best friend in front of the fire. Although there was always, of course, also the frustrating and almost sickening feeling of longing in his stomach whenever he was near Sherlock. Longing for what, exactly, he still wasn’t willing to admit to himself. Neither had he figured out how to deal with those silly feelings. They were ridiculous and completely futile. But always there, nevertheless. Over the years, he kept thinking he’d buried them deep down safely, out of reach, only to be reminded time and again that they had a habit of flaring up at the least convenient moments.
That said, there might still be loads of inconsistencies regarding Sherlock’s perception of reality while he’s high, simply because I’ve never used drugs in my life and didn’t have the foggiest idea what I was doing while writing these scenes (in spite of having read as much as I could about the different effects of heroin and cocaine, of course, which smirkdoctor pointed out to me Sherlock must both have taken). Please do let me know if you spot any glaring errors!
When John approached him on his way towards the door, Sherlock grabbed him by the hips and looked him in the eye, declaring half-earnestly, “If it’s not, I can’t vouch for my behaviour when I find out.”
. He was just imagining things again. Wishful thinking. He needed to stop this. Of all the possible hints that Sherlock might or might not have given about his true feelings for John, this was certainly the most far-fetched. They were just really good mates, was all.
Sherlock smiled back, then stopped in his tracks and pulled John towards him into a kiss. This was Paris, after all, and he couldn’t care less what other people thought anyway. It was in fact the perfect place for a proper French kiss, as far as he was concerned.
Sherlock shook his head to expel all other thoughts, like a dog ridding himself of unpleasant raindrops. It worked.
“Yeah, works wonders against stress, you know,” Greg said, with only the slightest hint of defiance. “Anyway, she’s been pestering me for days, ever since she found out I knew you, asking me to get this message to you. Apparently, Mrs Hudson wouldn’t let her in and you weren’t answering your phone.” One corner of his mouth quirked up as he added, conspiratorially, “I now see why.”
“There’s only one explanation. You’ve been ingesting Clostridium bacteria through the honey that you’ve been using in everything lately. Usually those are only dangerous to babies under a year old, but your gut flora has been affected by the antibiotics, thus giving the intruders free rein. The botulinum neurotoxins that the bacteria produce are affecting your muscles. First the muscles in your eyes, then your stomach – hence the nausea and constipation – and your diaphragm is next.”
“Oh. That’s good,” John whispered. Molly was always good with Rosie. But he should really have just collected her himself. “Why am I even here?” John asked.
“I already am. But I’m still here,” he grinned, leaning in for a short kiss. “I have no intention of ever ceasing to be what I am to you now,” John added. “Unless, perhaps, we would decide one day to change our status from boyfriends to husbands.” He swallowed. That had actually been a rather ridiculous thing to say at this point. It had been meant as a joke, really, but it had come out much more seriously. Because deep down, he
now? Sherlock tried to wrap his mind around what that even meant. Among other things, relationships meant sex, of course. And he knew that sex was definitely important to John, who had continually been trying to get a leg over with all sorts of women the whole time they had lived together.
She’d tricked him into texting with her, telling her all sorts of personal details. And she’d obviously deliberately targeted him,
John had avoided talking about the case until now. But he apparently deemed Sherlock better enough, now that he was home, to talk about such things again. And Sherlock probably did owe him an explanation.
. Sitting at the hospital bed of his best friend, who had been shot by the very mother of his unborn child, they endlessly talked over all the options. John didn’t want to go back, didn’t want to ever see her again. But at the same time, he couldn’t bear the thought of a child of his being raised by that vermin.
Of course, their significantly lower stress levels might have had something to do with that as well.
John tried to shake his head, but then paused for a second. He needed to say something. Needed to reassure her, even though, in reality, he was only too happy that he wasn’t more…
Sherlock put on a pair of latex gloves he pulled from his pocket and opened the boy’s wardrobe. Interestingly, his coat was nowhere to be seen. Nor were his shoes. “Can I have a list of all the things that were taken from this room as evidence?” Sherlock asked the man in the doorway.
John looked at Sherlock hesitantly for an instant, as if collecting himself, then deliberately reached for the top button of Sherlock’s shirt and started unbuttoning it, slowly and carefully. His eyes flashed between Sherlock’s and the place where he was about to see newly exposed skin behind each button. When his eyes fell on the little circle that his ex-wife’s bullet had left, he briefly looked up at Sherlock with a blank stare that hid the depth of emotion beneath it.
After having lived together as flatmates for years, during which they had almost continually been bickering about anything and everything and feeling frustrated with one another, they had now miraculously finally accomplished an equilibrium where John felt they were truly equal, in all imaginable aspects of their relationship, with no more strife. (Well, not a lot of strife, anyway.)
Sherlock directed a deadpan stare at his mother and raised one eyebrow. “You want me to translate what he just signed?”
“Good, good. Listen, can you help me move him? I mean, we can’t let him lie in the middle of the doorway like that, can we?” The man looked slightly baffled.
He looked at John from the corner of his eye and saw that his mouth was comically hanging half open. He clearly didn’t believe him.
Then he found a newspaper and decided he might as well scan the headlines. But as he held it in front of him, his mind wouldn’t let him read. It went round in circles, thinking about the ease with which his crazy youngest brother could capture scenes so perfectly with a pencil or brush, without needing to use any words at all.
Staring at the woman intensely, Smith muttered, “She’s fine. She’s dead.” He smirked. “H. H. Holmes loved the dead. He mass-produced ’em.”
Thank God Greg had been so lenient as to allow John to postpone giving his witness statement until later that afternoon, rather than having him go straight to the Yard from the
Sherlock quickly opened his eyes and sat up straight. He ran a hand through his hair and went to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water.
Just at that moment, Sherlock rolled his eyes at John from across the room. He’d hit another dead end, apparently.
Although Sherlock thought that John was amenable to the idea when Janine suggested it, he hadn’t actually brought it up afterwards. Neither had Sherlock.
John convinced himself that they were just innocent feelings, irrelevant and inconsequential – despite what his father had implicitly taught him about the sinfulness of not conforming to strict gender roles.
When he suddenly became aware of John’s footsteps on the stairs, he managed to quickly close the website before slamming his laptop shut and assuming a pensive position on the sofa that would hide his
It took John half a second before he realised what answer he was supposed to give. “Shirley,” he said, forcing himself to sound casual.
It was the collector’s edition DVD box of Alfred Hitchcock films that John had been meaning to buy for ages.
Rosie reminded them of her presence by announcing she was tired and needed a nap – which was to say, her quiet babbling turned into fussing of increasing volume – so John picked her up and took her upstairs.
“John, I need you inside of me,” Sherlock murmured breathily, breaking contact to look at his lover. “Every time you make love to me, you overwrite a little part of that gruesome memory, and replace it with something beautiful and pure. I need you inside me to fill that gaping emptiness that still lurks at the back of my mind sometimes, created by him. I need you to fill it with
Sherlock pointed at the general area around the scene in the drawing, making a helpless gesture, in an attempt to convey that he didn’t understand.
The minute he’d hung up the phone, Sherlock heard Hannah come down the stairs with Rosie, who looked and sounded decidedly unsatisfied with the service provided.
Sometimes, he didn’t use social media for weeks, but when he did, it made him feel more… alive, somehow.
Suddenly, his mind flashed back to the present as Sherlock, looking rather irritated, sneered, “Why is it that there is
control. He loved the way Sherlock took care of him during sex and afterwards. That was, if he didn’t just fall asleep on top of him; and when he did, John loved that too.
But this time, he had to fool a Moriarty. Up close. And the stakes were higher than they had ever been. There was zero room for error.
Sherlock noticed that John appeared decidedly more sober than before. Sex seemed to have increased his alcohol dehydrogenase metabolism.
Sherlock let out an uncharacteristic but genuine giggle and there was a kind of relief in his eyes that John couldn’t quite place.
: she would have them blocked as soon as she noticed them missing.” His voice was gradually rising in frustration and the speed with which he spat out the
don’t return it in a worse shape than it is. It was my aunt’s, after all. And probably worth more than one of those fancy suits of yours, once it’s properly repaired.”
Sherlock couldn’t help but feel relieved that Mary was out of the picture (and safely incarcerated under Mycroft’s beady eyes), even though all he wanted was for John to be happy – and she
At the same time, he also felt incredibly guilty about not telling her that Vivian was dying, and that right now was Harry’s last chance to see her. He knew both of them considered her their favourite aunt.
Weirdly, John had called her only an hour earlier to try to reschedule, saying there had been “some complications” that morning, “which made the timing of their appointment less ideal”.
John was moaning softer now, more breathily. Sherlock was monitoring him closely, and although he seemed fine and relaxed, having a finger up his arse didn’t specifically seem to do much for him, no matter how diligently Sherlock tried to stimulate his prostate. Maybe he needed to feel more stretched?
“Never happened. Is this another one of your drug-fuelled fantasies?” Smith looked across to John and pulled a face while noisily sucking in a fake-nervous breath.
before posing as his therapist and shooting him. That she was in fact Jim Moriarty’s sister; how she and her brother had used to hang around Sherlock’s house over twenty years ago; how she’d apparently been sucked into her brother’s obsession with the boy who’d almost solved his murderous crime; how she and Mary (Rosamund) seemed to have been lovers, as Eurus had implied when she’d come round to the ICU to gloat; how she had managed to stay off MI5’s radar by flawlessly changing her apparent gender; and how she was now avenging Jim and Mary’s deaths by means of pretending to be other people. “Which is something she seems to be incredibly good at,” Sherlock concluded.
Sherlock sensed he had started to soften inside John because of his nerves, but nevertheless he now continued to move, this time pushing and retracting, by only the tiniest bit, trying to create some sort of rhythm that might work for them.
“Unless you need to get up early tomorrow, of course.” John’s face was full of uncertainty and awkwardness then, and Sherlock realised he might be taking too long to reply.
“Aw!” Greg exclaimed. “I was just about to call you. Molly solved it already. Sorry chaps. It was a rare fungal toxin that she thought of testing, and it just came up positive: both in the body and in the neighbour’s mysterious concoction out of his greenhouse laboratory.”
He took her pulse. Slightly elevated, but faint. As he checked her whites and her tongue, the known facts were spinning through his head, in chronological order: ear infection, blurry vision, nausea, constipation, trouble breathing, slightly elevated pulse. What else was there? What else could he think of that would connect the dots? He tried to remember whether there had been anything unusual about what she had said or done in the past weeks, but no specific memory would occur to him, other than her knocking over the plant on the landing several weeks ago. Well, and that she'd recently brought up some honey biscuits to him that she’d baked for some fair. She’d then mentioned having been to this other fair, in Barnet, or some place like that.
He was soon very close and he could tell that John was as well. It was the desperate noises that John was making that did him in. Sherlock managed to make it worse by mumbling “Bad doctor”, at which John let out an exquisite strangled moan and then Sherlock was there, making a mess on the sheets that were already clammy with perspiration anyway as John started slamming into him harder and deeper, groaning rather fiercely, and desperately whispering his name.
Also, Moriarty had an evil sister on the loose. Sherlock had actually spent an entire night being kind to her and supposedly helping her. Had risked his life for her, to catch Smith. Not her father after all.
Clearing his throat, and ignoring the strong wave of nausea in his stomach, he continued onwards a couple of steps, towards the door, then stopped and dramatically cupped one hand to his ear. A soft clunking sound could be heard some distance away. “Ah, the footsteps you’re about to hear will be very familiar to you,” he said, “not least because there’ll be three impacts rather than two. The third, of course, will be the end of a walking cane. Your daughter Faith’s walking cane.”
They re-heated the remaining Chinese food in the microwave and opened a bottle of wine. John felt the cosiness of the room drape over him like a comfy blanket as they sat in their chairs on either side of the fire.
I'm hoping to post the final chapter this Thursday at the latest (but of course I'm actually secretly aiming for finishing before the end of year, which would at least mean I wrote and finished the whole damn thing within 2014. :D But I don't want to make risky promises, LOL.)
Since Rosie had been born, Sherlock had learnt about the schedules one needed to stick to with babies, if you wanted to have any peace left at all. So he took John’s time indication very seriously.
So they ended up going out for chips together. If he could save a life, even in this unorthodox fashion, he needed to do it.
“Greg just texted, saying the creep apparently can’t stop confessing,” John smirked. “So. You did it again. Caught another confirmed killer by putting yourself in danger and outsmarting them.”
As they drank their tea, Sherlock asked how she was and she gave some vague, socially acceptable answer that he forgot the same instant.
Sherlock put a scone on his plate and sloppily smeared it with clotted cream and jam. “Well, I used to be rather remarkably cute when I was little, I’ve been told. And I liked the bees. I would sit in front of the hive and study them for hours. Josie used to tell me all about them. Finally found an interested audience in me.”
Back home, John hugged him and kissed his forehead when Sherlock told him the boy was safely back. Exhausted, Sherlock dropped into his chair (the sofa being full of cloths and clothes that John was apparently sorting through). Within a few moments, John brought him sandwiches and tea. The best in all of England.
“Come here,” John coaxed. “Let me make you forget all that is wrong and ridiculous in this world.” And he pulled Sherlock close to him, touching his nose to Sherlock’s, while cupping his arse with one hand and one of his fake breasts with the other, determined to take advantage of their disguise one last time.
Greg could suddenly place the desperate tone in quite a different context. Well, maybe the two were related, who knew. For a brief second, the thought crossed his mind that Sherlock probably pretty much deserved to be bent over like this by John, after having driven him up the walls like Greg knew he could. Then again, Sherlock definitely seemed to be enjoying this, judging by the expression of utter bliss on his face: his eyes closed, eye-brows high on his forehead, mouth half-open in a lazy smile, slack with pleasure – as Greg had never imagined possible between that set of cheekbones. Sherlock’s eager arse was sticking high up in the air for John to take (which he did with rather a large amount of enthusiasm indeed, Greg observed almost amusedly).
John looked towards the open laptop which still showed the article he had been looking at earlier. “Er, well, yes.”
It took him only about half a second to remember what had happened the night before. He was slightly embarrassed to feel the kind of Christmas morning anticipation kids were shown to have in adverts as he flung his legs over the edge of his bed. He quickly got up and casually strolled into the kitchen, still wearing his pyjamas.
Without John, Sherlock felt like a kite let loose, floating directionless and erratically, in danger of crashing down to the ground any moment.
“Alright, I guess. I’ve been worse.” She’d felt a nervous smile flicker over her face, in spite of her resentment. “And you?”
Obviously he’d never done anything like this with another man before either. Maybe he was worried that it wasn’t going to be as good as with a woman. Sherlock could only hope his preparations would prove to be enough in order for him not to disappoint John.
“But I never blamed you.” Sherlock frowned. “Honestly, there’s nothing to forgive. You shouldn’t feel guilty.”
“Jesus,” Sherlock hissed. “It didn’t, alright?” He threw his hands in the air in front of him. “It wasn’t until John got out of his coma, only two months ago.” He briefly closed his eyes. “Anyway, that’s not what I wanted to talk to you about.”
As they walked past quaysides, wooden churches and impressive rock formations, thinking about dead dogs and dead criminals from Moriarty’s network – the latter being the reason they travelled all the way here – John automatically pictured his late assassin wife walking these very streets last April. But this spirit-like appearance, wandering about in his imagination, projected onto the surroundings, did not stir any emotions in him. Rather, it detached her further from his life. As if he was finally properly leaving her memory behind here, in Norway, walking away from him in the distance, until she finally disappeared.
There were quiet gasps, hitching breaths, scraping fingers; there were gentle kisses between careful, slow thrusts.
“I’ll be right back, dear,” Mrs Hudson cut through his thoughts. “Just popping downstairs to get the ginger biscuits.”
After that, he waited. It was vital to intercept and delete the replies before Bob and Violet could read them themselves.
They took the tube to Clapham North and John gratefully closed his eyes during the ride, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, beer can on his knee.
Well, I hope you’ve enjoyed this. If you have, don’t be shy to leave a comment. They are indeed very much appreciated. :)
“We could buy you a can of beer to complete the picture,” Sherlock said. “Just for congruity’s sake.”
John was still looking a bit startled at what he’d just blurted out, apparently not knowing where to look, and flopped down next to him on the bed, avoiding Sherlock’s gaze.
“Do you know the story of the Appointment in Samarra?” Sherlock asked John, after a few minutes. He’d realised that the thought of it had not been so random after all.
Now that she saw Sherlock like this, being his genuine self, tenderly making love to John, her lingering bitterness seeped away and she could only feel happy for them both. It just looked...
“He was so lovely just now with Rosie,” Hannah quietly said to John. “She was being rather impossible again, I’m afraid. Nothing seemed to be able to calm her down.”
“You should check. What an idiot.” Smith pushed through a set of double doors and looked around the room as he walked in.
“What? Who told you that?” she asked, her voice high-pitched, letting the biscuit hover in front of her mouth.
He pictured John’s naked torso as he’d seen it during their summers as flatmates, on the occasions when John hadn’t bothered to put on a bathrobe coming out of the shower. Sherlock then pictured them both naked, embracing, John running his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and down his body, lower and lower. He arched his back on the sofa and pressed a hand over his groin. But as soon as he imagined himself bending over a table with John behind him, all of a sudden he was fourteen again and back in the geography store room at St. James’s, tears of pain rolling down his cheeks.
And then, to Sherlock’s astonishment, John pushed his chair backwards, stood up, grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders and kissed him.
The minute they entered the tea garden, they were heartily welcomed by the lady of the house, and directed to a little round table in a cosy and rather private corner of the garden under a torrent of cheerful chatter about how Sherlock (William) had grown. John stifled a grin.
“He approached me on Facebook, actually. Noticed I was single and also lived in London. He wanted to get to know people, as he’d just moved here.” She blushed once she started talking about him. “He seemed nice, so we went for a coffee. I didn’t add him back until after we’d met, mind.”
Sherlock felt pained and proud at the same time. Finally, his brother was getting to do something he should have been allowed to all along. To be independent.
John couldn’t remember how long it had been broken already. Sherlock never watched telly – unless he’d reached the point of boredom where the walls were in danger of getting shot at. Apparently it had not been a particularly good day.
Although Sherlock hadn’t lost his sharp edges, exactly, she’d never seen him this soft and tender. Simply another side of the same person, that had been hidden until now. Both sides were equally a part of him, of course, as were so many other sides she would likely never see. But as much as it was only natural for people to have hidden sides to them (which she’d experienced first-hand in her previous work, more than anyone), she was convinced that Sherlock finally being able to nurture his caring side would literally save his life.
Sherlock needed to get hurt. Needed to make sure he ended up in one of the hospital beds in this very building.
did she even know that we were here?!” John demanded, whispering frantically. “She was supposed to still be in Morocco.”
? You’re feeling fanciful this morning.” Sherlock raised one amused eyebrow at him as he grabbed a mug from one of the cupboards. “Are you feeling quite well?”
He woke up again when Sherlock somewhat forcefully grasped his arm. John stopped moving his hips, realising in that instant that he’d been rather enthusiastically humping Sherlock from behind. He had one hand on Sherlock’s upper thigh, fingers hooked around the waistband of his pants, apparently in the process of pulling them down.
John smiled, still amazed at the turn his life had taken. Despite their extremely bumpy start, being with Sherlock was the best thing that had ever happened to him.
“You,” John said, hiding a wide grin by looking down as he shook his head. “I think this might warrant champagne, don’t you?”
“Well, it must have either been agreed explicitly or they will simply lose interest in pursuing her. Or at least, Jack will.”
When he turned, she spoke. “Hello.” She had decided to use a northern inflection, seeing as men were always extra likely to fall for any kind of different sounding accent.
Smith walked away, looking as freakishly confident as ever. Sherlock looked at him grimly for a moment, then hugged himself, sighing silently.
Sherrinford’s reluctance to look at people, due to his autism, really only went for direct eye contact, as far as Sherlock had been able to tell. Copying gestures and learning sign language probably wouldn’t have been a problem at all, if it hadn’t been for Mummy’s arthritis and her resulting negative attitude towards the whole endeavour, which Sherrinford was bound to have sensed.
In a short while, when Sherlock was well enough to go home, it would be the three of them together at Baker Street again. (And who knew, maybe Sherlock would be fine with them staying there indefinitely? Although that was not what this was about, John berated himself.) John knew it wouldn’t be easy, living with a recovering junkie. (Hell, he’d been there when Sherlock had been trying to quit
“No, no, it’s fine. Just give me a moment. Don’t move.” John let out a long, slow breath. After deliberately breathing in and out a few more times, he started to leisurely wriggle his hips in small movements. Then he took hold of his own cock and slowly pumped his fist a couple of times. “Carry on,” he grinned shyly.
But then Sherlock pushed himself off of the table and turned to face him. “John, I want to look you in the eye while we do it,” he said quietly, touching his forehead to John’s.
“No one’s untouchable,” John ventured, after a moment, in spite of his mouth having gone as dry as parchment.
Sherlock was sure he heard her grin like a Cheshire cat through the solid wood. She quite obviously knew exactly what they had been up to. And ever since they’d gotten together, it appeared to have made their landlady almost as happy on their behalf as it made them.
The awkwardness of the situation was tangible to everyone except to Mrs Holmes. It was clear from his face that even Sherrinford could tell that his mother was making Sherlock and John deeply uncomfortable. He wildly gestured at Sherlock.
So I’ve ended up turning this into an almost novel-length story after all! Although I had initially written a slightly open ending on purpose (where John never found out about Sherlock having once been sexually assaulted in his teens), I soon after realised that it would actually be much more interesting and rewarding to see this story through to the end and write a proper arc for these two characters with a proper happy ending.
John looked at him with a lopsided grin, pushing his tongue against the inside of his cheek. “Alright. Let’s go. As soon as we’ve finished up this meal.”
John looked at the bruises on Sherlock’s face, at his chest subtly rising and falling with each breath.
John won’t have come back yet by then.” She’d winked at Eurus. “Great opportunity, near the Mediterranean.” She’d then stuffed another Jaffa cake into her mouth.
“Good morning, Mrs Hudson. Yes, he’s working. Actually, er, I’m out of tea bags, as it turns out, and I was wondering whether you could –”
He took a few sips of his tea. “Since I happened to be in the neighbourhood, I thought I’d do a young lady a favour. There is this girl in my yoga class--”
Well, that was just lovely, wasn’t it? The sod was actually carrying the stuff around with him. Naturally, he had planned his own abduction really well.
Within five minutes, John was trying on wigs and shirts and the two of them were being completely silly, doing funny voices and impressions.
The quiet tableau made Mycroft realise with a faint smile that he had been rather thinking like an insurance person, who, upon seeing a precious jewel, could only think about its worth in terms of the consequences in case it was lost.
The thing was, with Rose, you never knew how long you would be able to hold her attention. Eurus had – quite rightfully, as it later turned out – feared it was only temporary, so she had cherished every minute, sensing Rose would drop her like a hot potato if John Watson so much as got in touch with her.
And except when she had been moved to the infirmary, which had not been very nice at all. But still, a new experience. And a necessary one. Her body was slowly losing the fight against cancer, needing more support and more medicine by the day. Painkillers, foremost.
Making sense of The East Wind… A nickname Sherlock knew well from a long time ago, but didn’t think he’d ever hear again. Especially not from her own mouth.
When the hands and mouth abruptly disappeared, Sherlock blinked his eyes open to see John hastily unbuttoning his chequered shirt, his fingers faintly trembling. “God, it’s suddenly hot in here, isn’t it?” John muttered with an apologetic grin. Sherlock only bit back a smile as he waited to see John’s bare chest.
John couldn’t tear his gaze away from his lover. The brilliant git’s plan had worked perfectly from beginning to end.
After doing the same with the pair of black knickers, turning Sherlock back into his usual, naked self, John efficiently stripped off his own clothes, and soon after, they were on the bed, John on top of Sherlock, kissing as if their lives depended on it. (Precisely because their lives didn’t depend on anything at all for the first time in months.)
Considering what to do with it, and looking around to see where it might have come from, she briefly glanced through the bedroom door, down the hallway, and saw John sitting stiffly on the sofa, clutching his daughter, and following Hannah’s every move.
He’d always been sure romantic entanglement would slow him down and interfere with his Work. Still, that had now turned out to be only half true. He did get distracted on occasion, yes. But overall, being with John had opened doors in his mind that he hadn’t even known were
Even though his ‘affair’ –  if that was even what it was –  had consisted only of texting, it had proven to be a wonderful way of escaping his life with Mary occasionally.
He hurried up to his room to grab the walking cane, then fetched some fresh PJs, underpants and a toothbrush from Sherlock’s room and travelled straight back to Saint Caedwalla's Hospital as fast as he could.
Just a few more minutes, Sherlock thought. Just a few more minutes, and then it would either be plan A or plan B. He’d located all the necessary items for the second plan, if the first failed.
He kept his eyes on John as he unbuttoned his shirt. John, however, was checking his phone. Catching up on blog comments, probably.
But this was what her life had become, and she was fine with that, really. It gave her a purpose, if nothing else.
Still not the end! :) Three more chapters. Btw, one of the fun things about writing a fic like this is finding out there is a website [https://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com] where you can enter any place name in the world and a date of choice, and it gives you the exact times of sunrise and sunset in that place on that day. Also, Google Streetview enabled me to ‘walk through’ all these places in Norway that I’ve never been to irl, so that I could describe them as if I had. Amazing! Long live the internet, lol. (I’m one of those fossils who can quite clearly remember the time before it existed. I can’t imagine what it must have been like to write fic back then – or publish it, for that matter! We are honestly so lucky in this day and age…)
John tried to get hold of Sherlock’s cock to stroke him, but that turned out to be altogether a bit too ambitious: to his own frustration he couldn’t maintain the same angle and rhythm while leaning only on one arm. And he was close now, so very close. He could already feel the beginnings of a dizzying whirl gradually building up inside, until it suddenly over-flowed his being and erased everything around him, annihilating along with it any reluctance to cry out an elaborate string of primordial syllables that meant nothing and everything at the same time.
John swallowed hard, then fervently pulled Sherlock close to him, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck, while his fingers clutched Sherlock’s back. “Christ, Sherlock,” he panted.
“You’re asking me to… to adopt Chloe and officially get equal parental responsibility?” Sherlock asked, unsteadily, after a few long seconds. “I mean, are you… are you really sure you want me to?”
Aunt Vivian’s funeral was a small but beautiful and moving ceremony – with flowers, music and a poem by her favourite author – during which John finally shed his first tears. They silently rolled down his cheeks as the Benedictus from Bach’s mass in B minor resounded in the little church. Like the first lava from a volcanic eruption, slow but unstoppable once the first crack had appeared, his emotions started to trickle to the surface.
Also, once, when Mrs Hudson had popped in right when John had been preparing a surprise cake for her, and they had to plot an instant diversion behind her back not to spoil it.
While Sherlock let Rosie and the Wondernanny – as John had started to call her in his head – in from the street and showed them up the stairs, John slowly, carefully, got up from his chair to wait for them in the lounge. Before the two sets of footsteps had reached the top of the stairs, he could already hear his daughter’s excited cooing.
John would never need to find out. And if he did, somehow, Sherlock could always claim it had simply been part of the plan, so as to make their version of Mary’s death and their estrangement more believable.
EDIT: Crap, I've just realised that all the image links have changed and the illustrations have therefore become invisible on this website. I might fix them later, but for now, know that whenever it says "sherlockedart" in the middle of a sentence, that's a link to the image that was supposed to be in that spot! :D
They kissed for several minutes as their hands took lazy excursions to each other’s neck, shoulders and back, raising delightful goose bumps here and there.
Sherlock had mostly observed Sherrinford’s face as the others crowded round the table with the drawings laid out once more in rows of chronological order. Sherrinford had seemed puzzled by his family’s interest and their obvious reaction of shock to what they saw depicted. Sherlock had stood aside and watched the others struggle to somehow convey their apologies and regrets for having misunderstood him for all those years, but without being able to use words.
“I think we can safely say I found the right dress,” Sherlock cut through his reverie with a smirk. “Now, what shade of eyeshadow would best go with it, you think? We should pop round to Boots in a bit. Oh, and earrings! Yes, definitely earrings. And hairclips, while we’re at it.” He turned around to face John. “We should get some for you too,” he added cheekily as he moved his face ever closer to John’s. “Maybe one with a big flower on it. Now, try on that blue dress, will you? Although I doubt it will give me the same raging boner you’re having right now, I still want to see how it looks on you. Spit spot now.”
John had no idea what to think. He didn’t like not knowing what Sherlock was up to. And he didn’t like him being up to anything in the first place, in the state he was in. Also, he most certainly didn’t like him being in that state to begin with (and that was the understatement of the year).
Rosie followed all the goings-on at the baggage check-in, security and customs with interest, but thankfully soon fell fast asleep once their plane was up in the air and heading north, towards Oslo.
Had this builder sneaked into the house and stolen this handkerchief, what, as a souvenir? Somehow, it didn’t seem very likely – unless the man was a kleptomaniac. Which was easy enough to find out. Or was he hiding something inside of it? A valuable silver spoon? No, not cutlery: too risky sticking that into your trouser pocket, where it would easily get bent and lose its value.
“Could be,” she replied with a pensive expression, but a matter-of-fact tone, “although I would say his physique doesn’t look young enough to be one of them.”
“My father has access to this kind of memory blocking drug,” she said. “He has used it on me, and several other people, when he wanted to confess something. During this session, three years ago, my father told me he wanted to kill someone. One word, Mr Holmes, and it changed my world forever.”
It was an uncharacteristically warm September day when Sherlock got out of a cab in Wantage for the second time.
At least the email he’d sent her the other week – inviting her over the next time she was in London, which coincidentally happened to be very soon after – had been uncommonly friendly. He’d even asked about her girlfriend, Natalya. And she guessed it was time she got to know her niece, so she’d resolved to accept the invitation and try extra hard this time to avoid conflict.
He opened his eyes to see the smuggest grin he’d ever seen on Sherlock’s face – which was saying something.
