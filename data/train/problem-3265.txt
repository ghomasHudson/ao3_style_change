“Watching quality cinematography,” Cas retorted, failing to keep a smile off his face.
“What’s the dude like?”
Sam knew Dean visited the grave often - it seemed like every time he stopped by, the stone had been recently cleaned and the mixtape was less and less buried. He would also notice the growing collection of possessions dedicated to the owner of the grave: a striped, blue tie wrapped around another branch of the oak tree; more and more bee-related objects darted within the grass; a glass of whiskey left untouched.
“Do you like bees too?” Castiel asked, his eyes glinting with excitement. Dean felt his cheeks reddening, “I don’t really know much about bees.”
To Casseel,
“Don’t get all nerdy on him just yet, your highness,” Dean smirked, taking the beer bottle Jo was passing to him. Benny also smiled, humoured by the confused officer, “She’s a little special, no need to worry about her.”
Meanwhile, Dean lay in his bed, his snores becoming deeper as he spiralled into dreams of playing with his new friend in the front yard. They were both surrounded by bees of different sizes and colours, blue bees buzzing loudly in their ears as they poked the hive with sticks. Cas was giggling quietly as he prodded the nest, licking the honey that was accumulating on one end.
“If we’re going to be friends, I suppose so.”
The three waved the firefighter off as he left. Donna sat herself comfortably in the middle of the seat, finishing her beer, “Novak, we both have to be in early tomorrow, and I don’t need you to be more of a zombie than you were this morning.”
Castiel pushed himself forward, kissing Dean again, “And I’m never letting you go.”
Castiel’s cellphone rang aggressively in the peaceful motel room, stirring both Dean and Cas up from their almost slumber-like states. Answering the phone, Cas brought it to his ear, “Did you find them?”
“What if Cas helped?”
Donna walked back to the table from the bar, passing another beer bottle to the firefighter, “Is he okay?”
Letting Charlie and Benny hunt for the police officers, he approached an empty seat at the bar, smiling as the bar owner walked towards him, “Well look what the cat dragged in,” Ellen smiled, reaching over and pulling the man into a brief hug, “What brings you to my fine establishment, Dean?”
Nothing.
“Oh.”
“See? This isn’t too hard Cassie,” Gabriel smiled, letting go of Dean’s shoulder, “I’m gonna go help Dad unpack,” he announced as he walked away. Neither of the younger boys acknowledged his departure, both of them being more fixated on their discussion.
“Back to more pressing issues,” Charlie steered the conversation away, prodding Castiel in the chest, “What movie franchises do you actually like then?”
“Likewise,” Dean smiled, peering over Castiel’s shoulder to look at Donna, “Don’t let him do that again, Hanscum,” He winked, stepping away.
Mary perched herself on the edge of the bed, running her hand through his short hair, “Maybe, or maybe Castiel will find someone else to be his friend too. You don’t have to have everything the same as him.”
“Where’s Daddy?”
“Did you like the new boys, Dean?”
“I’m glad you all liked it,” Mary smiled, picking up Sam from his seat and resting him on her lap. She began patting at his back soothingly as he squirmed and gurgled. Dean and Castiel finished at the same time, trying to mimic how their parents had arranged their cutlery, ending up making a chorus of noise as metal clanged on the ceramic plates.
“Wait, you’re the most powerful witch we know,” Sam said. Rowena blushed at the compliment. “Why can’t you break it?”
Dean wandered over to Mary, clinging onto her leg like a little bear. She reached down and ruffled his sandy hair, “How would you feel about the Novaks coming around for dinner soon?”
“What are you doing out here, uncle?” Nico asked, crouching next to Dean, who was leaning against the back of the gravestone, his head resting on top of it. He opened his eyes, peering over at his nephew. Just from looking at the boy, it was obvious that he was related to Sam - both had the same hazel-green eyes and chestnut-coloured locks, not to mention that both were freakishly tall. Even at seven-years-old, Nico was a tall child, and everyone knew he would end up taller than his father.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Okay, Mr Critical. Shut up and enjoy quality cinematography.”
“Wreckers will clean it up,” Donna said, starting up the engine. Castiel got into the car, watching out the side window as they drove back to the station.
As they ascended further into the woods, Sam began filling in the blanks for his curious brother, who persistently asked questions about what they did for a living.
“Is that a dead guy?”
Chuck headed towards the door first, his children and wife following closely behind. Mary and Dean waited by the front door, waving as the new neighbours began walking away.
“We talking circa 1983?”
“My, what a detective you are,” Charlie grinned, “What’s your favourite Star Wars movie?”
“So he was like a brother?”
Mary chuckled at the obscure question. Of course, that was the deeming question that would decide whether Dean would remain friends with the boy - it had come as a shock to Mary when she discovered her son’s adoration for pie. Cherry pie was Dean’s favourite flavour, closely followed by apple and pecan.
“Right, sorry. I can’t remember most things,” Dean replied, blushing in shame.
Exhaustion was beginning to overcome the little boy, his eyes closing as he sighed at the feeling of his mother stroking his head. Mary waited until soft snores escaped Dean’s slightly open mouth before getting off the bed and making her way back downstairs. She glanced up at the clock in the hallway, sighing at how late it was. There was still no sign of John returning, the car not parked in front of the house.
Nico shuffled on his feet, deciding to sit himself in front of the stone, “What was he like?”
Dean shook his head, peering around nervously, “Why are we even out here?”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you two. I’m Naomi, and that,” The other woman pointed to the brown-haired boy, “is my son, Gabriel. And over there,” she turned again, signalling towards the other boy by the van, “is our youngest, Castiel.”
“Honey is better than sugar in tea,” Castiel began, “it is also a lot healthier. That’s what Momma says.”
Jo returned back to the group, passing over the two shots to the firefighters and the water to her colleague, “What has the new guy answered wrong?”
“I’ve never watched them,” Castiel immediately regretted the confession, the redhead whacking his shoulder.
“Both,” Cas chuckled, tightening his clasp on Dean’s hand, “Thank you.”
“It just takes some people longer to get used to new people, that’s all,” Mary replied, “I’m sure it’s very scary for him to be in a new place.”
Cas ran around the front of the car, helping Sam to guide Dean into the extensive house, “Where’s Rowena?”
“You must really love him,” Dean smiled, resting his hand on the one Cas had on his thigh, “Have you told him that you love him?”
“Why haven’t we heard of them before?” Sam asked, “If they’re that powerful, the Men of Letters must have known about them.”
Or maybe the angel secretly wanted Dean to stay like this?
“I highly doubt that’s correct, especially considering the fact that it’s ranked one of the lowest out of the franchise.”
“Well, we got Bon Jovi…”
“Where are your manners, Castiel?” The man scowled, putting his large hand on the boy’s shoulder, “You know not to be rude.”
After Chuck was defeated and Jack took on his role as the new God, everything seemed to be in a state of peace. Monsters still existed but Jack ensured that there was a form of equilibrium between them and humans, reducing the number of hunters working cases. Jack had also returned the people that Chuck had wiped away, returning Eileen to Sam and bringing back everyone that the brothers had lost during the final battle. Once the couple had been reunited, Sam thought it would be best for them to move out of the bunker, settling into a small, suburban house in Lawrence, close enough to visit Dean often. Dean had stayed, reminding Sam that “our legacy isn’t over yet”.
“My name is Dean Winchester. Sam is my brother.”
“Shut up,” Dean replied, a small smile appearing on his lips, “Thanks for the offer though.”
“John still bothering you?”
Finally, Cas pulled away, resting his hand against Dean’s chest, “Why did it have to be a memory spell that made you act?”
Dean rolled his eyes as Charlie began waving at the two police officers. Donna slid into the seat next to Dean, her warming smile on her lips. Castiel didn’t have time to act before Charlie grabbed his arm and pulled him into the seat next to her, clutching his right hand with hers, “Charlie Bradbury, technological genius and Queen of Moondoor.”
“He-He’s been forgetting things.”
“This was truly delicious,” Naomi commented, patting the corner of her mouth with a napkin. Chuck nodded in agreement, finishing the last mouthful of meat and placing his cutlery neatly on the empty plate.
“You’re so not my type,” Charlie giggled, finally managing to control herself, “I’m just in need of new friends – these lot get boring after a while.”
The sound of the ambulance sirens managed to disperse the crowd as the vehicle dashed away. Both officers waited until the final watchers had walked away before looking back at the site. The fire engine was still parked opposite, the men beginning to pack away the hoses as they patted each other on the back. Beside the car wreckages, three young men were standing on the pavement, covered in bandages and their clothes crumpled from the accident. Donna and Castiel approached them, Castiel pulling out a notepad and pen.
“Yeah, that’s true,” The man smirked, “And you also tried to get someone out of a burning car without proper protection.”
The angel looked over at the younger Winchester, who now had tears welling in his eyes.
Mary gazed down at her boy sympathetically, giving his shoulder another comforting squeeze, “Well there’ll be another time, don’t worry sweetie.”
“You’re cursed with a spell that’s making you forget everything, Dean. It isn’t in your control to remember. My name is Castiel,” Cas tried to smile, but seeing how much Dean was struggling to remember things was too painful.
It’s now or never, Winchester, Dean thought, raising his head as he stepped in front of Cas, “Has anyone told you that you have eyes like sapphires?”
“We’ll go there when our shift ends,” Benny suggested, taking a large gulp of his coffee.
“I don’t know,” Dean replied honestly, patting the ground where he had poorly hidden the tape, “He was Cas. He was the one who brought me back, the one who was there when your dad couldn’t be.”
On the other side of town, Dean Winchester pulled his Baby over to the side of the road. Dean could instantly notice his father’s hunched figure leaning against the side wall of Walker’s Bar, clasping an empty glass bottle. He stepped out of the car, hastily walking over to his father’s drunken form.
of who I am but it’s just… I’m just…” He shakes his head, swallowing thickly in an attempt to stop himself from welling up. “I should be over this by now!”
“Uh… shower?” Dean says, trying not to look too closely at whatever the fuck is making his groin slippery.
They lost precious time in the single moment of that act—one that lasted a second, an hour, a lifetime. Castiel had no need for breath, and yet he felt breathless in touching this human, this person whose warmth and light, palpable from a distance, was blinding so close. God had lied. Beautiful words about angels as the bringers of love and light—all falsehoods at the feet of his one human being, this righteous man, whose love was so… so steadfast, so
Cas’s fingers play along Dean’s belt, quickly undoing the clasp as he tosses it to the side. Dean grins against his cheek. Shyly drapes his own handfasting cloth around Castiel’s shoulders and presses a kiss to the hinge of his jaw. Grinning at each other, Cas grasps Dean’s tartan and pulls, unwavering in his gaze as he walks back towards the slope of the hill. He stumbles thrice before falling back onto the grass and taking Dean down with him.
They shift until Cas is sitting, swapping wet, lazy kisses as Dean straddles his lap. The grinding is nice, too, he thinks as Dean leads them in a languorous rhythm. He tangles their fingers and thumbs at Cas’s ring and they slow until all they’re doing is holding each other. It’s completely indulgent. Totally sybaritic. Hedonism at its finest.
The john’s getting close. He wheezes when he comes, and the taste of him makes Dean gag—he swallows, though; sticks out his tongue and looks up from the ground with big green eyes. The john snorts. Shakes his head.
“Yes,” Cas agrees faintly.
“Yes.”
has ferried supplies from system to system. Their suppliers were kept anonymous, their clients even more so; the whole thing had been shrouded in such secrecy that by the time it had been revealed, he’d had trouble understanding. All this time, and Dean Winchester was in the business of compassion. Of kindness.
By the time Westley and Buttercup have reached the Fire Swamp, Dean and Cas have drifted from making out to aimless touching and holding. It’s skin on skin, and it’s friggin’ glorious. Dean runs a hand through Cas’s hair and Cas leans into it like a cat. “Love you,” Dean breathes, because it’s still hard to say. Cas catches his mouth in a lazy kiss.
God created the Garden.
Cas sighs into his shemagh, touching fingertips to the scar on his forearm. Food, water, medical equipment, learning materials… clothing. Books. For a million different peoples on a million different planets,
Castiel toys with the edge of his shemagh, exposing his mouth just enough to take a bite of the spiced, juicy fruit. He had always been told he was a wild thing; too curious, too engaged, too concerned. The Edenish—the true Edenish, who trace their lineage back to the Seraphim—they see through the paltry physical realm into what’s beyond. They are calm and of steady disposition. Unbiased in their opinions and unerringly fair in their judgements. They are above the weakness of the nephil—the commoner, the peasant, tainted by their ancestors’ desire to lay with those from other realms. Half-bloods.
Claire rolls her eyes but accepts the plastic flute, watching quizzically as Dean hands one to Jack before stepping over the graveyard of empty pizza boxes to throw himself onto the couch. “This one’s for you,” he tells Cas, handing it over.
He’s never been on vacation before.
It was not a burden, to love the Universe his Father created. Castiel walked along the sulphurous, scorched shores of the primordial beach and loved the creature of flesh that hauled itself onto the coarse black sand. He leaned over the very edge of heaven and watched pterodactyls fly and felt his own wings twitch. When God sent a meteor for the dinosaurs, Castiel reassured himself that the subsequent genocide must have been borne of love, too.
He can feel Cas grinning into his neck.
“Hey, Dean?”
“And it was—
Cas reaches for the lumpy bright purple fruit at the bottom of his bag and sighs, wondering if it’s safe enough to consume out in the open. It’s been a decade since the Novaks had any power here, but showing his face is always risky—technically, he still has a claim to these people.
“I will.”
. He’d reached for Dean’s mug and had taken a long, loud slurp.
Dean moves to hold his hand.
Dean’s flush climbs to his ears. “Just watch the goddamn movie, asshole.”
“No.” Dean can feel embarrassed, drunk tears welling in his eyes and he bites his lip, blinking in an attempt to get rid of them. “M’fine, promise. I want to—I have to—I—”
“Fuck you, fucking asshole!”
The shower was more than big enough for two and had water pressure to die for. They had a totally unobstructed view of the ocean, and despite the
“The stables.”
. They stuck it to Cas’s ungrateful, shitty fucking family. They beat the unbeatable team. Them; Dean’s broken little family.
Castiel knows what they're doing is dangerous. Forbidden. He’s been told it is wrong, that there is no love, no affection between two men beyond that of brotherhood; that when men lie together it is nothing but a debauched, violent act. But with Dean… Castiel loves Dean as devotedly as he would any woman. They come to together in all kinds of ways; gentle and sweet, playful — and their roughness, when it happens, is never violent, never meant to cause hurt beyond pleasure. The love Castiel has for Dean is… it’s every way he knows how to love another person.
Putting the ring directly into the cereal is too risky, so Dean figures the safest bet is to shove it between the cardboard and the waxy plastic container thing full of horse food.
Between Cas’s penchant to leave used mugs everywhere and his sudden desire to take up cooking and crafting and
“So how’d you get there?”
“Team NW, wow it’s been a wild ride for you,” the MC says. “You’re amazing. Watching your journey through this race has been a total treat.” He turns to Cas, and Dean hates reality TV. He
“What?”
“Mostly,” Cas says. “I just… Well, I wrote about how thankful I am. To know you. To love you. Doing so has been a gift, Dean. Really.”
“Hey,” Dean murmurs, reaching across the seat. The clock strikes midnight and he loops an arm around Sam’s shoulders, bringing him in for a squeeze and a kiss to the side of his head. “Happy new year, bitch.”
Dean frowns. “I don’t need your pity.”
Dean forces himself to pull back and Cas’s hand is immediately at his cheek and jaw, the ring cool and smooth and wonderful. He can’t stop himself from leaning into the touch. “But you know, right? That—that you never have to find another home if you don’t want to. And that the thing you wanted, you can have it and then some but it’s
“Sweetheart.”
“What kind of snacks?”
The kid—Jason, his name tag says—almost breaks his neck with how fast he looks up, staring at the two of them. Dean not-so-subtly wraps an arm around Cas’s waist. Cas rolls his eyes.
He’s beautiful, unashamed of his nudity and his arousal as he sits back in Castiel’s lap, staring. His nipples pebble in the cold air, and he huffs something between a laugh and a moan as Cas rises up to kiss him there; teeth scraping across the sensitive flesh before laving his tongue over it and moving on. Dean buries his hands in Cas’s dark hair and breathes out heavy all at once. Castiel likes Dean’s chest — the red-tinged hair across his solar plexus, the strength there. He pays special attention to his breastbone and nipples, blowing on the latter in time with the slow, easy slide of his hand downwards. His palm moves all the way down to Dean’s knee before starting the journey in reverse, this time dragging his nails up the inside of his betrothed’s thigh. Dean’s mouth drops open with a low sound that Cas easily swallows.
Dean looks up from his cheese, swallowing thickly.
“Mornin’, sunshine.”
, but there’s something fragile and shaking taking up residence in his chest and if he just tries one more time maybe he can—maybe they’ll… Cas guides Dean’s between his legs again, wrapping freckled fingers around his soft prick. Dean touches without real purpose.
Cas shrugs, moving through the ship. He makes his way to the galley and immediately starts unloading the most delicate of his spoils into the coolbox. Presses the ancient touchpad on the door and rolls his eyes. “Whoever disabled the touchpad,
“You ready for me, Casanova?”
“O-okay.”
They freeze.
“I want an annulment,” he’s saying. “You’re such a —”
She’s not meant for racing or war, but she’s great at supply running. Some of this is Dean’s expertise, but most of it is owed to Baby’s lineage; a failed line of family transport vehicles that guzzled space dust but excelled in reliability. Cas thinks they could probably take her to the edge of the Universe and she’d keep going. This feature of hers is useful for times like this; barreling towards the next pickup, Baby can be left on autopilot for family meal.
Dean shrugs. “Doesn’t really matter. We did. And we haven’t killed each other yet, so… seems to be going pretty well.”
There’s something big knocking around in his chest, something about hearts and homes and people, and it’s all Dean can do to wrap an arm around Cas’s waist and
But the Neanderthals died, and so Castiel turned to humanity with the rest of Heaven. Waiting. Watching. There were rumours that humanity was the Father’s chosen people, and Castiel wondered briefly, treasonously, at all the creatures who had been casualties His divine search. But Castiel was a being of duty, of
“I could walk you to your door?”
, he should be living in a palace made of greenery, in a forest leagues from here, dressed in finery and with a circlet adorning his brow. They would call him
“I love you, too, you loser.”
“Um—”
books. The angel and the older brother. You ever read those?” He’s holding out a hand, presumably for a credit card. Cas has this funny, weird little smile on his face and Dean is pretty sure he looks like he’s... y’know, that little pinwheel of death. The buffering. “Uh, sir?” the kid asks. “I need a card.”
They skip town three days later.
Despite the fact that Cas is pretty sure it’s considered impolite to do so, he moves the small table and chairs from the balcony and makes a nest on the marble floor out of spare blankets and colourful pillows from the couch. He tries to mitigate the potential mess by laying down some of their many extra towels. Room service knocks, Cas pulls on a robe, and then the smell of coffee and food starts rousing Dean from bed. Cas pushes the food cart—complete with opened champagne bottle—to the door of the balcony before entering the bedroom.
“I love you.”
Dad’s gonna kill him. Dean deserves it, too—but it ain’t like Sam ever goes out, so when the kid had told him he was going to a house party Dean had pretty much been powerless to refuse. Of course, if god exists he’s a cruel, twisted fuckface, because Dad blows in at 11:50 covered in ghoul guts.
. “How do we…?”
But Sarah squeezes Dean’s hand and he squeezes back and he’s suddenly really glad he invited her—that he’s not alone with Sam, both in their pjs staring at the boob tube while everybody else goes to parties and misses curfew. Swallowing thickly, Dean threads their fingers and ducks his head, green eyes still glued to her flushed cheeks and lopsided paper crown. He can’t stop looking at her, not for a second; she’s beautiful.
Cas blushes at his own words parroted back to him, but concedes with a nod.
Whatever, same friggin’ difference.
Cas wakes to the image of Dean shirtless and half-hanging into the footwell. He presses a kiss to Cas’s mouth and pushes a hand through his hair. It’s cold, maybe; hard to tell with the way they’re pressed together, but sun is streaming in through the trees and the cracked windows bring the smell of salt and seaweed and the odd cry of a gull.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “I know that, too.” His voice cracks, blinking back tears despite his smile. He bites his lip. “And I don’t know why I keep—why I’m so—”
. So I’m gonna work hard, because—because I’ve never found a home inside a person like the one I found in you and that is a goddamn gift. I
He is
Cas looks up from his own evening ablutions, goosebumps raised over his skin as he reaches back into the stream to wash his face. Dripping, he stands, mouth tugging into a smirk as he reaches for the other man. “Here, let me —”
First, he hid it in the sewing kit his mom gave them. The innards of that thing haven’t seen the light of day in a literal decade, but Cas is an angel and has been making masks out of their old clothes. It’d been terrifying to come into the room and see the love of his life fiddling with a tin of safety pins that also held the band.
“Hey! Save it for midnight!” Donna shuffles through the door with more flutes in hand, handing one to Dean and passing one to Jody as she moves into the room next, followed by Kaia, Alex, Patience, Sam and Eileen.
, its purpose mysterious enough for its captain-cum-mechanic to take one look at the offered credits and nod.
“The Roman Empress Elagabalus once invited, um, a gladiator to the palace because he had an exceptionally large penis, and when he couldn’t please her, she banished him. Her male lover, Hierocles, had given the gladiator something so he wouldn’t become erect.”
They touch and tease and half-run to the bedroom, and despite Cas vowing aloud that he has to give Dean his gift because they always forget, they’re always distracted by one another and so exchange them the morning after but this time,
“I personally only prefer bathing in ice water,” Dean says. “Something about feeling like my balls are gonna fall off makes me all tingly.”
The kiss Cas gives him is not so much suited to a fuck on the kitchen floor as it is to someone’s wedding night. He pulls away with his crooked half-smile, the one that lives mostly in his eyes as he leans in to nudge their noses. “Always,” he breathes.
Dean has kicked off all the covers and is sleeping on his stomach.
The microwave beeps.
Dean nods. “Cool. Coffee? And water?”
Des squeezes his hand and finds a darkened corner in the small hallway, and he slides his long fingers over Dean’s hips and pulls him close and steps forward, but instead of being devoured suddenly Dean’s being kissed, soft and sweet and exploratory, like they’re dating or like each other or some shit, and it’s so goddamn nice Dean is pretty sure his nails are biting red half-moons into his own palms.
“Everybody back away!” Donna yelled, putting her arms out in front. Castiel followed her lead, having to shove back a man who was getting too close to them.
“Remind me when we meet again on Friday,” Charlie winked, waiting for him to move out of the booth before sliding her way across, “Until next time, Castiel Novak.” She brushed down her jeans, then saluted the two, “Peace out bitches,” She called as she walked out of the bar.
“I had my first call today, a three-car collision. No fatalities, as far as I’m aware.”
But he didn’t focus on the movie. His eyes were still on his trapped hand, which had now become intertwined with Cas’s. The angel was rubbing his fingers in a circular motion along the back of Dean’s hand, pausing when there was a loud sound erupting from the TV. Seizing the opportunity, Dean held tighter onto the hand, smiling when he noticed Cas looking back at him.
Dean glanced back at his mother in desperation, his eyes tearing up fearfully. He turned around when Gabriel cleared his throat, announcing that they were by the other boy, “Cassie, this is Dean, our neighbour.”
Suddenly, the hive disappeared, leaving Dean and Castiel alone in the front yard. The black-haired boy gripped onto Dean, getting his attention, “Did you hear me?”
“On cookies, or pancakes or waffles.”
“H-Hi,” Dean stuttered, managing to rip his arm out of Gabriel’s grip and extending it out to the other boy, “I’m Dean.”
Dean had never said anything out loud, but Sam knew first-hand the type of grief his brother had gone through when Cas was taken by the Empty. It wasn’t the grief that they’d experienced when Mary died, nor was it the pain of losing Bobby back in that hospital. It wasn’t the grief of losing a brother, or any other kind of relative. It was the grief of losing a -
“Right, okay,” Dean cleared his throat, looking around the room, “So if you saved me from hell, what are you?”
“And yet you didn’t pull away,” Cas smirked, “just because I made the first move doesn’t mean it wasn’t reciprocated.”
“We’re looking for that witch, remember?”
Castiel burst through the motel door, scaring Dean who had been peacefully resting on his bed. Rowena nodded solemnly at the angel, and Sam had gotten out of the chair by the table, walking over to his friend, “We need to hunt down these witches before it’s too late.”
Dean had to pinch his nose to stop the suffocating smell of alcohol burning his nostrils, pretending to be wiping at his face to cover it, “We met the new neighbours! They have two boys and they’re both really cool!”
“Yeah! But we have to show that we will be good boys first, don’t we?”
All three men tumbled into the master bedroom, not having time to rest before Rowena shoved Sam and Cas out and locked the doors. Sam sighed, leaning against the wall to regain his breath. Cas glanced over at him, taking in the ruffled clothing and trail of blood beginning to drip from a cut on his forehead, “I’m sorry I wasn’t here to help.”
“Well, you call me Cas.”
“Char, let the man be,” Benny joked again, finishing his beer and clunking it back on the table, “Not everyone has to watch Star Wars to be interesting.”
“How did we meet?”
A gentle knock at the door caused both men to peer over, Dean instantly getting up and walking towards it.
“We were what?” Cas asked, reaching for the television remote and turning down the volume. Dean gulped, fiddling with his shirt again, “You know… A thing?”
Cas nods. Steps closer. Kisses him again, sweet and slow.
Thanks to
Cas traces his finger gingerly around Dean’s hole before carefully pressing inside. He kisses at Dean’s cock and watches the way his knees draw up and part, the way his body bows; his hand, buried in Cas’s hair, pushes him into his groin and Castiel
for the prompt!
nights—where Cas pulls away frustrated, touches himself to no avail, lays in bed wondering
“And tea,” Dean repeated, laughing as more bees started appearing from the hive.
Cas blushed, “Technically, yes.”
“Sam, over here!” Dean called, standing a few feet away. Sam walked over, having to force himself to stop before stepping on what had caught Dean’s interest.
“You’re not meant to eat honey raw, Cas!” Dean shouted, continuing to poke at the hive.
She pushed against the door, being careful to not make much noise. There was no sound coming from the crib, Sam was still fast asleep. Dean followed behind her as she entered the hallway, “Why don’t you go to your room and make something for your new friend?”
“No arguments! There is no way in hell you’re sitting next to me wearing your normal clothes when we’re watching ‘Godzilla vs Mothra’.”
Donna had been the one to introduce Castiel to the rest of the police force: Garth, who was the second newest face in the department; Alex, Jody’s adopted daughter; Mick, the IT worker who lived in his den of computers on the lower floor, and Ketch. Despite taking a liking to most of the team, Castiel felt a sense of unease when alone with Ketch. Donna had said nothing negative towards the British officer, but the way he glared at anyone who walked past, or the determined walk to wherever his destination was, seemed to unsettle Castiel. He hadn’t engaged in a conversation with him yet, briskly moving out of his path to avoid interaction.
Once he was satisfied with the front of the card, he skilfully folded it in half, and opened it up. Grabbing a blue gel pen, he tugged the lid off and began writing inside the card:
It was Cas’s turn to blush, rubbing the back of his neck with his other hand.
“The only spell I know takes more time than what Dean’s got. He’s already begun to forget himself, everyone he’s ever known. Ever loved.”
The trash can had been knocked over, its contents spilling over the overgrown lawn. Shards of broken glass scattered the front porch, glinting in the light from the streetlamps, empty cans scrunched and tossed carelessly in front of the house.
“They’re good for you,” Mary chuckled, “Now, corn or peas?”
“Uh, Mary Winchester is my mom. And Cas is-”
Nodding her head, Mary walked over to the freezer, taking out the ripped bag of greens. Dean waited by the dining table, tapping his fingers against the wooden frame of a chair as he watched as his mother masterfully moved around the kitchen. As a pot of water was being filled in the sink, she switched on the stove, flames flickering underneath the gas hub.
Whilst he kept telling himself that Cas was still alive, Dean knew that accepting the fact that he would never see that trench-coated angel again would help him move on. Surprisingly, it had been his own idea to create a gravestone for the angel, somewhere for the hunter to seek solace when memories of Cas became too haunting. It had been Dean who suggested to Sam that they decorate the area surrounding the gravestone with totems reminding them of the angel:
“Castiel isn’t dead, per se. The Empty took him - he isn’t in a physical state that I can return to Earth, nor is he in a spiritual form for me to reconstruct into a human. And even if that were possible, the Empty and I aren’t necessarily on negotiating terms at the moment.”
Cas let out a warm laugh, “Deal.”
“Okay, jackass. You’re missing out on the best bit of the movie with all this talking.”
“Yes, my family live there.”
“Something I should have done years ago,” He replied, walking determinedly towards his angel. Castiel was still perched at the front of the beige car, quickly looking down at the ground to pretend he wasn’t trying to listen in. He glanced up as he heard Dean get closer, “How are you feeling Dean?”
“Well, he is old enough to make his own decisions, Dean. Even if it hurts you, you still gotta be there to support him, as that’s what family does,” Benny replied, approaching the far table and pouring himself a cup of coffee.
“Hi Castiel.”
Benny chuckled as he saw Castiel brace himself for another punch, “Take it easy, Char. Just because Dean’s gone doesn’t mean you can hastle the poor man.”
The two were now sitting together on Dean’s bed, the small, motel television playing Scooby Doo in front of them. Dean didn’t seem to mind the fact that his thigh was brushed up against Cas’, or that they were practically glued together from the shoulder down. Not that Cas was complaining. They had managed to do this before back at the bunker, whenever Dean needed the company or whenever the hunter felt that Castiel’s pop culture needed to be improved through ‘classic’ films. In all honesty, those moments were the highlights of Castiel’s time with the Winchesters, as it enabled his bond to grow stronger with Dean.
He whistled as he entered the room, earning himself a side-glare from the angel as he placed the bowl in Cas’s lap and the bottles on the table in front of them, “You ready to watch the best Godzilla movie ever created?”
Dean and Benny waited outside the bar, Benny taking a long breath from his cigarette before puffing the smoke out. Despite being a firefighter, he had managed to become addicted to smoking, even though he was also well aware of the harm it was doing internally. Charlie bounded towards the two, wearing a Ravenclaw shirt and ripped jeans, “What’s up bitches?”
Castiel nodded, hiding his face to try and cover the growing blush on his cheeks. In that time, Dean had managed to walk around the bed, now standing directly in front of the angel, “It was hard to see before, but your eyes are like sapphires.”
“Up the stairs. Everything she needs for the spell is in the master bedroom.”
Before Dean could retaliate, he was being dragged back towards the grownups. He realised that there was a short man standing beside the woman who must’ve been Castiel’s Momma.
Dean nodded, “He wanted to grow honey bees and bumblebees!”
To make a point, Gabriel waved at his mother, whistling as he did, “Yoo hoo!”
“No, Dean. It’s not cool,” Sam took a step back, rubbing his forehead, “Killing the witch was supposed to be the cure. So if he’s already dead, then why are you still…”
“Favourite character?”
Dean whistled, leaning back on his chair, “I knew I should have used an angel pickup line. An angel huh? And we’re friends?”
Dean peered down at the stone, wiping at the graving as if he were wiping away tears, “I’ll be back soon, Cas. I promise.” He turned around, slowly following his nephew back home.
“You said I was hot,” Cas replied, somehow his cheeks blushing even more. Dean blushed too, clearing his throat nervously, “Well, I ain’t lying.”
“I dunno, got a crush on anyone? You know, seeing as we aren’t a thing.”
“Why does it take so long for kernels to open?” Cas’s voice echoed through the room, reaching the hunter before the angel’s figure reached the kitchen doorway.
Gabriel had helped Castiel move into his new apartment, checking that the water and electricity was working, “These things usually get brushed over by new tenants, Cassie,” He lectured his brother about the reasons behind the checks, fiddling with the heating and showers whilst he was at it. The apartment itself was larger than the one he had lived in when he was in New York, the new place having three adequately-sized bedrooms, two bathrooms and a fairly expansive living room space. His fridge was large enough to cram Gabriel into (which Castiel had seized immediate opportunity to do when the older man was playing with the temperature gauge), and there were plenty of cupboards to fill with food and plates. They had gone out to buy Castiel new furniture, with a 65-inch television being the ‘piece de resistance’ in the apartment. Once the necessities had been aquired, including the desk by the balcony door and a somewhat decent computer for Castiel to use for work, Gabriel had returned back to New York, going back to his café.
“Will Sammy get to meet Castiel?” Dean asked, returning back to Mary’s side.
As he sprinted to the fire, Castiel crashed into a firefighter, both men stumbling back.
He sighed, throwing his head head back as he downed the whiskey, “Did he cause more trouble?”
“Your name is Dean Winchester,” Castiel finished the sentence, hoping to try and uplift the hunter’s spirit, “Do you remember my name, Dean?”
“Sounds like an infection,” Dean snarked, smiling at his joke before turning his attention away when he received a glare from Sam.
Dean nodded, his cheeks flushing a crimson, “I remember, Cas.”
“What if he doesn’t want to stay friends?”
“No wonder Sam left your faggot self when he got old enough – ain’t no normal boy wants to be raised by a degenerate like you.”
“Hold hands or watch one of the best films of all time?”
“It is earlier than last time! It isn’t even midnight yet!” Charlie whined.
“Not that, smartass. I mean-”
“This is serious,” Sam growled, “Look, I think Dean’s been hexed, okay?”
“We can be best friends forever and ever!” Dean cheered, jumping around. Castiel joined him, laughing before laying on his back in the grass, “We will always be friends, Dean.”
Sam huffed in amusement, “Dory?”
“Leave me the fuck alone you fag,” He began resisting, slamming his fist against Dean’s chest, “Let me go!”
“So how do we cure Dean?”
The other boy glanced up from where he was crouched on the sidewalk, a pointed stick in his hand. The first thing Dean noticed about him were the striking blue eyes that the raven-haired boy had, surrounded by sun kissed freckles on his cheeks and nose. He was wearing a loose plaid shirt and dirty shorts, his shoelaces untied.
Dean nodded, using his free hand to wipe the tears from his eyes, “Yeah, we got this.”
“You have to work with me, John,” Dean subverted the conversation, blinking away any sign of his emotions being hurt by his father’s words, “The faster you cooperate, the quicker you get to rest.”
“He was the most awkward person I’ve ever met, and I hated his guts when we first got to know each other,” Dean smiled to himself, tilting his head up so he could look at the leaves of the oak tree above him, “But he was also one of the most caring and self-sacrificing sons-of-a that I’ve ever met too.”
“Some types of tea do, yes,” She answered, “But the type we let you have doesn’t.”
“None of your goddamn business, Dean,” John replied, pushing open the car door and stumbling out. His son followed after him, carefully stepping on gaps between the stacks of rubbish. John made it to the front door first, shoving his entire weight against it and tumbling in, cursing as he fell. Before Dean could offer to help him up, he snatched his arm away, “Don’t fucking touch me. I don’t need your gay hands on me.”
“Novak, over here!”
“I don’t,” the boy replied, “but whoever they were, they were important to you, uncle.”
Benny threw his head back as he laughed, hitting Dean in the back with his palm as he failed to keep in his reaction, “Isn’t that the screwup who almost stopped you saving that girl, cher?”
“Always,” Dean whispered, standing up and resting a hand on his nephew’s shoulder, “Come on, I’m sure your dad is looking for you by now.” Softly, he nudged the boy away from the grave, pulling a forced smile as Nico ran back towards the bunker.
Cas smiled, seeing that Rowena was chuckling at Sam’s crimsoning cheeks.
The older Winchester made his way into the living room, throwing himself onto the armchair, “Bring me a fucking beer.”
“I need your help, Rowena.”
He ran up the stairs into his bedroom, standing in front of his drawer. He hadn’t touched the card for his new neighbour since having finished it, the blue paper still underneath the clock. Delicately, he pulled it out from under the clock, holding it carefully in his hands. Turning around, he sprinted down the stairs, throwing it into his mother’s face, “Look what I made!”
“Dean!” John chuckled, easily picking up his eldest and swirling him above his head, “What have you been up to today?”
“I don’t think I helped much,” Castiel blushed, scratching awkwardly at his arm, “I got in your way.”
“I’m an angel of the lord.”
“Let’s just say, if you see John Winchester outside a bar, you better pull the gun out on him before he pulls one out on you,” Donna raised her bottle towards the officer, “Trust me, that man is bad news.”
“I’m sure he would love to meet your new friend,” she replied, looking back at the couple, “Will that be all right?”
“I’m surprised it’s taken her this long to interrogate the young man,” Ellen laughed, continuing to wipe down the surface of the bar, “Hasn’t he been here two weeks now?”
“You said something?” Dean asked.
John peeked his head around the corner of the doorway, smiling as he saw his sleeping family. He returned his attention back to the kitchen, picking up a chilled bottle of beer from the fridge and downing it, continuing his evening drinking.
The two exchanged looks before Naomi spoke up, “I don’t see why not, so long as it isn’t too much trouble for you?”
“Gabriel has lots of energy,” Dean remarked, “Castiel isn’t good at talking to others.”
The station alarm blared out through the garage, triggering both Dean and Benny to run towards the uniform hangers, slipping into their jackets.
Mary nudged her son towards the extended hand, smiling reassuringly at him as he reached to take the candy. Before Dean could react, Gabriel grabbed his arm, dragging him away from the two women, “Come on, you’ll love Cassie!”
“Katniss, always.”
“It has been wonderful coming over,” Naomi said, brushing down her floral shirt and looking down at her shoes, “We must return the offer sometime.”
“Don’t be strangers!” Mary called out, waiting until the family had arrived at their front yard before closing the door. Dean sighed against her, his head still lowered, “Did I do something wrong, Mommy?”
“He is such a well-behaved baby,” Naomi said, standing up from her seat. The other Novaks followed, pushing in their chairs.
“New neighbours eh? Are the parents decent?”
“Goodnight Donna,” Castiel replied, leaving the bar through the main doors. He began his walk back to the apartment, which he had calculated was a ten minute stroll. As he walked along the sidewalk, he couldn’t stop his mind worrying over his new companion. If all of his friends knew that John was bad, why was Dean still with him? Nobody had told him what the relation was - Castiel could only assume it was familial.
“We would love to have you all round for dinner at some point,” Mary offered, “It's been a while since we had guests over.”
“Okay!” Dean replied excitedly, running up the stairs and into his bedroom. He rummaged through the arts and crafts drawer in the corner of the room, pulling out his favourite pack of crayons and a couple of pieces of card. As delicately as he could, he began drawing a blue flower in the middle of a piece of green card. He coloured in each petal with a different shade of blue, adding yellow specks in the centre and then yellow dots all around the wonky flower. He picked up the black crayon, sticking his tongue out as he drew black stripes on the patches of yellow and putting little lines at one end of each dot, making dozens of buzzing bees on the card.
She chuckled as she replied, “Maybe not that soon, but perhaps next week?”
“Naomi and Chuck Novak were very pleasant to chat with,” Mary interjected, walking into the hallway bouncing Sammy on her hip, “They’ll be coming over for dinner next week.”
In the background, Dean could hear the shrill noise of voices on the television, his dad flicking through the channels as his feet knocked off whatever had been on the coffee table. Dean continued collecting up the broken ceramic pieces of plate, scraping them into the trash. He closed the cupboards and the fridge, making a mental note to run to the store tomorrow to restock the house.
“You can catch up with me when I visit at the end of the week, remember?” Gabriel reminded him. His brother had planned to stay over at the apartment for a few days to explore the area, “check out the dating options”, as he had phrased it.
“Do you happen to know whose grave this is, Nico?” Dean replied, fiddling with the mixtape in his right hand.
“Like I got hit with two witch spells in less than 48 hours,” Dean joked. Cas nodded, moving away from the car.
“Hello there!” Mary said warmly, tightening her grip on Dean as he fidgeted, “We saw the moving van and thought it’d be nice to help you get settled in. I’m Mary, and this is my eldest son, Dean.” She raised the hand that Dean was clutching, waving it so that it looked like Dean was waving too.
Gabriel slapped his brother’s arm, pushing him towards his friend, “Cassie don’t be rude.”
“So why did you want to come to a place like Lawrence?”
“Well, you’re talking to me, so yes.”
Dean wandered over to the closest bed to the window, sitting down on the edge. He began taking off his jacket, grunting as his arm got stuck in the sleeve, “Dude, if a witch got a clear shot of me, I would be dead, okay? I wouldn’t be freakin’, uh… Dory.”
Mary paused, looking over her shoulder at the boy. She sighed, “He’s gone out.”
“Sure.”
Castiel didn’t realise how drastic the move from New York would be. After his breakup with Balthazar, he couldn’t stand walking down the same streets he once had with his ex, seeing the places that they had visited as a couple before the man had broken his heart. Of course, his brother, Gabriel, had been supportive and understanding towards Castiel’s departure, promising to visit his younger brother as often as his work would allow him. Gabriel had been the one who suggested moving to Lawrence – far enough away and a change in scenery so that Castiel could start anew.
Cas felt his heart skip a beat. Did Dean actually mean it? He would want that? Maybe with him? The angel glanced over at the door, his lips curling in a gentle smile. He hadn’t heard any communication from Rowena or Sam for a while. Hopefully they were almost done, so that Dean would be saved.
Dean peered up at his mother with his emerald eyes, “Like tomorrow?”
“Who’s John?” Castiel asked, more interested in their conversation than being attacked by Charlie.
“My little brother. Mommy thinks he’ll have the same coloured hair as me!”
“I heard,” the boy replied bluntly, earning himself a slap on the arm by his older brother.
The boy dropped his head, sulking, “Sorry Mom.”
Dean looked over at his mother, noticing how Mary was standing with her arms crossed over her chest. She seemed less tense than she usually was, making the little boy happy. If his mom liked the new neighbours, he could hang out with Castiel more. And even though the boy was slightly peculiar, Dean was starting to grow fond of him and his quirkiness.
Mary chuckled as they reached their front door, “Maybe when the time is nearer.”
When Dean would disappear for hours on-end, Sam didn’t worry about where he was. If his brother didn’t respond to his calls, Sam wouldn’t worry. If Dean wasn’t at the bunker, he was there.
“He’s not drunk.”
“Is the den all set up?”
The boy squealed happily, putting the card on the dining table, “Can I help with dinner?”
“We don’t even know if he’ll be in there,” Dean replied, his lips curling into a small smile.
“To Sam,” Cas replied.
“I’m an angel of the lord,” Cas repeated, tilting his head. Was Dean’s hearing off too?
“I suppose so.”
“Easy now love,” Chuck smirked, putting his hand on his wife’s shoulder, “Don’t forget you have your own little angels.”
“How have you never seen Star Wars?!”
Castiel gasped, “Wait, you remember?”
Rowena sighed, “We could do a memory spell. The obliviate spell wipes the memory clean over time, but it’s intricate magic. I-”
We get a little insight into Dean's background, and if you hadn't figured out from the tags, John Winchester isn't the best parent. When isn't there drama in the Winchester family?
“What did you want to ask, Castiel?” The man said, looking down at the two boys.
“It’s the only way she knows how to show affection,” Donna joked, moving away when Charlie threatened to punch her.
Sam coughed at the final part of the question, looking back at Dean, “Sirens change their appearance to match their victim’s preferences.”
Beloved friend, father, and angel.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
So do Dean and I, Cas thought, sighing as the two headed towards the parked vehicles. Rowena began packing the Black Grimoire into her suitcase, and Cas walked towards his Lincoln Continental, perching himself on the bonnet as he waited for the brothers.
“You should totally let me read some of your stuff, I know a few people who could get it published,” Charlie suggested, smiling as the officer’s cheeks turned more crimson.
As he entered, the sudden feeling of loneliness hit him. Castiel reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, strolling through the contacts until he found his brother’s name. Putting the phone on speaker, he placed it down on the counter. Gabriel answered on the second ring, “Cassie! Why are you calling me at midnight? Did you get mugged?”
“Yes, Dean.”
“Now, should you experience any odd memories from when you were hexed, conversations, you let me know?”
“When did he forget about me?”
Castiel Winchester.
Castiel turned to look at him, squinting his eyes, “We’re leaving.”
Castiel watched from the table as Dean headed towards the main door, his shoulders tensing as he spoke on the phone, “Who’s he talking to?”
“Come on, Dad, let’s get you home,” Dean pulled his father’s free arm over his shoulder, wrapping his around John’s waist to support him. He could feel the intrusive eyes staring at him from other people on the street as he tried to get his dad’s frame away from the wall.
“No offence officer, but this is where my department major,” The firefighter said, in his arms a large piece of equipment shaped like deformed scissors. Not waiting for Castiel to respond, he ran to the far side of the flaming car, “Benny, aim the hose over here!” He shouted, taking a step back as a blast of water struck the front of the car, partially diminishing the flames. The firefighter began cutting away at the burnt metal, trying to reassure the victim in the car to stay away from the door before he managed to tear it away. Castiel watched as he reached his arms into the gaping hole of the deathtrap, pulling out a soot-coated woman.
“That’s stupid,” Castiel declared, picking up the stick again, “Momma said tea is good for you as it has good things in it.”
Castiel gasped when he felt Dean intertwine his fingers with his closest hand, seeking more comfort. Feeling Cas suddenly tense up, Dean let go of his hand, his cheeks blushing again, “I uh, I’m sorry. I thought we were, you know.”
Neither Sam nor Rowena were surprised at how quickly the angel had arrived after Sam had called. Despite his grace depleting at a too fast rate, Castiel had forced his wings to carry him to the motel that the Winchesters were residing in. Sam had managed to fill in some of the blanks on the phone, and from the sound of it, Dean didn’t have long before he would forget everything.
“I wanted intel, Rowena, not a house call.”
“He’s never seen Star Wars!” Charlie cried, shaking her head, “And you could have been so perfect.”
Shaking his head, Sam hurdled over a fallen tree, grimacing as his landing made a loud thud.
“Not my finest moment, I have to admit.”
“Cool.”
“Sorry Dad,” he mumbled, peering over his shoulder, “I’ll see you next week at dinner then,” he said before running inside the house, leaving Dean with the grownups.
“He’s lucky he’s got Dean,” Benny replied, clinking his bottle with hers before downing some of the beer.
The main door to the bar opened, Donna pushing against it and a hesistant Castiel walking behind her. Charlie softly kicked the two men opposite her, nodding her head to the direction of the door, “He’s here.”
Cas nodded, sitting down in the chair opposite the hunter, “Of course. What would you like to know?”
“Hmm? Oh, I like reading, sometimes writing.”
Castiel continued making his tea, scooping a heavy teaspoon of honey from the jar and dipping it into the herbal tea, using the spoon to calmingly stir the liquid.
Dean stopped, grabbing onto Sam’s forearm and forcing him to halt as well, “Wait, witches are real?”
“Then you must’ve really liked him!” Nico yelled, jumping up, “Dad tells Mom that he loves her every day, and brings her flowers and cooks for her and dances with her. And when they think I’m not looking, they even kiss!” He whispered the last bit, giggling once he said it. Dean smiled at him, his eyes beginning to water at the child’s innocence and excitement.
“Uh, Cas?”
“What? No, it’s fine, Cas,” Sam reassured, reaching into his pocket to pull out a tissue to dab at his head wound, “It was important that someone was with Dean, otherwise he would’ve roamed off and we wouldn’t have been able to save him.”
“When you’re
They’re first.
And then he’s gone.
“Breakfast,” Cas says.
“Violin,” Castiel grins.
,” he breathes.
“I can live with that.”
Dean feels himself smiling back. “Uh—yeah. Marissa. Bye?”
Dean looks out the window.
“We'll make it up as we go?”
They help each other get dressed, draping each other in their tartans and pinning the material in place. Cas’s shirt is deemed a lost cause, though by the way Dean touches him, he suspects it has less to do with the garment and more with a desire to see him bare. Biting his lip, Cas carefully tucks his parents’ handfasting cloth under Dean’s shirt, draping it around his neck. He grins when Dean tucks his own into the folds of Cas’s sash.
that Dean is the most relaxed friggin’ guy on the planet by the time the dude’s slipping on a rubber and pushing in. He’s slow; reaching down to jerk Dean’s dick, to press kisses up his spine—to whisper
His stomach growls. God, he’s hungry. Where’s that snack robot when you need it?
Dean grins and kisses him again.
Cas snorts. “Very subtle.”
They hold each for way longer than is probably considered appropriate, but Dean pulls back as if none of that ever happened so. Whatever. “You, uh, you hungry?” he asks, wiping at his damp cheeks. “How long are you staying?”
Castiel is not a morning person.
“No, he did.”
“Yes.”
and he’s gritting his teeth, pulling away from Dean’s grip and pushing at his shoulder to
“Why not?”
“Yeah?”
“And you want to?”
Midnight.
The thing nestled among Sam’s errant flaxseed flakes looks ridiculously similar to the one currently clutched between Dean’s fingers: it’s a similarly thick band, also crudely hammered, but where Dean bought a ring with a line of gold shot through the middle of the band, the one at the bottom of the box is mostly gold with what looks like patches of other metals worked into it. It’s not oxidized like Cas’s is, so it’s not as blue, but it’s… it’s really nice. A little more traditional, which is—real sweet.
Cas’s brow furrows. “Are you... okay?”
“You’re not having fun,” he continues. “And this was silly, anyway. We should just—”
Dean either doesn’t seem to notice how obvious they’re being, or he doesn’t care. He acts as if Cas is the only one at the table; serving him, flirting with him. He touches Cas’s wrist as if he needs to be persuaded to spend the night and sways into his space for a thousand almost-kisses.
War waged on. Castiel found he was good at killing, when it was in defence of people he loved. Over time, he even began to see it as a mercy; that to take a life was to save his kin from eternal damnation as well as to protect the glory of the Father’s creation. Here, death and love were intertwined. Both righteous. Both absolute. Castiel’s knowledge of all things—the defence strategies of the parasaurolophus, the hunting behaviours of the sabre-toothed tiger—propelled him through the ranks until he became Anna’s right-hand. There was no doubt that, had the war continued, he would have had been named a leader in his own right.
“But the Russians? Adventure-racing was in their blood; family came from money, they moved to the Swiss Alps to train their team of mountaineer kids. We met ‘em on the course of our first Eco-Challenge and—I dunno, man, have you ever talked to them? Pompous dickbags, I’m tellin’ you.”
“Hey,” Dean says, moving to rest his ringed hand over Cas’s heart. “I’m sure, okay? I’ve done some serious thinking and, especially with how uncertain everything is, I like this better.” He narrows his eyes playfully. “I just hope you know that even though we aren’t technically married, I’m gonna refer to you as my husband to literally everyone:
Dean shoves Sam’s pint glass into his chest. The stuff sloshes over the sides and wets his shirt and jeans and shoes. Something in Dean quiets a little. “Shut up about the Mark, okay? I’m good. Happy new year.”
“Hey Dean, you okay?”
Cross-posted from
“When,” he presses, grinning. Reaches into Dean’s shirt and tugs, revealing the end of the handfasting cloth. Just to see it. To be so close to the castle and see Dean wearing it. “At breakfast?”
Gabriel walked over to the two boys, making his presence known by hitting the back of his brother’s head. Castiel instantly turned to face him, scowling as he rubbed where he’d been struck, “Why did you do that?”
“Uncle?” Nico interrupted Dean’s thoughts, tugging lightly on the base of his uncle’s shirt, “Are you okay?”
Sam and Rowena both chuckled as they left the motel room, quietly closing the door behind them.
“Well, I mean there’s Cas.”
That seemed to catch the younger boy’s attention, “We can grow bees?”
“Oh, sorry.”
Castiel waited for the truck to drive away, the horn going as it passed the police car. Donna patted him on the shoulder, nudging him towards the vehicle, “Looks like we have some paperwork to do now,” She smiled, walking over to the driver’s door and getting in. Taking one last look at the sight, Castiel finally noticed the full damage of the cars: the two that had been on fire were now hollow wrecks, the flipped car surrounded in broken glass.
It had been pleasant to get to know more people. Castiel hadn’t realised how close the separate first responder services were to each other, or maybe it was solely a friendship between the fire department and the police force. Either way, that was the opposite to what it had been like in New York. The stereotypical cliché of police versus firemen was clearly evident in the city, with neither force interacting with one another, even at the same sites. Gabriel had mocked it, making the comparison to the banter in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, only without the friendly banter and more of the silent treatment and minor threats if the other got in the way.
“Cas—”
And his love is steadfast.
Cas leans over and presses a kiss to his mouth. “Mm.”
Castiel stitched Dean’s soul back into a body of flesh and bone with all the love he possessed, himself. He’d wanted to be his equal. His kin. He’d wanted to understand how such a man came to be, living in the world as it was today. And so Castiel remade his heart and hands and wondered at how one person could possibly embody so much goodness and grace. So much beauty. For Dean Winchester was comely for a human and that was right, too; that the Righteous Man’s love shone through his skin to make him golden and great.
,” he repeats. “A… steel pitcher?”
“Dean? They’re coming in.”
“Who the hell told you that?” Dean says, smiling faintly. They first time they’d met, had been caked in mud and he’d still held himself like his shit didn’t smell. “Cas was goddamn unbearable.”
“I would marry you in a bog during a thunderstorm,” Cas teases. “But… this will do nicely, too. I’m sorry I’m late.”
Dean sighs and gets to his feet, shoving the bills in his back pocket. He makes his way towards the Gas n’ Sip and asks for the bathroom key. The door sticks as he shoulders his way in.
He spits and stares at himself in the mirror. Checks his watch.
And, well. Not like there’s time for something to come of that, anyway.
“Yeah, it’s better.” He’s kissing just above Cas’s groin now, at that place that makes him shivery and unstable. “When you’re into it, I can keep you here for hours. No refractory time. Hell, I can get you here in the friggin’ Batcave, because when I do this…” He moves to tease at Cas’s hair, brushes his mouth along stubble until he’s at his ear. “You’re fried.”
They’re almost at the door when Dean feels himself shoved up against it and kissed. He faintly hears the cheering of people ringing in the new year, and Sam grumbling beside him, but all he can see are the hot girl’s big, brown eyes and taste her sweet, tacky lipgloss. “Happy new year,” she says, like it doesn’t matter. Dean swallows thickly. Nods.
They don’t make it to the bedroom—laid out on a bed of flax cereal, Dean pulls Cas on top of him and pretends Sam’s rabbit food isn’t digging into his ass cheeks. They sixty-nine like they’re in high school, hot and hard and fast. Cas drools enough to get spit all over his fingers and then ventures down Dean’s balls to tease his hole, which is just—impossible to deal with when Dean’s trying to deepthroat him. He moans. “Cas. Cas, I’m—”
“Hi, uh. We’re a little late—ah. Winchester? The reservation’s under. Um. Winchester.”
“Question?” Cas asks faintly.
, Cas, you gotta know all of it’s yours—your privilege, your honour but
“Mm.” Cas winks and gets back to work.
. Try to follow us all the way to fuckin’ Ritz, motherfucker. Fuck those goddamn books.”
Dean’s never had a hookup stick around after getting sick, but Des helps him to the bathroom and doesn’t question the toothpaste he pulls from his jacket pocket. He’s quiet and nice, and he touches Dean’s back and shoulders and arm, but when Dean turns around and kisses him, he barely reciprocates.
Dean surges forward to press their mouths together, reaching over to pull Cas closer. He buries a hand in dark hair and uses the other to cup Cas’s stumbled jaw, pulling away to mutter
And suddenly, the entire thing seems incredibly stupid. Cas dragged them both from the warmth and comfort of their marriage bed on their
“And?”
Team NW hops out of their boat at 4:03am.
“Not tonight, sweetheart.”
“Hold on, now, nobody said anything about being unresponsive—”
“Ah—no, Cas, that’s not what I—”
Dean thumbs at the hair below his navel. Familiar. Claiming.
Dean smoothes down his flannel and bites his lip. Fuck. They lost the reservation. There’s no record of them. They're not wearing the right clothes and the card was flagged and they know and they’re gonna—
“And tonight?”
Dean turns and kisses him, and it’s weirdly sweet. When they pull away, Tanner laughs and nods towards the clock. It’s kinda fucked up, feeling him laugh and huff while the guy’s inside him, but Dean looks at the bedside table anyway.
The alarm on his phone barely has the opportunity to buzz before he’s turning it off, carefully sliding out from between the covers. It’s dim, and Cas allows himself a moment to run his hand through the mess of his hair and dig his toes into the soft carpet. A breeze is coming off the water.
“Oh yes, the honeymooners! Right this way, please.”
Dean abruptly pulls away. He sits up, straddling Cas’s waist with a dumbfounded expression on his face. Cas’s brow furrows. “Dean?”

The Lightbringer became jealous and in his hatred, offered Eve fruit of the Tree. Her own curiosity was too large to bear. This desire—for knowledge, for knowing—Castiel understood, though he kept his thoughts to himself. And as he fought for Michael, as he remained steadfast and absolute, he wondered at the ability of love to twist into something so volatile. Twisted.
“Castiel, you told us, at the beginning of this thing, that you invited everyone to come catch you,” the MC says, pausing for dramatic effect. Dean almost groans. Jo looks murderous. The smiles never waver from Benny, Sam and Cas’s faces. “…And though many tried, no one was able to meet that challenge. Congratulations, Team NW, you are the winners of the world’s toughest race.”
“Nothing,” Dean laughs, the thing caught somewhere between disbelief and joy. “Keep going.”
Dean isn’t sure how they managed to spend like two hours chatting at the bar, but
Dean had considered him, and then looked down at the placement of his hand, embarrassed.
“That would probably be best.”
“This is fucked up, even for you. The Mark—”
Dean becomes quieter the closer he gets — brows furrowed, eyes squeezed shut — his toes curl into the grass, entire body seizing as he spills into Cas’s mouth with a high, breathy noise. This time, Castiel does not swallow. This time, he spits Dean’s seed into his hand and reaches for his own prick.
“Lunch, then,” he says. “Or before.”
The TV is showing a closeup of the ball in Times Square, and Cas is watching raptly. He’s wearing a pj t-shirt and some sweats, and his feet are bare, and there’s something so goddamn compelling about him. Dean stares until Cas realizes he’s being looked at, blushing when he’s caught. Cas kisses him.
The angel hummed, his eyes still on the screen.
“Yes, I asked if we would be friends forever?”
Castiel huffed, leaving the room before Dean could continue complaining. The hunter turned his attention back to the stove, opening the foil slightly to check how much longer the popcorn would need to cook. Once satisfied that enough had popped, he poured the contents of the pan into a plastic bowl. He rummaged through the fridge, picking up two beer bottles between his fingers, and picked up the bowl in his free hand.
Dean shyly hide his face in the crook of his mother’s neck, tugging tighter on her dress.
Castiel glanced over at his colleague, concerned about the situation. This was his first call since moving to Lawrence, and by the sounds of it, would be a very difficult one, “What do we do when we get there, Donna?”
“I’m a wee bit occupied at the moment,” Rowena’s alluring voice rang. In the background, Sam could hear the grumbling of men behind the witch.
“I can handle John,” Dean growled, pushing the glass towards her and standing up, “I’ll pay when I get Charlie and Benny’s orders,” He turned on his heels, walking over to where his friends had perched themselves in the corner of the room. Benny instantly sensed the change in his demeanour, a flash of worry glinting in his eyes, “You good, cher?”
“Thank you Dean.”
“Nothing. It’s just I’m glad we got to do this.”
“Would you like anything else?” Mary offered, “Tea? Coffee? Any dessert?”
“Dean says it does,” Castiel replied.
“What would you like to talk about, Dean?”
“Is that it?” Sam asked, “Is – is it done?”
Hearing that, Dean jumped off the bed, “What curse? It sounds important!”
“Dean, you forgot your own name,” Sam replied, closing the door behind them and walked over to the window. Dean rolled his eyes at his brother, huffing in response. Peering out to check for any threats, Sam drew the curtains shut, brushing a hand over his face, “All right, look, we know we’re dealing with a witch, right? Maybe you got hexed.”
“You’ve drank enough for one night, Dad,” Dean replied, wandering into the kitchen and stopping as soon as he saw the mess. Every cupboard door was open, the plates smashed on the floor. There were only a few packets of food still on the shelves, the fridge door wide open revealing a six-pack of beer. Dean sighed, crouching down and began picking up the debris. It had been a few days since he had last seen John, but the place hadn’t been in this much of a state.
John spluttered out any of the remaining contents from his stomach, groaning as he swiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
The tallest of them sheepishly raised his hand, using his other hand to rub the back of his head, “I hadn’t meant to crash into them, officers. We had to do an emergency stop and-”
Once done clearing the mess, Dean poured a glass of water, carrying it into the living room for his father. John was now sprawled on the armchair, his head resting on his shoulder in an uncomfortable position. The TV remote had fallen out of his hands, now on his lap. Dean put the glass on the small table beside his father’s chair, picking up the remote and switching the television off. He picked up the blanket that had been on the back of the couch and spread it across his father’s passed out form, patting his other shoulder before walking back towards the front door.
“How else are you meant to eat it?” He retaliated, his eyes squinting in that cute way that he had been doing when they first met.
Benny glanced down at his watch, his eyes widening when he saw the time, “I gotta head home now – I promised Andrea I would be back earlier than last time.”
John huffed, staring out of the side window at the passing buildings. Dean sighed, switching on the car radio and lowering the volume. ‘Hey Jude’ filled the tense air, its soft tune humming through the car. His father angrily reached across, hitting his palm against the radio and abruptly cutting the song, “I don’t want to listen to any fucking music.”
“Awesome!” Dean shouted, jumping up and down, “I can’t wait to show you everything!”
“That’s very kind of you, sweetie.”
Dean paused, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes. John Winchester, known as the neighbourhood drunkard and the man who could never retain a job. It was needless to say that neither brother was proud of their father, especially growing up. Sam in particular had despised his father’s nature, hating the way that he treated his sons and neglected them for weeks on-end and returning like nothing had happened. It was to be expected that as soon as Sam was of age, he would lose contact with John, leaving the old man to the charge of Dean, who despite how John was, always looked out for him.
“No, sorry.”
Castiel paused, unsure of what to say. If he was talking to the normal Dean, he would have immediately responded with a “yes”. But something in the back of his mind was bothering him. The normal Dean seemed to only want a friendship with him, but Cas had always wanted something more from their relationship. From the moment he had seen Dean’s pure soul in the deepest pit of Hell, Cas knew his relationship with the older Winchester would be different to any other he would develop with humanity.
“Oh,” Dean looked down as he walked, his brows furrowing, “I will do everything I can to make him happy.”
“So we’re both right?” Castiel asked, letting go of Dean’s arm and crossing his own over his chest in annoyance.
Sam couldn’t help but notice the slight blushing of his brother’s cheeks as he replied. Dean managed to tug his arm out of his jacket, tossing the coat onto the floor and kicking it away. Whilst kid films certainly weren’t his go-to thing, something about Dory had drawn the character close to Dean’s heart. Perhaps it was her resemblance to a certain angel, her deep blue colour reminding the older hunter of someone’s eyes, or her attitude being similar to that of a lost baby-in-a-trenchcoat. Not that Dean would ever admit to this reasoning behind his love for the character.
Castiel paused, uncertain as to why he did, “Can I not catch up with my older brother?”
Dean nodded, returning back to his distraction. Benny wandered over to the empty canisters, rearranging them to be replaced when the next supply run was, “Whatever it is, cher, you’re always going to forgive that boy. You’re pretty much all you two have.”
“Of course not!” Mary said, raising her hand up, “It’s not trouble at all. Just let us know when you’ll be coming round and we can sort food out.”
Dean nodded, “He’s very lucky to have you. I hope to have that one day too.”
Castiel chuckled at the remark, “Yes, Dean. You told me that.”
“I think it would be best if we get going,” Chuck replied, “We have to get up early to sort out some documents down at the town hall.”
“Cas? We got the book,” Sam’s tired voice called from the other end, “Bring Dean to the Loughlin house.”
Four years came and went, four years of the world continuing whilst Dean struggled to hold on. Sam and Eileen now had a son who was already turning into a miniature version of his uncle. Jack occasionally visited the brothers, updating the two on the peace within the supernatural realm and his success in being God. And Dean…
Before Dean could finish his sentence, a finger was pressed against his lips. Cas was now fully looking at him, leaning over so that his chest was up against Dean’s, “You’re interrupting the movie,” the angel whispered, returning back to his initial position, but keeping his hand holding the hunter’s. Dean huffed, shuffling on the couch to get himself comfortable again so that he could focus on the movie.
“Don’t take it personally, angel,” Rowena whispered, her heels clicking against the shiny marble floor in the foyer, “Those brothers have a special bond.”
“There’s someone I like.”
“Of course! You read my card, didn’t you?”
“Awesome.”
“You remember that? Classic,” Dean joked, taking a step and pulling his brother into a hug.
“Everyone hangs out at The Roadhouse at some point, Dean. He must go there with the other officers, especially if he’s close with Donna.”
“It’s okay, Dean,” Castiel interrupted, putting his other hand on Dean’s closest thigh.
“Were those nice?” Mary chuckled, picking up a paper towel and wiping at her son’s mouth. Dean nodded, handing the plate over to his mother and raising his hands in the air, signaling to be picked up. Once the plate had been put by the sink, Mary crouched down as she lifted the four-year-old and balanced him on her hip, “Shall we go say hello to the new neighbours?” She asked, her smile broadening as Dean coiled his little hand around her finger. The boy nodded eagerly, shifting excitedly in his mother’s grip.
Dean sighed, glancing up at his mother, “Can I watch TV?”
“Dean, this is Sam, remember?” Cas reassured, noticing how Sam had stumbled back in shock. It was clear that the younger Winchester hadn’t expected Dean’s state to be this bad.
Castiel was growing impatient of waiting, tapping his foot on the sidewalk to try and get his parents’ attention. Dean looked around, confused as to where Gabriel had gone. He thought he had seen the older boy go into the house with a packet of candy, but he hadn’t reappeared yet.
“You have other friends too, sweetie. Remember Charlie and Jo? They’re your friends too, aren’t they?”
The raven-haired boy nodded, not looking at him.
Nico shook his head.
Castiel clambered out of the passenger seat, unsure of what he was supposed to do. His ears were deafened by the blood-curdling screams coming from the crash-site, alerting him that someone was trapped in a vehicle. He raced over, ignoring the frantic yells from Donna behind him. He stopped by the flipped car, crouching down to peer into it. The side door had been ripped open, blood smeared along the seats as though the casualty had been dragged out. Realising that the trapped person wasn’t in there, Castiel turned to the flames, faintly seeing the flailing shadows of desperate arms in one of the cars.
“Since you called, how has your week been so far?” Gabriel asked, “Meet any potential partners?”
“Nice wheels,” Dean commented, shocking Cas. He had never received a compliment for the car – Sam had called it the ‘Pimpmobile’, “Thank you Dean.”
This justification hadn’t stopped the older Winchester, who was continuing his search to find a way to bring back his angel. Days would turn to weeks of research, weeks of deadends would turn to months of hopeless searching. But Dean wouldn’t stop looking. Not when he knew that his angel was still in that place.
The older man nodded, stumbling towards the passenger door and swinging it open as he tumbled into the seat. Dean waited until he heard the brutal slam of the door, patting the roof of the car as an apologetic gesture before sitting in the driver’s seat. He carefully drove the car around the pile of spew, also taking it slowly in case John needed to jump out and be sick outside again.
The parents followed behind, Mary placing Sam in his baby seat and handing him a bottle of warm milk to gulp down. Castiel and Dean sat in the seats on one side of the baby, Naomi and Chuck sitting on the other side. Mary walked back into the kitchen, bringing out a large oven dish full of roasted meat and potatoes, before going back out to retrieve the bowl of peas. As she served everyone a decent portion of food, Castiel kept a hold of the card, occasionally glancing down at it. Dean seemed to notice, smiling over how much his friend liked the present.
“My name is…”
“Hey! You were the one who held my hand first!”
Gabriel hopped over to the adults, prodding Dean’s leg, “You’re small.”
The man laughed deeply, surprising Dean with how low the noise was, “Castiel spoke of his bee obsession then?”
“By being nice to our new neighbours, like Deano here,” Gabriel replied, putting his hand on Dean’s shoulder and giving it a soft squeeze. Dean was too busy watching Castiel to bother getting out of the older boy’s grip. Castiel dropped the stick, reaching his hand forward, “I’m Castiel.”
Castiel sat in front of his desk in the central area of the station, cradling a cup of coffee like a lifeline. The early mornings and late evenings certainly hadn’t done him any favours, leaving him in a zombie-like state until around midday. He took a sip of the warm brew, sighing contently and clicked at his computer. Jody had assigned the man to read over Garth’s report on the latest petty theft, seeing as Castiel had far more experience than the younger recruit. Continuing his coffee, he read over the document, the friendly rumble of office conversation filling the room.
“How dare you, Castiel Novak!”
“I guess we’re going witch-hunting.”
“Oh. Sorry,” Dean blurted, feeling flustered. Castiel smiled at the hunter, “It’s okay. It’s nice to hear.”
“He’s funny, Momma,” Gabriel remarked, pulling a piece of wrapped candy from his pocket and offering it to Dean, “Here.”
“Don’t go turning this back on me, and don’t you trying to win me over by addressing me as queen.”
“It isn’t in your control, Dean. There’s no need to apologise.”
Dean pulled a face of disgust, scrunching his nose up and shaking his head, “I hate vegetables!”
Dean sniffled, wiping his hand over his nose, “Cas didn’t want to go to my bedroom.”
“Whoa. Never seen a dead guy before,” Dean huffed, walking over to his bed and perching on the edge of it, a mimic of what he had done the previous day. Sam gave a double glance over at his brother, rolling his eyes, “Trust me, you have.”
It did, eventually. When Dean was on Death’s friggin doorstep, sandwiched between two teammates who weren’t far behind. Team Novak managed to overtake them on a gravel road at 6 a.m. and about a mile from the checkpoint. Dean barely remembers seeing them; Sam was the one who filled him in. Told him that Cas made it about 100 feet and then turned around and came running back. That his team didn’t notice he was gone until they reached the warming tent. That they yelled at him in English and Russian and Cas just stood there with a blanket and a hot chocolate and stared at Dean, through the chest pains and the cramps and the cardiac arrest, until the helicopter came.
“Where should we —”
Whether or not they’re supposed to kiss at this juncture seems irrelevant; their mouths press in a kind of affection that is almost painful in its sweetness. Fingers curl more tightly around each other’s wrists, and when they pull apart, Cas is too much for his body, the grin on his face so big it’ll split it in two.
He pants into his bicep, arm covering his eyes as if the fact that he can’t see his partner makes him invisible. Despite the fact that this is just how he is, it never seems to get any easier. Especially on nights like tonight, where he’d been so excited by the prospect of—of being normal.
Dean’s smile is small and teasing. “…Yeah?”
Dean stares.
Dean hums thoughtfully. He moves so they’re sitting back to chest, his chin resting on Cas’s shoulder and hand moving to rest over his chest. “I don’t think you ruined it,” he says quietly.
Dean stares down the entrance posts of Camp 4, unblinking as the moon crawls higher and higher in the sky. He thinks he’s been in the same spot for hours, but it’s hard to tell with panic squeezing at his windpipe. They should be back by now. Shouldn’t they be back by now? God, running support was a mistake. Everything single fucking part of coming back here was a
“Your life is one hardship after another,” he agrees solemnly. Cas slides back down Dean’s body and nips his left asscheck. “Come on. Up.”
His name doesn’t matter, but he has blue eyes.
Finishing off his fruit, Castiel checks the time and begins to make his way back towards the ship, eyes lowered. He has no intention of claiming the throne of this place, and no interest in finding out if his mere presence would still be considered an act of war. Normally, he’d stay in the ship, but… after eighteen years, it’s nice to be truly back, if only for a little while. Eden was not home, but it meant a great deal to him for much of his life.
