He looks down at his hands and I just want to comfort him. Castiel had talked to me about what Dean's home life was like and I can't believe I didn't pick up on it. But the best thing I could do now was support all the kids, both my own and the Winchester brothers.
"Oh, your the Dean that Cas is always talking about." He laughs "Our address is 187 Hetfield drive, thank you for driving him home."
We walk into class and I try not to think about the beautiful blue eye boy behind me. I shake my head at the thought. Come on dean he's probably doesn't swing your way anyway, just try out for football and then go home. I stop my inner monologue and try to concentrate on class. Which was going to be difficult with Cas behind me. Dammit!
"Dean's getting changed, they're letting him come home today. They have to conduct a whole bunch of interviews but your dad managed to let them all happen at home." I smile at him and he leads me back into the room.
"Instead I see my own son, kissing another boy over the protection of his brother. I couldn't give a damn who you kiss as long as it doesn't interfere with Sam!" He rears his arm back and slaps me across the face, snapping my head sideways and causing me to clench my jaw.
"I know I haven't been the best father, drunk most of the time or gone. I don't remember much of my time with you at all, but I am sorry, drinking was the only way to blur her face...but I should have been there, Dean. I should've saved the day rather than deal with Azazel, but that doesn't matter now, he went back on his deal."
"I have so many jobs because I need to pay the rent, buy food and pay for our education. The jobs are the reason I'm tired." He trails off and looks at the time, grabbing the car door handle he opens it and stumbles out of the car, almost face planting. I scramble out of the car and put a steadying hand on his shoulder, my eyes widening in worry at how pale Dean really was.
I briefly look up and see Cas slowly walking over to me, his face pale and his hands clenched tightly. I feel another crack from my face and squeeze my eyes shut in pain. The kicks stop and a hand grips my hair, pulling my bloodied face from the ground. I feel hot breath on my neck and Alistair's voice weaves its way through the air.
"Quit whining Dean, it's only for a minute." I huff and reluctantly let him lead me into the forest, my hands shaking and my stomach doing flips on itself. We walk for about two minutes before he pulls me to a stop, letting the blindfold fall.
When we get there I pull into the car park and tell both the brothers to follow me. I lead to the willow Dean and I sat under yesterday and explain on the way.
I woke up on the couch with an old blanket covering me and a new shirt on. I sit up and wince at the ache in my rib, I remembered the events that had unfolded last night. I shivered at the cold that usually accompanied me and wished for another hug that meant something.
Cas grins at me from across the table and I feel a foot rub against my calf, I narrow my eyes at him and he pushes against my toes. I smile and push back, it starts off a silent war underneath the table with Cas and I trying very hard not to laugh out loud.
"Sup guys, I'm Charlie. We have almost every class together, isn't that just squeal-worthy? BT dubs you guys are soo OTP, I mean, ugh. Anyways, I was wondering if you two wanted to hang out with the group at lunch, I mean we would've asked earlier but, jocks being assholes." All this was said very quickly and I just nod, not knowing what to say. She squeals delightedly and starts skipping to our next class.
Then a light touch on my shoulder, an arm around my waist and my feelings calm. A kiss on the cheek and I'm able to think clearly yet be completely befuddled at the same time.
"Sorry Charles but I gotta agree with Cas. Steve Rodgers is pretty good." Charlie sighs and crosses her arms.
"Well, sometimes he comes home sober and is the best father you could wish for, he's interested in our lives and he shows affection. We talk until midnight and play games like a normal family, he doesn't remember the bad stuff he's done. But this dream, this version of my father that I love? Is only about thirty percent of the time." I close my eyes and adjust my position a bit more, which causes Cas to cease stroking my hair and move on to tracing the lines of my face.
"Thank you, Cas. I really mean it, I have no idea what I'd do without you." I smile and kiss his shoulder. He needed me and I needed him, I was grateful for our therapist because she helped Dean.
The words get worse as the day goes on and by the time lunch comes around I'm desperate for Dean, desperate to get away from these jerks. The bell clangs across the school and I bolt before another word can escape the jocks mouths, I throw my books in my locker and hurriedly pull my unusually large lunch out of my bag. I slam my locker shut and sprint for the willow, trying to frantically swallow my tears.
"There's this girl in his class, Jessica Moore, and he is absolutely smitten. He talks about her all hours of the day and tells me -in excruciating detail- everything they talked about and everything she does. What do I do? I'm used to flirting with people but I don't know what to do if you actually
I drive towards the woods and park just outside them, climbing out of the Impala with Cas. Cas walks over and puts a blindfold on my eyes, effectively shutting out the pale light from the setting sun.
I slowly walk forwards and hand him the glass of water, he smiles at me and reaches out with a shaking hand. He takes a small sip and I hand him the towel,  furrowing my brow in concern. What did he dream this time?
"Yeah, it's me Dean." He opens his eyes and scootches across the bed, lifting up his blanket. I smile warmly and climb in next to him,  shivering when my skin comes in contact with his hospital clothing. I wrap an arm around him and he puts his head on my chest, still curled in a ball. He grips my clothes tightly and breathes deeply, causing me to wince in pain.
"You know the best part about hurting you two? I hurt one of you, and it hurts the other one as well! That little beating that just happened, that hurt Dean as well." She laughs hysterically again before pointing a finger in my face.
"It's awful Castiel, those demons possessing kids? Just wrong." Their voices overlap each other and I interrupt them quietly, my throat hoarse.
"Boys, we are coming in now. Don't resist." The demons cackle and Azazel removes my gag, I rub my tongue along my split lip, almost screaming when it tastes blood still trickling out of it. I was obviously only unconscious for a few minutes. Azazel smirks and slams his fist into my stomach causing me to scream as my broken ribs take the impact.
"I can't believe your late, Winchester. Now drive me to the woods, ten minutes east." I roll my eyes and mutter under my breath about impatient boyfriends, causing Cas to grin again.
I was last. I inhale through my nose and bend my knees slightly, leaning forwards preparing to catch Crowley. The boy stood in front of me and grinned, lunged towards me and braced my back and grabbed him by the shoulders. His elbow collided with my ribs and I almost cried out in pain, but I bit down on my tongue and instead swung Crowley downwards. I looked up slowly and saw Cas grinning at me, his eyes crinkling at the corners. I smile slightly, blushing a little, and offer my hand to Crowley to help him up. He smirks and grips my hand, allowing me to pull him to his feet.
"Stop touching him you bitch!" I scream at her and the yelling outside stops briefly, but the banging against the door continues. I mentally urge them to break the door down faster and Abbadon laughs. I look at Dean again and notice him sitting stiffly, Abbadons arm moves and Dean winces slightly, I frown.
Thoughts weaselled their way into my head, poisoning my mind and preventing me from believing that Cas could care that much. That I could have a best friend, that I could have someone that cried for me. Another sob escapes my throat and Chuck casually walks back in, freezing when he sees my tears.
"Is this what it's gonna be like until they find someone else?" I whisper to Dean and he nods. I purse my lips and look skywards, trying to prevent the tears that I knew would come eventually. I feel Dean's hands on the sides of my face and I tilt my head back down to be swept away by his forest green eyes. He leans in and kisses me softly, wrapping an arm around my waist and one through my hair.
"I forgive you. I know you're tearing yourself up over the fact you didn't stop them, but Cas, you would have gotten your ass kicked as well, then we'd be in real trouble. Thank you for staying with Sammy." I open my eyes to his sincere face, so different from the usual grin that was plastered there.
"God, I'm giving out so many hugs today, no more chick-flick moments." I make my way over to him and lean in slightly, about two inches away from kissing him.
"Yeah, Dean. Besides, I like Cas a lot, he's good for you." Sam laughs as Dean's ears turn red and then slides into the backseat, his eyes gleaming mischievously. I climb into the Impala and Dean grins at me from the driver's seat, as soon as we pull out of the school car park, he grabs my hand and holds it, our fingers intertwining together. I can't help but think they fit perfectly together. I hear a small squeak from behind us and look at Sam, who's grinning like a maniac.
"Go to your room Sammy, I'll tuck you in later." He nods quickly and scurries to his bedroom, his small legs stumbling in their haste. John pushes my head away quickly and it hits the wall with a dull thud that sends stars dancing across my brain. I slide to the floor as my legs buckle but he catches me before I hit the ground. He pulls his arm back and punches me over and over.
I decide to wait in the car for him and instead turn on my music, the song going to one of Deans favorites, Highway to Hell. It suited him, especially with all the unknown fights he seemed to get in. Every few weeks he would come to school with some other injury from a fight, I just supposed his cocky attitude was that irritating to everyone. I smile to myself and open a book on my phone, beginning to read.
"Well, we have all night, so were gonna wait till Cassie wakes up. Then it's your turn, Dean." I swallow nervously and watch my boyfriend worriedly, waiting with baited breath every time he breathes out.
I finish my long-overdue explanation and look up at Sammy guiltily. He was openly crying. My heart aches and I gently wipe the tears away, quieting his sobs. I bottle up my emotions and only let the worry for my brother's safety through.
"Have you seen the new movie? It's amazing, you two should come see it with us! I actually think you know someone in our group, Dean? You work with her, Jo Harvelle? Yeah, she says you work pretty hard and earn some sweet tips. Talking about tips, have you heard...."
"Already working on it." I wink at him and move to stand next to Cas, who was staring at me weirdly. I try to block out his look and focus on my breathing. Crap. My chest tightens and I try to control my breathing to stop the brief panic attack before it happens. Memories flash through my mind and I try my best to bottle it up and save it for when I'm alone.
Dean nods shakily and they release his wrists gasping when he reveals them to be red raw and bleeding, I want to worry about him but I'm too tired now. The medics approach with a blanket and wrap it around his shoulders, the help him up but his legs collapse and he closes his eyes.
Cas grins at me from across the table and I feel a foot rub against my calf, I narrow my eyes at him and he pushes against my toes. I smile and push back, it starts off a silent war underneath the table with Cas and I trying very hard not to laugh out loud.
"Thank you, Castiel. I really appreciate it." He pulls back and I notice the small crease in between his eyebrows that made him appear older. I nod awkwardly at him and glance over his shoulder to the boy behind him, almost not recognising him without the confident demeanour he usually wore.
"Oh thank god! The tension between you two was crazy, oh Gabriel owes me twenty dollars." Then his words sink in and my ears tinge pink.
I swallowed and closed my eyes again, hoping that if I couldn't see everyone it would be easier to talk about. I felt dirty, like a had just rolled through mud and then landed in dirt. But I could only feel fear, nothing else, that's why I needed Cas here, he grounded me.
"Sore, really, really sore. But emotionally I'm okay right now. I know those demons have been taken care of, and I know we'll get better." I smile at him, happy for some reason. I was completely honest, I felt emotionally stable and everything was looking up, the bullies were gone and Dean and I could come out to the school.
The next week we walk into class and sit in our usual seats,  but this time the captain of the cheerleading team, Abbadon Knightly, sat directly next to Dean. Dean smiles lazily at me and completely ignores her, instead choosing to work the questions out with me. I smile back and raise an eyebrow, to which he just replies back with a shrug. His wounds had healed almost completely but he was still sore and sensitive whenever someone touched them.
Turns out I was wrong, both figuratively and literally. His quiet sobs shook my bruised body and I winced at the movement but didn't pull back. I feel the familiar tug on my heartstrings from whenever I looked at him, I just wished that I could hug him like this and it would mean more.
"Hey, reject, how are those Daddy issues going? Crowley here says he has a good hit on him." Azazel's slimy voice filled the air accompanied by a metal ruler to the back of Dean's head. Dean flinched and bit his lip, continuing to stare at the board. I took a deep breath and prepared to talk to Dean quietly when Alistair began talking to me.
"Yep, and now you need to answer your question." My heart flutters at his answer and I force myself not to smile.
Dean wriggles to try and get away but Azazel just clicks his tongue and squeezes harder, which causes Dean to bite his lip and glanced towards the sky. I start walking towards them when a meaty hand grips my shoulder and spins me around so I'm face to face with the sneering Alistair.
"Of course, Sammy. Now get some sleep, we still have school tomorrow and I can take care of myself." He smiles and heads off to bed. I gently place the ice pack against my torso and let out a sigh of relief at the cool release it brings. I lay back on my bed and let my emotions out, remembering the rest of the memory.
I hear a crack and watch as Deans face screws up in pain and he screams. Everyone else starts to back away, looking terrified of the football team, the people I thought were our friends. Deans scream was one of heart-wrenching pain and I have to lock Sam in the car to stop him from racing to Dean.
"Oh, Cas. We need a medic ASAP! What hurts, why were you screaming? Was it these kids?" He frantically asks and I nod, watching his face contort in anger and he talks to the police standing at the door. I watch the medics run in and I whimper when they move me to put me on a stretcher.
I smile the biggest smile and skip back down to my chair, pointing Dean into the one next to me. My dad sits down again and Sam leans forwards to shake his hand firmly and offers his gratitude. I see my dad's face light up and the mood at the breakfast table is one of peace and happiness, but I still couldn't look at Dean's face. I couldn't bring myself to see the damage.
The wiry boy in front of me smiles and replies "Castiel Novak" I'm throw off by his voice, which is, woah. Like super deep.
"When was the last time you ate?" He swallows and mumbles something under his breath, avoiding my eyes.
He wanted to be a doctor and save lives, he has a cat called Bee, his father is a bestselling author, he has three siblings: Anna, Gabriel, and Lucifer but his cousins all live close by as well. He was the defense for football and loved to draw.
It was worth all the sneaking and staying up late, just to see the look on his face. I exhale shakily and fiddle with my clothes.
Dean clutches his ribs and hauls himself up, offering a hand to me. I take it and notice just how freezing his fingers actually are, he pulls me up and we head to class.
I move into the lounge room and scrub the floor from last night, I also wipe the surfaces down and walk over to my room. As I pick up all the stuff on my floor I start singing loudly, dancing to myself as I tidy up my desk, I dance over to my wardrobe and begin sorting my clothes, making sure everything is perfect.
I climb back into the car and think about how distressed his family was. I begin to drive home and realize that they thought his anxiety came back and he went to get drunk or high. I worry about Cas the whole way home and don't think about anything else until I've locked the front door and walk into the lounge room where I freeze.
"Whatcha gonna do, kid? Nothing, that's right, nothin'. You're a freak ass nerd who's clothes don't even fit. No one cares if we beat you up."  Azazel sneers and throws Sammy to the floor at my feet. I see a black eye and a bloody nose and the tears threatening to spill over his lashes. I reach down and pull him up, letting him lean on me for support. I give him the once over and deem him able to walk.
"I'm working on an apprenticeship for NASA if that makes anyone feel better." Ash says from the floor.
Sammy sits back and shoots me a grin, pride clear on his face. He leaves the room and I turn to Cas, smiling at the twinkle in his blue eyes. I stare at him for a minute before he grumbles and kisses me, making my body feel electrified, even after the past six months together I still felt this way when kissing him.
"Never, bitch. Leave us alone." He snarls at her, which causes her to just laugh lightly and wink at him. He spins around and leans closer to me, looking straight down at the questions. I take the hint and begin answering them while we have a whispered conversation.
"Get better, and eat at my house at least once a week." Dean's mouth drops open along with Sam's and I grin. My dad was a genius! It's the perfect way to feed them, make sure their okay and to know when their father is home. Dean inhales and rubs the back of his neck.
I walk into class shyly and duck my head at the attention. I feel Dean walk in behind me and I turn slightly, allowing him to walk ahead and talk to the teacher for us. I still didn't like talking to new people that much, I'd only ever been to one other school and only ever hung out with that friend group.
We gratefully stumble out of the class and Dean laughs a shocked expression on his face. Charlene skips up to us, her Star Trek t-shirt flashing in the light.
He stiffens and moves back slightly but I pull him closer, hugging tightly until he melts into my warmth. I look down and he closes his eyes again, his bottom lip trembling slightly, I move my fingers to brush against his hair but he flinches when they come in contact with his face. I pull my fingers back and sigh.
The room froze for a second before erupting into madness, people were yelling but all I heard was the rustle of sheets as Cas wrapped me into a hug and the words of comfort he whispered into my ear as my emotions drained out of me, replaced by nothingness.
I wake up to the sunlight filtering through my window and shining into my eyes. I groan and roll out of bed, landing on the floor in a heap. I rub my eyes and stand up, yawning. I glance at the bed and notice that Dean isn't in it, this was normal as he still had the habit of waking up early to make Sam's meals for the day.
He looked smaller with his shoulders hunched and a shy smile on his face rather than his usual grin. He shuffles over to me and rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, his eyes look into mine and I find myself losing myself in their flawless mix of greens and hazels. Sam clears his throat and we both glance down, blushing furiously. The things this ridiculous boy made me feel were unsettling and exciting.
"I'm Ash, genius and captain cool." He grins at us and I smile back shyly, surprised when Dean speaks up.
"We walked into the living room and dad was there, with two more presents and a huge stack of waffles and mugs of hot chocolate. That day we just spent with each other, playing with the new toys we got and spending time as a family. Sammy was so happy, it's the best memory of my dad."
I barely notice Cas' terrified face or frantic voice warning me not to get involved. All I can see is Alistair and Azazel holding the front of my brother's jacket and throwing punches, Sammy trying to fight back but he's only kid. I storm up to the large group of people gathered and the second they see my face they scramble out of my way. I watch as Cas stands next to the rest of the football team and I feel a pang of jealousy in my chest.
He stares open-mouthed at me and I begin laughing again, this seems to cause a chain reaction and soon everyone is in hysterics. He frowns at me and slowly wipes the dripping taco juice off his face, he then gets up very quietly and I start to back away. Lucifer ooh's dramatically and I see Gabriel cover his mouth with a hand to stop the laughter threatening to spill over his lips.
"Calm down, Dean. You'll have your turn next. Just something...different." She winks and my heart sinks as Cas screams into the gag again. I sag down into the arms to the people holding me up and Alistair and Azazel briefly pause kicking Cas for a minute. I stare at his twitching figure and scream again when he try to curl into a ball.
"It's okay, it's gone. It's over, Dean, alright? I'm here, just breathe." I look into his eyes and try to lose myself in them, wanting to spend forever with him and just forget everything.
I start in the kitchen, scrubbing all the dishes and all the surfaces, humming songs from Metallica's albums. By the time the kitchen is sparkling clean I'm singing quietly along to the songs.
I start shaking and dry heave again, feeling repulsed and dirty. I hear a shuffle from the door and Cas walks in, rubbing his eyes. He yawns and looks at me sleepily and when he sees me clutching to the toilet and crying he rushes over.
I swing my chair around and lean over him to point at his notes. I notice him stiffen and I glance up at his red face, this was going to be so much fun.
"I'll go first, okay? I have severe anxiety and certain things set it off, like large crowds, people purposely mentioning it and someone yelling at me loudly. At my old school, it got so bad that one night I went to a party and got completely blind." He shudders slightly and I reach up to gently touch his face. He smiles down at me and continues.
"I guess you want the full story then?" I nod once. "Alright, here it goes. You have to promise not to tell anyone, okay? Not a soul." He stares intensely into my eyes and I nod slightly, a little scared for what he was going to tell me.
"Because I didn't know how. My whole life I've locked every emotion away and now I don't know how to let people in. And I'm scared, Bobby, scared that everyone will leave me." I shrug lightly, pretending it's no big deal that no one knows.
"Dean!" She says with a grin "How've ya been? Can you pop on your uniform and get bustling, tonight's a busy one." I smile falsely and start work waiting tables.
"Come out, Dean. You don't have to be ashamed of your scars, I have my own and you can trust me," I see the door openly slowly and Dean shuffles out, looking steadily at the floor.
The principal shows us around a bit more before turning back to us and smiling. I concentrate and see her soul is fiery, a little intimidating to be honest but I notice the kindness in her eyes.
I felt the bed dip and suddenly Sam was comfotring me as well, I felt pressure build in my chest and suddenly I was sobbing into Cas and Sams arms. The memories threatened to overwhelm me so rather than fight, I let the blackness consume my mind.
He looks back up at me through his eyelashes and laughs. That's it. If he isn't gonna the first move then I will.
I dream of Dean, his candy apple eyes, the scattered freckles across his face, his wide smile and his bright soul.
"M-my whole b-body hurts Cas! H-how do I-I make it s-stop!" I hug him tighter and tell him to stay put while I sort it out. I wander out of the room and pull my phone out of my pocket. While I call my dad I observe their motel.
I grin and almost launch myself at him, hugging my arms and legs around him like a blanket, he laughs lightly and my heart flutters at the sound. He lays back with me still hugging him and I end up sprawling on his chest, one hand caressing his face, the other on his hip. He chuckles and Sam and my dad set up at the foot of the bed.
We laugh our way inside and sit down in a private little booth at the back. A young girl walks up and we order our milkshakes. Blue Heaven for me and Death by Chocolate for Dean.
I recognized posters from Doctor Who, Sherlock, Lord of the Rings, The Walking Dead and about ten other movies. I smile at the idea of his youth still being intact and knock gently on the tenth doctors face. I hear Sammy's weak greeting and I push open his door slowly. He looks up and I see his face light up when he sees me. My heart swells with pride and happiness and I can't help but grin back. He scrambles up and launches himself at me, mumbling into my shoulder.
"So I guess we're going to class together?" He nods and shoves his hands into his leather jacket pocket. He walks ahead a little and I notice his slight limp and tight breathing, he's probably been in a fight. I shrug and rush forwards to catch up to him, noticing how his eyes sparkled when he grinned.
"What did they do to you, Dean?" He stiffens at the question and then turns his head to bury his nose into the crook of his neck. I feel water drip down my back and I realize he's crying quietly. I look towards Sam and he just bites his lip.
Sam nods and makes his way over to Dean, he reaches out and does Dean's buttons. He rests his hand on Dean's shoulder and pulls him down for a hug, smiling when Dean hugs back tightly.
I'm frozen still, overwhelmed by the beauty and care placed into the scene before me. Dean smiles again and gently pulls me onto the mattress where we sit close together.
Dad is standing over Sammy with a beer bottle in his hand and Sammy is trying to keep his head up through the tears streaming down his face. Dad takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, rubbing his face.
"You can hardly see the bruise, Dean! That's great! But why are you so sad?" I sigh and smile at him. Trying to mask the pain I was in.
I drop the glass into the sink and sprint to the bathroom, falling to the floor and reaching for the toilet as I gag. I grab the bowl and empty my stomach into it as sweat starts to bead on my forehead.
I drop the papers and grip the bench, sobbing quietly through clenched teeth, my emotions burning in my chest. A mix of everything, colliding and falling and tearing themselves in my chest, causing an emotional war.
Cas smiles at me and I grin back. We walk through the door and shake hands with the lady at the front desk.
"Alright Clarence, everything seems to be in order. You have three broken ribs, a twisted ankle and a minor concussion, take some pain meds, grab some some crutches, and you'll be good to go." She smiles kindly at me, her brown hair falling in front of her face. Her phone beeps and she pulls a message out, frowning at something on the screen.
He smiles shyly and shuffles his foot on the floor, I can tell he's nervous. I know how he feels, I'm feeling it as well. I take a breath and try to look at the other boy, avoiding his glowing soul and looking at his face.
"Great, I really like it here, you?" He shrugs and the teacher walks in. I frown at Deans attitude, he's not good at talking about himself, but that makes me even more determined to get to know him. I've only ever felt this way with a girl at my old school, April, and that did not end well at all.
"You're never home, Dad! Why can't you just let mum go and actually look after your kids for once! I just want you to stay home!" I rush through the front door at the sound of Sammy's distressed voice, still high pitched from youth. I yank open the door and drop my bag on the floor, practically sliding around the corner into the kitchen.
"I had another nightmare last night and I freaked so much that I was sick." I softly say, he just nods, silent permission to continue talking.
I slide under the car and begin working, falling into the calm zone where the shouting from the other workers disappears. Where it becomes just me and the car, it takes my mind off my nightmare. I work on her brakes until they're perfect and then slide out, wiping the sweat from my brow with my hand and smearing grease across my face.
We eat the dinner I'd made while talking softly and listening to the radio. I bite my lip and smile at Cas again, loving the way his eyes light up when he talks. I grab his hand and kneel in front of him, he smiles vaguely and I grin. He has no idea.
"Well, after Cas was knocked out, they all just waited for him to wake up, so that was thirty minutes of me worying he wouldn't take the next breath in." I feel a squeeze from beside me and I smile into Cas' shoulder, glad he was there.
"Come on Samuel, we got a class to get to." Gave winks at me and drapes an arm on top of Samuel's shoulder, almost having to stand on his tiptoes to reach the shaggy boy.
Dean! My eyes fly open and I frantically search for the blond haired boy, looking everywhere for his green eyes. When I find them my whole body freezes.
"Come on Cas. Let's bring you home." He nods rejectedly and I drive him home. When we pull into his driveway, I run around the car to open his door and I wrap my arm around him again. He smiles weakly and snuggles into my body, I smile at him and knock on the door. It flies open to reveal a dishiveled Chuck followed by the rest of Cas' family.
"I found 'em! And you won't believe what I walked in on!" We freeze at Alistair's voice and turn to face him, our faces flushed and our lips were swollen. The rest of the football team enters the willows sanctuary with Abbadon, she sighs as she walks in and clicks her fingers, pointing towards us.
"Thank you, Dean. You don't even realise what you've done but Castiel is so much happier whenever you're around. Just, don't break his heart, okay?" I nod and he ruffles my hair.
I pulled myself up and slowly made my way to the kitchen while clutching my ribs. I carefully rub the sleep out of my eyes and wander into the kitchen, freezing when I see Chuck sitting there with a newspaper and a coffee. He was so kind and accepting, he helped me without hesitating. He glances up and smiles broadly at me.
"Look at me, bitch!" I open my eyes and see him clicking out a pocket knife. I swallow the lump in my throat, he's only ever pulled that out about seven times in my life, and none of those were good.
I was enjoying spending time with Cas. Normally I would avoid social confrontations and never really make friends because we'd only move two weeks later. But this school was different, Dad had said so, we we're staying while he hunted by himself. So I was determined to make friends for the first time.
"I have a very serious question for you Cas." He says, his tone joyful. My lips curl into a smile and I reply.
"You're smart, Cas. You'll ace your exams and you'll get into college easily." He hugs me tightly and we make our way upstairs. We pass Kevin freaking out in the bathroom.
"Yeah, he told me all about your little 'problems'. How's that anxiety going? Still thinking of drowning yourself in alcohol and drugs?" I clench my jaw and flinch at his words, those were things that I had buried with the past.
"What would I do without you, Winchester. Now you two need to get ready, and no panic attacks in the exam, okay?" We smile and nod, walking towards the front door.
I carry him to his bed and take off his shoes and jacket before tucking him in and smoothing the hair off his forehead.
"What happened to him?" He asks, his voice shaking at the sight of Dean like that. The medics rush over to stand next to Sam and apologize for not realizing how upset he was. Sam just glares at them and tip toes over to Dean, calling to him softly. Sam reaches about a meter away when Dean whimpers and tries to move away, only for his bindings to get stuck. Sam freezes and turns to look at the medics slowly, a look of fear on his face.
"I'll always worry, especially when you still have nightmares that bad," I grunt out, my voice deep from sleep. I try to shake the fog clouding my mind but instead end up slightly dizzy. Dean smiles and gives me a small kiss before placing a plate of bacon and eggs in front of me.
That lasted maybe twenty minutes. The time it took for Dean to start flinching at the things being physically and verbally thrown at him. I had heard the murmurs throughout the class and I knew they were being said to us but I continued to ignore them until Dean reacted.
"I'm staying with mum for a bit before going to the navy and becoming a seal." Silence falls and Jo grins.
"Can I get a hand, please? These stupid buttons won't do up and I need to look presentable apparently. His voice his hoarse and rough and it makes my heart break at the emotional stress he's been put under his whole life.
"Hmmm, chicken, lemon, potato and mushroom." He grins and I begin preparing dinner. Sammy walks in and smiles at us.
"Someday, I'm gonna get in your pants and there's nothing your boy toy can do about it." He growls quietly and my eyes widen before I cover my mouth to stop the laughter. He frowns at me.
"My father recently gave me access to our college funds, and I currently have a few jobs that are bringing in the money I need to provide for Sammy. I am going to finish school, and then I'd like to attend the college in this town. But what allegations are there against my father?" I dread the questions to come but I know to keep Sammy I have to answer them.
"Duh, I said you'd get together this week. He said it would take another month." Sammy laughs again and then his laughter dies.
He cries quietly with a huge grin on his face, he just nods quickly, his voice failing him. I kiss him and pull him in for a hug. He sobs into my shoulder and starts talking.
"Then I woke Cas up and now he's worrying and when he worries, Sam worries. And then yesterday I got a call from my dad telling me he's gonna come visit and how he's now sober. How am I supposed to say no? He knows where I live and if I told him no, he'd break in and probably break Cas' neck!" I take a deep breath and groan.
"I'm fine, Sammy. Get some rest." I lie through my teeth. I am not okay, I'm shattered inside. The one thing I thought I could control in my life had been violated. And Cas...Cas is bruised and bandaged because of me.
"Take care of him, okay? I've got to go to class." I nod and Sam shoots Dean a worried look before running to class.
"I-I'm not really okay at all," I admit quietly. Chuck just wraps an arm around my shoulders and leads me to the comfy chair in the corner, he sits me down before grabbing the plastic chair from beside the bed and sitting in front of me.
When we get into the building I drop his hand and he sighs slightly, making my heart flutter. The things this boy made me feel were amazing and terrifying at the same time, I glance at him and roll my eyes which he laughs at. Halfway through his laugh he stops and hugs his torso tightly, grimacing in obvious pain.
"Okay, Sam. But Dean might not open up yet." He nods his thanks and slides into the kitchen, warily eyeing my father. The poor kids been through so much that he was wary even of someone that had helped him. I smile at my dad and he grins back, gesturing towards the plates of bacon, eggs and sausages.
"Why are you holding a gun to Cas' head?" I freeze at his words and my eyes widen, they couldn't be, could they? Hunters? My heart thumps wildly in my chest and I try to control my erratic breathing. I'm technically not a supernatural being, just descended from one, but hunters usually shoot first and then ask questions.
I look over at Dean again and notice he's still gazing into the distance, pale as death. I'd lead him over to the car park already and he hadn't noticed that he was standing next to his car. I nudge his shoulder again and start to panic slightly when he doesn't respond, I look around for help but the car park is empty except for a teenage boy sitting cross-legged on the bench opposite us, reading a book.
I freak out and quickly try to dry my tears before he comes any closer. He strides forwards and I find myself scrambling backwards, pressing my body into the couch as much as possible and squeezing my eyes shut. I brace for impact, anything, and jump when warm arms surround me. I pause before realising what was happening.
"Jesus, Dean. This looks pretty bad, are you sure no bones are broken?" I glance down at my black and purple midriff, prodding my ribs gently.
"Excellent, what happened to you?" He chuckles at my comment but stops when I don't laugh with him. He looked awful and wanted to know why- he was my best friend after all. I deserved to know why he looked dead on his feet and why he was struggling to open his eyes after each blink. The last two weeks he began to look like he was fading away, it was small things that gave it away.
"Hmm, come on boys. Who should we do what to?" Alistair's nasally voice crawls through the air and sends goosebumps up my arms.
I see him briefly as I storm out of the house and he frowns worridely, going to follow me. I sprint out the front door and run down the street, ignoring my fathers pleas for me to come back. Two weeks, two whole weeks of abuse every day. I was beyond pissed now, I was a ball of writhing black hatred and I need to get rid of it somehow.
"Sorry to ruin the happy moment guys, but what did you see Dean?" I feel Cas stiffen beside me and worriedly look down at him, he was shooting daggers into the ground. I shuffle my feet awkwardly and grab his hand, smiling when his cheeks tinge pink again. His eyes soften as he looks at me and suddenly Sammy's hand is snapping in between our faces.
"I'm nesting, I've always loved to cook, I just couldn't." We laugh and finish our meal, I say goodnight to Sammy and he goes to bed yawning. Cas yawns quietly and we head to my room, we crawl into bed and I whisper to Cas.
"T-thank you, s-sir. I-I....thanks." Dean's words stutter and I see Sam rise off his seat slightly. The connection between the two boys was crystal clear, and this was Sam watching out for Dean. I watch my dad gesture for Dean to come closer and Sam clenches his fists tightly.
I think about who to call when I remember Dean's little brother Sam. He would still be at school since Dean was driving him home, my head snaps up to look at the teenager on the bench and almost cry when I recognize the shaggy brown hair.
I felt awful dumping my problems onto Cas, and he looked so devastated. I slump my shoulders and carefully observe my weather worn boots until I hear Sammy cry out. My head snaps up, my heart pounding in my chest and when I see what's happening my blood boils.
I go to help him when a strong body collides with the back of me and I go flying into the locker, slamming my face onto the scuffed doors. I hear a familiar snicker and turn around to see Alistair grinning at me with a cruel gleam in his eyes. I go to stand up when I hear a hiss from next to me, twirling into a defensive position I see Azazel pushing Dean into a locker by pressing on his ribs.
But that's not what's wrong, I turn to observe Sam because if something was wrong with Sam, Dean would be upset. Sam was bundled up in a jacket too big for him and a thick scarf but he looked fine. I tilted my head to the side and noticed that Sam's jacket was actually Dean's.
"I'm going into politics and on my way to becoming President," Kevin says while stuffing his face with Cheetos. I blush slightly and nuzzle into Cas' shoulder, everyone was doing such amazing things and then there's me.
But he also wore a mask of arrogance. A mask that even fooled me into believing he was the idiotic stereotypical jock, even when he started working himself into the ground. A muffled sob escapes my mouth, not even Sam knew Dean's hard work. He thought Dean hung out with the football team every night, Sam didn't know Dean had three jobs.
"Are you okay? What's happening? Why are you both so tense right now? Sorry, I invited my dad but I needed help and medicine. How's your head now Sam? I also got dad to bring some food cause I know what's..."
"Where do we get the money, De? Why are you so...so...fragile lately?" Sam asks the floor instead of Dean and Dean sighs before repeating the same story he did yesterday. I watch as Sam's face falls and he bites his lip to stop the tears that are already flowing.
"Fairly boring question but what is your favourite colour?" I twist the straw through the thick blue milkshake.
Then Dean leans forwards and buries his face in my dad's shoulder, hugging him tightly. I see Sam relax immediately and his eyes soften, my dad pats Dean on the back and the two pull apart. I tune into my angel senses and study their souls, my dads was warm and happy, Deans was as bright as the sun and full of affection.
I take another deep breath and breathe out slowly, trying to calm my racing heart. My pulse manages to slow and the tears stop long enough for me to stand up and wander back to Sam and Dean.
"Oh, Dean. You make a girl think very naughty things." She giggles, playing with the edge of her blue dress. I widen my eyes and try to throw her off but one of the jock presses a thumb into the word carved on my shoulder. I squeeze my eye shut and Abbadon gets off my lap, I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.
I let out a shuddering breath and tentatively wrap my arms back around him. He rubs my back and I start sobbing again, the hug reminding me of the days that dad came home happy and sober. I fell asleep in his arms.
I pull out the ingredients for pancakes and notice our depleted stock of food that consisted of milk, butter and half a can of beer. I make a mental checklist of the things I need to do today.
He knees me in the stomach and I double over, then he kicks my knee out from under me and suddenly I'm on the floor. The kicks follow soon after and I curl into a ball trying to protect myself from their anger. A stray boot connects with my ribs and I hear a crack, followed by a scream. The scream was coming from me and I try to crawl away but someone kicks my face.
When we get there I head straight towards Dean's room and immediently climb into bed next to him, ignoring the fact that him and Sam were sleeping. He subconciously wraps an arm around me and I fall asleep to his steady breathing.
Charlie talks non-stop through class and Dean and I sit next to each other, finding ourselves liking this new girl. Halfway through the lesson, I start joining in on the conversation and Dean links his hand in mine, making Charlie squeal again.
Azazel laughs at the noise and kicks Cas' face, causing him to fly onto his back. they pull their feet back again and I scream, pushing myself off the wall to try and get to Cas. Cas looks over at me with pleading eyes and I start crying, desperate to save him. I struggle again and Abbadon walks into my line of vision.
Dean shuffles his feet nervously and rubs the back of his neck slightly, he's obviously uncomfortable so instead I look around the lockers lining the hall.
"Good evening, table for three? Right this way, please..." I lead them over to a table and hand out menus.
I frantically try to keep my eyes open, to watch Dean, but the blackness creeps into my vision and I'm swept into unconsciousness.
"Ha ha, Cas, very funny. How are the hands?" He waves two bandaged hands in front of my face and I have to tilt my torso to see the road. He explains the injury as I try not to scream at the fact that the shirt just pushed against the wounds.
My eyes wander aimlessly around the crappy motel room, noticing every stain and crack. It was pretty high standard to what we were used to, but I'm looking forward to being able to afford an apartment. My eyes flit over the fist shaped while in the wall quickly, avoiding the memories of last night. It wasn't as bad as it could have been, but it could have turned out better. I knew my dad could be caring and even loving at times, but it also got pretty bad when something ticked him off. I had learnt quickly how to avoid bringing out that side of him, by being obedient and protecting Sammy.
I smile and ruffle his hair, almost missing the small flinch. I frown and leave the room, telling the nurse to bring in another comfy chair.
"Well Cassie, while Abbadon gets ready for that I'm telling you about these kids. They really don't like ya, I mean they would've stopped after the first week but then they saw you kiss and woah. I have never felt so much hate and jealousy." He grins but my eyes are on the struggling Dean and smiling Abbadon.
"You too, huh?" I nod and grin at him, which makes him blush. He scratches his chin a bit and then asks another question. I take a long drink of my milkshake, this place did have the best Blur Heaven I've ever tried.
"Great, so, did you know all clownfish are born male? And when the breeding female dies the breeding male becomes the breeding female?" I twirl my pen between my fingers and laugh out loud at his stunned face. He opens his mouth a few times and then just frowns at his hands, shaking his head and whispering 'what?' quietly to himself. I grin and wave my hand in front of his face,
"I love you too, Dean Winchester." He smiles against my shoulder again and we close our eyes, hoping to sleep before our final exams.
Candles covered the tables and the couch was pushed against the back wall, where it usually sat was covered with our mattress and lots of pillows. Dean was laying down and humming softly, his body covered in blankets and a basket on the other side of the bed.
We sit down in desks made for only two people and the jocks sit around us again, Mr Cain puts on a history movie and the room darkens. I hear the whispered insults begin again and my patience boils thin until something warm slips its way into my hand.
Bobby laughs, a full-fledged, head thrown backwards laugh. His eyes screw shut and his shoulders shake and soon the contagious sound rubs off and I start laughing.
I follow his car into the car park and feel my heart sinking in my chest as Sam clambers out of the car and enters one of the motel rooms, waving to Dean with a carefree hand. Dean waves back and pulls out again, spiking my interest. I had never been one to pry into my friend's lives before but Dean Winchester just made me so damn curious.
"Sweet dreams, Sammy." He smiles in his sleep and rolls over, leaving me to wander off to my room and fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow.
I sigh and pull into the motel car park, barely putting my baby into park before Sam scrambles out of the car and rushes inside, claiming he was starving. I groan and rub my eyes, leaving baby's door open as I poke my head inside the door.
That's why I'm here. I tell myself that I'm only looking out for a friend, but it feels a lot like stalking right now. Guilt rises in my chest and I shove it down, instead casually following Dean's car. I recall why I was doing this and I know that I needed to find out.
"Alright, well, in that case, I've got a beauty for ya today, 67 Red Corvet, got a problem with the brakes." I smile gratefully and salute him casually, he just laughs and walks off, leaving me to the car. I walk around the corner with my toolbox and whistle at the car, it's in perfect condition and the paintwork it awesome.
"Your unicorn just woke up and he's a little stressed. Would you like me to wheel you to him or do you want to see your family first?" I shake my head, Sam would want to spend time with his brother.
"You have the brightest soul I've ever seen, Dean Winchester." He chuckles lightly and continues to stroke my hair as I fall asleep, letting the darkness take away the pain coming from every part of my body.
We snap back to reality and Dean scrambles away again panting heavily. Sam stands up shakily and pulls me into a bone-crushing hug, but I was distracted by the blond boy sitting underneath the willow with his head between his knees and his hands clasped above his head.
"Cas. I noticed that Sam and Dean had a shockingly depleted stock of food, so I packed Dean some lunch as he looked a little pale, please send him my kind regards and invite the brothers over for dinner tonight. Dad." He then proceeds to pull out two containers full of spaghetti and two forks. I sit up quickly and wince at the pain but grin when Cas offers me a container.
"Dean," I say softly, crouching down in front of him. He shudders and I touch his shoulder gently which causes him to flinch violently and whip his head up. There are tears in his eyes and his gaze is frantic as he identifies that it's me. He gently reaches forwards and strokes my face in wonder.
"When I was younger I was captured by a Wendigo on a hunt, it thought it would be fun to hear some screams. Dad saved my ass before it really got started, but these never healed fully." He shrugs. I pull him towards the bed and he hugs me gently. He takes a deep breath and I feel him smile against my shoulder.
"I'm going straight to uni for a gaming course, I get to design computer games biyatches, beat that!" Charlie shouts, a smile splitting her face.
I walk over to my wardrobe and pick out today's outfit, feeling slightly silly as I realize I want to impress Dean a bit more. I pull out my black jeans and baggy jumper with the Twenty One Pilots symbol printed across it. I put a singlet on, then a shirt, then my jumper, to top the outfit off I place my navy blue beenie on my head and my black and red converse on.
"I don't object! He's yours! All yours!" We all laugh and Chuck calls us in for dinner. We sit down and I smile at Sammy when he walks into the room with Gabe and Lucifer. We laugh over dinner and I stand up at the end.
Ms Talbot said our homeroom teachers would assign our lockers and tour guides for the day. I mentally map my surroundings, a habit I find helps me concentrate. The floors are a grey blue and covered in marks, the walls are a faded cream and the lockers are faded blue. Outside looks nice, green grass and a small forest bordering the perimeter, a small pond reflecting the grey of the sky and benches everywhere. I start to fiddle with my black hoodie and wonder if I would miss the city and my old school. I hear Dean clear his throat and I focus my gaze back on him. He grins and opens the door, bowing dramatically at me.
"Please Cas, just go to cl-" I press my lips to his briefly to shut him up and then move so I can sit on the bench next to him while he explains. He sighs and closes his eyes. When he speaks his voice is hollow and monotone.
I'm worried about tomorrow, really worried, but I think I'll do okay. Cas smiles and works his way over to me and Charlie, who was currently trying to put her feet back on my face. Cas pushes Charlie's feet off and launches himself onto me, causing me to yell out and try to not stab him with a ruler.
"Sam, this is my dad, Chuck. He's brought some pain medication for you, okay?" Sam gives me a shocked look before nodding slightly and holding a shaking hand out to my dad. I notice dad pause briefly before shaking Sam's hand an then rummaging through the bag he bought.
"Not perfect, but he's doing okay. He's calmer when you're around, at home he was a nervous wreck. What about you? and don't give me that crap about how you're fine, Castiel told me you're not good with admitting you need help." I smile at how much Cas has told his dad and then my smile drops.
"Dean, we should probably keep this on the down-low until the football team relaxes a bit." He frowns but releases my hand. I smile at him and he grins back, I grab his hand anyways and drag him to class.
"Dean? Oh thank- Cas just ran out of the house crying and I have no idea where to look. He left a note saying not to worry and he'd be back but now I'm worrying and I don't know where he is and-"
"We'll get through it Cas. We just have to be strong, can you do that for the next few classes?" He asks softly. The next classes we were separated and I felt dread seep into my bones at the thought. I hug Dean closely and murmur to him.
My heart plummets and I grab his wrist, leading him to the bathroom next to the janitors closet. That was a bruise on his face and I wasn't there when he got it, I look back in worry and see him with a clenched jaw and a gaze fixed on the floor in pain.
Over the past few months, we'd both begun to heal together and we were happier than we'd ever been, Dean especially. I have never seen him so vibrant and healthy. Our therapist told us to stick together as we grounded each other, multiple times I woke up screaming and only Dean could calm me down. But that didn't happen much anymore, occasionally I heard the demon's laughter in my dreams, but Dean's smile soon calmed me.
I gently pulled him down with me and he curled up in my lap as I leant against the tree trunk, his head was burrowed into my shoulder and his arms were wrapped tightly around my neck. He sniffles and grabs my hair tightly, pulling my closer until I gasped in pain.
Abbadon huffs and touches Dean's elbow, I see his eyes widen and then his face smooths into a mask once again. He turns around and I watch carefully, yes I was being overprotective but Abbadon had just about been with every guy in the school. Abbadon leans forward, giving us the perfect view of her chest and then twirls her fiery red hair around her manicured nails.
"Dean?!? Are you in there?!?" A frantic voice calls from the door. Not long after loud knocks can be heard, along with hushed voices and dogs barking. The demons in the room freeze and I almost laugh when the person speaks again and I recognize it.
I race outside grinning and almost yelp when I step into the cold, I stumble into the car and groan at the warmth inside it.
The kiss was the single most perfect thing I have ever experienced. It was more than I had dared hoped for and it sent electricity shooting all over my body and when Cas wound his fingers into my hair it took all of my strength not to melt into his touch and moan.
"They-" Sammy stops abruptly and glances down at me, I give him a nod and my dad looks at us, frowning in concern.
He smiles and I quickly follow suit, trying to get my breathing and emotions under control. What he just told me, I've never heard before. Not even Cas has told me something like that and it made me wish for a better childhood. His smile lowers a little, and dread fills my veins.
"No, no, no. You couldn't have seen that you weren't meant to see that. Goddammit Cas, please tell me you didn't see what I saw." He turns to me and stares at me pleadingly.
"I would erase inequality." We both sit there awkwardly for a bit while drinking our milkshakes. I try to think of a question to break the ice, I grin at him mischievously, an idea forming in my head.
"Dude, Asia? It's 6:30! I'm already up so turn your crappy music off!" I laugh at his disgruntled voice but turn the radio off nonetheless. I didn't want him to go to school frustrated, he needed to pay attention and get a good education.
He runs a hand through my hair and traces the line of skin showing between my pants and shirt. I caress his face with one of my hands and weave my fingers through his hair, he moans slightly into my mouth and I push him into the trunk of the tree, briefly pulling back to growl at him.
The next few hours were spent with me dancing and singing obnoxiously loud to my music while I set up my room. I moved my bed directly across from my door, directly under the window and pushed my desk to the left wall. The rest of the wall was covered in posters and there were books and art supplies thrown everywhere. I grin at my handwork and admire the view from my window, a fairly dirty street on which our house was the big mansion. There were a few dirty motel rooms down the road and a small grocery store on the corner.
"I also have some proper medication for my anxiety so I can control it. I take one tablet before school and that's it, I won't have an anxiety attack." He grins proudly and I can't help but grin back, pulled in my his infectious smile. My body thrums with pain but on the outside, I knew I had to hide this from Sammy, but I didn't know if I could hide it from Cas.
I didn't understand why he was crying, but one glimpse at his soul and I knew he needed me. I wrap my arms around his waist and watch as his soul calms and becomes peaceful. I nuzzle into his neck slightly and grin when he leans back into me, his breathing become steady.
"T-There's more, De." Sam begins and my breath leaves my body. I frantically look at Cas and he nods grimly, my worries ease a bit and I know Cas won't leave me.
That afternoon we stumble out of class laughing like maniacs. I massage my cheeks, which were sore from smiling and glance side-long to Dean who was doing the same thing. We both notice that we're mimicking each other and burst out laughing again.
"Go to Cas, Sammy. Go to Cas right now and don't look back, okay? He'll take care of you." Sammy's wide eyes find mine and he whispers back to me.
"Yep." I reply, popping the 'p'. He grins and walks over to me, he was wearing the same thing as yesterday, worn jeans, black shirt and red plaid shirt with scuffed black boots. He looks really good. He laughs and plops his books down next to mine.
"I thought you said no inappropriate questions!" Dean says while flicking my hand, sending sparks down my arm. Keep your cool, Cas. It's only been a few days.
"It's okay, Dean. We'll figure it out, I'll help you, okay? We're best friends, that's what best friends do." I pull back and instead hug myself. How could anyone do that to such a sweet, selfless person? Dean deserved better, and so did Sam. Speaking of Sam I could hear his voice yelling, looking at Dean I saw his fear filled expression for a split second before it changed to anger.
"Please Cas, don't tell your dad. I tried that, hell I've tried everything to get Sammy out of there but our dad always finds us. I told one of Sammy's friend's mother once and we got away, we were put up for adoption together and everything looked great until our father came in. He was sober and mortified that his sons were in an orphanage and he immediately broke us out, then he got drunk that night and it was awful. The things he did..." Dean trails off and shudders.
"My mum died in a house fire when I was four, my dads never around much." He shrugs slightly and my heart squeezes in my chest. They were almost alone.
"You can can't you? Pity you don't have the high to turn to now, imagine how disappointed daddy would be if that happened. We're gonna make your life hell, kid. Just you wait." I look away and swallow my reply, knowing that this was all to get a rise out of me.
"When he woke up Abbadon sat on my lap and starting kissing me, thats where the story stopped, right?" Nods from everyone.
"Because he's supernatural, he just went into your head and I couldn't get either of out of it." Sam's shaky voice pipes up from behind me and I watch Dean's face go pale again. I feel the cool metal of a gun being pressed into my skull and I hear Sam begin to talk.
"You gonna be alright for a while, Sammy? I want to go for a drive." He shouts back a yes and I climb back into the car. I open the glove box as I drive around town and pull out my resume before pulling over outside a place called The Roadhouse.
I open the door and see Charlie, Jo, Ash, and Kevin grinning at my door. I invite them in and we sprawl across the lounge room, Cas sitting on my lap. I idly play with his hair as we talk about our after school plans.
I only woke up occasionally when he had a nightmare and I've told him multiple times to wake me up but he doesn't. Some times he disappears into his own thoughts and only I can get him out, but both of us had improved.
