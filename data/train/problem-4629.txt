You got anything?
EILEEN
2MusicLover2
I’m not, but I can still do small things for you. Like the Rice Krispie treat! Cas and I made it.
I’ll come with you.
Dean? You home?
GABRIEL
Dean drops his toast on a plate and picks up a knife to start buttering it as Sam scrambles eggs and Castiel watches on contently from the doorway, still invisible to the two brothers.
"Oh yeah!" Ash said, bolting up out of the booth. "Hey, Lucifer! Come take everyone's orders!" Ash shouted.
The Roadhouse is back to its former glory, now in Heaven.
(quietly, we can barely hear it)
7  INT. IMPALA – LATER
ALEX/DEMON
The remaining party-goers are spread throughout the room, talking amongst themselves.
Well, how’d you survive, then?
EMILY
With-- never mind. Sorry, I didn’t grab you before coming here.
GABRIEL
One seven.
GABRIEL
When Chuck had us under his control, Dean... Dean died. He got killed on a hunt, and I had to live without him. And I did. I lived for more than forty years after Dean died. I had a whole other life.
(protective, angry)
Sleep well?
To visit Eileen. Apparently, he didn’t do that last time and he wants to make up for it.
I really thought I was out. Why can’t I just be out?
No. I didn't even know you would be here, honest. If I did, I wouldn't have come. Bad for business, you see?
EILEEN
It wasn’t my intention to hide from you. Although, I can say you’ve done a fantastic job of hiding from the Winchesters.
Well, then, it’s a good thing we’ve got time to celebrate this year.
"No, I got excused from class to show Charlie around the school. I just texted you and asked you to join me." Dean smirked at his friend.
5  INT. HELL – THRONE ROOM – MOMENTS LATER
GABRIEL
(muttering now)
ROWENA
CASTIEL
(to Sam and Dean)
Sitting on the bed of one of the holding cells is Emily, hunched over herself and staring at her hands.
"Okay, man." Dean said, confused by his best friend's unusual behavior.
Get him out!
Meanwhile, on the Ferris wheel, a couple sits, kissing. As their seat gets closer to the ground, they pull apart and we see that the man is Jamie, smirking at the girl as his eyes flash black.
END OF ACT ONE
I know, I was just clarifying. I’m sorry.
TEASER
Bobby contemplates this as he studies Cas for a moment before he stands up.
Around the edges of the throne room stand several demons, and sitting on a throne made of blackened bones in the center of the room is ROWENA, bored out of her mind as she listens to a demon explaining the goings on of Hell.
"Gabriel Shurley get your mind out of the gutter!" Becky snapped.
(thinking back over what Jack said)
Eileen nods.
Emily chokes on the salt as Gertrude is expelled from her body. Eileen removes her hand from Emily’s mouth and helps her to stand.
Do you know if anyone else was with Patrick and Christopher?
8  INT. CORONER’S OFFICE – RECEPTION – DAY
FADE IN:
JAMIE
I need you here with me, man... I can’t do this without you.
Sure enough, the appearance of the angels had gained Bela’s attention, and she had disappeared, no trace of her left anywhere.
I’m just saying, Dean. It feels like there’s more we could be doing.
I want to help you with that, though, and I can’t do that unless you tell me what is going on.
ROWENA
Another wave of murmurs washes over the crowd.
Well, so do I, but I’m not going to torture some poor kid over it.
Sounds fun.
What do you mean, something “odd” about my death?
I told you: we won. Chuck has been defeated, and now, we have work to do.
8  EXT. PACIFIC PARK – CONTINUOUS
EMILY
I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.
I see. And who is it you would like me to find?
Another murder-- some hikers just called in the bodies. Looks like the same M.O. as the campers who were killed this weekend.
Hear what, Dean?
CASTIEL
Dean looks between Jack, Cas, and the Rice Krispie treat with a fond smile-- he really is the luckiest man alive to be able to be here, alive, and with all of these people that he loves and that love him in return.
JACK (CONT’D)
Everyone throws their cards into the center of the table with varying degrees of disappointment at their losses.
Standing next to the campfire is Gertrude. When Emily sees her, she gasps and freezes for a second before slowly moving towards the little girl with an outstretched hand.
Sam and Dean start walking down the hall together as they continue to talk.
6  INT. MEN OF LETTERS – HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS
CASTIEL
"Okay. I'll just wait in my car until one of you get there." Charlie said.
Meg lays on top of the covers on Castiel's bed, her shirt and face caked with her own blood, and her hands clutching at her stomach. Cas, Dean, and Sam all enter the room slowly.
(emotionally tired)
Cas, could you give us a minute?
We ZOOM IN and focus on DEAN’S JACKET laying by his pillow, Castiel’s bloody handprint visible on the sleeve...
"Um... okay. So... how many siblings do you guys have?" Charlie questioned.
Jack thinks for a moment before a smile crosses his face.
Jack! What is going on? What happened? How were you able to pull me from The Empty?
"Luci, what did you do?" Michael asked, pretending to be exasperated.
Of course! Um, right this way.
CUT TO--
CASTIEL
Alex’s weight rests on Sam, just barely awake as they stand next to the pier with Eileen, Cas, Meg, and Jack. As they stand together, we ZOOM OUT until Dean and Jamie appear in frame, walking towards the group.
We hear a flutter of wings and PULL BACK to see Castiel. As he comes into view, he starts walking towards the Roadhouse.
"Like when he kept trying to get my brother, Sammy, to let him 'possess' him, whatever that means." Dean added.
We need to split up. Three teams of two. It’s the only way we’ll cover enough area to even make it possible to find Bela or Jamie. Sam and I can go together, Meg and Jack, and Dean and Cas.
I don’t think he knows that I can hear him.
The beach is crowded, families everywhere both in the water and on the sand. Two men-- ALEX and JAMIE-- throw a frisbee back and forth. CLOSE ON the frisbee as Alex throws it and it flies through the air. A hand reaches out and grabs it-- clearly not Jamie, this is the hand of a woman.
You know the demon?
I’m positive. Look at the computers, all of the walls between everyone’s personal heaven are disappearing, just like I wanted.
POLICE OFFICER
Jack grabs Castiel gently by the elbow and they disappear as we CUT TO--
Neither did I. But I figured why not.
CASTIEL
Sam and Eileen exchange a slightly confused look as they sit down in the two chairs next to the door.
What’s going on?
CASTIEL
Because you helped save the world. You saved him, and you deserve to be back. I’m sorry about what you went through when you were dead, and I will try to find a way to make it better, but for now all we can do is move on. I may be taking a hands-off approach to being God, but that doesn’t mean we can’t visit them. The Winchesters are family.
Dean’s attention shifts to Cas, clearly startled by his appearance as he bursts into the room looking panicked.
9  EXT. SANT MONICA BEACH – MOMENTS LATER
Why would you bring a demon to Heaven?
What’s on your mind, Cas? Somethin’s eatin’ away at you. Come on, out with it.
A beat.
"Uh... just a heads up: I'm a lesbian." Charlie stated when she felt Dean's hand slide down from her elbow into her own hand.
I need you, you know that? And what you said... before you... me too. Okay? Me too.
That’s what we would hope, isn’t it? No, it’s another demon. I think it's the one that was possessing Jamie.
(through his teeth)
Sam leaves the dishes there and leaves the kitchen.
Rowena continues gasping for air on the floor, until Bela rolls her eyes and releases her clenched fist.
(hesitantly)
18 INT. DINER – EARLY MORNING
DEAN (CONT’D)
BOBBY (CONT’D)
"Privacy? Show of favoritism? I honestly don't know, it's just always been that way." Dean shrugged and took Charlie's plate, putting the dishes in a sink to be washed before grabbing a paper plate with a slice of pie that someone had left out. "Where do you want to go next?"
ALEX/DEMON
Meanwhile, Sam is looking around him frantically.
DEAN (CONT’D)
(suddenly guilty)
You said the one thing you wanted, you couldn’t have. But you can have it, Cas. You’ve already had it for a long time now.
Whatever makes you happy, Sam.
"Then prepare to have that changed." Dean said and he pushed the doors open revealing several cooks running about cooking several different meals from scratch. Dean picked up two plates and he put a little bit of everything on each plate before handing one to Charlie and grabbing silverware for each of them.
Castiel smiles at Jack, although it doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
"Lucifer and Gabriel." Cass and Dean said at the same time.
What? What’s wrong?
GABRIEL
Jack nods and narrows his eyes at her, watching as she continues to talk to whoever is next to her.
"I can assure you I am Dean!" Dean said, finally managing to get Michael to release his face. "You would lose your appetite too if you had those fries Luci fed us."
"That's cool, I still want to be friends. It doesn't really matter to me who you like, I'm bi." Dean replied not letting go of her hand and dragging her along through the hallways. Finally, they stopped in front of a set of swinging doors through which the smell of food drifted and Charlie was surprised that it actually smelled really good. "This is my favorite place in the entire building: the kitchen."
So, Chuck... removed everyone from Earth? But then you defeated him... or you thought you did... and we all returned? But you hadn’t really defeated him then. But you have now.
The Empty is less crowded and chaotic than before, but there is still a constant hum of voices. We PAN across crowds of demons and even a few angels wandering aimlessly or talking to each other until we find Jack, facing off against the human-shaped pool of nothing that is The Empty.
(quietly)
12 EXT. PARK – DAY
Chuck wasn’t destroyed, Jack just took his power-- and you didn’t help!
Sam nods as he spots a teenage girl siting on a beach towel under an umbrella, typing something on a laptop.
Ugh, really, dude? Can you learn to clean up after yourself?
28 INT. MEN OF LETTERS - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Alex should have my number. If either of you ever need anything again, you let us know, okay?
Jack woke everyone there up, for starters.
(confused)
You shouldn't have brought me here.
EMILY
(See the end of the chapter for
--and Michael.
STEVIE
CASTIEL
Bela smirks.
Gertrude doesn’t answer. Instead, she grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away from the camp.
Sam gets up and heads back over to the parking lot as Dean pulls out his phone and dials Rowena’s number.
Yeah, sounds good.
ROWENA
END OF ACT ONE
Sam moves the phone away from his mouth to address Eileen.
Sam studies Dean for a moment before he nods his head.
Cas. Be careful, buddy. I can’t lose you again.
Dr. Lewis nods her head as she shakes each Sam and Eileen’s hands.
CASTIEL
Jack grins as he returns the hug.
What happened?
(into phone)
CASTIEL
"Dad won't care because we got excused from class to show Charlie around the school." Cass said.
I-- no.
EILEEN
Now. I’ve been listening to the angels talking, and Jack is missing. No one can find him in Heaven or on Earth.
ACT ONE
Instead of Dean answering, Gabriel appears in the doorway of the barn.
(still clearly tired)
Yep. Well, technically it'll never be complete. But we don't have to do any more renovations. It'll just keep changing as more souls enter and it'll change slightly based on what their idea of Heaven is.
"It's not that funny guys." Dean mumbled.
Come on, that one was a little low, don’t you think? Exorcising me from my own body?
Jack disappears, back in Heaven, but Castiel remains.
Eileen shouts and tosses a lighter to Sam, who just barely manages to catch it.
Neither do I. That’s why we’re staying here to make sure nothing else happens.
Where did it go? That’s-- it was right here, where did it go?
We have a huge garage full of cars, Dean.
Focus on Jack, proud of his work so far as God, and Castiel, annoyed and dreading the prospect of having to work alongside Gabriel...
(mumbling)
Eileen looks at him expectantly as we hear Dean’s voice through the phone.
CASTIEL
"We're not dating!" Dean and Cass said at the same time.
FADE IN:
"Oh. Okay!" Charlie said, then she thought over what he said. "Wait, they're dating?" She whispered.
Hey, it’s okay, we’ll find your friend, yeah? We’ll get him for you and he’ll be okay.
From the parking lot, Cas and Sam walk over to join Dean.
Jack smiles at Cas again, although this smile is weaker than the previous ones.
You mean... Chuck’s in my head?
It’s been a week since Jack brought us back. I figure that’s enough time to let most of Adam’s anger at me cool down, so I’m going to visit him and let him know I’m back. Just as I thought you’ve been doing with Dean for the past week.
Sam raises his eyebrows at Dean.
I need to speak with Ash.
GABRIEL
Castiel frowns at Dean and Dean looks at Cas apologetically.
Anything to keep you from going back to Heaven.
Castiel gives Balthazar a judging look.
EILEEN
He's not my-- whatever, you won't listen anyways. Where's Jack?
CASTIEL
(feigning annoyance)
You don’t have to be scared to tell me, Sam.
(frustrated)
Thank you all for helping us. I-- thank you.
Dean?
END OF ACT FOUR
Now, I think we need more angels for this next part, but I’m going to need you to tell me which ones we should and shouldn’t bring back.
"Oh. I thought it was just 'cause, y'know, you're Satan." Dean laughed and Lucifer shot him a bitchface to rival Sam's.
"Aw, come on, Luci! Why you gotta be so rude?" Dean said, grinning.
Reese rolls his eyes as he holds his beer can upside down to show that it's empty.
I’m sorry, Dean. I’m going to have to call you back on that.
(distracted)
"Then what did you do?" Cass questioned, still grimacing from the taste that refused to leave his mouth.
And then with Sam, it’s-- he’s already mourned my death, mourned everyone’s deaths.
Sam walks into the library and sits down across from Dean. He pulls out his own laptop and searches through it for a few moments before speaking.
31 INT. MEN OF LETTERS - CASTIEL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
On Dean’s turn, he adds his last card to the pile with a smug look around the table.
It’s okay, I understand. You needed some time alone. To “cool off”.
Thank you for understanding.
Eileen gently pushes Sam away so she can look at him as she talks to him.
After a moment, Cas speaks up.
Not helping, Meg.
Emily follows Gertrude through forest, scared.
14 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS
MEG (CONT’D)
CASTIEL
EILEEN
We focus on Dean’s excited face as he grins at his friends and family as we--
"One, I don't like her that way, and B, even if I did she's gay so..." Dean said.
"Ugh. Ash! We need to order our food!" Dean said, seemingly frustrated with his cousin, although he was laughing.
Are you all right? What did Bela want?
Hi, there. Are you lost?
(mumbling)
BOBBY
Yeah, sure. I’ll tell him.
PAN around a briefing room in Chuck’s heaven, now full of ANGELS. Among the faces, we see GABRIEL, BALTHAZAR, and MICHAEL in the body of young John Winchester. At the front of the room stand Jack and Castiel.
Still, no answer from Gertrude.
You’re right. But, at least, I can recreate dear old Castiel’s death and force you to watch!
Rowena! You called at the perfect--
Pushy, pushy... I was getting there. My first clue that something weird was going on was when Sam and Dean here didn’t go looking for everyone who Chuck had poofed away. Especially Sam not looking for Eileen, not even after Dean died.
27 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CROW’S NEST – DAY
Is that everything, then?
Now, now, Dean. Sam’s not the only one who forgot. You were still living for a week after you defeated Chuck, remember? And you didn’t go searching for any of those people either. But what really shocked me the most was that you didn’t try to break Cassie, here, out of The Empty. That one shocked me the most, because you clearly remembered him, you prayed to him every day--
Wait over there, I’ll page Dr. Lewis.
Cas, what’s wrong? I thought you were in-- what happened?
13 EXT. PACIFIC PARK – FERRIS WHELL – CONTINUOUS
2  EXT. FIRE STATION – DAY
Sam looks at Dean with concern for a moment.
Sam’s phone rings in his pocket and he pulls it out, the display read ‘Dean’ and he answers.
Charlie Bradbury was not looking forward to starting the school year at Sioux Falls High. She got enough attention when she moved into the quaint little town and she didn't want the extra attention that came with being the new kid. Normally, she chose bigger towns where students were less likely to notice her, but she moved into Sioux Falls at the end of August and had liked it there. When she found out that school would be starting, she figured she should probably go.
Dean leans back and moves a hand to cup Castiel’s face. He bites his lip for a moment, a range of emotions flickering over his face before he settles for exaggeratedly rolling his eyes as he drops his hand back down to Castiel’s shoulder.
CASTIEL
Wes. Wes, wake up. We should move to the tent.
Meg is closest to Jack and she quickly whips around and stabs the demon in the neck with her angel blade, causing it to crumple to the floor as it releases Jack, who rubs his neck in slight pain.
"Uh... not that I know of, no." Ash replied.
"Eh. I'll just tell Dad that you found me and decided to hold me as a prisoner in the library. He'll believe me." Cass shrugged.
"Too many. There's Michael who's 25, then Lucifer who's 24, Raphael is 22, and Gabriel and Balthazar are 21, then Uriel is 19, I'm 17, Anna is 16, Hannah is 14, Hester and Naomi are 9, then Samandriel, who we call Alfie, is 5. So that means I have... 11 siblings. My parents need to learn what birth control is." Castiel listed.
Sam turns his computer to show the picture to Eileen.
Jack holds out a hand which Castiel cautiously takes.
Eileen wraps her arms around Sam comfortingly.
When we first see Dean driving, he is alone, but then--
Okay, I will. See you, Cas. Good luck.
Emily sniffles and tears start welling up in her eyes.
"Dean and I will have the usual. Charlie, what do you want?" Cass said.
Let him go.
We PAN across a view of the length of Santa Monica Pier, thriving with activity. The beaches are crowded; the ocean is full of people swimming, surfing, and boating; the amusement park is bustling with activity.
Castiel sobs again as he pulls his knees up to his chest.
On it.
Eileen smiles at Sam and pushes his plate back towards him.
"In Gabriel's defense, when I went to get Deano and Cassie to set the table, I heard Dean say something that immediately made my thoughts go bad places. Turns out they were just playing Call of Duty and Cass was being killed by zombies." Lucifer said and the whole table burst into laughter (except for Hester, Naomi, and Alfie because they were innocent and Dean and Castiel because they were blushing like crazy).
END OF ACT THREE
TOMMI
Sam steps closer to the cell and Emily looks up at them.
"How did you know that's where my mind went? Unless... Mother!" Gabriel replied, still laughing.
Why did she hang up? She’s the one that called you.
(into phone)
I, uh, I only meant to call on Castiel, not all of you.
"Sorry!" Everyone said as they got off of Dean and the floor.
I’ve changed my mind.
Jack, are you sure--
"Enjoy your food. I made it myself." Lucifer smiled devilishly (even though that's technically how he always smiles because, well, Lucifer) and handed Charlie her strawberry milkshake and cheeseburger, Dean his bacon cheeseburger and chocolate milkshake, and Cass his two cheeseburgers and chocolate milkshake, then he set a basket of fries between Dean and Cass for them to share.
He's alive, just passed out.
Lucifer followed them downstairs and sat at the bar while they set the table for 14 people. Surprisingly, they didn't break anything, even though they were being idiots and pushing each other around the kitchen as they carried things. It didn't take them long and once they were done they sat on either side of me at the bar, waiting for Becky  and Michael to finish cooking.
It’s done. Gertrude’s ghost has been banished.
Sam and Eileen walk together along the beach, Sam with his phone out, tracking the coordinates of Alex’s phone. As they get closer to the pier, they can see Alex leaning against the side. Once they get close enough to see, Alex’s eyes turn black.
DEAN, CASTIEL, SAM, and JACK stand around Castiel’s bed, where MEG is laying, leaning against the headboard.
Dean thinks it over for a moment-- he didn’t realize there was such an exact science behind the workings of Hell.
Um. Yeah. Basically.
(teasing)
Castiel tilts his head at Dean, thinking what he could possibly mean, and then he smiles as Dean pulls him into another hug.
ROWENA
None.
So, are you gonna tell us why you brought us back here or...?
Jamie!!
JAMIE
Jack! Jack, are you okay?
Sam? What are you doing?
Shh, it’s family movie time.
26 INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY
"Who are you and what have you done with Dean?" Becky demanded.
I don’t know what exactly happened before you died, there’s clearly more to this that I don’t know-- and quite honestly, I don’t care to know it-- but you are here. This Heaven is real. Jack really is God now. And whatever’s keeping you from going back to Earth and visiting those boys... I say to Hell with it. Have they ever not welcomed you back from the dead with enthusiasm?
I could only bring us to one of the entrances, it would have been too risky to bring us anywhere else.
CASTIEL
I think I deserve it. My birthday is coming up, after all.
(now more certain)
EILEEN
Thank you.
Come on. She was most likely in the throne room when she first called me, so we should start there.
Jack holds out his hands to Cas and Sam and they each grab his hand as Dean takes Cas’ other hand and Meg takes both Dean and Sam’s hands.
So were we a couple days ago. Your point?
As they approach the scene, Sam holds up the picture to compare it to the scene.
CASTIEL
With shaky breath, Emily carefully pulls back the flap of the tent to peer outside. When she sees nothing, she slowly crawls out of the tent.
How’d you get here? I’ve got the Impala.
GABRIEL
With what?
Rowena moves around her throne to sit in it. While she is able to maintain her regal posture, she is clearly drained from her fight with Bela.
The Empty.
Dr. Lewis leads Sam and Eileen into the room and immediately starts attempting to tidy up.
Don’t you dare leave me like that again.
Dean shuffles for a moment, embarrassed, before he sits down and regains his composure.
DEAN (CONT’D)
And you're sure it'll work fine?
"Hell yes. Any chance I get to see you not eating pie is definitely worth it." Lucifer answered smugly.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
-2musiclover2
Everyone other than Sam flinches at the name, again.
20 EXT. NEW HEAVEN – ROAD – DAY
The... the place. Just... don’t say it, okay?
We were playing frisbee and then this lady came up and asked to join us-- she was hot so of course I said yes-- but then there was this... this black smoke? And after that I don’t remember much. Just really vague memories that I’m not really sure they happened? Because I couldn’t control what was happening.
I like that idea, Dean.
Among the customers, we see a few familiar faces: KEVIN TRAN, VICTOR HENRIKSEN, MAX and ALICIA BARNES, and ANDY GALLAGHER are among a few.
Cas’ eyes return to normal and his wings fade away as Rowena and Bela slowly sit up.
Enough fighting! Both of you! It’s not going to get us anywhere.
CASTIEL
END OF ACT TWO
Cas smiles, slightly embarrassed, and we--
CASTIEL
16 INT. MOTEL ROOM – LATER
13 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER
EILEEN
Before the smoke can get too far away, however, Castiel raises his hand, his eyes glowing bright with grace as he smites the demon from afar, and the smoke dissipates in a flash of bright light.
CASTIEL
Castiel sits alone, an empty whiskey glass in his hand. Jo glances at Cas from down the bar a few times before moving to wipe down the counter next to him.
EILEEN
EILEEN
GABRIEL
(fondly)
Alex, too, perks up when he heard his friend, although he is still not able to stand without the aid of Sam.
We focus the camera briefly on Dean and Cas’ hands as Dean shifts to grab Cas’ hand and wind their fingers together before we focus back on Dean and Cas’ expressions. Dean shudders out a breath, tears apparent in his eyes.
16 INT. ROADHOUSE – MOMENTS LATER
Will you be okay?
Yes! Listen, you have no idea how long I’ve been looking forward to this, okay?
Mind if I join you?
How are you doing, really, after being back?
CASTIEL
Give it back.
EMILY
(through phone)
"Why can't you do it?" Someone called back in a whiny voice.
CASTIEL
So much for a simple case.
MICHAEL
Thanks.
Sam’s phone rings in his pocket and he pulls it out, the display read ‘Dean’ and he answers.
It’s in Washington state.
Yeah. Yeah, it’s gotta be here somewhere.
(a pause)
EILEEN
Sam? What is it? Is Alex okay?
Dean trails off. This conversation is quickly heading in a direction he never thought it could lead, and his emotions are starting to get to him. We can see that he’s on the verge of tears now, the memories of Cas’ death too much for him.
Jo and Ash exchange a look and we CUT TO--
(a pause)
Yeah, I’ll come. Did you want to meet there, or...?
I’m an immortal demon, I’ve got all the time in the world.
Ash looks Cas up and down.
(suddenly pensive)
It’s been... talking to me. In my head. So, I went to go see what it wanted and it attacked me.
The campers are too busy laughing to notice a rustling in the bushes off in the distance. We ZOOM IN on the bushes as they shake.
CASTIEL
What’s so funny?
Please, if you enjoyed this, show me your support by leaving kudos and let me know your thoughts in the comments!! I reply to all comments and enjoy reading them! Also, if you want to head on over to my tumblr (my main is 2musiclover2 and my side for this project is spnseason16) you can send me a message or an ask to talk to me about this project!! I'm also still taking ideas for filler episodes, so if you have a certain monster, character, or plot you would like to see, just let me know!
Dean does as asked before he offers the bottle to Sam who shakes his head in denial.
As Dean enters the library, the bunker lights turn on to reveal his friends and family-- Sam, CASTIEL, JACK, Eileen, MEG, GABRIEL, BALTHAZAR, ADAM, GARTH, BESS, CHARLIE, STEVIE, JODIE, DONNA, CLAIRE, KAIA, ALEX, and PATIENCE-- and on the center of the table: a Rice Krispy treat on a platter, two candles shaped like the number 42 burning in the center.
5  INT. MEN OF LETTERS – SAM’S ROOM – DAY
Oh, so this is the famous Cas? Lemme tell you, Dean has barely been able to shut up about you all day. Don’t worry, though, it’s all good things, I promise.
DEAN (CONT’D)
How often does he pray to you?
Maybe our ghost wasn’t a recent death.
Cas steps in front of Dean.
I just... I remember talking to people, making some kind of deal. And to seal the deal I had to kiss them? I don’t know, it was weird, man. How is this gonna help you find Jamie? I need to find him, or his girlfriend will kill me.
9  EXT. EILEEN’S HOUSE – FRONT PORCH – CONTINUOUS
Some college kids went on a camping trip and ended up with their hearts ripped out. Only one survivor.
(through his laughter)
So, I was thinking we should look for a case today. I know we’ve defeated Chuck and all, but that doesn’t mean the monsters have stopped.
Shut up, you did not! You were just as scared as I was!
On the other side of the clearing, Emily steps through the trees.
I don’t think it would be the best idea. If you want to talk to him, then okay, but I suggest you give him time, first.
No. That was drastically untrue.
What brings you here, Sam? The last time I heard from you, you seemed worried that something bad was happening and you told me to stay put, then nothing.
Aw, babe, don't be like that! You know Wes just likes to tease!
Dean jokingly sticks his tongue out at Tommi as he finishes dealing the cards.
Jack smiles at the crowd.
CUT back to Jack as he gives Castiel one of his signature smiles.
EILEEN
EMILY/GERTRUDE
Yeah, um, Sam, how about you go take Jack back to the bunker? I wanna, um. I wanna talk with Cas about something.
I didn’t-- I love Wes! And Reese and Nate are two of my best friends. I could never hurt them.
Please, Jack. We only want you to stay safe.
It’s good to have you back.
"Ooh, what do you think Chuck will say about that?" The man said, laughing a little.
16 EXT. HIGHWAY – DAY
(suddenly drained)
I feel so conflicted, now, though. Because nothing will change the fact that I did live that life. I did have a wife and a kid, and now I can’t even remember what my wife looked like and I’ll never have that kid. Sure, I might have a kid, but I’m terrified that I’ll always compare them to the kid that I had in another life. I don’t know how to just go about living in this life, in this world, when I still remember that other life that I had. I wanted to take this hunt because I thought it might help me get past that, but it’s not. I just-- I don’t know what to do.
After a few years, sure.
Emily Richards? I’m Sam Rose and this is my partner Eileen McKagan--
12 INT. POLICE STATION – HOLDING CELLS – LATER
"Oh, no. You have no reason to worry. It's my lovely younger brother and his boyfriend who need to worry. Just don't eat the fries and you'll be fine. I would never do anything to your food." Lucifer said so only Charlie could hear.
Yeah, I’m all good. You?
What kind of deal?
JUMP CUT. Billie enters the room along with the Empty, which swallows both Billie and Castiel, leaving Dean all alone.
"Ew." Dean gagged. "Remind me to never again trust Lucifer with my food."
Moments later, a frazzled looking woman emerges from a door to the side of the reception desk-- DR. LEWIS.
Rowena takes a moment to catch her breath before she sits up again and thrusts a hand out at Bela, lightning shooting from the tips of her fingers to electrocute the demon.
Hey, uh, does someone with supernatural abilities wanna bust these open for me?
Emily easily settles into the extra-large sleeping bag, curling up on her side and sighing softly as she falls back asleep.
WESLEY
I also love to hear what you liked about each chapter/episode, so please let me know your thoughts! You can either leave a comment here or head on over to tumblr to send me a message or and ask there!
"Dean! Cass! Where have you been? No one could find you all day!" A voice called as Dean, Castiel, and Charlie walked out of the school together at the end of the day.
GABRIEL
Sam nods then turns to Eileen.
MICHAEL
SUPERNATURAL
(she starts crying)
But Chuck, he--
SAM (CONT’D)
(pained)
Sam pauses in his packing to look at Eileen.
Meg laughs.
Happy birthday, Dean!
Sam cuts himself off as a little girl’s giggles resound around the clearing.
Could you be any dumber? That man is lost without you, Castiel. He’s walking around right now as a shell of what he was before. Anything you’ve seen that made you think he is happier without you-- the man still hasn’t washed the shirt he was wearing when you died. He even sleeps with it. You tell me if that sounds like Dean is happy without you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go let a certain Winchester know that I’m alive-- and I suggest that you do the same.
Thank you for helping.
(into phone)
Instead of Sam replying, Meg cuts in-- everyone's focus is no on Dean.
Yeah? What’s that?
What do you-- Chuck used to bring back angels all the time? He brought me back several times.
Dean continues reading and Cas moves to stand over his shoulder. We see Cas read a small portion of the article before he smiles.
EILEEN
I gotta make sure that however this plays out, I come out on top. Whether it’s Bela or Rowena that wins, I want to make sure I’m on the winning side.
The Impala drives down the long stretch of road, miles of forests on either side.
11 INT. THE EMPTY – FLASHBACK
Miracle only wags his tail at Sam.
CASTIEL
Dean smiles at Jack, who grins right back with a smile that wouldn’t be out of place on Cas’ face.
I’m not Sad Sam. I’m just...
BLACKOUT.
I’ll go talk to him.
ACT TWO
EILEEN
Emily makes quick work of picking up the beer cans and putting them in a trash bag. She ties up the bag and leans it against the side of Nathan and Reese’s tent before she crawls inside.
She hung up on me.
No. No, Heaven is taking a hands-off approach with the souls on Earth this time.
TOMMI
Dean sits up again and slides out of bed.
Castiel begins to build up his courage to go see Dean when--
Cas takes a sip of his beer, struggling to find the words before he finally answers.
Wow, I didn’t notice, Sam.
19 EXT. VAMP BARN – NIGHT
It only took so long because you were both dealing with other problems at the time.
What’s wrong? Who’s Jack?
You weren’t yourselves after you defeated Chuck, and I wanted to know why. So, I did some research, and I studied both of you, and I figured out why: Chuck had left a very small portion of his power in each of you. Not enough to be detectable by any angel or otherwise supernatural being if they weren’t looking for it, but enough that he could control bits and pieces of your thoughts and actions. There were some points where you started to break out of his control, but for the most part you were still being controlled by Chuck even after you defeated him.
Yeah, well, I’m a different person, Sammy.
EILEEN
She's not our werewolf. That bracelet and the beads are pure silver.
CASTIEL
Did you hear them?
CASTIEL
Sam holds his phone to his chest as he steps out of Eileen’s bedroom, closing the door behind him. As he shuts it, we catch a glimpse of Eileen, still asleep in the bed.
Okay. So, you get anything with a new search?
Full moon is about now, so, werewolf. Milk run for you.
The Impala remains parked along the side of the road. Dean and Castiel stand together, leaning against the side of the car. They stand close enough together that their shoulders touch, but they don't touch other than that.
The archangels, Jack, and Dean all look at each other with worry as we--
(Cas flinches)
Hey, Sam. What’s up?
"Um, uh, um... I'll tell you later." Cass blushed even more.
17 EXT. FOREST – NIGHT
Yes. Thank you.
As some of you may know and others probably not, Chuck is no longer God. He was corrupt, and only cared about making the world interesting for him to watch. So, with the help of Sam and Dean Winchester, as well as many others that we will be forever grateful for, Jack has taken Chuck’s place as God and now holds the power of both Chuck and his sister Amara.
Well, don’t just stand there, come on in and have a beer.
All three victims were found hanged. It wasn’t a quick death. My guess is that while they were hanging there suffocating, the murderer cut their hearts out. That’s the part that ultimately killed them.
"The Angel of Death"
The pier is nice, quiet-- as quiet as a popular tourist spot can be.
Despite his initial shock, Dean relaxes as he pulls the Impala over to the shoulder, glancing at Castiel in the passenger’s seat as he does so. Once the Impala is parked, however, Dean turns to Cas and pulls him into a crushing hug.
REESE (O.S.)
21 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS
Castiel gently pushes Dean out of the hug so he can look at him. Dean rests their foreheads together instead, wanting nothing more than to be close to Castiel in this moment.
GABRIEL
Castiel strolls through the hallway, a tearful but otherwise happy expression on his face as he follows the sounds of SAM and Dean’s voices coming from the kitchen.
"I didn't put dog shit in your fries if that's what you think. You should know by now that I never repeat something." Lucifer chuckled.
What are you thinking?
Chuck had the wrong ideas of what Heaven was meant to be. There shouldn’t be... so much separation and-- spending eternity away from everyone else isn’t my idea of happiness. It’s just so lonely and-- it feels so controlled here.
I mean, like, whoever killed those people never even attempted to stop us from burning the tree. Doesn’t that seem weird to you?
I died.
You mean he planned to go out like that?
A short awkward moment ensues where they both wait for the other’s cue to sit. It is Eileen who sits first, breaking some of the awkward atmosphere when Sam follows suit.
(defeated)
7  EXT. NEW HEAVEN – MOUNTAINSIDE – DAY
When everyone finishes grabbing their weapons, Sam looks expectantly at the group.
CASTIEL
Not sure yet. I’m not scheduled for the next few days, so I’ll probably just spend it with the family.
The demon smirks.
(without looking up)
(without looking up)
CUT TO--
Gabriel sighs before he SNAPS, causing a lollipop to appear in his hand which he sticks in his mouth as we CUT TO--
"Yeah! It'll be so much fun!" Cass added.
Emily seems to be doing okay. As okay as is reasonable, considering, at least.
When they make it to the door of Castiel's room, there is a faint groan from inside as Cas knocks on it, and he opens the door to see Meg laying on his bed, still in pain.
EILEEN
(into phone)
Episode #1602
END OF ACT TWO
Gabriel smirks and Castiel starts to panic a little at the thought of Gabriel being given free reign over helping to redesign heaven.
Business here in Hell is a little slow. It’s at a standstill actually.
With that, Balthazar disappears.
"Um... I guess." Charlie replied, suddenly feeling extremely uncomfortable. Why did all of the guys have to flirt with her? Was it not obvious that she didn't swing that way?
I wasn’t supposed to come back this time. It was supposed to be the end. But then Jack-- he became God and he-- he brought us all back. The good angels, at least. Or-- those of us who weren’t too attached to Chuck.
"See you! Anna, Hannah, let's go!" Cass called his two sisters before he went off to get in his own car and drove off.
4  INT. MEN OF LETTERS – KITCHEN – MOMENTS LATER
So, what do we do now? Jack, did you kill her?
BELA (CONT’D)
Sam, Dean, Cas, Meg, and Jack all appear in a long, dark hallway, empty except for the four of them, and only lit by the torches on the walls.
The demon leaves Alex’s body in a cloud of smoke through his mouth, and Alex stumbles as soon as the smoke is completely out, but Eileen is quick to catch him.
WESLEY
I don’t know her as well as you, I’m not the one who met her as a human, on the rack, and as a demon.
-2MusicLover2
(groaning)
You didn’t look for Eileen?
4  INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CASTIEL’S ROOM – MOMENTS LATER
Does it say what happened to their bodies?
ELLEN
Well, in short, I had a lot of time to do some research while I was waiting for Sam to die so I could reunite the two of you.
CUT TO--
Thank you, Dean.
GABRIEL (CONT’D)
To be fair, I had just spent forty years in Hell and was trying to keep myself awake.
Lucifer quickly started knocking on the door and was immediately greeted with Cass shouting for him to come in.
1  EXT. FOREST – CAMP - NIGHT
JACK (CONT’D)
No. They’ve got him.
CASTIEL
CASTIEL
Jack. If they could be here.
Sam smiles with relief at this.
I don’t recall this conversation being about me, anyways.
What do you mean, “there hasn’t been any”? Never mind. I’ll take care of this myself, just like I do everything else.
Dean sighs as he exchanges a look with Sam.
"Don't interrupt me, assbutt!" Cass said. Dean just sighed before motioning for Cass to continue. "As I was saying. Everything was quite enjoyable and then I get a text from Dean telling me to go to the library."
Before any of them have time to ask any questions, however, the demon dies in a flash and Alex's body crumples to the ground.
Dean is the first to speak-- he’s not happy that it seems Bela is going to ruin his birthday, but he’s going to stop whatever she is planning either way.
EMILY
You made a deal with a demon to gank your parents!
(sarcastically)
Oh, Dean's gonna kill me.
I’d forgiven you, Cas. I’ll always forgive you.
MICHAEL
Nope. I’m okay. I’m also okay if we maybe don’t tell Mae about this one? It was traumatizing enough to live it once; I don’t need to relive it when she starts questioning me about it.
It wouldn’t matter either way-- Dean’s wish was already true as soon as he saw his friends and family-- but he isn’t about to tell the kid that.
EILEEN
Sam pauses again.
And... I guess you can take the Impala. But if you scratch her or get werewolf guts on her, I swear to... Jack?
(cheery, maybe forcefully so)
"Hm... I kinda wanna meet this Cass guy now. Could we do that?" Charlie asked. When Dean had mentioned Cass she noticed there was a certain sparkle in his eyes. She already shipped them and she hadn't even met one of them!
BALTHAZAR
I don’t know what to tell you, Sammy. Not that much time has passed, really.
(cautious)
You don’t-- why don’t you seem happy? Did I do something wrong?
GABRIEL
(a beat)
JAMIE
ROWENA
So, you and him--
Can you use angel radio to contact Clarence? Or is that not in your wheelhouse as mini-God?
Dean finishes skimming through the pages and tosses it on the table in front of him.
No such luck, the doors don’t budge.
"Can I finish the story? I want to finish the story." Dean said.
She’s not a demon, though. Bela’s human. Dead human, but human.
BLACKOUT.
8  INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CASTIEL’S ROOM – DAY
Focus on Castiel’s thoughtful and slightly forlorn expression as we CUT TO--
No, see, I’ve decided that now that I have what I’ve wanted for literal years I’m just going to give up on that.
Eileen is patient as Sam takes a breath and regathers his thoughts.
Sam and Dean turn around and we CUT to see GABRIEL standing next to the Impala, a feigned expression of hurt on his face before he breaks into a grin.
Yep. Look.
What? I just think it’s about time this place has seen some new management, don’t you?
CASTIEL
MICHAEL
BOBBY
"It's too early for this." She groaned, sitting up and glancing at the clock which read 6:00am.
I win.
GABRIEL
It doesn’t take long before Emily finds the crime scene tape around the campsite her and her friends had set up. Nothing is out of place-- the beer cans still litter the ground, the tents are still pitched, and the coolers are still closed next to the campfire.
Never do that to me again, you hear? I can’t lose you again. ‘Cause I may have seemed okay on the outside... but, Cas, I’m a mess when you’re gone. You said--
It looks like it, yeah.
CASTIEL
"Thanks, Becky." Dean said and both Dean and Cass stood up, put their dishes in the dishwasher, and went back upstairs to Cassie's room.
When I called you, however, one of Bela’s supporters tried to shoot me with this.
(a beat)
Hey, um, Alex, right? Alex, it’s going to be okay, yeah? I’m just going to need you to tell me what happened, and then we can find your friend.
Sam raises his eyebrows at Cas and Dean stands up straight again to look at Sam expectantly.
We’ve got two not-so-small problems on our hands at the moment. What are we going to do?
Sam exchanges a look with Eileen before he holds out a hand to Dr. Lewis.
Kudos are always appreciated, and I am so thankful for all of them! I also reply to all comments, so be sure to leave your thoughts either in the comments here, or you can send me an ask or a message on tumblr!
People should be free to travel wherever they wish and be with whomever they wish. No more individual Heavens where everyone just relives their favorite memories. I want everyone to be together, free to do as they please.
The brothers enter the library. They stop next to the table where Dean waits for Sam to continue speaking, and when it’s clear he’s not going to continue, he rolls his eyes.
Um. Would you like to come in?
Did you get ahold of Rowena?
Sam seems a little embarrassed by this.
Dean shakes his head and takes another sip of his coffee.
CASTIEL
Jack starts walking away from Castiel, but the angel grabs Jack's arm to stop him.
Sam smiles and laughs as Dean presses play on the movie, and on that image, we--
7  INT. MEN OF LETTERS – LIBRARY – CONTINUOUS
Dean finally looks at Sam, although he looks skeptical, and Sam breaks.
Eileen nods-- always composed in the direst of situations.
So, all we know is she’s making demon deals at Santa Monica Beach and she’s not leaving. Wow. That’s such helpful information.
ROWENA
I didn’t wanna die, Sam. Chuck took that away from me, and now that I know that... I’m terrified. Because I don’t know what else he took away from me-- what other choices I wasn’t able to make. And I’m glad that you don’t know what that is like, Sam, I am, but part of me also wishes that he took choices away from you, too, so you could understand what I’m going through right now.
I haven't been an agent of Hell in years. I go where the kid goes.
"Fine." Cass said, sounding angry even though he was grinning.
Bela glares at Dean and his eyes go wide-- she’s choking him.
Lucifer thought.
Oh! I'm so sorry! Stupid thing is always coming undone. Could you get those for me?
We ZOOM IN on the phone, where the notification is still displayed, showing one message from Sam Winchester reading: “I’m here”.
19 INT. HELL – THRONE ROOM – DAY
(angry)
Sam stands nervously on the porch, hands fiddling with his phone as he looks around him when Eileen suddenly opens the door.
It’s okay, we can find him. Would you be able to track the number?
CASTIEL
CASTIEL
He slowly moves closer to the doors-- Cas, Sam, and Meg follow closely while Jack lags behind-- and once he is within reach, Dean attempts to open the doors.
This time, Dean walks into the room to meet Sam at the bottom of the steps.
"Okay, so I went to the library with the new girl Charlie because she wanted to meet Cass after I mentioned him. I texted Cass to meet us there which he did, and that's where we spent the rest of the day. Other than when we went and got food real quick, but we went back to the library after that. Anyways, the takeaway of this story is that I had permission to skip school for the day to show Charlie around and help her get used to the place, but Cass didn't and yet he still skipped class, so he broke the rules." Dean said, a triumphant look on his face as he finished.
So, what’s our plan, then?
Dean must have left in a hurry, then.
EILEEN
PAN following Jack as he walks over to the control board and reaches out to touch the master switch. CUT TO Castiel, looking on from just inside the doorway with apprehension.
"Oh come on! He's my best friend! Stop trying to steal him!" Castiel screamed.
Gabriel crosses his arms and acts offended.
Sam chuckles and glances down, but Eileen just looks at him to continue.
Dean starts and glances up at Sam before looking back down and starting to butter his toast.
TOMMI
ACT FOUR
Come on, we have to get you out of here. It’s not safe.
"Ugh. Way to put the ass in Cass." Dean mumbled.
"Michael said you wouldn't date Charlie if she was straight because... um... youwantedtodateme." Cass said.
Nothing. I was just thinking about the first time we were in a park together.
Of course. It’s my job.
9  INT. CORONER’S OFFICE – AUTOPSY ROOM – CONTINUOUS
You changed the course of history because you didn’t like the movie “Titanic”.
So? He said he was taking a hands-off approach.
CASTIEL
Sounds like quite the birthday you had, there. Are they all that exciting?
PAN from Bobby to Castiel where we see that Jack is now standing behind his shoulder. He may not have been here for the entire conversation, but he knows what is going on.
Castiel hesitates, unsure of where exactly Dean is going with this and why it even matters.
(he struggles to say it)
11 INT. THE EMPTY – DAY
EMILY
CUT TO--
CASTIEL
Thank you. I love it.
Alex does as Sam asks and puts his contact info in Sam’s phone, then flops back down to lay in the sand.
I healed her and sent her to the Bunker. She’ll be safe there. But, Jack, what happened? What did Meg save you from?
MICHAEL
"Well, we didn't actually go to class, we just sat in the library all day talking, so pretty great." Dean answered.
We gotta keep moving. Meg, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but how about you stay behind Jack, watch out for him.
(confused)
Wait, if Sam is supposed to be the one to talk to me, then why are you here?
Dean looks up at Sam as he says his name, trying to picture the little boy that was “Sammy” instead of “Sam”. He knows it won’t help, but using the nickname almost lets him trick himself into believing nothing has changed.
Yes, and I didn’t listen. Anyways, Cassie, you never did tell me whatever it was that you said you needed to.
Sam glances at Eileen out of the corner of his eye, confused. What rope? And then he sees it, too.
"Shit, Cass! I'm coming!"
(laughing)
She saved me. Someone, please, help her.
God, who knew dying could be so emotional?
What do you mean?
The two stand in companionable silence for a moment before Castiel turns to face Dean.
(struggling to word his question)
Thought it would be easy, did you? Getting rid of me?
Look, it’s in the past, okay? Or-- a different past. I’m doing different now.
The couple arrives at an outdoor table in front of a small burger joint on the pier. Sam, Eileen, Jack, and Meg are all waiting around the table with food for them, Dean, and Cas.
Stick with us, Jack, but please, stay out of the way of any fights. I don’t want you hurt.
I don't know, I just got here a few minutes ago. I was looking for you. Where were you, by the way.
ACT FIVE
Sam sits on the edge of the bed, changing the bandages of the stab wound on his chest.
Castiel spins the cap of his beer bottle, clearly lost in thought.
Jack looks sadly at Castiel, contemplating just how much this death has changed his father figure.
Right.
JUMP CUT. Castiel throws Dean to the ground.
Where does it say they were killed?
Why can't you just come with me?
The four odd family members look up, and Meg and Cas instantly scowl as Jack frowns.
Eileen shakes her head.
3  INT. MEN OF LETTERS — CASTIEL’S ROOM – DAY
Of course, Cassie! You can talk to your big bro about anything!
Castiel leaves the bunker with a whoosh of his wings and we focus on Dean’s face, pained and conflicted... the inner turmoil breaking through as we CUT TO--
First, I have removed the walls between heavens. Heaven shouldn’t be a separate place for everyone, people should all be able to visit each other as they wish.
Oh, Mae is gonna kill me... 'don't lose him, Alex'... 'nothing good ever happens when he's with you, Alex'... I swear it's not me making this happen!
This episode is where the warning for graphic depictions of violence will really start to come into play. If you don't want to read about that but still want to continue with this series, I can send you a pdf with a summary of the parts with gore/violence and the other parts written out as is! Stay safe, everyone!
It was... weird. I was just playing frisbee with-- where did Jamie go?
I need to find Meg.
You’ve been back for a week? And you didn’t...
I get it. So, how long do you think you’ll be gone?
Sam moves the phone away from his mouth to address Eileen.
"Ahh! There's the Luci we all know and love!" Dean smirked and Castiel smacked him upside the head as Lucifer glared at them.
Smart? Funny? Good-looking?
Got it. We’ll be there in a few.
Cas, Meg, and Dean all exchange confused looks-- that doesn't sound right. Rowena would have called them if she needed help again.
POLICE OFFICER
Dean makes a mocking face at Meg, to which she sticks her tongue out at him.
Oh, so nice of you to include me in this. You know, after I sacrificed myself to help you.
Uh, maybe it was just misplaced? It’s gotta be around here somewhere. Besides, I think my partner and I can make do with just what we have here.
(struggles to find the words)
Dean, Charlie, and Stevie all start laughing even harder at the story. After a beat, they calm down and Stevie leans closer to Dean to talk to him.
The autopsy room is a mess. On the table lays the body of Reese Carney, already stitched back together. Reports cover the desk and coroner’s tools lay all over the desk and table.
Jack looks a little sheepish for a moment.
Why did you wait until I was here to let me know that you’re okay, that you got out of that place?
No faith in me, whatsoever.
Sam nods, gratefully.
The camera follows loosely behind the mismatched family as they walk along the beach to start relaxing again.
Where else could he be?
"True." Cass said then Lucifer came back with their food.
Sam raises his eyebrows at Dean. Is it going to be like this from now on? What was the tipping point? Was it Sam living without Dean? Or was it when Dean and Cas became DeanandCas?
What did you want to talk to me about, Dean? I imagine it didn’t have anything to do with the history of our meetings in parks.
(slightly louder)
Rowena plucks the floating bullet out of the air and inspects it. Carved into the bullet is a Devil’s Trap.
When I was done in Heaven I couldn’t find you, but Gabriel, uh... left a note.
REESE
Sam nods resolutely.
Madeline picks up Dean’s card to reveal-- a seven.
Have you tried going to see him? I’m sure he’d be thrilled to see you.
EILEEN
Following Sam and Dean-- mostly Dean, really-- around the Bunker and to Ohio, without even letting them know you’re back amongst the living? Honestly, I didn’t really think you had it in you.
Cas quickly moves to help Dean up, and he leans into Cas as he continues to hold his stomach with a grimace.
CASTIEL
"Lucifer! What the hell did you do to my fries, you ass?" Castiel shouted at his brother. Dean was gulping down his milkshake, trying to get rid of the taste.
I'm fine. She needs to get out of here.
It does like its peace and quiet.
(a beat)
Dean smirks as he waves to the cards.
As they get closer to the throne room, the bodies become more and more frequent until they make it to the closed doors of the throne room and see a pile of bodies lying outside.
Dean frowns at his phone as he pulls it away from his ear and turns it off.
No, I can drive us both. No point in driving so far separately.
You can’t tell me I was the only one who thought something was a little odd about Deano’s death!
EILEEN
"Whatever, jerk. Let's just go pick up Adam so we can get to The Roadhouse. Kevin and Jess are riding with us." Sam replied, getting into the backseat of the Impala and motioning for the Asian boy and the blonde girl to get in with him.
"I know right?" Charlie fangirled quietly, glad to find someone who agreed. Lucifer only smiled at the three of them before he turned and walked off again.
"And yet you still live in my house." Becky replied, although by now she was laughing too.
21 INT. TENT – CONTINUOUS
ACT ONE
We PAN along the arm up to the woman’s face to see-- BELA TALBOT.
On top of the pier, above where Alex stands, Cas steps into view and Sam smiles.
Well, do you have anything else?
TO BE CONTINUED...
I’ve told you to stop calling me that.
19 EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH – DAY
It’s not really a question.
CASTIEL
CASTIEL
DEAN (CONT’D)
I’m glad you’re here, you know that? Because I am. I’ve said it before: I’d rather have you, and knowing that you--
No, it--
Are you sure, because--
CASTIEL
They’ll all be okay, though. We’ll help them when the time comes.
SAM (CONT’D)
Dean chuckles.
Yep. All strung up with the same rope, too.
JACK (CONT’D)
CASTIEL
Dean? Cas? Jack? Meg? Anyone home?
My throne.
Yes and no. You see, in my research, I found out that Chuck had visited a Miss Becky Rosen and while he was visiting her... he wrote one last Supernatural book: The End. I managed to get my hands on it and lo and behold, he had written the ending that you lot suffered through. Everyone dear to Sam and Dean got poofed away... Cas confessed his gay love and was immediately sent to the Empty... Sam and Dean save the day with the help of little Jack who now has to run the universe at the ripe old age of three... Dean died in a tragic hunting accident... Sam was left all alone to live an apple pie life that he didn’t really want-- I printed out a copy if you want to read it.
27 INT. MEN OF LETTERS - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER
BOBBY
Sam? What is it? Is Alex okay?
EILEEN
I know you’re here, Michael. You don’t have to hide from me.
Dean and Cas sit on a bench, Jamie in between them, his arms wrapped around himself.
Our son is God.
Well, f--
Haven't you heard? Rowena isn't Queen anymore.
Eileen takes another moment to process this.
Castiel becomes furious and starts to move towards Bela, but Jack is quicker.
Dude, I am not talking about this with you.
3  EXT. FOREST – CAMP – EARLY MORNING
"Just because we call Chuck God doesn't mean you're an angel." Dean grumbled, sitting on the arm of the chair.
Are you okay, Sam? It’s not like you to miss something like that.
Emily, you shouldn’t be here. You need to leave.
But you heard my prayers, didn’t you? If not before you were brought back, then you heard them once Jack got you out, right?
CASTIEL
Our celestial beings come to a halt outside of an unmarked door and Jack turns to face Castiel.
"So, is this Charlie? I'm Castiel Novak." Castiel finally said, looking at the redhead who was still giggling.
CUT TO--
Dean grins at Cas before pulling him into another hug.
CASTIEL
Dean’s eyes widen and he hurries to finish removing his gear.
Sam’s face drops as the person on the other line answers and he realizes it’s not Alex.
WIDER. Dean sighs as he lays back down. Miracle trots over to sit by his bedside and Dean reaches down to pet behind his ear.
2MusicLover2
CASTIEL
Hey. We have an actual problem on our hands at the moment.
Meg. The real Meg.
CASTIEL
(shouts)
Hey, don’t sweat it, kid. You did good. Saved us, didn’t you?
Crap.
14 INT. POLICE STATION – LOBBY – MOMENTS LATER
BELA (CONT’D)
SAM (CONT’D)
Castiel looks up. Tears are visible in his eyes and on his face, but he does not wipe them away. ZOOM OUT to see JACK standing over Castiel, smiling down at the angel.
EILEEN
"Probably." Dean grinned. "Hey, let's play some Call of Duty: Zombies!"
Sam jogs through the forest, Eileen at his heels, until they break through the trees into the clearing and their eyes fall on the tree standing in the middle, looking untouched.
(strained and punctuated by sobs)
Jo is about to respond when Ash bursts into the bar carrying his computer.
Jack frowns slightly.
As much as I admit planning to kill a bitch is fun, we have to actually find her first.
(sensing Sam’s nerves)
From the other side of the doors, we can hear the faint sounds of Bela and Rowena fighting.
10 INT. IMPALA – CONTINUOUS
Does that mean-- Jack, are you God?
Jack shrugs.
This episode takes place at the same time as 15x20, just from Jack and Cas' perspectives instead of Sam and Dean.
Thank you.
Jack gives Dean a weak smile.
We’re going to the beach?
(confused)
Cas? You’ll tell me, won’t you?
"Yeah. She runs the kitchen with help from her best friend and my aunt, Ellen."
23 EXT. NEW HEAVEN – LAKE – DAY
"You can't ground me, I'm 21 years old!" Gabriel said. Anna tried hiding her laughter by drinking some of her milk, but she just ended up spilling it all down her front.
"Why don't they want people to know?"
You’re one to talk. I seem to remember you refusing to stop hunting the first time you came back.
The scene he saw was definitely not what he was expecting. Dean and Cass were standing in the middle of the room with xBox controllers in their hands, playing Call of Duty: Zombies. Cassie's character was surrounded by about 20 zombies as he laid on the ground dying. Dean was frantically pushing buttons trying to save him, but it wasn't doing much good. The game ended about 10 seconds later and showed they had made it to round 42.
Dean puts a finger to his lips as he looks back at the rest of the group and raises his angel blade.
I got something!
EILEEN
Dean rolls his eyes, overexaggerating a good mood-- he can’t let Sam know something is up.
CASTIEL
Shut up.
"Who's Cass?"
Heaven’s almost finished, they’ve all got it under control up there. I’ve just come to do the same as you.
Dean, it’s Jack.
REESE
(into phone)
You must be Dr. Lewis. I’m Sam Rose and this is my partner Eileen McKagan. We’re state police, here about those campers that were killed over the weekend.
I heard you. He’s in his room, in the back. There’s a sign on the door, you can’t miss it.
ZOOM OUT to see the Empty, now in the form of MEG MASTERS.
Yellow crime scene tape wraps around the trees surrounding a group of POLICE OFFICERS, GAME WARDENS, PARAMEDICS, and HIKERS. Sam and Eileen walk into view, cross the tape, and join the group, flashing their badges and ID's.
What are you talking about?
"About 7 years ago, but what does that have to do with anything?" Castiel replied.
21 INT. IMPALA – CONTINUOUS
Yep. Looks like we might know how to get rid of this ghost.
Yeah. Yeah, no. I think about ‘em, too.
Seem pretty interested in that. What porn site you on?
CUT TO--
I will never begin to understand what you’re going through, but that doesn’t change the fact that I will help you in any way that I can.
No, I know, I just-- I’m sorry, I had a whole thing in my head of what I was going to say, but I just forgot it.
What do you need--
A beat. We see Dean struggling to keep his emotions in a box where he likes to keep them hidden.
Doesn’t matter. You helping us now doesn’t get you anything.
Castiel.
No, we can still have beach day, Dean.
END OF ACT FOUR
Just them, as far as I can tell.
Kids run around the park, playing on the playground equipment as their parents watch on from benches or push them on the swings. In the parking lot sits Baby, Dean sitting in the driver’s seat.
No, come on. I know that face. That’s, uh-- that Sad Sam face.
Dean and Meg give each other a slight glare but remain silent as Eileen continues.
"Hell no! They're always so nosy it's hard to have a private life. Although at least I'm not Cass."
I can’t tell you how long I-- how long I sat there after you-- I just wanted you back, man. It’s all I’ve ever wanted, really, and you...
EILEEN
Dean and Cas walk together around the amusement park and stop near the Ferris wheel. Dean is clearly grumpy.
Part of Sam just wants to do the hunt on his own-- it might help him think through everything he wants to if he is on his own-- but another, stronger part of him wants someone to accompany him, to talk to.
ACT TWO
Dean stands up from the chair and leaves the room, Sam, Cas, Meg, and Jack all looking after him in shock.
"So, Ash. Is there something you need to ask us?" Dean hinted.
(flustered)
Castiel seems shocked by this revelation as the crowd applauds. The loudest to cheer are Gabriel and Balthazar, although Michael also seems happier for Castiel than most.
Yes, Meg. Y'know, the demon?
Look familiar?
Dean smiles into his coffee at that, taking a long drink before he sets the mug down and motions at Sam’s computer.
JUMP CUT. The campers now sleep, leaning against each other around the now low-burning campfire. A breeze blows through the camp and Emily shivers as she wakes up. She looks around as she stretches and then starts to gently shake Wesley awake.
Glad to see someone’s finally come to visit me!
Whew, it has definitely been a while since I last posted, and a lot has happened since then!
EILEEN
"I didn't do anything, my dear little Cassie." Lucifer smirked from behind the bar.
(dismissive)
CASTIEL
"I'm 17, I'm the oldest. My little brother, Sammy, is 14 and Adam is 11." Dean said. "Do you have any siblings?"
CASTIEL
Well, I dunno what to tell you, Sam. There’s not much else we can do.
Dean grins at Sam-- a little too brightly to be considered a true smile-- as he finishes his coffee and stands up.
ACT ONE
Sam looks up at Eileen.
Cas reaches over and gently touches two fingers to Meg's forehead. CLOSE UP on Castiel as his eyes glow bright blue for a moment. When the glow fades, we CUT TO a full shot to see that Meg is no longer there.
Sam? What’s wrong?
Oh, like you’ve never thought about doing the same. I did what I had to. And in return, I got turned into this.
I don’t know what you mean.
Shut up.
18 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – DEAN’S ROOM – LATER
And she hasn’t--
"Plus he's saving himself for Cass." Michael mumbled. "Right, Dean?" He said louder so Dean could hear him.
You'll be back soon, won't you?
CASTIEL (PRE-LAP)
ZOOM OUT to view the full scene. In between the two men stands Bela, easily the best dressed on the beach and looking slightly out of place and intimidating in a black sundress, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat.
So, your solution is to just ignore everything?
Back from the dead with a little help from archangel Gabriel, Sam and Dean try to find their place in this new chance at life they have been given. Meanwhile, the archangels are on a mission to find the missing Jack.
The Empty sighs.
CUT TO--
(See the end of the chapter for
Why do you want to come? And tell the truth, or I’ll send you right back to where you came from.
1  INT. THE EMPTY – DAY
Ash studies Cas for another long moment.
Bela smirks and removes her sunglasses as she looks around at the crowded beach.
She moves over to Reese’s body and points out the bruising on his neck.
EILEEN
You’re not mad?
And on the angry and horrified faces of our heroes, we--
CASTIEL
BLACKOUT.
(regretfully, somewhat fearful)
CUT TO--
"I thought you already knew that." Castiel said.
I understand. Chuck was controlling you, it’s okay, I understand. The important thing is that you’re here now. You’ve come to explain it all and that’s what matters.
"But Chuck! They're perfect for each other!" Becky yelled back, whining slightly.
I say we just start this little meeting without him. Get this over with-- I've got things I’d like to do, you know?
We pause for a moment as we wait for Cas to arrive at the porch, where he stands somewhat awkwardly.
11 INT. IMPALA – CONTINUOUS
DEMON
"Hi there! How may I help you?" The cheery old woman at the front desk asked Charlie as she stepped through the doorway.
Michael finally stops messing with Dean’s things and turns his full attention to Cas.
What, you don’t trust me here by myself?
They were hanged?
Dean, please don’t joke about that.
13 INT. HELL – THRONE ROOM – DAY
For your birthday, since we have never really done anything before, and we figured now is a good of time as any, we’re taking a trip to the beach.
always had friends come over after school.
Yes, but I let her get away. I’m sorry.
EILEEN
Would you stop saying that?
Dean sighs.
Sam turns to Eileen and smiles, although his nervousness is still apparent.
What did Rowena say again?
INTERCUT WITH:
DEAN (CONT’D)
We don’t get breaks in this line of work, you know that.
Castiel sits on Dean’s bed holding the jacket with his bloody handprint. Miracle bounds into the room and hops onto the bed and puts his head in Castiel’s lap. Castiel pets Miracle as he looks around the room, his attention focusing on the job contract on Dean’s desk.
Dean remains silent as Cas sits next to him on the bench, not leaving any space between them. Dean waits until Sam passes them again, this time with Jack as they head to the parking lot. Once Sam and Jack are gone, a smile small crosses Dean’s face and he lets out a small laugh.
I don’t recall anything funny about that moment.
(remorseful)
Alex takes a moment to breath as Sam keeps the rest of the group from crowding him too much.
Sam stops rambling and focuses his attention on Eileen.
DEAN (V.O.)
CASTIEL
CASTIEL
"That again? They need to get new hobbies other than wishing we were together." Dean rolled his eyes.
No, she just moved them.
"You have too! You just saw him this morning! I haven't seen him in five days!" Raphael yelled.
We’d like to talk with you about Wes and your other friends, if that’s okay?
CLOSE UP on Jack, who is now bloodied, still on his knees. A fist connects with his temple and he gets knocked to the side, holding himself up with his forearm.
Bela’s still out there. She got away.
"That's fine, Luci. But may I please be excused?" Cass turned to Becky and Chuck.
I knew it was going to happen eventually, but we were in danger and it was the only thing I could think of to save him. And when I died-- there was so much going on. Everyone in-- all of the angels and demons who have ever died are awake. It was worse than Hell, worse than Purgatory. It’s not what I was expecting when I went there, and I never expected that I would get out. I don’t know what’s real anymore and what’s fake. I don’t know if I’m still stuck there and this is all just some cruel joke.
Should I be?
EILEEN
"Neither have I!" Michael also shouted.
Hold up, I’m not letting Jack go with a demon.
Okay, whatever you say, old man.
10 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – DEAN’S ROOM – DAY
Slowly, Jack manages to catch his breath and sit up, with a little help from his archangels.
Dean slowly starts to smile, a child-like joy taking over him at the thought of doing something he’s never been able to do before but had always dreamed of.
No one? You mean you didn’t--
(disgusted)
"Don't even start with me, or I will personally torture your soul when you arrive in hell. Now what do you want?"
What if you think of it differently? Instead of thinking about it as living two different lives, think of this life as a continuation of the other life you lived.
You’re friends with Sam and Dean-- it’s bound to happen a few times.
Kudos are greatly appreciated, they always make me so happy, so if you haven't yet, be sure to leave kudos!
(confused)
Sam frowns at Dean.
We’ve got something in common, you and I. It seems we’ve both fallen for a Winchester boy-- in more ways than one, in your case.
Sam and Cas are still extremely confused by what Gabriel is telling them.
10 EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH – LATER
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
6  INT. CHUCK’S HEAVEN – LATER
Dean glanced at Cass then inspected his burger before he took a bite. Cass waited a few minutes to make sure Dean didn't die and when he didn't, Cass took a bite of his own burger. The three teenagers continued eating their burgers and drinking their milkshakes in silence until Dean and Castiel remembered they had fries. They each took a handful and stuffed them into their mouths, only to cough and splutter, spitting the fries out onto their plates.
You rang?
I have to go back to Heaven soon.
(See the end of the chapter for
Uh, Gabriel, could you maybe help me? I want to... I want to talk to you about something.
We’re going to Hell.
She’s coming back. Eileen, it’s the rope. We need to burn the rope.
How do you know he'll be here so soon, anyways?
END OF ACT ONE
Sam puts the phone back up to his ear to respond.
Sam is too busy thinking back over the case. It’s been so long since he’s hunted, but he doesn’t recall a case ever being as simple as it was. They never even saw the ghost.
I don’t want to put the rope down. I want to play. Mommy never let me play.
Just shut your pie-hole and play.
3  INT. CHUCK'S HEAVEN – MOMENTS LATER
GABRIEL
(confused)
Sam and Dean start fighting the vamps and at first it seems to be going exactly the same as it went the night Dean died. The climactic moment comes as Dean attacks a vampire and it starts pushing him towards the pillar with rebar that had killed Dean previously. This time, Dean is ready, and he turns at the last minute, causing the vampire to get impaled instead.
Eileen puts the bracelet and beads in her pocket before motioning for Sam to talk to her away from Emily's cell.
Dean sits on a park bench, ice cream cone in hand as he watches Jack on the swings, licking his own ice cream cone.
Yeah. At the Ferris wheel. You on your way with Alex?
BLACKOUT.
A pause as neither brother quite knows what to say.
Cas doesn’t know what to say to that-- Dean’s revelation is more than what either of them can handle in this moment. The most Cas can do is offer Dean a weak smile and a gentle hand on his shoulder before he turns to pet Miracle in goodbye.
Sam and Dean are suddenly in the same barn in which Dean died, MACHETES in hand, and they are in the middle of a fight with the very same VAMPIRES from that night.
Dean laughs, but it’s without any humor.
"What? No!" Dean replied, trying to push Michael away from him, but it was no use.
We are back in Eileen’s living room as she and Sam both head over to the couch from the door.
EILEEN
So, the... its...
EILEEN
I sacrificed my life for Dean’s.
5  INT. CHUCK’S HEAVEN – CONTROL ROOM – CONTINUOUS
DEAN (CONT’D)
Jack shakes his head, just as confused as everyone else.
We hold our focus on Dean as he sits in the driver’s seat of Baby, eating a burger and fries as classic rock quietly plays on the radio.
We’ll help them. Guaranteed. But first, we’re gonna need to find Bela. And something tells me she’s going to be even harder to find this time. So, I say, we relax while we can, because things are gonna get real bad, real quick.
Sam, Cas, Jack, and I are going to Hell to help Rowena. She hasn’t called back yet and when I tried calling her, she didn’t pick up.
BLACKOUT.
Jack takes a moment to respond.
As a birthday present for Dean, Team Free Will and friends head to Santa Monica Pier, but not everything goes according to plan. (idea for episode brought to you by @thesnuggliestduckling on tumblr, who asked for a beach episode)
So, Emily must have been possessed, then.
DR. LEWIS
Who told you that one?
9  EXT. PARK – LATER
"Awesome. See you in a bit!" Dean said before he got into the Impala.
Thank you.
Dean hesitates. He doesn’t know how to explain it, and he’s not quite sure that he wants to.
What makes you think I’m helping you because I want something?
What kind of research were you doing?
12 INT. MEN OF LETTERS - HALLWAY – SHOW FOOTAGE – EPISODE 1518
CASTIEL
CASTIEL (CONT’D)
CASTIEL
Dean sits at the table, one hand scrolling through an article on his computer as he reads and the other petting Miracle. Castiel leans against the wall behind Dean, watching him with his arms crossed.
So, you’ve just been here this whole time, then? Waiting?
8  EXT. NEW HEAVEN – BOBBY’S CABIN PORCH – MOMENTS LATER
We PAN around the bench to see Sam walking up to Dean from the parking lot. When he sits down, Dean doesn’t look, but he knows who it is anyways.
It’s not your fault. She’s hard to catch. She’s gotten away from me a few times, too. You don’t need to be sorry.
JACK (O.S.)
Sure enough, Bela was sitting on the edge of the pier right where Meg was pointing, her back turned to them as she spoke to someone next to her.
ROWENA
CASTIEL
Yeah, no. I don’t trust you here, what makes you think I’d trust you to help us out in Hell?
"He doesn't feel like he has a fever. Open your mouth." Michael said holding his finger out in front of Dean's face, causing Cass to start giggling like crazy.
SIRENS BLARE and LIGHTS FLASH around the room and across every computer.
Dean nods, and clumsily signs along as he talks-- he’s still working on his sign language, but he’d be damned if he didn’t figure it out eventually.
(furious)
I’ll hold you to that.
BLACKOUT.
I know. He still... he still prays to me.
I mean, it couldn’t hurt to stop the deals.
That bitch. Next time I see her, I’ll kill her with no hesitation.
Hm? Oh! Yeah, sure that sounds like a plan.
Make a wish!
The group travels down the hall, careful of their surroundings and tensing up every time a shadow flickers in a way that makes it seem demonic.
EILEEN
Perfect.
(under his breath)
"Sorry man! It just kinda slipped out!" Dean grinned back.
At the other end of the table, Sam, Eileen, Garth, Jodie, and Donna are discussing the logistics of creating a hub for hunters.
GABRIEL
CASTIEL
I can handle it myself. Like you said, it should be a simple case.
Cas... I--
ROWENA
Michael moves further into the room and starts looking around, picking up objects and inspecting them as he talks.
"Yeah, he first called his brother, Michael, that a while ago and then that's what he called his brother, Lucifer, and after that, it just kinda became his favorite insult." Dean rolled his eyes.
"Okay then, since my best friend is an assbutt, I'm Castiel Shurley. Nice to meet you." Castiel said.
Sam looks as if he is about to complain about Dean not being in charge of him, but Dean cuts him off before he can do so.
BALTHAZAR
So... is beach day, like, completely out of the cards, or...?
Oh, and Cas? Mention the Winchesters to him. He’ll do anything for you if you mention them.
CASTIEL
Upon spotting Alex, Jamie perks up and starts running towards the group.
Well, I’ll tell you one thing, he’s definitely gotten smarter in his years on Earth.
I just... I just came and got you. I'm God, I can do things like that.
THE EMPTY/CASTIEL
(weakly)
EILEEN
I thought she was dead?
(he takes in a deep breath)
The brothers Winchester refusing to help a girl in need? My, my, I never thought I’d hear of such a tale.
A beat.
24 INT. FIRE STATION - TURNOUT STORAGE - DAY
I love you, Cas.
EILEEN
3  INT. FIRE STATION – BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
He dials Eileen’s number and waits for her to pick up.
Jack shrugs.
Bela raises a hand, her fingers poised to snap.
Cas and I... we got lucky. We got lucky that Jack was able to get Cas out, because otherwise, I never would have made my piece with what happened when he died. We got lucky that Gabe figured out that Chuck was messing with our lives and gave us a second chance.
SUPERNATURAL
Dean gasps as he sits up in his bed, waking up from his nightmare.
Gabriel rolls his eyes.
THE EMPTY
All too soon, the alarm on Charlie's phone went off, signaling for her to get up so she could start her first day at the school.
What? No, yeah, I’m fine. It’s just... been a while.
I thought you weren’t interfering?
NATHAN
SAM (CONT’D)
14 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – DEAN’S ROOM – NIGHT
Ever since I sacrificed myself.
Where is Sam going?
Can I help you?
Not at all. I can’t believe we left you alone earlier, but Cas and Jack both trust you for some reason. I’m questioning their judgement.
Rowena didn't send you.
Little warning before you teleport a girl next time, eh, Clarence?
Cas nods and places a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder as he stands. He lets his hand fall as he turns to leave the library, taking his glass with him.
(backtrack, he’s getting too close to something he’s not ready to say yet)
Sam gives Dean a small nod of his head and Dean waves before Sam turns to leave the bunker.
Crowds of people fill the area for the festivities. Sam and Dean sit together on a bench and Castiel stands next to them. Dean holds a tray of pies in his lap.
Cas and Jack catch up on the happenings of Heaven with MICHAEL, both eager to know that the work they have done to attempt fixing Heaven is working.
DEAN (V.O., CONT’D)
Sam crosses the room to where Rowena is bracing herself against her throne to check on her.
The officer leaves Sam and Eileen alone to start inspecting the clothes.
"Gabriel, do you want to be grounded?" Becky asked. Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel were both bright red and playing with their spaghetti, not looking up. They had clearly understood what Gabriel was implying. Everyone else, however, was trying to hide their snickers. Well, everyone other than Naomi, Hester, and Alfie who had no idea what was going on.
CASTIEL
No, I-- I forgot about her... how did I--
(a beat)
It was kind of hectic towards the end there, lots of things were going on-- and I know that’s not an excuse! But, uh, there was a lot going on.
I'm gonna go help him.
Castiel gives a full smile now.
CASTIEL
Uh, yeah. Sure thing. Um, which car...
"Why'd you tell her?" Cass said, trying to act angry even though he was grinning.
12 EXT. PACIFIC PARK – LATER
Why didn’t you tell me, Cas?
Fine. You can come. But if you mess up at all...
What do you want me to do about that?
I can’t say this new form doesn’t come with its perks, however. I must admit, I almost prefer being like this.
Castiel doesn’t give a response as he and Jack watch Dean leave, Miracle at his side.
Call Rowena and make sure she’s okay, for one. Research on how to fix the Empty situation, for another.
Bela clenches her fist and now it is Rowena’s turn to double over, gasping for air.
We PAN across the scene-- a dilapidated barn in the middle of a field, the Impala parked out front, and Castiel standing in shock as he watches two figures exit the barn together, one supporting the other.
EILEEN
Bela convulses with the shocks before dropping completely to the floor and we CUT TO--
(a beat)
That’s okay, though, because Jamie quickly reaches him and pulls him into a hug.
ALEX/DEMON
The receptionist reaches over to press a button, still not looking away from her game.
So, what are we missing, then?
So, finally back from playing with your boy toy?
She used to trade supernatural artefacts in some kind of black market. We ran into her a lot back then. Turns out, she had made a demon deal that expired not too long before mine did. She asked us to help her, and we didn’t.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Not yet. I was just thinking about calling her to check up.
Thanks for your help.
Hell, yeah! We’ve got Heaven and Hell on our side at the moment. Not to mention, it’s another great excuse to come back to the beach.
"Hey! You liked that and don't even deny it!" Dean cut Cass off.
Well, hello to you, too.
EILEEN
You’ll gank me. Yeah, I got it.
14 EXT. PACIFIC PARK – CONTINUOUS
Bobby chuckles.
Rowena pulls out her phone and presses a few buttons, tapping her fingers on her throne impatiently as she waits for the person on the other line to pick up.
"Belladonna's Poison"
Dean slowly leaves his room, Miracle right behind him, and we CUT TO--
(strained)
(excited)
Something’s up with you. Do you want to talk about it? I may not be able to hear, but that doesn’t mean I’m not a good listener.
Episode #1601
When Sam gets no response, he frowns slightly in confusion and checks the time-- 5:34pm, Dean should be off work by now-- and then starts searching through the Bunker.
Dean moves to more fully block the door.
You want me to stay here? But what if I’m needed in Heaven?
Dean clenches his jaw.
Emily. I need you to put the rope down. This isn’t you. Emily. Please.
Hey, you’re back! Just in time, too, we’re about to have family movie night. Jack picked-- we’re watching Ice Age. Come on, join us!
CASTIEL
BLACKOUT.
Well, that could either be a good or a bad sign.
The inside of the Roadhouse is bustling-- not too packed, but enough to keep ELLEN and JO busy.
24 INT. THE EMPTY – MOMENTS LATER
Cas. It's okay. We've won.
Bobby looks at his beer bottle, which is now empty. Castiel’s revelation is not something he knows how to deal with.
Is it the same tree?
Slowly, the Empty starts to reform in front of Jack, causing his smile to quickly fade.
We open where we left off, with Cas, Dean, Meg, Sam, Eileen, and Jack all glaring at Bela as she smirks at them all in return.
Like Guns ‘N’ Roses.
EILEEN
ALEX/DEMON
THE EMPTY/CASTIEL
Sam and Eileen exit the building and we follow them as they walk to the Impala and climb in.
Dean looks back down at the table, his eyes tracing the names carved there.
Sam, Cas, and Dean all look slightly confused by this, and upon Eileen’s confused look at their confusion, Sam signs that he’ll tell her later.
ACT FOUR
We defeated Chuck. I... I took his and Amara's powers.
CASTIEL
Yeah, ‘cause we don’t have any of those this time around.
"Oh. Hey, you should come to The Roadhouse after school with us!" Dean said, trying to change the subject.
A beat.
You tried to get Nate to catch you?
"Good. I met the new girl, Charlie, and showed her around the school. She's really nice and I think we'll be good friends." Dean said.
ROWENA
Thanks. Um, could you possibly point us in the direction of the campsite where the first three vics were found?
It’s okay, Jack. I’m here to protect you. I promise I won’t let the Empty hurt you anymore.
BLACKOUT.
EILEEN
Morning.
I didn’t ask for your opinion. Shouldn’t you be in Heaven?
Sam said you found Jamie.
Rowena and Bela are both standing again, throwing spells and curses at each other when the doors burst open and they are both thrown back from the force of the blast.
Gertrude flickers into sight sitting on top of the branch, a knife in her hand.
Dean's dirty mug remains on the counter, and the coffee pot still has a little bit of coffee in it, undoubtedly cold by now.
ACT FIVE
Dean!
The only way to describe the chaos happening inside of the Roadhouse is a raging party to put even the most obnoxious college parties to shame.
We focus on Dean and Castiel for a beat before we CUT TO--
Part of Dean doesn’t want to, but he fights that part of him down as he walks over to join Cas, Jack, and Meg in building the sandcastle.
2MusicLover2
Yeah, that’s the same tree.
BLACKOUT.
(concerned)
I just want to know if I should expect you back, is all. You did live a whole life without me, I can’t really expect you to want to stay here after finally living the life you always wanted.
CASTIEL
17 INT. ROADHOUSE – BACKROOMS – MOMENTS LATER
Sorry, it’s been about forty years.
He shakes his head and sighs before he lightly tosses his phone onto the counter next to him and picks up his coffee mug to finish it off.
TEASER
Dean, are you okay?
Never change, Dean.
Please, feel free to leave a comment, I enjoy reading them and reply to all of them! You can also contact me through my tumblr (@spnseason16) and send me an ask, or a message. I love seeing what you all think of my writing!!
Dean laughs and shrugs.
Castiel enters the Roadhouse and makes his way to the bar where Ellen is cleaning off glasses.
Sam and Eileen look back at Emily who is now back to sitting down on her cot and shedding silent tears.
To this, Sam has no response. He almost wants to argue, say that his choices were taken away from him as an infant when Azazel came to his nursery, but he somehow knows it’s not the same as what Dean means. Sure, he was forced to play a role, but he at least knows that he was able to make his own choices as he played that role.
We can still hear Emily’s screams.
I don’t know, I just-- something about the way this case ended. I don’t think it’s over.
(sarcastically)
Dean's room is much cleaner than we last saw it. The bed is made up neatly, the numerous beer and other alcohol bottles have disappeared, and Miracle lays on Dean's bed, staring up at Sam.
Cas and I found Jamie. No sign of her, though.
(solemn)
(oddly emotionless)
Still, no response.
And then it was time for me to die, and I did, but then all of a sudden Dean and I were back on Earth, on the hunt that killed him. Except this time, he didn’t die. And I’m thankful for that, I really am, because that other life was... I wasn’t unhappy, but I wasn’t happy, either. As soon as Dean died, I got out of the life. I stopped hunting and I settled down and got married and had a kid, and I used to think that that was what I wanted, years ago, but these past few years I haven’t wanted that. I don’t want out. I want to hunt-- to help people-- but I didn’t.
We’ll find her, don’t worry. She’s not going to be getting away with anything.
Hey, what do you say we go get some burgers and ice cream, and then we can come back here and hang out? Sound good?
Well, mostly free.
I just... doesn’t the case feel a little... incomplete?
The amusement park is crowded, but we focus on Dean-- all dressed up in colorful swim shorts, a floral-patterned Bermuda shirt, sunglasses, and a bucket hat-- walking through the crowd, side-by-side with Castiel-- who has been coerced into wearing a similar outfit.
DEAN (CONT’D)
We focus on Castiel as we hear the flutter of wings signaling Michael’s departure.
I didn’t think you would care. When I-- I didn’t expect to come back. I wasn’t prepared to see you again, or anyone else. I thought I would be there for the rest of eternity and then Jack came, and he brought me back and--
Silly boy. You do not have dominion over my realm. Your power lies on Earth and in Heaven.
He smiles, his confidence gaining, and looks at Cas as he speaks.
Work, what kind of--
CASTIEL
You’ll figure it out, Dean. We’ll figure it out.
I hear you’re close with Rowena. I want you to ensure that I’m in good standing with her in case Bela’s plan goes south. In exchange, I’ll give you this body back. Not sure why you want it, but whatever. I can find someone else.
I still don’t-- Chuck was still in control of us?
ROWENA
Night, Wes. Happy birthday.
CASTIEL (CONT’D)
Sounds to me like you got lucky.
We ZOOM OUT to see Dean’s reaction. He glances next to him before doing a double-take and promptly choking on his burger before managing to swallow it down.
A small camp is set up in the middle of the eerie forest. Two tents are pitched, between which burns a campfire, the flames bright and high. On logs surrounding the fire sit four college students on a long weekend-- EMILY RICHARDS (20), WESLEY DUBOIS (21), NATHAN DUBOIS (21), and REESE CARNEY (20).
I thought it was just a werewolf?
CASTIEL
"Well, alrighty then, Angel." Dean rolled his eyes. Charlie was just sitting in her chair, laughing at the entire exchange. Now that she has witnessed Dean and Castiel interacting with each other, she can't not ship them.
CASTIEL
At Bela’s words, Meg raises the angel blade and takes a step forward, but Bela disappears before she can stab her.
Dean looks at Jamie with something akin to pity-- or is it sympathy?-- before he looks back to Eileen on his phone.
CASTIEL
Okay. Keep an eye on Jamie while I call Alex and let him know. Where are you?
Jack reaches down to place his hand on Alex’s forehead, a slight glow emanating from his palm, and Alex immediately sits up with a gasp.
Rowena sits up straight and holds up a hand. The room falls silent and the bullet stops a foot in front of her face.
I can’t make any promises, but sure.
Look, man, I’m sorry for putting this all on you, I just had to get it off my chest.
Right. The fire station.
(angrily)
He takes a moment to steel himself before continuing on again.
They sit in silence for a bit as Dean continues to eat his ice cream. Sam doesn’t really know what to do with himself, the moment is too awkward, so he finally breaks the silence.
Stand back.
Dean turns away from Sam, still laughing.
Okay. Good luck at the new job, today.
Thank you all again so much for reading! I love you all!!!
JAMIE
We can tell that Cas doesn’t want to say the name.
Hello, Dean. I have a bone to pick with you.
Discreetly, Sam presses a button on his phone behind his back-- he’s calling Cas.
I meant-- you know what? It doesn’t matter.
The--
Sitting around a table in the break room are DEAN, TOMMI, and several other FIREMEN, all playing a game of BS.
10 EXT. CORONER’S OFFICE – PARKING LOT – MOMENTS LATER
We travel through the sterile hallways of Heaven before we find Castiel and Jack, walking with a purpose. The two walk side-by-side, although it is clear that Jack is leading them.
20 EXT. FOREST – CAMP – CONTINUOUS
Nah, I gotta work. I’ll probably do some research, too. See what we can figure out for our little problem.
I said I’m fine, so drop it.
"Because I'm on break right now!" Ash shouted.
Chuck has been defeated. Now Jack must start redesigning the world how he wants it to be as Cas deals with the aftermath of escaping The Empty.
Outside of the tent, a branch snaps, and Emily freezes, covering her mouth.
You know I’m not one for talking, Sammy.
JACK (CONT’D)
As Dean finishes putting his gear away, he gives Tommi a grateful but tight smile.
EILEEN
Yes, thank you, Balthazar.
EMILY
But... I’m needed in Heaven
2  INT. HELL – THRONE ROOM – DAY
Not really.
(another shaky breath)
Goddammit, Cas, how many times do I gotta tell you to stop doing that?
(a beat)
Like you’ve done any better. Besides, I can think of a few things
As they pass another hallway, a DEMON jumps out and attacks Jack from behind.
I’m just gonna-- yeah.
Episode #1603
CASTIEL
Nothing you’ll find interesting, Sam.
INTERCUT WITH:
We’ll keep an eye on Jamie, you work on finding Alex as fast as you can. Any word yet from Meg and Jack?
DR. LEWIS
"Sure!" Charlie finally said. The woman went to her computer and clicked a few things before the printer whirred to life and soon Charlie was being handed her schedule. She looked over it while she waited for this Dean guy to come and give her a tour of the school. Eventually, a door on the side of the office was opened and laughter floated through it before the boy in the leather coat that Charlie had seen earlier walked out. He smiled at Charlie and strode over to stand next to her.
GABRIEL
Dean reaches out to pat Jack on the shoulder.
CASTIEL
Castiel gives Dean a blank look.
As Gertrude flames away, the rope snaps and Sam falls to the ground and immediately tosses the noose away from him.
Episodes will now be weekly, so get ready for episode 3 to come out on Thursday, January 7th at 8pm EST!
(shouting)
Meg smirks and raises her eyebrows at Dean, laughing at him again.
ALEX/DEMON
GABRIEL
Sam soon finishes packing and slings the bag over his shoulder as he turns around, only to stop in shock when he sees Dean.
Dean shrugs as he turns slightly to look at Cas.
Sam rolls his eyes and scoffs at Dean.
"How long ago did I start working here?" Lucifer asked.
SAM (CONT’D)
I can communicate telepathically with the angels, yes.
Things won’t change if you don’t help.
Dean shakes his head ‘no’.
Dean’s birthday party is in full swing in the library of the bunker. Everyone is eating either Dean’s birthday Rice Krispie treat or some of his birthday pie as they hang around the room talking amongst themselves.
Hang on. I think I’m gonna need a beer for this conversation.
Jack turns around and puts a finger to his lips, shushing them.
Some of the evidence is missing.
ACT ONE
"Just say right." Anna said.
Working alongside him as the rest of my archangels will be Gabriel--
Okay, then. It’s not your fault, Sam. You weren’t in control of your own actions.
BLACKOUT.
So, you should probably go.
Hi everyone! Thank you all for reading, I greatly appreciate each and every one of you!
RECEPTIONIST
Slowly, ZOOM IN on a demon standing close to the door in Hell’s throne room. The demon darts its eyes around the room, calculating.
-2MusicLover2
How long have you been here? In heaven, I mean.
Think again.
As you probably figured, this was originally intended to be posted the week of Dean's birthday, way back in January, but life (college) really got in the way of that. Finals are finally over, though, and I'm back home, so be prepared for more updates! I'm not sure yet if they will be weekly or bi-weekly, but I will definitely let you know when they're coming, so, if you haven't yet, head on over to @spnseason16 on tumblr and give me a follow to get all of the updates and sneak-peeks!
Like I said, I came for Jack because I feel oddly responsible for the kid.
So, this is where I left off when I first started writing it years ago. I plan on continuing, because I need fluff, but updates will be very slow and sporadic because I have soooo many works in progress at the moment.
It’s been a week, Dean. What do you expect to change in a week?
"You tell them to stop embarrassing us, yet you continue to embarrass us as you do it." Dean mumbled, somehow even redder than he was before. Cassie was just as red as Dean was and Lucifer thinks to himself that he would pay big money to know what was going on inside of their heads.
END OF ACT ONE
"Sorry!" Cassie replied, then he remembered Lucifer was there. "What do you need, Luci?"
POLICE OFFICER
No, I-- I wasn’t supposed to come back. That was supposed to be it for me.
Dean rolls his eyes and turns a sarcastic glare to Tommi.
The call ends and Sam tosses his phone onto the seat next to him as he shifts Baby into gear with a smile and we--
ACT FOUR
2  INT. VAMPIRE BARN – NIGHT
Gertrude places her hands on Emily’s cheeks, flickers, and then, just aa Emily is about to run, Gertrude possesses her and we--
Oh, don't give me that look. While you and Michael were gallivanting around Earth with your little boyfriends, we managed to finish up here without any issues.
EILEEN
Meg, Sam, where is she? I need to make sure she's okay.
(shocked and skeptical)
EILEEN
(frantically)
CUT TO--
CUT TO--
(more serious)
Cas and I haven’t-- that’s none of your--
ACT FIVE
TOMMI
Is that... ectoplasm?
Cas enters the room first, his eyes glowing blue and his wings out, and Dean, Sam, Meg, and Jack follow close behind.
Reese grabs a can for himself and sits back down on the log next to Nathan and the campers start to laugh and joke some more.
The breeze and giggling both suddenly stop, creating an eerie stillness.
REESE
That’s the same tree.
CUT TO--
ALEX/DEMON
We ZOOM OUT on the scene of Dean and Cas sitting together on the bench, leaning into each other’s sides, and we--
(gently)
Just through those trees over there. Not too far at all. This is actually the same tree that was used for the hangings. Absolutely sick, whoever’s doing this.
CASTIEL
I’m sorry. For upsetting you. I just-- I feel like we should be doing something, you know?
We focus on Sam as he sits up with a groan. PULL BACK to see Emily suddenly standing over Sam.
Heyya, Sammy! How’s it going?
Sam laughs as Dean pushes him along, clearly not about to take ‘no’ for an answer.
Dean narrows his eyes at her-- he’s never trusted her and her status as a demon isn’t going to change that.
(disgusted)
Dean leans against the counter as he drinks his coffee and scrolls through his phone. He soon finds what he is looking for and taps the screen before holding the phone up to his ear.
Sam nods his head.
"How about you all stop yelling and get off of me before you suffocate me to death!" Dean screeched.
CUT TO--
TOMMI
"Okay, bitch." Dean said before he turned to Charlie. "Do you know where to go?"
Oh, ha-ha. I’m only turning forty-two. That’s not that old.
(a beat)
Sam? What’s wrong?
We don’t have to talk about it, but I didn’t think you would want to be alone.
No. She never picked up.
(a beat)
The line goes dead as Sam hangs up.
PAN towards to voice to see--
Dammit.
With that, Sam hangs up on Dean and searches for a different contact, ‘Alex’. When he finds the contact, he calls, and it only takes one ring before someone answers.
(confused)
What did you wish for?
Cas drove me. He’s waiting in the parking lot.
Bela smirks as she flourishes her hand. Two clouds of black smoke burst from the ground and shove themselves down Alex’s and Jamie’s throats. Once all of the smoke is inside of the two men, they share a menacing smile with Bela as their eyes turn black.
CASTIEL
picked up in Hell.
Could you be any more vague?
Well, then. Good to know nothing's changed there.
"Um... should I be scared to eat my food, because I am." Charlie said, looking at her cheeseburger as if it was about to attack her or just melt into grey goo.
PAN to the corner where we see Castiel and Jack standing together and watching the scene.
Dean snorts.
Okay. I won’t say it. I just think that it won’t stop until it gets what it wants and we should be trying to figure out how to combat that.
ALEX/DEMON
No! No, Jack, you didn’t do anything wrong. You’ll be a wonderful God and create a world worth living in! I just-- how were you able to free me from...
"Yeah! Good to meet you Cass! By the way, Dean told me about who your father is." Charlie said, causing Cass to turn and playfully smack Dean in the chest with the back of his hand.
POLICE OFFICER
Well, I don’t know how to fix this, Sam. You burned my body, you had a funeral, you mourned my death, and you moved on. You had a wife, possibly some kids, and you moved on. You don’t need me to be your big brother anymore, and I’m dealing with that. I’m trying to move on and deal with my own shit, so, please, let me do that.
MICHAEL
Well, now, where’s the fun in just telling you?
When I told you about what happened with Chuck... I left a few things out.
END TEASER
I would like to go to the park!
Dean pumps his fist.
We should probably go check up on her then.
ACT FIVE
It’s just one little rogue demon, I’m sure Clarence can handle it, Feathers.
After that, Dean and Castiel sat making idle chat with Charlie as she finished her food. Dean didn't even bother to get a slice of pie, which made Ellen come over and start frantically checking his temperature to make sure he wasn't sick. They just explained what happened with Lucifer and the fries and Ellen mumbled something under her breath before she scolded Lucifer and made him clean the entire diner until it was spotless. Charlie left soon after that so Dean and Cass took their siblings home.
Yeah, so what’s with the sudden possessiveness?
"Come on kids, stop embarrassing Cass." Chuck said. "Go clean your rooms, and don't even try telling me that you already did because I know for a fact that you didn't."
In a series of fluttering wings, MICHAEL, BALTHAZAR, Gabriel, and Castiel along with Dean all appear on the scene, immediately rushing to Jack's side.
Emily gets up and crawls into her and Wesley's tent as Wesley nudges Nathan with his shoe to wake him.
POLICE OFFICER
Again.
"Assbutt?" Charlie asked through laughter.
Yeah, I just need a computer. And we should probably let Dean and Cas know.
They continue on, Dean in the lead, followed by Cas, Sam, Jack, and Meg pulling up the rear.
"So are you that new chick everyone has been talking about?" He asked, winking at her.
6  INT. MEN OF LETTERS — CASTIEL’S ROOM – DAY
I mean, what have you been doing up here this whole time if you haven’t just been waiting here? What is there to do?
ROWENA
"Yes, Dad." Everyone groaned as they headed off to their rooms. Dean followed Cass up to his room and flopped onto his bed.
CASTIEL
The sun is just starting to come up outside the diner as Sam and Eileen sit in a booth eating. It’s empty except for the two of them and a waitress at the counter.
With this, Cas starts making his way through the hall, knocking on every door and then opening it to see if Meg is there. Dean moves to follow him, saying to Sam as he does so--
THE EMPTY
GABRIEL
Jack...
So, Cassie--
It told me that I took its “things”.
Dean takes a deep breath. This is hard, but Castiel is patient.
"My siblings and I are all named after angels. Lucifer actually isn't that bad, but he does live up to his name at times." Castiel said.
Castiel stays silent as he drinks his beer, lost in his thoughts and his own refusal to visit Dean and risk ruining whatever illusion he might be in right now. Because he knows that if he sees Dean, that will be enough to tell him just how real his return from The Empty actually is.
You were there, Sam. It wasn’t really a long conversation. She said business in Hell was slow, she wanted to make a deal, and then there was a loud noise and she said she had to go. Said she’d call me back.
You get the salt; I’ll get the gasoline.
CASTIEL
Thanks, Sam.
ALEX/DEMON
"Nope. Nothing." Ash said.
When do I ever?
Dean! Come help us finish the sandcastle!
Meg and Bela stand off for a moment longer before Bela releases Dean and he gasps for breath, leaning against Cas and Sam.
Now, isn’t that poetic? You first came into Dean’s life with a handprint, and now you’ve left it with one as well.
Jamie tilts his head slightly towards Dean at the mention of Alex but makes no other sign that he is paying attention.
No, instead you broke your foot trying to get me to catch you.
On the relieved faces of Sam and Eileen, we--
Jack-- before you flip that-- are you sure it’s going to do what you think it will?
MICHAEL
EILEEN
Damn, kid, you’re just as bad as Cas with that.
Contrary to its name, THE EMPTY is far from empty. ANGELS and DEMONS both fill The Empty, but we only care about one.
Unfortunately... slim. She only left Hell when we went down to help Rowena because she wanted to. The only time I’ve ever seen her not get her way was when she died.
(softly)
CUT TO--
We shift our attention along with the archangels, Dean, and Jack, to Meg, who is gasping for air and choking on blood.
Alex? Where’s Alex?
As always, if you enjoyed this chapter, please make sure to leave kudos, I really appreciate it when you do!
"Well now I feel bad." Lucifer said once they were gone and his family just gave him a collective bitch face before they continued eating in silence.
FADE IN:
"You can tell me anything, Cass." Dean said, sitting up and looking at Cass. He reached out and grabbed Cass' hand, rubbing the back of it soothingly with his thumb.
END OF ACT TWO
Another hunt so soon? We just got back from the dead.
Aw, that hurts! I’m the one that helped you two reunite and you don’t get excited for my return? Ouch. And giving Jack all the credit, too!
Come on, what’s going on?
"Rewind"
(regretfully)
Cas makes a face at this. It would be so easy for him to erase Alex’s and Jamie’s memories of the day, replacing them with a nice day at the beach. He could do it so easily... but he doesn’t think it would be a good idea.
Listen, could you give my partner and I a few minutes to look this all over? If we find anything, I’ll let you know.
Anytime, Cassie.
How about I cut you a deal—and before you say no, just know that I am not technically a demon, and I have helped you many times.
NATHAN
Sam thinks about it for a moment. He’s not sure if it will help, but he will certainly try it.
It’s an article. For a case.
Take your time. Visit with them. I can handle Heaven by myself for now.
Right. Well, uh, I’m starting work today.
I’ll manage.
The beach goers nearby all look at the group with questioning looks.
Well, it wasn’t just your death, but that was a big part of it.
BALTHAZAR
BLACKOUT.
ACT TWO
My Queen, I am afraid that there hasn’t been any.
CHARLIE
Uh, yeah, actually. In 1917 a mother and daughter named Maria and Gertrude Osmond were killed by a mob accusing them of witchcraft. Wow. They were both hanged and then had their hearts cut out-- just like our victims.
-2MusicLover2
I dunno, there was a loud bang and then she hung up. It almost sounded like... like a gunshot?
The noose is back around Sam’s neck and he has just enough time to grab it as he is yanked up and the rope wraps itself around the branch of the tree.
I had choices taken from me, too. I wasn’t able to go to Eileen in that other life I lived. I didn’t get my happy ending that I wanted.
ACT FIVE
Stevie frowns-- Dean hasn’t celebrated his birthday?-- and upon seeing her look, Dean continues speaking.
Sam shakes his head.
Sam clears his throat.
Yeah, it does. I was kind of thinking we should stay here for a bit to make sure we finished it.
CASTIEL
My son, Jack. Although you might know him as God.
We’ll get to that. And, of course, I’m going to do research. Do you really think I’d just sit around and do nothing when there’s the possibility that Jack and Cas might die again?
Dean enters the room, pushing Sam along in front of him. He pushes Sam to sit down on one side of Cas before he sits down on the other side and grabs his own bowl of popcorn.
BLACKOUT.
Hey, boy, how long have you been alone here?
I can do things like this, now.
CUT TO--
It’s hot.
END OF ACT TWO
(a pause as he searches for the right words)
Where’re Cas and Jack?
And what, exactly, would that be?
(confused)
There’s plenty of angels up there that can take care of it and keep anything too bad from happening. Besides, a little family time never hurt anyone.
Dean is suddenly stone-faced, although we can see a hint of embarrassment peeking through as we--
"Yeah, was poisoning us with your nasty ass fries worth it?" Dean questioned.
New skill you learned in Hell? I remember it wasn’t something you had as a human, you know, since you killed your parents for their money.
(mumbling)
But it’s not over.
You good with your little crisis, there?
And then when I came back, once Jack brought me to Earth and showed me that I really am back-- you just seemed so happy. And then you told Sam that it was time the two of you moved on from Jack and I. I was about to go back to Heaven after that, but then Michael came and started talking about how he and I are basically the same because of me and you, and him and Adam, and he convinced me to talk to you-- and I was about to-- and then I heard your last prayer and you were, well, here.
Of course.
"Heya Sammy! Sorry, I was showing Charlie here around the school and then we ended up meeting Cass in the library and that's where we've been all day." Dean said as they walked up to the scrawny boy with long brown hair who was standing next to the Impala with four other kids.
CASTIEL
CLOSE ON Jack, who sits on his knees with his hands over his ears. He is clearly sobbing as he shakes his head. We ZOOM OUT to see that THE EMPTY stands over him. As we watch, the black ink slowly transforms into Castiel.
Rowena and Bela are facing off in the middle of the room, circling each other. Every other demon that was once in the room lies dead on the floor.
Dean starts up the car as we--
EILEEN
Got any plans for that?
Alex nods and swallows-- his mind is racing, and for good reason.
Castiel sighs as he sets the glass down.
Dean, Sam, and Cas all sit at a table, a bottle of scotch between them, each nursing their own glass.
GABRIEL
"Well, I mean, Michael wanted to 'possess' you, so obviously it wasn't just a freak Satan thing." Castiel said.
Sam, we haven’t left this room since before she called the first time-- don’t you think we all would have known if she called back?
Okay, so we’re gonna circle back to that archangel thing when you come back. But-- be safe. I just got you back, I'm not gonna lose you again, you hear?
"Wow. What about you, Dean?" Charlie asked.
If you see him before I do, tell him “bye” for me, too.
It’s not-- never mind.
A moment passes as the voice replies-- we still can’t hear them-- and then the line beeps as the other person hangs up.
From the hallway, Michael steps into the room, his arms crossed.
(worried, frantic)
Castiel raises a hand towards the doors and with a flash of bluish-white light and a loud BANG, the doors open.
Surprised you’re finally admitting that.
Wesley wakes up and nods his head at Emily as he stands to stretch.
BLACKOUT.
Well, let me know how it goes. I’ve got-- I need to make a few amends with Jack... a lot of people, actually-- you included-- and I--
Sam and Dean both shrug-- they barely knew anything about Bela and how she operated when she was human, there is no telling how she works now that she is a demon.
You gonna tell me where it is you’re going, then?
Dean shrugs as he shuffles the deck and starts to deal the cards out.
(groaning, now)
Sam tilts his head in confusion.
"So? That's not gonna stop us from shipping you together, especially if you keep doing things like talking at the same time. It's just so cute!" Michael grinned and Dean and Cass looked at each other, blushed a deep shade of red, then looked away.
END OF TEASER
POLICE OFFICER
And the chances of us stopping her...?
No problem. Gotta do my service to the universe somehow. Might as well be mini-God’s personal bodyguard.
Dean is more than a little shocked by the amount of people in the bunker, all there to celebrate his birthday. He stumbles through a thank you, but he gets cut off by Jack carrying the Rice Krispy treat and holding it out towards him.
I’ll call Dean while we look for a computer.
4  INT. TENT – CONTINUOUS
Right.
(pointedly)
NATHAN
Murders? I thought they were attacked by a wild animal.
I think he understands, though. I think I might, too. He wanted to talk to you but Sam insisted that he be the one to do it, so Castiel said that Sam should let you cool off first.
12 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – DEAN’S ROOM – MOMENTS LATER
Jack and Castiel stand in a white-washed room, no other beings in sight. The sudden silence is now deafening.
Bela went through all the hard work of getting these bodies for us, the least I can do is use this one while you have the other one.
He doesn’t wait for an answer, however, as he glances at the computer’s screen before promptly leaving with a WHOOSH of his wings.
You? Doing research?
Dean shrugs and finally pulls away from the hug, but only enough to look at Castiel as they talk.
Is that... Bela?
EILEEN
TO BE CONTINUED...
Thank you, Ellen.
7  EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER – DAY
As long as you let me help, I’m okay with that.
Ferris wheel.
Thank you all so much for reading this!! I am constantly blown away by the amount of support and excitement I see from everyone about this project!
BOBBY
So? I hear you were, too, at one point.
So, quit being a friggin’ Eeyore, huh? Come on. Get into this.
CASTIEL
BLACKOUT.
At the edge of the camp, something moves gently in the wind and we ZOOM IN to see Wesley, Nathan, and Reese all hanged from a tree in the middle of a clearing, blood dripping from each of their chest cavities, which are open to reveal missing hearts and we--
EILEEN
DEAN (CONT’D)
Okay. Odd thing about my death.
Where... why are we in Heaven? How?
Still haven’t changed, have you?
(a beat)
I still don’t get where you’re going with this.
EILEEN
Rogue demon? The only demon here is you.
Jack nods.
17 EXT. PACIFIC PARK – PIER - DAY
ACT TWO
That’s when all hell breaks loose.
Castiel shoots Gabriel a pointed look.
Yes! I’ve always thought it was too stuffy up here.
Jack wanted to watch a movie to pass the time and I believe he dragged Cas and Meg along with him.
(a beat)
ACT FOUR
EILEEN
JACK and THE EMPTY face off where we left them in the previous episode.
Our mismatched family has made its way to the beach, crowded in with other tourists and citizens.
(visibly confused)
Do you think we’ll be able to?
Insurance of what?
2MusicLover2
As always, comments and kudos are loved, appreciated, and encouraged! I love hearing what you thought of each episode, so either leave a comment, or head on over to tumblr to send me an ask or message! I reply to everything!!
Who? Bela?
No, I should be the one to do it. It’s my fault he’s pissed, anyways.
And Alex over there and his friend Jamie had the misfortune of being the bastards’ meatsuits.
Slowly, the redhead got up and trudged through her apartment, getting ready so she could leave. She was out the door at 5 minutes to 7 and she got in her beloved yellow car. As soon as the car turned on, "Walking on Sunshine" started blasting through the speakers and Charlie danced along in her seat as she drove to the school. She parked in an empty space and just as she was about to get out, a black, Chevy Impala parked in the space next to her and two boys got out. The one that was driving looked about Charlie's age and his light brown hair was spiked up. He adjusted his leather jacket on himself before putting his hand on the younger boy's shoulder and steering them towards the high school. Charlie smiled at the affection the older boy showed for the younger one and then she headed into the office to get her schedule.
Sam and Eileen both stand and move to shake the woman’s hand.
Dean-- he would-- he would pray to me. Every day. It’s the only thing that kept me sane and now I don’t even know if that was real. I don’t know if any of this is real, because I still hear him.
"Not interested." Charlie said.
EILEEN
CASTIEL
See you, Dean.
Okay. We can do that.
Hunting? You know, our job?
Dean studies Meg, looking for any lies, but she is telling the truth.
Heaven’s lived without God for ages, it can go a little longer. Take some time, be a kid. Stay here. Where you’re safe.
Something catches Castiel’s eye, but he doesn’t move to look at it, instead taking in a shaky breath as Jack continues.
PAN down to see the Impala driving down an otherwise silent road. As it passes the camera, we turn to see a city sign for Akron, Ohio.
19 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – KITCHEN – MORNING
Sam enters the bunker, duffle bag on his shoulder, and calls out to Dean, remembering the last time he came back.
Rowena casts a spell and Bela doubles over, vomiting blood and black smoke that swirls around her feet. Slowly, Bela is able to stop vomiting and she stands back up, opening her mouth wide to allow the smoke back in.
Okay. Lemme know how it goes, I guess.
(suppressing excitement)
Dean checks himself over before he responds.
We don’t know that, though! We don’t know how much he was controlling and--
We PAN across the view from Bobby’s porch until we see Castiel approaching and we CUT TO Bobby’s smile as he takes another sip of beer.
Sam sits at the table several articles pulled up on his computer, while Eileen sits across from him, packing salt into shotgun shells.
SAM and EILEEN walk together along the coast. Any outsider might think they are just a normal couple on a walk together, but we know otherwise.
His prayers are real. It’s truly him praying to you, no one else. Even when you were dead.
22 INT. THE EMPTY – DAY
Dean presses his phone to his forehead.
Sorry about the mess, we don’t get many murders around here.
You got it.
Now it’s Eileen’s turn to take a moment as she processes this information.
Jack opens the door and they step through as we PAN TO--
CASTIEL
Sam sits at the table, his chin in one of his hands while the on the hand taps on the table in front of him. He can’t shake the feeling that the case isn’t over, and he doesn’t want to leave it.
I have also decided to appoint Castiel as my second-in-command, and upon retrieving him from The Empty, I have promoted him to the status of an archangel.
"I have to go pick up my younger siblings so it will take me a little longer to get to The Roadhouse." Cass said.
So, Heaven is finished, then?
CASTIEL
Got it. We’ll be there in a few.
I haven’t... I’ve been up here with Jack since he became God. I’m here on my own.
CASTIEL
Thank you, Dean.
Jack came and got me from... where I was... almost immediately after you defeated Chuck, as far as I can tell.
"It smells amazing, which is surprising. I've never actually had decent school food before. It all tasted like cardboard to me."
CASTIEL (O.S.)
Sam looks up from pushing his food around his plate. He pushes his plate away from him as he leans forward to talk to Eileen.
SAM (CONT’D)
BOBBY
CASTIEL
I know, but-- I just want to go check it out. Pre-emptively cut off any more attacks, you know?
"Honey, I'm home!" Dean shouted as he walked through the front door of the Shurley house. As soon as the door shut, he was greeted by 12 people running into the room and jumping on him, causing everyone to fall to the floor in a huge pile. "Alright, alright. You're crushing me here people! You just saw me a little bit ago!"
Where?
They come upon the clearing with the tree, which is once again standing. There isn’t a single sign that anyone had ever burned it.
CASTIEL
Hey, my final act was to help the Winchester’s cause! You two on the other hand- -
There’s much more behind the simple question, but Jack understands the meaning.
Gabriel raises his hand and stands on his toes. Jack looks at him expectantly.
Sam shakes his head.
Already did that. When I brought you back here. You are officially free of Chuck.
BLACKOUT.
Castiel leaves in a flutter of wings, leaving Dean standing next to the Impala all alone.
Are you sure you don’t need our help?
Dean, Sam, and Gabriel all enter the bunker in a single file. Dean’s stony expression transforms into a grin as he sees MIRACLE bounding towards him. Dean drops his bag to pet Miracle before he looks up to see CASTIEL coming from the direction that Miracle had come from.
Emily makes no move to leave. Instead, she steps even further into the clearing, and it is then that Eileen notices it-- the rope in Emily’s hand, trailing across the ground behind her.
I seem to remember you working with us, once upon a time.
SAM (CONT’D)
Eileen gets to work dumping gasoline all over the tree, careful not to get it on anything else. Luckily, the tree is in the middle of a small clearing, so chances of the fire spreading are slim.
24 INT. MOTEL ROOM – EVENING
Gabriel hesitates and glances between Dean and Cas with a smirk.
--but for some reason you weren’t searching for ways to rescue him. And then came your death. That was what really told me something was clearly wrong. See, you didn’t want to die, Dean. Not until that moment, at least. You wanted to live a life. Settle down, only pick up the occasional hunt here and there. Get an actual job. But then, you were suddenly okay with dying. You refused to let Sam get you any help, but you had more than enough time for it. You just died, though. Unsatisfied with your life and leaving Sam to live a life he was unsatisfied with. Tell me, Sam, can you even remember what your wife looked like?
I don’t believe that for a second.
State police. I’m--
Gabriel shrugs.
Dean sits on a beach towel, smiling out at the scene of his family before him-- Sam and Eileen stand about waist-deep in the ocean, splashing each other; Jack, Cas, and Meg build a sandcastle together, Jack’s hair wet and sticking up in every direction-- It’s far from normal, but Dean can’t help but think of his family as perfect.
"Then why did my fries taste like dog shit?" Dean demanded.
Sam, come on. We need to get Emily away from here, we can come back to finish this later.
You had us come here for a reason. What do you want?
CASTIEL
Rowena and Bela both lay on the floor, barely sitting up. Off to the side, Rowena’s phone starts ringing, the screen lighting up to display ‘Dean Winchester’. It rings for several moments, neither Rowena nor Bela move towards the phone. Instead, they both glare at each other until it stops ringing.
"Good!" Becky said. "I can't believe you tried poisoning my OTP!"
(admonishing)
The giggling continues. A breeze blows through the clearing causing Sam, Eileen, and Emily to shiver.
Jack?
You okay there, mini-God?
Ellen nods, raising and eyebrow at Castiel’s bluntness.
Cas tosses the keys to Sam, all the while looking at Dean.
Once they are out of both gasoline and salt, Eileen and Sam stand at the edge of the clearing. Sam pulls a lighter out of his pocket and lights it. He tosses it at the tree and he and Eileen watch as the tree goes up in flames.
CASTIEL
30 INT. MEN OF LETTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
"Yeah, I saw it on the way into town when I first moved here." Charlie said.
Wow, a position of power! It’s been a while since I’ve been in one of those!
"Luce, that is the best story I have heard all day." Anna somehow managed to get out through her laughter.
SAM and DEAN stand together on the bridge looking out at the expanse that has become Jack’s version of Heaven.
ROWENA
So, what’s first on your list for rebuilding Heaven?
Eileen enters the room, locking the door behind her, and sits down next to him to help.
Chuck designed it.
Miracle! Miracle, no! Come back!
I’m thinking that we should question the survivor.
They found Jamie.
No, yeah, I just-- yeah, finding a case sounds good.
Bobby is about to say something, probably tell Cas to say it already, but Cas continues without prompting.
Gabriel SNAPS his fingers and a small stream starts trickling down the mountainside next to the path.
Cas... I’m sorry, man. I wanted to live a better life for you, but I-- I’m sorry your sacrifice was a waste.
A POLICE OFFICER enters followed by Sam and Eileen, who each nod at the officer before he leaves them alone with Emily.
With that, Sam hangs up on Dean and searches for a different contact, ‘Alex’. When he finds the contact, he calls, and it only takes one ring before someone answers.
Dean motions for everyone to follow him.
Yeah. Yeah, I’m having fun. I, uh--
VOICE (O.S.)
Dean grunts in response as he sits down.
ACT THREE
Now, eat.
The demon shrugs.
(joining the converaation)
"Because when I started working here, I found some fries that had been expired for a year so I put them away for a time like this. You just ate 8 year old fries." Lucifer grinned.
What exactly do you want with these souls? They’re no good to you for another ten years anyways.
Eileen. Hi.
END OF ACT THREE
CASTIEL
I'm glad you're okay.
The reception is quaint and quiet-- the town obviously doesn’t get many cases like this one. The RECEPTIONIST seems bored as she plays solitaire on her computer.
Oh, yeah! That thing at the...
The lights are off in the bunker leaving the contents of the room in shadows as Dean opens the door and enters the bunker.
"Your mom is here?"
Everyone in the room other than Sam flinches at the name.
That’s okay, Jack, you did good, kid.
ASH, GABRIEL, and BALTHAZAR are among the partiers, while both MICHAEL as Adam, and ADAM sit at the bar.
FADE IN:
In his hand, Sam has a flashlight and a printed out copy of the photo from the article he had found.
Jack lays gasping on a wooden dock. His wounds are healed, but his clothes are still stained with his blood. Next to him sits Meg, her condition is much worse than Jack's-- not only did she struggle with fighting the Empty, but also Heaven is no place for a demon.
CUT TO Cas, as he falls to his knees in despair.
THE EMPTY
Castiel walks over to Dean’s desk and picks up the paper that had caught his eye. It’s a JOB CONTRACT to be a fireman-- it looks like Dean has gotten himself a job away from hunting.
BLACKOUT.
Sam said “bye”, by the way.
I don’t care what heaven looks like as long as it’s someplace where everyone can be together.
JACK (CONT’D)
SAM (O.S.)
Emily wipes her eyes and nods as she picks up the few beads in her cell while Eileen and Sam pick up the rest of the beads. When Eileen stands back up, Emily is holding out her hand through the cell bars, the beads sitting in the palm of her hand for Eileen to take, which she does gratefully.
(through phone)
As the Ferris wheel comes to a stop, Jamie looks out and sees Dean and Castiel, talking with each other, and widens his eyes in panic before black smoke rushes out of his mouth and he collapses in his seat, causing the girl to scream and attracting the attention of Dean and Cas.
CASTIEL
No! I’d prefer you not be mad.
Dean drops his hands from his face and glares at Meg.
Sam sighs as he turns to Eileen.
EMILY
25 EXT. FOREST – NIGHT
My prayers, Cas. Did you hear my prayers? Because I-- when you-- it messed me up, okay? I was messed up.
Dean shakes his head.
I understand.
Thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!
Of course, I’ll stay with you, Dean. I’ll always stay with you.
Yeah, I got something.
BELA (O.S.)
It was Wes’ and Nate’s birthday. We went camping to celebrate, just like we have every year since freshman year. It was our second night there and we all fell asleep around the campfire, but I woke up in the middle of the night, because it was cold, and I woke Wes up, too, and went back to our tent while he woke up Nate and Reese. It didn’t take him too long, and the next time I woke up it was morning and Wes was gone and I was covered in blood.
What do you mean?
Eileen sits in front of the tv, completely unaware of Sam’s internal conflict as she watches a show.
Look, I understand if you don’t want anything to do with me after this, there’s really no way to excuse the fact that I worried you and then left you alone for a week without any explanation, and I--
EILEEN
MADELINE
Dean returns the smile with a nod of his head before he turns to Meg.
He’s still your brother, Dean. No matter how much time has passed. You forget that you once spent forty years away from Sam yourself, and that turned out fine.

15 INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CASTIEL’S ROOM – DAY
CASTIEL
Are you getting anywhere with the research?
BLACKOUT.
That has nothing to do with this.
Sam. The rope.
Okay, I’ll see you soon, then.
Top me off, too, please?
BOBBY sits in a wooden rocking chair, a half-drunk bottle of beer in his hand as he looks out over the serene and picturesque landscape before him.
A beat.
ELLEN
POLICE OFFICER
Oh, darling, I have plenty of business here. You on the other hand... what business does a demon have with God, an archangel, and the Winchesters?
MICHAEL
BLACKOUT.
On the edge of the camp, something flickers. We ZOOM IN to see a little girl peering around a tree-- GERTRUDE OSMOND.
Oh, don’t look at me like that. Like I said, the kid isn't dead.
MICHAEL
I would also like to give a huge shout out to my three betas/cheerleaders on tumblr: @destiels-canonahhhhhhhhhh @dreamilyjensen and @fanv3rgent !! Y'all have helped so much in giving me pointers and just generally being super supportive in this whole project, so thank you!!
decent, he thought.
And she’s a demon now.
TO BE CONTINUED...
CASTIEL
Saying what?
It’s not exactly like we had that much time to celebrate. Saving the world and... all that.
SAM (CONT’D)
A moment passes as the voice replies-- we still can’t hear them-- and then the line beeps as the other person hangs up.
MICHAEL
So, in this episode we got into a bit of Sam's struggles with coming back to life. I will admit, I'm not all that used to writing stories based around Sam and his thoughts and actions, so this one was a bit hard for me. I hope I did his character justice in starting out the arc I hope to write for him in this season. Please, let me know what you think and if you have any tips or pointers for writing Sam!
The campfire is now nothing but ashes as the sun rises through the trees. Beer cans litter the ground as evidence from the previous night.
I’m coming back. And it’s not the life I always wanted. Maybe at first, but after a while I preferred hunting to being normal. It’s why I always ended up coming back to it. I just-- I need to find Eileen. I didn’t do that last time, and I should have. I didn’t find anyone.
BOBBY
GABRIEL
Where do you think Bela would have gone? And what would she have done with Jamie?
GABRIEL
THE EMPTY
Just then Becky called everyone to the table for dinner. Dinner with the Shurley family is always interesting. Partially because there are so many of them but also because that's when they all share about their day. Alfie told everyone about how his class has a bunny named Harold as a pet and he might get to take it home for a weekend. Hester and Naomi both spent their turn complaining about how their class never follows the rules. Naomi muttered something about wishing she could brainwash them, which scared even Lucifer. Hannah talked about some drama that was going on with how some guy thought she was his girlfriend but she wasn't and no one could really follow the story. Anna joined a broadcasting club or something like that where she would have to record videos of people at school and students' home lives. Next was Castiel and Dean, because they rarely left each other's sides so their story for the day was always the same.
Eager to get back to hunting and away from the confines of the bunker, Sam asks Eileen to assist him on a hunt in Washington state.
