“There are some truly fascinating rock formations along Wembury’s beaches I could examine,” he answered with a hidden enthusiasm.
I start going on walks. Occasionally I find myself in Regent’s Park, far too close to the flat I still think of as home. I don’t know if I’m going there on purpose or not, I just go.
“I do,” he responds quickly, not moving his glance from my face as he says it. He moves the ring onto my fourth finger and I feel something heavy and perfect in my chest.
“Only if you’d like to, I-I don’t really know where rosie would go. She can’t stay with Mrs. Hudson forever but I don’t think your room could fit her forever, she’s getting bigger and it was a stupid idea anyway i—”
“Clarke will get frustrated with the piles of evidence against Wilde and be forced to resign the case. I am uncertain if any conviction will be possible in this first trial with Clarke as counsel, which will cause much delay. If they must have another criminal trial to convict him of his charge, it will give Wilde time to escape, though I doubt he will take the opportunity. Other than those specificities, I am uncertain as to the outcome.”
I could not breathe. My mind had halted completely, overcome with shock. The parchment in my grasp began to shake, and I soon was cognisant that it was my hand causing it. Holmes had told me, almost two months ago now, that he knew this was to be the result. He lay next to me in the inn at Hatherleigh, and he told me of this precise course of events. And yet, I was incapable of processing the words upon the page.
John gets dressed in his jeans and stonewashed denim jacket, lined with multiple homemade buttons of bands he (at least openly) enjoys. Led Zeppelin, Queen, Sex Pistols, Depeche Mode, etc. He leaves off the more “flamboyant” groups.
“Sherlock, I—” he pauses and takes a breath. “I just wanted to say I’m sorry for… ignoring you… like that,” he hardly manages to get the words out.
“When did you know?” Flashbacks caused this, I imagine. My hand is shaking. I watch it. I wait for an answer.
Two hours later, I come into the hospital room to try again and the room is too quiet. Mary is crying.
Lestrade agrees to meet us at the MI6 headquarters the next day and Sherlock instantly seems off-put. I hold his hand as we walk up, to which he stops for a minute to process that we’re out in public and his hand is in mine. Once he does, he holds it back, but his expression worries me.
As everyone sits down in the chairs we set up just an hour before, John, Lestrade, Molly, and I all go to the landing, prepared to enter. Lestrade and Molly go first, of course, and then John and I step out into view, him just slightly ahead of me.
Yesterday’s Not Here by Pete Shelley, released in 1981. He listed the full track list of the Homosapien album in his mind as the exercise he knows all too well. He’s been with Mary for four months, and most of the time, John has been able to contain these outbursts he doesn’t understand to when he takes showers, or long after she falls asleep, or when he is otherwise alone. But they are in a different city, a different world away from the consistency of London. There is no hiding from Mary this time.
Herein lies what truly transpired during the months of April and May in the year of 1895. If my post-humous requests have been maintained, no one other than Sherlock Holmes and myself should be reading these documents until, at least, 1975. These accounts will depict a different side of both myself and my lifelong companion, colleague, and friend, one that I cannot currently share with the living public.
“Expect nothing less from me, John,” Sherlock confirms with a nod, only to lock eyes with John. The two dissolve into giggles right as they reach the classroom door.
In the secret darkness of this suite, we could cherish the few remaining days we were allotted before we had to return to the life of Sherlock Holmes, the Detective, and his friend, Doctor John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Here, we could be Sherlock and John, husbands, nothing more.
Throughout our preparations for this journey, as well as our decision to take the case that caused it, neither one of us had admitted the truth of our situation. Often, it was not safe to do so. Hearing the words exit Holmes’s mouth, however, in such a matter-of-fact way, made my heart ache. I took a deep breath, and mustered up a response.
Oh. We’re at Baker Street. Sherlock rushes onto the street and it takes me 5 seconds longer than normal to realize why we shouldn’t even be here. I step out of the car quickly and grab Sherlock’s arm.
After a month I see an article on my phone saying that Sherlock has publicly accused reality show host and philanthropist Culverton Smith of being a serial killer. Like all news articles about Sherlock, I know it will sting. This one, probably more than any other. I scroll past it. A few moments later I see one announcing the death of Smith’s daughter, Faith. Suicide.
“Wilde will be convicted,” he stated simply. It stung in a deep corner of my chest. Many minutes passed as I attempted to form a reply.
boyfriend,” I say back. We smile so much these days, it’s quite a good change in scenery around here.
He sighs again and leans down to meet my forehead (he seems to find comfort in it). “Just stay with me?” His voice is so unbearably cautious and delicate.
He doesn’t say anything for a bit, just simply nods. He kisses my chest and rests against me—a comforting weight.
John turns around to set the cups on the table and sees me. I hesitate to say his face lit up, but I swear the morning sun brightened across it when his eyes met my own.
“Me either. Must have had a reason.” Shake my head again. Clear my thoughts. Doesn’t work. “It’ll come back to me.” Bite the paper now. Hm. “You ended your relationship recently.”
As we found seats in the dining room, I had time to properly look at Holmes’s passionate expression.
“D’you know what happened at the hospital that night?” I know she will understand, but the fact that “the hospital that night” could mean so many nights brings an ache to my gut.
Over twenty years have passed since I met John. My hair has begun to gray (only slightly) and the sharp angles and lines of my figure are starting to ache. I have been “Sherlock Holmes (and now Watson) The Consulting Detective” for the majority of my time here, and now is the first time I’m thinking about the future.
When he came home from Mary’s earlier in the afternoon, there was a letter on the kitchen counter from an alias he recognised all too well, Sherrinford. They had created codenames for one another back in Year 11, sort of like a game. John’s was Ormond. Now, they held a separate meaning all together.
I listened to all his words and retellings with care, occasionally drifting into my imagination. Thankfully, due to the time of year, the beaches were mostly barren. Many were too occupied, tending to their farms and their families to wander along the shore as we were. It added a sense of freedom to the relaxing adventure, and allowed me to become truly engrossed in my own contentment.
“I wanted to hear your confession; needed to know I was right,” I say softly, full of fear. “The mortuary; your ‘favourite room.’ You talk to the dead. You make your confession to them. Why do you do it?”
Smith takes us into his “favourite room.” The morgue, naturally. He tries to mock me and Sherlock brings up something I have yet to hear today:
“Put pressure on it. As much as possible, don’t worry about hurting me.” Oh, John, if only I could manage not to worry about you. He sounds soldier-like, as always. Despite the strength in his words, his face is losing colour and I feel tears well up behind my eyes. “Hey, hey,” he says, grabbing my other arm. “I’ll be fine, all right? Just call the ambulance, we’ll be okay.”
Still he teases, only paying attention to the head of John’s cock, his hand wrapped around John’s shaft, effectively stopping John from thrusting into his mouth.
Their arrival into the bathroom is greeted by the sound of their laughter echoing off the tiles, quickly drowned out by the sound of running water. John is pleased to see that the shower head itself is huge, larger than a dinner-plate, and he calculates that the spray should easily cover the pair of them; especially if they are standing close, which he fully intends they will be.
The sound of a snort and the sight of Sherlock rolling his eyes is enough to pull John out of his musings. It's so very typically Sherlock that a flood of affection washes over John and he has to work hard to suppress an indulgent smile. A deep chuckle breaks through all of his efforts and soon he is laughing alongside Sherlock, the action washing away the last of the darkness that had threatened him. The laughter gradually dies off and a different sort of seriousness fills the room.
"What happens now?" His voice feels very small and he resists the temptation to curl up and hide away after baring so much of himself for John.
“Yes, some of them are.”  Sherlock concedes, eyes never leaving John’s face.  “But who are the others?  Mycroft gave me a file on twenty people; only seven of whom have any connection with Mycroft.  A connection that is tenuous at best.  For the rest of the people the only thing they have in common is the fact they are
For a moment both men are silent, contemplative, except for their heavy breathing and then the silence is broken by
"John?" Sherlock's voice was deep, still wrapped in the last caress of sleep, but there was a panicked urgency there that had John scurrying into view.
Yes! It's finally here! I'm so sorry it has taken so long to complete! I hope you enjoy this final instalment of Words Unspoken. It has been an utter joy to communicate through the comments with you, thank you so much for the support and patience.  I hope to write more in the world of Sherlock soon.
"Sherlock? You've been very quiet since we left Bart's, are you ok?" John asks, holding out a sandwich and a cup of tea.  Sherlock accepts the offerings before taking the painkillers John gives him.
At the thought of the wedding John had gone cold. He loved Mary, she was easy to be around and made him laugh, but the relationship seemed to be dull and lifeless compared to his time spent with Sherlock. When Mary had cuddled into him in bed he had initially returned her soft kisses but had then frozen as things had become more heated, Mary obviously wanted to take things to a more sexual level. He had extricated himself from her arms, saying he was tired after a long day of working with Sherlock, had kissed her briefly on the cheek before rolling over onto his side and faking a few deep yawns.  He had felt her confusion washing over him and was grateful when she had given him a small hug before whispering good night and letting him sleep.  His mind had been racing when he eventually did fall asleep, remembrances of being held against Sherlock flooding his mind. His dreams too, had been full of Sherlock.  Sometimes serious ones where they were working cases, where they were reliant on each other totally.  The two of them against the rest of the world. Other times the dreams had been silly, where he and Sherlock were dressed in top hats and evening suits dancing their way through a starlight sky. In all of the dreams he had known that something was different between them, that something had changed. He and Sherlock had been more than flat mates, more than best friends - they had been lovers. He had awoken feeling satisfied and fulfilled only to feel his heart plummet at the realisation that it had all been only a dream.
(No more than usual. The home owner used to often arrive late at night. He didn't really mix with anyone; very private.).
John fishes around the deep pockets of Sherlock's dressing gown, thumbing the phone into life. His brows furrow when he sees that he has a message, a quick click gets him into the menu and his stomach lurches when he sees the name of the sender- Mary.
"Oh God!" John buries his face against Sherlock's shoulder, willing the tears not to spill. He never thought he'd hear those words from Sherlock. On the occasions that he let himself fantasise, he had imagined the words would either be rushed or bitten out. Never in his wildest dreams had he thought the words would be so earnestly delivered, so heartfelt. He finally manages to get his tears under control and pulls back to look at Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes are bright with unshed tears of his own and a soft smile plays over his lips. "I love you, too, Sherlock." It's a simple statement but John feels like a weight has been lifted from his heart. Sherlock's eyes drift closed as he absorbs John's words.
“That’s unacceptable, Lestrade, she should never have been put in the line of danger like that. What if Mary had found the devices? Mrs Hudson would have been at serious risk, she could have been killed.” Sherlock’s voice is sharp, his words clipped, genuine fear for his landlady shining through.  Sherlock resists the urge to pace but only because he can see John tensing, ready to forcefully put Sherlock back in his bed if necessary.
"Yes Mrs Hudson, it's me. I'm just here to to to um....." John stuttered to a halt, unable to come up with a suitable lie and suddenly desperate to not let Mrs Hudson know what he and Sherlock would be doing.
"Stop what, Mrs Hudson?   You can plainly see I am not doing anything. Or has senility finally caught up with you?" He hated himself for his hurtful words, but he was fighting to regain his balance, his integrity, his distance.
Once again he manhandles John; this time dragging him along the corridor by their joined hands, leaving their hats abandoned.
"Is that so, John?" John can hear the smirk in Sherlock's voice and it's only as he's drifting off to sleep that he realises that his words could be taken in quite a different way to how he'd meant them. A half smile on his lips, John finally gives in and sleeps.
"Straight back to work is it then Sherlock?" Despite the flush still colouring his skin, John is now all seriousness. "
Mary shakes her head and Sherlock is surprised and a little maliciously pleased to see that she is pale and pensive, her hands squeezed protectively between her knees; it’s the most anxious that Sherlock can ever recall seeing her.  Perhaps she believes she may yet be facing time in prison, he muses before deciding it is of no matter to him, he ran out of sympathy for Mary when she hurt John.
221B is silent except for the noise emanating from that kitchen as John puts a tea tray together, obviously trying to delay the moment of finding out just how duplicitous Mary has been. Finally John returns to the living room, putting the tray down and politely asking Anderson how he takes his tea before handing Sherlock his mug, removing his own and taking the tray back into the kitchen. The sound of John opening and closing cupboards and the fridge as he puts the tea stuff back away drifts back into the living room.
"I'd imagine pushing you flat on your back."  Rising from his knees Sherlock licks a long, lingering stripe up John's neck.
" 'She'? So you know who it is? And you're only now telling me?" Greg moves so that he is sitting up straight in his chair, arms folded defensively across his chest.
“Was that one of Mycroft’s men I saw earlier?” She queries, jiggling Rosie slightly and causing her to giggle; both men devoutly believe that particular noise to be amongst the best sounds in the world.
John glanced up and met Sherlock's delighted gaze for a moment before both men started giggling, their bodies shaking so much they were at risk of spilling their drinks. After a minute or so, John was able to study the cameo fully, cradling it gently in his hands. "It's very beautiful Sherlock, utterly unique, something to be treasured." Wrapping it back up, John passed it back to Sherlock, their fingers briefly touching in the exchange.
For a long time Sherlock remains awake, his mind busy even as his body relaxes.  This morning he believed that he and John would only ever be friends; this evening he has everything he could ever want.  Far more than he feels he deserves; he’s not an idiot - despite what his brother may think - he is not going to turn down a relationship with John.
"You misunderstand me, Sherlock." John placates, running his hand over the curve of Sherlock's bicep.
Sherlock feels himself nod, but it almost feels as if he is watching all this happen to someone else.  He can hardly believe what he can see on John's face.  Love, devotion, passion and openness, nothing hidden.  He feels himself growing light headed, John steadying him.
"Most assuredly." Sherlock's voice is wicked and John feels the dark throb of it directly in his groin, his cock heating and filling from nothing more than a kiss and a few heated words. He knows in the depths of his soul, that Sherlock is going to consume him, devour him; and, God help him, he can't wait.
“Who hurt you?” John demands again, his brows furrowed, his features suddenly intent. “I’ll kill them.”
On their return to the flat, John heads into the kitchen expecting Sherlock to either head off to Bart's to examine his evidence or to throw himself into the relevant investigations here. Determined to grab some lunch and a cuppa before Sherlock takes over the kitchen, John moves with single-minded purpose, only pausing when he senses Sherlock standing in the doorway. Sherlock is intently reading something on his phone, a frown between his brows, before he finally lifts his head and meets John's eyes. For a moment, the two men just share the space, slow breaths mingling in the slightly stale air of the kitchen. Finally Sherlock takes a deep breath and turns abruptly, leaving the room.
"Does that make you happy, love?"  The endearment slips from John's lips like air, caressing Sherlock's skin before making its way to his heart, to be forever cherished.
"I was 15 for my first real kiss. His name was Morgan Lloyd-Jones, a good Welsh boy recently transferred to my school and I loved listening to the way he spoke. The way the words played on his tongue and came out all rich and rolling. One day I decided I wanted to know what it felt like to be those words and I dragged him - willingly I might add - to a secluded part of the school and proceeded to kiss him. It started out sloppy and vaguely disgusting but Morgan knew what he was doing and I'm an extremely quick learner. After that we'd often disappear and kiss, he'd whisper in my ear, knowing the effect it had, hoping to get into my pants, which he never did. Before long, he got fed up with being 'led on' called me a frigid freak and went and got his girlfriend pregnant."
John watches as Sherlock stands, graceful as always. With quick, efficient movements, Sherlock undoes his trousers and pushes them down, bending to remove them and his shoes and socks. He then takes the time to fold his trousers carefully, leaving them draped over a nearby chair, before sliding into bed next to John.
Sherlock wonders for how long he will be allowed this small intimacy once John starts to fully recover.
“Ok there, love?  You seem miles away.”  John slowly releases Sherlock’s hand, sliding his palm beneath Sherlock’s open coat and suit jacket, around Sherlock’s back until it rests, warm and distracting, just above the waistband of Sherlock’s trousers.
Their good mood lasts for the whole of the cab drive and through the hotel’s atrium. The atrium looks almost magical, warm white lights are wrapped around the wrought iron balustrades and fresh holly wreaths and swags decorate the wooden panelling.
Mrs Hudson wonders if tonight is the night that John finally admits to how he feels, both to Sherlock and fully to himself. They say a final goodbye to Mrs Hudson and Rosie, chuckling like school-boys as they dodge around the car Mycroft has sent and slip in to the nearest cab.
“OK. Right.” He sniffs, his face stern. “Do we know why she was there? What Magnussen has over her? He's a master blackmailer, after all.” John avoids the fact that Mary had almost succeeded in killing Sherlock; he remembers now that Sherlock had flatlined on the operating table. It’s all too much for him to take in currently, so he ignores it. For now.
Lifting his weight off Sherlock, John holds his hand out, pulling Sherlock up and into a deep embrace.  He gently walks Sherlock backwards until his legs bump into the edge of their bed.  John holds them there and deepens the kiss, chasing Sherlock's tongue with his own.  Lowering his hands to rest on the curve of Sherlock's arse, John marvels anew that he is now allowed to touch this wonderful man.  It may have been several years in coming but John is determined they will savour every moment from here on in.  Sherlock grows restless in John's arms, the desperate cant of Sherlock's hips against his own now very apparent, the broken gasps against his neck where Sherlock has buried his face raising goosebumps on his skin.
"Inside these walls I know that your actions will not reach the attention of Ms Morstan but please, Doctor Watson, Sherlock, keep any behaviour that may suggest John's lack of eventual return to her behind locked doors. I believe we are coming to the end of a very long game, it would be a pity to mess it up now."
"Well I'll be damned, that obnoxious arse knows something after all!" John interrupts, stunned that it was Anderson, of all people, that worked out that Sherlock was alive. "And the crimes being solved, they were you?"
"Unfortunately, not." Mycroft is, once again, the one to tackle the subject. "We suspect she had an alliance of some sort with James Moriarty but we have been unable, at this current time, to pinpoint what. We have heard through various sources, rumours that Moriarty is about to become active again."
"I really want to kiss you Sherlock, but your poor lips are too tender." John's gaze is fixed on Sherlock's mouth, a glimpse of his tongue enough to cause Sherlock to tremble in his hands. Slowly, John presses lingering kisses to his forehead, to the bridge of his nose, along each cheek bone and finally to the corners of Sherlock's full lips. They both sigh as their foreheads rest against each other and Sherlock feels more whole than he can ever recall feeling. "Now, you need to get better so that I can kiss you properly. I want to find out if that mouth of yours really does feel as good as it looks."
He nods his farewell to Janine and John and offers his arm to Lady Smallwood, who accepts it with distracted grace before being lead on to the dance floor.
A soft smile pulls at his lips and, interestingly, the tips of his ears turn red as he meets Sherlock’s eyes.
For weeks now John is certain he has been seeing signs of interest from Sherlock but he keeps convincing himself that he is seeing these signs because he wants to see them, not because they are actually there.
For a moment Sherlock hesitates before wrapping his arms loosely around John, resting the palm of one hand at the small of John’s back, the other drifting up to rest lightly between John’s shoulder blades. They sway to the music for a while, just enjoying each other’s company, the gap between them gradually decreasing until barely any space exists.
“No.”  The word is quiet but no less vehement for it, the full force of Sherlock’s glare now focuses on the nurse who, to his credit and Sherlock’s unspoken surprise, refuses to back down.
"I'm leaving her Sherlock. How can I forgive a woman who tried to kill my best friend in cold blood? A woman who knew too well what your death would do to the man she supposedly loves but did it anyway? I don't care what it says on that bloody memory stick. I ceased to love her the moment I found out she shot you, and truth be told I never loved her as a man should love the woman he intends to spend his life with. I was too broken to see the truth behind it until you came back, and then too stubborn to admit the truth of it to myself. I should never have married her. That was cruel to the woman I thought she was. I wasn't free to give my heart to her."
Sherlock is so lost in the scent of John that he doesn't immediately notice when John starts to stir, the sound of a sleepy chuckle breaking through his musings.
After what may be hours (and is at least five episodes of Doctor Who) John finds his attention being required once more.
This chapter should help to clear up that rather mean chapter I left you with, well a little anyway.......
Annnnnnnd the wonderful Lockedinjohnlock has reached over halfway with her beautiful beta work! Honestly this lovely lady is a real treasure! She's on the other side of the world to me and yet we somehow manage to squeeze time in to do this!  (And she is the beta on an upcoming story of mine!)
"Look I really should go, it's getting late. I need to talk to Mary. I.... I .. Oh God." Sherlock had been at a loss what to say, his eloquent tongue once again failing him when it was faced with an emotional John.
He gives in to the temptation to hum along to the christmas carol that has been rattling around in his brain as he rinses and continues to do so as he prepares to shave, chuckling when he hears Sherlock start to hum along too, his rich baritone adding a pleasant edge.  John takes his time shaving, he had debated on growing some stubble for the party but didn't think he could cope with the itchy face.  When he has shaved thoroughly he reapplies his shaving soap and shaves again, he swipes a hand over his freshly shaven faced, appreciating the smoothness the extra effort has given him.  He takes a few moments to study himself critically in the mirror.  He’s never considered himself to be a handsome man but he has somehow grown in to his looks, his face and body are now slimmer and more defined than in his younger years, even taking in to account his time in the army.  His face, he admits, is prematurely lined and his hair is now a mix of honey-blonde and grey but he feels it adds a level of ruggedness to his appearance.
Mycroft finally faces her, his mouth turns down in barely disguised disgust.  “Given your very recent history with both my brother and Doctor Watson do you honestly believe I would allow you to remain here unsupervised?” His eyebrows rise up to his sparse hairline. “I am allowing you your freedom, for the time being, that is as far as my largesse goes.”
How could he have ever thought this man unfeeling? All of Sherlock’s emotions are clear to be seen if John had only bothered to look. He lets out one more low laugh before leaning up for a kiss, its duration is short because of their lack of breath but it lacks no tenderness for its brevity.
I'm running out of ways to thank my wonderful beta, Lockedinjohnlock, so, this time, I'll just say thank you for everything, you make me a better writer.
John pauses, sucking nervously on his lip. “Part of me very much wants to just sit back and let that happen, let Magnussen do his worst……. but I know that is my anger talking ….that once I calm down I’ll be horrified by my thoughts but I just want to live in a simpler time.
He closes his eyes and breathes through the worst of the pain, focussing on the sensation of Sherlock’s palm against his own.
John carefully helps Sherlock in, taking the time to ensure he is comfortable and covered as much as possible with his sheet. He lingers, apparently unwilling to move far away, before slowly moving closer and leaving a chaste kiss on Sherlock's cheek. Sherlock grumbles and, reaching out one long arm, draws John back towards him; he tilts his head in offering and sighs when John places his lips over his. The kiss itself is light, nothing more than the quick press of firm lips against his own fuller ones, but the contact helps Sherlock relax the last part into sleep and he is drifting off before John has even moved away.
The army doctor in him immediately recognising them for what they are, whip marks that were most-likely inflicted during Sherlock’s time ‘away’, if the amount of fading is anything to go by.
“Very much, thank you.”  Sherlock answers, unusually polite.  “It’s everything I ever hoped for.  I was wondering, though, if you have a beekeeper?  I saw some bee hives out on the far meadow yesterday, are they to do with the hotel?”
Hand in hand, every inch the image of young love despite their age, they stroll back to the hotel, their pace unhurried.  The foyer is quiet, lit with a warm subdued light that gently guides their way to the lift; the doors of which open with a muted swish and ping, welcoming John and Sherlock inside.
"I see lots of fluttering bugs with glowing arses, flying around our heads, but I'm afraid I don't see what is so wonderful about that!" He grins sheepishly. "Well, the kiss was rather wonderful."
"And..." Sherlock continues, smirking in John's direction. "He forgot the most important thing of all, the tea!" With an imperious twirl Sherlock falls into the nearest seat, somehow managing to maintain his dignity. John tries, and fails, to smother his small snort of laughter before sitting next to Sherlock on the sofa. Herr Brün is looking extremely confused by the exchange, probably writing it off as the famous English sense of humour. Mycroft, however, is looking even more smug than Sherlock, a worrying sight.
Sherlock can feel how his eyes prickle and knows that John must be able to see the tell-tale sign of repressed tears. "It truly is." He kisses the end of John's nose, startling a laugh from him. "But I believe we should give this Kalvinder person who took Mary's scan a call, something just doesn't ring true for me there."
Huge thanks to my beta, Lockedinjohnlock for her support and guidance and being brave enough to tell me when something doesn't quite work.  My writing is hugely better for her support and influence.
“That’s unlikely to happen.”  Sherlock is quiet for a moment, thinking things for over.  “So, this is all on Mycroft’s bankroll?”  Sherlock has mixed emotions about this; on the one hand, he has always been free and easy with Mycroft’s money, but on the other hand, it somehow feels wrong that John is romancing him on his brother’s payroll.
After long moments Sherlock leads John over to the sofa, drawing him down to sit next to him, for a while they just share body heat, leaning into each other, seeking and receiving comfort and strength.
They sleep, undisturbed, until mid-morning when hunger and awareness of Sherlock's medication requirements rouse John. He stretches and dons one of Sherlock's dressing gowns, dropping his phone, unchecked, into the deep pocket. He moves around their kitchen, gathering together breakfast, re-using a tray from last night, leaving the dirty dinner plates to be dealt with later. Food settled on the tray, John heads back into the bedroom to wake Sherlock.
and it’s only then that I notice the tear tracks imprinted on his cheeks. We are still briefly before he decides to speak:
Sherlock just stands there for a few seconds, clearly unwilling to admit defeat. Mary is invisible. “Fine.” So that’s that.
“No, I didn’t, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis. Don’t really need to check that the angle’s consistent with self-harm, do I?”
“I met you—thanks to Mike—” I gesture to him in his seat, he grins proudly, “exactly six years ago today, when I was at one of the lowest points I’d ever been. You, for some reason, wanted me to not only be your flatmate, but your colleague, and eventually your friend. I’ve since found out we both wanted more than that, but we’re pretty rubbish at feelings, it seems.” I clear my throat again, trying to push down the emotions bubbling up.
But no, John slept through the night. Sherlock decides not to mention it this time, but there’s weight in his chest that feels hopeful and melancholy.
Finally, he sees a water droplet fall onto the light grey concrete beneath him, and he realises that it is coming from his eyes.
“Quite,” I whisper. I know that this cannot be the end. I know he is not supposed to actually kill me. I know that Moriarty has planned every moment of this exchange, but I have to play the game to complete the puzzle.
“You know what?” He says suddenly, shredding me away from my own thoughts. “I’m getting a little impatient.” He lowers my bed so I’m lying horizontally and looms above me. “Take a big breath, if you want.” And he begins to smother me.
I pay for and get my coffee, and we sit at a small table in the cafe. Time to get down to business, then.
He’s turned away from me, towards the window. I see his face lit by moonlight and reach out to shake his shoulder.
“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it? The dead can’t speak, Sherlock.” Never in my life has hearing my name made my ears ring.
“All day you have been observing me with the equal intensity in which I observe a crime scene,” he commented as he lifted the covers to lie beside me and turned off the lamp on his bedside table.
It’s been a week since Sherlock shot Magnussen in the face and was put in a jail cell, alone. It took less than a minute for me to regret what I said.
“Oh! You must be Dr. Watson, then! Tell me, is living with him as interesting as you make it seem?” she hopped between subject matter at a baffling pace.
“John Watson, do you take Sherlock Holmes to be your husband?” The word is remarkable, beautiful, perfect, everything I wanted; the word is made to be attached to Sherlock.
The reception is planned for Angelo’s, which we rented out for the evening. He’s going to be at the ceremony as well.
If the only lightsource they have wasn’t a flashlight in a cup, John might be more certain that he catches Sherlock smiling at him whenever he cheers with success. It's different, seeing Sherlock smile at night, in dim lighting and no one but John around. Sure, he smiles at school sometimes. A little grin in the corner of his mouth, a tiny symbol that he’s managed to make John smile or laugh in the halls. But out here, in the dark, alone, Sherlock’s smile takes on a separate form. It spreads across his face, it crinkles the sides of the eyes, it raises his cheeks, it takes over the often detached, contained expression and becomes something of a different nature. The softness of his face takes centre stage, and shows a side of him that few people believe to even exist. John’s only seen it when they’re alone.
I get a phone call from Molly one day asking if I want to go out for a cup of coffee, and I say yes. It’s been far too long since I’ve spent time with people that aren’t Mrs. H, Sherlock, or Lestrade.
Upon turning the water on for a shower, John makes certain that it’s as hot as he can manage without burning himself before stepping in. He washes off the booze and the sweat from the night before, but most important, he washes off the memories of the dream he had.
Wow!! Only one chapter left to go!! The twelfth will be a fast forward into Holmes and Watson's lives 30 years after the Wilde verdict, so I truly hope you all have enjoyed the 11 chapters of this story so far. I want to write more fics in the future about other aspects of their timeline, so please let me know if that is something you would be interested in.
“Sherlo…” he mumbles. For a moment I think he might be awake and know I’m here, but he starts wrestling around again and whimpering quietly. That means—Oh.
Holmes returned to his original position atop my torso, and all felt balanced in our world. In that moment, we did not think about the terrifying trial between Oscar Wilde and the Marquess of Queensberry. We did not concern ourselves with the dangers outside our small, temporary living quarters. In the short minutes before sleep overtook us, all that occupied our minds was one another.
“John.” The way Sherlock says it sounds like a wish, a prayer, almost. Like he’s asking for nothing and everything all at once.
The guests should be arriving in two hours, and Mrs. H is setting up the decorations in the foyer with Molly as we speak.
There is a rather intense level of protectiveness John feels towards his friend, but it is in no way unnecessary. In the short few months they’ve known each other, there have been a dozen incidents in which nasty notes and comments have been left in their wake. As they have gotten closer, it has become harder for John to resist retaliating in some way. He knows where that nasty impulse comes from, though, so he tries his best to kill it.
John spits. I’ve never seen him so angry. “Got it all on phone records.” He waves his phone that’s still on call with mine in front of him.
“John, you ran five blocks from the pier and left all of your stuff behind. What could you have possibly seen that would make you run that fast, that far?”
“Wonderful to see you, Miss Bennett,” I replied with a smile. Pepper followed wordlessly behind her friend, and the moment she caught sight of Holmes further within the parlour, she bounded towards him to pull him into a tight embrace. I could see the taken aback expression upon his face for a brief second before returning the gesture to the young girl.
“You still managed about 9 hours of sleep, though. You were tired.” Sherlock keeps his head turned towards the window. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon. I look at my hand.
Rather than getting an answer of words, I felt his thin arm reach around my back. My defensive mind forced me to make certain of what Holmes undoubtedly was already aware of; no one could be seen for miles. I leaned into him and laced my arm around his back as well.
I hear him approach the front door downstairs and rush to perfect a few details before bolting to the bedroom.
The weeks that pass without seeing Sherlock are filled with buying things for the baby. We set up the nursery, I paint the walls. She sets up the bookshelf. It’s
Sherlock comes out of the kitchen the next morning (must be 5:15, but he didn’t sleep at all) and sees John conked out on the sofa, just there. And it’s so simple. Of course John would fall asleep, he’s accidentally slept on the sofa before for midday naps with Rosie or for 20 minutes when they were working through the night and he couldn’t keep his eyes open. It’s not new. But he’s never slept all night and never not gone home. He was careful usually, wanted to make sure rosie went to bed in her room every night and or there was always something to do at home.
Something overtakes John. The buildup, the events of the night, the pressure of fingers pressing into his skin, all of it. He is consumed by it, this dark, thick, fiery
His eyes meet mine and I swear he’s never looked older in his life. The wear and tear of his years weighs upon him more visibly than ever before.
I look at him for a long moment, then clear my throat to speak. “Why are you letting me be cruel to you?”
James stands up, offering a hand to his son. As if the abuse he spewed just moments ago was nothing but a dream. John took the offer after a second of hesitance, knowing the penalty for declining would be much worse. He feels his father—the snake, cunning, conniving—pats him on the shoulder with a
“I admit that I am having trouble understanding why you accepted a mere burglary case so far outside of London. Is that brilliant mind already wavering in your fourth decade?” I teased a bit to hide behind the inquiry of it. He knew my implication.
As I finished this chapter up, I got more emotional about it than I thought I would. The catharsis of their lives and circumstances throughout this story came directly from my heart in so many ways, and I cannot begin to say how much they mean to me. I hope that was clear from the reader's point of view.
“They are rather analogous to you and I,” I said with confidence. My words finally brought my lover’s attention to me, turning away from the mirror with a snide grin.
“Sherlock!” he whisper-yells. Nothing. He goes to collect the pebbles from the ground to toss them up there again, and his aim improves over the next three throws. One hits the plastic surrounding the opening, another, hits the glass again, and finally the last goes through and lands in Sherlock’s room.
“I thought you’d never ask,” he says plainly. There is a weight to the statement. It fills the room.
“And how do you plan on convincing your mum and dad of that one?” John inquires teasingly. Sherlock, however, is 100 percent serious. He straightens his posture and makes his voice just
John leans in just enough and kisses him and the world holds still for a moment as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are finally kissing one another after all this time. John feels his heart skip a beat. Sherlock holds John’s face in his hand. After holding still
“The danger’s gone now, isn’t it? Just in our ruddy dreams now,” For once in our entire acquaintance, it’s true. I nod to him and finally meet his eyes. They are already planted on me.
People try to comfort me but getting out of bed is too much work. If Mary trickles in and out I do not notice. If my phone vibrates from a call or a text, I cover my ears.
“Let him,” Lestrade confirms. They resign and agree, ushering me inside. I silently thank him. “Sherlock, I’ll follow behind and meet you there, okay?” I nod and sit beside John on the way to hospital once again.
It seems to go on like this for hours, years, millenia, before James Watson gives up. He falls to the floor beside his bloody, battered son and laughs. The sound makes John’s ears ring.
“I am afraid, my dear Watson, that this is precisely the result I anticipated.” The words break my heart. His tone is defeated, lacking the enthusiasm I experienced from him just days prior. Perhaps he was allowing himself to forget the reality of it all for a time, or simply detaching from our life in London. Now, however, he was far beyond aware. Now, he was afraid.
He looks over at me and his eyes pierce my skin. “I’m not going to be able to beat this one on my own, John.” I haven’t heard him say my name in over a month. My chest feels heavy and painful.
I was not cross or angry with him by any means, no. If I was angry at anyone, it was the Marquess of Queensberry, as he was the one who caused the man I love to be terrified of the one city he calls home. Whilst I enjoy holidays, and am accustomed to living anywhere due to my military background, Holmes dislikes change. This was true then and remains true now. The Marquess, as well as the courts of the United Kingdom, were endangering Holmes’s, as well as my own, ability to be content in our home. He was already becoming rather restless at the inn we inhabited at Hatherleigh, but we stayed there for a mere few days. Now, with a second trial imminent, there was no way to tell when my companion and I could return to 221B.
He shifts up a bit to look at me, “It was quite real,” he swears in a mock serious tone. I stare at him for second before we both go into a fit of laughter over how ridiculous this discussion is.
“And that it would be even more useful if said person had access to high quality CCTV surveillance, as well as connections to foreign governments to negotiate with in his criminal interests?”
Sherlock, I know you’re reading this even though you might try to deny it from the other room. And I know as well that you may be reading it, thinking that I’m overly romantic or something.
When I was still young and lonely, I’d thought it impossible to ever be at peace enough to give up high-stakes, adrenaline heavy work that constantly made my brain work. So full of self hatred that the idea of stopping terrified me. When I started to reject cases to instead visit a museum with my husband (something warm fills me up even saying it still), or to stay at home and read a book, retirement becomes a thought in the back of mind.
He takes a deep breath and looks at me, eyes bloodshot and raw, cheeks flushed and soft. I could swear I’ve never seen him so beautiful.
Before I can think further, Sherlock’s body is separating from mine and taking tiny steps away from me. The weight in my chest turns painful. He lets one hand remain on my forearm and I wish it would stay forever.
for the love of God, look at the man actually still with us in this world first.” The medic nods willingly in response and heads over to me and John.
We try to go back to normal for the next week. Normal all except for the fact that John sleeps in my bed for three days and I kip on the sofa. The illusion of routine is shattered when I hear John screaming and panting on his first night back in his upstairs room.
surrounding myself with boring dates with women I felt nothing for. I’ve tried my hardest especially in my time knowing Sherlock, to hide behind that false identity. I shouted across rooms that I “am not gay,” without a moment’s thought. He wasn’t necessarily there to hear all of them, of course, but he certainly heard enough of them.
Sherlock shuts his eyes again to process and opens them again a minute later. He almost looks relieved that I’m still there. He brings his forehead back to mine.
After another minute, his breathing slows and his eyes shutter open. It takes John a moment to see me.
“I WILL NOT HAVE A DYKE IN MY HOUSE!” The sentence is an explosive, burning everything in its wake. John has a sense of knowing, knowing that this conversation is no more than an inevitability that he could have foreseen with ease. But seeing it play out in front of him, on Christmas Eve, somehow makes him feel even more sick than he’s anticipated before.
Our walk along the Newton Brook utterly alleviated my existing concerns, yet the moment I saw Mycroft’s name upon a small letter at our cottage, all my worry returned. Surely it was yet another update on current trial proceedings, and I was ill-equipped for the truth. Holmes opened the envelope with a certain care and focus that put my nerves on edge. He was methodical and stoic, often how he behaved at the most dangerous of crime scenes.
“No one’s ever made me breakfast in bed before,” I mumble. John gives me a look (not quite pity… love? Is that what that looks like?), before setting the tray delicately on the floor. He leans over, takes my face in his hands, and leaves two gentle kisses on my cheeks. He leaves a warmth behind there, my face heating under his lips.
Ever since the two boys met at the start of Year 10, John spent many evenings a week at the Holmes residence. Both of Sherlock’s parents are always unbelievably kind to John, and no one has ever questioned why it is that he wishes to eat dinner with a family separate from his own multiple nights a week. It seems as if Violet Holmes already understood from the moment she first saw him, but never acknowledges it with anything more than a soft smile and a welcoming cup of tea.
Sherlock takes a deeper breath and his body shakes a bit on the exhale. I suppose that’s the only answer I’m getting.
“Listen to me. One of those dead people is a trained assassin who shot the man on the floor,” he points at John. “And the other is a psychopathic serial murderer. So
The false sense of comfort that is ever present in Mycroft’s government vehicles and offices is more prominent than usual. The matte leather seats appear almost sticky and I feel ill just considering that
I hope this fic made any sorrows you have about series four lessen just slightly. I hope that what I've done here did the characters you know justice, and please let me know if it has.
“I would argue that you may be even more so,” I teased. The smirk upon Holmes’s face grew wider, and he brought his right hand up to my jaw to pull me into a kiss. His lips were soft against my own and the weight of the day melted with each second. When we separated, our eyes met and the world surrounding us ceased to exist for a brief second.
After reading the hastily written words, I looked up to my companion, only to find his eyes on my own.
On top of the court’s verdict, there was my knowledge of the sinister crime I had committed in Englishcombe. It was self defense, yes, though a part of me sinks with the moral conflict rushing through my head. A man as vile as Burdett deserves a fate befitting of his personality, but I felt too biased to be the one responsible for that punishment. As I contemplated further, I heard the cries from the Old Bailey courtroom on the morning of May 25. Of a public shouting the oh so complex word:
“I started getting nightmares about 6 months ago. Sometimes I’m a child, other times I’m 18, other times I’m my age now. I don’t know if that means anything, Mr. Holmes.”
We’ve silently crossed a precipice into something else that is only somewhat clear to me. I allow myself to rest closer to the middle than to the side, and John follows suit. We’re not touching, but it’s a near thing. I’m tentative to turn my head to look at him, feeling his eyes on me. But his presence beside me calms something deep I have yet to recognise. Before John doses off completely, he mumbles:
“Yes, God, Sherlock, yes, of course I will.” He smiles back to me and lets out a breathy laugh, full of nerves. He quickly slips the ring onto my finger (perfect fit, of course) and he kisses me. It’s tender and wonderful and I swear that all the light in the world exists only between the two of us. I have spent far too much time doing things other than promising my life to Sherlock Holmes, and I don’t want to spend another day apart from him. I would say yes tomorrow, next week, in 20 years I would say yes every time. I didn’t know until not very long ago that
It takes exactly 38 minutes before I notice the wall opposite me slowly edge open, revealing Culverton Smith.
“I have never once been ashamed to love you,” he said in a hush. Of all the things he may have said to me in that moment, those words were quite possibly the least expected, yet most comforting. I covered his hand with my own, relishing in his warmth.
Have to sound overly carefree when the circles under my eyes are dark enough to look like the shadow left behind of the daughter I never had and a wife I never loved.
Mary will call. John will not answer. She will worry. He will dream of him before he ever dreams of her.
Clench my first. I pretend not to notice her scowl at me. I realize I’m holding a piece of paper she handed to me with words she remembers on it. I sniff it. Garlic.
There is a white heat behind John’s eyes, but it isn’t with the same as the blinding rage from last night. It’s quiet, and accompanied by a pain in his chest that he isn’t used to feeling in front of Sherlock. He can’t pinpoint it before words continue to fall out of his mouth.
I hope this full and complete conclusion gives you peace and makes up for any sadness still left over. It's no longer 1895, and Holmes and Watson deserve to live happily in every possible adaptation.
I hope that this was enjoyable for all of you reading as it was for me writing it. These characters mean the world to me, and this part of their story is the closest to my heart compared to all the rest. Whether you play the Sherlockian Game with the canon timeline like I do, or just enjoy these two being soft with one another, please let me know how you felt about this subject matter and the way I told this story.
“Think I just did, didn’t I?” Fake it ‘till you make it’ is  a saying, right? “I’m sure that was me.”
“I-I think I’m in love with you too, John.” John stops breathing for a moment, then remembers he must keep breathing because he lives in a world where Sherlock Holmes loves him back.
I chuckle and kiss his head of curls. Somehow it’s been a matter of hours and there’s an ease between us unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. “If only.”
I don’t sleep much, only when my body gives in and I have to. I change John’s dressings twice. My mind races to think of what might be possible now that the cause behind 5 years of torment is gone.
“Most of the time when I got upset like that it was because I wanted to go to bed with you and I couldn’t,” deadpan. As if it’s not both the funniest and most wonderful thing he’s ever said at the same time.
His lips formed into a small smile, one for my eyes alone, and the two of us walked back to our private quarters.
“You can’t pretend like that didn’t just happen. You scared the shit out of me!” She sits next to him and tries to touch him again, this time on the knee. He accepts with little but an internal reluctance.
John and I decided that the suits would match, but not be identical. So, my waistcoat is black with indigo lining, and my tie is indigo. John’s waistcoat is the same blue with black lining, and a black tie. No boutonnieres, just simple and elegant.
“Tomorrow, I’ll let it resume rotating for a bit. After that, I refuse to leave this bed. For at least two days,” he declares with a sense of finality.
“Come to scold me again, big brother?” My words lack the bite I want them to have. It’s okay, though. Don’t care about anything like this, do I?
All I could manage was a silent acknowledgement, shutting my eyes with emotional torment. I launched myself into his arms—a horizontal equivalent to my actions of the night before—as I regained my breath. Soothing affirmations lingered from Holmes’s lips and the world returned to sanity. After many moments of stillness, he spoke.
I hope you like this more relaxed chapter, it was very nice to write. Any feedback is always welcome, and kudos/comments are always appreciated
“Well,” I forced, “It is more than many can gather.” I wanted, more than anything in the world, to move to a separate topic entirely. I wished to escape back to the brook we occupied just half an hour ago, yet I knew it was impossible to avoid this forever.
Mycroft just stares at him for a moment. I know what he’s trying to imply, and it’s horrifying. A rage boils in the pit of my stomach.
“You don’t get to swaddle me like I’m a fucking baby bird, okay? I can handle my insane fucking dad without you and your mum lying for me. I’m fine, I’ll be fine, I’m—”
On the morning of his 17th birthday, John is shaken awake by the thin, spidery hand of someone familiar.
“You are truly magnificent,” I stated as fact. His reaction was not what I was looking for, though. Instead of happy, he looked minorly confused.
Sometimes I dream of her. I dream of her running around the park with a daisy tucked behind her ear and she yells, “Daddy, daddy, follow me!” before I catch her up in my arms and raise her up towards the sky. I wake up with a pool of tears on my pillow and curl into myself to make it better.
Miss Bennett frowned, placing a hand upon Miss Sampson’s knee. “Are you in a similar thought as myself, Mr. Holmes, about the inevitable conclusion to a trial this grim?”
Sometimes, I go into the surgery and it reminds me of that night just a few months ago. The lights start to burn my eyes and the sounds of medical equipment moving around the hallways makes my ears ring. I have to leave early, stumble over apologies and excuses as I squirm my way out of the office. I go back to the always empty house, and I pour myself a drink.
John shakes his head of the fog in front of his eyes and looks up at Sherlock. For a second, or half of one, John sees the gloss of tears around Sherlock’s eyes. A care and concern and maybe—something else lines his face. Ignoring what he sees, John grabs the back of his own head and feels for a bump, or blood, but he can’t quite distinguish between water and blood at the moment.
“Hello, Mr. Watson,” Sherlock says with his typical false confidence voice. John holds his breath, stopped in his perch like a bird, helpless to the will of its predator.
“Indeed,” Holmes agreed. “Please, ladies, do sit down. Watson, is there any tea remaining from breakfast?”
“It was my idea, Mrs. Holmes. I should have known better, I’m sorry,” John interrupts, drying his hair on the towel carefully, making sure to check if he’s bleeding.
The two of us reached the inn’s dining room, greeted with tremendous smells of mince and shepherd’s pies, sausages, and roasted potatoes. The combination of scents reminded me of Mrs. Hudson’s meals in Baker Street and brought warmth to my chest.
“You promised me there was nothing else,” I butt in finally. Done being passive. Done letting this just be between them. “You
“Hm. It might.” I realize she handed me her phone to show me a picture of her father. She’s at least 5 years younger in the picture.
A few tears escape onto my cheeks and I cup his face, smiling. He reaches into his inner jacket pocket and pulls out a small, dark wooden box. It clicks open to reveal a ring (steel, lined with black, it’s lovely), and he takes it out, looking at me.
He slowly moves his hand up to cover my arm and keeps his grip on me. We look at one another for a long moment, and then the doors are opening and the EMT’s and Lestrade are coming towards us.
I decide to take a part-time job working as a medical consultant for a homeless shelter. It doesn’t pay wonderfully, but it’s interesting and important work, so I do what I can. It’s also taking us a bit to get back to taking cases regularly. Sherlock promises me we’ll only take milder ones for a while (maybe forever), and I believe him. He doesn’t get those fits of boredom he used to.
“It’s alright,” I mumble to him, still holding his face in my hand; contradicting the tears he is wiping away from my cheeks himself.
I found his words to be much more removed than he typically was with me while in the privacy of one another’s space. He spoke about it as he often spoke to clients. A frank, unemotional tone. This only added to the pain I was feeling, and I could not stand it.
“I suppose you are right,” I said, beaming. I took a singular step closer to my lover and met my lips to his. Holmes brought his grip up to my nape, maintaining the kiss with a listless pace. Many minutes passed, and by the time we separated, there was significant colour in my cheeks. Holmes leaned his brow against my own and took a deep inhale.
“I’d like to think… I’d hope at least, that you consider me a friend. And friends are here for one another, right?” She looks up at me to attempt to get some approval, and continues. “I don’t want to seem like I’m overstepping or something, so tell me if I’m saying more than I should but… I think you move back to 221B.”
“What were you doing to him?!” he demands. “What were you doing?!?” Before Culverton could feasibly respond, John shoves him towards Lestrade. “Restrain him, now.”
“Hey,” Sherlock greets him in a voice John misses so much more than he can anticipate every time he doesn’t see him for a few days.
Smith sighs and looks down, but the grief seems plastic, forced. Nothing close to what I feel. It makes something red and angry boil in my chest.
She tells me she pulled the gun Sherlock was waving around back onto him and handcuffed him into the boot of her car (an Aston Martin? My god) which she proceeded to drive directly to my doorstep. She opens the boot and I see him, curled in on himself and trembling with, fear? drugs? both?
“I don’t have a coat,” she’s clearly annoyed with me. Reasonable. Try to push her away. Walk to the kitchen.
I only now notice Mary filling the seat beside me. She feels like a curse. The curse who just happens to be my wife, who happens to be carrying my child, who
Sometimes I dream of him, though. Innocent things. Holding hands while we walk home from a case. Whispers in an alleyway on a stakeout. Laughing after the adrenaline pumps through us and I kiss him in the foyer. But it goes dark. I start seeing Mary laughing and ridding the world of him and my daughter all in one fell swoop and my room feels bitterly cold when I shudder awake.
Instead of Sherlock’s reply that he expects, Violet’s voice echoes up the staircase, a protective barrier covering the flightless bird above. He spots the heel of Sherlock’s foot, backing away from the door.
I throw my phone across the room and shove my face into my bed. I’ll need to take another hit in 20 minutes.
“Less than two minutes, my dear Watson. Do not fret,” he replied. “I simply did not wish to disturb your thoughts.”
“You see, Mr. Holmes, I have a need to confess. Part of Jim and I’s business arrangement is that he needs people killed and I need to confess to those who can stay quiet.”
“He—Sherlock—brought me a fresh cup of water on the hour, every hour, the entire bloody night,” I say. “I tried to go into the room she was in probably 20 times and each time I ran back and there he was, with a cup of bloody water.” I can’t quite say why I’m telling her this. Thankfully, she seems to know, and she reaches for my hand in the caring way she always manages to do things.
My breathing steadies and I move my head back to get a good look at him. There’s a vulnerability resting on Sherlock’s features I never thought I would be able to see before now. I can tell he’s overwhelmed—hell, so am I—so I wait to say anything for a bit.
This chapter gets pretty heavy, much heavier than the first. Tread lightly, but I hope you enjoy nonetheless.
It’s been a week since I threw the flashdrive into the fireplace of Sherlock’s parents house while I pushed the scripted, prepared words out of my mouth.
“Harriet, who said you could cut your hair like a dyke?” John and Catherine freeze. Harry looks up at her father, dumbfounded for a moment before her undying wit peeks through. Perhaps she thinks it’s safe right now. James Watson is holding a buzz from a night of mulled wine, that isn’t quite to the stage of violent drunkenness. Maybe it’s safe.
Sherlock stiffens, before turning to face John, his eyes widening at the sight. He takes a half step towards John, his right hand drifting out towards him, before swallowing hard.
“Sherlock.” John’s voice is gravelly, breathless and before he can say anything more Sherlock chases his lips for another kiss.  “Sherlock.  Love, we can’t do this here -.” His words are cut short as Sherlock presses their lips together again, his hips starting to undulate against John’s.  “Sherlock.”  John manages.  “We need to stop.  As much as I really, really want to carry on, this isn’t exactly a private place.”
A long moment passes between them before John finally breaks the tension by standing, flushing when he realises that his crotch is now completely at Sherlock's eye level, before he moves rapidly away. For a moment he thought he had seen something on Sherlock's face, something he has glimpsed before but never quite this clearly. Hunger. Specifically, a hunger for John. When he glances back, Sherlock's face is again casually blank and John writes it off to the imaginings of an over active, over tired, over libidinous mind.
John can take it no longer and reaches up to pull Sherlock in to a searing kiss, their lips parting on contact, tongue seeking the other’s.  John stumbles slightly as Sherlock wraps his arms around him, pulling a willing John against him.  John becomes suddenly aware of more than just where their lips touch.  Sherlock’s chest is heaving against his, warmth radiating from him in waves.  John’s hips press against Sherlock and he is aware that soon a very obvious sign of his arousal will be making itself known against Sherlock’s thigh.  With what feels like a colossal effort, John gently breaks the kiss and steps slightly away.
a detective.” John interjects, a small smile pulling at his lips.  “I’m a part-time doctor and full-time blogger who follows you around and pretends that he knows what on earth you are up to.”
Holmes’s fingertips on my sacrum snapped me back into reality as I realised we were back in our rooms. He was leading me through the threshold with a gentle touch.
Daggers. Thousands of daggers manage to break my skin while not existing at all. Pain covers my body like a disgusting blanket. It’s a cancer. I can’t breathe.
“Anything for the,” I pause to see him get even closer to the side of my bed. “Game.” I finish feebly.
John feels another leap in his chest before, “I think I’m in love with you.” He feels it exit the safety of his thoughts like a punch.
“John,” he responds in a whisper. He shuts his eyes and rests his head on my shoulder. I leave tiny imprints of my lips along his neck and we stand in each other’s space—content.
“Yes,” I reply with a hushed enthusiasm. “God, Sherlock, yes.” I lean forward again to cup his face in my hands. How could he have managed to see every detail of who I am except for the most important one? “I have for so long.”
The birds chirp carelessly and it feels hateful sometimes. As if the world is mocking me with its plethora of life. It’s starting to be spring, and it feels all too cheery.
Her words register for the first time, but he cannot make himself look at her. Once, twice, now three times he has tried to answer, but words will not manifest in his mouth. How can he articulate what just happened when he doesn’t know? What possible explanation is there for this?
By the time they finish everything and send us home, it’s well past midnight. Lestrade offers to drive us, and we’re both so exhausted that I hardly process the ride at all.
I shake my head with only a slight disbelief. “He’s done it before, why wouldn’t he do it again?” I hesitate for a moment, considering the man I have on the phone tucked under my thigh on this hospital bed. “So he truly is alive, then?”
It’s warm and safe. My empty, dark flat dances with life. I feel like everything is floating around me and my brain is finally calm.
at you. You didn’t even bring a coat, in this rain? Now, well, that might mean nothing, except for the angle of the scars on your left forearm; you know, under that sleeve that you keep pulling down.” Ooohhhhh.
I shut my eyes and take in another deep breath. I don’t know what else to say right now. I get up and make us more tea to do something with my hands.
I draw in a breath to ground myself after our short laughing fit and glance at him. He meets my eyes, and the room seems to pause along with us.
“I love you,” he returns, simply. We’ve said it thousands of times over the years. It is natural and everything that’s needed to erase the agony we’ve had to endure.
Seizing the brief opportunity being provided to him, John races up the stairs and closes his bedroom door in the noiseless way he’s learned to master over the years. Grabs his backpack, shoves as many clothes he can grab in two hands inside, takes as many of his things as he thinks he may need.
Over time, the conversation was able to turn to topics outside of avoiding the oppressive grip of the law. I shared stories of untold cases over newly poured cups of tea. Holmes told of his plans to study the habits of bees in relation to the queen. Miss Bennett and Miss Sampson re-told shared childhood memories in tandem. The sun traveled to the western part of the sky, and suddenly it was due time for our guests—now turned friends—to take the train to their accommodations in Whitchurch.
“I didn’t choose to come here, but I still need any help you can provide and I know that a distraction could do us both some good.” I hate that he’s right. The anger resurfaces yet again because he’s
John and Sherlock sit in their same spots as always, still shaking off giggles, then proceed to take out their coursework from the weekend. Sherlock pulls out multiple additional sheets with various chemical algorithms that he did to pass time, much to Mr. Sawyer’s chagrin. Their teacher weaves his way through the desks, picking up the work until he reaches Sherlock’s desk.
“Where the… f-fuck do you think you’re going, huh?” James Watson taunts his only son, pissed beyond hope of sobering.
“You’re hardly even conscious, you just overdosed on half a pharmacy’s worth of drugs, just— You’re going to the hospital,” I can’t seem to let go of his arm. He tries to budge to open ou-his front door.
“Oh, you…” I begin, but words don’t come. It’s the tiniest gesture, something I’ve heard other couples do all the time. Although it strikes a chord within me that I can’t seem to explain. John’s made me meals countless times in the past, but this is the first time he’s ever brought the meal to me within minutes of me opening my eyes. An overwhelmingly lifting and yet heavy affection fills me up and I have never been more thankful to have him
“I do pray I do not sound foolish or rude in asking you this, but it would be dishonest to say I have not wondered. If this trial may negatively affect you and Dr. Watson directly, why have you remained in England for this last month when it would be infinitely safer upon the Continent?”
“What are your predictions, Holmes?” I inquired with a gentle angle, acknowledging his likely unguarded emotional state.
Maybe some time in the next couple weeks, you lot. For some reason Sherlock’s being a grump about it.
“You must send her our new address, then. This is too important to waste time with such things,” I said.
It’s warmth at first. Lips touching lips. Then it’s tea, toothpaste, and toast. But once the surface fades, it is John. It’s John so fully and completely and I’m certain there is not one sensation in my entire life quite like kissing John.
John sits in a daze, coming to terms with just how absurd what just happened is. That his friend would lie for him is one thing, but his best friend’s
“Hi.” Sherlock looks a bit like a lost child, but he sits down next to me and stares forward. Trying to be the sane one here. He always was in the end, wasn’t he? I’m certainly not right now, that’s for bloody sure.
Sherlock tucks the paper into his jacket pocket and we both turn to Lestrade as he dries his eyes. He clears his throat to mask it.
punishing me for something.” He isn’t so much as asking John as he is asking the non-existent audience.
It makes the need for dying relax a bit. Makes the internal screams of wanting to make it all stop a bit softer.
“My dear brother,” Holmes read aloud. “The first criminal trial upon Mr. Wilde has commenced as of the twenty-sixth of April. Wilde has the same counsel as he did for the previous case, Sir Edward Clarke, and has pleaded ‘not guilty’ to the charge of gross indecency. As I write this, you are currently involved in a case at Oxford, however I have addressed it to where I know you shall be staying in Englishcombe in good confidence of what the results of said university trouble shall be.” At this sentence, my companion shared a swift, irritated glance with me. Of course Mycroft would know the solution to our case before even Holmes did. “Given my assistance to arranging all of your and Dr. Watson’s temporary lodgings as of late, I am confident my address is correct. There shall be another update in the following week.”
Our kiss deepens as time goes on. My hand goes to his neck, his hand goes to my hip. We stumble into his room, and the morning turns into afternoon.
He truly is a repulsive human being, I must admit. Whether or not he’s a serial killer, I’m unsure. He’s unreasonably obsessed with the works of H. H. Holmes, however. The man who created a hotel with the purposes of killing his guests for sport.
“John, this is your last birthday before adulthood, you can’t let a little headache keep us from having fun,” she says, attempting to sway him further. “C’mon, you can take some paracetamol and wear sunglasses, we can’t miss out on the good weather!”
“John,” Sherlock says, as if his name is a statement in and of itself, and rests atop John’s chest, looking up at him despite being the taller of the two.
On the way someone passes me, a bit too close. I only have a second to consider the bonfire incident this reminds me of before there’s chloroform in my face and I’m on the ground struggling to move.
“Sherlock,” Holmes began, looking at the paper. “As of the fifth of April, W has lost against Q. W awaits potential charges and a second trial. More news forthcoming, Mycroft.”
“I saw my father kill someone, Mr. Holmes,” Faith says. Oh. Interesting. “I know I saw it but, I can’t remember where or who or when.”
“It’s too heavy. You said I was your last hope and now you’re going out into the night with no plan on how you’re getting home... and a gun.” I see her cane.
A bit of jumbled mess, that is, isn’t it? Needless to say, after our first interaction that day I was quite mixed up in my own feelings. I’d been back home from Afghanistan for such a short time, and I didn’t think anything was going to happen. But, somehow Sherlock Holmes swooped in, almost hero-like, to make something happen; to save me from whatever rubbish hole I was falling down.
“Joooohn, come on, get up! The day’s already started and we’re losing precious time!” Mary Morstan, aged 17, tugs at John Watson’s covers with a fervency that he does not understand. He groans in response, trying to pull the covers over his hungover head to at least somewhat muffle his girlfriend’s pleas. He has always hated his birthday.
The creek behind the Holmes residence is quite modest, really, but it is large enough for John to attempt to skip rocks and look extra impressive when he manages it. He jumps around, as Sherlock sits perched up on a boulder watching.
“This isn’t for Mycroft.” Who was it for? Me? Himself? Why did he OD in the first place? My thoughts get more rushed as my body wakes up and my chest starts to ache again.
“You don’t have to treat me like a helpless animal, okay?!” I don’t even realise that I raised my voice at him.
“That would be lovely, yes. Thank you Dr. Watson,” Miss Sampson replied timidly from her seat beside her partner.
"Great! So, I married an assassin who not only has a damn good go at killing my best friend but fucks around too!" The words are loud in the small room and Sherlock's eyes dart to the corridor outside, it's empty but he can hear hushed voices coming from the nurses' station just down the hall. "Sorry, sorry." John apologises for his outburst, letting go of Sherlock's hands to cover his face with his palms. "God, I sound like a jealous husband. " He drags his hands down over his face and then rests them back on his thighs. Sherlock is surprised to see relief clearly displayed on John's face. "And I'm not, I'm really not. I'm praying that she has been unfaithful so that if there is a baby it's unlikely to be mine. What kind of man does that make me, Sherlock? Hmmm? I'm newly married and all I want is for my wife to have been screwing around so that I can get out of the worst mistake of my life and into my flatmate's pants!" John colours at his final words but doesn't deny them.
“I know exactly who you did it for. And why.” She flashes a grim smile in his direction before moving closer to John’s bed, resting her thigh close to his.
"Oh fuck! Jesus Christ! Sherlock.... I need you in me. Now." Pulling himself away John flipped himself onto his back and pulled Sherlock down to him. "That was bloody fantastic. Thankyou. Now lay on your back."
And then in moderate levels, just enough to show up in urine tests, not enough to impair me or cause addiction.”
“Pity, that was a very nice snooze.”  He yawns and stretches, before rolling up to a sitting position.  Surprised when Sherlock remains close, his hand drifting over John’s shoulder and down his arm before moving away.
, let’s go and have some lunch.”  John teases, grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling him out of the room.
John gathers up the photos from the floor, giving each a cursory glance before putting them back in the file. No face looks familiar to him and he swallows against the wave of disappointment.
"Mmhmm?" John’s mind is already drifting to how the results of his tests will alter the sexual explorations between him and Sherlock and a faint blush heats his cheeks.
Hello! Trying something a bit different.  I've been very busy relaxing recently, first beautiful West Wales and now London.  It has meant that my internet access has been sketchy at best! I finally have internet but I'm struggling to get the story to copy across which means I am re-typing the whole of this chapter (challenging with limited time and two daughters! One teen, one pre-teen) as such I am going to post only half of the chapter today and try my best to type up the rest very soon there after.
Sighing, John pads down the corridor towards Sherlock's bedroom. More information would be useful so he can pack accordingly. Upon reaching Sherlock's room he leans casually against the doorframe, watching the chaos that is Sherlock attempting to pack. Shirts and suits already lie crumpled on the bed, pants and socks are now joining them. John catches a flash of dark blue silk before Sherlock suddenly stills. A pained expression flicks across his face, gone before John can decipher its cause.
Sherlock leaves to get dressed and John makes short work of the washing up, surprising himself at how quickly he gets through it all. Before long he is up in his old bedroom donning his own clothes. A simple jumper, pants and jeans, he keeps the layering minimal, face heating a little when he acknowledges that the reason he keeps his clothing that way is to give Sherlock ease of access.
"Mmmm, that's so nice." John sighs, tipping his head forward in silent encouragement for Sherlock to continue with his ministrations. Sherlock brushes his lips over the soft skin and rests their linked hands over John's heart, he can feel the steady thump, thump through their joined hands. Slowly, Sherlock opens his eyes and turns John to face him, their hands now fitting snugly between their chests, his other hand resting on the curve of John's buttocks. Sherlock leans down and kisses John. The kiss is nothing more than a brush of lips against lips at first but then John parts his lips and grips more firmly at Sherlock's hand, his other hand sliding into the long hair at Sherlock's nape, guiding Sherlock's head down to deepen their embrace. As they kiss, the bathroom fills with steam from the shower and when they open their eyes again the room appears almost otherworldly and extremely private. This sense of privacy and the way that John is holding his hand so tightly against his heart finally gives Sherlock the bravery to say something that he has meant to say for so long. He rests his forehead against John's and breathes deeply of the scent of him.
