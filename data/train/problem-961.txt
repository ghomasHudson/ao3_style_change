Sherlock hummed again, and turned his head, letting go his thumb.
“Daddy. . .” Locky moans around his thumb.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, and slowly drew the stuffed dog away from his face. Now that his daddy had said the words for him, he was less bashful and met John’s eyes with his soft, guileless gaze. “Will you be sweet about it, please, Daddy? Can you just be sweet?”
“It’s
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
against Daddy’s lips—“
a whispered gasp as John gives Sherlock’s nipple a gentle pinch, pulls a bit, pinches harder.
More than his own stuff—of which there certainly was some; John knew he was not actually an abuser and never would be, but he was still working through the intellectual part of all that emotion he’d processed—John was really hanging onto to the fact that Sherlock had looked at him with wide, terrified eyes; Sherlock had wept and turned away from him; Sherlock had sounded small and ashamed and afraid; Sherlock had said
Sherlock kept quiet.
John’s arms were tight around him, protecting him, keeping him close and safe against his chest.
—then the other—
Sherlock shrugged as if he didn’t mind; John crossed to the little lamp on the far side of the room and switched it on, then went back to press the door closed with a decisive click before crossing to the bed and sitting on its edge. He laid his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and stroked down his arm as far as the edge of the blankets.
“And that’s not.” John rattled his fingers against the tabletop. “. . .
Sherlock picked up one of the candies, considered it for a moment, then set it back in the pile. He tucked Goggie over one shoulder, around the side of his neck and against his throat, and his head sank toward it a bit, like a pillow. In went the tip of the thumb, and John could hear the soft, wet noises of Sherlock’s thumbsucking as he leaned in to plant a few gently sucking kisses along the edge of Sherlock’s jaw.
“No?” John ran his fingers back up the length of Sherlock’s arm. “
“Good lad,” John told him, and squeezed his buttock, nestling his fingers closer into the cleft, pressing the tip of his ring finger against Sherlock’s tight little hole as he dug in. “You make me want to do so many lovely, dirty things. You’re so gorgeous, and so filthy.”
“That’s right. That’s the proper word. Most boys your age still use kid words. What did you call it when you were littler?”
In their bedroom, John stripped down to his boxers and sleeveless vest, then went into the bottom drawer of the wardrobe for an old dressing gown—not his usual one—which would, after tonight, definitely be going in the sack for the rag man. He rummaged a bit in the nightstand, then took a moment to smooth the bedding where he’d recently sat with Sherlock over his knee. He retrieved the now-dry, tear-stained tissue from where he’d thrown it on the duvet and dropped it in the little bin by the dresser, then turned back the top edge of the covers so the bed would be ready for them to slip into when they returned to it.
. . .”
“So?” Daddy reminds him he’s meant to be thinking about the toys he was offered.
“Not much.” Sherlock shrugged.
Locky loves his thumb, and he smiles as he slips it between his lips, then closes down tight around it. It fits just right in his mouth and he closes his eyes.
“Sweetheart, finish what you’ve got,” John reminded gently, and Sherlock left it, instead opened his book and started to page through.
. . .
John waved it away. “I don’t expect you to stop and take my temperature while you’re working, Sherlock. This is
“I like it,” Locky tells him. He doesn’t mind a shiver sometimes.
“No, Daddy.” It wasn’t entirely convincing.
“I love kissing you,” he whispered.
John kissed his temple. “I’m glad you like it, my darling.” Sherlock’s hand drifted again toward his pile of strawberry sweets. “Before you have another, can Daddy have a kiss? Only if you want to.”
Sherlock hesitated but then breathed, “Yes.”
A quiet, happy hum from the bedroom. John was working open a crinkly plastic bag when his sweet boy emerged from the bedroom, hair damp, eyes soft and wide, tip of his thumb between his lips (it was cute, John had to admit), smelling of sandalwood soap and wearing his jim-jams.
Sherlock nodded, and his eyes glistened and shimmered a bit.
“I know you’re not,” Sherlock said instantly, firmly, but not loud. “You’re
“If you’ll be ready for a break in about a half hour, I’m going to run out and pick up a few things, then when I come back—”
“It wasn't a suicide mission John, I wasn't trying to take my own life, I wouldn't do that to you. I just needed something to get through what I had to do.”
“John I…” Sherlock trailed off, unable to extract himself from the intimate embrace.
“Are you coming back to bed or are you going to stare at me some more?”
Of course Sherlock wanted his comfy bed but he needed John, pined to hear his voice, longed to melt into his sturdy frame on the settee after a long case and wanted more than anything to stay up all night, laughing and talking about everything and nothing. Stretching, Sherlock let out a pained moan as his bones cracked, muscles ached and tears involuntary pricked at the pain. Scowling slightly Sherlock wondered what to do with himself with only a thin mattress and a microwave for company, for once in his life he really didn’t know the answer. John would know the answer, John would fix things, fix Sherlock, John always knew what to do. Over their three years of companionship Sherlock hadn't realised how much he relied on him, how much John Watson and his wooly jumpers, trashy TV shows and military precision had changed him for the better. Being near another human being for more than a few hours once alarmed Sherlock but now being away from John was a living hell. John Watson, a doctor, a war veteran, a hero, so comparatively ordinary to the untrained eye with his small stature and normal job but to those that knew him, he was saviour, a fearless warrior who would gladly put his life on the line for those lucky enough to get close to him. Braver than any man Sherlock knew, wiser, more dignified and a better man than he would ever hope to be. John knew him, John fixed him, John would always put Sherlock above his own needs without even realising it. So many times Sherlock had awoken with his head in John’s lap, soft fingers running through his hair when he'd crashed out after another adrenaline fuelled case. John never flinched when he’d practically carried Sherlock to a hot bath and put him to bed with his arms wrapped tightly around the shivering detective after he nearly caught hypothermia after falling in the Thames again. Oh what Sherlock would give for a hot bath, he would quite happily sell all his worthwhile possessions and whatever of his tattered soul still remained for sharing a Chinese takeaway on the sofa with John Watson, chatting merry nonsense until the early morning eventually falling asleep on the beaten sofa. But John wasn't here, Sherlock was alone without his beloved, caring, wonderful companion at his side. With a sad sigh, the shivering detective put his scraps of food in the microwave and dressed the cut on his cheek, swearing as his shaking hands fumbled with the last bit of gauze he had left.
“Better than I was last night thanks to you,” Sherlock purred, stretching his long body, wincing as the inevitable pain of his wound hit.
“No John,” Lestrade said gently, “he fell off a balcony, the perp pushed him after the bloody moron ran off in his own. He's in surgery, he broke a rib that punctured his lung, mild conclusion, broken wrist a few scrapes and the like, but he will be fine.”
“This week has been amazing!” John enthused, pouring a generous measure of wine in both their glasses, “you're amazing!”
“Like I said, women aren't my area.”
“Don’t apologise, it’s sexy, knowing little old me is occupying your thoughts,” John planted a tender, reassuring kiss on Sherlock’s lips before he nipped at the pale earlobe, earning a gasp from the tall man.
“It's fine,” Sherlock said suddenly, ploughing through the moment of uncomfortable silence like a bull in a china shop, he yanked at his t-shirt but hissed as his feigned enthusiasm jarred his wound. Without a word Sherlock lay back down with a grimace, exposing his bare flesh to John, looking away as the Doctor's gentle hands tended to his latest injury.
With a smirk John pushed that tantalising curl off Sherlock’s face and whispered, “can't you deduce it?” Sherlock could only smile as he closed the little distance that was left between them.
John smiled and pushed a sweat damp curl from his bedfellows face, “you ready, gorgeous?”
“No John, why are you telling me?”
“I'm not the soldier in the room, I wouldn't stand a chance against an army man! I'm sure it's because of your military charm the waitress gave us the bottle to take back.”
“Morning,” as if on cue John Watson sauntered out, he wore Sherlock’s second best dressing gown loosely tied so a large portion of his gorgeous chest was bared, at least he had pants on, although that was the only saving grace. The doctor passed the crowd, calmly strutting to the kitchen, giving Sherlock the filthiest wink he could muster before idly putting the kettle on, leaving Donovan and Lestrade gaping and Sherlock hoping the ground would swallow him… or that the gun was in reaching distance.
“Please eat something, I worry about you.”
“Can't you stay?” Sherlock’s voice was a cracked whisper, he wasn't listening for the answer, he knew it was no, knew John had promised to have lunch with some of their other couple friends but had to do the grocery shop first. The thought of John Watson mooching around Asda picking which crisps and dip to serve to his couple friends with their 9-5 jobs and 2.5 kids was ironically hilarious, yet that was what John Watson was doing with his Saturday morning instead of spending it with Sherlock making sweet lazy love and chatting nonsense for hours on end. “I'm sorry my love, feel better,” planting a tender kiss on those razor cheek bones, John left Baker Street knowing the only thing that would be in his mind whilst he ate lunch with his wife would be 6 feet of snivelling consulting detective curled under the covers wearing John’s hideous jumper that did in fact clash with his hair.
“He's going to be out if it for a while but the doctor said he's doing fine, you're not going where until you've rested.”
“Thats one way of putting it.”
“We don’t have to do this, we can carry on fooling around, it’s all good I just want to be with you. Sherlock look at what you do to me, whatever you want is fine my darling, I promise.”
“Who the fuck do you think you are?” John snarled, “how dare you barge into this flat unannounced, speak so disgustingly disrespectfully to its occupants then ridicule the man who just solved your case. Perhaps if you got your head out of your own arse and actually did the job my tax money pays you to do, you wouldn't need to come dancing in here forcing Sherlock to do it for you. Sherlock solved this case in 3 days, he figured it out before you even knew which way was up so how dare you come here with your filthy fucking mouth and say such things to him,” Narrowing his eyes and broadening his shoulders, John hissed with pure venom, “now get the fuck out of my flat.”
Sherlock sort of smiled but his eyes were becoming unfocused, flitting widely around and his hardness flagged a little.
“Easy love, easy,” John soothed, the tone of endearment slipping out unintentionally but neither commented. John set to work not saying a word, feigning concentration when in reality he could redress a surgical scar with his eyes closed. Sherlock as ever was right, his torso was certainly unsightly, full of scars and old wounds in various stages of healing, quite what had caused them all John didn't know, he never wanted to. Despite pointedly ignoring them, John could still make out cigarette burns, whip marks and several ugly slashes that would permanently scar the porcelain flesh. Pain, dear God Sherlock must have endured so much pain whilst he was away and John was glad he had finished as his hands were starting to shake, his stomach turning a little. Hurriedly disposing of the old dressings John pulled himself together in the bathroom, faking a smile when he got back to the lounge and found Sherlock pottering in the kitchen, his movements were slow and his body a little hunched but at least he was standing. Instinctively John gently touched Sherlock's arm and took over making the tea that the detective was half heatedly trying to brew. They drifted into a familiar silence, words rarely needed to be spoken between them but there was a heaviness in the air, a hint of unsaid urgency hung.
John pressed his fingertips against a headache taking root between his eyebrows. “Maybe we should—I’ll take care of your welts and tuck you into bed—but maybe we should call it a night.”
“What if we didn’t?” Sherlock asked.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart,” John started. “I know it might take you a bit to come up.”
John slowed his rhythm, made two lazy strokes around the nipples with thumb and tongue-tip, then pulled away. He looked up and said quietly, “Whatever you want, my precious boy. Anything you want.”
, talking about this is so complicated. It’s making me crazily self-conscious. Now I
“Let me change your dressing the wound needs to be cleaned.”
“Hey, John mate stay still,” a pair of hands gently pushed him back to the bed and as much as John wanted to create a scene he didn't have the energy, simply slumping back to the bed. “Take it easy John,” Lestrade said gently, patting him on the arm in the least condescending way he could muster, “it's ok, Sherlock’s ok.
“Does this feel good?”
“There's not much to understand, I’m an addict.”
“I wasn't saying that, I’m just worried, Sherlock.”
“John, it’s been a while since I’ve been intimate with someone,” Sherlock squeaked the words, tensing a little as he spoke.
“Yes,” Sherlock smiled softly, “yes I am. She’s one of a kind.”
Mary was great, smart, funny, beautiful and the guilt always hit when she earnestly encouraged their little get togethers, insisting he accompany Sherlock on a case, smiling with a gentle roll of the eyes at his stories, happy that her partners’ best friend that he grieved so long for was back. Undoubtedly Mary would feel differently if she knew John was shagging that said best friend more often her, significantly more often. Mary had a soft spot for the crazy defective so was more than happy, eager in fact, for John to help him after his latest injury, as frustrating as the long recovery had been for all parties at least it was an excuse for John to come over more, with the added benefit of Mary's blessing. She even packed John an overnight bag when Sherlock's surgical incision became mildly infected, very mildly infected and the doctor had a less than orthodox way to help the mad detective feel better. John never thought he would be an adulterer, always holding himself to a higher moral standard, he served for Queen and Country after all, but it was all too easy really. Mary had taken a job at a hospital, much better money, more interesting work and closer to the flat, her shifts meant she was often working through the night and since John had taken on some locum work they could go days without crossing paths. Days where John would arrange his work strategically so he and the detective could have hours of uninterrupted bliss and nights of endless passion without Mary suspecting a thing. This couldn't go on forever, something had to give, John couldn't keep lying to his wife, he couldn't keep deceiving people and living a double life... but as a pair of very full, very male, very Sherlock lips descended onto his, at that moment, John couldn't bring himself to care.
John’s mouth was watering as he rolled his tongue in a half-circle around the head of Sherlock’s cock, then sank down to surround it, shoving his tongue up and wriggling it against the sensitive spot there beneath the crown. He stayed there, sucked the head up against his upper lip, then drew back, pulling the skin along with tight lips, holding firm to Sherlock’s arse, now and then pressing with his fingertip, which made Sherlock jump and whine. He began a quick up-and-down, then, mouth tight, sucking, rolling his tongue, all the while digging in his fingers, eventually breeching Sherlock’s opening with one fingertip, and Sherlock began to moan, first through tight-bitten lips, and then his mouth fell open as his breath gusted out, low and loud, and John encouraged with humming groans until Sherlock’s shivering and whimpering and moaning let him know he was close to the edge. John drew back, shifted his head to make space, flicked his tongue-tip beneath the crown of Sherlock’s prick, and in a moment Sherlock was coming, bitter-salt spurts of hot fluid coating John’s tongue, filling the hollow of his cheek, mixing with his own flowing saliva.
Sherlock pressed his nose further into the pillow and shook his head.
John was already beginning to calm; the worst of his weeping already passing away, his shuddering had stopped though now he was shivering a bit—he might have been cold—and the hideous, dark feeling that had filled him like pollution and made him want to run away from himself was evaporating up and out of him. He was left feeling hollowed out and sorry.
Sherlock made a loud whine of distress, tried to pull his face away, tried to shut his lips. John drew back, whispered, “Oh, hush now, you dirty boy. I know you like that. Your mouth was
agitated, lower, meaner.
“Happens sometimes. Can I come in?”
“You’re good, too, Daddy,” Locky tells him.
Sherlock shrugged hard.
John nodded. His eyes prickled. When did Sherlock become so insightful about the feelings of others? No, not others. Only John.
“Sherlock,” he said, in his normal voice, which sounded woeful and miserable even to his own ears. “I need a minute.”
“Yes. Then after. . .” Locky gets very shy and his thumb finds its way to his mouth, just a bit, just at the corner.
“It is a bit silly,” Sherlock agreed.
Sherlock drew his face out of the fur and looked narrowly at John. “It’s
“Oh, Daddy! This is the best present ever!” Sherlock exclaimed, and his face was bright and wide-open. The present was a floppy-limbed cuddly toy in the shape of a dog, with lovely soft red-brown fur, and a smile sewn with black thread. Its plastic eyes were several shades of bronze and copper, and it had a dark green, woven-canvas collar around its neck, dangling a silvery round tag. Sherlock buried his face in its belly, holding it by the front legs, which he pressed against his cheeks. He hummed his delight into the soft fur.
“That’s lovely to hear,” John murmured, and kissed his bottom lip, soft as a whisper. “What else can I do for you, good boy?” he asked quietly,
Having completed another crossways journey with his hand on Sherlock’s chest, he swept his palm back again to the start, then skidded downward, and petted him slowly across and back, across and back, over his belly, softly rising and falling in time with his breath. “So sweet,” John crooned to him. “You’re the most perfect boy.”
“No,” John said, quick and firm, but not angry. “You’re not dirty. You’re the most beautiful, perfect boy there is. I’m so lucky you’re mine. I love being your daddy more than anything else I do. I love taking care of you and making you feel good. I’m sorry if you felt bad, darling, you should never have to. You’re precious. I love you so, so much.”
“Excellent.” John went to the bedroom to fetch his shoes.
Locky feels his lip go pouty but he bites it back into his mouth and nods his head.
“I didn’t like it,” Sherlock sobbed out around his thumb, his forehead pressed tight into the divot below John’s collarbone. “He made me say dirty words. He looked at me. . .”
John was on the verge, could barely keep himself coming, but there was so much more he wanted to do. He drew back, pulled out, and rose to his full height. Sherlock turned his head, muffling the sound of gagging by burying his face in the pillow.
John did tell him, not the specifics, but the gist, and in the course of a few minutes they’d outlined a scenario—a box to keep it in—so John knew his dark feelings were safely contained and anything he felt, said, or did to Sherlock in that time wouldn’t spill over into their real life together, and to reassure him Sherlock would be safe even if things got frightening.
. . .” a low hum against John’s three-day stubble, which burns his lips and chin as they kiss. John’s hand in the small of his back, just delicate fingertips pressing against the top of Sherlock’s bum, pulling him closer, in rhythm. Sherlock bares his throat and John licks, nips, murmurs.
Sherlock did as he was told. John looked his fill of the lanky, pale body as he shifted onto his back, knees tangled in his pyjama bottoms, then over onto his other side so his pale, curved back and plush cheeks were on display. Sherlock drew his legs up, hugged his knees a bit. John released his cock and it bobbed heavily, and he lowered himself onto the bed to lie behind Sherlock. He opened his mouth wide against the back of Sherlock’s neck, tongue and teeth claiming him, and John let go a deep groan as he spit again into his already sopping palm, slid it between Sherlock’s arsecheeks, streaking them with damp. His hand on Sherlock’s hip yanked him back, and John jabbed his cock into the cleft of Sherlock’s arse.
see you.”
“All right, all right. . .” John made a gesture of surrender.
“I didn’t like it. It felt bad.”
“I like the way you fuck me, Daddy. I love your big big prick. I like sitting up on it and feeling it fill up my hole.”
. . .Oh, you smell so nice.”
Locky begins to move, sliding slow and shallow up and down, and his hole is burning again, just a little, and riding his daddy’s big prick is a little bit like scratching an itch. He makes noises about it; he can’t help himself. Nothing else in the whole world feels like being with Daddy just this way, how it hurts and feels good both at the same time.
for kissing.” John kissed him again, sucking Sherlock’s bottom lip hard between his own lips, catching it between his teeth before letting go. As John withdrew, Sherlock swiped the back of his hand across his mouth, then again. His eyes were red when he opened them. John reached into the fly of his boxers and easily freed his own cock, heavy, flushed, running at the crown. “Watch here, see how a man does it. Make sure you’re doing it properly or you’ll make yourself sick, did you know that?”
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock nodded furiously. “I do, I like them very much!”
Sherlock shivered a little, collapsed his chest away from John’s fingers, which gave chase and resumed the teasing spiral motion.
“You’re such a fine-looking boy. So handsome. . .” John’s fingers slipped down between Sherlock’s collarbones, over the worn-thin fabric of the old t-shirt he wore, and he dragged a flat hand across Sherlock’s chest. “Oh, what’s this?” he grinned, and licked his lips, going back for another pass over Sherlock’s hardened nipple. “You really
(See the end of the chapter for
“Me too, Daddy,” Sherlock replied, and his whisper was a bit ragged.
“Pretty boy,” he murmured. He turned his gaze downward and watched Sherlock’s hips undulating in time with the movements of John’s thumb, now circling the hard little bud of the nipple so that his thumbnail offered a different sensation as it came around. “Can I kiss it?”
“What a slut you are,” John said tonelessly, and watched tears gather anew in Sherlock’s red-rimmed eyes. He blushed mottled pink from his cheeks down his neck and even onto his chest, where John could see his nipples were hard as pebbles. “I’m going to make you come now. You’ll like it, you’ll see. I want you to let it go right into my mouth, like a good boy.”
“I love you so much, my sweet boy,” John whispered against the soft divot behind his earlobe. “You’re so precious to me.”
“I’m home, sweetheart,” he called, and started unpacking one of the bags onto the table. The other he folded shut for the time being.
“Please let me,” was his reply. “I can carry it.” And although it might have sounded like he was saying he could handle the fear or pain that might be dealt to him—which was also true—what he meant was that he could accept the burden of John’s least pleasant feelings, the darkest parts of him, and by so doing, may make John’s heart a little lighter. Sherlock was a gift John would never comprehend his having earned.
Sherlock was over John’s knee, trousers around his thighs, open shirt rumpled up around his shoulder blades, and he sniveled and sobbed against the duvet. It was the sniveling that had made John move from smacking his arse with his bare hand (thirty smacks; Daddy John was at his wit’s end with his boy Locky and his seemingly willful refusal to obey Daddy’s scold about not sucking his thumb)—Sherlock had rubbed his snotty nose and upper lip against the coverlet during the spanking and it had only made John crosser. So out came the brush (Sherlock hated it, had even tried to hide it once after a spanking). Now he was crying in earnest, lurching forward with a loud whimper after each blow landed, trying to wriggle away.
“Is your pretty cock hard there under the bedclothes? Tell me the truth now. I’ll know if you if you’re lying.”
Sherlock added, “And I don’t think you’re sick. I know you’re not. Heartsick, maybe.”
“Tired, darling? Do you want a nap?”
John had to stop, gave himself a pinch and took a breath.
“All right, darling?” John frowned.
Around his thumb, Locky says, “Love you, Daddy.” He wants to have a rest. “Sleepy,” he says then.
“Sure you’re OK?” he asked quietly, searching Sherlock’s face for any sign of lingering emotional trauma. He looked normal, strong and sure and kind, and John felt safer with each passing moment.
“I’m all right. You take good care of me. You’re my Daddy.” Sherlock shrugged a bit—
“Not really. Perhaps more strict than usual. You don’t usually change the punishment, or augment it, once you’ve begun.” Sherlock shrugged as he set John’s mug in front of him, and resumed a pose near the worktop that allowed him to lean on his hip.
“Anyone who tells you that you’re bad or dirty is a liar. And anyone who touches you in a way you don’t like is bad, and very sick indeed. You’re
Sherlock’s face lit up and he rearranged himself a bit, squaring their bodies to each other. John tipped his face, and their mouths came together, soft and just wet enough, and there was a clicking sound as they released each other, but John went back for more, and Sherlock opened his mouth—trusting, inviting—and John dipped his tongue in to taste the coating of sugary imitation strawberry sweetness in Sherlock’s mouth. They both hummed a bit, enjoying each other’s lips and tongues, until John drew back, smiling.
“Yes, so long as you’re petting.”
“I was only going to say let’s get in the bed, Daddy.”
“I know, Daddy.”
Sherlock’s teeth crunched down on the candy then, and he started to reach for another even as he chewed the remainder of the first.
John groaned and ground his cock hard into Sherlock’s hand before letting it go. Sherlock let it lie wilted on the blanket where it fell, as if the hand didn’t even belong to him. “Good,” John told him, and reached for his chin, turning his face though Sherlock fought not to look at him. “Very good.” John rumpled the edge of the blankets in his free hand and thrust them down, baring Sherlock nearly to the knees. The drawstring on his pyjamas had been pulled free and the bottoms pulled halfway down his arse in back, below his bollocks in the front. Sherlock curled into himself on his side, drawing his knees up as John looked his fill of Sherlock’s dark-rosy prick, curving up toward his belly. Another rumbling sound from John’s throat, and he steadied Sherlock’s chin in his hand then mashed his mouth down on Sherlock’s fat pink lips, tugging his jaw down to keep his mouth open as John thrust his tongue in, searching in circles for Sherlock’s dodging, retreating tongue.
. . .and then that second when everything changes and the need is filled up and all Locky wants to do then is for his Daddy to hold him and touch his hair while he goes asleep. If he makes his daddy feel that way. . .well, then, he must be a good boy, after all.
“Fingers,” is all Locky can say at first, because it’s hard to be brave about dirty talk sometimes, even with his Daddy, who says it’s all right and that big boys can use dirty words. Locky never gets in trouble for saying bad words, not even
“Um. . .” Sherlock said, and his shoulders were restless against the mattress.
. That’s sacred.”
“I’m going to spoil you a bit.”
“What did you go out for, Daddy?”
Sherlock looked up. His eyes were wet and he let go of his thumb. “Do you still?”
Sherlock didn’t make a sound in reply, but his hand went to the waistband and he hooked his thumb in, tugging down. John helped, gently pulling at the back so that his hand traced the curve of Sherlock’s bottom as he went, and Sherlock lifted his hip off the mattress until the pyjamas were down around his knees.
“No, of course not. You’re not really like that, John. I know you’re not; you’re good. You’re a good man.”
“I understand. It’s a wise approach. And in the end, if I don’t like it, I can delete it.”
“You like that, dirty boy,” he said.
“And I want candy.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly but he didn’t say anything.
“If you say stop, we stop, and we don’t worry about me. If it’s too much for you, it’s too much. I’ve lived with it this long, but you’ve never had to.”
Sherlock was with him instantly, saying his name, hushing him. “John,
John huffed a quick little laugh at this. “Feels silly, now, doesn’t? You, such a big boy, even saying a word like that.”
“It’s not. . .” God this was hard. John hated talking like this, these negotiations. He’d been so relieved when the bulk of it was clearly behind them, after the initial few awkward discussions about Sherlock wanting them to sometimes enact these scenarios, play these roles. “That’s not our. . .thing. Vibe.
, I just love you so much. You’re so sweet,” John told him, and Sherlock shook his face away from John’s gentle grip, smiling and shy in light of the praise.
Clever Sherlock (as ever; he was a genius in more ways than just solving puzzles, as it turned out), had suggested they might need some dedicated Daddy/Locky time afterward, to sort them, and now John thought that was precisely what was needed. He set the newspaper aside, got to his feet and stretched, rolling his toes against the rug, tugging his wrists far above his head. He crossed to stand behind Sherlock at the kitchen table. Laying his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, John softened his voice—a delicate shift in his tone that only Sherlock would ever pick up on as different from the usual—and asked, “Will you show me what you’re doing there, sweetheart?” The endearment was another subtle cue.
Sherlock’s voice when his reply came was softer, too—different enough that anyone would notice, which is why only John ever got to hear it. He tapped each of several test tubes in their stand in its turn, with one finger. “These all have different reagents in them and I wait to see if the colour changes,” he reported. “And how long it takes and how much different it gets.”
John let out a little laugh and went back into the first bag, the open one. “Well, let’s see what else is here for you, sweetheart.  You know I love to make you smile.” He reached into the bag and pulled out a large, flat, square book. “I hope this you’ll like this one,” John said, and passed the book over to Sherlock, who accepted it eagerly, slurping audibly at his strawberry candy. John could hear him click it against the edges of his teeth, waiting for it to be sucked thin enough to bite so the liquid filling would run out onto his tongue, mixing with what was left, turning it chewy.
“You’re all right, darling, don’t worry,” Daddy reassures him. “I’m just teasing. It’s the good kind of naughty.”
“I like it,” Locky says, feeling shy even though he knows everything they do together is fine as long as they both feel good.
Saying each other’s names always helped them surface, tied them to the real world and their real lives.
Sherlock hesitated, then nodded again, but looked away.
Once Sherlock’s cock stopped pulsing, John released it, and spit the mess into his hand as he got to his feet, used it to stroke his own aching prick. “Good boy,” he said. “Didn’t I tell you I’d take good care of you?”
Sherlock drew back, smiled gently, and said, “I know. I’ll see you upstairs in a few minutes.” He seemed reluctant to leave John behind, and his fingertips were the last to go, breaking contact with John’s only when there was nothing else for it but to let go. After a quick detour into their bedroom, Sherlock took the steps two at a time, and John heard the door click nearly-shut.
“Lovely,” John murmured, and leaned to press a kiss in the crease of hip and thigh, just a light kiss, chaste except for where it was placed. He leaned up on his elbow, propping his head in his hand, and let the other hand stroke down the length of Sherlock’s thigh once more, slowly, then up along the back so that his palm and fingertips slid up over the curve of one buttock, then down again. Sherlock hummed.
They held each other’s gaze for a long minute, and John stroked Sherlock’s hair until he’d settled.
John squeezed his shoulder a bit, leaned over to get a better look. “This one’s already gone a bit green, I see.”
. After a second’s hesitation to get up his nerve, Locky says, “Your fingers inside me, Daddy.” Then he remembers his manners and adds, “Please.”
,” Sherlock said again. “I’m all right. I promise I’m all right.” He reached up to smooth John’s hair from his forehead, stroked his eyebrow into place with one long finger. “
John kept his nose and mouth tucked into the deep heat of Sherlock’s pubic hair, and let his hand slide up the length of his prick, drawing a low whimper from Sherlock. John circled his palm over the crown, gathering pre-cum to ease his way back down to the base. His dragging thumb gently tugged Sherlock’s foreskin back as he went, and Sherlock hummed. John let his chin dip, leading the way, wet his lips and brushed them soft and wet against Sherlock’s bollocks, closing gently  to suck, then immediately curling his tongue around beneath. He slid his hand again, squeezing softly the way he knew Sherlock liked, and ducked his head low, his tongue stroking flat and wide and wet—but soft, slow, sweet—up between Sherlock’s balls, then continuing along the underside of his prick, feeling the ridge of vein, tasting the stale, faintly sour taste of his own left-behind saliva until he reached the crown and slowly, oh-so-slowly, circled his tongue around it, flicking gently against the sensitive spot beneath.
“Like Goggie?” Locky says, thinking of his stuffed dog with is soft and loose legs and long ears.
“Needy little thing,” Daddy says, and even though it sounds nice the way he says it, that is not an answer. Daddy holds him up a bit. “Stay,” he says, and then he starts rocking hard up into Locky’s bottom, and Locky’s legs start to shake, and his tummy muscles are burning from holding himself that way, but he does it because his daddy said so.
“All right.” Daddy turns his face a little and Locky digs his head into the pillow to get close to his ear. He whispers very quiet but he spills the words right out.
He sat down on the edge of the bed—Sherlock’s side, closest to the door—and picked up the hair brush he’d been spanking Sherlock with when his darkest thoughts started boiling up, violently breaking the surface of his consciousness so he couldn’t ignore them, couldn’t force them back down. He patted the palm of his hand repeatedly with the smooth, wooden back of the brush, and closed his eyes. After a moment collecting himself, John decided to be unafraid, to let Sherlock do him the kindness of accepting some of his burden. Then he went upstairs.
“I’m not. . .”
Sherlock dropped his thumb from his mouth and wiped it dry with the hem of his soft t-shirt.
Sherlock’s voice was full of muck and he kept his head turned toward the wall so John couldn’t see his face. “It comes out,” he whispered, and sniffed. “Jizz comes out.”
“OK,” Sherlock agreed, speaking around his thumb again. His face was tipped to one side, and he nuzzled in slow motion against the belly of the stuffed dog, looking for all the world as if he really might go to sleep. John tucked the quilts around his legs and feet, then crawled in under them himself, lying on his side with his chest pressed against Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock rolled up onto his side most of the way, and hummed contentedly. “All right, Daddy?” he asked in a sleepy voice.
“I love your precious kisses,” Daddy tells him, and his fingers are grippy again, near the middle of Locky’s bum, and when he squeezes Locky feels a tight pulling in his most private place, and Locky makes a little whiney sound behind his nose, then everything  goes soft again as Daddy lets go of his bottom and moves to touch a new spot. “Big boy, kissing Daddy with your tongue.”
“Clever you,” John told him, and ducked to feed his tongue to the circling thumb, leaving behind plenty of saliva. Sherlock sucked a loud breath and his hips jutted up hard once before settling back into gentler rocking. John moved to settle against Sherlock’s chest at the near side, licked his lips, and closed them around the tiny, hard bead of the nipple. Sherlock’s whole torso thrummed, his back bowing up to meet John’s kiss.
Daddy’s hands loosen from around Locky’s hips, and Locky sinks down because his thighs are tired and shaking, but Daddy’s cock is so deep in him and feels so good. . .Locky starts to rock forward and back, his belly and shoulders following along, snaky, and he sucks and sucks his thumb—all of it, not just the tip like he sometimes does--and Daddy moves under him and his voice is very rocky and rough.
“Listen, sweetheart,” John began, still stroking Sherlock’s arm comfortingly. “You know that everything we do together is just fine so long as we don’t hurt each other, don’t you? We’ve talked about this.”
“Right. So this has to be different. I need it to be separate.”
Sherlock’s hand moved to stroke his back, his shoulder, down his arm, while the other held him firm and tight, close to Sherlock’s chest.
. . .coming up,” John started. “I wanted to say some things I normally would never.” He looked at Sherlock, whose expression was placid, attentive, and open. “Cruel things.”
Sherlock drags fingers across John’s chest, through the hair, coarse and fine at once, pale golden. He needs. . .
“Understandable,” Sherlock said quietly. “I only suggested this—” he motioned toward the bedroom “—because I thought it might help us connect a bit. I was caught up in the details of the case.” His voice softened. “I saw you were struggling, John, and I apologise that I didn’t take time to—“
“And you’ve got your notes here,” John motioned to the pad nearby. “Very well organized. Nicely done.”
John offered his hand, Sherlock took it, and they moved to the kitchen. John sank heavily into his usual chair. Sherlock, with his sore backside, did not sit, instead went into the cupboard for mugs and tea sachets, started fixing them each a cup.
. His boy Locky—utterly vulnerable, emotionally wide-open—was the most precious gift John had ever been given.
“That’s fine,” John told him, and two fingers rode up the side of Sherlock’s neck into his hair, nails against his scalp, gently twisting curls around his knuckles. He tugged gently, persuading, and Sherlock lifted his face to meet John’s gaze, then quickly looked away again in his embarrassment at having been caught. John told him, “It’s fine to get excited and want to touch yourself. So, then. . .we know you’re a big boy. No need to be embarrassed.”
“All fine,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock moaned a little, but he nodded.
“Jail is no place for us, darling.”
John’s throat thickened and his heart ached. He smiled softly up at his darling boy, and said, “If that’s what you want, I’d love to be sweet to you. You’ll feel so good, I know. Just softly. Softly.” John’s voice had faded to a whisper by the time he finished, and he shifted himself down the bed so that he was leaning on his elbow by Sherlock’s hip. He ducked to plant a kiss on the crest of bone there, then let his hand stroke down Sherlock’s pyjama-clad thigh, the crown of Sherlock’s erection already making itself known, pushing out through the fly, leaking clear fluid from the slit.
Sherlock was whining, high and needy, and John relished the way Sherlock surrendered his need, surrendered all self-consciousness, all shame, trusted John, sank so easily and willingly into the pleasure John was more than willing to provide. More than merely willing, John was
“You’re
“You’re easy to spoil,” John said playfully. “You’re the best boy.”
“I don’t want to say,” Sherlock said, and he dragged the stuffed dog from where it was tucked between neck and shoulder, up onto his tipped-back face, covering it.
“Cock,” Sherlock said, more quietly this time, losing a little of his breath in the excitement.
“Probably quite a lot, actually,” John admitted, and planted a kiss in Sherlock’s waves of dark hair, there at this temple. “We’ll have a wonderful time together.” He straightened up and his voice went back to normal, then, as he patted his pockets checking for wallet and keys. “Sounds all right?”
“Oh, yes, my good boy. We’re ready now, aren’t we?”
“The things he did. The way he must have manipulated those boys, warped them into accepting that all those things he did were somehow their own fault, or made them think it was normal, or terrorized them to keep them quiet. . .” John shook his head. “I guess it’s just not out of my system yet. The disgust.”
“I didn’t like it.”
Rolling over so his back was to Sherlock, he replayed the whole scene in his mind: Sherlock’s sweet, open bearing as he slipped into his boy role; his strawberry-candy sweetened kisses; his precious self given over to John utterly and without reservation. He licked his palm, stroked himself steadily, pinching his foreskin around the head of his aching prick, his entire being buzzy with a wash of what he thought must be every shade and flavour of hormones his body was capable of producing. He thought of Sherlock’s noises of pleasure—his moans and whimpers, his voice muted by the toy John had given him to snuggle—and he licked the insides of his lips, tasting Sherlock’s salt-and-bitter left-behind cum. He jerked himself quick, his hips rocking up into his hand, and it only took a few pulls before he was coming into his palm, between his fingers, biting his lips and breathing hard.
Sherlock nodded, looking serious. He quickly crunched up whatever was left of his sweets, and swallowed, then thrust his thumb into his mouth and started to suck, the muscles in his cheeks and jaw gently working.
“A little.”
“Oh, my darling, precious boy,” Daddy coos, and he slides his fingertips over the hot skin of Locky’s beaten bottom. “You are so good for your daddy, Locky, sweetheart. Do you know how good you make me feel?”
Sherlock turned his face more toward John, looking quite eager to hear how this sentence would end.
John turned more toward Sherlock, raising one knee up onto the bed so that his dressing gown shifted, coming open in front where he’d belted it quite loosely. “It’s all right to feel sexy. You should be pleased that you’re so grown-up.” John cut a glance to the spot where he knew Sherlock’s hand rested beneath the covers. “Do you, then? Feel sexy?”
“Say it.”
“You do,” Sherlock said, and he rubbed the soft fur of the cuddly toy along the edge of his jaw, sunk his face down toward the pillow.
He circled both of Sherlock’s nipples, then—one with this thumb and one with his tongue—slowly at first, but gradually increasing the pace. Sherlock bit down hard on his strawberry sweetie and John heard it crack apart, and applied more pressure with thumb and tongue, and hummed encouragement. Sherlock crunched the rest of the candy, then swallowed noisily. His hand landed on the back of John’s head, and the other caught his forearm, wrapping around his wrist and squeezing urgently. He whined out loud, a needy, high sound from the top of his throat, and John could sense that his hips were rocking up harder now.
Locky makes an embarrassed, apologetic noise. He knows he is meant to like it, and he does! he likes it
“Come on now, don’t be shy.” John leaned close to Sherlock’s ear, bracing himself with one hand beside the pillow, sweeping his still spit-clammy hand down Sherlock’s torso, let it settle to rest on his hip. He licked, nipped, sucked at Sherlock’s earlobe and Sherlock made a noise that was less distressed and more needy. “See that, you like to be kissed like that, don’t you?” John pulled the lobe gently between his teeth, then swirled his tongue around it and nuzzled into the divot behind Sherlock’s jaw with the tip of his nose. He hummed. “God, you gorgeous boy. The things you make me want to do to you. . .”
, and
Locky kisses sweetly at first, just little smacks like

“Daddy, I want your big cock in me,” he complains, and starts to press himself up off his daddy’s chest. “Now,” he adds.
“Yes, please, Daddy,
“No? Why don’t you show me your way?”
in the intervening time had grated on him. Sherlock’s usual obliviousness to the feelings of others had risen to new heights—or perhaps John’s tolerance for them had sunk—and John was worn out from constantly correcting him and apologizing for him. He’d thought a few hours in this game of theirs, after Sherlock had opened the way for it, would help him settle back into himself. Sherlock’s wide-eyed, sometimes silly, up-for-anything and eager-to-please boy persona gave John a chance to indulge his nurturing side, love Sherlock unconditionally, and of course, they were both always well-pleased and sated by the end, the snuggly afterglow one of John’s favourite places to land.
“I’m—” Sherlock started, and licked his lips nervously. “I’m not scared.”
Sherlock’s face flushed up as pink as the candies.
, you’re fine. You’re a big boy. I know you do like it. You’re feeling sexy, and so am I, and we’re going to make each other feel so nice.” John’s breath came hot and hard, as he bucked up against Sherlock’s hand though he had to hold it tight because Sherlock left it limp. “You’re just nervous. I promise you’ll like it. I’m helping you. You’re learning. Now tell me, how do you know you’ve finished, when you’re pulling on your cock?”
“You’ve been hard a long time now,” John said, reverting to a more or less normal tone of voice, instructive rather than predatory. “We should make sure you get to finish off soon; don’t want you to be sick.”
A quick stumble to the bathroom to clean himself up, and John returned to the bedroom to retrieve his clothes and dress—he’d order them some dinner while Shrlock dozed—gazing at Sherlock’s sleeping form, wrapped in the quilt under which they slept every night together, close and loving and safe. There was something about Sherlock even then that was still the same sweet and trusting boy he became in the safety of his daddy John’s care—and not only that he was clutching a stuffed toy, with a pile of cello-wrapped sweets beside him by the pillow—there was something about his face, the softness around his closed eyes and his forehead creases that were now as smooth as they ever got. He was precious in all of his guises: boy and man, lover and partner, colleague and friend and remarkable genius that he was. That John got to see not just the face he showed the world, but the tenderest, most vulnerable parts of him as well, was an honour and a privilege John treasured and was humbled by. God, how he loved him.
, yes.”
“Why are you so
John leaned down and kissed Sherlock’s cheek, soft and lingering. Sherlock inhaled sharply but otherwise was still and silent, safe and sweet, and precious beyond words.
“Willy.” So quiet it was almost a whisper.
“I’m not going to fuck you, don’t be scared.”
“Settle down,” John sneered, annoyance rising in his voice. “I know you’ve been thinking of sucking a cock; here’s your chance.” Tears slid down Sherlock’s face, over the bridge of his nose. John kept working his prick in quick pulses, and Sherlock’s tongue swirled and pressed, trying to force him out. He gagged again, and saliva drooled out the corner of his mouth onto John’s hand, still gripping his chin. “You’re going to have bruises on your face if you keep fighting,” John warned, pressing his fingertips harder for a moment to demonstrate. “Then everyone will know what you’ve been up to. Is that—” his voice hitched as Sherlock’s tonguetip pressed against the slit in his cockhead. “That what you want? You want the boys at school to know you like sucking cock?”
John was taken aback. “That so? What’s his whole, proper name, then?”
John nodded, and let his head drop back onto the pillow, nuzzling close to Sherlock’s chest and neck. Sherlock stroked long fingers through John’s hair, soothed him with little kisses on his forehead and eyelids, hushed him and reassured. After several minutes being stroked and soothed—the way he often did for Sherlock as they came back to themselves after spending time in their Daddy and boy roles—John was beginning to feel more himself, though emotionally exhausted. The crying had taken it out of him, of course, but now he was beginning to feel the bruises left by what he had found deep in that other headspace. He had distance from it; it wouldn’t keep him up all night or anything, but he would have to spend some time looking at it later, maybe talk it out a bit with Sherlock if he was willing to hear it. He allowed himself to set it aside, thought about the here and now—both of them sticky with the leavings of sex, the spare bedroom cooling uncomfortably as the evening wore on—and he longed for hot water, the smell of Sherlock’s shampoo, a fresh t-shirt and Sherlock’s ankles tangled with his as they drifted off to sleep.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” John started. “Something’s. . .weird. . .with me.”
, and then giving him ten smacks for sneaking it. “Go on, sweetheart, let me—
—you know that?”
“I know, darling. Just wait and it will start to feel good.”
John moved his hand in a gentle, lazy meandering swirl across and over Sherlock’s bottom, just caressing, and after quickly licking his palm, he wrapped the other hand around the base of Sherlock’s cock and steadied it, then placed a trail of open-mouthed kisses down one side until he reached the circle of his fingers, skipped over them to nuzzle the tip of his nose into the patch of wiry hair—surprisingly, delightfully, more coppery-auburn than the hair on his head—and took in the smell of him: clean from the bath faintly scented with sandalwood soap; and the rising, deepening scent of his desire, low and hot.
Sherlock’s only response was to remove his thumb from his mouth just long enough to grab his daddy’s hand and place it atop the middle of his own chest. John let out a quiet laugh and settled against the pillows at a more comfortable angle, then began tracing a spiraling pattern across Sherlock’s upper chest, slow and lazy, lightly but not tickling. Once again sucking the tip of his thumb, Sherlock let out a contented hum, and nodded his head on his neck so the fur of the stuffed dog stroked his face.
“Eight.” John let it land, then decided not to hold back. “Nine, ten, eleven. Twelve.”
. . .
”—but he ventures to lick Daddy’s lips a bit, and even presses the very tip of his tongue right between Daddy’s closed lips until they open, and there is the tip of his Daddy’s tongue, flickering back at him, and Locky shivers again.
John was adamant. “I would
John nuzzled into the dank-smelling heat of him, in the fold between belly and thigh, pubic hair rough against one cheek, tongue digging in to taste body salts and the musk of Sherlock’s pleasure. Sherlock’s hand stroked his hair a few times, then down the back of his neck. John kissed and nuzzled his way up Sherlock’s body, there in the curve of his hip, up over the crest of the bone, down again into the soft bellyskin at the side of his waist. He steadied himself with an arm half-around Sherlock’s back, kissed his way up the belly, dragged the tip of his nose up his sternum, inhaling the different, more open scent of light perspiration between his pectoral muscles, there over his heart. Ultimately, he pressed kisses in the hollow between Sherlock’s collarbones, and all the while Sherlock made happy little puppy-whimpering noises through closed lips, and ran the long, bony fingers of one hand along the back of John’s neck and shoulders, his triceps, biceps, sounding so pleased to feel his daddy’s strong arms.
“Well, a few nice things,” John told him, and took Sherlock’s hand to guide him to the sofa. They both sat, and Sherlock tucked his legs up under him, bare feet tucked in beside his daddy’s thigh. “First, there are these.” He raised the plastic bag already in his hand, of strawberry-flavoured hard candies with soft, flowing centers. “I know you like them.”
Dry lips against the side of Sherlock’s throat, nearing his ear, just beneath his jaw, John murmured against the pulse point there, “You’re so sweet. . .oh, my perfect, darling boy.”
“The bit of stuff on the bottom of scum’s shoe,” John corrected. “It did get under my skin a bit. Men like him—not even men—
“I know. It’s our safest place. You know I trust you not to do me any harm.”
“That’s nice,” John told him as he let him go, “Lovely.”
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully, and John waited for his reply. “More petting?” he asked softly.
“Thank you for doing this,” John told him, not quite ready to let him go.
“Right, right.”
Sherlock took a quick visual inventory of his experiment; John saw his eyes darting, could almost hear the gears ratcheting in his head.
“Sweet.” So quiet it is nearly nothing but breath against Sherlock’s jaw. “So sweet.”
He slept easy that night after they’d indulged his dark impulse to roleplay his childhood abuse, in order that he might work through some feelings. The catharsis that followed had left John wracked with sobs: the sort of unguarded, shameless crying he couldn’t recall having done in adulthood—perhaps never in his life—and had wrung him out completely. They’d showered together, not talking much, then fell into bed.  Sherlock had tucked John against his chest, holding him close and safe in the arc of one long, muscular arm, and John had slept the night through, deeply and soundly. As they often did for each other, Sherlock had checked in with John the next morning as they puttered over coffee and toast in the kitchen.
“You’re welcome, my darling.”
,” Sherlock hummed, and grinned his soft sweet grin, looking up under his eyelashes as he moved into John’s embrace. John held him close, and kissed his cheek.
“Damned right,” John agreed quickly, feeling a twinge of fresh anger. Sherlock’s metaphor was apt; John had got it down to manageable size now, but he still had to carry it, and always would.
“No toys,” Locky says, and he unwinds himself to lie on his side, and Daddy turns to face him. “I meant, no toys please. No thank you.”
, agreeing that it should never happen.
a big boy. That feels good?” Two fingertips circled Sherlock’s nipple in a shrinking spiral, crumpling his t-shirt as he went.
“I love you so much, sweetheart. So very much. All I want to do is make you feel good and keep you safe. You know you’re a good boy, don’t you? You know you’re not dirty.”
for over a week. He needs. . .
Sherlock’s cheeks went a bit pink; he often blushed when John praised him.
“It’s unfair, what you were given to carry for the rest of your life, when you were a boy.”
“Fair enough,” Sherlock agreed. Then, with another sweet half-smile, “I’ve about had my fill tonight, anyway.”
Locky thinks he does. Daddy makes him feel so good he thinks he will burst and the ghost inside him will float up to the sky, all the while burning and throbbing, that feeling like
“I would never,” John huffed, then moaned out agony. He felt a painfully familiar shame, and was positively desperate to know he was forgiven. “I don’t want to hurt you,” he wept, and dug his face into Sherlock’s neck.
“You tell me.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock caught his gaze and asked softly, “Can I hold you for a minute?”
. . .”
John laughed and patted Sherlock’s knee, then leaned to take up the folded-shut bag into his lap. “One last thing, yes,” he said, and the look of joyful anticipation on Sherlock’s face was the perfect balm for John’s last lingering pain. He really was the sweetest boy. What a treasure. John was very aware in that moment of Sherlock’s surrendering all his trust to John, and that he did it readily, with never the slightest hesitation. John was all at once so humbled by it, if he hadn’t already been sitting, he’d have gone straight to his knees beneath the weight of it. He must deserve it—Sherlock would never be so vulnerable with anyone even the slightest bit unworthy—but for the life of him, he’d never understand how that had come to pass. He must have done something remarkable in previous life to be so richly rewarded in this one, for nothing he could recall to this point made him fit for this. He resolved, anew, to do everything in his power to be worthy of it.
“Your spunk tastes so good, because you’re not grown yet. When you start fucking, when you’re a man, it’s no good to taste anymore.” John tipped his head. “Turn over on your other side,” he said. “Face the wall.”
harm you. Especially in that context, being Daddy to my boy, I would
The kitchen table was still a riot of glass scientific equipment, and Sherlock’s notepad sat lined up with the table’s edge, a pen lying across it parallel to the printed lines on the paper, but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John hung his coat, toed off his shoes, set two plastic carrier bags on the coffee table by the sofa.
“Also no surprise,” John grinned, and stroked one hand down Sherlock’s arm. “Much as you like, but I’m watching you clean your teeth later, before you go to sleep.”
Daddy moves up on the bed and kisses him, even around his thumb, his tongue slipping and sliding over and around it to find Locky’s tongue. Daddy’s mouth tastes salty-sour because of Locky’s jizz. Locky likes it even though it’s nasty.
Daddy’s hands grab Locky’s bum cheeks again and press him up and away, and he holds tight and shoves and pulls, and slides down the bed until his shoulders are between Lockys’ thighs. Locky falls forward to brace himself up on his hands.
“You are the most beautiful boy,” Daddy tells him, and kisses Locky’s neck. “You’re so eager. Rocking against me, naughty thing.”
“I want you to fuck me, Daddy. I want to sit up on you and ride it.”
Daddy’s fingers are a little cold and very slimy when they touch Locky’s bottom, and he pulls Locky’s cheek away with his other hand, making everything go tight and stretched. “Take a breath,” Daddy tells him, “and when you blow it out, go slow and try to go all soft and melted everywhere, like a floppy soft toy.”
“We’ll talk about it in the morning,” Sherlock said quietly, agreeably, as if hearing John’s own thoughts. “Let’s get ready for bed.” He kissed John’s forehead again, and his closed eye.
Sherlock had finally said the wrong thing, and John protested immediately, from his gut. “You
Sherlock waited, listening.
He plucked up another and held it out toward John. “You can have some, too; I don’t mind sharing.”
Daddy makes a big groan at this and grabs his bum and shakes it like he can tear off a chunk to take away and keep. Locky squirms because it hurts and feels good all at once. His willy is hard and very drippy and he wants to rub it up against Daddy’s big cock, or feel Daddy’s hand or mouth on it, anything at all.
Sherlock started fiddling again with his experiment. “Mm,” he agreed. “When you get back, the game is on.”
“All right?”
“Open your mouth, pretty boy,” Daddy says then, and his voice is a little growly and he grabs hard at Locky’s bottom, rubbing and grabbing all over. Locky lets his eyes close a little, and lets his mouth open a little, and Daddy kisses him in that very grown-up way, with his thick tongue pressed in and sweeping, licking Locky’s tongue, then catching Locky’s wet bottom lip between his teeth, sucking it, shoving in his tongue again. Daddy’s hand behind Locky’s head holds him still so he can’t pull away even though the kisses are very wet and Locky is losing his breath. Daddy’s hand on his bum is grabbing hard, pinching, and Locky knows he will have marks there later to remind him that he is his Daddy’s boy; even though it hurts a bit—just a bit, nothing like a spanking with Daddy’s hairbrush or the wooden spoon—Locky likes it because it feels good, and because he knows Daddy will be pleased to see the marks he’s left there, later on, long after they’ve finished playing.
Sherlock hesitated. “Yes.”
John thought a minute; Sherlock waited patiently. The only sound was the skin of Sherlock’s thumb scraping vaguely against the back of John’s wrist as he stroked it back and forth, soothing, encouraging. Sherlock had stumbled straight onto the perfect phrase, that he loved all of John. John frequently lingered over the idea that he loved and wanted Sherlock in every way—stroppy, fidgety, stonily silent, publicly brilliant and made entirely of angles and edges, privately soft and needy and sweetly adoring. He would do this very same thing for Sherlock, if the tables were turned, he knew, in a heartbeat—John would take any scabby, horrid part of Sherlock’s heart and tuck into his own just to give Sherlock some relief. He could trust that Sherlock wasn’t just talking; he meant to do just that for John. And it really might help.
— “You know you’re meant to settle down and take your punishment. You oughtn’t be thinking about. . .”
Sherlock turned the tag over, scrutinized it. “It says Rex, but that’s only his surname.”
“Can I touch myself?” Locky asks, and he sounds a bit whiney but he can’t help it. “I need to.”
“Sorry, then.” John went back to dragging fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “So, do the boys at school use dirty words?”
“St George Rustington Rex.”
“How do you know you’re finished?” John asked, and found Sherlock’s wrist once more, digging beneath the sheets for it. Sherlock resisted his pull but John was insistent, and he held Sherlock’s palm steady so he could rock his prick up against it a bit, rolling his hips as he talked.
John laughed a little. “Of course you do. That’s fine. I won’t say a word.”
Sherlock hesitated again. “Yeah, I guess.”
. . .
“Sorry, sweetheart,” John apologized immediately. “I just got caught up in your sweet kisses.” He let his hand drift until it was tracing the shape of the pectoral muscle, and he tapped lightly with his thumb on Sherlock’s nipple. “Can I touch you here? Pet you here?” he asked.
biohazardous hovel. Safe at home. Just the two of them.
John tried to wave this away, too, but it wasn’t as easy. “Been through it in therapy. Years back. But every now and then things come up that poke at old wounds. Few and far between, but clearly this was one of those things. I don’t want to take out any of my dark mood on you, though, especially not. . .” he let it trail. He looked straight at Sherlock’s raindrop-shaped eyes. “What I love about this thing of ours is that even though it gets a bit rough now and again—“ he motioned at Sherlock’s awkward posture “what it’s really about is this absolutely precious
“Tell me,” Daddy pants at him, “Tell me what you like.”
“Toys?” Daddy offers. “Shall we get our toy box and you can pick one or two?”
“Love you too, Daddy” he said quickly. The wet way his voice sounded as he sucked on the candy made John have to shift a bit in his seat, but Sherlock only looked with curiosity at the carrier bags on the coffee table, craning his neck a bit.
“Not in our bed,” John said at last.
“Oh, my precious boy,” John murmured against his hair, and kissed him there. “I am so sorry that happened to you. I’m so terribly sorry it was scary and made you feel bad.” John rocked him a bit. He knew well that Sherlock liked to be rocked; it soothed him. “I’m so very, very sorry. Nothing like that should ever happen to a perfect, sweet boy like you.”
. You’re all right.” He turned over quickly, and wrapped John in his long, strong arms, kissed his hair there by his ear. John was shuddering, blubbering like he couldn’t remember ever doing before in his life. He let go a long wail against Sherlock’s chest, digging his fingers into Sherlock’s back.
Daddy’s whole body jumps and his back wants to bend, and the insides of Locky’s bottom suddenly feel fuller and more slippery than ever, and very warm.
Suddenly Sherlock gripped Johns’s hands tightly, “I love you John, I love you so much”
“You're kidding, she didn't take her eyes off you the whole time we were there!”
“I won’t.” They both knew it was a lie.
“Why?”
“No John I want you to stay, I never want you to go,” the lanky detective let out an all mighty cough and curled in on himself with a woeful, dramatic moan. Johns heart melted a little as he took in Sherlock's sorry state, fussing around with the bed clothes and pillows. Sherlock's face was white, a light sheen covering the pale skin as inky curls stuck to his face and splayed out at all angles like a demented halo. As much as Sherlock would deny it, he was quite simply run down, having a lingering cold coupled with no sleep or proper food since a particularly ridiculous case involving a tiger smuggler and a two mile foot chase thorough Camden Lock in the pouring rain.
“Kiss me, please John, please,” Sherlock Holmes didn't beg, even when he was chained to a wall in Syria nearing death as his captors beat him until he couldn't remember his own name he never begged, but having John Watson sink his teeth into his sensitive neck, soothing the nip with a soft kiss, could reduce him to a shaking, begging mess of arousal in seconds. The kiss continued, slightly tentative but so passionately neither were sure how much they could take. Sherlock moaned in bliss and pushed himself closer to John who cheekily lowered his hands to cup the luscious backside causing the taller man to gasp and push himself closer into the doctor. Suddenly Sherlock yelped when he accidentally pushed into John too hard, his wound protesting viciously.
“Yes, she is.” Sherlock agreed, he wandered over to the window pulling his dressing gown even tighter around his slim frame, “You haven't signed anything, you don't have to stay,” Sherlock’s voice was soft and laced with a tremble.
“It's not ok it’s shameful,” his voice was a spat whisper, as though he was loathe to speak the words, “I can't deny it John, I wish I could.”
“Maybe we should just get up!” John muttered with a snort.
“So you don't do all that then?”
“Don’t, I haven’t brushed my teeth!”
“I’ll let you off as long as you kiss me,” Sherlock drawled playfully pulling the doctor into his embrace
“This wine is great,” John enthused quickly, breaking the silence and taking a large sip.
“What?” Sherlock sounded genuinely surprised and spun around quickly, “no of course not, quite the opposite I would very much like you to stay but after what you've just heard…” he trailed off, looking away, his face crumpled and shoulders sagged in defeat, “and hearing it from that awful woman. I should have told you, I would have told you… It just didn't seem like the time, we were having such a truly wonderful time together and I just,” he sighed dejectedly, “it doesn't matter, these are just excuses, I’m sorry John.”
Sherlock pulled his hand away indignantly, “It must be so terrible having two people love you John! How very hard for you, do you ever think how difficult it is for me, to see you with her, knowing you chose her, after everything we’ve been through, after what she did to me! I didn’t think you would stay with the woman who put a bullet in my chest!”
“I'm a man with a past too. I have demons, I’ve done things I'm not proud of. When you met me I was a traumatised army captain with a psychosomatic limp on the brink of suicide. But I’m not defined by my past and neither are you. Sherlock in just a week you've changed my life, given me hope again, make me laugh, made me feel alive, been a friend to me. You're a good man, you have a past, that doesn't change how I feel.”
“Such a diva Dr Watson, but I will be the gracious host and make you a coffee but don’t come back out here with clothes on because I’m not done staring at the sexy naked man in my bed!”
“Sherlock,” John murmured breathlessly, “so we're both a little broken but we’re also insanely good together. But I do have to tell you one thing that might change everything… I split coffee on your dressing gown!” John chuckled a little as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
“It's ok John, I’m fine, I promise.” Sherlock smiled his catlike smile but there was something genuine behind his eyes, something innocent, something loving, a glint John rarely saw but knew that when he did, it was just for him. “You can hug me you know, I know you're quite partial to a bit of physical affection in times of emotional upheaval.”
“Morning,” John practically grunted his voice thick and ruff, his face morphing into a scowl as he adjusted to the light
“I'm fine, maybe it's the painkillers, but I would very much like you to embrace me.” Carefully, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, so gently he may as well be made of glass. “I was so scared, Sherlock,” John whispered pulling him just a little bit tighter, “it was like being back at the hospital where you were lifeless on the pavement, your brains on the floor, bleeding, dead at my feet.” Before John could stop himself there were tears running down his face, his body quivering as he held his dearest friend tightly, finally allowing his grief that he'd hidden and battled with for so long, to surface.
“I honestly have no idea why he's back.”
“I don't understand.. .”
"Sorry," Sherlock muttered once more. "
“Oh,” there was a thick silence that hung uncomfortably, John didn't know what to say as he eventually connected the dots when Sherlock looked away awkwardly, pulling his ridiculously expensive dressing gown tighter around his thin frame. The man who had no qualms about running starkers from the bath as he'd just cracked his latest experiment and apparently putting on clothes was a waste of time when there were rotting maggots and buffalo tongues to attend to, could no longer bring himself to reveal his scarred body to his most trusted companion.
“Dr Watson?” John blinked and looked around, disorientated and groggy with a sharp pain in his head, pulsing down his eye and making his whole head bang. “Sherlock? Where's Sherlock!” He grunted in pain but was adamant he was getting out of bed.
“No Sherlock, it's not all that matters!”
“Back in the room, love,” John said gently stroking Sherlock’s cheek, gently manoeuvring the detective to face him, “its ok, I can see that amazing brain of yours is going into overdrive! Let me save you some time, I like it both ways, top or bottom, or neither, sex certainly isn’t just penetration. I’m bisexual, I’ve had boyfriends and girlfriends and no I haven’t been with anyone since I was discharged. Think that covers everything?”
“So you like boys?” John’s frankness surprised even himself but he couldn't help himself as this beautiful, strange creature was clearly unashamedly flirting with him.
“There was always something to fight for, always a reason to keep going no matter how bad it got. Keeping you, Molly, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade safe, coming back to Baker Street, seeing my parents again, being back with you, that's what kept me going. It was a battle but I won it, I did my job, it was worth the fight.” The grip on John’s hand suddenly became tighter, “This was a bullshit mission they made Mycroft send me on, some abstract drug cartel in the middle of nowhere that the secret service are too incompetent to solve, or don't want to risk their own men to bring it down. I don't want to fight again John.”
“Perfect, spread your legs you gorgeous creature!”
“Cocaine?”
“Stop it,” Sherlock's voice was a soft whisper, a lightness about it John hadn't heard in a while.
“It feels amazing, you’re amazing!” Sherlock babbled, coming further undone in the doctor’s arms.
“Good job we have some coffee!”
“Sleep well”
“She dotes on you, I could tell the second I met her. Oh god, she’s not waiting to give me the break his heart I break your legs lecture is she?”
John chuckled as Sherlock flopped back into bed, smiling as John's arm flung across his chest and a soft kiss was planted on his cheek before the stunning army doctor fell back to sleep.
“You ok?” John asked a little warily.
“Take it easy, why don't we stay in bed for a bit longer, I can make us some coffee, we can doze and cuddle,” he said the last word with a mischievous chuckle.
For a while Sherlock simply sat, letting the silence consume him, he needed to do something, anything. It was pushing midnight he really should go to bed, his abused body was crying for rest after the cocaine related stunt he'd just pulled but his mind was racing. Trembling hands betrayed him once again, he needed something to get through this, his heart was hammering and he wondered if he might hyperventilate right there and then, how undignified. Really Sherlock needed a large glass of water and a binge of sleep, but in reality he was going to put some sort of harmful substance in his body and work on a bizarre experiment until he literally collapsed. John had left some scotch there, that might do the trick. Sometimes after a case they would pour themselves a generous dose before engaging in some less than angelic activities or even just drifting off into a comfortable sleep after putting the world to right. Sherlock lived for those moments, yes the sex was amazing of course, it was with John Watson after all, but it was the intimacy, the warmth the camaraderie that Sherlock lived for and what he missed the most. Sherlock shook his head quickly, willing those thoughts to leave before they consumed him. The scotch wasn't going to cut it, he couldn't bear drinking it without John anyway, there was a pack of cigarettes under the second floor board nearest the fire, quite why he hid them he wasn't sure, no one was around to check, he could smoke himself into a coma in the lounge if he so chose and no one would be none the wiser until poor Mrs Hudson discovered his corpse when she brought him a cuppa.
John chuckled, “I don't want to hurt you, you've just had major surgery.”
“I know darling, of course go look after him, if you need anything will you call?”
“Because you should be! I'd think you were mad to stay now you know who I really am!”
“Don't be ridiculous, you're so far out of my league.”
Lestrade was clearly mortified but the absolute death glare John was shooting sent him on his way pretty quickly, needless to say he didn't remind Sherlock about his statement before leaving.
“Never, I will never let you go Sherlock, ever.”
“I didn't want to suffer either,” Sherlock murmured, “in my youth, drugs were how I took myself out of the hell that I found reality to be. For a long time I could never truly fathom finding a place in this miserable world, I never knew how I fit into it, how to fit in with others. Then I discovered that drugs took the edge off reality, they sharpened my focus, allowed me to block out the foolish distractions, they made the world make more sense, something I always struggled with. John, I don't need to lie to you, manipulate you into believing one false excuse or another, you always get the truth from me. As much as I try to deny it, recently I've found myself distracted, as pathetic as it sounds I feel somewhat lost and am unable to resist reverting back to my old habits. For a long time I've not been tempted, I never felt the need, I had the work, I have people who for some unfathomable reason care about me and the world made a little bit more sense... but at present my world does not make much sense and the drugs seem to be a struggle I cannot overcome. I need something to sharpen my focus, to keep my mind vaguely sane and to stop the distractions of this hellish reality. I was going to be exiled John, likely get my head blown off in the middle of nowhere,” he sighed and rubbed his red eyes, “I didn't want to fight any more, I'd already fought for two miserable, lonely years. I'm older, weaker and I've had a bullet through my chest since then. Yes, there were times after the fall when I was on top of the world, where I lived for the adrenaline but I didn't fake my death to be clever, you know that. It wasn't all terrible but it was hard, it was lonely, it was painful, you've seen what they did to me.”
“You're not the only one who was saved this week.” Their eyes met, a stare so intense everything else it the room evaporated, the only sounds were soft breathing and a crackling fire.
“Says the supermodel.”
“Sherlock! Talk to me, you were high before you got on that plane, before you even knew about Moriarty. You nearly overdosed, you nearly bloody died Sherlock, Jesus Christ you nearly died, again! I thought we were done with that!” John slammed his mug down, his voice rising in anger but shaking hands and his pained expression gave away his anguish, “Why, Sherlock, why would you do that again?” John’s voice was a cracked whisper his eyes boring into the pale face, silently pleading for the icy orbs to meet his own. Sherlock looked up, his face softened, out of guilt or melancholy John wasn’t sure but clearly the reality of what John meant struck a nerve, it wasn't the first time John had watched Sherlock die. The harsh reality of John’s words resonated with the detective as he looked at his doctor, his best friend, his saviour, his lover and started to speak, his voice soft.
“I’m not yours to worry about John,” the words stung as they made way for a dark silence that hung in the air, the bitter lack of sound taunted them. Neither were able to look at the other as Sherlock simply slumped in the sofa and looked away as John stared at the cold toast waiting for his watery vision to clear.
Anxiousness forgotten, Sherlock threw his head back and opened his legs, he couldn't remember the last time he was this excited, this unashamedly turned on!
“Yes but I’ll continue to be a gentleman and have the first shower so you can enjoy your coffee in peace!”
“Sherlock I really need it now!”
Donovan bristled and turned away, but as she walked away, turned back to John, squaring back up to him and with dripping relish spat out the words, “Did he suck you off for a hit then, Doctor?”
“Take it easy love,” John said softly, dropping to the chair whilst gently bringing Sherlock into his lap, continuing to kiss the detective thoroughly, grinding their bodies together in glorious passion.
“I'm sorry. I love you Sherlock Holmes, I always will.”
Sherlock chuckled and took a swig of wine, he licked a stray drop and John felt a twang of something deep in his gut as Sherlock’s tongue flickered over his plump lips and John quickly took a huge gulp himself to mask his gaping mouth.
“You nearly died, you can't nearly die on me again. I've lost you once and damm well nearly lost you again on that operating table, I can't do it again. You can't leave me again.”
“If it makes you feel better to think that,” the detective muttered, reluctantly taking a tiny bite of the cold toast, “I don't think that is a discussion to be had right now.” Sherlock murmured through a mouthful of crumbs, his face wrinkling in distain at the cold, hard bread, pushing the plate away, looking even more queasy that before.
“Who you really are? You're a man with a past, with ghosts with struggles like anyone else, like me, why would I leave because of that?”
John went back to Baker Street with Sherlock, no one questioned it, no one raised an eyebrow, it was a given, as sure as the sunrise. Sherlock Holmes had just been brought back to life after a near fatal overdose of a cocktail of class A drugs on route to an untimely and likely unpleasant exile for shooting a corrupt media tycoon in the head, thus ending his grip on John Watson’s former-assassin wife. So of course John was going back to Baker Street, it was laughable that he wouldn't. Mycroft’s typically ostentatious Mercedes dropped them off, not before Mary had been taken home with a feeble protest from John that he should stay with his heavily pregnant wife, of course everyone knew that was just for show. Upon arriving at 221b the older Holmes had bid them goodnight with nothing more than a curt nod to Sherlock and a meaningful look to the Doctor that both moved and frightened him to his usually unshakable core. Hanging up his trademark coat with trembling hands, Sherlock flopped to the sofa with all the grace of a drunken platypus and surprisingly didn't resume his usual thinking pose or huddled up to one side in his childish display of distain. Instead, Sherlock simply sat there staring intently at the wallpaper with glassy, unfocused eyes. With a sad sigh, John appeared with some tea at the detective’s side moments later and Sherlock wrinkled his nose, he could smell the sugar John had heaped in, ever his protector was the good doctor. Silently, John sat in his chair, nursing his own cup, casting the occasional concerned glance at the detective’s billowy profile.
“I'll make some more tea,” John muttered, unable to bare the silence he hurried to the kitchen, the chances of anything being consumed were slim but he had to do something, he was a bloody doctor for Christ sakes, John couldn't let his friend suffer, especially as he knew full well he was part of the reason for Sherlock’s anguish. John heaped some sugar into the tea and brought it to the detective, who was curled up against the back of the settee. John took a moment to stare, he couldn't help it, neither of them ever could, which is partly why they were in this damm mess he thought bitterly. Sherlock looked wrecked, there were no two ways about it. Pale to the point of grey, skinny as a rake and dark, sunken eyes more haunted, more pained than John had ever seen. It broke his heart to see his beautiful madman in such a state but what shattered it was that deep down John knew he was part of the reason for Sherlock’s pain. Every time he and Sherlock were so much as in the same room John asked himself what he was doing, why they weren't together, why neither of them had done anything about the overwhelming passion that burned between them. John hated himself for it, he'd cheated on his wife with his best friend, who he then pretty much abandoned when Mary fell pregnant. Realistically Mary probably never suspected anything, undoubtably John's borderline obsession with his best friend’s resurrection irked her a little but the chances of her figuring out that John was in fact having the best sex of his life with his eccentric former flatmate, not innocently crashing on the sofa for convenience after a case, was highly doubtful.
“I’m sorry,” John whispered, “I'm so sorry, you're still by best friend, I still care so much about you, I love you Sherlock, you know that.”
“Something tells me you're not joking!” The room was quiet again and John took Sherlock’s hand and said softly, “can I kiss you again?”
“No, please, you have to let me come in with him!”
“How do you feel?” Sherlock’s tone was shy but there was a glimmer of hope behind his piecing eyes.
“I'd like to change that too, John. You are kind and noble not to mention the most beautiful man I’ve ever laid eyes on. For the record I’m not going to run a mile, you have a past too and I hope you will one day feel able to share that with me. You are special John Watson, nothing could say would change that.”
“That's not what I meant.”
"No don't get up, dull as it is you need to rest.”
“Droll as ever Doctor, you know what I mean.”
Without warning he took Sherlock’s face in his hands, his heart breaking at the tear-stains and continued speaking, his voice urgent, “Life is complicated right now and I wish it wasn’t, I can’t change that Mary is having my baby.
“Morning,” his voice was thick with sleep and he couldn't help but smile as a tender kiss was planted on his cheek.
“That’s very chivalrous but I would very much like to fuck you and correct me if I’m wrong but you’re lusting for my cock inside you aren’t you!”
John chuckled, “well you’ll have to. Now I don’t have to deal with the early wakeup calls I’ve come to realise I’m not a morning person! Also morning sex is far more enjoyable when a I don’t taste like a rubbish bin and I’ve had a cup of coffee.”
Creeping back into the bedroom Sherlock shut the door as quietly as he could, for the first time in quite a while he was not alone in his bed. Turning around Sherlock allowed himself to look at his sleeping bedfellow, it was almost too intimate to bear, Sherlock knew he shouldn't really be staring
“Yes, go and be with her, bring your child into the world. It’s all ok, it’s good, this is good, John!” Sherlock cupped Johns face who looked like he was going to be sick and continued reassuringly, “Text me and I’ll come to the hospital, it will be ok.You can do this John I know you can.”
“I don't deserve you John Watson. I never have. Taking the drugs was a foolish decision I know that,” Sherlock ran his hands through his unruly hair, the shake in his hands was still evident, his tone was soft and sad. “Life is hard John, I don’t know what else to say. I know I’ve let you down again.”
“You need to eat something,” John said, suddenly hauling them out of the awkward silence they found themselves drowning in.
“You’ll never be pedestrian,” John said softly, taking Sherlock’s hand with a small smile he hoped Sherlock would return, “it’s been a difficult few months. I know, you’re suffering and I don’t want you to suffer. I’m so sorry Sherlock its just with Mary and the baby…” John trailed off his face flushing a little, “I want us to be together, please know that, you’re the person I’m meant to be with. It’s just right now I need to support Mary, she’s having my baby, I don’t have a choice.”
“Perhaps, but I understand that you wouldn't want to live here with a man like me.”
“Sorry John,” Sherlock murmured, rolling up the sleeve of his increasingly grubby dressing gown. The heroin was some of the good stuff, he couldn't even remember how it came to be in his possession, he had more than enough money and time on his hands to get the best quality with relative ease nowadays. Maybe things would look up when the baby came and life calmed down, Sherlock thought, his mind frantic and bitter, maybe their unrequited love would win and maybe Sherlock would finally sort his pathetic life out and be the man that John Watson deserved. Or maybe John will be with Mary forever and Sherlock will continue to not do a thing about it like the coward he truly was.
“It's ok,” John murmured, carefully manoeuvring to press against the skinny detective who threw his arms around the broad back, cringing as his heavy cast knocked into John's neck who like the gentleman he was, ignored it, masking the grunt of surprise with a moan.
“Erm, yes.”
“You could have died.”
“Yes, so you have a past, you did some bad things, made some poor decisions maybe you had moments of being a bad person. But I have a past too, are you going to run a mile? I’ve gone to war, I've killed people, some of the things I've seen, some of the things I've had to do…” he trailed off, his haunted eyes compelling Sherlock to take his hand softly.
“Resting is dull,” Sherlock replied but he shot John a wry smile making a half hearted attempt to get up from the sofa.
“Shush you, I'm a doctor and the only person crazy enough to come and look after you despite your torrent of verbal abuse, so shut up and let me make you tea before I change my mind.” “Yes, Captain,” Sherlock murmured but found himself relieved not to move, his dressings uncomfortable, limbs heavy and body aching.
“I’m sorry boys, really I am. Take it easy, pint on me yeah.”
“You haven’t let me down.” John reached over and gently laid a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, “We’ll get through this, I’m not going to let you suffer.”
“Ok, I'm sorry Greg, I don't know what happened it seemed so real. It was like I was right back there at St Barts. I knew he wasn't dead I could hear him talking for God sake. I don't know what happened.”
“Yes John, I’m ready, make love to me!”
“Fuck yes!” John moaned, although Sherlock was feeling a little smug he was soon overwhelmed with arousal once more when John’s hands firmly landed on his arse.
Sherlock reached over and planted a passionate snog on his lips, “it would be my pleasure Doctor Watson!”
The mortified inspector and his gleeful lapdog turned to leave but a tanned arm suddenly pushed the door closed and before Donavan could blink, she had 5 foot 8 of enraged army doctor blocking her path. Teeth bared, face curled into a menacing snarl and stance intimidating, Captain Watson squared up to her, getting a mere inch from her face, despite her slight height advantage she physically recoiled, startling at the predator that had clearly been unleashed in this unsuspecting man in a too long dressing gown and morning after hair.
“Out!” Lestrade hissed, anger bubbling but a clear flush in his face. Feeling rage overtake him, John balled his fists, shooting a rather terrifying snarl at Donovan before directing an unpleasant glare to the DI who looked somewhere between throwing up and wanting the ground to swallow him while. John sucked in a breath ready for an argument, ready to fight as team Sherlock but to his surprise, the tall man remained silent, unmoving from the spot in the corner. Sherlock’s face was white, a tremble in his hands, he wasn’t saying anything, he wasn’t denying anything, he couldn't look at John, the silence was deafening.
“I think Donovan has covered it,” Sherlock’s words were hissed, he slumped further into the chair, playing with the collar of his robe nervously.
“You're a good man Sherlock, I’ve only known you a short while but you've changed my life for the better. You're a man with a past, there's a lot I don't know about you, there's a lot about me you don't know, but over time, I hope we can change that.”
“John, I can't hack fooling around I feel like death warmed up.”
“No, she’ll love you John. And if not she’d just poison you, nothing messy don’t worry!”
With a filthy moan Sherlock came, screaming John's name as the good doctor pumped his shaft and thrust into him with a wild abandonment that the detective relished. After riding his orgasm, Sherlock was aware that his companion was in the throws of one himself, his eyes were unfocused, sweat was tantalisingly dripping down his face and his thrusts were frantic and erratic.
“I thought you’d never ask,” lips met in a passionate kiss, hands explored eager flesh as the lovers became one.
“Why not?” The usual air of mocking superiority Sherlock liked to drawl out when he was avoiding something was barely there, his tone was flat, his gaze to the floor.
“I didn't say that, I said women aren't my area,” Sherlock brought the glass to his lips, looking over it with a gaze that suddenly smouldered, his pupils blown wide, almost covering the hypnotic blue irises, a seductive smile playing at his lips.
“Let's go to the bedroom,” Sherlock purred and took Johns’ hand before the doctor could even fathom a response and led him into the bedroom. Stumbling slightly as eager hands and lips refused to separate, John's jumper had got lost on the journey as had Sherlock’s beloved dressing gown, although John was fairly sure it wasn't in a crumpled heap unlike his M and S finest! Approaching the bed, typically over zealous Sherlock pulled John down onto the mattress, the linen unmade as usual, but he hissed when they landed.
Sherlock was greying by the second as he spoke, his hands shaking, John ever the doctor thrust a nearby glass of water at him and rubbed his shoulder comfortingly as Sherlock shakily continued, “Mycroft bailed me out, another shameful detail, technically I hadn't committed a crime but it was a fairly unfavourable position to be found in. I got clean, went to rehab did all the things you’re supposed to do and set up my consulting firm. Sometime later I worked with the yard, Sally never liked me, I couldn't resist showing her up, once she endangered a life through her own carelessness, I won't have that. She lost a promotion because I called her out, her own stupid fault,” he spat the last words but continued, “so she did a little digging put two and two together and now any opportunity brings it up. So there you have it John, I had a serious drug problem and sold myself to pay for it, shameful. For what it's worth John please know that I'm clean now, I haven't touched it since then, please believe me.”
“I know, it's ok John, it's ok.” To Sherlock’s complete horror he could feel tears pricking but he'd be dammed if he let them fall, instead he blinked them back and held John even tighter.
“I've got you my darling, I've got you.” John shucked off his clothes and pulled on a pair of pyjamas before sliding next to Sherlock who instantly threw himself into the warm embrace burying his clammy face in John’s shoulder, John's good shoulder of course, which was fine because John preferred to sleep on the left anyhow. The bed upstairs was just for show, John hadn't slept there since he moved out the only visit it had was when Lestrade was too drunk to stagger home and he had to sleep the hangover off before he picked up his kids, if the Inspector had clocked that John and Sherlock weren't just being good mates by sharing a bed and letting him have the spare room, he didn't say anything.
“Marys’ in labour isn't she?” Sherlock hadn’t seen the text but naturally he’d deduced its contents effortlessly, John simply nodded, mouth agape.
“Donovan!” Lestrade barked furiously at her but the nasty smile on her face lingered.
Sherlock cleared his throat and topped up the wine again, fumbling a little with the lid.
“Dr Watson, please calm down, Mr Holmes is in good hands.”
“Into bed with you, yes I do.”
“It's not ok, no, let me see him please!” The world was spinning, the air was becoming thick, John needed to gulp it in but his throat was closing, he couldn't think, he couldn’t stand, he couldn't even breathe. The only thing he could do was whisper a name before the world went black and darkness consumed him.
The silence was consuming, John felt like he was drowning, he could barely breath through the tension. They used to share laughter, stories, friendship and later passion in these very seats, now they could barely look at each other.
“Tell me what you want love,” John whispered, bringing his lips into Sherlock’s ear, who gasped as the hot breath met his skin and sent chills much further south. John’s tone had suddenly darkened, deliciously his tone dropping half an octave, a lustful power in his bright eyes, Captain Watson was making an appearance! “Do you want me to suck you, do you want to fuck me… oh you want me to fuck you?”
“I worry, yes things are complicated but nothing has changed how important you are or how I feel about you.”
“Far more exciting indeed, god this feels good,” Just as John let out a breathy moan a shrill shriek cut through the air interrupting them stopping the pair in their horny tracks.
“I'll always take care of you,” perhaps against his better judgment John went over to the settee and sat next to Sherlock, “I know things have been,” John hesitated not wanting to admit to the devastating distance that was forcing itself between them, “a little difficult lately butI mean it, I will always take care of you so talk to me, please. You nearly died and I can't let that happen again. I can't just walk away knowing you might bloody overdose again. Talk to me Sherlock, I'm here, I care about you, let me help you. Tell me, please tell me why, I need to understand, I need to help.”
Sherlock laughed but he could feel the blush creeping down his chest, he'd never been called sexy in his life!
Sherlock sighed, he looked utterly defeated, John couldn't bare it, he reached for the trembling hand but thought better of it, laying his hand on a nearby pillow instead and simply listened as Sherlock quietly spoke.
“It's an open relationship.”
“He doesn't have anyone else, Mary, he needs me.”
“Dinner?”
Sherlock flushed, his sweat induced rosy glow deepened and he made a non-committal noise,
“I will, I love you too, Mary.”
“Stop John, please.” Sherlock’s voice broke, he looked away hiding the tear that was slipping down his cheek.
“Yes Mary, just finishing this chapter.”
“I don’t think I can wait that long to kiss you!”
Sherlock sighed, John would be out the door tomorrow anyway, there was no way to tell his shameful story that would put him in a good light and thanks to Donovan's gleeful reveal of Sherlock’s sordid past the good doctor would never want to be near him again anyway. Deducing the worst possible outcome had already been sealed Sherlock decided he may as well reveal the ugly truth, it was likely the last conversation they’d ever have, might as well be the truth.
“Everyone is fine, no one is in danger, you'd probably be in more danger if they were to discover me on that blasted mission, you're happy John, that's all I've ever wanted. Last time I fought for us, for our friendship, what might have been, for the hope of having you in my life again. You're safe, you're happy, that's all that matters.”
John smirked a nasty, intimidating smirk and puffed out his chest, “I’ve just returned from Captaining my 4th tour in Afghanistan, I have seen things your tiny, ignorant mind can only imagine. I’ve shot people, I’ve put people back together in the middle of a desert with nothing but gauze and Jesus as bullets have flown past my eyes. I’ve been to war, I don’t need to take advice from you, thanks.”
“Dear god yes!” Sherlock chuckled but as he pushed the shirt off John’s back he sobered for a second, voice a little nervous, “You're sure though, you’re ok with… this sort of thing?”
Despite his natural desire to protest, and continue ripping the clothes off the sexy doctor, Sherlock had to agree that splitting open his chest open whilst he engaging in the long overdue desire to have John in his bed was probably not the best plan. To Sherlock’s annoyance, his movement was rather restricted, his entire left side was throbbing and the broken wrist rendered his arm useless until the blasted cast was off.
Sherlock staggered out, pale to the point of being white, an unhealthy sheen across his face as he flopped down on the sofa, reaching for the tea with shaking hands.
“This isn't unannounced, I've text you, left you a voicemail and also told you last night I'd be round. We need your statement as soon as possible, you've been doing this long enough to know that so don't act so affronted,” Lestrade rolled his eyes and sat on the sofa uninvited, his voice weary but his tone calm.
“Yes.” John didn't ask how Sherlock knew, John knew he knew, the second they set eyes on each other they both knew what was happening. They both knew this was the last time they would be together in this way, John needed to choose and he would choose Mary and the baby. Sherlock didn't blame him, in fact he'd despise John for leaving his pregnant wife to continue an affair with his sociopathic flatmate, it was time to choose.
“Sherlock,” John trailed off, “my love, please don’t cry. You don't believe me. Of course, why would you, I’ve not given you any reason to believe me. Jesus, what the fuck am I doing!”
“Well that's good to hear,” John murmured, delighted that a blush had crept into Sherlock’s pale cheeks, a curl falling perfectly across those icy orbs which John was starting to drown in.
“It's ok,” Sherlock said gently, needing to offer some reassurance even if it was hollow.
“Don't you have to get back?”
“Go,” Sherlocks voice was a whisper, “You need to go, it’s ok.”
Sherlock felt his face redden and quickly threw another log into the crackling fire so he could turn his rosy face away.
John only felt a little bit guilty when he sent the text to Mary that the case had run late so he was going to crash at Baker Street. Mary was a smart lady, a very smart lady and if Sherlock had been a woman there was no way in hell John would be getting away with the affair. As much as John convinced himself it wasn't, an affair is exactly what was happening, John was having an affair with Sherlock Holmes, it was ridiculous, it was wrong, it was unfair but John couldn't stop, he didn't want to stop. Whilst he'd be lying if he said there wasn't a bit of guilt when he went back to Mary, when he was with Sherlock nothing else seemed to matter, everything else was conveniently forgotten. So many times he convinced himself it was the last time, that he would in fact crash on the sofa, enjoy an innocent takeaway with his longtime best friend after solving their latest case. Yet each and every time they ended up naked and spent, yearning for one another, needing to be close, desperate for the touch, for the intimacy of being together.
“Wow she's a complete bitch,” John said, a venomous bite in his words.
“I’m here, Sherlock”
“You should be running a mile after what you’ve just heard about me,” Sherlock said with a bitter laugh.
“Great, do you have lube?”
“Pleasure as always Sergeant Donovan,” Sherlock snarled, unable to resist, “send my love to Anderson or have you finally realised he’s screwing the postman as well as you and his wife?”
“I want you,” Sherlock moaned, nipping at John’s ear, thrusting his tongue in for good measure, John shuddered in pleasure as Sherlock smirked mischievously, he knew exactly how to get the doctor fired up.
“All of what?”
Sherlock’s tone was suddenly harsh, an uncontrolled desperation to his voice and he looked away, his face as bitter as his words.
“Damm my stupid transport needing such dull activities as food and sleep!” The outburst would have had far more conviction if Sherlock hadn't thrust his head in the pillows, flopping down dramatically with an undignified sniff and a pout on those full lips that John could never resist.
“I would never hurt you John but I’m tired, so tired, I’m in pain and you’re in pain. This isn’t what I fought for, this isn't how the battle was supposed to end.”
Sherlock’s kiss pecked the corner of John’s mouth who groaned and batted him away playfully
“I miss you John,” Sherlock’s voice was a whisper, tears threatening his vision, leaning into the Doctor’s soft touch a little, “It is like we are strangers, so close but so far apart. I can’t bare it.”
. . .
Sherlock turned his head. “I don’t like this,” he said quietly.
“Dr Watson, please it's ok.”
“Sherlock, we should…” Before either could form a complete sentence, two pairs of lips came together, the kiss was a little tentative although neither were keen to pull away eventually releasing with a breathy moan. For a moment their eyes locked, the grip on each other tightened and their eyes twinkled before lips once again crashed together this time in a needy, passion kiss that had both of them groaning in bliss as eager hands explored bodies.
“It's so good to see you up, I thought we lost you,” Johns voice was quiet and his speech was hurried as he let out the breath he was unknowingly holding; he reached for Sherlock’s hand and squeezed it tightly trying to keep the shake out of his voice.
“You're the one who shot him, you saved me John and I sincerely thank you for that.”
at the sleeping form but he couldn't help it. The faintest glimmer of sparkling moonlight was shining through the gap in the curtains catching that stunning face, seemingly illuminating the tanned skin. Sherlock released the breath he didn't even realise he was holding. John Watson is the most stunningly beautiful man he'd ever laid eyes on and now he was in Sherlock Holmes’ bed after a glorious night of laughter and friendship unexpectedly ended in a far more intimate way. Allowing himself another moment to drink John in, Sherlock marvelled at the beautiful doctor, how could he not? It was no surprise John was an army man, his body was firm, gently toned under that hideously endearing wooly jumper. During their wonderfully endless conversations Sherlock had got lost in John's eyes on more than one occasion, there was pain behind them, a deep rooted anguish the soldier probably wasn't even aware he carried around but they were also so beautiful. Honesty and kindness shone through the hazel orbs and there was an infectious glint in them when he laughed, a sound that Sherlock was sure not many people were lucky enough to hear.
With a smile John examined the bottle and emptied the rest between their two glasses.
Wisely, without another word Donovan practically ran out of the room,
“No, he fell, I saw him, he fell, he might be dead I must see him, no please!” John knew he was screaming, knew he was probably going to get himself put in the psych ward but he didn't care. Sherlock Holmes had fallen off a balcony, well he'd been pushed but John was in no mood for technicalities. It happened in a split second and all John could do was watch as poor Sherlock landed in a crumpled heap, it was only one storey high, it wasn't a rooftop, he clearly hadn't smashed his skull but John couldn't make sense of that. All he could see was Sherlock Holmes falling off a high building, a short gasp falling from his lips as he shouted for John when he realised he had lost the struggle with both the perp and gravity and he was only going one way, which wasn't up. John had screamed, by the time he got to Sherlock, administering basic first aid with shaking hands, Lestrade was pulling him away. All John could do as the paramedics tended to him was clutch Sherlock’s hand, begging him to wake up as he drifted in and out of consciousness, his piercing eyes fluttering open before drifting back to the darkness, the only word he had uttered was a slurred whisper.
“Sorry, Mrs Hudson came up, she made these actually so I guarantee its better than mine, but I did carry it to you so I still get the chivalrous points.”
“John you passed out and smacked your head so hard you cracked your forehead open. Sherlock will be fine mate but you need to rest ok?”
“Why, because you're a man with a past?”
“That's enough Donovan, we’re leaving,” Lestrade muttered, he shot an apologetic glance to Sherlock which the detective did not return, his slender form was hunched over, arms wrapped tightly around his torso. A flush had spread across his cheeks and neck but there was a look of anguished mortification on his handsome face that John wanted to kiss right off.
“Well thats ruined the mood, I cant do this whilst I know she’s outside the door!”
“Can you not hold your liquor, Mr Holmes?”
“Yours, all yours.” Sherlock was in bliss, John was always an excellent lover but tonight, this was something else, something new, something frightening, something even more incredible. Considerate and tender, John was generous when they were in bed, making sure his partners’ needs were taken care of, that Sherlock was satisfied and enjoying himself. Whilst Sherlock wasn't a virgin, the whole process of secretly shagging his former flatmate every which way to Sunday was undeniably a little overwhelming and to this day the detective relied on his blogger to initiate anything intimate if mutual desire hadn't dragged them into the sack first. Kind but daring, dominant but compassionate, John knew what Sherlock wanted, not just to get him off but what he craved yet never dared to ask for. John always seemed to know when Sherlock couldn't handle much more than a cheeky fumble, too overwhelmed too exhausted for much else. When Sherlock wanted to release his darkest desires John willingly indulged, eagerly typing him up, teasing the skinny body until all Sherlock could do was beg for that earth shattering orgasm. As much as Sherlock loved John pleasuring him, the good doctor was equally glorious to please, making the most wonderful noises, exposing his perfect jugular as his head was thrown back in pure ecstasy. John was a soldier after all and the delicious mix of colourful profanity, utter filth and unwavering sentiment flowing from the perfect lips never failed to get the detective hot under his recently-shed collar and committed every sound the doctor made to memory, reserving a glorious room in his mind palace to store all the fabulous sounds. Sherlock always enjoyed being with John, they had incredible sex but it was the intimacy, the trust that Sherlock yearned for. Truth be told, Sherlock would be happy with a fully clothed spooning session simply stroking John’s hair until the doctor fell asleep in his arms, drooling on his shoulder. Simply being with John, holding him, loving him was enough for the madman who never wanted the blogger out of his sight. The whole thing was madness, terrifyingly brilliant, beautiful madness that could never end yet Sherlock knew it was about to come crashing down around him…
“I, its, I have to…”
“And John, when you leave, don't wake me, go when I'm asleep. I can't watch you leave John, I can't do that.”
“Sherlock, you are the most important person in my life, you must know that.”
“Just do one thing for me.”
Every bone in Sherlock’s thin body ached, seriously ached to the point that he wasn't sure how much longer he could physically stay on his feet. There was no dramatic or gruesome injury to speak of, the detective was quite simply destroyed, so utterly exhausted that even just standing was becoming increasingly difficult. It had been nearly 6 months since his apparent death and he was starting to wonder if actually smashing his skull open on the floor of St. Barts might well have been kinder. Sleeping wasn't always a luxury he could afford and sleeping in an actual bed with an actual duvet in a room with carpet, heating and God forbid a door was a luxury he hadn't seen in a while. Sherlock didn't think he was an overly materialistic person, he'd lived in a crack den high off his face for almost a year, ones standards did dip a little after that, but today Sherlock had never wanted a comfy bed and hot bath more, how he longed to slip into his silk dressing gown and sheepskin slippers and curl up on the beaten leather of Baker Streets settee. Sherlock missed the cozy little flat dreadfully but he only yearned for one thing and it broke his heart just thinking about it; John Watson, his loyal companion, good doctor and best and only true friend.
John wanted things that Sherlock could never give him and certainly had no desire to give him, after all he was most definitely not father material. Mycroft could probably adopt him some kids pretty easily if he so chose, he could plonk the crying, smelly little thing on John's lap and give him the domesticity he craved. But that would be cruel, irresponsible and in Sherlock's mind, downright tedious. Sherlock was a ridiculous man but he wouldn't put an innocent child through the bedlam that was his life and quite frankly couldn't stand the thought himself! One couldn't really say to a toddler, ‘would you mind just looking after yourself as Daddy is going to run through London after a knife wielding Russian Mobster, which will likely end in a dramatic first fight and a gory injury, then Daddy is going to sleep for 12 hours, have a cigarette then fuck other Daddy senseless.’ Sherlock was too selfish, too volatile and quite frankly too uninterested. He was a train wreck really, a junkie through and through desperately seeking his hit, he made his best friend, the greatest thing that ever happened to him, watch his tragic and bloody death. John was too good, far too good for him and the idea of John leaving his nice, normal wife was a tragically laughable thought... So Sherlock made every single second with the good doctor count. Sherlock knew this would end, it would probably crash and burn and kill them both a little bit, damage their already irreparable souls. Yet when John moaned in his ear, 'my beauty, my love,' as his lips soothed a tender nip to his sensitive neck, at that glorious moment in time, Sherlock couldn't bring himself to care.
Returning a little while later with two steaming mugs Sherlock handed one to John said playfully, “Took your time, I’m getting cold here!”
“Stop what?”
“I want to, please…” he trailed off, gasping as John nipped his ear, kissing his face softly.
“Good morning, Doctor Watson,” Sherlock murmured, planting a gentle kiss on his companion’s cheek
“Are we going to talk?” John asked in his doctor voice, low and eerily calm, Sherlock had to resist rolling his eyes.
“I'm not talking about Moriarty,” John snapped, “why the drugs?”
“I don't want to hear it from her, I want to hear it from you,” John’ said gently.
“This was a one off,” John said firmly trying to keep his tone gentle and reassuring, classic Doctor Watson, Sherlock nearly laughed.
“Thats not quite true, we don’t seem to be able to be in the same room any more. I’m happy for you John truly I am, your family must come first and I understand that,” Sherlock suddenly raised his hand dismissing his words idly, trying to lighten his tone, “ignore me John, I’m rambling, feeling sorry for myself how terribly pedestrian.”
“Oh shush,” John swatted his hand with fake annoyance but his ears went crimson and Sherlock could tell he enjoyed the compliment.
“All right,” Lestrade said with a weary sigh, “get dressed and get to the station, seriously I need it by lunch time.”
John's heart lurched, Sherlock shouldn't have to tell him he was struggling, that he was battling the demons that nearly killed him so many years a go. John should just know, after everything they’ve been through together, he suddenly detested himself as he battled for the words.
“A few hours won't make much of a difference,” half naked, sex rumpled, John had reappeared and calmly plonked himself down next to Lestrade, sipping a coffee like he'd lived there forever.
So many times John came close to plucking up the courage and leaving Mary and committing to Sherlock but every time something stopped him. Sometimes it was the late night talks with his wife about moving to the countryside, having a dog and a few more kids to run around after, sometimes it was Sherlock's coldness usually coupled with his dangerous obsession with the work and disregard for life that left John half way between despair and rage. Sometimes John thought Sherlock would never settle down, would hate the mundane life a stable relationship would bring, that he’d realise John Watson was ordinary and he was extraordinary, perhaps Sherlock didn’t mean to but sometimes he made that abundantly clear. The work was Sherlock’s life, John was his friend of course, an enjoyable shag but he’d never actually settle down and commit, sacrifice his ridiculous, exhilarating, death-defying exciting life for ordinary John Watson. Yet sometimes it was John’s own cowardice, Captain John Watson the reliable, sturdy, family man, he had a good job, a wife who he loved, a baby on the way and a future that he so yearned for. Mary was nice, she was safe, she was beautiful… but Mary wasn't Sherlock, which is exactly why John fought every natural instinct and had been keeping his distance from the beautiful genius. It wasn't fair on either of his lovers but John didn't know what else to do, he had to be there for his wife and child, had to step up, Sherlock himself would never have forgiven him if he'd abandoned the pregnant Mrs Watson. Whilst a twisted chivalrous act, it meant that Holmes and Watson could barely be in the same room, neither would be able to keep their reluctant pact after spending time together with so much love, and not to mention raw animalistic attraction between them… The detective jerked a little, crashing John out of his thoughts, Sherlock writhed slightly as the comedown tore through his body. John wanted to hold him, to heal him until Sherlock was his beautiful madman again, kiss him until he was senseless, never let him go. But John didn't, he couldn’t, so he simply sighed, rubbed his betraying eyes and silently placed the sickly sweet tea next to the broken man.
“Hey,” John said gently as he made his way into the lounge of Baker Street, smiling a little at the familiar warmth, “Mrs Hudson let me in, I wasn't sure if you were resting.”
“I can manage that, I think I’m going to like it here. 221b, Holmes and Watson, has a nice ring to it doesn't it.”
“Dear God you are beautiful,” John purred into Sherlock’s ear in between nipping the sensitive skin of his neck and kissing every inch of the milky skin he could reach.
“That I would very much like to get to know you better and if that room is going I would like to rent it, though hopefully I can spend more time in your room?”
“Are you trying to get me drunk, Dr. Watson?”
With a long, wheezing gasp Sherlock awoke with an unpleasant start, practically flinging himself out of the bed, a disorientated, sweating wreck. Sherlock Holmes was a man of steel with the brains of a philosopher and the brutality of a hungry lion who didn't flinch at the bloodiest of battle, yet here he was shaking like a leaf because of a bad dream. It wasn't the first time he’d had a bad dream in his thirty odd years on this miserable planet but this one was pretty high on the list of shit ones. When he was a child he used to dream of pirates, usually they were fun he would be the captain of the ship commanding what mysterious islands they would travel to. Occasionally he wouldn't be the captain and would be thrown overboard to a watery grave, Mummy always said he had got over excited but she would still tuck him back in bed with a soft smile making sure his teddy was in reach. Mummy always made the bad dreams better, except for the ones with Red Beard in. Ironically he dreamt his beloved dog was actually still alive and would cry so hard, shaking with heaving, gasping sobs when he realised his fluffy companion was never going to be in his arms again even Mummy couldn't calm him back to sleep. With a weary sigh Sherlock got out of bed with shaking legs, he was a grown man but right now he would do anything for his mother to ruffle his hair, bring him some milk and hug him. Of course that was ridiculous because his mother was getting old and was probably on a cruise and grown men don't hug their mothers after a bad dream. Although he supposed grown men did need comfort sometimes, he had hugged John many times when he had a bad dream, he was a wounded army veteran of course he slept badly and Sherlock didn't mind looking after him, John was a hero after all, he was his best friend and he wanted to help. Sherlock quite liked it really, he’d never been good at comforting people, never really knew what to say but with John, hugging him after a nightmare, making some sickly sweet tea and playing Beethoven on the violin at 3 in the morning seemed to soothe John’s troubled mind.
“Be careful my love, you're still healing.”
“I'm fine, John don't fuss, it's irksome.”
John sighed and closed the book he wasn't really reading and put it on the perfectly organised shelf in the perfectly organised flat he shared with his wife. John was happy, of course he as happy, he had a steady job, a wonderful wife and a nice flat close to work and at a decent price. John was normal, John was happy. He had to be happy because for the last 2 year his best friend, the reason he hadn't put a bullet in his head when he was discharged from the only thing in his life he'd ever been good at, the beautiful mad man with sharp cheekbones and an even sharper tongue had been gone. He'd died at John's feet and he had grieved and cried and even wished it had been him splayed at the bottom of the hospital instead of the closest thing to a soulmate he’d ever had. Sherlock was back but unfortunately that didn't change 2 years of grief and 2 years of trying to have an ounce of happiness back in his life. “John?” “Coming darling,” John was happy, of course he was happy, maybe life was a little calmer, a little less exciting, a little bit less Sherlock, but he was happy. John was happy...John had to be.
“So it’s true, what she said?”
Sherlock flushed, “yes I was.”
Deducing was how Sherlock made his living and he took great pride in working out what would please John, at first it wasn't especially challenging, adrenaline was usually surging through their veins, their passion was hard and fast, John usually enjoyed being in control but occasionally, especially after a difficult case, John wanted to be taken, to be held and devoured by the lunatic. All Sherlock wanted to do was please John, make John happy, give him no reason to stop so he tried to read the doctor at all times to ensure he was happy. John didn't have much to loose, he had a wife (Sherlock still felt ill at the term) at home, a good job, an active social life, Sherlock was simply an added bonus, a little bit of sexual espionage, an easy release, and Sherlock wasn't kidding himself otherwise. The detective wasn't under any illusion that John was going to get down on one knee and declare his undying love for him after saying, ‘sorry Mary, I've been banging my male best friend for the last 6 months so looks like we will have to call it quits, sorry love.' John wanted stability, a wife, probably some children, attending PTA meetings and watching a bunch of kids dressed as lobsters in the nativity play. John was ready to commit himself, Sherlock wasn't, Sherlock doubted he ever would be. He craved the adrenaline that the Work gave him, needed the danger, the rush, he was an addict after all, sure he didn't use at the moment but he would be a fool to claim he'd never fall off the wagon again, he'd certainly done it before.
“Steady,” John said instinctively putting his hand out to help which Sherlock pointedly ignored. They sat there in uncomfortable silence for a moment until John, perhaps against his better judgement, somewhat nervously perched on the arm of the chair, Sherlock refusing to look at him.
“Donovan enough!” Lestrade shouted his own face flashing at the blatant disregard his subordinate had for his instructions, “leave right now or I will write you up on gross insubordination!”
“S’nice,” Sherlock muttered, clinging a little tighter, “I never want you to let me go.”
“Hold me, kiss me, love me for tonight, just for tonight, one last time.”
“I, yes,” Sherlock squeaked, catching himself, “but we don't have to, we can do whatever you want, I just want to be with you.”
“I like men,” Sherlock purred, looked the doctor up and down and licked his lips, “men who know what they want, men who have seen the world, men who are brave, noble and will stare down the barrel of a gun and look danger right in the face.”
Why John was telling Sherlock this in his best calming doctor voice he really had no idea, the consulting detective certainly knew the basics of human biology, especially when it was
“Oh god!” Suddenly John stopped in his tracks, his face noticeably greying, their passionate embrace suddenly halting. Putting a hand on his shoulder Sherlock said softly, “Its ok John, you need to go, it's ok.”
“Are you staring at me,” a sleep muffled voice murmured bringing Sherlock out of his thoughts.
“What do you mean?”
Donovan only smirked, “just trying to look out for our new friend, pleasure to meet you Dr Watson, see you round, freak.”
“You going to let her talk to him like that?” John snapped at Lestrade gesturing crudely at Donovan.
Sherlock caught himself as he said the cringe worthy comment and felt his cheeks grow hot, what an embarrassing thing to say, he sounded like a bloody lovesick school girl!
“I've seen many a surgical scar, Sherlock.”
“Mostly, sometimes meth. Naturally I lost my job, I hated it anyway partly the reason I was so restless. Money ran out, I didn't tell my family, Mycroft, my brother, has never really forgiven himself, or me for not realising what a mess I was. He wasn't to blame of course, I am a master of disguise after all. Anyway I knew who sold the good stuff, but I couldn't pay. I was desperate and it was well known the dealer would take other forms of payment,” Sherlock trailed off but quickly cleared his throat and continued, “one night there was a police sting, if I hadn't have been so high, so pathetically desperate I could have spotted it a mile off! Lestrade and his infamous sidekick found me. Thankfully there were no drugs on me, nothing to charge me with but it was clear why I was there.”
Of course John helped him too, Sherlock wasn't prone to nightmares when they lived together but John helped him in other ways, so many other ways that Sherlock lost count, he hadn't even noticed them until he was now alone in Baker Street. When he was on the run in Croatia from an armed gang he didn't really have time to miss John greeting him in the morning with a steaming cup of tea, patting his hair affectionately, his gorgeous eyes still lighting up even after all this time when Sherlock made an impressive deduction. When Sherlock was being beaten to a bloody pulp in that Serbian hell hole his mind couldn't wander to whether or not John would crack open a bottle of Merlot with their dinner which usually resulted in a night of good-natured hilarity and an only slightly regrettable hangover the next day. But now Sherlock wasn't running for his life trying to take down one of the worlds largest criminal networks, he was at Baker Street, he was home. Yet it wasn't home, there were none of those milky chai latte things in the cupboard, no out of tune humming coming from the shower and no one to listen to his ramblings, to soothe his racing mind until he crashed in a soft lap with gentle fingers running through his curls only to awake with a blanket to his chin and a steaming cup of tea by his feet. He missed John, he missed John more than he thought possible, sometimes he wondered if John missed him. Of course John didn't miss him, what a ridiculous notion. John lived with Mary, John was married to Mary, he didn't want to go with him on their silly adventures any more, he was married, he had a normal job, he and Mary would probably pop out a few kids and live a normal life in the suburbs. Of course John didn't want Sherlock anymore, he probably never spared him a thought, why would he. Not that Sherlock blamed him, he'd made John watch his best friend fall to his death and have his entire life unravel at the seams, overwhelmed with grief he'd even got that bloody cane out again. Sherlock had broken John all over again and he didn’t deserve that, the doctor was too kind, too beautiful, too good for that, too good for Sherlock. No wonder John didn't want to be anywhere near him. Sherlock laughed mercilessly and lit a cigarette in shaking hands knowing full well John Watson wasn't giving him a second thought.
“Why are you talking like I'm running out the door?”
“I'm sorry John, I'm so sorry I hurt you, I didn't know what else to do. I'm sorry John,” Sherlock’s voice was a cracked whisper as he ran his hand through John’s hair, his heart shattering as the doctor at last crumbled in his arms because of Sherlock's own, cruel actions. “It's ok John, I'm so sorry, it's ok, I'm here," Sherlock had never comforted a crying man in his life but the instincts Sherlock didn't know existed kicked in as he whispered hollow word of comfort to soothe John, trying to ease the terrible pain he had put him through. Before he even fathomed his actions Sherlock planted a soft kiss on John’s head who had stopped crying but remained wrapped in the tall mans arms, sniffing a little. Sherlock planted another kiss on John’s forehead, allowing his lips to linger for just a moment on the soft skin. John manoeuvred his hands to Sherlock’s waist and looked up, his eyes still wet, the cut on his head was healing but Sherlock wanted to kiss the thin red line away until the was simply no more pain. They remained in the intimate embrace, John sniffling softly as Sherlock held him close, he kissed John's cheek but as his lips descended John shifted in Sherlock’s arms and the soft lips landed on the corner of John's mouth.
“Thinking so loudly, you're blaming yourself for my overdose. Don’t, it's not you, it's my issues, my demons.”
“Hey it's ok,” John said gently, “you're right we were having a wonderful time and you don't exactly share that type of thing with someone you’ve just met, it's ok.”
“I'm fine.”
“Oh John, please,” Sherlock moaned, realising he sounded incredibly desperate but failing to care. Despite the gracelessness, Sherlock's movement hindering injury and John's game of sexual twister in order not to hurt Sherlock of have his own busted shoulder give out, they managed to entwine limbs as they rutted like two horny teenagers. Clothes were soon shed, moans became louder as their passion intensified as the lovers became one.
“Yes, you don't have to stay,” Sherlock slumped into the chair, utterly defeated.
“I'm an addict John, I've fallen off the wagon before and got back on it eventually, it is what it is.” Sherlock’s voice was calm, his attitude nonchalant as he practically shrugged, making it clear everyone else was overreacting, although in reality it was a badly acted facade to try and calm John down. Evidently Sherlock was losing patience with this topic, with being fussed over, having to explain his troubled state of mind and reveal his intimate thoughts and ongoing struggle, allowing himself to be vulnerable was not an option.
“Indeed it does, John, indeed it does,” no more words were spoken as John wrapped his arms tightly around the detective and kissed him like his life depended on it.
“Can I undress you?” Sherlock half panted half gasped, placing a trembling hand on John’s belt buckle, a nod followed by a breathy moan was all the encouragement Sherlock needed as he pulled his companions trousers and shorts down in one, allowing the bobbing erection to spring free. Before John could even get his breath, the madman had his cock halfway down his throat, tantalisingly sucking, licking and dear god, kissing him in all the right places.
“Shut up,” John's voice was playful, “you're the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen, you're smart and interesting, you're sexy too which is a bonus!”
Sherlock chuckled, “it is, I’ve always been a fan of Merlot.”
The next morning John woke before Sherlock, which was unusual, usually Sherlock had declared sleeping dull after a few hours of it and was working on some crackpot experiment involving disgusting things like decaying heads and caterpillars, but this morning he slept. John could tell he was ill but still marvelled, despite the gaunt face, messy hair and the unhealthy sheen on his face, Sherlock was so beautiful. When he slept he looked like a young man with the world at his feet not the old soul that had seen toon much pain for a lifetime. Gently John pushed Sherlock's wild curls out his face and crept out of bed, mooching to the bathroom then to the kitchen. As John waited for the kettle to boil he couldn't help but feel conflicted and if he was being honest with himself, he also felt rotten. He and Mary had some friends coming over for lunch, he promised Mary he'd be back nice and prompt so he can help do the shopping and prepare whatever fancy dish Mary was going to make. As much as he genuinely enjoyed spending time with Mary, he did marry her after all, his natural instinct as a doctor, and incidentally Sherlock's lover, was to look after the madman on his sick bed. It wasn't exactly a life threatening illness, he'd be back on his feet tomorrow but John felt like a grade A knob leaving Sherlock whilst he was sick. As much as John didn't want to admit it, he wanted to spend the day with Sherlock, not Mary, even if that did mean he would spend the day making soup and listening to the whiny madman rather than having a boozy lunch. Sometimes when he was sitting with Mary on the settee watching mindless telly, he actually missed Sherlock's ridiculous critiques, when he awoke to Mary's beautiful curves in his arms he often wished it was Sherlock's hard edges and bony frame. With Sherlock the sex was amazing, the passion was addictive and their time together was fun but John was craving something more with the detective and it frightened him immensely. With a buzz the kettle jarred John out of his thoughts, he made the tea then would shower, after all he had to meet Mary soon. Sherlock sipped the tea gratefully as he nestled further into the bed clothes feeling utterly sorry for himself.
“That wouldn't have been the worst thing, I was going to my death anyway.”
“Years a go I had a drug problem, the whys aren't really important, you haven't known me long but I dare say you know me well enough to know my mind does not function like the average person. Back then my life was meaningless and mundane, my mind was rotting. I was young and stupid and didn't know what to do about it, I didn't know how to feel, how to not blow my brains out through the unbearable tedium. At university I'd experimented with drugs, nothing particularly serious and it was easy enough to go back to smoking weed when I graduated, but as you know Doctor Watson soon weed doesn't do the job and I needed something stronger to get me through the day.”
“Mary’s having the baby.” It sounded more of a question than a statement.
“Having sex with a gorgeous man who is the most exquisite thing I’ve ever laid eyes on, yeah I think I can mange that.”
Coughing a little as the smoke travelled through his body Sherlock tried to steady his hand that held the light, still shaking noticeably. His mind was spinning, the nicotine wasn’t helping, thoughts of John, his new life, the life he would never have with Sherlock were racing through his head. It was suddenly a reality, any shred of hope, the fantasy that one day John would walk away from Mary and be with Sherlock were crumbling. On the plus side John had asked Sherlock to be the godparent, well for normal people this would be a plus side Sherlock thought bitterly, almost laughing out loud as this own sardonic thoughts. Godparent! The thought made Sherlock sick, watching over the very thing that will tie John and Mary together forever, the thought was laughable. ‘How do you know Daddy, Uncle Sherlock,’ Baby Watson might ask one day, ‘well actually I used to sleep with your Daddy under your Mummy's nose, we were going to run away together then she got pregnant with you and it all went somewhat to shit!’ Suddenly Sherlock couldn't stand his own thoughts anymore and threw the cigarette to the floor stamping on it, ignoring the slight pain as the heat touched his bare foot, the burn was actually a welcome distraction.
Sherlock sighed and continued, his voice flat, “I wasn't trying to kill myself John but that wouldn't have been the worst outcome, my last conversation with you, your laugh the last sound I heard, reading your blog as I slipped off. It wasn't my intention to die on the plane but it would have been a pleasanter way to go that having my head blown off in the middle of God only knows where on some meaningless suicide mission.”
“Are you coming to bed, John?”
“Sherlock, we’re not strangers you and I will never be strangers, you’re the most important person in my life.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock murmured
Just as Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, his post-orgasm brain taking a tad longer than usual to craft a soul destroying verbal assault, Sally Donovan in all her smug glory strutted in. With all the subtlety of a sledge hammer she looked the detective up and down and said with pure relish, “busy night then, freak?”
“Sherlock,” the whispered name tumbled out of the doctor’s mouth, all he could do was hold the detective’s hand, still shaking in his grasp.
“I know.” John’s voice was practically a whisper, they remained entwined, staring at each other slightly breathless.
“Yes, god yes!” Sherlock was practically panting in arousal, sweat was dripping down his back but nerves suddenly overcame him.
“It’s ok, love, I've got you, take it easy,” gently John moved his hands down to the flat stomach, releasing the pressure from Sherlocks injury, supporting his weight as the detective composed himself as the pain subsided.
“Oh John, don't stop, please don't stop!” The detective moaned, a glorious husk from deep in his throat, he threw his head back dramatically, allowing himself to enjoy the doctor’s glorious teasing. Gently, a strong hand roamed across Sherlock’s chest, the closed buttons on the purple shirt decreasing by the second, John pinched a rosy nipple, swirling his tongue around the pert bud as Sherlock squeaked in bliss. Desperate for more contact with the sexy doctor who was bringing him closer to orgasm by the second, Sherlock pulled John into him, running his hands through the soft blonde hair non too gently. On a passion-fuelled deduction Sherlock thrust his tongue in John’s ear between kissing his neck and uncoordinatedly pulling at whatever piece of clothing he cold get his hands on.
“Put this on,” John said gently, in his hands was his oatmeal knitted jumper he bought in the M and S sale 6 years ago that had always been a few sizes too large but wonderfully comfortable. John had clothes at Baker Street, why wouldn't he for the nights when he's on one of his adventures having a laugh with his best friend, well that was the line they told Mary and anyone else who asked. Of course it would look ridiculous on the tall man with his endless legs, tiny waist and deceptively broad chest but he took it with a grumble, muttering that the colour clashed with John's hair anyway.
?” John said at last.
“Sorry, darling. Don’t know why I always forget.” He winked, and Sherlock looked only slightly less exasperated, fiddled with the tag hanging from the stuffed dog’s neck. “What’s this one’s name, then?” John asked
Daddy smacks him again, three hard spanks all in the same place, and Locky cries out at the shock of pain, and his willy comes out from between Daddy’s lips for a second. Daddy licks him with a swirling tongue, moaning and humming as if Locky is just the yummiest thing, and now that Locky’s found his tongue and lips again, he fucks down fast into Daddy’s mouth because he feels so hot, so hot, and he wants it all to come out, right into his daddy’s hot mouth, right all over his face and chin, all sticking in his scratchy whiskers. . .
“I don’t want to say those things, like he said to me. I don’t want to bring that into what we share when you’re my boy and I’m your daddy. I feel like it makes me a sick pervert.”
It was a few days before John was ready to even look at it in the light.
Sherlock nodded. “It’s all right,” he said, and there was a certain softness in his face, his dreamy gaze, that let John know Sherlock would need time to come back to himself. “I can make tea,” Sherlock offered.
Sherlock giggled. “
“Well thanks for that,” Daddy says, and laughs a little. “I do my best.” Daddy’s hand moves up and down Locky’s calf a bit, just petting him; Locky loves to be petted and his eyes close for a second even though he isn’t tired. “What are you thinking of, sweetheart?” Daddy asks him, and his hand slides down Locky’s thigh from his knee to his hip, then up again. Locky wriggles a little to unbend his legs and make room. Daddy’s touches are so nice, and he touches everywhere.
,” John said forlornly. His heart was breaking. He was so ashamed. So ashamed.
“You sweetheart,” John murmured, still abrading the nipple as he pressed his teeth against the soft skin at the side of Sherlock’s neck, then backed off and began to suck in time with the movement of his thumb. After a few beats, Sherlock’s pelvis began to rock in time with it, just slightly, and John could hear that Sherlock’s mouth had come open—his breath was loud as he shifted the candy wetly around with his tongue, clacking it against his teeth now and then.
“I’m fine. I promise I’m fine.” Sherlock half-smiled, and leaned in to kiss John’s forehead there between his eyebrows. “You will be, too. We’ll stay here until you’re ready, then a shower and bed?” Sherlock suggested, eyebrows rising.
“Goggie the doggy?” John sought confirmation, and Sherlock nodded, then held Goggie up beside his face and nuzzled his cheek and nose against it, turning to inhale.
Sherlock drew back, found John’s chin and tipped his face up so their gazes met.
“You’re excited.”
“Ah.”
John smiled; his boy was so clever and so funny. He was cute as anything. He was precious.
“We can use the spare room.”
Sherlock’s voice was low and sleepy. “That was nice, Daddy.”
, my darling. You’re a good boy. You’re perfect.”
“I don’t like this,” Sherlock said again.
“I want my thumb.”
“Big, but not heavy,” Sherlock observed.
“Oww. . .” Locky whines against the pillow.
, Sherlock. You can’t leave me the only one remembering I said or did things to you that were expressly designed to harm a soul.”
like him. It’s infuriating.”
oh god,
“Yes, sweetheart,” John laughed, and opened his arms. “Can I have a hug before that?”
“Daddy.” Sherlock sounded equally amused and exasperated.
John was quick and efficient in rising to stand, getting a solid grip on Sherlock’s jaw, and guiding the head of his prick into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s facial muscles flexed beneath his fingers and thumb, trying to close his mouth or pull away, but John held him, thrusting the crown of his cock in and back, not too far. Sherlock gagged nonetheless.
He pulls in the deepest breath he can manage, and he feels Daddy do the same, and all their muscles squeeze tight while they hold it for a few seconds, and then Locky thinks,
. . .”
with them then, just innocent stuff like hugging and being close, because what did I even
As it had been in his real childhood experience, cognitive dissonance was inherent to it even within the boundaries they’d set for the scene: bodies experienced pleasant sensation even as minds and hearts rejected the wrongness of the thing. John had felt angry and turned on, in some way loving though horribly cruel, powerful in the moment yet terrified of being found out. It was complicated and mind-bending, and he was relieved to have played it out inside such well-defined parameters. Sherlock had been understanding and reassuring, utterly without judgment, and willing to make it work. Sherlock had orgasmed; he’d held John while he came back to himself; he’d murmured reassurances and taken care of John in the wake of his breakdown. But while they were down in it, Sherlock had cried.
very pretty,” John assured, and placed another kiss—this time with parted lips—at the very crest of Sherlock’s hip, moved a bit, kissed again. “Every bit of you is just perfect.” Another kiss, with a swipe of John’s tongue tip. “Spare a pillow for your old daddy?” John asked, and Sherlock passed him one, which John arranged under his neck. “I want to take my time making you feel good, and being so sweet to you, my pretty boy.”
“All right then. Whatever you want,” John reminded him. “And if I ask you about something, you can answer honestly yes or no, and I won’t mind. It’s all up to you.”
,” Sherlock grunted noncommittally into the pillow.
“I agree.”
“Good boy,” John huffed, and even as he slid his cock around inside Sherlock’s running mouth, he closed the root in the circle of his fingers to keep himself from coming. “That’s a good boy,” he crooned, voice much softer. “I knew you were a good boy. Go on and suck, or lick it like a lolly, do as you like.” Sherlock gave a couple of weak sucks, his cheeks hollowing a bit, then opened wide to swirl his tongue around John’s crown, then sucked again, a bit harder and longer. “That’s lovely. Lovely good boy, sucking a big man’s prick. Very good.” John slid his hand through Sherlock’s hair, clutched the back of his head and pulled him forward a bit. “Relax. . .” he groaned. “Relax. . .open your throat, lovely boy. You can do it. Be brave, now.” He shoved in much deeper, and Sherlock’s eyes went wide and spilled fat tears, but he tolerated it.
Ned, Daddy.”
“Sherlock.” he could barely form words for the sobbing.
?” John brought down the flat, wooden back of his hairbrush against Sherlock’s already well-reddened bottom: first one cheek—
“No, of course not,” Sherlock said. “That’s common with abused children. The brain will do whatever it can to preserve sanity in an insane situation. That’s perfectly normal. Your reactions were normal.”
Sherlock was still looking at him expectantly, fingers swirling slowly through the pile of cellophane-wrapped sweets, not only because he wanted another, but because he liked the noise the crinkling wrappers made as he shifted them gently against each other.
—no, I know you’re not.” Sherlock cradled him close, his arms so tight around John’s back, one long leg trapping John’s legs, sheltering him. “This is just residue. We’re safe.”
“I really am so sorry,” John said again. “I love you, Sherlock; you’re perfect. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock’s eyes were wide and darting and he made a show of stretching, shifting in the bed, moving away from John’s touch against his shirt front.
“What would you like?” John asks, and already he is rampant, his cock thick and unyielding where it brushes Sherlock’s low belly. Sherlock needs, just today, right now, what he needs is. . .
inside Daddy’s mouth, so hot and tight.
It had been an awful week. John couldn’t remember when he’d last seen the sun; the weather was wet and raw and sharp. The case they’d worked on was hideous: the disciplinary head of an elite boarding school had turned up dead in spectacular fashion, sawn in eight pieces with his own hacked-off prick jammed in his mouth, and in the course of the investigation it came clear he’d been raping a parade of dozens, if not hundreds, of schoolboys for nearly thirty years. John had been simmering on a low boil of barely-suppressed rage for days, and every one of Sherlock’s social
feel like a sick pervert.” John’s gut was tightening again.
“No one would ever know but you and me. Look where you are.” Sherlock’s thumb stroked John’s wrist.
“Oh, just perfect,” John assured him, and stroked his thigh, let his hand rest there above Sherlock’s knee. “Can we tug down your jim-jams so I can make you feel good, sweet boy? Only if you want to.”
“I don’t want to,” Sherlock whispered, looking nervously down at John’s hand as he slowly pulled his prick, slick with his spit and sticky with Sherlock’s cum.
Daddy’s fingers slip away and it makes Locky feel  empty and he wants to be filled all the way up, so he wriggles and slides his knees on the bed until he’s where he wants to be, and Daddy  holds his prick so it stands up for him, and he holds Locky’s thigh tight and steady. He pushes up and Locky sinks down, and oh, but it’s so much more than even his three fingers were, all knotted up inside Locky’s bum and pushing in and out. Locky makes a deep, loud moan and braces himself on his daddy’s chest with both hands.
“I’ll clean you up a bit—very warm and gentle, I promise—and we’ll have a little nap together? There’s still the whole evening ahead with nothing to do, but we probably shouldn’t sleep it away.”
Sherlock looked stricken, eyes wide and glistening.
“You can’t even sit,” John said, scolding himself. “It was too much.”
Locky nods, and his eyes are already closing. He feels Daddy moving to get up from the bed, and then the wardrobe door clicks open and in another moment there is soft, sweet-smelling fur beneath Locky’s chin; Daddy has fetched out Goggie the doggie for him to snuggle. Locky buries his nose deep into the soft fluff and he feels all filled up with his daddy’s love, and that is all he ever needs.
“Eyes on me, sweetheart,” John crooned, and stroked one hand up Sherlock’s forearm. “Something wrong?”
Sherlock nodded his understanding. “Uh-huh,” he said around his thumb, then went back to sucking on it. Not just the tip of his thumb, John noticed, but the whole thing, which he only did when he was very aroused, or feeling in great need of comfort. Since clearly the former was not the case at the moment, John could only assume something was upsetting him.
Locky will have to ask about this later though, because now Daddy puts another of his fingers inside, and twists, and presses onto that spot inside that makes Locky’s whole body light up and sing, and he shivers again, this time very hard, and he can’t help but gasp, “Daddy!” and Daddy makes a growly sound that means he is very pleased, and very excited, and Locky wants what he wants and he wants it right away, so he says it, right out loud, not shy.
“Pet me, please,” Sherlock said seriously, as if he were losing patience.
“If you want to,” John added. “I just thought. . .since we’ve got a few quiet hours to ourselves. . .plenty of time before dinner.”
“Keep talking, you’re doing well.”
Sherlock scrubbed his face with his long-fingered hands. “I was thinking the same about you.”
“I’m gonna come on you now, fuck boy,” John growled against Sherlock’s neck, breath hot against his flexing jaw. “I don’t want to be sick, now, do I?” He rocked forward hard, then back. “I don’t want to be sick,” he muttered, and his orgasm shook him, but he kept thrusting through it, “I don’t want to be sick.” His cum jetted hot over his fingers, painting Sherlock’s hole, “I don’t. . .” he choked. “I don’t want to be
John cleared muck from his throat, then wondered, “I bet a big boy like you knows lots of words by now. More grown-up words for your private parts. Maybe even some sort of dirty ones.” John’s fingers brushed Sherlock’s cheek, and down his neck, and Sherlock ducked his chin. “Ah. Ticklish?”
