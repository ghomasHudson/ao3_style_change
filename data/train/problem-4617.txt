“I’ve wanted you, Cas,” Dean breathed onto Castiel’s neck, in between lips and teeth and tongue.
“Well, hers were also shaved,” Cas replied, unsure as to whether he did something good or something bad.
“Thanks for the warning, Meg,” he called back over his shoulder. He fitted the lens into place, ready to take whatever photos the catalog company required of him. He hated these corporate gigs, but unlike his beloved nature photography, these things actually paid the bills.
“If you say so,” Dean still teased, but when Emma yawned again, he scooped her up and headed back to her bedroom.
“It’s just cuz I’m a girl, though, right?” Dean babbled, trying and failing miserably to reason this all out.
"But they're your favorites, I shouldn't have been so harsh," Cas admitted as well, snuggling into Dean. "And I never should've said that Harrison Ford wasn't attractive."
“What is it?” Jack asked, looking just as amazed by this little turkey bone as he had been by the enormous meal, and everything else about the holiday.
He dumped the rest of the mail on the table by the door, not able to focus on boring bills and junk mail until the mystery of the puzzling package was solved. He ripped through the tape and yanked open the box like a kid at Christmas, and was confused when a few scraps of dirty looking cloth fell out, along with a folded sheet of paper. Now he was really intrigued.
Cas smiled sadly, looking for all the world like he was expecting nothing less than absolute rejection. “No, Dean,” he said softly. “Like… like a lover would.”
“Cas, what the hell is this?” Dean asked incredulously, his voice coming from somewhere in the depths of the unwrapped pile of engagement party presents. Their friends and families had almost been too generous, but neither of them were complaining. Until this, at least.
“Your soul, I think,” Castiel said, sliding off of Dean even though every part of him objected to the loss of contact. “I think your soul fell in love when I did.” Dean slipped out of the chair and grabbed him by the face before kissing him, a deep, long, probing kiss like before, only slower.
Castiel chuckled. Apparently Sam had been even more accurate than he’d thought.
“Our revenge,” Dean said with glee.
Dean froze again, for a completely different reason this time. “Uhh…” Was the best he could think to say.
Not noticing the state of the teenager in front of him, Dean continued just as enthusiastically, "So, how'd you end up liking that record you bought last week? Isn't Zep the greatest on vinyl?"
Dean’s breathing was ragged, his skin flushed to a deep crimson. “Do you… do you want to know more?”
"Dean, I'm…" Cas begged. "Dean…"
When he opened the door, his confusion went up by at least twenty points, because instead of one of their friends, or even their tenuous allies there was a guy in a pizza delivery boy uniform. His short hair was covered up by the baseball cap, and for some reason he was wearing shorts even though it was kind of cold outside, really short shorts actually, but the pizza box in his hand was a dead giveaway. None of the pizza places in town were wiling to deliver this far out, not that the bunker was on any GPS anyway, so this random pizza guy was seriously out of place.
“I’m gonna kiss Cas now,” Dean warned his brother. “So I suggest you go hide for a few hours if you don’t want to watch. And maybe stay hidden for a few weeks, or until I’m willing to forgive you for that stupid spell.”
“Maybe Crowley’s just being a drama king,” Castiel muttered under his breath, but he followed Dean anyway.
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asked, turning around quickly to try and assess any potential damage. The look of fear and concern on the angel’s face, it was enough to light that final fuse on all of Dean’s anger.
“It’ll be alright,” Cas said, squeezing Dean’s shoulder reassuringly. “There has to be something in all of the Men of Letters’ books that could shed some light on how to end this spell or whatever it is.”
Dean let out a tortured sigh and stared Castiel in the face. “Dude, it means you can eat all the candy you want, and actually
Castiel pulled away from Dean’s lips to look at his face. His eyes, so green they almost hurt to look at. His cheeks flushed from exertion, the freckles standing out when they were usually more subdued. The bruised lips, with his panting breath coming unevenly. “Perfect,” Castiel murmured as he took in the lines, the planes, every single bit that he could see, and remembered the things he couldn’t while they were both in human bodies. “Absolutely perfect.”
Castiel paused for a moment, confused as to what that had to do with them, until he remembered some of the videos he had seen. Dean was suggesting anal sex, and for some reason that made no biological sense, the thought only made him harder. “Yes,” he said again, only this time he willingly pulled apart from the hunter. He stood awkwardly, naked in the middle of an auto parts junkyard, until Dean waved him over to the door to the backseat that he’d just opened.
After the sofa was made into a makeshift bed, it was Castiel’s turn to pull Dean in for a surprise kiss. It was quick and chaste, but damn was it still just as good. “Good night, Dean,” he said softly.
"Well," Dean said with a smirk, "we have a lot of time to make up for."
“But you are, damn it!” Dean shouted, grabbing Castiel’s hands in his like it was a lifeline. “You never fucking see that, but you’re super important, Cas.” He squeezed Castiel’s hands in his. “You’re important to me, Cas.”
“Right-o, boss man.” She punctured her words with a loose salute of some sort. “I’ll bring the new stud in in just a moment.” He’d lecture her about her choice of words, but she was already gone. At least she’d been professional-
Dean smiled and kissed the angel on his cheek. “Good,” he said, then he paused. “Wait, did you shave your legs for this?”
Castiel immediately blushed as red as humanly possible, and was surprised when Dean did the same. "Uhh…" Castiel said, not sure what was appropriate at times such as these, when you weren't starring in a romantic comedy.
They just got back, and it worked just like you said.
The knitter cocked his head to the side in confusion, and asked, “I’m sorry, what?”
“Emma, get back here or so help me,” the man standing next to him shouted suddenly, startling Castiel. A blonde girl who looked to be in kindergarten grinned guiltily, then skipped back over to him. But Castiel was too busy staring at the man to give the girl much mind. He had brown hair that almost looked blond in the sun, and the most amazing green eyes Castiel had ever seen. He looked like he easily could’ve gone into modeling. The freckles scattered over his face managed to make him seem down to earth, though.
“It was never a secret, Dean,” Cas said in a soothing tone. “But now that it’s even less of a secret, would you like to go out on a date with me?” Cas asked, looking eager, but a little bit like he’s ready for rejection, just in case.
Dean gawked for a few moments at what Cas had just said. “Intimidating?” Dean asked, while the rest of his brain was catching up.
It took far longer than he was proud to admit before Dean realized what he’d just blurted out to Sam. Shit. No choice but to answer, now. “Uhh, yes?”
"Oh really, Dean?" Cas snapped back at him. "Like what? And don't say that gun fight with the swordsman." He was so angry at this point that he was half way to growling. If he still had his wings, they'd definitely be raised in a threatening position, the feathers ruffled to make them look even more dangerous.
"You deserve a medal for surviving that or something, seriously," Dean joked. "Or maybe an apartment halfway across the country."
“Even your hobbies are geeky,” Dean teased his little brother. “Those things always have clues that you need a freaking history degree or something to figure out,” he complained, but he sat down next to Sam anyway.
“Cas, why the hell are you wearing a skirt?” Dean called out, staring down at his boyfriend in shock.
“But only if you wear your panties,” Castiel thought to add, since that was by far the sexiest piece of clothing Dean could ever wear.
“You too, Dean,” Castiel said automatically. The omega watched the man walk away, pushing the stroller with ease. The back view was just as good as the front, and any other time Castiel’s would’ve been ashamed for having thoughts like that, but there was just something about Dean.
“Since you got the coffee earlier, I bought you an apple turnover from the baked goods booth at the end of our row,” Cas explained, holding out what looked, and smelled, like Heaven. “Not the most healthy of lunches, but definitely the easiest to eat while working at a booth.” He smiled again, bigger this time, and Dean wanted to eat him more than the turnover.
“I can’t see what you’re holding, Dean,” Castiel replied, finally starting to get the hang of sarcasm after having dated Dean for over three years.
"Hell yeah," Dean responded immediately. "Send me a text and I'm all yours."
Cas glanced over nervously at Dean, who was so obviously distraught over the whole matter that you could almost see the waves of uncertainty and worry coming off him. He knew that right now, there was nothing to be done to fix all this, but he hoped that a little bit of compassion might help. He gave Sam a quick glance as he stood up, almost asking if he thought it’d be a good idea. At the very slight nod from the younger Winchester, he walked over to the older Winchester for consoling, or at least an attempt at it.
“Here we go, Claire-bear,” Castiel said, trying to hide his exhaustion from his daughter. “Ice cream, just like you were asking for.”
"Oh my god!" This shout from Jo they did pay attention to, and they both looked over at her, halfway through cleaning up Castiel's mess. "Just freaking kiss or something already!" She dropped the Naruto plushie she'd been holding and stomped over to the register area. "You have both been stupid in love with each other for forever, so just ask him out." She huffed, still quite loud. "Dean, you're now on your lunch break, so get the hell out of here and take your boyfriend with you." She printed out the piece of paper that made it official, then she started making shooing motions at them.
Not save, not save, abort mission! Dean’s brain went full blue screen of death for a few moments, trying to process what Cas had just said. Not. A. Save. At. All. “Uhh,” Dean said instead of words. How do you even answer something like that?
He picked up the gift, looking at it from different angles as if that would help him any in trying to figure out why it was here in the first place, and why it was for him. Castiel looked up from the box when he heard Dean’s footsteps enter the room.
“Flirting?” Dean stumbled over the word, not sure how to react. He wasn’t ready to tell everybody yet. He wasn’t ready to admit to Cas that he was in love with. He kept this shit secret for that exact reason: he wasn’t ready for any of it yet. “Not, no, definitely not flirting, cuz, umm, yeah, not flirting, you don’t flirt with your friends or anything like that, cuz you’re my friend and all, so nope, not a flirt, umm, definitely not,” Dean helplessly babbled, unable to stop at this point.
"We're already together, Cas, you don't need to lay it on so thick anymore," Dean reminded him, retreating from the angel's neck to give him a playful kiss.
Finding a pair of boots that fit his new girl sized feet wasn't too humiliating, and neither was grabbing a somewhat random pile of jeans from the women's clothing section. He was beet red by the time he got to the self checkout, though. There wasn't enough beer and pie in the world to make him face a real person behind a register, but even looking at the stuff as he scanned each item felt like torture. He did the bras and undies as quickly as possible, and all but ran out the door when he was done and paid up.
Castiel raised an eyebrow, now even more confused. He was an angel; he had been
“Later,” Castiel said, before shoving his mouth into Dean’s. The hunter opened up immediately; the taste, something he’d never really thought about before, was better than anything he could’ve imagined. While they kissed, Dean’s hands started pulling at Castiel’s shirt while his own were sneaking their way down the hunter’s pants, falling even more in love with this particular pair of panties as he felt how soft they were, though the hard muscle beneath them was much better.
“‘Open up’?” Castiel asked, not remembering anything like that from his videos.
"Later," Castiel growled, grabbing Dean by the head and pulling him down on top of him. They were both laughing by the time Castiel started covering his face and neck with kisses.
“And to what do I owe this pleasure?” Cas teased, playful yet very much interested.
“You were bored, weren’t you?” Dean asked, while Castiel watched from the sidelines, occasionally rolling his eyes. The nerve of this demon…
Castiel blushed, without understanding why, as he admitted, “With you, it’s different.”
Dean laughed, embarrassed but hopefully not looking it. “My, uhh, my booth. Over there.” Dean pointed, tripping over his own words because dayum this guy was sexy. “I was hoping you could maybe watch it for me? I gotta pee like nobody’s business, and…” Dean quickly stopped when he realized he was oversharing. He was usually smooth with the guys and ladies, but there was something about this one, something that made Dean feel like a teenager in both a bad and a good kind of way. “So yeah, could you watch it for me for a few minutes?”
“It’s the wishbone of a turkey,” Sam explained, then looked guiltily at Mrs. Butters, not sure if he’d accidentally interrupted her. When she just nodded, he continued. “Two people pull it apart, and whoever gets the bigger piece when it breaks gets a wish granted.”
“Dean!” Sam shouted when the bunker door opened and he saw his male brother was back to being male again. “What happened? How’d you break it?”
“It looks… nice,” Sam said, trying to sound like he wasn’t lying his ass off.
“No way,” Dean said at the same time Sam said, “Of course not.” The two glared at Cas, their hunters’ pride insulted.
“Dad’s not here to disapprove,” Sam reminded him.
“It’s a good thing Jack was never dumb enough to try to copy his older sister. Though when we caught him in the driveway making out with his first boyfriend, you’d’ve thought he was the one having the heart attack.” Dean laughed at the image forever seared into his brain. Twelve year old Jack, pulling away from the boy down the street, deer in headlights look on his face.
“I have a white pair with a bunch of little pink bows,” Dean teased, but it only made Castiel want to see them even more.
Meg just chuckled. “He
Castiel had followed the brothers to their motel room after the hunt itself was over, as he usually did. Only this time, he just so happened to be looking at Dean at precisely the right moment as he took off his father’s old leather jacket. His shirts slid up with the jacket, and during the two or three seconds before he reached back to pull them down again, Castiel spotted what could only be pink lace. He may not be very well versed in human behaviors, but he at least knew that men’s clothing almost never had lace, not for hundreds of years now.
“I am definitely not a kid anymore,” Dean said instead of explaining. Castiel scrunched his face up in confusion, which caused Dean to chuckle, but that led right back to him clutching his stomach and unhappily moaning.
The angel ran his fingers along the length of Dean’s shaft, loving every tiny little unintelligible sound that came out of Dean’s mouth as he did it. Then he reached up and grabbed Dean’s chin, pulling him in for another kiss. When the two erections met, though, Cas pulled away just enough to let out a strangled moan. Dean pushed forward, rubbing against Castiel and making him swear in Enochian.
But thankfully, Dean just gave him a caring and sympathetic smile. “Sounds tough,” he told Castiel, putting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing it lightly in comfort. Then Dean started to dig through a diaper bag hanging from the baby’s stroller and pulled out a pen and paper. “Actually, you seem like you’re probably not a serial killer, so if you need anything, just gimme a call.” He paused for a few moments to scribble down his phone number. “We’ve been here for almost a year now, and I can definitely understand where you’re coming from.” He handed the piece of paper to a stunned Castiel.
At the same time, Dean could feel the tensing up that could only mean one thing. Smiling on the inside, since his mouth was currently too busy to spare the lip movement, Dean went for the grand finale, speeding up even more, adding in random pressures to destroy Cas' brain cells as he let the angel facefuck him. Seconds before Cas started to come, he screamed Dean's name, then lost all coherence as he shouted his orgasm, his voice tinged with just the slightest hint of angelic power. As Dean swallowed and swallowed, greedy for everything that Cas could give him, the noises Cas was making made him feel as much as Cas if not more.
The dark haired hottie chuckled, which only made Dean crush on him even harder. “Of course I can,” he replied, then held out his hand. “I’m Castiel, but you can call me Cas,” he said as they shook.
“What, Dean?” Castiel asked, completely awake now. “Reading what wrong?”
“You would eventually get over it,” Castiel replied stiffly. He knew that Dean still mourned his lost loved ones, like Ellen and Jo, but he didn’t let it interfere with protecting the world and his current loved ones.
“Thank you so much,” Castiel replied. He looked down at his daughter to make sure she remembered her manners as well, but she was so focused on her chocolate cone, which was already almost half finished, that a bomb could’ve gone off and she’d have kept eating. “From both of us,” Castiel added, knowing that there was no use expecting much of anything from Claire now, not until she was licking the last drops of melted ice cream off her fingers.
Cas started running his hands through Dean’s hair, tugging a few strands every so often just to taste Dean’s moan of pleasure in his mouth. Their bodies copied their mouths, and the two were separated by the only piece of clothing currently in play: Cas’ boxer shorts, his usual makeshift pajamas unless it was cold out. Dean groaned in frustration as he was denied skin to skin contact because of that damn white cloth.
"What in the hell was all that?" She asked, looking as out of her element as she felt.
Castiel let out a groan of both pleasure and displeasure as he forced his tongue into Dean's mouth and shoved his fingers into Dean's hair. Dean was giving as good as he got, though, his own tongue reenacting their earlier battle of wills, his teeth rending another tear into Cas' already battered and bleeding chapped bottom lip. He grabbed hold of the angel's unbelievably toned ass, shoving their bodies together in a harsh way that promised to ache as soon as they bothered to pay attention to it.
“Sounds great, kiddo,” Dean said with a wave. Jack scrambled out of there as quickly as he politely could, having obviously learned the tactic from Sam. Ever since Castiel and Dean had started officially dating a few months ago, the younger Winchester had become an expert escape artist in order to avoid Dean’s lack of shame when it came to public displays of affection.
“Yeah, thanks Cas,” Dean replied through the embarrassment blushing. He put his hand on Cas’ to give him a bit of reassurance back, then Cas put his other hand on top of his, and it felt really happy squishy good. So good that Dean panicked and grabbed his hand away like a werewolf was about to bite it, or some other equally dire positioning. No chick flick moments, damn it, even if he was, very temporarily, a chick himself.
“I don’t need a babysitter, damn it,” Dean growled at his brother. He’d been a chick, at least physically, for only a few hours, but he was already hating how everybody was treating him like a soft, delicate little flower, or something equally as breakable. He’d been hunting monsters for decades, so even in a different body, that should count for something, right? “I’m not weak,” he grumbled so that only Cas could hear him.
“Then maybe you should take a turn, Mr. Super Angel Stamina,” Dean replied snarkily, getting seriously grumpy by now. But then Cas reached for the shovel, and Dean got to climb out of the barely there hole. “Have at it,” he said, grinning, as he passed the heavy labor to somebody else.
When the two girls were tucked back in, Claire still happily nibbling on the blue shark ring, Castiel followed Dean back into the living room. “I can make up the couch for you,” Dean said nervously. “Cuz you know I didn’t invite you guys to stay so we could knock boots, right?”
He was still pretty sure that nobody had really noticed, especially not Cas. As much as he l… fuck it, as much as he loved the guy, he was pretty oblivious to a lot of human stuff. Sam might have an idea, maybe, but he was probably just teasing him about the eye contact thing to be the annoying little brother than he is. He didn’t notice much of anybody giving him suspicious looks, either, strangers and friends alike, so at least he wasn’t being too obvious about it all. Yet.
Dean chuckled, making his eyes, and the rest of his face, look even better. "Sounds like we were both pretty stupid."
Once they were outside, shoving the remaining stuff in the back of Sam’s van, Dean looked at his brother with a death glare. “Don’t you say a word,” he said, pointing at Eileen waiting in the passenger seat.
Cas visibly calmed himself down before continuing. “I want to protect you, Dean, but you would never let me normally. You’re so sure of yourself, that you don’t think you need it,” he explained.
Yours in Effervescence,
He turned back to his mother. “Okay, so where do you want me to start?”
He had noticed Castiel. This was it. Cas was done for. Because Dean’s face was suddenly alight with excitement. And he was hugging Castiel, phone forgotten, and he smelled the same and he didn’t hate Cas and it was all too much to handle with Mary standing right there watching.
Last night, I awoke after dark from a fevered dream to find the Estate utterly silent. The illness with which I have been battling for a little over a week had peaked early in the morning, and I had found myself unable to do much more than sleep as it ran its course. Waking to find my aches subsiding was quite a positive sign. But it was nothing to the joy I felt only moments later. I rolled toward the window and there, spotlit by a moonbeam on my bedside table, was a vase overflowing with delicate purple flowers.

Dean closed his eyes, then, as if pained. “No. That was a fully unintentional loss of contact.”
“Honestly? No.” Cas could make a joke of it, brush it off. But, well, he had never been great at lying to Dean. Starting now felt foolish, whatever else was to come. “We don’t exactly talk all the time like we used to, Dean. I’m not sure I would have expected you to tell me. Until, maybe, this weekend. There just wouldn’t have been an opportunity for it to come up.”
The song would down as they continued to make out on the balcony, but after a while a new sound began to float up from an open window in the house below. Snoring. Very loud snoring.
Dear Archangel,
in tenth grade, and I wanted so badly for the voice of this author to be out in the world. And, for once, I could maybe help with that, you know? I had all this money that I don’t know what to fucking do with, and I knew where you went to school, and with Grandma’s name I could actually make sure some money got to someone who really deserved it. I didn’t know who you were or if you even needed a scholarship, but for the first time this estate felt like a gift rather than a curse, and I knew what I had to do with it. I—” He broke off for a minute, staring down at his hands. “I didn’t realize how hard your letters would make it to stay away. I’m a weak guy. In the end I
As the opening chords of “Back in the USSR” blared through his ageing speakers, Cas tried to relax. It would be fine. Yes, he would be dateless at a wedding watching Dean and Lisa dance together in a blissful little bubble of joy. But he wouldn’t really be alone, would he? Their family, unconventional though it already was, had sprawled out over the years. Ellen had eventually married Bobby Singer, so he and his buddy Rufus made an amusing, ornery little fixture in the corner of any family event. Cas’s high school best friend, Charlie Bradbury, had always been welcome with the Winchesters, but when her mother’s failing health pulled her back to Lawrence after college, she had started dating Jo, and the rest was history. She was an honorary Harvelle, at this point.
But I need you to know that this simple little 2x3 card holds within itself so much meaning, despite its ease and brevity. Archangel, it tells me that you read my letters. Not only that, but given your quick response, it tells me you must read them as soon as they arrive. Perhaps that seems like a small truth to you. But in a succinct little world like my own, to have my silliest thoughts met at the mailbox with anticipation, as though they might matter? It means more than you can know.
It brings Dean an unexpected joy, to witness this scene. His little brother has found this unbelievable girl, brave and strong and altogether awesome, and now he gets to have her. Better yet, he can have her without giving the rest of his family up. She knows the life - she’s lived it herself. If they decide to keep hunting, now on their own terms, they don’t have to hide anything from her. And if they decide to hang it up and try something new, she’ll be part of that decision, too. What a world.
Once 9:30 came and went, Ellie and her husband Trevor stood to take Addie back to the hotel. Finally free to play for them all, Dean, the true musician of the group, wound them all through a variety of favorites, acoustic covers of classic rock being his specialty. Eventually, the jam session devolved back into conversation, and Dean just played on quietly, letting his skilled instrumentals underscore the cheery banter.
“Oh, do they ever,” Dean replies, sounding extremely excited. “You haven’t had a bacon cheeseburger ‘til you’ve had one of Ellen’s.”
I drove out with Meg and Bela last Saturday through a rather unpleasant storm (you know—the sort where it goes grey as night in mid-day and somehow snows sideways…), and we settled into the massive cabin-oid rental structure immediately. It was already stocked with food and whatnot, as Bela’s parents had only left the day before, so we hunkered down for about 36 hours of movies, munchies, and Moscato. We didn’t get much work done, but…well…everyone needs a break now and again, right?
Cas’s car was mocking him, he was sure of it.
Well. Now that I’ve said all that, for which I hope you can forgive me if my choice offends you, I suppose I should move on to the rest of the news points. This will likely serve as my monthly letter, after all, given my current workload.
“Honey, there are eleven other people in this house this morning. Plus, Rick, Trevor, and Kevin offered to drive over at noon to lend a hand as well. We can handle this.”
“No?”
And in that moment, it didn’t occur to Dean to ask his son to bring the missing member of the family back. He was too stunned that Jack wasn’t coming home to contemplate who else wouldn’t be there.
Ms. Celeste Middleton, personal secretary to Mr. Michael Smith
“Just ask Charlie,” Cas replied. He was in it now, might as well let the honesty flow. “The first two years of our friendship was mostly her making fun of me for being in love with a straight boy. And then you came out as bi, so the next few years were her just repeatedly calling me an idiot.”
Whoever said kidnapping could never be fun must never have been to Petoskey.
Cas leaned back to look Dean in the face. “Are you sure?”
“Well, that sounds awesome, Cas,” Dean said. “Tell your friend with the couch that I’m definitely interested.”
April 26, 2018
The benefactor who administers this scholarship has set several rules for you, should you choose to accept your place at The Garden. These requirements are outlined below.
I learned several things about Meg Masters during this ever-so-strenuous ordeal. (And by “ordeal”, of course, I mean “fun and restful vacation”.)
Archangel! Stop the presses! I have just received news!
Choosing to let this strange fact pass for the moment, Castiel bowed to his curiosity. “And the others? What do they mean?”
Still snug in his chair, Dean calls, “Don’t forget to lock the doors.” He gets a thumbs up in return.
“Let’s not test that theory on Sam’s big wedding weekend, shall we?” was the reply.
Against all odds, he managed. As the various other lake house residents packed up their cars for departure, not one of them gave him any kind of confused or reproachful look along with their goodbyes, so he must have been more subtle than he felt. Or, perhaps they were all just too used to him checking Dean out. That was a disquieting thought. But Cas was sure he’d hear all about it when the news began to spread of their relationship, and while it would be a bit embarrassing, at least it would no longer seem pathetic.
“It all turned out pretty great, didn’t it?” Dean was asking, gaze turned mistily toward where his brother was dancing with Ellie Moore.
“No,” Cas said, turning to look Dean dead in the eye. “Jealous of what she had.”
Then the shadow of another body moves up next to his own.
In the wake of their departure, Mary turned back to Cas, bringing her hand to his cheek in that motherly way he only ever accepted from Mary and Ellen. “It’s so good to have the whole family back in this house again,” she said quietly. “It has been far too long since we’ve managed that.”
Castiel
Well, wasn’t this intriguing? “There was nothing to ‘interrupt’, Dean. Not in the way you imply. Balthazar and I are friends.”
Finally, Dean seemed to relax out of ‘convince at all costs’ mode. “Yep. And Mom’ll probably kill me. But I’ll take a couple ass-kickings over Sam’s sad puppy eyes any day.”
“…Yeah?” Dean asked, startled to find Castiel suddenly so close.
, where the kid has to navigate a series of weird and wooly foster situations to escape to college? Perhaps it’s a bit more in the YA fantasy space, and our character needs to escape back to her friends at the group home because only they can save the world from some sort of evil creation? Or perhaps it’s a tender story of friends or siblings working to fit in, over and over, as they are sent from home to home, even an epistolary sort of “gritty
When they eventually released each other, Dean looked at least as wrecked as Cas felt, gazing right back and panting in the wake. “Okay then,” he said, clearing his throat with his patented smirk back in place. He squeezed Cas one more time, tilting their foreheads together, and said, “see you at home.”
Miraculously, no murders were committed on Saturday morning when Sam Winchester awoke at 6 AM covered from head to toe in shaving cream. His high-pitched screams woke all the occupants of the lake house, who quickly had their annoyance quelled by the sight of a cream covered Sam chasing Dean, Jo, and Cas into the woods, completely unaware that Charlie was catching the entire event on video. Sam’s return trip was equally entertaining, given that his luxurious hair was still streaked with white foam as he pouted his way up to the third-floor shower grumbling about firing his grooms-people and standing up with just Kevin. Mary just handed him a coffee and promised to make the pranksters scrub the shaving cream trail out of the lake house rugs in punishment. He headed up the stairs in much better spirits, and his three tormentors set to cleaning, quite pleased with the morning’s work.
It was starting to make his skin itch. Well, it was starting to make him think about things that he thought he had pushed down and away years ago, never to be considered again, and that was making his skin itch. But here he was, lost in a circular melody, spiraling into dangerous thoughts as he barreled down a boring Midwestern highway.
Dean has set up three chairs, all facing the side wall of the garage, where a projector is taking advantage of the large blank canvas it provides. Cas is motioned over toward one of the chairs, where he settles in as Dean starts the movie.
“Dean,” Cas began sternly. “You-”
“Well, I’m glad you seem to be doing well.”
Happy to continue the teasing, Cas squinted accusingly at him. “Is this some kind of kink thing about having me in your childhood bed?”
“There is no try,” Cas concluded, his head bowed in faux-serious Jedi reverence.
Apparently surprised, Dean muffled out, “Cas…”. But Castiel was not going to let this moment get away. He backed up just a hair’s breadth to raise his eyebrows at Dean. They stared, their gaze a physical thing there in the inch of space between them, as Dean checked for whatever he had been planning to ask about. Certainty, most likely. Well, Castiel had been wishing for this for nearly a year, and he was done with hiding the fact. There was no point now – he had no doubt admitted his love in writing several times over.
“Yeah, of course,” Dean replied quickly, looking back down at his open suitcase.
Sam re-emerged when the Dads fired up the grill, and several cars pulled up soon after with Jess’s portion of the wedding party. The house was soon filled with excited chatter as introductions were made all around.
Unimpressed with this sudden descent into melodrama, Cas whacked Dean on the arm. “You’re not homeless, Dean. You just said, you’re about to go home to see your parents. You know they’d let you stay if you wanted.”
“No,” both women replied, not even turning back.
With a shake of the head, Cas backed out to follow the Impala, turning his own stereo back on where the White Album had been paused, and setting off down the road toward Lawrence in a haze of soft joy.
Oh, Archangel, I wish you could advise me! I am sure the vast experience of your long life would yield the guidance I so desperately seek. But, in the absence of wise words, I will at least try to take solace in the bits of clarity I have formed while writing this letter. You do more than you know, simply by existing, Archangel.
But, as Jo also received an undeliverable package back later the same day, I can say without hesitation that the US Postal Service does not return a package by hand-writing “Return to Sender” on the box. There are stamps and stickers and bar codes involved. Not Sharpie messages and fancy messenger services.
And with that, Archangel, I’m afraid I must leave you. It’s nearly dinner time, and I imagine Ellen needs this booth for actual paying customers. But I hope that wherever in the world you might be this December, you are safe and happy and healthy. I thank you today and every day, not just for your generosity, but for the tender way you have treated me, even in anonymity. Your silence is more verbose than the words of many I’ve encountered, and your simple willingness to listen? Well, that’s an invaluable currency in my book. Having you to write to this holiday feels more like having family than anything on Angel Farm ever did, and I cannot describe the joy that brings, however silly I might sound as I try.
With a sigh, Dean said, “and I hate to say it, but we should probably get some sleep too.”
Dean winced. “February?”
Crowley, meanwhile, has declared this month a reckoning. He’s asked us all to bring in pieces we feel are finished, so that he can don his strictest editor hat and remind us that the work is never finished. Frankly, I expect it’s more to take us all down a notch so we don’t get complacent. But that can’t be a bad thing- the world is vast and wide and full of endless talent, and overconfidence seems to me a particularly dangerous temptress. In a sadistic way, I rather look forward to watching Crowley tear “The Society of Wayward Daughters” to editorial shreds. Should be a stimulating challenge.
“Then we’ll all move into the barn and keep going,” Mary assured him. “It’ll be fine, Sam.”
After taking a moment of quietly thanking his own, less pristine, vehicle for making it through the full drive, Cas got out to schlep his bags down toward the house. The cars were all lined up along the trees, far further than usual—presumably to make room for the other guests who would be coming and going throughout the weekend.

“So,” Dean begins, turning toward Cas in his chair and removing the necessity for his guest to make a decision. “It’s been a very long time. How’s life?”
“That’s really cool, Cas,” Dean replied. Cas couldn’t help but preen slightly—he was proud of his business. Then Dean took a breath, appearing to size Cas up, before asking, “Okay, I have to ask: have you photographed at a Big Ten Football game? Because if you have and no one in my family told me…”
That said, his utter panic wears off slightly after a few days, and he ventures tentatively back to the front window in the afternoon for a glance. (In a ballcap and sunglasses, but no one needs to know that, do they?).
Dean put on his most sincere expression. “And I say, with the deepest childlike devotion, please leave the cooking to me, Mother.”
March 12, 2018
I know, I know, I’m not to expect a response, so questions like this will merely evaporate into the void, unanswered. But I would like to propose a deal. I have devised a rather silly nickname by which I intend to address you hence. If you are opposed, you will simply have to write to tell me so. You need not put in great effort: it can be a blank card that says only “No.” Like a cheap telegram. For that matter, you could dispatch your secretary send it. I’m sure you are a Very Busy Man, after all. The choice is yours. If I do not hear otherwise, you shall hereby be addressed in future correspondence as “Archangel”.  (Get it? Michael? Don’t laugh: I warned you I was raised by Evangelicals. And we have already established that “odd” is my most persistent quality.)
A phone began to ring. It was nearby, apparently in Dean’s pocket, judging by the jerk of his hip at the sudden vibration. They broke apart with a chuckle, but Dean didn’t let go of Castiel as he pulled out the phone angrily to toss it aside. But then—
In her wake, Castiel realized he needed to snap out of his mental fog and attempt to behave like a human being. He cleared his throat. “Hello, Dean.”
for peace-time war stories shared to a judgeless ear.
Mistaking Cas’s silence for judgement, apparently, Dean scrambles to pull a standard blue and white face mask out of the breast pocket of his flannel. He puts it on with a sheepish shrug to his shoulders, then speaks again. “Cas Novak, right? You, uh, grew up around here, yeah?”
So far, this semester, we’re simply being asked to write. As often as possible. The general idea is to simply get ideas down and start to form them, bring whatever we have in to the various professors for guidance in their various areas of focus, and workshop together as a full group when we can. We read each other’s work, sometimes aloud, give ideas, point out angles, discuss potential directions and the commentaries they might cause. If nothing else, those discussions demonstrate the fascinating cross-section of backgrounds our collection of housemates offers. From the heiress to the suburbanites to the orphans, there are so many experiences to pool together, and I can already feel it opening up my mind to new avenues of potential.
It’s very embarrassing. But Castiel posits that it would be more embarrassing if he were to be spotted.
Castiel was, definitively, the moon in this scenario.
Cas could see the wheels turning in Mary’s head, and jumped in with a little logic of his own. “The unbelievable speed with which you two planned this lovely wedding in an admirably-brief four months didn’t leave a lot of time to break bad news without the disappointment spilling over into today. “
It clicked. “Sam got engaged?”
With a nod, Castiel decided to take another chance. He picked up the manilla envelope from where he had left it tucked in the arm chair next to him, and held it out to Dean. Conspiratorially, he declared, “This is for you, Archangel.”
“The fact that your whole life will change permanently this afternoon?” Cas prompted, wry smile in place to make his joking tone clear.
With a squint, he confirms Dean is driving the car, and he has just enough time to offer a wave in response before Dean is forced to speed back up to avoid impeding traffic. Castiel watches the car turn the corner before continuing down the block.
Rather amused by this particular turn of events, Castiel raised a teasing eyebrow. “How did I write about him, exactly?”
Dean rakes the whole lawn in the space of about 20 minutes. Castiel watches from across the street. And a couple of times, when Dean takes a second to roll out his shoulders, he looks off into the distance across the street. At which point Castiel’s wishful subconscious imagines that he’s looking at the house across the street, specifically. It’s a nice lie, anyway.
They had been friends once, long before that. Or, well, not friends in the “let’s hang out one on one and do an activity together as such” sort of way, but in the “we are middle schoolers so we hang out in a group and this group includes both you and me” sort of way. They had engaged in group conversations and played group games and coexisted at group birthday parties and all that suburban junior high sort of stuff. And then Castiel’s family had moved away.
January 22—
Of all the contingencies Cas had prepared for this weekend, the possibility that Dean would be here alone had never occurred to him. He blinked at Mary and did his best not to sound unduly flustered.
Where to start? Well, I left you with very little to go on regarding my final project when I wrote last month, so I suppose I should take pity on you in that regard. Here’s what happened: I, Castiel Novak, writer of strange and snarky short stories, seem to have find my way into entirely new territory.
But Cas wasn’t over this yet. “Don’t change the subject.”
to pray to you doesn’t mean we can’t. Or that we won’t. And I am. Now. Clearly. ‘Cause…”
Cas took a moment to center himself. Then he quietly replied, “People change, Dean. Grow up. Move away. It happens.”
“Yeah, no need to call John, we’ll sort it out.” Ellen replied, herding the two young ladies toward the door. “And please leave the biscuits be, would you? Dean’s got them under control, and Cas can help if he needs it.”
At the recommendation of my professors, I did submit some stories (including Gabriel’s) to a few publications earlier this month. I’ve got a while left in the program here, of course, but if nothing else perhaps I can get some early idea of how my writing might be received out in the world. And, if I’m supremely lucky, perhaps I could get something on the way to publication before I finish here. My hopes aren’t especially high, but I suppose one never knows.
“I think it’ll be more than a couple,” Cas interjected, wincing. “I mean, I gather you’re planning to lie to everyone’s faces all weekend to keep this a secret? Ellen’s not gonna take kindly to that. Nor are Charlie and Jo.”
“Of course not, dear.” Ellie grinned and rolled her eyes for Cas’s benefit.

“What?” Jo asked, bemused.
Cas’s heart felt like it was floating.
Oh, Archangel, I so hate that this is probably goodbye. In the last year, I have come to enjoy writing to you, the simple progress reports turning happily into a treasured activity. I can only hope that reading my letters has brought you even a fraction of the joy I experienced in writing them. I shall miss my guardian angel— not for the money, but for the simple fact of you somewhere out there in the world and, at least once each month, thinking of me. I hope you know what a gift you have given to me, Archangel, and that I shall never stop thinking of you.
Kid has a point, there. Fuck it. “Okay, if you’re sure. That sounds lovely.”
There was a painted portrait over the fireplace, a man and a woman seated on a bench in some sort of park, timeless in their frozen beauty, laughing together at some unknown pleasure. Framed photos lined the mantle below this painted pair, and fanned out around the room, on tables and set among the bookshelves, even across the top of the small upright piano in the corner. It was bright, with autumn sun streaming through the front windows to settle in the room like a mist. It welcomed him in, so Castiel let his curiosity calm him and turned his gaze to the photos on the mantle. They seemed to be in no particular order, judging by the clothing styles. The couple from the portrait appeared in several, at various ages, sometimes with a small boy in tow. There were other adults as well – friends, perhaps – and then the small boy grown up with a baby in his own arms.
Dusk slipped through evening in relaxed, musical bliss. The Moores were a delight, and seemed highly entertained by the others’ ‘family band’-style traditions. Laurie turned out to have a hell of a voice, complete with an impressively accurate Janis Joplin impression, and Jess’s stepdad, Rick, even took a turn on the guitar for a couple Beatles covers that had everyone singing through laughter.
but for the golden few
Dean seemed to take the blow of the words physically, leaning back and muttering “ouch” without an ounce of his usual humor.
Therefore, I feel it was supremely unfair of me to judge you this week by your absence at my commencement. There are countless circumstances that might have kept you away, all of them fair; even “disinterest” is your right, in this instance. You, Archangel, are not to blame for my isolation in the world. In fact, your gift has gone a long way toward making isolation a thing of my past, and for that I deeply thank you. While I am disappointed to never have met you, I don’t feel I can deny your right to remain un-met. And so, with that in mind, I intend to press on without malice for Sunday’s disappointments.
“What do you want to know?”
I believe I shared a bit about Dean with you in my last letter. (Oh, who are we kidding? I’m fairly certain I gushed about him for several pages in my last letter.) Well, I’m about to do it again, so brace yourself, Archangel.
seems to have calmed a little bit of his anxiety about the window. It’s something, at any rate.
“Anytime, dude,” she replied, breaking out of the group hug to adjust whatever Cas had done to her ponytail.
“I am so glad that name stuck,” Charlie rejoiced, thankfully at a more reasonable volume.
“Ouch!” he cried, affronted.
Well, shit. “Um. No.”
“Uh…” he finally looked up at Cas again, shaking himself a bit. “A while ago, actually.” At Cas’s blank look he added, “as in, February.”
It’s nearly 8:00 on a Thursday night when the doorbell rings. And thank goodness Gabe isn’t here trying to sleep, because he would be livid. Castiel can just imagine the shouts of “who rings doorbells these days?!” that would flow from his brother’s mouth as he stomped across the house to the front door.
“I’d count on a few head slaps from him, too.”
, 2018
Finally, (FINALLY!) Dean stepped back, though not nearly far enough in Cas’s opinion. He could still smell that woodsy Dean Winchester musk, and it was very distracting. “When did you get here?! And why the hell didn’t anyone tell me?” He punctuated this question by smacking Sam upside the head.
Dean blows out an eloquent breath. “Hell, no. I hit the road about eight years ago and didn’t stop moving til my Dad died last summer.”
First, I dispensed with my generic male protagonist entirely, and revisited something from my past. In this iteration, it would be my futuristic collective of lesbian ghost hunters encountering the Ghost Dragon. The same group from the short story that inspired your sponsorship of me in the first place! It was quite fun to revisit them, actually. Enough so that I’m considering doing so again in the future. I’m not sure this exact new story could stand up on its own, but perhaps it will morph into something bigger down the line. Kevin has suggested it would fit as a comic book series or graphic novel. I don’t know that I’m ready for that, but it’s an interesting suggestion, at any rate.
He can’t quite bring himself to elaborate. It’s one thing to say he hopes this kid doesn’t carry guilt over what he did to Mary all his life- he thinks that’s pretty normal, not wanting your kid to shoulder that kind of burden. It’s another to admit the selfish reasons; like he doesn’t want Jack to remember Dean at his worst. The resentment, the anger, how unfair he was, how callous. It shouldn’t have taken him this long, he shouldn’t have needed to have Jack shrunk down to his actual physical age and thrust into his arms to see what a goddamn jerk he was for taking out his feelings on the kid, but here he is. And now if he has to admit to Cas that he’d rather their boy forget everything than know what a piece of shit his old man is, he may just crumble from the shame.
Gasp. Whine. Whimper. Whispered, "Dean," drawn out. A hiss when Dean found just the right spot. Mangled syllables, some maybe intended as words, but all intended as impossible to describe sensations.
"No, it's… um… sorry…" Castiel finally managed, removing himself from Dean's accidental embrace and regretting every inch. He felt something tugging at his shirt as he moved, though, and reached down to untangle Dean's employee badge from his bag's strap. It had a couple of pins attached to it, but one in particular caught his attention: blue, purple, and pink. Without even thinking, Castiel blurted out, "Oh, you're bi."
"Really?" Castiel asked, wondering if he'd hit his head when he fell and this was all a concussion dream. Because no way did Dean…
“Better late than never,” he reminded Dean, and they smiled at each other like lovesick high school kids.
“It’s just a small little Pride celebration, in a tiny little town,” Sam explained. “I figured this way, you could start small with the ‘out and proud’ thing.” He gave Dean his long perfected puppy dog eyes routine, and was pretty sure it was working. His brother looked at least a little less freaked out about the idea now. Maybe.
Sam looked up from his phone as he heard the bunker door slam. "Dean?" He called, even though he already knew the answer. Not waiting for a reply, he asked "How'd the hunt go?"
“I go on one,
The fact that he actually had to bother reminding himself of this basic bodily function only served to make Castiel feel even more nervous. Yeah, the guy was hot. Hell, just calling him hot was a huge understatement. He looked like he should be modeling for Hot Topic, not working in their chain store in a tiny Kansas mall in the middle of BFE. And the fact that he was so nice only seemed to make things worse for Castiel's big, throbbing puppy love crush.
“Cute,” Dean deadpanned sarcastically. “But I think we’ll pass.” He walked closer to the throne and the assbutt sitting on it, giving Crowley a smile that made the angel feel proud of him. “Now what was this emergency, exactly, that you needed me so desperately for?”
All this time, Castiel was watching in a mixture of fascination and horror as his feet drifted in Dean’s general direction at a snail’s pace. “Did you miss any hidden hex bags when you checked in?” he asked the brothers, since it was the most obvious place to start.
(aka a much better ending to s9e3 I'm No Angel)
And okay, yeah, Dean had to readjust just about everything to accommodate his ‘new size’, which only frustrated him further, but if he couldn’t drive his Baby, well, that was just like giving up. Pushing the play button on the tape deck a fair bit harder than necessary, he cranked up the music enough to avoid any uncomfortable conversation for the rest of the drive. At a high enough volume, Metallica could even stop his brain from thinking. A little bit.
“Yeah, she definitely had her eye on me tonight, Cas,” Dean said grumpily, “as well as a hand. On my ass. Twice.”
“Pretty sure he’s learned his lesson now,” Dean joked as they rushed off, so he could undress his boyfriend as soon as possible.
“My tooths hurt,” Claire complained then, and Castiel’s fatherly instincts took over, immediately heading to Dean’s freezer where he now kept a couple teething rings permanently. He gave one to Claire, who started gnawing at it until the pained pull to her face faded.
Everybody in that apartment slept happily that night. Except for Ben, who woke up two hours later with an unhappily soggy diaper. But after that was changed and he was back in dreamland a few minutes later, everybody went back to sleeping happily.
Castiel chuckled at Dean's accidental accuracy. "I have the apartment already, and that's way better than any medal." He smiled again, fully aware that this was definitely the happiest he'd been in a while, especially considering he was at work.
“Why?” Dean asked, wearing that inscrutable expression again. It looked as if he wanted to ask something different, but also didn’t want to ask it. The angel had seen this expression before, especially on Dean, but he still didn’t understand it.
Dean pecked Castiel on the cheek. “Yeah, I know, I know. I just feel guilty sometimes, cuz I know how much you loved this place.”
Dean laughed. "You do move fast," he teased, which made Castiel roll his eyes at him. "Maybe a movie later? Dinner tomorrow? And something this weekend?"
“Yeah, good night,” Dean replied clumsily, only tripping once before reaching the light switch.
“Then why’d you shove me aside? You never pull that overprotective bullshit when I’m a guy,” Dean snapped back, the unconscious part of his brain putting these feelings away in order to never treat women like this, after he turned back into a guy. If he turned back. Oh god, he hoped he’d turn back.
“I mean, it’s bad enough that those Trials damn near killed Sam,” Dean continued, starting to anxiously pace the front room area of April’s apartment, “but then you go and
“And how they both looked so uncomfortable at your impromptu sex ed lesson!” Castiel laughed, almost as hard as he had when it really happened.
“Get a room!” Sam jeered, and for once Dean didn’t bitch him out for it. Instead, he grabbed Cas by the hand and dragged the angel towards his bunker bedroom.
"Of course, Dean," Cas teased, but did as he promised and slid a second finger in.
And those feelings he can’t hide from himself anymore? They’re getting bigger by the second. It’s gone way past the eye sex, as Sam loved to call it to tease him. Dean’s found himself finding any pathetic excuse to touch Cas, even if it’s just a shoulder clap or helping him fix something so that their fingers could brush against each others’. Bumping shoulders. Hugs whenever applicable. Just, anything to get close to him. That spicy scent of his, that if it were anybody else would be an expensive cologne to smell that good, but it was pretty much just Cas.
Castiel put his piece of candy down and reached for Dean’s stomach. “Here, let me help,” he said as he used his grace to ease up Dean’s discomfort.
Dean would just have to do a better job now.
Again, Castiel was taken off guard as Dean pulled him in for a surprise kiss. It didn’t make it as far as the one in the car did, but they were both still breathless when they parted. “I’m not that gentlemanly,” Dean whispered, which caused Castiel to grin like an idiot. “I’ll go get those blankets now.”
"Yeah, he is," Castiel agreed. He smiled happily at the thought of seeing him again in a few hours.
"Did you just say that Harrison Ford isn't hot as fuck?" Dean croaked, unable to believe the blasphemy that had just spewed forth from the supposedly angelic mouth in front of him.
“I’m sorry,” Cas said softly as they walked back to the library.
Dean slipped his arm under Cas' coat to hug him into his side as they walked to the doorway. Cas smiled and dropped a kiss on the top of Dean's head, amused by the slightly taller man crouching just enough to pull the position off. They switched to hand holding as they went back up the stairs, and were sharing adorable kisses by the time the door closed behind them.
The words were gentle and firm at the same time, a feeling of security wrapping around Dean like a soft blanket. After a few paces back and forth, he stopped and looked at the angel in front of him. Green eyes met blue and it felt as though something clicked in that moment. This was it.
“Of course I love you. I thought it might be obvious but I guess the only way to really let you know is to tell you. Can’t have you thinking I don’t love you even a second longer.” Dean made a face, clearly disgusted by the idea of any further delay. Castiel had confessed his and it was relieving to be able to join him in that. They were on a level playing field, their feelings were finally cracked open. “Felt like somethin’ was missing, ya know? From Heaven. Figured this is it, huh? I love you, Cas, and I don’t wanna spend another minute in Heaven without you here with me. Don’t care if everyone knows, I’ll tell them myself. Just.... don’t leave me?”
“Cas? What the hell are you doing here?”
Castiel laughed right back, pressing their lips together once more. When he spoke, it was through a soft chuckle and into the kiss, wanting Dean to know that he absolutely accepted this ridiculous bet, “You’re on, Dean.”
It was Castiel’s turn to kiss Dean’s forehead and lock eyes with him. “I won’t leave you. You have my word. I’ll stay here for as long as you’ll have me. I suppose Heaven is odd like that, having all eternity to get sick of me.”
“Dean, you need to stop putting pressure on yourself.  No one else even need know about this just yet, it’s just us. Worry less about how it sounds and concentrate on getting it off your... chest. If that is the correct figure of speech. I know the words aren’t quite literally on your chest, they’re more accurately in your throat or on your tongue. But still, you understand what I mean.”
“Don’t try to move too much, alright? So you remember me, what else do you remember?” Dean was trying not to press too much or be too insistent with his questions but it almost felt like an itch you had to scratch. If he didn’t ask then he’d get very little answers but if he asked too much then Castiel could suffer for it.
“Missed me? Took you long enough to drop in then.”
“I’m fine,” Dean reassured him, silently understanding what Castiel was doing when the eyes scanned over him.
“I missed you.” The words were simple but they resonated so greatly, hanging in the air like they were the most important words Dean could ever possibly hear.
“Don’t you mean what in the Heaven am I doing here?”
It was desperate at first, as though he couldn’t help himself. The whole ‘off your chest’ thing had been the tipping point, if Dean were being honest. It was the thing that had so totally tipped this discussion over the edge and made his desire for Castiel follow it. The kiss was firm but soon softened. Their lips had pressed together so viciously, as though it might be the last thing they ever do, but that danger was no longer there and it felt like that realisation set in.
Now Castiel could definitely tell he was joking. However, upon paying close attention, he could tell that something was going to follow up the familiar ‘assbutt’ insult. Dean was talking as though he had something to say that Castiel’s confession hadn’t allowed for the first time around. So he just remained quiet and chuckled along with Dean, hoping his silence would make the other man comfortable to open up a little. Even the tiniest bit would be progress.
“Guess there were a lot of things I could have said then and didn’t. I’m sorry, Cas. You deserved better than that, than what little I gave you before you died.” Dean grimaced, brows knitting together with guilt and pain at remembering it. But no, this wasn’t a time to dwell on the bad. He stood, feeling the need to move a little and get some of the nerves to stop giving him the tingling feeling in his fingertips and stomach. “You deserved better and I wanna make it up to you, say how I feel and just... get it out there in the open.”
“Yep, sure are.” Dean confirmed, now starting to smile and of course Castiel joined him in that. “Confessing you love me and all that shit and then you don’t even stick around for me to say much back. Just rude, ain’t it? Where’s your manners, assbutt?”
“I do.” Castiel confirmed, eyes searching Dean’s face and lingering on every freckle for a moment before scanning over him. He couldn’t see any obvious injuries or anything but, then again, he didn’t know how long he’d been gone for.
It was only when they pulled away and opened their eyes properly that Dean spoke up again. They still stayed close, Dean with an arm around Castiel and Castiel with his arms still draped over Dean’s shoulders.
“It was, indeed, my attempt at a joke, Dean. I hope you’re enjoying your time in Heaven so far?” His head tilted a little bit and Dean felt the irresistible urge to scowl just because of how adorable it was.
The confession had been something Dean had certainly lost sleep over when he was alive, recapping it over and over in his head as if something would click and it might start to finally make sense. He’d never been confronted about his feelings for Castiel until that moment, everything he knew about those feelings being thrown up in the air. It was some sort of crazy juggling act where he not only had to consider Castiel’s feelings but his own as well as everyone else’s expectations. What would Sam think? What would all of his family in Heaven think?
“Cas?”
“Guess we gotta talk about that,” Dean pressed his lips together tightly, trying to resist the urge to say a certain set of words that sat there heavily. They were taunting him, threatening to spill over if he dared to part his lips. So, after some negotiation with himself, he opened his mouth and what came out was a middle ground. “So you love me? Romantically? You’re in love with me?” It was an important line of questioning as far as he was concerned.
Castiel was almost too concerned with the sheets underneath his fingers to concentrate on the questions. They seemed like words that just brushed by his ears rather than actually registering as valid questions. Despite the mild protestation from Dean, he used his hands to slowly push himself up into a sitting position. The room spun dangerously and he shut his eyes tightly to try and keep himself grounded. It was only when he felt as though he wasn’t going to fall off of the Earth that he opened his eyes again. It was one of the bedrooms in the bunker. He recognised it to be Dean’s quite easily since he’d been in here before.
“I love you too, Dean.”
“You weren’t supposed to see me.”
Dean hesitated for a moment, feeling as though he were treading on eggshells and at risk of breaking something precious, but then lifted a hand. That hand curled around the one on his upper arm carefully. His eyes met Castiel’s and the tension was tangible between them, all the things that had once been unsaid almost being fully out there in the open. There was so much more to be said, so many more things they needed to say and do, but it was almost as if they didn’t matter in that moment. What mattered was this, them just being together and alive.
Then he remembered their last conversation. He remembered those words that he’d said to Dean and wondered if perhaps they hadn’t been taken so well. But Dean was here, sat on the edge of the bed and watching him as if he were fragile and would be launched back to hell at any moment. Surely those words couldn’t have been taken horrendously if Dean were sat here and not Sam. Castiel had no doubt in his mind that Dean would have tasked Sam with Castiel Watch if he were trying to avoid him altogether.
“Was that your way of telling me that I’m an idiot but you love me anyway?” Castiel spoke eventually, voice low and raspy and a lot quieter than he expected it to be. On the chance he had somehow read the situation wrong, he wanted to have some sort of out.
It felt as though something broke inside Castiel’s chest and he wondered if it were the tension of not knowing how Dean would react. When Castiel had confessed his love, it felt as though Dean was holding back from him and scared of any sort of admission in that moment. But here they were. They were alone and sat in close quarters and Dean Winchester had just confessed his love for him in return.
Then the day came that their dog was reunited with them, Miracle bounding across the backyard like she’d been there the entire time. She practically threw herself at Dean as the man crouched down, hands moving quickly to pat and stroke her and pay proper appreciation while she was here. He’d shouted for Sam and both of them were astounded that she’d appeared like this. It felt like it was going to be the cherry on the cake, the final piece of happiness for them both. But something still felt missing. Dean still felt like there was something missing despite not being able to put his finger on it.
Castiel snapped his fingers and Dean blinked, looking down and seeing that his clothes were clean. The same ones he was wearing before but just not covered in streaks of black grease. “Guess that solved that problem. So, come on, don’t avoid it. Why now?”
Dean looked at Castiel for a moment, half in awe and half amused by this total idiot that he was so hopelessly head over heels in love with. He marched across the garage and reached out a hand to grasp the blue tie the angel wore, tugging him close to shorten the gap between them. He let out a huff of breath and then pressed their lips together.
It was a comfort to see the battered boots that sat next to the desk, the stack of books that he’d remembered shoving into Dean’s arms for some sort of research, the plaid over shirt hung over a chair, a variety of knives littered across various surfaces.
“And what exactly do you want us to talk about? I believe I said everything that was on my conscience at the time. I did not have much choice in the timing, I’m afraid, but I said almost everything I needed to say.” Castiel wasn’t sure what Dean wanted to come out of this but, by the look on his face, he assumed it was Dean that needed to do the talking. He gave a silent and encouraging nod and reached out one hand. His other arm kept him propped up whilst he reached the other out, pressing his palm to Dean’s upper arm carefully. He half expected him to shrug it off or push him away or walk out of the room. He didn’t. Instead, Dean just opened his mouth and closed it several times, struggling to make the words he needed to say come out cohesively.
“I wasn’t sure you would be overly enthusiastic about me ‘dropping in’. This is your Heaven, Dean, this is your experience that you’ve truly earned. A time to rest and enjoy the afterlife.” Castiel gave a gentle shrug, almost hesitating before he began to speak again. “Additionally, there was the incident of our conversation. Like I said, we didn’t leave things in an ideal place.”
“Hey, Bobby,” Dean shouted from where he was under a car, fiddling with the different parts there to fix several problems it had. This was how he spent most of his days; fixing cars and spending time with his family and friends. “Can you pass me the torch? Bobby?” No response. He sighed and pushed himself out, the wheels beneath him squeaking a little. He pushed himself up and wiped some of the grease from his hands onto his blue jeans. What was that?
Castiel couldn’t keep the small smile off of his lips, the edges twitching up a little bit at a time. As the grogginess began to wear off, he was somehow filled with a sense of relief to be back here with Dean.
He turned as quick as he could, reaching back with his arm as he prepared to strike with the wrench, his shoulders tense and ready. Then he saw who it was that had appeared behind him.
“Hello, Dean.” He eventually managed despite the dryness of his entire mouth. As he tried to move, he watched as Dean’s brow furrowed. He was on comfortable sheets and the smell of the room, since he couldn’t see much more than Dean and the ceiling from this angle, seemed awfully familiar.
Castiel’s arms moved to carefully drape over Dean’s shoulders, one hand playing with the hair at the nape of his neck. It felt like it was freshly washed and dried, the short hair perfect for him to brush his fingertips across. His nails dragged lightly against his scalp, revelling at being this close. As it began to ease into a gentler exchange, Dean let go of the tie so he could loop one arm around Castiel and curl his fingers into the trench coat. It made him at least a little more sure that Castiel wasn’t going to just disappear again. Then his other arm rose from his side to cup Castiel’s jaw, thumb brushing over his cheekbone. Only when Depan felt truly starved for air did he break away, noses still brushing together and both their eyes shut. The longer they could stay in this moment and make the most of it, the better.
Dean moved over to the table nearby and pulled out a chair, slumping down into another one that was a few feet away. He leaned on the table and stared at Castiel expectantly, eventually gesturing at the other chair he’d just pulled out.
Castiel stood too, not wanting Deal to feel that the room was unbalanced in any way. He glanced to the car, smiling a little at the knowledge that even in Heaven Dean was fixing up cars. “I’m here to listen, Dean. Whatever you want to say and however you want to say it, I’m here for it. It’s just the two of us.”
“Listen, I got a wrench and I ain’t afraid to use it. So why don’t you just come out and show me who you are to my face?” Dean asked, eyes squinting a little as he tried to focus, slowly moving towards the open, rolled up door of the garage. He heard it then, a whooshing sound that made every hair on the back of his neck stand.
“Yeah, but why?” Dean asked, pulling over an old but solid looking dining chair to sit on, since this didn’t sound like a quick fix kind of conversation. “Like you said, I can take care of myself, so why do you wanna protect me so badly?”
on him? How the hell was that even fair?
Dean wished there was something he could actually do about it, but at least play flirting as a teasing technique was better than nothing. “I mean, look at that muscle definition,” Dean continued, doing exactly what he’d said, because damn the angel was hot when he was naked from the waist up. He was probably even better from… Dean banished the thought before it could make his jeans uncomfortable, though it was definitely a thought he planned on using later in the bunker, during his long, hot shower. “You must work out,” Dean added, knowing Cas’ reaction to that one would probably be hilarious.
Cas ground into Dean's hips even harder, causing their cocks to smash inwards, and Dean to let out a yelp of his own pleasurepain. "You're much sexier," the angel said soothingly, before repeating the move and smiling confidently at Dean's second yelp.
“Dean?” Cas asked, concern filling his voice, filling the room even. He started to step forward, but the hunter stopped him by holding his hand up.
Heaven is only really Heaven for Dean because Cas is there with him.
"I don't suggest it," Castiel said, trying not to think about growing out surrounded by so many siblings. "I have three other siblings of the non-straight variety, too, so Thanksgiving was insane every year, same with Christmas."
"Well, for starters, mine's not halfway down my back," Sam answered, not even bothering to look up from his research book.
“No problem,” Dean said with a chuckle. “Us solo-flying omegas have to stick together out here in the big bad world.” He grinned, making Castiel’s knees feel weak, before grabbing a napkin from the mound that was on the table in front of him and clearing off a line of drool that was about to drop from his son’s pretzel.
Dean barged his way into the bunker, still trying to cover up his fake uniform in shame. “We thought you weren’t gonna be here,” he mumbled, blushing like it was going out of style.
“This tastes incredible,” he muttered through a mouthful of food.
Castiel nodded. “We had to move into a smaller apartment, when my mate’s life insurance wasn’t enough to keep up with rent…” The omega said without thinking. There was something about Dean that made Castiel spill his tragic past like the other omega was his therapist. “Well, I mean…” He stammered, not sure how to save himself at this point.
But the green eyed guy just laughed. “Yeah, Emma’s one hell of a handful most days, and I keep telling this one,” he said, pointing at the baby in the stroller next to him, “that he's never allowed to get as big as his sister.”
“No, Cas, I wouldn’t,” Dean said softly.
“I really am sorry,” Dean said, walking up behind his husband.
“All this time I thought it was this huge secret, and now I know it wasn’t…”
Cas grinned, looking a little embarrassed at his faux pas. “I know,” he mumbled.
He chuckled as he beckoned the angel closer. “I don’t care about the price tag,” Dean said, pulling Cas down onto the bed when he was close enough. “This was always our favorite beer.” He said it as if that made everything completely obvious, which, actually, it did.
“Yep, takes after his daddy,” the guy said proudly, much to Castiel’s relief.
But before Castiel had a chance to try and calm her down, Dean stepped up and smiled at her. “Hey there, shortcake, what’s the fuss?” He asked in a silly voice. The tantrum was gone before it even started as Claire giggled.
“I mean, you’re an angel, you know? So, like, right from the get go, you were off limits somehow, even if I’d understood any of this stuff back then.” Dean wiped the bit of moisture from his eye with his sleeve, hopefully the last one, but probably not. This body was definitely putting his emotions out there for the whole world to see, and that was just another reason it annoyed him. But right now, maybe it was exactly what he needed. If they weren’t being bundled up inside, maybe he could understand them finally.
"I thought you liked big breasts," Sam pointed out, trying to suppress a laugh.
Castiel actually let out a little 'eep' at Dean's wording, causing the model to laugh. "Now I really can't wait, Cas." Dean opened the door, and actually blew him a kiss before leaving.
Dean used the excuse of Cas having to walk right behind him to get out of having to carry their stuff in, but once the time had come for research, no matter how close the angel was, Dean couldn’t beg out of it. And since Sam kept giving him knowing, or at least guessing really good, looks, the hunter couldn’t even show how comfortable he felt with Cas’ chair pulled up so close to his.
“Cas would’ve been jealous if she had, anyway,” Dean added, bumping his shoulder against his angelic boyfriend’s.
Dean let Cas drive on the way back to the bunker, saying it was because he was barefoot, but they both knew. He snuggled against the angel the entire ride home, too exhausted to say much, but too happy to need to say much.
“Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer something fancier?” Cas asked as he held up the two bottles of beer he’d grabbed from the kitchen. “We could have anything we want, like Jack explained,” he reminded the former hunter, tilting his head in that way that Dean would never get tired of.
“Sounds great,” Dean said, already stoked. It could be a freaking Nicholas Sparks movie and he’d still be happy, because he was sitting next to Cas on a date.
“For all we know, he might actually use it,” Dean pointed out. Cas went green in the face and pushed away what was left of his slice of pizza. “Sorry for the mental scars,” Dean quickly apologized.
"But Dean," Castiel whispered, motioning for him to come closer, like he had some great secret to tell. Dean looked worried at his suddenly serious expression, and padded over on bare feet to see what was wrong. He only worried more as he bent down to hear what his boyfriend had to say. When he was only a few inches away, Castiel bounced on the bed so that he could leave a loud, smacking kiss on Dean's cheek. "Good morning, Dean."
“You… you saw them?” Dean stuttered, back to blushing at full force now.
“Sorry,” Castiel replied awkwardly, not sure if there was anything else he could do, now that he was done healing Dean’s burn.
“So, you up for a little parade action?” Sam asked, making sure to not be too insistent. He really wanted to see the celebration, since he’d never been to one before, and he sometimes had questions that he didn’t trust the internet to answer.
"Shit, you okay?" Dean said, his hand already on Castiel's shoulder. "That looked kinda painful."
“Really?” Dean asked, his bravado slowly returning. “Is it the gauziness that you like? Or maybe the stitching?”
Cas stood his ground, though; thousands upon thousands of years as a trained warrior making it seem like a cakewalk, even though it definitely wasn't this time. "Yes, Dean, from what I saw," he bit out, his normally gravely voice taking on a tone that would make any sensible being run and hide.
“Fuck yes,” Dean exclaimed before his brain could think better of it. It wasn’t every day you got such a polite invitation to be sexually destroyed, possibly while being held against the wall. That had always been a secret fantasy of his, and now…
“Dean, I…” Castiel started to say, though he didn’t know how to finish, or even really start that sentence. But from the expectant, almost hopeful expression on Dean’s face, the angel knew he had to reply somehow. “I… yes, I mean… me too…” Before he could blink, Dean’s mouth was on his, and Castiel knew what to do in return now. He pulled Dean in closer and deepened their kiss.
“Wear those next time,” he decided out loud, and Dean nodded in agreement before they went back to lazily kissing. Their multiple messes could be cleaned up later. Right now, they needed post-coital cuddles more.
"Well, we just got in some new band tees, if you're thinking about your next one," Dean said, talking like they were friends instead of employee and customer. After this much time, maybe they were, at least a little. Even if they only ever saw each other under these same circumstances. "And just lemme know if you need anything." He paused to smile again, and Castiel had to hold in the happy little groan of pleasure at how much he loved those stupid teeth between those sexy lips. "And even though we're super busy, I'm sure I can squeeze away for a little bit if it's to help you out," he finished, giving that wink and taking at least three years off of Castiel's lifespan. Then he chuckled, and went back over to the blonde girl folding t-shirts, his coworker, and from what Castiel could figure, his best friend. Jo, said coworker/best friend, glanced over at Castiel before ducking down to whisper at Dean. Castiel sometimes wondered if they were dating as well, but those thoughts never ended well, so he forced himself to head over to the shirts instead.
Dean grabbed a cart and kept his head down in shame as he headed towards the underwear section. He grimaced as he grabbed a few different bras, hoping that his guess from the short yet traumatizing time he was naked earlier was right for at least one of these. He threw in a few packs of underwear in different sizes as well, before he headed to the shoes.
“Rain check on the rest of that kiss?” Dean asked before they pulled apart completely.
“Here, try this one first, it’s one of my favorites,” Dean said a few moments later, interrupting Castiel’s thought process by shoving a bright yellow miniaturized candy bar in his face. “It’s called a Butterfinger, and you’ll probably like it too, since it’s peanut butter-y goodness.” The hunter smiled goofily, and it warmed every part of Castiel, down to his toes.
"I am so sorry about all that, Dean" Castiel said as they both started walking towards the food court on Jo's orders. "I'm a total klutz and should've been watching where I was going, and…"
