They were in a cab home by six-thirty. The day was clear and a little warm with early spring, and Sherlock rolled down the window of the cab. The passing scenery got his attention while John reread the instructions given him by the doctors.
“Then kindly take a seat so that Dr Watson may be seated as well.” I motioned to Watson that hs should sit. His eyes darted from me to our royal guest and back again, unable to decide who was the ranking personage. The king carried on glaring.
There are things he should do. He should call Matt and see how he and Christopher are. He should have dinner with Harry. Pick out a gift for Murray’s baby. Maybe he could start looking for a job in a surgery or clinic. Meet new people. Go out more. Find a better flat, maybe even a flatmate.
“One of the boys did.” Holmes gives him a small, grim smile. “And I called Lestrade, who knows Mason, the DI. I hoped my connection with Lestrade might get me in with the local police, which it did. That was Mason I was talking with when you arrived.”
Sherlock smiles. “They will be. Her latest awful boyfriend has just broken up with her, and it just so happens that Lestrade’s wife has finally filed for divorce.”
“Hardly a disaster, Inspector. You may close your file on Milverton, since his little kingdom of blackmail has fallen. You interviewed Watson and me independently, and we agree on what happened. That ought to clear him of the murder charge. Pursuing us on the charge of breaking and entering is likely to create more problems than it solves.“
But that isn’t the way he solves things. He isn’t a talker, and rarely finds anyone who can make logical arguments. Conversation about such things is always emotion, sentiment, and hurt feelings, and there his no logic that can refute all of that. He hates those conversations, and he can tell that John does, too, but if John can’t even acknowledge publicly what they are, what is the point of being together? Without that, it’s just sex.
She sighed and cast another look at Watson. “I’m afraid that the case I bring you today is not so simple. The situation I find myself in is utterly inexplicable, Mr Holmes.” She brought her gaze back to me.
It’s all so homely, so comfortable, that tears fill Sherlock’s eyes. He blinks and looks away. There isn’t anything to say about last night. They’ll fall into a routine, and John will no doubt be put off by Sherlock’s experiments and the general messiness of the flat. Sherlock will try to do better, and will submit to being nagged because it’s
Watson’s smile is fond. Rising from his seat, he comes to Holmes and pulls him into his arms. “Lie with me.”
I kissed him, letting my tongue rove gently over and between the lips of that panting mouth. My hand caressed the front of the boy’s trousers, feeling the hardening prick. And I stalled, listening for the footsteps that I knew were coming. I slipped my hand into Philip’s trousers and wrapped my fingers around his cock.
I snorted. “They do little else. Why do I have to explain my living situation? Not all men wish to marry, brother. Not all men wish to produce children.”
I don’t move out. I said I would, told myself that it would be better, but every time I look down the hall toward his room, I think of that dream. I’m going through the motions of returning to life, but a part of me is still lying on the pavement, bleeding out.
“No, it’s not. And she can hardly live independently as a single woman on that amount. This Ruggles is security for her, income for him. You note that she doesn’t say,
Fortunately, most of Sherlock’s scenes did not include Brook. At least Molly had been smart enough to keep the scenes with the fake Jason to a minimum.
He nods at Watson, gives his outfit an appreciative look, and smiles. While he greets the other guests as if he’s known them forever, John tries to still his rapidly escalating pulse. Holmes can be a real dick, he reminds himself, and before the evening is over, he probably will make John feel like an idiot. That’s what he does, and to expect otherwise is idiotic. He quickly downs the rest of his Slow Screw and pours himself a piña colada from a pitcher.
“Thanks for the advice,” he tells Donovan as he walks away. “You’re using him too, you know. He does this because he wants to, not because he has to.”
The grey hairs gradually outnumber the dark ones. Her eyes, still lovely, have crinkles at the corners. She needs glasses to read. Walking is harder; she has surgery to replace both knees. He comes up to London and visits her that year.
From off stage he watched as the coffee shop scene unfolded. Mrs Hudson’s entrance received the biggest applause so far, and a few cheers. She managed to acknowledge the audience with a wink while not breaking character or losing her place in the dialogue. Having known her since he was a child, he had looked up to her as a model of acting excellence. She’d practically grown up on the stage, and it showed in the ease with which she assumed her role.
He has lived with dysfunctional people all his life and is used to moodiness; it’s the silence that gets to him. The Watsons were a noisy family, always yelling and crashing things. He was the quiet one, the one who retreated into his room when things were tense, the one who tried to mediate when they got worse. His parents are dead now, and he avoids Harry, who always has something to complain about, someone to blame for what’s wrong in her life.
“You describe him as if he’s a suspect,” she says. “What kind of person is he? Did you get on? Will you see him again?”
His breathing slowed. It was the same dream, he realised, the nightmare he hadn’t had for years. Something had brought it out of cold storage in his Mind Palace and shown it to his sleeping brain.
“That depends, Henry,” says Holmes. “If something bad is happening at school, and people are getting hurt, we want to find out what’s going on. We want to stop it.”
He considers this concept. While the idea that everyone has a corresponding person who fits them perfectly is preposterous, he’s aware that many people believe this.
Their feet echo down the passage. As soon as they hear the stairwell door close, the entire class erupts.
There are other things to think about too, and this might be a distraction from those. It might be the jumping off point. Is he ready to think about changing careers, taking a job at a surgery— or something else?
“How’s the investigation going?” I don’t have to spell it out: the charges against Sherlock that led him to the roof of Barts. I’d like to see his name cleared, but rarely see anything in the news about it now. It’s almost as if it never happened. Since I know the things said about him were all lies, and expect that Mycroft is just as eager to see him exonerated, it’s surprising that nothing has been said publicly.
I don’t need a counsellor, but I do need something else to occupy me. Sarah Sawyer, the one I used to date, offers me a job at her surgery, so I accept. I begin working four days a week, enough to keep me from alarming people.
“Who the hell is Murray?” Names were Watson’s area. I routinely deleted most names and faces now that I had someone to sort all of that out for me.
doing the Work. He misses them at crime scenes, talking through the evidence, chasing suspects. That’s not good, because it’s what got John clonked in the head a few weeks ago and turned him into someone different. He can’t let that happen again, so it’s better if they don’t consider any cases. He doesn’t want any new personalities; he’ll stick with this John Watson, damaged though he may be.
“He thought he was introducing us,” John explains. “But Sherlock and I already knew one another, from school. And we weren’t pleased to see one another.”
. He was always ready to go somewhere, to meet new people, to try their food and hear their stories. Once he’d even sailed around the globe, he said. During one of the wars, he’d lived on a submarine. He’d thought about being an astronaut, seeing the world from miles in space. He loved the world.
Sherlock himself has never considered that there might be a soulmate out there waiting for him to appear. The odds of finding a person who would love him for himself are infinitesimal. At best, he will spend his life loving people who leave him. Or avoiding love altogether.
The house where he lived with Mary was always her house. She chose the paint, the rugs, and the furnishings, and he figured that was her right. That’s what brides do, make a house into a home, create a space where children are cared for. She set their routines and all the rules about where things go, and he paid the bills. It only took one attempt for him to learn that feet don’t belong on the coffee table, socks belong in the hamper, and toilet seats should not be left up. It wasn’t his home; it was Mary’s house.
I shrugged. “Perhaps I’m mean-spirited. I could not think of any woman I’d want to imagine with you. I invented one who complained constantly.”
He’s always wondered at the elasticity of time. It’s years before he sees Watson again, and every day feels like a month. After the second war, he had to leave London. People might have thought him ageless, but there is a limit to what can be believed.
I’m a social person. I go on pub nights with Lestrade and other NSY people, with my old rugby buddies, my army buddies, and people from the surgery where I used to work.
As if just now realising Watson is there, Wilkes turns his head and frowns at him. “Watson, isn’t it?”
“Tonight,” I said, unwilling to cling to him longer, lest he change his mind. My eyes followed him as he walked away.
The police were coming out through the veranda door, spreading out across the lawn, shining torches towards the perimeter. I could see dark shapes approaching and heard a confused jumble of voices shouting for us to halt.
Holmes shrugs. “You might be sleeping in your own bed now if you hadn’t taken drugs and followed a murderer to the scene of his planned crime. Those things could have been avoided, if you’d only thought it through. Though it’s rather brilliant that I now have a victim who survived. I intend to question you thoroughly once I’ve had a cup of tea that doesn’t taste like dishwater.”
I told her that the odds of keeping her secrets hidden were very slim, even if she paid. The blackmailer might return her letters, but what they contained had already been read and might come back to haunt her at any time. She could never make the final payment on her past, never be free from the fear of future discovery. This is what makes blackmail such an effective crime, I explained. She left, downhearted.
They return to the house. John turns on the telly and Rosie retreats to her room. At least they’ve talked, he thinks. He can’t expect her to sit beside him and demand a story or just let him cuddle her. Even if he’d stayed, if he hadn’t left for three years, she would still have changed and wouldn’t want those things now. He’ll just have to see what kind of relationship they can have. As long as they talk, he won’t lose her.
She shakes her head. “I don’t know. I heard her talking to David. He thinks she should move to New York.”
“She troubles me,” he says, looking down into his tea. “She’s not what she appears to be, but I don’t trust my feelings about it. Do you think it’s just jealousy talking?”
Unfortunately, the sofa was already occupied. Ariel was back, and she’d brought a friend with her. Teenaged girls always travel in packs, I remembered.
had never been filmed before an audience, and though it had a huge fan base, he’d never felt their devotion like this before, as an almost physical force.
“What does marriage have to do with romance?” I said. “It is a business arrangement, pure and simple. You do not have to
John cuts a look at him and sees the corner of his mouth twitch. He takes his hand and squeezes it. “You’re brilliant.”
He’s remembering another year, another wedding, standing at another altar, and the vow he made then. That day seems like another lifetime.
Watson dealt with their behaviour by ignoring them. Of course, it was impossible to ignore all the things they said and did, pranking him and spreading rumours, but he did his stoic best not to let them see how it affected him. Holmes’s contribution to the bullying was merely to make some embarrassing deductions. In fact, Watson can’t remember him doing it much after that first, devastating series of revelations, and only when he had an audience. Somehow he’d known about Watson’s terrible parents, the poor neighbourhood where he grew up, the inadequate schools he attended. He observed how uncomfortable Watson felt in the new environment, and exploited his inadequacy, humiliating him in front of his new peers.
“Yes. But I’m more afraid of not trying. Of being alone. When you left, I realised that I couldn’t go back to being alone. Because of you. I want to try. I want… you.”
This may have been because he had reached adolescence, when everything suddenly looks different and feels more annoying, except for sex. It was at this point when he realised why he didn’t like girls. He liked boys.
Sherlock sits up, hops to his feet with more energy than John feels. “I can sleep anywhere, even standing up,” he says. “I take micronaps.”
After five minutes of wordless pacing, Holmes abruptly announces, “I’m going for a walk, clear my head a bit.”
There’s never a good time to have this conversation, but it has to happen soon. He doesn’t want to upset this contentment, though. He just wants to sit here, pretending things are as they used to be, Sherlock and John silently having tea together. Of course he wants more. He wants John to call him
Gasping, the released captive rolls away from him. Watson extends him a hand, pulls him into a seat. “I’m a doctor,” he says. “Will you let me look at your neck?”
This was sort of an experiment. It's more usual for me to write short stories, AU or ACD. My concept this time was to write something longer, a story centered around their growing relationship without any other main conflicts. No major cases, no demons, no alternate universes, no time travel, no Reichenbach. A first meeting, a rom-com story arc.
I came near him and knelt down to see him. He hadn’t changed, but I had. He knew me, but seemed to marvel that I was grown now. Ghosts do not feel time pass, so to him it might have seemed that I had just left and now returned a man. Raising his translucent hand, he touched my face, traced the line of my jaw. I felt the same bone-deep chill that I had known.
“Talking does me no good. I want to understand, inasmuch as that’s possible. Evidence, facts. That’s how my mind works.”
“No land line, no mobile listed. Looks like you’ll have to go bang on his door if you want to blackmail him. Or hook up with him.”
Because we can’t see the soul, perhaps it departs into the air after death. Or maybe it becomes a ghost.
“Yes.” One word, a huge admission for John, who is even worse than Sherlock when it comes to understanding his own feelings. He’s probably spent years insisting that he’s not gay, not like that— and now he’s understood. But he thinks it’s too late, and that’s just not true.
“The spleen, as you know, is an important part of the immune system. It continually screens the blood for suspicious microbes. In the same way, you keep me right, screening for idiots and protecting me from illness.”
He’s thinking about his pub night, Murray blathering endlessly about his amazing baby who could eat and sleep and poop. It’s an unkind thought. Of course he’s happy for him. He should send a baby gift. It will have to be something gender-neutral, though, since he still doesn’t know whether Marley is a boy or a girl. He’s leaning towards it being a girl, but it probably isn’t a good idea to go out and buy pink baby suits or hats or whatever it is that babies wear. Maybe green.
“Here is the truth, Watson: it was not to me that he confessed. I was a student, remember, not an ordained priest. The priest who heard the confession was so unnerved that he told me, in confidence. He also told me the name of the man. I had already decided to leave the priesthood at that point, and knowing my talent for deduction, he said that I must look into the man’s history.”
Through just the merest chance, John is not blown up, and Sherlock suspects that Moriarty doesn’t make mistakes. Not a chance, then; it’s a deliberately left opening for escape.
My brother had rented a flat for me in London after I left Cambridge. I hadn’t yet decided how I would earn my bread and cheese, but I knew that London was the place I needed to do it.
“You’re shaking.” Watson took my hands and examined the knuckles. “Fisticuffs? Must I begin worrying about you having rows with strangers?”
Ella has asked him a question. Frowning, he looks up and tries to remember what it was. Since he isn’t really listening, all he can recall is the sound of her voice. The look on her face is calm and kind, as always, the sort of vigilant patience all therapists learn. He knows her intent is to help him open up, but it’s almost predatory the way she looks for the cracks in his veneer. She’s already got two possible questions planned, depending on his answer. Even though it’s obvious that he’s not paying attention.
I thought he’d fallen asleep then, but in a few minutes he raised his head and looked at me. “I would like to be your husband, if you’ll have me.”
“Not a vivid green, though,” says Sherlock. “Like ab-snith…absence… absinthe. Absinthe.” He says the word several times to make sure it’s right. Not an easy word. “Absinthe. I had it once.”
He walked back to Baker Street. At some point along the way it started to rain, which only reinforced the feeling that he was trapped in some idiotic rom-com. Trudging on, he assessed what he had just learned.
“No interviews until after the broadcast,” Irene announced to the cast. “You’re not to say a word to anyone. And you probably shouldn’t look at the fan forums. Speculation there is through the roof, and it won’t do you any good to know what they’re saying. We have just one chance to get this right, so keep your mind on the performance.”
“I think you need to lie down. Yes, there’s a good fellow. Now, I’ll perch here beside you and pretend I’m waking you up.” He sat and began to shake Watson. “Come, Watson, Come! The game is afoot! Not a word! Out of your clothes and come!”
“There are things… I’d be giving up. A normal life… a marriage, maybe children. She saved me, and I might owe her something for that. If I hadn’t met her, there’s a good chance I might have…” He falls silent again.
Jim had no doubt called for a rescue team even before Sherlock hit the water; he knew he had to get as far away from the place as he could. With the breather, he could at least get well out of sight before surfacing and checking his location.
The newsvidders went mad. It turned out that Tjinn was not the only Companion on Persephone to retire in the aftershocks of the bombing. Sherlock had not seen the breathless stories about ‘the end of the era of Companions’, but it turned out he was the last Companion on Persephone.
John’s attention was downwards, at the tiny table crammed with food. John’s plate was full, his fork was full, his mouth was full.
It could be tens of kilometers before he found anything or anyone, and he was already feeling the strain of his injuries and long confinement in bed. He had no food, no water, no money. He might as well be in prison.
“Sherlock,” she said after a time, “I’ve been your manager for many years, but you’re like a son to me, you know.”
“But not all of them, I’m sure,” Sherlock said. “It will eliminate quite a number.” Sherlock walked over to the map of Toronto on the wall. “Jerome, circle the ones with cafes?”
There was a line of five shower stalls, fortunately all clean; he wondered how recently the studio had been used. He turned on the shower at the far end, watching the water catch the sunlight.
Nice start. He’s a bit older than I first thought but he’s not Joe at least. Eye bags, but the eyes holding them up are a brilliant blue. Bastard’s eyes? Not sure yet. He’s only said one word so far, volley back.
Much thanks to Mr. Standbygo, who offered advice on ships and how they’d be hailed. He also drew some pictures of The Baker for me, which I will post as soon as I figure out how.
“I’m pretty sure Lassiter closed them all down.” Bahdri yawned hugely. “Look, my phone’s been ringing off the hook too, all day. It’s after ten. Let me get some sleep, and I’ll call some of the other techs in the morning, okay? You get some sleep too, John.”
“He thought it was best he wasn’t seen outside, dear,” Mrs. Hudson said. “But he’s been ever so worried, the whole time.”
“Awful things - like what?” Working in retail meant that everyone traded evil customer stories, but Bernie only shook her head and repeated, a bit tearfully, “Awful things.”
Ella counted off on her fingers. “Obviously you must be focused on Rosie while you are parenting her. While at the clinic, you are focused on your patients. While investigating cases with Sherlock, you are focused on the case, or Sherlock, or the police, or the victim.”
“Excellent. Don’t worry too much about that transition into scene three, you nailed it at the dress.”
It was cold; really, really cold. And damp. The temperature did not make him grateful for the wool clothes, just made him realize that now he was both cold
Mycroft listened for a moment more, then straightened, and smiled at John. “Thank you,” he said to the nurse, and she replaced the mask. “I don’t think you need concern yourself, John. In fact, I suspect that Sherlock will regain consciousness on his own shortly.”
John could feel himself wavering, and knew that Sherlock could see that. “I don’t know a lot of the really recent stuff, it all sounds like auto-tuned crap to me.”
Holmes froze, his left hand tangled in Evans’ shirt, pulling him upright, and his right fist cocked back for another blow.
Abruptly Janina lowered her voice and spoke softly. “I don’t think they’ve bugged my office but keep it up for the guard out there.”
John kissed him again, taking control, and Sherlock felt something shift inside him. He kissed back, feeling absolute passion rush through his muscles and nerve endings, pouring up and out into John, only to be met with a flood of passion coming back from him. The passion lifted and became joy.
Sherlock stopped before he could remember to be contrary. John stood and limped to him until he was in Sherlock’s face, his face hard and dark with fury.
John had listened to this speech with mounting disbelief and horror. It couldn’t be possible that a man of Holmes’ age had gotten this far in his life believing that intimate male relationships were out of reach. They were illegal, but certainly not unknown. John remembered his own childhood and education, where all forms of sexual orientation were taught and celebrated; then he shook himself, knowing that such attitudes were at least 150 years in the future. Even Krafft-Ebing’s studies were still a few years off. But –
Even slippage of a week would be disastrous in this case. There were three possibilities that could happen in a week:
A large pane of glass separated John from the interrogation room. Greg could see through it, and knew that it was a mirror on the other side. The room was bare, with only a metal table and two chairs… and no Sherlock. But John was looking at the window and giggling – had he finally lost his mind?
Her voice was calm and soothing, and Sherlock was suddenly so tired. Oh, she was good. No wonder she had been able to immerse herself in the role of a wife and nurse for four years.
John stood, wincing a little as the dried blood ripped at the skin of his leg. “Apologies, Mrs. Hudson. Please excuse me.”
Dunworthy clasped his other hand over John’s, his eyes warm. “You’re a good man, John Watson,” he said. “It was worth the risk. Latimer’s an idiot and will pitch a fit, but it’s time I retired, anyway.”
“Stop right there.” The pause in Mycroft’s sentence was making Sherlock see red. “I was not ‘entertaining’ him, Mycroft. He. Is. My. Friend.”
There was something about the tone of her voice that pierced through Sherlock’s aching head, through the sharpness of the fear he’d been living under for days. He let the gun drop, just a little, but didn’t take his eyes away from her hands.
He carefully took the blanket from the back of John’s chair and laid it gently over John. He considered going to his own room, but then decided that if John could wait for him, he would wait for John.
The window wasn’t even locked. He grinned, but reminded himself to not underestimate the situation, and peered out.
John reached across the table and grabbed at Sherlock’s flailing hands. Sherlock stared at him, wide-eyed.
“But the remarkable thing about conculium is that when it heats up to 35 degrees, body temperature -  for instance when swallowed, or comes in contact with skin - it turns a vivid purple colour.”
“Asif,” she said, and she started to laugh as she spoke, “I’m going to require support to put together a large sale. Not Bernie. And then we need to have a meeting with security on Desk Twelve.”
John’s jaw tightened. “I haven’t told her yet. I wanted to talk to you first. I’ll wake her up, take her to the bathroom and tell her.”
John’s jaw flexed, and he limped quickly off to the bedroom designated for him and Maja. Maja stood in the sitting room, staring at the cameras, her hand over her mouth. John returned from the bedroom a moment later, the frown on his face acting as confirmation.
“Because Mr. Snappy Comeback, Mr. I’m-the-Smartest-Person-in-the-Room, had absolutely no suggestions for how to improve the way we do things here. You’re distancing yourself already, from the people and the systems, by not inserting yourself into them.”
Sherlock’s jaw dropped in astonishment as his brain struggled to comprehend what he had heard. He hadn’t heard the code phrase from someone else’s mouth in years – and from the person he least expected to hear it from.
“Then we came here, and you found the cameras in the flat. I hadn’t seen them. Hadn’t even thought to look for them. I realized then that I’d become complacent, allowed myself to get rusty and not use my senses. I wanted to be John Watson, MI6 again.
“Not really, I’ve been kind of seeing John and I’m kind of friends with Sherlock and,” I say, and my self censor decides to take a vacation, “I want to go chat with them and make them see that they’re actually in love with each other.” Then I smile brightly.
“Right,” Sherlock said. “Right,” he said again, but John was already slowly making his way down the hallway.
Sherlock was walking around the displays, looking at each picture keenly but briefly, with occasional glances at the artist if they were standing nearby. John could recognize the look in his eye – that analyzing, deductive, slicing look. A couple of the students attempted to talk to him, but Sherlock would only hum in response and sweep on.
Rosie had said nothing since the incident in Regent’s Park. He accepted the silence as his own accusation for letting her down.
John laughed softly, in joy and relief. “You need never ask again. It is yours, permanently, without hesitation.”
Sherlock’s eyes were closed, losing himself in the music in a way that was achingly familiar for John. He swayed slightly to the music, leaning into the longer notes as though his spine was matching the draw of the bow. His body held a slight tension, in strict attention to the music, but his face was relaxed, childlike and nearly glowing with happiness.
He was aware, vaguely, of Bahdri’s arm around him, supporting him. Bahdri’s voice was so quiet John had to strain to hear him. “Something happened to you, I think, when you were doing the Victorian study?”
“Yes, all the staff,” John said. He looked around the large house and wondered how many staff it would take to run such a place.
He looked up. Just down the streets the line of buildings was broken by trees and grass. In a moment, the map of central Belgrade clicked into his mind, and he knew that this was Pionirski Park, and that the park was only a few blocks north and west of the embassy. He also knew the park was full of bushes and hedges and trees – places to hide.
“My idea was to distract him, to keep him away from the flat long enough to allow you two to get well away. I think one of the guards could see that something was wrong upstairs, he kept trying to get Pavlović’s attention, but Pavlović kept waving him off. I should be grateful to Pavlović’s ego, I suppose.
He ran full speed after Holmes, wondering what Holmes was thinking, but it was clear that their conversation had triggered something. He pulled up at 221B just as Holmes was opening the door, and they both clattered up the stairs. Mrs. Hudson was in the hallway, holding a tea tray, and nearly dropped it in surprise when they ran past.
John’s smile lit up the room more than all the fairy lights in the world. “As are you. See you tonight.”
“I thank you for your help, Doctor, and for Mr. Holmes as well,” Cubitt said. “Sir, be honest with me – am I overreacting? Are these scribbles mere child’s play, and my response unnecessary?”
“Listen carefully, Sherlock,” Janina whispered, leaning in close. “I was able to get word to a friend at the British Embassy. They know you’re alive and in Belgrade. They’re on alert for you. All you have to do is get close to the gates and they will open them for you.”
He wished he was as confident as his voice let on. Holmes hadn’t moved, and seemed frozen in time, staring at the papers.
He realized that he never asked his contact or Mycroft what was on the chip. Best not to know, he supposed.
One morning he woke, and his body felt like his own again. He put his feet on the cool of the linoleum floor and wiggled his toes. He stood and moved to the foot of the bed.  Using the footboard as a barre, he began his usual morning warmup –
. Then in one quick, sharp movement, she kicked him in the face; or rather appeared to, her pointe shoe whistling past his ear. He rolled backwards, extending his legs straight up. This was the athletic highlight of the piece. He allowed his legs to drop excruciatingly slowly, using every muscle in his arms and core to keep him balanced and control the movement. He heard gasps from the audience, but did not allow his satisfaction to distract him. He maintained his control until his legs touched the floor, then released carefully, muscle by muscle.
“Got walloped by my Da for drawing on my wall with it when I was three.” John grinned at Sherlock, and Sherlock grinned back.
Here’s the Mad Hatter scene, with John taking Steven McRae’s role: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq8zqhqjUIo&list=PL5qf7zxCk2JBzIwfMCiRgY8UOA0ExQq77&index=13&t=0s
“John’s so much happier, now he’s moved back,” Sherlock said. “He looked so sad, for years and years, but he smiles now.”
Mrs. Hudson turned out to be a tiny older woman, with wrinkles that evidenced both grief and joy in her past. “Mr. Holmes,” she said.
Maja gasped softly, and Sherlock leaned to whisper softly in her ear, “Don’t worry, he’s part monkey.” Her answering laugh was just a breath of air, but he could feel her trembling slow a little.
It took John’s jetlagged brain entirely too long to get the joke, then he found himself giggling in a terribly undignified way for a visiting consulting detective’s assistant. He could almost feel Sherlock glaring at him, then Jerome started a big, booming laugh that kept John going for a while.
One warm afternoon they were returning from doing the shopping, and Sherlock kept stopping and doing what John had now dubbed his ‘music hall’ gesture. This happened several times as they walked the short distance from Tesco, and Sherlock’s gestures became increasingly frantic and stroppy.
John was still looking a little dazed. “If you know all that – if you can figure out all that – what can I
I suppose what I want everyone to take away from this is - stay hopeful. Protect. Be smart. Find your community. Love.
He rang every history student he knew, but no one knew anything more than what Lassiter had said. It appeared that he had more information than anyone else, having heard Lassiter’s announcement in the lab, which had merely confirmed some rumours and denied others.
This is the most graphic chapter - warnings for kidnapping, child endangerment, suggestions of murder and cannibalism. Sherlock saves the day. Summary at the end of the chapter if you’d prefer to skip.
“Thank Christ this is only about a coin,” Sherlock/Victor said. “Imagine if Bantam had decided to try murder. You’d never find the body out here.”
“Calm down, Sherlock,” Mycroft said in a maddeningly patient tone that set Sherlock’s teeth on edge. “Of course it’s your choice. I simply urge you to consider your reputation. Perception is reality, you know. Was Professor Flynn upset at your having to cut the evening short?”
It takes strength to know what's right. And love isn't something that weak people do. Being a romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope. I think what they mean is when you find somebody that you love, it feels like hope.
He resolved to return in the morning, when the light was at its best. He hadn’t really seen the sun since this began, the sky only becoming a lighter gray rather than murky black.
“No thank you,” Holmes said calmly. “I know you hail from America, but that’s not the way things are done here in England.”
They spent a good three days cleaning up the kitchen in preparation; Sherlock pouted through the careful packing away of his experimental equipment, while John appreciated the opportunity to give the kitchen a proper sterilization.
Her hands stroked over his shoulders, calming and hypnotic. “Sherlock dear, you go to Mr. Moriarty tomorrow. Don’t you think you ought to start packing?”
“Remember that I worked with each of your personalities for nearly a year before you integrated with them. I know their voices well.”
Here's how it is: Sherlock has agreed to become Jim Moriarty's personal Companion, not realizing he's changing history on Persephone. Mrs. Hudson does some cleaning up, and Sherlock adds another animal to his paper zoo.
The teacher, Mrs. Roshni, was about ten years older than John, with salt and pepper hair in a neat bob. John wondered what Sherlock would interpret from the callouses on her hands; what John could tell immediately was that she was a good teacher who was quite happy to be teaching art to adults at night school.
“Well, as I said, ambition. Next to sexual jealousy, it’s the most common motivator for violent crimes.”
“Even more boring than Langstaff’s. I went to school when I was twelve, graduated when I was eighteen, been working ever since.”

“Tjinn,” Sherlock said heavily. He knew this meant the end of her career as a Companion; none of her talents and charms mattered if her face was marred. “Oh Tjinn. I’m so sorry.”
John drank again, but not as desperately as before. He sat back, as though the act of drinking had exhausted him. “All right.
“I’d like that.” Sherlock traced the line of John’s jaw, growing serious again. “I must admit I’m feeling insecure as well, John. You’ve been all over the Black, and I’ve never left Persephone.”
“I’m sorry, Watson,” he whispered. He wasn’t even sure she could hear him over her wails. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
He forced himself to breathe, each inhale taken with trepidation and terror that it would be his last.
“I’m grateful you’ve made time in your schedule for me,” she said, then faltered. “Ahm… I’ve not… how does…”
Jerome Maitland had been Jamie’s friend at uni in Toronto, but John couldn’t think of two people more unalike: Jamie, their contact with the Victoria Police, was of Chinese descent, compact and wiry, his hair buzzed close to the skin; Jerome was a black man, enormously tall and broad in the shoulders, with a cascade of black and gray dreadlocks down his shoulders. Jamie had moved to British Columbia and joined the police force there right after uni; Jeromie had stayed on in Toronto, working security in various places, rising eventually to the role of Head of Security at the Royal Ontario Museum. John tried to imagine the two men side by side and failed. As they approached him, however, Jerome’s face split into a huge grin that immediately dispelled all of John’s subconscious nervousness about the man’s size.
John counted on his fingers. “My trousers itch. My waistcoat itches. My collar itches. My socks itch. My goddamn underwear itches. And my face itches more than any of that put together.”
But then Sherlock’s eye caught sight of John, by the doors, and saw him moving slightly, with contained restless energy, to the beat of the music.
Sherlock was silent for enough time to let John think he was going to leave it at that, but then Sherlock began to speak, so softly that John had to lean forward to hear. “When I was away – I was in Serbia, I had traced the last of Moriarty’s influence there. I was trying to escape capture. There was a forest, a thick forest, and it was night, and I thought I could get away by running into it. I was running and running, and I was exhausted but I knew if they caught me it would mean torture and possibly death. And as I ran, I tried to keep myself from giving up by thinking about – here, about home. Coming home.”
“Because you are… Canadian? The manifest said you were British. Why did you tell me you were Canadian?”
Ignoring Pavlović’s look of shock, Sherlock strode quickly back towards the gate. He felt Mrs. Hudson’s fingers on his lapel, surprisingly strong, and he was pulled through the gates of the embassy, pulling Maja in behind him.
“How much does he owe you?” he said. He was careful to keep his voice calm, his demeanour nonchalant. These people thrived on fear, on the draining weakness of it. He would not allow them to have his fear.
And, less immediate, how was Sherlock going to live without John? How could he function in life having held John in his arms, and knowing that he could never hold him again?
“But I’m concerned he’s in pain. About an hour ago he started groaning. The nurses are worried. I’m worried. There could be some internal damage that we can’t detect at this point. There could even be damage to his-”
After a long, horrible, silent moment, Sherlock pulled a piece of origami paper towards him and began to fold. “Do you remember why I do the origami, the animals?”
“Extraordinary!” Holmes said. He put his palms together, fingertips at his lips, a posture that John knew meant he was thinking. “I would be pleased to be part of such a fascinating story. But, surely, Mr. Garrideb, you would have better luck by placing an advertisement in the papers?”
“What you need is some fresh air, to get out of these stuffy rooms,” John said. “You haven’t left since Cubitt was here. Go put on your coat and hat, and we’ll go up to Regent’s Park for a spell.”
John could feel his hands gripping into fists, and wondered how he would keep from beating the hell out of Bantam when he next saw him. Sherlock/Victor saw, and shook John’s hands loose again.
Sherlock handed over a large traveljar of coffee, and watched impatiently as John took a sip to test the temperature, then one large rather desperate gulp.
The driver guided the car into the airport, directly to a private runway behind the building and to the steps of a Learjet. Sherlock could hear the roar of the engines of the little plane.
“Aged forty-nine. 169 centimeters tall. Hair is sandy blond with some grey; eyes deep blue. Doctor. Formerly a soldier, honourably discharged after being wounded in Afghanistan. My flatmate and colleague since 2010. Widower, one daughter aged 26 months and twelve days. Saved my life multiple times, more times than he himself knows. And three hundred and fifty eight days, nine hours and eighteen minutes ago, just after midnight on New Year’s Eve, he kissed me.  He has brought me happiness that I thought was not an option for me. I have been irrevocably changed by him, and I cannot simply
“No, that was James. I was deep undercover here, procuring information and data, to get over the border. James was a courier, and, I guess, so were you.”
“I will leave you to get settled,” Pavlović said, as though he was a concierge of a high end hotel instead of a high ranking military secret service agent. “The Director of the National Theatre will visit with you later this week to discuss your performance. Until then, enjoy your stay.”
“I do,” Sherlock said, “I do, but-” Suddenly fear and doubt gripped him, like a fist around his heart. Had he misunderstood everything? Had he placed John in terrible danger and risk because he’d gotten it wrong? “Don’t you – do you-” Sherlock’s breath was coming low and shallow. He couldn’t shake himself of the fear that he was wrong, that he’d made a mistake. “Do you – do you love me, John?”
“It’s all right, slow, slow,” Sherlock muttered to Maja. Her breath was rabbit-quick, with occasional tiny whimpers. He drew her close and set the pace at casual but quick, just out of the pool of the lights from the streetlamps, like a couple out late after a night out.
John and Sherlock placed their respective loaves on the table and glanced at each other, shrugged, and walked into the lounge.
For a moment, he was frozen into silence. He forced himself to breathe, then said as calmly as possible, “I told you Daddy was delayed, Watson. Remember?”
“I keep one packed,” Holmes said. “In my profession, one needs to be prepared for all circumstances at all times.”
“That’s because you’ve got legs up to your neck, and you can’t stretch out properly. Baths aren’t much fun if half of your body is not actually in the water. Get in and see.”
Sherlock couldn’t catch his breath, hitching and shuddering. The muscles in his body, large muscles in his legs, tiny muscles in his hands, couldn’t stop twitching. His skin prickled hot and cold, and he was awash in sweat.
“Well, of course, I could have delegated my artistic manager, or ballet master, or resident choreographer. But their English is negligible, and besides, I wanted to see you again, Sherlock.” Her voice deepened into a purr. “It’s been too long.”
John shuddered against Sherlock’s body. “Oh God,” he said. “Are you – sure? I mean, I want to but, do you, are you…”
Their mouths found each other, soft and tentative and still a little afraid. Then John let out a sigh against Sherlock’s lips, a sigh of relief of years of tension, and Sherlock made a quiet keening sound into John’s mouth, and suddenly the moment was no longer fraught with fear and doubt, but assurance and confidence and rushing joy.
“At school, especially as an adolescent, I saw that several of my classmates were quite focused on the possibility of future relationships with women. And while I certainly met some women who were engaging and even passingly intelligent, there were none whom I could consider as someone to spend time with, to share my life with. I therefore concluded that a solitary life was for me; that intimate and close relationships were not something that was available to me. I therefore committed myself to my work, and to the constant improvement of my mind and intellect.”
It was unnerving, drawing with Sherlock leaning over his shoulder. He felt terribly exposed, even more than when he was writing and Sherlock would stick his nose practically into the keyboard. He felt naked, and yet was unable to stop. He was distracted by Sherlock’s breath on his cheek, but kept his focus on his pencil and the lines of the corpse rising up on the page.
Lack of understanding of Sherlock’s purpose morphed into irritation and defensiveness. “You going to critique them, then?”
Sherlock and Penny did eventually develop a system – Sherlock would make his deductions and handwrite them on paper. Another member of the community was a fair artist and would draw a portrait of the person’s face and attach it to the deduction page. Later, Eileen found a Poloroid camera, and they used that. Penny then constructed a kind of bulletin board on the doors of the cathedral. Word spread, and survivors would come and use it as a centre for finding lost loved ones. Several reunions were engineered, and Penny cried every time.
“I want to hear about more about your work on the freighter,” Sherlock said as their laughter died down. “Your captain sounds fascinating – what was his name?”
If Boo were alive, she would have suggested sugar biscuits decorated to look like little penises and vaginas. That would be hilarious. Helpful in situations when you’re trying to figure out if a fellow’s gay or straight. If he takes both, he’s bi.
A moment of stillness passed, then John said quietly, “This is getting harder to do. The fighting thing.”
Sherlock slid his voice recorder out of his pocket. “All right Watson. Talk. Tell me why I shouldn’t beat the hell out of you right here and now.” He laid the recorder down on the table and pressed play.
A flush worked its way up John’s neck – praise, and from Sherlock. Unqualified praise, even. What was happening?
“Hmmm. Probably the murderer used an airborne anaesthetic or poison to subdue or kill the victim, which would explain the lack of toxins in the blood. The question is, who subdued him, and did the same person remove the teeth?”
John’s laughter turned to the high-pitched giggle again. “You…” he panted, “you… are insane. You are certifiable, you are. Oh my God.”
“I am pleased to hear that,” Holmes said, and John could tell from the tone of his voice that he was also not taken in by the man’s change of attitude. “Now please sit. This is an excellent opportunity to bring Doctor Watson up to speed on the case, if you would kindly give him the history. I would also be helped by hearing your perspective, as I have only heard my client’s.”
Now he saw them all, fully displayed. They were twisted and silvered and pale, telling John that they must have happened a while ago, when Sherlock was away. But there was no mistaking the severity of the wounds. John’s hands were shaking now, but, as if in a dream, he began to draw.
“I have John Watson, Mr. Holmes. Think of that. My men are not gentle. He’ll confess eventually; everyone does.”
“You’ve asked me to be your permanent Companion,” he murmured, his voice low and intimate in a way he had practiced for years. “I am the best Companion on Persephone. I am known throughout the quadrant for what I can do with my body, with my hands, with my mouth. My reputation is based in truth. Yet you’ve made a proposal without having,” Sherlock sighed, felt Jim echo it, “enjoyed my attentions. When I came out here to meet you, I thought you might want to… ensure that your investment would be worth your while. Yet you haven’t even touched me.”
He closes his eyes and kind of shrinks a little. “You weren’t expecting someone, I imagine?” he asks.
, Dunworthy’s voice said in his head. John snapped back to himself, and turned to look at Sherlock’s worried face. Wordlessly he passed the paper to Sherlock.
Sherlock froze, his eyes widening. John realized what Sherlock thought – that John was warning him of imminent danger.
The room was small, only approximately 3.5 by 3.67m. Rosie spent most of the first day thoroughly exploring the small space with the aid of a torch that Sherlock had packed in his haste. She carefully checked every corner and spot on the wall, noting the minor breaks in pattern on the wallpaper. When the dullness of reality failed her, she would pretend to have seen a bear, or an alien, or a unicorn. Sherlock participated fully in her imaginings, grateful for her resilient mind, even in its infantile stage.
“Thank you,” he said, grateful for Sherlock’s deflection, that he hadn’t been offended. He thought for a moment, and sang, “
The dreaded creep of boredom threatened to take over Sherlock’s brain, staved off by the explosions of joy that occurred every time John smiled at him, or touched him, or kissed him. It was marvelous, better than Sherlock had ever imagined, when he had allowed himself to imagine.
John sat back in the scented water and sighed. This was perfect: the water was beautifully hot, and the bath salts he had treated himself to were a nice blend of lemon and bergamot. He imagined himself as a teabag, dissolving into the water.
John sighed, amused but feeling a bit sorry for him. With a practiced set of moves, he wormed his way onto the chair and put his arms around Sherlock. Sherlock accepted the embrace, but he stayed tense and didn’t remove his arms from around his legs.
John cleared his throat discreetly beside him. Sherlock looked up, and saw that John had stepped away from the pilot’s seat.
From a side room came a woman, barefoot and wearing a rather homely terrycloth robe. She was in her mid-40s, rather thick in the middle, with a cascade of loose, red, wavy hair. She stepped up to the dais and sat on the chair there. Keith made a disappointed sound, and John was about to kick him in the shin, but Mrs. Roshni fixed Keith with a glare that was far more effective in shutting him up.
Rosie had fallen asleep, sugar dotting her mouth, her new stuffy firmly under one arm, stretched out over Sherlock’s lap, her head pillowed on John’s leg.
Nous ne voulions pas que vous vous blessiez dans votre sommeil. - We did not want you to hurt yourself in your sleep.

John slipped the jacket off, and hung it on the back of a chair. He started to shrug his own jacket off, but Sherlock stopped him, placing his hands over John’s and saying, “Wait.”
“Oh yes dear, come in,” she says, and I immediately want to ask her for tea and some biscuits please. “They’re upstairs, but I think they’ve got someone with them right now. Are you a client?”
“A couple. I propose that we order in and, while we wait for the delivery, you let me admire how damn gorgeous you are with these fairy lights.”

?” she said. She made a face that pantomimed suffering, and he held up his hand as far as the restraints would allow and tipped his thumb and pinky finger – so-so. He didn’t want her putting him on morphine and incapacitating him further.
As he rounded the corner toward interrogation room five, he heard … something. He slowed down, quieting his footsteps to hear better. He had half expected to hear John still raising a ruckus – for a small man, he could raise a fairly loud ruckus if Sherlock had been slighted – but instead he heard something else.
And probably unlikely. He hadn’t met any girls whom he could adore. In fact, they seemed to become more annoying every day.
. And it’s putting him off, making it hard to think. Irritated, he turns to aim a caustic remark in their direction.
This makes John smile. He feels like a different person, too. When he thinks back to that awful blind date, he sometimes can’t believe that he’s with such a wonderful man, loved by him and loving him in return.
Only one person lived here, and he was not a slob. His diet consisted mostly of takeaway, but the fridge contained eggs and milk, and there was a half loaf of bread on the worktop, so he might make his own breakfast. He drank Yorkshire Red, probably because he thought the Gold wasn’t superior by a wide enough margin to justify the cost. He wasn’t a snob, this flat-dweller. He counted his pennies.
In his mind, he recreated that cab ride. As he recalled, he spent most of the trip thinking about John and getting teary, remembering the moment he heard of John’s death.
No wedding ring, he notes. Well, of course not. She wore it when he returned, but that was just to make it look like she wanted to reconcile. Mary never wants to be the bad guy. She made an effort for about a month, and then he realised it was all over.
“I have seen the way you flirt with ladies, Watson— and a few men. You cannot even stop yourself from flirting with our client’s daughter, the vapid Miss Chadwick. Even so, it does not bother me because I trust you. I know that it means nothing. Can you not grant me the same?”
But whatever she felt for him was also blinding her to how bad her script really was. Her agenda was easy to deduce.
“Oh, stop it, Watson.” I slammed the secret panel shut. “You need not flatter my ego so shamelessly. Rather, I deserve your mockery. I have been bested by a woman.”
I turned my attention back to Philip, who was discussing Nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence as it might reflect the history of Western Poetry.
Sherlock pitched his voice low, dark and honeyed. “That’s it, you’re almost there, Sybil, aren’t you? You’re on the edge. Now. Give me your hands – is this all right? – above your head, that’s good. Hold onto the headboard, don’t let go. And tilt your legs back. Very good. Does that feel good? Yes? I can feel the tension in your muscles. Holding still, your body stretched out like this, it increases muscle tension. And it will intensify your pleasure when – yes, that’s it, yes, yes, good, Sybil, good, let go-”
A whooping came from the television, startling him. He dashed to the sitting room, his eyes only for Rosie, who looked up at him with some confusion.
“Hi, my name’s John,” he said when the boy looked up, suspicious and wary. He made sure to include the mother in his smile, but directed his words towards the boy. “I wanted to ask you a favour. I’m from England, as you can tell from my accent, and so is my friend over there. He plays violin and didn’t bring it with us, and he misses playing a lot. Would it be all right if he borrowed your violin for a moment?”
“You did exactly the right thing,” John murmured to her. “Making him puke. You did the right thing.”
Still. The kissing and touching and smiles were marvelous. They were enough to keep him from leaving, from going back into the wastelands that he still thought he deserved, but it was not enough to make him feel useful.
Okay, he’s thinking about bloody Sherlock Holmes again. How did that happen? Obviously, he’s drunk and ought to be getting sick in some alley instead of imagining Holmes staring into his soul.
“Fine, but it’s not necessary. I’m doing this purely out of gratitude that your brother didn’t wreck my life.”
He would just have to call Molly, he decided, and warn her not to be too trusting. Taking his phone out, he keyed in Molly’s number. As he listened to it ringing, he realised that she might be with Brook, and he’d better suss that out before he said anything.
She shakes her head. “Dad’s loving legacy to us. Not good.” She sighs and slings her bag over her shoulder. “Well, no lectures. Just, if you want to talk, I’d like that. And if you’d like me to butt out—“
But Sherlock wasn’t sentimental. That was John. If the contest had been about who was going to cry the most when it was over, John could easily win that. He couldn’t walk away from this, though. Not until it was over.
were interested. Plural. Surely not Patricia, who is nearly his mother’s age. So. Natalie and Dustin were talking about him. They obviously haven’t decided whether he’s gay or straight. He imagines Dustin telling Natalie,
Watson made an impatient huff. “Holmes, this makes no sense. How will you be safer alone? How will I be safe, traveling by myself? If the notes are so important, surely we can pay a courier to take them to London. There is no reason for me to go. Clearly you wish to face Moriarty alone for some reason I cannot divine. Perhaps your pride makes you think you must meet him man to man. Perhaps you wish to claim this dubious victory for yourself. I know your disposition well, and I will not leave you alone to meet him.”
For a long time they lie there, neither of them asleep. When he hears John beginning to breathe deeply, Sherlock gets out of bed. He goes to the other room and sits in his chair, thinking.
Mycroft knows better than to ask for tea. He takes a seat in what Sherlock now thinks of as John’s chair, crosses his legs, and studies his brother. Sherlock remains in his own chair, his legs drawn up to his chest, nursing a cooling cup of tea.
I expected that this would bring Aunt Kitty, who would confine me to my room. I didn’t care about that; at least I would be alone. I could think about all those stories that I’d read and pretend I was in that book.
“It is generally a consideration when one is contemplating a lifetime of matrimony, you know.” He smiled. “But this was what you hoped, did you not? You were not actually considering marriage, were you?”
His life is triage, assessing the hurt and putting his efforts where they are most needed. Right now, Rosie needs him more than Sherlock.
profit me,” I replied. “If I negotiate with Milverton, it will only teach other blackmailers to ask an unreasonably high price, and victims that they only need run to me for help. I will become the broker of all such transactions and waste my talent saving the reputations of foolish people.”
“Decline?” It took me a moment to realise that my mouth had dropped open. “Oh. I see. Your modesty prevents you from accepting this unexpected proposal. You do not wish to appear desperate; therefore, I must woo you. Very well. We could perhaps go to a few concerts or plays. A month’s courtship will be enough to sooth your vanity. I will ask again.” I put the box back in my pocket. “Would you like coffee?”
That’s not where I want you, in my heart, a memory that will gradually fade and no longer feel like a gaping wound.
Jay is talking, asking them to move their chairs in closer so they can more easily see and hear each other. He wonders whether this is like an AA meeting, with first names only, and how much he’ll be expected to share. Can he just sit here quietly listening, or will that seem suspicious?
Milverton had turned up the lights in the room and was now looking at me with curiosity, still training his pistol on me. “Remove your mask.”
She narrowed her eyes and gave him a tight smile. “Leave him to me. He desperately wants to be famous and thinks the offers will begin rolling in once he’s been in the spotlight. Believe me, he’s not going to do anything to mess this up. You’re safe, and I’ve got a stand-in if it comes to that.”
It will take him longer this time; like Victor, John can’t be entirely deleted. He’s become a part of Sherlock’s world, his mind, his days and nights. But he can put him away, all those memories in a place he will refuse to visit, as he did with Victor. It must begin now, and for that to happen, he must first remember everything.
“No. Sorry. Your mum and I are… well, it’s over. We’re, um… we’re getting a divorce. I want you to understand, though, that it’s not your fault.”
Maybe they should talk about this, he thinks. But it’s not familiar ground, having conversations about sex, even in bed. They aren’t talkers.
As I watched him sleep, I understood what a treasure I had in him. I had tested his patience and his loyalty, and he had remained. Though he had a flexible morality when it came to breaking and entering or telling a strategic lie, and a flirtatious nature that made me constantly jealous, he had never wavered in his feelings towards me. Many times he’d told me he loved me, not only in words, but in his concern for me, his loyalty. He’d written me a love letter. When we alone, in the privacy of our bed, he would whisper in my ear,
The two detectives finally agreed that we should all go to the scene, minus Watson, who should remain locked up.
Since his return to London, he’s struggled to find his feet. He has no job, just a limp and a therapist. All his friends have moved on while he was gone. Some are married now, with jobs and children and houses in the suburbs. Once, he had all of those things, but now that’s a world he no longer fits into.
My brother didn’t come home for the funeral, or even afterwards. He was on the other side of the globe, I was told, and it would take months to get word to him.
on a gay person. It’s hard enough being gay without your partner, the person you trust, deciding that they’re not gay enough, or that you’re too gay, or that they really prefer… Well. Just… don’t do it.”
“It’s not your fault, Sherlock.” He says this gently. “I mean, in a way it is, but not because you made a mockery of my romantic evening.”
“He’s hurt that you didn’t tell him, and he thinks that you trusted others more than you trusted him. He’s angry and confused because just when he thought he might move on, there you were. He probably thinks you’ve been off on holiday.”
The humiliation of that moment has never left John. It wasn’t the end, either, not by a long shot. More deductions, many of them spot-on. It was as if Holmes could see into his brain, unearthing his most embarrassing thoughts and revealing them to their classmates. Every day, a new humiliation.
Tomato soup and toasted cheese is his choice. While he could make this himself, having someone else prepare it for him is a deserved indulgence. He’ll come back to the pastry case and decide about something sweet after he’s eaten. Maybe he’ll save that treat for tomorrow, with a cup of decent coffee.
As Holmes solves the cases, his fame grows, and the media attention he has never craved becomes a nuisance. He can barely leave the flat without some reporter cornering him and asking stupid questions. It’s draining. Ironically, the case that wins him the most recognition is the recovery of a valuable painting of the Reichenbach Falls, where he once died in 1891.
John stopped for a moment, his chest heaving, cock bobbing against his belly. He stroked the palms of his hands down Sherlock’s body, from his collarbones down his stomach, across the sharpness of his hipbones and along the length of his legs.
He could see Sherlock’s pulse racing in his carotid artery, see the flush on his cheeks. “I do,” he said in a near whisper.
“Don’t worry, John, it wasn’t you,” Bahdri said, still grinning. “You telling me about your man Sherlock Holmes inspired me to investigate. I went and had a pint with Giles, who was the tech on the Indiana/Iran fiasco. Well, I had a pint, he had about five. Turns out that Giles has a massive drinking problem, and he was hungover and still a bit drunk when he programmed that drop. But he didn’t want to admit it to Lassiter, so he covered up his mistake.”
They walked the short distance to the elevator, Greg followed behind. John and Sherlock were all business now, their strides swift and efficient. No one would believe Greg if he told them about these two behaving like twelve year olds. Greg decided it would be wisest to stay quiet, otherwise he might blurt out the secret.
Hands, lips, tongues aided their exploration of each other. After so long of only seeing, touching was like drinking water after a long drought. The more Sherlock touched, the more he wanted of John’s skin and mouth and hair. He had never felt like this with a client; this was something new, something he didn’t realize he wanted until now.
“I don’t care,” Sherlock snapped. “And he came back, Lestrade. We came back and he was treating the wounded, while I stood there like a…” Sherlock swallowed hard. “Get him out. I’m his alibi. Turn on your vidder, I’ll give my testimony now. Just get him out.”
“The same,” Garrideb said. “I have just come from the rooms of Mr. Nathan Garrideb, who told me he had hired you. And I must say that I do not understand why he needed to involve you in a private matter. I don’t want the police involved.”
John came home from surgery the next day to find Sherlock playing his violin. That was not in and of itself unusual, but what was odd was that when he finished the piece, Sherlock put down his violin and bow, and made a series of quick, sharp movements with his hands, finishing with a pushing motion to his left. Then he picked up his violin again and began another tune.
He cleared a space about a metre in diameter as close as possible where the door to 221 Baker Street had been. There he collected another pile of small rocks, forming them into the figure of an arrow, pointing north to Regent’s Park.
Sherlock hid his grin by taking his hoodie off. “Only if you want to. I actually do want to warm up – it’s been several days now.”
John nodded. “Yeah. You said something about doing a favour for your brother five years ago, a favour that pissed Pavlović off to that degree. Then with what that woman said today, I began to think that maybe…”
They decided to pack light, so as to prevent suspicion at the train station; it didn’t matter to John, as he only had the one suitcase anyway. He laid the gun on top of his spare change of clothes, then hesitated – he would only be able to take his journal through the net, and nothing else. Leaving his suitcase behind with his gun would provide Sherlock some additional security that he would return.
“Jim. To be honest, I love my career as a Companion. The variety of my life, the challenge of new clients. But I must admit that since the bombing, I’ve been re-evaluating everything.”
Sherlock was in the corridor between the bathroom and the kitchen. Behind him was a masked man dressed all in black. He was holding an honest to God pair of nunchuks, one baton in each hand, with the chain across Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock had managed to get his hands under the chain, but his face was red and straining. The masked man was pulling him backwards, trying to get him off his feet.
Sherlock and John retreated to the kitchen. As they closed the door, they heard Mrs Hudson say, “Oh shut up, all of you, and pour me a brandy.”
John was accustomed to being around intelligent people – he attended Oxford University for God’s sake. He himself was no slouch. But now it hit him, like a lightning strike –
Suddenly, amidst the jewel tones of silk and satin, bright medals and diamonds, he saw one figure in dull gray, standing in a corner by the doors. He was nearly unnoticeable, unobtrusive, unassuming, but constantly scanning the crowd, alert and watchful.

John tried to ignore the old man’s twitching lips, and slapped his hands on the desk. “Well, there’s nothing for it, then. We’ll have to head off immediately.”
“When I met Maja, I thought, maybe I can just start over. Wife, maybe kids, a life I never thought I’d have. I moved us out to the farm, outside of Prokuplje, well away from Belgrade, thinking that my past could never catch up with us there.
But only a moment later he heard a low, deep chuckle beside him. He turned back and found himself looking at Holmes in the eye, and they both laughed as the cab sped through the streets of London toward Brixton.
He straightened his back, ignoring the pull of dried blood on his skin, the yank of pain from his wound. He buttoned his jacket, hiding his bloody shirt. He spat on his hands to wet them, and wiped the blood off on his trousers. He lifted his chin, and walked into the street.
They were at the pond, and paused to look at the ducks for a moment. John was surprised at his own emotion on the issue. Were his instincts telling him that Holmes was a significant influence in this era, and that it was important to dissuade him from a habit that might negatively affect that influence? Or did he simply just-
Sherlock grinned as they circled the room again, and watched in the mirror as he repeated his jump. John executed a similar jump, but slightly different, less rigid in its structure from ballet technique, but still soaring and joyous.
“Yes, Glasgow,” John said. This was the last hospital in London. One more morgue in London, then he’d plan the trip to Dublin. “It’s been truly-”
John kissed her on a spot on her head that was not covered in food. “Morning, love,” he said into her hair. “Morning, Sherlock.”
After what felt like a year, the pilot turned his head to Mycroft and said, “Out of Serbian airspace, sir.”
John knelt down, and kissed the tops of Sherlock’s feet. “Beautiful, like the rest of you,” he murmured, then trailed kisses like whispers trailed back up Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock nearly choked, gasping as John took him into his mouth.
Sherlock stopped dead in the doorway, nearly falling over himself with his abrupt halt. Rosie looked up at Sherlock with her adoring grin that never failed to make John smile.
The driver shifted into gear and the car leapt out into the streets. Sherlock looked back to see the guard running fruitlessly after the car.
“Has anyone come from Riding Thorpe Manor?” Holmes asked. His tone was agitated and terse; his patience was clearly wearing out.
I wipe my face, and as quietly as I can, slip past them and out the door. Just as I’m going down the stairs, I look back at them, holding each other tight, swaying slightly.
“This week is the Technical Challenge,” said Mrs Hudson primly, clearly trying to channel her inner Mary Berry. “You haven’t been told in advance what you’re baking, and all the ingredients have been supplied for you.” She nodded at two baskets in the kitchen, covered with tea towels. “There’s also a basic recipe in there, but you are free to improvise within that. Understood?”
Sure enough, about an hour later, Sherlock rushed back into consciousness. Oddly, his only word upon waking was, “
“Hm?” Sherlock pressed his fingerprint on the tablet, confirming his statement, and threw the tablet back towards Lestrade.
Maja laughed, sharp and bitter. “Of course you don’t understand. I gotta say, Sherlock, that between you and John, I am so tired of being surrounded by idiots.”
Now, Sherlock says, “Yes, yes,” waving us off. “This experiment is at a precarious moment; I’ll see you shortly.”
Sherlock tensed as he cursed himself. How could he have assumed that Pavlović and the Serbian government would just let him walk away? He had made an assumption, and that assumption had allowed him to let his guard down. He mustn’t let his guard down until he was home, in his own flat.
She walked unhurriedly to the door, leaving Sherlock standing in shock in the middle of the room. As she opened the door, Sherlock caught a glimpse of John’s face. He was pale, his forehead creased, his eyes wide and worried. Sherlock could tell that John had heard every word.
“Simple observation, Dr. Watson. Immediately after tea you set yourself assiduously to work on your journal, no doubt planning your visits to other hospitals in accordance with your mission. As time went by, however, you spent less time writing, and more time alternating between staring into space and quick glances in my direction. I could understand the looks at me if I were doing something unusual – as I can often do, Doctor, you are hereby warned – but at the moment I am doing nothing but reading quietly. The evidence is there: your mind had wandered back to yesterday’s meeting and to my observations of you. If I have an axiom in life, it is this: curiosity must be assuaged.  Ask.”
The room was rich with silks and leather, the air delicate with incense and tea. Sherlock sat, and carefully pulled his silk kimono sleeves back to pour the boiling water into the teapot. “Your work has kept you travelling, I see, Commissioner. You’ve been to Ariel and Meridian, just within the last three months?”
Sherlock badly wanted the taste of John’s come in his mouth, and he wriggled his tongue against the underside of John’s cock. John gasped, and grunted, and Sherlock felt the first spatters of his release rushing into his mouth. He worked his own cock harder, feeling his balls draw up in anticipation of his own orgasm. As the climax struck, his mouth opened in reflex, and he came at John’s feet with John’s hand in his hair and his cock softening against his lips.
Picking the lock was only a matter of moments, and he pulled open the doors to reveal a dusty, ancient Land Rover. His heart began to beat faster at the possibility of success as he jumped into the driver’s seat. It had been a long time since he’d jump started a car, but the vehicle was old enough that he was sure there wasn’t a security system. He leaned over to rip the casing from the steering wheel when he heard a jangle of keys.
He gently pressed the champagne back at her. “I’ll be there in a moment, darling,” he murmured. “Give me a minute – I’m gasping for a cigarette.”
Standing, Sherlock placed his cup on the tray and crossed to the Admiral. The Admiral did not resist or look up as Sherlock gently pulled the empty cup from his hands. Sherlock took the Admiral’s hand, still warm from the tea, and pulled him to his feet, guiding him to sit on the divan. Sherlock sat next to him; the Admiral stared at the floor.
Sherlock repeated the gesture after each piece, and John decided against applauding for the time being. After about an hour, Sherlock put down the violin with a sigh, and turned to see John.
They camped at Whitehall for three days. During that time they saw no movement, heard no sound of life.
“Me too,” Sherlock said. “I was actually thinking about talking to Mrs. Hudson about delaying my next tour – perhaps indefinitely. Not too keen on long flights anymore, to be honest.”
Rosie looked between Sherlock and John, and nodded, the lure of the blocks stronger than her anxiety. John set her down and said, “Don’t worry, we’ll be right back.”
Mrs. Roshni bustled in, and John, Keith, and the other participants took their places. “All right everyone? Charcoal ready? Now. Remember to check your perspective, don’t worry about perfection at this session, just rough in your model. Watch for shadow and light. It’s all about the lines and the negative space. Any questions? Right, let’s get on. Amy?”
Lestrade rolled his eyes; John wondered if he had picked that habit up from Sherlock. “S’not a goldfish, Sherlock, as has been explained to me a couple of times already. It’s tropical, and terribly expensive, and the aquarium manager has been down my shirt about it since I got here.”
She put a cup of tea into Sherlock’s hand, and glared at him until he drank it. Then she patted his shoulder and left.
“Serbia is a member of the United Nations now,” Sherlock said with some heat. “You cannot prevent me from contacting my embassy, or my family.”
Sherlock attempts to establish a routine for Rosie in their new, challenging conditions; and they meet a potential ally.
She didn’t give him the chance to respond, but turned and left. From the corner of her eye she saw him follow, then he matched her swift pace at her side.
Holmes’s body posture seemed casual and uncaring, but John could see a gleam in his eye. “I’m afraid I do not, Inspector Martin,” he said. “Firstly, may I draw your attention to the bullet hole in the window frame, here?”
Sherlock blinked and focused on Rosie’s grinning face, inches from his. Despite being groggy from sleep, he smiled back.
John laid down the printout of the recipe he’d found online for an easy, ‘beginners’ bread and pushed up his sleeves. Sherlock folded up his sleeves with mathematical precision, then pulled out his phone, tapped for a few minutes, then stared at the screen for a long moment.
Jerome was getting increasingly tense. John didn’t envy him at all; he had taken a calculated risk in calling them in before the police, but if Sherlock and John didn’t solve this soon, he would have to call the police in, who would no doubt be displeased about the delay and a trail that was getting colder and colder.
“He has a watch, very proud of it, won it at a card game during the war. He thinks it’s a knock off. It isn’t.”
Sherlock snagged champagne for the Commissioner and himself, and surveyed the room. The dance floor was already rustling with ball gowns and uniforms. “Do you like to dance, Commissioner?”
“Pretty dress,” John said softly. “May I?” He fiddled with the folds of her dress, revealing the stained spot, streaked through with drying violet liquid. “Not to worry, I’m sure it will come out.”
, Sherlock thought, and distracted himself by reviewing their escape plan in his head. He wondered if John was doing the same, using his training to anticipate any possible flaw in the plan.
Sherlock walked around the room, his eye skittering over books he had only heard about or read on a screenreader. He stopped at a small table with a chess board on it, and chairs on either side.
“All right, that’s enough now, Sherlock,” Maja said. “Very good try, though, I must admit. Never thought you’d get this far, especially once I’d winged you. But that’s enough.”
One day, he had found some sheet music and his hands were itching for his violin (lost, crushed beneath the rubble of Baker Street), when he heard John calling him. He turned in time to see John come running around the corner, nearly falling over in his haste. At first Sherlock thought something was terribly wrong, with Rosie or someone else, but then he saw the grin on John’s face and the light in his eyes.
John shifted in his chair. “I can’t quite put my finger on it. But yeah. Like I’m missing something. I don’t understand it.”
Jim placed his teacup back on the tray. “I’ve had Companions before, of course. Very talented, very capable. But the satisfaction was only temporary, and merely – pardon me for being crude – sexual.”
Holmes nodded sharply and said, “Thank you,” and then “Inspector Martin.” The two men went over to the window frame to examine the bullet hole more carefully. John saw the women blink in confusion, not realizing that they had been dismissed. Once again, John saw that it was his turn to use his Victorian etiquette skills.
“I will take you to your rooms, and bring your luggage later,” the driver said. They were the first words he had said to them. “Come.”
“Divan. It’s a piece based on a design from Earth-That-Was.” Sherlock’s lip curled, his eyes darkened. “Come sit here with me,” he murmured. “It’s terribly comfortable.”
I find myself saying all this out loud, to my embarrassment. He laughs. In a nice way. That’s good too. He looks at his watch and tells me he’s got nowhere to be, could he take me out for a drink?
“Pleasure,” Sherlock said. John wondered how often Sherlock had had to tilt his head up to look someone in the eyes, as John was accustomed to doing every day.
“Please don’t be disturbed,” Pavlović said. “Your friend – Martha Hudson, is it? – was unharmed. Quite shaken, of course, but unharmed. She’s on her way home now.”
“So we went downstairs, and went into the parlour, and there lay Mr. Cubitt, stretched out on the floor, and Mrs. Cubitt was huddled up by the window there, and she was moaning so I knew she was alive. I told Brigit to go see to Mrs. Cubitt, and I took the candle there and looked at Mr. Cubitt, and I saw that he was quite past the help of God or man.”
“I started building this place even before I arrived on Persephone. I knew I wanted a skyhome, so I could be alone when I chose, and be social when I chose. But once I arrived, I started designing the interior to suit me, to suit my interests.” He stopped in front of a door. “This isn’t complete yet, but I’m hoping…”
“There are no cameras now,” he hissed. “No microphones. No guards, no one watching every move we make, watching for a mistake. We are
John stared up at Sherlock. His jaw tightened involuntarily, and he took a moment to breathe, breathe, breathe. “Why?” he managed at last.
“I’m finished anyway.” Sherlock picked up the admittedly smooth, round dough and dropped it into a bowl, covering it with cling wrap and walking out of the room before John had a chance to retort. John kept kneading for several more minutes, out of pique. He didn’t like the idea of going up to his room while he waited for it to rise; not with Sherlock’s room just across the hall. So after setting his dough aside to prove, he spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to wash off his hands and forearms, then fiddling with his phone as he watched the minutes tick by.
It was perfect. Sherlock’s own cock was bobbing against his belly, and he reached down to stroke it, relieve the pressure. His whole body was awake with pleasure, sparking electric shocks up and down the surface of his skin.
I try not to think about him. Sometimes I succeed, for whole minutes at a time. Last week, I think there was an hour in there. Mind you, I was tallying up the taxes for the café, but a
He pressed his lips together, information and deductions running through his head like wildfire. Men wearing hats inside, but not their coats - their appraising glances at the trio as they entered - soft conversations in Serb - screens and headphones.  It all meant one thing: guards. Surveillance. Constant surveillance.
Sherlock found himself smiling. For just a moment, he could pretend none of this had happened. He could ignore the scruff of his beard that itched; he could pretend his clothes weren’t stiff with dust and grime. He could imagine that he and Rosie had just taken a walk to the park, and they would return to cocoa and biscuits with John and Mrs Hudson.
The second day was filled with a surreal sense of déjà vu. It passed much as the afternoon of the first day had passed, with Sherlock trying valiantly to keep Rosie sufficiently entertained, distracting her from the circumstances of being in a locked room with no windows.
There was a scratching and a click from the door downstairs, and the mood broke. “He’s here,” Holmes whispered. “Hide yourself, Watson, and gun at the ready.”
?’ –  but the man didn’t blink, and merely returned the handshake with a jovial smile. His hands were small but strong, and weathered with hard work. “John Watson.”
He ran as fast as he could, keeping to the darker side of the street. His ballet shoes helped him to run quietly, but he could feel every rock and stone underneath. He could hear no footfalls behind him but surmised that Maja was looking for her gun first. She clearly knew the streets and alleys of Belgrade extremely well, so losing her that way was unlikely.
He was in a bedroom, not a hospital room. He was not dressed in a hospital gown but in clothes that were not his own, loose jogging pants and a t-shirt. The bed was low and lumpy, and he was covered with a hand-crocheted blanket. The walls had a few pictures in cheap frames, some photos, some paintings done by children with ‘
After the kiss wound down, John tilted his forehead against Sherlock’s, and laughed gently. “Well,” he said.
Hitting the water hurt considerably more than Sherlock had anticipated. He had been able to twist his body around so he hit the water feet first rather than flat out – if he had landed like that, he was sure he would break several bones. As it was, the impact was not as bad as it could have been, but it still hurt. He shot beneath the surface of the water in a cluster of bubbles. For a moment he was disoriented, not sure which was the way to the surface. Then he saw the bubbles rising, and followed them.
he said, pitching his voice low. Again, the flick of an eye to him, and back to the board. “I believe at this point there are only three possible moves you could make. One will result in a checkmate for me in four moves, one in only two moves – and one would save your king and possibly win the game in time. But if you lose, you’ll have to take off your last article of clothing, and if I lose, I’ll have to remove mine. And then we’d have to decide upon penalties, won’t we?”
Sherlock was indeed bruised, his face obscured by both the oxygen mask and the purpling tone of his skin. His eyes were shut, but his fingers and legs moved restlessly across the sheets, and his head moved slowly from side to side, as though he was shaking his head ‘no’. Through the mask, Sherlock’s deep voice resonated in regular bursts.
When the food was gone, he sat back in his chair, holding Rosie in his lap. The reality of the situation was beginning to sink through his aching brain: this was a safe place. There was food. There was shelter, and it wasn’t as cold as outside. Rosie was safe here. She could be cared for as a baby should be. He closed his eyes.
Then the next day. And the next. All blending into each other like a terrible nightmare of banality.
“Best I can hope for. Without this job, I woulda had to get something I had to pedal.” John nodded towards the room. “I think that fella’s looking for you. Client?”
Separating in the shower room had been torture, leaving the brittle cocoon of safety they had created, back into the dangers of the world outside. Sherlock had kept his hands on John for as long as he could, and John’s own hands seemed equally reluctant to pull away.
Café’s going well, at least. Keeps me busy. Joe shows up first on Chatty Tuesday, last to leave. Talks constantly. He could have taught John and Sherlock a lesson.
John’s head jerked up, staring at the man’s face. It was a field of wrinkles, and white wispy hair, but there was something about the nose…
The woman was elegant and poised but Sherlock could see the edge of nervousness around her, heard her tiny shudder of breath as he kissed her cheek.
“And that’s not including the little parkettes that are sometimes on corners,” Jerome said when John called him for an update. “Some of them are only twenty square feet, just big enough for a bench and some flowers.” He must have heard John’s squawk of despair, as he gave a rueful laugh. “Doesn’t London have a lot of green spaces as well?”
He was momentarily surprised that the room had been reorganized, with easels arranged in a circle around a small dais. Then he remembered that the first life drawing class, the first with a live model, was tonight.
Apparently John had jumped the gun with his drawing of Rosie, as the teacher wanted to work her students up to portrait drawing. The week after the facial structure lesson, Mrs. Roshni tasked her students to first attempt a sketch from a photograph.
Surely I deserve a little break, right? It’s been months now. Months where I’ve trained myself not to think about him, at least not quite as much. I try not to think of his arms (his arms!) and his neck (his beautiful neck!) How his arms looked when they were around me, how the back of his neck looked when he was sleeping in my bed.
He walked into a storm of excited babbling and noise. As the net lifted, he saw that the lab was filled with people, at least twenty, all chatting and murmuring to each other.
The two policemen obeyed, though not quickly enough for Holmes. John couldn’t miss Holmes’ eyes rolling like an impatient horse at the start line. “Fetch my valise from my room, if you wouldn’t mind, Watson? It’s on top of my wardrobe, the one with the buckle.”
“I do, sir, and give it to you gladly,” Cubitt said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. It was clear from the paper’s crumpled appearance that it had been in Cubitt’s pocket, near his heart, for some time.
After far too long, the last nail clattered to the ground and John threw the lid aside. Sherlock rose up out of the coffin and straight into John’s arms; John held him tight, whispering “Jesus Christ – it’s all right now – holy fuck – you’re okay, you’re okay.”
He had a blinding, constant headache that attempted to dull his senses, but he refused to allow it. Rosie must be protected. His motivations narrowed down to food, water, and shelter, and the sensation of Rosie in his arms, her fingers gripping his clothes.
Sweat was pearled across John’s forehead and upper lip, and the back of his vest was dark with sweat. John’s jaw was set with what seemed like anger, but there was release and joy in his face as well. His whole body expressed both rage and happiness at being able to voice himself fully, even if he was alone and far from his birthplace.
Sometimes the doctor would come in and check John’s pulse, check the IV tube, replace one of the bags hanging above him. She was silent as she worked, and when she was done, she would nod at Sherlock and leave quietly.
This was one of Sherlock’s signature pieces. It was short, only seven minutes and thirteen seconds if the conductor was doing it correctly, but allowed him to show off his best qualities as a dancer – his physique, his flexibility, his jumps, his physical strength, his acting. It could be performed on any stage, with a minimal set, and the themes were universal – passion, anguish, unrequited love, pain, desperation, death. All the great male dancers had performed it – Nureyev, Baryshnikov – and when Sherlock first danced it, his reputation and place with that elite group was established.
They held onto each other, wordless, until the aftershocks released them. Then John held onto Sherlock until his arms went loose and lax, and John knew he was asleep. Even in sleep, Sherlock was smiling faintly, and John knew he was whole.
He hardly noticed her helping him out of his clothes. Puffs of dust curled up from them as they fell to the floor. “That’s it, dear, you’ll feel ever so much better,” Mrs. Hudson murmured. “In you get, now.”
Holmes was right; John knew because he had seen such swords before, he had held them in his hand. He had been at Cape Fear River, on board Rhett’s flagship,
“There’s only microphones in the bathrooms, no cameras,” John murmured. “I checked. And the water will drown out any sound. Listen carefully.” John stared at Sherlock, his eyes steady and sharp, and Sherlock felt his initial shock ebb away, leaving only confusion.
“For now, yes.” John eased the boot off, revealing a silk sock over a long, elegant foot. He stroked Sherlock’s foot, smiling at the intake of breath he heard above him, then turned to the other foot.
“Oh no you didn’t,” John snarled. Without hesitation or thought, he reached through the nunchuk’s radius, earning a hard whack on his wrist. Ignoring the sharp pain, he grabbed the intruder’s forearm and jerked back and then down. With his other hand he twisted the nunchuk free. He threw it blindly behind him, and a
They arrived back at Nathan Garrideb’s rooms just after ten o’clock, and were let in by his landlady, whose name turned out to be Smyth.
When Mum died, I wondered what would happen with all the love I had for her. Boo offered to take it, but then she died too. Then I tried to love him, and he loved me, but it couldn’t go anywhere. There was so much love bouncing around inside me, lost.
Sherlock’s head was filled with a clanging heartbeat he knew was his own, but it was as far away and irrelevant as the planets right now. All he could see was the glint of the gun in Maja’s hand, and her smirk behind it.
Back in the dressing room, he tossed the bottle of champagne out of the ice bucket and stuck his feet in. The cold was agony and a relief at once.
“I’ve been in every shop in Soho, and looked everywhere, and I can’t find anything that’s… it needs to be perfect, you see. In the past, I didn’t care, about Christmas, or presents, but now – it has all this
One day, John came in with coffees for each of them, and placed Sherlock’s (black, with an absurd amount of sugar) by his elbow.
“I can and I will. This is a skyhome, stupid. There’s no way to leave without an airtaxi, which of course would not be allowed anywhere near without my express permission. Every door and vidderscreen needs fingerprint ident to get access, and you won’t get that. And I’ve got security all over – you thought they were just servants, butlers? Nope. Highly trained former New Alliance soldiers. If they find you near a door or a vidder, they have my permission to hog-tie you.”
He took Sherlock’s hand from its place in the air and placed it on his waist, then renewed his efforts on Sherlock’s neck. “I must make you forget about guns, and war, and crime, and everything else except this bed, and how I want to make you feel.”
The Commissioner chuckled. “I’m tone-deaf, my dear Sherlock, and couldn’t dance if you fired a gun at my feet.” He turned to Sherlock, his gaze warm and slightly aroused. “You can dance it, though?”
Jim nodded over the steam of the tea. “I have been doing the same – re-evaluating – though without the trauma of an event such as the bombing. How is the tea?” Jim took a sip, smiling into the cup.
Sherlock never quite remembered, later, if the man did turn out to be Delia’s husband. He was vaguely aware of Penny chattering excitedly about Sherlock’s ‘extraordinary talent’ and setting up a system to reunite people through his deductions, when John, brilliant John, said, “We can work out the details later, Penny. Would you excuse us?”
Sherlock straightens his spine, looks down at John. His voice comes out calm. “It doesn’t matter anyway.”
Sherlock gave a little strangled cry, and jerked back. John startled, wondering if he had gone too far, but then Sherlock said, “My collar – choking me-”
Sherlock laid his hands over John’s, guiding them down to his knees. “One of the benefits of fucking a ballet dancer, John,” he said, “is that we are very, very flexible.”
“If you’re worried about the morgue study, I’m sure Dunworthy will talk to the funder.” Bahdri’s tone gentled a bit. “I know you don’t like leaving a job unfinished, John.”
“Listen to me, Sherlock,” John said, and his voice was steady again. “It’s Wednesday. Your sham performance is on Friday, right? We’ll get out Thursday, Thursday night. The rope should be ready by then.”
He suddenly looks twelve years old, like he just got called out by his mum. He speaks quietly, all his confidence out the window. “I wanted to make sure – that you’re all right. That you’re good for John. He’s been hurt before and I – I owe him and – I don’t want him to get hurt.”
“Whatever you like,” Sherlock said. “But - would you – you could tell Mrs. Hudson the truth. Tell her I’m alive. I – I wouldn’t want her to mourn. She’ll keep the secret, don’t worry.”
John slid open the doors to the lounge, to the cheers of their audience of friends. Then he turned back to Sherlock and lifted his side of the tray, and together they carried the croquembouche into the lounge.
“What about the detectin’? You told me how it started, but was that something you had wanted to do? Played games about it when you were a kid?”
“I mean, I’ll consider it. His early films were an inspiration to me, although his more recent work has become more pedestrian.”
Two, Sherlock would not wait and go to France. John had no idea how he could track him down. Sherlock hadn’t mentioned his brother’s name, and anyway he had said that the estate belonged to his mother’s family, and he didn’t know her family name.
he thought, and smiled to himself: Dunworthy had been through the London blitz and the Black Death, and he was all right. Should be fine, John told himself. Just saving on the rent, just as Dunworthy told me to.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he heard Anderson shuffle papers. Such a simple question, any half-intelligent investigator should know the answer immediately - it was key to the case.
meant something different to Sherlock – different from before. Those two words produced a jumble of mixed feelings in Sherlock’s gut – longing to go back to London, sick that he would not be going with John. He wondered if John would bring Maja to England, or whether they would stay in eastern Europe. He wondered which would be worse.
John was quiet the next day – at least, he didn’t speak. He made a lot of noise slamming down coffee cups and dishes, and his glares at Sherlock spoke volumes, but he said nothing. Sherlock was silent as well, but tried to act suitably cowed. He stayed quiet when the driver arrived at 9:00am sharp, and John grabbed his bag and cane before huffing out the door ahead of Sherlock. Sherlock shouldered his own bag and followed, his head down.
“Of course,” John said. He smiled up at Sherlock, small but bright. “Of course I would come. If you needed me, I’d – of course.”
In the morning, they gathered enough small rocks to create a small circle about a foot in diameter, with a larger rock in the centre. It was an old trail signal that he and Mycroft had used as children, tracking through the estate in Sussex. It meant ‘I have gone home’.
“And the music!” Janina said. She jabbed at the remote several times, and Sherlock could hear the song coming through the television, tinny and thin but loud. “Modern music! This isn’t YouTube, Sherlock! Trying to be Polunin after all, are you?”
“I can tell. But let me inform you,” Sherlock blew against the dampness and watched with satisfaction as the nipple gathered and peaked, “that I have been professionally trained, and I know a thousand ways to pleasure a man.”
John’s penis was rock hard, the tip scraping along the roof of his mouth, the width of it filling him. Sherlock’s hands moved up John’s shivering legs to grasp his hips, his thumbs stroking the points of his hip bones. He moaned softly; it was so good, so right, to hold John in his mouth, in his arms. He wanted so much to take his time, to torture John with sensation until he was begging for release. That luxury would have to wait for another time. He slid his hands to John’s arse and squeezed while pushing his cock further into his mouth.
He had wracked his memory for any mentions of Sherlock Holmes in Victorian history, and come up empty. He’d have remembered a name like that, certainly.
For those who haven't seen Fleabag, Hillary is her guinea pig which used to belong to her late best friend.
John was fastening the zipper on Rosie’s dress when he heard a familiar thumping from downstairs, which transformed into footsteps racing up the stairs to his room.
“This creates a space on your roster. If you could inform me of your choice by next week that would be… helpful.”
John put his arms around Sherlock, but didn’t pull him too close, not wanting to overwhelm him. “All right?”
A pause, then John sighed. “I’m trying to find a way to say this that doesn’t sound like ‘my wife doesn’t understand me’.”
He let himself down off the platform to the ridge of the roof. Fortunately the weather had been dry for a few days; if there had been rain, the roof would be slippery and dangerous. As it was, it would take all of his concentration to balance as he walked the ridge.
Suitcases are in the upstairs bedroom; he finds the one John brought when he moved in, brings it down into the bedroom, and begins throwing clothes into it. When all John’s socks and pants and jumpers, his checked shirts and khakis and jeans are inside, he closes it and puts it outside the door, on the landing.
“I’m aware that this will be challenging. I trust you to carry it off, though. Please think about it.”
than usual, he made his way down the stairs to pick up the mail from the hall table. When he finally returned to the sitting room, he handed me a note.
“Your boy,” he said, taking the offered seat. “Is he trustworthy? Discreet? I am thinking only of your client.”
But those days of yelling and pacing and agitation were somewhat rare. There were many evenings when we settled without a word, each in our chairs. I imagine an evening like that.
I was speechless for a moment. I could hear Watson’s voice downstairs, joking with Mrs Hudson, her laughing replies. I thought about that first meeting, when I saw John as a beautiful puzzle, a dangerous temptation, an antidote to all that was ailing me.
He had to admit that the evidence was not enough to support his hunch, and that confirming something he wanted to believe was the wrong way to go about things. He’d studied science at uni, and knew that looking for facts that support a hypothesis invited bias. Conclusions are drawn from facts, not the other way around. Hypotheses are formed from observations.
Watson rotated his weak shoulder to loosen it up. “Perhaps next time you should steal the key. You’ve spent days sweet-talking the housemaid. I’m sure you could have lifted the key while she was plying you with cake.”
He gestures at Holmes, who lost his a-shirt during the encore. “What about you? You look like… like…”
Holmes nods and falls silent again. His hands twitch, and Watson wonders if he wants a cigarette. He’s seen the nicotine patches he wears; it’s not just the drug he craves, though. It’s the habit, opening the pack and tapping a cigarette out, lighting it, holding it between his fingers. He has a lot of nervous energy; a cigarette is something to occupy his restless hands.
“Tell me what you think, Doctor,” she says as they reach door of the flat. “There’s another bedroom upstairs if you’ll be needing two.”
She turned to Watson, who was flushed and beginning to perspire. “Mr Watson will be introduced to the Wickhams and their daughter Edith this evening. It might be a stretch, but they are humble enough that having a doctor as a son-in-law will please them. In your case a long engagement would be sensible, allowing you time to build your practice. They are aware that you do not come from money, but by no means should you say that you were raised in poverty. You may tell them that your father was a physician who sent you to the best schools he could afford. In Edinburgh, I think. The culture there is more refined than that of Northumberland. It would be best not to mention your military service; your lack of decorations and distinction will not add anything to your character. Your accent is not a problem, since you have clearly moderated it, but try not to sound uneducated. I assume that Sherlock has taught you how to behave in polished society. A handsome face may go a long ways, but manners will tip the balance.” She scrutinised his face with intent. “The moustache lends you an appearance of more maturity than you possess. You may keep it.”
One quick glance behind me to see that Watson was on my heels, and I pulled out all the stops, ran hell for leather towards the boundary fence.
They stand outside the station, waiting for a cab. Holmes hasn’t spoken since he said he needed to think, and Watson hasn’t interrupted whatever process he’s going through.
That seems like a lot of work. He doesn’t want to talk to Harry when he needs to figure out where he lives. He’ll call her tomorrow, if he remembers.
It’s hard loving someone this way, and it isn’t something he actually chose, but what he feels is so much more now than it was when they met. It has grown to such an extent that he does not flinch from what he has to do to protect John. For this man, he would die.
It was the episode about the Tribbles, those benign, furry little creatures that multiply at an astonishing rate.
. Chiselled Abs lays a hand (attached to a muscular arm) on John’s shoulder, saying something, showing him— and then his other hand is on John’s abs—
means sharing a bed. Sherlock has never wanted to share a bed with anyone, but sometimes, when he looks at John falling asleep in his chair, he wants to take his hand and lead him to bed. They could lie there together and Sherlock wouldn’t even mind if John didn’t want to have sex with him. He would just lie there and watch John breathe, if that was all he could have.
“You are too emotional, John. Milverton is a cold bastard, I grant you. But we will not melt him with sentiment. Go to bed.”
He holds the urn in his hands. It’s not a fancy urn, just the basic one provided by the mortuary. He’s opened it many times and looked at the ashes. Watson’s atoms are there. Nothing is ever wasted in nature; everything turns into something new. How that happens is the miracle, and Death is just part of that cycle.
“Just so I know,” Watson says to him one day— a particularly gruelling day— “Do you care about human lives at all?”
“I see,” he said. “Are we meant to think there is something wrong with two characters in the same television series being gay? I realise that it’s more usual for the gay character to be a token, a comic contrast to the
I wondered. Had she seen through me? Were my little jokes less subtle than I thought? Did she notice something between me and Watson?
The other Rosamund jumped to her feet. “I’ll run down to Speedy’s and see if they’ll give us some. They know my dads.”
Holmes is silent for a long time. He fidgets, no doubt wanting a cigarette to distract him. It makes him uncomfortable, Watson senses, just to be who he is. To have to explain himself to other people, to be categorised, to receive their judgement.
He heard another voice speaking softly, but couldn’t make out the words. Another giggle. “Rich and I are watching one of your old movies.”
Anger surges through him, blinding him momentarily. It serves no purpose, though, and he pushes it down, steadying himself until he can finally speak.
I sat daily at my lessons with him, as Charles and Emma were three and four years older, respectively, and had already learned their first year lessons. As they laboured over geography and multiplication, I sat beside Edwin whilst the new governess, Miss Garvey, attempted to teach him his letters.
How he’d gotten himself talked into Afghanistan was a question best not answered. It had a lot to do with that mob of army dwarves who'd decided he had the proper skillset for their
He will not answer; anger makes him shake. “There are limits to all things, Holmes,” he says at last. “Nature demands it of all, even you and me. One day we will have to pay this debt we have accumulated. Until then, it’s better to humbly accept the gift than to treat it as worthless.”
“For god’s sake, loosen your tie, Mycroft. I’ll not have you expire on my floor. Let me get you some water, at least.”
He pulls off the ugly jumper and unbuttons his shirt. No flying buttons, struggling to get the cuffs undone. John is a careful man. Sherlock watches with amusement as he folds his shirt and jumper and lays them on the chair. He’s wearing an A-shirt, and Sherlock can see part of the scar he’s been imagining.
“Hey, that’s our world. I’ve had some luck, so I can’t complain. Now that my hair has gone grey, at least I get more interesting offers.”
Murray’s saying something. Oh, he has to get back home now, to his wife and precocious baby. He’s asking Watson if he should get him a cab. Well, he’s not that drunk. He smiles and shakes his head. He’ll just sit here a little bit longer, finish his drink. He tells Murray to go home to his family.
love him. I know you don’t do that sort of thing— sentiment and all that— but he changed you. You were happy. I could see it every time you looked at him. And you made him happy as well. I thought he should know, especially since I couldn’t reveal anything else.” She draws a deep breath and slowly lets it out. “You don’t know how badly I wanted to tell him you weren’t dead. I couldn’t see him again because if I did, I might have broken down and said something. I didn’t want to break my promise to you.”
He reappeared in the kitchen holding a thick envelope. Handing it to John, he sat down and began to eat his French toast. “Open it,” he said around a mouthful.
Sherlock shrugs. “I assumed that I was like everyone else, that some day I would meet the right girl, get married, and have children. That was how it was supposed to work, and I thought there was something wrong with me because I didn’t like girls that way. All my fantasies were about boys, but I thought I would eventually be attracted to girls as I got older. That kiss told me I would never love a woman.”
he loves Sherlock, but maybe he is still in love with… what’s her name? John hasn’t even said her name once.
My brother had promised to put up the rent and assist Watson in setting up a practice during my absence, since I anticipated him staying on at 221B Baker Street, but it appeared that no one had lived there for some time. The surfaces were free of dust, but there was no smell of food, no pile of newspapers, no clutter of daily life in the flat.
He looks awkward, like he can’t figure out what to do with his hands. “Mycroft told me there was some trouble over my… body double. And the autopsy.”
When I look up, there he is. It’s a stupid disguise, a drawn-on moustache and a borrowed pair of glasses. Well, that’s just the kind of thing he might improvise, because
Lestrade is looking at his phone, paying no attention to Anderson and Donovan. Though they’re talking quietly, he can hear them making observations and generally being mean. John is standing somewhere behind Sherlock. Maybe he’s tired and wants to go home, but it was his idea to come, so he won’t say anything.
Here’s the thing. I’ve taken two so far, and each time I had one of those dreams, the ones where it feels like I’m awake and Sherlock is there and it’s all real, actually happening. If I had a dozen pills, I would ration them. But I have just one.
But no, it was only 3:37, and he had at least five more patients. He sighed and rang for the next one.
“Langstaff’s an idiot for not leaving Persephone immediately, he got caught, and he’s boring now. What did you do after you left the NAF?”
Holmes was able to flag a hansom cab. After saying “Baker Street,” to the cabbie he fell silent – not looking out the window, nor at John, but straight ahead.
“I have identified the murderer; we will go to encounter him now,” Holmes said. “Ah, thank you, Watson. The cab should be here any moment now.”
ship, and hard work to keep her flyin’, and that’s no life for you. I don’t want to make your life - what did you say, before? - complicated. I can take you to Ariel and you can set up there, you can change your name if you’re worried about that fella-”
“There’s a gang of us up by the old gazebo in the park. Not that the gazebo’s there any more, but we help each other out, like. You should come and join us.”
,” he said to Maja in Serb, hoping that the sound of her own language would calm her somewhat. “We have to move now, over here, let’s go.”
He finally found Dunworthy in the library. Dunworthy flinched when John quietly called his name, but relaxed when he turned and saw John.
He placed his hand on the small of her back and steered her gently towards the tea table. “Come. Sit. We’ve enough time for tea before our hovercar arrives.”
Cubitt was a big, burly man, with a ruddy face that seemed as though his was a mostly happy life, but was presently consumed with trouble. He shook John’s hand with the appropriate pleasantries, and John was once again glad he had studied up on Victorian English etiquette. A squire!
“Not long. Fortunately it’s not hard to guess Lestrade’s code – ah! Got it. Now tell me more about your sister’s allergy. How did they test for it?”
Emboldened after a lesson on facial structure, he waited until Rosie was conked out on her nap, and drew a quick sketch of her. Her cheeks were still baby-chubby, and she occasionally wrinkled her brow in her sleep as though worrying about something. John could see Mary in the shape of Rosie’s ear and the curve of her lip. He wasn’t sure where her curly hair came from; his hair had always been dead straight, as had Mary’s.
“So I’m asking this as both your manager, and as someone who knows you well: What do you want? What are you going to do next? Of course we cancelled the Japan and China tour. And you’ve got the season at the Paris Opera in the fall, but say the word and-”
John rose early the next day to visit the Royal Free Hospital. As he crossed through the lounge, he saw Holmes lying on the divan, curled up with his back to the room. He had clearly been there all night.
John’s teeth were grinding together, his hands tightening into fists. “This is different,” he ground out.
In Dunworthy’s cramped and crowded rooms, John tried to stop his leg from bouncing in suppressed nervousness as Dunworthy poured tea and sat back with a sigh.
Sherlock’s head shot up, his face red with embarrassment or with the pressure of pressing against his knees. “It’s their
Sherlock shrugged. Without thinking, he went to his desk, took a piece of paper and began to fold it. “I went to the Academy when I was twelve. I don’t remember having any strong ideas about what I wanted before that. I think I vaguely assumed I would go to the same school as my brother. I graduated when I was eighteen and have been working ever since.”
Then supper. Then bed. She insisted on ‘kissing Daddy good night’, giving the phone a little buss before saying “night night Daddy, night night Sh’lock” and curling up in the nest of his coat. He blew out the candle before he could look at the phone himself. He stared into the dark for hours into the night, until sheer boredom and lack of data made him lie down and close his eyes.
“I could tell, for instance, that the woman with curly hair, the woman in her picture is her sister, that the sister has two children and is presently expecting twins, that they were estranged in their early twenties but are reconciled now. The older woman with all the pictures of the pug - the dog in the picture is geriatric and has arthritis, and she takes it swimming twice a week for pain relief. You see, John?”
“Artistic director, is he?” John said. The man was nearly halfway up the audience area. “I should probably go have a chat with him.”
“Are you kidding?” Jerome said. “I bring my nephews every summer, it’s always sold out, packed solid.”
“All right,” Sherlock said. He was unnerved by Mycroft’s loss of emotional control, but refused to let his voice waver.
Sherlock’s kisses had gained in confidence, and despite his best efforts to keep things from getting too intense, John found himself getting hard. Sherlock kept pressing them closer and closer together.. He distracted himself by weaving his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, disrupting the neatly combed style. His hair was surprisingly soft, a little slick with pomade. He had thought it was dark brown, but close up he could see auburn highlights.
It was an octopus. Its skin was mottled rust, smooth and silky looking in the water. It moved slowly and gently, rippling as it went. John could imagine a tolerant expression on its face, perhaps faintly amused by all these silly humans near its tank and their silly problems.
Holmes looked up at John, who struggled to sit up. Holmes’ eyes were wild, and didn’t seem to truly see him. John softened his voice. “I’m all right, Holmes, look.”
John was slightly hunched over, as if concentrating completely on his dancing. His hands were clenched into fists, and tension bridged across his shoulders, but below his hips his legs were loose, relaxed, and yet absolutely in control.
He sits back and just looks me up and down. ‘Looks’ isn’t the right word – it’s like I’m a technical manual and he’s memorizing it before he puts the stereo system together.
“Then you went away. I’ve never felt so… hollow in all my life. Therapy didn’t help, drinking didn’t help, the hangovers
Shame welled up in his stomach for the thoughtless person he was five years ago, even a month ago. “I’m sorry. I’m – I’m not-”
Stamford was grinning helplessly at John. “He’s an eccentric, for certain, Dr. Watson, but not mad; despite all appearances.”
Tjinn smiled sadly at him, even as the tears fell down her face. “No, Sherlock. I was with her, and a number of the others here. She died surrounded by people who love her, and she smiled as she slipped away. I promise you.”
As soon as the words ‘The End’ appeared on the screen, Sherlock jumped up. “Bunch of sentimental claptrap,” he snarled, and strode to his room, shutting the door firmly.
Mycroft moved towards the recorder but Mrs. Hudson shook her head. Sherlock was staring at her, incomprehension fogging his brain.
“The police asked me to,” he said. “Apparently I saw something no one else did, and they need my statement.”
dancing. He remembered the flash of pain on John’s face, and saw at once why John didn’t get the chance to dance at home. Maja clearly disapproved, likely teasing John whenever he cleared the carpets from the floor and tried to tap. No wonder he had stopped, no wonder he had now taken the opportunity when he could.
Despite the difficulty of the situation as a whole, it was good to move again. Sherlock could feel his muscles loosening up, letting go of the tension of his recuperation and forced inactivity. It felt like stepping back into his own skin. He began to escalate his movements, pushing to rediscover his body’s limits again.
“My client got me out and to the hospital, but I-” Tjinn paused, and sighed. She turned her face towards the screen and pulled back the curtain of her hair to reveal a long, angry scar down the side of her lovely face.
There are some blokes who learn how to have sex by watching porn, and others who learn by… having sex. Guess which is better? And guess which one John is? He knows that foreplay is not just something for a golf course. His best trick is after making me come two or three times, and then after he’s come, he gets one more orgasm out of me. The first time, all I could do was lie there and say, “Golly,” which I have never, ever said before in my life.
“Victor was everything I was not – athletic, sturdy, funny. Rather than call me odd, or tease me for my fondness for science or for my observations about people – I had started that from a young age – rather, he played with me, creating games of fancy and imagination. We spent nearly every waking hour together.
“I’m fine,” he said shortly. He could feel the burn of his leg muscles now; he needed to stretch out and cool down; he needed to drink water; he needed the noise and clamour outside his dressing room to go away. He closed his eyes.
“Shh.” Sherlock felt the whisper of air, and John’s smile against his neck. “It was worth it, yeah? It was worth it, to know. Okay?”
He allowed his thoughts to touch upon John, careful to keep such thoughts analytical only. If John had survived the initial blast, would he have known to stay underground for the worst of the radiation to pass? John was clever; that was probably what he would do. But how could they possibly find each other now?
John sat obediently; he wasn’t sure if his legs would support him anyway. He was still weak. As Bahdri covered his face with shaving cream, John caught sight of his watch.
“The other English guy? Is he with you?” Bantam said. “I just needed him to stop following me. But I didn’t hurt him, I swear.”
Time passed. It was hard to tell how much time, with no clocks in the room. There was no external window to see the passage of sunlight. All he could see through the tiny window on the door was the peak of the soldier’s hat, which only moved for a few seconds at a time, so he couldn’t even tell when a shift was changing.
“She thought that…” John was about to say and lost his courage. “She thought that it was very good.”
John obeyed, sliding up and kissing Sherlock hard and deep. Sherlock could taste himself in John’s mouth, and he tilted his hips up to meet the pressure of John’s cock against his.
