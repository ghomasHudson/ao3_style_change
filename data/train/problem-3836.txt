“I know,” Cas answers. He shifts in his seat and Dean hears the leather squeak under him. “I’ll think about it.”
“I really don’t know. He’s just... sad and hesitant to talk to me about it. I don’t blame him, I just wish there was something I could do,” Dean says. He fidgets with his beer bottle, mostly empty now, but still damp with condensation. Weakening the paper label with his fingers, he pulls it off in pieces.
“Of course, I wouldn’t let you go alone.”
Swallowing thick, Dean tries to speak, to tell Cas’,
Tears prick at his eyes, physical evidence of the Cas-shaped longing that’s always been present in his heart only growing stronger since Cas’ confession. He thinks about this little two-story cabin Cas created for him, plucked from Dean’s hidden dreams, nearly perfect in every way, save the lack of Cas’ presence. The intimate bedrooms, beds placed neatly next to large windows in view of sunrise for a gentle wake-up call. A clean kitchen with ample space and appliances, similar to the one in the bunker but rustic, homey, a place for Dean to cook to his heart’s content. It's easy to see Cas here next to him, Dean teaching the art of making the perfect pie. Dean thinks about seeing Cas' trench coat and suit jacket discarded, his white sleeves rolled up baring tanned forearms and strong hands. How those hands were so skilled at killing, but able to heal with a touch too.
Cas still has a scrape on his forehead, blood crusting over now, but the color stands out on his skin. Dean itches to wipe it away, to clean him up and take care of Cas how Cas has done so for him so many times before.
Dean steps into the bathroom and Cas follows, getting as close to the mirror as he can get, tilting his head to the side and squinting. Cas drags his fingertips over the decorative wood edges, then pulls back.
“It does, and... uh, we’re gonna have to share the bed. They only had one left,” Dean says.
The door to the room whips open. The djinn is unlike any Dean has ever seen before. Barely human and old, skin wrinkled and thin, like a walking skeleton joined the Blue Man Group. Dean barely has time to stagger to his feet before the djinn is on him, glowing hand outstretched, reaching for Dean, chapped mouth curved up into a sardonic smile. With a jolt of his knee to the djinn’s stomach, Dean pushes the djinn off of him and rolls up to his knees. The djinn cries out, landing on it’s back near the door, but recovers quickly, rushing forward to try and tackle Dean. He sees the move coming and throws a shoulder out, standing to his feet with the momentum and shoving the djinn out the door and into the hallway.
A skinny teenager is working the desk, chewing on a granola bar and bobbing his head to some peppy music blasting from his earphones. Dean taps the desk once and the kid startles to attention, fumbling with his phone to get it to pause.
“Yeah, but that wasn’t even something bad, she just wasn’t ready to come out.”
He slips Led Zeppelin self-titled into the player, smiling when he hears the familiar click and whir noise of it starting to spin, and the first guitar strums drift out. Miracle bounds in from the other room at the sound of the music, jumping up on his thigh, and rubbing her head against his hand. Dean gives her a quick squeeze and kneels down next to the record collection, eager to re-organize them and add a few more he never got the chance to purchase back on Earth.
They make out like this, Dean straddling Cas on the bed in the dim light, hands exploring each other, trading slow kisses. More than anything, Cas wants to freeze this moment and stay here with Dean like this, forget about Chuck and about the rest of the world. Nothing exists except for Dean’s body warm against his, the quiet whines leaving his throat while they kiss, and the wet slide of their lips together.
Castiel yearns to touch him, to stroke his fingers through Dean’s hair, trace the line of his jaw, over the dusting of freckles on his cheeks. Lust, foreign of a feeling, burdened with the weight of all Dean means to him. It’s not only carnal desire Castiel wants, if it were, this would be easier.
After eating, Cas disappears. Dean isn’t too sure where he went, when Cas wants to think or is dealing with something, which he is, he normally heads down to the library. Dean feels clingy, still worried about Cas after what happened with the Djinn, but whatever Cas saw it must have fucked him up. He’s been alright since then, but there’s an air of sadness about him, like he’s trapped in a daydream most of the time. Dean tries to reach him, but can’t seem to get past whatever barrier Cas put up to protect himself.
Dean seems frozen in place. His mouth is parted, eyes wide, and his cheeks flushed. Awkwardly, he gestures to the door with his hands. “I’m... uh... gonna go take my bag to the car and I’ll be back.” He fumbles with his words and his cheeks grow redder somehow.
“Not really,” Cas answers, flat, almost monotone.
“Good. Want a beer while you create
On the third day of his new life in Heaven, Dean starts to work on settling into his home. It’s mostly set with basic furnishings, Cas made sure of that, but there are small things Dean needs in order to make it just right.
With so much of Dean’s skin bared before him, Cas has the urge to taste, and so he arches down, tongue tracing a line down Dean’s chest until he reaches one of Dean’s nipples. Flicking his tongue over the nub, he sucks it into his mouth until it hardens against his tongue. Dean’s hands slide up into his hair, tugging, and he whines, hips rolling. Cas can feel Dean’s cock hard even inside his pants, and it sparks something inside him,  sending bursts of electricity down his spine. He needs more, wants Dean in any way he can have him.
“Is this your own recipe?” Cas asks. He watches as Dean finishes cutting up the onions, the methodical process, how he carefully slides them across the cutting board into the pot for the chili.
Dean shrugs, taking a small sip of his coffee. “Yeah, I should.” He looks up at Mary, finds her open and attentive. This shouldn’t be scary, he knows that his Mom will love him no matter what, yet the prospect of telling her about everything with Cas seems more daunting than he imagined. He takes a deep breath and starts talking.
“What is this place?” Dean asks.
Cas slips the ring back onto his finger and looks around the room for some sort of indication. It’s a small room but neatly decorated, a wide dresser a few feet from the base of the bed with a few framed pictures arranged on top. There’s one of Sam and Eileen, facing each other and holding hands, matching lovesick smiles on their faces. Eileen is wearing a white dress, simple and lacy, a cupped sleeve falling off one shoulder. Sam’s wearing a tux, clean and black with a stark red tie.
“Don’t feel bad, Cas,” Dean says, reaching over to squeeze Cas’ shoulder with his palm. He drops it seconds later, much to Cas’ dismay. “It’s just little things, never really noticed how much I’d grown used to them until they weren’t there. How do you make birds?”
long ago, but I was waiting you know for shit to get better but it never did and it kept getting worse. There never seemed to be a time when things were okay and I’m tired of living for the future. And I know I don’t deserve you right now, after everything, but I love you and I want you in whatever way you’ll have me
“Hey, Cas,” Dean starts, finding his words, not quite sure how to say what he wants. “I know you’re busy revamping Heaven or whatever. And you’re doing a great job by the way, I just...”
“Cas I--” Dean reaches over and finds Cas’ open palm on the seat waiting for him. He tangles his fingers between Cas’ and holds on tight, letting the warmth of Cas’ hand in his give him strength.
Miracle huffs a sigh and settles her head right over his heart, content to sleep right there.
Cas isn’t sure he can, he’s also preoccupied with how good it feels to have Dean’s hands on him that he can’t think correctly. “I may need help.”
“But... you didn’t stay?” Dean asks, after a moment, voice quiet and confused.
Dean’s blush deepens and he breaks eye contact, dropping his gaze and scuffing his boot against the grass. “Yeah? Yeah, okay. Good.”
Dean seems content, but Cas often wonders if he
Moments later, a sense of peace fills Dean’s soul. Exuberant, a taste of freedom, of what Heaven should be. Dean feels light for the first time in years, maybe ever, like he’s a little kid again and that he can have anything he wants if he only reaches out to take it.
“Oh?” Cas says, arching an eyebrow.
Dean never told her, not the first day in heaven. Everything with his own death had seemed too fresh and he’d been overwhelmed with the enormity of what this new version of eternity meant for him. Dean rubs his thumb over the rim of the mug, trying to figure out the words for how to explain
Dean nods as a feeling of peace washes over him. Acceptance is what he wanted and now that he has it, all that’s left is the ache of needing Cas. He feels half-whole like there’s a Cas-shaped bullet-wound strewn through the essence of his soul. A weeping wound, left untended that keeps bleeding no matter how he tries to aid it.
Chuck is gone, off to another one of his universes. And they’re back to square one.
Cas doesn’t say much as Dean shows him around, pausing to explain each of the decorations he’s hand-picked from his memories to place here — the pictures hung sporadically throughout the house, the record player, specific appliances so Dean can create different dishes, and the placement of his bed next to the window, optimal for being woken up by the sun.
“You didn’t sing very loudly and off-key in the shower, you said my name differently, your burgers didn’t taste as good.”
“Nah,” Dean laughs. “I think he wants to be at base camp, keep track of anything Chuck related. Plus, he mentioned Eileen might be coming back soon. I think that might be part of it.”
Dean kisses him properly then, gentle, a wet slide of their lips together that has Cas craving more when Dean pulls back.
The look of fondness on Cas’ face is unparalleled. Dean basks in the feeling of unadulterated love it evokes in him. Briefly, Dean entertains the thought of telling him right then, saying his own confession. But then he remembers Cas still has work to do, Cas has a purpose now, a purpose
“Fuck,” Dean whines, head bent, mouth open on the side of Cas’ jaw.
“Fine. Hurts a bit but I’ve had worse.”
Work. He works a normal job, not hunting. What kind of world is this?
“Let me,” Cas states. Breaking Verna’s connection with Dean took a lot out of him, but a little grace has replenished, enough that he can take care of their mess. He closes his eyes, concentrating, and sends a burst of grace through Dean’s arm, making sure it cycles through both of them before pulling back. Sure enough, they’re clean.
“Cas,” Dean says warningly. “You shouldn’t, you’re running low as is.”
Cas sighs, thinking about the implications of sharing a bed with Dean for the second night in a row. It’s just his luck. “Yes, that’ll be fine.”
Leaving the church, Dean drives towards the sunset, pink and crimson spreading like watercolors across the sky. Next to him, Cas is quiet, but Dean can hear him thinking in the heaviness of the air between them. Licking his lips to find his words, Dean finds he can still taste the sweetness of Cas’ mouth on his lips.
“Free, Cas. I feel free.” His hand finds Cas’ where it rests on his hip and he slots their fingers together. “How do you feel?”
blackberry pie!” Dean turns toward the house, motioning for Cas to follow him. Miracle follows too, trying to wind between his legs and it takes a lot of effort for Dean to not trip over her.
“Yeah, I know... I just...” Dean trails off. He sucks in a shaky breath and gathers all of his courage. “There’s something I gotta tell you.”
ice cream, especially on pie, it’s one of his favorite things. He’d have it for every meal if Mommy would let him.
How much poison did the djinn have to get into him to incapacitate an angel?
He realizes he’d been staring down the hallway where Cas went off to, so he turns back around to Sam. “I don’t know, man. He’s acting funky and he doesn’t wanna talk about it.”
Dean is searching for, but he lets him look, basks in the warmth Dean’s eyes on him evokes.
Well, fuck. Dean sighs, darts a glance at the clock hanging on the wall -- it’s pushing midnight. Cas won’t mind sharing, but Dean sure does, if only because having Cas so close to him and in bed with him will do a number on his heart rate.
“Cas? Hey, buddy, you gotta wake up. C’mon.” Dean takes Cas’ face between his palms, patting his cheeks, trying to force him awake.
and a bright red kiss emoji off to the side. He’s wearing a black t-shirt and jeans underneath. Dean has a few aprons hanging from the pantry door for use, but Cas has noticed Dean tends to wear this one the most. He looks adorable in it, unfortunately for Cas, only increasing the amount Cas does want to kiss him. Many fantasies of Cas’ have involved Dean in this very kitchen of theirs, kissing Dean up against any available surface until he’s breathless and handsy, desperate for Cas in any way he can have him.
“You’ll find out one day, baby. No one will need to tell you, you’ll just know.”
As the sun starts to dip lower in the horizon, the day coming to an end, Dean checks in with him -- shielding Cas briefly from the sun with his body and grinning down at him.
He goes to her and hugs tight, clinging to the fabric of her green paisley shirt. “Hi Mom.”
Dean quirks an eyebrow and fights back a laugh. He picks at the hole in the vinyl of the booth next to his thigh, watching Cas’ slow reaction and then, sudden understanding. But he only squints at the menu, suddenly very interested in reading all the items. “Uhm..” he falters, briefly glancing up at Addie and then quickly looking back down again when he notices the slight blush on her cheeks. “I’ll have the same as him.”
“Didn’t you help create it?” Dean asks, mouth twitching in amusement.
“It wasn’t real.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees Cas’ mouth quirk up. “I told you, I heard your prayer Dean, we’re good.”
“I’ve never loved anyone like this. Never. You’re my best friend and that should be enough, but I look at you and deep in my chest there’s this ache that no matter who I fuck, no matter how mad at you I get, how hard I try to push you away sometimes, it never goes away. And I want this,” Dean says, gesturing back and forth between them. “If you’ll have me.” He looks up at Cas, eyes sparkling with hope, a small smile playing on his lips.
“I know,” Dean says. “Here.” He hands Cas the burger and ICEE as Cas’ eyes light up like a little kid on Christmas.
hear him, and now Dean is stripped raw from the unacknowledged between them.
“Well, what else do you think is missing?”
Cas blinks at him, an unreadable expression passing over his face before he sighs, sitting up a little bit. “That’s alright.”
Dean waves a little goodbye over his shoulder as he heads out the door. Cas can hear the sound of his boots padding across the hardwood floor, keys jingling in his hand and the door slamming shut. He doesn’t move until after he hears the tell-tale sound of the Impala revving to life and peeling out of their driveway.
“Uh, well I was finishing up getting the house ready, but I wanted to try to bake my first Heaven pie.”
During an incredibly intense moment of the song Dean turns to Cas, points at him and yells the lyrics, then dissolves into laughter as the guitar solo hits. Cas laughs along with him, feeling giddy, and for a moment like they’re the only two people in the universe.
Almost.
“Come back to me,” Cas says. He grabs Dean’s bicep, covering the spot where the mark of his handprint used to be. Focusing his energy on his limited grace, he forces as much of it as he can muster directly into Dean’s arm, rejoining their connection. A rush of electricity flows back through him, zinging through his body, lighting up Dean’s arm with a neon blue handprint.
“What happened?” Cas asks.
Unspoken words build on his tongue, taking shape and crowding his mouth, threatening to burst free.
miss him -- but for the things he missed having to grow up too soon.
He finds Dean staring back at him in awe, eyes wide and sparkling in the sun. “That’s amazing, Cas.”
More likely than not, Dean would have laughed the incident off, attributed it to sleeping in close quarters and Cas’ uncontrollable urges in his vulnerable state.
He drives the knife home, straight through his own heart. Pain sears through his flesh, and he isn’t sure if the scream that follows is his own or Dean’s.
John’s truck is gone when he pulls up to the garage, so he parks right in front. The engine pings and pops as he stares up at the house — his childhood home, a near exact replica. He’s not sure if this was Cas’ doing or if his parents had manifested this themselves, more likely the latter. Makes sense they’d want to rebuild what the fire had taken from them, John especially. It hurts to look at — the white-washed shutters and neat paint — covered in all the memories of normalcy contained within a life that could have been so different that never was. Now, with his newfound peace, Dean doesn’t mourn the life he could have had here. This is his second chance, to live the life he wants free from any earthly expectation placed upon him.
Mary sits across from him, curving her hands around the warm mug and just looks at him for a moment. “How are you? Are you settling in alright?”
Words from earlier bubble up inside him, wanting to burst free. Silence follows and Cas
“I’m glad you kept it,” Dean says, soft. He looks over briefly, smile widening and then revs the engine, spinning the wheel towards the highway.
Cas moves his hand, curving it up so their palms are facing each other, and slips his fingers between Dean’s. “Why?”
“Good morning,” Cas breathes, once Dean pulls back, looking dazed from just a simple kiss.
It seemed like Dean had been startled by seeing Cas shirtless. Probably because it was awkward, something Cas still fails to understand most of the time. He shrugs to himself and gets busy dressing.
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean reaches out and grabs Cas’ shoulder, squeezing tight, and brushes past him on the way to bed.
“Where should I start?” Cas asks.
Miracle wakes him up early just after sunrise when the clouds are still cotton-candy pink in the sky. He makes himself a simple breakfast of eggs and bacon, occasionally feeding Miracle scraps from his plate. She always waits by his side during meals, whining for food and looking up at him with pleading eyes. Sometimes he can’t help but give in.
Dean flashes his badge and out of the corner of his eye sees Cas do the same, right side up this time. He’s a natural. “FBI. Agent Perry and my partner Agent Tyler. Do you have some time to talk to us about Sally? We understand everything is still fresh, but if you’d like to talk to us, we want to try and help figure out what went on here.”
Castiel’s grace soars and lights him up from the inside out. Around him, The Empty burns bright with a white hot light and confused sounds fill the void, awakened beings coming to life in the sudden sun. It’s only a matter of time before The Empty itself shows up, enraged and ready to throw out whoever disturbed its sleep.
“You didn’t have to do that.”
, who has no taste.”
“Thank you, I just need to change and then I’ll be ready,” Cas says.
“Dean needs me,” Cas states. He takes one last sip of his beer, a lingering glance at the stars high above, and stands up, turning to head inside the house.
“Come shower with me?” Dean whispers, right into his ear.
“No,” Dean says after a moment, voice guarded. “But it is if you want it to be.”
“I could make apple
“Well, yes, but I haven’t seen it since you’ve moved in and made it yours.”
Dean leans into Cas’ orbit, breaking him out of his thoughts, and cups Cas’ cheeks in between his palms. He kisses Cas’ forehead and then pulls back to press their foreheads together. “See you at five.”
She sighs, looking rather bored with him, and clacks away on her laptop, long fingernails amplifying the sound. “Sorry sugar, looks like we’ve only got a king left. Busy night tonight, there’s a rodeo in town tomorrow.”
“True. Alright, we’ll check it out and leave in the morning.”
At Dean’s words, Cas looks up towards the crevasse in the ceiling. A look Dean has never seen before passes over Cas’ face and his lips twitch.
In Heaven, Dean can manifest anything he could want with just a simple thought. Not Cas’ presence of course, but any item he can dream up is readily available to him. Back at the Bunker there had been an old record player in the library room, vintage from the early 1900s, decorated in ornate wood with little birds carved into the outside. In between hunts, when he’d get it into his head to cook a large meal for his family or deep clean the kitchen, he’d put on Zeppelin records and let her spin for a few hours, tuning out the rest of the world except for music. He thinks of the record player now, closes his eyes and draws out its image from his memory. When he opens his eyes again the record player is sitting a few feet away in the corner of the living room up against the wall. On the shelves underneath are all of the records he had back at the Bunker stacked neatly and ready for use.
For a moment, Dean forgets about God, about the oncoming end of everything, and there’s nothing but him and Cas and Nebraska.
Miracle paces between them, excited at this new person who has come into Dean’s life. She’s already taken to him, bumping against Cas’ legs and trying to nuzzle his hand.
Dean rotates his hand so their palms join and squeezes back. “You do?”
Dean flashes him a thumbs up over his shoulder and then he’s gone, the door slamming a little too hard behind him, and Cas can’t help but laugh.
“Okay,” Dean concedes. He waits a beat, taps his fingers on the steering wheel, looking ahead at the mirage of neon signaling their arrival to Burns. “Are you hungry? I was planning on stopping here for the night. Get some food, sleep, and head out early tomorrow.”
Cas isn’t quite sure what to do with himself while he waits for Dean to come home. He doesn’t want to leave and risk injuring himself. If this is a dream, he’ll be fine, but if this is a version of Chuck’s future, he doesn’t want to mess with the timelines and cause this world full of peace to not have a chance of existing.
“You want breakfast? I was thinking of going and picking some stuff up, then we could shower and leave. That sound okay?”
“It’s hard to explain. You know how you feel when you eat ice cream?”
“When I touched
When Dean wakes it’s to the stench of burning -- foul and sour like someone lit a rotten apple on fire. Momentarily disoriented, head aching, he pushes up onto his elbow, gun still held tight in his hand and glances around.
Dean moves off Cas’ lap briefly, only to slide the rest of his clothes off and leave him naked, and then he climbs back onto Cas and
Nostalgia hits him full force walking into the house, down the hallway laden with childhood pictures of him and Sam, even a few more recent ones he gave Mary back when she was alive on Earth. Sprinkled among them are photos of Mary and John, their wedding photo, pictures yellowing at the edges with age in ways she could change, but Mary likes the natural look of them. The hallway opens into the kitchen and the same table Dean ate pb&j at as a kid. He settles into his usual seat, muscle memory kicking in and watches, silently, while his Mom pours cups of coffee for them both.
“You got me an ICEE,” Cas says, in wonder.
They eat and Dean doesn’t order pie. For once, he isn’t feeling it, more focused on finding a bed and passing out for the next few hours. Today was more than stressful, the lingering fear of losing Cas eating at him like a second wound. He doesn’t like thinking about Cas dying, it brings back the memories from a few years ago at how fucking bad it hurt. Dean doesn’t think he could live through that again, especially not now, not when he loves Cas more than he should.
Dean’s chest aches as a wave of familiarity and a sense of home fills him. He’s still Cas, still Dean’s best friend, and the love of his goddamn life.
Their eyes meet and it hits Dean like a lightning strike, and all the breath rushes out of his lungs. He wants to say more, but he can’t find the words. Instead, when Cas breaks eye contact, turning towards the portal, Dean follows.
“So, that was -” Dean’s voice trails off, smile widening, until the words dissolve to sweet laughter.
There’s the sound of the sink running and the squeak of the towel hanger spinning as Dean dries his hands. Cas rolls over to the other side, away from Dean, and slams his eyes shut, feigning sleep. He listens as Dean walks back, though he doesn’t get back in.
Cas reaches out and grabs his forearm, stopping him. “It’s not bad, it’s...”
“Shit, you still have this?” Dean says, in a tone Cas can’t quite place.
“Just another salt and burn right?”
“Or when you see Dad come home from work? Or you get to hold Sammy? It’s like that, but different.”
Nothing comes, there’s only the quiet pounding of his own heart and Miracle’s snores.
That’s the last Dean heard, despite calling Cas at least five times in the ten-minute drive across town to get to the aforementioned forest.
Cas’ hands drop to cover Dean’s where they rest over his stomach, slipping his fingers between Dean’s and interlocking their hands. He sways, just slightly, keeping Dean tight against him. In front of them, the sunset brightens.
Cas feels like he’s always watching Dean. It’s a wonder to see him when he’s comfortable enough to be himself, like he is now, not ashamed of his off-key singing or his dancing, which he might call “dorky” any other time, to the music while driving. It took time and broken and regained trust, but Dean made a permanent place for Cas in his life.
“Sandwiches,” Dean answers, eyes twinkling.
Dean looks at him, forehead wrinkled with worry. “Is it that bad? Your grace.”
“I don’t know. It looked like Kansas, might have even been Lebanon. I was in a house, a small one, very Stepford as you would say. You were there, and we were... normal. No hunting, no monsters, no God -- just us. A college history teacher and a mechanic with a garage full of hunting weapons starting to rust from lack of use.”
Sam shrugs. “Spirits aren’t always logical; it was still a secret she was hiding from people she loved.”
“I’ll be ready,” Cas answers, giving Dean a tiny smile before glancing down at his book and flipping it open.
"Hello, Daniel," Cas says, though not cheerfully.
“Oh, oh
“You’re real brave, you know, handling that all by yourself.” Sam smiles at Dean, always happy to receive his big brother’s praise. “How did it happen, though? Tell me the truth.”
Castiel wakes with a shiver. The bed seems colder than it should, and he rolls over, groping in the dark for Dean. A jolt of panic rushes through him when he finds the bed empty, but he takes a deep breath, reaching instead for the lamp on the bedside table. The nagging feeling in the back of his mind tries to tell him that Dean has left after all, that Dean has changed his mind, but that
Dean kisses Cas again, deeply, pressing their bodies closely together. Cas moans into the kiss, hoping Dean’s hands will move to his belt buckle next, but they stay frustratingly north of his waistband. Cas arches his back, pushing his hips up to meet Dean’s, desperate for the pressure, the friction. Dean grunts, choking on a moan in the back of his throat, biting Castiel’s lower lip. It felt too good, Cas grinding up against him, but he just can’t let himself have that. The emotions war in Dean as they have so many times before. He kisses Castiel’s neck, sucking and biting, sure there will be bruises there in the morning: evidence this happened. Cas writhes beneath him, chest heaving, heat pooling in his groin. It feels like those times in the shower amplified, more than doubled in intensity, and he doesn’t think it will be long before
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says, “don’t you?” Cas nods his head, wiping his nose on the back of his wrist, managing a little grin.
Before long, Dean is seeing signs for "ocean beaches" and then for Seaside and Cannon Beach, telling him there aren't too many more miles to go. As he approaches Highway 101, he turns south toward Cannon Beach. As the first glimpses of the Pacific Ocean become visible, Dean glances over at Castiel. Cas is still sleeping peacefully, and Dean is struck suddenly by just how much he cares for this man and how happy he is to have this time with him.
“I know,” Cas murmurs. “I know he meant well. It’s just embarrassing.”
“Yes,” Castiel pants, “so close, Dean.” Dean grips Cas tightly, jerking him off faster. He can feel Cas’s thighs beginning to tremble as he fucks into him harder. Cas moans louder still, crying out Dean’s name again and again. Dean is pretty sure anyone in any adjoining room can hear them, but he doesn’t fucking care.
“Well, It wasn’t
"Dean," Cas murmurs after a stretch of silence, "I'm going to miss you so much."
“Dean fuckin’ Winchester! Where the hell have you been?” the familiar voice exclaims happily.
“Any time, Cas,” he says, clearing his throat and putting the car in gear. Castiel holds the rose bush securely against himself as Dean begins to drive.
Cas is breathing peacefully against his chest, his body hugged snuggly against Dean’s side. Dean takes a deep breath, runs his fingers gently through Castiel’s soft, mussed up hair, and thinks. This is still terrifying to him; the notion of all those unspoken feelings coming to light, given room to breathe out in the open. But as Dean feels Castiel’s weight against him, he knows there’s nowhere else he’d rather be.
Dean extends his hand to her. "I'm Rob, and this is my brother John," he says, indicating Sam. Then, more to Sam than anyone else, he adds "We're Cash's half brothers." Sam nods at Dean subtly as their eyes meet.
“I’ve missed you too. Every single day.” Then Dean pulls back, looking into his little brother’s eyes. “Sammy, be honest with me, are you okay?”
“Yeah? You like that, angel?” Dean murmurs, low and dirty against Castiel’s ear. Cas nods, biting his lip. “You know,” Dean continues, teasingly, “you probably shouldn’t use our lord’s name in vain.”
“Do you want me to?” Dean spits out before he loses the nerve. He can’t remember the last time sex made him this nervous.
“Uh, well there was Missouri. She let me leave Sammy a message, so that was nice.” Billie nods, her eyes still focused on him. “And uh, met a kid named Cas. Seems cool, I guess. His family sounds pretty crazy.”
“Yeah, I’m fine; it’s not for me,” Dean answers.
"It's not uncommon for a person to be very confused after waking up from something like this..." Sara hesitates again.
Their lips meet again, and Dean smiles into the kiss, savoring Cas, his chest filling with relief, relief from the constant questioning that had consumed his mind in the past days. He has an answer now: yes. Yes, he wants Castiel. Gently, he places his hands at Cas’s waist, tugging him forward, encouraging Cas to kiss him harder. Cas is so new, an enrapturing, novel experience for Dean. It is evident that Castiel has never done this before, which renders him all the more endearing, not to mention exciting, to Dean.
in every other way. Sure, Dean struggles with depression and self harm, but that doesn't make him insane. The thought that Dean could be suffering from another serious mental illness scares Castiel, so he tries to push the idea from his mind. Right now he feels that Dean is the only reason he has to keep living, which is also scary, because Castiel's disbelief that another person could truly see any worth in him continues to sow seeds of doubt in his mind, makes him wonder if Dean was serious about seeing him again. Another panicked thought rushes to his mind: his family is apparently sending him
“Dean, what the hell? What do you mean,
“What? Why not?”
“Because I’m gay, and we live in the fucking
“It’s just the two of us now. Is it because I irritate you? Is that why you don’t like being too close to me?” Cas’s expression is pained. He’s still slurring his words a little, but he knows what he’s saying.
"Did he say which ones?"
"Meh. I'm sure it'll stop on its own," Dean shrugs.
"He studied religion in college, and he reads lots of stuff about mythology, so maybe he's mixing it all up with reality."
The voice on the other end of the line jerks him back into reality.
“Good enough,” Dean shrugs. “Hey, I was wondering if maybe I could call Sammy’s school. Just want to check in, make sure he made it back okay with his wrist and everything.”
Dean swears under his breath.
-Crosby, Stills, and Nash
"I think you overestimate me, Miss," Dean scoffs. Missouri shakes her head, clicking her tongue.
” Dean says more loudly, furiously wiping at those goddamn tears, and then Castiel is surging forward, pressing his lips to Dean’s, almost smashing their faces together in his enthusiasm. The kiss is passionate, wet and open-mouthed. Castiel savors the moment, everything about it, vowing to remember it
“Awesome,” Dean breathes, seeming to have calmed some.
“Do you have a girlfriend? Or maybe you’re into guys? Huh?” she asks, rolling her eyes in Castiel’s direction.
“Sorry. I didn’t realize it was important,” Cas replies.
“Ah yes, the ‘British Invasion!’” Garth comments, “It’s been a hard day’s night, am I right?” he jokes lamely. Castiel is probably the only one to understand the reference, but he’s too preoccupied to respond. Finally, it’s Dean’s turn.
“Yeah. Harvard, actually. He jokes that he can’t believe they let an ‘idiot’ like him in. I mean, it doesn’t hurt that dad has ‘connections’ there or whatever, but Gabe is actually really smart, so I’m not surprised.”
"Damnit, Cas!" Dean runs across the street, pulling his jacket on as he goes, trying to quell the panic rising in his chest. The rain is coming down harder now. Fuck.
“Yeah, uh, Sammy’s probably still in the Impala somewhere wondering where the fuck I am, but, I - I’m…” Dean hears Bobby’s heavy sigh on the other end of the line.
"Honestly?" Cas sighs, "I just needed to hear a friendly voice... I actually tried calling last night but the nurse said you couldn't come to the phone, so I was worried about that too. Are you okay?"
Cas nods, but quickly turns, making his way up the grand staircase in the entryway. He nearly runs into Anael in the hallway as he approaches his room.
Dean hisses as Cas grips him firmly. Cas pushes up on his chest gently, and Dean gets the hint, rolling over onto his back and kicking his boxers the rest of the way off. Cas throws his own to the floor alongside Dean’s before sliding down Dean’s body, coming to rest between his thighs. Dean’s moan is long and guttural as Cas sucks his cock eagerly into his mouth, laving his tongue over the head to taste what is beading there.
“Alright then. Have a good night, sugar.”
“I think you do.”
“Yes and no,” Dean sniffs, wiping his eyes hastily.
“Can I get you anything to drink?” Dean asks, setting Castiel’s small sack of belongings in one of the chairs and the rose bush on the table by the window.
"Does Cash have any other living relatives? Is he married? Any children?"
“You don’t understand,” Cas retorts, “my parents have so much influence, they’ll twist everything around to get whatever they want. They’ll say I did it to myself or, more than likely, that you did it to me. Dean, they could
Never pegged you for the jealous, possessive type.”
"I don't understand what is happening. Where am I?" The worry in Cas's eyes stabs at Dean. If Sam weren't there, he'd be tempted to take the angel's hand.
“We didn’t send you there to make friends, Castiel, and the
“I would love to,” Castiel admits, “but there’s no way my parents would ever pay for that. What about you?”
“Sure you’re not,” Sam says dryly, failing his shot miserably.
“Hmph,” is all Dean says in reply.
” When Dean doesn’t say anything, Castiel looks up at him.
"I think I would have fallen apart if I had lost you, Cas," Dean murmurs against Castiel's shoulder. "I know I wouldda fuckin' lost it," Dean adds with a ragged breath. "Sammy wouldda had to pick up the pieces."
of you can be quiet enough!” Sam’s exasperated voice proclaims, “I can hear every fucking word you’re saying.” For a moment there is stunned silence in the air, before Dean clears his throat.
“Oh,” Cas breathes, “okay.”
“Uh, I uh, hit it on a wall,” Dean mutters, staring intently down at his plate.
How had Cas gotten to know his features so well in such a short amount of time? It makes Dean's heart race a little to think that another person had taken such intimate notice of him, and he really hopes he can salvage this.
“Well, it says so right there, if you cared to read about it,” Cas says, pointing at an informational sign, “but, yes, I just knew it. It has been ranked by a human organization as the 434th tallest waterfall in the world, though that is rather debatable.” Dean stares at him.
“It’s good to have you back, man,” Dean says with a smile that makes Cas feel a little warm inside, easing the anxiety in his chest slightly.
“Fine.” The rest is a blur to Dean. He’d messed around a few times with different chicks, but never this. Never with a guy, some nasty stranger from some filthy dive bar.
“Yeah,” he coughs, “yeah I just… I don’t know… goddamnit!” And without warning, Dean turns and slams his fist into the tiled wall. “Ow, fuck!” He yells in pain, immediately regretting the decision. When he turns back to Cas, he is met with blue eyes filled with terror, and he feels like he is going to crumble to the ground.
“His name is Dean.”
When he finishes showering, he can hear Dean still moving around in the kitchen. He hobbles across the hall in his towel before pulling on his boxers and pajama pants as quickly as he can manage. He’s halfway through pulling his tee-shirt gingerly over his back when Dean appears in the doorway behind him.
“Cas, I, uh, I don’t know what to say,” Dean replies, voice thick with emotion.
Cas’s first kiss. And doesn’t that just make Dean feel like a piece of shit. Fuck! Cas is in such a precarious place, and Dean just fucking crushed him. Why is he always fucking shit up?
“I get it if you don’t wanna talk about it, but maybe you’ll feel better if you tell me,” Dean offers. “I always thought that was a load of bullshit, but if I learned one thing at the hospital, it’s that sometimes talking actually
Just then, Missouri knocks on the doorframe.
“I know, but still...” Dean says. He can’t stand the look in Castiel’s eyes.
"Please protect me from her," Dean jokes and Cas grins.
“Cas can tell me how attractive I am if he wants to,” Dean argues.
, sorry, this is just hard,” Dean struggles to say, “I… I took… um…”
good it was for me,” Cas answers solemnly, taking a deep breath.
“Why don’t you get yourself and the bed cleaned up a little, and I’ll go talk to Sam,” Dean sighs, standing and rummaging around for his clothes on the floor. Cas agrees, and Dean walks tentatively to the door, his hand shaking as he reaches for the knob.
"Why are you here?" Dean rasps, voice low and hoarse.
"Would I lie?"
“I know that,” Cas assures him, “but someday I will need to be able to survive an afternoon without you.”
Cas accepts the pills and glass of water Dean offers gratefully.
"I dunno, maybe," Cas says hopefully, "I'll at least try if you'd like."
“Cas? He the one you kidnapped?” Bobby asks, deadpan.
“No. What good news?” Dean looks at Cas, but his face is expressionless.
“Puppies! Dean, she gave out puppies as party favors!” Cas had laughed, tears in his eyes, “it’s
“What?” Dean asks before realizing that half of his face is covered in sand. Cas, likewise, is shaking sand out of his hair. They share a sandy kiss before Dean stands and gives Cas a hand up as well. He shakes as much sand as he can out of the comforter, but it is still damp and filthy. He shrugs; the housekeeping staff has likely seen worse. Cas is shivering slightly, so Dean wraps an arm around him, pulling him close, and leads him back up the beach to their hotel room.
“Well that’s probably part of it. Your blood pressure is a little higher than we would like it to be, but nerves can raise it temporarily. Nothing to worry about now, but we’ll keep an eye on it.”
“Oh,” Cas replies casually, “they like humidity.”
One by one, Dean unbuttons the flannel Cas is still wearing, biting his lip in concentration, glancing up at Cas like he’s about to have him for dessert. Cas considers for a moment that he might be dreaming, but then Dean is back at his throat, sucking bruises into his skin, plundering his mouth while his hands rove all over Cas’s body. If it is a dream, Cas is just going to enjoy it while it lasts.
“Morning,” he says with a crooked grin. Billie looks at him appraisingly with an amused smile on her lips.
“Thanks again, Bobby,” he says when Bobby comes to a stop.
“That’s great, Castiel. I’m glad you have found someone to talk to.”
“Better hope Ruby’s not around when they take it off,” Dean teases, “’cause it’s gonna smell like death!”
“Thank god,” Cas breathes. “Most people around here do, and it
to, but this is so unexpected.
place he wants to go right now. It’s all too fresh. He almost expects to see apparitions of the past day's events if he goes in there, shadowy ghosts of Dean, the paramedics, himself, the trainee, like a haunting caused by an emotionally charged event. But Sam doubts his dad would understand any of that.
“I’ll keep an eye on him too,” Dean assures.
"Leave Cas out of whatever this is," Dean demands, though his throat is so tight and mouth so dry that his voice falls far short of commanding.
“Are you alright, Dean? Did you get to talk to Sam?” Cas asks softly, knowing that Dean was anxious to hear from his brother after the injury.
Dean stares, wide-eyed and makes to follow Sam.
"It is, isn't it?" Dean agrees. "I remember the first time I saw the ocean. Dad was driving us through California and actually agreed to stop when we saw signs for the beach. He was probably sick of hearing Sammy and me whining all day and hoped we'd shut the hell up if we ran around for a while." Dean grins to himself as the memory floods back. "I'd never seen anything so big in my life, or heard anything quite like it. Dad stayed with the car, going over notes and stuff, but I had to get closer. Sammy was just six, and the waves scared the shit out of him, but he didn't want to stay behind. I still remember how tight he held on to my hand. Wouldn't let go. I kicked my shoes off cuz I wanted to walk in the water. It was fucking freezing, and Sammy was freaking out because he didn't want to get wet, but he also didn't want to let go of me, and he was sure we'd get in trouble if we got our clothes wet, and of course he was right. We rolled up our pant legs and I told Sammy it would be fine, but in no time some big-ass wave snuck up on us, and Sammy fell over, and I went under scrambling to catch his hand again before he was pulled out by the current."
It’s a little cramped but much warmer, as the two lay on their sides beneath the sleeping bags, Cas’s back pressed firmly to Dean’s chest. Cas continues to tremble, though.
In his bedroom, Dean crawled under his blanket, burying his face in his pillow before allowing himself to sob freely, alone and more terrified and confused than ever before.
“Cas, would you be willing to get a protective tattoo?” Dean asks, his tone as pleading as his gaze is manic. Cas hesitates but ultimately nods, rewarded by a look of relief passing across Dean’s face. “This one,” Dean adds, pulling at the neck of his teeshirt to once again show Cas the sigil tattooed on the left side of his chest.
“You alright, Cas?” Dean asks, but when Cas opens his mouth to respond, his voice fails him. “Cas?” Dean asks more urgently. When Castiel still fails to respond Dean grasps the door knob warning, “I’m coming in, okay?”
“Sam, if you don’t shut up this instant, so help me god…” John growls through gritted teeth. The look in his eyes tells Sam that he
“I don’t think she’s in danger,” Dean concludes.
“Very well,” Cas says contentedly, relaxing back into the pillows on the bed where he is sitting.
As soon as the door shuts behind María, Castiel hastily searches the pockets of his jeans, relieved to find that the note with Dean’s phone number is still there. Then he opens his biology textbook. Inside, he has cut out a hole big enough to hide a cellphone in. Sure, his parents bought him a phone that he uses for everyday things, but this is his
“I’m thinkin’ we crank the heat in the room, change into something more comfortable, climb into bed, and watch movies all day.”
“Warm enough?” Dean asks, pulling back to look into Castiel’s eyes.
“Why are you sharing this with me?” Cas asks, his voice trembling, telling Dean that his friend fully recognizes the significance of his revelation.
flip phones!”
the reason Sammy’s got clothes on his back and eats a few times a day! Only good you’ve ever done for him is left his ass with me!” John manages to get on top of Dean, slamming his head into the ground, wrapping his hands around Dean’s neck again.
“Well, I don’t want to risk it. I don’t want anyone to know where I am in case my family is looking for me. I know they told me not to try coming back, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve changed their minds and want to get me back under their control.”
"Dean, I don't know you the way I know Castiel, but I get the feeling that you are an intelligent young man. I think you can answer that question for yourself." Dean still looks at a loss.
"Actually it's quite frustrating... where is Dean?"
“How do you do it, Dean?” Castiel questions pitifully.
“Nah, Cas, he’ll get over it,” Dean assures him with another laugh and a smile. When they emerge from the hallway they discover that Sam has surrendered their pool table to another group. “Oh well, we woulda won that match anyway,” Dean shrugs, and they sit back at their table. Just then, the waitress saunters over with a grin, sliding into Sam’s vacant seat.
“Pull your knee up, baby,” Dean says as he wets his fingers with lube and settles against Cas’s side, kissing him deeply, claiming him with his mouth. Cas cries out, throwing his head back in pleasure as Dean begins to massage between his legs, running a finger around his rim before slowly entering him. Dean kisses him again, licking into his mouth, swallowing his moans as he slides his fingers deeper.
“Yeah, yeah, Dean, I’ll do that if it will help you,” Cas promises, relieved that Dean’s breathing seems to be slowing.
“Yeah?” Dean says, looking over at Cas, “and is it true?”
"Meg, I'm really not in the mood for your two cents right now," Castiel grumbles.
“Of course,” Dean grins, slipping the record from its sleeve with care. “You gotta be careful not to scratch them,” he explains as he shows Cas how to place the record on the turntable, carefully dropping the needle into place before he switches the player on.
“You wanna see
“Hold on, Cas!” Dean screams, “try to get to the corner so you can climb down!”
“That good, Cas?” Sam asks, struggling to keep his eyes from rolling.
“Don’t move from this car, you understand me?” he said sternly to Sam. Sam nodded solemnly.  “Good boy.  S’ gonna be ok, Sammy. Promise.” Sam didn’t smile or say anything, but he nodded again, and Dean squeezed his shoulder before exiting the car and heading inside.
“Whatever it was, it was fuckin’
Billie gazes at Dean patiently, waiting for a response. It’s his first one on one session with a psychiatrist, and it’s painfully uncomfortable. He likes Billie and all; she seems cool, but that doesn’t make it any easier for him to talk about his
"You told him
“Sammy?” he manages to murmur, his throat raw, tongue thick and clumsy in his mouth. Dean opens his eyes and finds Sammy standing at his side, his hazel eyes red and watery, swollen from endless weeping. “Sam…” Dean starts and trails off, his heart aching, the anguish in his chest unbearable as he looks at his little brother and truly realizes what he has done.
“Hey, man, that’s just something that happens when you don’t see a lot of action, if you know what I mean,” Dean assures him.
“Yeah, I know… better than you I’d wager,” Dean scoffs.
“There are a lot of choices here,” Cas says as he reads.
“You too, angel,” Dean replies.
"Hey, I'm sorry, okay, I didn't mean to lose my cool," Dean rushes to say, terrified that his chances of being released anytime soon are dwindling.
“He’s not weak!” Sam shouts, backing up against the wall as his father approaches, “and you treat him like shit! You hurt him, and tell him he’s worthless, but he isn’t!” Sam is sobbing now, knowing he should shut up and run for it, but he just can’t. “If Dean…” But his father cuts him off.
“Good morning to you too, Dean,” she replies, looking pleased, “did you sleep alright?”
“What?”
“Good night,” Castiel returns quietly, and Dean watches as he quickly enters his room, shutting the door behind him. He must have earned that privilege, Dean reflects, having a closed door, and he wonders how long Castiel has been here.
“Cas?” Dean breathes, as a surge of unrecognizable emotion overcomes him. He hastily throws the gun onto the nightstand and approaches the bed. “Cas! What are you…? Why are you…sleeping? You don’t sleep!” Dean rushes, “Why are you sleeping?” But Castiel doesn’t answer him right away. He slowly opens his electric blue eyes and gazes up at Dean with that look that Dean swears is boring into his soul. After a minute, he opens his mouth to speak.
“No,” Castiel says sincerely. “I’ve been here long enough to know the difference.”
“Humph, figures,” Dean says bitterly, fuming. “Sammy, how did you break your wrist?” Dean asks with a sinking feeling in his gut that only grows with Sam’s response.
“I don’t think so.”
“Don’t worry about it. Just promise me you’ll be back in to see me soon!” she replies.
“So what’s your problem, if it’s not the ‘gay thing’?” Dean asks, narrowing his eyes at Sam.
“Damn, you look sexy,” Dean says softly to Cas, taking in his wild hair, lust-blown eyes, and swollen lips, complete with a little come left at the corner of his mouth. “Uh, Cas, you got a little something right there,” Dean says with a grin, indicating the side of his mouth. He watches as Cas darts his tongue out, swiping the come from his lip, and decides to file that image away permanently in his mental “spank bank.”
He grabs a muffin, slumping into the seat he would have occupied across from Cas. He picks at the muffin listlessly. When Meg plops down across from him, he glares at her.
“Do they beat you or something?” Dean asks bluntly.
“All mine,” Cas echoes, clinging to Dean with all the strength he can muster. He moans again, low and drawn out, arching his neck, baring his throat. Dean takes it as an invitation, licking and biting, sucking, leaving marks on Castiel’s pale skin.
“Castiel?” Missouri says before he gets too far, “does this have anything to do with Dean Winchester?” Castiel freezes in his tracks, turning back toward her.
“It’s okay, I’m fine,” he lies obviously.
“Today was pretty good, actually. Billie said I might get to go home soon,” Dean says with a grin.
Cas isn’t sure why Dean has been calling him that all of a sudden, but he likes it; he really fuckin’ likes it.
“Alright,
, whereas the Pacific cod is in the kingdom
Dean leads Castiel onto the firm, packed sand closer to the water's edge where it is easier to walk. Cas is startled by the dramatic change in temperature against the soles of his feet when they reach the damp sand near the water, but it is nothing in comparison to the shocking cold of the water when it eventually reaches his toes. Cas laughs in surprise as the water rushes up around their ankles. The ocean's power seems limitless from mere feet away. The roar of the roiling surf beats in their ears as towering waves continuously rush in, crash, and recede. Cas notes a childlike wonder in Dean's expression; it is one of the things that Cas has always regarded fondly in Dean: that even after everything life has thrown at him, Dean is able to find happiness in some of the simplest things.
“No. Dunno where he is.”
Castiel kicks off his right shoe, but pauses, taking care with the left side, unable to kick it off without causing a lot of pain.
"Oh, you caught me!" Becky giggles. Dean turns to look at Cas who dramatically rolls his eyes, and Becky gasps again. "Oh! Are you two, like,
“Do you think they’ll let me go soon?”
“Sam!” Dean practically spits his beer across the table. “What the fuck, man?”
“Uh, yeah, I, uh, got this for you last week cuz I know you like plants and stuff, and then I forgot it in the back of the Impala, so it dried out and tipped over, but maybe it’ll come back if it gets watered and someone else is in charge of it...I apparently can’t nurture shit.” Dean hands Castiel the pot. It’s a miniature rose bush, or was one before Dean bought it and let it roll around in the back seat for a week. Castiel runs his fingers over the lettering on the pot,
“You’re quite welcome,” she replies with a smile and a pat on his shoulder.
“Well, that’s good, but you gotta be drunk to talk to your own brother?” Sam replies, almost sounding hurt.
"So what
Dean sucks hard one final time, slowly pulling off of Cas’s now over-sensitive cock. He’s overwhelmed by the taste of Castiel’s release on his tongue as he straightens up onto his knees, gripping himself hard. Within moments, he loses himself, shooting hot ropes over Cas’s belly and chest before collapsing to Castiel’s side.
"No," Cas says seriously, "family. Another being so close to you, you don't even have to speak to understand each other." His eyes are sad when he looks up at Dean. Sam looks at Castiel sympathetically.
“Yeah, I can see that,” he grins. “She really
“Nah, Sammy’s tough,” Dean deflects, “aren’t you, Sammy?” Sam swallows hard, the fear of getting a tattoo battling his fear of disappointing his older brother.
“Maybe I’ll start believing that once I’m away from them for a while,” Cas murmurs.
“Sorry,” he says, “it took a picture of me. I look terrible.”
Dean thinks before retreating into his room and flopping down on the bed. He spends the next hour or two motionless on the bed, staring at a blank spot on the wall, in shock over his current situation.
When he is finished, Dean pulls the sheet back over Cas and reaches for his trembling hand.
“Good. I mean, ‘cause I haven’t seen him recently. I’ve been spending most of my time at a friend’s house,” Sam says softly.
It's a weekday, and the weather is cold and windy as the Oregon Coast tends to be, so the two have the beach pretty much to themselves. There are a few wooden steps leading down to the sand. Cas navigates them carefully with his bare feet, following Dean's lead. Then he is stepping gingerly onto the beach. Feeling the cool sand between his toes for the first time, he can't help but smile. He stops, digging his toes in deeper. He feels as if his skin is registering each grain of sand as they tumble over his feet. It is a peculiar sensation.
“Dean, are you mad?” Cas asks with those innocent puppy dog eyes that rival even young Sammy’s.
“Cas!... Cas!” Dean whispers urgently, shaking him by the shoulder until Cas is blearily meeting his gaze. He opens his mouth to question, but Dean presses a finger to his lips, silencing him. “Thought I heard something in the hallway,” Dean murmurs, groping for his clothing.  Cas freezes; whatever Dean heard, it can’t be good.
“Shut up, Dean,” Cas says with a small smile, his brilliantly blue eyes shining up at Dean, “yes, I’m sure. You have no idea. Get me out of here, please.”
, and turns to Cas.
“No! I don’t wanna be sent away from you!” Sam cries.
blares appropriately from the speakers.
"Haha, Cas likes
“Thank you,” Dean breathes. “Sammy?” he says next, turning to take in his brother’s pale, worry-worn countenance. “What about you?” Sam freezes with his mouth open, unsure what to say. He desperately wants to please his brother, but truth be told, he’s scared.
“Dean, it’s alright,” Cas attempts to soothe him, “you had a bad dream.” But Dean knows it was more than that.
plays through the small Bluetooth speaker on the nightstand, Dean falls asleep, leaving Cas alone with his thoughts.
A soft knocking at the door announces Ruby’s arrival, and Sam rushes again to the door. That Sam wipes his palms on his jeans before opening it doesn’t escape Dean’s notice.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Dean answers gruffly.
“What is it?” he asks, “everything okay?”
true... I mean, it's a little true for me."
"Cas, you brought me back; you're the reason I have a life at all... and I have been an ungrateful bastard. I have hurt you so many times..."
“So, uh, what now?” Cas says next, attempting to dry his eyes, “I guess we didn’t really plan any of this.”
It has been too long. This thought chases itself around Dean’s head as it has been for the past couple of days. It enters once more as he climbs the damp stairs to his second floor motel room, pausing for a moment to dig the key out of his pocket.
“No,” Cas sighs, “my parents
“Dean wouldn’t make something like that up,” Sam replies, his voice the picture of sincere naïveté.
“I raised three boys. Nothing I haven’t seen before.” Carefully, she helps him onto the bed where he lays on his stomach. Castiel bites his lip, stifling the cry of pain he is on the verge of letting out. María quickly covers the lower half of his body with a blanket, and walks to the bathroom to wet a washcloth with warm water. Castiel whimpers softly as she dabs at the worst marks on his back, the washcloth quickly turning pink with blood.
“Dinner time, sugar,” Missouri calls, knocking on his door frame. Dean groans and rolls over to face her. “Come on, Dean, I’ll show you the ropes.” He’s not hungry, but he pushes himself up with a sigh and follows her down the hallway. He is led to a common room filled with tables and chairs and sees the other kids lining up to receive their trays. “When you’re done, return your tray and silverware, we count them by the way, and you can return to your room. Oh, and tonight is movie night, but don’t get too excited; it’s the younger kids’ turn to choose, and they always pick that one with the minions. Don’t worry, you don’t have to watch it.”
, Dean, the shit I heard! I’m never gonna get that out of my goddamn memory. It was worse than that time in Vegas...”
"He's doing well. In this field progress can be excruciatingly slow, but it's progress nonetheless. Cash, you're improving, walking a little further every day. Keep it up, and you could be ready in week or so. Of course you'd have to keep your exercises up at home too."
Dean showers then, before brushing his teeth and walking back out to where Cas is softly snoring. He glances at his sleeping friend, considering for a moment, but then collapses onto the other bed, pulling up the covers before falling into a deep sleep.
Dean can sense a change in Cas’s body as he transitions from fear to want. Castiel’s heart still races, his palms still sweat, his body trembles, only the cause has changed. Dean knows the feeling well, knows what a partner’s body feels like that first time you touch, when they have been aching for it for so long. Dean always gets off on that: being wanted. Only this is Cas; this is different. It’s so much more than an ego-stroking confirmation of Dean’s physical desirability. Castiel
"Of course they are," Cas groans.
“Cas, I don’t think they can do that,” Dean says.
The ride home in John’s truck is silent. Tears run down Sam’s cheeks, but he stares out the window, hiding them from his dad. When they get home, a feeling of dread creeps into Sam’s chest. He doesn’t want to enter that house, see the evidence that this whole thing
“I cut 'em all up,” Dean clarifies.
“Sorry, I forgot my math book, and I’m running late!” It’s Sam, rushing in to dig around under his bed.
“A little, why?”
“Castiel?” she murmurs, “what happened?”
“Effexor,” Cas answers, and Dean pulls out his phone.
“Night.”
“Of course you do,” he says, “anyway, I’m getting hungry. How ‘bout you?”
“No,” he says, “I don’t really want to be alone right now.”
So here he is now, Dean Winchester, feeling like a nervous, sweaty palmed teenager, trying to work up the courage to kiss the girl he’d liked all year, except he isn’t in junior high, and this isn’t some girl. He bites his lip as he listens to Castiel’s little, gasping breaths in the silence between them; he wants to feel those little exhalations against his skin. The thought makes him painfully aware of his dick, now fully hard in his jeans, and, fuck if he isn’t suddenly remembering the sounds he’d heard Cas make that one time in the shower, and Dean wonders if Cas had been thinking about
“No...sorry, not that I can think of,” Castiel says softly, glancing around the room. His breath catches in his chest when his eyes fall on Dean. Dean is looking right at him, an amused sort of grin on his face. Castiel’s instincts tell him he’s being laughed at, but when he looks harder into those green eyes, he doesn’t really think it’s that at all.
“What happened to your back?” Sam asks suddenly, shocked, before he even knew the words had left his mouth. Dean glares at him over Cas’s shoulder, shaking his head tersely. “I mean, sorry, nevermind,” and Sam quickly makes his exit.
The warmth Dean feels as Cas opens up to him is beyond incredible, like a cocoon he could crawl inside and remain perfectly content without ever emerging. Now that Dean has accepted it, Cas’s “maleness” no longer matters; it all seems so natural, like this is the way he has been meant to feel all along. As cliché as it may be, Dean resolves that if it’s he and Cas “against the world,” they may just come out on top after all.
“Oh, please. You
“Please, don’t make a big deal out of this!” Cas begs, “he was just lonely. He just wanted someone to talk to.”
Cas doesn’t want to admit the truth; he knows that Dean will feel responsible.
“Sammy…” his voice is a hoarse whisper, and tears well in his eyes against his will.
“Um, yeah, actually,” he admits, “we’ve been talking about music.”
"You know as much as I do at this point," Dean replies.
“It says 108,” she answers, “in which case, you’d probably be dead, or close to it. Let’s try this again.” 108 again. “Hmm, this thing must be broken.”
"Yes, he has been speaking to us. That's actually why I have a few questions for you regarding his baseline mentation."
"I just wanted to let you know that your brother is still in surgery, but his vitals are stable," she continued with a gentle smile.
“Hmm,” Cas replies, his face breaking into a grin, “what would you like to do?”
“Dean, you look so exhausted,” Cas sighs, concern wrinkling his brow.
"What the hell?" Sam exclaims once they are alone again.
“I have a phone call on hold for you. So sorry to interrupt, but it is important.” Dean nods, and stands to follow her, his stomach beginning to churn with anxiety.
“Well, I assumed you were coming with me,” Dean says, glancing over at Cas as he drives.
“What do you mean?” Sam asks.
“And I haven’t even touched your dick,” Dean grins, nipping his neck.
"Yessir," Dean whispered hoarsely, his body trembling like a leaf before a storm.
“Uh I dunno, just seems to help.” Dean says, holding out the food and latte.
” Dean whispers as if it’s a secret. Cas and Charlie just look at each other and dissolve into laughter.
"I'll be back first thing tomorrow. Promise."
"I dunno, Cas," Dean says quietly, his voice shaking, betraying the depth of his fear, "last time I told anyone, it didn't go so good." Cas wants to know now, almost feels like he
“Well, that was really fuckin’ uncool. And if you try and ‘fuck with’ me again, I’ll never acknowledge your existence again.”
“I guess you’d find out sooner or later, so I may as well just tell you,” Castiel grumbles. “My dad is
“Thank you so much, Cas, for trusting me,” he whispers. There’s a fire in his belly, and he desperately wishes they were alone, but they aren’t.
from the other kids he’d known before he dropped out of school. Cas, to put it simply, is interesting.
Yellow eyes burn through the darkness at him, and he can’t breathe. A sinister voice echoes in his head, its bass notes vibrating in his chest.
“You need a shower?” Dean asks him.
“Yeah, you like that, don’t you,” Dean says in a low voice, “love havin’ me everywhere, huh, Cas?”
“Perfect,” Cas breathes in reply, and Dean huffs a little laugh, tightening his grip by a degree.
“Yeah, Cas, it’s me. I got you,” Dean assures quietly, “you’re safe.” He can feel Castiel’s body begin to relax in his arms. Cas leans into him, burying his face in the space between Dean’s neck and shoulder, breathing him in. And suddenly, Dean wants to cry. He doesn’t understand why he can’t let himself have this, he and Cas just like this, always.
“It’s alright, Cas,” Dean murmurs to him softly, beginning to shrug off the flannel button-up he is wearing, “you can put this on.” Cas looks a little relieved and allows Dean to help him pull the sweatshirt and tee shirt off over his head, replacing them quickly with Dean’s flannel before Pam can notice the wounds on his back. Cas shivers in the cool air of the shop with his abdomen and chest exposed, and Dean wraps his arms around him, giving him a quick kiss.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, “but that’s not really what I’m talking about.”
to hear this! Come here,” Cas says seriously.
“You know,” Cas says, blushing. He hopes Dean can’t tell in the dim light. “It sucks being the only ‘fag’ in a private Christian school.”
When he does, he panics. The drawings are gone. Cas's iPod is gone. He tears the room apart, which mostly consists of throwing his bedding on the floor and tipping his mattress over, but the items are nowhere to be found.
“Oh,” Castiel moans, his eyes wide, “oh, Dean, fuck, probably very quickly. I do, however, need to urinate rather badly.”
"Thanks, Dean," Cas deadpans, rolling his eyes.
“Cas?” Dean says with a trembling voice. He doesn’t sound irritated now. Instead, he sounds shaken, scared almost, like a younger version of himself.
“It’s good,” Sam replies happily, “can’t wait to get the cast off though; it’s super itchy!” Dean laughs.
“That’s good,” Sam replies, but then asks, “what about the cuts, though? Did someone hurt him?” Dean’s breath catches a little. As much as he wants to withhold the cruel truth from Sam, he recognizes that he can’t.
“Sammy,” Dean suspires, setting his beer down and scooting closer to Sam, pulling him into his arms. “Everything’s gonna be okay,” Dean maintains despite that he has no way to know or ensure it. Sam looks up at him with those puppy-dog eyes that threaten to break him. “Listen, Sammy, Cas’s older brother is in law school, and he might be able to help me get you out of here once I’m eighteen.”
“Pretty sure mom was an honest to god angel,” Dean says sadly, “but she’s dead. Dad was probably okay when she was around, but he’s a real piece of work now.”
,” Dean chokes as though the world is ending.
"Mhhmm,
“But Cas is a guy,” Sam replies lamely.
“Oh, hey, here we are!” Dean announces, pulling off into a small parking lot at the side of the road. The sign reads
“Hi, I’m Becky! I don’t think I can decide, but I’d say it’s definitely a tie between One Direction and BTS; oh my gosh, I love K-pop! But I dunno, I also love Ariana Grande, and of
“Dean, I don’t know how much longer I would have made it before either my uncle went too far, or I just gave up and... well, you know... I know I haven’t known you that long, but you mean everything to me.” The sincerity in Castiel’s voice threatens to shatter something in Dean’s chest. Quickly, he moves, kneeling in front of where Cas sits on the bed, and pulls Cas into a fierce embrace, kissing him deeply before burying his face in the crook of Castiel’s neck.
“Well?” Meg prompts again.
“Oh, is that where you guys met?” Sam asks next.
“Shit,” Dean says. “We’re pretty close to my place. Wanna stop there and take a look?” Cas nods, and it's settled.
He knows for a goddamn fact that he did NOT imagine the past week... or at least that's what he tries to assure himself. He is just
“I don’t know what’s happening to me,” Castiel repeats, his voice trembling. “I’ve never…felt like this before.”
“I was worried when I woke up and you were gone.”
“Dean! What are you doing?” Sam cries, a horrified expression plastered across his face.
“You wanna shower? I mean, not that you need to,” Dean stumbles over his words, “but, you know, if you want to, you can while I figure out dinner.” Cas grins at Dean’s sheepishness. It’s too damn cute.
Dean slides into the driver’s seat of the Impala, Cas at his side, and Sam and Ruby in the back.
“No!” Dean nearly gasps, “that’d be great! Thanks! Really, Bobby, thanks so much for doing this.”
“So I did it right?” Castiel asks, “that was good for you?” Dean has to laugh again; after all that, this is the same old Cas.
“You, uh, wanna, like, uh
“‘S not you, just, can’t believe what I’ve done to him,” Dean cries.
“I guess...” Dean sighs doubtfully.
Then a gentle knocking is at the door, and it cautiously opens.
“Why are there cuts all over your arms?” Dean’s stomach clenches like it has suddenly turned to ice. He is paralyzed for a moment. Of course, Sam had seen. Dean had always been careful to hide them from Sam, but now Sam knows, and Dean has no idea what to say.
Suddenly, his blood runs cold. The man with yellow eyes is seated across from him in the chair that had been Castiel's. This is new. Yellow Eyes has never been present in front of other people before. Dean's eye dart around the room. It seems obvious to him that nobody else can see the man sitting in Castiel's chair.
,” Sam says through gritted teeth, shaking his head and pushing past them both before pointedly choosing a different bathroom. Dean can’t help laughing once the door is closed behind him.
Take care ❤️
“I won’t!” Cas insists.
Castiel decides to shower quickly while Dean is out, carefully undressing before walking into the bathroom. He gazes at his reflection in the mirror as he waits for the water to heat up. He looks tired, he thinks, but happy. He examines the marks up and down his neck and chest. He doesn’t quite understand why Dean enjoys biting him, or, perhaps even more confusing, why he so thoroughly enjoys feeling Dean’s teeth against his skin. It must be some weird human thing. Human sensation is so strange, Castiel has come to realize; at times, pain and pleasure can be so far removed from each other while, at other times, they are nearly one and the same. The lingering ache in his abdomen, left over from his injury and recovery, is at times almost unbearable to him, exhausting him physically and mentally, and he finds himself wishing with everything he has that the pain would somehow go away. At the same time, however, his rougher, more physically demanding sexual encounters with Dean, while painful at times, have left him feeling the most “blissed-out” afterward. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever truly understand it.
hurts. His forearms are wrapped in bandages, and he has an IV placed in the crook of his arm. He feels all drugged up, sluggish, like he can’t will his body to move. His eyes roam the room, but he struggles to process what he is seeing, so he lets them fall closed again. Then he hears the soft click of the door opening and some hesitant footsteps.
“Sam,” Cas begins in a hushed tone, “how often is he like this?”
“Any time, Cas,” Dean replies, running his hands over Castiel’s back. “Everything’s gonna be okay,” Dean adds, pulling back to look into Cas’s eyes. “I’m not usually so sure about that, but I feel good this time.” Cas smiles before leaning in for another long kiss.
“Remember, you got us kicked out for freaking that chick out by knowing random shit about her?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, “but, Cas, I’ll be here with you.”
why I’m here, but I’ve got real shit too that my parents just don’t bother to notice.”
“I know, Sam, it’s not fair; Cas and I will be okay, though. But Sam, I don’t want you going back to the house. I don’t want you there with him by yourself.” Dean bites his lip as he listens to his little brother quietly breaking down as he absorbs all Dean is telling him.
“Charlie is helping me with my panic attacks,” Cas says dreamily.
“Someone forced you?” Dean questions gently, and Cas nods against his chest. Dean takes a deep breath, fighting the urge to slam his fist into something.
“Goddamnit, Castiel,” he says as he’s walking back to his room. He doesn’t realize he is actually saying it out loud. “Get yourself together.”
." Castiel's heart hammers in his chest. His ears ring.
... Almost like the inside of the wound was cauterized. And it was deep. He is actually very lucky as the wound seems to have quite narrowly missed his aorta."
“Yes, definitely,” Dean says happily before saying goodby and returning to the bedroom.
“Yeah, I know, I’m a train wreck,” Dean concedes. “My dad finally showed back up today, we got in a fight, and he kicked me out.”
“Yeah,” Castiel answers, still hesitant, waiting in the doorframe to be told to leave, “are you okay?”
“I don’t know that we do,” Cas replies despondently.
“Oh.”
“What?” Bobby exclaims incredulously.
Castiel closes his eyes. He listens to Dean’s heart hammering behind his ribs, hears Dean’s breathes, shaky and uneven. He tries so hard to understand Dean’s behavior, but it seems he’s always left wondering. Cas wonders again if he did something wrong. But at least Dean is still holding him, and Cas is grateful for that. He wishes Dean would say something, that Dean would just tell him what he is thinking, or that he himself had the courage to simply
“It’s probably not great. That’s my fault though. I’ll try to get a salad in him once in a while,” Dean offers and Leah moves on.
“Yeah,” Dean says, tears in his own eyes, “I hear you, and I promise. Just like I promised Sammy. Never again.”
“Cas! You okay- ahhh…” Dean finishes with a moan as Castiel’s mouth is suddenly on his dick. “Oh, fuck, Cas,” he groans, leaning back against the shower wall. Cas doesn’t hold back; he’s been curious about this for a
“Yeah, that’s what they’re prescribed for. Who’s this friend, anyway?” she replies, and Dean takes a deep breath.
“What do you wanna eat, Sammy?” Dean asked with a hoarse voice as he turned the key in the ignition.
“You think I raised you to be some kinda faggot whore?” John yells, spit flying. The words hit Dean nearly as hard as John’s fist, and he’s stumbling backward again.
When they pull up in front of the clinic, Dean takes a deep breath, letting it out slowly.
“I understand, Cas, and I don’t blame you. I’d be a fuckin’ hypocrite to say anything after all the beatings I’ve taken and hidden from anyone who may have tried to help,” Dean replies. “You get stuck between thinking no one’s gonna want to help and being too afraid of what might happen if they did.” Cas nods in agreement, swallowing hard.
“Don’t sound like you need fixing,” Dean says, leaning back in his chair and Cas smiles.
“I’m not goin’ anywhere,” Dean assures him warmly. “Hey, Sammy, this is my friend Cas, by the way,” Dean appends.
“I…” Dean begins, but the words get stuck in his throat, and he falls silent again.
“Mmmhmm,” Dean says, putting on an innocent face and dropping his menu, “I’m a likeable guy.”
He struggles through his morning routine one-handed, but manages to make it to school on time. About halfway through the school day, his home room teacher takes notice of his wrist. Reluctantly, Sam tugs his sleeve up so she can look at it. It’s horribly swollen, black and blue, and Sam admits he can’t really move the fingers on that hand. His teacher is horrified. Sam, of course, claims it was an accident.
“I think he’s only interested in people connected directly to me,” Dean explains, his tone somber.
“Dean, are you trying to tell me that the best sex you have ever experienced has been with me?” Cas asks, hopeful and excited.
Also, poor Cas! Sorry this chapter ends on such a depressing note. More chapters coming soon. Hang in there! 😥
“You kissed me back,” Cas says hesitantly.
“You think Cas is decent yet?”
“That’s great!” Dean exclaims. “You could bother to tell me these things, buddy,” Dean says to Cas, thumping him on the shoulder.
“I thought you were gone,” Sam whispers between sniffles. “Dad said you left.”
So, I don't necessarily want to push drugs...BUT, if you've never listened to Pink Floyd while high on pot, you haven't really lived. Haha, kidding, but seriously, Cas's reaction is basically the story my brother told me about the first time he smoked and listened to
Soon, the brothers are climbing into the Impala, closing the doors as quietly as they can. Dean pauses with the key in the ignition. He knows the car will possibly wake John, but that doesn’t matter, he thinks; they just need a head start.
“So why don’t you come out back and let me make a man out of you.” Dean can feel the color draining from his face as the guy begins to lead him to the back door.
“My little brother.”
Cas breathes, arching his back, pressing his body closer to Dean’s. Slowly, Dean adds another finger, stretching Cas gently, doing his best to emulate what he’s seen in some pornos, and avoid some of the mistakes he made with that one adventurous chick who let him try this. So far, Castiel seems to be thoroughly enjoying himself, so Dean thinks he must be doing it right.
"So no change yet?" Sam asks Dean once they're alone with Cas again. Dean sighs.
“What?! No! Only been together a few days,” Dean replies awkwardly.
“Dean, the thought of losing you terrifies me,” Castiel says after a while.
“What’s that?” Sam questions.
"Dean?" she says softly.
“Good.”
The place isn’t too busy, luckily; even still, the whole process takes a few hours. X-rays confirm what they all suspected: it’s broken (a “boxer’s fracture,” the doctor informs him). By the time Dean re-emerges with a  splinted hand, he looks rather pale.
“I… I didn’t want you to see,” Cas murmurs miserably.
“You ready Sammy?” Sam nods, and Dean turns the key. The instant the car roars to life, Dean guns it and they disappear into the night.
“Shoot,” she answers, grinning at him amusedly.
His mother’s brother, Zachariah has been his “spiritual counselor” for years. Of course the title is bullshit, as Cas has more recently come to realize that Zachariah likely has no qualifications of any kind. When Castiel was in the 6th grade, his parents started to suspect
"Tell you the truth, I'm pretty sure I have
“No!” Dean gasps, “no, you can’t leave the room. Not now.” Cas is taken aback but refuses to let it show.
“Yeah, fuck, Cas, come for me, baby,” Dean moans, grasping Castiel’s cock firmly, stroking it as Cas cries out, coming hard, his muscles spasming around Dean, as he continues thrusting into him.
“Oh, Cas, don’t you worry your sweet little head,” Dean says absentmindedly as he scrolls through iTunes. “This will be much better.” Minutes later, Dean’s phone buzzes in his pocket and he shifts in his seat to retrieve it. It’s a text from Sam:
“It’s
Quickly, Castiel enters Dean’s number into his phone and stashes the note in his book. He’s sure Dean is still at the hospital though, so he doesn’t bother trying his cell yet. Instead, he scrolls through his phone to find the hospital’s number and calls it, listening to the ring with insane butterflies in his stomach. He doesn’t know what he is planning to tell Dean; he just wants to hear his voice.
“What is it?”
“It’s me, Cas; I’m the one you got too close to. You told me that yourself! You told me that you chose me over the other angels.” Dean’s voice is threatening to break with emotion.
“Please don’t judge me, but I got a friend that owns a tattoo shop but is kinda a low-level drug dealer on the side. Anyway, she’s got some stuff that may be able to help you through the next week or two.”
“Like what you see, angel?” Dean asks, cocky and far more confidently than he feels. Cas simply blinks at him before stepping toward him to rather timidly run a hand over Dean’s chest.
"God, I'd give you a big fuckin' hug right now if I didn't know it'd get us banned from even talking to each other," Dean says with a grin, and Cas curses Missouri in his head.
“Cas, fuck, it’s not your fault. I’m not mad, it’s just, this is the
wishes he and Cas had planned this out better. Hesitantly, he lays on the horn a couple times, afraid he’s going to attract more than just Castiel’s attention. And then, to his horror, a gleaming white Cadillac pulls up the driveway behind him, just as a young woman in a bikini appears out of nowhere in front of him.
-Led Zeppelin
“You stole holy water from a church?” Cas speaks for the first time since they sat down, an amused smile on his lips.
"Whatever," Dean deflects with a shrug, unable to take anything resembling a compliment. "I'm sure I could manage to scare you off."
“Kiss me, angel,” Dean commands as he continues jerking them both off, and Cas hurries to obey, his lips so warm against Dean’s. Dean loves the way Cas whimpers into the kiss as he tightens his grip on their dicks, making needy little sounds as their lips remain locked together.
"You don't have to keep that one if you don't want," Cas says, his voice falling softly on Dean's ears, shaking him out of the place he'd gone.
“Because Dean is a
“You’re a good friend, Dean,” Castiel mumbles, patting him on the back with one of his hands, “you know that?”
In the morning, Castiel splashes cool water on his face, rubbing his eyes, trying to forget about the particularly pleasant dream he’d been having just before he woke up. He desperately tries to push that guy from his mind, but finds himself attempting extra hard to get his hair to look decent anyway.
“Yeah, Cas; that sounds like love,” Dean says quietly. He thinks about all the things Cas just said, realizing they mirror his own feelings. His fear had kept him from admitting that to himself before.
And then he thinks about Dean. No, not like
“Jesus,” Dean swore, “that’s some dark shit.”
“What?” Dean asks, stunned, “you’ve been
“Would you like to get breakfast now?” Castiel asks. Dean is acting strange again.
“I’m sorry,” Pam reiterates, “but I just can’t. I could lose my business, my livelihood, for even tattooing you and Cas, but if word got out I tattooed a thirteen-year-old? I can’t risk it.”
“Oh,” Sam remarks, but Dean discerns something is going on in his head.
“Please don’t tell,” Sam pleads with him.
“Deal,” he says, shaking his head, “thank you.”
"Lying is a sin; you know that," Zachariah says, shaking his head.
“Don’t want you thinkin’ I’m crazy,” Dean replies.
“I’ll do my best, I promise. I got to go, but I’ll see if I can visit you.”
don’t do anything to Zachariah. I know he’s an evil piece of shit, but I’d rather have him alive if it means having you with me and not in prison for life. Please, Dean, promise me you won’t do anything rash.”
"Uh, it isn't Meg," Dean says to the door. In an instant, it's opening, and he's greeted by Cas, who looks a little worse for the wear.
Who let you chuckleheads into the office?
In fact, this Friday Dean is taking me to TGIF Friday’s as our first proper date. I’ve never been there before.
Hope you enjoy! It's a bit of a short chapter, but I'll make up for it in the next one.

Dear Snick,

As you can see he also intentionally left out the Winchesters. More reveals to come. :)
“Do you remember me?”
Light brown hair. Green eyes. A crack in the smirk that he frequently wore.

Hey Dick,
Good Luck,
Let's teach them one final lesson, he thinks. What happens when a...
betray you like that, even if we aren’t official yet. I asked you out on a date and that is a promise I plan on keeping…if you’ll let me. (Please?)
Dear Im-PIE-la,
“So, what are you doing here?” Dean asked, repeating the action but without the hidden erection.
Babe in Headlights,
My Sweetest Chuck,
It’s nice to make your acquaintance,

Dear Desperate…

Talk about love at first sight! You pack enough excitement for the both of us! Question: Have you tried out for the cheer squad? As long as you keep that peppy attitude and look sexy in a mini skirt, cheerleading should be a breeze for you. That status should also get you in to all of the cool girl cliques this crappy school has to offer. Just wear a couple tons of make-up and some transparent clothing and you should look like them. Not only that, but you’ll also have Dean-o gift wrapped and at your door for Christmas. Which brings me to another question: Are you desperate? That Winchester doesn’t know how to keep it in his pants. Kid’s banged more gongs than Andy Gallagher. Kid’s seen more pussy than that crazy cat lady down the block. Kiddo’s gotten more back than Sir Mix-A-Lot. He’s Bad Luck Brian. If you’re looking for a one night stand though, go right ahead. If you’re looking for an even better one, call me. 981-555-6809
“I’ve understood human anatomy and physiology for millennia, I mean, I watched you guys evolve, but I never realized how uncomfortable it all is! Not to mention time consuming, what with all the eating and sleeping and urinating and -“
“Ahh...mmmh...oh,
“Castiel, you listen to your mother right now, or you will wish you’d never been born!” their uncle shouts, stomping across the yard, closer to Dean, but not quite approaching him.
Eventually, Dean falls into a deep, peaceful sleep, Castiel’s body weight a grounding comfort in his arms. Together, both men sleep soundly for a few precious hours. This time, Cas wakes first and is both surprised and pleased to find Dean’s arms still wrapped snugly around him as the man continues to sleep. He doesn’t  want to move and disturb him, so Cas lays still, enjoying the simple joy of being held by the person he cares so deeply for. It is even better than he had imagined it would be, being so close with Dean. In the past 24 hours, Dean has opened up to him more than he had in the past couple years combined, and Castiel feels unbelievably lucky to have gained his trust and affection. He isn’t sure why Dean Winchester, out of all the human beings throughout time, captured his interest so fiercely, but there is something indescribable about Dean that won’t let Cas go.
“And you saw how my dad looks at me, so there’s that,” Dean adds.
The last time Dean attempted to speak with his father about anything of import, he had been ten years old. He was so nervous, his hands had been trembling as he hesitantly approached John.
Anyway, this all to say, antidepressant withdrawal is no joke. I learned my lesson the hard way, and I wasn't even on an incredibly high dose. I've read multiple places that getting off of Effexor can be as difficult, if not more so, as getting off of heroin. Well, I can't speak to that personally, as I've never done heroin, but I can say it definitely sucks. It took weeks to get back on my meds with the help of a medical professional, as well as seeking psychological help to deal with the clinical depression the whole situation triggered. I've been back on my meds for years now and am doing well, however, I will be seeking medical help soon to see about weaning off of the Effexor and replacing it with something that is approved for use during pregnancy... not because I'm pregnant, but because I would like to be someday, and want to have this all ironed out before having to deal with crazy hormonal mood swings. ANYWAY, that's probably more than any of you needed/cared to know, but I guess aside from writing my silly little stories, I'd like to just put out there that if you're struggling with depression or any other mental illness, you're not alone, and please don't hesitate to seek help, use medications, or whatever you need to be well. And for fucks' sake, if you're on meds, keep taking them! ;) *hugs*
