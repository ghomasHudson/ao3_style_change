“I’m so seldom in London that when I am, I have many people to see,” Sherlock told her. In fact, just then his in-box was rafters-packed with CRUZR messages from men who’d be all too glad to utterly debase themselves for the chance to see him, though his mother did not need to know he wasn’t referring to reunions with childhood chums—of which he had none in any event, nor cared to.
“Hey, what about that?” John exclaimed when Sherlock finally broke through the membrane of players’ bodies to reach him. He had to steady himself on Sherlock’s arm and lean close to his ear to be heard. Sherlock felt his hair being disarranged by the force of John’s breath.
“Mandy, can you call around and see if anyone can come in and cover the rest of my shift? I think I’ll have to get my daughter at school.”
John, with that smile of his, looking elder-hipster-handsome in slim blacker-than-black jeans and a horizontal striped shirt—maroon and beige, he had seven or eight of the same in various colourways—flat basketball trainers with a star on the inside ankle.
Sherlock finished for him, “You know—better than most—how difficult it is for children removed from even abusive or neglectful parents. They’d rather be with their own, no matter how bad the situation.”
Having ascertained that all her bodily needs were addressed and met—he’d remind her about the bathroom again in thirty minutes—Sherlock was ready to move on to the more diverting matters at hand.
“Don’t know about that,” John smirked, and pulled a face. “You can slap my arse as I walk away, if you like.”
Sherlock had three pipes in a stand in his bedroom; two of black clay and one with a briarwood bowl and Bakelite stem, which he smoked more rarely but which John knew was his favourite. It was a beautiful thing, polished to bring out the wood’s colourful burl, with an amber-hued, opaque stem gently curved to give the pipe its elegant balance. No doubt it had been costly, and Sherlock was never one to spend an unnecessary penny for even the simplest of personal pleasures; John imagined he thought it too special--or perhaps too show-offish--to use regularly.
John tried desperately to calm himself as he walked to Rose’s school. Even so, he nearly double-timed, arriving with over twenty spare minutes to kill before she was dismissed from class. He found a seat on the platform of a climbing structure in the school yard, breath sharp in his side from his rush, and took out his phone to text his therapist.
“Not in the least. John seems a solid fellow, affable, clearly without designs on your money nor basking in any reflected glory—”
“Am I supposed to feel special?” was Steven’s gravelly reply. Sherlock had scraped his fingertips through Steven’s beard, then down the back of his neck.
“Thank you for this,” Sherlock said, motioning vague indication of the bed, the empty room service trays and wine bottles, his sore quadriceps. “Sorry to rush off.”
John released his wrists and Sherlock immediately reached arms around his back, embraced him, licked his lips to receive John’s deep kisses. They hummed into each other’s mouths, held tight to each other, hips still rolling until eventually they calmed and John moved up and away, smirking at the state of them, half-dressed and messy with cum.
John did a web-search to confirm what he thought he knew, and decided he likely would not. But who knew? He’d try anything once.
“Something you need?” Sherlock asked, from a seat in the big grey leather armchair. He was cradling a book that looked quite old, probably priceless, and was dressed in silver-grey pyjama pants, his long feet bare and pale, a black t-shirt, and a burgundy-coloured dressing gown.
John looked surprised, then grateful, to have been asked so pointedly about his potentially mixed feelings, rather than accepting yet more congratulations and thanks. Doubtless he’d deserved to be celebrated and honoured, and had been for the better part of the previous eight hours, by innumerable former teammates, coaches, and less intimate colleagues—not to mention the deafening, appreciative roar of the fans—but Sherlock well knew John’s transition away from playing hockey was still in its early stages. John was very much feeling his way through it, and not every day was it easy for him to find his way. Particularly since the season had started, Sherlock could see him struggling sometimes, despite being busy with other, newer things. John had spent his entire adult life in the routines, trials, and triumphs of a hockey player.
geezer.” He looked at Sherlock, who smiled dutifully. “Ninety-three, if you can believe that. Told me that when he’d turned seventy, he started drinking in the pub every lunch time, and took up smoking because he wanted to look cool.”
At one end of the long bar was a group of about a dozen, some clearly still dressed in at least partial uniforms at the end of workday, others more purposefully attired. The party took up a few bar stools as well as three pushed-together tables in a corner. Sherlock ordered two whiskys—doubles—and John kept close to his back talking upward, loudly, to make himself heard over the cacophony of 1970s dance music and the scream-chatter of partygoers.
, pretty boy,” he moaned, and reached for Sherlock’s hand, twining their fingers, gripping tight as his other hand worked furiously along his length. “Gonna come all
“I have all I need. I’ll be in touch,” he said to the plainly-dressed cop who appeared to be in charge. “John.”
SH: [laughs. Laughs more. Laughs forever while Watson clears his throat.] Take him home to meet my family.
“She wasn’t a real person, John. Mary was just a mask created to draw you in and destroy us both.” There had been soft silence from the basket near the sitting room fire for nearly fifteen minutes and they’d lay side by side in bed, just beginning to allow themselves to trust Rosie would sleep on for at least a little while after her evening routine of a two-hour, near-inconsolable emotional disassembly followed by a bottle, bubbling, and a bath in the kitchen sink.
“She ate something. From a box. Pretzels or crisps—with taboule salad—and drank water. Watched something on the tablet. Animations.”
“Well, hello,” John smiled at him, and they embraced, one arm each, more like friends. Sherlock took the handle of his case and stood by while John checked in. “Flight was OK?”
. Feeling annoyed by what he still felt was a false distinction, but not wanting to be forced to discuss it further, John backspaced to correct himself.
“I don’t want it to end,” Sherlock said, and met John’s gaze, which was affectionate and inquiring. John cut a pointed glance toward Sherlock’s hand on the tabletop.
“Offered him a drink but he was good to go,” John said, his voice lowering as he settled into recounting the memory. “So we went up to the guest bedroom and he started to strip.”
John’s voice, surprisingly close. “Goodnight, Sherlock.” John kissed him, soft and hot, half on his eyebrow and half on his skin, steadying himself with a palm on Sherlock’s chest. Kissed him again, more firmly. Left the room then, to sleep on the sofa.
John started to speak but it shattered apart as he came, sticky-hot between their bodies, collapsing down on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock wriggled his hips upward, found friction, and quick-rubbed himself along the side of John’s still-pulsing length, bringing himself off, his own come spurting out to mingle with John’s.
Sherlock stood by the wide window, between the drapes open just wider than his body. The view was dismal: a service alley for the hotel restaurant, a highway on-ramp, and beyond it tattered houses too close together and too close to liquour shops.
“No scold about how I should feel lucky to still have some,” Sherlock commanded, and exhaled a blue-grey cloud that quickly dissipated in the breeze. He ashed out the window and let his eyes close.
As the skaters reset at the center dot, John’s former linemate Corey Hatch checked in. “Lonely back here, Holmesy?”
The second period brought more of the same. The Gold Rush offense checked in and increased the pressure in Sherlock’s end, forcing him back to work despite his continuing off-kilter sensation. He made a handful of saves before they put another one past him, a stick-side wraparound when he was only halfway back from the glove side, where he’d made two saves in rapid succession, head and arms outside his crease. A good goal he couldn’t have saved. Nonetheless he cursed himself as he spat his water.
Sherlock nodded definitively, knew precisely how to lead this particular dance. He got to his feet and shed his dressing gown, adjusted his shirt cuffs. “Not at all dangerous,” he assured, and he was not lying. He was sure the tech-thief was a woeful amateur, no secret agent carrying ultra-fine syringes or radioactive business cards. It was only a matter of timing. He found his jacket draped over the arm of the sofa, unfolded it and shook it out before slipping his arms in the sleeves. “Like to come along, then?”
“I’ll get them,” Sherlock volunteered, got to his feet stretching, then strode into the room. “Just be a minute,” he called over one shoulder as he continued past the bed, and then the bathtub, and paused beside the sink where he had been brushing his teeth and only shaving his face every third day. He unzipped his leather toiletry bag and shoved aside its contents to find what he wanted, tucked carefully into the bottom corner.
“Thought you didn't do charms, John.” Says the black-haired man loudly, grinning. He must've known the short man was going to be expert at handling the deadly blonde mare.
John sighs, brushing down the arms of his jacket. He looks nervous, sick with it, staring at Gladstone. The water horse, after being out and about all day, seems comforted, sticking his face out the tiny window he has, nostrils flaring to scent the wind blowing in from outside. After a heartbeat, John reaches for him arm. Sherlock lets him take it, lets John’s hand slide lower until it has found Sherlock’s.
This could be a fun escapade for John, a last kick of adrenaline and endorphins before the Races trample everything. John’s body falls over Sherlock’s, and the notion flies out of his head.
“I have been in my own world for quite some time, longer than usual. I was beginning to worry that someone had lost my figurine. I cannot come back without it.”
“He also might have told me as much, that I’d done something wrong by letting you go that first time. He told me I ought to have a different conversation with you. I promised him I would, if he gave me something too.”
“My father thought it was,” Henry replies smoothly without looking at him. Sherlock would be able to gather more information from the monger, but John doesn’t have his gifts.
He lets Sherlock through and pockets the key to the Ford in pants that are several years old and have seen less muddy days. They’re also wet, over John’s knees and more importantly his thighs, sticking to the muscle and shaping it. After a second it registers that John must’ve gotten wet when hauling Sherlock over the edge of the quay and sitting beside him, but John has said nothing about the chill. For most of the last twenty years, working at the Stockyard, John has likely said nothing about many things that bother him.
“Sherlock’s boyfriend!” his father exclaimed, disbelief in his tone. “Honestly I was beginning to think he’d made it all up. Doctors Without Borders? That’s admirable work.”
Too engrossed in Rosie’s nighttime ritual to remember to listen for it, he couldn’t recall hearing the front door shut; regardless, the fact of John still lingering in the sitting room took Sherlock by surprise. He was wearing his coat, and the fingers of his left hand were busy. Sherlock stood by the kitchen worktop, lifted the wine bottle and swished it, checking for remnants. John cleared his throat.
Because Rosie was mewly and pathos-inspiring in her weepy insistence John let her convalesce “at home,” they’d fallen back to the flat in Baker Street, which Sherlock reminded with a shrug was nearer the hospital, if nothing else. Secretly he was some inappropriate blend of relieved and smug as he kissed her still-too-warm forehead and left her room so John could do the final tucking of blankets and reassuring she’d soon be well and that he’d leave her door open a bit in case she needed to call for him.
He slept restlessly; riding post-orgasmic endorphins into sleep every night but waking at odd, pitch-dark hours to flip his pillow, turn over, and try not to think about the past’s if-onlys and the what-ifs of the unknowable future. He tried to find thirty minutes every day to sit, quiet his mind to the point of emptying it, and most days he managed it, but always he itched to be done, to get up and go, keep moving, and his brain revved back into overdrive in a matter of minutes. He knew it couldn’t hurt; he did doubt, this time around, if it was any help.
“Definitely not.” John’s smile was the most brilliant thing Sherlock had ever seen, every time he saw it.
He called out to Bouchard, skating the long way around to take a defensive-end faceoff. Bouchard glided up close and Sherlock quickly told him, “Furney is terrified of you and will jump the gun to get thrown out. When Carroll comes in, he’ll hesitate. Throw back to Hatch and skate like hell.”
Indulging a lingering regret about his and Sherlock’s now final and official Last Time Together, John let himself ponder the wet way they’d kissed; the texture of Sherlock’s nipple in his mouth; the vague satisfaction John had felt when he realised there were still no condoms in the drawer, no freshly-bought packets of someone else’s preferred brand of lubricant. Not that it was his business whether Sherlock had begun dating, of course, but John had always been territorial, he couldn’t help himself.
John eased around the doorjamb to look down the hall. The blur had resolved into a tall, wild-haired man in smart trousers and a fine shirt, barefoot and wearing an untied, blue silk dressing gown over his clothes. He flicked a glance John’s way, then back into the drawer he was combing through. Then back at John, for longer. John clasped his hands behind his back.
Sherlock was at his microscope in the kitchen, half-empty cup of tea at the two o’clock position, plate empty of all but a few crumbs at the ten o’clock, his bare feet on the cool linoleum, Watson at school, St Saens on his mobile’s music app. In the absence of a pressing case, he’d undertaken a catalog of late 19
More. Not merely more sex, though of course that would always be a welcome endeavour, but more of a bond, more empathy, more reminders of their better natures. Sherlock wanted more of
“Yes, see? Here’s the bee picture and—I think—yes—there is Mrs Turner walking her Chihuahua around in the alley. It’s nearly half-eight; are you tired?”
Mrs Hudson, clucking concern. John held the phone away long enough to let go a quick sigh before he replied. “No, Mrs H; I’m working. At the clinic.” More because he wanted to soothe her than because he was concerned about Sherlock—certainly capable of caring for himself and not required to apprise his landlady of his whereabouts every moment of every day—John asked, “Is something wrong?”
“Sure. Right.” John pivoted, was not sure whether the man would follow, but eventually felt him coming along, at a distance. Inside his single room, he went into his duffel and easily put hands on a small box of wood matches. He made a mental note that they would need replacing as soon as he got out to the shops.
“Video chat, maybe?” John ventured, looking at the desk where the computer had been photographed and was by then being removed by uniformed officers to transport to Sherlock’s on-call hacker. “But there was a game showing there.”
“Fantastic,” John agreed, and they arranged themselves, Sherlock’s hand resting atop John’s, and Sherlock sighed away every care he had in the world. For the moment, everything was, unquestionably, just as it should be.
“Sh—” It might have been an endearment or an admonishment, but either way it ended in a gravelly grunt, a shudder and a shout, and Sherlock let John’s cum fall onto his thigh, to mark him, nevermind the mess.
Sherlock smiled, but sighed, and replied as quick as he could, in order not to leave John any room to change to his mind.
“God, I’m so sorry,” John said automatically, reaching for a metal dispenser and pulling out squares of inadequate-ply paper to mop them with.
Clearing his throat hard, John crossed his arms over his chest and took a half-step sideways. He made his own show of looking for Rosie among her playmates, half-faked a smile at her antics.
John was now stretched out on his back on the flat’s one bed, and he lifted his chest to free up air and raise his heart somewhat higher than his head—the yoga again, mixed with a dose of doctor-heal-thyself—and he inhaled to a count of four, held on for seven, exhaled eight, then texted back,
“If you were, it would already have taken you down,” Sherlock said. John shrugged a bit, had a feeling Sherlock was right. He’d have to look at it some other time. “You use your family’s penchant for alcohol abuse as a way to connect with them, as family togetherness was never a strength. But you’ll never get there, so you should strongly consider just enjoying a drink now and then and not wallowing in angst over it. That’s another sort of abuse.”
“Don’t say it hasn’t been a problem before. Don’t lie to me. I can’t, Sherlock, if you’re going to lie. Not when it comes to him.”
One of her only abnormalities, giving away her lineage, are the long, waving strands of hair, like a mane, traveling up from the pastern of her foot to the back of the cannon of her leg. It’s hair just as white as she is. To some, she could be as dreamy as a unicorn, prancing on long thin legs with a slim chest.
Sherlock smiles. “Exciting. But where will you keep him?” He neglects to ask why, if John’s talk went so well, was Hope on his horse. Doing that would only expose his influence, and irritate John and, maybe, make him think twice about interacting with Sherlock again, which Sherlock cannot afford.
There’s paper crumpled in his dirty, blackened hand. Sherlock looks at him, “I really don’t have time to deal with idiots.”
Finally, abruptly, the Stockyard owner looks up at him. There’s no need for him to squint against the pale sun like he had that day on the beach, after Hope had tried his best at handling Gladstone, and so his gaze is as full of fire as the day that they had first met, face to face, in the stables, with John, and Henry Knight. Even on the beach, there had been Moriarty’s stablehands about, placing charms and flowers and turning the sand, but now. Now, they are entirely alone.
Sherlock turns. Archie is there, peering over the display on his toes. His bright eyes flick from Sherlock to John beside him, and then back. “Are you going down to the beach tomorrow?”
They're back on the populated side of the island, around Skarmouth and near the cliffs that overlook the racing beaches, having ridden Gladstone. The ride was no less exhilarating as it had been before, no less fast, and Sherlock was left breathless again. He cannot think of a time he has felt safer in the darkness on Thisby, more than being on this giant
“Well,” John nods, rocking back on his heels, “you usually aren’t supposed to air someone’s sexual history. Especially in their place of work.
“What did he promise you?” John asks. His voice has lost its edge in his fleeting jealousy and so Moriarty is lured in while John shifts, suddenly uncomfortable.
The rain pounds harder, Moriarty’s face betrays surprised delight, water rushing all down his visage.
“Hm?” John hums, stopping to pick up Sherlock’s soaking coat. He squeezes it, too much material to wring, and water pours from it.
Sherlock imagines the shape of the bullet that will explode from the barrel, imagines the shape it would make in a
Really, he should’ve donated the thing to a blasted charity shop. After this case, he could likely convince Lestrade to pick it up again.
John shakes his hand neatly, flicking blood to the ground. The dagger had dragged evenly against John’s palm. Sherlock had seen the line of red so clearly. And from his own finger, he knows the blade is wicked.
Sherlock feels the shameful heat crawl over the back of his neck, swept away by the breeze a moment later, under such scrutiny.
He doesn’t intend to risk his scene privileges being revoked due to perceived insanity (although certain officers, read: Donovan and Anderson and that photographer Sherlock insulted last week, would be pleased) because he depends on the knowledge of a self-proclaimed magical knight.
Redbeard twists, afraid. To make up for this, Sherlock stares up at the blond rider, as the water horse is pulled to Redbeard’s side.
He has enough money to enter the Races. The fee is fifty, to be paid when he signs up at the Hawkins Tavern.
John pulls away after a moment. He searches for Sherlock’s gaze with an open expression, but Sherlock has dropped his eyes to the ground.
her hooves tearing at the uneven clumps of long grass, until they hit the edge of the cliff, John pulls away, and the horse goes leaping off of it, back legs kicking and skin already starting to shimmer. Over the wind and the drop of the cliffs, against the black, he can’t hear or view the impact of her body against the water.
John points to the case of glass in front of them. Inside are the infamous Thisby daggers, long, crystalline, and glittering under a display light. Thin blades are polished to obsessive perfection. Their history is short and bitter. Made and magicked for harming competing
John doesn’t glance up from where he’s peering into Redbeard’s mouth, hands holding the horse’s red lips apart. Redbeard snorts, shaking his head to get free. John releases him. “He’s had a front tooth knocked loose.”
“I’m not accusing you. Just asking,” John assures him. His hand runs up and down over Sherlock’s ribs, easing Sherlock out of his surprised state. “Er - not with a man.”
Sherlock scans the sheet when she hands it over, front and back. “Keep it,” Janine notes, tapping her fingers lightly on the counter.
“Don’t touch it!” Lestrade says, appalled. Sherlock continues to stick his gloved fingers into the wound, anyways.
Maybe they won't even let him sign up. Like yesterday, at the beach, where the bowler hat with the low eyebrows and the blonde mare took one look at him, and denied him fifths. At least he isn't dressed up this time. He’s in clothing as casual as everyone else. He feels as though he's trying too hard to look the part, like anyone who looks at him will be able to tell that he doesn't belong here.
This is the exact spot where Anderson had called Sherlock’s name the night of the festival and thrown his sea wish over his shoulder, into the ocean.
Water batters and roars, lunging and taking. Very much a hungry wolf. The blood from the morning Races were not enough to quell it for another year. It needs more.
Sherlock looks at him, his undersea eyes mere grey in the sickening hospital lights. “Waited for what, John?”
The entire outfit is carved where it folds and curves and drapes, and painted to distinguish it from the rest of the figure.
“Sherlock!” He exclaims. Anderson, inside the office, glances up from his postage-sorting, and makes eye contact with Sherlock as Lestrade goes on, “Where have you been? I don’t know where the bloody file’s gone!”
Beside him, shoulder to shoulder, John is frowning. He is, no doubt, thinking about Mary. Mike goes on. “And it isn’t like the gamblers on Thisby are very
beyond any islander’s. His whispers to Gladstone to keep him grounded on the sand, and his whispers to Sherlock.
His whole being shifts when they retreat downstairs and step onto a sagging porch, surveying the backyard.
He’s afraid of speaking because he could bite off his tongue each time Gladstone lurches forwards and to the ground.
He is beginning to see the extent that Moriarty has been watching him, the limits of his obsession. Any and all visits to Mrs Hudson’s house must’ve been all for Sherlock’s benefit. Toying with John and Gladstone, another.
Sherlock arranges his head on John’s shoulder. He rests a hand on John’s bare stomach, watching the fill of John’s lungs expand his chest, rising and falling, lulling and captivating. Repetitive, deep,
The blonde mare has put him off too much. There's no way to quantify or expect their behaviors, they're too unpredictable.
But another voice echoes through Sherlock’s head simultaneously. John, saying how Gladstone had never belonged to him, had also never belonged to Moriarty, how they all belonged to Thisby.
Sherlock’s bad leg, sliced from the Races this morning, gives out, unable to provide him with traction enough to extract himself. Sherlock frantically tries to knee Moriarty in the solar plexus, but the other man holds him down, seemingly aware of his weakness.
Sherlock snags his mobile from the counter and checks the address Lestrade sent to him, scanning in his head the memorized crime rates for the area. He tucks it away and strides out the flat’s door, stopping to lock it as a sidenote to Mycroft’s lackeys.
John reaches high up to pat Gladstone’s neck, where his white mane lies in seven flat braids. John’s hand comes away wet with salt-slick, but he touches Sherlock’s face lovingly with it anyways. Sherlock scoffs and wipes the
She is almost more fish than water horse. There is a wide circle around her, men dare not approach, to the disdain of the monger, who must be trying to sell for next year with no luck. The
Sherlock doesn’t bother to pretend he’s annoyed at having been woken up. Doesn’t even act begrudgingly when John tips his head up for a kiss.
He bends at the waist, poking through the storage. Calligraphy ink, aged tin boxes with paper memorabilia, a packet of collected stamps. He pulls open another drawer with a worn handle. "Ah!"
John turns back around, crossing his arms and tucking his fingers against his waistcoat. “This is illegal,” he comments. Still, he watches out, as Sherlock instructed.
Sherlock’s feet come free of the sand, and he wades, pushing hard against the weight of the water. It feels like he’s being pushed back. Still, he gives up on keeping his arms dry and instead uses them to push himself further to the shore. Beneath his feet, the sand shifts and the water he touches tries to drag him to the depths of the shallows.
He retreats, and sits atop the cliffs, next to the leaning conifer and its orange carpet of fallen pine needles (he thinks about the
He throws the reins over Gladstone’s head as the stallion ducks it, rounding to Gladstone’s massive shoulder to hand them up to Sherlock.
Sherlock diligently watches John’s face for another weathered twitch or nervous smile. John’s strudy blue eyes squint against the bright clouds and wind, but nothing else. Sherlock follows him into the cave, the rocks beneath his boots crunching against each other with ever step. Were it high tide, the pair of them might have to swim inside, but now they can walk in with only minimally dampening their shoes.
engraved on the face, beneath the glass. He smirks. And then he wonders if Watson’s still got the shell in his pocket, from yesterday. He wonders what it means. It won’t do well to ask. He was eavesdropping, and he wasn’t a part of that conversation...
Sherlock would not be holding his breath for John to actually take him up on the offer. Anyway, he had a case to solve.
Sherlock began unbuttoning his shirt cuffs. “What does he know? He’s only a professional speech writer,” he snarked. “You’re the expert on your own life story, and where the good bits are in it.”
were you doing under—” John began, muttering between tight teeth as they strode down the corridor past closed classroom doors. “No, forget it, I don’t care.”
The card he produced from nowhere John could see bore his name, the fake title, and an email address. It was no more illuminating than the man himself, and John tucked it into the breast pocket of his shirt.
The same group he and John had met previously—minus a few, plus a few others—welcomed him to take a seat at their corner of the bar. He ordered a silly drink, eavesdropped on the half-shouted conversation—some friendly gossip, the usual complaints about jobs—and eventually followed some of his new friends to the dance floor, grateful for the opportunity to move. He dreaded to think what his weigh-in would look like his first day back in the training room after a week of indulgent food and fewer than usual workouts. The two women who joined him on the small but crowded floor were young, probably recent university graduates working one last fun job before entering the real-world workforce—their version of a season in the minors—but the man was an adult, probably near Sherlock’s age, a local with a shaved head and an almost comically stereotypical muscle-queen physique: muscles created in a gym, fed a powdered diet, and built for display rather than practical use. He rested a hand on Sherlock’s hip as they moved in time to a song not quite familiar enough for Sherlock to place.
It’s obvious from this statement that the thief from the other night slipped it into the evidence locker before looking for the files.
John is limping. Faintly. Left leg. Something jumps in Sherlock's throat - he caused this fight, he did, somehow, he was distracted and the mare took advantage and snapped at the stray, and with the taste of blood was impossible to calm, she hurt John and it’s his fault.
His gaze darts beyond Sherlock, where they hear the sound of John approaching, and then freezing when he sees the man at the other end of the alley.
“Here,” John said, stopping at the heavy overhang before the caves are eclipsed by the cliffs. “I used to watch the horses come up here, all together.” He extends his hand to gesture to the reckless Scorpio Sea, which waves hungrily back.
Together, in the slope of the saddle, John’s front presses heavily against Sherlock’s back, but not overly so. It's… comfortable. He can feel, against his lower back, the points of John’s hip, and the soft part of his stomach. Half of his weight must come from the angle that the saddle is pushing him to, it’s not made for two riders, but Sherlock feels as though he is also leaning quite a bit...
He's infuriated by Moriarty. Infuriated the man would take the island priest’s car up to Mrs Hudson’s home and sit down in the cellar with her and Mrs Turner, infuriated he has no connection with Moriarty at all and yet he and the rest of Thisby are unable to escape his influence, leaking into every house and bank account. Infuriated by the nerve, infuriated with Father Stamford for lending it to the man. If he thinks back to the event, he’s sure he caught some of the man’s lingering cologne in the air, heavy and fragrant.
Sherlock reclines on the mattress, half-covered with the duvet. There’s a mysterious dried stain on top of it, so Sherlock resolutely drops down to the pillows, closing his eyes and listening to the sounds of John’s puttering at the stove. Clack of the burner, clatter of the kettle placed over it. Cabinet open, box of teabags, cabinet closed.
Maybe one day I will write more in this universe, as I have some ideas for little sequels. I think the boys have been left in the perfect spot. Thank you so much! :) I hope you enjoyed my deeply overblown, purple prose for almost 200k words, because magic/fantasy is my one true love and I will be writing more of that.
Gladstone blows back, deeper and longer. Then he jerks his chin back against his long neck, as if sheepish at his introduction.
He draws her into a brief embrace. Her thin arms come up to encircle him, and then he pulls away. “At the end,” He repeats. She nods, looking teary-eyed but not frail, clinging to his coat in her hands. Sherlock turns back to his companion for assistance. “John?”
Sherlock holds the door ajar for John, and they slip inside. It’s bright, it’s always lit in here, and Sherlock gathers himself from the brisk weather in the shelter of the warm, open foyer. There’s the room with the pews in front of them, and out here, glass cases, plaques, commemorative benches to sit, statues, candelabras and lanterns, and ancient paintings of Epona decorate the foyer. The culturally significant pieces of artwork are on display behind thicker glass in cabinets that can withstand the non-stop exposure to light and cold. It’s more like a museum, out here, than the entrance to a place of worship.
Sherlock lets him, standing even and still with his back to the cliffs, ocean blowing in his coat from behind, rain throwing his hair.
, how to shorten the straps and keep your chin tucked, neck protected while you lean forward over the horn of the saddle. John’s seen Sherlock dismount, and he merely leaps off. It should be stupid, but it’s always so graceful.
More water horses, the colors of all the pebbles on the seashore, had slowed in their running and were ripping at one another around the dead man, bleeding out into the waves, pulling cries from the younger audience as they tore at him. What did these visitors expect? Others raced on, fighting as they went, but they were few in number.
Sherlock slips his shoes on over his socks. He brushes down his suit jacket, tweaking the edge of the lapel notch.
“I need to speak with you,” John says, coming up by his arm, and gripping him by the elbow. John’s hands are bare to the cold, “I know the letter is pressing, but so is this.”
Something incredibly secretive is lurking between his lungs, eating away at the cartilage that holds his ribs together even now, in these gentle minutes. It pounds a Scorpio rhythm on the underside of his sternum, persistent and enormous.
Sherlock hasn’t thought of Hope very much. The idea that John is riding on a man-killer’s back has not been wasted on Sherlock’s vast intellect, but there’s nothing to say for worrying. Hope, as John would likely put it, had gotten what was coming to him.
Now, the champion water horse waits apart from them, watching the gathering of islanders, and reins in the hands of churchgoer that John says he trusts. Gladstone is invisible in the dark, a floating white mane and a ghostly tail. His eyes reflect the bonfire’s fading light, the only evidence that he exists at all.
Each morning, at sunrise, Sherlock sees a single man. Short, choppy light hair that reflects the sun, clothed in dark colors. The man limps from fence to fence, as if he's the only worker awake, turning in or out the sport horses and island ponies; yearlings or stallions or broodmares. Past sunrise, when Sherlock rides back from the mill and heads towards Skarmouth once more, slow with a full grain cart, he sees the man again, watching other stable boys or skirting through pasture. There are a few more men working in the stables or grooming the horses, waiting for mainland buyers to arrive for appointments to judge the newly born island ponies.
Sherlock. His lip wants to curl up in a sneer against the shunting wind. And it's another moment before he is affected by the mention of siblings, for his own is long gone.
Lestrade crossed his arms, the movement bunching the coat by his elbows, tapping his fingers delicately on it. He widened his stance, glowering at Sherlock. “I’m not picking it up again.”
A moron would suspect the tarts. It could be true. The wind gusts down the narrow alleyway, cold and biting at Sherlock’s exposed ears. He tucks some curly hair behind one.
It’s only around twenty minutes later, when he has reached the high cliffs by the racing beaches, that he starts to wonder this, John not immediately being present, is retribution for his absence several days ago.
JW: I think only for however long it took Sherlock to pop his head up and say, “It’s me.” I didn’t regret it at all on my own behalf, but I had a shiver of, Is he going to be OK with this? Because of course, it isn’t my place to publicly out anybody, even my own partner.
Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes. He wanted to snap back that he hadn’t played at a ‘basics’ level since before he grew hair on his bollocks.
“Thank you, no,” Sherlock told him. “So commences two days of recipe testing,” he said, in a tone that made plain he looked forward to the culinary adventure.
“I’m expecting him momentarily,” Sherlock prodded, and John stepped aside to allow him in. Walking straight to the little table where John had been sitting with his laptop and cup of tea, Sherlock slapped the computer shut and tucked it between a small rubbish bin and the wall. He gulped down the last of the tea, grimaced because it was cold, then dropped the mug in the bin.
Perhaps he was trying to solve a puzzle that couldn’t be solved. Missing pieces, pieces changing shape, an unclear picture even if he could assemble it. What did he need? Nourishment, respite, fulfillment of bodily urges? All of those. If sex with John as not merely a complicating mistake, what was it? An intimate bond. An easy understanding. A reminder of the two of them at their best. Perhaps proof not all was lost? The logical next question,
They had barely set their suitcases down beside the inviting, white-sheeted bed before they were stripping off, sliding into swimsuits they’d had the foresight to put in the front pocket of John’s carry-on, sprinting down the length of their private cove into the crystal blue, Caribbean sea. Sherlock looked back at the teak-and-glass pavilion, tall sliding doors between the sun deck and the ocean-view bed purposely left wide open. Native plants flourished and bowed to shelter three sides of the little building, gifting shade and heady floral aromas riding the gentle ocean breeze as it teased at the sheer white draperies. Behind a lattice wall stood a deep, wide bathtub Sherlock resolved he and John would make excellent use of, at least once.
Sherlock sat back, hid his I’ll-be-damned, “Hunh,” with a downward tilt of his head, using the bill of his ball cap to shadow his face. Years back, when he first got clean, he’d relied on meditation, self-talk, his mantra,  intent on breathing in, then breathing out—with purpose and attention—to keep him grounded. The habits had faded over time, replaced with other, less time- and focus-consuming rituals. Equipment checks. Waiting by the dressing room door to lead the team up the tunnel. Roughing up his crease and banging his stick against the posts. Knowing as he did that everything is as it should be, Sherlock recognised that absently adding a few minutes just breathing to his mental list of to-do’s was not idle mind-chatter. He was giving himself advice. Worth a try, if it could help straighten up his game. He’d make time for it.
It sinks well into the floorboards underneath Shadwell. She is speared into her own home. Blood is soaked into the shag she rests on, black and dried, and a rose of it blooms through her blouse. This was the single killing blow. One slash, a thrust, and death.
He doesn’t even try to brush it away - although there may be some residual irritation that Sherlock hadn’t told him what had happened with Moriarty earlier, most of his thoughts towards the other man are gentle.
Very aware of Gladstone’s presence and the blood on his still quivering muzzle, Sherlock plays dumb. John is fantastic when he’s clarifying something. He pulls higher on the broken reins, and Gladstone’s face turns, mouth closed, one eye regarding Sherlock. “Of what?”
John glances over from his armchair, setting his newspaper down. He squints at Sherlock, then the chemistry equipment on the dining table, then the general clutter of their very private house. He goes back to his reading, a knowing smile on his lips.
and Gladstone’s screaming, in a way that makes John himself sound much less heroic than what he had really been, and Sherlock much more.
“It was taken from your figurine by someone. And it was - changed. Then, an indeterminate amount of time later, between 1938 and now, it was sold, possibly through several people, but it ended up in the hands of my murderer. A sword like that’s going to be expensive. Museum-quality.”
“Sherlock.” His voice is rough, wrapped in razor wire. Concern over Sherlock’s silence. “You did it. You won.”
John glances at him after Gladstone is in his stall once more, a clear concern. The lights above them illuminate the stable hands in the stalls, working on shoveling more warm hay into the stalls of island ponies and feeding the night-going
Now, he rips open the top of the envelope completely. The scratch of torn paper is carried away on the air.
John stares at him, and then he tucks his chin and starts that lovely giggle of his, and it makes him younger, and Sherlock doesn’t attempt to hold back the wonky grin pulling at his own lips. John smoothes back his hair, still giggling, and Sherlock tips his head for a kiss. John obliges, dry and brisk, and then gets up for the kettle.
Unable to do anything at all - right or wrong. Sherlock counted backwards from ten and John stood in place. He would never simply stand there.
Does the tide tire of ebbing? Does the ocean tire of the salt? Sherlock Holmes could never tire of John Watson, not when John Watson is exactly what Sherlock Holmes has always needed. A conductor of light to call him
(the 'He doesn't invite Sherlock to be one of them.', and the 'Which is how they end up racing.' lines are right from the Scorpio Races novel, and they do race each other in the book - please read it!)
? I talked with Moriarty, Sherlock. He told me he wanted to eat your heart out. Do you-- do you know how that felt?”
Sherlock blows in his ear. John smacks him with a pillow. It’s all the most wondrous thing that’s ever happened to Sherlock.
In the sitting room he hears John and his landlady chatting about… whatever ordinary people chat about. The weather, he supposes, or Mrs Hudson is fawning over John’s racing record. Sherlock doesn’t care, so long as Mrs Hudson doesn’t break out some sort of old photo album she must keep under lock and key (not that it couldn’t be picked). He needs to change this horrible clothes.
No one’s asked him, not really, because no one on the island cares enough to ask. But that’s not what John means. John means,
John is usually so simple to read. Sherlock wishes that were true now, the champion is so suddenly unreadable. His expression has softened, but not changed dramatically. He's still looking down onto the beaches, where sandpipers are picking at the rocks. In a few minutes they'll realize their efforts are fruitless, and return to the sandy side of the island. He longs to take John’s face in his hands, feel his skin, the way he had when John saved him from the grey
A high-pitched shriek cut short by a violent rattling of bells - whipping around, Sherlock sees Gladstone rearing, but besides the gasps of the crowd and their school-of-fish-like movement backwards a collective few steps, the only important person on the beach is quiet. Gladstone lands, sending a surge of outrage through the sand that gusts over Sherlock, betraying the water horse’s displeasure.
The long box finds his hand mid-deduction as he’s spouting to a clueless Lestrade, and an irritated Anderson and Sally Donovan. They’re all standing around a dead man in a long blonde wig, lying prone on the floor of the amphitheater's stage.
Or, Sherlock could win the Races and buy Mrs Hudson twenty new homes from James Moriarty himself, get to the mainland and drag an answer out of Mycroft, and settle back at home, with plenty of killings to investigate, water horses to avoid, oranges to eat, and Redbeard adorned in a winning garland of green carnations and him in a bouquet of indigo and lilac.
“What are you doing here?” Watson asks. It is a question, not a demand. Sherlock’s spine goes rigid all the same.
Sherlock’s mouth pops open. He spends a minute visually raking over the overgrown acre of open land and tired, chipped fencing, unable to comprehend the little dilapidated white boxes sticking out from all the weeds. “John,” he says, “you have
Without moving his hands from Sherlock’s face, John glances over to Gladstone, and from where his forehead is now pressed against John’s cheek, Sherlock can feel the rise of a grin.
“In October? Oh, not in October. I’m Martha Hudson, but you can call me Mrs Hudson, Doctor Watson. He did once try to climb—” but Sherlock has stopped listening to Mrs Hudson because John is sweeping over the back of his neck with the warm towel. He can feel the ridges of the edges of the towel against his skin, gooseflesh being soothed softly away. He blinks.
He walks away, posh shoes dipping the sand as he climbs elegantly back up the hill and out of the cove.
They climb the long staircase. Lestrade takes them two at a time. Every step is well-taken care of, no loose nails, no creaking wood, no wobbly posts. Just monstrous carpet.
A hundred memories course through Sherlock. He hadn’t forgotten a thing, but he was too stupid, too hung up on emotions and fear and love that he couldn’t see. Blind. Right there, on Molly Hooper’s front desk. Right there, on the hide of the white mare, right there on Mary’s flank. A blooming purple flower to end horses and humans, a bleeding sigil to do just the same.
“You want to go to the mill for me?” She asks him when he shows up at the bakery. She’s just put a metal pan of cinnamon twists into the oven, and replaced the few stale rolls in the window with a bundle of fresh ones.
Sherlock curls, ribs smashed. Moriarty kneels over him, thighs on either side of Sherlock’s, and holds his collar, throwing back his fist and landing a punch on Sherlock’s cheek, smashing his knuckles into Sherlock’s split lip. Hazy with rain and soreness, fatigue and pain and the cold, Sherlock can’t fight when Moriarty grips him by the shoulders, split knuckles running bloody-wet crimson and fastening into his coat. “No, no,
Moriarty sits behind his expansive desk, at his ornate chair, appearing for anyone like he is engrossed in the book open in his hands before him, the spine balanced under a lean finger. Clearly, he is not reading, but only pretending to skim over the contents for Sherlock’s benefit.
There’s an otherworldly gloss to his face, long and forbidding, black and haunted, painted in broken leather reins.
Fondness builds up in such a tidal wave that Sherlock throws an arm over John’s naked chest. He swings his leg over John’s waist, earning a laugh. Sherlock pushes his face into the crook of John’s neck, half smothering himself in the pillow John’s head is resting on.
They drive for a few more minutes. Sherlock watches the orange of the sky above Skarmouth’s nightlights grow further away through the rearview mirror.
Sherlock’s chest swells a bit, feeling as though he has found a person so in step with his own pace, that the pair of them could never walk apart again.
Sherlock can read the last two days off of him, as if Watson was holding up a neon blinking sign. Spent all of yesterday riding, some bucking horse, because his legs are pressed tight to the side of the water horse to stretch a pulled muscle in the inner thigh. Sherlock knows for a fact more buyers were poking around in the barns yesterday, heard it from Molly. So, Watson spent yesterday showing off horses and being the general entertainment.
There's nothing Sherlock can insult her directly for. Best to insult her judgement, then. Sherlock turns up his nose, spitting, “You sure picked one, too. Dandruff, ginger cat he will like more than you, and …” he looks at the sawdust on the floor, “...a history of erectile dysfunction. Nah, maybe not that good.”
Though he silently leans back against the rock, John is thinking. Sherlock can see it in the shadows under his eyes. Perhaps Hope has forgotten how his last companion died, shot by John in defense of Sherlock and taken over the cliffs on the other side of the island.
“Hm,” John hums, reaching above Sherlock’s head to open a cabinet next to the two-burner stove. “Well, he is a priest. So, both, I suppose.”
He stops by the tavern, wading through the tight knot of tourists’ bodies, all pressed close together and reeking of beer the nearer and nearer they are packed. His racing odds are now 47 to 1. No one is betting on him. The smart men are putting their money on John Watson, and the returning champion horse of five years.
nearby. It’s a white mare whose gossamer coat seems to be no more pelt than nearly-translucent skin, not unlike many deep-sea fishes.
“No,” John pats the pants and jumper in Sherlock's arms, then reaches forward the snake the towel off of Sherlock’s shoulders. It leaves him cold. “Gladstone’s manure keeps them away.”
Musgrave reappeared sometime during the night. She lays in the expensive hay by the loft, missing half her tail and looking significantly less excited to explore the island as she usually does. She hisses at Sherlock and at Mrs Hudson for coming near her, but seems overall fine and usual.
they shipped to the mainland, before all the laws and regulations. It’s said that the moment the ferry left Scorpio waters, she withered away. Her bones turned to dust in her pelt, and her hide flaked away. The only thing left of her on the ferry was her harness of bells,” John says. The wind blows his hair back as it funnels in through the stable door, and he squints into it as the screen door clacks against the panels of the house. “She belonged to Thisby and to the Scorpio Sea. They all do. Anywhere else, they do not belong. They’re ours.”
Clouds pass overhead. Two days ago, when Watson was up on the cliffs with him, when Sherlock was at the Stockyard and the gigantic Gladstone was an arm’s length away from him, the sun was out. Sherlock was stupid to think the weather would last. Wind tucks under his jacket sleeves, lifting them away from his arms.
“I held suspicions before, but he said so in our meeting. Mr Haverford’s son was a distraction. The tourist, Redding, was a ploy for attention, a show of his influence. I’m willing to bet the female tourist from last week was, too - murdered by the butcher’s son but doubtlessly orchestrated by Moriarty.”
Moriarty’s knee comes up and he collapses onto Sherlock’s fallen figure, chest-to-chest. Sherlock struggles, pushing back to get out of this crawling, seaweed-breath grasp. It’s impossible to breathe. Moriarty shoves him sideways, digging in with his elbows, and, exhausted and numb, Sherlock clings to Moriarty’s arm.
? There are thousands of antique-selling websites, flea markets, we need to track down where it came from.”
I’ve started my summer job again so that’s taking up a lot of my time, but tune in next chapter for some water horse content (fun) and (finally) some romance!
The face is also carved, not just painted on like some sort of Russian nesting doll. Sherlock can hardly make out the details in the dark. But he sees spots of blue, dry and empty and unfocused for the eyes, a small curve up of black and soft pink for a smirk.
There’s no way Sherlock can lord this over Mycroft if his brother is tried for unethical experimentation. Not like he couldn’t get out of it, though.
He examines the seal. Thick, blood red crimson wax in a pressed circle, the profile of a horse with the brand
“Of course I’ll be needing it.” John looks to Sherlock as if to confirm they aren’t involved in what Mrs Hudson is insinuating, but Sherlock pretends to be aloof and oblivious.
to lean in enough for John to cover him, for John to have his hands against his skin. It occurs to him that he has badly wanted John as close to him as they are now for weeks, ever since he had seen him on that beach with Mary. This horrible wrecking pain and pressure in his chest wasn’t anger, or envy for what John and the island have, it was a terrifying emotion, a heart-breaking
Sherlock clears his throat, pulling the fabric of the dress out gently so he can see the bloodstains. “Yes, it was horrifyingly obvious. I only agree to explain it to you simpletons because I don’t feel as though anyone on the island should purchase their meat from a murderer… Quite a hazard. The
But all of a sudden, where racing day had haunted his every thought, dictated his every move, that's a faraway concern. The immediate one is that Redbeard is shaking and ready to crumble like the cliffs on this side of the island. Racing day won't ever come for him, if he doesn't manage to walk away from this encounter. Redbeard's going to have to settle through much worse behavior from the water horses than a little snapping and hissing.
Sherlock blinks, stunned into silence. His ears ring, his mind draws blankly on how to respond, the world inert, the pain in his leg fading to the sudden, desperate ache in his ribs. “John.”
The cabbie stares at him in the rear-view mirror. Sherlock sees him wondering why he chose to pick up Sherlock of all people in London. Biting back another comment, Sherlock debates rolling down the window to have the wind rush in and drown out any sound John makes.
Mrs Hudson will have to turn him out - she's family, but even she cannot afford to keep him and Redbeard around for so long while getting nothing in return, her teapot business isn’t so successful. Sherlock would not ask that of her. She has her debts - like nearly everyone on the island, she borrowed from the Stockyard to buy her property.
Sherlock stalks across the room, eyes burning against the bright lights, and wedges his fingers beneath the window screen, tugging. Lestrade and Donovan’s heads swivel to watch him. He wrestles with the pane. Locked. Figured. He pivots back, new realizations jumping to the forefront. There was no sneaking involved in the killer's entrance.
Sherlock smirks, “The same way I can read your life off your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits off of your watch…”
John laughs again, lower and without a tinge of malice. “They're only animals. They're not monsters.”
Unlike Beryl, he will never have to put the weight of his bad leg on land again. There will never be pain in his steps. In water, he will be weightless.
are always faster. I don't know what sort of training you're doing, running on the firm sand by the shore, wading through the shallows, running on the rocks or the gravel, chasing the sun, charging back and forth or all over the island. Racing dogs. The
Then the rider’s light hair caught the weak light of the grey sun, and Sherlock didn't relax. A water horse wasn't any less deadly because someone was sitting on it, the Races were enough evidence of that.
Now, John is really grinning. “What’s his name?” He glances back to the shop, stepping to let a few tourists by on their way down the cobblestone walk.
push back into John. John pressed his lips against the back of Sherlock’s neck, just under the collar of his coat, before he had dismounted upon reaching their destination.
Stray dogs whine and scuttle under the cliffs and underfoot. Bells rattle on her saddle and her breastplate as she shifts her weight, preparing to rear.
Sherlock takes stock of when he last saw Mrs Turner, and, no, she’s fine, too, because she waved to him just twenty minutes ago, when he passed her sheep farm on Redbeard. He waved back.
Hope’s smile is sickening, and he is climbing onto the rock, shoving his hands into the holds and hauling himself up top. There’s a little discourse in the crowd at this. It has always been one rider on the rock at a time. Adler doesn’t move for him, she stays as still as Watson on the other side. She’s unwavering. This is her place, and not Hope’s. He shouldn’t be up here.
He hears the chair squeal over the floor when John sits down at the kitchen table. He must thank Epona for the fact that Mrs Hudson cleared it of all experiments before they arrived last night. Otherwise, John might think him too peculiar to associate with. Sherlock hums, passing by an ugly pea-green suit coat that used to be Mycroft’s. It’s much too big for him. He decides on a black jacket, taking extra long debilitating his choices so that John can eat the plate Mrs Hudson made for him without guilt of holding him up.
A gull cries at him. Sherlock looks up, and sees the headline on the underside of its paper belly outlined against the dark grey sky --
Although Sherlock’s face never stopped burning since the beginning of this encounter, it flushes deeper. John is simple and edgeless, surely not
He closes the book, and sets it down on the coffee table again. Last night he had berated Mrs Hudson for snooping through his things, and here he sits, doing the same to John Watson.
John sidles up. The material of his waistcoat obscenely drags against Sherlock’s bare chest. John’s hands tip Sherlock’s closer, digging into his waist as if under the impression Sherlock will bruise like a peach. The physicality of it, the idea that there may be a real reminder of this event when it is over, sends a shock of arousal through his body.
Another illusion drawn by Moriarty. As if Thisby isn’t always cold and unwelcoming. Thisby cares nothing for love and only for bravery.
Watson nods. It’s the same terse thing that Sherlock saw him do back at the beach, with the blonde mare, to the man with the black hair that had pulled Sherlock away from the danger.
“But he's not a woman, doesn't even want to be one, he just likes to dress like one occasionally. That's all - he wouldn't put lipstick on before going to Hooper’s. Before going to Hooper’s, he would've taken it off. A shower would’ve gotten rid of it, so he didn’t shower the night before or that morning.”
A man standing astride her, in the bowler hat, her handler, yanks down on her braided rope, and the mare’s song is abruptly cut off.
Footsteps, then John shouts from a little further down the street, away from the open line of the ocean. It’s all black to Sherlock. “Over here! Follow my voice!”
was bad,” he says. “It showed me what a madman you are. I had my suspicions before,” John pushes Sherlock’s shirt down and away, allowing it to join his coat, wrapping around Sherlock’s hips and crowding close. Nerves at his exposure flit down Sherlock’s side. “But that sealed it. I was gone - you were brilliant.”
,” Sherlock admonishes, offended. Mycroft would look down his long nose at his choice, raise a lip, and sneer that a life at the mill was better than no life at all. There is no room to disagree with his brother. He could ask Mrs Hudson to let Mycroft know if he dies, but it’s no use, he recalls that was the whole point of racing in the first place.
He thinks of swallows and terns and can only picture them dipping through the air to nests hidden in Stockyard barns, or slipping against wind along the cliffs, where John and he had raced, their red underbellies and strange two-note songs. When he thinks of his own survival come the first of November, his thoughts lead to Mary and Gladstone, hot breath and flat teeth and the dead dog, and the white mare with the emblem that had knocked John to the sand. Even picturing Mrs Hudson is no good, because he is only reminded of how she fawned over John.
Again, again with the questions! Apparently, his participation in the Races has triggered the let’s-question-Sherlock-till-we-faint disease across Thisby! Molly, and, and, and Janine Hawkins at her bloody tavern, and Irene's stupid lipsticked face at the rider’s parade last night! And now Watson!
Held by a thick man with dark hair and patience in his gaze, is a giant black stallion with a striking white mane and tail.
Watson looks at the horse’s long, thin ears, and then reaches forward with his almighty grin, and twists one back, so hard it must hurt. Sherlock nearly winces in phantom pain. The water horse does nothing, doesn’t even make a noise.
“Are you going to make him walk home in the dark? In October - really, Sherlock?” She erupts, as upset as if John Watson were her own son and Sherlock were trying to kill him. Sherlock reaches up to scrub the towel over the wet back of his head. Were the wind chill any lower, he’s sure his hair would be glazed with ice.
“It’ll only be an hour, can you part with me for an hour?” John rushes through this sentence. John’s continued closeness, and his body language, suggest that it’s
The upstairs ‘rooms’ were visible underneath the roof, complete with tiny lamps and tables and beds. The same craftsman that built the base clearly had their hands in the internal structure. An incoming text sounded on his mobile, stirring Sherlock out of his wonderings. Sherlock replaced the roof, rose, and shut the door behind him, careful to not damage the castle or wake Mrs Hudson.
“Better?” John asks, tossing the cloth somewhere onto the floor. It’s clear he isn’t thinking ahead, about how it will be to find that in the morning. John likely won’t care much, he might laugh about it, or his ears will turn that lovely shade of scarlet that they are now as his thoughts circle to what secret has just transpired.
no equal. Nothing but bleak island air and mystical killer horses, no one special to shower his attentions upon.
quarrel, like a nest of eels in the coral. They’re quick bites, frantic shrieks, a preamble of what is to come.
This really does seem like the same figure the Langely girl gave to him. Could Mycroft have overheard that conversation long enough to catch the phrase
What had that secret conversation been about? Why would Sherlock promise anything to Moriarty for John’s sake? Hadn’t John done enough for him, essentially kicking him off the racing beaches in those first few days? Or maybe Sherlock felt indebted somehow, and as John has observed he’s a man who doesn’t like to have outstanding debts. The questions race in John’s mind just as quickly as they had last night in Sherlock’s sitting room.
Mike stops. He’s sweating, expression glowing in the candlelight, and he wets his lips. Nerves. Terrible nerves. He pats his forehead with the back of his hand absently. “He wasn’t betting on his son, John, look.”
“You’re looking for a man in his sixties with a grey, long-haired cat, who knew Shadwell prior to murdering her. He came here with the sword and she wasn’t alarmed because, at first, she thought she’d be purchasing it. She allowed him to walk right in her house, so they've met before. Otherwise, think about it, you would greet someone at the door. After last week, it’s clear that he arrived with the intention of murdering her. Wasn’t a deal gone bad, it was a plan gone
The idea sweeps away in the cool night air, gone as the breeze that rushes over the both of them through the cement aisle. It skitters loose pieces of hay out the other end. A
A panic closes Sherlock’s throat. The ambience of the scene before him clogs his nose and mouth, the miasmic feel of heavy clouds and of the churning black water. All of it is chilling, and the horses pounding down the sand are now haunting instead of informative.
Mrs Hudson frowns. The low light catches on her thin lips, and she looks down, brushing the hay dust from her skirts, “I paint teapots for the tourists, it hardly counts. I’d help, Sherlock, but I don't have the kind of money Mister Anderson wants. The rich people are all involved with the Races.”
Fingers curl into his hair, scratch lightly at his scalp. Sherlock shivers when they trace over the crown of his head, then hums his assent when they massage behind his ear.
The horse snaps its neck back and screams, piercing and agonizing, and it jumps. Its knees crumple as seaweed spills out its nose, and it dives, and disappears beneath the surface of the water. A second later, it reemerges and rears, shrieking and somewhere, distantly, people are yelling. It leaps, and a wayward hoof knocks into John Watson, and when it shoves down, the rider is under the water.
The man on its back is grinning wide, and something sharp gleams long in his hand. If Sherlock pulls back, they would lose too much momentum and never catch up with the group plowing ahead. He whips the reins, hard, and the pinch of pain snaps Redbeard out of his panic. His legs lift and plummet down with ferocity.
, dropping away from John’s body heavily as if to point at him. Previous incidents suggested the measurements, but Sherlock finds himself intimidated, anyways.
more hints at sabotage, more murder, more moriarty, more racing. .... sorry for such a long wait!! I always have most of the next chapter written, and then the pieces just don't fit together for another half a year :/ I got this - and this won't be abandoned! I love it tooooo much! thank you for reading <3 A VERY LONG CHAPTER!!! like... 7k..... good luck lmao
“She doesn’t believe I fenced at school, either,” was Sherlock’s reply, his attempt at commiseration, and not too wide of the mark. “Even after I showed her the plaques.”
“True enough,” he allowed. “Going off resort grounds isn’t really encouraged, so most of the employees here and at the other two resorts nearby end up at our place, Mirage—have you and Mr Watson been?”
“Oh, Sherlock. You’re so seldom home,” Mrs Holmes protested. Immune to her whinges, Sherlock stood firm.
John finished massaging his feet, moved on to more-than-softly sliding the knuckles of one fist up and down Sherlock’s calf muscles. He’d toed off his loafers and set his sock feet on the coffee table, slumped deeper into the sofa. They stayed there sharing the comedown from their days until the buzzer went, and John brought in bags of dinner delivered from the second-nearest Japanese restaurant, all of John’s usual favourites, but only raw fish and miso broth for Sherlock. Nothing fried; no rice. He’d only just missed his upper-limit weigh-in, with less two pounds to spare. He knew he had much work to do before the pre-season started and his stats were published on the players’ roster.
“That’s true, and not something you often see in life-cycle presentations. Thank you for sharing it.” The mother and grandmother smiled, and Rosie’s chin went a bit higher.
John burped a laugh. An eighteen year old Macallan whisky must run close to two hundred quid. “Yeah, I’d say that could be OK. If you don’t have anything better.” He smiled at his own joke and decided to take a seat in the threadbare red armchair across from Sherlock’s preferred seat. He admired the decor, and his eye was caught by what was on the television, a local news moment interviewing people-on-the-street about where they were last Christmas, and where they planned to be for this one.
Sherlock went through his motions as the music blared for the warm-ups, bending his knees, snapping his wrist to catch pucks fired at him by his teammates, stretching upright and then settling into his crouch, rattling his stick against the goal posts—left, right, left—and tossing his head on his neck. He stopped puck after puck, then went to the bench for a final equipment check and to wait for the start. The first game of the season on home ice meant an introduction of the whole team, not just the starters; Sherlock hated the delay but enjoyed his moment in the spotlight, the low, growling cry of “
Steven the real estate developer, not pacing so much as stalking the room to mark his territory. Sherlock had offered his road schedule and Steven arranged a trip—under what pretense Sherlock neither knew nor cared—to meet him in Vancouver. Not the team hotel; Steven had booked a five-star suite elsewhere, upscale but generic—with the drapes pulled shut to cover the skyline, they could have been anywhere in the world. Sherlock shrugged away the offer, but Steven was already pouring—tequila in a shot glass, predictably mundane.
Sherlock hummed. He shuffled sideways between the gurney and the wall to slide his fingertips through her hair, which she must have loosened from what he’d told himself was a pretty good Dutch plait when he’d woven it that morning.
“Yes, CRUZR is just chockablock with horny lumberjacks and moose-ranchers,” Sherlock affirmed. “I’ve cast a wide net.”
“Let me know if anything changes, otherwise I’ll plan to pick her up Tuesday after school,” John said to the floor as he shrugged into his coat. Back to business. All for the best.
Sherlock nodded reassurance. “It’s fine; I understand. I just worry you didn’t get a chance to relax.”
John was dozing, exhausted from a day’s work and blissfully sated from an evening in Sherlock’s narrow bed. Through the strange silence of the house late at night, he heard the distant chiming of a tall clock in the Colonel’s withdrawing room, through shut doors and down winding steps, felt more than counted the twelve tones, and knew he must rouse himself before he fell asleep–once too often he’d been petted awake by Sherlock’s smooth, cool hand on his arm or chest, hissing whispers that it’s nearly morning, you must go. Better to go now.
Eventually they rearranged limbs and pillows and found each other’s sour mouths for deep, probing kisses. John held Sherlock by the jaw and wiped the cum from his face with a corner of the sheet, dirty-smiling and giving a wink that made Sherlock wrap arms around and pull him close, heaving out the final sigh of the night.
“Mycroft?” John ventured, and at last their embrace softened, and they drifted apart. Sherlock drew a handkerchief from the pocket of his dressing gown and passed it to John, who scrubbed the corners of wet, weary eyes.
,” John said, with some measure of pride in his voice. “Can’t wait to see you Tuesday. I’m trying to get on an earlier flight.”
“Well, that line of discourse has proven effective,” Sherlock said, glancing at his lap. “For you as well?”
Sherlock's "perfect words" were very much influenced by the sentiments expressed in Kristeen Young's
JW: I think everyone was so involved in celebrating the Cup win, even though chatter went around the room pretty quickly, it wasn’t really top of everyone’s mind. We got some handshakes and pats on the back on break-up day. I got some nice emails and texts.
There was a late-night coffee place just several minutes’ walk from the flat; John used the time to compose his thoughts. He ordered tea and was surprised to have to look for a seat; the place was full of students with open laptops and dark-circled eyes, couples lingering so their dates wouldn’t have to end, an older fella with too many bags on the floor beside his feet. John unbuttoned his coat but didn’t take it off, dragged out a wooden chair from beneath the edge of a metal-topped table and drew out his phone. Despite the hour, accepting that he was unlikely to get a reply, he texted his therapist.
that have plenty of personal space, guided by their prepped and fashionable riders, flashing charmed braids and saddles in Thisby colours, iron bits and flower petals.
IN THIS CHAPTER, we have some more moriarty being suspicious, some crime-solving with our friend mike the priest, and something SCANDALOUS coming next chapter! Can i say how much i love writing Moriarty’s creepy ass? And can you spot the couple of ACD canon quotes thrown into the mix? http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/James_Moriarty  here’s the version of snow white that moriarty has ! https://germanstories.vcu.edu/grimm/schneeeng.html
He's distantly aware of a jacket draped over his shoulders, leaving his arms uncovered. He's shivering. His wet hair drips potent saltwater down the back of his sodden collar.
Interested, Sherlock raises his brows. Still gripping the paper for dear life, John says, “I had to haggle with him over Gladstone again. But. He mentioned you. He said if I took Gladstone and you, he’d never be able to ‘eat his heart’.” Sick, John looks at him for answers, “I don’t know whether he meant Gladstone or you.”
Sherlock refuses to let anyone touch his leg, not even to let them hide it for newspapers. “This is what the Races look like. Photograph that,” he argues, which ends the stream of people wanting to take his picture.
Finally, Sherlock drops the bomb. “This man is John Watson, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock hushes, pressed for time before John makes another reappearance. His eyes dart to the bathroom hall even now.
An impression of a thought floats to him, the inciting consideration of John’s cock fitting into him.
Sherlock retreats from the castle on the floor and snags his laptop off of the coffee table. He sits back down in the same spot over the carpet, brushing away his burnt-out cigarette and flaring out the dressing gown behind him, balancing the laptop on his knees. "Yes, I'm sure children more readily accept a toy come to life."
How Moriarty had stood there, drinking it all in, knowing Sherlock was playing into his hands. Stupid, stupid.
“Come on, icicle,” John soothes quietly, standing. The drums have faded into background noise, faraway, probably halfway across town. “We’d best get you back to that old sheep farm of yours.”
How terrifying it must be for someone to be here while a water horse shares the same space. He can imagine it now; standing on the ridge that is just over his head, back against the rock, the tide creeping around the pillars and the cave, coming to wash at his feet. And the sudden sounds of kittens mewling, babies crying, a whale song from underwater, emanating from only lengths away. The way it would pound in the ear and reverberate in the lungs...
“You’re right, I can’t get rid of you. I’d quit noticing things altogether if you went away. Stop it, you’re tickling my ear.”
Not on the street that leads there directly, but it's there. A great set of barns and stables not too far from Sherlock, well-kept fencing that holds ordinary sport horses that get auctioned off to the mainlanders in the weeks leading up to the Races surrounding the property, rolling over rocky crags and even hills of green grass. The stone walls by the road mark the beginning of Moriarty’s property. Thisby is divided by things that Moriarty has a hand in, and things he does not.
patting the horse’s shoulder with misplaced fondness. The crowd above is growing louder as the wind lapses. Sherlock hardly breathes, the ocean stealing all his air.
Sherlock says quietly, “Worst case scenario, we get restrained and put in the drunk cells until morning. I never get charged,” he smirks, “My intellect is far too valuable.”
lying! I was afraid Moriarty would do something to him, and I loved him, and I didn’t want anything to happen to him. And I was right, look at Beryl,” John exclaims, “She is just as gone as he is. But you’re here - you’re all that I wanted at the end. You’re all that I needed - you are every wish I could make.”
Perhaps they were wrong, perhaps this was never a spree, and has always been a serial killer. Are there more murders to be attributed to this man, forgotten cases in washed-up evidence lockers?
Thank you so so much for reading, and if you've been following the story for years, thank you especially. :) While writing this, I reread the book several times. Several scenes involved in this fic were inspired from the book, but after the initial set up, the fic sort of breaks away. After all, Sherlock Holmes is Sherlock Holmes, which means murder follows.
Sometimes, in the endless waves that batter the offshore sandbars, the November currents dredge up forgotten things.
He slashes wildly at Sherlock and Redbeard, but he has drawn his horse too close to the water’s edge in his quest to maim Sherlock, and his saddle fails him. The
But Moriarty knows about John already He had merely been testing the waters that morbid day on the beach when they discussed nothing and everything at once. When he wants to disrupt the tide, Moriarty will have the exact tools he needs to do it. Namely, Moriarty knows that Sherlock would give up everything for John -- in this, he holds power.
Here, they are still at the lesser-used portion of the beach, but it is not just John that Sherlock has found. There are many people, and above all of their figures towers Gladstone, with shiny bridle and saddle that is not John’s around his face and over his withers.
.' But John doesn’t say any of that. He glances up at Sherlock from under his brows, tongue peeking out to wet his lips.
John runs an anxious hand through his silver hair. Unsettled, he walks a brisk circle on Sherlock’s palm. Clearly, there is some internal debate waging war through his head.
The waistband of his trousers and pants drags over his cock and elicits another weak, shivery sound from deep in his lungs, and a half-second later the clothing join the rest of the clothes tossed about the flat. John’s thumbs tuck into the curve of Sherlock’s prominent hips, curling his fingers around the soft part of his sides.
column. Then she looks over her shoulder at him, pinned up dark hair contrasting her shining white teeth while she smiles. “What’s your ride’s name, Sherl?”
“You don’t have to thank me. I wanted to do this. I wasn’t going to leave you on the beach. It’s nearly November, your feet were in the water, it was dark.”
Perhaps John isn’t coming. After all, Sherlock can honestly think of several hundred chores or things that the Stockyard would need to get done before the coming rain. Horses need to be turned out, that damned
John is looking at him. His cobalt eyes reflect the muddy yellow of the grass they sit upon as the wind lifts his hair back. It suddenly doesn't feel so overwhelmingly cold. It almost feels like the island has warmed, just in this spot.
Never having the confidence to imagine something like this as a remote possibility, Sherlock can’t even
is inspired by their appearance, it seems; instead of slowing to a walk as Watson approaches, he trots nearly in place, hooves trampling several distinct spots on the island grass, skin shivering with excitement. Watson has a dancing black horse underneath him. Only when the wind from the cliffs tangles through Sherlock’s hair does Gladstone pause to smell. Then he’s back to twisting, ten feet or so away, the distance that politeness demands.
but he could do damage. The thought makes Sherlock smirk as he shoves into the tavern door and past the people spilling out onto the walk.
“Someone still could have smuggled something in,” John says, “It isn’t hard to not declare something.”
He catches John’s eyes for a heartbeat. They are lurching specks of blue and his hair is sticking out from the wind, his arms tucked close to his side and his shoulders hunched behind Gladstone’s powerful neck.
The commands make even Sherlock jerk back. A dog’s dead, a man’s lost his fingers, and another one is dancing with lightly-coloured death. Is he the only one not going mad? Tangling with the blonde mare, the man’s apparent calamity is more unsettling than reassuring. There is strength in the cords of muscle prominent in his bare arms, but he is not panicked, and surely it must be a mistake, to be unafraid like this. Somewhere else down the beach, two horses rear up to fight, their handlers desperately trying to pull them apart.
He had fur on his clothes, and as he fought her--” Sherlock jumps, sliding his hands together as if gripping the hilt of an invisible sword.
nostrils, smears of red up to his wrist. There is a glistening wet knife held between his bared teeth.
John’s hand sifts into the wind-knotted curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck, pressing hard against his skull and hurting his hair and tucking Sherlock’s face into John’s neck. Sherlock clutches to John’s worn jacket, drinking in his comfort. Oh, god. Had they been so close to disaster?
than when John has taken it in the past. The tavern, with Lestrade, a show of sturdiness and hardy strength when Sherlock’s mind had begun to overwhelm him, or at home, John behind him on the sofa, quiet comfort and a needed presence.
He had never imagined this much raw power was normally held at bay by John’s expert hands on the reins. Is this what the
Watson is thinking over the validity of this answer, Sherlock can see it on his face. It's stupid, Sherlock thinks, how the sun catches in the sandy and silver streaks in Watson’s hair.
Sherlock dodges, slamming his fist into Moriarty’s belly, met with a wheeze. “An easy target, the man didn’t matter— you just wanted
Shocked, nerves thrilled by the danger, Sherlock throws himself away from the cliff and runs across the open sand as Gladstone spins frantically, shaking like a dog to free himself of the bells, to Hope’s fallen body near the surf. Sherlock collapses himself, hardly out of reach of Gladstone’s angry rearing.
“Moriarty’s meeting with you. He won’t come down for Gladstone,” John says, looking to Sherlock for validation.
Because suddenly it's there, hauling itself out of the sea and shaking the Scorpio from its hooves and the froth from its mane, giant grey head shoving close as it breaks the surface of the water.
It’s blunt and slippery, a slow, bittersweet stretch of it makes Sherlock’s toes curl. He digs his knees into John’s waist, stilling him for a moment. John pauses, clearly using restraint, and when Sherlock releases him, he nudges in just a little deeper.
The tavern is a riot of noise and smells, and Sherlock feels both overcrowded and exposed at once. He hunches his shoulders, looks up. Lights swing overhead, close to the low, exposed timber ceiling, and snippets of loud conversation whirl around the barrel-like tables and in the ale-scented air. It smells so heavily that Sherlock could get drunk on the scent of whiskey alone.
Alarmed at the sudden introduction of a stranger, the child looks at him, seeing with wide blue eyes, and as the child retreats from the wading edges, the water rises to John’s waist. John looks for his reflection, raising his arms to keep them from the reaches of the steadily clouding liquid.
to his deductions. Frowning, he turns to John, who is staring at the notebook in his grasp with a sort of horror in his eyes.
His horse isn’t even panting, despite galloping and devouring lengths of the island. And Watson is looking down at him quizzically. The water horse is too close for Redbeard’s comfort. Sherlock tilts his face up, squints against the light that the clouds have relinquished, holding his ground.
) drops onto his forehead, and he blinks up to John’s face. Sherlock should’ve recognized the displacement of weight on the floorboards and anticipated this. John drops another kiss on his nose, and swipes an unkempt curl out of Sherlock’s vision. He’s put his pants on, but Sherlock can see the creases where it was crumpled on the floor all night. “You’re posing.”
John is handling the reins at the front with expertise that comes from many years working with horses, many with this particular one, this particular sort. He does not look at Gladstone softly but with an edge, a warning and a threat.
got a certain look to his face that makes Sherlock want to pull Redbeard away immediately. He considers it. It would do Redbeard good, wouldn’t it? And it’d get Sherlock away from the man who keeps somehow insulting him.
Scoffing to himself, Sherlock casts his eyes away. What else had been in those reports? Something else to complete the scene before the Races commence? The weather, the ocean, John, the riders. Yes, that - who were the other racers? A white horse - that's all the gulls say to him. Nothing in his mind supplies any names, no saddle colors that were involved in the accident.
The teacup slips in Sherlock’s hand, sloshing over the edges. Hot water burns his hand. “Together?” He asks, settling the cup back into its wet saucer.
Sherlock crosses his arms over his chest, and tilts his head up, defiantly trying to look not so out of place.
“Yoo-hoo, boys,” Mrs Hudson calls, drawing their attentions and eyes to the kitchen, where she has popped out from behind the door frame, “I’ve got the kettle on, Doctor Watson, what do you take in your tea?”
