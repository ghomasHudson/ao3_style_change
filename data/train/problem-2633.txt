that Dean walked out of my life. I never stated that as fact, because I wanted to keep what happened private. But you just insisted that he must have left, and hence, you have formed an incorrect assumption as well as a biased opinion of him.”
A girl comes up to the bar, ordering herself a drink now that the first dance is over. She’s wearing a tight black dress with matching strappy heels and her brunette hair is tied up, exposing the soulmark that lines her back.
“I was going to wait until later to tell you this, once I got you back to your apartment,” Cas says, “I was hoping for a little more privacy, but I feel this is far too important for me not to tell you now.”
“I’ll show you how to get her breakfast prepared, and then I figured you could feed her while I prepare us something to eat, too. How does scrambled eggs and toast sound?” Cas inquires.
Dean tries to ignore the relief that floods through him at Cas’ words, or the fact that his heart practically soars from that piece of information. But he can’t ignore the feeling and instead finds himself smiling giddily throughout the entire duration of their dance.
He left to get his groceries and other items which took him just over an hour. He appreciated that he was now able to drive himself to and from the grocery store, thankful for the time it saved. As he pulled into his street to return home, he saw that someone else was parked where he had just been. One of the downsides of his new place was that they didn’t have a driveway for parking and instead had to park on the street out front. Cas didn’t realise how much of a downside it was until in that moment. With a scowl, he pulled in front of the car and parked, hoping that there was enough room for him to open his trunk door.
Dean knew Kevin from his time in college, from freshman to sophmore year. He met him through the LGBT club, back when Aaron introduced him to it. Kevin was shy, probably the shyest of their little group. He was also asexual, one of the newer and lesser known sexualities. It took him awhile to come out and a while to really feel comfortable admitting who he was.
The thing was, he liked Cas a lot as a friend. Truthfully, he hadn’t thought about Cas in a romantic way when they’d first met. He knew from day one that Castiel was undeniably attractive and definitely the type of guy that Dean would be open to dating. Yet it wasn’t until they grew closer that something began to stir in Dean and he began to develop more deeper feelings. Plus, his friends’ goading definitely did not help. During Spring break he realised that he missed Cas and missed their lunches together. Eating a PB&J at the kitchen table was definitely not the same without the assortment of treats and Cas’ humbling presence. Despite the welcomed break from school, he had a strong desire to return, just to continue having lunch with Cas.
“So tonight, I was just an experiment?” Dean snaps, causing a startled, hurt look to form in Cas’ eyes.
“Cas, you’re such a freaking sap,” Dean mumbles, because he doesn’t think he has the voice to say much more.
He tried, with everything he had. He stood there until his feet became numb. He chanted until his voice became hoarse and his eyes began to sting from his unshed tears. He stayed there for at least an hour, begging and pleading the angels to give him something,
“Upstairs in his room.” Michael replied. Dean went to walk past Michael into the house but the older man stopped him, a frown on his face. “Castiel is unwell with an ear ache and doesn’t want visitors. He should be back to school by Monday—you can see him then.”
Dean’s heart is in his throat as the information he has just heard weighs on him. His headaches as it tries to absorb everything that the Queen has said, everything that he should remember and should know, but yet doesn’t.
“I know but tonight he decided to go out to the movies with some new friends of his. He got invited during the day today. He was pretty much out the door before either Michael and I could talk to him.”
When they are about fifty feet away, they both stop and stare at the formidable building. Up close it looks even worse, with the bottom of the foundation slightly decayed and the sound of faint sirens blaring from within. Charlie pales and she even looks like she might be sick.
The parents came over shortly after to say goodbye. Dean got a big smooch on the cheek from his mother and promised her he would have a good day. Soon after she left, followed by Michael. Dean took one more glimpse at the boy behind him, to see him looking sadly over at the door. Dean may have not known the boy very well… or
She takes him back down to Charlie, who hugs Dean the moment his feet land on the ground. The hug is comforting, nice, a familiar feeling that he has missed.
They sat in silence for a few moments, the two of them reflecting on their choice to stay in Lawrence. Suddenly, a loud obtrusive sound disrupted the quiet.
“There is no reason to be sorry, Cas,” Dean said. “I understand why you had to do what you had to do. There is no shame in trying to put your needs first. In fact, we should be blaming me for this whole mess. I’ve been in love with you since high school, man,
Dean watched cartoons while his mom got herself and Sam ready for the day. By the time the clock struck eight, they were walking out the door.
“I have a way,” Dean states confidently, knowing that even without his memories, he will find his way through.
Before Castiel left to go home, the two of them hugged. Despite their closeness, they had rarely shared intimate contact during their formative years. It was nice, the rare chances they got to hug. Dean promised that they’d hang out the next day, before he left for basic training. He’d be gone for ten weeks, several states over in Georgia. Castiel swore that he’d travel to see him for his graduation ceremony, even if he had to walk there himself.
“Your mother refused to let me speak to you.” Missouri said. “She told me that whatever I said to you, I should say to her. I don’t mean to speak ill of Her Majesty, but I don’t think she understands the gravity of the situation. Of the prophecy.”
“Dad… he didn’t take it well.” Dean admits, “I practically raised Sam for a few years there while Dad went off the deep end. Bounced from job to job, continued to lose our money to alcohol and gambling, was never around to truly help us. We didn’t live in Lawrence again for five years, instead bouncing between motel room to motel room all across the country. He couldn’t cope with the fact that his soulmate was dead, so he sort of just gave up on everything.”
As he walked down the hall to Cas’ room, he came across Gabriel—one of Cas’ brothers. Gabriel was nineteen, ten years Castiel and Dean’s senior and was currently away for college. He was home for the summer, but Dean rarely saw him. Upon seeing Dean, Gabriel glared and scoffed, retreating back into his bedroom. Dean looked at the closed door with shock, wondering what on Earth he had done wrong.
Dean thinks as he watches the pathetic goo lie on the floor. He’s reminded of what Meg said about egos and how The Empty’s ego finally led to its demise.
As if John could read minds, he looked over at Castiel, standing alone a few feet away. Castiel watched as John’s face morphed to a slight expression of grief, as if he too was remembering the late king. He stepped away from his family and walked over to Castiel in determined strides. When he was close enough, he bowed deeply.
As they arrived at the bus stop, Dean was ready for nothing more than to have a quiet bus ride home. Instead he found his name constantly and repeatedly said by Cas from the moment they crossed the road.
Cas found it easiest to interpret only when he knew he needed to, or when Dean specifically asked. Other times, he stood back and let Dean communicate, not feeling any urge to jump in and attempt to carry the conversation.
“F9 439, the one that’s delayed?” She cuts him off. “Don’t worry, you aren’t the first one to complain today. Not even the first one to complain this hour. I’m sorry sir, but there was a mechanical issue with the plane, and it needs to stay grounded until we can get a team of engineers to fix it. The next plane we can get to replace it won’t arrive until 5am tomorrow morning.”
sorry for not telling you,” he murmurs, “that is all my fault. I betrayed your trust, before we’d even truly gotten to know each other. I don’t blame you for walking away…
If you ask Dean, he’ll say that he was fine the whole ride, that it wasn’t as bad as he thought. Although, if you ask Cas on the other hand, he will tell you Dean screamed like a baby the whole time. He'll tell you that he was afraid Dean was going to physically eject himself from the ride once or twice.
He began reading it, kicking off his shoes so he could rest his sock covered feet on top of his bed. For ten minutes he became absorbed in his book. He was nearing the end of the chapter and was so
“I can feel the energy of this fortress, I am one with it. My destiny is to pilot this, to control it in the fight against The Empty. And that I shall do. I can’t move on until this fight is over.”
Dean understood, giving his arm a squeeze. Castiel found comfort in the touch, the warmth of the sensation providing him with some form of stability. When Dean let go, the loss of contact left Castiel feeling cold. He wrapped his coat tighter around himself, watching as Dean smiled at him and began to head towards the horses, just as Castiel had.
Dean just hummed his agreement before turning back to the box he was unpacking. It was comments like that, that made his real feelings too hard to confess. He hadn’t told a single living soul about his attraction to Cas nor the fact that he may or may not be gay. Dean didn’t know how to label himself and the whole sexuality crisis was already too much for him to handle. Especially growing up in a misogynistic town with peers and male role models who were undoubtedly heterosexual. Dean decided to just brush his dad’s comment off, pretend as if he had been too focused to really hear it.
First, Cas hasn’t had coffee yet. Which, in itself, is a recipe for disaster. Cas isn’t one for mornings. It’s also their daughter’s seventh birthday, and with a party happening in just under five hours, the man in the foyer is practically a ticking time bomb.
“Perseus battled Andromeda’s betrothed for her hand, but his opponent was strong and Perseus was greatly outnumbered. With impending death, the hero did the only thing he could. He used Medusa’s head and instantly turned the man to stone, winning the right for the Princess. Perseus and Andromeda then went on to live many years together, until they both passed. After their death, the Gods placed them in the sky where they have remained since.”
It was better if everyone thought that he was just focusing on his duties and that his personal hobbies and interests were kept in secret.
At one point, they can’t help but watch as Michael and Adam return to the dance floor. Michael is suave with his moves, moving Adam around the dancefloor in a graceful but jovial manner. Adam is laughing, his face flushed and his eyes bright. In all honesty, Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen his little brother this happy.
Castiel hummed as he thought over her suggestion. Of course, he agreed, it was the most practical solution. She was right as it was a twenty minute walk into town and another twenty minutes back. It would add almost an extra hour to their travel time, which would be time wasted. However, the ugly, rotten feeling inside of him, wanted him to refuse her plans just on the basis that it was she that suggested them. Castiel’s jealousy always roared its head when he was around Anna. He did his best to keep it at bay.
Cas smiles for Dean again. He unwraps his arm from Dean’s shoulder and instead, holds out his hand to him. Dean grabs it and entwines their fingers. They then both lay back in unison, so that they can look up at the stars.
“It’s true. Dean, that guy is head over heels infatuated with you. In fact, before we found out you were soulmates, it worried us. Because we could see how much you both liked each other, and were worried about you both getting hurt. I know you feel hurt and betrayed right now, and you have every right to be, but don’t go throwing away something so beautiful over a feeling that will eventually fade.”
Truth was, he fell in love with Dean in a far more sappier and lovesick way. He fell in love with him gradually, so small and incremental that he hardly noticed. Not until he saw Dean one day, while they were hanging out, and he realised that he was well and truly in love. He still had no idea how it happened and he probably would never understand. He just knew the feeling was something he had never felt before, a burning hot fire of love that spread all over him every time he thought of Dean. And honestly, the feeling did more than scare him. It
know who he is and just don’t care. He’s aware only a select handful of people know his real name. His team tells him it’s to avoid the risk of it getting into the public. Dean can’t imagine what kind of life he’d live if everyone knew who he truly was. No more walks to the coffee shop, or trips to the local grocers. No more family dinners in Sioux Falls or walks on the beach. No more freedom.
The fear still races inside of him, along with the confusion and worry. He has no idea where he is, no idea where he is meant to go. He has no idea what even happened to him. All he knows is that he once lived a life that he can’t remember and now he is meant to navigate this new life where he knows nothing.
He walked up to the door and knocked. It didn’t take long for the door to open and for Dean to come face to face with Michael’s fiancée Duma. Dean liked Duma,
While the voice makes his head spin, the word secures a missing piece inside of him. Dean. He knows that name. That is
Just Like Heaven, they decide on Jurassic Park. The movie went by quickly, with Dean commenting on things he would have done better in the situation and Cas making comments on how ridiculous things were. As the credits rolled, Dean got up to get the eclairs while Cas got the sequel ready.
They reach the Impala and Dean, ever the gentleman, holds open the passenger door for Cas. He closes it behind him and hops into the driver’s seat, shoving the keys in the ignition. As the car begins to rumble, Cas lets out a soft chuckle.
He listened as Dean stomped over to the door and barely had a chance to catch his breath before it was swung open harshly. In the split seconds before Dean realised he was there, he took in the man’s disheveled form. From his bed hair to his bare feet, along with the run-down pajamas. He watched as Dean glared at whoever had disturbed his sleep, before his face went completely white and blank.
They are only ten minutes into their hike up the path when they come across the first lot of monsters. Vampires, as Dean has experienced before. He is quick to charge at them, slicing off their heads in a swift and efficient manner. When he’s done, both Charlie and Elizabeth are staring at him in shock.
With one last wave she hopped into the car and sped off down the straight, watching as her family faded off into the darkness.
“Hey, it’s okay, I got you.” He whispers, picking her up and holding her on his hip. She almost instantly calms down and Dean feels a flood of relief. It takes him a moment to realise that this is the first time he’s holding his daughter in his arms, and it brings a warm feeling to his chest.
The deep voice returning startles him and he steps away from the table hastily. He looks over to his left, where a large metal staircase travels upwards to a small landing. Deciding that the voice hasn’t led him astray thus far, he listens to it and begins to head up. Once he’s made it to the landing, he notes the heavy looking door in front of him. He can hear the sound of wind whistling through the gaps, a sign that a whole world lies beyond the confines of this dark and gloomy building.
However, it did not take long for Castiel to realise that Dean truly wasn’t the enemy. That sometimes, Dean could be just as afraid as Castiel. Sometimes, he was not always the best fighter. Castiel also realised how much Dean wanted to protect him, even when Castiel wanted nothing more than for him to be gone. When Castiel finally realised that Dean was going to always be at his side, he began to let down his walls, little by little.
Their whole lives, the family attended church regularly and basked in the true traditions of their Christianity. All their rituals, the small things they did on a weekly to annual basis, were all set by Castiel’s parents—from the first year of Michael’s life. Even after they died, the traditions continued to live on.
After clambering in from the playground, Miss Beck sat the class down on the mat for story time. He can’t remember specific details, like the sound of her voice, but he remembers that she read them a book about jobs. He still has memories of seeing children dressed up in costumes, posing as different careers, like nurses or firefighters. When they finished the book, they were sent back to their desks. When Dean sat down at his small desk — he thinks he remembers it being green? — a worksheet awaited him.
Bobby just smiled. “I shall do so, if you want me to. However, I feel that message you hope he will seek, would be better having been heard from you.”
“I don’t know how many times I’ve had to tell you in the past nine-months you’ve been dating him, but Cas is
Yet Cas’ strangeness was also his insistence on treating Dean as if he were a child. Sure, he did meet Dean when he was four but he had definitely grown up since then. He’d graduated, gone to college, bought his parents’ house as his own, completed his masters and PhD and now was in his first year lecturing at the college he’d practically just left. His mail was addressed to Dr. Dean Winchester; he was teaching kids college level maths. Yet to Cas? He acted like Dean was doing his sixth grade Algebra homework.
“Of course,” Cas said, “I’ve wanted to move back here the entire time I’ve been in Denver. I want to be here with you and Charlie, I want to be close to my parents, I want to be here in the place I call home.”
Cas was on the edge of his seat, entranced by everything Dean was saying. Dean leant forward so that they were closer in proximity.
“Claire, come on in.” He greeted with a smile. The teenager appeared hesitant, but slowly made her way into the room.
Dean grabbed Cas’ head in both of his hands, bringing their lips together for their first kiss of the new year.
him… to drop the flan off at the café at 7:30pm. So reluctantly, Dean made himself go look presentable so he wasn’t walking into the restaurant looking like a fish out of water. By the time he was ready it was 7:15, so he quickly bolted downstairs with the flan and called for a cab.
“Dean is not going to be in trouble, will he?” he asked his father. “He did not know that he was not allowed to talk to me.”
“I’ll come back for you, I promise,” he whispers, thinking of Impala who he was never able to return to.
“I don’t even know how to change the oil in my car, or a flat tyre, Dean.” Cas responded, with a small chuckle. “I’m pretty sure you know a lot more about that area than I do.”
He grabs Cas by the tie to pull them back together and this time, Cas hooks his his hands under Dean’s thighs and lifts Dean
As a child, he was like most kids his age. Friday signalled the end of the school-week, where homework, teachers and social hierarchies would cease to exist for a few days. Even now as an adult, he still remembered the feeling of coming home on a Friday afternoon, shouldering his backpack off and throwing it to the floor. He remembered the way the tension would ease from his shoulders and neck, the smile that would spread from cheek to cheek. He remembered the feeling of relief, knowing that he had two days all to himself.
Dean took a deep breath and rested his hands, the moment all becoming a bit too much for him. Cas was frozen in his spot, still as a statue. For a moment, Dean was petrified. He was scared that Cas wouldn’t care about what he had said, scared that Cas would hold too much resentment to Dean. He was scared Cas would walk out that door and out of Dean’s life forever. He was scared that he had already lost everything.
He looked over at Cas who wasn’t even listening to the conversation and instead was looking over as a person took a picture with an actress playing Cinderella. His face was the pinnacle of confusion.
He can barely see Charlie, but he notices the look of concentration on her face. He silences quickly, giving her the quiet she needs to think. He watches as she closes her eyes and leans her head back, taking in a deep breath. As she exhales, she opens her eyes and smiles.
“Not yet, but he got one last night!” Charlie exclaims, before realising what she said. She then sheepishly looks over at Dean, “Oh… uh… sorry.”
The town was below this hill. It was filled with a multitude of houses and buildings, resembling the architecture of the kingdom’s village. Here was where most of Castiel’s extended family resided, humans that descended from Grace and her relatives, and a few who descended from Gabriel. Some people here had the faintest of angelic powers, distant cousins, stemming from second and third children born to the royal family line. One of these was Anna, the Grasslands champion.
Dean pulled his friend up from the chair and hugged him, not knowing what else to do. He felt helpless, not knowing what was wrong with Castiel or how to help him. He couldn’t talk to Castiel and Castiel couldn’t talk to him. So all that was left, was to hold his friend until the tears finally dissipated.
Dean laughed, “Well my understanding of mechanical engineering is currently limited to mostly cars and the most basic physics so I can’t say I know a whole lot more than you.”
Ever since his birth, his bedroom was the one located in the south eastern tower of the castle. From one window of his room, he got a perfect view of the kingdom: the kingdom’s village and the surrounding fields. From his other window, he saw the hills and terrain that sat just below Grace Island’s notorious Purgatory mountain, where the miners and their families resided. The mountain blocked the view of the sunrise, unless you were atop it, and no one had travelled to the top of Purgatory mountain in years. For his nearly twenty-one years of life, Castiel had never once witnessed the sun rise on the horizon. He only ever saw it as it peaked above the top of the mountain, usually around mid morning. By then, the sky was no longer the beautiful canvas it was upon dawn,
But now as they dance together, on the same floor they danced over a year ago, the déjà vu hits him like a truck.
He recognises none of them, considering all the people he knew lived a hundred years before. Yet, Dean is happy to introduce him to a few of them, such as Miss Elizabeth Latiffe, a miner from Purgatory Mountain and Lord Inias, a distant relative of Castiel’s from the Grasslands. They make plans to travel to Hellian later that day to see Dean's friend, Charlie, the one who helped Dean throughout his entire journey. Together, with the citizens, they survey the destruction of the village and the castle and multiple discussions begin on how they can repair it.
He reassured Dean, causing the man’s shoulders to sag in relief. He turned back to the photo of Dean, looking out and pride in the photo, and decided to take a leap of faith.
“Yes, but most people just call me Cas,” Michael’s brother says, holding his hand out, “it’s a pleasure to meet you Dean.”
He’d had a plan, a simple plan to help calm his nerves. He’d leave work at four thirty, drive to the university, have a five-minute breakdown before going inside to see Cas, ten minutes before his office hours closed.
For someone who quit high school in order to put food on the table, Dean is certainly appreciative of the fact that he now has some money in the bank. For a while, Dean had forgotten what it felt like to feel safe, to not have to worry about paying bills or losing valuables like a house or car due to lack of funds. Now, it isn’t even a worry. He can’t lie, it’s a nice feeling.
It had always been particularly easy for him to make friends as he’d always been more on the extroverted side. He made new friends everywhere he went, from his classes to the freshman gatherings -- even at the local campus coffee shop. He was only in his second semester of college at the time and he already had people greeting him by name on campus. However, a lot of them happened to be old classmates from high school considering the campus of their college is in the heart of their hometown. While a fair few left to attend college elsewhere and others got jobs straight out of high school, most of the friends Dean grew up with attended college right along beside him. And while he may have spent his time at college making new friends and attending all the events their campus had to offer, he always made sure to spend time with his oldest friends.
“I’ve been studying soulmates for over a decade,” he begins, “I know almost everything there is to know about soulmate bonds. I’ve read thousands of witness accounts, scientific articles, and observed countless amounts of research. From what everyone’s described, you have this longing to meet your soulmate the moment you see them. As soon as you lay eyes on them, you’re
They leave after breakfast the next morning, to head towards Purgatory Mountain where the next closest fortress is. The trip cuts into most of their day and Charlie estimates that they won’t reach the mountain’s village until at least mid-afternoon.
“I don’t know,” Dean replies, “I agree with you. I find it foolish that people believe in something so frivolous. Love is love, no matter the gender.”
Dean huffed. Apart from his own brother, Cas was one of the only people who could read him like a book. Dean didn’t know whether this was because the angel could “see his soul” or whatever – or whether it was because they had been good friends for over a decade now. Either way, Dean was used to it at this point.
Despite being 17, Dean still appreciated the holiday and the celebrations that went along with it. And, of course, one of his favourite parts? Being in the kitchen with his mom. She was one for baking Christmas desserts almost every day of the holidays, their house always smelled like sugar, flour and a multitude of different holiday spices. It was probably why Cas spent almost every night in the Winchester’s home, rather at his own house with his family.
The two of them walk forward and suddenly, the atmosphere around them becomes brighter. The further they travel, the lighter it becomes. They move forward until all of a sudden, they are standing before a giant slab of stone, a light blue sword buried within it.
Claire would have been polite and refused—however her stomach grumbled and she decided that she couldn’t turn them down. Especially since this was the woman’s who recipes she feasted upon back in Sioux Falls.
They watched the next movie together while eating the dessert, both of them settled and relaxed  into the couch. It reminded Dean of their usual Friday nights, the ones they used to have growing up.
He felt his body begin to shake slightly, but he attempted to bid it still. He did not need to appear weak in front of the prophet, to make it seem as if he were not worth being centered in the prophecy. He gulped -- gulped down the pain and fear -- and attempted to rid the evil thoughts from his mind. He prayed that her words were not a bad omen, a sign of what he was imagining.
favour, especially one that required him to bake. Dean loved baking, a lot. However, most of the time, he liked doing it for his family and friends. People he
“Dean’s story is not mine to tell, Mary.” Castiel said. “However, I know the love that Dean possesses for you. I saw it as a child and I still see it now. When he is ready, someday, he will talk to you once again. This I am sure of.”
He unlocked the door and entered, walking through to the living area—only to pause at the sight in front of him.
Cause how can you celebrate a day of love, when the one you love doesn’t want to celebrate it with you?
In all honesty, Claire would never have guessed this was the famous Cas that Dean had gushed about for months. She would never have guessed if it wasn’t for his eyes. His piercing, blue eyes. The blue that gave him his sign name. The blue that Claire knew was one of the reasons why Dean had fell so hard for him.
Cas smiles and nods. “I’ll just be down the hall, I’m sure you remember where my bedroom is. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to come and talk to me.”
Just like Queen Naomi, Anna is only slightly corporeal. She’s a faded version of herself, but Dean can still the vibrant colours that once made up the person she was. From her red hair, to the blue of her dress, she still looks like the girl Dean only slightly remembers. He can see that she is beautiful and why she was well loved by everyone around her.
Dean first scrambles for the control panel, punching in the code as fast as he can before checking on Charlie. He slides on his knees over to her, holding her head in his hands as he attempts to see if she’s alive.
understand. Castiel knew that was a lie, considering Anna’s powers began to form when she was three. Being a descendant from the royal family, some like Anna possessed healing powers, due to the angelic blood coursing through their veins. While their healing powers were not near the capacity of Castiel’s own, they were still quite useful. And considering they manifested young, it meant that Anna had all the time in the world to perfect them.
It only took a few minutes but just as Dean was drifting off into sleep, he heard Cas get into his own bed too—slipping underneath the covers.
by Kodaline, the same song they danced to at Adam and Michael’s wedding, plays in the background. Dean hadn’t known what song it was at the time, but ended up recognising months later at Christmas when Sam had his playlist on. It isn’t the most romantic of songs, and Dean knows they probably could’ve picked more lovey-dovey crap, or even an actual
told that story and he knows Cas knows it too. He’s told it constantly, to the point Dean could recite it himself. Yet, he plays along.
Fortunately, he only has to bear the weight of their gazes for a moment, before the door swings open again. The girl is looking at him with a bewildered stare.
had Meg who took up a lot of his time. They only saw each other in brief periods at home, which was never what it used to be like for them. Being away back in Kansas, they saw each other everyday and spent hours on end together and with their families. It brought Dean back to a simpler time. A happier time.
He watched as the Nephilim walked forward, the sheen of its golden coat shimmering under the midday sun. One of the researchers had the control panel in his hand, bidding the Nephilim to move where he wanted it to. Castiel wished more than anything that he could be down there with him. He missed when he was amongst them, researching and tinkering with the Nephilims -- doing what he loved most.
in fact, she was practically a second mom to him. He’d become incredibly close to her over the summer, as she had moved into the Shurley home a week after school was let out. In July, Michael proposed to her and had enlisted both the help of Cas and Dean to pull it off. Despite her tough exterior, especially as being a medical resident, she had a softness inside of her that only her close relatives could see. She especially had a soft spot for Dean, which was shown by the genuine smile that graced her lips as soon as she registered it was him.
“Well, I can’t imagine why,” Castiel sighed, scraping away at a bit of the mold with his pencil tip.
He looked back up, intending to ask why Dean was apologizing to him, but the question lodged in his throat. The raw sadness he could see in Dean’s eyes caught him completely off-guard, and instead of what he’d intended to say, he found himself asking, “How did you get here?”
“I thought it was smallpox,” Dean murmured back impishly. He couldn’t stop grinning, even as the two of them walked through castle ruins that were objectively really damn creepy. Castiel had insisted that they visit at night, as well as during the day, to add to the “atmosphere.”
“Cas, just look at me,” Dean was shouting frantically. His face had gone bone white, and his wide eyes kept flicking back and forth between his corpses, filled with horrified alarm. “You need to calm down, right now. Stop this! You know it didn’t happen like this! Castiel, breathe and calm the fuck down.”
“Dean.” Putting his hand on Dean’s shoulder and gently but firmly tipping him onto his back, Castiel climbed on top of him, holding himself up with straight arms. “Are you just trying to come up with ways to keep working on this house because you don’t want it to be done yet?”
“Wonder what it’ll be like when you have a pup,” Amelia said with a smirk. “It sounds like you’ll have a lot of extra hands, which is definitely something you’ll be grateful for.”
“It involved your name, not you. Not even your name! Just your nickname, which, according to your brother, isn’t even something you want to have.”
“You mean Doctor Sexy lied to me? I shall never recover.” The bleeding seemed to have slowed to a near stop, and Castiel’s brows knit as he examined it. “Your cut doesn’t cross any of the creases in your palm, and it’s shallower than I thought. We were always told, however, that hand and finger injuries should definitely be checked out by a professional, since it’s important for them to heal correctly. I’d be happy to drive you to the ER, if you choose to go. It would probably be wise to at least get a tetanus shot.”
“So dock my paycheck,” Meg answered with a smirk before going on. “You’re all tense and fidgety, but not grouchy, so something must have happened to change the scene. I’m well aware of how much you were dreading having to come clean, so either you figured out a fool-proof way to do it without Sam getting pissed, or…you figured out a way for you to keep the game going.”
In retrospect, Dean would later recognize with relief that it was a very lucky thing that Castiel had been dreaming primarily of vesseled angels. Not that he had any evidence that seeing an angel’s true form in a dream would burn his eyes out the same way it would back in reality, but the Entity’s warning made him suspect that he was better off not trying to test the theory. As things were, he had enough to worry about with the very shocked and upset pair of angels into whom he’d literally stumbled when he’d turned his first corner.
“But what if I screw it up?” Dean blurted. His knuckles were white where he was gripping his bottle, and he forced himself to relax his hand and put the drink down on the counter. “You remember what happened with Lisa. I thought that was going to work out, right up until she walked out because I wasn’t giving her what she needed. That completely blindsided me, Sam, and Lisa’s just the most recent time that happened. How many times have I fucked up potential relationships without even trying?”
“By the way, tell your guy thanks again for me. I cannot believe the deal he managed to get me on those,” Dean interjected.
“Well, look at the evidence. Doctor Benton was giving me shots, which was, frankly, pretty sketchy anyway, since I hadn’t even finished the full officers’ course and they had no idea when or where I might end up being deployed. Dad, who wasn’t a doctor, had a bunch of needles and chose the middle of a worldwide catastrophe to attempt to use them on himself and his wife. Dad and Benton were doing something together that involved whatever is in those needles, and it was apparently top-secret. Yeah, I don’t think those are CDC-approved vaccinations.”
The image that grew from Dean’s guesswork was likely a wildly inaccurate one, but it only served to stoke his curiosity more. He was fascinated.
“Come on, man,” Dean said, suddenly too tired to pretend any longer. “You’ve got to give me a little more time to adjust than that. I swear, next time you see me, it’ll be like none of this happened, and we can just keep on the way we were, but tonight…you’ve got to give me tonight to feel like shit.” He stubbornly kept his eyes fixed on the ground between them, ever the coward.
Castiel’s concentration was broken abruptly as noise and a loud scuffle erupted in the trees just out of his sight. Shouting, growling, loud grunts and the sounds of impact, he noted. Benny, fighting off whatever else was there.
“Not then, right now!” Dean interrupted. “Just—” There was no time for Sam to try to find the signal on his own; Dean had no patience for that. He ripped the headset from his head, then reached for Sam’s. Naturally, Sam protested, but Dean just knocked his hands away and jerked the headphones off, then pushed his toward Sam. “Listen!” Sam’s bitchface spoke volumes, but he reluctantly put Dean’s headphone over his head, settling them in his ears with his mouth already open to argue. Then he paused, frown shifting.
Huffing, Sam shrugged. “Sure, why not,” he said. “But I’m pretty sure I know what problem two is, and we can’t talk our way through that.”
“Are you even blinking?” Dean couldn’t help blurting, though at least he did it in a whisper, and if he hadn’t been unblinking himself, he might have missed the slightly quickened pace at which Castiel’s chest rose and fell with his breathing. “Hey, you can hear me, can’t you?” he quietly asked, feeling one bit of anxiety assuaged.
“That’s hardly on the same level,” Sam said, but he relented. “At least let us get the next round,” he said, then jumped up and headed to the bar before Dean could even think about protesting.
They kept moving, using the creek to guide their path southward. The water was clear and cold, but neither of them were willing to trust the quality too far, not when iodine tablets were available for added insurance when they needed to drink. Dean felt rather grateful that if they had to do this, at least it wasn’t happening at the peak of summer heat. He was stooping to splash a little water on his face when Sam made a thoughtful sound.
“I really didn’t expect that you would. Not by your own choice.” The implied threat wasn’t veiled at all, and the overly wide grin it wore looked unnatural as it stretched Bela’s cheeks. “But before you dive back in, I think it’s your turn to tell me something. Have you picked up on any running theme yet during all your little trips through dear Castiel’s subconscious? Hmm?”
“Finally talked to Naomi,” Castiel mumbled into his pillow, not lifting his head. Fingers threaded their way into his hair, comfortingly rubbing.
Dad was shoving the bag into his arms, repeating himself as he tried to turn Castiel around and push him bodily out the door. Naomi seemed more concerned about getting there quickly so she could report back to her own base than she was about the risk that they would be arrested, or shot, or…what was the reporter screaming about now? Fucking
“Hey, Kevin was there, too,” Dean tried to argue. “I mean, he was there waiting for his mom to drive him home, but there was legitimate conversation involved.” Sam made an exasperated sound, and Dean rubbed at his temples in resignation. “Okay, point. But that’s sort of what I’m trying to do here, you know? This house, it’s got a genuine dining room. I won’t have to pull a card table into the living room if I want to feed more than four people. With a little polish, I can have this place primed for departmental dinner parties, even.”
“You know, I am technically your boss,” he protested, though any authority he’d ever had was being sapped by his current position: sitting backwards on a second office chair and leaning his forehead against the top of the headrest.
Sam turned to look at Dean quizzically, while Bobby paused before answering. “Not listening to any music either, Dean. I don’t see anything unusual on the cameras, but you sure what you’re hearing isn’t on your side? A radio or…”
“Hey,” Dean found himself interrupting in hope of defusing things before they reached DEFCON 1 levels. “You know, I’m a little beat, myself. I’m not a seasoned hiker like you all are. It wouldn’t bother me a bit to go back with her and hang out at the campsite until you guys get back.” In all honesty, Dean was actually starting to drag more than he wanted to admit, just from the half hour they’d walked. The heat was starting to get to him, he supposed, and if he could help out the family while also getting to sit and rest himself, he’d count it as a win-win.
“Oh, no, wouldn’t want to be an inefficient murderer,” Dean muttered, earning a pained look from Castiel. “Then what is it? Animal?”
“I already told you, I’m cool with going back to camp,” Dean protested. “You go on, hang out with your brother. Claire and I can have a tea party or something.”
Claire was talking to Dean more frequently, too. She was apparently becoming disturbed, with good reason, at Dean’s mumblings to people who weren’t actually there, and at first she had tried to get him to stop, but then she’d moved on to other tactics.
Carefully placing the nailer on the ground, Castiel knee-walked across the floor to the crate where Dean sat. The gleam in his eye had Dean uncertain about whether to scoot back or lean in, but Castiel didn’t give him the chance to make up his mind before he was kneeling astride Dean’s lower legs and caging him in with hands planted on either side of his hips.  He was close enough that Dean could make out the tiny silver hairs that dotted the dark stubble along his jaw and chin.
“Good,” Dean said. He closed his eyes, enjoying the delicate brushing of fingertips against sensitive skin. “I like the idea even more the more I think about it. That outside entrance will be great for people who want to step outside for some air, too. But…you know, it’s kind of a narrow stairwell. Not exactly a comfortable place to just hang out.”
For what felt like the thousandth time, he had to remind himself that at this point, he couldn’t just pack up and disappear, or he’d be arrested for going AWOL. It served him right for ever compromising in the first place, rather than just hitchhiking his way out west somewhere where nobody ever heard of the Novak family or its “fine military tradition.”
Dean wasn’t looking at Castiel, though. His reddened eyes had landed on the woman standing behind Castiel, and his stare was murderous.
The pack of zombies seemed to be growing more agitated by the noise, and Castiel wondered if they were attracting even more to their number. He didn’t want to risk glancing behind to check. The same panic he’d fought down back at the safehouse was returning; maybe this
Castiel watched as Dean took a step closer to where he cowered, extending an open hand in reassurance. Castiel also watched as another Dean took a step closer, creeping around a corner with his gun gripped tightly, ready to shoot.
Castiel looked on edge, eyes skittering all around the area where they stood. It was unclear whether he was still looking at people who weren’t there or if he was searching for the potential threats that lurked in the shadows. Frankly, Dean wasn’t feeling particularly optimistic that he was making any progress at all in getting his message through. “Just get your head in the damn game, or we don’t stand a chance,” he muttered, turning away and kicking at some leaves that totally had it coming.
There didn’t seem to be any signs that the storm would let up soon, so after they’d rested their legs a little, they started exploring the rest of the church. There was always the possibility of finding something useful, but not too big or bulky, that they might want to bring back with them. Sam whooped when he found a pack of batteries in a desk drawer. “Score!”
Then again, she was apparently in charge of the military leadership of the settlement, which couldn’t be an easy job. Her plate was likely overfull, and so he decided to be patient and to wait until he was released and able to go to her, rather than expecting her to come to him. It was a little troubling, though. He confided as much in Dean, who seemed sympathetic, but who also warned him that Naomi might be a little more prickly that Castiel remembered.
“When I had to take this class as an undergrad, I think I spent half the lecture entertaining myself by counting how many times the professor said the word ‘peening’ and wishing I’d snuck in a flask so I could have turned it into a drinking game,” she said with a yawn. “You know it’s bad when even the frat boys get too bored to make dirty jokes over the term. So spill. What’s got you giggling like a giddy schoolgirl over your phone? Did somebody finally like one of the Instagram glamour shots of your car?”
a whimper, and his own hands were wrapped around Castiel’s jaw on both sides, fingers curling involuntarily through the tiny curls at his nape.
“Two more,” he said, looking back toward the table. Leaving the smaller box for last, he grabbed one that looked like a decorative basket with a floral-patterned cloth covering tied around the top with a delicate ribbon. Probably something from one of the older women on the college staff. Dean untied the ribbon, then pulled the cloth aside.
Sam’s pinched expression relaxed. “Yeah, okay,” he said as warmth filled his eyes once more. “I guess that’s what I should have pieced together from the beginning. You guys work well because you balance each other out, not because you started out with so much in common. I see that every day, but I’ve just never seen you date so far outside of your wheelhouse before, so it caught me off-guard.”
this moment, everything about this day. It happened before, but it didn’t happen like this. I don’t know how we’re here, going through this all over again. Please, Dean. Tell me why this is happening.”
“I just mean that I wouldn’t want to go to any parties in the first place when I’m ready to drop, and I don’t really appreciate having to deal with the racket of a party when I’m not even there.” Dean threw back his beer, then exhaled heavily. “Especially frigging
“Anything else in there?” Dean called from the other side of the room, where he was rummaging through a closet that was mostly packed with hymnals and bulletins.
“Not diving in headfirst, having to make it habitable before you can even think about comfortable?” Castiel suggested, and chuckled when Dean nodded. “Makes sense. You definitely would still have been in way over your head, of course, but it would have taken much longer to reach the panic stage.”
to. And even if it’s one-sided, the connection you’re feeling is probably more honest than if it was based on the stuff people usually feel attracted to at first, like looks or similar taste in movies.”
“You’re ridiculous,” Castiel said, ducking his head to bite softly at Dean’s collarbone. “I’d be happy to help out with whatever you want to do to this house, now or in the future, but if you’re brainstorming ideas just to have excuses to keep me here, there are much easier ways to do that.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” asked Sam. He had moved to Dean’s other side and was pointlessly trying to soothe some of the tiny tremors that were visible in Dean’s muscles. “Lively how? A party?”
A man sitting at the corner of the bar waved a hand toward Balthazar, who jumped to respond. “Whoever wins, I wanna buy them a drink,” the man said, gesturing toward the fight.
“Hmm? Oh, no, not that I can see,” Castiel replied. He sounded distracted, and he was still staring. Then, with a start, he seemed to come back to himself, blinking and shaking his head. “I was…I was just thinking. Rather than cut into the next twelve-foot sheet for the inside of the closet, I think we can probably get the right dimensions out of the remnant of the one from the linen closet. It’s out in the hallway still. I’ll just...let me go get it.” He staggered and almost tripped as he stood up, and Dean snorted.
Both men groaned when they stepped into the bathroom doorway. The room was too cramped for them both to occupy it, so Castiel was the one to enter, crouching down to run a hand along the box of drywall that had been built to hide almost all of the sink plumbing. “Did they just assume nobody would ever have to look at any of the pipes again once they were installed?” he grumbled. “Not even a service access panel.”
“It’s…it’s not really weed,” gasped Meg, who was laughing so hard she was in tears. Beside her, her partner in crime Ruby was in equally sad shape. “But holy shit, your face!”
Sam took pity on him, saving him from having to put into words what he most dreaded. “Then don’t,” he said. “You’ve got him, and it’s okay to let yourself be happy about that.”
“Sure, by someone,” Dean said. “Not us. And that was before they spent a year and a half going feral.” The former owners were no longer in residence, their demise self-explanatory by the broken farmhouse door hanging loose from one hinge and the large reddish-brown stains dried onto the linoleum kitchen floor. The broken sections of paddock fence, on the other hand, appeared to be the work of hooves, probably seeking access to the cornfield and the small pond downslope from the barn.
“No, I do,” Castiel said. “Dean, in my lowest moments, when I was surrounded by nothing but ghosts and despair, and part of me just knew it would be so easy to just throw open that door and finally join them, like I should have done in the beginning—” Dean’s hand tightened around Castiel’s jaw as he flinched “—there was nothing that truly helped, except that I had you there with me.”
Dean nodded, feeling more grounded now. It helped matters that the lights from the street were muted from here, lessening the distraction of that piercing gaze. “Yeah, that’s right,” he said, belatedly realizing with embarrassment that the handshake had gone on much longer than was appropriate, and he quickly released Castiel’s hand. Thankfully, he seemed distracted enough by the house to not notice Dean’s awkward behavior.  “As detailed as you can get, seriously. I don’t want anything skipped or brushed over.”
Dean agreed. His blood pounded with excitement in his veins. If that reaction was only partly due to the amazing document find, well, nobody else needed to know.
“I mean, wow,” Sam said, laughing again. “I guess I really was underestimating you. You’re a gym person now?”
“Close your door then,” Dean called back, unconcerned. A moment later, he heard footsteps approaching, and then a scowling head was poking through his doorway.
Dean threw a look toward Castiel, who held up his palms helplessly. Sighing, Dean turned to locate Gabriel in the crowd, but he was still hanging on by his fingernails in the card game, which had turned into a brutal bloodbath of a contest. “All right, folks,” he finally said, “if you’re here and I count you among my friends, then it’s a safe bet that you’re not easily offended anyway, but just in case, this might be a good time to go grab a drink and enjoy the deck.” Naturally, his warning only served to pull more people in to watch.
A voice from behind him: “What the hell is going on over here? You two are screaming fit to bring every chomper in this place—
“Anything,” Dean managed to say, thoroughly meaning it. Did Castiel want him to sprout wings and fly around the room? Sure, give him a few minutes to breathe, and then he’d try.  What it turned out that he wanted, though, was much more simple. Dean’s legs were once more lifted into the air, braced on Castiel’s shoulders, as with one hand Castiel quickly located the opened packet of lube lying nearby (seriously, how prepared was this guy?) and used it to coat the inside of Dean’s thighs. Squeezing Dean’s legs together, then, Castiel groaned hoarsely as he pushed his neglected cock into the slick, tight space between them.
Mrs. Tran threw him an enigmatic look. “You think there’s much that goes on in this building that I don’t know about?” she said. “But I’d rather him sleep safely in here than on a couch in the faculty bathroom or somewhere else equally disgusting. Tell him those are your blankets, or else he’ll be stubborn about using them.”
But Sam knew, deep down in his heart where he relegated hopeless truths, that if Castiel was going to be truly, fully happy, it was going to somehow be linked to Dean. Those two…it would be hysterical if it weren’t so tragic. There was Dean, with his mooning and his weirdly awkward attempts at flirting that he thought nobody could see, with the way he lit up when Castiel was here with them and brooded unbearably when he wasn’t. And there was Castiel, with his hovering and his soulful gazes and his eternal insistence on protecting Dean at the expense of all else, including his own life. Talk about the sun shining on one’s face; the way those two practically glowed when they were together and on the same page was enough to light up the whole bunker. Of course, when they were on different pages…but that wasn’t the current issue.
“So Sammy wants a double date with you and your boy toy,” Meg drawled, enjoying his discomfiture. “I take it you haven’t let him in on the full story yet?”
Or was this the accumulation of all the pain that had followed, piled on top of and as a result of Dean’s cruelty?
“If you are stopped by anyone, give them this number,” Dad said dismissively, scribbling on a piece of paper. “You will be let through. Take the Jeep. Naomi, I’m trusting you.” He held out both the bag and the paper.
Claire, too, was unimpressed by her mother’s inaccurate statement. Her eyebrows met in the middle of her creased forehead, and her breathing picked up as her lips trembled. Jimmy, sensing the coming explosion, closed his eyes and took a deep breath of his own.
Charlie laughs softly, “I keep forgetting you lost your memories. So… okay… most people believe in our land that the only romantic relationships can happen between a man and a woman. Because naturally, a man and a woman can only conceive with each other. However, most people… they don’t take into account how love comes into play, you know? It’s like a man and woman are only destined to be with each other to have kids. Yet, we love so many people each day. Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends and family. So why isn’t that the same for romantic love? Why can’t some people love those that are the same gender?”
He looked down at his hands that were currently covered in grime from the morning’s session. He saw the blood pumping furiously through them, the same blood that was meant to carry the magic of angels. He sometimes wondered if one day, he would stare at his hands long enough for the magic to be unleashed. He had prayed for that moment since he turned eighteen, doing everything he could to try and access and harness the dormant magic. Almost three years later, nothing had happened, despite his countless attempts.
Cas sighed again. “It was. At first. I saw life move past me, people forget about me, a whole world change around me. I spent so many years in a loop, going from place to place with no one to talk to. Honestly, for many years I was depressed and I wanted to just pass on, go into the light or whatever. I just don’t know why I couldn’t. Still don’t, honestly.”
Dean bit his lip. It was probably not a good idea to tell his brother sensitive information about Cas without his permission. Afterall, very few people were aware that he was Ace, and it wasn’t Dean’s place to question his friend’s preference for secrecy. Again, boundaries. He considered Sam’s inquiry for a minute, and proceeded to give a generic answer about Cas’s concern for Dean’s self-discovery period.
“It’s just that you’ve been kind of quiet. If it’s about that girl you like, Sam and I were just poking fun earlier. Didn’t mean to strike a nerve or anything.”
So, I love the idea of Crowley just defying all expectations for sexuality and gender. Also, King of Hell. Enough said.
“Cas,” the angel stirred slightly as a hand shook his shoulder. “Hey, Cas. Wake up,” Dean whispered.
“Dean, sometimes you just gotta man up and go for things when the opportunity arises. Everwise you may miss out.”
I would like that, but aren’t you worried about Gabriel or one of your other siblings listening in? That’s why you never want to text. A phone call is even more public. Plus, it’s late.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. It’s just...well, hanging out with Cas and his friends has helped me to realize certain things about myself, and fuck...why is this so hard?” he clenched his teeth.
Claire was next to greet the young Winchester. She was holding hands with another girl whom Sam soon learned was her girlfriend. Kaia smiled at him. Crowley held back, an effort, Dean assumed, to seem cool by just nodding his acknowledgement of Sam’s presence. Another possibility was that he was waiting for an introduction. It was probably a bit of both.
"Dabble? I have a regular schedule," Crowley said, proudly. "There's a restaurant downtown that lets in minors before nine, so I do dinner performances on Fridays. Look me up. Crowley, King of Hell."
“Well, I never expected him to return those feelings,” Cas swallowed, awkwardly. “It was a lot, so I pulled away before anything happened.”
“You are such a smartass sometimes, you know that?” Dean tried to be annoyed, but Cas’s bitchy attitude was always such a turn on. “Get over here.” He intended to kiss that damn smirk off the angel’s face.
Dean and Cas have lunch together and talk about Homecoming, coming out, and family. Also a singalong in the Impala.
Actually, Dean takes that back. Castiel had been unfortunately well acquainted to human nature that God himself had resented, ignorance and greed and something of the like but he made it up in only way a dorky angel could. Love, however, was a tricky game that the angel had gotten himself mixed up in, and suffered in the hands of it like every other human on this forsaken earth. Dean glanced at their entwined hands, his thumb running comforting lines over Castiel’s grip. Love was most definitely the trickiest, but flawless and effortless all at once.
. Now that I have sorta come to terms with it, I think I can go further down that road and say that I probably would never love Lisa like I love Cas. It makes me guilty as hell, to have to waste a year of her life like that, especially to take it all away in the end. But I think I always kind of knew I wouldn’t be able to give myself over to her, not completely.
“Normally I just bake cookies, but it’s the first day, so I wanted to make a good impression,” he grinned. “Hey, can you get some paper plates and napkins from that drawer over there? And in the cabinet below, there should be some cups,” he directed Dean. “We are going to need to make more than one trip.”
“Best results? Like how appropriate the outfit is for the establishment? Is it for posture? Because I can barely move in this, let alone slouch.”
Meanwhile, Cas also couldn’t sleep. Dean didn’t know if it was because the boy could sense the restless energy radiating from him or if he had something else on his mind. Rolling over on his side, Dean reached down to nudge his shoulder.
“Thank you, Jack,” Cas ruffled the boy’s hair, affectionately, to show his gratitude. “Oh, and to address your initial question,” he smirked and held out his hand so his son could see the honeybee ring Dean had given him. “Dean and I asked each other.”
That was an interesting question. The answer would be both yes and no because while he and Cas had taken a pretty big step together earlier that day, it didn’t necessarily confirm that they would be going to the dance as a couple. For all Dean knew, that could be something beyond Cas’s boundaries. He highly doubted it though because just like him, Cas was a sappy romantic. Still, a certain amount of pressure remained even if the answer was almost certainly yes. Dean wanted to knock this out of the park, and he was determined to make that son of a bitch blush to no end.
“Whatever you say, Dean,” Cas nearly melted as the other man began to comb his fingers through his hair. “Why don’t you and Jack go look for that frame, and I’ll make some popcorn.”
Gabriel gave him a thumbs-up and continued along to Jack’s room. After he disappeared, Cas turned to Dean with a raised eyebrow.
“Hey Dean,” his brother greeted as he settled himself in a criss-cross position at the foot of Dean’s bed, facing him. “What are you doing?”
Also, I would very much like to have lunch with you again tomorrow if you are willing. We do not have to go down to the park this time since it’s a bit of a time crunch. Rather, we could sit on one of the benches by the front entrance. They tend to fill up quickly, but if we hurry, we might be able to snag one. Or perhaps I could bring a blanket, and we could have a picnic in the grassy area around the side of the building. Whichever you would prefer.
That "solemn smile" is a bit of foreshadowing since Cas hasn't talked to Dean about his asexuality yet. He obviously cares about Dean a lot, but there's some reservations regarding having a relationship with him that I intend to flush out soon (hopefully in the next chapter).
“What? No, I just...you always run out of here so quickly, and I can never find you in the lunchroom. I just wanted to know if you would want to sit together?”
It had been about a half an hour since the Gabriel debacle, and the two were now sitting on the floor of the bedroom with a long stretch of paper and a pile of art supplies in front of them. Cas was occupied, drawing a series of different Pride flags along the border. He had just finished the bisexual flag when Dean’s voice caused him to look up.
“I sympathize with the situation, Ms. Bradberry, but my hands are tied. All I can offer is support in processing these emotions. If you would like to consult with the school counselor, perhaps…”
“Yes, but there’s more to a relationship than just liking someone, Sammy. He said we should take some time to think before we pursue anything.”
“You think I’m not? I’m fucking terrified, man. But the only thing scarier than a pissed off John Winchester is a future where I am forced to give up everything I’ve worked for in order to live a lie. In the long run, that’ll hurt worse than anything he could ever do to me.”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” the look of horror on the younger boy’s face transitioned to something equivalent to betrayal. “I want to help!”
“It’s not just for you, Cas. It’s for me. I can’t keep up the charade any longer,” Dean swallowed. “It’s going to suck, but it’ll be worth it.”
Cas smiled, and Dean was just grateful he wasn't some kind of mind reader given what had just passed through his head. Still, he figured he should tell him his conclusion.
Cas didn’t protest. The two conversed for about a half an hour after that. It wasn’t about anything in particular, just random stuff, but hearing Cas talk was soothing. However, it came to the point where neither of them could keep their eyes open. Dean finally signed off and slipped into sleep, clutching his phone to his heart.
“No worries. That’s quite common actually for people to come in without knowing exactly what they want. That’s what I’m here for. I can guide you. Let’s just start with you telling me a little bit about your fiancé-to-be. Is she more of a diamond girl or would she prefer something less flashy?"
“Last I saw, he was with his mom. I think she was starting to get a little handsy with another teacher cause she spiked her own punch with a flask she keeps in her purse. It wasn’t bad enough to get her into any serious trouble, just made the guy a bit uncomfortable, but that’s why Crowley is keeping an eye on her so she doesn’t go too far.”
“Don’t give me that,” Dean said firmly. “When you walked in here you were a wreck, and then as soon as you made eye contact, you froze like a deer in headlights. Then you shuffled to your desk and avoided looking at me like that wouldn't strike me as off. I’m not dumb, Cas.”
As for the little tidbit about Cas's asexuality, I have an idea planned later for that, but I wanted to plant the seed before I get into it.  As an asexual person, I have always seen myself in Cas, and I was looking to provide some representation for other Ace people (obviously experiences may still vary). I'm excited to see where the storyline takes me. Just as clarification though, Cas is asexual but not aromantic in this story. He is romantically queer, so he and Dean are still happening eventually.
“Uh yeah. Sorry. I’m not used to compliments is all,” Dean cleared his throat and then proceeded to park and exit the Impala.
“Jack is my nephew. I guess I just felt guilty,” he twiddled his thumbs while he talked and kept his eyes focused on his feet.
“Ok, can we please get on with this parade business before I lose my lunch?” Crowley pretended to gag.
Dean shook her hand, and Cas said something to her in sign language which made her laugh. She signed something back which sparked what looked like a hilarious discussion, but Dean had no clue what it was about. Sam seemed to pick up on pieces and laughed along with them, but Dean didn’t know what else to do besides nod. He figured he should learn sign language. Maybe Cas could teach him someday.
“Good. Right, well, they are just now calling passengers for my flight, so I need to hang up soon. I should be there in a few hours. Do you need me to stop by your dad’s place to get anything? The son of a bitch is probably out day drinking anyhow, and I know that wherever you guys go, he always keeps a spare key under the mat.”
“I hate to ask this, but...do you think I could snag a sandwich for my brother before we put them out? My dad is outta town, and money’s kinda tight,” he waited for a moment before adding, awkwardly, “If it’s an issue, I’ll just give him mine.”
Dean laughed a little. He wasn’t sure if it was a reaction to Jack’s enthusiasm regarding their engagement or if it was in response to the slight tickle he felt upon Cas’s touch. Either way, it felt good. His whole body was filled with utter joy.
“What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” Cas smirked. “Besides, I need a break from this,” he waved his hand towards his computer screen, but didn’t elaborate.
“What can I say? I’m a sucker for the classics,” Dean chuckled and opened the passenger side door for Cas to climb inside, making note of the slight flush in the other boy’s cheeks upon this gesture.
“That’s right. Sam did mention something about that, I think. So, I’m going to take a guess and say not a girly girl, huh?”
Cas practically had to drag Dean down the hallway. He was fully awake and dressed, but still irritable from being disturbed. That irritability vanished, though, when they reached the kitchen. Before them was a buffet of all of Dean’s favorite breakfast foods and a banner that read “Congratulations Dean and Castiel” on it. A huge smile spread across both of their faces.
“Well that sucks. But I guess that gives you the chance to check out the available fellas, right?” Dean was laughing, but there was a hint of jealousy in his voice as he pictured Castiel with other guys. Cas didn’t seem to notice. Rather, he averted eye contact and sighed.
Cas smiled and agreed that having company would be nice. He allowed Dean to lead the way to the parking lot where the Impala was parked.
“I’ll have to tell you that full story sometime,”John’s face became sad for a second, but whatever was going on in his head was quickly dismissed. “But speaking of dates,” he glanced over his shoulder at Dean. “I still can’t believe you’re going stag to the dance, Dean. I figured the girls would be throwing themselves at you.”
“We didn’t have a fight, Sammy. I wasn’t feeling well over the weekend, and then today I just felt like spending time with you. Cas understood. It’s no big deal,” he lied.
It took a lot of willpower to stay focused after Cas’s little hint at the beginning of class. So many questions were poking at his brain, and he wanted nothing more than to drag Cas out of there and into an empty room just to get everything out in the open. Unfortunately, he had a quiz next week, so mind wandering was not an option. WW1 era Europe sadly demanded his attention.
Dean frowned, but nevertheless, proceeded to wrap one arm around Cas’s shoulder. Sighing, he turned his head to kiss the other boy’s cheek. Any sign of annoyance instantly vanished at the contact. Gabe snapped the picture just as the flush returned to his brother’s face. He looked from the photo to the two of them and nodded in approval. Even Michael cracked a small smile at the scene.
“My brothers helped me compose messages to my father for when he was away. Not that he ever answered.”
“I’m bisexual,” Dean corrected. “And you rarely ask me about my day anyway, so why would it matter where I was? I could’ve just not said anything at all. The only reason I came up with the lie was for Sam before I told him.”
“Let’s get your mind off of it then,” John smiled. “You left me hanging before. Tell me about your possible date.”
“Again, this is not the time to recount what you and Boy Wonder are doing in the sack. Just get your asses down here pronto,” he hung up.
“Well, get ready because we are here,” he gave Dean a sort of cheeky grin, grabbed his hand, and dragged him inside.
“I’m not a little kid, Dean. You don’t have to hold my hand everywhere,” his brother whined from the back seat.
“I don’t want to pressure him like that. Besides, I think it should be something independent of the dance. You know, because everyone is doing cutesy stuff right now, and it loses some of its effect. No offense, I’m sure what you made for Eileen was very sweet, and I wish you two the best. It’s just that I want this to be 100% our moment.”
“I don’t know. It’s just that if you get along with those people, maybe you should join. You don’t really talk much about anybody from robotics. Plus, you have autotech, so it’s not like you won’t get to mess around with machinery if you decide to quit.”
“No need. I kept emergency bags in the trunk of the Impala in case something like this would ever happen. Came close on a few occasions,” Dean sighed. “I guess I pushed him over the edge this time.”
“I haven’t seen you around here before. Are you a transfer?” the boy removed his hand from Dean’s shoulder and crossed his arms (not in a judgmental manner, more so for comfort while he waited for a response).
“I should be psyched, you know?” Dean began, “I mean, I’m going to the dance with Cas. That’s the dream. I should be breaking into the liquor cabinet for some champagne and celebrating, but I’m not.”
“Yeah. Nice guy. A lawyer. We had fun, but I don’t think I need to see him again. We don’t have much in common. He gave me his number though just in case I changed my mind.”
Dean checked his watch. His dad must’ve gotten off work early and decided to have an “afternoon treat” and a nap before going out. This was both good and bad news. Good because it meant that he could postpone his coming out a bit longer. Bad because he still wanted to apologize to Sam, and having John’s incessant snoring in the background would kind of taint the moment. It could be worse though. Sighing, he snatched a blanket from one of the chairs and threw it over the bastard. He didn’t bother to try and remove the beer bottle from his grip because it would only wake him (if John was going to be there, he preferred him to remain unconscious and unable to comment). Instead, he grabbed the unopened bottle John had left on the coffee table, and retreated to his and Sam’s bedroom.
“He got a new roommate in his dorm who is coeliac and because of the risk of cross-contamination, he can’t have bread in the dorm. So now he has to buy both lunch and dinner which… you know… adds up. So he’s opted for buying convenience store snacks for lunch and spending the majority of his money on dinner. But I don’t think the snacks are exactly what he’d call a lunch.”
Dean spends the next twenty minutes of his life wishing he was defeating the monster in the fortress, or even having another conversation with Hester, rather than watching Gilda and Charlie chatter back and forth. The heart eyes they are making at each other are atrocious and Charlie’s voice continues to rise higher in pitch, and Dean wonders if she’ll somehow reach a volume they are unable to hear.
“I guess I should thank you,” she says in lieu of a greeting, “although, you did keep me waiting here for a hundred years. Enjoy your nap?”
have a new case of beer, the location of their dinner was settled. He followed Dean across the yard and up the stairs and watched as he unlocked the door, opening it wide and letting Cas in for the first time.
want to do this. However he was strapped in and the cart had started moving... He knew there was no way he was getting himself off. He began to take deep breaths, inhaling in and out as slowly as he could. The ride was dark and everything was thrumming around him. There were music and sounds, which seemed to entertain the other passengers and hype them up further. Dean on the other hand, was prepared to meet his untimely death.
Dean sighs but nods, thanking her for her time. Despite his frustration, he knows yelling at the poor airport attendant isn’t going to fix anything. He steps away from the counter so that the next person can voice their complaints. He looks over towards the gate he’s meant to be at, wondering what the hell he’s going to do for the next ten hours. Should he read? Try buying a couple of books? Listen to his assortment of albums?
They sat down in the living room to eat, each with a beer in hand. They paused their eating intermittently to sign, learning bits and pieces about each other. Cas told Dean about his job and a bit about his family, how he and his brother were adopted as a sibling group. He talked about Gabe, who also was Deaf but was able to hear through the use of a Cochlear Implant. Their parents were both profoundly Deaf, like Dean. He watched intently as Dean told the story about becoming Deaf at a young age after contracting meningitis. The rest of his family were hearing but had learnt sign language from their neighbour, Missouri, who was also profoundly Deaf. It was her that had given Dean his sign name and the one that had enabled him to be integrated into the Deaf culture.
He watches as the realisation dawns upon her, and suddenly the words she was speaking are long forgotten. She abandons her coffee on her desk as she marches over to Dean, a fury in her gaze.
Dean looks around the room. While most things have been packed up and moved, one thing in the room still remains. It’s a little table by the window, decorated with candles and little trinkets. However, the main thing that stands out is painting.
back. Dean felt embarrassed and flustered and was quick to become tongue tied. He fumbled over the order, sounding completely insane as he attempted to remember how to talk. However, he got the order through along with all their details. He wasn’t hesitant to hang up the phone, mortified.
“One of my village’s finest warriors, Gilda, is currently eating in the dining hall. Go join her for breakfast and explain that I sent you. She has been prepared for this battle, she knows that she is to help a human, a
“I told you this story and you just laughed afterwards and gave me the biggest smile. I then pointed out the constellations to you and you
“All the time,” she says with a sigh. She stands up and passes Grace to Dean, while giving him a wink.
When Dean tells people about his husband, most people ask about the day they met. Being college sweethearts, most people expect to hear a grand story about a first meeting in class, or bumping into each other on campus. However, Dean’s story of meeting his husband is bland. In fact, he barely remembers the day they first were introduced. So instead, he likes to tell the story of their first lunch date.
He walks towards the elevator, making eye contact with the receptionist Tessa along the way. She smiles at Dean and waves in greeting, despite the phone that is perched between her shoulder and ear. Dean returns the greeting with a small hand wave of his own, and continues his journey to the elevators.
“Our beloved Kevin Tran, we bring you gifts from life into death.” Missouri repeated. “Commune with us, Kevin Tran, and move among us.”
Claire stumbled in that Wednesday afternoon at her normal time, looking more tired and exhausted than Dean had seen her. When she came up to the counter, she ordered her usual black coffee. Though as Dean was punching the drink into the till, she added something different to the order.
When their bodies finally regulated and they had sat down again, someone barging in startled them both. Dean went to reach for his sword but Castiel stopped him as he noticed who it was.
Beneath the veil of dark clouds, ash and rain, all Castiel could do was watch in horror as the blue beams from the fortresses disappeared. The buildings and their weaponry, once working for them, had been turned against them. He watched as one by one, dark waves of black covered the outer walls for each fortress, concealing them into the shadows, bringing them away from the light.
“Thank you.” He replied, dropping his hand from the amulet. “Now that I am here, what would you like to talk to me about?”
wake Cas. After he’d cleaned up, he made his way back into the bedroom and scavenged for his clothes on the dark carpeted floor. Chucking them on hastily, he then reached for his phone that was perched on one of the nightstands. He was glad he’d made the choice to leave his keys by the front door.
Dean just smiles and leans over to grab Cas’ hand, tugging him along as they begin their journey home.
When Dean reaches the main control room, the connection is severed. The room is a little different than the one in the Grasslands, but still the same in it’s function and purpose. Dean suspects what is going to happen before he has even stepped inside of the room, thanks to his last visit to a fortress. So he isn’t surprised that when he takes a couple of steps into the room, a figure appears.
I want to be there for both you and Grace. I want to have a family like this, like today, where I know I belong. I want to feed my daughter and sing her to sleep. I want to cook with you and eat breakfast with you. Hell, just the thought of us all being together and doing chores is enough to make me want to cry, Cas. Can we make this work? Because I’ve called Pam, and starting Monday I’m going to try and terminate my contract, and I need to
On their usual Wednesday afternoon, Claire sauntered up to the counter, pointing at one of Dean’s savoury items.
She ran up to the counter and slammed the car keys down, a gigantic smile filling up her entire face.
Dean’s mind is all muddled and he doesn’t know what to think. While he understands Cas’ words and knows exactly where he is coming from, it’s almost as if he suddenly feels the weight of the world on his shoulders. He wants to be there for Cas and Grace, and he knows that Cas’ demands are reasonable, but the ultimatum has been dropped on him far too unexpectedly for him to process.
while her brother’s is practically identical to Dean’s own. And while Tamsin ended up with green eyes just like her dad, Tommy ended up with blue eyes just like his Papa.
In Dean’s opinion, there was never a better feeling than to be validated. He still couldn’t believe that Cas reciprocated the feelings he had for him, that it wasn’t all in Dean’s head.
He thinks about their final night together, the memory popping into his head faster than he can stop it.
Dean used to tell himself that it could be worse. He thought about those who existed that were like him, whose loved ones died and still hung around as spirits. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to have a significant other who died and not to be able to touch them, to hold them, to kiss them. He used those thoughts to remind himself how lucky he was, that he had it easy compared to some.
“Are you sure I really am your soulmate? After all, I’m just a roadhouse chef who barely got their GED. I’m nothing compared to you, Mr Mighty Professor with a master’s degree. Why would you want me? Plus, what would have happened if you’d decided you didn’t really want me. Realised I wasn’t good enough for you? Huh? What would’ve happened then? Would you have just never told me? Have me realise later on, not knowing who or where my soulmate was. What would’ve happened then, Cas?”
“Cas…” he drawled, the nickname slipping out before he could stop it. Castiel was such a mouthful, even when he was just thinking the name in his head. Cas was simple and he couldn’t help but call the guy that in his head. However, he’d never addressed him as such. “Why aren’t you eating lunch?”
she says, pushing the button that opens the automatic doors to the offices, “but if Professor Novak is upset that you’re there so late, don’t put the blame on me.”
Nothing happens at first and The Empty attempts to get up from the puddle it has formed on the floor. However, not even a moment later, four bright lasers pierce from the sky bundling together to make a giant, magnificent one. That one laser goes straight into The Empty’s core, nearly tearing it apart from the inside out. Another inuman screech sounds, as The Empty melts further and further.
The Shurley family had gone out for an early dinner to celebrate Cas’ graduation. Being the youngest of the six siblings and by far the smartest, his graduation was a big deal. Hannah and her husband flew in from Seattle, Gabriel and Inias travelled down from North Dakota and Muriel made a special visit from Amsterdam, where she’d been living abroad. Despite seeing them from time to time, Dean didn’t really know the siblings well… but for Cas—they were his entire world. So it made sense they had a special meal as a family together.
He thought about Dean’s mother’s words from the previous month and the worry that had pooled in her eyes as she said them.
It will take time, of course, the kingdom will not be salvageable at this point. Almost every room in the castle needs to be repaired, with some of the outer walls and foundations destroyed. The village will need to be built from the ground up, in order to become a home once again for the new royal guard. Lord Inias is already beginning to recruit people to train, in order to become the new royal guard of Grace Island. He tells Castiel that he was inspired by Dean and the adventurous, courageous soul that the knight bestows.
Later that evening, Dean was studying in his room and was interrupted by a knock on the door. He looked up from his work to see Cas standing in the doorway. Dean rolled his eyes and went back to his work, muttering ‘go away’ knowing full well Cas couldn’t hear him.
The guilt, shame and frustration that had been simmering for weeks, finally made their way to the forefront of his mind. His stomach churned, his breath became uneven. He gulped down what could have either been a sob or his day’s lunch threatening to arise.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows, confused, “what about the prophecy? I thought you told my mother all that we needed to know.”
Dean stopped Cas but shaking his head. “Don’t Cas, I… it’s not that I don’t want to talk about it or anything. It’s just… I realise I was coming on too strong. I didn’t mean to lash out like that, say what I said in the way that I did… I just let it all rise to the surface and explode. So… for that I’m sorry.”
“Now why would you want that?” Missouri questions. “You have always seemed determined to do the opposite of whatever I say, Celeste.”
While Cas sits down, Dean turns the espresso machine on and helps the twins with their aprons. He hastily ties up Tamsin’s hair, knowing full well that her long hair would be bound to get in the mixing bowl. Her hair is a similar colour to Dean’s, albeit a little darker
“The four fortresses, the ones in each region, were taken over by The Empty a hundred years ago. The champions inside were never seen alive again and the buildings went dormant for a very long time. Recently, they have begun to send out distress signals again. We are unsure as to why, maybe due to Castiel’s power beginning to exhaust or they were forewarned of your return. Their weaponry is far too powerful to leave in the hands of The Empty, so it is your job to restore them.”
“You know the first time I ever had red velvet cake was on the day of my graduation.” Dean said. “The first time my mum ever attempted to bake it was for my graduation cake.”
In the late afternoon, they retreated to their room at the inn, to rest before supper. Dean laid on his bed, eyes closed as he napped. Castiel, on the other hand, read some of his father’s old journals, exploring all his late father knew about the ancient relics and technology. His training book, the one with the ancient words and phrases that he was supposed to practice every day, laid abandoned in the bottom of his satchel.
He turns around to see a man behind him, staring at him with crazed eyes. The man is tall, with sickly pale skin and a stare that screams
They gathered at Dean’s bakery for a drink, chatting and laughing about old anecdotes from their time in school. While Garth was in the middle of telling one of his
Truth was, he believed them wholeheartedly. He knew that Dean would always be there for him as for the past few months, Castiel had not gone a day without him. His knight had become the only stable thing in his life, always there, always reachable.
Castiel nodded, following after the knight, vowing to get his training day over with as quickly as possible.
Castiel stood alone, peacefully taking in the view. The champions were a few feet behind him, along with Dean, talking about their progress on mastering their fortresses. Hester, of course, talked over most of them in superior tones, while Meg attempted to take control of the conversation and lead it into a more progressive discussion. Benny and Anna, the less dominant of the champions, only contributed minimally. Dean stayed silent, which was unsurprising, but Castiel could tell he was listening intently. Most people seemed to forget Dean was there, due to how quiet he could be. It enabled Dean to observe people; their mannerisms, the way they spoke, the way they moved. It is what made him a good fighter as he was able to pick up on others weak spots and use their disadvantages to his advantage.
“Well I’ll be damned, I didn’t think there were good people still left in this world.” He states. “I actually can’t believe someone
They’re nearing the outskirts of the town, by the stable, when they are met by a man. He’s standing with his horse, brushing its mane in quick strokes. He watches them as they approach and the moment they get slightly closer, Charlie makes the both of them halt their horses.
Cas sighed but sent Dean a small smile. “I understand Dean… I realise that sometimes the way I speak to you isn’t appropriate for your age. It’s unintentional but still, not appropriate. I’m sorry that you feel that way.”
However, being the royal prince, he knew of his duties. Every civilian on Grace Island expected him to be a leader, the one responsible for the champions and defending the land against the evil beast. To everyone, he was a mere representative of battle, his body just a vessel for divine magic. His duty was to unlock this magic. If everyone, even his own mother, were to find out that he spent most of his time researching and fiddling with the mechanics of large machinery, who knows what kind of anger and animosity that would unleash on the population.
As the night wore on and Castiel spent the evening with his friends, he found himself distracted, unfocused on the impending battle, prophecy or his self-loathing feelings.
Before Dean can even blink, he is pulled into a half embrace by Cas. With Grace in his other arm, it’s a little awkward and Dean tries his best to manoeuvre around it. He rests his head on Cas’ shoulder, breathing in the scent of apple shampoo and aftershave that’s still present after all these months. Relief floods through him at the fact that he has finally made it. He is here; with his daughter and her father.
He let’s them in, letting them get settled in the living room before he showers and changes. As soon as he’s in more comfortable clothes, he begins the process of making dinner for them. Sam and Jess try to protest, saying that they can just order take-out after Dean has had to cook all day. But considering this is his brother and sister-in-law’s last night in town, there is no way Dean is going to turn down the opportunity to make them his specialty burgers.
Charlie Bradbury had been his friend since the 1st grade, when the two of them were forced to sit at the same group table in class. They grew up side-by-side, to the point that many predicted that they’d actually marry when they were older. However, that ideal shattered the moment Charlie began dating Gilda Fay in their freshman year of high school and they officially proclaimed themselves as Lawrence High’s honorary lesbian couple (that is until Gilda moved back to her hometown the summer before senior year causing a mutual break-up between the two). Dean had never seen Charlie as anything more than a friend, practically a sister and for a while, she was truly his only friend. That was until they met Benny midway through their freshman year, only a month after Charlie began dating Gilda. Almost instantly, the three of them became a trio, with Gilda occasionally joining them during lunches and outings. In the end, when it came down to applying for college, there was no doubt that all three of them would be going to Kansas University.
He reads two more letters during the time Pam is gone, before he decides to take a small break. His head is pounding from all the words he’s read and all the names of his fans that he’s trying to remember.
Cas got up from his seat and with one swift movement had cornered Dean so that his back was against the counter.
“Unfortunately, we have to learn the hard way that life sucks and sometimes, it ends terribly.” Meg states. “But the point is, fate always finds a way. Because here we are, in the roles we were destined to be, ready to destroy that monstrosity before he can take over our land.”
Dean nods and lets Cas pull him up. They make their way off the roof and back into the bed that they share. As soon as the covers are on, they are instantly drawn to each other. Dean takes comfort in the way Cas wraps his arms around him from behind. He feels Cas bury his head into the crook of his neck.
“I have been well, thank you Your Highness. I am glad to see that you travelled here safely.” John said. “I hope that my son has been upholding his duties.”
He takes off his own tie and unbuttons his own shirt just enough to pull the top of it down, exposing his left bicep. He continues to stare at Cas, taking a deep breath, attempting to prepare himself for what he’s about to see.
… We weren’t like that. Well… he wasn’t just a fling. I mean he was, but… I guess there was more to it. I felt something with him? And… like I said, I trusted him with that secret. He knew that I was only there temporarily, that I was going to leave. We agreed to not contact each other. Yet… if what you’re saying he wrote is true…”
Dean opened the lid and Cas could tell immediately from the wafting sense that it was an apple pie. The two of them had a couple of bites of it, enjoying the pleasant taste on their tongues before they began another conversation. Well, before
Dean’s message played in his head like a broken record, his slurred, deep voice and the words he spoke. Cas could recite it by heart, as the words had practically become ingrained in his brain, as if they were programmed directly into his neurons. It was a message that filled Cas with hope, but at the same time, it filled him with dread.
Tears began to prick his eyes and his mom immediately noticed. Realizing  her son was well on his way to a meltdown, Dean watched as his mother grabbed the basket from his hands and gave it to Michael, welcoming him to the neighbourhood. Dean then took his mom’s hands as she led him away from the house and back home. As they waited for a car to pass on the road, Dean turned his glazed eyes back to the doorway. Michael was still standing there, watching them leave with his brother clutching onto him. It was then he noticed the boy lifted his head up and was staring at Dean, his bright blue eyes filled with curiosity. Dean stared back for as long as he could before his mom lead him across the road and into their house.
“I’m sorry that your previous loves were unable to make it work with you. I am sorry that they made you feel this way. However, I am glad that it led you to me.”
He remembered hearing Cas shift behind him and suddenly, the spirit was right next to him and the book had magically re-opened to the page Dean had last left it on.
“Don’t tell me you’re scared! Scared of me? Wow, I’m flattered. I suppose you should be, considering how easy it was to kill those creatures of yours.”
Missouri looked over at the book that stood next to both of them. As Castiel was now closer to the book, he noted that it was leather bound, embroidered with words in a language he did not know.
Dean debates it for a moment, wondering if he should just walk away and leave Cas there holding his business card out to thin air. But he decides he’s not that much of an asshole and knows deep down, he wants to have a way to reach Cas. He doesn’t know if that’s actually
“He’s deaf,” He growled out, signing the words at the same time. The man narrowed his eyes, whereas his neighbour’s lit up. “He’s trying to communicate to you with his phone. But you are ignoring him and instead being disrespectful and offensive.”
He watches as Cas heads through to his bedroom, pausing for a moment when he gets to the hall. He turns to look at Dean.
Castiel internally sighed, clenching his fists slightly. He should have expected that every day of his visit would mean answering this exact question. Really, he should have prepared for it, come up with the perfect, scripted response. He opened his mouth to reply, ready to give the same response he gave Hester. However, as he went to reply, he realised that Benny was still talking.
Dean realised that in the world of Disney and make believe, they would describe that moment as a fairy tale ending or a 'happily ever after.' Dean on the other hand, would never be able to describe his life like that. There were still monsters out there and a world filled with cold blooded evil. There were still nightmares to endure and lives to be sacrificed. He knew his life was still in for a whirlwind of pain and suffering, one he would never
Dean wishes he could say that the fight was gruesome, horrifying, the scariest he has ever faced. However, after seeing how weak The Empty had become after the monsters were destroyed. He finds it all too easy to fight it.
Now, as he neared the city he called home, he just hoped that Dean would forgive him for everything.
After a few minutes of making out, the both of them stopping before it got too steamy, the two of them laid back on Dean’s bed, relaxing into his memory foam mattress.
Claire was quick to pack her bag, not needing much apart from the basic essentials. In the driveway she gave hugs goodbye to both Alex and Jody. Jody giving Claire some money for gas and food, while Alex promised Claire she would collect her schoolwork for her.
Crowley leads them across the desert, back the way they came. By the time they are nearing the bottom of the mountain, the sun is high in the sky and sweat drips down the back of Dean’s neck. He can see why he hates the desert, the feeling all over his body is just disgusting and entirely uncomfortable.
Turns out the address was only a good 15 minutes away, in a small suburban part of Lawrence. Along the way she passed the main high school, with the adjacent middle school—having no doubt that this is where Dean and Cas attended. She passed a couple of elementary schools, but had no idea which one was the one from the stories.
They don’t bring up the fact that Dean’s ignored their calls, chatting about random topics while Dean cooks and prepares the food. At first, Dean wonders if maybe he’s in the clear. However, as soon as they sit down at the table and sees the couple’s gazes pointed straight at him, he knows he’s not.
When spring break rolled around a couple of months later, Cas had spent the entirety of his break at Dean’s place. Despite living right next door, he found that he rarely went back to his own home, unless he needed a change of clothes. He could barely remember a minute where he wasn’t sitting beside Dean, or making out with Dean, or dragging Dean to the bedroom…
Without even thinking, Dean leant over and touched Cas. It first started with his fingers slowly seeping into his energy just like he’d done earlier that night. He watched as Cas closed his eyes as if he were in a bliss and hummed a low, deep sound that rumbled from the back of his throat. Dean carefully reached in further feeling the energy as it pulsed around his hand.  The more he reached in, the more Cas seemed to seize up as if he were in shock and pant softly.
Her heart was beating rapidly in her chest and swallowing hard, she got out of the car. She walked across the road, away from the Winchesters and over to the Shurleys. It was so weird that only days ago, she was just listening to these stories. It was almost strange that now she was
They stop just before the car park, near the rear of the building, so Cas can take a call from Gabriel. He props Dean up against the wall so that he can answer the phone, letting his brother know where he is, and for Gabriel to tell him he’s made it home safe. Dean continues to sway as he stands there, hoping that when they proceed to Cas’ car, that he’ll be able to get right up against Cas again.
They both chuckled whereas the man seemed irritated that he couldn’t understand. But fortunately, he stormed back to his SUV without another word. With a salute, his neighbour headed to reverse the Chevy, leaving Castiel alone with his food and thoughts. As he stood in the yard, he couldn’t help but feel a wave of guilt crash down on him. Suddenly, his first interactions with his neighbour made sense and he couldn’t help but realise how much of an asshole he was. Of course he wouldn’t have heard Castiel’s calls, or the knocks on the door. Of course his doorbell made no sound, it was most likely a flashing doorbell. He began to put the pieces together and the more he connected the dots, the worse he felt.
“No!” Dean yells, startling Cas again, “screw you, Cas! You just played with my feelings all night, trying to determine whether I was good enough for you. That’s not what a soulmate does. I… I
grade. It’d first begun as them both dressing up as pirates, then moved into sidekick pairings such as Batman and Robin. This year they were going as Bonnie and Clyde, a movie the two boys snuck out of the Winchester’s video drawer and watched late one night. The boys became obsessed with the movie from that point onwards. At first all the adults had been reluctant to let the boys continue their fascination. However, after some time and a lot of discussion, the adults eventually gave in.
Although Dean didn’t know Hannah well, the second eldest sibling having never lived at home from the time Dean knew Cas, he was happy for her. He’d met her at the annual camping trips and saw the way she nurtured Castiel—he knew she would be a great mother.
“Yes, I suppose I am,” Castiel replies with a sigh, “I just cannot help but worry. With all the new travellers here on our island, I worry that this was not the right choice to make.”
Yet, he can’t help but feel restless at the thought of standing still and not facing the danger head on.
Dean and Cas sat on the sidewalk for the rest of the afternoon, only being interrupted by Michael coming out to give them hats and sunscreen. The two of them ate the whole batch of brownies as Cas went on a tangent about his entire time camping, only having to stop every now and then by Dean who was struggling to catch up. Most of Cas’ comments came from the subject of Balthazar, Cas claiming his cousin whined the entire trip and he’d kicked Cas in his sleep.
In fact, Dean didn’t know anyone who was LGBT until he went to college. In high school, you wouldn’t second guess a male or female being straight. It was just… how life
“Hello!” He repeated again, doing a slight jog so that he could get closer. This time the man had stopped reading the mail but instead of turning around, he just walked straight into his house and shut the door behind him. As it slammed closed, Cas was left standing alone in front of the house, feeling dejected. Had the man purposefully ignored him? He tried to rationalise it. Maybe he was deep in thought? He did seem focused on reading his mail. A cold feeling crept into Cas as he couldn’t help but wonder if the man
Steam practically rose from the path as Castiel journeyed up Purgatory Mountain. It was hot there with the late morning sun beating down on them. Castiel felt too warm in his travel attire, the long sleeves constricting the heat on his skin. Dean, who walked a step behind him, was more fortunate with his shorter sleeves. The sleeves ended just below his shoulder, making his entire ensemble much less hot and restricting as Castiel’s.
Bobby looked at him with fond eyes, a thoughtful gaze on his face, before giving a slight nod of his head.
Dean watched as the fireworks began to explode, shooting straight up into the night sky. Upon seeing Cas’ face, Dean realised that he'd never seen fireworks before. The way they detonated in the sky creating a colour show that most would describe as beautiful. Yet Dean wasn’t watching the firework show like everyone else. He’d seen a million fireworks, even set a few off himself. All he could focus on and he all he cared about focusing on was the way Cas’ face lit up like the current sky.
Eventually, they stumble across a camp along the path. The monsters are a mix, both werewolf and vampires. Despite the fact that they are holding torches, they both take the monsters out in a clean sweep, their bodies left rotting on the ground as they continue onwards. Charlie’s skills with a sword never cease to impress him, how mighty and fierce she is. She’s a girl who lost her parents and who has had her peers turn against her. He wonders if that is what fuels her fight, makes her as strong and determined as she is.
“I am… I am here at the first fortress. The one in the Grasslands.” He can’t help but whisper, as if the fortress can hear his every word. “Do you think you can help me get inside?”
They’re both silent for a moment, a tension lingering between them, before they both open their mouths to speak.
His lunch wasn’t particularly healthy to say the least, but the mix of a sandwich, chips and cookies was definitely a well-rounded lunch in Dean’s opinion. Castiel seemed happy too and that was a win in his book.
“Cas, I’m so sorry, I… this is a bad idea,” he gasps out, “we both know that if we keep this up, it’s just going to lead to awkwardness between us. This can’t lead anywhere, not when we’ve both got soulmates out there… I… I’m sorry, I just want us to be friends.”
They munch on some apples and drink some water. The sun is warm on their backs, soaking through their clothes and onto their skin.
Lady Billie sat at her desk, a sturdy piece of furniture carved out of the finest oak, a present to her from the prince. For she had been the one who had forewarned him of the current events, and warned him of The Empty’s rampage. If the prince had been anything like his father, Billie was sure she would have been sent to the dungeons. He was an unbeliever, despite the power that nestled hungrily in his veins. His son however, was a kind soul full of wisdom and honesty. It was his soul that saved the people, performing his duties and preventing the entity from rising.
They watched her leave down the hill, towards the entrance to the desert. They stood in silence for a moment, neither of them quite knowing what to say. He watched Dean scan the area, checking to make sure that no monsters or unwanted visitors were lurking nearby.
The entrance to the desert was through a chasm, which was lined between two large sedimentary rock formations. Without the chasm, it would be a challenge to access the desert, unless one were to scale and climb over. On the other end of the chasm was the stable, where Castiel and Dean left their horses. The poor horses were tiring, having travelled far in the span of a few days. Castiel was grateful that they were returning home tomorrow, so that the horses would be able to rest.
“I can’t help my curiosity, considering I am yet to turn twentyfcive,” Hannah, Hester’s sister, responded. She looked similar to Hester, with the same blue eyes, skin and clothing. However, Hannah’s hair was a rich brown, making her bright blue eyes much more noticeable.
“I don’t know! A psychic, a medium, a freaking hoo doo witch? All of the above? I don’t know Dean but you have to work it out.”
“Good. We shall, of course, provide you with the things you will need. Food, clothing, armour and some coins for your travels. I know this is asking so much of you, Dean, especially after such a long sleep and a currently confusing reality, but I swear to you that the boy I once knew, who I know is deep down in there somewhere, would be offering to do this in a heartbeat. This duty, it is your destiny, it is in your blood.”
And when he saw Dean in front of him, trying to decide between salsas, he knew that the year wouldn’t have been amazing if it weren’t for him. The amount of happy memories they shared, the wonderful experiences they had together, the amount of times that Dean made Cas laugh. It often surprised Cas just how many times he could fall in love with Dean Winchester -- because it happened over and over and over again.
They packed up the food after they finished eating, putting it all into the trash can in Dean’s kitchen. Dean ended up shoving Cas away at some point, signing:
Hester led them over to her training area just outside of the village. It was upon a small cliffside, where a large pillar had been built. The pillar had numerous different targets nailed to it, perfect for archery. While the fae were powerful creatures with magic, they also trained heavily in the art of the bow and arrow. Their ability to fly made it easy for them to shoot at different vantage points, making them highly skilled at taking down enemies from the sky. When Castiel had first visited the village many months ago, Hester was well-known as the best archer and flier. She was a hero amongst some of the younger faeries, who spoke her name with such reverence. While Castiel agreed that the faery was highly skilled, he knew that the compliments she received did nothing to help her ego.
“I’ve only been here once before… back when I was 16.” Dean said. “Remember when I told you about Sonny’s?”
He would never forget the look of betrayal in Dean’s eye, the sadness that laid underneath his mask of happiness. Dean had tried to be happy for him, Cas could see that. He was grateful for his friend’s attempts to support him, through helping him find an apartment, to packing up his childhood bedroom. But he knew that ultimately, Dean was clouded by sadness and was unable to understand why Cas had made this decision. Cas didn’t blame him, for it was a secret that he wouldn’t dare tell Dean.
Dean’s stomach dropped, as if he’d swallowed a bowling ball full of lead. He thought he was prepared for the idea of him and Cas not going to the same universities, but actually knowing it was true, hurt more than he could imagine.
The name registered to Dean upon seeing the girl in front of him sign. He remembered the favour Jody asked him those many weeks ago, when she popped into the bakery during her lunch break. She told Dean about her new foster child and how she was mute. Claire was literate and could communicate through typing/writing but Jody worried Claire would struggle not being able to communicate in ASL. So she asked, or practically begged, Dean to agree to meet Claire and chat with her.
Together, they looked over at Dean, who had begun walking over to them with the other champions. He glanced back at Meg quickly, who shot him a wink. He felt the blood rush to his cheeks.
“I have several siblings, yes, but my older brother, Gabriel, is by far the most invasive. After I came out, he started stealing my phone and reading my texts because he thought I might have a secret boyfriend.”
“Well congratulations! But if you are getting hitched too, then what’s with the banner and everything? We should be celebrating all of us.”
Dean tripped on Sam’s feet on that second round. He cursed under his breath. Sam reassured him that it would be alright, and rewound the song. The second time, Dean got it perfectly.
“Hey guys,” Dean turned around to see his brother in the doorway with his jacket over his arm and a bottle of wine in his hand. “Sorry to interrupt. Just wanted to say that I’m heading out.”
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas noticed the change in the other’s energy, and concern crossed his face.
“I called and asked if we could push it back an hour because I wanted to see you off,” Michael informed him. “And I wanted to meet this boy of yours,” he turned towards Dean. “I’m assuming this is him?”
“I’m not going to say it explicitly because, like you said, you could ‘spontaneously combust’, but yes, it’s reciprocated.”
No...Dean shook his head. Cas would kill him if he knew he was beating himself up again. That’s one of the things Dean loved most about him because he wanted Dean to believe in himself more and to remember that he was indeed worthy of being loved. It was difficult at times, but he had gotten better with it since the two of them officially got together. Cas meant everything to him, and Dean wanted nothing else than to call him his husband.
Cas’s eyes fluttered open. He looked around, temporarily failing to remember where he was. Then he looked up at Dean, and it clicked.
“Oh, uh, I think his name was Castiel. I was standing in front of his booth. He was just telling me a little about the school.”
It took Cas a moment to process those words, namely the last one. Though they both acknowledged one another as father and son, Jack had never actually used the term “Dad” before. Hearing it made the angel’s cheeks warm up. He tightened his grip on the boy, burying his face in Jack’s neck.
“You’re such a dork,” Dean chuckled. “But you’re cute, so I guess I’m going to have to give you a pass.”
Dean sighed and set the bottle down on the nightstand before settling onto his bed. He was facing towards Sam, but his brother kept his gaze on whatever he was working on.
“Well, if there’s anything I can do to help with the transition, let me know,” he held out his hand. “My name’s Castiel.”
“That’s really sweet, Castiel. I can’t wait to see the look on Dean’s face when...” he was cut off by the sound of the bunker door closing.
“I think he’s got everything to do with it,” John growled. “Afterall, he’s the one who turned you into a fucking fairy.”
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you again for the encouragement today. I needed that and couldn’t have done this without you.
“You must understand that this does not reflect the school’s view or my own, but Ms. Shurley believes drawing attention to sexuality encourages students to...well, let’s just say she thinks the topic is more adult-oriented, and she views teenagers as being too young to be thinking about stuff like that. Of course I recognize the ignorance in that, and I think it is important for students to be open about who they are, but I’m afraid there’s not much I can do. I’ve tried consulting with her individually, but we couldn’t come to an agreement. I terminated her membership in the PTA for misconduct, but that unfortunately hasn’t deterred her. And now it seems she’s found reinforcements.”
“I’ll go in, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to return to the group just yet. I’m still a little shaky.”
“So if you aren’t going to get rid of the club or call off the picket line, then why exactly are we here?” Crowley demanded.
“It’s not that simple,” Cas finally met his gaze, “I am attracted to you. Aesthetically, you’re very handsome, and emotionally, I think you have a beautiful soul and the biggest heart of anyone I know. I would love nothing more than to be in a relationship with you,” he sighed again. “The problem lies in the sexual aspect. The idea of sex has never interested me and, to be quite honest, it makes me uncomfortable.”
“You were gone less than two hours,” Cas patted him on the chest. “Still, I’m glad you’re here. Look what Jack brought us,” he reached for the drawing.
“I feel like an old-fashioned movie villain,” Dean pretended to twirl the stache. “What do you think?”
“I can see by the look in your eyes how much you care,” Michael continued. “It’s a relief to know that Castiel has someone in his life that makes him feel loved in that way. For the longest time, I was afraid he would never find that,” he sighed when he saw the two of them join hands. “And now that he has, I am hopeful, but I admit it may take me some time to adjust. However, I want you to know that you have my blessing.”
Dean shut his laptop, which he was using to email Cas, and grabbed his phone off the charger. Doing his best to avoid waking his brother, he tip-toed out of the bedroom and closed the door behind him for privacy. He switched his phone to silent just in time for Cas’s name to show up. Settling into the couch, he noticed it wasn’t just an audio call. It was Skype. Cas really was being adventurous. He smiled and slid his finger across the screen to answer.
“Oh come on, Michael. They’re exhausted. It’s not like they’re going to be doing anything but sleeping,” Gabriel replied.
“Live and learn,” Dean shrugged. “Anyway, that’s the one. If I remember correctly, the burgers were pretty awesome.”
“Yea, actually Sammy has been trying to get me to eat healthier, so he’s been insisting on me bringing my own lunch rather than eating cafeteria food. It’s not as good as a burger and fries, but it keeps me going so I guess that’s what matters,” Dean shrugged. “Doesn’t mean I don’t give him shit about it on the daily.”
“Jack! You know better,” Cas tried to use his best scolding voice, but the effort was futile as Dean’s face was too ridiculous, and he couldn’t stop smiling.
“Alright, but this time try not to burn it. Takes forever to get rid of the smell,” Dean laughed, and Cas gave him an annoyed look. “Just be careful.”
“I’m just glad it fits. To be honest, I wasn’t sure what size to get,” Dean cleared his throat, awkwardly.
“All sorts. Those things are generally a mix of different filled candies. Uh, coconut, raspberry cream, nuts, some are kinda fudgey.”
“It sucks,” Dean continued, “but you’re not responsible for his decisions. It’s his loss anyway because you’re an amazing person.”
“There’s some tinfoil in one of these drawers. Pick which one you want and wrap it up. I can spot you for a small package of chips from the vending machine too, if you want.”
“Jo’s waiting for me outside. I said I’d walk her to her car,” Charlie informed them. “I better go,” she gave them both a hug and turned to walk away, holding a peace sign over her shoulder. “Later bitches.”
He set down the plate he had just finished drying and turned to face his son. Whatever liveliness that had been on his face earlier had vanished. He didn’t seem angry per say but he was definitely not on board with where this conversation was headed.
Dean glanced at the page and struggled to hold back a smile. Noticing his amusement, Castiel groaned and explained that he still used the same email from when he was in elementary school. It meant that he could maintain access to old conversations, and it saved him the trouble of keeping track of another username and password. A valid point, but Dean would be lying if he said it wasn’t the sweetest and, dare he say, most adorable thing he had ever seen. The address in question read “mythoughtfulspot.castiel@yahoo.com.” His grin only widened the more Cas’s eyes narrowed.
“Hey guys!” Dean called to the others to alert them of his departure. “I forgot my phone in one of the dressing rooms. I’m going to go look for it.”
“I almost forgot to give this to you,” Cas said with a smile. “You’re probably going to think this is cliche, but I thought it would look nice,” he slipped the corsage onto Dean’s wrist.
