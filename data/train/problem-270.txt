I didn’t believe him, but I behaved myself anyway, keeping still whilst he opened the tin of Vaseline so that he might prepare me. By now, the feeling of his fingers inside me was familiar and welcome, though it also made me impatient and overeager. I made a show of lifting my hips and making greedy noises, proving to him that my body not only needed but
rattling round my brain (perhaps not a cheerful song, but it is a favorite of mine). A little later in the day a client would be stopping by with a promising case, but for now I had not much to occupy me, so to pass the time I drew a hot bath. Not being able to take the violin in with me, I hummed the sonata as I scrubbed myself. Once I was clean, I was quite comfortable and not keen to get out, so I turned the faucet for more hot water and relaxed.
He pissed for a long while; I watched his prick twitch minutely as he unleashed this torrent. When the gush diminished to a trickle, he pushed a little on his lower abdomen, making sure he got everything out. A few final little spurts and he was finished. He then held himself between thumb and forefinger to shake the last drop from the tip, then pulled the chain. When he turned his head to see if I had been watching all along, I let the corner of my mouth twitch upwards, to tell him that I had indeed.
These items were, as the French call them,
“I need to take lots of time to prepare you very carefully, don’t I?” Watson said, as his fingers slid leisurely in and out.
Watson held the envelope by the corners between his fingertips, then sat at the desk and said, “Allow me to attempt once more to employ your methods.”
Watson was already fully hard in his trousers, and he was more generously proportioned than I, so from the moment his prick sprang from his opened flies I knew that I had a formidable challenge ahead of me. But I had not one thought of shying away – though I admit I may have lingered longer on the kisses and long licks before attempting to fit him into my mouth.
,” I gasped.
Finally, Holmes lay flat on his back, and with Watson’s assistance lifted his legs so that his ankles could rest on Watson’s shoulders. Watson went back to the pot of petroleum jelly and applied some more to himself, then gripped Holmes around the knees, and after inserting himself once again, pumped Holmes at a steady pace.
“Your timing is fortuitous,” I said, lounging in my chair before the fireplace as he hung up his overcoat and hat. “Mrs. Hudson is bringing up dinner shortly.” I then favoured him with that same heated gaze I had been the target of, my eyes darting from top to toe, then caressing from toe to top. He did not acknowledge what I had done, but seated himself in his chair opposite mine, and stretched his legs out.
As he did this, he opened his legs and bent his knees, and Watson, after wetting his middle finger thoroughly in his own mouth, leaned over Holmes’ splayed body and placed that wet fingertip…well, into Holmes’ fundament, if I can be quite frank. I want to say that this was the most depraved thing I had ever witnessed, and so I will say it, but I cannot deny that there was a tenderness to it that I never would have imagined could exist. Watson stroked Holmes’ hair with his free hand, and Holmes made contented little noises, and sometimes he would take Watson out of his mouth just to smile or giggle at him, or to receive a gentle kiss.
symptomatic of bodily impurity?
“That’s right,” Watson murmured. What he did next with his member, I did not think it was actually possible to do, from an anatomical standpoint. After all, Holmes had been having trouble getting all of it in his mouth, and now he was going to try fitting it all in
He unfastened the button with deliberate, excruciating slowness. He was tantalising me into such a frenzy, I was growing near to my crisis just from the anticipation, but I held back, wanting to see how much he would reveal to me. He undid the second button, then the third, and my toes curled. “Please,” I whispered.
I thought then of Watson – because I always thought of Watson when confronted with the erotic. Watson was the only person who had ever provoked such feelings in me. He did not know this, of course, for to reveal these sentiments would be to compromise everything – my work, my reputation, our friendship. But in quiet moments, I indulged in them. And this I did now. I held the phalluses in my hand, examined the craftsmanship, and wondered if perhaps this one, or perhaps that one, more closely resembled the noble and virile instrument that my Watson undoubtedly possessed.
“Then you’ll forgive my haste in bringing our picnic to a decisive conclusion,” I said, wrapping up the remaining cheese and meat and putting it in the basket.
“Shall I go on like this,” Watson asked, “or shall we try a third finger?”
These books all agreed, however, that the solitary indulgence which the above behaviours resulted in was a wholly unnatural, degrading, injurious, destructive activity, and the primary reason why the youth of the day were delicate and enfeebled, with sunken eyes, blanched cheeks, withered hands, and emaciated frame. Looking at my own pale, thin body in the mirror when undressing at night, I saw not all, but some of these qualities, and was repulsed by myself, even if I had not been indulging in the dreaded pastime.
I froze. In a moment, Watson was leaning in the doorway and his eyes were upon me. There was absolutely no way I could make this look like anything other than what it was. I could do nothing at all, in fact, but stare Watson in the face, with the dildo inside me and my mouth open in shock.
He made no attempt to keep his prick away from my mouth, however, nor did he keep himself from mine. We both found a particular and wicked amusement in sucking each other when one of us was engaged – or pretending to be – in some other pastime: He would sneak between my thighs whilst I was absorbed in the morning paper, or I would ask him to read aloud to me once again from one of his novels, only this time seeing how long he could recite coherently whilst I was devoting myself to applying the most tantalising lingual pressure.
My prick, untouched and still at only a half-stand, was now drooling a continuous strand of fluid as I gave myself the most wonderful stimulation. I did it so much, I began to lose control of my lungs and throat, and a few grunts turned into a joyous cry. I silenced myself at the instant I was able, but not soon enough. I was utterly still for a moment, listening for the footsteps of an inquisitive person come to investigate, but heard nothing.
Mrs. Hudson seemed fondest of Watson. She never commented, as Holmes and I did, on his simplicity, his occasional downright dim-wittedness. Frankly, I often wondered if his visits were just for her benefit; Holmes, though he’d called Watson a friend for so many years, seemed not to benefit from his company at all, as far as I could see. I had not been surprised, those few years ago, when Watson and Mrs. Hudson had both remarked on what a worthy companion I was for Holmes; an intellectual equal was what he really needed around.
When Watson was finished, he invited me to sit back and relax against him. I settled in, leaning my full weight on him. He put his arms around me and buried his face in the crook of my neck. I tilted my head up a little to accommodate him, and said, “I want you to bugger me.”
He turned out to be not so willing to relinquish complete control, because he continued to hold me and help me move. At my breathless request he squeezed my prick while I rode, but with his other hand he pushed on my hipbone with his thumb to nudge me back, or dug his fingertips into my arse to pull me forward. As it became clear that we were drawing near to a mutual glory he planted his feet on the bed and began to push upwards into me. It felt lovely, though, not too intense, and all along he continued to praise me. I have some doubts about how handsome I actually looked flailing about with my jaw hanging open, but to Watson I was apparently an absolute treasure.
Watson applied the Vaseline to himself, unhurried, drawing it out because he knew I was watching in torment. At last he got his thighs underneath mine, snaking one arm under my knee to lift it higher and using the other to aim himself.
reach for his knee to squeeze it, believing that to be the most appropriate way to show my appreciation to my beloved. Or I would announce that I was retiring for the evening, and then standing in my bedroom, I would turn around, disappointed that he had not followed me, as I had expected. Though I’ve been accused of living too much in my own head, I had always considered myself to be a man with a solid grip on reality, and yet here I was, momentarily believing that my wish for a more intimate companionship with Watson had come true.
as you can, and I shall spend.”
His suspicion was correct; he cooked up a fine meal even though I pestered him throughout the task, as I had not yet tired of being the constant centre of his attention. I decided mid-meal that I would have to match his culinary gesture with one of my own, so I promised him that for breakfast the following morning I would make crepes, using my maternal grandmother’s recipe. I did not mention that I had only seen the recipe once (I was certain that I had memorised it perfectly then), nor that I had never actually attempted to make crepes – but how difficult could it be, if one followed the directions?
When he judged my oversensitive whimpering too pathetic to prolong, Watson withdrew his fingers, leaving a gentle ache. The intensity of it lingered, in my shallow breaths and exhausted limbs. Watson loomed over me, pleased with his work but not having found his own finish yet.
“I’ll do better next time,” I said, mortified.
Watson seemed dumbfounded by my about-face, amazed that he could have done any such thing as convince me to go against my stubborn ways, but I ignored this and set immediately to composing a reply to Waugh’s letter.
It had not occurred to me that Holmes could ever be susceptible to such indelicate desires, but there was no doubt now that Watson ignited something distinctly carnal in him. He extricated himself from Watson’s arms only long enough to open the drawer of the bedside table and take from it a tin. I recognized the label: it was petroleum jelly. He showed it to Watson, but did not open it yet, just tossed it on the bed.
Rather than go out for dinner, Watson suggested we stay in, and he would make us some simple but hearty fare: bangers and mash. “I haven’t attempted it since I was in the army, but I can’t imagine I’ve lost the knack.”
I sat on the bed and looked at the tin for a long while, hesitant, but not so much so that I had any thought of setting it aside for another time. At last, I could stand my own dithering no longer, and smeared the cold cream over the tip of the smaller phallus, then laid on my back with my legs spread wide, my knees bent, and my feet flat on the mattress. I had not done anything like this before, but I felt I had enough anatomical knowledge to make a go of it. I clutched my bollocks and half-hard prick and lifted them slightly aside so I could fit the end of the dildo against my aperture. Blindly but with purpose, I slid it up and down until I could nudge the thing into the right place. It was slow going, as my body’s eagerness did not match that of my heart. But eventually it admitted the tip, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Surely that was the most difficult part. I continued to push, and with the help of the slippery cold cream it slid in, not easily but steadily.
“It’s alright,” I insisted. “Push it in me.”
“Anything at all I can do for you, I am at your service,” he said, and only jostled me a little as he strained to reach the book on the bedside table.
Sometimes he would pause in his quixotic recollections, and there would be silence between us, and I could hear him inhaling the sea air deeply. I remembered the advice I’d read in one of those hygiene books as a child:
I opened my eyes, and my mouth twisted in contemplation. The truth was, I had no idea if it would feel good for me, and cared so little whether it did that I had not given much thought to it. It seemed as though such an act ought to be painful, or at the very least uncomfortable, but then again, men risked the gallows for it, so there must have been something to it. Really, my only desire had been to give every part of myself to Watson, to prove that I was holding back nothing from him. I did not want to say this, so instead, I replied, “Am I not allowed to think only of you and your pleasure?”
“Oh, not for hours yet.”
But this stimulation made me dizzy as the last of my inhibitions dissolved, and I could remain silent no longer. I broke the kiss to beg, “Watson, listen to me.”
Once he was fully engorged, he frigged himself in earnest, his bollocks jiggling as he worked. All this watching and being watched had me in a frenzy, splashing water all about and onto the floor. I looked into his eyes, daring him to climax first.
Having at last read every word of these books, I came to only one certain conclusion: that I must maintain my bodily integrity at any cost. And that, to me, meant a life of disciplined solitude. Rather than try to navigate these complex and mystifying requirements, perfect chastity of both mind and body seemed the plain and easy rule. I would continue to make careful habits of proper bodily maintenance, and eschew licentious exercises of the mind, and if I avoided marriage, I would not be obligated to puzzle out the precise amount of sexual indulgence to keep my organs intact and my mind sharp without driving some unfortunate woman to uterine epilepsy.
Watson only chuckled at my ire. “I know you’re embarrassed. That is precisely the point. Holmes, I am prepared to give you everything you want. I would make a seven-course meal of you every night, if you’ll permit me. But before I do, you must show me that you can make yourself vulnerable before me. You are a prideful man, and I won’t be satisfied with you giving me only a sliver of yourself because you fear the loss of your precious dignity.”
Watson had brought along a couple of Clark Russell novels, which he set on the bedside table, and as I got under the covers, I asked if he would read aloud to me.
I was almost in danger of giving Watson the impression that I was moribund, with how I struggled to hide my glee at the prospect of inciting his passions far from home: steepling my fingers, I sighed and closed my eyes. “Very well. I cannot predict what machinations of the criminal class I might be called upon to investigate between now and then, but we shall depart on the first day after the tenth that I have all my affairs in order here in London.”
“I would welcome it,” I said, “as I am lacking any other light entertainment at the moment.”
Though perhaps startling, this new place to which my mind was roaming was not fearful to me. I did not crush the feeling out of fright, as I had done at other times in the past when I’d begun to entertain the least sort of amorous inclination for someone. I suppose it was the trust I placed in Watson, which made me believe that the citadels of my body and mind were not threatened by these thoughts. Instead of discarding them, I desired to unfold them and examine them minutely, seeing where they would take me, if I relaxed and let my heart direct my mind. When my eidetic memory could not provide me with all I wished to see in my mind’s eye, I began to alter, to supplement as it were, the memory of Watson’s valour with things that I surmised about his body: I pictured him subduing the burglar whilst shirtless, his muscles visibly straining, his skin glowing with perspiration from his heroic exertions. In these imaginings, his shoulders were broad, his chest deep, his arms thick.
Those books were invaluable to forming my character: Anatomy and zoological texts facilitated experiments I performed with small wild animals I caught. Botany texts were brimming with information about the potential, often the
“Now, I could go on like this,” he said, “and I’d be happy to. But I could also instead introduce you to an instrument which is perhaps not as sizeable but which has a bit more life in it.”
Watson’s rhythm did not falter as he replied, “Yes, my dear, please, so I can watch you.”
We hadn’t quite made it to the high street, however, when we were stopped cold by the sight of a wailing boy, sitting on a stoop, tears streaming down his face. Watson stepped forward to comfort him. “There, there, my lad, what’s there to cry about on so splendid a day?”
But it mattered little to me by then whether damnation or syphilis awaited those who paid illicit tribute to Venus or not, and it wouldn’t have mattered all, except for my profession. Crime was what interested me, and to know everything there is to know about crime, one must understand every dark facet of human life. It became a point of pride to me, that I could investigate lurid matters without being biased by my own fears, jealousies, or sympathies. My closed heart knew no favouritism. I could also rest easy knowing I need not fear that any havoc might be wreaked on my mind or body by disease, by mercury treatments, or by – most insidious of all – erotic emotion.
The following morning, I had already been sitting at the breakfast table with the newspaper for an hour when I heard Watson begin to stir upstairs. I spent the next twenty minutes steeling myself for the moment of his arrival, practicing at behaving the way I had done in his presence for the last several years. At last, he came down to join me, and I wished him a good morning as if nothing untoward had happened the night before. Being a more proper gentleman than I, Watson always came to breakfast fully dressed, down to his jacket. That morning, I was for the first time despondent about his never having picked up my habit of lounging about in nightshirt and dressing gown when feeling particularly lazy and purposeless, as such a habit would have enabled me to see an inch or two more of his bare skin, and to feel the intimacy of seeing him rumpled, softened, disheveled.
“May I look at the contents?”
It was a well-earned quiet confederacy that my friend and colleague John Watson and myself were enjoying that late spring evening. Watson was reading one of his Clark Russell novels, I was catching up on the
And all of this was
His tone was oddly troubled, and I sat up and turned so I might look at his face. Was it pity I saw? Was what I was offering pitiful somehow?
“True gratitude would have been to bring me another case,” I sighed. But Watson was right on all counts, and I told him so.
He gazed intently at me, which made it difficult to say what I meant to say, so I averted my eyes before I told him, “There will never be another like you for me, so you must promise me that you will never leave me, that we’ll go on like this together, so long as we remain in this world.”
His eyes glimmered with a new mischief. “I am a man of my word.”
I nearly favoured Watson with a lengthy speech about how very little it mattered to me how hot or stuffy or hazy or odiferous London was; bodily comfort was of no concern when the mind was suitably occupied. And while right now there was no case in sight, that could change at any moment.
After stubbing out their cigarettes, they lay quietly in each other’s arms, but did not settle in to sleep right away. I had some time, while they laid there, relaxed and sated, to think about what I had witnessed. How playful they had been with each other! How naturally they had performed what I had understood to be the most unnatural of acts. My entire view of Watson had changed – never again would I see him as the bumbling biographer. He may never have come to master the science of deduction, but to give Holmes such pure affection that he became willing to let his guard down completely and give in to sensual desires, that was an art that surely no one else had ever dared to attempt, let alone to master.
Watson looked around once more, and finding no bystanders, he said, “Had we an absolute guarantee of privacy, I would kiss you breathless, just to start.”
The bedroom called us back, though, and once all of the aforementioned pressing bodily needs had been satisfied, we felt free to give in to mere desire. We ended up on the rumpled sheets, dressing gowns open and nightshirts rucked up, playing with each other’s pricks in the warm sunlight that filtered through the gauzy curtains, until we’d spent ourselves dry. Then we lolled on the bed awhile, before finally admitting to ourselves that we must go out that day for proper sustenance.
“Because you’ve got such a big prick.” Holmes seemed a little shy about saying those words, and yet also appeared to relish them as he uttered them.
Even as I sank into the comfort of accepting that Watson now held my heart in his hands, tears came afresh when I remembered that we had only one more day in Folkestone, and then it would be time to catch the train home.
It occurred to me then that I still held my cigarette, and was about to drop my ash onto my client’s furniture. I tapped the cigarette over the ashtray, then after considering it a moment, decided to indulge in a deep drag, then a swig of brandy as well. Gorging my senses still further whilst Watson pampered my prick felt fantastically sordid, in a way that nothing ever had before.
“I can, and I will.”
“How?” Despite my apprehension, I felt I could not be more ready to receive his love in the most intimate manner than I was at this moment, and I thought if I could get him to explain, I might lure him into demonstrating.
I ignored my desires and treated his suggestion like an order of the highest urgency. He watched me as I attempted to arrange myself in an artfully sprawled manner – his affectionate expression told me that perhaps I was being a bit awkward. But he kneeled over me, covering my body with his own, and I momentarily forgot about my self-consciousness, gasping in anticipation of being shown every pleasure whilst under his capable hands. I should have guessed that Watson would throw himself into this just as he threw himself into everything we did together, and I was grateful for it; I would never have been confident enough in what we were doing to pursue it with such ferocity as he was now.
They were
He sold his sister out one too many times already.
The military had called him a klutz when they'd first taken a peek at his medical history.
Even if everyone seemed like goldfish to Mycroft, a man like Lestrade could make the racing of his mind slow down. It's what John did to him; it caused his mind to slow, to savor every moment he had with John, basking in the presence of his soulmate, but at the same time his mind would accelerate to take in everything about John in a second. It was like a game of tug-of-war, his mind unsure of what to focus on.
“Not a whit,” I assured him, and watched, utterly rapt, as he undressed at the foot of the bed. By the time he was stripping out of his underclothes, I’d crawled halfway down the mattress reaching for him. He laughed. “No need to work as hard as that; I’m coming to you.” He laid himself down, and I was upon him in an instant. Now that the fog of my arousal had cleared, I could indulge in my most natural and instinctive obsession: curiosity. Determined to examine him closely and learn everything there was to know about his body, I crawled all over him, memorising every important detail. I catalogued every mole and scar. I squeezed his muscles. I caressed the finest hairs on his skin with just my fingertips, then played more boldly with the thick fur on his chest. I did extensive research into whether he preferred to have his nipples lightly pinched or firmly sucked. He found it funny how I sniffed all over him like a bloodhound, but his odour was intoxicating, and I longed to bury my nose in the places where it was strongest.
.” Having Watson do it was so much better, because each stroke was slightly unexpected but still precise and perfect.
It was only when I moaned softly, my first unambiguous noise of contentment, that he moved his finger inside me, in a particular way that delivered a bizarre, indescribable, but undeniable sensation of sharp pleasure deep inside. Each successive brush against it sent thrills through every fibre of my being, and I began to pant and groan in a most undignified manner. Luscious bolts of pleasure were shooting straight down my limbs, and that was in addition to the unearthly pulsing in the centre of me, as though my prick were being stroked from the inside.
I approached the kitchen entrance to the cottage, and through the door, I could hear two male voices. I paused, then decided I would not let myself in, not there. Instead, I would play a little game, seeing if I could enter through the French doors into the main room, sneak upstairs, and then give them both a surprise by announcing my presence as I bounded down the stairs. I wondered if I could even convince Holmes that I’d come in through the upstairs window – a feat I don’t think I could have actually managed, as there was nothing under the upstairs windows to climb up on; a ladder at least would be in order, though a grappling hook would be more exciting.
Between the half-folded panels of the screen, I could see everything, and thus I felt that I myself must be quite exposed. But the two men were well distracted by each other, and as they continued to undress, I gradually grew more confident in my concealment, for they certainly would never have done such things as they were doing if they’d had the slightest inkling that they were being watched.
By the time they stumbled into the bedroom, both men were partially undressed, jackets and waistcoats nowhere to be seen, braces loose at their sides, ties discarded and collars askew. No wonder they had taken so long to ascend the stairs; still they were fumbling at each other, unbuttoning each other’s shirts in a most inefficient way.
Watson, bless him, took pity on me, and patted my knee. I grabbed his proffered hand in my own and said, “But no one can hear us, surely. So just
“Been on my feet all day,” he said. “Very busy today.”
He had one hand on the blanket, resting his weight upon it whilst he put down the chocolates and took up his wine glass with the other. I leaned to one side, folded my legs, and placed my hand next to his, mirroring his posture. He did not react. I moved my hand to close the last inch of space between his and mine, brushing his fingers with my own. We looked at each other, and his expression was one of surprise, but not aversion. Once he understood that I was still being quite deliberate, his face softened, and without breaking his gaze, he returned the minute caress of fingertips. Overcome by all the peculiar excitements he had provoked in me all these months, my eyes fluttered closed, and I gasped. Leaning forward, I blindly begged, “Watson, you must know what I desire. Please give it to me without further delay.”
This prompted a low chuckle from Holmes, who guided and directed Watson to sit against the headboard. Holmes could then lay on his back with his head in Watson’s lap. Having settled in, he – to my utter shock – guided Watson’s half-erect instrument right into his mouth! And not only that: he sucked slowly at it for some time, savoring it with his lips and tongue, and made noises like it was delicious, as though sucking and licking it was just the most wonderful thing. It grew more substantial as he worked, until he could fit only perhaps half of it comfortably in his mouth. Watson lamented then, “I remember when all it took was a stiff breeze to give me the most rampant cockstand.”
The morning began almost unremarkably, save for the fact that Watson and I awoke naked and in each other’s arms; each of us braved the sunlight streaming in the windows with our usual grumbling lethargy, compelled to rise by our demandingly full bladders. We splashed water on our faces, donned nightshirts and dressing gowns for decency’s sake, then shuffled out to the kitchen, to nibble at the picnic leftovers – our intention had been to collect more comestibles to fill the larder on our way home from the picnic, but now we were paying for our having gotten distracted, with only a few slices of cold meat and cheese to sustain us.
“You want this inside you very badly, don’t you?”
Despite this growing understanding that having a libido need not be disastrous, that vice was not only routine, but more often than not downright banal, I continued to avoid sexual matters, due to an utter lack of interest in either the incentives or the inevitable results. Twice or thrice I found myself entertaining soft emotions for another at university, but such fleeting thoughts were as nothing before my iron determination. I crumpled those urges up like a blotted sheet of foolscap, treating them like the mistakes, the
Watson’s decision that the time was right came not a moment too soon, for we had just two more days in our liminal seaside cottage, before we would be returning to London. But having judged this the appropriate night, he strove to make everything perfect: a fire had been laid to warm the bedroom so that we might go about undressed and above the covers, and he saw that we were both fed but not languid with being overfull, and not too tired from the day’s exploring. Watson declared that we would bathe together again, and then at last,
. I would have thought that over time my skills would become less spectacular as he grew accustomed to their display, whilst my growing affection for his virtues, as they were revealed to me, ought to have made him self-satisfied. Instead, the light of his high regard for me never dimmed, and sometimes I blushed to think of it. I longed to tell him how I cared for him so deeply, how his bravery and good companionship so enriched my life, but every time I looked at his guileless face, his unguarded eyes upon me, I quailed and was silent.
I proceeded with care, and even if there had been nothing inside the trunk, the click of each of the locks surrendering provoked a reflexive satisfaction in me. But when I lifted the lid, I beheld an exciting sight indeed: a dozen or more wooden boxes, of varying sizes and ages, all waiting for me to open them and reveal their contents. I felt like a child on Christmas morning.
Watson broke away from our embrace just long enough to roll to the side of the bed and take something from the nightstand. He showed it to me: a tin of Vaseline he’d found in the bathroom. “This will ease the way,” he said. He nuzzled my neck, and promised, “I will go slowly, and treat you with the utmost care.”
Now however, bewitched by my dear friend and made giddy by the mere thought of his touch, I was reaching for my impudent member nearly every day. I did not always bring myself to completion – reasoning that my weakness to the very thought of Watson “didn’t count” if I did not have a release – but when there was no case to distract me, I found myself increasingly needing to attend to clandestine bodily compulsions.
It was difficult to think, which was always distressing to me, and compounded my nerves. But I took deep breaths, and concentrated on releasing the tension from every muscle in my body, and when Watson felt me relax there, he dipped his finger in to the first knuckle. I uttered only a little gasp, but then he slid it all the way up inside, and I cried out with how strange it felt. My naive body squeezed fitfully around this intruder, but Watson held his hand still, which allowed me to get accustomed to his presence. He continued to suck me, and the odd new sensation mingled with the familiar one.
it, reared and trained to make our way in this world independently and rarefied by our experience of it.
I did not believe it at first, until I turned my head and confirmed beyond doubt where his face was. A moment later, the shock dissipated, and I was overwhelmed by the delicious sensation of it. I was affected to a ridiculous degree by such a minute touch, moaning at the slippery warmth of it and squirming to get more, if it was at all possible.
But I think that I wanted to feel small just then; these past days I had come to believe that the whole world had changed, but soon it would be time to return to normal life, and I needed to reorient myself, and to once more think of the world as big and myself as small.
They smoked in silence, taking turns cradling and stroking each other.
Blast it! He misread what I was attempting entirely, although in fairness to him, his assumption about my intention
“Naturally,” I agreed. Then I turned to face him. “But now that it is dark, and we must certainly be alone, with only your constellations for company, perhaps we could engage in one rash act of wanton exhibitionism?” I tilted my head to indicate what I wanted.
“Will you turn over for me?” he asked, his voice faint through the haze of my euphoria. I allowed him to help me flop onto my belly, afterwards straining to turn my head to see what he would do. He wasted no time; grabbing one cheek of my arse and holding me open, he stroked himself over me, grunting like a beast. I watched his spend erupt from his prick, then felt the heat of it land on my still-quivering hole. It was the most depraved thing imaginable, and I loved it.
“I do want it. I want to make you feel good.” I slid down, and rested my head on his chest, shy about what I was about to say but needing to say it. “I want you to take me, to
. I supposed I could accept this idea of directing one’s otherwise dangerous energies correctly. After all, there was a difference between learning to box and recklessly picking fights with strangers. So I proceeded, wading into a mire of baffling guidelines.
It seemed, in fact, that Watson put Holmes in every voluptuous posture, and they never returned to one they had already tried when they rearranged themselves. But always Watson’s hands were strong but reverent, his voice soothing but provocative. “Is that good?” he would ask. “Do I feel good?” And always Holmes would answer in the affirmative, and give himself up utterly. No matter what their orientation, every time Watson buried himself to the hilt, Holmes uttered the most intense noise of gratification. He just seemed to adore having it go all the way up him. And whenever they were situated in such a way that they could get their faces near to one another, they kissed, sloppily, tongues extended and lips smacking.
I had never seen a naked man with my own eyes before, and these two did not resemble the idealized sculptures or illustrations I’d seen. Each man had made his own way into middle age: Holmes, in his youth perhaps called “lithe,” was now resolutely gaunt, and his face and hands weathered. Watson was a man of naturally broad shoulders and chest, but his belly had caught up in recent years – he’d clearly not picked up on Holmes’ tendency to miss meals. They had earned their mature bodies, but despite their imperfections, both had a certain charm; certainly at this moment they seemed not only to accept each other but to delight. As they plopped down on to the bed together, they groped at one another’s bodies with what I can only describe as a
A thousand more specifications accompanied the one concerning neck length, detailing which partners were suitable or unsuitable based on one’s disposition, form, height, corpulence, excitability, habits, and morals. Some of this advice was less than clear:
Watson found a suitable basket in the kitchen, plus utensils, serviettes, and two wine glasses. We set out in the early afternoon, first to the high street, where we collected our provisions. We filled our picnic basket with bread, cheese, cold sliced meats, cherries, and a daintily-ribboned box of four chocolates, plus a bottle of wine. As routine as this errand was, it was pleasant to do something so bland and domestic, because I was doing so with Watson.
readers. This was the shelf where sat books on hygiene, health, and social conduct.
me. I want you to have the honour of being the only person who has had me in such a way.”
The boy was inconsolable, and sobbed through his tale of woe: his closest companion, his beloved dog, had gone missing. It was no jewel theft or murder, but I couldn’t help but spring forth to offer my services. I gathered all the information I could from him, confirmed that the house we stood in front of was the house he lived in, and promised to do my best to assist.
Holmes sat up just then, as if he’d remembered something important, but then he only tilted himself forward and got on his knees and elbows. He waggled his narrow behind at Watson, saying, “Please give it to me now, you’ve no idea how badly I need it.”
Dozens of pages were devoted to the exact physical dimensions of a suitable wife, some specifications of which also depended on the man in question. For example:
After quite some time I finished, and relaxed upon the bed, catching my breath but with my gaze still affixed to that handsome ruddy column poking out of his trousers. He took out his handkerchief and tidied up what I’d spilled. “As always, you were marvelous to observe,” he said, and gave me a peck on the forehead. “Now, I hope your post-orgasmic lassitude has not caused you to lose interest entirely...?”
John had just lost his best friend, and he'd lost his soulmate. John had a right to mourn.
After living with him for several more months, he thought he would have at least glimpsed the man's mark, or perhaps John would have finally shown him. Sherlock definitely didn't hide his own, but John never once mentioned it and always kept his hidden- guarded.
"Please, sir, let us see him." The paramedics were here now, trying to take John's soulmate away.
Sherlock did not utter a word to Mycroft of John being his John. It was horrible enough for a person to be unwanted by their soulmate, but Sherlock did not need Mycroft rubbing it in. Mycroft Holmes was many things, but sensitive he was not. No, it simply wouldn't do to have Mycroft know of his little brother's failings in the matter of soulmates.
"You left again." Sherlock's voice dragged John out of his trance, reminding him that he was still among the living.
"Mrs. Hudson made breakfast." Sherlock blinked.
Sherlock's blood was cleaned up, Lestrade declaring it a suicide. They'd found Moriarty's body of the roof, bullet hole through his head and gun residue on his hand. No one could argue that Moriarty killed himself, and then Sherlock killed himself. No one knew what words were uttered between the two geniuses, only that whatever was said led to both their deaths.
"I'm sorry, there's just a lot on my mind," Watson explained lamely, desperately trying to avoid the topic on his mind. Sherlock didn't need any of his baggage, though John was sure Sherlock could deduce everything about his childhood, his family. If he could deduce almost everything about Harry from a simple glance at John's re-gifted phone, why couldn't Sherlock deduce his whole life after years of knowing him? It doesn't take a psychologist or a doctor to explain why John may refuse to acknowledge his soulmate's existence or possible explanations for why there are scars on his wrists.
He hadn't truly felt anything after his sister ran away. That had been the day he realized how destructive impulsiveness could be. John moved with a certain numbness weighing his limbs down. He forgotten what the weightlessness of spontaneity felt like in his bones. Sherlock made him feel weightless, limitless. John finally felt uninhibited.
John pulled away, gasping for air. Sherlock allowed him the oxygen, breathing heavily himself.
Sherlock wanted to see it.
He told no one of Mary's plan. No one needed to know.
John just needed to learn how to live with that.
"You can't keep living like this? What, are you going to leave? Abandon me because everything is
John breathed in relief. He didn't kill his father.
Irene Adler held Sherlock's name upon her wrist, but he did not have hers.
"Sherlock," John murmured, unable to find words to bridge the gap he'd just realized was between them.
"I'm sorry."
John stared at the lump that was his father, searching.
Timothy Holmes came home from work only moments later, hearing crashes from upstairs and the news blaring in the lounge of their large home. "Oh dear," He mumbled to himself, putting his coat on the coat rack as he entered.
Sherlock wanted her to elaborate. He wanted to know why she thought she didn't count, why she was there for him and not perhaps John, why Molly couldn't have the effect on him that John had, why he couldn't love her as she loved him. But he couldn't ask any of those questions. He had no right to the answers. "What could I need from you?"
He soon met a nurse at the clinic he was employed at, and she made him forget about the grief he carried with him. She listened, and she held him as he cried after informing her of the fate of his soulmate. She'd accepted his baggage with open arms and a caring heart.
Sherlock paused his examination of some sample, straightening himself after schooling his shocked expression. No one had ever asked him that sort of thing. John was across the lab, not paying attention. Molly was murmuring, her words quiet. As if she didn't want John to know. As if she knew Sherlock wouldn't want John to know.
Sherlock almost wept. He flung himself forward, caring not for grace or restraint or fear or pain. All that mattered was John and Sherlock. Everything else was irrelevant. John caught him as best the stocky man could, the two stumbling back and into their wall. Sherlock didn't care.
John didn't really remember much after that. Someone told him he was in shock, but he couldn't say for sure who. Molly was there, holding him. Tears were slipping down her face, but it was like she was muted. No words escaped her lips, just soft, crooning sounds to the military doctor who'd lost his heart unknowingly to the dead genius.
If the military didn't know, Dr. Watson must have ensured that they did not list it and did not search out his soulmate.
Mary had never seen his thinly veiled rage, and he prayed that Rosie never would.
"Kiss me," John demanded, his eyes glinting with a dangerous lust. Sherlock wasted no time. Sherlock had given John everything he had, but now Sherlock took. He took everything John would give him. Sherlock's lips devoured John's, his tongue diving into his mouth like a swimmer who'd been too long deprived of water.
Not so long ago, I would have found all of these activities – visiting a seaside resort, relaxing in the fresh air, eating – so tedious individually, and practically unbearable when combined, but today I could think of no better way to pass the time, enjoying Watson’s companionship with no interruptions. It was particularly enjoyable to watch him as he ate, his fingers touching his mouth, his tongue darting out to collect crumbs or stray drops of cherry juice.
I replied, “Should I?”
I had no choice but to trust Watson’s methods. He had only ever wanted what he knew was best for me, and I saw no reason why this trait of his should have vanished just now. I closed my eyes and took myself in hand.
And so on. None of this should come as a surprise to anyone who has read the tales of my exploits dramatised (and too often romanticised) by Doctor John Watson. But there was one shelf of books which was to have a different but equally powerful lifelong influence on me, an influence that is only hinted at in those stories devoured by
He himself, on the other hand, was so adept at modesty that it took me years to appreciate all that he had to offer. His most valuable and practical qualities came to the fore within the first few of our adventures together, but after that, each new discovery filled my heart with the satisfaction of knowing I had indeed chosen a more than worthy companion.
My trust in Watson may have been what made me the most gratified of all – never in my life had I felt so safe and comfortable around another person; no other person had earned what Watson had earned from me.
I sputtered, “Watch me–
, as carrying on the tradition of Galahad, of Joan of Arc, warriors whose blades struck true because they belonged to no one but the Creator. Of course, every man wishes to believe that his thoughts and deeds are virtuous, and may very well tie himself in knots to fortify such an illusion. But with every case solved, with every plot foiled, with every treasure recovered, I felt justified in laying another brick into the wall around my heart.
as bait. Everything went just as I had anticipated, until the fiend got the point of his knife just inside my right nostril. He must have had no idea that Watson was right behind him, and whilst I was blathering at the burglar, attempting to disarm him with a persuasive word, Watson snuck up and did it the more conventional way; the blade clattered to the floor with no harm done to myself, and Watson held the burglar securely until such time as the police, awaiting my signal nearby, could place a sturdy set of handcuffs on him.
It was an uneventful case, satisfying when all loose ends were tied up but without the danger and suspense of my previous encounter with the burglar. The curious thing was, though, that I had spent this day of cab rides and coffee and waiting and watching absolutely bursting with enthusiasm – because the whole day had been spent with Watson, whose presence and being was absolutely riveting in a new and heart-pounding way. Everything he did I found enchanting, from the alluring manner in which he held his cigarette to the charming way he feigned nonchalance when Miss Hayes walked by us in the street. Every movement was so confident, so deliberate. I had always thought of Watson as being as constant as the North Star, but I had grown to think of him as being just as splendid and radiant to look upon. I committed every gesture, every smile, every sly look to memory, and that night, alone in my room, I confess I made use of it all.
Watson and I spent the day flitting about Camden, hailing cabs and taking side streets in order to secure our vantage points. Sure enough, wherever we found ourselves when my client made her way through on her errands, a lurking woman in her aunt’s green shawl was never far away. It so happened that this woman chose to make herself known just when Miss Hayes was approaching the counter at a bakery; Watson and I watched from behind our coffee and scones at a table in the corner.
Some might say those qualities are not compatible, but I concluded it immediately when he entered the chemical laboratory at Bart’s. I never told him what I had observed: that he had cleared the room the moment he stepped inside. I watched Watson as he moved swiftly through the doorway, not lingering in it; his eyes flicked to each corner of the room, beginning with the nearest, and then up to sweep the ceiling; as he stepped fully inside, he took note of the narrow windows in the basement room, and positioned himself near enough to me to be properly introduced, but where he could not fall victim to a sniper’s bullet.
“That is entirely on you,” I said.
It came to a point where I accepted that this activity was taking up valuable time and energy, and that I must find a way to manage these cravings for Watson so that I might get on with my life unhindered by yearning. If only putting an end to infatuation was as simple as understanding that it was unproductive! But just as I had trained hunger and thirst out of my body, I was resolved to do away with lust.
Perhaps, uprooted from our Baker Street routine, and away from London’s millions of eyes, I might find a less guarded Watson, a Watson whom I might convince to take liberties with me.
Rather than answering with words, I placed a hand on the back of his neck and drew him down to me for a kiss. I knew that deep, wet kissing provoked him as much as it did me, and when I slid my tongue over his, I could feel, deep inside me, his prick jerking. I also knew that when he explored my mouth with the same fervour, he could feel my own minute contractions around him.
I laughed too, at this. “I suppose yes, but I...just wanted to be certain.” I lifted my hips again. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt what was going on, I’ve been waiting so long for it.”
Watson forgave me with a kiss on the cheek, then bent his knees and elbows to take a better stance, so he might deliver a series of solid, rhythmic thrusts. I confess I left him to it, raising my legs in the air and stretching my arms above my head, wishing only to accept pleasure, and trusting that he was taking a suitable portion of the same for himself whilst he worked.
I clapped my hand over my eyes. “A thousand apologies, Watson, I never intended–”
I set down my glass with a thud and unceremoniously dropped my cigarette into the ashtray, so that with my shaking hands I might claw at the arms of the chair once more. “Oh, my dear,” I gasped, “I’m afraid I’m quite near to my crisis.” I expected Watson to snatch up his handkerchief and finish me off with his hand. Instead, when I spent, he only sucked more firmly, perfectly happy it seemed to drink me down, even going so far as to continue to nurse at my prick after it must have been clear to him that I was fully spent. I was tremendously sensitive and beginning to soften, and I cried out with the overstimulation, “Please, I’ve got nothing left, have mercy!” Only then did he relent.
I did not dare say a word of this, of course, but perhaps hinted at it when I looked into his eyes, for I could swear I detected a hint of conspiratorial mischief in them. But no, I had to be mistaken.
you teach me that?”
“I’d like you to kneel here, facing away from me. Put your arms on the rim of the tub, and you can rest your head on them.” He guided me as I went, encouraging me to lower my head, to present myself to him more brazenly. It would seem he had changed his mind about taking me up on my offer right here and now.
Watson huffed, “So, I stayed up late in anticipation of an exciting reveal for nothing.”
I did not offer to do any more cooking on our holiday, but I decided then that I would not allow crepes to get the better of me. I would perfect my skills sight unseen, using Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen on the sly, until I could whip up something exceptionally good.
Funnily enough, I had not known what masturbation was, or how it was conducted, until it was laid out for me in these books. But in the same breath as it was explained, it was warned against: if I were to make a habit of “self-pollution” I would become lazy, my muscles would weaken, I would be tormented by tremors and terrors, my organs would cease to function properly, my powers of perception and reflection would deteriorate, and I would pass quickly into miserable dotage and idiocy. And this was to say nothing of the fires of perdition that awaited me for having indulged in such a damnable sin.
“Both.” Their teasing banter was punctuated by kisses. “Have you been enjoying the favors of any of the lovely young things in London?” Holmes asked this teasingly, and stroked Watson’s chest hair as he did so.
We awoke the following morning to a startlingly blue sky and, opening the windows, wonderfully warm breezes. I tend to be indifferent to weather, but Watson was delighted, and suggested we have a picnic that day. I requested several hours in which to smoke a pipe, wake up properly, have some tea, read the paper, smoke another pipe, dress, and brace myself for a day spent in the clean, fresh out-of-doors, but other than that I was more or less amenable.
Thus determined, I carried on through adolescence and into adulthood – and found it hardly a challenge, being rarely drawn towards any sort of temptation. What baffled me were the peccadilloes of others, whether they be schoolmates, the subjects of town gossip, or heroes of history and literature. Once I came to understand that beneath the strictures of Victorian England bubbled lecherous deeds and devilish urges, it seemed that everyone around me was to some degree susceptible to vice, except myself.
The sound of bathwater sloshing drew his eyes downwards, and he scrutinised the movement beneath the surface of the water. “Good lord, are you
How to get the wayward canine to come to us when it had not answered its master’s call was at first beyond us, but a hunch came to me in the form of a horse-drawn ice wagon. Returning to the boy’s house, we asked him about all the delivery carts that came down the street, and when they tended to arrive. He listed them, and we were off again to make inquiries.
Between that discovery and my reaching for the hygiene books on the shelf, I had collected a few other details, owing mainly to a knowledgeable boy who lived on a farm a few miles down the road. He would thrill and repulse and fascinate the other children with tales of things he’d seen, but descriptions of the genitals of various livestock was his most popular material.
“I don’t know that this is the ideal venue for it,” he mumbled against my damp skin.
I was so distracted by his perfect sucking, I almost didn’t notice him reaching for the tin of Vaseline. I did hear him open it, however, and saw him dip his finger into it. I tensed once again in anticipation, and the next thing I knew, that finger was touching my arsehole. I was fine with this, but apparently my body felt differently, clenching against his light caress.
Risky behaviors to avoid included sleeping upon feathers, spending too much time in overheated rooms, waltzing, gossip, gambling, reading novels, the theatre, lying on ones back (or on or one’s front), heavy bed-clothing...the list was extensive, and some of these things seemed difficult to avoid. Or if not difficult, undesirable. The theatre? Was a desire to see a performance of
I can tell you that it was not obvious to me at all. A low womb? A very masculine man? How to identify these accurately?
He laughed at me.
Unable to resist the temptation, I immediately made the silliest face I could come up with, which made him laugh, though he admonished me, “If you’re going to be a menace, you’ll get nothing at all.”
That was about the time I heard Watson’s tread on the stair. I was not expecting him to rise so early. I listened as he set foot upon the landing and came through the sitting room. He knocked on the half-open bathroom door, but stayed on that side of it.
He laid on his back next to me and guided me up and over, so I was straddling him. He held my hip in one hand and his cockstand in the other, and slid it up and down my cleft several times before settling it in just the right spot and pushing the tip inside. He encouraged me to continue, to sit myself upon it, and doing it slowly felt wonderful. With his encouragement, I wiggled and rocked until I found just the right place for all of him, and then began to bounce a little. He ran his hands all over my chest and belly and thighs, saying how beautiful I was; this I was still a bit doubtful about, but it did not spoil my fun.
“Well, I suppose,” he replied slowly, “but...”
I looked away as my face heated up. What Watson had just been doing to me was not nearly so embarrassing as how effortlessly he had dismantled my mistaken assumptions. “Thank you,” I whispered, “I appreciate your teaching me.”
Watson looked at me as though I had sorely disappointed him. “Now Holmes, I can almost understand why you dislike taking holidays – you need the mental stimulation of work, of course. But it’s nearly August, and already the heat here in London is stifling. One can hardly go out in the street without getting filthy with perspiration, and the smell of horse droppings gets to be unbearable. Surely a visit to the seaside will at least be more comfortable, especially now when you’ve not had a case in some days. When was the last time a Yarder was by?”
Baker Street became a haven for both of us; certainly for myself, and I think for him as well, it felt like our first true home. Bounced about as we both had been by the circumstances of our very different lives, we were happy to fall in together, neither demanding anything from the other that did not come naturally. Sitting around our little hearth, we could relax and be our idiosyncratic selves, caring not for the opinions of society as regarded our temperaments and our ambitions.
As the months went by, my overactive imagination continued to get the better of me in this way. Watson would say something, and I would nearly,
Watson took off his own coat, and I moved to unfasten his shirt cuffs, but he stayed my hands. Instead, he bid me be still and allow him to loosen my tie and slip it from around my throat. He unfastened my collar, then my cuffs, setting everything aside with care. He unbuttoned my waistcoat and did away with it, then unfastened my braces. He unbuttoned my shirt with maddening fastidiousness, pushing it from my shoulders and draping it neatly over the back of a chair. I sat on the bed when he nudged me to do so, and despite my protests that it was entirely unnecessary, he knelt down to remove my shoes and socks. Then went my undershirt, over my raised arms, and finally he had me stand again so that he could unbutton and tug away my trousers and drawers.
I was enjoying a pleasant mouthful now, his succulent prick filling me, pulsing inside me, tiny bursts of his seed making their way across my tongue. I sucked more happily the more expressive he became, his whimpers turning to groans and his groans turning to words of encouragement, until at last, he heaved a great sigh and spent freely. I had not timed my swallowing correctly, so my mouth flooded and overflowed. I pulled away and gasped for air, just in time to see the final pulse of his spunk trickling from his slit. I immediately returned to my duties, lapping up what I had allowed to spill. Then I retreated and sat back on my heels, looking to Watson to see if I had done a suitable job.
Our train was delayed, so we did not arrive at Folkestone Central station until dinnertime. Waugh’s cottage was a short stroll from the station, and we only took enough time to set down our luggage before heading out in search of a chophouse; on the way, we joked about how, lacking a housekeeper, we would be hard-pressed just to keep ourselves upright, warm, and fed during our holiday.
When he passed over that exquisite spot inside me, my whole body seized with pleasure, and as I arched my back and lifted my hips, I fully seated him inside me. He was still, but my hips were restless, and their churning kept him moving gently inside me.
“I wandered down to the strand to do some thinking, myself, and I noticed a set of footprints going off into the hinterlands, and I followed them.”
Upon reaching the cottage, I was forced to curse that sensibility I so valued in Watson, for once he’d got the door locked behind us, rather than throw me to the floor and ravish me then and there, he asked me to lay the fire in the bedroom whilst he put the remainder of our picnic in the larder. He was wise, though, to assign me this chore, for as soon as he came into the bedroom, approached me, and slipped my coat from my shoulders, I knew I would want the room to be warm, for I would soon be wearing nothing.
–” Here I interrupted Watson with a laugh. “...
The slabs of griddle cake were thick and shapeless, but they tasted just fine, and afterwards, to cheer me, Watson reminded me that I still had the newspaper to read. The local journal’s agony column was not nearly as expansive or interesting at the one in the
Never had I been one for being idle by the seashore. Bustling, crowded, grimy London was my home. There, I may have been one among millions, but I understood London, could manipulate its fine moving parts and feel in control as I went about in it. The ocean, though, chastened me, made me remember that I was insignificant, and could never begin to comprehend this world, much less change it.
“Hmm.” I tried again, waiting until he looked at me, then dragging my gaze up his outstretched legs, across his body and over his limbs, and up to meet his eyes.
Holmes let Watson’s member slide out of his mouth, a little trail of saliva still stretched across to it from his lip. “I would not trade your patient experience for the hair-trigger fervor of yesteryear,” he assured Watson, and then resumed his sucking. He began to stimulate himself as well, not intensely, just pushing his foreskin back and forth with thumb and two fingers as he gradually got himself into a comparable state of excitement.
I smoked and ruminated in silence long enough for the sky to grow dim and the distant sound of the crowd to diminish, until only the cries of gulls pierced the dull roar of the ocean. I was so lost in thought, I did not notice Watson approach until he was nearly sitting by my side on the driftwood log.
Keeping busy was my best respite from prurient thoughts, so I buried myself in work. I took on cases I found less than interesting, just to have something to occupy me. And when nothing was on, my meticulousness in the maintenance of my commonplace books increased dramatically. With this strict regimen, I laboured to keep my impertinent body under control, until such time as my affection for Watson settled into an unremarkable habit, a feeling I could acknowledge and then simply ignore, as I did with fatigue or cold.
“What was it you were just saying about patience,” Watson scolded him with a grin as he heaved himself up onto his knees. He tucked himself in behind Holmes and said, “You’re not nearly ready.” Taking up the tin, he opened it and greased his fingers with the contents. Then, just when I thought I could not be any more astonished, he inserted those fingers into Holmes, who opened his mouth with a silent cry.
That afternoon, a client paid a visit, a woman named Elizabeth Hayes who was convinced she was being followed through the streets of Camden by the ghost of her aunt, who had died eight years ago. I interviewed her for nearly an hour, collecting all the relevant data I could about the possible means and motivations for such a strange state of affairs.
“But this would all be just for me? It wouldn’t be for you?”
I believe that the flour in Waugh’s kitchen must have been the wrong kind, for I struggled mightily with the task in the morning. Watson remained abed when I got up to cook, but he must have gotten suspicious of how long I was taking, for he wandered into the kitchen to check on my progress. I gazed forlornly down at what were, so far, my best efforts, and said, “It would seem we are having griddle cakes instead of crepes this morning. I trust you will not be too disappointed.” He laughed and gave me a patronising kiss on the cheek.
. This gave me grave concern about the Scandinavian peoples, for whom (I knew from my readings on all the countries of the world) having blue eyes was as prevalent as having a nose or ears.
. Each of them had between his legs a half-standing member, not limp and discreetly small like those of Hellenic statuary but firm and growing still more prominent as the two of them rolled about and rubbed their bodies together.
Once I had decided that I would seek an answer, the next step was to determine how to seek it in the most definitive yet deniable way. The obvious answer seemed to me to be the way that all great romances begin – with a look.
I was so uncontrollably libidinous with anticipation, I could not help but rub myself all over Watson in the bath, whilst I babbled about how badly I wanted him to have me, how honored I was to fall into his capable hands, how certain I was that his prick would feel like heaven in me.
Watson knelt at the side of my bed; he was so close to me now that I could feel his breath on my belly, and I shivered, feeling intensely my own naked vulnerability. He reached out and brushed my hands away from where they were situated between my thighs, and instead held the base of the dildo himself, lightly manipulating it. The moment he touched it, I felt a whole different kind of pleasure. I was no longer in complete control, and the surprises in each tiny movement sent fresh bolts of pleasure all through me. He smiled slyly at my jerking and grunting, and asked, “Is this what you like? Hm?”
“I love it,” I said with a gulp. My own prick flexed with anticipation.
To think of my years of reticence pains me now; he deserved better than my diffidence in this matter. I hope that he could discern my devotion all along, even if I never expressed it in words. After all, there was never anything secret about me. Oh, I could keep a hunch or a suspicion to myself, until such time as I could substantiate it, but in personal matters I was no Sphinx. My every moment of delight and disdain was painstakingly recorded in his chronicles.

Social vice – that is, sexual congress – was extensively warned against as well, but it seemed that the solitary variety was much more pernicious, and of particular concern to someone so young as myself, who of course had much easier and more frequent access to the latter than then former. I read this sentence with horror:
The first thing that struck me about these books was their indisputable authoritativeness. Just reading the preface of one, I got the distinct impression that I was about to embark upon a journey that would reward me with not just knowledge, but
“Oh! Well, I don’t see why not.”
For once, he heeded my request to stop teasing, no doubt because he was as taken by animal lust as I was. He entered me again, and I moaned to feel it slip so easily up me this time. He began with slow strokes, which went so deep that I howled with it, and he took this as encouragement to have me vigorously, pounding with such force that I could not move or speak or think. I lowered my head and chest to the bed, hoping to find relief in a change of position, not expecting that doing so would instead make his prick go deeper still. When the intensity became unbearable, I managed to shout enough and drag myself far enough forward to bring things to a brief halt. “
“I only meant in a different position,” he said, trying not to laugh.
At last, I heard two distinct sets of snores, and determined that the two men had fallen into a contented sleep, and so it was safe to move from behind the screen. It was only then, when I stood up, that I realized how wet and tingly I was between my legs. It was not an entirely new feeling, but so much more intense than I’d ever experienced before. I wished I’d had a place to go where I felt secure in addressing the situation, but I did not. I had to get out of the house as quickly as possible, and leave no indication that I had been there. I silently extricated myself from the narrow space behind the screen, tiptoed past the sleeping men, and crept down the stairs. Holmes had inadvertently taught me a valuable lesson that day, about the importance of being judicious when it came to playing practical jokes.
Watson?”
“Indeed, not even I would have ventured such a hypothesis.” I clutched his arms, desiring just one more minute of this closeness. “Watson, I can’t help but feel regret about the time lost. I have loved you for years, but for all my powers of observation, I had no idea you felt the same.”
He shifted forward, and when I felt his breath on my lips, I opened my mouth slightly to welcome him. Then he turned away. “Someone might see us,” he said.
Holmes tilted his head to one side, seeming a bit startled then, as if he’d woken from a dream. He put his hand over his reddened face and laughed. “Oh dear,” he said, “I became quite the saucy little trollop just then, didn’t I? Begging to be filled up and so on.”
“I may have left those details out in my haste. Why?”
“Desperately.”
When Watson pulled out of his body, Holmes whimpered so sharply that I winced myself. Watson moved Holmes’ legs from his shoulders carefully, arranging the two of them into a limp-limbed heap of flushed, glowing bodies on the bed. Then, with one arm, Watson could just reach the silver cigarette case on the bedside table, and he lit two cigarettes, handing Holmes one.
Instead, I felt something hot and wet and quivering. His tongue.
But whole sections of these books, after warning against lasciviousness of any kind, presented detailed information about how to ensure that one’s lasciviousness was successful and fruitful. One such chapter began by asserting:
Watson shared his knowledge with me, pointing out seemingly arbitrary patterns and telling me their names. While I did not consider the information worthy of storing in my brain-attic, I could appreciate the beauty of the stars, and Watson’s softly authoritative voice was an agreeable accompaniment.
The ground was soft with recent rains, but not sodden. I dismounted from my bicycle before I reached the door of the cottage, and examined the footprints on the ground, to see what I could determine about the goings-on around the cottage before entering. I saw Mrs. Hudson’s footprints coming down the path and abruptly disappearing where they intersected with tire tracks: it was not her usual day to do the shopping, so most likely she was off to visit someone. Her footprints outward overlaid Watson’s venturing towards the cottage. So Watson had come for a visit and chatted with Mrs. Hudson a while before she had left.
I felt very strange and sort of full, with only just half of it in me. I tried sitting up, to see if that would give me more leverage to push; it did not, so again I laid flat on my back, trying to relax. Then I tilted my pelvis to get a better angle to manipulate the dildo, and my heels lifted off the mattress as well. I pushed the thing in and out, slow and deliberate, feeling every sensation. The texture of it, especially the prominent ridge of the crown, was giving me unfamiliar and delightful stimulation, mostly right at my entrance. I pushed it back and forth for some time, amusing myself, and then when I thought myself brave again, I thrust it decidedly deeper.
“Things will be very different when we return to London,” I said, wishing for reassurance, pressing my face against his chest.
He claimed that I was as susceptible to flattery as a girl, and I will not dispute that, but I will say in my defence that I was so unaccustomed to flattery that I had not trained myself to eliminate unguarded reactions to it. Even Stamford, the man who recommended my company to Watson, had warned him that I was a hopeless misfit. My way of seeing the world was treated with, at most, grudging respect, but more often than not suspicion, as I refused to conform to a small but fundamental selection of societal expectations, and in English society, refusal to conform is an unforgivable sin. Watson’s naked praise told me that he and I were kindred spirits, both of us
I was rapt as Holmes mounted Watson’s supine form and took hold of his member, steadying it as he eased himself down onto it. But while that was a shocking sight to behold, what made my heart pound even faster was the unabashed adoration Watson was displaying; he seemed to worship Holmes’ body, his hands by turns gripping and caressing every part they could reach while he murmured hot-blooded but tender endearments.
Heat bloomed in my belly to hear him say this. “It’s important that you understand, I am in need of guidance on these matters. Would you teach me everything I need to know?”
The deeper I dove into these books, however, the more despondent I became.
Before he replied, there was a distinct clearing of the throat, a shift upon the floorboards from one foot to the other. “Well, I’ve just got up, you see.” When I did not respond, he made himself more clear: “I rather badly need to pass water.”
“You have succeeded in convincing me,” I announced, sitting up and gesturing for Watson to give me the letter. “I shall take this man up on his offer, only on the condition that his hospitality extends to you as well.”
...” I half-listened as Watson made his way through the meandering pleasantries. “...
Embarrassed at my outburst, I shut my eyes and winced as I continued to work at myself, and confessed, “I want to see your prick. I want to know what it looks like. I want to see how your bollocks hang.”
There was no harm in dwelling on thoughts of a more unconventional life with Watson for a few minutes, but I soon needed a distraction to keep me from descending into melancholy – I was particularly vulnerable at the end of a case. That was when my thoughts turned to the trunk.
“What do you think of?”
“You’ve got a...” he half-explained, pointing first at me and then at his own upper lip. He continued to giggle as he tugged his handkerchief from his pocket and attempted to wipe away the pale, thin imitation of a moustache which marred my visage. “Oh, dear,” he said as he did so, but bent down and kissed me all the same when I was tidy again.
“Didn’t I always tell you I was yours to use however you see fit?” He said, as he freed himself from my grip and rolled off of me with a grunt. He didn’t go far, in fact it was quite a tight squeeze, with both of us in my narrow bed, but being as were rather enamored of each other at the moment, we did not mind.
Not only was his prick still out and stiff, he was now unbuttoning his waistcoat.
I wished now to use this gaze that I had on occasion fallen under, so as to signal to Watson everything that such a gaze was meant to signal. I attempted it one quiet evening when Watson was just returning to Baker Street, having spent the day at his medical practice.
, though since at least the days of Shakespeare, we English have had a clumsier word: dildo. Whether that term comes from the Latin
was quite alarming to me. He kissed and mouthed at my cockstand like it was precious, worshipping it with his lips and tongue.
And away from books obsessed with perversion, instead observing actual, functional society, I saw how the vast majority of men and women were not shambling degenerates whose vices had brought them to ruin, but sufficiently well-adjusted persons, each with a part to play in this world, cogs taking their place in the machinery of society. To be sure, a seamy underbelly pulsated below the surface, just off the high streets and beyond the drawing rooms, but life went on anyhow. I concluded, then, that just as the pleasures incident to eating are not its primary objective but merely incentive thereto, so was sexual pleasure merely an incentive towards marriage and parentage, which the vast majority of men and women seemed happy to play their part in submitting to (some more promptly than others).
John had prayed to a God he'd never fully believed in since then, praying to never meet his own destruction. He'd watched his father strip away his mother's very identity, leaving her only with the knowledge that she belonged to him. John refused to let that happen to him. He was his own person, and no mark on his wrist would change that.
But they both just sat there and ate their breakfast in silence, not speaking of it.
The police woke Joseph Watson up with a splash of cold water, and he'd come up swinging. The police had to restrain him instantly, and he kept yelling, asking what the
