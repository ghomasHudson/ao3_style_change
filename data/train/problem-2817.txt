At that Sam straightened up from his slumped position. “Wait what? What are you talking about? When?”
“You really think Billie’s going to help us with this? She hates us.” Dean scoffed. “Besides I don’t think the Empty’s the negotiating type.”
At this Dean and Jack glanced up at Sam questioningly. Dean looked slightly offended, despite the fact he'd said practically the same thing moments ago. Cas stopped arranging the blocks for a moment to tilt his head at Sam slightly.
I really hope yall enjoyed this. The first chapter was more of a setup, while this one was really the heart of it. xx
Cas eyed Dean curiously. He had been uncharacteristically quiet the entire ride over, as well as at the restaurant. As they waited for their- Dean’s-  food to arrive, he sat there bouncing in his seat nervously, while actively avoiding eye contact.
Jack only furrowed his brows in confusion glancing from Dean to Cas. Dean rolled his eyes and entered the car. He smiled lightly at Cas before starting up the engine.
“Your turn.” Cas snapped him out of his thoughts. His smirk made it clear he knew the effect his prior words had.
There was no escaping it after all. When he’d picked up Cas from work, he’d noticed Nora smile and point out the window towards Dean again. This time he actually understood what was going on.
The two had been sent out to two more restaurants, a ski-rink, and a movie - with Jack and Sam not showing up to each outing at the last minute. Sam kept finding hunts for them to go on where it would be just the two of them  - couple retreats being his latest obsession.
“Did you play it out of a boom box the first time or-?” Sam muttered under his breath teasingly, his tone light, clearly not malicious.
He decided to let it go for now. He’d need longer to fully process what Cas had said anyway, to respond in a way worthy of what Cas deserved.
“I’m gonna go now.” He glanced around. “Uh- Just remember that this is a communal space.” He finished before starting to make his way out.
“I heard him and Jack talking about it in the kitchen just now. They don’t know I know. And- well I don’t know the details but- apparently if Cas is really happy or something I don’t know, then uh. Well then something bad is gonna happen to him.” Dean quickly responded, gulping. Not making eye contact.
“Sam I don’t think you can complain when you’re the one that supposedly brought us together.” Cas piped up, smiling lightly. The humour was evident in his tone.
“There’s more. He- Jack asked him what would make him happy enough for whatever it is to happen. And-.” He rubbed the back of his neck self consciously.
Cas turned back around. His face was tightened in contemplation, as if he were trying to decide or gauge something. His eyes flashed around the room.
While the blue eyes piercing into him definitely did affect his already concerning heart rate, they also steadied him somewhat. Due to  that, he eyed the gap between their lips.
“It’s just- crazy that you’re reassuring me by telling me how not happy you are. It’s kinda funny, but kinda messed up.” He frowned down at their hands.
“Chucks dead, I got ma baby, I got ma pie. What else could I need?” Dean grinned back at Sam, his smile tight, not quite reaching his eyes.
“Dean I don’t understand.” Cas held steadfast. His nerves were apparent. He was holding back, afraid to make the same fumble he had the night prior.
“I’m so proud of you Dean. And I- I support you.” He said, before continuing on quickly, “And Cas. I’m so glad you can be yourself openly now.” His eyes were wide and genuine as he nodded at Dean. He also seemed nervous, as if he was afraid of saying something wrong, his hands raised slightly as if to sooth Dean.
Dean finds it hard to believe good things can happen. Can he be blamed when there's so much on the line?
“Locked in a bath-” Sam began. Then his gaze landed on Jack who was pointedly not looking at him. Oh, great, he had a rogue agent. He sighed and looked back over at the two men at the table.
Dean nodded. “So that’s got me thinking. Cas doesn’t have a birthday, does he? That hardly seems fair. So I was thinking yah know- uh what if we-“ He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. If Sam hadn’t feared being throttled by his brother, he would’ve said Dean seemed shy when talking about Cas.
His voice seemed to be barely there as he spoke. “What do you mean?” The question was unnecessary, but it bought him time.
“Ask Cas!” Dean gestured over at the man next to him. Sam turned his head to Cas, who nodded gravely at him. Sam huffed.
Dean huffed out a small laugh. One of Cas’ little human quirks. Every day he was like a kid planning out his outfit for the first day of school. Not that Dean knew what that was like, it wasn’t really one of his concerns during his years of haphazard schooling. Still, it was yet another endearing trait on Cas.
“About why you made Cas the mixtape? Are you two upset?” Jack’s concern only seemed to heighten, his expression mirroring that of a kicked puppy.
“Yeah I’m pretty sure I never said anything about wanting to walk in on you two dry humping like teenagers... in a room full of historical and magical artefacts by the way.”
Sam furrowed his brow before his face jumped into realisation. “Oh-OH!... I... Well- I’m never sitting in the back of the Impala again.”
As he began to pull up to the dirt patch his heartbeat started to quicken at an alarming pace. He attempted to breathe steadily but that was proving to be a challenge. This is it, he thought to himself.
“So we still on for movie night when we get home?” He questioned, trying to keep any semblance of hope out of his voice.
“Not to mention-” Dean began, turning his hand over under Cas’ so that they could lace their fingers together. “I’m also very irritating.”
Cas looked back at him softly, but with frustration underlying his features. His brow furrowed. He continued.
Dean frowned for a split-second before his eyes widened, his lip parted slightly. “That’s-” He cleared his throat, trying to stop his voice from breaking. “That’s the day we-”
Dean glanced over at him again. He seemed to be holding something back. But Dean wasn’t sure what Cas’ manager could’ve said to him that he couldn’t tell him. He decided against pushing the matter, still feeling slightly uneasy at having been caught staring.
“This is the last thing I need to absorb for the ritual, whenever Billie says it’s time.” He held it up with a small smile.
He wondered whether Cas had been wanting to pull back from him all this time, and that their conversation about boundaries had finally allowed him to do so. The thought pulled at his chest, sending a painful feeling stabbing through it. He hoped that he was wrong.
He couldn’t say it yet. So he’d think it now and then when it was all too much. It comforted him. If nothing else was certain this was. He knew it. They may be puppets in Chucks story but this. This was real.
“He’s clumsy.” Eileen cut in from where she was leaning against the counter, shaking her head at the once pie, attempting to hold back a grin.
Sam interrupted hastily with a groan. “Cas, come on man I don’t wanna hear about that.” He shook his head before his face suddenly went blank in horror. “Oh god, you’re not here to ask me for advice on that are you because-“
“Can I come in?” Cas hastily asked, not seeming to pay any mind to the other man’s question. His focus was clearly still on the hallway.
His stomach suddenly churned. Something bad would happen to Cas if he was happy- if Dean-. Dean blew air though his nose, a silent but dark chuckle. Those thoughts had been dangerous after all.
“How are you- is that really?! I’m so happy to see you man!” He fumbled out the words over each other striding towards Cas with each, before slowly stopping.
“To create a power vacuum yes. But for that we would first need to detonate the bomb- Jack- in a contained environment.” She interrupted.
“Sorry to disappoint.” Cas replied sincerely as he awkwardly shifted in place. He glanced at Dean and Jack before looking back down at the board.
In which Jack and Sam seem to be arriving at the right answer using the wrong equation. Cas and Dean are clued in yet oblivious at the same time.
Dean was out on a beer run, Jack was in his room. Only Cas and Sam remained in the bunker library, doing research for a local ghoul case.
Cas swallowed. He hadn't meant to be that transparent. He was more so used to being around the brother who wouldn't push matters like this.
Dean stood there. Cas. Cas loved him. Cas had made some sort of deal with the Empty linked to his happiness. And Cas loved him. The thought surged a wave of joy throughout him, for reasons he continued to pretend not to understand. The joy did not last.
“Zeppelin huh. That’s uh. Interesting. You know our parents loved that stuff.” Sam stated too casually. He had a mischievous glint to his eyes as he passed the tape back to Castiel.
The only plus side had been their friendly waitress who’d given them recommendations of places she liked going to with her girlfriend. ‘A lot friendlier’ she had said. He found it strange she’d taken such a liking to them at first, but ultimately he’d come around.
“Did you finish your dinner” Cas straightened up slightly to inspect Jack’s side of the table and his plate.
After the fumble from the previous night he didn’t want to mess up again. He didn’t want to hurt Cas again. He’d seen it on his face. The sliver of hope, which had promptly shattered into a million tiny pieces. All because of him.
“I have an idea for Dean’s birthday.” His eyes grew as he spoke, happiness bubbling behind the blue.
“What’s happening, where are you going?” He questioned. Cas was always leaving. Why was he always leaving? Was this about their fight earlier? Had he pushed him away again?
“No!” Dean cut in suddenly, looking no less frazzled, but very sure of his response. He breathed out and looked around as if searching for some saving grace. Cas continued to stare at him, waiting for an explanation. He was glaring slightly. Honestly, he never enjoyed Dean’s attempts at pawning him off to various waitstaff.
Sam’s expression had not changed from soft and sympathetic. He knew. They’d all known. It was the perpetual unsaid non-secret. But hearing it said out loud, in this context, it broke his heart. He’d lost a friend, but Dean had lost so much more.
Dean began to open his driver’s side door and step out when he suddenly noticed Sam had begun to follow suit.
“You can’t steal mine.” Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean, though the humour behind them was apparent. That elicited a chuckle from Dean which had Cas clearly preening.
“You alright there?” Dean asked, his brown furrowing. He was concerned, and a little annoyed at the lack of engagement he was receiving.
Dean picked up his phone, and hit some buttons. It rung for a few moments before a groggy but frantic voice answered.
He sighed to himself and glanced away from Jack’s sleeping form, back over to the road, attempting to focus on it. However, due to the thought of emotions and being open, his mind began to veer to the fourth man in the car.
Even more so when Castiel finally allowed himself to react. A small and gentle smile broke out onto his face, his eyes were welling, but he didn’t hold back in the same way Dean did. He let the tears fall.
Hope yall are liking where this is going! The next three chapters will be dropping together like the first three. Likely some time next week.
“I-” Dean sighed, moving forward to sit across from Cas at the table again. Both of them pretended not to notice how careful and stilted he was while doing so. “I just want to be safe. I can’t lose-”
“Be myself?” He questioned, his voice bordering on a squeak. His heart was beginning to beat rapidly, and sweat was trickling down the back of his neck.
“Really?” That seemed to have been the right thing to say. Cas' tone sounded a lot more hopeful than it had a moment ago, much to Sam’s relief.
“Nice get up Professor” Dean had muttered after Cas had returned from his shopping trip with Sam and changed into his bookish new outfit.
Dean strode up quickly, his heart pounding out of his chest. He had the sense that everyone else in the room was feeling a similar way.
“Uh, hey Jack. I don’t know if you can hear me. I guess I’m uh, prayin. To you.” He looked side to side with his eyes as if waiting for something to happen. The rain continued to pour.
Cas sighed. When he'd seen Dean he'd contemplated telling him about Jack, but it didn't seem like the time. Not now that he was concerned about Sam. Not with all else plaguing them.
“How are you okay with giving up your life like this man?!” Dean stood up from his chair to get at eye level with Cas, who was standing.
I’m nervous about posting this one but I hope y’all like the direction it’s going in 🥺 Enjoy and have a lovely day xx
When Dean didn’t seem to respond, Castiel sighed lightly and shifted to look out the window pointedly. Dean, however, continued to glance back at him. He cursed himself for hurting his friend again, but he had to do this right. He promised himself this was the last time; he would never hurt Cas like this again. He would spend the rest of his days showering his life with joy to make up for it all.
But as he saw Cas and Dean follow him out hand in hand, he didn’t need telepathy to see how much happiness was radiating off them in that moment.
After a quick moment of surprise Dean’s full-blown smirk properly returned. Cas rolled his eyes again, this time less so annoyed as if he’d intended to gain that reaction.
They looked at each for a moment, an unsaid conversation passing between them. Anywhere the other one was they’d go. Their home was together now. It had been for a while. But now they both knew the other felt the same.
He received a side-eye in return. “I am. But this is also clearly just boosting your ego to dangerous extents Dean.”
It was still slightly uncanny seeing Cas out of his usual get up. Jack had insisted that they all dress up for the occasion, which meant Dean had just thrown on one of his FBI button-ups and some slacks. For Cas, it had meant being forced into a new set of duds.
“I’m... gonna pretend I didn’t hear that. Glad you’re back Cas. I’m gonna go- now. Good night.” Sam responded, partly amused, part horrified.
“No, I-“ Dean closed his eyes and sighed before continuing. “I mean like, settling down you know? Getting your own place.” Dean swore internally. He was terrible at this.
“From who? What is it?” Sam’s curiosity was piqued. Cas didn’t have any friends that he knew of besides them, and he was sure the other angels weren’t gift giving types.
“Dean, come on. You know I’m here to talk. And I’m the only one you can talk to this about right now so please, don’t hold it all in.” Sam stayed patient.
Sam stood up and walked over to Dean delicately. As if he were approaching a scared, wounded animal.
“You’re right.” Cas nodded solemnly, however, Dean could hear the humour in his voice. “Let me know when you want to go.” He finished as he began to walk out of the kitchen, leaving Dean to stew in whatever it was he was feeling.
Dean’s gaze attempted to flicker past Cas. However, his friend's eyes locked him in place, unable to move, to look away.
“Me- uh. Me and Cas. We’re headed out. Got reservations in a bit.” He rubbed the back of his neck, looking around his room in what he hoped was a casual way.
“You’re saying I’m making him feel bad.” Dean countered incredulously. Though there was a hint of uncertainty in his tone, a question.
But now. Having heard how Cas felt, he felt like his heart was going to explode out of his chest. He was scared, and he felt a tinge of excitement too. But all of that was overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment and dread. The deal. Whatever it was. Meant that Dean couldn’t do anything about what he’d heard. Not that there was necessarily anything he would do, he quickly noted to himself.
It hadn’t been easy for him the last time, and Dean sure hadn’t helped. Guilt poured over him in waves as he remembered the previous time. Cas. Helpless. On his own. All because of Dean’s stupid decisions.
“No- no it’s not Jack. Don’t worry.” Cas walked up to Jack, avoiding the pastry on the floor. “I’ll go find another pie immediately. You guys continue the preparations- Sam- clean this up.” Cas squinted at Sam one last time and patted Jack's shoulder before storming off.
“You guys finally sorted it out!” He beamed. His eyes were soft and he was looking at Dean with what looked like pride.
Dean glanced back and forth between the two as the silence festered. He didn't have a good feeling about whatever it was Cas was doing. The fact that he couldn't talk to her in front of all of them was especially telling.
Jack glanced back and forth between the two, frowning slightly. Was this flirting? He’d seen it on TV a lot, but he couldn’t always tell in real life. He tried going back over the bits and pieces of their conversation he’d listened in on earlier, but that didn’t give him any more clarity.
“He’s always talking about you! The others are going to be so jealous I got to meet Cas’ boyfriend.” As Dean whipped his head up at the words, she faltered for a moment, looking apologetic.
"Did you talk to him- to Sam?" Cas questioned, hovering in the doorway of the kitchen. His heart was pounding, his chest was tense. Having just seen Jack with the snake, he hadn't expected to walk into the kitchen to see Dean there looking just as stressed as Cas felt.
Cas couldn’t think of a reason why not, though he was still hesitant, especially now that Sam was reacting oddly. He removed the tape from his pocket and tentatively passed it over to Sam who was now grinning.
That clearly wasn’t enough to subdue Cas if the continued fidgeting was anything to go by. However, he didn’t seem to be able to bring himself to ask again. Eventually the growing tension was too much for Dean and he decided to start the conversation he’d originally been planning on having that day.
He began to walk back, hand in hand with Cas. When they were halfway to the car he stopped, suddenly remembering what had prompted this in the first place.
That was okay right? Usually that was alright. But in the confined space of the Impala, facing each other, the gesture seemed more intimate than usual. He didn’t linger, jolting his hand away as quickly as it had touched Cas.
After an 8 month hiatus here it is: the next chapter. Four more and an epilogue coming after this. Thanks for the patience xx
“Well? Do you wanna go check it out?” Dean snapped, mostly lightheartedly. To his dismay, Cas’ smirk had only grown.
“Let me finish, please man, I-“ Dean swallowed. “The thing that made you different. Made all the other angels so afraid of you, made them wanna change you-” Venom coated the last two words, with memories of Naomi flashing through his mind. “You always had a bit of humanity in you Cas, it’s what made you special, it’s what made you able to love. It’s what made me-“
It would also mean he could go on hunts unburdened. It’s not like he could keep this up in the long run. He’d have to get back into the swing of things eventually. Besides, maybe letting Cas do things on his own would make him feel better, not worse. Independence might make him feel more useful.
Waves of guilt used to wash over him whenever those thoughts would permeate his mind back in the day. He’d chastise himself, remind himself that this was his job, his purpose.
Dean took in a breath and opened the door. Cas stood inside, wearing one of Dean’s old black t-shirts, and some of his own grey sweatpants. He stepped away from the closet he’d been rummaging through.
“Don’t get me started.” Dean huffed out dramatically, turning his head to glare in Castiel’s direction.
He’d been saving people, hunting things, since he was a child. Hell, he’d never even gotten to be a kid really. That part of him died with his mother the first time around, back in that burning house. After all that, all those years, surely retirement was more than earned.
Dean could sense the question in it. He grumbled slightly under his breath but shot Cas a curt nod to give him the go-ahead.
He tried to follow along with Jack and Castiel’s conversation, but it only seemed to get more confusing. What did the Empty have to do with Cas’ happiness? Why wasn’t Cas happy? Their lives weren’t perfect, but having Cas around definitely made him happier. He had thought maybe Cas felt similarly. God- he sounded like a school girl with a crush.
“I enjoyed the songs, though that may be because I know you enjoy them. I thought it was a helpful gesture to try and broaden my musical tastes.” Cas responded. He stared at Dean inquisitorially.
He noted internally how often he’d found himself thinking that lately. And then proceeded to lock the thought behind the door designated for thoughts like that.
“You should probably go look for Amara now, it’s time Jack and I head out to this-“ he sighed exasperatedly “-murder investigation.”
"I think that may be necessary." He nodded seriously at Dean, who playfully shook his head with a smile.
“I- I just thought you might want a picture of you in the hat.” Dean finally responded, sheepishly. His voice was strained, and the embarrassment flooding off of him was palpable. Though Cas didn’t completely comprehend its source.
“Should we ask Jack and Sam to come along?” That snapped Dean out of his nervous spiral all of a sudden.
Cas looked down at the image. In it he stood, looking up with a slight frown he hadn’t realised was there. And on top of his head was the cowboy hat. He still thought it was slightly ridiculous, but Dean said it looked good, and since Dean had one too it meant they matched. He couldn’t quite place why, but both of those things made him happy.
Dean waved his hand dismissively. “Nothing bad, he’s just been- I don’t know- weird. He was asking me all these questions about why I was flirting with the chick at the store. Then he just ran off to Sam as soon as we got back, I don’t know.” He picked up his bottle, taking a sip.
Dean took in a breath and attempted to figure out where to start the conversation. After a moment he just let the first thing on his mind come out.
With a sigh, he made his way to the kitchen to update Jack. They had a lot of work to do. And Jack was going to have to act sniffly for the next few days.
He met eyes with Castiel through the rearview mirror for a second. Cas gave him a small smile before looking away out the window.
“No I mean- They aren’t actually together. They aren’t a couple.” Sam responded almost apologetically.
“I uh-” He started. He could sense the words that were about to slip out of his mouth, and if it had been a few weeks ago he may have been concerned. But all that time with Cas had definitely loosened him up a little. It didn’t help that Cas was always so upfront, sometimes jarringly so. That meant that Dean had also started saying things more openly. Well, bar a few.
His own look of shock began to soften slightly. He began to warm up, and before he knew it he was just staring back at Cas. For no reason in particular. It came as naturally and felt as comfortable as breathing.
“I wasn’t rude I-“ Dean paused and his eyes darted around as if he were trying to remember something. The silence lasted a moment too long.
“Listen, you don’t understand okay. You don’t get what it’s like. And besides you’re the one that got me into this in the first place.”
“I will say, that was all Jack, I didn’t know about that at the time.” Sam commented, shaking his head fondly at the now smirking Jack.
He’d only been making his way to the bunker’s kitchen for a late night glass of water. How was he supposed to know Cas and Jack would already be in there chatting amongst themselves? He couldn’t not eavesdrop now. So he stood there, in the hallway, a slight distance from the kitchen... listening. He wouldn’t have done this usually, but the word “deal” had pricked his ears and sent a feeling of dread throughout his body.
"Yeah. He's not doing so well. But I think he's gonna be alright. He's strong." Dean nodded as if he were reminding himself of that fact.
He mulled over the uncertainty of all to come quietly, before his thoughts were interrupted by the bunker door swinging open.
“Buddy, you don’t have much to compare it to.” Dean responded playfully with a casual wave of his hand. Though he still rubbed at the back of his neck shyly with the other one at the praise. It really had been a great date.
“Didn’t realise you’d end up being such a Led Zeppelin fan.” He continued with the same feigned lightness.
“Please?” Jack pleaded. Dean pleaded silently alongside him. He needed to know. For some reason this now seemed like the most important thing in the world. The world which, might be ending soon. Even so, the idea of something out there that Cas wanted and thought he couldn’t have. It hurt. Cas deserved to be happy, why couldn’t he be happy? Why shouldn’t he have whatever it was?
“Cas this is important damn it!” Dean said gruffly, clearly making an effort to not raise his voice too harshly.
“Dinner. It’s this place someone recommended, I asked him if he wanted to go. And now we’re going- uh- yeah.”
Sam glanced over at Cas, then to Dean and Jack respectively. His squinted eyes widened for a split-second as realisation washed over his features. Oh.
Cas’ eyes narrowed, a curious glimmer behind them. The faintest smile played at the edges of his lips.
“What? No. I want to. Let me.” Dean didn’t mean for it to come out as forcefully as it did. He snapped his head up to Cas, only to find the ex-angel gazing back at him with a curious expression.
Dean froze again. Unable to process what Jack had said. His head was empty. In that moment he could think nothing, he felt suspended.
However, that was deemed unnecessary as Cas’ responding look seemed to do away with the grin - mostly - however, he continued to look back and forth between Dean and Cas.
Dean still remembered the wrongness he felt in that moment. Dropping Cas off at Nora’s place. How he wanted to stop him but he didn’t understand why, and so opted instead for exaggerated enthusiasm. As he contemplated what he would’ve said if he hadn’t chickened out in the car that night, his thoughts were interrupted.
He was certain he was probably beet red at that moment. Cas’ gaze on him definitely wasn’t throwing him any less off balance.
Castiel blinked in confusion. He looked away from the crime scene ahead and glanced around until his gaze fell on the source of the noise.
“Hey, you got a minute?” Dean stood in his doorway, the night after Sam’s conversation with Cas. He was occasionally leaning back to peer out at either side of the hallway. Sam considered telling him to go away.
“Dean?” Cas questioned. Still staring at him intently, seemingly unaware of the carpooling crisis Dean’s psyche was experiencing at that moment.
He was definitely working, Dean thought to himself with a frown as he began grabbing the items he needed from the shelves. There wasn’t much, so he soon found himself standing at the counter in front of some bored looking teenager.
“Seriously. I don’t need you to get down on one knee for me.” He paused. “Can I have my ring now?” He nodded at the ring still in Dean’s hand.
Dean sighed, looking off to the side in mock annoyance. “Already a pain in my ass and we haven’t even moved in together yet.”
There was determination in his voice, but Cas was looking at Dean almost fearfully, like he was watching something slip away. Whereas Dean’s eyes were darting around to various sections of the floor. Neither of them was able to stop the conversation however, both stuck, only able to go forward when running back seemed like the safer option. Dean took another sip of his beer.
Dean just nodded at Cas blankly, throwing Kate a halfhearted wave before picking his bag of stuff off the counter and heading out the door.
Babysitting duty was over, but Dean was still offended on Castiel’s behalf. He wasn’t just free to be ordered around whenever his manager wanted. It had to be some kind of abuse of power to make your employees babysit for you. Surely?
Upon entering the Gas N Sip, he glanced around looking for any sign of Cas. He wasn’t anywhere to be seen.
He couldn’t say he wasn’t suspicious. While he really had appreciated the day out with Claire, it wasn’t the most subtle of plans. Getting him out of the house on his birthday, everyone insisting that they couldn’t come, but not having any concrete reason why.
Manuscripts of a spell containing similar ingredients and rituals. But instead of blasting away power, it would absorb. Some of the technical details flew over Dean’s head but he nodded along.
“I’m really sorry but the booking is for two on our system.” He glanced back and forth between the men at the table with the most apologetic grimace.
An unreadable expression crossed Castiel’s face for a moment, but it faded away just as quickly as he responded.
“Dean, it’s okay. Like I said. It’s not like we need to worry about it anytime soon. If ever”. Cas replied sadly.
Not worrying about the Empty deal was one thing. But this. Pushing him away. It was a different kind of hurt.
“We can only hope.” Castiel promptly responded before moving on. “Jack and I should go retrieve this final piece of the ritual.” He continued. His expression unchanging. Unrevealing.
Dean coughed out as he looked away, focusing on pulling the Impala into the bunker’s garage.  “Hah. Okay.”
“Hello Dean. Hello Cas. I was wondering. Could we please go out for family dinner?” He looked back and forth between the two of them, his grin not faltering for a moment.
In fact, he’d decided to not bring it up at all, after all, he didn’t want Cas to think he had a problem driving him around. He already had the newly human thing to deal with. Dean didn't want to make him feel like a burden on top of that.
“Me and Cas have some talking to do on the drive back and you’ve done enough snooping into our heads lately.”
“Have a nice drive Dean.” Sam spoke up right on cue, not looking up from his laptop. The sing-song tone told Dean all it needed to.
“Right?” Dean questioned with a level of gravity perhaps not warranted for the situation. He cursed Sam inwardly.
His brother rolled his eyes dramatically at him and began to sluggishly walk out of the room. “Fine. Whatever.”
“Dean I would love to retire with you. We can discuss it when we get back to the bunker.” He smiled and began to walk towards the Impala.
“It’s done. I worked quite hard on it, and I- Well I hope you were right and that he does like it.” His voice wavered at the end, sounding uncertain. But still, there was a small smile on his face.
Dean eyed him warily, growing immediately concerned with the too innocent expression he received in response. He sighed, deciding to let it go for the time being.
The rain softened. The wind whistled. He felt crazy, but, he looked around and softly spoke out anyways. “Jack is that-“ He paused. “I’m really sitting here talking to rain... I- I’ve lost it. Great.” He closed his eyes again.
“Uh- yeah. We uh. We finally did. So that’s what you guys had been trying to do this whole time huh?” He vaguely questioned, hoping Sam would say something revealing. He smiled tightly and nodded at him, waiting for a response.
They were playing a dangerous game, and Dean knew it. One slip up and Cas could be gone. Forever. Or that’s what he assumed. That was the frustrating part, he didn’t even know what exactly would happen if- He shook his head to himself.
Dean snorted out a laugh, and he was pleased to hear Cas also chuckle lightly. The sarcastic comment shouldn’t really have been inspiring warm and fuzzy feelings. But nonetheless, Dean’s face warmed at the pseudo-compliment.
Sam and Jack stood in the kitchen looking down at the birthday pie - or what had once been the birthday pie and was now a pile of filling and crust splattered on the floor. Jack looked like he was going to cry and that was the last thing they needed right now.
“This is strange. Sam only booking a table for two, him and Jack not showing up- You were right Dean, something is off.” He frowned accusingly at the intricately folded napkin in front of him.
Cas and Dean eyed him warily. Eventually, it seemed as if their joint scrutiny became too much as he began to slowly get up and move away from the map table. “I’ll uh- I’m gonna go talk to Jack. About. Something.” He hastily exited the room.
Anytime he had entertained otherwise, reality subsequently crashed down on him. When Cas would leave, over and over. When Cas would be hurt, damaged, all because of him. He’d kick himself for even thinking it was a possibility.
“I’m not great with words so I’ll uh- I’ll just um.” He reached into his jacket pocket. Grabbing onto the object in there, and clutching it tightly in his hand. It wasn’t visible as he took it out.
Dean coughed awkwardly. “Uh- Yeah. Um- maybe. Should we uh go back to the store and- No that’s- Nevermind.” He seemed to have lost any coherent train of thought all of sudden.
With a sigh Sam headed downstairs, contemplating whether it was appropriate to tell him he'd just caught his two dads making out at the door.
Cas made a face. “Yes. While we didn’t agree on the first one, even I have to admit that wasn’t the most welcoming establishment.”
Though, chauffeuring Cas around had produced the unintended benefit of spending more time together. But still- He had to complain to keep up appearances. And so he continued to ponder.
Every soft smile he shared with Cas, every casual brush of their shoulders, every laugh shared - it all had him freezing up, glancing around as if the Empty would show up then and there to take Cas away.
Sam huffed out a sigh of relief and looked up incredulously at the ceiling of his room. Of course. He should’ve known it would be something like this. For two people who’d been completely oblivious of their feelings for each other over the years, ever since it had all come out they’d been insufferably That Couple.
He smiled to himself, having received the expected reaction. He went to type a response before suddenly stopping himself. He put his phone down, deciding to let Dean stew for a moment. It didn’t take long for his phone to buzz again, and despite wanting to hold out longer, he couldn’t help but pick it up.
“Uh- never mind. Don’t worry about it.” He quickly turned back over to the laptop in front of them. Before he could hit play on the movie Cas had paused, a hand interrupted him.
He flicked his gaze towards Cas, whose expression seemed to suggest that perhaps Dean had been right to worry. He seemed almost caught out. Huh.
Cas hesitated as if he weren’t sure he was allowed to say anything. He didn’t know why he felt that way so he pushed it aside and answered.
After they’d saved the world this last time around Dean had promised himself, he was going to be the father he knew he could be. The one he’d been to Sammy, one nothing like his own dad. Jack deserved it.
Dean frowned, turning his head over to Sam. He knew that. It’s not like he was stopping Cas from having friends. Sure, he liked spending time with him, and sometimes that made him a little possessive. But that was a perfectly normal reaction for a best friend to have.
“You understand now why I have to find another way Dean.” Castiel peered up at him attempting to make eye contact.
“You know- because. Well, we’re both getting too old for this crap, and we both- you know-“ Dean coughed out.
“Yeah but they think we are! So let’s- ya know- make up!” Dean had exclaimed. He’d assumed that would be it, and so they’d walked back into the bunker after another set-up, acting as chummy as ever.
The silence lingered, but it was peaceful. They both simmered in the aftermath of Castiel’s words and the elation of now having what they once thought wasn’t possible.
Dean’s heart continued to pound, however, he couldn’t seem to stop the words from continuing to bubble out.
It wasn’t a big deal. He didn’t need Cas to watch movies with him. It was just that, Sam was annoying with his the-book-is-better comments, and he wouldn’t let him speak during the movie either. Whereas Cas always listened to Dean’s commentary intently. And not to mention, he made some hilarious observations of his own. Even if he didn’t always realise why they were funny.
Cas and Dean jumped apart. Looking at him dazed. Castiel’s hair was somehow messier than usual, which seemed an impossible feat. Dean on the other hand had an uncharacteristically shy smile plastered on his face, which he kept attempting to wash away with a serious face.
But then Dean looked up at the blue eyes staring into him. Swirling with tension and confusion and fear and-
“How about-“ he contemplated for a moment. “Okay, what if on your birthday you get him a gift too, and that can be a jumping-off point. Right? So he still gets a surprise, but then he can actually pick when he wants his birthday to be?” Sam raised his brows. He once again felt a little smug, he was full of good ideas today.
“Listen, I’ll plan a vacation for all four of us sometime soon okay? I just don’t trust sasquatch and his minion for now,” Dean muttered, placing his beer bottle down on the kitchen counter.
Cas beamed back at him, before looking away off to the side. “Thank you- and- sorry also about being so obnoxious around you these past few weeks.”
He didn’t know why, but he suddenly had a renewed sense of purpose. They should talk about it. Whatever happened, happened. But at least it would be out in the open. If not it would drive him mad.
“Okay well, if it makes you feel better-” He began, trying to catch Cas’ eye. Cas didn’t waver, opting to look pointedly at the wall behind Dean.
“I didn’t keep her number.“ He fiddled with his beer bottle, unsure why he’d felt the need to clarify. He suddenly felt very warm and cursed himself internally. It’s not like Cas cared, it made no sense to bring it up.
Their mouths were preoccupied more specifically. At that moment he realised he couldn’t hear their thoughts anymore, and boy was he grateful for that. If he could it might have been more scarring than any images he’d seen in either of their minds prior, judging by the happy noises Cas was making.
Eventually, Dean’s pity party was interrupted by the sound of the Impala’s passenger side door opening.
“Sorry, sorry. I’ll stop pushing. I just can’t believe the odds.” He glanced over at Cas with the last phrase, a knowing smile on his face.
“Dean, I can assure you. You’re being much too irritating for the Empty to be any threat to me right now.”
A voice called out from downstairs, saving Sam. "What's going on guys?" Jack called up. The three still up at the door glanced down at him. He was ignored for the time being.
“Or how about we try to find a game you might be good at?” Dean sat up from his slumped position with raised eyebrows, waving the bottle in his hand in Castiel’s direction as he spoke.
“Oh yeah, you just kept sending us to those weirdo retreats. Much better.” Dean sarcastically countered. Rolling his eyes as he reached for his beer.
He didn’t know what he wanted to say. He didn’t have anything more to talk about really. At least for now.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. He took down a mental reminder to wake up early and spit in Sam’s smoothie the next morning.
“No! Not that. I mean you’re an angel- I thought- There's no way you could feel that way about-" He cleared his throat. "I'm a mess.” The words faltered at the end. He looked down, frowning at his hands.
“Here we are.” The host – Lee, according to his name tag – suddenly interrupted his musings. Dean flushed a little; embarrassed as if the other two men had heard his thoughts. Though of course, they hadn’t. In fact, Cas was more concerned about something else at that moment.
And with that he stepped away, Jack following after him as they- he assumed- went off to call Amara.
“The way you’ve been acting. Why have you been av- Did I piss you off or something?” He decided his first choice of question would’ve put him in too vulnerable of a position. That didn’t seem to matter however. His voice betrayed him anyway, with the hurt bleeding through clear as day.
“Uh nothing I-“ He sighed. He did need to get on with the spell. “I’ll go see what’s taking him so long.”
“Dean I rebelled against heaven for you- On multiple occasions. I thought my feelings were pretty clear.”
Cas shuffled in quickly, closing the door behind him. He seemed to finally relax the slightest once he was inside and out of the apparently ominous hallway.
“No offence buddy but you’re terrible at this game.” Dean snickered lightly from the couch in front of the table, taking a sip of his beer.
Normally he’d have minded missing out on a hunt. But with Cas permanently in the bunker, it didn’t seem as big of a deal as it once would have.
“I love you man” Dean added on for emphasis. His eyes were beginning to glisten up just as Cas’ were.
“We’re uh- We-” He seemed to be having trouble getting the words out. He glanced over at Cas anxiously.
“Jack – Cas and Dean aren’t married” Sam spoke slowly, narrowing his eyes. He stepped toward Jack gently as if he were approaching a skittish animal.
“What the hell?!” Dean glared up at his brother, whose face was bordering apologetic, pained, and slightly hysterical all at once.
“-I just can’t. If I keep letting myself feel- I don’t want to put him in danger.” He barely managed to get it out.
“No! No, I like spending- I um.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, remembering what Cas had said to him the other day about spending time together. He tilted his neck down to disguise his smile. “I don’t mind driving you to work.”
Cas turned back around and tilted his head in confusion. A moment passed before Dean could continue.
By the end of it Cas seemed nonchalant. But Dean only felt even more sick. They sat side by side at the end of his bed, looking out into the room.
“Dean I see the way you guys are with each other. It’s obvious.” Sam replied as if he was talking about something as trivial as the weather.
However, the angel’s expression had Dean immediately falling apart again. The howling continued on for another stretch of time. He gripped onto the cotton of his shirt tightly, attempting to push down the ache that was now developing in his stomach from laughing.
“Dean if this is about what I said last night. I- I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I didn’t want-“
That one angel had told him that ever since Cas laid a hand on him in hell he’d been lost. And Dean had held onto that. If laying a hand on Dean could tear Cas down so irreparably. What could loving him do?
“We have to tell him you overheard.” Sam looked at him, waiting for the protest to come... and it did.
The loud vibrating noise of a phone cut him off. Dean patted the pocket to which he’d returned his phone earlier.
“No I. No man. Not at you. It’s what any of us would’ve done. It’s just- It’s just not fair.” Dean painfully choked out, not looking at Cas.
“They tricked us first! This is payback until they cave and admit it, or until we find out what they’re up to.” He pointed his beer bottle at Cas.
Meanwhile, Jack reached Sam’s doorway and gushed out in one breath the question plaguing him: “Are Dean and Cas getting divorced!?”
“It’s important. I need to speak to you. Alone.” He breathed in slowly, pointedly not looking at anyone else in the room.
“Because it was honestly getting a bit ridiculous. Seriously Cas, every time something happens to you, he’s a mess. You should’ve seen him after purgatory.” Sam shook his head as he continued. “But that’s not even the worst of it, the worst is the pining. Do you guys know you have a bit of a staring problem? I mean no offence but-“
Dean jumped slightly in place. He rubbed the back of his neck before waving at Cas awkwardly. He hoped Cas wouldn’t realise he’d been starring- watching- whatever.
“Well, I’ll send it to ya buddy.” He responded, patting Cas’ shoulder with almost too much force. His voice sounded slightly thicker than usual. Cas couldn’t tell if he was purposefully trying to make it sound gruffer all of a sudden or if he was just hearing things.
Despite all his bravado, Cas still managed to let out a surprised sound when they made contact. He faltered only for a moment however, before falling into the kiss softly. Despite the tension that had been buzzing between them only moments prior, their lips met each other gently, as if they had all the time in the world. For the time being they did.
Taking that as a yes, Castiel took out his phone and waited for a few police officers to pass them, sensing they might find their picture-taking at a crime scene strange. Then he held up his phone.
Cas sighed, beginning to exit the car before he halted slightly. He seemed to be thinking something over, taking in a breath before speaking.
“I- do you think this-” He glanced up at Cas nervously, clearing his throat. “What did you think when I asked you to go out for dinner, I mean- did you-” He stared pointedly down at his half eaten burger, seemingly unable to finish his sentence.
He glanced around and stifled a groan as he noticed that the slowing car had seemed to wake up both Jack and Sam. They both lifted their heads and blinked sleepily at the scene around them.
Cas looked back at him with a straight face, though Sam detected a hint of worry fluttering behind his cerulean eyes.
Jack shook his head before responding solemnly. “Dean was flirting with the lady at the crystal store. I thought he was cheating on Castiel.”
Dean reached for it, letting go of Cas’ hand to unwrap the gift. Occasionally looking up at him curiously as he did so. He discarded the silver wrapping paper on the counter next to them.
Dean had to admit - despite all his grumbling - it wasn’t as if he wasn’t having fun. It wasn’t just teaming up against Jack and Sam that was entertaining. All the time he’d been spending with Cas, it had been making him a lot happier. Cas seemed to be enjoying it too. Still, he had to figure out what his idiot brother and kid were up to.
“Why are you on his case today man?” Dean questioned, with annoyance underpinning his tone and features.
“I really thought you would’ve gotten the hang of Scrabble Cas” Sam stated sadly, his tone much too innocent. He shook his head in overstated remorse.
Dean could swear he saw a subtle smirk grace Castiel’s face only for his expression to straighten out again. He ignored it and turned his attention to the road, growing more embarrassed by the second.
“Yeah, yeah.” He muttered, giving the Impala another glance. With a sigh, he continued. “Okay, let’s go.”
That all too familiar guilt panged in his chest again. He had been making amends since, but it still ate him up inside. The guilt of not just recent events but how he’d treated Jack for a long time.
What he didn’t expect next, was for Cas to snort out a laugh. He whipped his head up to see the other man holding back a smile.
“Yes,  I was serious about retiring. But only if it’s together.” Cas gazed at him intently, as if trying to decipher where Dean was going with the conversation after this. Or perhaps, trying to seem that way; subduing his hopes so that they wouldn't be painted across his face too blatantly.
He hadn’t considered he’d have to explain its significance to Cas, something which in hindsight, had him sweating slightly.
Dean groaned. Somehow Cas being an irritating asshole was breaking his resolve more than anything. Still, Dean pushed through, this time he spoke more forcefully.
Dean continued. “I uh- I’m gonna be honest man I didn’t really understand most of it. I just. I just heard Jack ask you about what to tell Sam and me about some deal and then I uh. I left and told Sam.” He tried to sound convincing, but he couldn’t tell if it was coming out that way.
“I don’t know Jack, fingers crossed it's going well.” He considered further. “We probably shouldn’t get too hopeful though. It might not work straight away.”
Sam clearly wanted to press further but he nodded. He wasn’t taking the news about Jack well, but he was determined.
Cas sighed, glancing up at Dean with furrowed brows. But ultimately he decided to let it go - for the moment - and humour him. He couldn't fix everything going on, but what he could do was make Dean smile. That was enough for the time being.
“I know those two have clearly lost their minds or something. But still uh- it’s been fun hanging out with you buddy.” He coughed awkwardly. He could feel his cheeks heating up.
The idea of this angel- his angel- doing something as human as sitting down to make a mixtape. Learning how to do it, let alone putting it together. Thinking over what to put on there. All for him. The idea threatened to bring tears to his eyes.
If Cas was mad at him or something, that at least could be resolved. But if this was just what he wanted… Dean shook his head, chasing away the thought. Today he was going to take a page out of Sammy’s book and actually communicate.
Then, with tears trickling down his cheeks, with a gentle and beautiful smile, with loving eyes; Cas stepped up closer to him.
At that Cas slowed to a stop, and sighed. His stoic expression faltered to one that was more so abashed.
Dean had wondered why Cas was even bothering to try and convince him it was a good idea. Should’ve just gone and done it. But for some reason having his support seemed to matter to Cas. Maybe that’s why Dean ended up folding in the end.
“Yeah it uh- Usually when you give a mixtape like that to someone it’s- You know.” He muttered, flushing. He still wasn’t great with all this.
That was the only thing that had changed recently. The only new development between them. Cas had told Dean he’d become human to get out of the deal, but what if now he didn’t want to? What if he’d changed his mind?
“Why are you laughing?!” Dean whisper-yelled at him. Offended that his brother wasn’t talking this seriously.
“He wouldn’t say what. Should we-“ He hesitated slightly as if he didn’t want to say it. “Should we go back?”
Cas rolled his eyes. “No, Sam that’s not why I’m here. I need your help. I want to make him a mixtape.” His voice became hesitant at the last phrase, his eyes flickered downward.
Dean wracked his brain for reasons why Cas could be acting this way, until it clicked, and with that his heart sank.
“Talk. To. Him.” Sam repeated, slowly pushing Dean out the door. He’d tried the gentle and supportive approach for the past half an hour, but clearly it wasn’t working, and he had other things to do.
At that Dean rolled his eyes and wandered over toward Castiel’s end of the table. He hadn’t gotten to see Cas much since he had gotten back from the hunt with Sam. It was probably for the best, but Dean missed their friendly interactions, or even their argumentative interactions.
“Well, you look great for your age” Dean replied, coughing slightly. His cheeks heated up as soon as the words stumbled out. It wouldn’t have been so bad if the comment had sounded casual or lighthearted, but his voice betrayed him. It was soft and- he hated to think it but, slightly shy.
Cas eyed the bottle disapprovingly but didn’t say anything. He continued to fiddle with the mixtape. He held it in his hands running his thumbs over the writing on the front. It seemed as if he found it comforting.
“Boyfriend?” He questioned. He hadn’t meant for his voice to take on that slightly squeaky quality at the end, however, he had more pressing matters to consider. He stared at her wide eyed as she sighed at him.
“Ah well Dean. You stay here and chauffeur Cas. I’ll call around and see if someone else can take the hunt.”
Dean’s exaggerated smirk faded away, his brows pinched together and his mouth parted slightly. He blinked a few times as he looked away to the side. He was quiet for a moment.
Cas’ hands found his hair this time, not tugging but gripping onto it slightly. He was slightly clumsy, however, all but made up for it with intensity.
Dean snorted, however, his cheeks reddened slightly, and he glanced around haphazardly at the insinuation.
Dean snorted and responded. “Yeah, he just can’t keep his overgrown ass out of everyone else’s business.” He shook his head fondly before continuing. “I just- Have I been too much?”
Sam attempted to think quickly. Jack was going to be very upset with him if he screwed up Dean’s surprise party. Even more so, he shuddered at the idea of how pissed loved-up-constantly-doting-on-Dean Cas would be if Sam spoiled the surprise.
As he pondered that, he noticed Sam’s expression clear all of a sudden. He eyed Dean warily, however, the corners of his mouth seemed to be straining to tilt upwards.
Minutes passed, maybe hours, he didn’t know, nor did he care. Time didn’t feel real anymore, and he never wanted to leave the moment he was in. Every instance in which they had to part for air felt torturously long. He could’ve sworn he heard a noise in the distance but that didn’t matter. He was never going to move, to leave, to let go.
“We’ll find him, we’ll bring him back. Because that’s what we do.” Sam continued, placing a hand on Deans shoulder. Retreating it when he received a subtle flinch in response.
To avoid further queries he picked his phone up again and began reading through articles that interested him online. He sent one about the consequences of bee extinction to Dean.
“Listen Dean, I don’t want to pressure you, this is something you need to work through on your own. But I’m kind of in a bind here man.” Sam stated apologetically.
“Um. You know what don’t worry about it.” Dean responded anxiously. Now that his brother was standing in front of him, this conversation seemed like a terrible idea.
Dean swiftly walked over to the side of the car Cas was exiting out of and gestured for him to follow him up the road slightly. He didn’t want Sam eavesdropping right now.
“Yeah but-” Sam looked over at Cas again, like he was an equation Sam was attempting to solve “I can’t remember the last time you haven’t lost a game we’ve played, it seems borderline impossible.” His tone was lighter, yet still accusatory.
Sam rolled his eyes. “You guys aren’t exactly subtle. Cas has been sleeping in your room for a month for one.” He gestured over at Cas, who squinted in consideration.
More so, what if Cas didn’t agree? What if he didn’t-  what if he didn’t want to become human? Even if it meant out of the deal?
God. He was losing his mind, there’s no way he could keep this to himself. He considered it again for a moment.
Dean sighed loudly and dropped his face into his hands. He knew why. The thing he’d kept pushed back into the recesses of his mind had been bothering him more and more. The defences he had in place for those walls were faltering.
The shift of surprise in Cas’ eyes, and beaming smile that followed. Well, it only made Dean curse himself for not saying it sooner.
“It was hard to find something this late, they only had pecan, but it will have to do.” He placed the pie gently on the counter, before looking over at Sam. “You aren’t allowed near this. I’m sorry.”
As they walked back into the bunker, Castiel approached the two of them. He nodded at Dean and looked over at Jack.
Dean did not enjoy how tense the car ride was. He drove in silence as a word from earlier repeated over and over again in his head. Cas didn’t seem to be doing any better next to him, fidgeting incessantly.
Eventually, he wouldn’t even need Dean anymore. He tried not to let that sting, as he pushed away the guilt at not wanting that to happen.
Sam rolled his eyes in response, muttering something unintelligible under his breath. Impressed? Suppressed? Something sounding like that. Dean couldn’t make it out.
“Well, you could always quit if you hate it so much.” Dean suggested innocently, raising his brows and shooting Cas a look.
“What happened is, is that your brother was extremely rude to the waitstaff.” Cas cut in; his voice stiff. He tilted his head at Dean accusatorily.
Cas didn’t seem to be following in their footsteps, much to Dean’s disapproval. They had Chuck-related end of world crap to be dealing with. But apparently his- whatever he was- had decided a talk about feelings was in order.
Who knew these two would somehow be more insufferable once they resolved their issues? Sam wondered if this was karma for making fun of the mixtape and inadvertently forcing them to admit their feelings for each other.
So they had been flirting! Did that count as cheating? Jack didn’t know much about the topic. He decided that he’d have to go find out more back at the bunker. As he drafted his plan, he was snapped out of his thoughts again by Dean’s voice.
Sam squinted at the angel next to him, and then glanced quickly up at Dean and Jack who were very much engrossed in their respective pizza and beer. He mulled over something for a moment before speaking up slowly.
“Thank you for sharing them with me.” Cas nodded, this time with more sincerity, and began to make his way out again.
He furrowed his brow in contemplation. As far as he knew you weren’t allowed to flirt with people if you were married.
If third-wheeling before they’d sorted their shit out was bad, from now on it was going to be even worse, Sam realised as he stepped out.
“I don’t know man.” Dean uneasily replied. His heart was racing again. This all felt like playing with fire. He was scared of his own... feelings. Yes. But he was also worried for Cas. Dean didn’t want to be the cause of something bad happening to him. He also knew that Sam and him didn’t know enough about the deal to figure out a way to fight it on their own. Especially not while they were also trying to deal with Chuck. This couldn’t have come at a worse time.
“Listen I’m happy for you guys but can we please get going!?” He yelled out, raising his arms in the air in frustration.
“It was clear as day in my head. But I couldn’t say it. He was there and then he wasn’t and he saw me Sammy. He saw and he loved me anyway, and I couldn’t say it.” Dean spat out the last words. His throat constricted, more straining to come out but unable. He glanced up to the sky trying to stop the already there tears.
He kept going over the conversation he’d heard. No matter which way he interpreted it or tried to find some other meaning - it always ended the same. Like in the movies, Jack had said, and Cas had agreed. Cas was in love with him. Angel of the lord, cosmic entity Cas. Powerful. Good. Too good for-
He’d known he wasn’t straight for a long time. He’d fought against it for almost as long. But after his dad had died. The further that time took him away from his influence, the easier it got to toy with the idea. Castiel’s presence had definitely forced him to do some major re-evaluating quite early on. It took years, but even when he got there, he just couldn’t wrap his head around the angel thing.
“If it was the only way... And if it’ll really bring you that much relief to have me out of this deal then I’m willing to do it. I haven’t felt like an angel for a while.” He replied softly.
Sam yelped out in a way that Dean would’ve made fun of him for if he hadn’t been otherwise occupied. The two brothers collided with the railing in front of the door whereas Cas fell forward onto Dean with a grunt.
At that Cas squinted. He was perpetually confused with this conversation. What was the big deal with the mixtape?
“I’m so glad you’re back man, even if you decided to have sex in the back of the Impala before even coming to say hi.” Sam nudged Cas’ elbow with his own.
“I promise you. If I feel that there is any danger of the Empty taking me away, I will tell you. For now, though, there is too much on our plates. I’m fine, I promise.” Cas spoke with gentle firmness.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly. ‘What? The white picket fence life? That’s- that’s something you want?” There was a hopeful tilt to the end of that sentence that didn’t seem to go unnoticed by Cas. Dean cursed himself internally for that.
“When you got back from the Empty- the first time around- uh yeah.” He quickly finished, discarding his plan and sticking with a safe answer.
Sam blinked. Castiel’s mouth had not moved for that last bit, and yet Sam had heard his voice. He stared at Cas who paid him no further attention.
At Jack’s solemn expression Cas added, “Any one of us would be happy to go to the beach with you Jack.” Then he looked over at Sam with a squint. “Just not the two of us together.”
Dean stifled a chuckle at Castiel’s seriousness. Whatever Sam and Jack’s plot was here, he had to admit it was fun to get to team up and spend time with Cas like this.
“I-” Sam glanced back and forth between the two. He seemed to be at a loss for words. ‘For once’, Dean thought to himself.
“If that slushie machine malfunctions. One. More. Time.” The specific bite in Cas’ voice had once been reserved for demons and various other so-called abominations.
“What’s wrong?” Cas questioned again, the concern blatant all over his features. Dean had been the one to suggest the trip, however he didn’t seem to be enjoying it at all. He hadn’t even commented on the impressive dessert menu.
Dean frowned for a moment, then shrugged as if to say ‘fair enough'. That was definitely early on, and knowing that even back then Cas cared about him in that way- he couldn’t think too hard about it.
“Mom actually, that was part of the reason she went out with our Dad in the first place. He knew all the words to their songs.” He swallowed.
Castiel looked away sheepishly, rolling his eyes. They landed on the weathered bookcase in the corner of the room. It was littered with disorganised files and books that the bunker residents had let get out of hand. He glared at it as if the piece of furniture had asked the offending question.
Sam knew he should say something. He was going to say something while they sat at the small table in their motel room eating their crappy breakfast. But then he heard-
Nothing to discuss that wouldn’t put Cas in danger from the Empty. But even then he just wanted to stay on the phone with Cas a little longer. Just a moment. He wanted to hear his voice, he wanted-
There were still another thirty minutes before he had to pick Cas up from work. As Sam droned on, he sighed to himself. When had he became so clingy?
“Yeah! I mean I don’t want to assume, whether you’re gay or bi or whatever label you wanna go with, I’m here for you man.” Sam spoke tenderly, his eyes softening. He reached over and patted Dean’s shoulder gently.
Sometimes it was just reassuring, comforting. Unspoken words would pass between them. It made Dean feel… warm. It lifted a weight off his chest. They didn’t have to mean anything more than what they made him feel in the moment.
“Well I’ve seen how you act around him. And he acts the same around you? You’re always staring at each other. And you’re sad when he’s not around, and- he’s sad when you’re not around. So he must be in love with you too!” Jack excitedly proclaimed. “Oh wait, no that’s bad isn’t it? Because of the Empty deal?”
Cas sighed. Not harshly. But with a deep sadness Dean could detect even without seeing his face. He could imagine his furrowed brows, his soft oceanic eyes, his pink lips parted-. Dean sighed. Those thoughts again.
But now. Now Cas was back. He was back, and Dean assumed- hoped- that even if he was mad, he was indeed still in love with him.
He couldn’t say it yet. But once he could, he would never stop. He believed wholeheartedly that if he ever finally got to say it he’d never know how to say anything else again.
It had taken a millennia to convince Dean to even talk to Cas. And despite having sent him back into the building a while ago, he still hadn’t made much progress.
“Nothing’s wrong” Castiel responded, now completely at ease while Sam panicked. “I need your help with something.”
“That bastard hit you with a spell, there’s no way you’re fine.” Dean said gruffly, glaring out at the road as he drove.
“Like I was saying… It doesn’t seem too complicated, we’ll probably be done with it and back in four days at the most.”
“It’s nothing Jack. It’s... it’s not something that I could ever have.” Cas responded, attempting to sound casual. It only came out pained.
Swiftly, as the other man’s exterior began to waver, Cas stood up from his end of the table, moving over to the seat next to Dean. He placed a hand gently on his cheek. It was immediately covered by Dean’s. They let the silence linger for a moment.
“Nothing, I just..." Dean sighed, looking away. "Sam was asking why you don’t drive yourself to work,” He finally admitted.
On the bright side it meant that Cas finally looked up. He tilted his head sadly, before wiping the expression away.
“You want to retire… with me. Why?” There was a curiosity and glimmer underlying his eyes as he asked the question.
The next text came through much quicker. What Cas didn’t expect was the rush of warmth that would flood him when it did. His heart rate quickened slightly, while confusion overwhelmed him.
Cas glanced around, stalling for a second before reaching into his trench coat pocket and pulling out a sheet of paper. Sam reached out and hesitantly took it from him, straightening his face in preparation for whatever would be on there.
Sometimes he still couldn’t believe he got to have this. Any of it, he noted as he thought about the party and the people in the other room. But Cas especially. That had always seemed so out of reach.
They both knew what was missing. They’d known ever since Jack faded away and they’d road tripped to the girls. The topic had been a heavy presence among them, with neither approaching it first. Dean didn’t know how to: how could words describe everything he was experiencing and feeling? Sam didn’t want to push it. To say too much and have Dean burrow into himself and not be able to bring him back out. He still remembered how it was last time, the grief, the anger, the giving up.
“What is it Sam?” Cas asked with an unashamed hint of annoyance, an inquisitorial frown on his face.
I really hope y’all are enjoying this!! I’m finding it cathartic changing little details from the season to make things ultimately happier (in the end). xx
Soon enough it had become a game of seeing how obvious they could be around Sam before he figured it out. Cas grumbled about how immature the whole situation was, but Dean knew he was having just as much fun as he was.
“Pie.” Cas suddenly cut in again. “You were berating them over their lack of pie.” He spoke emphatically.
Silence cut through the air again. It was not where either of them had expected the conversation to go. Or start at least.
This is more of a filler chapter, it's just the last two are taking a lot longer to edit than I thought they would! They are finished though, so should hopefully be out soon
Cas rolled his eyes and complied, apologizing to Sam as he asked him to move. The taller brother exited the car and made his way to the backseat.
“There’s no plan. We didn’t mean to not show up all those times, things just- kept coming up." He asserted half-heartedly. "Come on Dean you’ve wanted a beach trip for so long.”
“No, you need to explain the mixtape, Dean.” Cas replied, feigning a serious tone. He was great at turning on that oblivious angel act when he wanted to, despite having been on Earth for years now.
It had been weird when Sam and Jack had insisted that they drive separately to the restaurant. But he had figured he could question them more once they got here since they’d remained tight-lipped back at the bunker.
Dean just blinked back at him. That didn’t help Cas’ worried expression. Though his worry seemed to shift slightly as he glanced at his coworker, who smiled teasingly at the two of them.
“Sam says he’ll be back later today. It was a simple salt and burn.” Cas relayed formally, placing his phone back into his pocket.
“I’ve been in heaven helping him reshape things, I think I may have also convinced him to come back to the bunker once he’s done patching up heaven. He can be God with his family around him.” He rambled, clearly having too much too say while avoiding what he was really wanting to address. He looked up at Dean, gulping. Dean was frowning back, eyes questioning still. So he continued tentatively.
He paused for a moment, contemplating before he began to type again. He did want to keep talking to Dean, but Sam had made him realise it was getting late.
He came down the stairs and casually dropped two six-packs onto the table, before slouching into a chair next to Cas.
“Do you want me to come with you or something?” Sam offered with a confused shake of his head. He glanced at Cas for help. Cas stared up at the ceiling and questioned his taste in men.
Finally, their hands fell, clasping each other in the space between them. Dean gestured for Cas to speak.
What he couldn’t understand was Cas’ point of view. Really that was what always kept him right on the precipice of it, not going any further.
Castiel put both hands on either side of Dean’s face and pulled him away slightly. The man smirked up at him with swollen lips. His hair was somehow messier than usual, and his eyes were wide. He was beautiful.
He didn’t look at his friend for too long, only catching a glimpse of a blue button up under the vest.
That’s the first time Dean processed the moment. Alone. In the Impala. With Cas. Cas, who loved him back. There was so much to talk out between them still, healing to be done. But Dean’s mind was taking a detour... talking could wait.
Once Dean was done internally drowning in embarrassment over his comment, his mind wandered back to the idea of retirement again. He wondered if Cas was over it all too. In his weakest of moments, Dean would allow himself to picture it. Him and Cas. Their own place. No more hunting. They could even set up a room for Jack.
“I don’t know, I just-” He sighed lightly to himself. How was he supposed to word this without sounding like some kind of insecure teenager?
This just came about while I was working on the last chapter but it didn’t really fit in there so here’s a short sweet little epilogue. Enjoy xx
Dean chuckled lightly, shaking his head fondly. He then pondered for a moment before responding. “What about Lisa?” He raised a brow.
Sam was experiencing a moment of déjà vu. It looked like he wasn’t done being involuntarily dragged into his brother and his brother’s boyfriend’s schemes.
“Oh yeah and she wasn’t pissed about us lying to her the first time around at all.” Dean mumbled back sarcastically.
He glanced over at Dean. Dean who was hyper-focused on the coffee in his hand right now. Despite his casual demeanour though, Sam could hear all the ramblings in his head, and even worse sense the ooey gooey feelings he was radiating right now.
What they had thought to be one ghoul had turned out to be five. The energy in the Impala on the drive back was tense to say the least... they were all worn out and grumpy. Except for Jack who seemed happy to be involved as ever.
“Alright, so not up for constructive criticism at the moment.” He grumbled under his breath, unaffected by the gesture. He chose that moment to return to his book.
Instead he just picked up another beer and joined Cas at the table again. He opted for a slight topic change.
“I don’t know Dean, maybe talk to him.” Sam stated sarcastically. “Tell him how you feel even.” He continued.
Push him away. Keep yourself safe. Hurt him so he’ll be better off. That’s what his mind was telling him.
“We know that completing this mission will destroy Chuck as well as kill Jack in the process. We can’t- we won’t let that happen.”
“Whatever you say babe.” Sam continued to chuckle under his breath, while this time Cas patted Dean’s shoulder reassuringly.
A few years ago he never would’ve allowed himself to think it. Hunters don’t get to have normal lives he would’ve thought. Hell, even if they could, they don’t with angels, they don’t with-
Dean straightened out his own face too in mock seriousness, dramatic enough so the other man would detect the humour in it.
“Might even go take a stroll after.” Dean internally winced at the use of the word stroll, but clearly desperate measures were in order.
“Fine.” Cas paused, wracking through his brain for a moment. He finally seemed to land on an example, as his demeanour changed. He straightened up slightly, glancing around the room and taking in a breath.
“By the way, how did the mixtape end up going?” He was curious. Neither Cas nor Dean had bothered him again with their birthday plans, and while he’d been thankful at first, his curiosity was getting the better of him.
“Right now we’re gonna go continue what we were doing” Dean quietly started talking to Sam while glancing sideways at Cas - who looked back at him wide-eyed but smiling ever so slightly. Then he turned back to his brother and continued. “And then I’m gonna make you pay-”
Dean’s breath hitched. Like the questions that had come before it, this one sounded like a challenge. He didn’t know if he had it in him to step up to it.
“Yeah they uh-“ Dean walked over to a nearby table to rest atop it slightly before continuing. Castiel’s eyes followed the journey.
Cas’ brows jumped up all of a sudden. “You’re ready to leave the bunker?” He questioned. “What about Sam?”
“What is it Dean?” Cas asked in a slightly softer tone, settling down the item he’d been holding, and carefully moving closer.
Dean’s eyes were brimming with tears, his brow furrowed. Emotions threatened to flood out and he was desperately trying to not let them overwhelm him.
And with that, he skipped out of the kitchen leaving the two men confusedly staring at his retreating form again.
“Didn’t think what Cas?” Dean responded, no anger in his voice, just sadness. “That I wouldn’t want you back? That every day here hasn’t been hell? Knowing what I know? Knowing that you-“ He looked away, not wanting to break.
Dean stood frozen in place. His mouth opening and closing. He gulped. The ability to speak had seemed to escape him all of a sudden. If he didn’t feel like he was gonna throw up, he might have barked out a laugh at Sam’s affirmations.
Sam had been trying not to eavesdrop onto their thoughts but at this point, he was getting frustrated. So he listened to their conversation through each other’s minds, trying to not intrude on their actual thoughts too much.
“I- In the movies I’ve watched that’s what it means when you make someone a mixtape.” The statement coming out more like a question.
What he did next was not so much stomp over to the garage grumpily, but maturely stride over. That is what he would argue. Luckily there were no witnesses to declare otherwise.
Turns out Dean had been both right and wrong. Cas did love him, Cas could love in that way, and love even the most broken of men. But loving Dean had also been his demise. About that Dean had been right.
“Dean? Are you alright?” Cas questioned, looking at him concernedly. He lifted his hand to Dean’s shoulder in a comforting motion.
“What you’ve been- What I’ve heard you thinking.” Cas glanced around, awkwardly asking the question.
Dean glanced over at Sam to make a ‘happy now?’ face, but the younger brother seemed to be too busy contemplating something. Whatever it was couldn’t be good because he looked much too happy about it.
“Okay let’s not turn this into a coming of age flick” Dean quickly quipped back. Growing uncomfortable with how vulnerable he felt.
Dean stood up promptly. He grabbed Sam by the arm and started roughly dragging him out of the motel room.
Well more so he’d been acting exactly the same as always. Which was weird. Surely after a near-miss like that something should’ve changed right? At the very least Cas should’ve been mad at him. But no. He hadn't even shot him an odd glare or snappy remark.
At first Cas and Dean had played up their fighting angle to try and get more information. When that hadn’t worked they’d switched gears.
“I- uh” Cas composed his confused self, and sighed. “I know he doesn’t Jack. And that’s okay. I’m glad to even be a part of his life. But, he sees me as a brother, he’s told me many times.” Cas replied tenderly. But he could hear the ache underlying it all.
As he did, Mindy; the eccentric store-clerk he’d been questioning; walked up to them. They’d already been taking for a while, which is why Jack had wandered away in the first place. He didn’t understand most of their conversation and they’d stopped talking about the case a while back.
"With Dean. You got kind of a weird look on your face after you put your phone down." Sam responded to the expression.
The call didn’t last long, and aside from Cas asking Sam if everything was okay; the answer to which seemed to be enough to suffice him; Dean didn’t seem to detect anything concerning. As Cas put the phone down, he looked up at Dean with a slightly confused expression.
Cas shook his head dismissively. “There’s just- There’s something there. I feel like we can work something out with Billie’s help.” He looked up at Dean. “I’ll figure it out.”
“Cas’ got the next three days off, but then he’s got work.” Dean stated plainly, as if it should’ve been obvious.
“So the crystal shop was a bust. Didn’t get anything useful from there.” Dean stated, hoping that the added buffer of conversation would distance him further from the previous moment.
A few hours later Dean sat on the edge of his bed, next to a box of pizza he’d found in the fridge soon after they’d gotten home. They’d only had time for entrées at the restaurant before Dean had grown impatient and decided they should get their plan started, much to Castiel’s annoyance. He had actually quite liked it there, despite not actually being able to eat anything.
“Yes. Jack, he, brought me back.” Castiel replied, giving a small almost smile and looking down at his hands. He was nervous.
As Dean glared at his brother, Cas looked back and forth between them for a moment, squinting in confusion and exasperation at once. Eventually he seemed to put two and two together.
“How you think this is gonna go down?” Dean tried casually, looking over at Cas expectantly. The other man shifted away the slightest amount.
Sam shook his head fondly, however, Cas continued to speak before he could brush him off. “The scheming, the ‘PDA’” - he said with air quotes - “what we did in your room yesterday. Though that wasn’t part of the plan, more so just a spontaneous-“
“Well, I’m off to bed. Goodnight Sam. Goodnight Dean.” He nodded briefly at both of them before retreating. The brothers called out their respective goodbyes to him.
At this point Cas finally spoke up. “Dean? Why do you think the curse has something to do with you?” His eyes widened. “You haven’t made another deal have you? Is that the truth that needs to be revealed?” Castiel’s voice travelled from concern to irritation.
“He’s being a dick,” Dean muttered to Cas before turning to Sam with a glare. “Stop being a dick I’m trying to tell you something.”
“I’m just saying. I thought the night was going to go much differently when you made the comment about not letting me die a v-“
“Well, I may as well start at the beginning.” He stated plainly. “When I rebelled for you before the final seal was broken. I was in love with you then.” He glanced around the room casually, though it was clear the admission was anything but casual.
“Um.” Dean gulped. “How are you? Are you worried about the Empty?” Fuck. Why did he keep doing that? Seeing how close he could get? He was being reckless and selfish and it only added fuel to his self contempt.
“Well, I have to get him a present, especially now that we’re coupled.” Cas seemed exasperated at Sam’s slowness to catch up.
Before he could consider further, Jack was snapped out of his thoughts by Dean’s voice directed at him. He hadn’t realised that the other two had finished their conversation.
Cas was with them. In the bunker. He was human, and as selfish as it made him feel to admit it, that meant he was the most accessible he’d probably ever been. So what more did Dean need?
His comfort. The ‘I love you’ he had been chanting over and over again in his head. What he thought had been harmless, he had been sending directly to Cas. He cursed himself inwardly for being so stupid.
“Seriously dude.” Sam walked in rubbing his face, phone in hand. He leaned back against a wall. “Are you sure you’re okay?” He asked with a kinder tone, stifling a yawn.
He cursed himself internally for being so easily flustered when it came to Cas. “You uh- you meant- you wanna?-'' He was cut off again as Cas stepped up into the very little space between them, his expression playful, yet slightly reserved. Dean let out a soft breath.
Before Jack could finish his sentence, Dean’s phone started ringing. He held up his hand gesturing for Jack to wait, as he stepped away and answered it. Meanwhile, Jack stayed in place; bubbling in his confusion and concern as the other man’s phone conversation droned on nearby.
“Right. That Lacey told us about. And I found this one that seemed kinda nice actually.” He quietened slightly by the end of the sentence, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. When he looked up he saw Cas smirking at him, which really wasn’t helping.
“Not even close,” Dean replied as he wiped a tear away from his eye. But as he responded he finally straightened up to look at Cas. Dean’s smug grin only further engraved the frown on the other man’s face. But he still couldn’t help a remaining chuckle or two continue to escape him.
“And as for your remarks, I understand you don’t mean any harm by them. And... I like that you’re a dick.”
Now, when they’d had that initial discussion he’d assumed his brother would figure it out on his own that day, or maybe the next. Within the week at the most.
-and Pictionary, and Monopoly, and Connect Four, and Uno, and everything else we’ve ever played.” He looked over at Cas. The suspicion which had been clouding Sam’s features had turned accusatory as he finished his sentence.
“So. What other times were you secretly in love with me?” He smirked at Castiel, raising his eyebrows.
“Whatcha think about dating?” Dean’s gulped and his eyes widened for a second as if he was surprised by his own question.
“Hah- That was just-  I mean can’t friends be a little jealous when their friends are hanging out with- other- friends?” Say friends one more time, he chastised himself internally.
“It wasn’t me! I-” At that Jack frowned over at him, slight annoyance, but mostly sympathy behind his widened sad eyes.
Sorry this took forever to get out! Uni finals were killinngg me, and not to mention I just couldn't get these last two chapters to a place I fully loved. I'm not sure how I feel about them now, but I hope yall like em at least xx
Deans eyes nearly bulged out of his skull. He sputtered an incoherent jumble of words before trying again. “You- you think we’re-.” He managed to choke out.
They also seemed to forget Jack and Sam were still sitting there with them at the map table. Sam pondered how he hadn’t thought through how insufferable they would be after they finally sorted their crap out.
Dean knew he should probably leave it there. But he wanted to keep pushing. He couldn’t stop himself, for some reason he felt bolder than usual in that moment.
“Hey... are you okay? You’ve been really out of it ever since we took down Chuck” Sam inquired, his brows furrowing, eyes knowing.
They’d saved the world again and returned to the open roads, the shitty motels, and killing the same monsters over and over… for the millionth time; it had begun to feel a bit monotonous, to say the least.
“I didn’t mean to- I’ve just been frustrated with-” Cas paused for a moment, as if contemplating whether to continue. He seemed to make up his mind, as he sighed and began to speak again.
“Things like friendship, family, love- it’s all a lot clearer. But it also is harder to ignore, or to explain away-" He took in a breath and looked over "The way we are with each other, for example... Do you understand?”
Dean could feel the potential panic simmering in the recesses of his mind. But he pushed it back and allowed himself the moment. If Cas was so certain, then Dean would choose to believe him. That’s all he really could do until they defeated Chuck and figured out how to make Cas human.
Dean chuckled to himself lightly, toying with a piece of paper in his hands as he walked out the door and up to the Impala.
“Dean, I know you must feel uncomfortable right now. You see me as a brother. And I would have kept this to myself if it weren’t for the curse but I-“
Sam held back a snort and pressed his lips together to keep from laughing at the phrasing. “Okay, so what were you thinking then?”
After their initial conversation - and the activities in the Impala which followed - Cas had insisted they talk to Sam and let him know about the change in their relationship. Dean had been a little less keen on the idea. Sam could figure it out himself. Why make a big deal out of it when it was still so new? Hell, he didn't even know how he'd describe their new- situation- in the first place.
All three men groaned out in pain and glanced around confusedly. After a few moments the couple looked up at Sam incredulously.
That argument had gone on for longer than he cared to admit. He’d presented reason after reason why it was a bad idea, and yet nothing stuck. Eventually, he’d given up.
Despite his best efforts to keep his expression neutral, Cas had seemed really happy when Dean finally approved of his new human life choices. So maybe it had been worth it.
“What? No buddy, it’s fine.” He huffed out a fake chuckle. “You deal with assholes and faulty machines all day. I get it. You wanna relax after that, not be stuck with me.”
Great. Surely Cas was gonna feel bad. He probably wouldn’t let Dean drive him to work anymore either.
The three dots reappeared immediately. Cas chuckled to himself again, attempting to hide it behind a cough this time for Sam’s benefit.
“In this moment. In all the mundane moments like this we’ve had and are going to have. I love you.” He didn’t smile, but as he spoke his eyes grew warmer.
Cas was an angel- Well he had been until recently. And while he seemed more in reach as a human, that didn't necessarily mean anything had changed. Hell, maybe it had made things worse.
Sam quirked a brow, looking between the two of them. Dean seemed anxious, however, Cas seemed to be beaming. So it couldn’t be anything too bad. He decided that meant it was okay to mess with Dean some more.
“I now understand your urgency about getting me out of this deal. And believe me Dean, I want out. But until we defeat Chuck and I become human, we have to be careful. I don’t- more than ever now, I don’t want to lose-“ Cas cut himself off.
He then glanced back at the blue eyes piercing through him in the mirror, illuminated by the moonlight.
“What were you two talking about?” Cas immediately questioned. He’d clearly been wondering for a while.
“Wait, no Dean- I was gonna say- Shouldn’t he get to pick when it is? Maybe there’s a day he’d prefer?” Sam internally patted himself on the back for that one.
Dean’s face straightened out. He looked up at a still silent Cas through the rearview mirror, before abruptly looking away.
Sam chuckled as he left. “Sweet dreams Dean” he replied in a deep voice, attempting to imitate a certain angel.
He was cut off by a sharp intake of breath. The girl looked wide eyed at him and then out the window of the store, tilting back her head. He realised she was looking at the Impala. When she looked back at him she was smiling.
“How are the prep-” Cas suddenly cut himself off and halted his steps. He stared down at the mess on the floor incredulously, before glancing up at Sam with an accusatory squint.
“What if we just talk to Jack? Keep Cas out of it. Just to keep him safe. It would be better if he doesn’t know, he could accidentally trigger the deal or something I don’t know.” Dean continued, sounding unconvinced.
Sam pinched his brows. The plan was taking a lot longer than expected and they were both starting to lose it slightly. However, he was glad to see that even he still had limits.
Dean’s heart rate quickened. He wasn’t completely sure what this meant but he had his suspicions. He hadn’t exactly been repressing how he felt about Cas lately. It was constantly in the forefront of his mind. But surely that was no danger to him. Wanting Cas around could be seen as friendly, longing didn’t have to mean anything more as far as Cas knew.
He couldn’t force Cas to follow through with the plan. He also couldn’t explain to him why he needed him to so badly.
“I’m not letting you guys abandon us on some beach in the middle of nowhere and drive off, or lock us in some port-a-loo, or- or- whatever it is you’re planning on doing.” Dean shook his head dramatically, he pointed at them as he did so.
Dean looked up at him like a deer in headlights, still unable to form sentences. He was certain hearts weren’t made to beat as fast as his was at that moment.
That snapped Dean out of his trance, his eyes snapping up, locking onto Castiel’s. They remained for a short time until Dean's gaze flickered away quickly, as if it were strenuous to keep looking.
If they had been on talking terms he would have texted Dean for advice. Maybe with a fish emoji. He always did make fun of Cas anytime he used one, but that made him smile for some reason.
Sam looked back at him with a deadpan expression. When Dean's hard expression didn’t waver, he sighed and began to walk away.
“Fine.” The silence broke as Billie finally walked up to Cas, coming to stand before him. She didn't bother looking at the others as she spoke. “We'll be back. Contact Amara, tell her to get here.”
The last time it had nearly killed him and he wouldn’t let it happen again, especially not because of him. He stared down at the table in front of him, refusing to meet Cas’ eyes.
“What are you doing?” Dean let out incredulously. He attempted to sound casual, but Sam’s still concerned look told him he hadn’t succeeded.
Sam’s eyes widened for a split second. His mouth threatened to turn up at the edges but he pressed his lips together just as quick.
Excitement fluttered in Dean’s chest. He smiled lightly to himself before looking up at Cas again. “It’s still your turn, you know.”
“Dean that makes no sense. If he’s really happy? And what do you mean something bad?” Sam frowned at him in confusion.
Dean looked up. Cas' voice may have been calm, but his expression was anything but. He looked… sad. Dean resisted the urge to cave.
“Yes I- Dean are you okay?” Cas searched his eyes worriedly. His concern at Dean’s wide-eyed and frozen expression was evident.
“- or whatever it is you’re planning on doing” Sam added on at the end as he began to make his way out.
Then Castiel looked back up, and the weight of that thought and the blue eyes upon him became too much. He backed away to the safety of his beer.
There was that feeling again. He watched as Cas scanned and bagged items for those waiting at the counter. He watched for a while, until something pulled at his chest. Something other than that warmth. This felt like a discomfort of sorts. A yearning. He couldn’t understand it, or name it beyond that.
“Yeah yeah, it’s all great. Now Sammy, you can find your own way to the motel.” Dean remarked, interrupting the positive back and forth.
“Seriously?” Dean gestured between himself and Cas, flailing his hands about in lieu of actually using his words.
“I was just wondering if it had anything to do with the store clerk-“ He paused for a moment. “The one whose number you did not keep.” He ended casually. He wasn’t sure what had prompted him to tack on that last detail.
“Well then what was I- actually okay- then what was Cas thinking about just then? Cas see if he gets it right.” Dean’s tone was defensive.
At that Dean huffed out a humourless laugh. It was an angry sound, but Sam could hear the underlying pain.
When he looked up again he saw Cas pulling a small rectangular gift-wrapped object out of his trenchcoat. He slowly lifted it up to Dean. He looked nervous.
“Right?” Dean huffed out incredulously. “Why are they parent trapping us-“ He paused suddenly. “Oh it’s this movie about-“
Dean sighed, going to take the seat next to Cas. However, he hesitated slightly, finally opting to leave one seat between them. The hesitation wasn’t missed by anyone in the room.
It was all too overwhelming. For years he’d pushed it all back, the way he felt around Cas. Locked it away and thrown away the key. Not because of his vessel. He- well- even Dean could inwardly admit he was a bit repressed. But, he’d been slowly realising over the course of the last few years, that all those “man crushes” were something more (damn you Dr Sexy). He’d filed away processing and dealing with that for some other time, when there wasn’t an apocalypse or some other end of the world scenario on their hands.
“Ah, it’s probably for the best you didn’t. I don’t think he’d handle the direct approach well here.” Sam pursed his lips slightly.
Dean huffed out a humourless laugh, before shaking his head and turning to Cas. He attempted a casual tone.
Dean put his beer down on the kitchen counter, glancing up at Castiel who’d just walked through the kitchen door. Dean shrugged in response.
“What if it is?” Dean replied. He attempted to maintain the sharp argumentative tone. However, the question came out softer than he had wanted. He inwardly cursed himself.
“Yeah, Sammy didn’t take it well. I told him though. We’re gonna find a way out of it.” Dean responded, straightening up.
A sudden rush of bravery overwhelmed him, he felt bolder. Perhaps it was actually seeing Cas upset that did it. After weeks of him speculating about how Cas was feeling, actually knowing. Cas was hurt, and it was because of Dean. He had to make it right.
“I just mean. Am I being too much? Overbearing? If I am, you can tell me. I get you probably have other things you want to be doing. And I’ll stop being such a dick about it all the time. Hell, if you babysit for Nora again I won’t even say a word, Scout’s honour.” Dean finished quickly.
Sam poked at his pizza for a moment before responding. He was also curious, and kind of wishing he’d gone with Jack's 'let’s follow them there and watch them from another table’ plan, as flimsy as it seemed.
“I’m sorry man. We just didn’t know what else to do. You guys have been dancing around it for so long and we just- We wanted to help.” Sam’s grin hadn’t lessened at all. He was practically giddy. Dean would’ve told him to cool it if he weren’t trying to butter him up for information.
“He managed alright, everything considered.” Sam shrugged before continuing “And besides what other choice does he have?”
“Hey, he kept the secret first. It’s only fair.”  Dean replied, defensive. He received only the patented Sam Winchester bitch face in response.
No matter what they did around him - bar certain things which would mentally scar Sam for life - he didn’t seem to react any differently. He’d shoot that same old annoying smirk at them, sure. But he’d always done that.
As footsteps interrupted his internal grumbling, he dropped his now empty beer bottle down on the table.
“This is- You’re joking right?” Dean asked, his voice strained. He looked like he was going to bolt out the motel room door. Or pass out.
Dean’s mind stopped spiralling. Snapping back into focus. Cas was still anxiously contemplating in his head, but right now Dean needed more help.
“I don’t think the Empty will be happy. But surely it can’t come after Jack with everything going on with Billie right now. So we should be alright there.” Sam continued energetically as if Dean hadn’t said anything.
“You know. Before he- before- “ he stumbled over his words in frustration. Letting out another sigh, this time harsher.
“I think I’ll stay, actually. I have some things to sort out back here.” His expression dared Sam to ask for an elaboration.
The car was silent for a while after that. Nothing but the sound of the engine droning on in the background of his thoughts.
“I wanted to say it properly. Face to face.” Dean responded. His throat was threatening to close up again, but he was determined to push through.
“All I’m saying is, his whole life can’t just revolve around us. He’s allowed to be his own person.” Sam held up a hand as Dean went to interject. “And- maybe you should consider how acting like this makes him feel.” He finished with a raised brow.
For a moment Dean was overcome with the urge to reach out and touch the other man’s face. Just to see his expression soften. As if he could caress the worry off of him.
When Dean looked back up Cas stared at him in slight confusion. Though Dean also thought he detected a flash of embarrassment pass over his expression. He wasn’t sure what that was about.
“I did work at that Gas’n’Sip for a while Dean.” Cas offered, clearly still confused by the line of questioning.
“Well, thanks I guess.” Dean smiled at him. “Still though, I’m gonna try harder buddy. As much as I hate to say it. Sam was probably right.”
“Maybe. But perhaps he just wants us all to spend more time together. We haven’t had a movie night or anything of the sort in a while. That may be why he was acting strange today.” Cas offered, sounding partially unconvinced, yet smiling lightly.
Dean looked up. A blue sea of emotions pierced right through him. His heart softened. He sighed. He was sure the pain was clear as day on his face. He was sure the rest of it was too. Everything he attempted to hide. It must’ve been.
“But, you encouraged me.” Cas frowned this time in confusion. His statement sounded like a question. A familiar head tilt framed his befuddlement.
Cas’ expression softened. He looked at Dean so adoringly it sort of made Sam’s heart melt. Finally, he looked over at Sam and spoke.
Jack only chuckled, never any less delighted at the tower falling. He removed the Jenga block from his food and placed it atop the rest of its fallen brethren. The pile of blocks was flanked by two piles of pizza boxes, with several empty beer bottles also littering the table – the latter mostly Dean’s doing.
“I said I love spending time with you. Not like.” Cas reiterated, raising a brow but otherwise staying expressionless before he turned away.
“Come on Jack let’s put this somewhere safe.” Sam gestured for Jack to follow him. He had grown tired of Dean’s perpetual moodiness about the plan many hours ago and needed an escape.
“Listen there’s definitely something there. But I don’t think either of them has realised it yet.” Sam smiled at him, shaking his head lightly.
“There’s something I’ve heard you say- think- a few times now. It’s been coming to me as a prayer, because of the-” he looked away. “Because of the longing attached to it. And I- I know it doesn’t make sense but I fear it may trigger the Empty deal. That’s why I’ve been avoiding you. To stop that from happening.”
“I did ask him if he was flirting with her, but not about Cas.” Jack considered for a moment. “Should I have?”
Before either could say more, the bunker door swung open loudly. Jack and Sam both bolted upright where they sat. Glancing at each other and the pizza boxes scattered over the table frantically.
“You don’t even know what songs I put on it yet,” Cas muttered back nervously. But the worried expression had left his face, he was sporting a shy smile.
He could just call Cas. Or just, walk up to him. He was pretty sure Cas was in the bunker library right now. But a part of him was hoping this way Cas wouldn’t hear his prayer and he could say he had tried at least. Dean seemed to have no such luck however. His door opened, and then closed.
He had been trying. Going on trips and outings in between or even during hunts with Jack and Cas. Sam too when he was around. They’d even taken to binging TV shows together, much to Dean’s surprise the kid and he had similar taste. Though if Sam ever found out about the Riverdale thing his life would be over. Dean shuddered at the idea; he’d never hear the end of it.
“Mindy? Why did she give you her number? Were you two flirting?” The disapproval in Jack’s tone did not go unnoticed.
He still couldn’t believe it at times. That Cas was back, Cas was okay. He’d taken to looking over at him regularly just to make sure he was still there.
Dean shook his head, laughing. God, he was so in love. He finally reached forward, placing a hand on the other man’s face. “I love you.” And with that, he leaned forward to meet his lips. Kissing him softly for a moment.
Dean finally tore his eyes away from Castiel’s hand. “Nothing. Nothing’s wrong. Just- I- Hungry.” He nodded quickly at him. It was unconvincing but Cas decided to let it go for the time being, only raising an eyebrow at Dean in response. He kept his hand where it was for a while longer.
“When you say feelings…” There was a question in Dean’s tone. He flicked his gaze around the car with uncertainty.
Sam rolled his eyes, but sheepishly so. Which meant Dean was right, it was definitely another hippie camp. Sam began to open his mouth, however closed it again when he noticed the shirts formally laid out on the bed.
He wasn’t sure what it was about Cas that got him so defensive. And he didn’t know why Sam pressed the matter so much.
Clearly, Cas should have been driving himself to and from work. It would probably be more of a convenience for him anyway than waiting around for Dean all the time.
In that moment Dean regretted having gone through with the whole ‘spitting in Sam’s smoothie’ plan the previous day.
He exited the Impala and locked the door. Before he could make his way up to the storefront away from the car, he glanced up to see Cas inside, through the store window. Cas didn’t notice him; otherwise preoccupied at the counter.
Though they still hadn’t gone on that beach vacation. Maybe a beach wedding could be arranged. He pondered to himself as Dean finally stopped coughing up a lung.
