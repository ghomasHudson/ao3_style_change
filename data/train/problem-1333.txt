Sherlock was stretched across her sofa, a book in his hands. John was sitting cross legged at the other end, facing Sherlock, one hand resting on Sherlock’s feet where they lay in his lap, the other arm resting on the back of the sofa. The lights were low, the fire popping and crackling merrily in the grate.
Unless John was mistaken, she underlined the note about trust issues.
“Suit yourself,” John huffed, undoing his shirt and turning his back on his friend.
The fire was glowing softly in its grate, the logs crackling and shifting every now and again. Its light was making John’s skin glow.
“You forget, John,” Sherlock said quietly. “That Anderson has given me more bruises than I care to remember, and Donovan encouraged him.”
John oscillated where he stood. If the teacher got close enough to see who he was, he was done for, but he couldn’t exactly just run away - but then there was a smash, like glass breaking, somewhere off to John’s right and in the split second the teacher was distracted, John’s feet took charge. He heard the teacher’s aborted shout behind him, but he was already squeezing his way down a small alley and around a corner and weaving between a small cluster of buildings. He came to a stop amongst some bins behind a building and tried to muffle his own harsh breathing in his sleeve. After a couple of minutes of silence that seemed to stretch into years, he was beginning to think he had perhaps given the teacher the slip when a shoe scuffed on the concrete and he startled - but it was only Sherlock.
“To give M fresh material to work with.” John watched Sherlock take out his phone and navigate to a direct message conversation with
Their breathing slowed. Another round of polite applause rippled through the afternoon. The bird was still singing.
– shifted in his bed in order to see out of the window at the sound of a car outside, and John continued to not know where to look. Mike sighed in exasperation and broke the silence. “Anyway, Sherlock, this is -”
As soon as the door clicked shut, John, who had been standing rigid as a board for the entire encounter, buried head in his hands.
Then, days later, “
Sherlock watched through the leaves as John and the rest of his section came to attention, bodies rigid and proud. At another command from the blond boy -
As he rambled on sourly, Dr Smith rounded the desk and John followed him into the waiting area, Sherlock behind. The man reached through the doorway of the small office and retrieved a coat.
“And if I don’t?”
“Sit down, boys,” Lestrade instructed, and the house obeyed. John looked up at Sherlock – he was drumming his fingers against the body of the violin. It was only then that John considered the possibility of Sherlock having stage fright – he’d never seen him perform in front of more than a handful of people, and Eric had sounded surprised when he had put Sherlock’s name down...
“What’s up, mate?” he asked discretely, during a brief break.
Sherlock shrugged, forcing his features into nonchalance. “There are easier ways to get money.”
, John was about to say. But he couldn't bring himself to lie. He sighed. “I just have nightmares a lot.”
Sherlock tried to focus and give the idea the careful thought John believed it deserved, but his concentration was slightly thrown off course by the way John’s arms looked as he was using the pestle.
“Ugh,” She groaned. “I’m gonna go lie down,”
As John crawled on his hands and knees across the cold earth towards the back fence of one of the houses he wondered how he got himself into the sorts of situations where he was required to do such things. Sherlock had said the crawling was necessary so that whoever was in the house – Sherlock had still neglected to say who exactly that was – would believe Sherlock was alone so he could distract them and John could slip in. He had also neglected to tell John what that distraction was going to be, and John was close to despair.
“Then I’m coming up,” John said, but -
John exhaled. “Fucking hell,” he whispered. “Was that you, that smash?”
“I won’t be having one, darling,” she replied. John frowned at her before remembering she was going to drive them home -
The peace didn’t last for very long, however, as John turned to him, eyes wide with mischief.
John felt his blood run cold. “Really? Should we not go, then? Find them? Are they on campus?”
John must have been able to see this on his face, because he laughed, the seriousness smoothed away.
Sherlock took another step, taking him to the edge of the ridge. He stepped off.
“No, Lottie, shit, honestly, I wasn’t-“ he laughed bitterly. Sherlock was never going to let him forget this. “Anyway, I wouldn’t want to. My sister, er, swings that way too, so that would be weird as fuck if I wanted to, you know…”
– and rang. And rang – “Sherlock?”
“You’re not excited? How can you not be excited?” John asked as he caught up with his friend who was beginning to walk towards the house.
“I didn’t know you play piano,” John said from the sofa.
His toes were cold, too. No socks. Didn’t John give him any of those? Obviously not.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, screwing the cap on his toothpaste. “Orally. Needless to say he thought it was something more recreational.”
, he tried to convince himself.
John ceased his search for his phone, and looked to the origin of the voice.
“Oh,” John said dumbly. “So he was where you got all your…” he waved his hand in a vague gesture, “…stuff,”
The droplet hung for a moment from his chin before falling to the desk, a burst of black against the bleached white of the paper.
He heard Sherlock pause in whatever he was doing. “John… have you got amnesia too? Can I do a blood test – no, better, can I take a urine sample so– ?”
“No, John - ” he heard Sherlock say, before a pale hand grasped the parcel, and suddenly, they were each trying to swat the other away while grappling for possession of the parcel, which was slowly disintegrating in the fray.
“What?”
“Sherlock Holmes.” Said the boy courteously, shaking John’s hand. “My condolences.”
“I don’t know man, we’ll see. I’ve got to go,” he said.
John’s handwriting.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows in scepticism.
“Rohypnol,” Sherlock replied. “Very high dose. So high it wasn’t strictly legal, but needs must.”
Breathe. In, and out. In, and out. He wasn’t going to panic. He was going to stand up straighter, he was going to go to Sherlock’s bed, drag down his duvet, and wrap it around his friend. He wasn’t going to worry when Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. He was going to go into the kitchen, treading quietly on the squeaky floorboards. He was not going to fall down the stairs. He was going to grip onto the banister until his knuckles turned white, but he was not going to trip.
“I needed that particular book to solve the final details of a minor case.” He said, lying back on his bed.
He needed to get John out of his head.
“Have you been in here before?” Sherlock asked.
[in which Mike buys an ice cream]
The bakery was small and cheerful, the smell of bread warming the air as they walked towards it.
“That’s true,” John agreed, for want of anything to say. “Hang on, act of god? It was you who sent him to prison.”
“Maybe,” Sherlock would reply. They would leave the conversation there, for the time being, John prodding him in the side and saying,
The girls at the door giggled. The one at the front of the group waved her wand and threatened, “We’ll turn your house into a tomato if you don’t give us all your sweets!”
Sherlock considered this for a moment. “Well, it is true.”
John laughed again, but it was less about humour and more about the bubbling, gleaming joy inside him needing to be released
It was an attic: there was nothing special about it, really, apart for the fact that it ran the entire length of the house. It was huge.
No-one apart from Sherlock, that is, but John wasn’t exactly over the moon about his roommate’s method, either.
John chuckled at something in the film. Sherlock pushed the sound from the television away and listened to the cars outside, some near, some far. It was a sound he was unused to, surrounded for most of his life by open fields and silent forests as he had been. There was the occasional scream of a siren and a shout, a dog barking and footsteps on the pavement outside.
, Sherlock told himself. Excused himself.
Sherlock’s response was to raise his eyebrows and cock his head slightly, his mouth pulling up into a smirk. John couldn’t help grinning despite shaking his head to himself as he clambered down and went to the window. He unlatched it, pushed it up and stepped away.
“Uh – ” John began, but was cut off by the door being thrown open again.
“I have to admit I was kind of surprised that Sherlock was so good,” Harry said.
The café was full, but not packed. The noise level was high enough that John couldn’t really ear any of the other customer’s conversations, and so didn’t think anyone could hear his and Sherlock’s. It felt like they were in a bubble.
“Yes. If he is found to be not taking his medication, and you will notice pretty quickly if he isn’t, or if you think he’s becoming intolerant, he’ll have to be – well.” Tom lowered his voice. “Just give me a ring, yeah?”
He looked up to search Sherlock’s face for confirmation, or denial, or anything, but his conscious thoughts instantly scattered in the afternoon breeze when he met Sherlock’s eyes. When had he got so close?
Victor. Sherlock wondered if he’d gone to jail yet.
They reached the counter.
- John and Sherlock are 16 going on 17 and therefore just starting their penultimate year of schooling (year 12/lower sixth). At the end of this academic year they will take national exams called AS exams which, combined with exams (A2 exams) they will take at the end of their final year of schooling (year 13/upper sixth), form their A Level results, with which they will apply to university if they choose to do so. (Again, this system has slightly changed IRL now, but this is how it works in this story.) NB: John and Sherlock attend a private boarding school, which just means that they have to pay to attend and that they live at school. Just in case that wasn't clear!
“Mhmm,” John replied, not believing him for one second.
“So everyone’s got to sing and dress up and that?” A thirteen-year-old called out from the back.
“Oh, I remember, alright,” said John.
John rubbed at his forehead and tried to look at Sherlock, but he avoided his gaze.
is the song Sherlock plays.
“Never heard of it, but sure,” John said, glad he had something to take his mind off the clock. “Two secs, though,” he said, turning back inside room twenty-one. “Sherlock, do you want to come and play a card game?”
“A very respectable third,” John replied. “If this were the Olympics, you’d’ve made it onto the podium!”
“That was stupid. You could have sent some to your family, or bought more tuck.”
Anderson put up his hands. “No need to get defensive, chill out.”
John snorted an incredulous laugh and opened his mouth to say something but before he could, the doorbell rang. He didn’t really want to argue with his roommate, so he let the matter drop and got up.
“Don’t be obtuse, John,” Sherlock huffed. “I believe it is said that gifts are all the more appreciated if hand-made, and you are very good at art, and painting especially is one of your fortes,”
The silence before the race was restless. The spectators were eager for the competition to end to be leave the heat of the building, the swimmers were tired, eager to remove their caps and lie down.
“Thank you for dinner, Mrs Watson, it was delicious,” Sherlock said as he entered the room.  “Would you like any help with the washing up?” he asked, to which John’s mother turned around with a look of pure surprise on her face.
John laughed, feeling all of a sudden as if he might cry. “It’s still two years away, Sherlock. We haven’t even got a flat yet.”
“No, that’s disg’sting,” she said, pushing feebly past him.
“I’m not interrogating someone for you, Sherlock.” He went back to his boot.
“All of this fur is making it impossible,” John commented. “It was easier on the Guinea pig because its fur was so much thinner and lighter, but this is so much denser.”
“I don’t want anything.”
“Two?”
“No, really, they were. It was good, I was good. But then they started getting worse again, in the last few weeks before school, before Bart’s. I knew you’d freak out if I said anything, and I could handle it anyway. I can handle it, Harry.”
“Here’s the thing: I’m not actually gay. Who knows about Sherlock bloody Holmes but what
“John Watson, if you buy your sister stilettos for her birthday, I will ban you from this household, do you hear me?” His mum ruled.
“You’ve never had a friend in your life, I’m the only person that’s ever come close to being your friend,” Victor hissed.
John turned away to begin changing out of his uniform, and so didn’t see the brief frown, the brief pursing of lips – the brief worry that passed over Sherlock’s face.
His teacher said something about going to print off a sheet and left the room, and John let out a small breath of relief. He took out his phone as chatter erupted around him.
“COME ON, SHERLOCK!” He yelled with what voice he had left.
While she had been talking, Sherlock had been rummaging through the drawer in Muhammad’s beside table, and now he straightened up. In his hand he held a large tub of something, and before John could ask what it was, Nadia explained.
“The funding,” Sherlock supplied, and there was an edge to his tone that John did not like.
John let his eyes fall closed.
With his mind more than sufficiently occupied, therefore, John found himself waking on the morning of the house rugby competition and remembering almost nothing of the previous few days.
After finding a seat, John got a glimpse of the field on the other side of the tracks – it was covered in snow, thick and untouched.
Sherlock kissed his teeth. “I would have replied by now.”
“Wow. That’s so cool.”
After a few moments of laboured breathing in silence, Sherlock said, “I’m glad you did that.”
Sherlock shrugged, unsure of what to say. John slapped him on the back and walked past him back into the living room. Sherlock grinned inwardly and followed.
“Please. I know nothing happened and you didn’t mean to, but please.”
“Yeah, sure,” John said, a little taken aback at Sherlock’s wording, taking out his phone and composing a text.
“Viola wants us to play something.”
“Come and at least get some house colours on you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock looked away. “Deduction, uh, didn’t play that large a role. Someone… mentioned a rumour about them in the comments on an... Instagram post. So, Bradstreet’s pets - ”
She gave Sherlock a tight smile as she walked past him and disappeared with the doctor.
“Technically, Glen
“No time for regrets now, John,” Sherlock dismissed, not breaking his stride. “Come on.”
The reply was instant this time.
“Mr Holmes.”
“During some of your free time, such as free periods and lunch breaks, you now have the opportunity to work with various departments of our school, as interns. It is an informal apprenticeship system which has worked very well in the past. The way it works is simple. You choose an area of the school that you are interested in, or you think you might pursue a career in when you leave school, and 'work' there until the end of the academic year.
During his free period that morning, John carefully tore the four pages that made up his house art entry out of his sketchbook and laid them on the floor of room twenty-one.
“Yeah, bye, Mike,” John replied, continuing down the lower sixth corridor to room twenty-one.
John nodded, grinning. “We should make the pumpkin look like a punk…”
“If you insist…” He heard Sherlock turning on his Bunsen burner, then the clinking of metal on glass. “She’s in upper sixth, obviously; ginger, obviously; takes English, French, and drama, obviously; but isn’t quite as smart as she thinks she is, obviously.”
Sherlock’s answer made a small but potent wave of worry roll through him. “I don’t know.”
“Unless you want a lap dance, that is. That’d get me the extra point five, right?” John grinned as Sherlock swallowed.
“Well, what now?” Anderson asked after a few moments of silence.
“Excuse me,” John said to the secretary, and his voice was calm, betraying no coarseness, unlike those of the bullies Sherlock had known. “Please may I ring my mum? If I’m staying for detention, she’ll need to know where I am,”
“And the Co-Op.”
“I was asking out of interest,” she insisted. “But also I can’t go to the supermarket today like I was hoping because I have to cover Elaine, she’s come down with something nasty. Could you go, John? The list’s on the fridge.”
“Ugh, okay,” John said, after he had relapsed back into silence again for a few minutes. “I’m done with this one, it’s good enough for now.”
“Thank you, thank you very much,” he quipped, grinning. The clapping died down and John turned back to his lunch. Sherlock scowled at him, but went on to steal most of John’s chips and even half a biscuit before the meal was done.
The others agreed.
The walk back to Doyle was unpleasant. The sub-zero air chilled him to the bone, and he wished he’d dried his hair a little more.
John and Sherlock hid in their room for the rest of the day. Or, John felt like he was hiding. Even the few Doyle boys they had encountered on their way upstairs had given them looks and asked about God. John didn’t dare to look at his Instagram notifications. It felt like the whole world was demanding answers from him - from them. Asking how God had been kidnapped, by whom, for what purpose. At least in room twenty-one, John could turn his phone off and close the door and try to wait for something - anything - else to catch their attention.
“What the fuck was that?” he hissed.
“Don’t tell Mycroft,” Sherlock said after a pause.
“Because this time, you’re going into the world of the upper classes, John, and you must uphold the honour of the Watson name,” she said, and John couldn’t tell if she was joking or not. She fiddled with the lapels on his blazer. “This really fits you so well, you look very handsome.”
“All right then. Shall we?”
Angelo wrung his hands, a gesture almost comical in his thick limbs. “Can we go somewhere private, please?”
“Oh, he’s been fine. He’s a big boy, he can handle a bit of debate on the internet. No, it’s
“Wait, you touched him?” John asked. “Did you feel his pulse?”
“You’re an
In truth, Sherlock did know. He had spent so many nights sitting within himself, mind on the stairs of his palace, body on the stairs of his home, while people downstairs pointedly refused to shout. It had begun as something voluntary, but at some point, it had stopped being completely under his control. Around the time his father left and Mycroft began needing those little pastel pills, he thought.
“Are you sure that’s a good – ?”
“What I said earlier, about him looking more and more deathly – I wasn’t exaggerating. Sometimes he wouldn’t come down from his hole for days, and when he finally did, it was like watching a corpse trying to convince you it was alive. His skin was so pale… I can’t think of any way to describe it apart from wet paper. He was so fucking thin, John. In the summer, I could count every rib and every vertebra through his school shirt. When we broke up for the summer holidays, I hoped beyond hope that when we came back for year eleven, he would be better, that his family would sort him out at home, that the sun would give him strength - because it was clear as hell that he was ill.
“Hold still, this might sting a bit, it’s got alcohol in it.”
The girls nodded vigorously, leaning in close. “I killed his parrot,” John stage-whispered. “He was going to feed me to the sea monster he keeps in the bathtub as punishment but I managed to convince him to make me do this instead.”
The boy nodded.
, as he settled in with Sarah – fingers entwined – next to him. The chatter of the room was like a massage to his aching head; meaningless, unintelligible, not fraught with stress, not talk of cases and Latin and experiments and there was not a tall, skinny, boy-detective in sight.
John was interrupted by a huge cheer as he opened the door and they stepped over the threshold.
He had no idea where this wave of self-loathing had come from - the part of him that stood, looking on, in the doorway of his mind palace, was shaking its head.
John spluttered a surprised laugh at that last one, not thinking about the way his cheeks suddenly felt warm. “How do you know that?”
It turned out that it wasn’t John’s imagination; the car stopped where a bus would, the driver winding down their window.
“Whew, that was close, eh?”
“It was an elderly man, maybe late sixties, and he was dead. His eyes were still open. Later on I found out that he’d died instantly on impact. Snapped his neck.
Sherlock nodded, forced himself to loosen his grip on the metal bars of John’s bed.
“Nothing?” John asked. Sherlock shook his head. “Good, because we wouldn’t want to spoil your appetite.”
“I’m – ” he began, but John cut him off.
Some time later, John had finished mopping the ward and had moved onto the reception area, and his and Jamie’s conversation turned to the ball.
“Hmm?” said John.
he thought.
Sherlock looked at John. There was genuine worry there; it reached his eyes, was in the purse of his lips, in his body language. “No. He’s a coward. A psychopath, but a coward.” John looked back at Victor. “John. Don’t worry about him.”
Sherlock gave him a look as if to say,
John laughed, the sound loud in the darkness. After a moment, Sherlock resurfaced, taking an audible lungful of air and pushing his hair back from where it had stuck to his forehead.
“Are you telling me that wasn’t a social situation?”
“It’s just going to go to waste,” Sherlock pressed as John sunk his teeth into his sandwich.
“Yes! One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, yeah? Like that.” John swung his arms and stamped his feet in time with the numerical chant and Sherlock reluctantly copied. “No, no, no, put a bit of elbow grease in, man!”
Sherlock groaned. “Oh, god,” he agonised. John laughed.
“That’s what you think,” Eric replied.
Smith’s face darkened. “Are you telling me how to run my surgery?”
“How about breakfast this morning? Lunch?” John asked, trying to keep his voice neutral.
John sat on his desk and waited, tapping his phone against his thigh, the rhythm beating out his agitation.
“I’ll interfere all I want if it gets you to be a slightly more tolerable person to work with.”
John had that expression that seemed to occupy his face a lot of the time. Angry and worried. Sherlock really had done something wrong. “I... I apologise, John.”

Two minutes later, Sherlock let John try to play the song by himself. He watched as John sang quietly to himself.
“I mean, if you’re going to keep pretending to like her, this might be a bit of a dealbreaker. Going to the ball with her would show her that you actually give a shit about her,”
He kicked off his shoes and removed his blazer, loosening his tie. He hated ties. Clambered onto his bed. Just to close his eyes. Just for a moment, just to rest.
“Oh, no, it’s just – you’re Sherlock Holmes’ roommate,” Jamie explained. “People know him, so they know you.”
“Agreed,” said Sherlock. He glanced in a shop window. “They’re just coming out of the side street now.”
John wasn’t sure how to get the moment back, if Sherlock even wanted that moment back. John himself
“Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?” John said slowly, feeling a grin pulling at his mouth.
“It’s boring up here.”
“Same,” John agreed. “Which is why Mary barely ever came ‘round here,”
“But that’s only the half of it – what about the rest? It makes you out to be some sort of super genius.”
“That’s
“Why?”
“I’ve got an extension lead in the top drawer of my desk.”
John exhaled. "Okay. Good." And then he realised Sherlock had called her Lottie instead of Charlotte, and something about that small loss of formality made John smile.
Sherlock smiled at him, and before John could stop him, walked purposefully back into the ward. John could only hope he was going to be civil, because he could do nothing as he heard the door to the building open again.
Someone pushed past them, and Sherlock remembered that they were standing in the kids’ colouring book section of a stationery shop. He blinked and shifted, drawing his gaze up to that of his father.
“He’s got my mother’s maiden name. Moriarty.”
John nodded, thinking. “I don’t know,” he began haltingly, worrying what he was about to say would sound moronic. “It’s almost like we were tipped off, or something,” Sherlock was looking at him, but John couldn’t read anything in his expression. Emboldened by the fact that Sherlock hadn’t dismissed him, he continued cautiously. “We never found Mrs Turner’s necklace, so maybe someone stole it to draw our attention to the family. And someone obviously sent us those earrings to draw us to Nadia… I wonder who it is. They should get some credit for helping, at least…” he trailed off, so deep in thought that he didn’t realise Sherlock had stopped walking until he heard a small “Oh,” from behind him.
“No. No, listen,” John said, and the stern edge to his voice made Sherlock turn to him, eyes wide. “I need to apologise properly. What you said - what you offered - was the most anyone has ever offered me in my entire life.”
– ” Tom looked at Sherlock. “ – that he takes his medicine at the same time every twenty-four hours. To keep him from, uh, regressing into his untreated state.”
He didn’t know which one would have made his heart sink a little less.
“Sir, we, uh – ” Anderson stuttered, but Sherlock got to his feet and took a step towards the man in one swift movement.
They lay, looking up at the cream of Sherlock’s bedroom ceiling as Mars, Bringer of War, trampled through the room.
“Yes, it is.” He agreed.
John exhaled again. He forced his muscles to unclench. First, his fists. Then his shoulders, his chest, his legs, his feet. Only then did he notice that a light was on in room twenty-one. He propped himself up on his elbows and peered over the railings of his bed.
Just before John served the dinner he sent a quick text to Sherlock.
“Jo!”
Sherlock could feel John recovering, as his steps grew surer and the weight around Sherlock’s neck grew lighter. But the arm remained, as did Sherlock’s.
“No wonder Lestrade has a reputation for being the best housemaster in the school,” mused Sherlock pointedly, mouth full of something he’d retrieved from amongst the bugs. “If you’re already valuing him enough to put in your sketchbook.”
“Then we’ll have something concrete,” John finished, and Sherlock nodded. They both began examining the other animals.
Sherlock felt a burst of adrenaline surge into his blood, and he had to force himself not to run.
– but the name that had tumbled out had not been the one he was expecting, and now the deed was done, irredactable.
“Do you think I could walk on the ice?” John asked, lifting a foot.
“I looked back at the road and there was a pair of headlights rushing at us and dad was shouting at me to turn, for fuck’s sake, turn, and I just sat there. He leant over and tried to turn the wheel himself but the other car was too close and I could hear it’s engines and see the other driver, and they were trying to swerve as well but it was too late and I remember thinking, ‘I’m going to die.’
“God, mum, that’s so naff.”
There was an old fashioned, double-hung window in the wall opposite the door, just under which was a mini-fridge. The left and right sides of the room were symmetrical: there was an elevated bed against each wall, a desk underneath, with an adjustable lamp and a plastic chair to boot. There was a wardrobe and a chest of drawers against the walls at the end of the beds. All the furniture was made out of generic-looking, lightly coloured wood - apart from the bed, which was constructed from unfriendly metal. The rooms also looked as if a bomb had gone off in there, but John barely had time to register this before Mike said,
“What?”
. He turned back to his book with a chuckle.
He pulled the door of the ensuite bathroom to behind him and caught a sight of himself in the mirror – eyes still half-closed and hair mussed. After having attended to the call of nature, he splashed his face with water, feeling his brain begin to reboot. Memories of the previous night began to resurface as he leant against the sink – Sherlock speaking French, the fireworks, the garden, dancing in the middle of all those guests, his waltz. He felt a smile tug at his lips.
John laughed, a little confused. “What for?”
“Want me to punch you as well?”
Sherlock looked back up. “Just a little.”
A dark-haired figure was lying next to the old oak tree, a red pool gathering under its curls.
“Mum, I – ”
“What kind of motivation could there possibly be to kill a kid?” Muhammad hissed.
“So. What now?” Sherlock asked.
“You heard the man, I won the bet!”
The house was silent.
Neither boy said anything for a moment. The words made the air thick. John could feel Sherlock’s chest rising and falling rapidly under his hand, which was still gripping onto the front of his shirt. John looked at his hand, at his white knuckles, and forced himself to let go.
A pause. Then, John dared, “Did you… you know? When you went to her room.”
“Morning, Louis,” John greeted him as he continued to pull Sherlock from the bed by his legs, resisting Sherlock’s struggles and muttered curses. “Do you want to help?”
“Why do you have a gun, anyway? And how have you managed to keep it hidden from me this entire time?”
The door to the san. Opening. A person wearing heeled shoes walking down the corridor. She had a long stride, graceful. She and John exchanged a few sentences, and Sherlock could hear something in John’s voice, a friendliness, a joviality not entirely appropriate.
“John, all the swearing is not necessary,”
But what was more urgent was the sudden need to ask,
The bed was just as comfortable as it had looked, and the duvet was light and thick, making John feel as if he were lying in a cloud, a thought which he articulated to Sherlock, earning him a low laugh.
And Sherlock began to dance. John stood, frozen in confusion, until Sherlock kicked him. He tried to work out what Sherlock was doing. Luckily, it was nothing too technical: Sherlock was simply moving his feet so as to make them sway to the music. John copied him, trying to fit his feet into the spaces where Sherlock’s weren’t, and they began to turn very slowly on the spot.
“Don’t call me that, I do not belong to you,” Sherlock replied, twisting out of the other boy’s grip.
John whipped around to see Mycroft standing in the doorway.
“We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to,” he said, and Sherlock almost couldn’t look at the compassion in his eyes. “I just thought it could be a bit of fun.”
About half an hour later, Sherlock abruptly stood up, making John jump. He put on a long, black, billowing coat and strode across the room. John looked up.
“We’re underage now!” John replied, and Eric cocked his head briefly as if to say
John swallowed and stepped, and then they were moving. Sherlock murmured instructions into John’s ear, sometimes whispering, “
“Yes?” his friend replied from below.
That Sunday, John had, like every Sunday, invited Sherlock to go into town with him, except this Sunday, he had accepted. The look of shock on his friend’s face had made Sherlock laugh.
It was dark in Mycroft’s room, and too tidy. Ever since Mycroft had turned into a teenager, he’d been pretending to be daddy more and more every day. He wasn’t like daddy tonight, though. Tonight he was bent over in his bed, duvet in a ball to one side, rocking backwards and forwards, and breathing too fast. “Mum, I-”
“No, I’m fine,” Sherlock said shortly. John watched him struggle with one of the buckles for about thirty seconds before sliding off the bench and crouching in front of his friend. “No, John, I’m – ”
“Damn,” said John, and pushed away the sudden memory of Jamie’s shirtless torso on stage during the house singing competition.
After a moment, John resumed, brightness forced, “I didn’t invite you over so we could mope, let’s – "
John pretended to be weighing up the situation very carefully and Mike and the others clasped their hands in a begging gesture at him. John grinned.
Sherlock could feel himself grinning. The sight was simply funny – John in his mother’s bright pink washing-up gloves, all five feet and five inches of him irate and stabbing a pink, rubbered finger at his chest, soap suds dripping off said finger onto the kitchen floor.
“We don’t even know your name, dear. Stay for dinner, at least,” Mrs Hudson reasoned, putting a hand on his arm.
“He was smiling, so I don’t think it’s bad news,” Harry reasoned. “Are you coming?”
When John turned away, Sherlock realised neither had smiled at the other, nor waved, nor even nodded. But they didn’t have to.
John was laughing, along with Mrs Hudson, at Sherlock’s mortified expression, so he couldn’t answer for a moment. “Because it was funny.”
“Making his mohican more visible.”
“Cheers!”
John came to a junction and had to choose to either go right, to the science block, or left, to the playing fields and woods, and, eventually, Victor’s house – what if Victor had come back somehow? The thought made John’s throat clench.
He turned to Sherlock. He opened his mouth to say something, but the sight of Sherlock holding in his laughter, lips pursed and eyes watering, dissolved all of his self control. He collapsed, putting a hand over his mouth so stifle his laughter. Sherlock spluttered and tried to control himself, but failed, which made John laugh even harder, Sherlock’s wheezing chortling joining his own. John put his glass of water down on his bedside table so he could sit down on the floor and put his head in both his hands. He heard Sherlock join him.
John tried his hardest to remember what he had learnt in GCSE French, but
[in which there is Cards Against Humanity]
) and by the slight stain (
“Viola’s started to get antsy about the canapés,” Sherlock sighed, and John couldn’t help but snort a laugh at that.
John hadn’t told Sherlock that he was still wearing the bobble hat. Mrs Hudson hadn’t questioned it, but it was only when Viola asked her nephew to pass the salt that she seemed to notice it for the first time.
“Disappointed? I’m bloody ecstatic!” John said, a little too loudly, earning him a few frowns from those around them. “Would you look at that,” he said, holding out his certificate.
“What happened?”
The whistle blew, signifying the end of the first half, and Sherlock saw John put his hands on his knees and hang his head.
“He seemed it.” She took a sip from her mug. “He looked a bit ill. Didn’t eat much.”
“No – no-one in particular,” Mike said. “I was just messing about.”
As he marched down the passage John didn’t know what there was. He knew the case had pushed Sherlock, but he didn’t realise how far. The thought of him relapsing had never crossed his mind. John had thought he’d been clean. Apart from when he’d turned up at his house over the holiday. And then in his kitchen –
“So could you,” Sherlock retaliated. “You’ll look like a pre-teen if it gets any longer.”
“Yes, John, mud!” He pocketed the box. “See here; the scuff mark is from Muhammad’s school shoe – left, I think, but that doesn’t matter – and while that one is the most noticeable, there are others, here, here, and – ” he pointed to various tiny marks on the floor. “ – here. Signs of a struggle. I know your brother, I’ve seen him around,” he said to Nadia, who didn’t look entirely convinced. “He’s a slight boy, with light footsteps, the kind of person to never leave a scuff mark unless he was running with quite some momentum, or – ” Sherlock pushed the heel of his shoe away from him, leaving a black smudge behind. “He was digging his heels into the floor, resisting something. Someone had to drag him out of this room.”
“Oh,” John said dumbly. “I always assumed you weren’t that much younger than me.”
John lay looking at the ceiling for a moment. He was about to reach over and turn off the lamp on his bedside table when there was a rustling from the fort on the floor and the sound of small feet on the carpet. He sat up to see Louis clambering onto the bed.
John was wrenched out of his own slumber by a wet choking sound from Sherlock’s bed. His bleary eyes snapped open to the sight of his friend hunched in his bed, lower body still ensconced in the duvet, and John all but leapt from his ladder to Sherlock’s.
, Sherlock?” he shouted.
“Nah, Sarah’s pretty chilled, you wait and see,” John went back to fidgeting with his appearance in the mirror. Simple as that.
John tried not to smile. “Oh, he’s not going. Says it would ruin his reputation, or something.”
“And how, exactly, am I supposed to do that? I’m in trouble already for not showing up – you know if you don’t attend every practise, they drop you from the squad?”
“Go on,” Mrs Watson said, smiling at him. “We’ll be right behind you.”
The thin bones beneath his hands.
He had sifted through almost everything in his mind palace and still nothing on the case. It was infuriating. Boxes lay upturned, cupboard doors flung wide, books strewn across the floors. Nothing.
“Yeah, it was!” John exclaimed triumphantly, turning to float on his back, breathing heavily. He saw Sherlock copy him out of the corner of his eye.
John was doing his laundry when Sherlock came to find him after lunch the next day.
“Never better,” Sherlock said. When John gave him a stern look, he gave in. “Head hurts a little.”
“What’re you looking at?” John asked.
“Hi, I’m John Watson,” John began.
“I know, I know. I’m sorry. I just didn’t want to worry you and mum.”
Muhammad sighed and pursed his lips. “That’s…”
John grinned. “I couldn’t help it. Listen – they’re being so quiet now,”
“It’s fine, John,” Sherlock said, and his voice betrayed no emotion. “Really.” He went to his wardrobe and began undressing. John turned away and, for want of anything to do, did the same. “It was just a thought. I understand that you would want to return to your family after so long away from them.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and got up from the table to put the hat away.
“Yeah,”
“Christ… when?”
By the time the bell rang for lunch, John was feeling positively neutral. He lay down his pen and tidied away his revision, looking around for Sherlock. He was nowhere to be seen, so John gathered his things and left the library - and walked straight into the brick wall of Angelo de Luca.
“Around Christmas time, he stopped going to meals. In the spring term, he sometimes literally went weeks without uttering a single word. Then came the late-night violin concertos and the absences from lessons that he refused to explain. And that's when the teachers began to notice, but they just gave him detention upon detention and never asked any questions. Our house master then was a real evil piece of shit, nothing like Lestrade. So no-one did anything.
“Why?”
The toothpaste and smudged glasses and coat sleeves said that the man was pretty careless about his appearance, and he had a nervous habit of biting his nails and… and… and that was all John could get.
“Do you think the bakery will be open by now?”
John shrugged, holding the door open for Sherlock. “I actually think it’s quite nice,”
Sherlock nodded and tried to put the way John’s face fell out of his mind.
“We can save some for lunch tomorrow,“ she trailed off, attention caught by the shrill doorbell.
So it was only logical he slipped through the window. Took off his coat and shoes. Walked to the bathroom.
“Well?” Harry persisted. John watched his mum’s eyes crinkle over the top of her mug and fixed his sister with a smirk of his own.
They sat together at breakfast. John was surprsingly hungry, but Sherlock just pushed his cereal about in its bowl half-heartedly until it became soggy, only eating a few mouthfuls. John didn’t say anything, but noted it.
“Well?” John said, taking his socks off.
John raised his eyebrows briefly and pursed his lips. “She said you were a psychopath.”
Sherlock knew he shouldn’t have, but he couldn’t help feeling smug in the old man’s discomfort.
John and Sherlock wandered slowly around the hall looking at the other pieces. They were arranged by medium, and when they got to the section that contained John’s piece, it was almost a shock to see it again. A few other people were looking at it, and Sherlock suddenly realised that they were looking at him – indirectly, but they were looking at him. Sherlock wondered if they knew.
, John, really?”
?” John asked incredulously, realising what Sherlock was saying.
, was another.
“Hey, Sherlock, where are you?”
“It’s not for me,” John hastily explained. “My roommate sent me instead of getting off his lazy arse and coming to get it himself."
Molly turned around to John.
John felt his eyebrows rise – he was usually barred from getting involved, or
There was his mother, with his sister beside her, watching his train leave the platform. His mum forcing a smile, waving. His sister, fixedly not looking at their mum beside her, stood tall and proud, fixing John with the look she reserved for times when they both had to endure something terrible. Stoic. That was the word their father had described her as, as they stood by his bedside. It was a noble attempt at humour in the darkest hour of all their lives. That look had first surfaced then.
They came to a gentle hill. The small incline wouldn’t have been a challenge if it weren’t for the snow: as it was, by the time they’d reached its summit, both boys were panting, bodies hot from the exertion inside their thick coats.
“I’m just not sure that running is the best idea,” Sherlock insisted.
He took out his phone and sent Sherlock a text.
John followed Sherlock upstairs with heavy feet.
“Just trying to imagine what Sherlock would have looked like back then,” John grinned.
John brought up YouTube on Sherlock’s laptop, searched for and found what he was looking for, and clicked the thumbnail.
“Boys aren’t really my area either,” Sherlock said, narrowing his eyes.
“No, listen, Nadia,” John implored. “We’ll tell you everything after we do something about your brother. I’m really sorry, but that’s all I can offer you by way of explanation right… now… Sherlock, what are you doing?”
There was a poster blu-tacked onto the door of the house – there were several, but the one that caught John’s eye was headed by the words ‘ART COMPETITION’ and nearly distracted him enough to stop him in his tracks. Nearly.
“Let’s decide nearer the time, okay?” she said.
When he thought of John, he thought of quiet moments. Smiles. Nights too late and mornings too early to speak. Their feet pounding against the concrete, in time like a drum beat. Thoughts clicking into place in the air between them, shared synapses. Blue eyes. Warmth. Trust. That was something he had never been able to get his head around. Just how much John trusted him. He had seen him when his rationality had fled and left him shivering in his memories. He had seen him in fits of laughter, tears of pure joy in his eyes. He had heard him singing, had heard him shouting, had heard him crying. Trust was something Sherlock had always struggled with. He never knew how anyone could place their being in another’s hands, when hands were made to crush. But he thought he was beginning to learn.
“See? I told you,” Mrs Watson said proudly.
“Sorry?”
John grinned. “Like a log.”
John was once again left alone in the silence of room twenty-one. His phone vibrated with a text - his mother reminding him of their arrival time on Saturday, and John realised they would be there in less than twenty-four hours. He looked around the room and suddenly saw the chaos he had been living in. He supposed he should use the time while Sherlock was being interrogated to begin packing to go home. M or no M, his mother would expect him to be ready on time and with a clean room.
Sherlock unscrewed the cap of the milk –
,” he gasped, having found a picture of Sherlock and Mycroft when Sherlock was around nine. They were at a wedding, dressed in matching suits and hats, flowers in their buttonholes. “You were so cute, look how angry you were!”
Sherlock nodded. “I’ll bear that in mind.”
Sherlock nodded. Coughed. Straightened his blazer. John looked back to Angelo. He wanted to knee him between the legs for good measure, but unclenched his fists and tried to settle himself.
“I think so.” Harry came over to him and looked at him.
“Yeah,” John said. “Bye.”
“And it’s your birthday next week, isn’t it?” She looked up, smiling.
Mummy kept telling him to breathe with her, whatever that meant, and kept counting. Sherlock wasn’t sure that was necessary – Mycroft was sixteen now, he definitely knew how to count. Maybe he’d forgotten how and that was why he was so upset.
“Why should I?” Sherlock replied to Mycroft.
“Yes, of course, but – ”
“Mmm,” Sherlock answered, rubbing his eyes. His voice was even deeper than usual, rumbling with disuse. “I can’t remember the last time I agreed to that question. I feel like I’ve slept for centuries.”
“Hey, no, let me reply,” John said as Sherlock began tapping out a message.
“What?” Sherlock said suspiciously.
“You again.”
“I’ve had a thought,” John said.
The walk to the village was long and treacherous, the snow hiding black ice on the roads and uneven ground on the grass verges.
“Look who it is,” sneered Anderson. “Hello, lover boys.”
Her footsteps were heavy on the stairs. John stood very still. He had not improved his skills of ‘acting natural’ since the time they’d stolen all of those art supplies. Sherlock didn’t bother with pretending, as he knew she’d turn left at the foot of the stairs, heading towards the front door, away from the kitchen.
John tried not to let his surprise show on his face. Since Angelo had helped John when he had been injured in the Boscombe rugby match at the end of the winter term, they had stopped giving each other dirty looks across the quadrangle, but the crack of Angelo’s nose under John’s fist and the ringing echo of Angelo’s slurs against John’s back were still loud in the background of John’s stunned silence. “Uh. About what?”
Then there was a picture, of the present John had sent Sherlock, out of the brown paper and sitting underneath a Christmas tree, surrounded by other presents.
“Was I sleeping?”
“Nice to see you too.”
“I’m still on the roof.”
Sherlock smiled a small smile. “I already know.”
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Sherlock replied. “So, what makes you prefer Herbal Essences to Lynx - or did your mum send you your sister’s shampoo by mistake?”
There are trains to London every forty minutes, a taxi to the station takes fifteen, plus ten to come, so if I… should I text Harry? What if –
John, of course, ordered a hot chocolate, and Sherlock took tea, and they both sat at one of the tables by the window.
Sherlock did win the lower sixth prize for achievement in chemistry. The applause that followed was polite but John could not mistake the murmur that went through the students as they watched Sherlock stride across the stage and shake the headmaster’s hand.
“Amnesia. Interesting.” Sherlock mused, before turning suddenly and striding back into the ward. John cursed under his breath, and, as always, followed.
After a moment of surprise, Sherlock hesitantly put his own arms around John’s back, and when he felt John only shift himself to be more comfortable, tightened them, pulling John to him.
He looked back to the deep end, and Sherlock was already crouched atop the starting block, watching Karim closely. The rest of Doyle’s swimmers had gathered behind him, the team captain, Karim, leant over the edge of the pool, screaming at Harry and beckoning him.
The last race of the competition was the senior medley relay. John had to ask Mike what that meant.
“She was a nice girl.”
“Yes! Yes, you are a good person.”
“Oh, about an hour and a half, maybe two.”
(who you may recognise from such beautiful fan art as
John snorted. “What did you say?”
“I… I don’t… I’m so sorry – ”
“Thanks, sir,” John replied, catching it. It was heavier than he was expecting, and floppy.
Sherlock watched as John’s fingers tapped out a message. He’d never really thought about hands as a concept before, because
“Never have I ever had sex with her parents in the next room.” Mike, John.
“Why’d you end it?”
I just wanted to say a massive THANK YOU to everyone who has read and commented and left kudos and just wow, I did not expect so many people to be so lovely. I'm sorry about sporadic updates, but 'tis a busy year and I am a procrastinator. So, yes; thank you, thank you, thank you for all your support - you are all such wonderful people and I hope to be seeing you soon x
A tingling in his right arm where it was trapped beneath him.
They began walking again, silent for a little while.
Skin, shirt, skin.
“Harry’s my sister.”
John was sitting in his therapist’s office. It was the first official Sunday of term.
John couldn’t see Sherlock’s expression but his voice when he next spoke was closed off. “You don’t believe me.”
“Wish I could, Sherlock,” John sighed. “Seriously, I wish I could, but this is due first thing tomorrow and I’ve still got another four hundred words to write.”
“No,” John gasped, like a salacious housewife. “This is your first ever sleepover?”
getting you this for Christmas,” he said, reaching up and swiping the thing off Sherlock’s head.
“Yes,” Anderson insisted. When John only looked at him, Anderson said, “I know guys miss things, and I’ve missed things before, but this time I’m certain.”
It wasn’t a question, because John knew it was true.
“Oh, shit,” he mumbled thickly, his mouth full. He scrambled to his feet. “Where are the sweets?” He swallowed prematurely, making his throat hurt, and ran into the kitchen. They were nowhere to be found, and he became more and more frantic until –
Doctor Hope, after a moment, cleared his throat. “Bless you, Holmes.”
“Mm,” John hummed. “How come he didn’t get kicked out?”
“I think – yeah, I think…” the boy said, walking out of the kitchen and back into the common room.
The moment of confession was lost. Another time, perhaps.
John nodded.
The room suddenly felt very big.
They watched Muhammad for a while, John smiling as the boy’s eyes welled up with tears but his mouth continued grinning. He looked at Sherlock and there was a barely-detectable softness to his gaze, a small upturn to his mouth, that made John forgive him without even knowing what for.
,” John sang. “
“Yeah, yeah, merry whatever,” John yawned. “Can I have five more minutes?”
“Did he offer you money to spy on me?”
John was ready to leave the house an hour before he had to. He bumped his suitcase down the stairs and left it in the hallway, before wandering aimlessly into the kitchen and getting himself a glass of water.
“I heard you.”
“Dismal weather,” he murmured by way of greeting.
John could see that, as the year nine, now barely recognisable, was being carried on the shoulders of two upper sixth around the room.
“Oh, shut up, Sherlock,” John said.
All three sank into the sofa. Now that the curtains had been opened and the lights had been turned on, the room seemed a lot more inviting.
“Nobody’s even paying attention,” Mrs Watson said, and Harry had her hand over her mouth, and Sherlock realised the woman was right. The coaches of both teams had their full attention on their teams and the action that was steadily moving further and further away from John. The players’ eyes flicked back to John, but they had more important things on their minds. The crowd nearest to John seemed to be talking to Angelo, but the rest of the spectators were focused on the game.
Sherlock accepted Mycroft’s call and put the phone to his ear, standing. He looked down at John and his gaze softened. And then he nodded at him, and that was all John needed.
“Don’t dogs usually have black lips?” he whispered to Sherlock, who nodded.
Sherlock froze.
John was speechless. He breathed a curse and shook his head to himself. Mike watched him with an expression that made John think he pitied him for some reason. Then he continued.
Sherlock hummed something noncommittal into his glass of water. Conversation since his waking had been a little… not forced, but as if they were both avoiding talking about something and they both knew they were doing it. And it wasn’t exactly rocket science to work out what that something was.
John was so undeserving of his thoughtlessness, of his selfishness, of his –
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John interrupted, making short work of his friend’s boots. “Not too tight?”
Before he could find the scarf, however, he had to find the right platform. He pulled out his phone again and followed Sherlock’s instructions, leading him up some stairs, over a bridge, down some more stairs and to where he was meant to be.
So they did. They were now facing the way they’d come. Two garages were separated by the short alleyway they’d walked down, and through that alleyway they could see the dull green back of one of the bike sheds.
Five minutes later, John entered the ward with a glass of water in his hand. The girl, Angelica, was lying in one of the beds with her eyes closed. Sherlock was still playing his violin, though John could have sworn he was doing so quieter than before.
“I just don’t really like the taste,” Sherlock said reasonably. “Plus, alcohol is like looking through clouded glass, it makes people stupid. I don’t do stupid.”

“I suppose you’re here for the same reason I am,” she said, and her voice was clear and precise, and even a little girlish, but that made it all the more numbing.
“Nah,”
– and a series of predictable events that led to the eventual conclusion wherein the protagonist got engaged and then reunited with his family, whom he grew to love, despite their ‘eccentricities’. This Sherlock had deduced before the first scene had come to its long-awaited conclusion.
And then it hit him. Like a punch in the head.
The headmaster’s speech was more of a sales pitch, lauding the school’s successes over the academic year. John tried not to be too proud when he described St. Bart’s win against Boscombe Valley High as
“Hey, let me have a look at you,” he said, taking a step back. “Oh, wow,” he said, and then worried that there was a little too much enthusiasm in his tone. But Sherlock did warrant it – he was wearing a black suit; tailored, probably, to fit snugly against his body and make him seem as if he’d grown. It was elegant and simple, making him look slim, but not thin; tall, but not gangly. Underneath was a purple shirt, so dark it was almost black and just as tight as his other shirts, stuck to him like cling film. “Looking very dapper, Mr Holmes,” he said.
“An Irish Setter,” Sherlock elaborated, “named Redbeard,”
John followed Sherlock through a short corridor and into what John assumed to be the library. He took a moment to take in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, the armchairs and sofas, the rugs and lamps, before turning his attention to the people.
He broke the placid surface so slowly that it almost tickled as his limp body turned so that he was lying on his back, his lungs singing in rejoice of the abundance of oxygen he was allowing them. The residual ache and light-headedness that he was left with after having pushed his brain cells to the point of passing out reminded him that his body was still there, his godforsaken heart still shoving blood through his hollow veins, as if it mattered.
John had no answer, and they entered their room in a comfortable silence, Sherlock deep in thought. John kicked off his shoes and began changing into his Army uniform, which was a little tricky, seeing as Sherlock was pacing again and John had to keep moving out of the way. Blazer off, school trousers off, camo trousers on, jumper off, shirt off, brown undershirt on, camo jacket on, socks off, thicker socks on, one boot, second boo-
Firstly, I wanted to mention that I had to delete the placeholder 'chapter' that I posted around a year ago in order to make way for this actual chapter, but unfortunately, all of your wonderful comments got deleted along with it. But I read and replied to every single one, and they meant so much to me and have stayed with me in the year that it took me to actually get this chapter to you. It took a year because I vastly underestimated how busy my final year of university would be - but then a certain virus came poking around and suddenly, I had a lot more time on my hands thanks to online teaching and a major reduction in the length/difficulty of my final assessments, thank goodness.
“He’s not the one responsible for that. I am. He doesn’t control what people think. And besides, I said it was stupid, not bad.”
“Oh,” Sherlock said. “So – you and her – ?” Sherlock mentally kicked himself, but pressed on. “Broken up?”
On the walk back from lunch, Sherlock was still talking about that Turner woman.
s or the cripplingly swift changes of subject. No-one ever thought that maybe all that was needed was a simple ‘
“What?” Sherlock asked.
They somehow managed to sit in a rough circle, John leaning against their fridge. He put a card in the middle of the circle.
’ but then you try to walk or sit down and
Sherlock made a sound of disgust. “He wants to take me to lunch at that fancy restaurant that serves disgusting food at so high a price everyone is too scared to criticise it and then lecture me about Viola.” He spat the name of his aunt and kicked a stone.
After a couple of minutes of radio silence from both, he had resorted to scrolling through his contacts to see who else he could text. The list was quite short.
“She needs you to go shopping,” Harry supplied, and their mother slapped her on the arm.
“He says he forgot about his plans with them. Says he was playing video games with Seb in his room and time ran away with him and before he knew it, he was so tired he passed out. So he just slept in Seb’s room.”
In the shower, Sherlock’s mind began to reboot. The previous night was lacking in clarity. He walked into the living room of his mind palace to find a tip he didn’t remember creating the night before.
“I do want to,” Sherlock said, feeling his cheeks warm.
“I can’t come down,” Sherlock said. John’s heart seized in his chest. “I’m just going to have to do it like this.”
He paused by the entrance to the school. He resented the way nerves manifested themselves now. Instead of an elevated pulse and shallow breathing – manageable, precise – all he felt was a vague nausea, as if his skin was too tight.
“I meant now,” Sherlock was saying.
“Surely anything in your veins that isn’t blood is enough to kill,” Sally said.
“Hey, I was watching that!” John exclaimed, turning to his sister.
“No problem, mate,” Dan said, catching sight of Sherlock. “Who’s this?”
“For work experience?” the man asked. John nodded. “Oh, thank god you’re here, one of the nurses is off sick and to be honest I’m overqualified to sit behind this desk all day,” the man went on. He spoke very quickly, and with zealous hand gestures to match. He stood up, and almost as an afterthought, extended his hand to John over the desk. “I’m Doctor Smith, by the way.”
“The contacts irritate my eyes, miss,” he lied.
Sherlock looked as if he belonged in London, John thought: eyes everywhere at once, taking in the buskers and the Christmas lights, off in the weak winter daylight; taking in the people wrapped up against the soggy chilliness of the day.
Sherlock’s phone buzzed in his pocket. He put it to his ear.
John had to stop himself from tearing at the grass at his feet, an old habit from childhood.
The hatch was open, pouring grey light through. John reached up but his fingers only grazed the lip.
“I know you do,” Mike said in a tone of voice John couldn’t exactly work out. Before he could question the boy, however, the head of the music department started speaking again.
[in which it is exam season]
“Night, everyone,” he said, surprised but beyond relieved that his voice sounded regular, strong. He forced himself to meet eyes, to smile. His throat relaxed as the others replied, and their expressions betrayed nothing but their usual warmth. Ollie slipped past him, presumably to go to the bathroom, and then it was just Mike in the room behind him.
John smiled and typed out a reply.
John risked a glance at Sherlock, who had let go of his hand at some point. John had never seen him blush before; it was a subtle brush of pink across his cheekbones, but John knew it was betraying the deepest mortification Sherlock had ever felt if Sherlock was feeling even a fraction of what John himself was.
“Come on,” John said, getting up and waiting for Sherlock to do the same.
“I say we just avoid him.”
John wanted to hug the boy. “I know, and I’m so sorry, but this is important. Listen,” he said, leaning in and lowering his voice, “you remember Sherlock?”
“I think – ” Sherlock was interrupted by a
“Goodbye! Thank you!” John shouted as the sound of footsteps faded down the path. Sherlock waited until he heard the door close before opening his eyes and sitting up.
He doubled over and put his head in his hands.
And looked straight ahead.
He stood at the entrance, hoping he was dressed appropriately –
There was a debate over the legitimacy of London as a county which Sherlock didn’t listen to, and considered leaving once more, but the questions resumed so he remained.
“Yes. Thank you. Well. Tell him I will set the police on him if he isn’t home by ten. Goodbye.”
“Sounds splendid.” Sherlock replied, and John looked over his shoulder at him, leaning against the table they’d made their ‘punk-kin’ on, and he felt a pleasant recognition of,
“So you thought you could just not turn up with no repercussions?”
“Obviously not,” his friend replied. “I think the best course of action would be to stick as close to the truth as possible. A girl came to find us because I like mysteries. She said her brother had been kidnapped. We found cocaine in the mud from the bottom of the attacker’s shoe – ”
“I’m not hungry, John,” he repeated.
John looked at the bracelet. It was a simple chain with a single gold charm. A little ornate for Eliza’s age, perhaps, but nothing out of the ordinary.
“Yeah, yes, sorry – see you later, John,” Eddie said, giving him a quick smile and looking over John’s shoulder at Sherlock before walking away, The Hulk following.
John walked up to her and lowered his voice slightly, to something more private and respectful. This was taking too long, they needed to go.
A streetlamp gave the scene a surreal orange glow, giving the tussling figures below deep shadows and harsh angles. One threw a drunken punch, egged on by a couple of swaying bystanders. Their slurred jeers rang clear and loud up to him – “Rotter! Undead piece of shit!”
John grabbed Sherlock’s hands and pulled him to his feet. Sherlock stumbled into John, who gripped his hands and swung his arms. “
“Shut up, John,” Sherlock called back.
Homing pigeons.
“I don’t have friends,” Sherlock repeated, so quiet John could barely hear him, and John was suddenly aware that they were standing in the middle of the lower sixth corridor, and the walls were cream and there was laughter coming from the rooms around them, and it was only break time on a Tuesday and nothing felt as if the world was ripping in two but it was and nobody seemed to be noticing. “I’ve just got one.”
The bus shuddered underneath him and a teacher began to walk the aisle.
Quiet.
Over the next few days, John concentrated on returning to normality, even with the case of the three Js (Kitty’s playful name for it had stuck) ticking over in the background, his article for the
“Don’t be stupid,” Sherlock said. “You were just doing it, when I was holding you. All that’s different is that I’m not holding you anymore. You’re not going to sink, you physically can’t. Just remember to keep kicking. Come on.”
John smiled. “As for Sherlock, why don’t you ask his highness himself?” he got up and appeared to be tugging at someone, and Sherlock was pulled into frame, tieless, jumperless, and holding a pair of forceps.
“Sherlock not up?”
Sherlock stood up, holding a round mirror on a bendable stand in one hand and various cosmetic products in the other. “The mirror is your mother’s, the make-up is Harry’s.”
Sherlock looked at John. “This is something I’m going to take to my grave, John. So thank you for… But I plan not to think of this again until I’m on my deathbed.”
“How’re you feeling?”
Mrs Hudson’s eyes followed Sherlock as he left the room. As soon as he had, she turned her sharp gaze to John. “Now, John, dear, Sherlock’s too shy to ask, but I know he’d love for you to stay another night. What do you think?”
They come back.
. He calmly stood.
John swallowed, his already unhealthily-high pulse rate soaring even higher, palms starting to prickle uncomfortably.
John looked up from the stir fry. And smiled again, but this time, it was sincere. “Hey, stop being so serious. Let’s forget this, yeah? Let’s have a bit of blind faith. Blind, ignorant faith. Yes, Sherlock?”
“Sure? Because we’ve got…” John crouched down and opened a cupboard door. “…uh, we’ve got marshmallows and some custard creams. And that’s it. Jesus, I need to go shopping,”
“So,” John said. “Um.”
“Here we go,” John said as the camera panned out. “New year, here we come…”
John looked around him in awe – he wouldn’t have recognised the room as the same one he had sat in assembly in that morning if he hadn’t known. The stage was fully built; wings, lights, microphones, instruments all in their places. The back of the stage was lit red and purple, and the main hall lights were yet to be turned off, so John could see in great detail the other houses’ costumes. The girls across the aisle from them – Sarah’s house, John realised – were all in bright yellow; the boys across the other aisle seemed to all be in ridiculously flared jeans and headbands; each of the girls in front of them wore a white karate gi, if he wasn’t mistaken.
Their eyes met, finally, John’s red and puffy, tears still streaming down his cheeks and running into the lines in his face and collecting there.
John dropped his hand from his ear, set the phone on the floor. He closed his eyes. Tried to breathe.
Sherlock picked out a book and opened it for John. “This ancient.”
Eric looked at him. “And you kissed him?”
Sherlock saw his brother’s mouth twitch downwards and felt a small victory in it.
“Jesus,” John breathed. “Those poor boys.”
“No, to him not having a Facebook!” John exclaimed. “I was in year eleven, he was in year twelve, lower sixth, whatever, but he was young for his year. Just listen, okay? You were the ones who wanted to know.”
Miss Bailey shot the Head a glance. “Your cover-up, Sherlock. Your contact lenses. Where are they?”
He got started, the hot water spluttering out of the tap, trying to keep the noise down so as not to distract the musicians and get kicked out.
Sherlock sat heavily on his bed. “It’s my bed. I don’t see why I should have to give it up.”
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling. John watched his face, those solemn features. They lay in silence for a moment. John wondered whether that had been a bit too much information, but then Sherlock asked,
Mycroft declined to join them for lunch, taking a plate of food back to his office, despite Mrs Hudson’s protests. The table felt empty in comparison to that morning, just Viola, John, Sherlock and Mrs Hudson seated rather than the mob of guests at breakfast.
want to go to dinner? You, Sherlock ‘my body is transport’ Holmes?”
“So, no more detentions, yeah?” John said. “Can’t have you missing your dose again,”
The last word drove a spike of apprehension through Harry. The two hadn’t been on speaking terms for the last couple of days. That morning had been a little better, though; at least that morning they had acknowledged each other’s presence by wordlessly passing one another the milk at the breakfast table.
He was sitting wrapped in a towel, goggles hanging from his wrist. It was odd to see him without his curls. It made his face look more austere but also, somehow, younger, more vulnerable. He exchanged a few words with the boys sitting around him, but they were all, for the most part, quiet, watching the younger ones line up.
“Sorry,” Harry replied. She gave herself a quick mental pep-talk and took a breath. “Mum, I, um. I just wanted to apologise for the other day. I shouldn’t have said what I did, I was just tired and Clara and I had had a fight and I just – ”
“Your go.”
John considered his friend. “I’m not sure the person who put me in a bomb had such pure intentions,”
Mrs Hudson sighed. “If you insist. We’ll leave you two to say goodbye, then, won’t we, Mycroft,”
[in which John and Sherlock receive their exam results]
“John.”
“Now you’re speaking my language,” Raz grinned lopsidedly. “I’ll be down in a tick.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you saying I look like a mushroom?”
“I feel like death warmed up,” he mumbled, and John could see his eyelids were already drooping again.
“Sorry?”
“I knew it.” He exclaimed happily. “Wonderful!”
John was stunned speechless. Sherlock barely ever spoke of his time in the attic. He had wondered why his friend had returned to the school he hated so much after what had sounded like such a lonely, wretched, three-year-long torture.
Mrs Watson and Dave returned first, when John was dancing to a song he had turned the radio up especially for while simultaneously adjusting the frying pan full of sizzling food, the smell of which was gripping Sherlock’s stomach with hunger pangs. He’d forgotten to eat that morning.
“Yeah, with
“Okay, we’ll leave you to it,” John said hastily as Sherlock began to walk off. “Good luck, I guess,” he said to God. He heard Angelo and Eliza’s voices pick up again as John caught up with Sherlock.
John realised his mouth was open: he closed it.
“What everyone’s saying about me. I made it all up, all the cases. I lied to you.”
Once Sherlock had finished explaining, all the anger had left Bradstreet’s gaze, and his brows were drawn together in confusion.
John could feel his eyes being avoided. Something needed to be said.
“They’re thoroughbreds.” Sherlock reached out to stroke the nose of the one nudging his shoulder. “This is Nutmeg. He’s Mycroft’s.”
“No, not at all. I get it,” John said. “I really do.”
“Clara? Where is she?”
“We will,” they replied in union.
“Didn’t anyone rat him out?” John asked. “I thought Glen would have loved the opportunity to get him in trouble.”
Directly ahead of him was a closed door, behind which was Mrs Watson’s bedroom, Sherlock assumed. The sister’s room was immediately to his right, the door open a crack affording a view of a cluttered floor and a lava lamp bubbling gently on a desk. John’s room lay to the right of Harry’s, the door open wide.
“When was your last HIV test?”
It felt to John like Sherlock hadn’t been in their room at night for most of that week, and it felt strange to go to sleep in an empty room. He had been so used to it when he had first arrived at Bart’s, but now it was something rare and the room felt cold.
“I wish the Christmas holidays went on forever,” John said.
“Year nine passed in much the way as would be expected now that Sherlock lived in the ceiling: quietly. He avoided everyone as much as he could, but when he did speak to us, he was polite, maybe a little too polite. One by one, we stopped talking to him altogether.
One by one, the adults began to stand, stretch and wish the room goodnight. Mrs Hudson went first, then Viola, sighing and putting away her laptop. Lastly, Mycroft, and then the drawing room felt too big.
John snorted. “Don’t judge a book by its cover, Mr Holmes. I may not be a primadonna, but I’ve done my fair share of dancing.”
. “Spare seat here if you want it.”
“Just because other houses do it doesn’t mean we should as well,” Sherlock reasoned. “If Barnaby started walking around in lingerie, would you?”
“Them?”
John shrugged at his mum as the line went dead.
and a heavy sigh from their mum. They decided to leave her to it and settled down to watch the film together regardless.
“Yes, she is.”
He was thrown. “What? I’m just making conversation-“
Lestrade raised his glass in greeting, his other hand shoved, as always, in his trouser pocket. “Hello, Doc,” he returned, grinning conspiratorially like he had won something.
John laughed. “How do you know?”
“Bored, John,” he repeated, louder this time.
“Case, John – ”
“ – but one must leave the cultures for forty-eight hours before the results can be gathered, so no; it is not an inconvenience. Rather good timing, actually.”
Sherlock was sitting on the edge of the roof, legs dangling. John made sure to make more noise than usual when he climbed through the window to alert Sherlock to his presence so he didn't make him jump.
Sherlock could observe no discernable difference between what John did next and what he had done, except the more-vigorous-than-necessary stirring, recreating the eddies of the torrid Thames in miniature.
“And?”
Sherlock didn’t reply for a moment. Then, “I’m thinking.”
“Mhm,” Sherlock replied through his last mouthful of toast. “What do you need?”
“Hi, sir,” John said, the title slipping out before he could stop it.
“I’m not a
, then it’s like…
He’d been chatting merrily away with Mrs-Watson-call-me-Jo about school, mainly, evading the topic of family as always. Harry and Clara were finding something about this whole thing very amusing, and kept laughing at not entirely funny moments.
When the last crumbs of the food were the only traces of their secret feast left, John decided it was time.
“Well, I’m sorry dear, but we’ve only two bottles left.”
“Hey, Sherlock,” he said, and stood up, Jeanette’s hand falling away from his arm. Sherlock saw irritation there, on her features, and repressed a smug smirk. “What’s up?”
Sitting opposite him was a man, mid-forties maybe, reading a book. He had a pair of glasses on, and was wearing a brown coat over jeans, a jumper and trainers. Nothing out of the ordinary, he was just a bloke on the tube, travelling from one place to another. How did Sherlock do this? It was difficult.
They bickered for a bit, and Sherlock soon forgot that he was only wearing a pair of pyjama bottoms, the cool air no longer feeling like paint stripper on his skin in its foreignness.
fucking excited.
Sherlock cocked his head in thought.
so young, just thirteen, but you wouldn’t know it to look at her. She’d hidden her youth under her clothes and her make-up. But those unmistakable freckles of hers still insisted on being noticed. She was growing to look like her mother more and more each day.
“I will. Thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
“Yes, sir,” John said, he and Sherlock beginning to walk upstairs.
They stayed like that, Sherlock’s head bent to John’s shoulder, coats brushing, for the rest of the journey, Sherlock deducing half the passengers within his sight quietly into John’s ear.
“He was being insolent and rude to me, as he always is, so I simply inquired as to whether it was entirely appropriate for him to be drinking so much malt whiskey before the first lesson of a new year, and whether his developing pornography addiction had helped him with his marital problems, and he evicted me from his class. What’s so funny?”
Sherlock led John up the staircase the way they’d gone earlier.
It was like breathing out after holding your breath until your head swam, it was like the rush of oxygen as you inhaled again, it was like sitting on a roof as the stars came out. He opened his eyes and felt as if he had had them closed for weeks.
John found Sherlock in their room, creating a foul-smelling substance over the Bunsen burner. He greeted him by putting the Herald down in his line of sight.
“Reminds me of Christmas at home,” John said, and his voice betrayed neither sadness nor happiness, simply a bittersweet-ness, a wistfulness.
After he could breathe properly again, John flopped backwards and lay on the carpet, heels of his hands pressed into his closed eyes.
“Hi,” John said shortly. “You guys okay?”
“Now, to the graphite category.” Sherlock immediately started paying attention again, acutely aware of John’s presence beside him. “There were several strong contenders here, as this was the category with the most entries. Congratulations to all those who entered for making our decision so difficult. Our winner was Seyi Babalola from Green house, with our runner-up being John Watson from Doyle.”
(Also, I don't know how common the term 'san' is, and though I've heard it used by pupils from many different boarding schools, I think it's worth explaining anyway; it's short for sanatorium, so basically a mini-hospital at school - think of the hospital wing in Harry Potter!)
Sherlock hummed, and John wasn’t sure exactly what that meant. Sherlock walked back into his bedroom and pulled on a hoodie, and all of a sudden, Sherlock's hands hidden by the long sleeves and curls flattened by the hood, John had to look away, smiling at the floor.
Sherlock opened his mouth to explain, but the door to the office opened.
She folded her arms and opened her mouth but before she could say anything more, there was a knock at the door. It was pushed open by someone who could only have been Richie Brook’s uncle.
“PDS Community Care Officer, I know,” Sherlock interrupted.
“John,” Sherlock interjected, cutting off Sally’s retort. “I believe we had something to discuss.”
“An enemy. In his mind. If you were to ask him, he may even say his arch enemy.”
John got the ketchup and two biscuits, and scouted the room for a place to sit. He found one, the very end of a bench near the entrance, and sat down while Sherlock got the drinks – another routine they’d fallen into in recent weeks.
“Thank you.”
), and then continuing up to the top of the building.
“Hey.” John bristled and took a step forward, at which Angelo stood up a little straighter. “You think it makes you more of a man using language like that? Trying to validate that pathetic pubic hair you’ve got growing on your upper lip?”
But all the same, all the same…
“Oh, I – I don’t think I’m going to come today,” John said, getting up and moving towards the door. “I’m not feeling great.”
“If he had been home on time this never would have happened,” the man – Mycroft – replied, a little softer this time.
“- flinched when Moran called you to attention? Right at the end of your conversation? And the way she was looked so confronted when you asked her about her bruise? It’s most likely that was – what?”
“Can I go to the toilet?” he whispered.
A deep voice came from behind him. “Waiting for someone?”
John wanted to move, wanted to run for the door and up to the roof, but his feet would not move. He was breathing too fast, too shallow. He felt dizzy. He felt the icy fingers of panic poking their way in through his ribs. “Yes. I remember.”
But John knew he himself had some peace-making to do before he could judge Angelo too harshly. The thing he was trying not to feed meant something about him, too.
Sherlock sat up, slid off the fridge, and immediately regretted it, feeling as if he were about to faint, swaying, vision whitening. He must have groaned, because there was a firm hand on his arm and another on his shoulder and a voice asking him what was wrong.
John logged his entry time and the reason for his visit and told him to wait on one of the pews. He watched him hobble over, one leg stiff, the sound his crutch made on the floor making John’s left leg ache. He sat as if someone was pushing on his shoulders, folded in on himself, hands clasped in his lap. John found himself wanting to sit down next to him and rub his back, like one would stroke a frightened pet.
He stared at the screen as the messages were delivered, waiting for them to be read, waiting for a reply.
“You were.”
“Sally,” cautioned Mike, in between muttering obscenities under his breath and trying to jog Freckles’ arms with his elbow.
Clara scrutinised him for a second, then stood up and walked out of the room, only a little unsteadily.
“I’ll get a razor, hang on,” John heard Anderson say, heard him take a step, and then heard him stop and say, very quietly, “Oh.”
). Don’t forget to leave Chloe some love in their
is she not wearing her disgusting necklace anymore, that is the question!”
“So you live with him?”
He looked at Sherlock, waiting for him to say something, but his friend only blinked.
The boy blinked a few times before focusing on John’s face, and when he did, the first emotion John saw on his features was confusion, then panic set in as he looked around at his surroundings.
Tom cleared his throat and continued. “So, Mr Holmes, Mrs Hudson. I’m sure you’ve read the leaflets we posted to you prior to your son’s return, and I’m sure you know about the various acts and bills the government has put in place to protect your son and people like him. However, what you may not know is that there also, unfortunately, must to be acts and bills to protect the living as well. To that end, as I’m certain Sherlock understands, it is
Sherlock looked at John. He was sitting quietly, watching the people around him. Someone on the other side of the aisle called his name, and John’s face instantly split into a smile, genuine as ever, and Sherlock watched as he chatted away merrily. John sometimes talked to him like that. Which was odd because Sherlock didn’t give him much of a response when he talked about menial things. John knew that he would get that response, but he chatted to him anyway. Odd.
John’s flailing mind screamed.
” which made John laugh until the lights came up fully a split second later and he was presented with a row of topless boys’ backs, adorned with silver sequins and glittering under the lights.
Sherlock felt as if his heart had stopped. He didn’t remember much about his death, having chosen to delete it. His last few days had been hazy anyway, shrouded in mist. But those initials, the first mention of them, made the fog clear.
[in which Sherlock swears]
“I love these sorts of things,” John said contentedly. “Like, who in their right mind would ever wear this, seriously?” he held up a blue and white knitted hat with too many bobbles for its own good.
“And you must be David,” John replied, grinning and extending his own. The man had a firm grip, but not too firm – his father used to say that people with good handshakes were ones to trust. “It’s good to finally meet you.”
“Absolutely not,” John replied, again escaping Sherlock’s grasp and ripping open the parcel.
“It’s not,” Kitty said, her voice a little less brash now, her gaze a little more serious. “I promise, it’s not me.”
“Oh,” Mike said, frowning as he recalled the hurried conversation during a rugby practice. “Oh, yeah. Ages ago. You remember that?”
"Mhm. And, like him when he first started, you've got some new lingo to learn, John!" They came to a landing. John silently thanked god that the stairs were over, at least for now. Mike strode off into a winding corridor. "All teachers are known by their surnames, that sort of thing. Not to their face, mind you. I found it hard to get used to at first as well, but I've been here so long that I forget it's weird.
“That’s gross, Sherlock,” John said, and Sherlock flicked some water at his face, so John flicked some back, and before long both were sopping wet and apologising to the very displeased year ten who had got in the line of fire while trying not to giggle.
“Welcome home, you troublemakers,” Lestrade said, once the noise had receded a little.
. There was nothing for it but to open the door.
John found himself looking at the sky.
“Pute, salope, conne,” John repeated. “Thank you for that knowledge, Sherlock.”
“So that’s why you didn’t know we don’t have a king.”
“Hey! What the hell are you doing out so late?”
“Tutor?”
Sherlock sighed again, but he could feel himself smiling. “Fine.”
As he pushed through the circle of boys, the coach was helping John sit up.
“Yes, yes, I know,” interjected Sherlock, trying to rid John’s features of the fiery cocktail of worry and anger that had settled there.
