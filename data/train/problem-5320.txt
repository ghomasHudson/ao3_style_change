The ivory piano keys plunked loudly as the drunkard ham-fisted ‘Strawberry Roan’ out in the front. It served as a sort of tempo for Castiel. One to pace the thrust of his hips with. It was jarring, but worked well enough; at least to keep his mind focused while he finished.
I barked a ‘no’ again, the growl spreading from my throat down to my chest. It reminded me that my body was not quite my own. Worry crept up through the cracks in my stubbornness and I considered doing what Dean wanted.
I shot to my feet, my hand going to where I kept my gun and found that it was gone. I spun around, adrenaline shooting through my veins and making every sound seem four times as loud. The bed was gone. I was alone in the clearing, with only the wind and creaking of wood as my only company.
Dean looked like he wanted to argue, but another hail of bullets shut him up. One caught the back of Sam’s calf, making him cry out in pain. Just a graze. The taller Winchester continued on, now on a mission to end this.
That fooled no one. Panting, I finally looked around at the pair staring intently at me. Sam in particular. He’d been the one to pull me out of my nightmare after all. As I mentally told my brother to shut up, I didn’t pay attention to Castiel coming closer. The familiar pressure of his hand against my shoulder – over the mark he’d left when he saved my sorry ass from hell – startled me. I jerked back like his touch  burned.
“And all the others.” Dean added.
That was the last thing Sam wanted. His brother was here to give him a hard time. Just like their father had over the years he’d been away. It did surprise Sam that John had stooped so low as sending Dean, his loyal dog, to visit in person. Usually he’d only receive a passive-aggressive letter thinly veiled as a plea for him to return.
I met Claire’s somber gaze and gave her a nod.
My hands pushed at his arm uselessly. He ignored my scrambling like I was nothing more than a trapped rat. Leaning in close so I could feel his breath across my lips he hissed, “
Sam noted the twitch in Dean’s jaw just before he grumbled, “Yeah, all right.”
Without warning, the potted plant next to us started sprouting at an alarming rate. Thick vines shot out and went straight for my tiny body. A sharp whine of surprise was crushed from me as I was tangled up.
As the engine roared to life, I gripped the steering wheel and answered determinedly, “We’re going to need
Cas followed after. Quietly. The guilt in my chest increased as I struggled to ignore his presence. I hammered my fist against Sam’s door. It didn’t matter if I woke up the whole motel. I just needed to do something to distract myself.
Swallowing hard I muttered, “I don’t know if I can.”
"Hello Dean."
The angel smiled and finished cleaning off.
“It’s…cold.” Dean supplied lamely.
“Sounds serious.”
“Okay…okay.” He grumbled, putting his gun away.
Soft murmurs of acknowledgment and surprise ran the rounds. Blue eyes flashed across my vision as I continued, “We are hunters. All of us. We fight for what we believe and who we lo-love. I know I’m asking a lot. I know that, but…he would do it for us.
“You know…” Dean said quietly, almost a whisper. “I left you to your business. Never bothered you.”
“Will do.” She smiled, the warmth not reaching her eyes.
With a smile and a wave over my shoulder I called back, "Bitch!"
“What’d Pa say?” Sam asked softly. Despite not looking forward to the answer, he needed to know how Dean was doing with what must have been a terrible time.
Gritting my teeth as tobacco smoke wafted over the wind, I grumbled, “Dick move.”
Castiel’s fingers hovered over my body. I blinked; my eyelids suddenly very heavy.
About an hour, two beers, and one burger later the late-night bar crowd started showing up. I saw Floyd come in and order what looked to be two fingers of whiskey. A bit surprising. I took him as the non-drinker type.
Eventually, my brother emerged. Rubbing at his sleep filled eyes. He blinked  through the early morning light to the pair of us standing before him. Voice still thick with sleep he asked, “Dean? What…?”
Castiel beamed, looking happier than I thought was possible for him. For the first time in forever I felt complete. The wind tossed our hair and the music faded, I reached over the back of the seat and rested my hand on Cas’ shoulder. The gesture seemed to surprise him but after a moment, he smiled. As we kicked up dirt and coasted down the lonely stretch of road I thought of Sam and hoped that he’d get here soon. But not too soon.
“And then he said he couldn’t wait to do things to my brother again…terrible things that I never…that I never knew about.” His voice cracked as a new wave of emotions stifled his words.
, was written across the Sherriff’s face, but he wasn’t about to say it out loud.
For a moment they just stared at each other. Castiel still replaying Dean’s orgasm face over and over in his mind, and Dean wondering if he was really about to ask Cas if they could fuck for real. Eventually, Dean sat up so he was face to face with the angel. He looked into Cas’ blue irises, thinking that he’d never seen them so close before. Strangely it comforted him. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d looked into someone’s eyes so straightforwardly.
Hissing in pain, I glanced down at my foot wedged at an awkward angle between a rock and a root.
, I thought to myself, shaking my head. One second, I’m avoiding Cas, the next I’m arguing with myself to talk to him, the next I’m trying to run away.
“Find them?” the pacing girl scoffed. “After last night they’re probably in tiny pieces by now.”
When I didn’t respond fast enough, Dean looked to Cas and asked, “Can’t you speak to him? I mean, you’ve talked to a cat before, right?”
Mr. Waithe nodded vacantly, raising a glass full of amber liquid to his lips that I hadn’t noticed was in his other hand. He led the way into the sitting room which looked to have seen better days. Empty bottles and stray garbage lay strewn about the furniture and floor. The faint smell of unwashed body permeated the otherwise pleasant room. He sat gingerly on the edge of one of the sitting chairs, carefully adjusting his grip on the glass in his hand. Rubbing at his splotched face Mr. Waithe asked, “So, what is it you boys want to know?”
“Or she’s calling that boyfriend of hers.”
The crowd is silent. I shuffle nervously as I look around at their unsure faces. Doubt creeps in and I can feel my shoulders drooping in disappointment before I notice Jody step up next to Alex and Claire. She places her hands on each of their shoulders as she says decidedly, “For family.”
knew.”
Castiel instantly wondered what kind of face Dean would make while orgasming. Wanting nothing more than to see that, Cas broke away, bracing himself on one elbow while he wrapped around both of their cocks with his other hand. He continued gyrating, pumping his dick through his hand and against Dean’s. The closest thing Dean thought it felt like was being inside the hot warmth of a woman, but somehow, he was also the woman. Was what he was feeling now close to what it felt like to be fucked?
He nodded and adjusted his position so he faced me directly. Just as I was pulling up Ashland, Oregon on my computer to give him the details, Cas asked quietly, “Do you think Dean is ready for another hunt?”
Sam stepped carefully around me, scanning the opposite side of the clearing around the tower.
Peeking around the corner I saw Ivan on the floor close to where I stood, lying unconscious under a pretty significant dent in the wall that was body shaped. Castiel was further in, literally rooted to the ground. His angel blade was next to his feet, dropped when it was crushed from his grasp. He cried out in pain as the vines around him constricted. Gertie stood in front of him, working hurriedly to scatter herbs and light candles around Maggie and an older woman lying on the bed. That must be Gertie’s mom. Tubes and wires trailed from her body.
Taking a large bite out of my double bacon and egg burger I muttered in agreement, “Yeah that does sound like a song we tap to.”
“You feeling okay?” I asked, knowing he would hate being asked that even before it got past my lips.
Glancing unsurely between everyone gathered, Ivan leaned closer and studied the screen. Pointing at the bottom corner he said, “There’s a partial license plate.”
"What did you see?" Sam asked, his voice calm and controlled.
Overwhelmingly I wished I could have taken back the last ten minutes and all that I showed him. I had to save him from me. I had to convince him that he’d put his faith in a monster.
Her fingers dug into my windpipe and I felt my vision begin to spot. I tried hitting her and breaking free, but it was no use. Dimly I wondered if getting killed in the Empty meant I would end up here too.
Sadly, I peered over to her and Sam, noting that her eyes still had that glazed over quality about them. She must have seen what happened to Gavin first hand. Putting my hands in my pockets to try and warm them up a little I asked, “Did you and your brother see anything strange out there? The Firewatcher says Gavin talked about feeling like he was in a maze.”
His blade found my flesh over and over again. He didn’t speak, but he kept forcing me to look into his eyes. The eyes of a demon. Reminding me of the guilt. I didn’t die. No matter how much I wished for it. No matter how many times I begged for God to come and give him back his wings and take my life in exchange.
Sam beat me to conscious land and was already going over a couple hardbacks we kept in the trunk to see if there was anything useful while he waited for me to rise. Checking my watch, I saw that it was a little after eight in the morning. Yawning, I slumped into my chair and muttered a hoarse greeting. He was too engrossed in his pages to make any sort of acknowledgement. But just then my phone started ringing. Unfamiliar caller ID; had to be either Floyd or that guy from the visitor center.
Sam did. Before the car came to a full stop, I launched myself out into the fresh air. Stumbling about two steps, I let the contents of my stomach splatter onto the ground at my feet. It wasn’t much. As I continued to dry heave, my body trembling uncontrollably, I heard Castiel pull up behind the Impala.
“Not sure, no one else has talked. But I did look into it and a couple of the people that are gone have some domestic disturbances and assaults on their record, so they fit with previous M.O.’s.”
“I’m hitting the sack.” I grumbled. “We’ll leave in four hours.”
” the Tikbalang crooned, giving Castiel’s ribs a none too gentle squeeze. “
“Why not?”
After a moment she decided that he wasn’t a threat. Her fists un-clenched as she graciously nodded her head in recognition of the shorter of the two.
After gathering up all the gear he would need, Sam walked over to his brother, clapped him on the shoulder and said loudly, “Feel better, Dean!”
Eileen helped me to my feet. She gave me a quick hug before signing, “Good luck.”
He asked himself worriedly, trying to catch his breath as he shot a quick look up at his brother.
After a long pause, Sam looked up into his brother’s eyes and nodded resolutely.
“Let me guess, her name is Moonchild?”
He was right. That did sound like a case.
“A witch. I heard you.”
“He’s in the Empty,” Jack answered sadly.
“Mr. Moore? Miss Moore?” he called, removing his coat and hanging it on the hook next to the door. “Anyone home?”
“I don’t get it. I mean, different Betas. Men and women…there has to be a connection.”
I couldn’t even look at him. Cringing away from his touch, I fell back onto my ass and pulled my knees to my chest, resting my head in my hands. I needed to calm down before I really lost it. Being the tenacious and infinitely kind little brother that he was, Sam knelt down next to me and even went so far as to wrap his warm (and very real) arms around my trembling shoulders. I tried to ignore the hesitation in his body language and wondered how much of my trip down self-loathing lane he’d seen. I tried to move away again at the thought, but he held me in place. Silently refusing to let me be alone in my suffering.
“You…bottom-feedin’…hustler!” one of the bandits spat through a mouthful of blood, clutching uselessly at the steadily gushing bullet wound in the side of his neck as he tried scooting away.
Most of eastern Washington state passed by in darkness. I took the time to take in a few hours shut eye. And when the sun was peaking up over the horizon between the gargantuan mountains, we were about an hour outside of our destination, snaking along Highway 20 east and I took back control of the wheel.
A guttural, wet roar erupted from behind me making me jump. My skin tingled as dread rippled down my spine. I was suddenly eight years old again, shivering, holding a silver knife unsurely in my small hands, wondering when Dad was going to come back to baby Sam and me.
That must be Joel Brown. He didn’t look satisfied with that answer but didn’t stop his coworkers from dispersing. When he was alone, I stepped up and asked softly, “Are you Joel Brown?”
“Worth a shot.” I grumbled, once again heading to the kitchen, dead set on getting myself a stiff drink, no matter how much it hurt.
“There’s been another…disturbance, and I can’t reach our Firewatcher up at Davis Peak. Meet me back at the Stetattle Creek Trailhead asap. Over.”
Once we were sealed away in the small break room, the man slumped down into a vacant seat and sighed heavily. Crossing my arms Sam and I waited for him to catch his breath. Glancing up at us he said, “Sorry, it’s uh…busy season. I’m Eddie, you two say you’re here to search for the missing workers? I thought HQ wasn’t sending anyone for another week?”
They gave their excuses to their friends who were much further along in their consumption of spirits and slipped out of the front doors into the city. The sun had set by now. The flickering light of streetlamps cast a warm glow on the walk; a pale interpretation of the golden light that had flooded the streets earlier as they headed into the saloon. Didn’t change how beautiful Jessica looked. Her skin practically glowed.
, I said silently, tears blurring my vision. The last thing I saw was Jack’s sad smile before I too was zapped out of the Empty. I staggered on my feet in the bunker’s garage but was steadied by what felt like a dozen hands. I blinked, the tears falling down my cheeks as I did.
“What’s going on, Max?” I asked, trying hard to act like I wasn’t amused.
“What about classes?”
I stared down at the amber liquid in the bottom of my glass. My second double in the last twenty minutes. It didn’t give me any helpful answers despite how hard I wished it would.
Recognition flashed through his mind as he noticed one of the men as the prostitute that’d smelled him out as an Omega earlier. Instantly the hairs on Dean’s arm’s and neck stood up. He tried keeping his cool, but as soon as the group noticed him drawing closer, they moved to cut him off at the hotel’s entrance. The jig was up. Sidestepping away from them, Dean caught the glint of badges on their coats.
The last time I was teleported out, I felt Eileen’s hand on my arm, stopping me. Miracle was at her feet, panting heavily and clearly exhausted from having chased after me again and again on foot.
I whirled around as a voice called my name from directly behind me. For a brief second, my heart felt as though it were about to crush itself and all I could think was that I needed to kill whoever was sneaking up on me. But as I lowered my barrel, I found myself staring down it at Sam’s shocked face.
The joints in my legs popped in relief as I emerged from the driver’s side. Rolling my shoulders, I took in the fresh mountain air. Further west the peaks loomed, promising that our journey through them was about to be narrow and winding.
“I thought…I thought I heard Dad.”
As Sam slid into the passenger seat of the Impala and Eileen took the backseat with Miracle, he asked, “So, why was this song so important?”
The remnants of cum slicked up the erection, making Dean’s movements smooth. Castiel couldn’t help but close his eyes and pull Dean in. Their lips met feverishly, opening and closing as hot, wanton breath puffed out, warming their skin. Neither had kissed like that; dirty, sloppy, needy.
It took a few more coaxing words from the angel, but finally, Dean’s eyes fluttered open. They shimmered with a mournful pain. His mouth opened and closed as he looked blearily up into the angel’s concerned face. For a second it seemed like he didn’t believe that Castiel was there, and then relief flooded his features. He closed his eyes and whispered, “I’m so glad you’re alive, man…”
A resounding chorus of ‘no’ answered him. His face paled.
Something primal and unfamiliar bubbled up inside. It was similar to what he had felt when he’d killed Constance. This time though, instead of glowing like the light of a candle, it was a blazing inferno. It hurt. But also felt good. Like something that had been missing from him his whole life had awakened.
want to find out how loud these things can get.”
Both Castiel and I gave her the ‘I don’t understand that reference’ face. Blinking she explained, “Powerpuff girls? No? Just me?
Sam rolled his eyes and called, “At least quiet down when we get to town.”
He set his coat down at the foot of the bed before motioning for me to do as he asked. It wasn’t an order, but I did what he wanted anyway. Must have been shock. Any other day or if it had been anyone but him and he would have found out what my gun tasted like.
We pulled away after a lingering moment. There was nothing else that needed to be said. I was confident that he knew what to do. And he knew that if he ever needed anything, his family would be there to help him.
“You’re scared to go back?”
Sam subtext:
Working on some kind of instinct, he reached over, lightly patting the top of my head with the palm of his hand. His skin felt rough against my fur, but not in a bad way. It tugged lightly on my ears, giving me the warm feeling of being looked after; comfort. It reminded me of when I was younger – smaller. Dean would always hold me, get me anything I needed if I was sick. Once puberty hit of course, I told him to quit mothering me.
What Sam had just done with his bare hands hit him like the kick of a mule to the chest. Sure, he’d shot outlaws when he’d been with his Pa and Dean, but he’d never killed one with his bare hands before. He’d never been strong enough.
Around this time Sam saw his brother and went to meet him.
I followed smoothly and said, “FBI.”
Brushing by him, I silently begged him to drop it and went in the  Impala’s direction.
“You mean, look up the registered owner?” Ivan asked, running a hand through his hair. “And then what? We go and–”
As I pulled off onto the exit that would lead us back to the little town, I risked a glance at him. Seeing that I didn’t understand, Cas continued, “If he processes as you say, then why can he not express that process once he has concluded?”
find, but it’s never enough.”
Sam felt other eyes linger on her as their group made its way down the crowded street. A number of them followed after, taking in Jessica’s intoxicating Omega scent. Sam didn’t know the aroma personally. He still hadn’t presented, and couldn’t scent like those that had. But he could imagine it was irresistible. Not only were Omegas a rare thing anymore, but she was truly stunning. Quite the catch for a Beta or Alpha looking for a mate.
He lightly slammed his fist against the steering wheel before asking, “Did the witch take Maggie?”
I looked to Sam wiping at his eyes and sniffing and laughed again. Karma got me pretty fast though when it felt like I’d just gargled with razorblades. It was Sam’s turn to laugh. He put his arm around my shoulders and said, “Think you can handle swallowing an anti-inflammatory?”
“What?”
Sam chewed the inside of his cheek before nodding.
Its wild eyes locked on to the pair of us, staring down the barrel of our guns almost defiantly. Standing frozen, it waited. The spell was broken only when Sam let out a snort and a chuckle. Springing away lithely, the fox disappeared into the underbrush with barely a sound.
with an Omega. Wouldn’t mind trying it again. What do you say, handsome?”
“Be safe,” she muttered, blinking her lust away as she stepped back.
Jacob’s house was just as small as I’d been expecting, even less taken care of than other homes in the area. At least on the outside. On the inside he had himself set up really nice. Big ass flat screen that had me half tempted to sit down and enjoy. Sam’s immediate look of disapproval stopped me in my tracks though. Pouting, I headed back out to check around the property leaving Sam with the EMF to poke around for any signs of ghosts. If there had been something out there making noises and smells, there was no evidence of it now. I did note that the back of the house abutted the thick forest, so it would be easy for anyone, creature or otherwise, to slip in and out easily. There were just too many options.
It felt like Sam was looking up from the bottom of a well at someone calling down from the top; trapped with the echoes of screams. But something in the way Dean’s hands trembled caught Sam’s attention. He focused on the green eyes looking into his own. He could see their mother and Jessica reflected back at him. Dean was scared.
Eventually I left everyone to their celebrating and slipped away to my room with Miracle. I flopped down onto my bed and let out a heavy sigh. The faint sounds of people talking and laughing carried through the halls. But it didn’t bother me. It was comforting thinking of all the people that cared enough to go into the Empty.
Touching the cut with the tips of his fingers, Ivan pulled them away and stared down at the bright red like he was annoyed. Giving me a stern look, he grumbled, “I’ve had worse.”
Jack grinned excitedly but paused, looking to Castiel for the final say. The dark-haired angel studied the Nephilim for a moment, struggling with the idea of not being there to protect him. Eventually, Castiel gave a small nod of approval. Jack’s grin grew even wider before he disappeared down the hall.
“Mr. Welch mentioned that after his children and wife died, he abandoned their house and moved closer to town.”
He was ignored. Dean tugged on his jacket, silently telling Castiel that he wanted him closer. Obediently, the angel went down on his elbows and positioned his lower body between Dean’s legs. As soon as their lower halves met, the pair made noises of surprise and pleasure. Castiel was shocked to find Dean already half hard which quickly caused his own erection to swell in response.
I was out just like that.
Holding up a finger, she rushed over to the x-ray display and switched on the backlight. As she put up each image she continued, “The family won’t let me perform an exploratory autopsy, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t still examine her bones using other means.”
I whimpered, feeling tired and overwhelmed. He seemed to understand. Closing the distance between us he ran his palm gently across my head, careful to avoid any injuries. He rubbed one of my long ears and murmured, “Don’t worry, Sammy, we’ll fix you up. Just get some rest.”
The brothers fled across the street to a nearby alley and ducked into the shadows. Not long after, a crowd started gathering outside the boarding house. Some attempted a half-hearted gesture at getting buckets to fight back the flames, but it was already too far gone. They realized quickly once the fire brigade arrived and instead of fighting the fire, started preparing the houses next door to spare them the same fate.
The cut wasn’t deep, but it stung like hornets under my skin; one hell of a spell. My vision doubled from the blow to the back of the head and I struggled to focus enough to fight back.
“Yes, you vomited on yourself.”
Sounding as nonchalant as he could, he called over his shoulder, “Oh, yeah, just hunting buffalo. I’m riding out with Dean to bring him back…”
Sam also stood, meeting my gaze and agreed resolutely, “Yeah. We’re getting him back.”
"C'mon," I said, starting off into the trees with my gun out.
Fresh tears coursed down his cheeks as he repeated over and over, “Thank God…thank God you’re here…thank God.”
He nodded, casting his eyes down at his feet before turning them to me. He was out here avoiding my brother. Both of us knew it.
At the mention of Gavin’s name, he turned to the girl Sam was administering first aid to and mumbled, “Sai and I found her on our way here. She wouldn’t talk…”
I smiled and strode up to her. She blinked uncomfortably as I closed the distance between us. But she didn’t back down or move.
Cas’ hand came up and found Dean’s shoulder. He squeezed gently, silently telling the other that he was there and didn’t plan on leaving any time soon.
“Ah, well, c’est la vie as the frogs say.” The older Alpha shrugged, casually stuffing a wad of chewing tobacco in his cheek.
“Good,” Sherriff answered, placing his hat on his brow as he strode to the door. The other two fell in step behind him.
My voice broke and faded. I hung my head as my body began to tremble. Miracle whined and put his head on my leg, blinking mournful brown eyes up at me.
When I didn’t continue, I met her even gaze and winked, leaving it at that. She grinned, nudged me playfully and asked if I wanted another drink. We sat out there together sipping on whiskey in silence. One of my best memories with my niece.
And I have to apologize for being SO bad at this website! I feel like a baby deer learning how to walk. (Love you LittleRedDragon) lol
Scoffing, I glanced over at him, now hoping that he would just read my mind and get it over with. But instead I felt my insides twist at the look of focused concern on Cas’ face. His dark brows were drawn together tightly, wrinkling his forehead up to his hairline. Mostly it was his eyes that got me. Normally if he was trying to get information out of someone or something, they would be slightly narrowed making them crease around the edges. It always made the blue of his irises look even darker. But right now, they were wide open, bright with curiosity and ready to take in all of what I had to say.
Whoops and hollers echoed out as they closed in. Dean widened his stance and put up his fists. He wasn’t going down without a fight, that much was for certain.
“Yes,” Castiel answered unsurely, suppressing the urge to shiver at the intimate touch.
“Hey, you okay?” I called over to Ivan. He looked a little banged up. Blood trickled from a cut on the back of his head, staining his uniform collar black in the dim light.
“We need to see your head mortician, Helena Fuentes.” Sam said, giving the woman a polite smile.
He asked himself, casting back into his mind as he recognized the signs; cold sweat, weakness, fogged mind.
“Helena? There’s two men here to see you.” The secretary called, casting a nervous glance over her shoulder at Sam towering behind her. “They say they’re FBI.”
He glanced up, catching sight of me. If he was surprised, I couldn’t tell. For a moment we stared at each other before he gave me a solemn nod. Not sure what else to say or do, I awkwardly patted the wood and turned, tight lipped to follow after Helena.
Sniffing defiantly, Dean replied, “I’m old enough.”
The same muffled voice from earlier spoke again but I couldn’t make out the words. Didn’t sound like they were too happy about Maxine asking for help.
“Yeah, Floyd doesn’t find her
After clearing his throat, he asked, “What should we do now Sam?”
“I didn’t know I could hurt this much after a break up. I never have before.” She cries into his shoulder.
“Right, You’re new here.” Dean says, pointing at Castiel.
“Okay Charlie gets to pick.” Cas says, Dean nods.
“Good Morning Sam,” he greeted as he walked in. Sam barely looked up, he was getting his books and laptop into his bag. His class was in about fifteen minutes, he was already late. Sam waved quickly, but then did a double take as he noticed Cas.
He hated that he was on Omega. Just thinking about how weak it made him was enough to send him into a sour mood. When he was in the middle of a heat it was agony. Anything that brushed against his skin felt like lightning running through his body all the way to his groin. And it didn’t go away easily. If he was alone, he would touch himself feverishly, barely able to get his hands to cooperate. It was hot and messy and humiliating.
There was no more smell of tobacco. In fact, I wasn’t even sure if it had been there in the first place. Was this case getting to me? Where the hell was all this coming from?
“There’s a druid family that inhabited the north of France in the 12
Eventually we ran out of fireworks and gasoline. We decided to take it in shifts after that, to save on energy while others went out to resupply on gas. Hours went by. I stopped keeping track.
, I begged silently.
His voice was quiet as he answered, “You’re my best friend.”
Bobby smirked knowingly and jerked his chin in the direction of something over my shoulder. Before I turned around Bobby stood and said, “When you’re all settled, come in and say hello to Ellen and Jo.”
“Can you tell us about the area around the disappearances?” Sam probed gently.
Hopping out of bed he too knelt down and asked worriedly, “You hurting somewhere?”
Dean shoved at the saloon’s doors and stepped in, still fuming from what Sam had just said. That anger was not easily hidden on his face, but he could tell it helped establish an uneasy tone with the other patrons of the saloon as he slammed the swinging doors wide. They didn’t look like the worst crowd, but they certainly weren’t the best either. The dirty blonde strode up to the bar top and barked out an order for whiskey. The barkeep didn’t even bother scenting him.
His brows furrowed even deeper as his jaw clenched in concern. I chewed on the side of my lip as I looked up into my little brother’s eyes. A tear slipped out, falling onto the top of Miracle’s head as he settled between my legs. I rubbed at his ears to give me time to breathe.
“What are you going to do?”
He whistled, “Damn, boy, you’re just askin’ for a whoopin’!”
She fit. Crazy extremist out to save the planet by killing those that do harm to mother earth.
Castiel marveled at the way the hunter trembled under his touch. Wanting more of a reaction, the angel slid his other hand around to the small of Dean’s back and pulled him even closer. Like he hoped, the shivering became more apparent. Instinctually, Cas rolled his hips rubbing their cocks together. Dean was still too embarrassed to look at the blue eyes drinking him in and decided to hide in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder, letting out a low groan of pleasure.
He explained, “Jacob is a controlling ass hole. Quick to anger and even quicker to lash out. Nearly got himself arrested a few weeks ago by that girl that keeps protesting to deaf ears.”
The angel paused, completely naked, in the doorway. He turned to look over his shoulder at the blonde hunter and smiled softly, “To get something to clean us up.”
“So, you going to ride out with me or not?”
Still overwhelmed by the shock of what had just come over my body and flashed through my mind, I nodded. His blue eyes were all that I could see. All I could feel was the gentle brush of his trench coat against my hand. When did we get so close? This would usually be the time Sam would come out of nowhere and interrupt us.
Castiel’s chest felt tight. This man, this righteous, good, man, wanted him. Him. A fallen angel. Someone undeserving of that kind of affection.
like I was a thousand miles away…my apologies, Miss Moore.”
Finally, Sam came over, looking about ten years older.
Cas finally met my gaze again, the lost look in his eyes pulling at a place deep in my chest. I knew full well what he meant about the loyalty. Dean had never said as much himself, but I could see it in his face when he thought no one was paying attention. Hell, sometimes I thought so too. We had dragged an angel down from heaven, away from family, away from paradise.
“Wait, about a month, month and a half ago, I was picking up litter at the turnoff by the dam. I was back behind some bushes when I overheard an argument between the construction manager and some woman. He was being a real jerk, talking about how their relationship was about nothing but pleasure and that he had to get back to reality and his wife.”
As Dean shoved the book back, the tired man blinked down once before blinking up at the shorter of the two and asking, “You any relation to a Burt Aframian?”
He nodded, the muscles of his jaw clenching ever so slightly.
Jack was abruptly next to Charlie who let out a screech of surprise. While Stevie comforted her, I grabbed Jack by the arms and turned him so he faced me sternly. My mouth opened and closed but still no sound came out. A combination of all the yelling and the choking had rendered me completely mute.
Realizing what he was doing, Dean slowly released his brother after a long pause and warned, “Don’t talk about her like that…”
His breathing hadn’t changed all that much. He looked mostly calm aside from the tension in his brow. I kept my eyes glued on the road after that. Guilt started to creep into my thoughts, causing my hands to tighten around the steering wheel until my knuckles were white.
The small Latina woman shot up from her chair and nearly dove head-first into a filing cabinet. After a moment she withdrew two files and slapped them down on the desk before us. Nervously running her fingers through her hair once more she explained, “I already told you a little bit about the victims Thomas Waithe and Gail Heavensby, both went missing, then turned up dead from blunt force trauma, and both had on weird collars.”
I needed to finish what I was trying to tell him. It was important. But I was too far gone. Silently, the angel stood and gently tugged me to my feet. It was like my dead-drunk ass didn’t weigh anything. He slowly led me toward the closest of two twin extra-long beds. It was a relief that the acrid smell of sick was fading.
Heat rising to my face, I ducked my chin toward my chest and grumbled, “I don’t think it’s safe for us to go back to the motel. Whoever our Druid is, knows that we’re looking for her, and this is a small town. Won’t take them long to figure out we’re the “FBI” that’s been going around asking questions.”
“No,” Sam answered instantly. His life was here, in Stanford, with Jessica.
“Yeah, here for spring break from Bellingham.”
“Yeah, well,
The sun beat down intensely, warming the dirt road going through the center of town. It made the smell of horse manure even more intense.
. I really didn’t want him so close. Couldn’t handle it. I dodged his touch, trying to play it off by adjusting my hold on Sam.
Helena woke up shortly after and joined us in the kitchen. She checked me over while Cas pulled up surveillance footage that Officer Oblonsky emailed. Dean cooked bacon and eggs, acting uncharacteristically quiet. She still looked a little shaken by the fact that the man she’d been talking to only yesterday had been turned into a dog.
Special thanks to Zee and Ilene Swartz for their wonderful comments!! Both of you lovelies made school a little more bearable!
“Back off Gigantor!” she hissed, recoiling from him. When she caught sight of me closing in, she sneered, “You and your partner here can shove your fake concern right up your asses! I know what government types like you care about and its definitely not little people like us.”
Nervously, he shoved the gun back into the depths of the drawer and turned to face her. Not wanting others in the house to hear, he guided her by her elbow further into the room and closed the door. Not quite ready to look at her, Sam strode over to a dark lamp and busied himself with lighting it. He was trying desperately to think of an excuse that didn’t reveal too much about what he was about to do.
“Why you say that?”
“No, just uh, a regular re-vamp of the local dam that the town was built for.”
Sam looked down at him and shook his head before turning to Castiel, “Can you watch him? I got a call from a hunter on the way out asking for some help with a vamp.”
I blinked in surprise, suddenly only able to focus on his pursed chapped lips.
. He panicked, glancing at the dark-haired man’s face.
“What about Blaze of Glory?”
Getting a firm grip on the drunk Winchester, Castiel turned to Sam standing close by and asked, “Where did you find him?”
“Hippie spring breakers,” I grinned. “Why can’t they be normal and get regrettably drunk and naked and make stupid decisions like the rest of society?”
The sheets were cold but the two bodies lightly touching were electrified. For a while, Dean lay curled at the edge of the bed furthest from Cas. It reminded the angel of a cat. First, they test the environment, checking to make sure nothing will surprise them. Then, once they are comfortable, they move in closer and closer until eventually they are in your lap. When Castiel continued to remain still and calm, Dean rolled over and studied him, still keeping his distance.
I watched the subtle lines of his face deepen as the fear that had been so plain on his face slowly transitioned into betrayal. His eyes that were a gem-like color blue glimmered with a fire that reached where I stood rooted to the spot. My blood chilled at the sight of the warrior angel looking down at me like I was less than dirt.
There was nothing I could say that could comfort him. So, I settled with resting a heavy hand on his shoulder in solidarity. Meeting my gaze unflinchingly after a moment he said, “I hope you find whoever is responsible for this.”
“When Thomas was brought in and I was doing my initial examination I thought that some of the malformations on his body were due to the trauma he sustained,” she explained, a light sheen of sweat developing on her brow. “But when Gail was brought in, I saw more of the same.”
Casting my eyes away I mumbled, “Because I know I can be more of a monster than most of the things I hunt.”
Chewing on a piece of jerky as he crossed the street toward the hotel, Dean squinted against the late afternoon light. The unusual autumn heat was driving people inside. In fact, the only ones who remained on the baking street was Dean hurrying through the dust, and a small posse under an awning near the hotel. Dean’s chewing slowed as he took in the look they were giving him. He’d been around enough people to know the look of a Beta eyeing an Omega.
After ducking inside a shifty looking pawn shop, I strode back to the Impala and noticed Castiel standing next to the hood of the car gazing unseeing in the direction of the ocean. It was turning into a grey day. Formless clouds spread across the sky, blocking out the warmth of the sun. It made the smaller man look paler than ever. I couldn’t help but think that the angel looked sad in this light, refreshing the deep sensation of guilt I knew both my brother and I shared.
?” she asked, brows nearly disappearing into her hairline as she tugged the small bag free.
She bobbed her head, glancing at the silent man across from me before hurrying off. Adjusting the place settings and condiments on the table to make room for researching, I shot another look at the unmoving man in front of me and commented, “Worrying isn’t going to make him come back any sooner, Castiel.”
He fell to his knees. A long howl of agony ripped from his chest as his brain sluggishly started processing the grotesque display.
Whatever reservations Dean had about telling the man above him, they quickly disappeared as he felt the vibration of his voice run through his body as they lay practically chest to chest. His thoughts and inhibitions vanished as he pulled the angel down and crushed their lips together once again.
"I can't just leave you out here, Dean, we don't know what's out here-"
I paused briefly and snuck a look at him. His whole body took up the doorway. But it was his face that really caught my attention. He had that trademarked Sammy look going on.
I grunted in agreement, keeping my eyes closed.
“We could try and contact Rowena.”
Dean’s anger wilted a bit at that, but he still kept his serious hunting face on. After a moment he cleared his throat and addressed Castiel, “Will witch-killing bullets do the trick, or do we need something else for druids?”
The wing that curled around Dean looked charred and ripped to shreds. It instantly put into perspective just how traumatic falling from heaven must have been for him and the other angels. Castiel lay behind my brother, eyes closed, oblivious to the gruesome sight of his once magnificent mangled wings.
Looking a little dower, he shut his notebook with a light click. I asked silently what his deal was with the quirking of my brow. Letting out a breath he explained, “There’s uh…there’s no motel. The only way to stay around here is to either camp or rent a house.”
Calling over to Helena, I said that we’d meet her back at her house. She acknowledged me by nodding absently, concentrating hard on the task in front of her. I didn’t bother saying anything to Sam. Either he had passed out from the pain or wanted to. Silently I wished for him to be alright, turned on my heel, and led the way out.
“Too many promises have been made and broken.”
Dean chuckled, “True. Couldn’t tell a possum from an ass, most of ‘em.”
Still looking unconvinced, he dug into his back pocket and produced one of the walkie talkies that Eddie gave us earlier. Pressing it into my hand he said firmly, "I'll be back as soon as I can."
“Bobby?”
The Empty practically vibrated with anger. She clenched and unclenched her fists as she paced in front of us. But we didn’t get turned into pink mists or scalped. Was this actually working? I shot Sam a nervous look but didn’t speak.
To give Dean (and us) time to think, I took Cas back up to town and pulled in at the diner. I sent Dean a text saying we’d be waiting for him there.
He looked down at me in surprise, but after a brief once over of my attire he guessed who I might be. Swallowing hard he answered with a nod. Before I could start in on any questions, he held up his hand and said, “Listen man, I already told the police all I know.”
Coming up to his side, I wrapped my hand around the spine and muttered reassuringly, “Don’t worry, this’ll only hurt for a second.”
His lips drew together in a thin line of displeasure. It drew out a small chuckle as I motioned to the area around us and continued, “C'mon Sammy, there’s no way we can pass on camping in Middle Earth.”
“Exactly what I was thinking.”
Blinking slowly, as if he hadn’t realized what he was doing, he turned around.
fine.”
Without a word, Dean wrapped his fingers around Cas’ length. The dark-haired man gasped, one of his hands instantly going up to grip the shoulder with the mark he’d left. For a split second the hunter was afraid that it would be too foreign a sensation for him to handle. But then the soft skin on the shaft moved along with his grip. His did the same when he masturbated. Not so different.
I collapsed to the floor, noticing that my shirt was stuck to the sweat on my chest and back. Taking a few breaths, I asked, “Then what are you saying?”
“Cas has enough to worry about besides babysitting me.” I cut in, my voice losing some of its intensity as his bloody, choking face flashed into my mind. I attempted swallowing past the thickness that had formed in my throat, but that only made it more apparent. “You should have kept him out of this.”
Narrowing my eyes, I looked around for any sign of it. And there, off to my right next to the tree line, the figure of a pale humanoid slunk away. Sam and I sprinted after it, with Sam getting further ahead as my leg started twinging with pain. As we headed deeper, the sound of the rain storm became muffled, the thick canopy slowing down the downpour, and soon all I could feel was the faint tickle of rain drops as I ran. It made my heavy breathing all the more apparent in my ears.
As soon as Cas’ name passed his lips, I was out of my chair. Looking around frantically I asked, “Where is he?”
Hesitantly, he met my gaze and muttered, “I know. I’m just…scared.”
“They get a craving for frog legs?” I asked, trying to divert my anxiety with humor.
“Sam?” I called, ignoring the sensation of my throat thickening with worry.
I popped the modified cassette into the deck and double-checked Charlie’s wiring was still connected to the speakers. As I turned over the engine and cranked the volume, I grinned, “It’s one of the songs on the mixtape I gave Cas…
I could feel Dad’s hot breath on my neck as he hissed, “
“Ivan?” Helena squeaked from the living room.
“Where’s Dr. Fuentes?”
“Yeah,” Sam nodded. “We’ll check in with you later on today.”
That seemed to get his attention, but he surprised me by shaking his head and saying, “Look, I’m sorry, but I need to go and look for a friend. She should have been back by now and I’m getting a little worried.”
“It seems the witch might be a druid.”
I snarled, baring my teeth as I came to a stop between him and my brother.
Dean, Mary and Jessica also came to visit. First it was just them, but slowly but surely, they started families of their own. Holidays were loud and full of swearing, laughter and booze. One particular winter when everyone was crammed into my house, Mary found me on the porch. She took a seat next to me and asked why I’d never gotten married.
Finally, I pulled back with a gasp and sat shaking, clammy, knowing that the partly digested alcohol that had just made a reappearance was going to make my throat hurt like a bitch in the morning. The smell of fresh bile was enough to make me want to throw up again, so I leaned away from it, noting that Cas was still there, arms ready to support my weight.
The pair flicked their reigns and turned their horses west.
It was an uneventful ride. Sam and Maggie both got a kick out of sticking their heads out the open windows. I was happy to oblige. Partly so I could make fun of Sam, and partly so I could air out the smell of dog. After the first 8 hours, I pulled over and handed driving duty to Castiel. First, I called Jodie and explained the situation, then I got comfortable in the back seat and closed my eyes as we coasted along I-25 through Wyoming.
Dean tugged at the handcuffs on his wrist. They were good ones. He wouldn’t be able to slip them. Chuckling smugly the Sherriff said, “New double-lock design from Tower Handcuffs. Ain’t gonna shim out of those.”
He paused as if he too realized that he was petting his grown brother’s head, but resumed when he saw me close my eyes. After a moment he grumbled, “Don’t worry, we’re almost there.”
Dean stepped around the dead horse, shooting the Sherriff a questioning look.
“That’s not what I’m saying.”
Once inside and situated at one of the lonely booths near the back window, I pulled out my laptop. Might as well get started on the case if we had to wait around. The waitress nervously asked if we wanted to get started with some waters. She was young and seemed new to the job.
“What do they talk about?” Sam asked instantly, interest perked.
Deeper and deeper we went into the North Cascades National Park, frightening the occasional bushy tailed squirrel or bright-eyed bird from the bushes that lined the path as we went. After an hour we rounded a corner carved alongside a boulder the size of a house and saw the metal structure over the rise, the Fire Tower that Eddie had mentioned. From here I could spot brightly clothed specks scattered in the clearing around the base that I assumed were the hikers that had been attacked. So far nothing strange, but there was so much land out there. I just hoped these kids would be able to give us something useful.
The arm wrapped around Dean’s waist tightened as Sam struggled to get the shorter of the two to stand on his feet. With a frustrated grunt he grumbled, “C’mon, Dean. Help me out here.”
I raised my brows at ‘bastard’, asking silently for elaboration. The old man twiddled his thumbs, the sound of his rough skin scraping together illustrating how uncomfortable badmouthing not only his boss but also a missing man was for him. As he paused, I could see all the bad memories welling up.
The Sherriff does. Clearly in a sour mood he snarled, “And who are you?”
“You the ones been killin’ my people?” A familiar leather-bound notebook slammed onto the desk next to the Sherriff as he stood and asked, “
A subtle snap of a twig perked my ears. I turned to it, the light of my flashlight illuminating the figure of my Dad, making my heart stutter. He stood looking exactly like he did the last time I saw him, with a hand raised to block the blinding light of my flashlight.
Pinching at his brow like speaking to me was physically paining him he said, “I don’t understand why you won’t just let me heal you.”
We worked for hours. It wasn’t complicated. Mostly duct taping a bunch of stuff together onto carts and backpacks. Lastly, I strapped a couple speakers onto Baby’s roof (after a quiet apology to her). With Charlie’s help, she was able to get my cassette to play on a loop after some clever B side recording and blast out of said speakers. We all stood in the garage where all the cars were parked and tricked out to the nines with anything and everything.
“No, no, we can stop,” Dean said. “Get off the road for a bit, stay at a motel, grab something to eat…”
She died in a fire when he was four-years-old, and Dean will always feel partially responsible for a reason that Castiel doesn't know. With the information he now knew about John Winchester, he suspects that the fire that killed Mary and displaced the Winchesters wasn't an accident and was most likely started by John to covered up the murder of his wife.
“I am!”
Every couple has their own dance for when their significant other has been out of town for a few days. For some, it's the silent and happy acknowledgement that their partner is there, and for others they’re inseparable and all over each other. Thanks to Dean, they were the latter. He always craved attention from Castiel when they were apart and he was usually the one to initiate things. The house always seemed to be achingly empty and Castiel didn't know if Dean felt the same way about that or not.
Castiel pulled off momentarily but was still positioned on his lap, so close but so, so far that Dean thought he might die.
“Yes, you will! You're almost 40, you're too old for this shit!”
“No, Dean, you're really not.”
“Yeah, but nothing other than that!”
“You've burned bodies, Dean!”
“I can't wear a mask,” Dean said softly.
The moment he stepped into the door, Castiel could sense that something was off. The smell of peppers and meat cooking on the stove overtook his senses and he guessed that Dean was preparing something special for their anniversary. As he walked through their home, he noticed that things were of place. Some of the pictures were hanging crooked on the wall and some were missing all together. He quickly overlooked this when he spotted a vase with a small bouquet of roses and he smiled, picking up his pace to get to Dean faster. Hearing that Castiel was in the room, he turned and swept him up in his arms. Castiel immediately wrapped his arms around the back of his head, pulling him closer and Dean kissed every inch of his skin that was within reach.
“Dean, Dean, I can't be mad at you for that,” he said. “It's not your fault. None of it was your fault.”
“Alright, I won't,” Dean said softly. “I'll stop. I can get a job somewhere to help with everything.”
Dean sat up on the bed and blinked in surprise. Not that Castiel didn't know what to do to get Dean to sign off on certain things, but this was definitely out of character for him. When Castiel came back in, he plopped himself down on the bed and turned off the light. A quick kiss on Dean’s cheek and Castiel wrapped himself up in all of the covers.
Fifteen minutes passed and Gabriel still wasn't back yet. It might have been the small space or the fact that Castiel couldn't sit down, but Castiel couldn't stay there any longer. He quickly made his way back outside and looked around. Most of the crime scene was washed away by now, not that there was much to begin with. The killer they were dealing with was quick and efficient and never left any evidence behind.
“It’s very interesting. But I won’t bore you with the details.” Castiel says before finishing his paragraph.
“I love you too.”
“Yeah, but I live around the corner and was looking to party. You know how it is.” He picked out a beer from the cooler and opened it with a nearby opener.
“It’s a little loud, but I’m good as well.” He gave her a tight lipped smile.
“Bitch”
“Sounds like you helped her figure some shit out.” He said to her, she laughed more. “Hahaha, yeah I guess I did.”
“Dean truth or dare.”
“Is everything okay?” Dean asked his brother worriedly.
“Last time I saw him he said he wasn’t, that’s all.”
“Everything I know is a lie.”
“It was our movie!” She said, exasperated. “Okay, we’re gonna watch something else. Something that doesn’t have to do with Gilda.” Castiel decided, turning off the movie.
“Yes, but it is your home.” Dean liked the way he phrased that. Dean usually just called it his apartment. So did Sam and Charlie. But Cas calls it his home. It’s nice.
“Hey,” is all he says.
“I’d like to see you try, feathers.”
“Same.”
He’s still thinking about his first class though, there’s just a concept that isn’t sticking.
“He’s not even gay Charlie, plus he’s my roommates brother.”
Dean sighs and throws his phone back onto his couch. He had put on an acdc shirt and pajama pants after his shower, so at least he was comfortable. And not smelling of grease anymore. That’s always a plus.
“Slept with someone younger than me.” Charlie put a finger down and Dean drank.
“You seem surprised?”
“So you haven’t met anyone you like?” She asks. Dean thinks about it for a moment. Deep down he feels like there’s someone, on the tip of his tongue. He knows the feeling of contentedness he’s been feeling lately, it’s one he gets when he’s around someone he likes a lot. But he can’t figure out who it’s related to. Or if it even is attached to a romantic feeling. It could just be happiness with his job, or living alone, or his friends. He’d never had any of those before, so maybe they have the same feeling.
“Yes, I’m a majoring in world religions.” Castiel answered as he put his little belongings away.
“You can go ahead and sit down, I’m gonna put this away.” He gestures to the shirt in his hand before walking to his room. He normally would just toss the shirt on the table or couch, but Cas strikes him as a classy guy.
“Rough Morning?” A girl sitting next to him asked. She had long brown hair and bright brown eyes. Her voice was kind of sultry, low and a little rough.
It was one of the things that drew him to her, how similar they were. He’d never met someone he related to. He was always the weird kid, out of place. Dean was the cool one, and Sam was weird and out of place.
“And Kaylee?”
“Stop stop, who knew you had abs dude!” Dean walks around the couch to where Cas was. Dean lifts pulls up the bottom of the t shirt to see Castiel’s stomach. Cas is almost certain sober Dean wouldn’t do this. He didn’t really mind though.
Thanks Deano!
“I’m Hannah, it’s nice to meet you.” They shook hands and she left talking about her friends.
“Sorry, yes I am ready for this western film that you love.” Cas amends his previous statement and Dean gives him a satisfied smile.
“Heh, yeah it went well.” Sam thought for a moment, something didn’t add up.
His face almost heats up at the memory. The dark room and the soft blanket, and the warm body next to him. He wasn’t ashamed of what he said. He trusts Cas. Weirdly enough, he does. But he isn’t a fan of being vulnerable, and he definitely was last night.
“Uhm... yeah. It’s Dean, I think.”
Mary was buried in Lawerence, Kansas when Dean was four. House fire. John then dragged his kids across the country, he was a marine so he was relocated pretty often. He was discharged two years ago, and decided to move back where they lived before the accident.
“No! Excited is good. I’m excited too.” She smiled like Sam was the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen. He was almost wonderstruck that he was able to make someone feel that way. He hoped his face read the same to her. Because she is the most beautiful person he’s ever seen. He wanted to engrave this moment in his head and keep it forever.
“No that was the old lady. This guy is new, he’s young too. Our age I imagine.”
“Yeah I guess so. We really only hung out that one time. But he’s a cool dude.”
The morning after he asked Jess out he noticed Castiel coming in late the next morning. Which he knew was coming, Castiel had told told him yesterday after all.
“I’m only one year older than most seniors! Same age as any senior who took a gap year.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, Benny?” He takes a risk with the name but the other man smiles slightly and nods.
“My friends are all living with their significant others, I’d only be a third wheel I’m afraid.” Dean seemed to accept this answer and let Castiel finish his packing with out any more questions.
“And I had a one time hook up with a woman named April, it was a while ago.” He remembers April almost fondly. It was his first time with anyone, and he was incredible nervous. He was eighteen at the time, which he’s aware is considered late nowadays, but he grew up sheltered. April was nice and they had a good time, but she kind of kicked him out the next morning, rudely.
Sam was almost late to class. Emphasis on the almost. He slid into the classroom a minute before class started, which meant he had the honor of sitting in the last open seat. He hurriedly unpacked all of his things before the professor started talking.
“You’re at a college party? Sam said you didn’t go here?” Castiel asked him, trying not to sound rude.
The light rustling of the papers keep him from sinking too far off. He’s tired and a little confused. They’ve been studying for a couple hours now. Every once and a while they take breaks to talk or they’ll ask a group question.
“You called me that earlier.” Dean raised his eyebrows. “No one has called me that.”
Jess slowly moves her right hand so it’s clasping Sam’s left hand. It’s subtle that no one notices, not that they’re keeping it a secret, they just don’t want to make a big deal out of it. He feels a grin spread across his face as he picks his textbook back up. He doesn’t look at her but he can tell she’s smiling too.
He doesn’t need to clean the bathroom much, it’s not like it’s disgusting. But he does clean the drain of the shower and move the bathroom garbage to the regular garbage. That one has a lid on it at least. He also finds a candle Sam bought him once, and lights it up in the living room. He’s used to his own smell, but not everyone is.
”Hm, maybe the fact that you’re a religion major at one of the best schools in the country.”
He debated texting Dean. He is his usual go to whenever he’s confused. But he needs to move away from that now. Not that he was supposed to completely stop all communication with Dean, but maybe lean away from completely depending on him. That’ll take a while though.
Sam laughs and can feel the blush on his face. He’s mostly surprised though, he’d never thought much about his eyes at all.
“She goes on walks with you at night? So she trusts you. Does she ever ask you to hang out first? Or is it always you?”
“Uh okay take two more shots.” Dean instructs. Cas shrugs and does so. Making sure to line up the salt before and  bite down on the lime wedge afterwards. Sometimes he forgets. He makes a face of disgust, he’s not sure why people like drinking so much.
“A little I guess. I just gave him a confidence boost really.” Dean was being modest. Castiel could tell.
“Hm yeah okay.”
“Alright, same time tomorrow?” Kevin asks without looking up.
“Ugh whatever man. Just don’t sleep with any freshmen, they’re too young for you man.”
His family was really close with his cousins though as well. His cousins Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Hester, and Balthazar. Castiel was only ever close with Balthazar and kind of Gabriel. He and Raphael got into fights constantly though. And Uriel always took his brother’s side of course.
Sam was reading a particularly boring sentence when the light filtering from the barely open window hit her hair in such a beautiful way he couldn’t help himself from watching. Her slightly curled blonde hair seemed to gleam golden. It was shimmering and bright. Sam could’ve sworn it was woven silk.
Last time he had someone over was two weeks ago. A woman named Lydia, she was a tall and beautiful blonde. She was really cool too, they actually talked before they slept together. Which wasn’t something that happened often for Dean. She was cool, he wonders if he still had her number.
“Nothing, just uh, can you come over?” Sam sounded fine, but the way he was talking was weird to Dean.
“Oh don’t worry about me. My girlfriend and I kind of broke up, but it’s fine really.” She averted her eyes like she didn’t want him to see she was sad.
“Why’d you ask if he was seeing someone though?”
“Cas?” Charlie whispered to Castiel while laughing. He gently slapped her shoulder.
He glances at his phone. It reads 6:38. Man he took a long shower, he thought. He doesn’t have any texts from Sammy or Cas. Though Charlie’s name pops up after a minute of Dean checking his email.
“Dude, come on. I had a long day at work, what’s up?” Dean did sound tired, and now Sam felt kind of bad for dragging him over here.
Cas sits down in his signature seat on the opposite side of the couch. He takes his shoes and coat off and puts them neatly beside him.
Sam had never seen Castiel smile like that. If he didn’t know better he’d say he was... blushing? And Dean called him Cas?? Sam would definitely ask Dean about that later.
A few weeks had passed. Sam and Jess had gone on a few dates at this point, it was going really well from what Sam could tell. Though he didn’t really have much experience.
“Sam! Hey man. What are you doing out here?” She asked, pausing her music.
Once they’re out of the building and into the fresh air she takes in an over the top deep breath. Sam grins at her theatrics, and she starts swinging their hands between them. He mostly just lets her drag his hand but he contributes a little.
Cas was pretty confused on why this was such a surprise to Dean. Cas was stressed pretty much all the time, every once in a while he needed to relax. It’s perfectly normal.
“It’s nice to meet you both.” Castiel said, not quite letting go of Dean’s hand. He eventually moved away to start putting his things away.
He trusted Cas though. He trusted him not to judge his family situation, or his confusion with his sexuality. Which he only acknowledged with a few drinks in his system. He also trusted that the conversation would stay between them.
“Hey Jess,” he says afterwards.
“I’m sorry, did you need something?” Dean tries to say politely. Benny doesn’t seem to notice the tone that comes with his words.
“It’s not targeting if it hits two people,” he says before sipping his drink. Cas’s jaw drops slightly before closing it. Charlie holds her hand out to high five and Dean bashfully hits her hand with his.
“Why don’t you come over to my place then? I can show you one of those westerns that you somehow haven’t seen.” Castiel’s heart seems to pick up without his permission. He smiles slightly, trying not to give away how exciting that would be to him.
He talked to this other freshmen named Kevin, but they really only studied together. Poor guy seemed stressed 24/7, Sam could’ve sworn he saw him chug Tylenol at some point.
“Dean, dad said to not come home. I took everything.” Sam said, trying not to show how sad he really was. Yes, his dad was a major asshole, but part of him still wanted his admiration and approval. He hated that he still cared about him at all, especially after everything he put him and Dean through. But he did.
“Okay tough guy, can you order us dinner or something? I don’t think beer and tequila counts as a protein.” Cas laughed and nodded. He slowly stood up, took a moment to get his bearings, and called the nearby pizza place.
“Oh geez, give me a second to count.” He proceeds to mouth names that Cas can’t read. “I believe it’s in the thirties, but I can’t pinpoint an exact number.” Charlie whistles in amazement.
“Hey Charlie,” he waved at her but kept looking at Castiel. “Hey Cas, whatcha doing here?”
“Sorry. Wait, flex real quick.” Cas does so and Dean jabs him again. This time only meeting muscle.
“Nah, those are just one time things. They know that too, so we’re all good there.” Dean explains. He always feels like he has to explain that the women he sleeps with are aware it’s a one time thing. He doesn’t want people assuming he goes around breaking people’s hearts. He never would intentionally hurt someone like that.
“Dean your heart is closer to the center of your chest.” He takes Dean’s hand and moves it to where the heart is by sliding their hands together across his chest.
Maybe that can be solved another day.
Hannah looked at Dean like he had come out of nowhere.
“No it was my fault,” Castiel offered to her. She smiled kindly at him. Castiel thought that she was very beautiful, and she was a very nice woman. He hoped that Sam was treating her well, though she would most likely not stand any bad treatment, she was tough like that. He doubted Sam would be though, he’s a polite young man.
Yeah Cas told me, really don’t worry about it
“Dare.”
“Thanks Sam,” Kevin says as soon as the coffee is within his reach. Sam hands him the one that he ordered and then gives Brady his. Then he settles back into the couch next to Jess. She smiles at him when she looks up from her text book. He smiles as well, and his chest feels all fluttery and light again.
“Well, she’s an art major and her desk is already covered in various art supplies. She has a bunch of her works spread across our room, and they’re really weird. They’re like, depictions of biblical stories? I don’t know, they’re graphic and almost sad?” Sam looked at the ground with his eyes scrunched up.
They were thick and black, with highlights of rainbow, just to stick it to his family again. Not that any of them had seen this. Being devout Christians, they were opposed to tattoos.
“Dude, you can take your shoes off.” Dean says as he enters the room, he climbs over the back of the couch and sits next to his friend.
“Oh, thank you. It’s not actually mine, Dean lent it to me.” He pinched the end of the shirt between his fingers, like he was testing the quality of the cloth. Jess gave him a knowing smile, though Cas wasn’t sure what it was she was smiling about.
“Dare.”
“Huh, I gotta say the time I tricked my way into a club by flirting with the bouncer. Guy was ginormous and here I was, tiny little gay red head, who just snuck in. It was a high class club too, and I was seventeen.” Dean nodded in approval, Cas shook his head in amusement.
He grabbed a beef for himself and Hannah, he wasn’t sure what she wanted but supposed she wouldn’t care much if she didn’t specify.
Dean seemed to think it was going well, though he’s also not the best person to ask about romantic relationships. The man has only dated like two people, though Sam was almost certain there was a third Dean didn’t tell him about.
“Sam’s older brother, the one I talked to at the party a couple weeks ago.”
“So what is your essay going to be on?” Hannah asked him as they opened up their laptops.
“That sounds awful, but okay fine.” Dean stands and spins fast three times and slower the next, and slower the next. He almost falls over but manages to keep his footing.
“Order for Sam?” The barista calls out. Sam pulls his hand away from Ruby’s and moves to collect his three drinks.
Cas and Dean looked and each other with a ‘why not?’ Look. They both shrugged and agreed.
“No, an acquaintance. I don’t want to sound arrogant, but she’s liked me for a while. Even though I’ve made it clear I don’t feel the same.” Dean laughed at him. Castiel tilted his head again.
The room was small, his roommate’s bed was only a few feet away from his own, and their desks were only three feet from the end of their beds. It had a weird boxy ceiling and an ugly shade of tan painted on the walls. Sam didn’t mind any of that though. He was excited even. His whole life he’d moved around with Dean and his dad. And yes, they settled down the past two years in Kansas. But Sam never felt at home anywhere. Most likely because he’s always lived with his dad, with his harsh words and hot breath that crowded the back of his neck as John yelled.
“That’s alright, didn’t mean to keep you.”
“Yeah, he’s a senior actually. That’s about all I know about him.” Sam pushed his brother off the bed so he could make it with sheets.
“I’ll do truth again.”
Cas finishes cleaning up, since he is most clear minded right now. He turns all the lights off, so the room is only illuminated by the moonlight. It barely appears in the room, just peaking through the curtains that were haphazardly closed.
“Charlie, Princess Bride? Right now?” He asked her, taking off his coat.
“Yes, we’ve been Marathoning Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel with Dean these past couple weeks.” Cas says as he packs an overnight bag.
“What do you guys wants?” He asked them.
“Go ahead, I’m quite fond of it now. I’m having a fine day, I’m supposed to go over to Charlie’s again today.”
“Oh come on Cassie, he’s nice. You know, he might even be gay...” Castiel looked at her.
“Yes it’s a favorite of all of us. I believe today we are playing a drinking game to Season two of Angel, there’s a rough patch in there.” He chuckles to himself as if only he knew what he was thinking.
“What? What do you mean?” Dean asks.
He starts driving after putting on his music, currently in the tape player was The Kinks. “A Well Respected Man” is playing through the impala. And Dean absolutely loves the speakers in his car right now, the way that the sound just rolls around the walls.
“Whoa Cas! I’ve never heard you laugh like that!” Dean exclaims, his eyes wide and bright. Cas just shrugs. He supposes he doesn’t laugh that much, but he never took note of it.
“Yeah same, Anna is a junior so she already has a bunch of friends.”
“Uh hey Cas.” He greeted him back. Cas was putting his stuff away that he had taken with him.
“And remember, be yourself. If she is gonna date you, she should know what she’s in for.” Dean clapped him on the back and said good luck. Then they were both on their way.
Dean and Sam chatted briefly before Dean left Sam to do ‘college things’ as Dean put it. He had found an apartment across from campus, and close enough to the auto shop he’d gotten an interview at. The apartment was shitty, and small as hell. But it had a shower with warm water and WiFi, so he couldn’t really complain.
“Nah, no one special.” He decides. If he tells anyone he has to be sure first. And right now he isn’t even sure what he’d be telling them.
“Sam, he didn’t mean it. You know how he is when he drinks. Of course you can go home.” Dean tried to reassure his brother, though Dean knew that their dad would definitely throw a fit if Sam ever went home. Sam just ignored his brother and continued to put away his clothes in the dresser underneath his bed.
“Truth or dare” he directed at Charlie.
“So I met my neighbor today, the new one.” She said, chewing some popcorn.
“Sammy, you don’t know what that argument was about.”
“Whoa, Cas.” Dean says from across the room. Cas starts to put the shirt on faster, not wanting to make him uncomfortable.
“Can you read this last paragraph for me?” Hannah asked him after a couple minutes. He nodded and they switched computers. He scanned the paragraph quickly, noting the sophisticated way she had of writing.
But Sam desperately wants to tease him for giving Castiel his favorite t shirt. Maybe one phone call will be okay.
“His brother asked him over to our room today to ask for girl advice. Okay? He’s an expert on women or something. He strikes me as the sort of person who sleeps around a lot. Which is fine, but he sleeps with women, not men!”
“So how you feeling Cas?” Dean asked him. Cas slowly looked over to Dean.
“Well did he do anything creepy?”
“I should order, I’ll be back.” Dean says, standing up from the table.
Dean had his first drink when he was ten. John though it was a good birthday present or something. Though Dean was pretty sure he’d just forgotten the birthday all together and just found a beer and decided to give it to him instead.
“Castiel, there you are! I thought you had gotten lost for a moment.” She said, and stood between him and Dean. Castiel put on a forced smile and glanced at Dean briefly. He gave him an impressed face, like he assumed he and Hannah were dating or something.
Which was true. But this was also an opportunity to get away and clear my head. Something I hadn’t been able to do in what felt like forever. I think Cas could kind of see through my motivations though.
Also: big thank you to RDJWINCHESTER1 for putting up a tutorial on how to put pictures on here, you are a life-saver.
“Stop it…”
I nodded, motioning for him to leave it be until there wasn't an audience. He seemed to understand and backed off, scanning the surrounding area as subtly as he could. Isadora worked fast, binding up my ankle and handing me some pills for the swelling and pain. She then helped Sam haul my ass up and over to the four-wheeler. As I was situating myself on the back of Sam's seat awkwardly, I happened to glance over at Isadora who had fallen silent. She stood a few feet away, looking off into the encroaching darkness like she could see something.
classes. Welcome to law school.”
He dug the heels of his boots into the nearby wall and started trying to muscle his way out. Seeing that he was still willing to fight, I did as he wished and sprinted down the hall, but not before scooping up Dean’s gun into my mouth. Just before the door I slowed and crept forward.
My eyes widened. Helena nodded knowingly, snapping a pair of gloves on and striding back to Gail’s body. With a surprising amount of strength, she tilted the body up so we could get a better look at the girl’s back. More bruising and cuts painted an ugly picture of her death. Pointing at the base of her spine Helena said, “It’s hard to see due to the discoloration, but it’s there. And look at this…”
“What did you do?” Castiel asked. “You had to have done something.”
"I never-" Dean stopped himself, seeing Castiel's face. "Alright, baby, I won't.”
“I couldn't let him turn any of that stuff onto Sam, and when I got older, it got easier.”
I am planning on finishing this and all my other spn wips before the series ends. I have about one or two more chapters of this, two sabriel ficlets, and two mentally ill!Gabe sabriel fics so stay tuned
He always took pride in his collection and cleaned everything once a week like clockwork. Sunday for Castiel was waking up to the smell of freshly cooked eggs and burnt coffee. The eggs were always perfect and Castiel learned to avoid the coffee unless he made it himself. Dean always managed to choke down most of it himself, and Castiel gradually poured it down the drain so Dean wouldn't drink too much. Now that Castiel knew why Dean had all those weapons, he wonders which ones he actively used and which were for show.
The response made Castiel roll his eyes but Dean sounded so happy that he couldn't say no to him. They settled into the normal routine of Castiel researching the case he was working on and Dean preparing dinner. A pained noise caused Castiel to rush into the kitchen. Dean was holding a towel on his hand and Castiel started moving closer. Dean immediately shifted to block him, but Castiel quickly maneuvered around him, trying to see his hand. Dean, stubborn as he was, tried to move away again and Castiel grabbed his arm to stop him. Blood was covering the towel but the color of it made Castiel’s breath catch in his throat. Dark, almost black blood covered it. They both froze for a moment, wanting to see what the other would do first.
A quick scan of the parking lot turned up nothing until Castiel caught a glimpse of a security camera on the building across the street. He looked around then quickly crossed the street and went into the building. After a quick chat with the staff, Castiel was sitting at a security desk looking at a TV screen playing last night’s footage. He held down the fast forward button until he found what he was looking for. A man in a black hoodie was rushing towards the street, and Castiel quickly hit the pause button, frowning when it played a little too far. He watched it again, slower time, pausing at an angle where he could see the killer’s face.
“Can we stop for the night?”
“You're taking this a lot better than I thought you would.”
With a quickened pace and some guidance from the police officers who were already there, Castiel made his way through the building and to the security room where Gabriel had been waiting, scowling at a small screen in a room that was strangely devoid of furniture. Castiel had a fleeting thought about why Gabriel was making that face.
“I know,” Dean said. “I know. I'm sorry. But you know I couldn't have told you either. I wanted to, I really did. I hate keeping things from you.”
“You’re starting to sound like Sam,” Dean said with a glance toward Castiel. “You better stop if you wanna share a bed tonight.”
“No! I didn't know anything about that until I caught you on camera! And you weren't even wearing a mask, what the hell were you thinking, Dean? What if someone else caught you? You'd be sentenced to life if you were lucky and you would've been taken away from me!”
The rest of the night was uniform and scripted. He cleaned up and got rid of anything that connected him to the murder. It was routine for him after the years he's invested into his own craft. He easily slipped into his new job, and by morning, he had left town, his soul mate’s phone number still on his arm.
There was a pounding at the door and the first thing Castiel noticed was that Dean wasn't there. He quickly scrambled to his feet and did a sweep of the room to make sure that everything was in place before he opened the door. A quick glance out the window confirmed that the impala was gone. There was a team of armed officers at the door, and Castiel was quickly shoved aside. One by one, the officers swarmed the room, searching for something.
Soul mates tended to become close and quickly attached, but this wasn't a normal bond. Dean was a serial killer, and Castiel had accepted it easily and handed information over to him withour hesitation. He'd be lucky if he got away from this without any criminal charges. When a man in a neatly pressed suit finally entered the room, Castiel knew what he was going do to. He had to give up Dean.
They both stared at each other for a little bit, Castiel trying to be soothing and reassuring and Dean was watching him carefully to judge his reaction.
“Eight.”
“Sure thing, Cas,” Dean groaned softly.
Dean raised his brother Sam by himself.
Dean was 10 the first time he broke a bone.
Anddd it's done! Only mild editing because I want to put the chapter out. Remember, I'm trying to finish the rest of all my spn wips before the series end so expect to see those soon too.
They were both surprised by the sudden outburst and looked at each other. Dean moved closer and gently touched Castiel’s face. They had both been surprised by his sudden flash of anger, however understandable.
“I love you,” Dean said softly.
A few weeks later, Dean crept into their now shared room. It was just past one in the morning, and thud of Dean’s heavy work boots on the floor woke Castiel who instinctively tensed and became suddenly aware of everything going on around them. Dean was standing over the bed, quietly watching him. Normally, he would and rolled his eyes and made a comment about Dean liking the view, but now it just made him shiver and feel sick to his core. The next day, Castiel made arrangements to leave on a case. He knew he'd be gone for at least a week. Even though things in their relationship had settled down, they still drifted apart, both too scared of the growing ache they felt when the other wasn't there.
Castiel Winchester. That's one name he'll have to get used to.
Suddenly, Castiel knew the woman described the killer as an underwear model. It was his fiancé and soul mate, Dean Winchester. Castiel felt a tightness in his chest he never felt before. He played through the video again, knowing he must have missed something. It couldn't be Dean, his Dean. Dean was too kind and caring. He wouldn't take someone else’s life if he wasn't under some kind of duress.
When Dean came crashing home, his car beat up, and his face not looking much better, something shifted again. It wasn't just that Castiel’s stomach twisted at all the possibilities of what happened, but seeing his big, strong Dean hurt just seemed so deeply wrong. So when Dean tossed him a bag and told him to pack, Castiel didn't hesitate.
“You're a serial killer, you don't have a goddamn code, Dean!”
“I know what I'm doing, Cas.”
“Remember the anonymous tip left by a teenage boy that almost led to the killer's arrest?” Dean asked, trying to get him to switch into an empathetic state of mind. “That was me. I walked an hour to get to the gas station I called from, but something tipped Dad off and he grabbed me and Sam and hauled ass out of there. He kept bitching about how we had at least another day and he wanted to take a vacation and that he lost his best hammer.”

“You're thinking too much again,” Dean said. “If you do that, it'll all fall apart.”
-----
“No, I'm done, move.”
“You can't keep murdering people either,” he said, surprised by how calm he was about all of this. “I don't care if they did something or not, you have to stop.”
“Set a date,” Castiel said, making Dean jump a little. “I'll take off work.”
He kept him himself from asking “What did you do?” not wanting to upset Dean any further. He recognized the fragility of the situation, and pushing Dean a certain way wouldn't help. When Dean didn't answer, he had to push again.
When Castiel hung up, Dean stood up a little straighter. He received a quick kiss on the lips from the other man who then grabbed his arm and wrote his phone number on it, apologizing that he had to go so soon. Dean knew he was sincere and just nodded along, having trouble believing his luck. As soon as they met, Castiel was gone and Dean quickly got to his car, hopped in, and drove away, Castiel’s number on his arm.
Dean hummed again and kissed Castiel quickly.
“It's because you know I'm not a bad person,” Dean said softly. “You know I only go after guys that deserve it, the ones that can throw some money at a judge and get off free.”
“I don't even know the people that helped raise you,” Castiel said and pulled off again, making Dean groan in a whole different way. “I don't even know their names.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a shift in the mattress and Dean threw his arm across Castiel’s chest and tugged himself closer. He cuddled up close, pressing his groin against his leg. Castiel rolled his eyes and pushed against him, causing Dean to groan and try again, more persistently this time.
“That's because it doesn't make sense,” Castiel said a little flatly.
“I love you,” he said softly.
“Blanket hog,” Dean mumbled as he turned off the light.
“I never said you didn't.”
Did Dean leave him there? Did he know that he had been found out and leave Castiel behind? That didn't seem like something he would do, but there were a lot of things he didn't know.
Dean loves pie.
“We have to talk, you know that,” Dean said and kissed his neck. “You've been avoiding me.”
“But here you are.” Castiel rolled his eyes so Dean scooted closer to him before continuing. “Cas, if you're thinking, you've gotta talk. I need to know what's going on in that head of yours.”
