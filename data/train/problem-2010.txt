John waited, chest puffing out after seeing the upturn of a bit of a smile in the corner of Sherlock's mouth, and DI Dimmock shrink just a bit. There was an awkward silence that was broken by a wail.
"Sherlock, people hardly ever do what you expect," He smiled, "Do you want to talk about the case? How we're doing to pull this off, or what we're going to do? Do you still want to go through it, with me?"
He doesn't dare get up until he knows, senses, she is long gone. It may be minutes, hours, days; but he only gets up when the ringing of the gun cocking isn't so loud in his ears.
After calling into the morgue, Mycroft texted one phrase to John and Sherlock: 'Levl 3 officer P.O.W.'
Sherlock shivered. After William provided John water and honeyed bread, William banked the fire.  John settled them into the cushions, Sherlock resting on his chest. John wrapped his plaid around him as a cover.
Sherlock looked John over, from his bright blue eyes to his blonde, silvery hair. Normally assertive, he looked terrified. The doctor who went to war, lived through being shot, the doctor who tackled murderers in alleys without a thought, was trembling as he waited for Sherlock's answer.
He's watched over his nation after 9/11. Watched as his brother thwarted a large scale attack on parliament. Put a damper on protests and unrest.
"Hamish!" John sniffed, bending down to look at Hamish more closely, "Why does your room smell so terrible? What have you been doing?"
The speech to Mary was complete. She heard what she needed to hear, and seemed to believe him. He was glad the vest had a back protectant so if she did decide to stab him in the back.
At Jim's intake of breath, the older Holmes brother asks, "Do I have your full trust and cooperation now?"
Sherlock moved his hand to rub John's back, "Yes, we haven't had time to determine how this information benefits Jim Moriarty, or how the agency or insurance links to him, but we've at least come up with something for the investigators to look at."
John Watson shifted, and Sherlock could see his bicep and downy underarm hair just visible in the dark light. He turned his head a bit to give some privacy.
After two ambulances come and pick up the seven bodies, Sherlock and Molly head to St. Bart's.  Together, they will process the information to see what they can glean; they doubt they'll obtain much, if anything. The seven operatives will most likely be off the grid and Mary's work will be untraceable. No marks on the slugs, no fingerprints.
Sherlock nodded, "Every set designer has a particular flair or look that's all their own. Some are the paint palettes they choose. Others are the lines and organization of elements. Your lines are simple, but you add detailed embellishments that will show up beautifully with the accented lighting design. It reminded me of the restaurant."
"I'm not sure. There were pieces of messages and phone calls last night, but he kept talking about Greg-"
They cry, they wrap each other close in one another's arms, they can hardly breathe as they dig into one another. They have waited so long to be close, nothing was ever close enough.
The taxi dropped them off at a two story, brick building. It had been converted to a group of flats. Sherlock mapped the location out in his mind. There were lights on in every flat except one that was on the second floor. As Sherlock was staring, creating a mental map, a black car pulled up. Mycroft and Greg got out of the car. Greg hugged John, and Mycroft squeezed his shoulder.
They fall sleep like spoons in a drawer with John's arm under Sherlock's shoulder. Both of John's arms are reached around his beloved's torso at an angle so that their fingers are laced around each other's.
Sherlock smiled, coming alongside John and lacing their fingers together, "Well, you always look nice, John." A light tone, loving, teasing his name up with an inflection at the end. John responded by giving him a quick kiss on the mouth. After they were dressed, Sherlock took his hand again and led him to the hallway, moving to the end of the deck towards the elevator. The ship was three levels, but all the levels were beautifully decorated. Light blue paint, bronze accents, recessed lighting, ornate carpeting and chandeliers in every large dining room. On the top level was where most of the 900 passengers convened when they weren't in their rooms or on the deck. This floor held a large dining room, a performance stage, and a smaller dining room for the captain and special guests.
John can hear water running nearby. He needs to piss desperately. He goes further into the woods, relieves himself, then climbs deeper and deeper into the wooded area. He's got money in his fatigues, no cell phone, and he's unsure where he's going. He just wants to disappear. Off the radar.
John turned and reached up on his toes to kiss Sherlock's mouth. They'd been apart for what felt like months, as all the packing and moving had left them exhausted. Sherlock whispered mischievously into John's ear, "He's asleep," and pulled John into their bedroom. John's belly heated with the thought that they had a bedroom, together, where their clothes hung side by side, where they had their slippers underneath the bed, and their end tables contained accessories that they didn't dare want Hamish to get into.
Sherlock finally shook Tavis free, straightening out his plaid. Jaime laughed, "He's giving you a speech just like your Ma would when you would get into one of your sulks."
They tangled together, rolling on the bed, kissing. Sherlock had to help John when his arm got caught under Sherlock's body, which threw John into a fit of giggles. John took a long look at his husband's body. He was lithe and gorgeous, beautiful hips and an amazing neck, and he wanted him but he was unsure how he could have him.
John returns to the flat, exhausted. Moriarty is listed as dead. Again. (Jesus, how many times are people killed, commit suicide, then come back to life around here?)
"John!" Sherlock commanded. John stopped moving, "I just told you. You're my betrothed. We are going to see each other undressed eventually. Let me help you."
Hamish put his pencil down, turning so he could look at John and Sherlock, "How do you know when you love someone?"
His love of his life, who he excruciatingly helped plan the wedding of, was on a sex holiday with another woman. The doctor on sex holiday was also stupidly in love with Shezza-Sherlock- but was too terrified to admit it. Billy was close to revealing it all (while nursing a squishy wrist) but the lovesick doctor gave him a look of pure, hair-raising, vile contempt.
John thinks that Mycroft also looks as if he's been crying, but John would have to see it to believe it.
"John, I am not always kind, or charming. When I'm running a case for days in a row I'm quite unmanageable. My only friend is a skull named Billy; you may hear me talk to him by mistake. I dare say the reason I'm so agreeable is the rest and the company I've been keeping," As John was trailing kisses down Sherlock's neck, to his collar, Sherlock pulled back, "Slow, remember, Captain Watson?" John straightened up, moving back on the couch just slightly. Sherlock wondered if his lips were as pink as John's were.
"Oh, Sherlock, love. Stay here. Stay here and we'll go back to the theatre tomorrow. You were amazing, you are amazing, my beautiful boy," John kissed him again, drawing hm closer, covering them both up with the comforter. They were sticky and sweaty, but Sherlock couldn't care enough to leave. As John slowly fell into slumber, Sherlock spent some of the night studying him, watching him sleep, cataloging the exact colors of his skin and hair. He was a marvel. He was worth painting.
"Quiet." John looks at Sherlock, keeping his fingers laced on his lap. Sherlock reaches for John's fingers, but John pulls away. Sherlock leans forward, parting his lips, his brow furrowed.
Sherlock had prepared a satchel to conduct a pasture experiment. He figured it would calm his nerves. Before he made it out the door William stopped him, advising John wanted to see him.
"Here is my phone, video chat with him. See for yourself. We are doing this to ensure John and Sherlock's safety. We don't employ your methods, Mr. Jim Moriarty."
passing the video back over so John could watch it. John grinned back at Sherlock, finding the video for
Mrs. Hudson chimed in, "Hamish and I will be fine on our own, we can putter around and get my room set up."
Sherlock inhaled sharply, "I won't pursue treatment, not," His voice broke, this acting was easy, imagining  John choosing anyone else over him, "not without John. Now that...now that it's clear to keep him alive he must stay with you."
Sherlock bounded out of the house, nearly tripping over the first rock outside the front stoop. The rock was painted blue, and tied to it with a white ribbon was a branch of yellow Forsythia and John's first note. Sherlock twisted his braid in his fingers as he read the letter, "Gather the flowers I leave for you and bring them along your journey. Blue, white, yellow are the colors I want you to remember. Blue for the constant storm and wonder in your eyes, your intelligence, your wit. White for your purity, your beauty, your dedication to your family. Yellow for the joy and light you've brought to my life. The moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew I wanted you in my life."
"I was so, so heartbroken after Greg's wedding. I left early. Who leaves a wedding early? I left. I had a friend, a girl, told her I wanted to fuck. Started fucking right after Greg's wedding. That was it. We were just having sex, no relationship, she traveled and her job was her whole world. I'd never been with a woman. I wanted to force myself to be straight, be normal, I was drunk a lot. So fucked up. Her birth control failed, she was pregnant. She wanted nothing to do with the baby, was looking into adoption, but I took him. She severed parental rights. He's mine."
John hooked his chin over Sherlock's shoulder, pulling his front nearly flush against Sherlock's back. Sherlock thought he felt warmer than he naturally should. John's voice and breath were right in Sherlock's ear as he spoke.
Sherlock allowed Tavis to lean him back into the pillows. William was called, and he brought compresses and medicines for pain. They helped Sherlock stand to change his clothing and the bedsheets. Each wave of exertion took three times as long as normal, but the pain medicine eased his discomfort. William was serving Sherlock sips of broth as the evening light filled the room.
"I deduce not," he said in his slow drawl, "His heartbeat and respiration indicate that he cares for, loves, this Seb very much. He will do what it takes to keep him safe from harm."
Sherlock shifted in his lap and John drew in a breath and bit his lip. Desire struck him suddenly, Sherlock's inky curls were irresistible, but he needed to focus.
"You must think me absolutely stark raving mad," John whispered as he pulled away from their kiss, "I've done it all backwards. I have you move in with us, I kiss you, then I'm going to take you out on a date, all out of order, all very quickly."
"Show me," John said, sitting in front of a mirror with lights. He turned his head up to Sherlock, smiling. Sherlock grabbed his stool, and moved extremely close to John, caging him in with his legs, pulling the makeup kit closer, "Ok, when you're doing makeup, the main thing is to extenuate the features. If I'm not making you up to look older-"
John wishes Sherlock were here to share the joke; for now, he has to turn his head and purse his lips.
Sherlock turned, his face pink, his curls sticking to his forehead, "When you first moved in I never thought you'd dare consider me. So I tried to get my nerve up to have sex with other men. I was so wound up I thought I would die. But I couldn't. It was you or no one. So I bought these materials. This red one, reminds me of what I thought you'd look like, engorged and ready."
"Sit, Mrs. Watson," he says, making sure his speaking and breathing patterns are slightly labored, indicating a pressure on his ribs or liver. She doesn't move her eyes from his as she sinks into Sherlock's chair (where Moriarty sat and drank tea).
The radius is evacuated, safety secured. 37 minutes after John and Mycroft leave Baker Street, their team detonates a bomb that blows out most of their flat; keeping most of the structure in tact, but it will be enough to get on the news. Operation 'Evacuation' commences.
"What are you two up to?" John sat down and gave Sherlock and Hamish a hug. Sherlock's arm was over the back of the couch. John put his arm next to his.
John reached up and gave Sherlock a quick kiss on the mouth, "Anything. Everything. But let's take inventory first."
At Mycroft and John's first meeting he'd asked John, "Why would Mary have just happened to come to shoot Magnussen the night you and John were there? Why did she shoot Sherlock, and not Magnussen? Her intent was to kill him, not Magnussen. Who is she working for?"
Setting the envelope aside, he sees a bright red and green Christmas card. On it, in Sherlock's sprawled writing, "Merry Christmas, my love. Read this last."
Sherlock also noticed Greg and John talking amongst themselves, but he tried to not pay attention. He simply did the work as he'd always done it, but he did get John's medical opinion on the cause of death. John determined, with the vomit present on the woman's lips, that there was something more than a gunshot that caused her demise.
"Doctor." is all Mycroft says, putting his phone in his pocket. His eyes search up and down John, deducting, same as his younger brother does. There is no affection, just a sag of shoulders, both worried, both tired. John lowers the elbow, nods his head. No apology.
John and Sherlock dissolved into a fit of giggles. They laid in the bed a few more minutes as they listened to Hamish in his bedroom working with his equipment.
Sherlock puttered around the kitchen for a while, making tea. His phone beeped as the kettle boiled.
"Yes," Sherlock huffs, "you've called at an inconvenient time. Can't you tell by my voice that I've found him?"
John just smiles, then goes over to the car door to open it for her, in a fake gesture of helping her out of the door with her large belly, to guide her to the door of the house to block her view of any line of sight. Operatives on the roof, ready, the moment they walk in the door. He takes a moment to check and see if there are any weapons on her.
Sherlock groaned, and Mrs. Hudson responded by throwing the duvet across the room. He yelped, because he was only in pants, but she grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and hauled  him into the bathroom.
On the way home, John, still pumped full of adrenaline, gave chase himself through the backstreets until they got to Sherlock's flat. They barged in the door, trying but not succeeding in being quiet. John pressed Sherlock into the wall, kissing him deeply, his tongue pushing into his mouth. He pulled back too quickly, and Sherlock nearly fell forward trying to follow his mouth.
Sherlock backs away from his brother as he stands, and returns to John's side. John goes to Mycroft, standing close to him. He knows the answers, but he needs the code, to be sure the plan has not changed.
"Do I seem like I need protection?" Robert's hand twitches, reaches up, then puts it down back on his thigh. Mycroft links his own hands together.
They know that Billy will keep an eye on Mary as she is left with Mummy and Daddy Holmes. Robert squeezes Mycroft's shoulder as he helps him jump through the door, under the swirling winds of the copter blades. They nod sharply, no words, ear pieces in. Mycroft settles into the edge of the front seat. The flight over is tense, Robert has to remind Mycroft to breathe.
Mycroft, expecting another shy smile, or an invitation to sit down, stops short of entering the room completely. Robert is looking at him through lidded eyes. A newspaper is on his desk. He picks it up, shaking it at Mycroft.
After a few minutes of internal debate, he rings Robert, a rather nice man his age that works down the hall in special intelligence. Their work does not typically overlap. They've spoken a few times over the past few months but have increased their communication more recently. Robert had been especially kind to Mycroft about the press concerning Sherlock's drug habit. Robert had revealed he'd has a younger sister with a drug problem.
Sherlock is in the quiet before the storm. He texts Mycroft asking him on Sunday to please bring over a meal and the gift they discussed for John. Mycroft takes longer than normal to respond.
"I hate that woman," she yells, shaking, "Can't you, can't you, drop her out of the window onto some
Sherlock has his forehead on the floor, grabbing at the scrap of fabric around his neck. He is wailing, sobbing, grasping for air.
"I'm going to shoot him. When given the chance. No more Holmes brothers sent away. Your parents all need you home-"
His beloved seanmháthair, the same who'd made his quilt, taught him all the traditional Scottish dances. When he was still knobby kneed, she walked him through wedding dances and celebration partner dances.
He shuffled to his chair, the left side of his shirt sloppily tucked into his pants. Sherlock came over and tucked it in properly with his fingers, placing his hands on John's hips when he was finished. John looked up at him, almost swooning with want. His husband was wearing an outfit he'd seen him wear hundreds of times, a white button down, black pants, black jacket. His pale, marble colored neck and alabaster skin exposed, John rose on his tiptoes to kiss along Sherlock's neck and jaw, for if he didn’t kiss him or touch him
, fingers pinched together and moving towards his mouth. Sherlock tilted his head and stared at John, forehead crinkled. John reached to get his phone to make his meaning clear, but Sherlock stopped him, pulling out his phone first.
Sherlock turned, legs constricted. He was incredibly warm. He pushed his arms to lift himself, but he was trapped. Sherlock thrashed himself back and forth, opening his eyes.
"Are we ready?" John asked, staring directly at Sherlock, "Or am I interrupting your private conversations over there?" John waited. The audience gasped. Everyone turned to look over at Sherlock. Indignant, he waved in a forward sweeping motion for John to carry on. John spoke directly into the microphone, "Apparently, my story is boring to part of the audience. If I cause you to fall asleep you're welcome to find something else to do that is more exciting."
"Love, Sherlock," She stopped on the last syllable of his name, taking his hands in hers, "Is a choice, is a decision. You can be attracted to someone, like a moth to a flame, but to love, that is a decision. An action verb. Greg came with Mycroft last night because he loves Mycroft, and wanted to help him. Mycroft wanted to help his brother. They can, and do, say they love you with words. But they act it out. John acted out love by caring for you. Hamish acted out love by opening up to you. And you may not be able to call it love yet. John may have said things, that he's attracted to Greg, but what do the words matter? What do the actions say?"
"John, John, we can't push you too far. You're still healing, you only finally just got dressed…." Sherlock's voice was swallowed up in a gasp of pleasure as he put his had on John's good shoulder to steady himself as he rocked to the side.
The tartan pattern was dark and could have matched Sherlock's betrothed's, but in the dim light it was hard to be sure.
"Important parts?" John laughed, pulling the kilt up further to reach behind Sherlock to his hole, teasing his finger around the edge of the opening, running around it and over. He was dizzy, hot and thirsty for John's hands on his skin. Every bit of him longed to touch John and be touched by him.
He wondered why Hamish had John's phone. The conclusions he came to were ones he packed away to deal with at another time. For now, he needed to unwind his trail of thoughts regarding the case, as Greg would no doubt need additional information for his write up. He placed the information into his mental file cabinets, ordering them, remembering, placing them to be retrieved again.
Sherlock picked up ther put the note in a fold of his kilt and thought a moment, rolling the short Forsythia branch in his fingers. What did the note mean? Where would he go next? After a few minutes he rembered, the fields that bordered his land and the Watson land. That was where John had first seen Mycroft and Sherlock conducting experiments and had been intrigued with him.
John rolled them, milking both of them until there was nothing left. They laid down, facing one another, the sticky mess on John's hands, their thighs, and bellies. They watched each other, looking into each other's faces, as their breathing slowed and returned to normal.
When John came, Sherlock licked at him, cleaning him up, rolling over him again, but front to front. He kissed his neck, his chest, and ran his fingers through his hair. They fell back asleep, stickier than before, wrapped around one another.
John peeled off the long tartan, wrapping it up as a pillow, bending over to fluff up the straw bed on the floor. Sherlock caught a glance of long, lean muscular thigh from underneath the kilt.
It was a musty shop full of antiques, books, and a cabinet in the front under the register full of loose gems, rings, necklaces, broaches and earrings. The owner looked up from his crossword puzzle when he heard the bell clang above the door.
"No, you don't. But Magnussen is terrifying, more than anyone I've seen, even the bravest, falter when he attacks. He never kills with a weapon, but I've seen him destroy families, marriages, lives."
It was rapidly becoming his favorite fantasy, that Sherlock would say yes to becoming his husband.  Would he be surprised, or embarrassed, or would he be so completely shocked into silence? John felt sure in his relationship with Sherlock, that he would say yes if the timing was right. They fit together so well, he didn't consider a life where they wouldn't be together forever.
"When your daddy puts his head down, bites his lip, or turns away from you, that means he's frustrated by what you're doing. You have to learn to read those signals and change your behavior based on what you're seeing from others."
"Sherlock, they'll make the best decision they can. Let's go back to the theatre and wait for John. I'm sure that's where he will end up."
Sherlock rolled off the floor, turning on the lights. Mrs. Hudson blinked at the sudden bright light. Mr. Hudson began to speak, "You fucking kid-" but the rest of his sentence was cut off when John pistol whipped him.
he would propose. He just needed to work on the other details. They continued kissing, holding onto one another, ignoring Hamish's pleas that "he couldn't possibly process the blood sample with all that noise going on."
Sherlock waited. Looking into John's eyes, his parents standing next to him holding the handfasting cloth, he was unsure what to say. He held John's hands, squeezing them. He took a deep breath.
Sherlock took the phone and laughed, a silent laugh where his shoulders rose up and down and his eyes crinkled. He put the phone down and put his fist in the air, punching forward with an imaginary knife. He mouthed the word 'murder' as he did so. John laughed, taking the phone back.
"Here." John says. Jesus, he sounds tired. He hears Sherlock running across the dirt and gravel, stopping in front of John.
Sherlock sat up, stared at John for a moment, and didn't answer the question, but stated firmly, "This isn't going to work, John."
"Nice to meet you, Lord Watson," Sherlock sidestepped introducing himself, "I hope you'll be comfortable here."
Sherlock felt dizzy from John's attention and praise. He kissed him, grabbing at his shirt, Sherlock laughed, "I just got dressed," and John nibbled on his neck, "I didn't realize you'd look so gorgeous in these clothes."
He feels a swooosh, a pulling, as his arm is pulled down, dangling off the edge of the bed, he feels it being pulled, and held. (Is that a cheek? A hand? A face? A kiss?) His mind begins to climb up from the pits of slumber, bits and pieces begin to fall together. He sees, sitting on the floor, Sherlock with his legs spread out in front of him. He is holding onto John's arm, crying. (Crying?) John doesn't fully understand why or what is going on, he mumbles into Sherlock's hair, his ear.
"I mean it. Every word. I can't wait," Sherlock mouthed into John's neck, pulling him closer for body heat, "I will be honored to be your husband. Tha gaol agam ort."
She adjusts her (fake) belly as she gets into one of Mycroft's many sleek, black cars. She doesn't speak, looking at the country side as they drive past.
"What, my bonnie laddie?" John asked, pulling his body down, finally working towards putting all of himself into Sherlock. Sherlock pushed his arse backwards, forcing John to put his forehead on Sherlock's back, "I've got you, Sherlock. I've got you. You are so lovely. So perfect. Please."
John reaches over to the right side of the bed, reaching for (Sherlock? A pillow? A blanket?) He feels empty air and then realizes he's tumbling off of the bed onto the floor. His backside and hip fall with an enthusiastic thud and he knows he'll have a bruise.
DI Dimmock clenched his jaw and didn't say a word. He jerked his head to the left and began walking away, expecting John and Sherlock to follow. John looked at Sherlock, gesturing for him to come forward. Sherlock had a small smile on his face, and then he gave the sign he'd just learned
John waited. It was a daring move, to come out and say what he was thinking. He was feeling bold, electric, that if he didn't do something to help show Sherlock how he felt he would burst away from his bones.
John pulls back, pushing Sherlock's hair from his eyes, "Sherlock, my love. Where is this coming from?"
Sherlock runs through the battle plans in his head. Mycroft has some last minute changes (not large ones) that he wants to go over on Sunday. Sherlock is almost positive that Mycroft wants someone else to be the one to shoot Magnussen. Sherlock will not allow that to happen. Magnussen has taken too much away from their family. It will be his hand, John's gun. No other outcome will be satisfactory.
Today's wedding, however, could not be avoided. It would involve Sherlock's entire day, and his strict participation. His family was expected to put on a wedding celebration for the eldest brother, Mycroft Holmes, to his betrothed, Greg Lestrade. They had been betrothed for one month, ever since Victoria Holmes had secured the match as the matriarch of the family.
Greg stood there, a love bite just visible below his collar. John raised his eyebrows. Greg growled at him, "Shut it. I've heard your alarm blaring for thirty minutes now. You're ruining my trip. First you yelled about that woman's hot mouth the night before, and now this."
The soldier, the criminal, the sociopath, the assassin; all bound together and driven to insane measures because they're desperately, hopelessly, head over heels.
John makes sure he is calm before he returns to Baker Street. He considers rehearsing his words to Sherlock, but he wants to tell him in the moment. He doesn't want lies between them. John feels guilt gnawing at him, but he reminds himself; these are not lies. These are omissions. These are decisions he and Mycroft are making to keep Sherlock safe.
"Uncle Greg, I have to make sure he's not a psychopath, not that you'd work with psychopaths, but is it ok if he stays with us? He's all alone?"
"It was a gift, from a grateful widower. I proved his wife's death was accidental, and not a murder as the police were first led to believe. It's just been me, so it seems wasteful, and I keep meaning to sell it….."
After hiding under an awning during the quick cloudburst, he takes out John's letters. He doesn't understand. Did John not mean what he wrote? John was a terrible liar. But had he fooled him?
"It has everything to do with it. Unrequited love or no, Greg is still my best friend. After Hamish, I say his name at least as many times in a day. I do talk to him, when I'm by myself. Because I had no one else to talk to," John gestures to the skull, "That's all it meant. Yes, I still have to work through some things, but I choose you. And Hamish chose you. And I'm not giving up without a fight."
John stops. He hears gravel sliding some yards behind him. Jesus, is that Sherlock? Did he find him already?
What is she doing? Why the weaving, zigging, zagging. (Oh. Clever.) She's following and watching an older couple, in their late 70s or 80s. Every street they cross, she follows. If they pause to look in a shop,  she stops. Billy comes around their flank to get a look, to see who they are. They move into a larger crowd, and Mary proceeds in another direction.
In the two years of Sherlock being dead, John had moved on with Mary. But John and Sherlock were always close to one another, so close they were combusting under the skin, then they pushed each other away. They were like the sun and a planet. This entire trip, roundabout flight to the Czech Republic, had been a disaster. They couldn't communicate. They were destructive when they were together. They risked each other's lives, and couldn't even talk about it. It was completely fucked up.
John thinks to himself that Sherlock cannot love, because Sherlock cannot trust. He assumes everyone, even his best friend, is an idiot. An army doctor, a captain, a sharpshooter, a man willing to die for his love, for his friend; an idiot. On the same level as Anderson.
On one pass, Sherlock rounded behind John  and forced his horse to a near crawl. They were riding northwest, and the sunlight was gliding over John's features. His back, his shoulders, his thighs were accentuated by sunlight. Dust that the horse kicked up floated around him, catching sunlight in a cloud. Sherlock surprised himself with the feeling of longing, of
"No, everyone I know is out on a mission. I don't want to impose. If I could just get a bite to eat then I'll be on my way..."
Love, and war, and the Holmes brothers were all mixing together. They were in the middle of battle and firefights still, and more was to come, but he'd promised himself that if he made it out alive…..
Mycroft looked at his mother with soft eyes. He sat down beside Sherlock, "John needed something to keep him busy. For twelve hours you've only moaned and we could barely get water into you. Over two days we weren't sure you'd fully wake up. He is with his clan bringing materials so he can build a house to care for you."
Now, with the sheep wandering out in the morning light, the fire helped steady Sherlock's thoughts. William put his hand on his shoulder.
John smiled, pulling himself to Sherlock,  "I can't stop touching you. Yes, I'm rather fond of your hair. But I love you."
"I bet you looked beautiful. With your long curls and your alabaster skin," John stepped closer, "May I hold your hand?"
"Sssshhh," John pulled on his arm, "Don't say that too loudly, you make me sound like a psychopath."
She nodded, "Yes, my love. And I'm sorry. The agreement is for you to travel to his estate and have a two week engagement period before the marriage."
He decides the "forgiveness" speech will have to be just that. A speech. Rehearsed. And told to her as such. Mary doesn't know that John is aware of the additional threats she made to Sherlock, and these threats involve killing Magnussen.
Medical professionals filtered in, some looking well rested, others more haggard looking than John. Greg Lestrade, R.N., filtered in wearing sunglasses and sat beside John.
After one am, when sleep was still evasive, he debated exactly what shade of blue he could call John's eyes. In the middle of his musings, he heard a faint knocking on his door. Hamish peeked in.  His cheeks were wet.
Sherlock looked into John's eyes, resting his forearms on John's shoulders. Sherlock began running his fingers through John's  hair as he spoke, "It will naturally slow down, with my work, your work, when I'm living at my apartment again."
"That didn't work with your son," Sherlock laughed, "He woke me up to tell me you were out here smoking."
John tries to breathe as he feels more tears welling to the surface (is he always crying now?) and he grabs onto Sherlock tightly. Sherlock rubs his hands up and down John's back, kissing his forehead, his neck. He gently picks up his chin again, they are looking into each other's eyes. John is still gulping back sobs, now gripping Sherlock's arms.
Before Sherlock could react, John had come from the other direction in the alley and tackled the man to the ground, knocking him out cold. When he came up, he was grinning.
"Sherlock," John looked up at him. The wet fabric was sticking to him, and Sherlock could see everything. His knees, his muscled thighs, the juncture of his legs, and his manhood jutting up and tenting the kilt.
Sherlock put his hands on John's shoulders. His ribs were screaming at him. He prayed for the pills to kick in and that the pain wasn't showing on his face, "We're even, then. I've never talked about myself with anyone, either. Now, does he not get along with Greg's children?"
Sherlock felt his brain short circuit when he looked into John's eyes, with the blonde over blue, he was awash with emotion and at a loss for words. Cocaine or six days with little sleep never did this. A feeling of this magnitude was reserved for this man alone.
As they entered the dining room, John heard upbeat piano and cello music. They weaved around white linen tables until they arrived at the Captain's table. Sherlock guided John to sit next to a silver haired man and a blonde woman, obviously dyed. When they sat down, Sherlock discreetly moved his chair closer to John so their thighs were touching. John smiled at him. When Sherlock smiled back, John had to fight the urge to jump back up and kiss him senseless.
Sherlock watched John's face, using his finger to trace his cheekbone and jaw. He fixed a bit of John's hair that was sticking up, and John adjusted a couple of Sherlock's stray curls.
John panics feeling wetness all over him, Sherlock pulls away, giving him an odd look. Sherlock looks behind him, the tea cup has spilled over the table, on Sherlock's sheet, and on John.
"Please. I've forgiven you," Mummy Holmes says, reaching across Billy's lap to pat Daddy Holmes on the knee.
John looked at him, sensing Sherlock was tensing up or upset, as it had been a few seconds since he'd moved or spoken. He stood on his tiptoes, coming close to Sherlock's ear, "You ok?"
After brunch, John and Sherlock went back to John's flat to discuss Hamish's proposal. John's father was on the couch, his mother in a chair. They both had their heads tilted backwards and were snoring.They were covered in cut out bits of paper, as if they were furniture. The living room was a disaster. There was a notebook spread out with more cut out photos, notes, and diagrams. John knew that if he hadn't forbade taping papers on the wall that's where all of this would be.
"Sherlock, what would have happened if your pet and brother and caravan had barged in here without your intervention?"
Sherlock swallowed. He'd been around more people since the hospital than he'd been in months. Kind people. It would be even harder to go back to being alone, now that he'd gotten used to being cared for.
. It didn't work. The realization, the declaration, would have to wait for potentially even more tragic circumstances for their feelings to come to light.
He put the stallion in an old enclosure that he'd built years before to keep his pony in. He went across the stream, splashing his feet in the cold water, sitting himself into the cradle of a large tree. This was his thinking spot. The tree branches provided shade, but there was an opening where he could still see the sky.
John had never heard his name said that way. He could live never hearing it said that way again. Sherlock's tone was angry, it was biting, it was vicious. It was injured. It was hurt.
John ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair, "Are you unhappy that you had to marry me on the cruise to solve the case?"
He recalls the first time meeting them. Sherlock had pushed them out of their flat so quickly he thought they were clients.
Sherlock, spread out before him, pleading. John applied lubricant and one finger into Sherlock, watching his back arch, a few tears escaping from the corners of his eyes. He removed his finger, "Am I hurting you?"
Hamish nodded. As he walked through the doorway, he shouted towards the kitchen, "Daddy, Mr. Detective needs you! He's crying!"
Now, John used his arm to steady himself, the fingers working somewhat to help him dress, he'd had to learn to crack eggs with just his right hand, brushing his teeth was achieved by mashing the tube with his left fist and twirling the toothbrush with his right hand. Everything took longer, but his reward was Sherlock by his side, the reminder the ring on his finger.
, a romantic one. Were they both the same sign, a fist pointed toward one's chin, then a knock on your chin as if you were knocking on a door? He figured he wouldn't leave that one to chance. He'd type out asking Sherlock on a date so there would be no question.
Like a petulant child caught sneaking sweets, "It was John," which causes John to go into a fit of giggles and bury his head in Sherlock's neck.
John checks himself, with difficulty, and gently rubs and rinses Sherlock. He takes moments to hold him, whispers into his ear as the water warms their skin pink. John loses track of how many times he tells Sherlock he loves him, how much he's missed him, and how amazed he is at how their bodies perfectly fit together.
In the middle of packing, John was fixing dinner, letting the other two boys sort. He looked over at Sherlock. He was sitting on the floor with his arms over his knees, rocking slightly, almost imperceptibly.
John strips his pants, and goes to pull at the waistband of his lover's when Sherlock stops him with his fingers on his jaw, "John, John."
Sherlock wiped tears away with the heels of his hands. He realized he was shaking, and couldn't remember the last time he ate.
"You're not mad at me?" Hamish had tears running down his face. Sherlock used his ragged shirt to dry them off.
"No, it's just, most everyone I've been around is not kind at all to Hamish," John lowered his voice, "Anyone I've tried to date doesn't want anything to do with us after the third or fourth date because they don't understand him. And you understand him," John smiled, then blushed realizing the context of what he'd said, "Not that we're dating, you and I, jesus, just trying to explain how rare of a person you are."
Hamish piped up, looking up at both men from his open book, "Daddy, he doesn't have anyone. There aren't any flowers, and he doesn't have any missed call messages from the nurse's desk. His coat is well worn on the back hem, but well kept on the front. No one sees him to tell him the coat is fraying, so he only takes care of what he can see alone. You've been looking at your phone all day, daddy, call Uncle Greg."
John grins. He's looking forward to a night of war stories and discussions that do not revolve around a detective or a murdered body.
"Oh my god," John exhaled, grabbing the bench, willing himself to relax, "You are making up for lost time."
"And for the record," John squeezes Sherlock tightly to him, puts a hand on Mycroft's shoulder, forming a circle, "The two of you care. Far more than you'd like to admit. Far more than you want to show. I'm glad..." John coughs, finds it difficult to continue, "I'm glad you're both here with me. That we are all in this together."
Sherlock felt a pressure on his other side. He jumped. The old man in the white tartan was sitting on his other side, leaning in to catch his attention. He grinned, revealing a mouth of rotted teeth.
They sat for a moment, each on the bed, staring at one another. Sherlock moved so he was poised on John's lap, his pelvis lined up with John's, but now there was no clothing in the way. His precome leaked onto John's penis, thick and wide, red with need, and John gulped, grabbing Sherlock's ass and pushing them down into one another.
John returns to the flat. He's deciding, carefully, how to broach the subject. How to bring it, well, everything up. The hiding in plain sight with a hospitalization, keeping Mary at a distance but still believing they trust her; John knows he has to keep himself together and not misspeak or misstep. He has rehearsed his words with Mycroft, but they ended up dissolving into giggles at one point, (the two brothers really are alike, John thought.)
He doesn't know why John is so angry. The plan still worked.  John isn't hurt, Mycroft isn't hurt, Sherlock isn't hurt. Why is he angry?
All five enter the crack house, move upstairs. The bodies are as they were when John entered not 15 minutes before. He still has to breathe through his nose and bite his cheek to keep tears from falling. He hears Lestrade huff "Jesus" and pull out a torch to more closely examine the bodies.
John watched the two of them for the next thirty minutes. They were bent over a couple of boxes, using a pencil and a marker to draw diagrams of some type on the box tops. He only caught snippets of their conversation. From what he could tell, they were configuring the laboratory and planning out where everything would fit. Both of them were grinning, each taking turns talking and writing something new on the bits of cardboard lying around the room.
Sherlock was either interpreting his words incorrectly to the Deaf members of the audience or he was bold enough to talk about him. Sherlock was the only one turned enough for him to see. He couldn't see Molly's face. He decided to beat them at their own game. He could be petty and vindictive, too.
John had the good sense to blush. He scooted himself to put his back to Greg, causing the other man to giggle. "Just giving it to you, mate," Greg said, "All I did was drink some beer and fall asleep. I don't understand how you can point someone out and just get them to go to bed with you. It's a skill."
John whispered, "You started it," which caused Greg to bite his lips to hold back a giggle. The speaker ended her portion, indicating a longer break between sessions. John sighed "Thank god," and headed right for the refreshments, grabbing another coffee. He jumped as he felt someone come right up behind him.
"Because you will be the one to kill him for me, Sherlock," She says, clicking the 'ck' in his name. Smiling as she comes right up to him, looking up into his eyes, "You will kill Magnussen. If you don't, I promise that" She points her gun at Samantha's dead body, "I will kill," She shoots Samantha in the chest, a little to the right of her heart, "John."
John kept his hands to himself as they drove to Sherlock's home. He was nervous and excited as they drove the few blocks to his small home. Sherlock parked the car, winking at John as he bounded to the front door, unlocking it quickly. John followed behind, allowing himself to be propelled and pulled up the stairs to a living room filled with books. Sherlock clicked the door shut and kissed John as he unbuttoned his shirt, leaving John breathless. John's head was spinning as he was kissed across his neck, his throat, all while Sherlock stripped himself of his clothes. Unable to speak to one another besides gestures and phone notes, John understood as Sherlock began pulling John's clothing off of him. John looked around, searching for the bedroom. Sherlock tilted his head, then pulled John to a room on the left.
"No, no, you didn't, come here," not thinking about if it were welcome or not, Sherlock picked Hamish up and hugged him, scooping him, the blanket, and his animal into his lap.
Sherlock thought how to phrase what he wanted to say, "Sometimes daddies can't tell you everything. He will tell you if he can, and only if it's important for you to know. Now, you need to go ask your daddy, if we can discuss your case? Or if it's too grown up?"
Now John slides to the floor, on his knees, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist. He puts his head on Sherlock's lap. John feels the detective's lovely fingers timidly stroke his hair.
Sherlock contacted Mycroft first, who was at home with Greg. The photo of Hamish, John, and Sherlock from just a few hours before was the most recent photo of Hamish. He had blonde hair, nearly white, but with curls. His eyes were blue. He was tanned, quite darker than Sherlock's complexion, and he was smiling widely.
As he came out of the pool, Julie waved at him. He was self conscious about his scar, but he figured he wouldn't see her again after this trip, "What can I help you with?"
A woman wearing perfume is near him, Jesus (Get Mary out of here! I want Sherlock!) and John feels arms and legs grip him tighter. He feels kisses ghosting against his jaw, his hairline, his lips. There are muddled noises, talking, as if through glass, and after a while the room stops spinning as much. He doesn't want this woman near him, and as her perfume waifs closer John tries to move, tries to yell and warn Sherlock but he is too sleepy. Too warm. His jaw won't open. He hopes Sherlock is safe.
Sherlock hardly breathed as John had spoken. His eyes never turned away, his voice never waivered. When John finished he leaned in close to Sherlock, pausing long enough for the younger man's consent. When Sherlock didn't flinch, John kissed him tenderly on the cheek.
Sherlock shook his head, "Nothing so nefarious, Dr. Watson. As much as my brother and I do not see eye to eye, he is my brother, and Greg Lestrade-Holmes is my family now. We will discuss this."
John lays under Sherlock, rubbing his hands under his shirt, feeling his ribs, kissing him deeply. He pulls his coat off of him and attempts to lay it over the back of the couch, but it slips to the floor. Sherlock giggles.
"John?" Mycroft was always business, "I just wanted to be sure you wanted this, that you weren't being pressured or locked in some dungeon until you agreed."
Mycroft sits in a smaller chair across from them; John has never seen him look more tired and annoyed.
"You've seen me. You've seen me dance, and not made fun of me. You've seen me ill, and you've cared for me. You've seen that I'm different, and you don't hate me for it, or think I am odd, in fact, you tell me that's why you love me. You see me as I am, and you love me. I want to know you better. I want to be with you, in every way I can be. I want to be your husband. Of course I want to marry you," without waiting for his father, Sherlock took the handfasting cloth and grasped John's forearm with his left hand, John's forearm resting on Sherlock's, John's hand grasping Sherlock's left elbow. Sherlock felt the cool rock and the sinewy cords of both their bracelets. Each man used their right hand to wind the cloth around their clasped arms. As the cloth was wound around their forearms, Sherlock continued, "I want you with me, John. To be by your side, forever."
Not only that, the questions were indicative of past circumstances. Past accidents. Sherlock's mind began to leap.
Sherlock couldn't move more than rocking back and forth, chasing both sensations of John pulling on his cock from root to tip, his finger dipping and pushing on that taut bit of muscle that made him light headed. He could feel himself pulling upward, his bollocks tightened up and he spent, his entrance loosened around John and he dripped all over John's fingers.
Mycroft sits in his office, sipping whiskey (a gift from the King of Spain.) They exchanged love letters tucked into gifts and shared clandestine meetings for a year. This aged whiskey was one last gift he hadn't been in a hurry to finish.
John felt ill, which was probably good for his facial expression. His discussion with Mary had worked, but now he would have to be apart from Sherlock to work out the next part of the plan.
John stood in front of Sherlock, bracing himself, Sherlock pulling himself up with the leverage of John's forearms. He nearly toppled into John's arms. Sherlock was just tipsy enough that his very thin filter was gone.
John slept in fits and starts, and spent the morning fussing over his hair and practicing his vows. At 11:30, he dressed in his deep blue suit. He had to admit that the hue brought out the color in his eyes, and he wondered if Sherlock had picked it out.
John smiled, wrapping his right arm tighter around Sherlock's neck, resting their foreheads against one another. "No, you've not done a thing wrong. We just haven't talked about the case at all. I don't know what happened after the wedding. I don't know why Elias shot you, or how we ended up getting married for sure! I've got bits and pieces in my mind, but everything is fuzzy."
He recalls the first case, after the death of the cabbie, when Sherlock and Mycroft met in the car park and discussed Mummy. Mycroft had mentioned "You should've seen the Christmas dinners."
Sherlock moved his fingers. He traced John's cheek, his jawline, underneath his eyes. He felt his eyelashes flutter. Sherlock danced his fingers across John's collarbone, feeling his steady pulse.
John looks at Sherlock, searching, then pulls him in. Their lips rub, nipping, gently, at each other's, the only bodily contact John's hands on Sherlock's face. John wraps his arms around Sherlock's neck and back as they dip backwards just slightly, so Sherlock can kiss more deeply, wrapping his arms around John, pulling him to him, nearly every part touching from shoulders to shins.
Sherlock was dizzy and could hardly keep his eyes open. He crawled as close to John as he could, rubbing his fingers against the soft hair of his beard. Before oblivion took him, he kissed John, missing his target. He smacked his lips on the side of John's mouth, sighing out loud enough for his cousins and brother to hear, "Please, let John. Let him. Let him lay with me in my bed. My beautiful grian."
Hamish answered, now pouring far too much batter onto the griddle, "You're making him nervous, daddy. He has an intermittent tremble when you're near him but I don't think he minds, as he's assertive enough to tell you to leave him alone if you were really bothering-"
John rubbed the back of his own neck, another physical tic when he was nervous "It kind of feels like we are already married, escaping away, doesn't it? Leaving from the same house?"
With most of the dizziness gone, Sherlock appreciated the beauty of the room, and the difference between being the Master of one's own home versus the youngest brother in one. Rather than sleeping on an old bed on the floor, he hoped his master room with John would be open and beautiful like this, with a fireplace, room for a tub, window, snap rods for plaids to hang when pressed and room for books and his experiments. No longer would all his items be tucked here and there in barn corners or in stone hiding places. He would be in charge of his own home, and his own help.
They were sat at the table nearest the window, and provided a candle because it was 'more romantic,' which made John giggle and Sherlock shush him. John then asked if they would be ordering one bowl of spaghetti and meatballs without any silverware, to which Sherlock gave him a blank stare. John then had to explain the scene of "Lady and the Tramp," but gave up when Sherlock argued, "But dogs can't talk! That is a ridiculous idea for a movie."
Mr. Watson sighed, "Sherlock, son, please sit." His eyes were soft, his tone pleading, "We can come across, as quite intense. We just-" he gestured his hands in a circular motion, as if he were using his hands to bring him an idea, "I guess we're extremely happy for John and excited to meet you. We just want you to know that. John has had a hard time meeting people, and we're happy that he introduced you."
Sherlock listened in the hallway. Mrs. Hudson was sleeping quietly,  Sherlock pulled a chair to the front window. He cradled his violin, plucking it absentmindedly, looking out over the traffic that rumbled by at all hours. He never second guessed himself, always knowing what to say and when to say it for maximum effect, turning a certain way and knowing that was the dogged path he would follow until the job was completed.
"You're right. Right on most everything. One thing happened differently. For his first wedding, to Abigail, I was his best man. I couldn't say no. He was my best friend. He, I." John looked down at his glass, spinning around the ice, "I taught him to dance. So he could waltz with her. It killed me. But it was easier. Him marrying a woman, I mean. I could say that it was because he wasn't gay or didn't like men that way. But when he started dating Mycroft, it hurt. It killed me, because when he and Abigail divorced…"
Mycroft moves closer to Robert and looks in his eyes. Mycroft has always paid proper respect to those in authority, those who can take information and modify it. He realizes,  deep down, he's worried for Robert. They've worked around each other, in the same office space, for years now, but he finds himself drawn to his insane optimism.
They sit together, side by side, and John wonders how he kept himself from touching Sherlock all these years. Their hands wind around each other, their fingers touch one another's faces, they talk as they've always done but they touch as much as they can. John still feels a little dizzy but he's not sure if it's the illness or having Sherlock so close, his eyes completely focused on John.
The group of five men circle around them, moving out towards the chinook. Mycroft gives a signal to move forward, and the tactical troops surge forward, quickly overtaking the five men. John sees a blurry swirl of activity in his night vision goggles, but can tell that they have been contained. Mycroft's plan has worked as he intended.
Sherlock opened his thighs as John shuddered, the slickness of Sherlock's release allowing John to move even quicker against his husband. John raised up, bringing Sherlock with him, into a sitting position. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's shoulders and his legs around his waist. As he was lifted onto John's lap, face to face, John released over Sherlock's cock, bollocks, and thighs.
Robert's breathing slowly returns to normal, "Mycroft, we don't know each other that well. I'd rather not-"
As they get up to leave, John watches Sherlock carefully folding up their conversations and putting them in his pocket. John attempts to pay, but Angelo rushes them out. Angelo signs some things to Sherlock, in which Sherlock turns red and uses a sign that John instantly recognizes to tell Angelo to
John leaned over, licking a stripe up Sherlock's neck, sucking a bruise onto the side of it. Sherlock sucked in breath. John felt him drop the dildo and it fell out of his arse with a soft
"John." Mycroft; Commander out maneuvered by his baby brother. Or John out maneuvered by everyone. He still wasn't sure.
Now, one month after their wedding, Sherlock was leading John up their stairs. On the way home from hospital, in Mycroft's car, he was snuggled up against Sherlock and was more talkative than he had been since before the wedding. They chatted about nothing in particular, the weather, the state their flat might be in due to Sherlock's untended experiments, the need for John to stay in Sherlock's room so he wouldn't have to go up another flight of stairs.
God, it comforted John to no end that Sherlock looked absolutely bored and annoyed, "They would be dead from your ambush."
It still hurt like hell to watch. This was no junkie on a binge. This had been a man coming absolutely unhinged, his mind and heart rattling along off the tracks.
"Mom!" John came out front wearing an absolutely filthy white apron, " No, you two sit and get to know Sherlock a little bit. But be nice," he disappeared back into the kitchen. Sherlock began biting at the skin around his thumbnail.
John sits in his chair. From this angle, he can see even a larger chunk of the wallpaper under the smiley face has been turned up. He goes to the wallpaper for a closer inspection.
John couldn't determine how Sherlock meant his name this time. It wasn't playful, or fearful, or angry. It was plain, simple, his name on Sherlock's lips. Sherlock didn't say anything else, but went downstairs to begin packing. John followed behind with his suitcase.
Sherlock turned when he heard the steel toed boots clack on the wood flooring. The man, a little older than him, (late 20s to early 30s) was shorter, but built. He had muscles on his shoulders and upper arms, and he was tan and blonde haired. Sherlock had to consciously keep his mouth shut as John was wearing a white tank and shorts, leaving almost none of his upper body to the imagination.
Hamish saw him first, "Are you better, Mr. Detective?" He put his cards down, running to give Sherlock a huge hug. His head rested against his stomach, and instinctively, Sherlock stroked his hair.
He climbed back into bed, kissing Sherlock's fingers, "I wanted these days alone with you, my beloved, to get to know you, so we could go slowly, and not have any worries about building our home. I don't want you to worry. I will love everything you want to try, or anything you don't or do want to do."
Mycroft laughed and Sherlock smiled, "My brother has always been good at defending himself. If someone starts a fight he'll finish it."
"Jesus Christ," John exhales, moving backwards to sit on the couch. He jumps, his eyes adjusting to the dark; Sherlock had been sitting keeping watch in a chair near the window. Sherlock moves over to him, sitting on John's lap, overlapping kisses from his neck up his jawline.
He remembers Sherlock here, doing his best to care for him in his illness, when their plans were falling apart in a disastrous fashion. He sinks to the floor, pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes. He sits, staring at the floor in front of him, watching the shadows lengthen and the sunlight disappear.
Hamish started again, looking from his father to Sherlock, "Well, I was talking about my birthday party with Melissa and Amanda. They wanted to know if Mr. Detective was coming. They know he's living with us. They asked if he's daddy's boyfriend, and I wasn't sure how to answer. They then asked if I had two daddies now, like they have two daddies, and I didn't know the answer to that question, either."
"Missed you," John said, in a questioning tone. He leaned forward a bit, "Are we ok? Did I do something? Or move too quickly?"
As John spoke, Sherlock turned his head, causing their faces to nearly connect. John crinkled his nose, "You smell lovely."
The rustiling of clothing gets louder, more impatient. Mycroft must be sitting next to the chair by his bed, so Sherlock snaps his eyes open. There is no Mycroft. He sees the wide, blue eyes of a child not inches from his face.
Sherlock pushed Mycroft and Tavis away, putting the heels of his hands in his eyes, "Does John not love me?"
"I guess," John's voice was shaking, "it's just I have been alone for so long. I've had to work while I've been sick. I've been exhausted. I've never had anyone else around for years. It just hit me. You're here. With us. I'm not alone. I'm not doing all this by myself anymore."
Sherlock tried to sulk, on his own he could easily lay on his couch for days, stuck in his own mind. Today, when he tried to retreat to his mind palace, he was drawn away by the giggling in the front room. There were accusations and deductions and it was louder than his house had ever been. He decided to get up and at least have his sulk around other people.
"Aye there, 'Lock!" Tavis burst, causing many of the guests to turn and gawk. Tavis looked after the old Wallace side of the family with large, broad shoulders and chest, muscled, tan. He frequently would only wear an old, ratted kilt, preferring to run around as bare as possible, his heavy calloused feet keeping grounded to the stubbed grass of the earth as he tended the flock. Tavis was Sherlock's dearest cousin, and taking time nearly every day to help Sherlock, Mycroft and their parents, Victoria and Stuart. The Holmes family was smart, and as leaders of the clan, their ability to plan and maximize resources was unparalleled. Tavis, with the use of his sheer brute strength, assisted the clan in the use of the barn house, the care of the sheep and moving trades across clans.
There was Sherlock's bright smile; the true one that John couldn't help kissing and nipping at as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock, as his detective ran his fingers through John's graying sandy hair.
Hamish looked at Sherlock as if he'd grown three heads. John was so familiar with that look. It was Hamish's,
"John, John. I feel so...I'm not sure. Please. Please..." Sherlock rocked himself, pushing backwards onto John's thumb that was just dipping into his body, and feeling the pressure of John's hand running over his prick. He felt very warm, and exposed, but lovely and nearly overheated.
who is even more annoying than usual. Sebastian's parents' flight is late and Sherlock mentioned his brother and parents had to leave the country suddenly.
When he turned, he jumped. At the edge of his lamp's light he could just see a squat, sturdy, black as midnight stallion. Mounted upon the stallion, with a simple cloth and leather saddle, was a man with his upper plaid wrapped around him as a cloak.
As she steps into the room, she looks at Sherlock through half closed eyes, shock registering on her face; unable to mask it. She cocks her head to the side and raises an eyebrow at Mycroft.
"Here," John put his knuckles in a rolling motion into his back, "Your muscles are cramping due to lack of use. It will hurt like hell, but we will need to take you on a short walk tomorrow."
Mycroft is continuing to read John's face, or his clothing, or the way he's holding his lips in a tight, gray line. Perhaps he's looking at his hair sticking up at all angles, or the wrinkles in his clothes. John just stands, ready for orders. He's ready for war. He almost feels his gun in the small of his back, his hands itching for it, but he stands still, waiting. Mycroft needs to call this, John isn't thinking straight. He knows enough to understand that this is a danger area for him. He hurt and missed.....so he married out of duty for something he started. But he would have waited, if he had any idea. His allegiance is clear.
"Who else is a superb actor, John, who moves in disguises and gets the masses to see what he wants them to see? I can assure you, my brother is clever, but he is under 24 hour surveillance. He is at hospital. Mrs. Hudson is with family."
Tears pricked at his eyes as he breathed normally, through his lungs. The nurse counted his breaths, took his O2 saturation. Normal.
John sat up, pulling Sherlock forward. He drew the young man into his arms, their foreheads touching. John nipped at Sherlock's lips, "You are mine, Sherlock Holmes. Now and forever. Don't you ever talk about anyone else having you. You are mine."
The insurance is just coincidental as statistically they insure 90% of midwest theatres, so there is no individual link between them all. This, however, is a glitch we can't explain. Each time he is an understudy, the actor he works with is hurt, or dies, and this Magnussen takes the stage."
"These small silver fox tails remind me of your eyes. Especially when they are wet with dew, early in the morning. I could stare into your eyes for days."
, I don't have a fire going with water on the hearth," He explained, pouring water from the pitcher onto the rag, coming to bed to gently run it over Sherlock's arse, bollocks, thighs, fingers, and stomach. John then used the rag on himself, then used another to dry them both.
The meet at the front door when they're done. They whisper, kiss into each other's necks; do their best to wipe each other's tears. They know, in every moment, breath, and movement they belong to each other and each other alone. Silent, they leave together, in Mycroft's car, holding each other's hands until John is dropped at Baker Street. John kisses him quickly and leaves the car. To dawdle would arouse suspicion.
he writes. Robert says, "I'm afraid that if we continue to see each other, that they will feed information to Magnussen." He writes so Mycroft can see,
John didn't feel this anticipation with anyone before; not Mary, not any past boyfriends or girlfriends. He winds his fingers through Sherlock's, listening to his hiccuping cries slow and recede. He leads Sherlock to the bed, sits him down on it, and kneels in front of him, on both knees. He takes Sherlock's hands in his, moving them against his own face, kissing his finger tips.
He sleeps with the cell phone on his chest, over his heart, to the sound of rain gently falling on the windowpane.
There is no time for contemplating; there's only time for action. The detective breaks into a paced jog when he sees Billy on a bench at the edge of the green space.
Sherlock took John's hand, gripping it tightly, "I was curious, always getting into experiments and testing things in the garage. The neighbor, he was nice, at first. He would come over, would talk to my parents. He started to touch me a lot."
John laughed, grabbing his arse and bouncing him up further on his waist, "You're not more than a bird. Come with me. Let's get you cleaned up."
Mummy Holmes has taken it upon herself to check each door, each window before bed. She's seen a young man creep around her house near evening, and she's grown suspicious.
Sherlock made himself focus on the ceremony and not the panicked thoughts running through his mind. As the eldest clansman, Stuart Holmes directed the ceremony with his wife by his side and the Lestrade family standing beside. Sherlock focused on his father telling everyone gathered the story of the two grooms' unique love match.  He watched his red-haired brother, grinning, pledge his love, fidelity and belongings to a man he hardly knew. Gregory Lestrade, freckled and brunette, blushed as his hands shook while they wrapped the decorated tartan around their hands. At the end, they sealed the vows with a deep kiss and whoops and yells from the attendees.
Sherlock turned and whispered back, "You are brilliant, my dear," and gave John a small kiss on his cheek.
